500|$|The play arguably equates {{love and}} sex with death. Throughout the story, both Romeo and Juliet, {{along with the}} other characters, fantasise about it as a dark being, often equating it with a lover. Capulet, for example, when he first discovers Juliet's (faked) death, {{describes}} it as having deflowered his daughter. Juliet later erotically compares Romeo and death. Right before her suicide, she grabs Romeo's dagger, saying [...] "O happy dagger! This is thy sheath. There rust, <b>and</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> die." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{production}} {{consists of}} various computer beats and electronic effects. The song contains an ascending bridge {{incorporated into the}} chorus, which consists of the lines: [...] "If you're ready for me boy / You'd better push the button <b>and</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> know / Before I get the wrong idea and go." [...] Lyrically, the song is about a woman's sexual frustration of being unnoticed by a man. [...] Joe Macare of Stylus Magazine described Buena's delivery of the lyric [...] "my sexy ass" [...] as [...] "carefree", and noted that the lyrics adapt an [...] "idiosyncratic approach" [...] to the English language. Musically, [...] "Push the Button" [...] received comparisons {{to the sound of}} pop group ABBA.|$|E

In an interview with IGN, Larter explained her return to the franchise: [...] "When New Line {{asked me to come}} back, I thought it was great. They showed me the script <b>and</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> have some input, and it was really terrific." [...] The film made US$90 million worldwide, to a mixed critical reception. A year later, Larter served as an associate producer of and starred in the thriller Three Way, and in 2005, she appeared in the independent political thriller Confess, and had a role in the romantic comedy A Lot Like Love, starring Amanda Peet and Ashton Kutcher.|$|E

[...] Passersby carried Billy Clanton to the Harwood house, where Tom had been taken. Billy was in {{considerable}} pain and asked for a doctor and some morphine. He told those near him, [...] "They have murdered me. I have been murdered. Chase the crowd away and from the door and give me air." [...] Billy gasped for air, and someone else heard him say, [...] "Go away <b>and</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> die." [...] Ike Clanton, who had repeatedly threatened the Earps with death, was still running. William Cuddy testified that Ike passed him on Allen Street and Johnny Behan saw him a few minutes later on Toughnut Street.|$|E

500|$|Late in 2003, Timbaland {{delivered}} the second Bubba Sparxxx album, Deliverance, {{and the third}} Timbaland & Magoo album, Under Construction, Part II Both albums were released to little fanfare or acclaim even though Deliverance was praised by reviews and embraced by the internet community. In 2004 Timbaland produced singles for LL Cool J, Xzibit, Fatman Scoop, and Jay Z, and he produced the bulk of Brandy’s fourth album, Afrodisiac. Timbaland co-wrote two tracks (Exodus '04 <b>and</b> <b>Let</b> <b>Me</b> Give You My Love) and produced three tracks of the American-Japanese Pop star Hikaru Utada’s second English album, Exodus. He continued working on tracks for Tweet and for Elliott’s sixth album, The Cookbook: [...] "Joy (feat.

500|$|The lyrics for One Fierce Beer Coaster utilize {{over-the-top}} satire {{and toilet}} humor to provide comedy. For instance the album opener, [...] "Kiss Me Where It Smells Funny", {{is a song}} about {{a man and his}} new girlfriend and their adventures in cunnilingus. It was written by Jimmy Pop about his then-girlfriend; the two subsequent albums would each have one song about said girlfriend - [...] "Three Point One Four" [...] and [...] "No Hard Feelings," [...] respectively. [...] "Lift Your Head Up High (And Blow Your Brains Out)" [...] is a satirical call for people who have considered suicide to go through with the act, because their life is worthless. Three minutes into the song, Jimmy Pop says [...] "Rewind <b>and</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> reverse it backwards like Judas Priest first did." [...] Immediately after this, a four-second segment of backwards vocals repeats four times. When played in reverse, this segment says, [...] "Devil shall wake up and eat Chef Boyardee Beefaroni." ...|$|E

The season was distributed by Comedy Central, where the series has aired {{since its inception in}} 1997. Frank C. Agnone II served as supervising producer, while Eric Stough, Adrien Beard, Vernon Chatman, Bruce Howell and Erica Rivinoja worked as producers. Parker also served as director and writer for the thirteenth season. Saturday Night Live cast member Bill Hader, who had previously worked as a consultant on the show, was credited as a producer starting in season 13. Hader said of his role with the show, [...] "It's really Trey and Matt who kind of write everything, and you're just in the room kind of helping them. Basically, I'm friends with them and they're just nice enough to invite me into the room <b>and</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> goof around." [...] Ryan Quincy served as director of animation during the 13th season.|$|E

In terms of the stimulus you talked about, it was failed. [...] <b>And</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> tell you what I talked about with respect to the stimulus. I talked about the need for more tax cuts in the stimulus... We had done historic tax cuts. We created a flat tax in the state of Utah, exactly what needs to happen in this country. We got the economy moving. We became the number-one job creator in this nation and the best managed state. That's exactly what needs to happen in this nation.

500|$|The {{protagonist of}} the prior film, Alex Browning (Devon Sawa), was killed {{off-screen}} in the film. Rumors indicated that Sawa had a contract dispute with New Line concerning the deduction of his salary; however, Perry resolved {{the issue with}} the statement that [...] "it had everything to do with narrative, and nothing to do with money or Devon’s unwillingness to come back." [...] Despite this, New Line reinstated Ali Larter to reprise her character as Clear Rivers. [...] "When New Line asked me to come back, I thought it was great. They showed me the script <b>and</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> have some input, and it was really terrific," [...] Larter revealed. Larter indicated that Clear [...] " [...] gotten to a hardened place and tucked herself inside because she has felt so much pain in her life. By having herself committed to a mental hospital, she has created a safehouse so that Death can't get her." [...] Tony Todd also resumed his character as mortician William Bludworth. [...] "It’s the same character that we saw before that the audience loved," [...] Ellis expressed.|$|E
500|$|Although Scott-Heron {{received}} top-billing for the release, Jamie xx worked {{solely on}} the remix project. For We're New Here, he remixed 13 of the original album's 15 songs, including its [...] "interlude" [...] cuts, mixing Scott-Heron's vocal tracks from the original recording sessions over his own beats and instrumentals, rather than the original music. Many of the remixes were created by Jamie xx on his laptop, while on tour with The xx. In a March2010 interview, {{he said that the}} label [...] "gave me the parts <b>and</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> do whatever I want, so I've been doing it on my laptop on tour. [...] only using [...] vocals, I'm not using any of the original music from it, which is very freeing". On his intentions for the album's music, he explained in an interview for The Irish Times, [...] "I wanted it to sound like everything I had been listening to in London. I wanted it to sound like something you’d hear on pirate radio. You hear so many different genres, and it’s all so convoluted and mixed-up, but it makes sense when you turn on the station".|$|E
500|$|The term [...] "Obamacare" [...] was {{originally}} coined by opponents as a pejorative. The term emerged in March 2007 when healthcare lobbyist Jeanne Schulte Scott {{used it in}} a health industry journal, writing [...] "We will soon see a 'Giuliani-care' and 'Obama-care' {{to go along with}} 'McCain-care', 'Edwards-care', and a totally revamped and remodeled 'Hillary-care' from the 1990s". According to research by Elspeth Reeve, the expression was used in early 2007, generally by writers describing the candidate's proposal for expanding coverage for the uninsured. It first appeared in a political campaign by Mitt Romney in May 2007 in Des Moines, Iowa. Romney said, [...] "In my state, I worked on healthcare for some time. We had half a million people without insurance, and I said, 'How can we get those people insured without raising taxes and without having government take over healthcare?' <b>And</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> tell you, if we don't do it, the Democrats will. If the Democrats do it, it will be socialized medicine; it'll be government-managed care. It'll be what's known as Hillarycare or Barack Obamacare, {{or whatever you want to}} call it." ...|$|E
