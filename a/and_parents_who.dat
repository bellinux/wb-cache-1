5|$|Traditional Roman {{education}} was moral and practical. Stories about great men and women, or cautionary tales about individual failures, {{were meant to}} instil Roman values (mores maiorum). Parents and family members were expected to act as role models, <b>and</b> <b>parents</b> <b>who</b> worked for a living passed their skills on to their children, who might also enter apprenticeships for more advanced training in crafts or trades. Formal {{education was}} available only to children from families who could pay for it, {{and the lack of}} state intervention in access to education contributed to the low rate of literacy.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{greatest}} potential dangers {{of faith in the}} Bates method is that a believer may be disinclined to seek medical advice regarding what could be a sight-threatening condition requiring prompt treatment, such as glaucoma. Also, children with vision problems may require early attention by a professional in order to successfully prevent lazy eye. Such treatment may include exercises, but which are different from those associated with the Bates method, <b>and</b> <b>parents</b> <b>who</b> subscribe to Bates' ideas may delay seeking conventional care until it is too late. It may further be necessary for a child at risk of developing lazy eye to wear the proper correction.|$|E

25|$|Students in {{the school}} are {{required}} to wear school uniforms. In 2010, the school announced that its new uniform code will require students to buy shirts from the parent teacher organization. The shirts must have a DeBakey logo. This led to protests from students <b>and</b> <b>parents</b> <b>who</b> were unwilling to spend additional money on school-mandated clothes; DeBakey's student body as of that year was 55% free lunch or reduced lunch.|$|E
25|$|To the Catholic Church {{this was}} a {{declaration}} of all-out war. It called for a boycott of these new schools and it managed to mobilise almost the entire Catholic camp. Staff and supporters of public schools <b>and</b> <b>parents</b> <b>who</b> sent their children were denied communion and in effect excommunicated. The government cut diplomatic relations with the Vatican and measures against rebellious civil servants and clergy added fire to the heat. The Church required priests to establish a Catholic schools in every parish and attendance of Catholic schools rose from 13 percent to over 60 percent.|$|E
25|$|The {{campaigns of}} {{intelligent}} design proponents seeking curricular challenges have been disruptive, divisive and expensive for the affected communities. In pursuing {{the goal of}} establishing intelligent design {{at the expense of}} evolution in public school science classes, intelligent design groups have threatened and isolated high school science teachers, school board members <b>and</b> <b>parents</b> <b>who</b> opposed their efforts. The campaigns run by intelligent design groups place teachers in the difficult position of arguing against their employers while the legal challenges to local school districts are costly, diverting funding away from education and into court battles. For example, {{as a result of the}} Dover trial, the Dover Area School District was forced to pay $1,000,011 in legal fees and damages for pursuing a policy of teaching the controversy.|$|E

25|$|In the 1960s Gryce reinvented {{himself as}} a public school teacher in New York. He was {{somewhat}} interested in education throughout his life, and {{was said to be}} an excellent music instructor. He received a master's degree in education from Fordham University in 1978 and developed an incredible passion for teaching. He left a lasting legacy at Elementary School No. 53 in the Bronx, which was renamed in his honor after his death. Students, colleagues, <b>and</b> <b>parents</b> <b>who</b> encountered Gryce during this time knew him as a very private, serious, passionate, and caring man. Believing that music aided literacy, Gryce was a strict but caring teacher, and {{went out of his way}} to aid students at educational risk, working at an under-resourced mostly black and Hispanic school.|$|E
25|$|The 1924 ban on {{immigration}} produced unusually well-defined generational {{groups within the}} Japanese-American community. The issei were exclusively those who had immigrated before 1924; some desired {{to return to their}} homeland. Because no new immigration was permitted, all Japanese Americans born after 1924 were, by definition, born in the U.S. and automatically U.S. citizens. This nisei generation were a distinct cohort from their parents. In addition to the usual generational differences, issei men had been typically ten to fifteen years older than their wives, making them significantly older than the younger children of their often large families. U.S. law prohibited Japanese immigrants from becoming naturalized citizens, making them dependent on their children to rent or purchase property. Communication between English-speaking children <b>and</b> <b>parents</b> <b>who</b> spoke mostly or completely in Japanese was often difficult. A significant number of older nisei, many of whom were born prior to the immigration ban, had married and already started families of their own by the time the US joined World War II.|$|E
25|$|The {{expulsion}} of teachers was often related {{to violence and}} public degradation. In Losonc, Hungary deported 54 Slovak teachers on the demarcation line (Deák documents further examples of steps which eliminated Slovak schools). Slovaks lost 386 primary schools attended by 45,709 Slovak children and 29 council schools ("burgher schools") attended by 10,750 children. Four grammar school were closed in Kassa, and six in other towns. Remaining Slovak state employees (like railway workers) were forced to enrol their children into Hungarian schools. In several Slovak villages, police dispersed parents' associations <b>and</b> <b>parents</b> <b>who</b> demanded Slovak schools were beaten. Parents from Regeteruszka and Balogd who demanded Slovak school were imprisoned for two weeks. In several places Hungarian police burned Slovak school supplies, requested that they be burned by the school director or simply confiscated them. However, this pressure was not sufficient in general; for instance, in Nagysurány Slovaks excluded from their community anybody who enrolled children to Hungarian schools. Overcrowding of Hungarian classes with Slovaks had negative impact also on quality of education of local Hungarian population.|$|E

25|$|In 1994, only 15% of white, 6% of Hispanic, and 5% of African-American deaf {{high school}} {{graduates}} in the United States read above the sixth-grade level. In 1986, the median reading level of deaf American {{high school graduates}} was fourth grade. These concerning numbers are generally the result of varying levels of early language exposure. Most deaf children are born to hearing parents, which usually leaves a deficiency in their language exposure and development compared to children <b>and</b> <b>parents</b> <b>who</b> use the same modality to communicate. This group of children acquire {{a wide range of}} proficiency in a first language, which then impacts their ability to become proficient in a second (though sometimes possibly a first) language in the written modality. Children exposed to Manually Coded English (MCE) as their primary form of communication show lower literary levels than their ASL signing peers. However in countries such as Sweden which have adopted a bilingual–bicultural policy in their schools for the deaf, one sees a higher literacy rate compared to school systems favoring an oral tradition.|$|E

500|$|The {{book was}} {{published}} to immediate critical acclaim. Some reviewers praised the book as an exciting way to learn to read, particularly compared to the primers that it supplanted. Ellen Lewis Buell, in her review for The New York Times Book Review, noted the book's heavy use of one-syllable words and lively illustrations. She wrote, [...] "Beginning readers <b>and</b> <b>parents</b> <b>who</b> have been helping them through the dreary activities of Dick and Jane and other primer characters are due for a happy surprise." [...] Helen Adams Masten of the Saturday Review called the book Geisel's tour de force and wrote, [...] "Parents and teachers will bless Mr. Geisel for this amusing reader with its ridiculous and lively drawings, for their {{children are going to}} have the exciting experience of learning that they can read after all."

2500|$|Up {{until the}} early mid-20th century, {{mainline}} Christian denominations within the United States showed little official resistance to evolution. Around {{the start of the}} 20th century some evangelical scholars had ideas accommodating evolution, such as B. B. Warfield who saw it as a natural law expressing God's will. By then most U.S. high-school and college biology classes taught scientific evolution, but several factors, including the rise of Christian fundamentalism and social factors of changes and insecurity in more traditionalist Bible Belt communities, led to a backlash. The numbers of children receiving secondary education increased rapidly, <b>and</b> <b>parents</b> <b>who</b> had fundamentalist tendencies or who opposed social ideas of what was called [...] "survival of the fittest" [...] had real concerns about what their children were learning about evolution.|$|E
