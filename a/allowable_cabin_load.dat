30|$|Bookbinder et al. [5] present four exact {{solution}} methodologies {{for solving}} the air cargo consolidation problem under the pivot-weight scheme. In this problem, customer’s individual unit load devices (ULDs) are charged a penalty cost if the loaded weight fails to fall within an acceptable range; this penalty incentivizes proper aircraft balancing {{by creating a}} financial advantage to the customer to adhere to these rules [5]. A similar construct is presented in Sects.  4.5. 5 and 5.1 in application to this research effort: Aircraft are penalized if their <b>allowable</b> <b>cabin</b> <b>load</b> is outside of an acceptable range.|$|E
30|$|The overall DALP goal {{includes}} minimizing {{not only}} the number of flights required to transport all pallets, but also {{the total number of}} aircraft required, {{while at the same time}} minimizing aircraft <b>allowable</b> <b>cabin</b> <b>load</b> (ACL) violations and pallet temporal violations. An aircraft available for a DALP scenario but not required in the final solution can be utilized for other logistical transportation needs. ACL violations occur when the assigned cargo load weight surpasses the aircraft’s ACL; pallet temporal violations occur when a pallet’s arrival date is outside of its acceptable arrival window. By considering feasible and infeasible solutions (i.e., those with violations), senior level decision makers can choose a preferred solution from a set of solutions in order to balance the effectiveness and efficiency of airlift aircraft.|$|E
30|$|This {{research}} effort {{presents a}} tabu search algorithm {{to solve the}} dynamic airlift loading problem. Given a set of palletized cargo items which require transportation from an aerial port of embarkation to an aerial port of debarkation within a pre-specified time frame, the dynamic airlift loading problem seeks to partition the pallets into aircraft loads, select an efficient and effective subset of aircraft from available aircraft, and assign the pallets to allowable positions on those aircraft. The dynamic airlift loading problem differs from many partitioning and packing problems described in the literature because, in addition to spatial constraints, factors such as <b>allowable</b> <b>cabin</b> <b>load,</b> balance restrictions, and temporal restrictions on cargo and aircraft are included. The algorithm developed in this research, the dynamic airlift loading problem-tabu search, was tested {{on a variety of}} problem instances. Since real-world solutions are hand generated by subject matter experts and no previous research effort has solved this specific problem, the algorithmic results are compared to compute lower bounds on the number of aircraft trips required.|$|E

To improve work efficiency of cabin and solve the contradiction between load bearing and mass, combining parametric modeling and optimization theory,the influence curves of load bearing on mass are proposed.
