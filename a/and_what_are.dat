The student is taught to determine what investigations will be useful for a patient <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>are</b> the best treatment options. The curriculum also contains a thorough practical knowledge and practice of performing standard clinical procedures. The course also contains a 12-month-long internship, in which an intern is rotated across various specialties.

In November 1602, Sebastián Vizcaíno was sent to map the California coast.

500|$|The Genesis planet {{became a}} doomed {{experiment}} partly for dramatic reasons; having {{a time limit}} for the characters to save Spock added tension. Nimoy was also interested in scientific ethics—how quickly can science move <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>are</b> the dangers of that movement. University of Houston professor Dr. John Hansen notes that while Spock's sacrifice in The Wrath of Khan is the [...] "archetype of reason and rationality manifesting the archetype of human virtue," [...] a selfless and freely-made choice, the death of Valkris (who has learned {{too much about the}} Genesis Device) in The Search for Spock is far different: the Klingon willingly accepts her death for the [...] "common good" [...] as determined by the state, relinquishing her liberty and life. Hansen contends that the issues of personal liberty and the exploitation of technology, in this case Genesis, are [...] "intertwined". The Genesis Device was intended as a liberating technology, creating life from lifelessness, but in the Klingon view it is a tool for dominion (contrasting the contemporary views of how technology can promote or constrain liberty).|$|E

500|$|The Stonewall riots marked such a {{significant}} turning point that {{many aspects of}} prior gay and lesbian culture, such as bar culture formed from decades of shame and secrecy, were forcefully ignored and denied. Historian Martin Duberman writes, [...] "The decades preceding Stonewall... continue to be regarded by most gays and lesbians as some vast neolithic wasteland." [...] Historian Barry Adam notes, [...] "Every social movement must choose at some point what to retain and what to reject out of its past. What traits are the results of oppression <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>are</b> healthy and authentic?" [...] In conjunction with the growing feminist movement of the early 1970s, roles of butch and femme that developed in lesbian bars in the 1950s and 1960s were rejected, because as one writer put it: [...] "all role playing is sick." [...] Lesbian feminists considered the butch roles as archaic imitations of masculine behavior. Some women, according to Lillian Faderman, were eager to shed the roles they felt forced into playing. The roles returned for some women in the 1980s, although they allowed for more flexibility than before Stonewall.|$|E
500|$|Paleo-Indian {{presence}} {{in what is}} now Grand Teton National Park dates back more than 11,000 years. Jackson Hole valley climate at that time was colder and more alpine than the semi-arid climate found today, and the first humans were migratory hunter-gatherers spending summer months in Jackson Hole and wintering in the valleys west of the Teton Range. Along the shores of Jackson Lake, fire pits, tools <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>are</b> thought to have been fishing weights have been discovered. One of the tools found is of a type associated with the Clovis culture, and tools from this cultural period date back at least 11,500years. Some of the tools are made of obsidian which chemical analysis indicates came from sources near present-day Teton Pass, south of Grand Teton National Park. Though obsidian was also available north of Jackson Hole, virtually all the obsidian spear points found are from a source to the south, indicating that the main seasonal migratory route for the Paleo-Indian was from this direction. Elk, which winter on the National Elk Refuge {{at the southern end of}} Jackson Hole and northwest [...] into higher altitudes during spring and summer, follow a similar migratory pattern to this day. From 11,000 to about 500years ago, there is little evidence of change in the migratory patterns amongst the Native American groups in the region and no evidence that indicates any permanent human settlement.|$|E
500|$|Chickens are medium-sized, chunky {{birds with}} an upright stance and characterised by fleshy red combs and wattles on their heads. Males, known as cocks, are usually larger, more boldly coloured, {{and have more}} exaggerated plumage than females (hens). Chickens are gregarious, omnivorous, ground-dwelling birds that in their natural {{surroundings}} search among the leaf litter for seeds, invertebrates, and other small animals. They seldom fly except {{as a result of}} perceived danger, preferring to run into the undergrowth if approached. Today's domestic chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) is mainly descended from the wild red junglefowl of Asia, with some additional input from [...] grey junglefowl. Domestication is believed to have taken place between 7,000 and 10,000 years ago, <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>are</b> thought to be fossilized chicken bones have been found in northeastern China dated to around 5,400 BC. Archaeologists believe domestication was originally for the purpose of cockfighting, the male bird being a doughty fighter. By 4,000 years ago, chickens seem to have reached the Indus Valley and 250 years later, they arrived in Egypt. They were still used for fighting and were regarded as symbols of fertility. The Romans used them in divination, and the Egyptians made a breakthrough when they learned the difficult technique of artificial incubation. Since then, the keeping of chickens has spread around the world for the production of food with the domestic fowl being a valuable source of both eggs and meat.|$|E

He was a longtime friend of Abrams' parents, but became better acquainted with Abrams during filming. Although Quinto watched some episodes of the show during breaks in filming, Nimoy was his main resource in playing Spock.
