40|$|Cellulose nanocrystals (CNC) {{are great}} {{candidates}} for composite materials. The reasons why CNCs are such attractive materials for them {{are due to}} their great mechanical properties, high aspect ratio and low density. On the other hand, hydroxyapatite (HAp) {{is a kind of}} calcium phosphate and a main component of bones and teeth. The {{purpose of the present study}} is to make oriented nano-sized composites with CNC and HAp. Although some researchers carried out to make CNC composites with HAp for biomedical materials, nano-sized and oriented ones haven’t been achieved yet. Also, films made of CNC and other compounds are known to be transparent and have good oxygen permeability. Especially when CNCs’ direction is in parallel, they show high strength. However most previous researches dealt with particles or plate-like minerals in inorganic/CNC films, so there is no case that coated CNCs themselves were aligned <b>in</b> <b>the</b> films. Therefore fabrication of composite-oriented thin films is quite unique and it will be a potential step for bone-like hierarchical structure. In experiment, certain amount of CNC suspension with functional groups were put into revised simulated body fluid (r-SBF) solutions which were adjusted between pH 6. 9 - 7. 9 to make the molar ratio of calcium ion per functional groups on CNC surfaces between 30 - 230. The suspensions were put into the ultrasonic bath for 15 minutes <b>and</b> <b>stirred</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> thermostatic oven at 37 ⁰C for 1 hour. The process of ultrasound and stirring in oven was repeated 1 - 3 times depending on conditions. Precipitated products were collected with the centrifuge instrument and dried with the freeze dryer. Functional groups induced HAp’s nucleation and the HAp/CNC composites could be obtained under control of molar ratio of calcium ions per functional groups on CNC and pH. Morphology of the composites could be determined by pH and HAp content could be controlled between 25 - 75 wt% by initial molar ratio. The suspension having <b>the</b> composites synthesized <b>in</b> pH 7. 9 with low initial molar ratio was dropped on superhydrophilic glass substrates. At the moment, the substrates were set with leans of 20 degrees. Then they were dried at 60 oC for 3 hours and transparent films containing 25 - 40 wt% of HAp were obtained. The transmittances of the films were more than 90 % and their thicknesses were 2. 2 - 4. 2 μm. The films were suggested to have oriented structure by polarization microscope when the shape of the composites were needle-like homogeneously and independent each other. From the results from SEM, they were aligned longitudinally at both ends of the film and laterally at the upper middle part of the films. It is considered that controlling drying direction influenced on the orientation. The current study should become a promising step to build up a bone-like hierarchical structure artificially...|$|R
40|$|For {{the study}} of osmotic {{phenomena}} in living cells, and of their permeability to water and to solutes, the eggs of the sea urchin, Arbacia punctulata, {{have proved to be}} excellent material (1). The cells are spherical and of very uniform size; their spherical shape is maintained for hours in anisotonic solutions <b>in</b> which <b>the</b> course of volume change may be followed from the beginning to equilibrium by measuring ceU diameter under the microscope. However, such direct measurements, while accurate, are laborious, and they suffer from the disadvantage that they are based upon individual cells which are subject to a certain degree of variability. It seemed desirable therefore to search for a method of measurement by means of which the variability of individual cells would be averaged out. An adaptation of a diffraction method for measuring small objects, first described by Thomas Young (2) in 1813 was found suitable for our purposes. By this method we were able to measure with satisfactory accuracy the average diameter of large numbers of cells.

These were purely aesthetic in nature, and thus, considered above the vulgar articles fashioned by traditional craft techniques for everyday use. Crafts were the product of the working man, not the creative, inspired artist. With the technological revolution and the new dependence upon machines to produce our everyday needs, fewer and fewer articles were handmade by skilled craftsmen. There were some ongoing craft activities, for some amount of interest was always present. The English and American Arts and Craft Movements were in full swing {{by the end of the}} Nineteenth Century, but seemed to fade a bit after several years. After World War Two, interest began to <b>stir,</b> <b>and</b> again <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1960 's. Today, the traditional craft techniques have faded somewhat in their original applications. The techniques remain, however, and have now been joined by new ideas and images to challenge the more "accepted" areas of art. The crafts have come out from the shadows of the fine arts, and the artisan has emerged...|$|R
40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to prepare a {{water-resistant}} adhesive (SA) from soy flour (SF) with less water-soluble components. Design/methodology/approach - Defatted SF was suspended <b>and</b> <b>stirred</b> <b>in</b> water. Then, <b>the</b> pH of dispersion was adjusted to a predetermined value (i. e. 8, 9 or 10) by the addition of 2 M sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution. After stirring at a predetermined temperature (25 degrees C, 35 degrees C, 45 degrees C) for different time (1 h, 2 h, 3 h), the 2 M hydrochloric acid (HCl) solution was added in a dropwise manner into the dispersion until the pH value was adjusted to 4. 5. Then, the dispersion was centrifuged at 6, 000 rpm for 2 min. The obtained precipitate with less water-soluble components was used as an adhesive (SA) directly. Findings - SA had a wet strength of 1. 02 MPa when used for the fabrication of poplar plywood. Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) solution was applied to improve the tack of SAs to wood surface and the viscosities of SAs were decreased from 10, 200 cP to 4, 100 cP at room temperature after the PVA addition. <b>The</b> soy proteins <b>in</b> SAs were not denatured to a large extent according to the differential scanning calorimetry and light microscopy. The remained multilevel structures of soy protein played a positive contribution to the water resistance of SAs, and the bond lines of cured SAs were much more stable than those of the cured SF and soy protein concentrate (SPC). Research limitations/implications - The fluidity and solid content of soy adhesives is much lower than formaldehyde adhesives. Further investigations are needed to improve the fluidity of soy adhesives with high solid contents. Originality/value - Novel water-resistant soy adhesives were provided...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{about the idea of}} public {{transport}} <b>and</b> <b>the</b> discussions <b>stirred</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> media during changes in ownership. More specifically it is a study of the historical situation of Stockholm, Sweden, where the periods chosen are the 1910 s, 1960 s and 1990 s. During the 1910 s Stockholm’s first and largest tram company was taken over by thecity, and a period of public ownership began, which <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1960 s changed form whenthe county council took over the city’s principal authority and formed the politicallyadministered company SL (Storstockholms Lokaltrafik, Greater Stockholm LocalTransit Company). Between these periods the word kollektivtrafik (public transport) was established <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Swedish language. This study describes and compares the ideasconcerning the phenomenon of public transport. The aim of the study is to analyse the ideas, values and ideals concerning public transport <b>in</b> <b>the</b> media, defined as newspapers. The questions asked are: What doespublic transport involve as phenomenon and concept? For whom is the publictransport, and who is the owner? Which depictions of the passenger are presentedand what is their position <b>in</b> <b>the</b> traffic and the city? The conclusions drawn are that while the aims of the traffic-companies are mostly the same regarding the passengers and the economic priorities, the methods and technologies for realising these changes over time. <b>The</b> almost non-existingsurveillance <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1910 s tramcar, the emerging radio communication <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1960 sunderground railway of Stockholm and the establishing of video monitoring <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1990 s is one of the processes that suggest the changed situation of the passenger. Another line of development is the political question of ownership, which <b>in</b> theperiod of <b>the</b> study is ended by a deregulation of Stockholm’s public transport. <b>The</b> changes <b>in</b> ownership runs parallel to the evolution of the concept kollektivtrafik andthe question of who is to use and who is to own the public transport — but offer no final explanation to these maers...|$|R
40|$|Indigo {{fabric is}} created by dying silk or cotton with color from the true indigo plant (Indigofera tinctoria) and is a {{valuable}} commodity in Northeastern Thai communities. This is a qualitative investigation with two principal research aims: 1) To study the history and background of indigo-dyed fabric in Sakon Nakhon Province; 2) To study the current conditions and application of traditional knowledge in creating indigo-dyed fabric in Sakon Nakhon Province, Thailand. Data for this investigation were collected from document analysis and field research between July 2013 and July 2014. Results show that weaving groups are sponsored {{by the government and}} the local community to produce indigo-dyed fabric that can be transformed into a variety of different products that meet consumer needs. These products include blankets, scarves, shawls, formal wear and bags. Weaving communities prefer to use materials from the surrounding environment. Community members cultivate their own true indigo plants using the traditional processes inherited from generation to generation. The dye creation process requires plant matter to be soaked in water for 24 hours before it can be used <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dye mixture. The traditional dye mixture is 4 liters of indigo plant, 2 liters of natural lye water and 1 tablespoon of white lime. During the dyeing process, the cotton fabric is <b>stirred</b> <b>and</b> wring <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dye mixture until the color holds. The fabric is then rested and the process is repeated to achieve the desired hue. The quality of the dye is then tested by washing <b>the</b> fabric <b>in</b> clean water. By applying the resourcefulness of traditional knowledge used <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dye creation process to the marketing and sale of indigo fabric, the entire production will benefit...|$|R
40|$|Synopsis {{and review}} of the Australian prison film Stir (Stephen Wallace, 1980). Includes cast <b>and</b> credits. <b>Stir</b> was written by a former prisoner, Bob Jewson, who had {{witnessed}} first hand a notorious riot at Bathurst Gaol in New South Wales <b>in</b> February 1974, <b>the</b> second serious disturbance at <b>the</b> prison <b>in</b> four years. In 1979, prisoners at Parramatta Gaol staged a peaceful sit-in to protest against the New South Wales’ government’s decision not to pursue criminal charges against prison officers for their actions during the 1974 Bathurst riot. The bashing of China Jackson and his cellmate <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first scene of Stir follows a sit-in, {{with the rest of}} the film drawing heavily on events around the 1974 Bathurst riot. The director later claimed that he wanted to call the film ‘The Riot at Bathurst Prison’, but was persuaded by nervous bureaucrats to apply the veneer of fiction. The film was retitled <b>Stir,</b> <b>and</b> set <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fictional Gatunga Gaol. Like other films <b>in</b> this genre, <b>Stir</b> draws heavily on the experiences of former prisoners and warders. The Prisoners’ Action Group played a leading role <b>in</b> <b>the</b> planning and preparation of the film, and many former inmates and guards were employed as extras. And in common with many films <b>in</b> this genre, <b>Stir</b> is concerned to humanise the plight of prisoners. Through the depiction of the routines of punishment, violence and retribution by which order <b>in</b> <b>the</b> institution is maintained, and through careful evocation of the atmosphere of fear and intimidation that prisoners (and warders) live with every day, Stir, again like other films in this genre blames the authorities and the system itself for events like those portrayed here. As producer Richard Brennan says in an interview on the 2005 DVD release of the film, “prisons create monsters” [...] ...|$|R

40|$|The {{research}} and accompanying studio practice Defence Mechanisms visually interrogates the Australian individual's distanced relationship to 21 st-century warfare through {{an exploration of}} suburban defensive architecture, military technologies and camouflage design. This practice-based research utilises the photographic image alongside sculptural installation to explore notions of dread <b>and</b> anxiety <b>stirred</b> up <b>in</b> <b>the</b> modern day Australian. Influenced by contemporary art practice and critical theory surrounding paranoia, globalisation and fear, this research outlines the development of specific visual reactions to a land physically distanced from war. <b>In</b> research, <b>the</b> effects of globalisation on the Australian individual are discussed, where the rapid flow of information and subsequent proliferation of fear are brought forth to understand this uniquely distanced experience of conflict. Drawing on what theorist Paul Virilio has termed, 'The Administration of Fear', the project explores fear as a global environment, where the impacts of conflict are not exclusively linked with the physical experience of them. In this context, geographical distance becomes a naive form of safety from war in a world becoming smaller. This theoretical framework gives way to {{an exploration of the}} photographic methodologies used to capture the trace of trauma and conflict, what theorist David Campany has deemed 'Late Photography'. Focusing the camera's lens on sites throughout the suburban Sydney landscape, the project documents locations where individual anxieties have materialised through makeshift architectural decisions. This observed militarism <b>in</b> <b>the</b> suburbs opens up a dialogue about the future of warfare and the impacts of using new technologies on the battlefield, namely the unmanned military combat drone (UAV). The research Presupposes that the use of this highly contentious weapon of war has become metaphorical of the fears and resulting methods the collective west employs when conducting war beyond its borders. In reaction, a new 'speculative' camouflage has been designed to combat, albeit naively, the invasive surveillance capabilities of <b>the</b> drone. <b>In</b> exhibition, Defence Mechanisms contrasts the aesthetics and paraphernalia of warfare with domestic sites of residential conflict. An attempt to survey both real and imagined mechanisms put in place to resist external threats. Photographic and sculptural works become artefacts and omens of dread in a land relatively free from the perils of war...|$|R
