500|$|Recording a {{new album}} was, {{according}} to Robert, a [...] "natural progression" [...] after the band began playing together again. [...] "The thing that kind of introduces us back together is all those memories of the songs, and once you start playing those songs... it always takes us back to... 18 years now. It can {{take us back to}} our past and think <b>about</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> were when we were writing these songs, and that's a bond, I think, [...] will always keep us together as four people.... It just progressed into, 'Maybe it's time to make a new record.|$|E
500|$|Genesis were {{targets for}} {{criticism}} throughout the 1970s {{from those who}} disliked progressive rock. Influential BBC DJ John Peel championed the band in their early years and they performed three sessions for him between 1970 and 1972, but he [...] "grew disillusioned with their later excesses". Some regarded the group as overtly middle class, paying {{particular attention to the}} founder members' private education, and claimed rock music was being taken away from the working class, whom they regarded as its core audience. Likening his background to that of the punk artist Joe Strummer, who had become a [...] "people's hero" [...] musician, Gabriel stated in 2013, [...] "To this day, we've never outgrown the snotty rich-kid thing ... we were always very straight <b>about</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> came from, and we were middle-class, not aristocratic". Gabriel's theatrics were unpalatable to some of the mainstream rock audience, resulting in a cult following rather than that of a mainstream rock band.|$|E
500|$|In a February 2009 {{interview}} with Jalylah Burrell of Vibe magazine, Gil Scott-Heron discussed the album's concept and title, {{as well as}} the social and political atmosphere at the time of Winter in Americas recording. In retrospect, he stated [...] "We felt as though we had come across something that people did not understand or did not recognize but that's the season that we were going into, not for three months but {{for an extended period of}} time. A lot of the folks who represented summer and spring and fall had been killed and assassinated. The only season left is winter. ...Bobby Kennedy and Dr. King and John Kennedy, those were folks who represented spring and summer, and they killed them. So we wanted to do an album <b>about</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> were. And we weren't trying to depress people, hell, they were living it, they already knew but we were trying to describe it and were certainly not alone... we felt as though a part of it was the folks in charge of the political structure. They were snowmen..." ...|$|E

2500|$|The band {{have often}} been {{compared}} to Sonic Youth, and they were once described as [...] "The Sonic Youth of the Southern Hemisphere", with Trouser Press describing their early sound as [...] "hard, droning, unforgiving guitar music with occasional lapses into verse/chorus regularity". By Tanker their sound had become more conventional. With their relocation to New York, their sound also shifted, with the band's next releases described as [...] "an unholy collision between The Beatles harmonies and The Velvet Underground dissonance", with Parker stating {{at the time that}} the band were getting into [...] "the harmonic value of distortion; we started to be very particular <b>about</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> set the instruments up and the angles the sounds were bouncing at. From these harmonic experiments I became more interested in the actual melodic content of the music". Pitchfork Media described them in 1999 as [...] "a huge mess of sound that's simultaneously beautiful, jagged, atonal, and supremely melodic", while another review in the same year described their sound as [...] "one part Superchunk, one part Pixies, and one part Dinosaur Jr." ...|$|E
2500|$|I met Henry James {{the other}} night at Emerson's, at an Alcottian conversation, at which, however, Alcott did not talk much, being {{disturbed}} by James's opposition. [...] The latter is a hearty man enough, with whom you can differ very satisfactorily, both {{on account of his}} doctrines and his good temper. [...] He utters quasi-philanthropic dogmas in a metaphysic dress; but they are, for all practical purposes, very crude. [...] He charges society with all the crime committed, and praises the criminal for committing it. [...] But I think that all the remedies he suggests out of his head—for he goes no farther, hearty as he is—would leave us <b>about</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> are now. [...] For, of course, it is not by a gift of turkeys on Thanksgiving Day that he proposes to convert the criminal, but by a true sympathy with each one,—with him, among the rest, who lying tells the world from the gallows that he has never been treated kindly by a single mortal since he was born. [...] But it is not so easy a thing to sympathize with another, though you may have the best disposition to do it. [...] There is Dobson over the hill. [...] Have not you and I and all the world been trying to sympathize with him since he was born (as doubtless he with us), and yet we have got no further than to send him to the House of Correction once at least; and he, on the other hand, has sent us to another place several times. [...] This is the real state of things as I understand it, at least so far as James's remedies. [...] We are now, alas! exercising what charity we actually have, and new laws would not give us any more. [...] But perchance, we might make some improvements in the House of Correction. [...] You and I are Dobson; what will James do for us?.|$|E

5000|$|Parmar is {{a critic}} of British {{technology}} education. She states: [...] "The education system should be the place <b>where</b> <b>we</b> convert childhood experiences with technology into an understanding <b>about</b> computing, <b>where</b> <b>we</b> {{lay the groundwork for}} a child to push on into adulthood with not only an interest in tech, but also the skills to start competing in the industry. As it is, however, we are failing our youngsters.”.|$|R
40|$|A {{maternal}} {{thinking is}} the one which gives us the possibility of acting and conceiving at the same time; it is a double conception produced within thinking and matter, because where love germinates {{there is no difference}} between matter and what, like a mirror, gives us an account of it. When being, loving and thinking are different things, <b>we</b> talk <b>about</b> justice <b>where</b> <b>we</b> should talk <b>about</b> humanity, and <b>we</b> talk <b>about</b> tolerance <b>where</b> <b>we</b> should talk <b>about</b> respect. At the same time, we educate our children in the exercise of their own and of distributive ethics. When we consider that love and thought are two different things {{it is not difficult to}} believe that wars, occupations, rapes, and all kind of attacks on the freedom of all of us have some kind of legitimacy. However, is it possible to dissociate ethical behaviour from love?</span...|$|R

25|$|It was {{probably}} this work which contained a story <b>about</b> souls, <b>where</b> <b>we</b> {{are told that}} there were once spirits {{who lived in a}} state of bliss, but having committed a crime (the nature of which is unknown) they were punished by being forced to become mortal beings, reincarnated from body to body.

60|$|She was so very large, {{that she}} carried us all very, very easily, {{and would have}} carried two or three tons of baggage with us; so that we began to consult about going to sea {{directly}} to Goa; but many other considerations checked that thought, especially {{when we came to}} look nearer into it; such as want of provisions, and no casks for fresh water; no compass to steer by; no shelter from the breach of the high sea, which would certainly founder us; no defence from the heat of the weather, and the like; so that they all came readily into my project, to cruise <b>about</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> were, and see what might offer.|$|E
60|$|We went over--if I {{remember}} correctly--a stone fence. But I have {{no doubts}} of recollection <b>about</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> found ourselves.

So did the train-crew, for when we emerged from the graveyard and plunged across a road into a dark wood, the shacks gave up the pursuit and went back to their train. A little later that night the gay-cat and I found ourselves at the well of a farmhouse. We were after a drink of water, but we noticed a small rope that ran down one side of the well. We hauled it up and found on the end of it a gallon-can of cream. And that is as near as I got to the quarries of Rutland, Vermont.|$|E

So there we stayed with them six months, and {{observed}} their manners, which were none, and their customs, which were disgusting, as the midshipman said in his diary; and had the honour of visiting a pleasant little place in No-man's Land, called Khiva, which you may find in your atlas, Mary; and of very nearly being sold for slaves into Persia, which would not have been pleasant; and at last, Mary, we ran away--or rather, rode away, on two razor-backed Calmuc ponies, and got back to Russia, viâ Orenberg,--for which consult your atlas again; so the young prince was restored to the bosom of his afflicted family; and a good deal of trouble I had to get him safe there, for the poor boy's health gave way.
