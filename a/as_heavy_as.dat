5|$|Built to Brigham Young's design, the handcarts {{resembled a}} large wheelbarrow, with two wheels five feet (1.5m) in {{diameter}} and a single axle {{four and a half}} feet (1.4m) wide, and weighing 60 pounds (27kg). Running along each side of the bed were seven-foot (2.1 m) pull shafts ending with a three-foot (0.9m) crossbar at the front. The crossbar allowed the carts to be pushed or pulled. Cargo was carried in a box about three feet by four feet (0.9m by 1.2m), with 8inch (0.2m) walls. The handcarts generally carried up to 250 pounds (110kg) of supplies and luggage, though they were capable of handling loads <b>as</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>as</b> 500 pounds (230kg). Carts used in the first year's migration were made entirely of wood ("Iowa hickory or oak"); in later years a stronger design was substituted, which included metal elements.|$|E
5|$|South Slavic legends about Kraljević Marko or Krali Marko are {{primarily}} based on myths {{much older than}} the historical Marko Mrnjavčević. He differs in legend from the folk poems; in some areas he was imagined as a giant who walked stepping on hilltops, his head touching the clouds. He {{was said to have}} helped God shape the earth, and created the river gorge in Demir Kapija ("Iron Gate") with a stroke of his sabre. This drained the sea covering the regions of Bitola, Mariovo and Tikveš in Macedonia, making them habitable. After the earth was shaped, Marko arrogantly showed off his strength. God took it away by leaving a bag <b>as</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>as</b> the earth on a road; when Marko tried to lift it, he lost his strength and became an ordinary man.|$|E
5|$|The {{breeding}} of farm animals seldom occurs spontaneously but is managed by farmers {{with a view}} to encouraging certain traits that are seen as desirable. These include hardiness, prolificness, mothering abilities, fast growth rates, low feed consumption per unit of growth, better body proportions, higher yields, better fibre qualities and other characteristics. Undesirable traits such as health defects, aggressiveness or lack of docility are selected against. Selective breeding has been responsible for some large increases in productivity. In 2007, a typical broiler chicken at eight weeks old was 4.8 times <b>as</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>as</b> a bird of similar age in 1957. In the thirty years to 2007, the average milk yield of a dairy cow in the United States nearly doubled.|$|E

5|$|The {{common toad}} reaches {{maturity}} at three {{to seven years}} old but there is great variability between populations. Juveniles are often parasitised by the lung nematode Rhabdias bufonis. This slows growth rates and reduces stamina and fitness. Larger juveniles at metamorphosis always outgrow smaller ones that have been reared in more crowded ponds. Even when they have heavy worm burdens, large juveniles grow faster than smaller individuals with light worm burdens. After several months of heavy worm infection, some juveniles in a study were only half <b>as</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>as</b> control juveniles. Their parasite-induced anorexia caused a decrease in food intake and some died. Another study investigated whether the use of nitrogenous fertilisers affects the development of common toad tadpoles. The toadlets were kept in very dilute solutions of ammonium nitrate of various strengths. It was found that at certain concentrations, which were well above any normally found in the field, growth was increased and metamorphosis accelerated, but at others, {{there was no significant}} difference between the experimental tadpoles and controls. Nevertheless, certain unusual swimming patterns and a few deformities were found among the experimental animals.|$|E

50|$|Polyandrous mating is {{positively}} correlated with testicle-to-body weight across bushcricket taxa (see Sperm competition).

The bonobo chimpanzee species (Pan paniscus) has heavier testicles than the common chimpanzee species (Pan troglodytes). It is yet unclear whether the rule is as applicable within species as it is across species—that is, whether it is applicable across races—but {{according to a study by}} J.

In the same interferometer they also found interference fringes for C60F48., a fluorinated buckyball with a mass of about 1600 u, composed of 108 atoms. Large molecules are already so complex that they give experimental access to {{some aspects of the}} quantum-classical interface, i.e., to certain decoherence mechanisms. In 2011, the interference of molecules <b>as</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>as</b> 6910u could be demonstrated in a Kapitza–Dirac–Talbot–Lau interferometer.

25|$|With {{the close}} of the Palaeozoic, most of the Permian groups disappeared, with the {{exception}} of the Mastodonsauroid and Metoposaurid families and the curious Plagiosauridae, who continued into the Triassic. In the early Triassic these families enjoyed a brief renaissance in the waterways of continental shallows, with large forms like Thoosuchus, Benthosuchus and Eryosuchus. Their ecological niches were probably similar to those of modern-day crocodiles, as fish hunters and riverside carnivores. All groups developed progressively weaker vertebrae, reduced limb ossification and flatter skulls with prominent lateral line organs, indicating the late Permian/early Triassic temnospondyls rarely if ever left the water. An extremely large Brachyopid (likely a plagiosaur or a close relative) is estimated to have been 7 meters long, and probably just <b>as</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>as</b> the Permian Prionosuchus.|$|E
25|$|Heavy {{water is}} not radioactive. In its pure form, {{it has a}} density about 11% greater than water, but is {{otherwise}} physically and chemically similar. Nevertheless, the various differences in deuterium-containing water (especially affecting the biological properties) are larger {{than in any other}} commonly occurring isotope-substituted compound because deuterium is unique among heavy stable isotopes in being twice <b>as</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>as</b> the lightest isotope. This difference increases the strength of water's hydrogen-oxygen bonds, and this in turn is enough to cause differences that are important to some biochemical reactions. The human body naturally contains deuterium equivalent to about five grams of heavy water, which is harmless. When a large fraction of water (> 50%) in higher organisms is replaced by heavy water, the result is cell dysfunction and death.|$|E

25|$|The {{southern}} {{elephant seal}} (Mirounga leonina) {{is one of the}} two species of elephant seals. It is both the largest living pinniped and member of the order Carnivora, as well as the largest marine mammal after the cetaceans. It gets its name from its great size and the large proboscis of the adult male, which is used to make extraordinarily loud roaring noises, especially during the mating season. About 40 percent heavier than the male northern elephant seal (Mirounga angustirostris) and more than twice <b>as</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>as</b> the male walrus (Odobenus rosmarus), the bull {{southern elephant seal}} is without rival the largest carnivoran alive. An average adult male southern elephant seal weighs six to seven times more than the largest terrestrial carnivorans, the polar bear (Ursus maritimus) and Kodiak bear (Ursus arctos middendorffi). Additionally, it rivals the extinct giant walrus Pontolis, whose estimated weight in life was similar, as the largest carnivoran ever known.|$|E
25|$|Following World War II, Sonic founder Troy N. Smith Sr. {{returned}} to his hometown of Seminole, Oklahoma, where he became employed as a milkman. He decided to work delivering bread because bread was not <b>as</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>as</b> milk. Soon afterwards, Smith purchased the Cottage Cafe, a little diner in Shawnee, Oklahoma. Before long, he sold it and opened a fast food restaurant, Troy's Pan Full of Chicken, {{on the edge of}} town. In 1953, Smith went in with a business partner to purchase a five-acre parcel of land that had a log house and a walk-up root beer stand, already named the Top Hat. The two men continued with the operation of the root beer stand and converted the log house into a steak restaurant. After realizing that the stand was averaging $700 a week in the sale of root beer, hamburgers, and hot dogs, Smith decided to focus on the more-profitable root beer stand. He also bought out his business partner.|$|E
25|$|Though {{all these}} writers appear to regard these objects {{as a kind}} of battle-axe (and are {{probably}} correct so far as those having a ray prolonged into a hatchet are concerned), there are several considerations that suggest these objects were habitually used as weapons. The larger of the stars (which are <b>as</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>as</b> a pound and a quarter) no doubt might be used effectively; but the smaller ones, weighing only a few ounces, would not be very formidable; and taking them as a whole they are less adapted either for offensive or defensive purposes than most of the other stone implements. To this may be added that many are uninjured, and do not seem to have been put to any use whatever. Francisco Campaña (a half-Indian who joined the latter part of Whymper's journey) had assisted in the examination of graves in Peru, and said these stars in stone were found there placed upon the breasts of corpses; and it seems likely that they were to the Children of the Sun symbols of the luminary that they worshipped.|$|E
