40|$|ObjectiveCurrently, {{there are}} no data on the caliber and length of the urethra in Taiwanese adult females. The {{aim of this study}} was to {{determine}} the caliber and length of the urethra, and to evaluate their correlations with <b>age,</b> <b>body</b> height, body weight and body mass index (BMI) in asymptomatic Taiwanese adult females. Materials and MethodsTwenty-three women with a mean age of 63. 2 years (range, 41 - 82 years) were studied. All study subjects claimed to have no difficulty in voiding. Measurements were taken just prior to the scheduled cystoscopy under local anesthesia. We used a bougie à boule to measure the caliber of the urethra, and used a scaled cystoscope sheath to determine the length of the urethra. Correlations of urethral length and caliber with <b>age,</b> <b>body</b> height, body weight and BMI were analyzed using Spearman correlation. ResultsThe mean <b>age,</b> <b>body</b> height and weight were 63. 2 ± 12. 4 years, 154. 1 ± 8. 3 cm and 54. 3 ± 8. 1 kg, respectively. The mean adult female urethra was 3. 7 ± 0. 7 cm long and 7. 5 ± 0. 6 mm (i. e., 23. 7 ± 1. 9 French) in diameter. There were no statistically significant correlations of urethral length and caliber with <b>age,</b> <b>body</b> height, body weight and BMI (all p > 0. 05). ConclusionThere was no correlation of urethral length and urethral caliber with <b>age,</b> <b>body</b> height, body weight and BMI in asymptomatic adult women. This study provides valuable normal data as the reference for clinical evaluation of voiding dysfunction, and defines urethral stricture and reconstructive surgery of the urethra in females...|$|R

Coronary vascular resistance was negatively correlated with <b>age,</b> <b>body</b> surface area, and left ventricular mass. Younger children require a much greater coronary blood flow per left ventricular mass and have a higher coronary vascular resistance than older children and adolescents.

40|$|Discourses on {{old age and}} ageing are {{framed in}} narrow and binary ways, either as a decline {{narrative}} or through discourses of positive and successful ageing. The decline narrative, on the one hand, is highly centred on {{the decline of the}} <b>ageing</b> <b>body</b> as frail, leaky and unbounded, and on how old age is characterised by non-productivity, increasing passivity and dependency. Discourses on successful ageing, on the other hand, rely heavily on neo-liberal imperatives of activity, autonomy and responsibility. In successful ageing, the specificities of <b>ageing</b> <b>bodies</b> are largely overlooked while the capacity of the old person to retain a youthful body, for example, with the aid of sexuopharmaceuticals, is celebrated. This article argues for the need of a theorising of old age that goes beyond the binaries of decline and success. Drawing on the work of feminist corpomaterialists Rosi Braidotti and Elisabeth Grosz, the article proposes affirmative old age as an alternative conceptualisation of old age. As a theoretical project, affirmative old age aims to acknowledge the material specificities of the <b>ageing</b> <b>body</b> and is an attempt to theorise the <b>ageing</b> <b>body</b> in terms of difference but without understanding it as a body marked by decline, lack or negation...|$|R

About one third of the most severe hyperkyphosis cases in older people have vertebral fractures. Otherwise, the <b>aging</b> <b>body</b> does tend towards a loss of musculoskeletal integrity, and hyperkyphosis can develop due to aging alone.|$|E

Hannah Wilke also used photography as her way of expressing a non-traditional representation of the female body. In her collection called S.O.S- Stratification Object Series in 1974, Wilke used herself as the subject topless with various pieces of chewed gum in the shape of vulvas arranged throughout her body as a way of metaphorically demonstrating how women in society are chewed up and then spit out without a second thought.|$|E

5000|$|Rowles uses {{mixed media}} to {{investigate}} the material substance {{and structure of the}} human body. Her major series of work include Re-constructions (2014- [...] ); Contortions (2004-13); Hyperplasia (1989-98); and Vests (1982-). Prior to 2000, Rowles’s work dealt with the social and emotional associations of clothing. For Vests, she created soft, suspended sculptures from a variety of materials, such as vinyl, rubber, plastic toys, zippers, and chenille wire, which playfully critique gender norms. With the Contortion series, Rowles turned to the structure of the body itself, crocheting forms suggestive of osteoporotic bones and digestive tracks. Specifically invoking the <b>aging</b> <b>body,</b> the sculptures were inspired by the artist’s experience of caring for her elderly mother. For Re-Constructions, Rowles created suspended sculptures out of molded layers of sheer fabric, to which she added wire mesh, crepe hair, rubber, bone, and silkscreened imagery. The visceral, skin-like quality of this work is reminiscent of Louise Bourgeois’s sculptures of the 1960s.|$|E
