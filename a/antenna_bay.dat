5000|$|... #Caption: A typical Rural Radio Network {{transmitter}} site. In 2001 {{when this}} {{photo of the}} Bristol Center facility was taken, a steel pole with four side-mounted <b>antenna</b> <b>bays</b> had long since replaced the original 1948 RCA Pylon atop the tower. The porch {{on the right side}} of the building formerly supported relay antennas to receive programming from Ithaca and Wethersfield.|$|R
50|$|Panel antennas {{are common}} at Ultra high {{frequency}} (UHF) frequencies, {{where they are}} often used for cellular/mobile base stations or wireless networking due to their size and directional properties. At VHF frequencies, such an antenna would be impractically large for most receiving applications unless implemented as {{no more than a}} two-bay design. Some full-power radio stations do use multiple panel <b>antenna</b> <b>bays,</b> installed one above the other {{on the side of a}} tall antenna tower, to provide a directional transmitter pattern on these frequencies.|$|R
5000|$|In April 1992, KSYM {{installed}} a new eight <b>bay</b> <b>antenna</b> that boosted its effective power to 3000 watts.05/03/03 11 ...|$|R
50|$|The station began {{operation}} in January 1974, broadcasting at 10 watts of {{power on the}} frequency of 90.1 FM. In 1982, Lincoln College (originally chartered as Lincoln University and listed on WLNX's broadcast license as such), received permission from the FCC to increase its output power to 225 watts. Because of adjacent stations {{in the area and}} the potential overlap in signals/coverage areas, the station switched frequencies to 88.9 FM. The station originally was located in the basement of University Hall, a building listed in the National Register of Historic Places (ground for the building was broken on Abraham Lincoln's last living birthday). The broadcast <b>antenna</b> <b>bays</b> are mounted to {{the eastern side of the}} bell tower that sits atop the building. On June 11, 2006, the WLNX facility narrowly survived a fire that damaged portions of two floors of the historic building.|$|R
50|$|George Volger {{wanted to}} add a second radio station using new {{technology}} known as FM, or frequency modulation. Although FM broadcasts {{at a very high}} frequency (VHF) and has limited range, advantages include a static free signal and broadcasting in stereo. It also meant a radio station that could broadcast at full power 24 hours a day. “KWPC-FM” went on the air in 1949. Additional space was added {{to the back of the}} old farm house for the transmitter and the FM <b>antenna</b> <b>bays</b> were mounted at the top of the existing broadcast tower behind the building. Like most FM stations of the 1950’ and 60’s KWPC-FM played “easy listening” music. To provide independent identity for the “FM” station the call letters were eventually changed to KFMH during the 1970s. The slogan at the time was… “FM is our middle name”! George Volger was a highly respected member of the broadcast community and served several terms on the Board of Directors of the National Association of Broadcasters (NAB) which represents broadcasters on a national scale.|$|R
40|$|An {{extension}} boom is to {{be installed}} on the starboard side of the Space Shuttle Orbiter (SSO) payload bay for thermal tile inspection and repairing. As a result, the Space Shuttle payload bay Ultra High Frequency (UHF) antenna will be under the boom. This study is to evaluate the Space Shuttle UHF communication performance for antenna at a suitable new location. To insure the RF coverage performance at proposed new locations, the link margin between the UHF payload <b>bay</b> <b>antenna</b> and Extravehicular Activity (EVA) Astronauts at a range distance of 160 meters from the payload <b>bay</b> <b>antenna</b> was analyzed. The communication performance between Space Shuttle Orbiter and International Space Station (SSO-ISS) during rendezvous was also investigated. The multipath effects from payload bay structures surrounding the payload <b>bay</b> <b>antenna</b> were analyzed. The computer simulation tool based on the Geometrical Theory of Diffraction method (GTD) was used to compute the signal strengths. The total field strength was obtained by summing the direct fields from the antennas and the reflected and diffracted fields from the surrounding structures. The computed signal strengths were compared to the signal strength corresponding to the 0 dB link margin. Based on the results obtained in this study, RF coverage for SSO-EVA and SSO- ISS communication links was determined for the proposed payload <b>bay</b> <b>antenna</b> UHF locations. The RF radiation to the Orbiter Docking System (ODS) pyros, the payload bay avionics, and the Shuttle Remote Manipulator System (SRMS) from the new proposed UHF antenna location was also investigated to ensure the EMC/EMI compliances...|$|R
5000|$|By 2005, DYMK {{became the}} strongest FM station in Iloilo and Western Visayas with a {{transmitter}} at Guimaras {{and power of}} 30,000 watts (ERP: 60,000 watts), with a brand new program line-up. The new FM transmitter has 12 <b>bay</b> <b>antenna</b> reaching as far as Kalibo (except in Boracay due to a new radio station called 93.5 Easy Rock Boracay) and beyond Visayas.|$|R
5000|$|WJOH is a {{non-commercial}} Contemporary Christian FM {{radio station}} {{which is part}} of the Smile FM radio network. In July 2006, it began broadcasting from Raco just west of Sault Sainte Marie, Michigan. WJOH operates from a 328' tower with 5.5 kW with a non-directional 4 <b>bay</b> <b>antenna</b> made by Ed Czelada, founder of Smile FM, from 1½" [...] copper pipe. All programming originates at WLGH in Lansing, Michigan.|$|R
5000|$|KTXT-TV {{signed on}} from a {{converted}} building (the former Agriculture Pavilion) and a 452-foot tower {{located at the}} new studios. The station installed a six <b>bay</b> RCA <b>antenna,</b> used dual 1 5/8" [...] feed lines, and a 500 watt RCA TT-500BL transmitter for an ERP of about 2,500 watts visual. In 1966 a grant bought the station a TT-6EL transmitter which raised power to 25,700 watts. In 1982-83 the station received a donated 817 foot tower (former KAMR-TV Amarillo tower) and 12 <b>bay</b> <b>antenna.</b> This allowed the station to raise power to 60,600 visual. A Harris transmitter was installed in 1984 and the station converted to BTSC (stereo TV audio) operation.|$|R
50|$|The station {{originally}} broadcast with 30 kW from a tower near Gladwin. A {{construction permit}} to increase power to 80 kW was granted in 2004. In December 2006 the station {{applied for a}} modification of its construction permit to move the station to Auburn, Michigan and operate with 55 kW from a 374-foot tower. On August 2, 2007, the modification was approved and the station began immediately the relocation to the new tower. On August 31, 2007 they began broadcasting from the new six <b>bay</b> <b>antenna</b> with 2 kW. On October 24, 2007 the station put the new transmitter on line. The site provides a strong signal in the Midland, Bay City and Saginaw areas.|$|R
50|$|WVVA's {{transmitter}} site is unique because the TV transmitter building {{is in the}} state of Virginia, but the TV tower and antenna are in West Virginia. This was a problem in 1977 when the management of the station wished to begin operations at 100 kW. In accordance with FCC rules FM radio stations in West Virginia may not have an Effective Radiated Power greater than 50 kW. This problem was solved by constructing a new tower 80 feet to the east-southeast of the TV tower. This tower was in Virginia, enabling 100 kW operation. A Harris FM-20K transmitter and ERI 12 <b>Bay</b> <b>antenna</b> was installed and 100 kW operation began in 1977.|$|R
5000|$|The WMBD {{stations}} {{were sold to}} Midwest Television Incorporated of Champaign (owner of fellow CBS affiliate WCIA) in 1960 for $1.85 million. In addition to sharing resources with WCIA, WMBD has also carried some original programming from the former. In the early-1960s, WMBD was the first Peoria station to broadcast color television. Along with WEEK-TV, it maintained a repeater, W71AE channel 71, in LaSalle in the 1960s and 1970s in order to expand its signal reach. The broadcast license for this low-powered outlet was granted on [...] A picture of W71AE's 485 ft Rohn tower and its sixteen <b>bay</b> <b>antenna</b> is shown in a Rohn advertisement in the [...] issue of Broadcasting.|$|R
50|$|AMCA's second design {{proposal}} was first showcased at Aero India 2009. The previous proposal which was shown {{as a part}} of Multidisciplinary design optimization (MDO) included cantilever wings with a V-shaped twin tail and a medium-sized tail-wing with serpentine air intake and blended large leading-edge root extension (LERX), total length was 13.9 m and wing span of 10.8 m with empty weight of around 12 tonnes, with overall nose on low observability design. The previous design boosted design-based stealth features which were further optimized by the use of airframe shaping, composite material, edge matching fuselage, RAPs, body conforming <b>antennae</b> and engine <b>bay</b> cooling, RAMs, weapons bay, special coatings for poly-carbonate canopy and other stealth features, the aircraft had a weight of 16-18 tonnes with 2-tonnes of internal weapons and four-tonnes of internal fuel with a combat ceiling of 15-km, max speed of 1.8-Mach at 11-km. The second {{proposal was}} designated with the designation of 3B-01.|$|R
