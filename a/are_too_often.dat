500|$|In 1986, Signithia Fordham co-authored with Nigerian {{sociologist}} John Ogbu a {{study that}} concluded that high-performing African-American students in a Washington, D.C., high school borrowed from hegemonic white culture {{as part of a}} strategy for achievement, while struggling to maintain a black identity. Ogbu made a related claim in his 2003 book, Black American Students in an Affluent Suburb: A Study of Academic Disengagement, concluding that black students' own cultural attitudes sometimes hindered academic achievement and that these attitudes <b>are</b> <b>too</b> <b>often</b> neglected. Ogbu had earlier written in his seminal work Minority Education and Caste (1978), that school disengagement among caste-like minorities occurs because white society limits the job-success of their parents and others in their communities by a glass ceiling. In his new book, he said that non-whites [...] "failed to observe the link between educational achievement and access to jobs." ...|$|E
500|$|Many reviewers criticised the {{repetition}} of the game's levels. Francesco Serino (Eurogamer) criticised the variation between levels and said it wasn't too long before he was seeing similar levels because of the game's simplicity. He said that the levels are usually well made but <b>are</b> <b>too</b> <b>often</b> made for certain characters, which adds more gameplay {{because of the time}} it takes to discover the best strategies to complete a level. Alex Navarro (Giant Bomb) liked the overall gameplay of Monaco but disliked some of the later levels as they turned into [...] "tedious exercises in trial-and-error". Ben Allan (Gameplanet) said the single-player mode was less fun due to there being fewer variations and less chaos. Anton Bjurvald said that he fell in love with the simplicity of the graphics and liked the majority of the gameplay but said that it seemed like the game's artificial intelligence was made too easy to be fooled.|$|E
2500|$|In The New York Times, Arthur Caplan, {{professor}} of bioethics at the University of Pennsylvania, felt that medical dramas such as Kelley's Chicago Hope {{do a good}} job of addressing bioethical issues such as who should receive a liver transplant or when should a patient be allowed to die. However, there is a lack of discussion concerning the primary money issue: [...] "How do people pay for this?" [...] The show has been criticized for presenting a one-sided view of managed care, portraying HMOs as dramatically evil while glossing over the complexities. Doctors <b>are</b> <b>too</b> <b>often</b> shown as selfless patient advocates ready to battle whatever the financial cost.|$|E

2500|$|On October 29, 2009, Richard Fadden {{the head}} of CSIS stated that civil-rights advocates and media present a {{distorted}} picture of, [...] "terror suspects <b>are</b> <b>too</b> <b>often</b> portrayed as romantic revolutionaries". He was referring to Abdelrazik {{and a few other}} accused suspects. He went on to state,"So why then, I ask, are those accused of terrorist offences often portrayed in media as quasi-folk heroes despite the harsh statements of numerous judges. Why are they always photographed with their children, giving tender-hearted profiles and more or less taken at their word when they accuse CSIS or other government agencies of abusing them?...A more balanced presentation is what I'm hoping for." ...|$|E
2500|$|Some {{fundamentalist}} critics believe GCE might undermine {{religious education}} and promote secular values. Others {{are concerned that}} the pedagogical approach of most global citizenship education curricula <b>are</b> <b>too</b> <b>often</b> produced in particular Northern, Western contexts. Some critics claim that GCE curricula promote values that are too individualistic. Dill, for example, claims that [...] "the majority of the world experiences social and communal life not in terms of isolated individuals, but as collective identities and traditions. For many of these groups, the dominant forms of global citizenship education and its moral order will be experienced as coercive and unjust', so 'global' citizenship curriculum should be seen as a local practice, [...] "which diverse cultures will conceptualize and construct differently".|$|E
2500|$|Federalist No. 10 {{continues}} a theme {{begun in}} Federalist No. 9; It is titled, [...] "The Utility of the Union as a Safeguard Against Domestic Faction and Insurrection." [...] The whole series is cited by scholars and jurists as an authoritative interpretation and explication {{of the meaning}} of the Constitution. Jurists have frequently read No. 10 to mean that the Founding Fathers did not intend the United States government to be partisan and others have argued that given Madison's clear understanding that partisanship is inevitable, he suggests that a representative republic form of government is more effective against factions than a direct democracy. [...] Thus, Madison saw the Constitution as forming a [...] "happy combination" [...] of a republic and a democracy and with [...] "the great and aggregate interests being referred to the national, the local and particular to the State legislatures" [...] the power would not be centralized {{in a way that would}} make it [...] "more difficult for unworthy candidates to practice the vicious arts by which elections <b>are</b> <b>too</b> <b>often</b> carried." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{his review}} for Sight & Sound magazine, Jonathan Rosenbaum wrote, [...] "Perhaps {{the major problem}} is that despite Cage and Dern's best efforts, Lynch is {{ultimately}} interested only in iconography, not characters at all. When it comes to images of evil, corruption, derangement, raw passion and mutilation (roughly in that order), Wild at Heart is a veritable cornucopia". Richard Combs in his review for Time wrote, [...] "The result is a pile-up, of innocence, of evil, even of actual road accidents, without a context to give significance to the casualties or survivors". Christopher Sharrett in Cineaste magazine wrote, [...] "Lynch's characters are now so cartoony one is prone to address him more as a theorist than director, except he is not that challenging ... One is never sure what Lynch likes or dislikes, and his often striking images <b>are</b> <b>too</b> <b>often</b> lacking in compassion for us to accept him as a chronicler of a moribund landscape a la Fellini". However, Peter Travers wrote in Rolling Stone magazine, [...] "Starting with the outrageous and building from there, he ignites a slight love-on-the-run novel, creating a bonfire of a movie that confirms his reputation as the most exciting and innovative filmmaker of his generation".|$|E
2500|$|In 2012, Takei {{starred in}} the musical Allegiance, which Takei {{described}} as his legacy project. The show is based on Takei's own experiences and research into the Japanese American internment of World War II and premiered at the Old Globe Theatre in Balboa Park in San Diego, California. Allegiance debuted on Broadway on November 8, 2015, to mixed reviews. The Guardian said it was [...] "unexceptional though often affecting"; Deadline called it [...] "a triumph of a rare sort, shedding light in a dark corner of our history with uncommon generosity of spirit." [...] The New York Times praised the [...] "well-intentioned and polished" [...] play for tackling a difficult subject while trying {{at the same time}} to entertain its audience, but said Allegiance [...] "struggles to balance both ambitions, and doesn't always find an equilibrium." [...] The Associated Press said Allegiance tries to tackle internment camps, discrimination and war, [...] "but does so unsuccessfully in a bombastic and generic Broadway musical." [...] Variety wrote, [...] "In their sincere efforts to 'humanize' their complex historical material, the creatives have oversimplified and reduced it to generic themes." [...] The Hollywood Reporter said [...] "the powerful sentiments involved <b>are</b> <b>too</b> <b>often</b> flattened by the pedestrian lyrics and unmemorable melodies of Jay Kuo's score". USA Today called Allegiance [...] "as corny as Kansas in August and as obvious as Lady Gaga on a red carpet. But darned if it won't get a grip on your heartstrings." ...|$|E

50|$|During {{investigations}} of USDA policies and operations, the USDA's Secretary of Agriculture {{reported that the}} process for resolving discrimination complaints had failed.

In response, in 1998, Congress tolled the statute of limitations for USDA discrimination complaints, which allowed the Pigford class to bring this suit.|$|R
