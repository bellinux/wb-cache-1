40|$|International audienceThe {{necessity}} for a careful {{monitoring of the}} endangered ozone layer {{was considered to be}} of prime importance after the discovery of the <b>Antarctic</b> <b>hole</b> in the early 1980 s. To that aim, a ground-based global network was established in 1991 in order to monitor not just the ozone but also the chemical and physical parameters that influence the ozone budget. The Network for the Detection of Stratospheric Changes (NDSC) relied oil the worldwide measurement stations equipped with multiple instruments for the parallel monitoring of a variety of atmospheric parameters involved in the ozone depletion issue. In recent years, new developments in the measurement techniques broadened the scope of the network to the monitoring of atmospheric composition in the free and upper troposphere. The name of the network was changed to Network for the Detection of Atmospheric Composition Changes (NDACC) in order to reflect these new priorities. At present, the NDACC includes more than 70 research stations throughout the world, equipped with active and passive remote sensing instruments to monitor the atmospheric composition and its link to climate change. This chapter provides an overview of the network implementation and operation, with particular emphasis oil data quality issues. It includes examples of recent results on the long-term evolution of atmospheric parameters relevant to ozone depletion and describes the new development in the network-observing capabilities...|$|E

40|$|The {{hypothesis}} that, {{once the}} <b>Antarctic</b> ozone <b>hole</b> is photochemically {{generated in the}} spring, the ozone deficit remains in the stratosphere throughout the year was investigated using a three-dimensional chemical transport model (CTM) for the stratosphere with linearized ozone chemistry. An <b>Antarctic</b> ozone <b>hole</b> was imposed {{on the basis of}} observations, and the dynamical dilution of the ozone-depleted air was followed for the next 12 months. The CTM calculations show that the transport of ozone-poor air from the Antarctic vortex results in measurable decreases to column ozone, extending to 30 deg S during the austral summer. By the end of the year, about 70 percent of the initially prescribed ozone deficit is replenished through stratospheric chemistry...|$|R
40|$|The new Ozone Mapping and Profiler Suite (OMPS) {{launched}} on the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership satellite in October 2011 gives {{a more detailed}} view {{of the development of}} the <b>Antarctic</b> ozone <b>hole</b> than ever before. This instrumental suite extends the long series of satellite ozone measurements that go back to the early 1970 s. The OMPS includes two modules – nadir and limb – to measure profile and total ozone concentrations. The new limb module is designed to measure the vertical profile of ozone between the lowermost stratosphere and the mesosphere. The OMPS observations over Antarctica show excellent agreement with the measurements obtained from independent satellite and ground-based instruments. This validation demonstrates that OMPS data can ably extend the ozone time series over Antarctica in the future. The OMPS observations are used to monitor and characterize the evolution of the 2012 <b>Antarctic</b> ozone <b>hole.</b> While large ozone losses were observed in September 2012, a strong ozone rebound occurred in October and November 2012. This ozone rebound is characterized by rapid increases of ozone at mid-stratospheric levels and a splitting of the ozone hole in early November.

40|$|Not {{long after}} the {{discovery}} of the <b>Antarctic</b> ozone <b>hole,</b> it was established that halogen compounds, supplied to the atmosphere mainly by anthropogenic activities, are the primary driver of polar ozone loss. We will briefly review the chemical mechanisms that cause polar ozone loss and the early evidence showing the key role played by anthropogenic halogens. Recently, stratospheric halogen loading has leveled off, due to adherence to the Montreal Protocol and its amendments that has essentially banned CFCs (chlorofluorocarbons) and other halocarbons. We will describe recent reports of the first stage of recovery of the <b>Antarctic</b> ozone <b>hole</b> (e. g., a statistically significant slowing of the downward trend), associated with the leveling off of stratospheric halogens. Despite this degree of understanding, we will discuss the tendency of photochemical models to underestimate the observed rate of polar ozone loss and a hypothesis that has recently been put forth that might resolve this discrepancy. Finally, we will briefly discuss chemical loss of Arctic ozone, whic...|$|R
40|$|Chlorine- and bromine-containing ozone-depleting {{substances}} (ODSs) {{are controlled by}} the 1987 Montreal Protocol. In consequence, atmospheric equivalent chlorine peaked in 1993 and has been declining slowly since then. Consistent with this, models project a gradual {{increase in stratospheric ozone}} with the <b>Antarctic</b> ozone <b>hole</b> expected to disappear by [sim] 2050. However, we show that by 2013 the Montreal Protocol had already achieved significant benefits for the ozone layer. Using a 3 D atmospheric chemistry transport model, we demonstrate that much larger ozone depletion than observed has been avoided by the protocol, with beneficial impacts on surface ultraviolet. A deep Arctic ozone hole, with column values < 120 DU, would have occurred given meteorological conditions in 2011. The <b>Antarctic</b> ozone <b>hole</b> would have grown in size by 40 % by 2013, with enhanced loss at subpolar latitudes.

40|$|During {{the recent}} decades {{there has been}} an {{increasing}} concern related to ozone layer and solar ultraviolet radiation, (UV-B: 280 - 320 nm), reaching the surface of the earth. The <b>Antarctic</b> Ozone <b>Hole</b> (AOH) is a phenomenon of strong ozone depletion in the Antarctic stratosphere, this is a consequence of heterogeneous chemical reactions and dynamical processes which enhance ozone losses by reactions o o with chlorine. Punta Arenas (53. 0 S, 70. 9 W) is the southernmost city in Chile with a population of approximately 120000. Due to its location, well within the area affected by the <b>Antarctic</b> Ozone <b>Hole</b> the ozone distribution is affected in different altitudes. Systematic observation of ozone and UV-B with a Brewer spectrophotometer have been made in order study during the ozone hole conditions.

40|$|The {{dynamics}} of the ozone concetration components of the <b>Antarctic</b> ozone <b>hole</b> as related to seasonal and year-to-year temperature changes in August, September, October, and November during the 1979 - 1985 period is studied using a zonally averaged model in which all transport fields are fixed by input temperature data. The results suggest that, prior to 1984, both the seasonal and year-to year variability of the zonal-mean Antarctic ozone minimum and the surrounding maximum can {{be accounted for by}} temperature dynamics without invoking changes in chemical composition (e. g., chlorine content) or special chemistry. The same dynamical mechanism also accounts for the good simulation of the observed seasonal and latitudinal structure of column ozone {{in other parts of the}} world. However, chemical depletion of ozone may have become more important after 1984. The model also appears to underpredict the September ozone decline in years, leading to an underprediction of the recent minimum values in the <b>Antarctic</b> ozone <b>hole...</b>|$|R

40|$|In recent years, {{there has}} been {{considerable}} interest in chlorine-containing trace gases in the atmosphere, particularly in Antarctica because {{of the relationship between}} chlorofluorocarbons and the <b>antarctic</b> ozone <b>hole.</b> All chlorinecontaining trace gases, whether produced by human activities or by natural processes, have a potential for destroying ozone in the stratosphere. This is a complex environmental problem, {{but it is clear that}} manmade chlorine-containing gases are the driving force behind the <b>antarctic</b> ozone <b>hole</b> and, by extension, reductions of stratospheric ozone over other parts of the world [World Meteorological Organization (WMO) 1989, 1991, 1995]. We have taken measurements of the major chlorine-containing gases in Antarctica for more than 20 years, first at Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station and more recently at Palmer Station (64. 46 °S 64. 04 °W). Here we report the results of this work. During recent years, major changes in the concentration of ozone-depleting compounds have taken place in Antarctica because of the Montreal Protocol, which is designed to phase out the production of chlorofluorocarbons and related compounds, to prevent the destruction of the ozone layer (WMO 1995) ...|$|R
25|$|The <b>Antarctic</b> ozone <b>hole</b> {{is an area}} of the Antarctic {{stratosphere}} {{in which}} the recent ozone levels have dropped to as low as 33 percent of their pre-1975 values. The ozone hole occurs during the Antarctic spring, from September to early December, as strong westerly winds start to circulate around the continent and create an atmospheric container. Within this polar vortex, over 50 percent of the lower stratospheric ozone is destroyed during the Antarctic spring.|$|R
25|$|Reactions {{that take}} place on polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs) play an {{important}} role in enhancing ozone depletion. PSCs form more readily in the extreme cold of the Arctic and Antarctic stratosphere. This is why ozone holes first formed, and are deeper, over Antarctica.
