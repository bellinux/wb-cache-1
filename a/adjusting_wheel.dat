5000|$|The {{first of}} these trout reels, the #355, a reel with a {{two-tone}} clicker mechanism system, that can be activated as additional drag force, with a patent date of 1883, was joined around 1896 by the model #360, equipped with an [...] "adjustable, automatic silent tension drag" [...] system. To distinguish the two different models, later versions of the #355 were designated as the [...] "Peerless" [...] and #360 became the [...] "Perfection." [...] Only 2 direct successors of vom Hofe (Otto Zwarg and the Walker workshop) used the vom Hofe drag system in salmon reels, but not in trout reels. Joe Jancurias of Rochester, NY was the first maker, who made new Edward vom Hofe flyreels. For the 150th anniversary of the Orvis fishing tackle company, he made a limited set of [...] "Perfection" [...] models. Joe Jancurias died in 2011. There were former attempts preceding the Orvis Anniversary edition made by Joe Jancurias, but those failed in achieving the respected and acknowledged esthetics, for example in using the same size screws for 2 different sizes of reels for matters of economy. The size of the drag <b>adjusting</b> <b>wheel</b> was also out of proportion for the smaller size since the same diameter was used for both sizes, for economic reasons. Also the geometry of the handle had not been reproduced accordingly following the original vom Hofe formula and so leaving these attempts easily recognizable and discernible.In 2005, Edward vom Hofe was posthumously inducted into the International Game Fish Association Hall of Fame.|$|E
40|$|Subsoil {{compaction}} affects {{all aspects}} of soil quality, and contrary to topsoil compaction it is persistent. Natural alleviation processes such as wetting/drying, freezing/thawing and biological activity including root growth decrease rapidly with depth. In compacted soil, these alleviation processes are moreover diminished because root growth and biological activity are reduced and soil water contents remain higher in compacted than in well-structured soil. Wheel loads are still increasing and, in consequence, the extent and severity of subsoil compaction. Sustainable soil management requires the uncompromising criterion that no subsoil compaction can be accepted. Consequently, only field traffic with wheel loads lower than the carrying capacity of the subsoil is allowed. This implies that subsoil stress caused by wheel load should not exceed {{the strength of the}} subsoil. Therefore, this chapter emphasises the importance of soil strength and the calculation of soil stresses in the subsoil. One of the main constraints in using the carrying capacity concept proves to be the lack of data on soil strength. Existing recommended limits for wheel loads and inflation pressures are not adequate and can result in over or underestimating of allowable wheel loads and subsequent uneconomical solutions or subsoil compaction. Adequate drainage of soils is a prerequisite for reduced subsoil compaction. Mouldboard ploughing with all tractor wheels on the non-ploughed ‘land’ and umbilical systems for applying manure slurry are realistic options to reduce compaction. Controlled traffic systems that limit the wheeled area may be implemented by the use of wide span vehicles and by steering tractors along traffic lanes. Although we support such provisions, our chapter will advocate and focus primarily on <b>adjusting</b> <b>wheel</b> loads to the carrying capacity of the subsoils. ...|$|E
50|$|The Gyromax balance has six {{to eight}} small {{turnable}} weights that fit on pins located in recesses {{around the top of}} the balance wheel rim. Each of the weights, called collets, has a cutout making it heavier on one side. When the collet's cutout points to the outside of the balance wheel, the heavier side is toward the center which decreases the wheel's moment of inertia, increasing its speed. When the collet's cutout points toward the center, the weight moves outward and the balance wheel turns more slowly. A watchmaker can turn an individual collet to <b>adjust</b> the <b>wheel's</b> balance, referred to as 'poise', or pairs of opposing collets to <b>adjust</b> the <b>wheel's</b> rotation speed. The Gyromax is a 'free sprung' balance, meaning there is no regulator on the wheel's balance spring for adjusting the watch's rate, so the collets are used for adjusting both poise and rate.|$|R

50|$|CBS {{helps to}} reduce the danger of wheel locks and fall downs but in certain {{situations}} {{it is possible that}} CBS causes a fall down. If brake pressure is distributed from the rear wheel to the front wheel and the friction of the surfaces changes suddenly (puddle, ice on the street) the front wheel might lock even if only the rear brake has been applied.

CBS is therefore combined with ABS to avoid this on a motorcycle.Different approaches are possible to realize this combination:Without active pressure Build upSingle Version: A third additional channel links the rear wheel circuit through a delay valve to the front brake.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} a Microsoft Kinect-based feedback controller for a robot-assisted powered wheelchair trainer {{for children with}} a severe motor and/or cognitive disability. In one training mode, "computer gaming" mode, the wheelchair is allowed to rotate left and right while the children use a joystick to play video games shown on a screen in front of them. This enables them to learn {{the use of the}} joystick in a motivating environment, while experiencing the sensation and dynamics of turning in a safe setting. During initial pilot testing of the device, {{it was found that the}} wheelchair would creep forward while children were playing the games. This thesis presents a mathematical model of the wheelchair dynamics that explains the origin of the creep as a center of gravity offset from the wheel axis or a mismatch of the torques applied to the chair. Given these possible random perturbations, a feedback controller was developed to cancel these effects, correcting the system creep. The controller uses a Microsoft Kinect sensor to detect the distance to the screen displaying the computer game, as well as the left-right position (parallel parking concept) with respect to the screen, and then <b>adjusts</b> the <b>wheel</b> torque commands based on this measurement. We show through experimental testing that this controller effectively stops the creep. An added benefit of the feedback controller is that it approximates a washout filter, such as those used in aircraft simulators, to convey a more realistic sense of forward/backward motion during game play...|$|R
30|$|A {{new method}} {{used to detect}} the slip {{velocity}} {{is based on the}} multi-rate EKF state identification which combines the multi-rate and EKF method to estimate the traction motor load torque. This method provides a faster detection of slip and improves the reliability and traction performance [9]. A re-adhesion control system based on the disturbance observer for examining the first resonant frequency of the bogie system to utilize adhesion more efficiently was also proposed in [10, 11]. However, these methods are not reliable enough for industrial real-time applications because the time derivative of the adhesion force cannot be estimated correctly when the adhesion force changes quickly in case of sudden slip [12]. Estimation accuracy of adhesion force among the wheel and rail is quite beneficial for the solution of slip/slide problem. The aim of the controller is to maximize the adhesion coefficient while sustaining the overall stability of the railway vehicle. The slip velocity is adjusted by keeping it in the stable region adjacent to the peak point of the adhesion coefficient. To achieve the sub-optimal slip velocity, which corresponds to the approximity of the maximum value of the adhesion coefficient, is also suitable for the controller performance. The relationship between the tractive force and the wheel slip is a nonlinear function of the wheel–rail contact condition. For this reason, an estimator that estimates the wheel–rail adhesion condition and a traction controller which <b>adjusts</b> the <b>wheel</b> slip velocity to the optimal value should be added to the control scheme. Several control methods have been proposed based on sliding mode controller, fuzzy logic, adaptive schemes in the literature [13, 14, 15].|$|R
25|$|Proper {{tracking}} {{of the blade}} is crucial to accurate cutting and considerably reduces blade breakage. The first step to ensuring good tracking is to check that the two bandwheels or flywheels are co-planar. This {{can be done by}} placing a straightedge across the front of the <b>wheels</b> and <b>adjusting</b> until each <b>wheel</b> touches. Rotate the wheels with the blade in position and properly tensioned and check that the tracking is correct. Now install the blade guide rollers and leave a gap of about 1 mm between the back of the blade and the guide flange. The teeth of blades that have become narrow through repeated sharpening will foul the front edge of the guide rollers due to their kerf set and force the blade out of alignment. This can be remedied by cutting of a small step on the rollers' front edges to accommodate the protruding teeth. Ideally the rollers should be crowned, (see belt_and_pulley_systems) a configuration that assists in the proper {{tracking of}} bands and belts, at the same time allowing clearance for the set of the teeth.|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} tilt wheel {{was developed}} by Edward James Lobdell in the early 1900s. A 7-position tilt wheel was introduced by the Saginaw Division of General Motors in 1963 for all passenger car divisions except Chevrolet which received the tilt wheel in 1964. This tilt wheel was also supplied to the other US automakers (except Ford). [...] Originally a luxury option on cars, the tilt function helps to <b>adjust</b> the steering <b>wheel</b> by moving the wheel through an arc in an up and down motion. Tilt Steering Wheels rely upon a ratchet joint located in the steering column just below the steering wheel.

The SE series added semi-proportional, two-speed throttle and fully proportional rack-and-pinion steering with steering trim adjustable at the transmitter, as with a full-sized R/C.|$|R
40|$|Within the RIMRES project, a modular {{reconfigurable}} multi-robot {{system is}} being developed, which should demonstrate key technologies {{required for the}} exploration of challenging and difficult planetary terrain, as it is found at the lunar south pole. For this purpose, key technologies {{in the area of}} autonomy, navigation and locomotion are being investigated and hardware engineered with the overall aim of having a system with interchangeable but compatible components, connected via unique mechanical and electrical interfaces. This thesis was written in close collaboration with the German Aerospace Centre (DLR) at the Institute of Space Systems in Bremen and deals with the concept development and design of a flexible metal wheel with an adaptive mechanism for soft planetary soils. The concept presented here builds upon the DLR wheel design developed for the ESA ExoMars mission, which incorporated flexible metal spokes to enlarge the wheels ground contact area. The new wheel design will be equipped with an intelligent sensor system to monitor and characterise soil properties. Dependent upon whether the rover is rolling over a hard or soft soil area, an integrated adaptable stiffness mechanism will then actively <b>adjust</b> the <b>wheels</b> flexibility. Equivalent to the inflation of a rubber tyre, by increasing the stiffness of the wheel the rolling resistance can be minimised when running on hard ground, whilst decreasing the wheels stiffness will maximise the tractive force when running over soft ground. The work of this thesis in particular, deals with the concept development of such an adaptable system. The previous investigated ideas have been analysed in detail leading {{to a better understanding of}} their working principles. Subsequently, a new flexible wheel design was proposed based on the tensioned spoke wheel (bicycle wheel). With the help of computer based finite element analysis the non-linear deformation behaviour of the flexible elements was then evaluated. It has been shown, that the new wheel design, with near-parabolic shaped tension blades, permits large deflections above 10 % of the wheels diameter with low stress levels by maintaining a relatively harmonic oval shape of the wheels tread. Also simulated were cases of high torques and side skid (driving across slopes). In each load case the wheels deformation behaviour was analysed and cross checked from a structural mechanics point of view. The results found with the simulation, achieving the best performance in terms of deflection distance and applied load, were then used to design and construct a new breadboard demonstrator wheel, which is now used for extensive testing at DLR test facilities.
