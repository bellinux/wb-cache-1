5|$|Following his {{discharge}} from military service, Groza {{reported to the}} Browns' training camp in Bowling Green, Ohio. He showed up in army fatigues carrying all his clothes in <b>a</b> <b>duffel</b> <b>bag.</b> There, he joined quarterback Otto Graham, fullback Marion Motley and receivers Dante Lavelli and Mac Speedie to form {{the core of the}} new team's offense. Groza was mainly a placekicker in his first two years with the Browns, but he played a big part in the team's early success. In his first season, he set a professional football record for both field goals and extra points. The Browns, meanwhile, advanced to the AAFC championship against the New York Yankees. Groza sprained his ankle in the game and missed three field goals, but Cleveland won 14–9. Behind a powerful offense led by Graham, Motley and Lavelli, the Browns finished the 1947 season with a 12–1–1 record and made it back to the championship game. Groza, however, was injured and could only watch as the team won its second championship in a row.|$|E

The initial search of the vehicle {{was based on the}} rifle that was visible in the back seat, although possession of such a rifle was legal in New York State and required no special permit. The warrant still had not arrived when Berkowitz exited the apartment building at about 10:00p.m. and entered his car. Detective John Falotico approached the driver's side of the car. Falotico pointed his gun inches from the temple of the person of interest, while Detective Sgt. William Gardella pointed his gun from the passenger's side.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project was to design a foldable, lightweight, {{inexpensive}} addition to <b>an</b> existing <b>duffel</b> <b>bag</b> that will provide enough shade to cover the user's head and upper torso. The intended user for this product is an athlete who plays the sport of Ultimate Frisbee, as this typically involves bye rounds which some use for napping on the sidelines. The existing products to fill this need are too expensive, heavy, bulky or uncomfortable. The process for designing this feature included an extensive ideation phase, potential user interviews, prototype mock-ups, {{and the production of}} a final working prototype. This final prototype is made with the roll-out mat that comes attached to the Under Armour Medium Team <b>Duffel</b> <b>bag</b> and the metal support hoops from a collapsible laundry hamper.

She calmly and happily waits for the dome to catch up with her after it has consumed the city, and is then floating in a white void in a different art style. Then she appears riding a bicycle amid peaceful scenery matching a photo seen earlier in the video. The video contains many references to the classic anime film Akira.
