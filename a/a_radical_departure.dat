5|$|After 1966, in <b>a</b> <b>radical</b> <b>departure</b> {{from past}} policies, the Ministry of Economy {{announced}} a programme to reduce rising inflation while promoting competition, efficiency, and foreign investment. The anti-inflation programme focussed on controlling nominal wages and salaries. Inflation decreased sharply, decreasing from {{an annual rate}} of about 30% in 1965–67 to 7.6% in 1969. Unemployment remained low, but real wages fell.|$|E
5|$|The {{executives}} of Columbia Records were {{not convinced that}} the album would sell well, because the project was <b>a</b> <b>radical</b> <b>departure</b> from his earlier success in the outlaw movement. The album included pop, jazz and folk music styles, in addition to country. It was recorded from December 3–12, 1977.|$|E
5|$|As a final {{attempt to}} stop the Allied advances, the Japanese Imperial High Command planned an all-out defense of Kyūshū codenamed Operation Ketsugō. This was to be <b>a</b> <b>radical</b> <b>departure</b> from the defense in depth plans used in the invasions of Peleliu, Iwo Jima, and Okinawa. Instead, {{everything}} was staked on the beachhead; more than 3,000 kamikazes {{would be sent to}} attack the amphibious transports before troops and cargo were disembarked on the beach.|$|E
50|$|The DVD extras {{include three}} {{alternative}} endings, {{all of which}} conclude with Jim dying. Two were filmed, while the third, <b>a</b> more <b>radical</b> <b>departure,</b> was presented only in storyboards. On 25 July 2003, cinemas started showing the alternative ending after the film's credits.|$|R
50|$|The Fender HM Strat was an {{electric}} guitar produced by Fender Musical Instruments from 1988 until 1992. <b>A</b> relatively <b>radical</b> <b>departure</b> from Leo Fender's classic Stratocaster design, it was Fender's answer to Superstrats produced by manufacturers such as Jackson Guitars and Ibanez. HM stands for heavy metal.|$|R
5000|$|The {{character}} set also included the conventional symbols for multiplication and division, [...] and , but in <b>a</b> more <b>radical</b> <b>departure</b> from the conventions established by FORTRAN, it allowed implicit multiplication, so the expressions [...] and [...] were valid, {{with the values}} 99 and 15.9, respectively (op cit).|$|R
5|$|The album {{features}} a heavy use of electronics augmented by orchestration, and takes {{inspiration from the}} apocalyptic artwork of schizophrenic artist Royal Robertson. Stevens' use of electronics marked <b>a</b> <b>radical</b> <b>departure</b> from much of his previous work—most notably from Seven Swans and Michigan. Unlike Illinois, the lyrics do not explore events, characters or setting, but deal instead with themes and emotions on a personal level.|$|E
5|$|This {{major change}} from a Classical design to a far more complex revival style, little known in Russia, meant Vorontsov had to find an {{alternative}} architect to execute a new design. This was further complicated by Vorontsov's desire to not only have a loose Jacobean style, but also to incorporate motifs from Islamic architecture so as to highlight the oriental strain evident in the Khan's Palace, Enikale Fort, and other local Tatar architecture. The resulting design was to highlight the Crimea's position {{as a place where}} the East and West meet. It was <b>a</b> <b>radical</b> <b>departure</b> from the Neoclassical strain that dominated the Russian architecture of the period.|$|E
5|$|Following {{passage of}} the Catholic Relief Act, Charles Brownlow granted a site to the Roman Catholic parish priest the Reverend William O'Brien in 1829 for the {{construction}} of a church on Distillery Hill, now known as lower North Street. It was there that work began in 1832 on what is now St Peter's Church. In 1966, another Catholic church, St Paul's, was built at the junction of Francis Street and Parkview Street. This was <b>a</b> <b>radical</b> <b>departure</b> from traditional church architecture with its grey plaster finish, copper roof, slim spire, hexagonal angles and modern design throughout. Many of its architectural features such as the copper roof and gray plaster finish are shared by the neighbouring St Paul's School. It was designed to cope with the extra demand for worship space following the growth of the surrounding Taghnevan and Shankill housing estates.|$|E
50|$|Emmy van Deurzen (born 13 December 1951 in The Hague, Netherlands) is {{an existential}} {{therapist}} and honorary {{professor at the}} University of Sheffield. Emmy van Deurzen developed a philosophical therapy based in existential-phenomenology, which has provided <b>a</b> <b>radical</b> new <b>departure</b> for therapists interested in the therapeutic search for value, meaning and purpose.|$|R
5000|$|Ferrer later said: [...] "This was <b>a</b> very, very <b>radical</b> <b>departure</b> {{from any}} kind of fiction film anybody was making in the country. It was a picture which broke a {{tremendous}} number of shibboleths, and it established a new freedom in making films." ...|$|R
50|$|Stowe, in Buckinghamshire, (1730-1738), was <b>an</b> {{even more}} <b>radical</b> <b>departure</b> from the formal French garden. In the early 18th century, Richard Temple, 1st Viscount Cobham, had {{commissioned}} Charles Bridgeman {{to design a}} formal garden, with architectural decorations by John Vanbrugh. Bridgeman's design included an octagonal lake and a Rotunda (1720-21) designed by Vanbrugh.|$|R
5|$|In December 1971, {{following}} {{the defeat of}} South Vietnamese forces during Operation Lam Son 719, North Vietnamese leadership in Hanoi decided to launch a major military offensive against South Vietnam. In {{what became known as}} the Easter Offensive, the combined North Vietnamese and Việt Cộng forces employed combined arms tactics using heavy weapons that were <b>a</b> <b>radical</b> <b>departure</b> from the low-intensity guerrilla warfare of previous years. Although North Vietnam eventually used the equivalent of 14 army divisions, its leaders did not seek to win the war outright. Rather, their objective was to gain as much territory and destroy as many units of the South Vietnamese military as possible, in order to strengthen their bargaining position at the Paris Peace Talks.|$|E
5|$|Populous: The Beginning is a {{real-time}} strategy {{video game}} {{and is the}} third entry in the Populous video game series, developed by Bullfrog Productions. The game was released in 1998 on Microsoft Windows, and in 1999 for the PlayStation. Unlike earlier games in the series, which cast the player {{in the role of}} a god influencing loyal followers, The Beginning took <b>a</b> <b>radical</b> <b>departure</b> and placed the player in the role of a shaman, who directly leads her tribe against opponents. Throughout the twenty-five missions of the campaign, the player leads their tribe across a solar system, dominating enemy tribes and tapping new sources of magic, with the ultimate goal of the shaman attaining godhood herself.|$|E
5|$|The {{assemblage}} of monumental Neolithic structures in Orkney is without parallel in the United Kingdom {{and on the}} Orkney Mainland provides an entire landscape of features from this period. During this time, complex new societies {{came to the fore}} that were <b>a</b> <b>radical</b> <b>departure</b> from the earlier hunter-gatherers and which were capable of creating substantial structures. The Neolithic in Scotland lasted from approximately 4000 to 2200 BC and Orkney as a whole has nearly 3,000 identified Neolithic sites all told. British archaeologists have often interpreted this era as having two distinct phases; the Earlier Neolithic dominated by regional styles of pottery and architecture followed by a relatively abrupt change into the Later Neolithic characterised by new traditions found throughout the British Isles that incorporate structures on a grander scale. In the Orcadian context, there are definite developments during the Neolithic, but the changes are gradual and tend to build on earlier ideas rather than appearing to form two distinct periods.|$|E
30|$|The reform also {{established}} {{that access to}} benefits is contingent to the individual’s willingness to be active {{in the labor market}} (i.e. by participating in re-training courses) or to accept a job offer, at given conditions. In case of refusal–and this is <b>a</b> rather <b>radical</b> <b>departure</b> from the past–the benefit is cancelled. Of course, to be effective these ’stick and carrot” devices need very serious monitoring and implementation, which can be a problem in a country rather unfamiliar with active policies and to contingent benefits.|$|R
5000|$|Masses (2001), {{the first}} of several albums for the cross-genre Blue Series on Thirsty Ear, was <b>an</b> even more <b>radical</b> <b>departure.</b> Collaborators {{included}} saxophonists Evan Parker, John Tchicai and Tim Berne; bassist William Parker; trumpeters Roy Campbell, Kenny Wheeler and Wadada Leo Smith; trombonist Paul Rutherford; drummer Han Bennink; pianist Matthew Shipp; and guitarist Jason Pierce ...|$|R
5|$|Zelda II {{was rated}} the 110th best game {{made on a}} Nintendo System in Nintendo Powers Top 200 Games list. In August 2008, Nintendo Power listed it as the 12th best Nintendo Entertainment System video game, {{describing}} it as <b>a</b> <b>radical</b> and refreshing <b>departure</b> from its predecessor.|$|R
25|$|According to Buchanan and others, the Bush Doctrine was <b>a</b> <b>radical</b> <b>departure</b> {{from former}} United States foreign policies, and a {{continuation}} of the ideological roots of neoconservatism.|$|E
25|$|He {{wished to}} reach this `holy grail' of (theoretical/ mathematical) biology, but his heavy work load during the late 1960s—despite his related health problems—took its toll, and finally {{prevented}} him in 1972 from reaching his ultimate goal. Rashevsky's relational approach represents <b>a</b> <b>radical</b> <b>departure</b> from reductionistic approaches, and it has greatly influenced {{the work of his}} student Robert Rosen.|$|E
25|$|The family intrigues that {{challenged}} his succession to {{the throne}} probably contributed to John's approach to rulership, which was to appoint men from outside the imperial family to help him govern the empire. This was <b>a</b> <b>radical</b> <b>departure</b> from the methods of his father, who had used the imperial family and its many connections to fill almost all senior administrative and military posts.|$|E
40|$|President Carter 2 ̆ 7 s {{recognition}} of universal standards of human rights, and his formulation {{of a foreign}} policy at least partially based on such recognition, has been the object of both foreign and domestic criticism, which at first glance 2 ̆ 7 appears inexplicably severe. In {{the context of the}} present world legal order, however, the administration 2 ̆ 7 s expressed intention to pursue a policy directed toward a worldwide guarantee of human rights represents <b>a</b> potentially <b>radical</b> <b>departure</b> from the legal tenets which have governed world political interaction for the last 300 years...|$|R
40|$|The article explores two {{waves of}} active externalism. I first {{introduce}} {{the distinction between}} passive and active externalism and analyse a proposal of active externalism {{based on the principle}} of parity proposed by Clark and Chalmers. There are two main obstacles, causal-constitution fallacy and cognitive bloat, that threaten the extended cognition hypothesis. The second wave of discussions based on the complementarity principle deals with cognitive systems with feedback loops between internal and external elements and is <b>a</b> more <b>radical</b> <b>departure</b> from functionalism and traditional thinking about cognition. I conclude with some remarks on potential ethical considerations of extended cognition...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} the current dissatisfactions with the paradigm that has recently guided experimental social psychology—testing of theory-derived hypotheses {{by means of}} laboratory manipulational experiments. The emerging variant of doing field experiments {{does not meet the}} criticisms. It is argued that an adequate new paradigm will be <b>a</b> more <b>radical</b> <b>departure</b> involving, on the creative side, deriving hypotheses from a systems theory of social and cogni-tive structures that takes into account multiple and bidirectional causality among social variables. On the critical side, its hypotheses testing will be done in multivariate correlational designs with naturally fluctuating variables. Some steps toward this new paradigm are described in the form of seven koan...|$|R
25|$|The Plymouth Brethren Christian Church, {{the most}} {{hardline}} {{of all the}} Exclusive Brethren groups, has developed into a de facto hierarchical body which operates under the headship of an Elect Vessel, currently Bruce Hales of Australia. Some defectors have accused him and his predecessors of having quasi-papal authority. This development is almost universally considered by other streams of the Plymouth Brethren movement, however, as <b>a</b> <b>radical</b> <b>departure</b> from Brethren principles.|$|E
25|$|A new flying Batmobile design {{appears in}} Batman Beyond {{used by the}} new Batman (Terry McGinnis). This version of the vehicle made {{multiple}} appearances {{in the future of}} the DC Universe as flying cars were shown as commonplace technology in this future. This design is <b>a</b> <b>radical</b> <b>departure</b> from the usual style of Batmobiles, as they usually have a bat motif, from a bat faceplate on the grill, to tail fins resembling bat wings.|$|E
25|$|At the Salon d'Automne of 1910, {{held from}} 1 October to 8 November, Jean Metzinger {{introduced}} an extreme form {{of what would}} soon be labeled Cubism, {{not just to the}} general public for the first time, but to other artists that had no contact with Picasso or Braque. Though others were already working in a proto-cubist vein with complex Cézannian geometries and unconventional perspectives, Metzinger's Nude represented <b>a</b> <b>radical</b> <b>departure</b> further still.|$|E
40|$|This {{article is}} not {{available}} through ChesterRep. This article presents a critical account of the relation and unlikely trinity of philosophy, qualitative methodology and sports coaching research, in order to challenge assumptions {{about the nature of}} qualitative data analysis. <b>A</b> more <b>radical</b> <b>departure</b> and critique from a philosophical-hermeneutic perspective is encouraged. The key argument presented is that qualitative data analysis should have less to do with ‘method’ and more with philosophy, where ‘practical reasoning’ forges a dialectical relation between the intellectual and practical in the analytical process. This argument is illustrated with reference to published empirical work in the field of sports coaching research...|$|R
500|$|Newsted {{left the}} band {{prior to the}} initial {{sessions}} for the album, and the band decided {{to wait until the}} album was recorded before finding a new permanent member. Recording of the album started initially on April 23, 2001, but was postponed indefinitely when rhythm guitarist and singer James Hetfield entered rehab for [...] "alcoholism and other addictions". St. Anger is often recognized for being <b>a</b> <b>radical</b> musical <b>departure</b> from Metallica's earlier work; it features a modern heavy metal style, raw production, and no guitar solos. The artwork was created by Pushead, who had previously collaborated with the band.|$|R
5000|$|<b>A</b> more <b>radical</b> <b>departure</b> {{from the}} rhyme table {{tradition}} was the Zhongyuan Yinyun, created by Zhōu Déqīng (...) in 1324 {{as a guide}} to the rhyming conventions of qu, a new vernacular verse form. The entries are grouped into 19 rhyme classes each identified by a pair of exemplary characters. The rhyme classes are subdivided by tone and then into groups of homophones, with no other indication of pronunciation. The even tone ( [...] píng) is divided in upper and lower tones called [...] yīnpíng and [...] yángpíng, respectively. Syllables in the checked tone are distributed between the other tones, but placed after the other syllables with labels such as [...] (rùshēng zuò qùshēng [...] "entering tone makes departing tone").|$|R
25|$|In 1907, the German {{entrepreneur}} Carl Hagenbeck {{founded the}} Tierpark Hagenbeck in Stellingen, now {{a quarter of}} Hamburg. His zoo was <b>a</b> <b>radical</b> <b>departure</b> from {{the layout of the}} zoo that had been established in 1828. It was the first zoo to use open enclosures surrounded by moats, rather than barred cages, to better approximate animals' natural environments. He also set up mixed-species exhibits and based the layout on the different organizing principle of geography, as opposed to taxonomy.|$|E
25|$|When the Lincoln one-cent coin {{made its}} initial {{appearance}} in 1909, it marked <b>a</b> <b>radical</b> <b>departure</b> from the accepted styling of United States coinage, {{as it was}} the first regular coin to bear a portrait other than the mythical Liberty which appeared on most pre-1909 regular coins. Previously, a strong feeling had prevailed against using portraits on coins in the United States, but public sentiment stemming from the 100th anniversary celebration of Abraham Lincoln's birth proved stronger than the long-standing tradition.|$|E
25|$|In the mid-1970s, Canadian Marine Drilling (Canmar), the {{drilling}} subsidiary of Dome Petroleum, began {{drilling for oil}} in the Canadian part of the Beaufort Sea using ice-strengthened drillships and an extensive support fleet of icebreaking vessels. Aiming for year-round operations, the company also began developing its own experimental icebreaker concepts to support exploration drilling and, eventually, production-related operations. The first vessel of this research and development program was the 1979-built Canmar Kigoriak which represented <b>a</b> <b>radical</b> <b>departure</b> from conventional icebreaker designs with, among other features, a single-shaft mechanical propulsion system instead of a more commonly-used diesel-electric powertrain.|$|E
5000|$|British group Public Image Ltd (PiL) {{were also}} pioneers, {{described}} by the NME as [...] "arguably the first post-rock group". Their second album Metal Box (1979) almost completely abandoned traditional rock and roll structures in favor of dense, repetitive dub and krautrock inspired soundscapes and John Lydon's cryptic, stream-of-consciousness lyrics. The year before Metal Box was released, PiL bassist Jah Wobble declared, [...] "rock is obsolete". The Flowers of Romance (1981), their third album, was <b>an</b> even more <b>radical</b> <b>departure,</b> emphasizing rattling percussion and abstract tape music.|$|R
5000|$|The Chicago Tribunes Greg Kot {{warned that}} [...] "it may strike some {{longtime}} fans as <b>a</b> perhaps too <b>radical</b> <b>departure.</b> The rhythms are decidedly muted, with delicate vocals cushioned by lavish string and horn arrangements". The Daily Telegraphs Alexis Petridis surmised: [...] "Their worst excess may be whimsy - I'd Like That and Fruit Nut {{err on the}} cloying - but with songs as lusciously string- and harmony-laden as Green Man and the vocal charm of Partridge's unreconstructed Swindon twang, it's a minor quibble." ...|$|R
25|$|The D.V {{version was}} <b>a</b> less <b>radical</b> <b>departure</b> {{from the earlier}} D.II version and mostly {{differed}} from the D.II, in having its four-member cabane strut structure supporting a central panel for the upper wing, rather than both upper wing panel's wing roots meeting along the centreline of the aircraft, for better forward pilot vision. It also used the D.III version's Argus As.II engine and changed the mounting position of the aircraft's 7.92mm (.312in) lMG 08 machine gun from the right {{to the left side}} of the nose. A total of 57 D.V aircraft were built, from orders placed in October 1916 and January–June 1917, with 31 of these being sent to Germany's ally in the Central Powers, the Ottoman Empire.|$|R
