50|$|An {{important}} {{concept for}} evaluating <b>an</b> <b>asset's</b> exposure to systematic risk is Beta. Since Beta indicates {{the degree to}} which <b>an</b> <b>asset's</b> expected return is correlated with broader market outcomes, it is simply an indicator of <b>an</b> <b>asset's</b> vulnerability to systematic risk. Hence, the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) directly ties <b>an</b> <b>asset's</b> equilibrium price to its exposure to systematic risk.|$|R

50|$|The {{basic premise}} of {{infrastructure}} asset management is to intervene at strategic points in <b>an</b> <b>asset’s</b> normal life cycle {{to extend the}} expected service life, and thereby maintain its performance. Typically, <b>a</b> long-life-cycle <b>asset</b> requires multiple intervention points including a combination of repair and maintenance activities and even overall rehabilitation. Costs decrease with planned maintenance rather than unplanned maintenance. Yet, excessive planned maintenance increases costs. Thus, {{a balance between the}} two must be recognized. While each improvement raises <b>an</b> <b>asset’s</b> condition curve, each rehabilitation resets <b>an</b> <b>asset’s</b> condition curve, and complete replacement returns condition curve to new level or upgraded level. Therefore, strategically timing these interventions will aid in extending <b>an</b> <b>asset’s</b> life cycle. <b>A</b> simple working definition of asset management would be: first, assess what you have; then, assess what condition it is in; and lastly, assess the financial burden to maintain it at a targeted condition.|$|R

5|$|After {{a success}} as Hamlet in London in 1925, Barrymore left {{the stage for}} 14 years and instead focused entirely on films. In the silent film era, he was well {{received}} in such pictures as Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1920), Sherlock Holmes (1922) and The Sea Beast (1926). During this period, he gained his nickname, the Great Profile. His stage-trained voice proved <b>an</b> <b>asset</b> when sound films were introduced, and three of his works, Grand Hotel (1932), Twentieth Century (1934) and Midnight (1939) have been inducted into the National Film Registry.|$|E
5|$|At {{some point}} after leaving Switzerland and {{arriving}} in England, Rossier {{was commissioned by}} the firm of Negretti and Zambra to travel to China to photograph the Second Opium War (18581860). It {{may be that the}} firm considered Rossier's Swiss citizenship <b>an</b> <b>asset</b> for such a voyage, that his country's neutrality might help him find passage aboard either British or French ships. Taking into account the high costs and uncertainty incurred by the firm and the potential hazards for Rossier himself, this was an important commission.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} factor {{model is}} the capital asset pricing model (CAPM), which predicts that <b>an</b> <b>asset's</b> expected return {{in excess of the}} risk-free rate is wholly determined by its exposure to the market factor.

40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} central insight of the {{consumption}} capital asset pricing model that <b>an</b> <b>asset’s</b> expected return {{is determined by}} its equilibrium risk to consumption. Rather than measure risk by the contemporaneous covariance of <b>an</b> <b>asset’s</b> return and consumption growth, we measure risk by the covariance of <b>an</b> <b>asset’s</b> return and consumption growth cumulated over many quarters following the return. While contemporaneous consumption risk explains little {{of the variation in}} average returns across the 25 Fama-French portfolios, our measure of ultimate consumption risk at a horizon of three years explains a large fraction of this variation.

50|$|The {{technical}} community (e.g., Engineers, facilities managers, and logisticians, etc.) makes {{distinctions between}} {{maintenance and repairs}} whereas accountants generally do not. Accountants typically look at maintenance and repairs as period costs requiring immediate expensing as opposed to capital improvements that become capitalized and depreciated over some future time period. The technical community often defines maintenance in terms of retaining <b>an</b> <b>asset's</b> functionality compared to repairs that restore <b>an</b> <b>asset's</b> functionality.|$|R

5|$|Although sceptical, Harry sends Lucas to Kachimov {{to learn}} which cable the {{submarine}} will attack so Malcolm can launch a counterattack.

Lucas visits Elizabeta at her home, which was also their married home and he asks her to become <b>an</b> <b>asset</b> to MI5 to save her from arrest because of her association with Kachimov. In the end, Kachimov is with Harry and Ros in a field. Kachimov states his admiration for Adam's sacrifice, but then callously says he was a replaceable resource.

5|$|Although {{the gardens}} thrived {{in their early}} years, by 1842 Jennison was in {{financial}} difficulties, and on 13December bankruptcy proceedings were initiated. Jennison's problems were caused by his failure to sell the Strawberry Gardens property, competition from the recently opened Manchester Zoological Gardens, and the Manchester and Birmingham Railway track cutting through the land Jennison had leased in December 1836, restricting access to the gardens. Jennison twice tried unsuccessfully to sell Belle Vue, after which his creditors allowed him {{time to make a}} success of the gardens; {{by the end of the}} 1843 season Jennison was able to repay his debts. The railway that had been a thorn in his side eventually proved to be <b>an</b> <b>asset</b> when Longsight railway station was re-sited closer to Belle Vue in 1842, making it easier for visitors to reach the gardens.|$|E

The company bought the rights to adapt the Thorne novels and Morrissey was already developing it to pitch to television channels when Sky made an offer to broadcast it. As of 2010, Morrissey and Tubedale Films were developing two feature films with financing from the UK Film Council.

5|$|In January 2009 the Chancellor {{announced}} <b>an</b> <b>Asset</b> Purchase Facility (APF), to {{be administered}} by the MPC, aimed at ensuring greater liquidity in financial markets. The committee had already started to cut rates the previous autumn, but the effect of such changes {{can take up to}} two years and rates cannot go below zero. By March 2009, faced with very low levels on inflation and interest rates already at 0.5%, the MPC voted to start the process of quantitative easing (QE) – the injection of money directly into the economy – via the APF. It had the Bank buy government bonds (gilts), along with a smaller amount of high-quality debt issued by private companies. Although non-gilts initially made up a non-negligible part of the APF portfolio, as of May 2015 the entirety of the APF was held as gilts. On 7 August 2013, Governor Mark Carney issued the committee's first forward guidance as a third tool for controlling future inflation.|$|E

Though Foreign Secretary R.A. Butler strongly represented Begg's argument that the Victorious was too valuable <b>an</b> <b>asset</b> to lose, Thorneycroft's arguments won out. The Cabinet concurred that the ship should not be diverted, as a blockage of the carrier would increase Sukarno's prestige to no end, and approved preparations for Operation Althorpe, a plan to wipe out the Indonesian air force in retaliation for an attack.

5000|$|Accelerated {{depreciation}} {{refers to}} any one of several methods by which a company, for 'financial accounting' or tax purposes, depreciates <b>a</b> fixed <b>asset</b> in such <b>a</b> way that the amount of depreciation taken each year is higher during the earlier years of <b>an</b> <b>asset’s</b> life. For financial accounting purposes, accelerated depreciation is expected to be much more productive during its early years, so that depreciation expense will more accurately represent how much of <b>an</b> <b>asset’s</b> usefulness is being used up each year. For tax purposes, accelerated depreciation provides a way of deferring corporate income taxes by reducing taxable income in current years, in exchange for increased taxable income in future years.
