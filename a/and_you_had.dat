25|$|We {{said this}} movie is a stylized movie, it’s not so {{different}} from the world of a musical. And there were a few other things that contributed to that direction. One was the decision on Universal’s part, a crazy decision, to shoot the movie almost entirely in the studio under a tarpaulin. They built this gigantic tarpaulin, and the Battery and all these other places were built as real places. The Richlands. And just so you know, this is the early ’80s <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> stylized films—like New York, New York—that were all done on set and that idea was in the air. That idea of a totally artificial universe. The point is that we had in mind one sentence inspired by George Lucas: “in a galaxy long ago,” a futuristic past. That was in our heads…there’s the past and there’s the future, sort of.|$|E

500|$|During {{his time}} at Oxford, Clinton befriended fellow American Rhodes Scholar Frank Aller. In 1969, Aller {{received}} a draft letter that mandated deployment to the Vietnam War. Aller's 1971 suicide had an influential impact on Clinton. British writer and feminist Sara Maitland said of Clinton, [...] "I remember Bill and Frank Aller taking me to a pub in Walton Street in the summer term of 1969 and {{talking to me about}} the Vietnam War. I knew nothing about it, and when Frank began to describe the napalming of civilians I began to cry. Bill said that feeling bad wasn't good enough.

Plus, the whole reason I applied in the first place was because of my girlfriend, and I had gotten accepted already even though we had broken up before the first day." [...] After he graduated, he [...] "worked in a bakery back in Portland with a bachelor's degree in philosophy and legal theory".|$|E
500|$|At {{the age of}} 12, Hooper read a book {{entitled}} How to Make Film and Television and {{decided he wanted to}} become a director. For the next year Hooper researched filmmaking from publications such as On Camera by Harris Watts. Aged 13, he made his first film, entitled Runaway Dog, using a clockwork 16mm Bolex camera his uncle had given to him. Hooper said: [...] "The clockwork would run out after thirty seconds, so the maximum shot length was thirty seconds. I could only afford a hundred feet of Kodachrome reversal film, which cost about twenty-five , <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> to send off for two weeks to be processed. I could only make silent movies, because sound was too expensive and complicated." [...] He slowed down the frame rate of the camera so he could maximise what little film stock he had. Hooper classified the short, about a dog which kept running away from its owner, as a comedy, and filmed it on location in Oxfordshire.|$|E

Television columnist Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger opined that this episode [...] "made the best use yet of Cheyenne Jackson's Danny", and that he for once enjoyed [...] "Jenna's narcissism and self-delusion" [...] subplot, and her [...] "late attempt" [...] to seem young. [...] Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad enjoyed [...] "Black Light Attack!", though, his only complain was that 30 Rock did not focus more on the fictional show TGS, and said he would [...] "like to get back to more of that." [...] Entertainment Weeklys Margaret Lyons remarked that this episode and [...] "Klaus and Greta" [...] were terrific, and what stood out from both airings [...] "was how much serialized plot these two eps covered...

500|$|Rakeysh {{said the}} {{following}} in a scriptwriter's conference {{conducted by the}} Film Writers Association in the year 2008, [...] "I was making a documentary called Mamooli Ram, on the missed revolution with Kamalesh Pandey. We were sitting in a small hotel room in Nanded, drinking. We started singing songs, and we both realised we liked similar songs. And so Rang De Basanti was born. He was angry with the system, I was helpless with the system. We wanted to do so much. But we really can't do anything and it {{was born out of}} anger. He wrote a story called Ahuti, meaning sacrifice. Ahuti was about the armed revolution about India, between the years 1919 and 1931. It started with Ashfaqullah Khan, Ramprasad Bismil, Bhagat Singh, Rajguru, went on to Chandrashekhar Azad and so on. We had this amazing screenplay called Ahuti, which we had also termed as The Young Guns of India, which started with a train robbery, Azad on a horse and so on. I said, [...] "let's do The Young Guns of India". We were going to go on the floor, and suddenly {{there were a couple of}} film on Bhagat Singh made. But they came and went. Not because they were good or bad films, not because they were written badly or not written so bad. I'm not being judgmental about them. And this is very important: because they did not reflect the sentiment of today's time. Nobody in the audience could identify with something which was past. It wasn't that there wasn't idea of patriotism in us, but it was sleeping somewhere. <b>And</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> to kind of relate to it in today's world. So a couple of bottles of vodka again, and three days later, with couple of vodkas down, Kamlesh ji comes up with 'You know what, I think I've cracked it'." ...|$|E
500|$|By 1935 Jack Mara had {{received}} a degree from Fordham Law School, passed the bar, and was, at age 27, the team's president. By that same year, 19‑year‑old Wellington had become the team's secretary, {{and he started to}} exert influence over personal decisions. Newman retired before the 1935 season rather than come back from a back injury suffered the previous year when the team refused to give him a raise. This left Strong as the team's top draw, and the Giants signed him to a contract which guaranteed him $4,000 but gave him a percentage of the draw that could make his salary reach a maximum of $6,000 depending on attendance. At midseason the team's attendance had increased by 15% from the previous year's record ticket sales. Although Strong was paid well that season, and took advantage of high ticket sales from games in which he was injured, many of the other team's players were not. [...] "I felt pretty damn good," [...] Strong later said about his salary, [...] "but guys like Hein, Morgan, and Burnett weren't making much more than a hundred dollars a game. The salaries the front office fed to the newspapers weren't exactly true. We had three All-Stars on the Giants making less money than most of the bench warmers on the Dodgers. Hein was the greatest player the Giants ever had, but he didn't start making $5,000 until after his 12th season." [...] Hein remarked that he felt he was well paid for the time however, [...] "I think at the time $150 [...] was probably the highest pay of any lineman in the league. It was pretty good money, even though it wouldn't sound that way now, but you could buy a loaf of bread for a nickel and get a full meal for thirty-five cents in the Automat back then. <b>And</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> no income tax." ...|$|E

500|$|Although Duncan's initial tactics at {{the battle}} were {{reminiscent}} of those of Howe at the Glorious First of June, and his eventual attack {{has been compared to}} Nelson's tactics at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805, Duncan credited the tactical work Essay on Naval Tactics by John Clerk of Eldin for inspiring his decisions on the day. Duncan was subsequently indirectly criticised some years after the battle by his colleague Earl St Vincent, who had won the Battle of Cape St Vincent over a Spanish fleet nine months before Camperdown. In a letter complaining of Clerk's assertion that he had been responsible for all of the major naval victories of the war, St Vincent wrote that Duncan [...] "was a brave officer, little versed in the subtleties of naval tactics, and who would have been quickly embarrassed by them. When he saw the enemy, he rushed upon him without thinking of such and such and order of battle. To conquer he calculated upon the brave example he set his captains, and the event justified his expectation." [...] This assessment was refuted by Captain Hotham, who publicly responded that [...] "the advanced season of the year and the close proximity of the enemy's coast all made what, upon another occasion, might have appeared haste imperatively necessary, for it was the prompt decision of the Admiral that occasioned the result". Some modern historians, such as Peter Padfield, have agreed with Hotham's assertion, with the added suggestion that Duncan's tactics during the battle might have had an influence on the newly promoted Rear-Admiral Sir Horatio Nelson, who was in England recovering from the loss of his right arm at the Battle of Santa Cruz de Tenerife at the time of Camperdown. Duncan himself felt that he could have done more, noting that [...] "We were obliged ... to be rather rash in our attack. Had we been ten leagues at sea none would have escaped." [...] but some of the highest praise came from his erstwhile opponent, De Winter, who wrote that [...] "Your not waiting to form line ruined me: if I had got nearer the shore <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> attacked, I should probably have drawn both fleets on it, {{and it would have been}} a victory for me, being on my own coast." [...] Duncan's health deteriorated after the battle, forcing his retirement from the Navy in 1799 and contributing to his death at Cornhill-on-Tweed in 1804.|$|E

[...] In a 1988 interview, Miller stated, [...] "It's a theory of probability that's a mathematical discipline that more or less has been applied improperly to real-life situations. It's just that idea {{of a set of}} rules that gets misused that intrigued me about it.... kind of a telling comment on life in general—that you just have {{to have some sort of}} set of rules, but who knows what the set of rules should be."
