40|$|The {{formation}} {{process of}} anodic film on aluminium {{was investigated in}} the bath containing adipic acid and sulfuric acid (ASA bath) by using dynamic electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (DEIS). An interface reaction and ionic migration mechanism of anodic oxidation process in the ASA bath was established to interpreting the DEIS data. The impedance was decrease {{with the addition of}} adipic acid added in the <b>anodizing</b> <b>bath,</b> because of the adsorption of adipic anions on the surface of oxide film. An electrical equivalent circuit (EEC) model was established to analyse the relationship of the EEC model elements with the applied potential. The results indicated that the addition of adipic acid into the <b>anodizing</b> <b>bath</b> was beneficial to the grown of oxide film on aluminium, like faster in grown rate and thicker in thickness...|$|E
40|$|The {{temperature}} development during anodizing processes plays a {{key role}} in the case of industrial hard anodizing processes. Commonly, only the bath temperature is controlled; although it is well known that the bath temperature can significantly deviate from the temperature across the interface metal/oxide/electrolyte no investigation is known which shows the temperature deviation in this area. The authors have built a special experimental setup which allows a local temperature measurement across the interface. The results show the possibility of local resolved temperature measurements and the calculation of the heat flow into the metal and the <b>anodizing</b> <b>bath.</b> Based on this knowledge a target control of the current-voltage-regime avoids the formation of thermally caused cracks in hard anodized layers...|$|E
40|$|The Royal Society of Chemistry 2014. Titanium anodic oxide layers with {{a bottle}} shaped nanotubular {{structure}} have been grown in an electrolyte containing NH 4 F, applying voltage steps. The grown layers were analyzed using scanning and transmission electron microscopy (SEM and TEM), and Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy (RBS). The results show that a concentration of 0. 15 M of NH 4 F in the <b>anodizing</b> <b>bath,</b> and a step of 10 to 20 V produces an oxide with a double morphology comprised of nanotubes at the oxide/metal interface and nanopores at the oxide/electrolyte interface of the anodic layer. Higher concentration of F- in the bath, 0. 3 and 0. 45 M NH 4 F, enhanced the chemical dissolution of the anodic layer resulting in nanotubular structures along the oxide layer. Therefore, the bottle shaped nanotubular structures that show a well defined morphology are obtained in a bath containing a concentration of 0. 3 M NH 4 F and applying a voltage step of 10 - 20 V.

40|$|Many {{methods of}} {{corrosion}} protection rely on toxic chemicals such as hexavalent chromium (Cr 6 +), {{which is the}} species responsible for protection in conversion coatings, <b>anodizing</b> <b>baths</b> and as a pigment in polymer coatings. Despite many attemps to replace Cr 6 + and other harzardous chemicals in corrosion protection, very little progress has been made. Passive layers containing Ce and Mo have already been formed on materials such as A 17075 and A 12024, and their corrosion behaviour {{has been shown to}} improve by inhibition of both anodic and cathodic reaction. In this work the results of applying these coatings to SS 304 and 316 will be presented.

In this first of it’s kind installation in an industrial environment, steam at 4 bar will be fed into the existing distribution lines of the production to heat <b>anodizing</b> <b>baths</b> and storage tanks. The integration of the solar steam through separate heat exchangers in parallel to the existing system was also considered. In principle, due to the low temperatures of the baths, solar hot water systems could be integrated in the same way. However, the additional heat exchangers and pipelines between {{the solar system and}} the consuming process generate significant investment cost on top of the solar system. The selected integration of the solar steam generator in parallel to the existing boiler reduces the complexity of the system, saves cost by avoiding duplication of piping and heat exchangers, and provides flexibility in the operation to ensure security of supply and maximum use of available solar energy...|$|R

However, bacterial colonization {{competes with}} host cells and ultimately may produce implant-related difficult-to-treat infections, justifying {{the efforts to}} obtain infection-resistant materials. In a previous work, the authors demonstrated the antibacterial properties of anodic fluoride-TiO 2 nanostructured layers on Ti- 6 Al- 4 V alloy. In this work, the <b>anodizing</b> <b>bath</b> has been modified in order to grow fluoride-TiO 2 barrier layers (FBL). A bacterial adherence protocol, run with reference and six different clinical strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, showed a statistically significant decrease {{in the percentage of}} covered surface (p< 0. 0001, Kruskal-Wallis test) for FBL specimens when compared with non fluoride-containing specimens, i. e. chemically polished Ti- 6 Al- 4 V and F-free TiO 2 barrier layers. The results obtained on the F-barrier layers allowed discrimination between the effects of the presence of fluoride in the layer and the layer nanostructure on bacterial adhesion. © 2013 Elsevier B.

40|$|The {{conditions}} of Al <b>anodizing,</b> <b>bath</b> temperatures, current densities, and concentrations of H 2 SO 4 and Al- 2 (SO 4) (3) in pure H 2 SO 4, and H 2 SO 4 +Al- 2 (SO 4) (3) solutions where {{the growth of}} porous anodic alumina films is uniform/regular and nonuniform/abnormal with appearance of pitting, were experimentally determined. The equations describing the mass and charge transport phenomena and {{the composition of the}} solution at the pore bases during the regular oxide growth were solved. The current densities at which the H 2 SO 4 concentration becomes minimum at low film thicknesses were determined, which coincided with the experimental ones above which pitting appeared. They increased with the bath temperature and the H 2 SO 4 concentration and decreased with the Al- 2 (SO 4) (3) concentration. A criterion for pitting apearance was thus formulated. It explained the promotion of pitting appearance by the low bath temperatures and H 2 SO 4 concentrations, high current densities, and sulphate additives, which is important for developing methods for producing regularly grown high-quality coatings...|$|E
40|$|The {{determination}} of {{the composition of the}} anodizing solution inside the pores during the growth of porous anodic Al 2 O 3 films is of great importance {{for the study of the}} kinetics and mechanism of growth and the structure of oxide. This composition can be determined only by considering the mass and charge transport phenomena inside the pores. In the present work the general and complex equations governing the mass and charge transport phenomena inside the pores during the growth of porous anodic Al 2 O 3 films on aluminium in H 2 SO 4 <b>anodizing</b> <b>bath</b> solution were suitably transformed to equations which involve partial (migration and diffusion) transport numbers of ions, total transport numbers, electrolytes concentrations and elementary parameters like limiting equivalent ion conductivities, diffusion coefficients for the electrolytes H 2 SO 4 and Al- 2 (SO 4) (3) etc. A numerical solution of these equations for the growth of oxide in a stirred bath at bath temperatures 20 to 40 degrees C and current densities 1 to 105 mA cm(- 2) was found for film thicknesses up to 150 mu m. It describes the variation of the electrolyte concentrations at pore bases with film thickness and along pores in the simplified but representative case of cylindrical pores. The Al- 2 (SO 4) (3) concentration always increases towards the pore bases. It also increases with increasing current density and decreasing bath temperature. Nevertheless, the H 2 SO 4 concentration decreases, increases or passes through a minimum at a position along the pores; the kind of variation depends on the anodizing conditions by a complex but well described manner. Predictions for their variations along the pores during the real growth of the anodic Al 2 O 3 films were also made. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science S. A. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} investigates {{the effect of}} tartaric acid on anodic film {{morphology}} and on corrosion resistance of hydrothermally sealed anodized AA 2024. Anodizing treatment was performed in dilute sulfuric acid electrolyte with or without addition of tartaric acid. Hydrothermal sealing {{was carried out in}} boiling water for each anodized specimen. The morphology of the sealed anodic films was examined using field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed to assess sealing quality and corrosion resistance of the anodic films. It was shown that the sealing was more efficient in the case of anodic films formed in tartaric acid electrolyte mainly due to their lower porosity. It was also observed that the properties of the barrier layer were higher when sealing was performed on specimens anodized in the presence of tartaric acid. This suggests a specific role of the species on the barrier layer, which contributes to the enhancement of the performance in terms of corrosion resistance of the sealed anodic films. The present study clearly validates the beneficial role of tartaric acid in <b>anodizing</b> <b>baths</b> for the corrosion protection of AA 2024...|$|R

Typha latifolia, a variety of broad leaf cattail type bioremediator, stem and leaves are used to prepare the activated carbon which {{was used as a}} novel adsorbent. The influence of pH, adsorbent dose and contact time, metal concentration, adsorbent nature and concentration on the selectivity and sensitivity of the removal process was investigated. The kinetics of adsorption process was studied by Lagergren’s pseudo-first order and pseudo-second order kinetics and the adsorption process depends on both time and concentration. The feasibility of the sorption was studied using Freundlich and Langmuir isotherms including linear regression methods. The mechanism of the adsorption process was evaluated with intra particle diffusion model. Various thermodynamic parameters such as the standard Gibbs free energy (ΔG°), standard entropy (ΔS°), and standard enthalpy (ΔH°) were calculated. The Typha latifolia activated carbon (TLAC) adsorbent material was characterized by using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR). In this study, Langmuir isotherm was the most favorable method for the adsorption of chromium. The kinetic result shows that the adsorption process follows pseudo-second order kinetics, which implies that the adsorption proces...|$|R

40|$|The {{thesis is}} focused on the {{theoretical}} description of the technology of anodizing of aluminium, magnesium, zinc and their alloys. In this work, methods for formation of oxide layers and the used chemical processes are described in detail. The experimental part of this work deals with formation of oxide layers on aluminium, magnesium and zinc of high purity under different conditions. Oxide layers of different thicknesses were created on all three experimental materials. Aluminium was <b>anodized</b> in a <b>bath</b> of 10 % H 2 SO 4, magnesium in the bath of 1 mol/dm 3 NaOH, and zinc in the bath of 0. 5 mol/dm 3 NaOH. Processes were carried out at laboratory temperature. On the aluminium, continuous oxide layer was formed. Furthermore rule " 312 " was verified, that can indicatively be used for calculating the thickness of the resulting oxide layer on the aluminium. When using lower current of 0. 08 and 0. 2 A for magnesium anodizing, dark colored layer was created comparing to higher current of 0. 5 A. More rough appearance of the oxide layer was produced with increasing voltage. Further, it was observed for magnesium that the resulting layer comprises of two sublayers. For zinc, black colored layer was created when the voltage 20 V and current from 0. 4 to 0. 5 A were used. In the layer, two sublayers were also observed. For lower voltage and current (0. 05 A, 0. 17 V), formation of the oxide layer on the zinc does not occur, but the crystallographic etching was observed...|$|R
