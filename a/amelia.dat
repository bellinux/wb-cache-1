50|$|Like A. insinuator, A. <b>ameliae</b> {{is one of}} {{the rare}} inquiline parasites that {{produces}} workers and resembles its host in morphology, but unlike A. insinuator, A. <b>ameliae</b> queens differ dramatically from their host queen in size. In all colonies of A. subterraneus sampled in A. <b>ameliae</b> range, all of them were parasitized by A. <b>ameliae.</b> Thus, A. <b>ameliae</b> appears to be very common, yet until recently has been overlooked, suggesting the possibility that many other species of social parasites exist that have yet to be identified. As in A. insinuator, A. <b>ameliae</b> produces a workforce that is essential for the production of the parasite alates, but this trait is being selected against over evolutionary time, although it has not yet been lost.|$|R
