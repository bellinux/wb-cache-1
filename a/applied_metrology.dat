Additionally, results produced by different measurement procedures for the same measurand must be comparable if common diagnostic decision values and clinical research findings are to be broadly <b>applied.</b> <b>Metrology,</b> the science of measurement, provides laboratory medicine with a structured approach to the development and terminology of reference measurement systems which, when implemented, improve the accuracy and comparability of patients ’ results. The metrological approach is underpinned by the concepts of common measurement units, traceability of measured values, measurement uncertainty and commutability. Where traceability to the International System of Units (SI units) is not yet realized for a measurand, result comparability may be achievable by other, less ideal, approaches.

40|$|Scientific and {{fundamental}} metrology concerns {{the development of}} new measurement methods. Technology development evaluates in the emergence of new devices, methods and techniques, allowing to obtain spatial and geometric information about constructions with greater accuracy and less labour- and time-consumption. <b>Applied</b> <b>metrology</b> concerns the application of measurement science to their use in society. Such information is of great importance, since the use of these data can provide, for example, a complete view of the construction project documentation accuracy or will allow for further structure and facility monitoring, deviations of structures from the design project, sediment and overall construction state. Another important application is the imprinting objects, in particular listed buildings, in order to preserve their appearance, meaning the use of this data in the restoration or rehabilitation facilities. During the subsequent processing information can be transformed into other forms of fixation like drawings and three-dimensional model. Metrology has thrived at the interface between science and manufacturing. Particularly, Laser scanning and Photogrammetry methods found their wide application in solving practical tasks in architecture and building construction. These are the most common methods of obtaining this information.

It establishes a common understanding of units, crucial to human activity. Trading manufactured goods, the ability to accurately diagnose illnesses, and ensuring consumer confidence during the purchase of goods and services all depend on confidence in the measurements made during these processes. This confidence is achieved by metrology's three basic activities: the definition of internationally accepted units of measurement, the realisation of these units of measurement in practice, and the application of chains of traceability (linking measurements to reference standards).

40|$|Abstract—Silicon atomic force {{microscope}} (AFM) cantilevers having integrated solid-state heaters {{were originally}} developed for application to data storage, but have since been <b>applied</b> to <b>metrology,</b> thermophysical property measurements, and nanoscale manufacturing. These applications beyond data storage have strict requirements for mechanical characterization and precise temperature calibration of the cantilever. This paper describes detailed mechanical, electrical, and thermal charac-terization and calibration of AFM cantilevers having integrated solid-state heaters. Analysis of the cantilever response to electrical excitation in both time and frequency domains aids in resolving heat transfer mechanisms in the cantilever. Raman spectroscopy provides local temperature measurement along the cantilever with resolution near 1 m and 5 C and also provides local surface stress measurements. Observation of the cantilever mechanical thermal noise spectrum at room temperature and while heated provides insight into cantilever mechanical behavior and com-pares well with finite-element analysis. The characterization and calibration methodology reported here expands the use of heated AFM cantilevers, particularly the uses for nanomanufacturing and sensing.

Dispersive waves typically consist of an ensemble of optical modes. Here, a limiting case is studied in which the dispersive wave is concentrated into a single cavity mode. In this limit, its interaction with the soliton induces hysteresis behaviour in the soliton’s spectral and temporal properties. Also, an operating point of enhanced repetition-rate stability occurs through balance of dispersive-wave recoil and Raman-induced soliton-self-frequency shift. The single-mode dispersive wave can therefore provide quiet states of soliton comb operation useful in many applications...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} the growing "divergence" {{in the field}} of surface metrology through the presentation of a practical system for unification. A technical and economic review of <b>applied</b> surface <b>metrology</b> is presented, highlighting the problems associated with the many advances in instrumentation - particularly in light of the growing industrial dependence on surface metrology. This background serves {{as the basis for the}} development of a scheme whereby surface specification, instrumentation, and analysis can be concisely and completely defined and, more importantly, controlled. Several technical aspects of surface metrology are addressed in the development of the scheme. First the topic of specification and reference geometries is addressed, where it is argued that least squares methods should provide the most stable basis for assessment. Stylus/radius convolution and the associated wavelength transmissions are also considered and experimental investigations are undertaken as to describe their influences on measured data sets. The treatment of unwanted asperities is investigated and a new, robust algorithm developed and presented. The study of wavelength limitation approaches concludes that a sub-set of current methods is technologically acceptable and therefore economically attractive. A review of parameterization concentrates on a means for selecting a "unified" set of parameters and guidelines for the incorporation of future parameters. Finally, it is shown that the this proposed scheme {{addresses the}} underlying divergence in surface metrology in a manner which is practical in the context of application, technically justified in the context of standardization, and extensible in the context of further research...|$|R
