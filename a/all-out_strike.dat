2500|$|When {{the miners}} had {{converted}} their overtime ban into an <b>all-out</b> <b>strike,</b> Prime Minister Edward Heath called a snap general election. Two days before polling day, on Tuesday 26 February, Adamson addressed {{a conference of}} senior managers organised by the Industrial Society at which he was asked what the Conservatives should do, if re-elected, about the Industrial Relations Act. Adamson replied [...] "if I were them I would try {{to get close to}} the unions and hammer out something better (than the Act)", going on to say that amendment of the Act was not possible because [...] "it is so surrounded by hatred that we must have a more honest try at another Act".|$|E
2500|$|The CWU {{confirmed}} on 13 October 2013 {{that strike}} action would occur {{in response to}} the privatisation of Royal Mail, with a possible start date of 23 October 2013. A union source stated: [...] "It is likely to be an <b>all-out</b> <b>strike</b> first, then rolling strikes in the run up to Christmas", while the CWU has dismissed the offer of an 8.6% rise over three years as [...] "misleading and unacceptable". Prior to the announcement of the strike ballot results on the afternoon of 16 October 2013, employees were offered £300 to cross the picket line if a nationwide postal strike occurs. The CWU called off strike action on 30 October 2013 while negotiations progressed with Royal Mail's management. The talks were extended on 13 November 2013, with the aim that an agreement be reached by both sides by 20 November 2013. Royal Mail confirmed that both sides had reached a proposed settlement on 4 December, and the CWU confirmed on 9 December 2013 that it would recommend the deal to its members. On 6 February 2014, the CWU confirmed that Royal Mail staff had voted to accept the settlement.|$|E
50|$|On 22 December 1978, an <b>all-out</b> <b>strike</b> at the BBC {{meant that}} 21.2 million viewers watched the programme, the highest ever rating {{for a game}} show {{produced}} by ITV.|$|E
25|$|The TUC {{feared that}} an <b>all-out</b> general <b>strike</b> would bring revolutionary {{elements}} {{to the fore}} and limited the participants to railwaymen, transport workers, printers, dockers, ironworkers and steelworkers, as they were regarded as pivotal in the dispute.|$|R
50|$|Possible {{consequences}} of such actions, although not explicitly addressing the OPPLAN34A operations, were assessed by the United States Intelligence Community in late May, on the assumption The actions to be taken, primarily air and naval, with the GVN (US-assisted) operations against the DRV and Communist-held Laos, and might subsequently include overt US military actions. They would be on a graduated scale of intensity, ranging from reconnaissance, threats, cross-border operations, and limited strikes on logistical targets supporting DRV operations against South Vietnam and Laos, to strikes (if necessary) on {{a growing number of}} DRV military and economic targets. In the absence of <b>all-out</b> <b>strikes</b> by the DRV or Communist China, the measures foreseen would not include attacks on population centers or the use of nuclear weapons.|$|R
50|$|The {{government}} declared all strike action {{illegal and}} coordinated with business leaders {{to attempt to}} break the strike by using replacement workers and threats of reprisal. On January 6, the government threatened to arrest at least 20 union officials.On January 16, riot police fired tear gas at thousands of workers marching toward Myongdong Cathedral. As a result, Kwon Young Kil, the strike’s leader, announced on January 18 that the KCTU would strike only on Wednesdays until Feb 18, when they would resume <b>all-out</b> <b>strikes</b> if the government didn’t cancel the law. They would also hold mass protests every Saturday. Later that day, police tangled with thousands of workers and student supporters trying to reach union leaders.On January 20, the president agreed to meet opposition leaders to try to resolve unrest as {{tens of thousands of}} union members returned to work. Hundreds of students battled police with firebombs, rocks and tear gas after a union leader urged an end to violence.|$|R
50|$|McDaggett {{decides to}} execute an <b>all-out</b> <b>strike</b> against Cadillac Heights {{with the help}} of the Detroit City police department, but the outraged police {{officers}} refused to comply and instead defect to the resistance. As a result, McDaggett turns to hiring street gangs and hooligans to assist with his plans.|$|E
50|$|On 14 June 1985, Liverpool City Council {{passed an}} illegal budget, in which {{spending}} exceeded income, demanding the deficit {{be made up}} by the government. As bankruptcy loomed and plans for <b>all-out</b> <b>strike</b> action were finally discussed, they were narrowly lost, and not all unions balloted their members.|$|E
50|$|Since 2007, ROOD {{has been}} organising actions for the {{improvement}} of the education system. The main focus of these actions was against the '1040 hour norm' (a norm that forces schools to give an unrealistic high amount of lessons, creating a huge amount of 'free hours' for students). This 1040 norm caused a spontaneous <b>all-out</b> <b>strike</b> among secondary school students.|$|E
5000|$|As {{a show of}} force, on March 31 Soshkin {{orders a}} {{symbolic}} nuclear strike above the North Sea. The United States responds by going to full nuclear alert and preparing to execute the Single Integrated Operational Plan. On April 1, a Soviet radar post suffers an equipment malfunction. Falsely believing that the USSR is under nuclear attack, Soshkin orders an <b>all-out</b> nuclear <b>strike</b> against the West. The US and NATO respond in kind. Thousands of nuclear devices are launched across the Northern Hemisphere. [...] "There is no further historical record of what happens next".|$|R
5000|$|Stanley Kubrick's 1964 film Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb, {{adapted from}} Peter George's 1958 novel [...] "Red Alert", was heavily {{influenced}} by Kahn's writings. In the film, General Buck Turgidson (played by George C. Scott) carries a binder titled [...] "World Targets in Megadeaths." [...] Turgidson promotes an <b>all-out</b> pre-emptive <b>strike,</b> which he feels will result in acceptable American casualties, with the phrase [...] "...choose between two admittedly regrettable, but nevertheless, distinguishable post-war environments: one where you've got 20 million people killed, and the other where you got 150 million people killed." ...|$|R
5000|$|Grechko was {{an active}} member in the Communist Party, {{and was a member}} of the Politburo. As Minister of Defense, Grechko helped {{modernize}} the Soviet Army, and was greatly responsible for maintaining the military strength of the Soviet state. As Defense minister, Grechko's most notable idea was his assumption that a Third World War would always go nuclear at some point, and as such he planned that if World War III did begin, to launch <b>all-out</b> nuclear <b>strikes</b> against the NATO nations the moment that the war began. [...] For Grechko, nuclear weapons would be weapons of first resort in a world war, not weapons of last resort. The urn containing his ashes is buried by the Kremlin Wall Necropolis.|$|R
50|$|McDaggett {{decides to}} execute an <b>all-out</b> <b>strike</b> against Cadillac Heights {{with the help}} of the Detroit police, but the police officers, enraged at the company's sadistic ways, refuse to comply and instead defect to the {{resistance}} in order to get revenge for Lewis and their salaries and pensions, escalating the rebellion against OCP into a full-scale city war. As a result, McDaggett turns to hiring street gangs and hooligans to assist with his plans.|$|E
5000|$|During an <b>all-out</b> <b>strike</b> at Irish Distillers Group in 1974, McCourt {{focused on}} trade unions saying; [...] "Our country is {{involved}} in a war, a war that threatens the development we all legitimately seek [...] [...] [...] We {{can go a long way}} towards winning our share in Ireland of this particular war by putting in more than we try to take out, by some reduction in self-interest in favour of the national well-being." ...|$|E
5000|$|That day, Mitscher's planes did {{not find}} the Japanese ships, but American {{submarines}} succeeded in sending two enemy carriers ( [...] and [...] ) to the bottom. In the evening, three of Mitscher's four carrier task groups headed west in search of Ozawa's retiring fleet, leaving only TG 58.4 and a gun line of old battleships {{in the immediate vicinity}} of the Marianas to cover ground forces on Saipan. Planes from the American carriers failed to find the Japanese force until mid-afternoon on the 20th when an Avenger pilot reported spotting Ozawa almost 300 mi ( [...] km) from the American carriers. Mitscher daringly ordered an <b>all-out</b> <b>strike</b> even though he knew that night would descend before his planes could return.|$|E
25|$|When McNamara {{took over}} the Pentagon in 1961, the United States {{military}} relied on an <b>all-out</b> nuclear <b>strike</b> {{to respond to a}} Soviet attack of any kind. This kind of strike would lead to the death of Soviet military forces and also civilians. This was the same nuclear strategy planned by the Strategic Air Command (SAC), led by General Curtis LeMay. McNamara did not agree with this kind of action. He sought for other options after seeing how this strategy could not guarantee the destruction of all Soviet nuclear weapons leaving the United States vulnerable to retaliation. McNamara’s alternative in the doctrine of counterforce was to try to limit the United States nuclear exchange by targeting only enemy military forces. This concept would be used to prevent retaliation and escalation by holding Soviet cities hostage to a follow up strike. McNamara later concluded that counterforce was not likely to control escalation but likely to provoke retaliation. The U.S. nuclear policy remained the same.|$|R
5000|$|Commodore Tim Hare, former Director of Nuclear Policy at the British Ministry of Defence, has {{described}} [...] "sub-strategic use" [...] as offering the Government [...] "an extra {{option in the}} escalatory process before it goes for an <b>all-out</b> strategic <b>strike</b> which would deliver unacceptable damage". However, this sub-strategic capacity has been criticized as potentially increasing the [...] "acceptability" [...] of using nuclear weapons. Combined with the trend in {{the reduction in the}} worldwide nuclear arsenal as of 2007 is the warhead miniaturization and modernization of the remaining strategic weapons that is presently occurring in all the declared nuclear weapon states, into more [...] "useable" [...] configurations. The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute suggests that this is creating a culture where use of these weapons is more acceptable and therefore is increasing the risk of war, as these modern weapons do not possess the same psychological deterrent value as the large Cold-War era, multi-megaton warheads.|$|R
5000|$|Chávez also {{remained}} in power after an <b>all-out</b> national <b>strike</b> that lasted from December 2002 to February 2003, including a strike/lockout {{in the state}} oil company PDVSA. The strike produced severe economic dislocation, with the country's GDP falling 27% during {{the first four months}} of 2003, and costing the oil industry $13.3 billion. Capital flight before and during the strike led to the reimposition of currency controls (which had been abolished in 1989), managed by the CADIVI agency. In the subsequent decade, the government was forced into several currency devaluations. These devaluations have done little to improve the situation of the Venezuelan people who rely on imported products or locally produced products that depend on imported inputs while dollar-denominated oil sales account {{for the vast majority of}} Venezuela's exports. The profits of the oil industry have been lost to [...] "social engineering" [...] and corruption, instead of investments needed to maintain oil production.|$|R

50|$|Having {{pledged to}} {{reestablish}} the Jedi Order by finding any surviving Jedi in the galaxy, Luke Skywalker returns to Pinnacle Base on Da Soocha V with Kam Solusar, a former Dark Jedi. Beltane tips the Rebel Alliance of {{a shipment of}} new Vipers bound for the Empire's Deep Core stronghold of Byss, and Alliance commanders accept Wedge Antilles' suggestion of intercepting the shipment for a surgical strike using the droids, with Rebel commandos in the attack. Although Luke presses for liberating more worlds to provide more staging areas for an <b>all-out</b> <b>strike</b> on Byss, Mon Mothma asks him to concentrate on rebuilding the Jedi Order instead. The Jedi Holocron educates Luke about the planet Ossus, a former Jedi-populated world destroyed by the Sith thousands of years earlier.|$|E

50|$|In 1935, the Northern Rhodesian {{government}} {{proposed to}} increase the rates of tax paid by African miners working on the Copperbelt, while reducing it in rural areas. Although the Provincial Commissioners had been told about the change on 11 January 1935, {{it was not until}} 20 May that the Native Tax Amendment Ordinance was signed, with rates implemented as of 1 January 1935. This retrospective increase outraged the miners, who already had grievances about low pay and poor conditions, and also with the Pass laws which had been introduced in 1927 and required Africans to have permits to live and work on the Copperbelt. It provoked an <b>all-out</b> Copperbelt <b>strike</b> which lasted from 22 May to 25 May in three of the four mines in the area, namely Mufulira, Nkana and Roan Antelope. British South Africa Police were sent from Southern Rhodesia to Nkana to suppress it. When, on 29 May, police in Luanshya attempted to disperse a group of Africans, violence erupted and six Africans were shot dead. The loss of life shocked both sides and the strike was suspended while a Commission of Inquiry was set up. It concluded that the way the increases were announced was the key factor, and that if they had been introduced calmly, they would have been accepted.|$|R
50|$|In the meantime, the Soviet {{troops in}} Alaska launch a final {{assault on the}} pumping station; however, the Soviet commander, {{concerned}} about the rapidly-growing prospect of nuclear war, requests a parley with Caffey. After an emotional conversation, the two men agree to discontinue the fighting. However, at that moment, one of the Soviet troops—perhaps an undercover KGB asset—suddenly hurls a grenade, which kills both men. The situation collapses in bloodshed, with a sergeant of the Alaskan Scouts managing to send one final message that the last American position is being overrun. Receiving this news, President McKenna calls the Soviet leadership and discovers that Gorny is unavailable to speak with him. The Soviet leadership claims Gorny has been felled by severe intestinal flu and that their forces will withdraw to pre-crisis positions, but McKenna does not believe them and realizes that pro-war elements of the KGB are seizing control of the Soviet Union. Once the telephone conference ends, McKenna submits to the National Security Council his belief that Gorny has been killed and that total war is imminent. He is correct, for at that moment, the coup leaders decide on an <b>all-out</b> nuclear <b>strike,</b> some of them mistakenly believing that U. S. law requires the President to obtain Congressional approval before an American nuclear attack. But President McKenna has already deduced the enemy strategy. Horrified and nearly in tears, he concludes the situation is unrecoverable, and orders a full nuclear counterstrike upon the Soviet Union.|$|R
50|$|After {{losing the}} {{previous}} 30 years' territorial gains in only six months, the desperate Narn High Command decided {{to launch an}} <b>all-out</b> <b>strike</b> against the main Centauri supply base at a planet called Gorash 7. The Narn hoped that by uniting most of their remaining warships into a single armada, they could destroy the Centauri supply base and force the Centauri to temporarily halt their advance. This would give the Narn time to regroup and rebuild their forces. The danger of this plan was that, {{in order to create}} a fleet large enough to make the assault, the defenses of the Narn homeworld were severely depleted, thereby leaving it open to attack if the Centauri discovered the Narn's plan. Unfortunately for the Narn Regime, the Centauri did indeed learn about the Narn strategy by intercepting and breaking their coded transmissions, and planned a decisive counter-attack to end the war with a massive assault on the Narn homeworld itself (Season 2 episode The Long, Twilight Struggle). Ambassador Mollari relayed the information to the Shadows, and so five Shadow warships were waiting for the Narn fleet at Gorash 7. Although the Narn fought heroically, in a battle lasting only a few minutes the entire Narn armada was completely destroyed, and hundreds of Narn heavy cruisers and fighters were lost. Not a single Shadow vessel was destroyed (although one did receive minor damage).|$|E

50|$|The {{main problem}} for TF 58 was {{locating}} the enemy, {{who had been}} operating at a great distance. Early-morning American searches on June 20 found nothing. An extra mid-day search flown by Hellcat fighter pilots also came back empty. Finally at 15:12 a garbled message from an Enterprise search plane indicated a sighting. At 15:40 the sighting was verified, along with distance, course, and speed. The Japanese fleet was 275 miles out, moving due west at a speed of 20 knots. The Japanese were at the limit of TF 58's strike range, and daylight was slipping away. Mitscher decided to launch an <b>all-out</b> <b>strike.</b> After the first attack group had launched, a third message arrived, indicating the Japanese fleet were 60 miles farther out than previously indicated. The first launch would be at their limits of fuel, {{and would have to}} attempt landing at night. Mitscher canceled the second launch of aircraft, but chose not to recall the first launch. Of the 240 planes that were launched for the strike, 14 aborted for various reasons and returned to their ships. The 226 planes that continued on consisted of 95 Hellcat fighters (some carrying 500-pound bombs), 54 Avenger torpedo bombers (only a few carrying torpedoes, the rest four 500-pound bombs) and 77 dive bombers (51 Helldivers and 26 Dauntlesses). The TF 58 aircraft arrived over the Japanese fleet just before sunset.|$|E
40|$|During March and April 2004 5, 000 local {{authority}} employed nursery nurses in Scotland {{were involved in}} a national <b>all-out</b> <b>strike.</b> A two and a half year dispute over pay was transformed into a struggle to maintain national bargaining in the face of employer attempts to impose local pay deals. Drawing on interviews with striking nursery nurses, this paper seeks to explore the factors that led to the largest <b>all-out</b> <b>strike</b> in Scotland since the Miners' Strike in the mid 1980 s. It is argued that the experiences of these nursery nurses highlight particular ways in which New Labour's welfare reforms, and its approach to pay and conditions in the public sector, are impacting on some of the most poorly paid groups of public sector workers, and in doing so suggest that this dispute has a much wider resonance beyond Scotland and beyond the nursery nurses' fight...|$|E
