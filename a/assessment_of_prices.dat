40|$|The major {{difficulties}} in assessing market power in electricity wholesale spot markets mean that great weight {{should be placed}} upon assessing market outcomes against the fundamental determinants of supply demand and competition. In this spirit we study whether the New Zealand market has been a national market or a set of local markets {{since its inception in}} 1996. Electricity markets generally have loop flows that require simultaneous <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>prices</b> at all nodes thereby limiting the informativeness of pair-wise nodal comparisons. We introduce principal component analysis to this application and show that it is a natural tool for the qualitative and quantitative assessment of the presence of local markets. We find that increased competition induced some separation into local markets that was eliminated by transmission enhancement and the introduction of generation downstream from the constrained circuits. For most of the period New Zealand has had one national market...|$|E

40|$|Price squeeze abuses {{lie at the}} {{crossroad}} {{between different}} forms of potentially anticompetitive conduct, {{as well as between}} antitrust law and regulation. The main question that has arisen in the academic debate and actual practice is whether a combination of a lawful wholesale price and a non-predatory retail price can be characterized as exclusionary conduct based on the analysis of the margin between the two prices. In the paper, we argue that {{there is no need for}} a separate price squeeze theory under antitrust law. Assuming that the costs of supplying an input to rivals and to internal downstream divisions do not differ, a <b>price</b> squeeze capable <b>of</b> excluding equally efficient competitors may arise only from upstream discrimination (discriminatory price squeeze) or downstream predation (predatory price squeeze). However, when the downstream division of the dominant firm is not a separate legal entity, distinguishing discriminatory and predatory price squeezes may turn out to be impossible, as internal transfer charges are absent in many concrete settings of vertical integration. In these cases, an analytical framework for the <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>price</b> squeeze cases can be useful, provided that it is intended as an operational tool aimed at detecting anticompetitive conduct of a discriminatory or predatory nature, which is not directly observable. Instead of mimicking regulatory tools and criteria, the analytical framework for the <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>price</b> squeeze cases should be construed in accordance with basic principles of competition law and traditional doctrines of antitrust liability. This approach strongly supports the application of principles on refusal to deal to price squeeze cases and the use of the equally efficient competitor test to ascertain whether a given pricing policy is anticompetitive...|$|R

30|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{quantitative}} value chain analysis {{focuses on the}} price a customer {{is willing to pay}} for a firm’s output (Keyser 2006). The <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>price</b> along a value chain is attained by considering the vertical margins, which are the differences between prices at different nodes of the chain and represents the ration <b>of</b> the final <b>price</b> absorbed by the producers, traders, processors and other chain participants (Kirimi et al. 2011). In the event of information asymmetry in the value chain, ineffective market functioning arises due to lack of trust among the participants. This frequently leads to overpriced inputs and underpriced output (Rota and Sperandini 2010). The farm-level competitiveness of grass seed production may be determined by the use of the value chain analysis software from the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) to conduct financial analysis.

40|$|This study {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} several recently published methods for quantifying the uncertainty in economic evaluations due to uncertainty in future oil prices. Conventional price forecasting methods used in the industry typically underestimate the range of uncertainty in oil and gas price forecasts. These forecasts traditionally consider pessimistic, most-likely, and optimistic cases {{in an attempt to}} quantify economic uncertainty. The recently developed alternative methods have their unique strengths as well as weaknesses that may affect their applicability in particular situations. While stochastic methods can improve the <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>price</b> uncertainty they can also be tedious to implement. The inverted hockey stick method is found to be an easily applied alternative to the stochastic methods. However, the primary basis for validating this method {{has been found to be}} unreliable. In this study, a consistent and reliable validation of uncertainty estimates predicted by the inverted hockey stick method is presented. Verifying the reliability of this model will ensure reliable quantification of economic uncertainty. Although we cannot eliminate uncertainty from investment evaluations, we can better quantify the uncertainty by accurately predicting the volatility in future oil and gas prices. Reliably quantifying economic uncertainty will enable operators to make better decisions and allocate their capital with increased efficiency...|$|R

40|$|The main aim of {{this article}} is to find out whether there is a {{significant}} relationship between money supply growth and inflation in the Eurozone. For this reason, the monetary policy strategy of the European Central Bank (ECB) has been evaluated. Since the establishment of the ECB in January 1999 to May 2003 the ECB‘s monetary policy strategy consisted of three main elements: a quantitative definition <b>of</b> <b>price</b> stability, a prominent role for money in the <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> risks to <b>price</b> stability (aggregate M 3 as a reference value), and a broadly based <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> the outlook for price developments. Nevertheless, since May 2003 M 3 or any other monetary aggregate has lost its prominent role in the ECB‘s strategy. Therefore the nowadays ECB‘s monetary policy strategy consists of a quantitative definition of the primary objective <b>of</b> <b>price</b> stability and an analytical framework based on two pillars – economic analysis and monetary analysis. These two pillars are used by the ECB‘s Governing Council in the overall <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> risks to <b>price</b> stability and in monetary policy decisions.

In modern economic conditions we need to strengthen managerial decisions on the choice and carrying out price policy and a means of solving this problem is accounting. To determine the boundaries and competence of decision-making we analyzed the regulation of these terms and processes, {{as well as the}} dynamics of the stocks across sectors of the economy, the consumer price index, producer price index, the <b>price</b> index <b>of</b> realization of industrial products.

In the study <b>of</b> <b>pricing</b> policies in respect of goods in accounting and analytical aspect, we have established the following. The existing normative-legal acts and definitions of researchers on economic and accounting analysis of the concept give a sufficiently wide interpretation, which depends on the orientation and activity of the enterprise.

To obtain a more realistic <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> the <b>pricing</b> <b>of</b> its product it would be benefit if the interest rates are fluctuating. This paper compares actuarial quantities which calculated based on fixed interest rate to stochastic interest rate using the Vasicek and the Cox, Ingersoll and Ross financial valuation models. In this case, time to maturity in financial valuation models is adjusted with T(x), a continuous random variable representing future lifetime of a life-aged-x. T(x) is obtained through simulation based on Gompertz Mortality Law. By means of Monte Carlo simulation we calculate actuarial quantity under whole life insurance and give empirical results. Furthermore, we quantify Wang’s Transform risk measure with respect of loss distribution.
