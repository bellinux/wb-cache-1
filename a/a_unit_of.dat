5|$|As {{a strong}} acid, HCl {{has a large}} Ka. Theoretical {{attempts}} to assign a Ka to HCl have been made.

For intermediate to concentrated solutions of hydrochloric acid, the assumption that H+ molarity (<b>a</b> <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> concentration) equals HCl molarity is excellent, agreeing to four significant digits.|$|E
