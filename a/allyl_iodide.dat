In addition, a brief introduction to chiral base methodology and a review of the latest developments is included. Chapter Two describes the generation of bridgehead enolates in various bridged bicyclic ketones using chiral and achiral lithium amide bases and their subsequent interception with chlorotrimethylsilane. The chiral bridgehead silanes resulting from enantioselective deprotonation were shown to undergo silyl exchange reactions with TBAT as fluoride source in the presence of various electrophiles. Chapter Three describes a review of bridgehead enolates of imides and describes the extension of the developed methodology in Chapter Two to the generation and trapping of bridgehead enolates in bridged bicyclic imides and lactams. In addition bridgehead enolates are shown to react in the presence of non-classical in situ electrophiles such as methyl <b>iodide,</b> <b>allyl</b> bromide, benzyl bromide, prenyl bromide and pivaloyl chloride in high yield and enantioselectivity.

Accordingly, if catalytic amounts of indium can be used in organic reactions, its usefulness and versatility should remarkably be increased. Recently, aqueous allylation reactions using a catalytic amount of InCl 3 3 and indium-catalyzed allylation reaction were reported. 4 Despite the recent progress, there is still strong need for various and efficient indium-catalyzed organic reactions.

To unravel why this is the case, the gas-phase reactions of <b>allyl</b> <b>iodide</b> with the coinage metal dimethylmetallates, [CH 3 MCH 3] − (M = Cu, Ag and Au), were examined under the near thermal conditions of an ion trap mass spectrometer and via electronic structure calculations. [CH 3 CuCH 3] − reacted with <b>allyl</b> <b>iodide</b> with a reaction efficiency of 6. 6 % of the collision rate to yield: I – (75 %); the cross-coupling product, [CH 3 CuI] − (24 %); and the homo-coupling product, [C 3 H 5 CuI] − (1 %). [CH 3 AgCH 3] − and [CH 3 AuCH 3] − reacted substantially slower (reaction efficiencies of 0. 028 % and 0. 072 %). [CH 3 AgCH 3] − forms I – (19 %) and [CH 3 AgI] − (81 %), while only I – is formed from [CH 3 AuCH 3] −. Because the experiments do not detect the neutral product(s) formed, which might otherwise help identify the mechanisms of reaction, and to rationalize the observed ionic products and reactivity order, calculations at the B 3 LYP/def 2 -QZVP//B 3 LYP/SDD 6 - 31 +G(d) level were conducted on four different mechanisms: (i) S N 2; (ii) S N 2 ′; (iii) oxidative-addition/reductive elimination (OA/RE) via an M(III) η 3 -allyl intermediate; and (iv) OA/RE via an M(III) η 1 -allyl intermediate. For copper, mechanisms (iii) and (iv) are predicted to be competitive. Only the Cu(III) η 3 -allyl intermediate undergoes reductive elimination via two different transition states to yield either the cross-coupling or the homo-coupling products. Their relative barriers are consistent with homo-coupling being a minor pathway. For silver, the kinetically most probable pathway is the S N 2 reaction, consistent with no homo-coupling product, [C 3 H 5 AgI] −, being observed. For gold, no C–C coupling reaction is kinetically viable. Instead, I – is predicted to be formed along with a stable Au(III) η 3 -allyl complex.

The second part describes a study on copper-catalyzed α-substitution of enantiomerically pure secondary allylic esters. It was observed that the degree of chirality transfer is strongly dependent on the reaction temperature. The loss of chiral information is consistent with an equilibration of the allylCu(III) intermediates prior to product formation, which is essential in order to realize a copper-catalyzed dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation process.

40|$|Organic {{radicals}} {{have been}} of interest for several decades due to various applications in fields such as drug design, polymer science, organic materials and synthesis. While the chemical properties of many aromatic σ-type mono- and biradicals are known through theoretical and experimental research, limited experimental data are available for aromatic polyradicals due to difficulties in their generation and subsequent study in solution. This thesis focuses on the reactivities of such polyradicals in the gas phase. All gas-phase reactivity studies were performed using a Thermo Scientific linear quadrupole ion trap (LQIT) mass spectrometer equipped with a manifold for introduction of reagents. All radical precursors were introduced into the LQIT and protonated by using the atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) method. Radical sites were generated by using collision-activated dissociation (CAD) of protonated radical precursors with helium collision gas to cleave C-I, C-NO 2, O-NO and/or O-CH 3 bonds. After generation, the charged polyradicals were isolated in the ion trap and their reactivities toward dimethyl disulfide, cyclohexane and <b>allyl</b> <b>iodide</b> were examined to determine reaction efficiencies and reaction products. ^ The reactivities of the tri- and tetraradicals were {{compared with those of}} corresponding mono- and biradicals. The reactivity of the studied triradicals is mainly controlled by the radicals’ electron affinity and the distortion energy of the meta-benzyne moiety in them. The triradicals with higher electron affinity and lower distortion energy reacted at higher efficiencies. All triradicals abstract three hydrogen atoms when allowed to react with cyclohexane, which demonstrates the presence of three radical sites. All triradicals formed ionized dimethyl disulfide of m/z 94 when allowed to react with dimethyl disulfide reagent, which was rationalized by initial proton transfer from the charged triradicals to neutral dimethyl disulfide, followed by hydrogen atom abstraction by the neutral triradicals from protonated dimethyl disulfide. ^ The 2, 4, 6, 8 -tetraradical abstracts four hydrogen atoms from cyclohexane, which demonstrates the presence of four radical sites in this molecule, as expected. Along with hydrogen atom abstractions, the 2, 4, 6, 8 -tetraradical also reacts by hydride abstraction, for which a mechanism was proposed. Additionally, reactivity studies of three other tetraradicals, the 2, 4, 5, 7 -, 2, 4, 5, 8 - and 2, 4, 7, 8 - tetradehydroquinlinium cations, were carried out by using dimethyl disulfide and <b>allyl</b> <b>iodide</b> reagents. Preliminary data suggest that, with few exceptions, the reaction efficiencies of the all tetraradicals are lower than that of related mono- and triradicals, which may be attributed to strong radical-radical couplings present in the tetraradicals. ^ A new class of charged quinoline based oxygen peribridged quinolinium cation was generated by using LQIT. These oxygen peribridged quinolinium cation was generated by using CAD to cleave an iodine atom and NO from protonated 4 - iodo- 5 -nitroquinoline precursor. A similar approach was used to generate oxygen peribridged quinolinium mono- and biradicals from synthesized precursors. Gasphase reactivity studies of these oxygen peribridged mono- and biradicals toward dimethyl disulfide and <b>allyl</b> <b>iodide</b> reagents were carried out and the reactivities were compared with the corresponding mono- and biradicals without the oxygen ring. The reactivity data suggest that the oxygen ring significantly influences the reactivity of biradicals, while comparable reactivity was observed for monoradicals with and without the oxygen ring. ^ Mimicking the self-assembly process of natural collagen is an interesting area of research for biomedical applications. One such design, based on a metaltrigger as a promoter for self-assembly of short collagen-mimetic peptides into functional biomaterials, is an attractive approach to address the inherent issues associated with the clinical use of natural collagen. In this approach, metal ions are allowed to interact with the chelating agents (ligands) of the peptides to promote self-assembly. Part of this thesis focuses on improving the understanding of the self-assembly mechanism by altering the ligands of the peptides. The number and type of ligands involved in the assembly process were shown to significantly influence the size and the morphology of the resulting materials. Self-assembly was controlled by limiting the number of ligands present in the peptide. ...|$|E

PFB, PFT and NVP were found to produce surface photopolymers, similar to their plasma polymers, suggesting that the polymerisation proceeds via an excited state mechanism.

Plasma mass spectroscopy also suggested that neutral species were largely responsible for the plasma polymerisation of PFB, but that ionic species were important in the plasma polymerisation of benzene. Considerable gas phase interaction was observed in a mixed benzene/PFB plasma. Plasma polymers containing a high concentration of -COOH were formed from a variety of carboxylic acids, by using low power and high flow rate conditions, but methyl methacrylate and acetic acid did not retain their carboxylate groups under similar conditions.

The solution generated lithium stannide mixtures were composed of Sn (0), LiSn 2, LiSn, and Li 5 Sn 2. Lithium stannide mixtures successfully performed the reductive cleavage of carbon-halogen bonds in aryl halide substrates. Diethylamine was required for the reductive cleavage of electron withdrawing groups, such as ester and nitrile, substituted aryl halides. ^ Lithium stannide mixtures were also used to initiate Li-Barbier reactions with aldehydes and ketones at room temperature with moderate to good yields.

The radioactive iodine containing products are sufficiently stable to allow their storage for later use. Due to their volatility the liquid species can be easily converted into gaseous species and thus {{can be used in}} research in liquid and gaseous phase. The primary motivation for the development of these synthesis methods is to study the behaviour of volatile iodine species under the conditions of a severe nuclear accident in a light water reactor.

Teknopox Aqua VA epoxy paint, which is used in Swedish light water reactor containments, and its reactions with the produced iodine species are described. The synthesised iodine species undergo chemisorption on paint films. Different to elemental iodine, the organic iodides are non-reactive with copper surfaces. The sorbed iodine species are partly re-released mainly in form of organic iodides and not as elemental iodine when the exposed paint films are heat treated.

40|$|This {{research}} probes {{the factors}} that control radical reactions of charged phenyl radicals in the gas phase by using FT-ICR mass spectrometry. In the first two studies, the ability of differently substituted phenyl radicals to abstract an iodine atom from <b>allyl</b> <b>iodide</b> and a hydrogen atom from tetrahydrofuran and tributyltin hydride was systematically examined. Neutral electron-withdrawing substituents were found to increase the reaction efficiencies by lowering {{the energy of the}} transition state. The extent of rate enhancement depends on the type and number of substituents, as well as their location relative to the radical site. Computational results indicate that variations in the transition state energy are explained by polar effects arising from a stabilizing charge transfer resonance structure of the transition state, rather than by variations in the thermodynamic driving force. In the third study, substituent effects on radical-radical recombination reactions were explored. While substituents do not have a major influence on the recombination efficiency, presumably due to a low reaction barrier, the product distribution is greatly impacted. The fourth study focuses on hydrogen atom abstraction and addition-elimination reactions of phenyl radicals with 1, 4 -cyclohexadiene. The different fragmentation mechanisms of the addition-elimination reactions are discussed. The fifth study examines the effects of the type of the charge site on reactions of substituted phenyl radicals. The results lead to the prediction that neutral phenyl radicals are likely to show similar substituent effect trends. Additionally, the effects of substituents on the reactions of a phenyl radical containing a negative charge site are examined. In the final study, the above approaches were applied to the reactions of phenyl radicals with amino acids and small peptides. ...|$|E

While very good diastereoselectivities were achieved (83 - 88 % d. e.) in these reactions, the material yields from reaction with the secondary alkyl iodides were low (31 - 35 %) due, presumably, to their decreased electrophilicity. Computer modelling studies of the enolate were carried out and support the hypothesis of endo attack by the electrophile on the enolate intermediate. These studies also indicate the possibility of coordination ofthe postassium cation to the endocyclic ester oxygen, thus effectively anchoring the bulky cation away from the reaction site. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{the work}} {{presented}} here, we used photofragment translational spectroscopy and H atom Rydberg time-of-flight (HRTOF) spectroscopy {{to study the}} primary photofragmentation channels of <b>allyl</b> <b>iodide</b> excited at 193 nm and the ensuing dissociation of the nascent allyl radicals {{as a function of}} their internal energy. Two C-I bond fission channels were found to produce the allyl radical, one channel forming I(2 P 3 / 2) and the other forming I(2 P 1 / 2). The nascent allyl radicals are dispersed {{as a function of the}} translational energy imparted from the photolysis and therefore by their internal energy. Although all of the I(2 P 3 / 2) and a portion of the I(2 P 1 / 2) channel allyl radical products have enough internal energy to overcome the 60 kcal/mol barrier to form allene + H, the data showed that a substantial fraction of the allyl radicals from the I(2 P 1 / 2) channel that formed with internal energies as high as 15 kcal/mol above the 60 kcal/mol barrier were stable to H atom loss. The stability is due to centrifugal effects caused by significant rotational energy imparted to the allyl radical during photolysis and the small impact parameter and reduced mass characterizing the loss of an H atom from an allyl radical to form allene + H. A photoionization efficiency (PIE) curve identified the major C 3 H 4 secondary dissociation products as allene. Comparison of the mass 40 signal in the TOF spectra at two photoionization energies showed that branching to H + propyne does not occur at near-threshold internal energies, indicating that the experimentally determined allyl f 2 -propenyl radical isomerization barrier, which is lower than recent ab initio calculations of the barrier by 15 kcal/mol, is far too low...|$|E
40|$|Allylic {{alkylation}} of organocuprates {{represents an}} important class of C–C bond forming reactions. A drawback of these reactions is their stoichiometric nature. Although metal-catalyzed decarboxylative coupling reactions offer {{new opportunities for}} formation of C–C bonds, catalytic allylic alkylation reactions of organocuprates have not been previously reported. Here, multistage mass spectrometry experiments performed on ion trap mass spectrometers in conjunction with electronic structure calculations are used {{to demonstrate that the}} dimethylcuprate anion, [CH 3 CuCH 3] −, can catalyze decarboxylative coupling of allyl acetate in the gas phase via a simple two-step catalytic cycle. In step 1, [CH 3 CuCH 3] − undergoes a cross-coupling reaction with allyl acetate to yield [CH 3 CuO 2 CCH 3] − as the major product ion. Step 2 involves subjecting the product ion to collision-induced decarboxylation to re-form [CH 3 CuCH 3] −, thereby closing the catalytic cycle. Since the details of step 2 have been previously described (Rijs, N.; Khairallah, G. N.; Waters, T.; O’Hair, R. A. J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2008, 130, 1069 − 1079), here the focus is on step 1. Comparison of the reactivity of dimethylcuprate toward allylic susbtrates reveals that while allyl acetate reacts around 70 times more slowly than <b>allyl</b> <b>iodide,</b> it is more selective for cross-coupling. This is rationalized by DFT calculations, which reveal that an increase in kinetic barrier is responsible for both reactivity trends. The lowest energy path was found to involve a stepwise π-oxidative addition proceeding via an η 2 -C 3 H 5 O 2 CCH 3 intermediate and extrusion of a leaving group (LG) anion, followed by a reductive elimination where this LG is recomplexed to the copper center. Finally, DFT calculations were used to shed light on the role of leaving groups LG = CH 3 CO 2 –, I –, Br –, Cl – in the allylic alkylation. While selectivity is indeed achieved at the cost of reactivity, the LG effects were more complex than can be accounted for by a simple consideration of the anion proton affinity (APA) of the LG...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the construction of}} a novel, low-noise laser kinetics spectrometer. A quasi-CW (picosecond pulse), tunable Ti:Sapphire laser is used to detect various transient species in laser flash photolysis kinetics experiments via direct absorption. The spectral range of the laser, when used with a harmonic generator, covers most of the visible wavelength region, allowing for the detection of a wide array of organic radical species. Paired with a temperature-and pressure-controlled flow reactor equipped with a Herriott-type optical multiple pass cell, transient absorptions of ~ 0. 0001 can be measured, corresponding to cross section - concentration products of less than 1 x 10 - 7 cm". The flexibility and high sensitivity of this instrument allows direct and accurate measurement of many important transient intermediates in combustion and atmospheric chemistry. Using this instrument, we report the self-reaction rate coefficient of vinyl and allyl radicals. Vinyl iodide and <b>allyl</b> <b>iodide</b> are used as precursors to generate respective radicals via laser-flash photolysis at 266 nm. Second order chemical reactions require an accurate determination of the initial radical concentration, which we determined using direct laser absorption by I atom at 1315 nm. The current study finds the self-reaction rate constant for vinyl radical {{to be more than a}} factor of two slower than previous studies and allyl self reaction rate constant to be 50 % faster than values reported in the literature. The absorption cross sections of the vinyl radical at 404, 423. 2, & 445 nm and allyl radical at 404 & 408 nm are also determined. This thesis also reports measurements of rate coefficients for the reaction of vinyl radical with various alkenes: ethylene, propene, isobutene, 1 -butene, and 2 -butene,performed over a temperature range of 300 K to 700 K at 100 Torr. The measured vinyl radical disappearance rates compare well with ab initio quantum calculations. The combined measurements and calculations provide improved estimates for other vinyl + alkene reactions. by Huzeifa Ismail. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|The {{ability to}} discern and {{understand}} the time evolution of both molecular and electronic structure during a chemical reaction in real-time, and with atomic-scale sensitivity, is a primary goal of modern chemical dynamics research. In this dissertation, femtosecond extreme ultraviolet/soft x-ray transient absorption spectroscopy is developed on a table-top apparatus and applied to investigate the evolution of both vibrational and electronic degrees of freedom in molecules following photoexcitation or ionization. Several molecular systems are considered in detail. In the first study, the strong-field ionization of a heteronuclear diatomic molecule, IBr, and the ensuing vibrational wavepacket dynamics in the electronic ground state of the neutral molecule are characterized with atomic-site sensitivity. The element-specificity of the core-level transient absorption technique is further extended to investigate the multichannel ultraviolet photodissociation reaction of bromoiodomethane, CH 2 IBr. The core-to-valence absorption spectrum of the bromomethyl radical, CH 2 Br, which is formed via the major C-I photodissociation coordinate at 266 nm, is characterized for the first time. The measured C-I dissociation time (~ 50 fs) differs significantly from the C-Br dissociation time (~ 110 fs), which indicates {{that more than one}} excited-state surface is involved. In the third study, the evolution of the transient valence electronic structures in the transition state regions of both the methyl and <b>allyl</b> <b>iodide</b> photodissociation reactions are directly observed and characterized. As the C-I bond is breaking, new 4 d(I) core-to-valence resonances localized on the I atom are observed and assigned to repulsive valence-excited transition-state regions. The transition-state resonances directly probe the evolving valence electronic structure during these fundamental bond-breaking reactions. Finally, a full-scale apparatus upgrade was undertaken to extend the femtosecond light source into the soft x-ray energy domain up to and beyond 300 eV. With this new setup, the first femtosecond soft x-ray transient absorption experiments at the carbon K-edge (~ 284 eV) are performed. In particular, the ultrafast electrocyclic ring-opening reaction of 1, 3 -cyclohexadiene is investigated and the evolution of the valence electronic structure during the ~ 180 fs ring-opening process is directly captured. The core-to-valence spectroscopic signatures of the elusive transient intermediate excited states, which lead to ring-opening, are characterized, in combination with time-dependent density functional theory calculations, to reveal overlap and mixing of the frontier valence orbital energy levels...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{describes the}} evolution of a large-scale synthetic campaign directed at the total synthesis (+) -spongistatin 1, one of the most potent and architecturally complex antitumor marine macrolides discovered to date. ^ Chapter one provides an introduction to the spongistatin family of natural products. Specifically, the isolation, structure elucidation, and biological activity of the spongistatins are discussed. Furthermore, relevant synthetic approaches toward the spongistatins are delineated. * ^ Chapter two provides a critical analysis of our previous syntheses of the spongistatins {{in the form of a}} detailed retrosynthesis, and describes our latest synthetic strategy for overcoming the deficiencies associated with our earlier work. The (+) -spongistatin 1 macrolide framework was assembled via Wittig union of an EF phosphonium salt and an ABCD aldehyde. For construction of the advanced ABCD fragment, disconnection at the C(15) -C(16) aldol linkage revealed the AB aldehyde and CD ketone. The linear precursors of both spiroketal moieties were assembled in a highly efficient manner via methods developed in our laboratories, namely the three component union of 2 -silyl- 1, 3 -dithianes with terminal epoxides. * ^ As anticipated from the precedent set forth by Evans, aldol union of the AB and CD fragments proceeded in both good yield (72 %) and with high selectivity (9 : 1). The complex aldol reaction was ultimately performed on a 2 g scale; approximately 5 g of coupled product were prepared. The synthesis of the advanced ABCD aldehyde was achieved with a longest linear sequence of 22 steps (6. 5 % overall yield) and is 15 steps shorter than our previous synthesis. * ^ Chapters three and four describe our long-standing efforts toward an efficient and scalable synthesis of the EF Wittig salt. The difficulty in this regard lies in the installation of the highly sensitive chlorodiene side chain moiety present in (+) -spongistatin 1. In response, we have developed a novel method for side chain introduction via cyanohydrin alkylation. Construction of the EF bis-tetrahydropyran subunit was achieved via dithiane alkylation to an F-ring aldehyde, using chelation control to establish the requisite C(38) stereochemistry. * ^ Successful installation of the chlorodiene side chain was achieved via cyanohydrin alkylation of an appropriately functionalized EF bis-tetrahydropyran <b>allyl</b> <b>iodide.</b> Subsequent synthetic operations, involving cyanohydrin hydrolysis, elimination to afford the diene moiety, asymmetric ketone reduction, and phosphonium salt formation completed the synthesis of the EF Wittig salt. * (Abstract shortened by UMI.) ^ *Please refer to dissertation for diagrams. ...|$|E
40|$|The homocuprates [MeCuMe] - and [EtCuEt] - were {{generated}} in the gas phase by double decarboxylation of the copper carboxylate centers [MeCO 2 CuO 2 CMe] - and [EtCO 2 CuO 2 CEt] -, respectively. The same strategy was explored for generating the heterocuprates [MeCuR] - from [MeCO 2 CuO 2 CR] - (R = Et, Pr, i Pr, t Bu, allyl, benzyl, Ph). The formation of these organocuprates was examined by multistage mass spectrometry experiments, including collision-induced dissociation and ion−molecule reactions, and theoretically by density functional theory. A number of side reactions were observed to be in competition with {{the second stage of}} decarboxylation, including loss of the anionic carboxylate ligand and loss of neutral alkene via β-hydride transfer elimination. Interpretation of decarboxylation of the heterocarboxylates [MeCO 2 CuO 2 CR] - was more complex because of the possibility of decarboxylation occurring at either of the two different carboxylate ligands and giving rise to the possible isomers [MeCuO 2 CR] - or [MeCO 2 CuR] -. Ion−molecule reactions of the products of initial decarboxylation with <b>allyl</b> <b>iodide</b> resulted in C−C coupling to produce the ionic products [ICuO 2 CR] - or [MeCO 2 CuI] -, which provided insights into the relative population of the isomers, and indicated that the site of decarboxylation was dependent on R. For example, [MeCO 2 CuO 2 C t Bu] - underwent decarboxylation at MeCO 2 - to give [MeCuO 2 C t Bu] -, while [MeCO 2 CuO 2 CCH 2 Ph] - underwent decarboxylation at PhCH 2 CO 2 - to give [MeCO 2 CuCH 2 Ph] -. Each of the heterocuprates [MeCuR] - (R = Et, Pr, i Pr, allyl, benzyl, Ph) could be generated by the double decarboxylation strategy. However, when R = t Bu, intermediate [MeCuO 2 C t Bu] - only underwent loss of t BuCO 2 -, a consequence of the steric bulk of t Bu disfavoring decarboxylation and stabilizing the competing channel of carboxylate anion loss. Detailed DFT calculations were carried out on the potential energy surfaces for the first and second decarboxylation reactions of all homo- and heterocuprates, as well as possible competing reactions. These reveal that in all cases the first decarboxylation reaction is favored over loss of the carboxylate ligand. In contrast, other reactions such as carboxylate ligand loss and β-hydride transfer become more competitive with the second decarboxylation reaction...|$|E
40|$|Organic mono- and polyradicals play an {{important}} role in a variety of fields including organic synthesis, materials science, and biological activity of organic compounds. Several studies have been published on σ-type carbon-centered mono-, bi- and triradicals. However, σ,σ,σ,σ-tetraradicals have not been investigated experimentally until know. ^ Four organic triradicals were studied in a FT-ICR mass spectrometry in order to enhance the knowledge of σ,σ,σ-triradicals and achieve greater understanding of their reactivity controlling factors. These didehydropyridine radical cations, the carbon-nitrogen (CN) ortho -pyridyne moiety is the same and the third radical site is located at different sites in the pyridine ring. The structures of these triradicals were confirmed by using structurally diagnostic ion-molecule reactions [...] An examination of the observed reactivity provides insights into the electronic structure and the most reactive sites of these triradicals wich results indicate the presence of a highly reactive ortho-benzyne moiety in these triradicals, which does not undergo radical reactions. Most of these reactions are thought to be initiated by nucleophilic attack on the C 2 position of the benzyne by the neutral reagents. Radical reactions were also observed for these triradicals, abstract an iodine atom form <b>allyl</b> <b>iodide</b> was observed. This observation can be explained by the presence of an unpaired electron in all resonance structures of these triradicals. These triradicals can be viewed as a combination of a reactive ortho-benzyne and a less reactive monoradical. ^ This dissertation report the first reactivity study on an organic σ,σ,σ,σ-tetraradical, the positively charged 2, 4, 6 -tridehydropyridine radical cation, an analogue of the elusive 1, 2, 3, 5 -tetradehydrobenzene. The reactivity of the σ,σ,σ,σ-tetraradical is compared to related tri-, bi- and monoradicals in a Fourier Transform-Ion Cyclotron Resonance (FT-ICR) mass spectrometer. Surprisingly, the tetraradical was found not to undergo radical reactions. This behavior is rationalized by resonance structures hindering fast radical reactions. This makes the cation highly electrophilic, and it rapidly reacts with many nucleophiles by quenching the N–C orthobenzyne moiety, thereby generating a relatively unreactive meta-benzyne analogue. ^ In addition to fundamental studies, as described above, mass spectrometry is also an extremely valuable tool in the field of structural elucidation of unknown compounds and analysis of complex mixtures. This dissertation report the utility of the pressure chemical ionization (APCI) and electrospray ionization (ESI) tandem mass spectrometry for MW determination and structural elucidation of oligosaccharides directly without sample pretreatment or derivatization and determination of linkage position of different isomeric disaccharides. All the analytes evaporated and ionized by ESI and APCI with the chloride anion dopant displayed an abundant chloride anion adduct with no fragmentation, including an oligosaccharide with a MW of 1458 Da. CAD of the chloride anion adducts of the sugars studied showed major loss of HCl. This specific loss can be used to verify that the fragmenting ion is a chloride anion adduct, and hence confirm the molecular weight (MW) of the analyte. These experiments, as well as MS 3 and MS 4 experiments on deprotonated sugars (formed upon loss of HCl from the chloride anion adduct) and their fragmentation products allow distinction of some isomers, including glucose and fructose, sucrose and cellobiose, and laminaripentose and cellopentose. ^ Tandem mass spectrometry was used also for the analysis and study of the fragmentation behavior of protonated molecules and molecular ions derived from molecules in crude oil refinery streams in order to be able to monitor the changes in the composition of refinery streams during processing. This was a joint project between Haldor Topsøe and the Kenttämaa laboratories. ...|$|E
