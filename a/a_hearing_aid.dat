40|$|Clinical audiologists at Utah State University {{have been}} using <b>a</b> master <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> as <b>a</b> basic part of <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> {{evaluation}} procedures. To ascertain {{the usefulness of the}} master <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> in predicting patient success with <b>a</b> wearable <b>hearing</b> <b>aid,</b> 20 subjects were given speech audiometric tests under the following conditions: (l) without amplification; (2) with the headset system of the master <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> (<b>a</b> system which utilizes chassis mounted microphones and external receivers of the type used with body-worn hearing aids); (3) with the ear-level system of the master <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> (<b>a</b> system which utilizes a microphone and receiver mounted in <b>an</b> ear-level <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> case); and (4) with <b>a</b> wearable ear-level <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> which had been previously selected for each subject on the basis of master <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> data. Using the ANOV procedure, statistically significant differences α=. 05) were found between the mean speech reception thresholds obtained under the three aided test conditions, but differences were not clinically significant. The mean speech reception thresholds a greed within 4. 0 dB. No significant difference was found between the mean speech discrimination scores obtained in quiet under the three aided test conditions.

The Authorised Biography of Gerry Anderson (2002), {{register}} a divergence from earlier Supermarionation productions that stems from The Secret Service being less [...] "American-orientated" [...] and comprising fewer action sequences. They consider it the [...] "most eccentric" [...] {{of all the}} Supermarionation series up to 1969, and the fusion of puppets and live actors the [...] "natural conclusion" [...] to the filming technique. The writers bestow particular praise on the characterisation of Mrs Appleby, whose ignorance of Unwin and Harding's involvement with British Intelligence adds to the comedy: for example, when Father Unwin speaks into his communications device that is disguised as <b>a</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>aid,</b> the housekeeper thinks that the apparently senile vicar is muttering to himself. The episodes [...] "A Question of Miracles", in which the miniaturised Matthew is dwarfed by articles of food and drink from a picnic basket, and [...] "Last Train to Bufflers Halt", whose plot concerns an unstoppable runaway train, are also well received.

500|$|While Pixar usually designs their {{characters}} to be caricatured, Carl {{was even more}} so, being only three heads high. He was not given elderly features such as liver spots or hair in his ears to keep him appealing, yet giving him wrinkles, pockmarks on his nose, <b>a</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>aid,</b> and a cane to make him appear elderly. Docter wanted to push a stylized feel, particularly the way Carl's head is proportioned: he has a squarish appearance to symbolize his containment within his house, while Russell is rounded like a balloon. The challenge on Up was making these stylized characters feel natural, although Docter remarked the effect came across better than animating the realistic humans from Toy Story, who suffered from the [...] "uncanny valley". Cartoonists Al Hirschfeld, Hank Ketcham, and George Booth influenced the human designs. Simulating realistic cloth on caricatured humans was harder than creating the 10,000 balloons flying the house. New programs were made to simulate the cloth and for Kevin's iridescent feathers. To animate old people, Pixar animators would study their own parents or grandparents and also watched footage of the Senior Olympics. The directors had various rules for Carl's movements: he could not turn his head more than 15–20degrees without turning his torso as well, nor could he raise his arms high. However, they also wanted him to grow more flexible {{near the end of}} the film, transforming into an [...] "action hero".|$|E

40|$|Determining the <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> {{parameter}} {{settings that}} optimally compensate for <b>a</b> patient’s <b>hearing</b> loss {{is critical for}} successful amplification. <b>As</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> signal processing has become more complex, the number of potential parameter combinations has become intractably large. In {{the face of this}} complexity, <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> parameter settings are most often determined by applying prescriptive formulae to the patient’s audiogram. In nearly all cases, these prescriptive formulae are designed to optimize a value that is derived from the long-term average spectrum of speech (such as SII [e. g., 1] or loudness [e. g., 2]). While these prescriptions take into account the spectral variations in speech, they largely neglect the temporal variations. Several lines of research indicate that accurate perception of temporal variations, especially the temporal envelope, might be particularly important for speech perception in individuals with hearing loss. With this in mind, we began to explore the development of <b>a</b> non-linear <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> prescription that takes into account both the temporal and the spectral variations of speech.
