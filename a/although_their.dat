5|$|Fish steaks are cut {{perpendicular}} to the spine and include bones. <b>Although</b> <b>their</b> delicate flesh requires quicker cooking than beef, steaks from swordfish, halibut, tuna, salmon and mahi-mahi can be grilled. They are frequently cooked whole or as fillets. Fish steaks may also be poached or baked using a court bouillon, wine or sauce or cooked en papillote.|$|E

5|$|Heterodontosauridae is {{a family}} of early ornithischian dinosaurs that were likely among the most basal (primitive) members of the group. <b>Although</b> <b>their</b> fossils are {{relatively}} rare and their group small in numbers, they lived across all continents except Australia and Antarctica for approximately 100 million years, from the Late Triassic to the Early Cretaceous.|$|E

5|$|Radiocarbon dating has {{established}} {{the dates of}} three of Mount Tambora's eruptions before the 1815 eruption, <b>although</b> <b>their</b> magnitudes are unknown. The estimated dates are sometime between 4110 and 3700 BC, around 3050 BC, and sometime between 590 and 890 AD. Each of them were explosive, central vent eruptions with similar characteristics, but the 590-890 AD eruption caused no pyroclastic flows.|$|E

5|$|The family Trogonidae {{includes}} the trogons and quetzals. Found in tropical woodlands worldwide, they feed on insects and fruit, and their broad bills and weak legs reflect their diet and arboreal habits. <b>Although</b> <b>their</b> flight is fast, they {{are reluctant to}} fly any distance. Trogons have soft, often colourful, feathers with distinctive male and female plumage.|$|E
5|$|There are {{two forms}} of the Javan slow loris, {{distinguished}} mainly by differences in hair length. These have occasionally been recognized as separate species, N.javanicus and N.ornatus, but are currently both classified as a single species, <b>although</b> <b>their</b> exact taxonomic status remains unclear.|$|E
5|$|A {{large number}} of civic or {{municipal}} botanical gardens were founded in the 19th and 20th centuries. These did not develop scientific facilities or programmes, but the horticultural aspects were strong and the plants often labelled. They were botanical gardens {{in the sense of}} building up collections of plants and exchanging seeds with other gardens around the world, <b>although</b> <b>their</b> collection policies were determined by those in day-to-day charge of them. They tended to become little more than beautifully maintained parks and were, indeed, often under general parks administrations.|$|E

5|$|A {{report in}} 2010 by Nekaris etal. {{reported}} that Laos, Cambodia, and Thailand {{were the primary}} exporters of slow lorises, with Singapore and Malaysia also involved. China and Indonesia were also known for international trade, <b>although</b> <b>their</b> local trade was more significant. Slow loris parts were typically exported from Thailand and Cambodia, but Malaysia and Singapore primarily exported live animals. The most noteworthy importer was Japan, followed by the United States and then the European Union. More than half of 400illegal imports were live animals (238), while the rest were either body parts (122) or unspecified (40).|$|E
5|$|After {{graduation}} {{the four}} go their separate ways, but they remain in contact through letters and regular visits, <b>although</b> <b>their</b> letters are {{read by the}} Securitate.

A fifth member, Tereza, befriends the narrator even as {{it becomes clear that}} she is acting partly on Pjele's orders.|$|E
5|$|<b>Although</b> <b>their</b> ranges overlap substantially, {{hybridisation}} between goldcrests and firecrests {{seems to}} be prevented by differences in courtship rituals and different facial patterns. Even in aviary studies in which a female goldcrest was given an artificial eyestripe to facilitate mating with a male firecrest, the chicks were never raised by the mixed pair, {{and appeared to be}} poorly adapted compared to the parent species.|$|E

5|$|Among fertile species, A.bradleyi {{most closely}} resembles its parent species A.montanum. Several {{characteristics}} exit to distinguish them: the pinnae of A.bradleyi are toothed and less deeply lobed or cut than A.montanum (where the pinnae are often fully cut to pinnules), the dark {{color of the}} stipe extends into the rachis, the upper pinnae lack stems, and the overall shape of the leaf blade is parallel-sided, rather than lance-shaped. A.bradleyi also shows some resemblance to black spleenwort (A.adiantum-nigrum) (<b>although</b> <b>their</b> ranges do not overlap). The latter may be identified by its distinctly triangular-shaped leaf blade, more deeply cut leaves (the pinnules of its basal pinnae are lobed), and enlarged , rather than acroscopic, pinnules.|$|E
5|$|An {{outbreak}} of a gastrointestinal illness in Spain which was causing mortalities in humans {{has been linked}} to western jackdaws. During a post-mortem on an affected bird, a polyomavirus was isolated from the spleen. The illness appeared to be a co-infection of this with Salmonella and the virus has been provisionally named the crow polyomavirus (CPyV). Segmented filamentous bacteria have been isolated from the small intestine of a western jackdaw, <b>although</b> <b>their</b> pathogenicity or role is unknown.|$|E

These roles are uniformed and also require training to achieve their Wood Badge, <b>although</b> <b>their</b> training content consists of the basic values of the association, safety and child protection, inclusion, camping and Scout skills and administration. They are also required to complete First Aid every three years.|$|E
