40|$|In {{this paper}} a linear cobweb model is {{developed}} {{to study the}} phenomenon of commodity price fluctuations and then a buffer stock incorporated into the model to stabilize the price of fresh tomatoes in Ghana. The model performed on the assumptions that fresh tomatoes have no equal substitutes, {{and that there is}} no foreign competition and also no exogenous shocks needed to generate price fluctuations. The analysis detected that the slope of the demand function of price was smaller than the slope of the supply function of price curve implying that the price and quantity supplied of the fresh tomatoes would oscillate around a fixed price and quantity and also spiral outward. The “Keep Supply at Average” (KSA) buffer scheme achieved price and quantity stability in the short run. The mean price of the scheme was GH¢ 17. 31, very close to actual price mean of Gh¢ 13. 40 in the first 16 quarters. The standard deviation of the scheme price also dropped to 1. 2 from 9. 13 during price stabilization compared to 14. 60 of actual price mean. In the long run the scheme price went up to Gh¢ 18. 22, an increase of Gh¢ 0. 91 and it is clear that in long run buffer system will fail unless the average supply is reviewed regularly. The scheme price trend equation indicated that with the implementation of the buffer scheme, the <b>average</b> <b>quarterly</b> <b>price</b> of fresh tomatoes increased by only 0. 05. </p...|$|E

The analysis combines two unique data sets, one containing opening dates of all US Wal-Mart stores and the other containing <b>average</b> <b>quarterly</b> retail <b>prices</b> of several narrowly-defined commonly-purchased goods over the period 1982 - 2002. I focus on 10 specific items likely to be sold at Wal-Mart stores and analyze their price dynamics in 165 US cities before and after Wal-Mart entry. An instrumental-variables specification corrects for measurement error in Wal-Mart entry dates. I find robust price effects for several products, including shampoo, toothpaste, and laundry detergent; magnitudes vary by product and specification, but generally range from 1. 5 - 3 % {{in the short run}} and four times as much in the long-run.

40|$|Although {{the airline}} {{industry}} has drastically changed since its deregulation in 1978, publically available sources of data have remained nearly the same. In the U. S., most researchers and decision-makers rely on government data that contains highly aggregated price information (e. g., <b>average</b> <b>quarterly</b> <b>prices).</b> However, aggregate data can hide important market behavior. With the emergence of online distribution channels, {{there is a new}} opportunity to model air travel demand using detailed price information. 	 	This dissertation uses online prices and seat maps to build a dataset of daily prices and bookings at the flight-level. Several research contributions are made, all related to leveraging online data to better understand airline pricing and product strategies, and how these strategies impact customers, as well as the industry in general. One major contribution is the finding that the recent product debundling trend in the U. S. airline industry has diluted revenues to the U. S. Airport and Airways Trust Fund by at least five percent. 	Additionally, several new behavioral insights are found for one debundling trend that has been widely adopted by U. S. airlines: seat reservation fees. Customers are found to be between 2 and 3. 3 times more likely to purchase premium coach seats (with extra legroom and early boarding privileges) when there are no regular coach window or aisle seats that can be reserved for free, suggesting that the ability of airlines to charge seat fees is strongly tied to load factors. Model results are used to explore optimal seat fees and find that an optimal static fee could increase revenues by 8 percent, whereas optimal dynamic fees could increase revenues by 10. 2 percent. 	Another major contribution is in modeling daily bookings and estimating price elasticities using ordinary least squares (OLS) regression without correcting for price endogeneity and two-stage least squares (2 SLS) regression, which corrects for endogeneity. Results highlight the importance of correcting for price endogeneity (which is not often done in air travel applications). In particular, models that do not correct for endogeneity find inelastic demand estimates whereas models that do correct for endogeneity find elastic demand estimates. This is important, as pricing recommendations differ for inelastic and elastic models. A set of instrumental variables are found to pass validity tests and can be used to correct for price endogeneity in future models of daily flight-level demand. Ph. D...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background A rural {{pharmacy}} initiative (RPI) {{designed to}} increase access to medicines in rural Kyrgyzstan created a network of 12 pharmacies using a revolving drug fund mechanism in 12 villages where no pharmacies previously existed. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine if the establishment of the RPI resulted in the unforeseen benefit of triggering medicine price competition in pre-existing (non-RPI) private pharmacies located in the region. Methods We conducted descriptive and multivariate analyses on medicine insurance claims data from Kyrgyzstan's Mandatory Health Insurance Fund for the Jumgal District of Naryn Province from October 2003 to December 2007. We compared <b>average</b> <b>quarterly</b> medicine <b>prices</b> in competitor pharmacies before and after the introduction of the rural pharmacy initiative in October 2004 to determine the RPI impact on price competition. Results Descriptive analyses suggest competitors reacted to RPI prices for 21 of 30 (70 %) medicines. Competitor medicine prices from the quarter before RPI introduction to the end of the study period decreased for 17 of 30 (57 %) medicines, increased for 4 of 30 (13 %) medicines, and remained unchanged for 9 of 30 (30 %) medicines. Among the 9 competitor medicines with unchanged prices, five initially decreased in price but later reverted back to baseline prices.

Conclusions The RPI served as a market driver, spurring competition in medicine prices in competitor pharmacies, even when they were located in different villages.

40|$|International audienceIn this chapter, we {{characterize}} the dispersion of grocery prices in France {{based on a}} large original data set of prices in more than 1500 supermarkets across the country. On average across products, the 90 th percentile of relative prices is 17 percentage points higher than the 10 th. The mean absolute deviation from <b>quarterly</b> <b>average</b> product <b>prices</b> is 5 % on average in the French retail sector, and the standard deviation of relative prices is 7 %. We show that temporary sales and promotions offer a limited explanation of the observed price dispersion, while the permanent component of price dispersion largely dominates. We find that in France price dispersion across stores essentially results from persistent heterogeneity in retail chains’ national pricing. Indeed, consumer prices are largely determined at a national level by retail groups’ bargaining power with producers and by retail chains’ positioning. We also show, however, that local conditions regarding demand and local competition between supermarkets do explain prices observed in local markets, though to a much lower extent...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{employs the}} {{empirical}} mode decomposition (EMD) method to filter cyclical components of US quarterly {{gross domestic product}} (GDP) and <b>quarterly</b> <b>average</b> oil <b>price</b> (West Texas Intermediate [...] WTI). The method is adaptive and applicable to non-linear and non-stationary data. A correlation analysis of the resulting components is performed and examined for insights into the relationship between oil and the economy. Several components of this relationship are identified. However, the principal {{one is that the}} medium-run component of the oil price has a negative relationship with the main cyclical component of the GDP. In addition, weak correlations suggesting a lagging, demand-driven component and a long-run component of the relationship were also identified. Comparisons of these findings with significant oil supply disruption and recession dates were supportive. The study identifies a number of lessons applicable to recent oil market events, including the eventuality of persistent oil price and economic decline following a long oil price run-up. In addition, it was found that oil market related exogenous events are associated with short- to medium-run price implications regardless of whether they lead to actual supply losses.
