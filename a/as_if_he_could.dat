2500|$|In the meantime, Chad feels {{pressured}} to embrace his family. Deidrick said that Chad [...] "can't really {{turn away from}} family." [...] When Stefano and Chad's brother, EJ DiMera (James Scott) have a falling out, and his sister Lexie Carver (Renée Jones) is on her death bed, Chad {{seems to be the}} only DiMera left standing. Meanwhile, Gabi's advances start to affect Chad and it looks <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> reciprocate those feelings. Deidrick hinted that the triangle would turn [...] "ugly." [...] It is Lexie's passing and Stefano's presumed death that pushes Chad over the edge. For the first time, Deidrick allows for the character to cry. In an interview Soaps In Depth, Deidrick said that he used music to take Chad [...] "into the darkness." [...] The actor praised the writers for allowing him to flex his acting muscles by taking Chad to such unfamiliar territory.|$|E
60|$|Norman's lips quivered, and {{his face}} was pale--he seemed <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not speak.|$|E
60|$|Mordaunt smiled. It looked <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not speak, {{and while}} Carrie wiped Jim's face Jake beckoned Dick.|$|E
60|$|Alfred {{glowered at}} us <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> never <b>could,</b> or would, forgive the injury of that night.|$|R
60|$|But the man only {{shook his}} head and shrugged his {{shoulders}} and opened his mouth and gaped <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> really <b>could</b> not believe his own eyes.|$|R
60|$|Still Mr. Monday {{gazed at}} the mate <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> thought matters <b>could</b> not be much worse.|$|R
60|$|But {{her husband}} only {{shook his head}} and shrugged his {{shoulders}} <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not believe his own eyes.|$|E
60|$|Chebron {{gazed at}} his father <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> scarce credit his sense of hearing, while even Amuba looked surprised.|$|E
60|$|At that he wavered, and {{she heard}} his teeth sliding against each other, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> no longer clench them.|$|E
60|$|So Rollo {{went in to}} see. He {{found that}} Nathan had gone to work wrong. Instead of trying to drive the wedge into {{the end of the}} board, so as to split it along the grain, he had made the cleft with the knife {{in the side of the}} board, and was {{attempting}} to drive it in there, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> supposed <b>he</b> <b>could</b> split the board across the grain.|$|R
60|$|Lassiter {{spread wide}} his hands, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> to signify <b>he</b> <b>could</b> do no more, {{and his face}} clouded.|$|R
60|$|Such {{were the}} {{expressions}} with which Angelo Cyrus Bantam, Esquire, M.C., took Mr. Pickwick's hand; retaining it in his, meantime, and shrugging up his shoulders with a constant succession of bows, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> really <b>could</b> not {{make up his}} mind to the trial of letting it go again.|$|R
6000|$|... "Stubbs--thrown--the--money--away?" [...] {{repeated}} Ben, with a pause {{between each}} word, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> {{not understand that}} which he himself was saying.|$|E
6000|$|Mitchy looked <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> {{understand}} that and yet could also imagine {{something of a}} conflict. [...] "But if Mr. Longdon insists--?" ...|$|E
60|$|The {{front door}} opened, and they heard Dr. May's step hesitating in the hall, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> {{not bear to}} come in.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Cuthcott made a queer, deep little noise; {{it was not}} a laugh, however, and {{it seemed}} <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> knew she <b>could</b> not bear him to look at her just then.|$|R
6000|$|When {{he is in}} a more domineering mood {{he likes}} such allusions to his [...] rank <b>as</b> king.... <b>If</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> resume his walks on the terrace he [...] might improve slightly. But it is too soon yet. We must {{consider}} [...] what we shall report to the Council. There is little hope of his [...] being much better. What do you think, Willis? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Godolphin {{would pay}} any sum for the {{privilege}} of using the fact <b>as</b> an advertisement. <b>If</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> put it into Pinney's hands, and give him carte blanche, to work in all the romance he liked--" ...|$|R
60|$|Ralph, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> {{foresee the}} length of this {{familiar}} argument, drew up a chair for his sister and sat down himself.|$|E
6000|$|Lastly, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> {{not help}} it, Guy dashed up the step once more, pressed Charles's hand, and said, 'God bless you, Charlie!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'When {{you were}} talking to that miller. A man was looking from the laurel- tree as jealously <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> have eaten you.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Adam {{started up}} from his chair, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> thought <b>he</b> <b>could</b> have leaped to her that moment. But Mr. Irwine laid hold of his arm again and said, persuasively, [...] "Wait, Adam, wait." [...] So he sat down.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh I've {{known them}} at places--at Cannes, at Pau, at Shanghai--do it sooner still. I always {{know when they}} will. You CAN'T make out they don't love me!" [...] He spoke almost plaintively, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> wished she <b>could.</b>|$|R
60|$|The {{following}} batter was Graves, who strode up smiling, confident, sarcastic, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> knew <b>he</b> <b>could</b> do {{more than}} the others. Ken imagined what the third-baseman would have said if the coach had not been present. Graves always ruffled Ken the wrong way.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ha, ha!" [...] laughed Tackleton. Hollow as a drum that laugh, though. And {{he looked}} <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> have twisted Dot's neck comfortably.|$|E
6000|$|George lay {{perfectly}} still {{and looked at}} Ralph <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not believe that which he heard, and Bob, forgetting himself again, cried out: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{does not}} look ferocious, father," [...] one of them said. [...] "He looks {{pleasant}} and good tempered, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> injure no one." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "When his son spoke, the Emir gave a gasp of relief. 'He lives,' <b>he</b> murmured, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> {{even now}} <b>he</b> <b>could</b> {{scarcely}} {{believe that this}} was possible; and as he put his hand upon my shoulder it trembled with emotion.|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{would have}} waited as willingly <b>as</b> <b>he</b> went, <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> have served his queen thereby. But what say you, my masters? How {{can we do}} better than {{to spend a few}} days here, to get our sick round, before we make the Main, and set to our work?" ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{reflects}} that a [...] "boneless wonder" [...] or a [...] "man serpent" [...] would be comfortable enough in this bed, and wishes {{that he had}} been brought up <b>as</b> a contortionist. <b>If</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> only tie his legs round his neck, and tuck his head in under his arm, all would yet be well.|$|R
60|$|He {{walked to}} the door, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> hardly trust his temper if he {{answered}} her--stopped--and, thinking better of it, turned toward her again.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Did you say {{anything}} to him, Miss May?' said Leonard, turning on her a flushed face, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> almost have been angered with her.|$|E
60|$|No {{one made}} any reply, {{and it seemed}} to Ralph <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> hear the {{pulsations}} of his own heart, so oppressive was the silence.|$|E
6000|$|... 160 “Gladstone,” says Lord Selborne, “would {{have been}} ready to oppose [...] Disraeli’s bill <b>as</b> a whole, <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> have {{overcome}} the reluctance [...] of his followers. But when a meeting was called to take counsel on [...] the situation, {{it became apparent that}} this could not be done” [...] (Memorials, Part II. i. pp. 68-9).|$|R
50|$|The Directors now had {{a serious}} problem in {{maintaining}} momentum; they wrote to Burke offering £1,950 <b>as</b> his fee <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> bring about construction of the line for £27,000, but only £1,000 if the sum was overrun. He accepted this arrangement, and it was apparently modified by negotiation later to £1,650 <b>if</b> <b>he</b> was successful, and £1,000 if not.|$|R
6000|$|Next {{day began}} the {{wholesome}} out-of-door life, which works such wonders with tired minds and feeble bodies. The weather was perfect, {{and the mountain}} air made the children as frisky as young lambs; while the elders went about smiling at one another, and saying, [...] "Isn't it splendid?" [...] Even Mac, the [...] "slow coach," [...] was seen to leap over a fence <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> really <b>could</b> not help it; and when Rose ran after him with his broad-brimmed hat, he made the spirited proposal {{to go into the}} woods and hunt for a catamount.|$|R
