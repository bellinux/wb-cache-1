5000|$|An <b>asymmetric</b> <b>valley</b> is {{a valley}} that has steeper slopes on one side. Asymmetric valleys are azonal landforms. In high altitudes south-facing slopes are usually steeper than north-facing slopes. Large incised rivers {{crossing}} strike-slip faults can form asymmetrical valleys, as one {{bank of the}} river might be continuously being renewed while the other bank drifts away from the stationary river. A smaller river does not develop an asymmetrical valley as the whole river is offset or bent by the fault, rather than the river modifying the moving tectonic block. An example of this kind of asymmetrical valley {{can be found at the}} crossing of the Yellow River with the Zhongwei-Tongxin fault.|$|E
50|$|An entrenched river {{refers to}} a river that is {{confined}} to a canyon or gorge, and in most cases, it is relatively narrow with very little or no flood plain. It often has meanders already developed into landscapes. An entrenched river usually forms a rapid downcutting of the river channel before it changes its course. The river downcutting may occur rapidly {{as a result of}} a tectonic uplift rift or when a lowering of the ocean floor takes place. Increased level of downcutting is also possible when a moraine-dammed lake collapses downstream, or when there is a capture of a river by another river.The meanders formed in these landscapes refer to incised meanders and they occur in two forms, including an ingrown meander and entrenched meander. An ingrown meander occurs when downcutting process is slow and the river can cause lateral erosion, leading to an <b>asymmetric</b> <b>valley.</b> The feature developed when such processes occur refers to un-incised meander. On the other hand, entrenched meander occurs when there is a rapid incision of the river bed such that the river does not have the opportunity to erode the lateral side. This leads to symmetrical valleys with a gorge-like appearance. It is widely believed that the development of these two features occurs before the rejuvenation does.|$|E
40|$|Ice {{thickness}} {{distribution and}} volume are both key parameters for glaciological and hydrological applications. This study presents VOLTA (Volume and Topography Automation), {{which is a}} Python script tool for ArcGISTM that requires just a digital elevation model (DEM) and glacier outline(s) to model distributed ice thickness, volume and bed topography. Ice thickness is initially estimated at points along an automatically generated centreline network based on the perfect-plasticity rheology assumption, taking into account a valley side drag component of the force balance equation. Distributed ice thickness is subsequently interpolated using a glaciologically correct algorithm. For five glaciers with independent field-measured bed topography, VOLTA modelled volumes were between 26. 5 % (underestimate) and 16. 6 % (overestimate) of that derived from field observations. Greatest differences were where an <b>asymmetric</b> <b>valley</b> cross section shape was present or where significant valley infill had occurred. Compared with other methods of modelling ice thickness and volume, key advantages of VOLTA are: a fully automated approach and a user friendly graphical user interface (GUI), GIS consistent geometry, fully automated centreline generation, inclusion of a side drag component in the force balance equation, estimation of glacier basal shear stress for each individual glacier, fully distributed ice thickness output {{and the ability to}} process multiple glaciers rapidly. VOLTA is capable of regional scale ice volume assessment, which is a key parameter for exploring glacier response to climate change. VOLTA also permits subtraction of modelled ice thickness from the input surface elevation to produce an ice-free DEM, which is a key input for reconstruction of former glaciers. VOLTA could assist with prediction of future glacier geometry changes and hence in projection of future meltwater fluxes...|$|E
50|$|The {{slope of}} the terrain follows the {{direction}} of the rivers: from northwest to southeast. Along them, the altitude decreases from 700 m to under 200 m. The strata are disposed in North-South and northwest-southeast aligned layers, producing <b>asymmetric</b> <b>valleys</b> and ridges. Among the latter are the steep edge of the Bârlad Plateau (Podișului Bârladului), known as the Iași Ridge (Coasta Iașilor), the edge of the Central Moldavian Plateau (Podișul Moldovei Centrale), known as the Cornești Hills, and the edge of the Dniester Hills, known as the Dniester Ridge.|$|R
30|$|The {{model is}} able to explain the {{reduction}} of the reflectance maxima in the UV-visible range by the small amount of gold that can penetrate into the pores (0.1 % for tPW[*]=[*] 0  min and 1.2 % for tPW[*]=[*] 18  min). These results are consistent with the pore size, as a bigger amount of gold can penetrate for bigger pores. Nevertheless, the model predicts a smaller reflectance reduction than what is observed in the measurements. This {{is due to the fact}} that there possibly exist other sources of loss in this spectral range than the absorption from the gold in the inner pore walls. Such losses can arise from scattering or plasmonic effects that the model cannot take into account. In the near-IR range, the changes in the shape of the oscillations are explained by the differences in thickness and porosity of the gold layer on the NAA film. The obtained gold film porosities are also consistent with the porosity of the NAA film (P 2 [*]=[*] 55.3 % for tPW[*]=[*] 0  min and P 2 [*]=[*] 59.5 % for tPW[*]=[*] 18  min), bigger for the bigger NAA film porosity. This result is in good agreement with previous works[27] where a 10 -nm-thickness gold layer is sputtered onto NAA. Cross-sectional FE-SEM pictures in this work show that sputtered gold does not penetrate into the NAA pores and forms a superficial film. With just these two parameters (thickness and porosity), it is possible to account for all the features observed in the spectra in the near-IR range: the narrow <b>asymmetric</b> <b>valleys</b> for the low-porosity NAA that become more symmetric as the porosity increases and the differences in blue shift of the reflectance minima.|$|R

40|$|River valleys take freakish shapes. In mountainous areas, river beds {{take the}} forms of canyons, gorges and valleys. In turn, a valley may be {{symmetric}} or asymmetric. D. G. Panov is the developer of the valley classification. The valley is a linearly extended relief pattern similar to Latin letter “V” in shape. Let’s consider the two valleys {{from the viewpoint of}} geomechanics. In research, it is necessary to define the optimal position of an arch dam with account for its stress-strain state that may develop in the course of its construction and further operation. As an example, we took a hypothetical mountain river having a high-pressure hydroelectric power plant (HPP) with a concrete arch dam. The first series of calculations was aimed at the study of the process of development of the stress-strain state of the massif based on the symmetrical valley slope inclination angle. The second series of calculations was aimed at the study of development of the stress-strained state of the massif depending on slope inclination angle of an <b>asymmetric</b> <b>valley.</b> The following angle values were randomly chosen: 10 °, 15 °, 20 °, 25 °, 30 °. Additional analysis of a slope having the inclination angles of 35 °, 37 ° and 40 ° was performed. At 35 °, the slope was steady with a big safety factor, at 37 °, the slope was steady, too, but the safety factor was below 10 %, and at 40 °, the slope collapsed.

For somewhat lighter systems {{it has been observed}} that fission mass distributions are usually symmetric. However, a recent experiment showed that fission of ^ 180 Hg following electron capture on ^ 180 Tl is asymmetric. We calculate potential-energy surfaces for a typical actinide nucleus and for 12 even isotopes in the range ^ 178 Hg [...] ^ 200 Hg, to investigate the similarities and differences of actinide compared to mercury potential surfaces and to what extent fission-fragment properties, in particular shell structure, relate to the structure of the static potential-energy surfaces. Potential-energy surfaces are calculated in the macroscopic-microscopic approach as functions of fiveshape coordinates for more than five million shapes. The structure of the surfaces are investigated by use of an immersion technique. We determine properties of minima, saddle points, valleys, and ridges between valleys in the 5 D shape-coordinate space. Along the mercury isotope chain the barrier heights and the ridge heights and persistence with elongation vary significantly and show no obvious connection to possible fragment shell structure, in contrast to the actinide region, where there is a deep <b>asymmetric</b> <b>valley</b> extending from the saddle point to scission. The mechanism of asymmetric fission must be very different in the lighter proton-rich mercury isotopes compared to the actinide region and is apparently unrelated to fragment shell structure. Isotopes lighter than ^ 192 Hg have the saddle point blocked from a deep symmetric valley by a significant ridge. The ridge vanishes for the heavier Hg isotopes, for which we would expect a qualitatively different asymmetry of the fragments. Comment: 8 pages, 9 figure...|$|E
40|$|Some figures {{may appear}} in colour {{only in the}} online journalThe {{evolution}} of fragment mass distribution in low-energy fission is studied {{as a function of}} the composition of the fissioning system over a wide range, from Hg to Fm isotopes. The relative importance of symmetric and asymmetric fission modes is investigated within a static picture based on elaborate, four-dimensional potential energy spaces using the modified Funny-Hills deformation coordinates. The potential energy is computed with the macroscopic-microscopic method. The Lublin-Strasbourg drop model is used to calculate the macroscopic part of the potential energy, while the Yukawa folded single-particle potential with an improved Strutinsky method and the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory are employed to evaluate the shell and pairing contributions to the macroscopic energy. From the analysis of the potential energy surfaces, equilibrium deformations and saddle-point shapes are determined. A coexistence of symmetric and <b>asymmetric</b> fission <b>valleys</b> is observed. The relative depth of these valleys depends on the fissioning nucleus. The valleys' competition is used to explain the evolution of the fission-fragment mass distribution, from asymmetric fission in $^{ 180 }$Hg to symmetric fission in $^{ 260 }$Fm.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{landscape}} evolution and soil {{development in the}} loess area near Regensburg between approximately 6000 - 2000 yr BP (radiocarbon years), Eastern Bavaria. The {{focus is on the}} question how man and climate influenced landscape evolution and what their relative significance was. The theoretical background concerning the factors that controlled prehistoric soil erosion in Middle Europe is summarized with respect to rainfall intensity and distribution, pedogenesis, Pleistocene relief, and prehistoric farming. Colluvial deposits, flood loams, and soils were studied at ten different and representative sites that served as archives of their respective palaeoenvironments. Geomorphological, sedimentological, and pedological methods were applied. According to the findings presented here, there was a high asynchronity of landscape evolution in the investigation area, which was due to prehistoric land-use patterns. Prehistoric land use and settlement caused highly difIerenciated phases of morphodynamic activity and stability in time and space. These are documented at the single catenas ofeach site. In general, Pleistocene relief was substantially lowered. At the same time smaller landforms such as dells and minor <b>asymmetric</b> <b>valleys</b> filled up and strongly transformed. However, there were short phases at many sites, forming short lived linear erosion features ('Runsen'), resulting from exceptional rainfalls. These forms are results of single events without showing regional trends. Generally, the onset of the sedimentation of colluvial deposits took place much earlier (usually 3500 yr BP (radiocarbon) and younger) than the formation of flood loams. Thus, the deposition of flood loams in the Kleine Laaber river valley started mainly as a consequence of iron age farming only at around 2500 yr BP (radiocarbon). A cascade system explains the different ages of colluvial deposits and flood loams: as a result of prehistoric land use, dells and other minor Pleistocene landforms were filled with colluvial sediments. After the filling of these primary sediment traps, eroded material was transported into flood plains, thus forming flood loams. But at the moment we cannot quantify the extent ofprehistoric soil erosion in the investigation area. The three factors that controlled the prehistoric Iandscapc evolution in the Ioess area near Regensburg are as follows: 1. The transformation from a natural to a prehistoric cultural landscape was the most important factor: A landscape with stable relief was changed into a highly morphodynamic one with soil erosion as the dominant process of this change. 2. The sediment traps of the pre-anthropogenic relief determined where the material originated from soil erosion was deposited: either sedimentation took place on the slopes or the filled sediment traps of the slopes rendered flood loam formation possible. Climatic influence of any importance can only be documented as the result of land use in connection with singular and/or statistic events of heavy rainfalls. Without human impact, no significant change in the Holocene landscape would have been possible...|$|R

For a 60 degrees dislocation (MD), the effective part in strain relaxation is the part with the Burgers vector parallel to the film/substrate interface within its b(edge) component; so the surface stress over a MD is asymmetric. When the strained layer is relatively thin, the surface morphology is cross-hatch grid with <b>asymmetric</b> ridges and <b>valleys.</b> When the strained layer is relatively thick, the ridges become nearly symmetrical, and the dislocations and the ridges inclined-aligned.

40|$|Background: Recent {{experiments}} on beta-delayed fission in the mercury-lead {{region and the}} discovery of asym- metric fission in 180 Hg [1] have stimulated theoretical interest in the mechanism of fission in heavy nuclei. Purpose: We study fission modes and fusion valleys in 180 Hg and 198 Hg to reveal the role of shell effects in pre-scission region and explain the experimentally observed fragment mass asymmetry and its variation with A. Methods: We use the self-consistent nuclear density functional theory employing Skyrme and Gogny energy density functionals. Results: The potential energy surfaces in multi-dimensional space of collective coordinates, including elongation, triaxiality, reflection-asymmetry, and necking, are calculated for 180 Hg and 198 Hg. The <b>asymmetric</b> fission <b>valleys</b> - well separated from fusion valleys associated with nearly spherical fragments - are found in in both cases. The density distributions at scission configurations are studied and related to the experimentally observed mass splits. Conclusions: The energy density functionals SkM∗ and D 1 S give a very consistent description of the fission process in 180 Hg and 198 Hg. We predict a transition from asymmetric fission in 180 Hg towards more symmetric distribution of fission fragments in 198 Hg. For 180 Hg, both models yield 100 Ru/ 80 Kr as the most probable split. For 198 Hg, the most likely split is 108 Ru/ 90 Kr in HFB-D 1 S and 110 Ru/ 88 Kr in HFB-SkM∗. Comment: 6 pages, 5 figures, {{to be published in}} Physical Review...|$|R

The spin-flip effect is induced by the rotating magnetic field, and the tunnelling current is sensitively related to the spin-flip effect. We present the calculations of charge and spin current components to show the intimate relations to the SWCN leads. Zeeman effect is important when the applied magnetic field is strong enough. The current characteristics are quite different when the source-drain bias is zero (eV= 0) and nonzero (eV≠ 0).

40|$|In Quaternary sediments {{filling the}} Velyky Lukavets River valley, at the {{abandoned}} ozokerite mine (= Ropyshche) in Starunia, perfectly preserved carcasses of large mammals {{were discovered in}} the first half of the 20 th century. The study area includes a fragment of the valley between Molotkiv and Starunia, and its close vicinity. The area belongs to several morphostructural and geomorphic units of the Outer Eastern Carpathians and the Carpathian Foreland. The <b>asymmetric,</b> subsequent <b>valley</b> is a part of the Mizhbystrytska Upland, where flattened ridges and flat bulges represent fragments of planation surfaces: the upper (the Krasna level), elevated 170 m above the valley bottom and linked with the Late Pliocene, and the lower one (the Loyova level), rising at 100 m and linked with the Eopleistocene. Several flat surfaces are visible on valley slopes, probably representing river terraces formed before the Late Pleistocene. The valley attained its maximum depth during the Eemian Interglacial (OIS 5 e). In the Ropyshche area, probably three terrace steps built of Weichselian and Holocene sediments (OIS 5 d - 1) were developed, but their top surfaces are almost completely destroyed by mining operations. The recent, meandering river bed follows the zones of decreased cohesiveness of rocks resulting from mining activity and is becoming somewhat deepened during inundations. The transported material is mostly coarse-clastic one. The two latter factors may suggest that the river is underloaded due to declining agriculture and decreasing intensity of outwash. The top surface of the sub-Quaternary basement is deformed by subsidence and collapse of mine workings, but the relief of valley bottom allows for further exploration for remnants of large mammals not only in the Ropyscche area but along the whole studied segment of the valley, as well...|$|R
40|$|This study aims at reconstructing {{landscape}} {{evolution in}} the Quebrada de Purmamarca, NW-Argentina. Thorough mapping of the existing landforms and present morphodynamic situation {{was conducted on the}} base of intensive field work and the interpretation of remote sensing imagery. Aside from geomorphological mapping, field work focused on the description of numerous sedimentological and pedological profiles. The analysis of these profiles was supported by laboratory data from field samples (granulometry, CaCO 3 content) but also by a 14 C age date. With particular regard to pedological questions, several samples from soil crust were micromorphologically analysed and interpreted. The resulting data allowed the reconstruction of several phases of landscape {{evolution in the}} Quebrada de Purmamarca back to the Miocene. During this phase, the Andes were still a landscape of relatively low relief being subject to processes of planation under conditions markedly more humid than today. Highly faulted and deformed fanglomerates are the first evidence of a progressing uplift coupled under an increasingly arid climate. As a consequence of continued uplift and alternating phases of erosion and aggradation, large terrace systems have formed. Particularly the youngest terrace level shows good preservation. Against the background of the intense climatic changes characteristic for the Pleistocene, these terraces have been the major focus of this study. They are built up almost entirely from coarse debris-flow sediments which are thought {{to be the result of}} a significant drop of the periglacial belt of more than 1, 000 meters. This interpretation is confirmed by a variety of relict periglacial landforms like “glatthang” morphology (smooth topography), sheets of frost debris and <b>asymmetric</b> <b>valleys.</b> As sediment supply from periglacial debris production exceeded the transport capacity of the drainage system leading to the dominance of depositional processes. Aggradation has been interrupted or at least weakened several times as reflected by two lacustrine to fluvial intervals within the terrace deposits. In this context, particularly the younger interval might announce a shift in morphodynamics around 49 ka BP (14 C age), when the phase of terrace aggradation grades into a phase of dominant alluvial fan activity. On the terrace surfaces a well-developed reddish soil has developed. It is interpreted to indicate a phase of increased humidity possibly in relation with the “Minchin” wet phase between 40 ka BP and 25 ka BP. At many places, this reddish soil is overlain by a markedly cemented sand crust. Based on the good sorting of medium and fine sand, this sand crust could be interpreted as fluvio-eolian sediment. Its deposition under very arid and cold climatic conditions may be attributed to the Late Glacial Maximum (LGM). However, the sand crust shows signs of erosion at many places and has not been observed anywhere below the level of the terrace surface. Therefore the onset of severe erosion and incision resulting in the evacuation of enormous quantities of sediment from the study area is assumed to postdate the LGM, possibly due to increased discharge rates during a wetter Lateglacial. Regardless of its timing, the intense incision is likely to have cut down to below the present floodplain evidently causing several mass wasting events in the study area. Since the early Holocene a number of short-term changes seem to have been responsible for the landscape evolution of the Quebrada de Purmamarca. More humid phases of pronounced slope smoothing have alternated with semi-arid phases of longer duration. The well-developed, polycyclic calcretes on top of the inactive terraces and alluvial fans give evidence for these changes. At present, the marked desert pavement on top of most terraces and alluvial fan surfaces prevent soil. The concentration of runoff on these pavements amplifies badland formation and alluvial fan activity along the terrace slopes. The presently observed floodplain aggradation may be attributed to these processes but considering the severe gullying reaching far into the upper study area, the aggradation may as well reflect a more general and regional trend...|$|R
40|$|The Northern Alpine Foreland Basin (NAFB) {{formed as}} a result of alpine {{continental}} collision in Oligocene time. Tectonic shortening has been slow since the Miocene, implying that the NAFB subsidence has come to rest. The scope of this thesis is to find evidence that yield information regarding the recent vertical tectonic activity and a potentially ongoing basin inversion. The identification of such an active inversion can be accomplished by studying the landscape evolution. This is possible, because the earth’s surface contains information about tectonic and erosional processes. In order to understand and quantify the underlying mechanisms forming the landscape, both surface and subsurface information can be linked. Especially when geophysical or similar data are insufficient, geomorphological analyses provide new insights. The NAFB is a low-strain sedimentary basin, where historic subsurface data confirm subsidence, while the present-day erosional relief indicates uplift. The basin has a long prospection history and geometries of basement faults are well known, but their link to topography is ambiguous and the landscape is regarded as climatically controlled. In this context, dense population and energy exploration call for a fundamental understanding, if the basin is uplifting and whether or not faults could potentially be reactivated. This thesis aims at characterizing geomorphotectonic indicators of uplift, potentially indicating NAFB inversion. Related to this process, vertical motion of a few hundred meters to a few kilometers is expected to have been taking place during the Plio- Pleistocene. My study addresses the Quaternary geomorphology and distribution of sediments across the NAFB. To assess a potential link between <b>asymmetric</b> <b>valleys</b> and underlying basement faults in the NE portion of the basin (Tertiary Hills region), I analyzed high-resolution space-borne imagery and carried out geologic fieldwork. Results in distinct geomorphological response of the NAFB are (a) regional scale erosion of sediments, (b) fluvial incision, (c) reactivation of documented faults and (d) regional scale tilting of paleo-geodetic markers. 1 In the NE portion of the NAFB, the geometry of a detected high-angle geologic subsurface contact associated with a surface escarpment, potentially originated from young surface faulting, while landscape morphology is intensely overprinted by climatic processes and anthropogenic land use. The investigation of mid-Miocene coastal features of the Swabian Alb cliff line addresses the landscape evolution along the marginal area of the NAFB. The particular questions here are, if coastal outcrops are part of the same coast, and which mechanisms have caused their different present-day elevations. I investigated marine features in a geologic field survey and compiled stratigraphic data to infer the regional response to uplift. The results show that two sites represent temporally and spatially different coastal sections, and both have been intensely modified by multiple erosional processes. The data can be explained by invoking a combination of surface erosion and possible lithospheric scale uplift. My study of well data and geomorphic markers, to infer NAFB Quaternary sediment budgets, yields a remarkable erosion of sediments along the central E-W basin axis and fluvial networks in disequilibrium. I examined erosion rates across different timescales, using sediment yields from NAFB catchments and basin sediment flux. On the Pleistocene timescale, geomorphic indicators of fluvial systems are investigated while for the Holocene, archeological data provide constraints on local erosion. The results of this study reveal a distinct oval-shaped erosion pattern across the NAFB, which can explain the modern erosional relief of the region, and further implies active inversion of the basin. Similar results are derived from drainage pattern and river steepness estimates. The results of this thesis imply that the Quaternary landscape in the NAFB has been significantly influenced by tectonic activity. Further, the timing for the NAFB transition from subsidence to uplift is likely to originate at the Pliocene – Quaternary boundary, and continues. Therefore, the possibility of future fault reactivation, controlled by lithospheric scale uplift, cannot be ruled out...|$|R
40|$|International audienceSUMMARY Differences between 3 -D {{numerical}} {{predictions of}} earthquake ground {{motion in the}} Mygdonian basin near Thessaloniki, Greece, led us to define four canonical stringent models derived from the complex realistic 3 -D model of the Mygdonian basin. Sediments atop an elastic bedrock are modelled in the 1 D-sharp and 1 D-smooth models using three homogeneous layers and smooth velocity distribution, respectively. The 2 D-sharp and 2 D-smooth models are extensions of the 1 -D models to an <b>asymmetric</b> sedimentary <b>valley.</b> In all cases, 3 -D wavefields include strongly dispersive surface waves in the sediments. We compared simulations by the Fourier pseudo-spectral method (FPSM), the Legendre spectral-element method (SEM) and two formulations of the finite-difference method (FDM-S and FDM-C) up to 4 Hz. The accuracy of individual solutions and level of agreement between solutions vary with type of seismic waves and depend on the smoothness of the velocity model. The level of accuracy is high for the body waves in all solutions. However, it strongly depends on the discrete representation of the material interfaces (at which material parameters change discontinuously) for the surface waves in the sharp models. An improper discrete representation of the interfaces can cause inaccurate numerical modelling of surface waves. For all the numerical methods considered, except SEM with mesh of elements following the interfaces, a proper implementation of interfaces requires definition of an effective medium consistent with the interface boundary conditions. An orthorhombic effective medium is shown to significantly improve accuracy and preserve the computational efficiency of modelling. The conclusions drawn from {{the analysis of the}} results of the canonical cases greatly help to explain differences between numerical predictions of ground motion in realistic models of the Mygdonian basin. We recommend that any numerical method and code that is intended for numerical prediction of earthquake ground motion should be verified through stringent models that would make it possible to test the most important aspects of accuracy...|$|R

The results include crustal thickness estimates at the stations themselves, and where possible, cross sections are drawn. The large-scale Moho depth variation pattern generally correlates well with the current status of the Mesozoic batholith: Deep Moho of 35 – 39 km is observed beneath the western Peninsula Ranges, Sierra Nevada, and San Bernardino Mountains, where the batholith is relatively intact, and shallow Moho of 26 – 32 km is observed in the Mojave Desert, where the batholith is highly deformed and disrupted.

40|$|The groundwater-surface water {{interface}} (GSI) is {{a critical}} environmental hotspot, a key area influencing the fate of carbon, nutrients and contaminants of surface and subsurface origin, and a zone of ecological importance. Policy seeking to mitigate issues relating to dissolved contaminants and to improve stream health, increasingly recognizes its significance, particularly {{in the context of}} integrated management of streams and aquifers. Techniques assessing riverbed flow and solute patterns are often limited to the local scale. When related to the multi-scale pattern of hydrogeologic and geomorphic features controlling stream, hyporheic and groundwater fluxes, they can improve larger scale predictions of flow and solute behaviour at the GSI. This study develops a conceptual model of riverbed flow and solute patterns, and tests it in a 4 th order stream in the UK. It assesses the interaction between large scale subsurface flowpaths, driven by the distribution of bedrock outcrops, and the expansion and closure of alluvial deposits, and small-scale hyporheic flowpaths, driven by riffle-pool sequences. It uses two networks of riverbed mini-piezometers and multi-level samplers: network 1, across fifteen sites in a 7. 2 km length of river in unconstrained (open alluvial <b>valley),</b> <b>asymmetric</b> (bedrock outcropping on one bank) and constrained (bedrock on both banks) contexts; and network 2, across six riffle-pool sequences in a 350 -m reach, at the transition between asymmetric/unconstrained and constrained contexts. Subsurface flowpaths and stream-water infiltration were deduced by relating vertical exchange fluxes to stream and pore-water patterns of conservative natural tracers. Biogeochemical processes were highlighted using reactive natural tracers. At network 2, measurements of surface water profiles and riverbed coring were also undertaken, and dissolved metal concentrations in the first 15 cm of sediments assessed using gel probes. Network 1 was sampled twice. Monthly head measurements and seasonal pore-water sampling were undertaken at network 2. Results from network 1 showed the combined influence of valley type and riffle-pool sequences on riverbed flow and solute patterns. In asymmetric and unconstrained contexts, stream water infiltrated deeply in the riverbed in riffles. In pools, a vertical stratification of hydrochemically distinct flowpaths, often disconnected hydrologically from the stream, was observed. Biogeochemical reactions were more developed in pools. In constrained context, riverbed pore-water was dominated by upwelling subsurface flowpaths displaying a low vertical variability of hydrochemistry. Biogeochemical reactions were not apparent, and stream water infiltration was limited to shallow depth in riffle context. The replicability of these patterns with regards to local conditions (groundwater discharge, surface water profile and riverbed permeability) will be discussed at network 2. Finally, implications of the conceptual model for the near-bed ecosystem will be illustrated by assessing the bioavailability of metals in the shallow riverbed. This work will help to better design monitoring strategies aiming to consider the control of the GSI on solute fate across scales...|$|R
