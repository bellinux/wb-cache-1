5|$|Descent 3 {{takes place}} in a science fiction setting of the Solar System where the player is cast as Material Defender MD1032, a {{mercenary}} working for a corporation called the Post Terran Mining Corporation (PTMC). The game begins moments after the events of Descent II, with the Material Defender escaping the destruction of a planetoid where he was clearing PTMC's robots infected by an alien virus. He was about to return to Earth to collect his reward, but a malfunction occurred with the prototype warp drive in the ship he was piloting, making it drift towards the Sun's atmosphere. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>last</b> moment, the Material Defender is rescued via a tractor beam by an organization known as the Red Acropolis Research Team.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of 28 January, Surcouf {{captured}} the 12-gun Diana, loaded with 6000 bags of rice. The next day, Cartier met a 26-gun Indiaman, Triton, armed with 12-pounders and a 150-man crew; having decided to attack, and recognising only too late the overwhelming superiority of his opponent, Surcouf, feeling threatened and unable to flee, decided to board her with his 26 men. After haranguing his men, he approached under a British flag, before hoisting French colours <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>last</b> moment and launching a violent assault. In the ensuing 45-minute battle, Triton suffered 5 wounded and 10 killed, including her captain, Captain Burnycat, and the first officer, Picket; The prisoners were transferred to Diana, which Surcouf released against a 30,000 rupee ransom.|$|E
5|$|On {{designing}} the battle system, Kitao {{said that his}} two main aims were creating something never before seen in an RPG and designing something accessible yet challenging. Adjustments to the battle system went on all through development, with some changes being made <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>last</b> minute. The gun customization system was originally a puzzle-based system, but was later converted to a diagram set-up. Weapons were originally going to be represented in three-dimensions, but technical issues prevented this. On the whole, the development was a taxing one for him. The most difficult part about incorporating guns into the system was creating a workable system that did not rely on first-person and third-person shooter mechanics. The two types of damage and various special moves in the game were born from the team's discussions about how the three playable characters might be directed to work in unison, dealing different types of attacks. Being able to attack while moving {{was inspired by a}} suggestion from staff members stemming from more traditional action games and scenes from Hollywood action films. For the camera, the team decided to balance it between limited control during player turns and a more dynamic feel during attacks.|$|E

25|$|The {{crossbows}} of infantry became heavier, {{and more}} {{dangerous for the}} knights, and the ordinary shield of the past was replaced with the pavise; a high, rectangle shield, from behind which a foot soldier could safely shoot <b>at</b> <b>the</b> enemy. <b>The</b> <b>very</b> <b>last</b> inventions of <b>the</b> 15th century were black powder and cannon. The latter was {{for the first time}} used in Poland after the death of king Louis I of Hungary, when followers of one of candidates to the throne besieged their opponents in the castle of Pyzdry in 1383. Bombards of that times, which shot stone projectiles, were quite good against fortifications, but almost useless on the battlefield.|$|R

Lightning managed to strike twice as they duplicated their 2005 playoff run by again beating FC Dallas in penalties only to crash out of the Western Conference Final by a two-goal deficit.

25|$|DC {{returned}} home to fight the defending MLS Champions, the LA Galaxy, in RFK. Sophomore center back Steve Birnbaum landed awkwardly on his ankle {{and had to be}} taken off the field in the fifth minute of play as Kofi Opare got his first league cap in a DC United uniform. Just as it appeared the game would end in a scoreless draw, <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>last</b> minute of the match, Nick DeLeon broke free down the right wing and sent in a cross to Pontius, who fought off his own defender to head the ball past the keeper for a 1–0 victory.|$|E

25|$|Mustafizur Rahman is {{probably}} the most successful bowler of the off cutter. Instead of rolling the fingers over the seam of sliding it back he flicks his wrists <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>last</b> moment with very less change to his action. Thus the 'Fizz' grips the surface and deviates the ball from its line and gets a sudden jump like bounce with slower pace. He even bowls a fast off cutter. Thus Nasser Hossain rightly described him as a 'fast off spinner'. A good example would be Andre Russels dismissal by Mustafizur in the Vivo IPL 2016.|$|E
25|$|Räikkönen took pole at the , but Michael Schumacher won {{the race}} with Räikkönen {{finishing}} 2nd. With one race to go, Schumacher only needed one point to win the championship. Räikkönen would need to win the next race with Schumacher not scoring any points. After qualifying 8th in Japan, Räikkönen finished 2nd while Michael Schumacher just slipped into the points to win his 6th World Championship. Montoya's retirement during the race also meant that Räikkönen finished 2nd in the championship, just two points behind Schumacher. The team also narrowly lost {{second place in the}} Constructors' Championship, finishing third, two points behind runners-up Williams, and 12 points behind Ferrari. Mathematically, Williams or McLaren could have won the championship <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>last</b> race. The 2003 season was one of the closest in recent years.|$|E
25|$|The {{privateer}} Robert Surcouf had had {{a successful}} cruise in the Indian Ocean capturing several vessels, including the pilot boat Cartier, which he renamed Hasard. He transferred his remaining men from his ship Émilie to Hasard and on 28 January, sighting Triton at anchor, decided to attack. He recognised only too late the overwhelming superiority of his opponent. Surcouf, feeling unable to flee, decided to board her with his 26 men, After haranguing his men, he approached under a British flag, before hoisting French colours <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>last</b> moment and launching a violent assault. In the ensuing 45-minute battle, Triton suffered 5 wounded and 10 killed, including Burnyeat and the first officer, Picket; Surcouf transferred his prisoners to Diana, another vessel that he had captured, and which he released to her captain against a 30,000 rupee ransom.|$|E

25|$|The {{theological}} core of {{the work}} and its content have been much discussed since the pre-Christian age, especially the problem of human misfortune and in particular the misfortune of the righteous in relation to the prevailing concept of divine justice. In that it uses as departure point the literary framework of the story of Job, a devout, wealthy and respected man, who, with God’s permission, was struck by Satan with the greatest misfortunes. Being a king, according to the Septuagint, Job was the model of the God-fearing, wise and philanthropic ruler who was also enjoying a peaceful life in the bosom of his large family and among his friends. It was precisely this deep piety and the divine favour which incited the envy of Satan who - not without much effort - eventually succeeded in obtaining God’s consent to put Job to the test. Thus, in a rapid sequence of calamities, Job is robbed of all his possessions, his herds, his servants, his house and all his ten children. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>last,</b> smitten himself with the horrible disease of leprosy and abandoned by all, including his wife, he leaves the city and dwells on a dunghill. In spite of all these reversals of fate Job remains steadfast not only to his faith in God, but also to the conviction that this sudden reversal of the divine will cannot be the consequence of his own sins, since he does not believe that such exist. Finally, after many years of trial, God again reverses the just man’s fate, restoring to him twofold all his worldly goods and giving him a new family.|$|E

500|$|Bosanquet did not bat {{in a style}} {{typical of}} a cricketer from Eton, where batsmen were taught to play with style and grace.

He {{does not seem to}} play the ball in a free, unconstrained way, but rather stabs at it and gives one the impression of making his stroke <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>last</b> moment." [...] In Australia, Bosanquet was troubled by fast pitches and struggled against bowlers such as Monty Noble and Bert Hopkins who could make the ball move towards him through the air. Nevertheless, he displayed great confidence in his ability and on a pitch which assisted spinners, he could flick the ball onto the leg side very effectively. He could hit the ball hard, particularly when driving. The Times said: [...] "He had a wonderful eye and great strength of fore-arm and anything short he could hit very hard." ...|$|E
500|$|Since Quinn and Basehart did {{not speak}} Italian, both were dubbed in the {{original}} release. [...] Unhappy with the actor who initially dubbed Zampanò, Fellini remembered being impressed by the work done by Arnoldo Foà in dubbing the Toshiro Mifune character in the Italian version of Akira Kurosawa's Rashomon, {{and was able to}} secure Foà's services <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>last</b> moment. [...] Composer Michel Chion has observed that Fellini particularly exploited the tendency of Italian films of the post-war period to allow considerable freedom in the synching of voices to lip movements, especially in contrast to Hollywood's perceived [...] "obsessive fixation" [...] with the matching of voices to mouths: [...] "In Fellinian extremes, when all those post-synched voices float around bodies, we reach a point where voices--even if we continue to attribute them to the bodies they're assigned--begin to acquire a sort of autonomy, in a baroque and decentered fashion." [...] In the Italian version of La Strada, there are even instances when a character is heard to speak while the actor's mouth is shut tight.|$|E

50|$|In April 1970, Congress {{passed the}} Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act banning the {{advertising}} of cigarettes {{on television and}} radio; {{in order to allow}} the New Year's Day football games to keep their already-sold cigarette ads, the prohibition was set to begin on January 2, 1971. Airing in prime time on the East Coast, the 1971 Orange Bowl thus became the last televised sporting event to carry cigarette ads, the final one (for Winston) airing <b>at</b> 10:54 p.m. (<b>The</b> <b>very</b> <b>last</b> tobacco advertisement, for Virginia Slims, was shown at 11:59 p.m. during a break on The Tonight Show).|$|R
500|$|The 100-page {{screenplay}} detailed plot {{developments and}} many of the visual traits, but very little dialogue was scripted, so the actors were asked to improvise their lines. Noé explained this approach: [...] "For me, directing actors is just finding the right people and putting them in the right mood on the set and letting them go. ... I think the energy has to come on the set <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>last</b> minute." [...] Locations were used in Kabukichō and other parts of Shinjuku. Since much of the film was set in neighbourhoods known for gambling and prostitution, the producers made agreements with the Yakuza crime syndicates before filming some of the on-location scenes. Criminal organisations were not involved in the actual production. Studio scenes set in Tokyo were filmed at Toho Studios. More scenes than originally planned had to be filmed in the studio because of the many complicated crane arrangements. Some of the overhead sequences took a full day to arrange and film. The scenes where Oscar is alive were mostly shot on location, but the crane shots were exclusively taken in the studio; this included revisits to some of the previous locations, which were replicated as large indoor sets. Other shots were taken from helicopters flying over the city. Much attention was paid to the continuity of the geography, and filming was overseen by a supervisor from the visual-effects team.|$|E
500|$|This {{episode was}} {{originally}} {{intended to be a}} crossover episode with the CBS show Picket Fences, which was set in another town in Wisconsin. David E. Kelley, the series creator of Picket Fences, and Chris Carter, the series creator of The X-Files, were talking in a parking lot and thought it might be interesting to have Mulder and Scully visit Rome, Wisconsin for an X-Files episode. Unlike a traditional crossover, the two shows would be shot with different viewpoints and one would be aired as an X-Files episode and the other as an episode of Picket Fences. Ultimately, CBS decided against the crossover and both episodes created ended up becoming stand-alones. Executive producer Robert Goodwin said of the experience [...] "I spent days on the phone with a producer of Picket Fences. We spent days organizing our schedules. Then <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>last</b> minute, of course, we found out that no one had told CBS, and they said 'Forget it. We're having enough trouble on Friday nights without publicizing The X-Files.' It's too bad." [...] The Picket Fences episode intended {{to be part of the}} crossover was called [...] "Away in the Manger" [...] and aired the week following [...] "Red Museum." [...] While every reference to Picket Fences has been purged from the X-Files episode, there still are some small winks left in the Picket Fences episode referring to the happenings at the X-Files, including a mention of Dr. Larson. Ladner, British Columbia served as a location for Delta Glen, while the beef processing plant was shot in a facility in Cloverdale, with the local employees being used for the butchering and cleaning up scenes.|$|E
