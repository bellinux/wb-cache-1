5|$|Another blow to Soviet {{communism}} in the First World {{came with the}} establishment of eurocommunism. Eurocommunists espoused <b>and</b> <b>supported</b> <b>the</b> ideals of Soviet communism {{while at the same time}} supporting rights of the individual.

Originating with the Prague Spring, this new thinking made the First World more skeptical of Soviet {{communism in}} general. The Italian Communist Party notably declared that should war break out in Europe, they would rally to the defense of Italy and resist any Soviet incursion on their nation's soil.|$|E
