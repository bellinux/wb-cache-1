5|$|Loxton had {{no success}} in the first {{representative}} match, scoring 2 and 6 <b>and</b> <b>taking</b> 0/72 in an innings defeat. However, his fortunes turned in the next match against Bombay, when he took 5/92, the first five-wicket innings haul in his first-class career. He also scored 123, {{but was unable to}} force a victory. He carried the form into the next representative match, scoring 55 <b>and</b> <b>taking</b> a total of 3/99 in a drawn encounter. The Victorian continued his all-round form against Bengal, scoring 100 <b>and</b> <b>taking</b> 5/87 in an innings victory. His form tapered away thereafter and he failed to pass 40 and took only a total of only four wickets in the three remaining representative matches. The Commonwealth outfit won the third match but lost the fourth, ceding the series 2–1. Loxton ended the tour with 647 runs at 35.94 and 33 wickets at 31.90, but struggled in the matches against India, scoring 148 runs at 21.14 <b>and</b> <b>taking</b> 7 wickets at 56.14.|$|E

40|$|Age-related {{differences}} in temporal discounting (TD) <b>and</b> risk <b>taking,</b> <b>and</b> their association, {{were examined in}} {{adolescents and young adults}} (n= 337) aged 12 - 27 years. Since monetary rewards are typically used in TD and risk-taking tasks, the association between monetary reward valuation and age and decision making in these tasks was explored as well. TD declined linearly with age, with a particularly sharp decline from 15 to 16 years. In contrast, risk taking was not correlated with age and TD. Reward valuation was not associated with TD <b>and</b> risk <b>taking,</b> <b>and</b> age-related {{differences in}} TD remained significant after controlling for reward valuation. Together, these findings suggest that risk <b>taking</b> <b>and</b> TD are two separate constructs with distinct age-related differences in adolescence and young adulthood...|$|R
