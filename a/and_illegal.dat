Numbers are difficult to determine, since males and juveniles do not return to their birthplace; females lay eggs in the same location every year. Habitat loss <b>and</b> <b>illegal</b> poaching and destructive fishing practices are the biggest threats to these animals.|$|E

5|$|Historically, migratory whales such as blue, fin, sei {{were very}} {{abundant}} in the island waters, but were severely reduced in numbers to near-extinction by commercial <b>and</b> <b>illegal</b> hunts including the mass illegal hunts by Soviet Union and Japan in 1960s to 1970s. Southern right and sperm were most severely hunted among these, hence the area was called the Middle Ground by whalers. It is likely that these two were once seasonal residents around the island where right whales prefer sheltered, very shallow bays while sperm whales mainly inhabit deep waters.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to their high biodiversity, abyssal plains are of great current and future commercial and strategic interest. For example, they {{may be used for}} the legal <b>and</b> <b>illegal</b> disposal of large structures such as ships and oil rigs, radioactive waste and other hazardous waste, such as munitions. They may also be attractive sites for deep-sea fishing, and extraction of oil and gas and other minerals.

In general these two species inhabit remote areas with little interaction with humans, and the main non-natural causes of mortality are hunting, trapping, road-kill and depredation.|$|E
