When the residents in Guyang learnt of the Wu army's approach, they immediately evacuated the area and Ding Feng did not obtain anything in the campaign.

25|$|Nothing {{changed in}} my life since I work all the time. I've spent 30 years writing fiction. For the first 10 years, I worried about money and no one asked how much money I made. The second decade I spent money {{and no one was}} asking <b>about</b> <b>that.</b> <b>And</b> I've spent the last 10 years with {{everyone}} expecting to hear how I spend the money, which I will not do.|$|E
25|$|After {{finishing}} {{the work in}} middle school, she went to Putian high school. At this time, her mother finally accepted her studies because of her brilliant work in middle school and was happy with her accomplishments.However, she stayed in this school for only 1 year because of society’s situation. At that period, Japan started some small wars with China and killed many Chinese. A lot of students in this school were angry <b>about</b> <b>that</b> <b>and</b> held many parades to boycott Japan. But a lot of Japanese soldiers and spies stayed in China, so the parades were suppressed and some students were killed. Because of this, the study could not continue. So Lanying Lin transferred after one {{year in high school}} to a women’s school called Hami Lton School, which was founded by an American. One of her teachers came from American and could not speak Chinese very well, so many of her classmates could not understand his courses. Lanying helped the teacher as an assistant. So every time the teacher taught something in English, Lanying Lin would help to teach in Chinese. Because of this, she was called ‘little teacher’ by her classmates.|$|E

She presents herself in this way as this beautiful woman because she knows the effect that that can have on people. She knows the effect that that has on Stannis, and that can make men do unadvisable things. So the fact that she did that and she uses that power in that way to have this influence on people. That puts her into context as somebody who really does know what she's doing." ...|$|E

Yaron was unfamiliar with Orthodox practice prior to participating in Fill the Void. In order to become better acquainted with Shira's lifestyle, she started memorizing all of the Hebrew blessings, saying, [...] "There's something so beautiful about it because you're being so grateful all the time for everything you do and hoping that everything works out okay and I started doing those blessings every day and it sounds silly but it helps you feel that you are closer to the character." ...|$|E
500|$|The album {{features}} a noticeably darker sound and lyrical subject matter than Vanilla Ice's previous albums, such as To The Extreme and Mind Blowin. The album {{was described by}} CNN as a [...] "shrill confessional" [...] on which the performer [...] "flays his '80s persona, his fractured family and Attention Deficit Disorder, which he has." [...] Vanilla Ice explained that the album [...] "just comes out dark because that's the way I feel I've been treated" [...] and that the album [...] "wasn't intended to be so dark. I opened up to Ross and I told {{him a lot of}} things that happened to me in the past.

Young readers will find this a journey worth taking." [...] Kirkus Reviews found the novel to be a [...] "Thoroughly enjoyable arctic adventure", praising how the adventure tests the main characters' courage as they learn the truth of both worlds. Vicky Smith from Horn Book Magazine found the two main characters well written and the city of Gracehope well structured. While, Smith found the city's origin unbelievable, she recognized that few people would care <b>about</b> <b>that</b> <b>and</b> compared the threat in First Light similar to the one in The City of Ember. Jenifer Hubert from Booklist also compared the novel to The City of Ember and to Neal Shusterman's Downsiders. Hubert criticized the slow beginning and flaws in the mythology and structure of the underground world, but still felt that [...] "the icy setting and global-warming theme are well realized".|$|E

(The chimp returned in later issues to [...] "benchtest" [...] all of Sinclair's subsequent computers.) The review, which was written by PCW staffer Dave Tebbutt, acknowledged that the machine had significant shortcomings but nonetheless represented [...] "absolutely amazing value for money". He described the ZX81 as [...] "a lovely product which will have enormous appeal to people wanting {{to find out more}} about computers, but without it costing them an arm and a leg" [...] and concluded: [...] "If you know nothing about computers and you want to enjoy finding out about them, then this machine offers a value for money way of doing just that. Children will love the ZX81, there can be no question <b>about</b> <b>that,</b> <b>and</b> I suspect that more than a few people who are already familiar with computers will buy one, just to have a bit of fun." ...|$|E
500|$|Vick was {{activated}} to the 53-man roster in mid-September {{and played}} sparingly {{for the rest}} of the season as McNabb's backup. In week 13 against the Falcons, Vick both threw and ran for a touchdown, his first scores since December 2006. Vick was voted by teammates as the winner of the Ed Block Courage Award in December. The award honors players who [...] "exemplify commitment to the principles of sportsmanship and courage". [...] "It means a great deal to me," [...] Vick said at the time. [...] "I was voted unanimously by my teammates. They know what I've been through. I've been through a lot. It's been great to come back and have an opportunity to play and be with a great group of guys. I'm just ecstatic <b>about</b> <b>that</b> <b>and</b> I enjoy every day." [...] The Eagles finished the season with an 11–5 record, making the playoffs. In the team's NFC wildcard game against the Dallas Cowboys on January 9, 2010, Vick threw the longest touchdown pass of his career to rookie Jeremy Maclin for a 76-yard touchdown. The Eagles lost the game 34–14.|$|E
500|$|On 8 February 2010 he {{announced}} his resignation from Fine Gael and from Dáil Éireann, due to having [...] "virtually no influence or input" [...] into shaping Fine Gael's economic policies {{at a time of}} economic upheaval. It emerged that on 2 February, Lee met with the Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny and told him of his intention to resign. Kenny then offered Lee the frontbench position as spokesman on economic planning. Speaking to reporters outside Leinster House soon after his announcement, Lee said it would have been dishonest of him to accept the position: [...] "I had absolutely no input for nine months. I think I had to be honest with myself and honest with the electorate <b>about</b> <b>that</b> <b>and</b> not pretend." [...] Asked if his resignation was a vote of no confidence in Kenny, Lee said there were [...] "certainly lots of large mutterings at the moment in relation to the leader's position". He said he had [...] "minimal involvement" [...] with Fine Gael finance spokesman Richard Bruton. [...] "I had a maximum of two or three conversations with Richard Bruton in a total nine months period. I don’t know how my relationship is with [...] " [...] Lee said.|$|E

500|$|The next day, Davidson found Haywood in his office, {{playing the}} {{keyboard}} part which was later revived for the song's riff. [...] "When we got {{done with the}} other song, I kept going back, saying, 'Man, there's something about what you were playing earlier ... let's mess with that before we leave.' So he started playing it again," [...] Davidson recalled. After the keyboard elements were completed, Scott and Kelley finished the song's music and lyrics at the studio. They discussed ideas for the song; Kelley put forward the basic melody and Scott followed up with her own contribution. After they wrote the lyrics, Davidson proposed that the song's title be [...] "Just a Kiss Goodnight". It was later changed to [...] "Just a Kiss" [...] after Scott felt that [...] "it's cool to have 'just a kiss' goodnight rather than going all the way." [...] Kelley told Country Weekly that the song {{was inspired by the}} band members' experiences: [...] "I remembered being out the first night with Cassie and thinking, 'This is different, and I don't want to give any wrong impression. I [...] don't want to make the wrong move because this feels like something [...] special.' We started talking <b>about</b> <b>that</b> <b>and</b> going back and forth with [...] different experiences when we wrote the song." [...] The song was recorded and mixed by Clarke Schleicher, with assistance from Joe Martino and Andrew Bazinet. The B-side track, [...] "Bottle Up Lightning", was written by Kelley, Haywood, Tony Martin and Wendell Lee Mobley.|$|E
500|$|In the [...] "Inside the Episode" [...] segment {{published}} by HBO {{shortly after the}} airing of the episode, Benioff spoke {{about the relationship between}} Sansa Stark and Jon Snow {{at this point in the}} season, saying [...] "Over the course of this season they've come to really rely upon each other, but she doesn't really trust him completely. She didn't tell him about the meeting with Littlefinger, she didn't tell him that she summoned the Knights of the Vale, there's definitely a little hint of conflict there. So I think there's a little bit of anger <b>about</b> <b>that</b> <b>and</b> a little bit of jealousy, and that relationship will be crucial to watch." [...] Benioff continued by referencing the declaration of Jon Snow as King of the North, noting [...] "We see the second 'King in the North!' scene with Jon and I think it was important to us that it evoked in that first 'King in the North!' scene. Very different circumstances, different environment. In some ways, the evocation of the first one is meant to be a little worrisome because it was a very triumphant moment when Robb is named King in the North but it didn't go so well for the previous King in the North. So I think we have to be a little worried for Jon and at the same time it's a pretty big reversal and, you know, for a character who was dead at the beginning of the season to be declared king at the end of it. He's done well. He's done well in ten short episodes." ...|$|E
2500|$|When I {{first got}} picked for South Australia, Ian said, [...] "You {{got to decide}} what sort of a player {{you want to be}} – whether you want to be an aggressive, attacking player, or more like a {{grafting}} sort of player."

2500|$|I wasn’t so {{interested}} in macro, but what struck me, and this is related to some of my later work, was the assumption that [...] made to solve for equilibrium, that the state variables were obvious....

2500|$|... "To {{tell you}} the truth, I didn't know what the mood was. I feel like an animal that's, like, ready to be sprung from a cage. I've been living a pretty low-key {{domestic}} existence and I miss things. Like, I miss performing, and dancing, and being on the road, that kind of energy. So part of the record is <b>about</b> <b>that.</b> <b>And</b> then the other part is about love. So there's the frivolous side {{of my life and}} then there's the –hopefully– non-frivolous side of my life. I usually make a record that's one or the other, and I feel I did both on this one".|$|E
2500|$|Adele {{revealed}} {{that she was}} struggling emotionally when she composed it: [...] "When I was writing it I was feeling pretty miserable and pretty lonely, which I guess kind of contradicts 'Rolling in the Deep'. Whereas that was about me saying, 'I'm {{going to be fine}} without you', this is me on my knees really." [...] She discussed further the inspiration of the song: [...] "I can imagine being about 40 and looking for him again, only to turn up and find that he's settled with a beautiful wife and beautiful kids and he's completely happy... and I'm still on my own. The song's <b>about</b> <b>that</b> <b>and</b> I'm scared at the thought of that." ...|$|E
