25|$|It {{was shown}} later that higher <b>absorbency</b> of tampons was {{associated}} with an increased risk for TSS, regardless of the chemical composition or the brand of the tampon. The sole exception was Rely, for which the risk for TSS was still higher when corrected for its <b>absorbency.</b> The ability of carboxymethylcellulose to filter the S. aureus toxin that causes TSS may account for the increased risk associated with Rely.|$|E

50|$|Depend was {{originally}} test marketed as the Conform brand in Green Bay, WI. The original products begun {{being made in}} 1983 and were liners, available in regular and extra <b>absorbencies.</b> They could be worn inside underwear or alone, and were held on by small elastic belts. There were two <b>absorbencies,</b> regular to extra. In 1984, Depend Shields were added for slight incontinence in regular and extra absorbencies.These were intended for moderate to heavy bladder incontinence. Beginning in 1985, fitted briefs for heavy to complete bladder incontinence as well as bowel incontinence were added. The briefs were made in youth, small, medium and large. There were various sizes in terms of packaging as well for all three lines of products. The briefs had a green plastic cover while in the undergarments and shields the green plastic {{was covered with a}} thin cloth like cover. In 1987, the undergarments were made in both cloth like non-woven covers and plastic covers. The products were sold in large, cardboard boxes initially.|$|R
50|$|One very {{important}} {{effect of the}} attention to TSS in the 1980s was that the FDA implemented regulation of tampons as medical devices and forced manufacturers to standardize tampon <b>absorbencies</b> and include package inserts that warn tampon users of TSS risk.

25|$|Silk's <b>absorbency</b> {{makes it}} {{comfortable}} to wear in warm weather and while active. Its low conductivity keeps warm air close to the skin during cold weather. It is often used for clothing such as shirts, ties, blouses, formal dresses, high fashion clothes, lining, lingerie, pajamas, robes, dress suits, sun dresses and Eastern folk costumes. For practical use, silk is excellent as clothing that protects from many biting insects that would ordinarily pierce clothing, such as mosquitoes and horseflies. Silk's attractive lustre and drape makes it suitable for many furnishing applications. It is used for upholstery, wall coverings, window treatments (if blended with another fiber), rugs, bedding and wall hangings. While on the decline now, due to artificial fibers, silk has had many industrial and commercial uses, such as in parachutes, bicycle tires, comforter filling and artillery gunpowder bags.|$|E

500|$|Playtex {{created a}} {{consumer}} products subsidiary, Playtex Products Inc., in 1960, which produced baby products, tampons and other consumer goods. It introduced and patented the first plastic tampon applicator in 1973. By 1975, the five largest tampon manufacturers began competing with multimillion-dollar advertising budgets and Playtex became the primary competitor to market-leader Tampax. Playtex introduced a scented tampon that was advertised with the slogan, [...] "When you're wearing a tampon you don't worry about odor. But should you?" [...] It added a warning label saying {{that some women}} may experience irritation from the chemicals after complaints were raised by Planned Parenthood. Tampon manufacturers, including Playtex, were sued for aggressively advertising and competing over <b>absorbency,</b> when some studies found that excessive <b>absorbency</b> leads to toxic shock syndrome. In 1985, a judge offered to reduce an $11 million verdict against Playtex, if they admitted their super-plus tampons were killing women and recalled them.|$|E

[...] Originally, only female astronauts would wear Maximum <b>Absorbency</b> Garments, as the collection devices used by men were unsuitable for women; however, reports of their comfort and effectiveness eventually convinced men to start wearing the diapers as well. [...] Public awareness of astronaut diapers rose significantly following the arrest of Lisa Nowak, a NASA astronaut charged with attempted murder, who gained notoriety in the media when the police reported she had driven 900 miles, with an adult diaper so she would not have to stop to urinate.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to validate non-equilibrium gravitational field-flow fractionation (GrFFF), an immunotag-less method of sorting mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) into subpopulations, for use with MSCs derived from equine muscle tissue, periosteal tissue, bone marrow, and adipose tissue. Cells were collected from 6 young, adult horses, postmortem. Cells were isolated from left semitendinosus muscle tissue, periosteal tissue from the distomedial aspect of the right tibia, bone marrow aspirates from the fourth and fifth sternebrae, and left supragluteal subcutaneous adipose tissue. Aliquots of 800 × 10 (3) MSCs from each tissue source were separated and injected into a ribbon-like capillary device by continuous flow (GrFFF proprietary system). Cells were sorted into 6 fractions and <b>absorbencies</b> [optical density (OD) ] were read. Six fractions from each of the 6 aliquots were then combined to provide pooled fractions that had adequate cell numbers to seed at equal concentrations into assays. Equine muscle tissue-derived, periosteal tissue-derived, bone marrow-derived, and adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells were consistently sorted into 6 fractions that remained viable for use in further assays. Fraction 1 had more cuboidal morphology in culture when compared to the other fractions. Statistical analysis of the fraction <b>absorbencies</b> (OD) revealed a P-value of < 0. 05 when fractions 2 and 3 were compared to fractions 1, 4, 5, and 6. It was concluded that non-equilibrium GrFFF is a valid method for sorting equine muscle tissue-derived, periosteal tissue-derived, bone marrow-derived, and adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells into subpopulations that remain viable, thus securing its potential for use in equine stem cell applications and veterinary medicine...|$|R
