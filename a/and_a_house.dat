5|$|Buildings, {{as defined}} by the National Register, are {{distinguished}} in the traditional sense. Examples include a house, barn, hotel, church, or similar construction. They are created primarily to shelter human activity. The term building, as in outbuilding, can be used to refer to historically and functionally related units, such as a courthouse and a jail or a barn <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>house.</b>|$|E
5|$|Small and {{medium-sized}} estates were managed by single families. The father acted {{as the head}} manager, the sons as field workers. Wives and daughters worked with female servants to weave cloth and produce silk. Very wealthy landowners who had a large peasant following often used a sharecropping system to similar to the government's system for state-owned lands.

5|$|Hudner {{was born}} 31 August 1924 in Fall River, Massachusetts. His father, Thomas Hudner Sr., was a {{businessman}} of Irish descent {{who ran a}} chain of grocery stores, Hudner's Markets. Three brothers were later born, named James, Richard, and Phillip. Hudner entered the prestigious Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts, in 1939. His family {{had a long history}} in the academy, with his father graduating in 1911 and his uncle, Harold Hudner, graduating in 1921. Eventually the three younger Hudner children would attend the academy as well; James in 1944, Richard in 1946 and Phillip in 1954. During his time in the high school, Thomas was active in several organizations, serving as a team captain in the school track team as well {{as a member of the}} football and lacrosse teams, a class officer, a member of student council <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>house</b> councilor.|$|E
5|$|Immediately after Randolph {{finished}} {{laying out}} the Virginia Plan, Charles Pinckney of South Carolina presented his own plan to the Convention. As Pinckney did not write it down, the only evidence of the plan are Madison's notes, so the details are somewhat vague. It was a confederation, or treaty, among the thirteen states. There {{was to be a}} bicameral legislature made up of a Senate <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>House</b> of Delegates. The House would have one member for every one thousand inhabitants. The House would elect Senators who would serve by rotation for four years and represent one of four regions. Congress would meet in a joint session to elect a President, and would also appoint members of the cabinet. Congress, in joint session, would serve as the court of appeal of last resort in disputes between states. Pinckney did also provide for a supreme Federal Judicial Court. The Pinckney plan was not debated, but it may have been referred to by the Committee of Detail.|$|E
5|$|In late 1869, Earp courted 20-year-old Urilla Sutherland (c. 1849–1870), the {{daughter}} of William and Permelia Sutherland, who operated the Exchange Hotel in Lamar. They were married by his father Nicholas in Lamar on January 10, 1870, and in August 1870, Wyatt bought {{a lot on the}} outskirts of town for $50, where he built a house. Urilla was pregnant and about to deliver their first child when she suddenly died from typhoid fever. In November, Earp sold the lot <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>house</b> on it for $75. Hoping to keep the office to which he had been appointed, he ran against his elder half-brother Newton for the office of constable. The Earps may have hoped to keep the job in the family one way or another. Wyatt won by 137 votes to Newton's 108, but their father Nicholas lost the election for justice of the peace in a very close four-way race.|$|E

5|$|It {{is unclear}} if the castle and town played any {{part in the}} English Civil War between 1642–45, {{although}} cannonballs from the period have been discovered within the castle. Local oral tradition states that the castle was slighted, or deliberately destroyed, during the war. Stones from the castle were used for local building work by the 17th century onwards, and by the 18th century a house and shop had been constructed in the eastern bailey of the castle, along with a yard and garden. A gallows operated at the castle until 1790. Buildings continued to encroach on the castle. By {{the end of the}} 19th century a school <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>house,</b> Castle Lodge, had been built in the castle grounds. Other buildings were built as lean-to's against the castle walls.|$|E

Jobs bonds with Lisa over her MacPaint art and agrees to provide more money <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>house.</b> Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak asks Jobs to acknowledge the Apple II team in his presentation, but Jobs feels that mentioning the computer (which he considers obsolete) is unwise.|$|E
5|$|John Douglas {{was born}} at Park Cottage, Sandiway, Cheshire, on 11 April 1830 and baptised on 16 May 1830 at St Mary's Church, Weaverham. He was {{the second of the}} four children, and the only son, of John Douglas and his wife Mary née Swindley (1792–1863). John Douglas senior was born in Northampton about 1798–1800 and his wife was born in Aldford, a village on the Eaton estate in Cheshire; her father was the village {{blacksmith}} at Eccleston, another village in the Eaton estate. John Douglas senior was by trade a builder and joiner, and also described himself as a surveyor and a timber merchant. In 1835 he acted as architect for a house at Hartford, a village between Sandiway and Northwich. At the time of the 1851 census he was employing 48men.

5|$|Meanwhile, Peter, {{with help}} from his {{children}} Chris and Meg, decides to create his own animated series about a trio of handicapped ducks entitled Handi-Quacks. All of Meg's reasonable and sometimes rational suggestions are shot down by Peter and Chris in favor of their more unusual and nonsensical ideas. Peter eventually fires Meg. He and Chris then decide on a joke involving a wood stove <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>house</b> of cards, and invite Cleveland, Quagmire and Joe to voice the characters. Although {{it is suggested that}} the crudely animated and developed pilot episode will likely fail, CEO Peter Chernin enjoys it and agrees to air the show, but Peter becomes angered when he suggests that the character Poopyface Tomato Nose's nose be a plum instead of a tomato. Peter's passion about his work impresses Chernin into allowing him to air the episode unedited, but he decides not to let the episode be aired at all, which he later regrets.|$|E
5|$|Millen {{was born}} in Deal, Kent in 1860 to John Bullock Millen, who was a pilot of the Cinque Ports, and Charlotte (née Davis).

5|$|Recently, {{contention}} arose {{over what}} kind of institution the Hurva would be. Secularist and nationalist-religious activists opposed the notion of another synagogue in the Old City and wanted the site to become a museum presenting the historical saga of the Jewish Quarter and displaying archaeological finds unearthed there. They viewed the appointment of Kook as the rabbi while the structure was still a shell as a move aimed at preventing a Modern Orthodox rabbi, {{who would have been}} more amenable to a broader utilisation of the site, from getting the position. Rabbi of the Jewish Quarter, Avigdor Nebenzahl, has been clear that he wants the building to serve as a synagogue <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>house</b> of study.|$|E

5|$|The day of filming in the salvage yard, {{which took}} place at LA Japanese Auto Parts in Sun Valley, California, was {{abnormally}} hot according to Lauren Vélez. The Airstream trailer in which Dexter's victim is found was brought into the salvage yard for filming externally, but was assembled on a studio sound stage for shooting scenes inside the trailer. Erik King remarked that the trailer was dirty, odorous and humid—"all the things we needed it to be". Other filming locations included a waterfront house on Hibiscus Island in Biscayne Bay, Florida as the Castillos' home, an empty field next to Sun Valley's Tujunga Wash where a young Debra practices shooting with Harry's pistol, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>house</b> in a residential neighborhood of Long Beach, California which stands in for Dexter's childhood home.|$|E
5|$|The {{depression}} dropped over 1inch (25mm) {{of precipitation}} {{across much of}} the Dominican Republic; Santo Domingo reported a peak total of 3.9in (98mm). The rainfall led to flooding, primarily east and west of the capital city, while five rivers overflowed their banks. Several roads were inundated, obstructing traffic. The flooding collapsed a sports center <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>house,</b> injuring two people inside. Further inland, 160people had to be evacuated when more than 100houses were flooded. Crop damage was also reported. In Pedernales, gusty winds uprooted trees, several of which fell on power lines which caused power outages in the town. The rainfall was welcomed in the country, as conditions were dry in the preceding months. Light flooding also occurred in eastern Jamaica, though damage there, if any, is unknown.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} tunnel {{as built}} {{was designed by}} Sir Alexander Binnie and built by S. Pearson & Sons, between 1892 and 1897, for whom Ernest William Moir was the lead engineer. It was constructed using tunnelling shield and compressed air techniques and a Greathead shield (named after its inventor, James Henry Greathead). It was lit by three rows of incandescent street lights. To clear the site in Greenwich, more than 600 people had to be rehoused, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>house</b> reputedly once owned by Sir Walter Raleigh had to be demolished. The work force was largely drawn from immigrants; the tunnel lining was manufactured in Glasgow, while the manual labour came from provincial England, particularly Yorkshire.|$|E
