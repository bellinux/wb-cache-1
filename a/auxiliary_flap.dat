40|$|An {{investigation}} {{has been conducted}} with the Langley helicopter tower to obtain basic performance and control characteristics of the Raman rotor system. Blade-pitch control is obtained in this configuration by utilizing an <b>auxiliary</b> <b>flap</b> to twist the blades. Rotor thrust and power required were measured for the hovering condition and over a range of wind velocities from 0 to 30 miles per hour. The control characteristics and the transient response of the rotor to various control movements were also measured. The hovering-performance data are presented as {{a survey of the}} wake velocities and the variation of torque coefficient with thrust coefficient. The power required for the test rotor to hover at a thrust of 1350 pounds and a rotor speed of 240 rpm is approximately 6. 5 percent greater than that estimated for a conventional rotor of the same diameter and solidity. It is believed that most of this difference is caused by th e flap servomechanism. The reduction in total power required for sustentation of the single-rotor configuration tested at various wind velocities and at the normal operating rotor thrust was found to be similar to the theoretical and experimental results for ro tors with conventionally actuated pitch. The control effectiveness was determined as a function of rotor speed. Sufficient control was available to give a thrust range of 0 to 1500 pounds and a rotor tilt of plus or minus 7 degrees. The time lag between flap motion and blade-pitch response is approximately 0. 02 to 0. 03 second. The response of the rotor following the blade-pitch response {{is similar to that of}} a rotor with conventionally actuated pitch changes. The over-all characteristics of the rotor investigated indicate that satisfactory performance and control characteristics were obtained...|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was made in}} the N. A. C. A. 7 - by 10 - foot wind tunnel to determine the aerodynamic section characteristics of an N. A. C. A. 23012 airfoil with a single main slotted flap equipped successively with <b>auxiliary</b> <b>flaps</b> of the plain, split, and slotted types. A test installation mas used in which an airfoil of 7 -foot span was mounted vertically between the upper and the lower sides of the closed test section so that two-dimensional flow was approximated. On the basis of maximum lift coefficient, low drag at moderate and high lift coefficients, and high drag at high lift coefficients, the optimum combination of the arrangements was found to be the double slotted <b>flap.</b> All the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>flaps</b> tested, however, increased the magnitudes of the pitching moments over those of the main slotted flap alone...|$|R

Data showing comparison of high-speed aerodynamic characteristics of the model when equipped with each wing, {{the effect of the}} <b>auxiliary</b> control <b>flaps</b> on aerodynamic characteristics, and elevator effectiveness for the model with the 66 -series wing {{are presented}}. High-speed aerodynamic characteristics of the model were improved with the 66 -series wing...|$|R
25|$|Fitted with {{retractable}} <b>auxiliary</b> wing <b>flaps</b> enabling a {{wing loading}} of around 12.5lb per square foot, the Messenger featured triple fins and rudders {{in order to}} maintain sufficient controllability down to the exceptionally low stalling speed of 25mph.|$|R
2500|$|Chief Engineer Toshio Ozaki (name {{often seen}} as Norio Ozaki, but this is {{incorrect}} because the Kanji for both first names are the same and often confused) chose a mid-wing arrangement for the B7A to provide for an internal bomb-bay and to ensure enough clearance for the plane's [...] four-bladed propeller. This in turn necessitated the adoption of an inverted gull wing, reminiscent of the F4U Corsair, in order to shorten {{the length of the}} main landing gear. The wing featured extendable ailerons with a ten-degree range of deflection, enabling them to act as <b>auxiliary</b> <b>flaps.</b> Dive brakes were fitted underneath just outboard of the fuselage. The B7A's outer wing panels were designed to fold upwards hydraulically for carrier stowage, reducing its overall span from [...] to approximately [...]|$|R

The complete aerodynamic section characteristics and envelope polar curves are given for each airfoil-flap combination. The effect of airfoil thickness is shown, and comparisons are made of single slotted flaps with double slotted flaps on each of the airfoils...|$|R
5000|$|The fastest World War II {{fighters were}} the first {{aircraft}} to experience Mach tuck. Their wings were not designed to counter Mach tuck because research on supersonic airfoils was just beginning; areas of supersonic flow, together with shock waves and flow separation, were present on the wing. This condition was known {{at the time as}} compressibility burble and was known to exist on propeller tips at high aircraft speeds. The P-38 was the first 400 mph fighter, and it suffered more than the usual teething troubles. It had a thick, high-lift wing, distinctive twin booms and a single, central nacelle containing the cockpit and armament. It quickly accelerated to terminal velocity in a dive. The short stubby fuselage had a detrimental effect in reducing the critical Mach number of the 15% thick wing center section with high velocities over the canopy adding to those on the upper surface of the wing. Mach tuck occurred at speeds above Mach 0.65; the air flow over the wing center section became transonic, causing a loss of lift. The resultant change in downwash at the tail caused a nose-down pitching moment and the dive to steepen (Mach tuck). The aircraft was very stable in this condition making recovery from the dive very difficult. Dive recovery (<b>auxiliary)</b> <b>flaps</b> were added to the underside of the wing (P-38J-LO) to increase the wing lift and downwash at the tail to allow recovery from transonic dives.|$|R
