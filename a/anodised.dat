40|$|Chromic acid <b>anodising</b> {{has been}} used since 1923 {{as a means of}} affording a level of {{corrosion}} resistance to aluminium alloys; the original method of <b>anodising</b> was patented by Bengough and Stuart and is still used today although more commonly a modified version is used. Recently, environmental pressure has resulted in alternatives to chromic acid <b>anodising</b> being sought. A key to finding a suitable alternative is to fully understand why chromic acid <b>anodising</b> affords a higher level of corrosion resistance compared with other forms of protection. The current research focuses on the pre-treatment and <b>anodising</b> of two aluminium alloys, AA 1050 A and AA 2024 T 351, the film development process being investigated with the high purity 1050 alloy and the corrosion resistant properties afforded by chromic acid <b>anodising</b> investigated with the 2024 alloy.

2500|$|The fatal {{fatigue crack}} in the inner lower boom had {{initiated}} at a bolt hole at Station 143, the rearmost of five bolt holes for attachment of the inner engine nacelle to the lower boom. [...] These holes were ⅞ inch (2.22cm) diameter and were <b>anodised</b> to resist wear and corrosion. [...] A cadmium-plated steel bush of length 1 ⅝ inch (4.13cm), chamfered at one end, was pressed into each hole. [...] Each bush was an interference fit in the hole to improve fatigue resistance and substantially increase the retirement life of the inner lower boom.|$|E
2500|$|The central atrium was {{completely}} glazed behind deep concrete balconies; this arrangement {{was to make}} it conducive to study. Although there was good natural light, the design was an early recognition of solar gain and the damage it can cause to books. The large windows of the reference library face inwards to reduce traffic noise from the Inner Ring road. On the outside the windows were high level narrow strips with black <b>anodised</b> window frames. The space below the central atrium of the library was designed to define a civic square with gardens, pools, waterfalls and fountains, and potentially to form an open-air exhibition space. Six pools were {{to be placed in}} and around this square. Madin also designed the semi-circular amphitheatre around the Chamberlain Memorial in Chamberlain Square to frame the entrance to the library and the new civic square.|$|E
2500|$|The {{investigation}} {{determined that}} some {{years before the}} accident, the bush at Station 143 had been pushed upwards so the chamfer and 0.055-inch (1.40mm) of the parallel-sided portion protruded beyond the upper surface of the boom. [...] The exposed end of the bush was then struck with a conical tool applied to the bore. [...] This action slightly flared the exposed end and left the external diameter 0.0038 inch (0.097mm) oversize. The bush was then pushed upwards {{out of the hole}} and re-inserted from the lower surface. [...] As the bush was being re-inserted its flared end broached the <b>anodised</b> material and a small amount of aluminium from the wall of the hole. [...] This broaching action scored the wall of the hole and left its diameter slightly oversize so the bush was not an interference fit anywhere except at its flared end. [...] Scoring of the wall of the hole and the absence of an interference fit left the inner lower boom vulnerable to developing fatigue cracks at Station 143.|$|E

The definitive article is available at: [URL] use of corrosion resistant and adhesion promoting films and coatings is established industrial practice for many fatigue sensitive components and structures. However, recent environmental legislation restricting the use of a range of toxic heavy metals and their derivative processes, such as chromic acid <b>anodising</b> (CAA), has meant that a number of new coatings systems and pretreatments are currently being developed to replace the traditional processes still in use. Typical of these new systems are the boric–sulphuric acid <b>anodising</b> (BSAA) process, which can be modified to provide excellent adhesive bonding properties, the sulphuric acid <b>anodising</b> process, which includes an additional electrolytic phosphoric acid deoxidising stage (EPAD) to produce a duplex oxide layer, and the recently patented ACDC sulphuric acid <b>anodising</b> process which produces a two layered oxide film which can be tailored to produce different porosity volume fractions within each layer.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{microstructure}} on corrosion resistance and <b>anodising</b> behaviour of a 3 rd generation lithium-containing aluminium alloy, AA 2099 -T 8, has been studied. Microstructural characterisation of the alloy has shown elongated grains with high angle grain boundaries and approximately equiaxed subgrains with low angle grain boundaries. Two types of constituent particles {{of high and}} reduced contents of copper were found, which are present individually or {{in the form of}} multiphase particles. The alloy also contains rod-like Al-Cu-Mn-Li and spherical (Al 3 Zr) dispersoids, and fine age hardening precipitates of T 1 (Al 2 CuLi), (Al 3 Li) and (Al 2 Cu). Immersion testing in a chloride-containing solution revealed two types of localised corrosion sites: one was initiated from intermetallics and quickly became passivated; the other lasted for the course of testing, with extensive boundary attack. The latter has been correlated to grains and subgrains with relatively high stored energy. Alkaline etching removed intermetallics from alloy surface; generated a copper-enriched layer in the alloy matrix immediately beneath the residual alumina film; and gradually developed a surface nanotexture. The surface nanotexture has been correlated to the formation of copper-rich nanoparticles within the copper-enriched layer. <b>Anodising</b> the alloy in tartaric-sulphuric acid disclosed that copper in the alloy matrix could be occluded in the anodic film material as copper-rich nanoparticles or be oxidized and incorporated into the film material as copper ions, depending on the <b>anodising</b> voltage. In the latter case, the process was accompanied by oxygen gas generation within the film material, forming anodic films with lateral porosity. Intermetallics of different compositions behaved differently during <b>anodising,</b> leading to modification of the morphology and composition of anodic films. Concerning the effect of alkaline etching on <b>anodising</b> behaviour of the alloy, the removal of intermetallics increased <b>anodising</b> efficiency; the pre-developed copper-enriched layer advanced the establishment of the steady-state film/alloy interface. Variation of copper-enriched layer structure is revealed by the detection of copper-rich nanoparticles in the copper-enriched layer. The copper-rich nanoparticles have structures consistent with either θ", θ' or θ phases. Machining damage can be detected not only by chromic acid <b>anodising</b> (CAA) but also by tartaric-sulphuric acid <b>anodising</b> (TSAA).
