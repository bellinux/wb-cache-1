40|$|A {{diatomite}} layer {{covered by}} two till units {{was found at}} Horonkylä, Teuva, Pohjanmaa, western Finland. The diatomite layer represents infill sediment in a freshwater lake formed within a dead ice hollow in a glaciofluvial formation interpreted as an esker. The deposition of diatomite was terminated by advancing ice, which deformed underlying sediments and deposited the first till unit (Horonkylä till) in the sequence. During the ice retreat a silty clay layer was formed in the basin close to the ice front. A renewed glacal <b>advance</b> <b>deposited</b> the upper till unit (Horonpää till). According to the diatom flora the diatomite was deposited in a shallow, freshwater basin in which at least slight water level changes occurred during the sedimentation. On the basis of biostratigraphy the diatomite was deposited during Brörup interstadial. The pollen flora indicates a forest succession from an initial birch forest to a denser pine forest. Dating of the diatomite layer is based exclusively on the biostratigraphy. The silty clay layer was deposited in a basin close to the ice front and {{the initial stages of}} sedimentation were interrupted by a short pulse of secondary Eemian material...|$|R
40|$|Cooperative {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} and {{effective}} systems in terms of development of human civilization. Cooperative institutions are organised and managed on the principle of cooperation, self-help and mutual help. There are different types of cooperative institutions functioning in India. As far as the institutional credit structure is concerned, cooperatives play a significant role in this regard. Cooperative credit institutions are spread all over India and are providing their services at the grass root level. As main portion of the population in India lives in rural areas so it is important to strengthen the cooperative credit institutions in these areas. The major advantage of the institutions is their strong branch network which covers entire area of the country. This paper attempts to study the State Co-operative Banking in India. The paper mainly focuses on the branch networking, capital, <b>advances,</b> <b>deposits,</b> working capital and recovery performance of these banks in India.

This review began with a field hearing held in Birmingham, Alabama in January 2012. Both at the field hearing {{and in response to}} a subsequent request for information, the CFPB heard from consumers who use these products. On one hand, some consumers provided favorable responses about the speed at which these loans are given,the availability of these loans for some consumers who may not qualify for other credit products, and consumers' ability to use these loans as a way to avoid overdrawing a deposit account or paying a bill late. On the other hand, consumers raised concerns such as the risk of being unable to repay the loan while still having enough money left over for other expenses,the high cost of the loan, and aggressive debt collection practices in the case of delinquency or default. These discussions and submissions underscore the importance of undertaking a data-driven analysis of the use of these products and the longer-term outcomes that borrowers experience. Because Congress authorized the CFPB to supervise both depository and non-depository institutions, over the past year {{we have been able to}} obtain data from a number of market participants that offer either <b>deposit</b> <b>advance</b> products or payday loans. This white paper summarizes the initial findings of the CFPB's analysis of payday loans and <b>deposit</b> <b>advances.</b> It describes the features of typical payday loan and <b>deposit</b> <b>advance</b> products.

40|$|This quick guide {{looks at}} the level of Australia’s foreign debt, the {{interest}} liability on foreign debt and how these have changed over time. It also looks at foreign debt as a component of net foreign investment, the other component being equity investment. Finally, given that Australia’s gross foreign debt is now bigger than its annual gross domestic product (GDP), the quick guide also considers whether our foreign debt level is too high. What is foreign debt? Foreign debt is the amount borrowed from non-residents by residents of Australia. It includes securities such as bonds, as well as loans, <b>advances,</b> <b>deposits,</b> debentures and overdrafts. Foreign debt is a subset of the financial obligations that make up Australia’s foreign investment position.   It is distinguished from other forms of foreign investment capital inflow such as equity investment (foreign ownership) by the obligation to pay interest and/or repay capital. Foreign debt is {{not to be confused with}} national debt, which is the total government debt. National debt comprises government borrowings from overseas residents and government borrowings from Australian residents and thus excludes overseas borrowings by the private sector. A distinction is made between gross and net foreign debt. Gross foreign debt is the total amount of borrowing from non-residents. Net foreign debt is equal to gross foreign debt minus the sum of lending by residents of Australia to non-residents and official reserve assets held by the Reserve Bank...|$|R

40|$|The fine {{structure}} of cerebral amyloid angiopathy, especially in small and presumably early deposits, was examined by immunolabeling of the beta/A 4 protein in semithin and ultrathin sections from brains with Alzheimer's disease. The following findings emerged: 1) in large leptomeningeal arteries, small, focal amyloid deposits appear {{to consist of}} clusters of delicate (approximately 8 nm diameter) amyloid fibrils, not previously described, in the outermost part of the basement membrane (BM) at the media-adventitia junction; 2) in small leptomeningeal arteries and perforating cortical arterioles, small foci of delicate amyloid fibrils were observed within the BM. They appeared mostly in the outer portion of the BM, around intact smooth muscle cells, {{rather than in the}} subendothelial region. In larger and presumably more <b>advanced</b> <b>deposits,</b> coarse amyloid fibrils (approximately 10 nm) occupied the abluminal BM, and adjacent smooth muscle cells showed degeneration; and 3) in capillaries, small amounts of delicate (approximately 8 nm) amyloid fibrils, not previously described, were seen within the BM in the smallest discernible deposits. The BM at these sites was abnormally folded and layered. In larger deposits, amyloid fibrils appeared to extravasate from the outer BM of the capillary into the neuropil and were surrounded by astrocytic foot processes and/or microglia. Our results suggest that vascular amyloid fibrils may first be formed within the abluminal vascular BM, that is, outside of cells. The BM may trap degradative intermediates of the amyloid precursor protein that contain the beta/A 4 region, and local proteases may then cleave them further to yield amyloidogenic fragments...|$|R

Electric power companies are now-a-days adopting some advanced systems such as computer aided monitoring control and management of electric power, so that it can provide better services to electric consumers. This project results an approach to automate the electricity billing system. The concept of prepaid is one of the emerging fields for the paid service providers. The concept is becoming so popular because it has so many advantages. The services like electricity, gas, water telephone etc are now days get privatized. The service provider company some time incurs heavy losses due to non collection of bills. These service items cannot be recovered from the user after providing, so the concept of prepaid reduce risk and increase profitability. Also the bill collection infrastructure is not necessary which intern increase improve the efficiency of the service providing companies. The concept of prepaid starts in the manual form by receiving <b>advance</b> <b>deposits</b> but now due to the revolution of IT and electronics industry the manual recharging process is replaced with automatic and electronic recharging.
