40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} impact of service sector trade {{liberalization}} on the world economy by a ten-region, eleven-sector CGE model with import embodied technology transfer from developed countries to developing countries. Simulation results show that service sector trade liberalization not only directly affects world service production and trade, but also has significant implications for other sectors in the economy. The major channel of the impact is through inter-industry input-output relations and TFP growth induced from services imported by developing countries from developed countries, which may be embodied with new information and <b>advanced</b> <b>technology.</b> <b>Service,</b> Trade, Liberalization, Inter-INDUSTRY, Links, Import, Embodied, Technology, Transfer, Model,...|$|E
40|$|This study builds an {{integrative}} {{framework to}} delineate {{the process of}} growing entrepreneurial firms in developing countries. Deriving from the existing entrepreneurship literature, this thesis uses two notions to delineate the process of growth of indigenous firms: entrepreneurial intent and entrepreneurial capability. Then, drawing on the literature of economic development, it identifies three key sectors, the state, {{the market and the}} social sector, that foster entrepreneurial intent and cultivate entrepreneurial capability. The research setting is the information technology (IT) industries in China and Taiwan, each of which has had impressive performance when compared with their counterparts in other developing countries. This study differentiates the growth of entrepreneurial firms into three stages, getting started, getting there, and staying there, and proceeds to analyze the comparative-historical experiences of six IT firms, three in China and three in Taiwan. The firms in China are the <b>Advanced</b> <b>Technology</b> <b>Service</b> Division (ATSD), Lenovo Computer, and Great Wall Computer. The firms in Taiwan are United Microelectronics Corporation (UMC), Acer, and Vanguard International Semiconductor (VIS). It is found that at the stage of getting started, the government tends to be key among the three sectors, and can broadly influence the firms' entrepreneurial intent by building the national institution context, and more specifically through industrial policies. At the stage of getting there, the domestic social sector becomes more salient, and can transfer technology to entrepreneurial firms either from abroad or from their own research; they can also help defend entrepreneurial firms in intellectual property disputes with multinational firms. At the stage of staying there, due to their advanced technology, multinationals as forces in the market become more prevalent, and can enhance or destroy the capability of entrepreneurial firms. Overall, the state can act as context builder, champion and confronter; the social sector can play the roles of capability builder and capability defender, while the market, via multinational firms, can play the roles of capability destroyer and capability enhancer...|$|E

The {{approach}} of this study was conducted by using Foresight methods, which means: a planning process in order to obtain the definition of the exercise scope, the establishment of relevant aspects for asking international experts about the {{aim of this}} Foresight study. These experts are directors of several NREN around the world. The main result concludes, among other things, that more network services are being built to provide dark fibber links to users, increasing the flexibility and agility in the delivery of new and better services. It is a trend that will continue and that should be encouraged. Also, collaborations with mobile service providers should be established to offer academically innovative solutions to users. Other results show that there is a potential, which opens the participation of non-university hospitals for remote care in the health sector. This is corroborated in the expert’s opinion to qualify for being of high importance for the connectivity of hospitals and clinics. The results of this study are useful for any NREN around the world, but especially they have been used as input for the Colombian NREN.|$|R

The NRENs are physical telecommunication networks of high speed, unique in each country and independent from the commercial internet. They are designed to be an essential infrastructure for the development of education and research in a country, facilitating the reliable, efficient and cost-effective exchange of computer resources through services for communication and collaboration among researchers. Each country decides which groups will benefit from its national research and education network, and many choose to expand connectivity and services to libraries, hospitals, laboratories and governmental organizations [2, 3]. The orientation to use telecommunications for educational purposes already generates research works, commercial products and adapted services, and they become a hinge element for collaboration and scientific development of all countries. In order to identify emerging generic technologies which probably generate the greatest economic and social benefits, future study processes as Foresight - as a set of systematic attempts to look at in the long term the future of science, technology, economy or society [4] - could resolve the research question: What are the most important trends related to <b>advanced</b> <b>technology</b> <b>services</b> in the NRENs?

We analyzed 4 854 research documents originating in Panama in the Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED). Most are formal articles and nearly all are in English. The main fields are ecology, botany, zoology, evolution and aquatic biology. Most collaboration is done with USA, Germany, United Kingdom, Canada, and Brazil and the largest numbers of articles are published by the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute, the University of Panama, the Gorgas Institute, the Children’s Hospital, the Institute of Scientific Research and <b>Advanced</b> <b>Technology</b> <b>Services,</b> the Technological University of Panama, the Ministry of Health, and the University of Chiriquí. Keyword terms show a concentration on tropical forest trees, diversity and variation, considering mostly the effects of particular physical and biological causes. Output has grown steadily for several decades and continues to grow. The SCI-EXPANDED citations remain relatively stable and the lifespan of articles exceeds 20 years, with top citation four years after publication. The Impact Factor as currently measured is not appropriate to know the impact of Panamanian research. Our results only apply to the literature in the SCI-EXPANDED. Panama has nearly 100 scientific journals that are not taken into account by the SCI-EXPANDED.
