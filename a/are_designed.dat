5|$|The {{architectural}} {{image of}} the Taichung Station integrates the regional transit through middle Taiwan and is a gateway to Taichung. It {{is the core of}} future development and will determine the {{image of the}} entire city. The planning had three levels: regional, citywide and street-level. The building group with vertical volume is designed in accordance with regional considerations; the stations with the same structure <b>are</b> <b>designed</b> in accordance with city-level concerns; the supporting facilities <b>are</b> <b>designed</b> to respond to the street-level needs of the site.|$|E

5|$|An {{example of}} a seductive detail in a {{training}} context might be a training class that includes cartoons on slides containing tips for effective supervision. Although not necessarily relevant to the topic, the cartoons <b>are</b> <b>designed</b> to make the training material more interesting, but the results of multiple studies suggest that their inclusion will harm recall from the primary training content.|$|E
5|$|Another theory {{states that}} {{chromosomal}} toxin-antitoxin systems <b>are</b> <b>designed</b> to be bacteriostatic rather than bactericidal. RelE, for example, {{is a global}} inhibitor of translation during nutrient stress, and its expression reduces the chance of starvation by lowering the cell's nutrient requirements. A homologue of mazF toxin called mazF-mx is essential for fruiting body formation in Myxococcus xanthus.|$|E
5|$|As noted, the Big King {{sandwich}} {{was introduced}} to compete directly with the McDonald's Big Mac sandwich. It joins a group of sandwiches from other vendors that <b>are</b> <b>designed</b> as counters to the more well-known McDonald's sandwich. This includes the Big Shef sandwich originally from now-defunct chain Burger Chef and occasionally produced as a LTO from current trademark owner Hardees.|$|E

5|$|Auditory camouflage, {{at least}} in the form of noise reduction, is practised in various ways. The {{rubberized}} hull of military submarines absorbs sonar waves and {{can be seen as a}} form of auditory camouflage. Some modern helicopters <b>are</b> <b>designed</b> to be quiet. Combat uniforms are usually equipped with buttons rather than snap fasteners or velcro to reduce noise.|$|E

5|$|Culture {{techniques}} <b>are</b> <b>designed</b> {{to promote}} the growth and identify particular bacteria, while restricting {{the growth of the}} other bacteria in the sample. Often these techniques <b>are</b> <b>designed</b> for specific specimens; for example, a sputum sample will be treated to identify organisms that cause pneumonia, while stool specimens are cultured on selective media to identify organisms that cause diarrhoea, while preventing growth of non-pathogenic bacteria. Specimens that are normally sterile, such as blood, urine or spinal fluid, are cultured under conditions designed to grow all possible organisms. Once a pathogenic organism has been isolated, it can be further characterised by its morphology, growth patterns (such as aerobic or anaerobic growth), patterns of hemolysis, and staining.|$|E
5|$|During the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s {{the young}} city grew rapidly, adding over 35,000 {{residents}} each decade. Coral Springs has notably strict building codes, which <b>are</b> <b>designed</b> {{to maintain the}} city's distinctive aesthetic appeal. The city government's effective fiscal management has maintained high bond ratings, and the city has won accolades for its overall livability, its low crime rate, and its family-friendly orientation.|$|E
