5|$|The {{television}} series Jackass {{is referred to}} frequently by Peter <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>neighbors,</b> and is the principal reason that they try to do stunts. Johnny Knoxville cameoes and takes a shotgun blast which blows off part of his face. In the episode, while being launched off a ramp and flying through the air, Peter wears the costume from The Greatest American Hero and sings the series' theme song.|$|E
5|$|It is {{said that}} the MacIntyre chief {{at the time of}} the Jacobite rising of 1745, James (born c. 1727), would have joined the clans {{rallying}} to Prince Charles Edward Stuart but was dissuaded from doing so by his wife, who was a Campbell, <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>neighbors.</b> His loyalties to the Campbells were further deepened by the fact that his legal studies had been sponsored by the Campbell Earl of Breadalbane. Nonetheless, many MacIntyres were in the clan regiment of Stewart of Appin in the campaign of 1745–46, but they did not serve as an independent body.|$|E
5|$|After Barrington {{suffered}} a paralytic stroke in early 1919, {{he was unable}} to perform. He spent {{the rest of his life}} in poverty, although his fellow actors held benefits and made other efforts to help him, and his brothers <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>neighbors</b> in East Hagbourne, Berkshire, helped him as he became increasingly disabled and eventually unable even to speak. He died in 1922 while living at the St. James's Infirmary, Balham, in South London, at the age of 69 and is buried in Lower Morden Lane at the Morden Cemetery, also known as Battersea New Cemetery, in Surrey. On the 75th anniversary of Barrington's death, a granite monument with a photoplaque of Barrington as Pooh-Bah was dedicated to him at the Morden Cemetery, by members of the Gilbert and Sullivan Society, the Sir Arthur Sullivan Society and others.|$|E

5|$|On April 20, 1925, Wright {{returned}} from eating {{dinner in the}} detached dining room when he noticed smoke billowing from his bedroom. By that time of night, most of the employees had returned home; only a driver and one apprentice were left in the complex. Unlike the first Taliesin fire, Wright {{was able to get}} help immediately. However, the fire quickly spread due to high winds. Despite the efforts of Wright <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>neighbors</b> to extinguish the flame, the living quarters of the second Taliesin were quickly destroyed. However, the workrooms where Wright kept his architectural drafts were spared. According to Wright's autobiography, the fire appeared to have begun near a telephone in his bedroom. Wright also mentioned a lightning storm approaching immediately before noticing the fire. Wright scholars speculate that the storm may have caused an electrical surge through the telephone system, sparking the fire.|$|E
5|$|Peter {{decides to}} go fishing with Quagmire and Joe, but when Quagmire does not show up, they decide {{to try to find}} him at his house. After {{entering}} his home, they discover that he has hanged himself in a fit of autoerotic asphyxiation. Attempting to save his life, they take him to the hospital, where they discover that he is in a coma. Peter invites Quagmire's sister, Brenda, to visit him at the hospital, and she manages to wake up her brother. Brenda also brings along Jeffery Fecalman, her obnoxious, aggressive and abusive boyfriend, who harasses her throughout the night much to the fury and concern of Quagmire <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>neighbors.</b>|$|E
25|$|Jamestown {{was spared}} from destruction, however, {{due to a}} Virginia Indian boy named Chanco who, after {{learning}} of the planned attacks from his brother, gave warning to colonist Richard Pace with whom he lived.

25|$|Much of the {{evidence}} entered against her was from events that had happened {{five or ten years}} previous. Phillip and Sarah Nelson testified that Robert Shilleto (by then deceased, so he could not affirm or deny the story) had repeatedly complained that Margaret was a witch, afflicting him until he died. Jonathan Burbank, Captain Daniel Wycomb and Frances Wycomb testified that Margaret had come to Burbank's house, asking for corn from his field. (By this time, she had long been widowed.) Burbank initially asked her to wait until he retrieved it from his field, but when she persisted, his wife gave her some. Later, when he went to get some more corn out of the field, his oxen refused to move, which he attributed to Margaret's bewitching of them. Similarly, Thomas Nelson testified that Margaret repeatedly came to him for wood, for payment of a debt he owed to her. After he denied her, two of his cows died, which he <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>neighbors</b> considered unnatural, causing him to conclude Margaret was a witch.|$|E
500|$|King {{suffered}} from depression {{throughout much of}} his life. In his adolescent years, he initially felt resentment against whites due to the [...] "racial humiliation" [...] that he, his family, <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>neighbors</b> often had to endure in the segregated South. At the age of 12, shortly after his maternal grandmother died, King blamed himself and jumped out of a second-story window, but survived.|$|E

500|$|Arnold and {{his father}} had already become {{proficient}} in the Narragansett and Wampanoag languages, and both harbored an intense dislike of Gorton. They devised a scheme to undermine their adversary and to simultaneously obtain extensive lands from the local Indians. [...] Gorton had purchased Shawomet from Miantonomi, the chief sachem of the Narragansett people. [...] Minor sachems Ponham and Sacononoco had some control of the lands at Pawtuxet and Shawomet, and Arnold, acting as interpreter, took these chieftains to Governor Winthrop in Boston and had them submit themselves and their lands to Massachusetts, claiming that the sale of Shawomet to Gorton was done [...] "under duress." [...] Now with a claim to Shawomet, Massachusetts directed Gorton and his followers to appear in Boston to answer [...] "complaints" [...] made by the two minor sachems. [...] When Gorton refused, Massachusetts sent a party to Shawomet to arrest him <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>neighbors.</b> [...] The ensuing trial {{had nothing to do with}} the land claims, but instead focused on the writings and beliefs of Gorton, for which he and others in his group were imprisoned. [...] Ultimately, Gorton was released and went to England where he was given legal title to his lands from the Earl of Warwick and, in his honor, the settlement of Shawomet was renamed Warwick.|$|E
500|$|Kennel {{was born}} in 1925 to a Mennonite family who lived in Chassey-Beaupré. His father was a farmer and mayor of the city, and Kennel was {{expected}} to run the family farm when he was older. At age20, Kennel developed an interest in pastoral ministry and attended theological training at the Bible Institute of Nogent-sur-Marne in 1945–46, training that was later completed by studies at the European Mennonite Bible School in 1948–49. While still a farmer, he became a Mennonite missionary in the Meuse, Marne and Haute-Marne departments. In 1960, he discovered Pentecostalism through Roma missions, notably the Life and Light Evangelical Roma Mission (Mission Évangélique Tsigane [...] "Vie et Lumière"); he was attracted to this form of Christianity, since it emphasized missionary zeal and legitimized his ministry. He founded an evangelical group in his city, which caused conflict with his family, other religious leaders <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>neighbors.</b> In the early 1960s, Kennel became pastor of the church at Joinville; he conducted humanitarian activities on his farm, providing relief to homeless, former prisoners, drug addicts and alcoholics. In 1964, he also directed the church of Saint-Dizier; three years later, he decided to give up farming to fully devote himself to religious activities. In 1975 he was appointed treasurer of the Federation of Free Evangelical Pentecostals, and elected president seven years later. Under Kennel's leadership of the Pentecostal Church of Besançon, the church quickly opened many places of worship in Northern and Eastern France; Kennel trained pastors among his converts (including his son Étienne, who was ordained in 1981), {{and sent them to}} direct the new assemblies. In 1989 Kennel legally registered the Evangelical Missionary Federation, whose purpose was to federate all the churches (then composed of over thirty pastors).|$|E
2500|$|Lady in the Water is a 2006 American dark fantasy film {{written and}} {{directed}} by M. Night Shyamalan and starring Paul Giamatti and Bryce Dallas Howard. The film's plot concerns the superintendent of a Philadelphia apartment complex who discovers a young woman in the swimming pool. Gradually, he <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>neighbors</b> learn that she is a water nymph (or Narf) whose life is in danger from a vicious, wolf-like, mystical creature called a Scrunt that tries to keep her from returning to her watery [...] "blue world".|$|E

2500|$|In 1879, Munch {{enrolled}} in a technical college to study engineering, where he excelled in physics, chemistry and math. He learned scaled and perspective drawing, but frequent illnesses interrupted his studies. The following year, much to his father's disappointment, Munch left the college determined to become a painter. His father viewed art as an [...] "unholy trade", <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>neighbors</b> reacted bitterly and sent him anonymous letters. In contrast to his father's rabid pietism, Munch adopted an undogmatic stance toward art. He wrote his goal in his diary: [...] "in my art I attempt to explain life and its meaning to myself." ...|$|E
2500|$|On May 5, 1866, much of Pah-Ute county, {{including}} {{the area around}} Gass' Las Vegas Ranch was moved to Lincoln County, Nevada by the U.S. Congress. [...] Gass initially {{refused to accept the}} change and declined to pay Nevada taxes. [...] He <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>neighbors</b> petitioned the Nevada legislature to create Las Vegas county from the southern section of Lincoln County, but their request was ignored. [...] Gass also joined with other Arizona politicians to twice complain to Congress about the boundary change. [...] The boundary change became finalized in January 1867 when the Nevada Legislature unanimously accepted the new border.|$|E
2500|$|Johnson {{appeared}} in a [...] "Just For Men" [...] commercial where he had a grey beard <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>neighbors</b> told him [...] "Your beard is weird." [...] Johnson also {{appeared in}} a Right Guard commercial where he fired dodgeballs at Kyle Brandt, who represented odor. Johnson also appeared in several commercials for Nike in 1998. The spots comedically portrayed him taking batting practice (swinging ineptly at balls from a pitching machine) in his hope that he would break Roger Maris' then-single-season record for home runs. He made a cameo appearance in a commercial for MLB 2K9 with teammate Tim Lincecum. Johnson made an appearance in a GEICO insurance commercial.|$|E

2500|$|By 1861 William, not Catherine, {{agreed to}} the {{conditions}} of sale, {{but he was still}} negotiating a reduction in price for his lots until 1871. [...] He felt he should get the reduction that had been previously offered to his wife <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>neighbors</b> of $3.00 an acre. [...] Catherine died on Sept 26th 1865 before these negotiations were finalized. [...] In the end he paid $5.00 an acre. [...] Finally, he received the deeds for Lots 32 and 33. [...] By then he was living on Lot 33, along with Catherine’s mother Mary KaKaKe and her children, Martha and Moses, whom he'd been taking care of since Mary’s husband disappeared. [...] He was also supporting his own younger children and his grandchildren by his daughter, Sophia Staves, who had died in 1875. [...] William Sutton had a lot on his plate financially.|$|E
2500|$|Baum's wife {{frequently}} {{visited her}} niece, Dorothy Louise Gage. The infant became gravely sick and died on November 11, 1898, from [...] "congestion of the brain" [...] at exactly five months. When the baby, whom Maud adored as the daughter she never had, died, she was devastated {{and needed to}} consume medicine. To assuage her distress, Frank made his protagonist of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz a female named Dorothy. Uncle Henry was modeled after Henry Gage, his wife Maud's father. Bossed around by his wife Matilda, Henry rarely dissented with her. He flourished in business, though, <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>neighbors</b> looked up to him. Likewise, Uncle Henry was a [...] "passive but hard-working man" [...] who [...] "looked stern and solemn, and rarely spoke". The witches in the novel were influenced by witch-hunting research gathered by Baum's mother-in-law, Matilda. The stories of barbarous acts against accused witches scared Baum. Two key events in the novel involve wicked witches who both meet their death through metaphorical means.|$|E
2500|$|In 1887 Peirce {{spent part}} of his {{inheritance}} from his parents to buy [...] of rural land near Milford, Pennsylvania, which never yielded an economic return. There he had an 1854 farmhouse remodeled to his design. The Peirces named the property [...] "Arisbe". There they lived with few interruptions {{for the rest of}} their lives, Charles writing prolifically, much of it unpublished to this day (see Works). Living beyond their means soon led to grave financial and legal difficulties. He spent much of his last two decades unable to afford heat in winter and subsisting on old bread donated by the local baker. Unable to afford new stationery, he wrote on the verso side of old manuscripts. An outstanding warrant for assault and unpaid debts led to his being a fugitive in New York City for a while. Several people, including his brother James Mills Peirce <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>neighbors,</b> relatives of Gifford Pinchot, settled his debts and paid his property taxes and mortgage.|$|E
