Changing the surface interaction strength {{as well as the}} period of the external field, we obtain a non-equilibrium surface phase diagram that in parts strongly resembles the corresponding equilibrium phase diagram, with <b>an</b> ordinary <b>transition,</b> <b>an</b> extraordinary <b>transition</b> and <b>a</b> surface <b>transition.</b> These three lines meet at <b>a</b> special <b>transition</b> point. For weak surface couplings, however, the surface does not order. These results are found to remain qualitatively unchanged when using different single-spin flip dynamics.
