5|$|Feidlimid's Munstermen ravaged {{the length}} <b>and</b> <b>breadth</b> <b>of</b> Ireland, {{as far north}} as the Cenél nEógain heartland of Inishowen. Drawing on the support of the clergy of Cashel as well as his own {{military}} might, Feidlimid is said by Munster sources to have made himself King of Tara. Although he was defeated in 841 in battle with Niall Caille of the Cenél nEógain, the High King according to some, Feidlimid's achievements were exceptional. Not since Congal Cáech of the Dál nAraidi, King of Ulaid in the early 7th century, had any king but an Uí Néill one been reckoned King of Tara in any account.|$|E

For some textured surfaces, such as facial hair and woodgrain, he used a broad brush with bristles as sparse as a comb.

Woodlea has 140 rooms, which were designed not to be drafty, and with important rooms not too remote.

5|$|The radar {{technology}} was not flawless. It struggled to gauge heights of incoming formations above 25,000 feet {{and could not}} measure their numerical strength. It could also take several minutes to assess the line of advance for aircraft on a zigzag course. Moreover, the radar looked out to sea {{and was unable to}} track aircraft overland. That was the job of the Royal Observer Corps. Tens of thousands of volunteers, the length <b>and</b> <b>breadth</b> <b>of</b> Britain tracked the German formations over land. They were connected to Sector airfields by landline and could communicate intelligence in real time.|$|E
5|$|The Rockefeller Foundation {{offered an}} {{extension}} of Bethe's fellowship, allowing {{him to return to}} Italy in 1932. In the meantime, Bethe worked for Sommerfeld in Munich as a privatdozent. Since Bethe was fluent in English, Sommerfeld had Bethe supervise all his English-speaking postdoctoral fellows, including Lloyd P. Smith from Cornell University. Bethe accepted a request from Karl Scheel to write an article for the Handbuch der Physik on the quantum mechanics of hydrogen and helium. Reviewing the article decades later, Robert Bacher and Victor Weisskopf noted that it was unusual in the depth <b>and</b> <b>breadth</b> <b>of</b> its treatment of the subject, yet required very little updating for the 1959 edition. Bethe was then asked by Sommerfeld to help him with the handbuch article on electrons in metals. The article covered the basis of what is now called solid state physics. Bethe took a very new field and provided a clear, coherent and complete coverage of it. His work on the handbuch articles occupied {{most of his time in}} Rome, but he also co-wrote a paper with Fermi on another new field, quantum electrodynamics, describing the relativistic interactions of charged particles.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Evolution at {{a protein}} site can be {{characterized}} from two different perspectives, by its rate <b>and</b> by the <b>breadth</b> <b>of</b> the set of acceptable amino acids. Results There is a weak positive correlation between rates <b>and</b> <b>breadths</b> <b>of</b> evolution, both across individual amino acid sites and across proteins. Conclusions Rate <b>and</b> <b>breadth</b> are two distinct, and only weakly correlated, characteristics of protein evolution. The most likely explanation of their positive correlation is heterogeneity of selective constraint, such that less functionally important sites evolve faster and can accept more amino acids.
