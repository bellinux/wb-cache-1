5|$|In 1972, Annigoni {{completed}} a circular {{drawing of the}} Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh facing each other <b>against</b> <b>a</b> <b>background</b> <b>of</b> Windsor Castle to mark their silver wedding anniversary. The drawing was commissioned by the Library of Imperial History to be etched on commemorative silver and gold plates. Annigoni based the drawing on earlier sketches he had {{completed a}}nd the most recent official portraits which were sent to him.|$|E
5|$|On every anniversary, in New York City, {{the names}} of the victims who died there are read out <b>against</b> <b>a</b> <b>background</b> <b>of</b> somber music. The President of the United States attends a {{memorial}} service at the Pentagon, and asks Americans to observe Patriot Day with a moment of silence. Smaller services are held in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, which are usually attended by the President's spouse.|$|E
5|$|A film studio set {{was created}} by photographing several reel spools with strips of film {{dangling}} <b>against</b> <b>a</b> <b>background</b> <b>of</b> blinking lights. The casting office {{was created by}} silhouetting strips of cardboard against a white background. To portray the mental anguish of the protagonist, strips of paper were cut {{into the shape of}} twisted trees, which were silhouetted <b>against</b> <b>a</b> <b>background</b> <b>of</b> moving shadows and set in motion with an electric fan. To create a scene {{near the end of the}} film, when the protagonist starts becoming delirious, the camera moves through a maze of different sized cubes, with geometric designs inside them, all placed on a flat, shiny service. The heaven setting was also a miniature set created from paper cubes, tin cans, cigar boxes, toy trains, and a motorized Erector Set. No still photos were taken for the film, but illustrations showing prism and kaleidoscope effects have been made by enlarging frames of negative. The paper prints were considerably softer than the movie print in order to avoid graininess. The final film was edited to a one-reel length of 1,200 feet of film strip, featuring about 150 scenes. Florey said it featured the same number of angles as full-length feature films of the time. Although the film was carefully edited to be synchronized with Rhapsody in Blue, much of the original lyrical quality has been lost in shortened and modified versions of the film.|$|E

5|$|Evaluating Mountfort's works today, one has {{to avoid}} judging them <b>against</b> <b>a</b> <b>background</b> <b>of</b> similar designs in Europe. In the 1860s, New Zealand was a {{developing}} country, where materials and resources freely available in Europe were conspicuous by their absence. When available they were often of inferior quality, as Mountfort discovered with the unseasoned wood in his first disastrous project. His first buildings in his new homeland were often too tall, or steeply pitched, failing {{to take account of}} the non-European climate and landscape. However, he soon adapted, and developed his skill in working with crude and unrefined materials.|$|E
5|$|To detect {{extraterrestrial}} civilizations {{with radio}} telescopes, one must identify an artificial, coherent signal <b>against</b> <b>a</b> <b>background</b> <b>of</b> various natural phenomena that also produce radio waves. Telescopes capable of this include the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico and the newer Allen Telescope Array in Hat Creek, California. Various programs to detect extraterrestrial intelligence have had government funding in the past. Project Cyclops {{was commissioned by}} NASA in the 1970s to investigate {{the most effective way}} to search for signals from intelligent extraterrestrial sources, but the report's recommendations were set aside in favor of the much more modest approach of Messaging to Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence (METI), the sending of messages that intelligent extraterrestrial beings might intercept. NASA then drastically reduced funding for SETI programs, which have since turned to private donations to continue their search.|$|E
5|$|In 1942, Negus was President of the Section of Laryngology at the Royal Society of Medicine. When Negus {{had been}} {{training}} as a surgeon, laryngology, rhinology and otology {{had been part of}} general surgery, but this was changing with the advent of ENT (ear, nose and throat) medicine as a combined and specialised discipline. Negus and colleagues attempted to set up the necessary structure within the Royal Society of Medicine to represent their profession as an emerging speciality, but the regulations in place would not allow the type of organisation they had planned. This led them, in 1943, to found the British Association of Otorhinolaryngologists which would be able to represent ENT surgeons through the Royal College of Surgeons. Following the war, Negus was co-opted to the Council of the Royal College of Surgeons in 1947, and was the first to represent otolaryngology at that level. He was {{also a member of the}} college's Court of Examiners, and worked to set up the first examination in otorhinolaryngology that could be taken for the FRCS diploma. This reorganisation was taking place <b>against</b> <b>a</b> <b>background</b> <b>of</b> immense change in how medicine was practised in the UK, due to the advent of the National Health Service (NHS). Negus's colleague, Geoffrey Bateman, writing in 1974, credits him with having the foresight to represent the interests of otolaryngology and see it established as a major speciality in its own right within the NHS.|$|E

Throughout 2015 events to mark that occasion took place, including a prestigious match against Premiership Norwich City F.C. on 14 July.|$|E
25|$|The {{end of the}} Severan dynasty {{marked the}} {{breakdown}} of central imperium. <b>Against</b> <b>a</b> <b>background</b> <b>of</b> economic hyperinflation and latterly, endemic plague, rival provincial claimants fought for supremacy and failing this, {{set up their own}} provincial Empires. Most Emperors seldom even saw Rome, and had only notional relationships with their senates. In the absence of coordinated Imperial military response, foreign peoples seized the opportunity for invasion and plunder.|$|E
