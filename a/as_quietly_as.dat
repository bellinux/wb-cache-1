25|$|The {{importance}} of the New Madrid Bend rose dramatically when Fort Henry and then Fort Donelson fell to Union forces in early February 1862. Columbus was cut off from rest of the Confederate Army, and faced capture by Union troops advancing overland from the Tennessee River to the Mississippi. To avoid losing the garrison and its equipment, General Beauregard ordered that the position be abandoned <b>as</b> <b>quietly</b> <b>as</b> possible. The process began on February 24, when the first members of the Columbus garrison arrived at Island No. 10. Two days later, its new commander, Brig. Gen. John P. McCown, arrived, and immediately set to work to strengthen the position from Battery No. 1 to Point Pleasant.|$|E

While initially serving as the first major Confederate bastion on the Mississippi River, Columbus became untendable when Fort Henry and then Fort Donelson fell to Union forces in early February 1862. Columbus was cut off from rest of the Confederate Army, and faced capture by Union troops advancing overland from the Tennessee River to the Mississippi.

By the middle of March, five batteries containing 24 guns had been built on the shore above the island; 19 guns were in five batteries on the island itself; and the floating battery New Orleans, with nine guns, was moored at the west end of the island. McCown was eventually replaced in command at the island by Brig. Gen. William W. Mackall.|$|E

500|$|Accounts {{at the end}} of the 20th century {{focused on}} the effects of Smart's confinement. Clement Hawes, {{following}} Michel Foucault's interpretation of the 18th century that there was an animality' of madness", believed that Smart emotionally connected with animals because of the [...] "medical stigmatization" [...] he felt at the hands of his fellow man. Chris Mounsey, agreeing with Hawes's interpretation, believed that Smart's treatment was [...] "a bestializing process and had taught him to hold his tongue and sit out his time <b>as</b> <b>quietly</b> <b>as</b> possible." [...] Contrary to the bestialisation, Allan Ingram argued that Jubilate Agno was [...] "a poetic phenomenon that would have demolished contemporary poetic orthodoxies had it been publishable. The mad individual presented a gross distortion of the human form that nevertheless insisted on remaining human, but mad language could be even more disturbing." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Vietnam War {{provided}} the next significant {{test for the}} Air National Guard. However, for largely domestic political reasons, President Lyndon B. Johnson chose not to mobilize most of the nation's reserve forces before 1968. [...] His reasons for not mobilizing reserve forces were many. Primarily, {{he did not believe}} that the war in Vietnam justified the dramatic act of mobilizing Reserve and National Guard forces. [...] He accepted the need to fight the war, but he wanted to prosecute it <b>as</b> <b>quietly</b> <b>as</b> possible, not attracting too much attention at home and risk jeopardizing his domestic programs. He also wanted to avoid drawing the Communist Chinese into the war or the attention of the Soviet Union, the latter which might view the mobilization of Reserve and National Guard units as [...] "escalatory" [...] within a larger Cold War context. [...] Moreover, recalling Reservists' complaints of inactivity following the Berlin mobilization of 1961, he was also reluctant to recall Reservists and National Guardsmen without the assurance that their employment would significantly affect the course of the war, an assurance no official in his administration could provide. [...] As a result, even though still populated by many World War II and Korean War combat veterans, the Reserves and the National Guard acquired ill-deserved reputations during this period as havens for relatively affluent, young white men with no prior active duty military service to serve as officers or enlisted personnel as a means to avoid the draft into the active duty U.S. Army in an enlisted status.|$|E
