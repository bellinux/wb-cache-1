The <b>Atlantic</b> <b>sharpnose</b> <b>shark,</b> Rhizoprionodon terraenovae, and the blacktip shark, Carcharhinus limbatus, were the most common species captured with either longlines or gillnets. An additional 14 shark species were captured, and juvenile indices of abundance were developed for 8 species with gillnets and 6 species of sharks with longlines. Trends in catch-per-unit-effort were found to vary depending on species. Length-frequency information revealed {{that the majority of}} sharks captured were juveniles.

40|$|Gill {{nets and}} longlines were {{compared}} as shark nursery sampling methodologies in inshore waters of Georgia to (1) assess differences in gear selectivity, bias, and stress of capture and (2) determine potential relationships between habitat features and shark distribution and abundance. Gear selectivity varied between gears {{as a function}} of both species and life stage resulting in significantly different estimates of species and life stage compositions. Juvenile bonnetheads (Sphyrna tiburo) and young of the year blacktip sharks (Carcharhinus limbatus) experienced significantly higher stress from gill net capture than longline. Major sources of bias are thought to result from dietary preferences and individual size. Juvenile sandbar shark (C. plumbeus) distribution revealed a potential preference for creeks rather than sounds, between 0. 32 - 0. 8 km wide and 4. 02 - 8. 05 km from the ocean. Adult <b>Atlantic</b> <b>sharpnose</b> <b>sharks</b> (Rhizoprionodon terraenovae) appear to prefer larger, open sound waters closer to the ocean.

Applying this concept, we evaluated the capture of elasmobranchs {{in the presence of}} permanent magnets in hook-and-line and inshore longline fishing experiments. Hooks with neodymium-iron-boron magnets significantly reduced the capture of elasmobranchs overall in comparison with control and procedural control hooks in the hook-and-line experiment. Catches of <b>Atlantic</b> <b>sharpnose</b> <b>shark</b> (Rhizoprionodon terraenovae) and smooth dogfish (Mustelus canis) were signif icantly reduced with magnetic hook-and-line treatments, whereas catches of spiny dogfish (Squalus acanthias) and clearnose skate (Raja eglanteria) were not. Longline hooks with barium-ferrite magnets significantly reduced total elasmobranch capture when compared with control hooks. In the longline study, capture of blacktip sharks (Carcharhinus limbatus) and southern stingrays (Dasyatis americana) was reduced on magnetic hooks, whereas capture of sandbar shark (Carcharhinus plumbeus) was not affected. Teleosts, such as red drum (Sciaenops ocellatus), Atlantic croaker (Micropogonias undulatus), oyster toadfish (Opsanus tau), black sea bass (Centropristis striata), and the bluefish (Pomatomas saltatrix), showed no hook preference in either hook-and-line or longline studies.

Rhizoprionodon terraenovae reached a maximum size of 828 mm precaudal length (PCL) and a maximum age of 11 + years. Mean back-calculated lengths-at-age ranged from 445 mm PCL at age one to 785 mm PCL at age ten for females, and 448 mm PCL at age one to 747 mm PCL at age nine for males.

40|$|The hearing {{abilities}} of elasmobranch fishes {{were examined in}} response to several types of stimuli using auditory evoked potentials (AEP). Audiograms were acquired for the nurse shark, Ginglymostoma cirratum, the yellow stingray, Urobatis jamaicensis, in a controlled environment using a monopole underwater speaker. A dipole stimulus {{was used to measure}} the hearing thresholds of the horn shark, Heterodontus francisi, and the white-spotted bamboo shark, Chiloscyllium plagiosum. The dipole experiments yielded much lower thresholds than any other experiment, suggesting that this type of sound specifically stimulated the macula neglecta by creating a strong velocity flow above the head of the shark. A shaker table was created to measure the directional hearing thresholds of the C. plagiosum and the brown-banded bamboo shark, C. punctatum. This experiment showed that these sharks could sense accelerations equally in all directions suggesting that they have omnidirectional ears. The results also yielded higher thresholds than with the dipole, suggesting that the macula neglecta was not stimulated as the sharks were being accelerated. An audiogram was also acquired for the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>sharpnose</b> <b>shark,</b> Rhizoprionodon terraenovae, using a monopole speaker in the field. This experiment revealed that the hearing thresholds {{did not appear to be}} masked by ambient noise levels, and resulting thresholds yielded the lowest levels detected by any elasmobranch using AEPs.

40|$|Identification of {{the spatial}} scale at which marine {{communities}} are organized {{is critical to}} proper management, yet this is particularly difficult to determine for highly migratory species like sharks. We used shark catch data collected during 2006 – 09 from fishery-independent bottom-longline surveys, as well as biotic and abiotic explanatory data to identify the factors that affect the distribution of coastal sharks at 2 spatial scales in the northern Gulf of Mexico. Centered principal component analyses (PCAs) were used to visualize the patterns that characterize shark distributions at small (Alabama and Mississippi coast) and large (northern Gulf of Mexico) spatial scales. Environmental data on temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen (DO), depth, fish and crustacean biomass, and chlorophyll-a (chl-a) concentration were analyzed with normed PCAs at both spatial scales. The relationships between values of shark catch per unit of effort (CPUE) and environmental factors were then analyzed at each scale with co-inertia analysis (COIA). Results from COIA indicated {{that the degree of}} agreement between the structure of the environmental and shark data sets was relatively higher at the small spatial scale than at the large one. CPUE of Blacktip Shark (Carcharhinus limbatus) was related positively with crustacean biomass at both spatial scales.

40|$|Sharks are {{considered}} top predators in many marine ecosystems, and {{can play an}} important role in structuring those communities. As a result, it is necessary to understand the factors that influence their abundance and distribution. This is particularly important as fishery managers develop fishery management plans for sharks that identify areas that serve as essential fish habitat (EFH). This includes nursery habitat where sharks are born and juveniles spend the early part of their life. However, our understanding of shark habitat use in the northeast Florida waters is limited. The goal of this thesis was to characterize the abundance and distribution of sharks in northeast Florida estuaries, and to examine the effect of abiotic and biotic factors affecting shark habitat use. A bottom longline survey conducted from 2009 – 2011 indicated that 11 shark species use the estuarine waters of northeast Florida during summer months. Atlantic sharpnose (Rhizoprionodon terraenovae), blacktip (Carcharhinus limbatus), bonnethead (Sphyrna tiburo), and sandbar sharks (Carcharhinus plumbeus) were the most abundant species and made up 87. 1 % of the total catch. Month, bottom water temperature, and depth were the most important factors determining the presence and abundance of these species. This study also examined the role of prey abundance in determining the abundance of Atlantic sharpnose sharks. The probability of catching an <b>Atlantic</b> <b>sharpnose</b> <b>shark,</b> and the abundance of Atlantic sharpnose sharks, were most influenced by site. Neither potential prey abundance nor preferred prey abundance were not significant factors effecting Atlantic sharpnose abundance. This may be a result of prey sampling not providing an accurate measure of the true availability of prey resources. Other factors, such as predation risk, may better explain habitat use patterns of Atlantic sharpnose sharks. Continued sampling will give a better understanding of the factors influencing shark habitat use in this area...|$|E

Brain Hg levels were correlated with muscle Hg levels, but were significantly lower and did not exceed most known thresholds for neurological effects, suggesting limited potential for such responses. Data on known biomarkers of Hg-induced neurological effects support this premise, because they were not correlated with brain Hg levels. Organic methylmercury did not compose of a high percentage of the total mercury in the brain, indicating demethylation of Hg is occurring in the brain.

In most situations, the two-parameter von Bertalanffy model provided the least accuracy in parameter recovery, while the Schnute model was the most accurate individual model in most situations. The AIC MMI approach improved estimation accuracy over most individual models, except at very low sample sizes. These simulation results suggest that sample sizes of 200 are required to consistently achieve good accuracy for growth parameters, and that sampling gear selectivity has clear effects on which growth models fit best to the data.
