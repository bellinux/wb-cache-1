40|$|The idea of {{this paper}} is to {{implement}} the automated external allocation system using knowledge of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Java programming language. We are developing this project to reduce the work load of Universities. The scope of the work {{of this paper is}} to develop an automatic system which assists Universities in allocating the External examiner to colleges. The system will provide online registration facility for colleges <b>and</b> <b>externals.</b> This proposed system will also be able to trace location of colleges <b>and</b> <b>external’s</b> home location <b>and</b> will also have an automatic mailing facility. Graphical User Interface (GUI) for the system will be developed using Java (net Beans 7. 0 IDE). The tasks handled by GUI are to store details on information of <b>externals</b> <b>and</b> colleges...|$|R

5|$|Both {{internal}} <b>and</b> <b>external</b> signals {{can lead}} to the induction of apoptosis, or programmed cell death. The resulting deconstruction of cellular components is primarily carried out by specialized proteases known as caspases, but the proteasome also plays important and diverse roles in the apoptotic process. The involvement of the proteasome in this process is indicated by both the increase in protein ubiquitination, and of E1, E2, and E3 enzymes that is observed well in advance of apoptosis. During apoptosis, proteasomes localized to the nucleus have also been observed to translocate to outer membrane blebs characteristic of apoptosis.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Internals <b>and</b> <b>externals</b> {{with differing}} {{self-esteem}} dispositions were administered {{a series of}} personality tests and subsequently provided with bogus reports by a clinical psychologist containing either positive or negative information about their personalities. Consistent with self-esteem theory, more low than high self-esteem internals showed willingness to undertake remedial behavior to solve their problems, while {{there were no differences}} in the behavior of high <b>and</b> low self-esteem <b>externals</b> under the same circumstances. A study by Phares, Ritchie, and Davis (1968) was conducted to assess the reactions of internals <b>and</b> <b>externals</b> to positive <b>and</b> negative informa-tion about their personalities. Internals are people who believe that! reinforcing events are contingent upon their own actions, while externals, are individuals who believe that their reinforcers are determined by out-side forces such as chance, fate, or powerful others.

5|$|Despite the police-backed intervention, the {{university}} continued on strike. The appointed institute heads failed {{to break the}} stalemate between internal <b>and</b> <b>external</b> forces, and by early 1982, discussions begun on a new list of candidates to the rectorship. Eventually, José Aristodemo Pinotti, a former dean of the School of Medical Sciences generally considered a moderate, was selected by the academic community and accepted by the governor. In the following week, on April 19, 1982, the intervention was lifted, and academic activities resumed normally.|$|E
5|$|Fibropapillomatosis disease {{caused by}} a form of the herpes-type virus threatens loggerheads with {{internal}} <b>and</b> <b>external</b> tumors. These tumors disrupt essential behaviors and, if on the eyes, cause permanent blindness. Trematodes of the family Spirorchiidae inhabit tissues throughout {{the body of the}} loggerhead, including vital organs, such as the heart and the brain. Trematode infection can be highly debilitating. For example, inflammatory trematode lesions can cause endocarditis and neurological disease. A nematode, Angiostoma carettae, also infects loggerheads, causing histologic lesions in the respiratory tract.|$|E

With the peso quickly losing value to inflation, the new Argentine peso argentino was introduced in 1983, with 10,000 old pesos exchanged for each new peso.|$|E
