The project derives from a previous study (Borghetti and Malavasi, 2016) which illustrated the problems regarding the vulnerability of a railway stretch with particular reference to accessibility in emergency conditions; a method for evaluating accessibility was proposed, with reference to a specific territorial situation. This work will examine in detail the analytic structure of the individual indicators {{that make up the}} model. An <b>Accessibility</b> <b>Index</b> was determined for each railway link i of homogeneous length, starting from an evaluation of the territorial and contextual characteristics in which the line is positioned. The analysis procedure consists firstly of identifying those parameters that compete in implementation of the <b>Accessibility</b> <b>Index,</b> and secondly in aggregating the Indicator parameters which, through the use of relatively important weights, are part of Index determination. The model is based on a comparative approach that places the <b>Accessibility</b> <b>Index</b> in relation to the links that make up a railway stretch, therefore identifying the priorities and a hierarchy of the management and/or infrastructural interventions carried out to improve accessibility should important events occur...|$|E

Aim: To assess geographic accessibility using a parameter that integrates information about the use ofpreventive services and travelling time froin home to the health center. Material and methods: We analyzed target geographical áreas of 10 community centers located at the Northeast of México. A survey was conducted to collect information about the utilization of preventive services for detection of diabetes and hypertension within last year and in women, detection of cervical and breast cáncer. The time required to travel between the health center and the farthest location point at every neighborhood of each geographic área, using public or private transportation, was calculated. Health service use and transportation time were condensed in a single parameter, called geographic <b>accessibility</b> <b>index.</b> Data was normalized using z scores.

40|$|Accessibility {{measures}} make {{it possible}} to investigate the relationship between location and health, well-being, service utilisation, and service provision. With no standard metropolitan accessibility measure available across Australia, this presentation examines the development, potential applications, and research opportunities possible with the Metropolitan Accessibility/Remoteness Index of Australia (Metro ARIA). Metro ARIA is a composite spatial index that reflects the ease or difficulty people face accessing basic services within a metropolitan context. Its methodology, originally developed in 2002, was based on the widely used Accessibility/Remoteness Index of Australia Plus (ARIA+) methodology. Metro ARIA has been adapted from ARIA+ to be more sensitive for quantifying accessibility within metropolitan Australia, and has recently been constructed for all Australian capital cities. Calculation of Metro ARIA is derived from the measurement of road distances from land parcels within Australia’s eight capital cities to services locations belonging to five service themes: (1) Education; (2) Health; (3) Shopping; (4) Public Transport; and (5) Financial/Postal Services. In addition to the final composite <b>index,</b> <b>accessibility</b> classifications (ranging from high to low) for each of the five service themes can be used for standalone analysis. The resulting six <b>accessibility</b> <b>indices</b> have been aligned to Statistical Area 1 census units for easy integration with Australian census datasets to inform current research and stimulate new research opportunities. As one of 1, 000 + datasets currently available to urban researchers through the Australian Urban Research Infrastructure Network (AURIN), access to the Metro ARIA <b>accessibility</b> <b>indices</b> (via the AURIN portal) will also be discussed.

With regard to this, we calculated the accessibility indicator by a zonal opportunity gravity model (employed person) for 38 local government areas (zones) with GIS tools, and, in addition, the changes in accessibility measured during 1991 – 2001.

In the present study, the accessibility gap of Hong Kong in 1991 is compared with that in 1996 to examine whether transport development has been more sustainable.

We investigate inequality in access with <b>accessibility</b> <b>indices</b> that combine rich information on the capacity of specialist health care and the distance from residence to the hospital and private specialist care. We investigate inequity in the use of specialist health care with data from the 2008 Survey of Living Conditions linked with data on access to specialist health care (<b>accessibility</b> <b>indices).</b> We find inequality of access to specialist health care revealing that the capital Oslo has the best access to specialist health care and the residents of northern Norway (Finnmark county) has the worst access. Moreover, we find inequities in use of hospital inpatient stay with respect to ethnicity and education, in use of hospital outpatient visit with respect to education and access to private specialist and in use of private specialist visit with respect to education, household income and the access to private specialists. We find that the better access to private specialists is, the higher is the probability of visit to a private specialist. Regarding hospital outpatient we find that the better access to private specialists is, the lower is the probability of a visit to hospital outpatient clinic. This suggests that the use of a hospital outpatient visit is a possible substitute for private specialists.
