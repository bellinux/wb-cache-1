(1) Background: Health systems researchers are beginning to address nurses’ workload demands at different unit, job and task levels; {{and the types of}} administrative interventions needed for specific workload demands. (2) Methods: This was a cross-sectional correlational study of 472 acute care nurses from British Columbia, Canada. The workload factors included nurse reports of unit-level RN staffing levels and patient acuity and patient dependency; job-level nurse perceptions of heavy workloads, nursing tasks left undone and compromised standards; and task-level interruptions to work flow. Patient outcomes were nurse-reported frequencies of medication errors, patient falls and urinary tract infections; <b>and</b> <b>nurse</b> outcomes were emotional exhaustion and job satisfaction. (3) Results: Job-level perceptions of heavy workloads and task-level interruptions had significant direct effects on patient <b>and</b> <b>nurse</b> outcomes. Tasks left undone mediated the relationships between heavy workloads <b>and</b> <b>nurse</b> <b>and</b> patient outcomes; and between interruptions <b>and</b> <b>nurse</b> <b>and</b> patient outcomes.

40|$|What {{defines the}} quality of care?' {{is one of the}} key {{questions}} in health care <b>and</b> <b>nursing</b> sciences. This topic has been discussed in Germany for more than fifteen years and yet no theory based understanding of 'quality' in domestic care <b>and</b> <b>nursing</b> exists to date. Therefore, this work aims to develop theory driven indicators for care <b>and</b> <b>nursing.</b> The approach taken here consists of applying the paradigm of sustainability, originally developed by the social sciences, to the novel field of healthcare <b>and</b> <b>nursing.</b> The criteria 'active social life', 'self-determination', 'participation' and 'quality of life' are transferred onto domestic care <b>and</b> <b>nursing.</b> For example, the indicator 'availability of barrier-free living space# was used to operationalize the criterion 'active social life', while the indicator 'level of volunteer involvement' was employed to operationalize the criterion 'participation'. The degree to which individual indicators are applied in nowadays health care <b>and</b> <b>nursing</b> was determined based on an in depth literature analysis. In summary, this work clearly indicates which areas of care <b>and</b> <b>nursing</b> validate further study and development: For instance, it is imperative to further develop advice and information services, to speedily implement the 'empowerment concept' and to increase the involvement of voluntary care givers...|$|R

40|$|ENGLISH ABSTRACT Title: The {{perceptions}} of <b>nurses</b> <b>and</b> certified <b>nursing</b> assistants on care-related prevention concerning people with dementia: a mixed methods approach. Background: Because {{of the growing}} number of people with dementia, care-related prevention activities done by <b>nurses</b> <b>and</b> certified <b>nursing</b> assistants will become increasingly important to prevent complications and maintain an acceptable quality of life. Currently it’s unknown what the {{perceptions of}} <b>nurses</b> <b>and</b> certified <b>nursing</b> assistants towards care-related prevention in dementia care are. Aim: To gain insight into the perceptions of <b>nurses</b> <b>and</b> certified <b>nursing</b> assistants towards care-related prevention so care-related prevention for people with dementia can be further improved in the future. Research question: How do <b>nurses</b> <b>and</b> certified <b>nursing</b> assistants working in home care, residential or nursing homes perceive care-related prevention concerning people with dementia? Method: A mixed methods approach with survey research and individual semi-structured interviews. First, secondary analyses were done on existing survey data collected in 2011 on a sample of 206 <b>nurses</b> <b>and</b> certified <b>nursing</b> assistants. Second, in March-May 2014 12 individual semi-structured interviews were conducted to embellish the quantitative results. Results: From this study three concepts related to the perceptions of <b>nurses</b> <b>and</b> CNAs towards care-related prevention activities emerged: attitude, knowledge and skills <b>and</b> the future. <b>Nurses</b> <b>and</b> certified <b>nursing</b> assistants think care-related prevention is a task of their profession. They experience insufficient knowledge and skills and they like to devote more time to care-related prevention in the future. Conclusion: <b>Nurses</b> <b>and</b> certified <b>nursing</b> assistants perceive care-related prevention to be part of their profession. They however express the need for more education on care-related prevention, preferably in a classroom setting. In the future, <b>nurses</b> <b>and</b> certified <b>nursing</b> assistants like to devote more time to care-related prevention and e-health can support this. Recommendations: Additional training of <b>nurses</b> <b>and</b> certified <b>nursing</b> assistants focused on their different needs and use of e-health...|$|R

5|$|Initially, it was rumoured that, {{following}} the armistice, all French {{troops would be}} soon returned by the Germans. From the autumn of 1940, the Germans began to repatriate French reservists whose private occupations were in short supply in Vichy France, such as medical workers like doctors <b>and</b> <b>nurses</b> along with postmen and gendarmes. In 1941, after lobbying by the Vichy government, the policy was extended to French veterans of World War I and fathers of four or more children. Individual prisoners with good contacts could also be requested for repatriation. In practice, this meant that {{a disproportionate number of}} prisoners who were released early came from the upper classes.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: This study {{aimed to}} examine {{levels of stress}} <b>and</b> professionalism of <b>nurses</b> who {{provided}} nursing care during the 2015 Middle East respiratory syndrome outbreak based on their experience, to investigate the nurses' intention to respond to possible future outbreaks {{in relation to their}} experience during the outbreak, and to determine the relationship between the outbreak experience <b>and</b> <b>nursing</b> intention considering stress and professionalism. Methods: A self-administered questionnaire was designed based on modifications of related questionnaires, and used to assess levels of stress, professionalism, <b>and</b> <b>nursing</b> intention according to participants' experiences during the outbreak. Multiple regression analysis was used {{to examine the relationship between}} the outbreak <b>nursing</b> experience <b>and</b> <b>nursing</b> intention considering stress <b>and</b> <b>nursing</b> professionalism. Results: The overall stress, professionalism, <b>and</b> <b>nursing</b> intention scores for the firsthand experience group were 33. 72, 103. 00, and 16. 92, respectively, whereas those of the secondhand experience group were 32. 25, 98. 99, and 15. 60, respectively. There were significant differences in professionalism <b>and</b> <b>nursing</b> intention scores between the groups (p = . 001 and p < . 001, respectively). The regression analysis revealed that the regression estimate between stress <b>and</b> <b>nursing</b> intention was B(SE) = − 0. 08 (0. 02), beta = − 0. 21, p <. 001 and the regression estimate between professionalism in <b>nursing</b> <b>and</b> <b>nursing</b> intention was B(SE) = 0. 05 (0. 01), beta = 0. 23, p <. 001. Conclusion: Prior outbreak nursing experience was importantly associated with intention to provide care for patients with a newly emerging infectious disease in the future considering stress and professionalism.
