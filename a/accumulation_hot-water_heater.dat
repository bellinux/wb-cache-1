40|$|Abstract. This study {{developed}} the pre-heating device which heats the water {{by using the}} exhaust gases from gas-operated <b>hot-water</b> <b>heater.</b> Thus the temperature of water is raised at an exit of the pre-heating device. The pre-heated water is then transport to the gas-operated <b>hot-water</b> <b>heater</b> to increase the water temperature which is used for showers. Thus, the thermal performance is enhanced with the pre-heating device. The overall performance of the absorption heater system is analyzed by finite element analysis. The different types of pre-heating devices are simulated for the thermal performance. Other important considerations for producing the pre-heating devices are the bending-tube technology and manufacturing cost. The appropriated design of pre-heating device is selected for producing. Thus the performance and testing of pre-heating devices will be carried out...|$|R
50|$|Finet {{unexpectedly}} {{resigned as}} mayor on April 16, 1987, {{to accept a}} position with Hydro-Québec as executive vice-president for Quebec sales. He explained that he always planned {{to return to the}} company at some point, and that the job offer was a unique opportunity. Some criticized him for leaving politics so soon after his re-election. Finet launched an energy reduction campaign in April 1991, highlighted by a call for Hydro-Québec users to use energy-saving light bulbs, shower heads, and <b>hot-water</b> <b>heaters.</b>|$|R

They {{know how to put}} in a <b>hot-water</b> <b>heater.</b> If their house needs to be painted, they'll go to Lowe's to buy a gallon of paint and they'll paint it. They don't have book sense, but they know how to fix up their house. And it's amazing -- you go to them and they fix them up and they're so proud and they own a home." ...|$|R
50|$|Affected {{residential}} devices {{will vary}} by region, but may include residential electric <b>hot-water</b> <b>heaters,</b> air conditioners, pool pumps, or crop-irrigation pumps. In a distribution network outfitted with load control, these devices are outfitted with communicating controllers that {{can run a}} program that limits the duty cycle of the equipment under control. Consumers are usually rewarded for participating in the load control program by paying a reduced rate for energy. Proper load management by the utility allows them to practice load shedding to avoid rolling blackouts and reduce costs.|$|R
5000|$|Zombies of the Stratosphere reuses the [...] "Republic Robot" [...] (somewhat {{resembling}} a walking silvery <b>hot-water</b> <b>heater</b> with two ribbed arms that terminate in pincers), along with stock footage {{of it in}} action (such as the Bank Robbery by Robot scene from Mysterious Doctor Satan) and black-and-white footage from a Republic full color Roy Rogers film. The serial is also heavily padded with footage from their King of the Rocket Men (1949), to which this is a pseudo-sequel. Although the Zombies serial has Martians as the villains, {{they are not the}} same Martians as shown in the earlier Republic serial The Purple Monster Strikes. [...] The Robot was first seen in Undersea Kingdom (1936) and prominently featured in Mysterious Doctor Satan (1940).|$|R
40|$|Thermal {{performance}} {{measurements were}} made of a commercial solar <b>hot-water</b> <b>heater</b> in a solar simulator. The objective of the test was to determine basic performance characteristics of a traditional type of flat-plate collector, with and without side reflectors (to increase the solar flux). Due {{to the fact that}} collector testing in the solar simulator permits control of the variables that affect collector performance, it was possible to obtain information on each of the following: (1) the effect of flow and incidence angle on the efficiency of a flat-plate collector (but only without side reflectors), (2) transient performance under flow and nonflow conditions, (3) the effectiveness of reflectors in increasing collector efficiency for a zero radiation angle at fluid temperatures required for solar air conditioning, and (4) the limits of applicability of a collector efficiency correlation based on the Hottel-Whillier equation (1958) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{analysis}} of water quality, regarding {{the content of}} metals, especially heavy and radioactive ones, {{has been carried out}} in an indirect way, by testing scale formed in a <b>hot-water</b> <b>heater,</b> using water from the water-supply network of the city of Belgrade Ã¢Â€Â“ the district of New Belgrade. The determination of the composition and the structure of the scale has resulted in its complete identification, and its crystallochemical formula has been defined. It has unequivocally been established that the obtained results are within the tolerance boundary with the results acquired by a conventional {{analysis of}} water, when {{it is a matter of}} very low concentrations. The presence of radioactive elements of uranium and strontium in a scale sample has been found and the way of their penetrating its composition and structure has been explained. Applying the fractional extraction method, uranium has been established to be of an anthropogenic origin...|$|R
40|$|Water was cultured from 39 of 48 {{hospitals}} (7 Halifax {{hospitals and}} 32 non-Halifax hospitals) {{in the province}} of Nova Scotia and from 90 residences (74 private dwellings, 16 apartments) in Halifax to determine the frequency of legionella contamination. Six of seven Halifax hospitals had Legionellaceae isolated from their potable water compared with 3 of 32 non-Halifax hospitals (P or = 50 beds) hospitals with total system recirculation. These hospitals also had water with a higher pH and calcium content but lower sodium, potassium, nitrate, iron and copper content. Fourteen of the 225 (6. 2 %) water samples from Halifax residences were positive for legionellae - 8 % (6 / 74) of the single family dwellings were positive, compared with 25 % (4 / 16) apartments. The positivity rate of 15. 7 % for the 19 electric <b>hot-water</b> <b>heaters</b> in Halifax homes was not significantly different from the 32 % positivity for Halifax hospitals. L. longbeachae accounted for 2 of the 14 isolates of legionellae from Halifax homes...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the economic efficiency of alternative renewable energy technologies in raising the technical efficiency of energy consumption in Botswana, in reducing {{its dependence on}} imported energy resources, and in generating domestic income. It builds on feasibility studies of the US AID-financed Botswana Renewable Energy Technology project, and provides estimates of the financial and economic net present values of a sample of energy conserving technologies. The technologies covered are: artisan-produced domestic stoves, retained heat cookers, and small-batch solar <b>hot-water</b> <b>heaters.</b> Each has been selected for its potential to reduce fuelwood consumption, a primary source of household energy resources. In purely financial terms, the stoves {{appear to be the}} most economical, followed by the retained heat stoves. The small batch solar hot water heaters do not hold promise under current relative prices. In all cases, the financial analysis has been complicated by the absence of accurate measures of fuelwood prices, and for which we have considered the use of shadow price alternatives to substantiate these findings. For Botswana, factor technology substitution is thus sensitive to the prevailing price of fuelwood common property resources. - 3 -I...|$|R
50|$|In 1938, Nash {{introduced}} an optional conditioned air heating/ventilating system, {{an outcome of}} the expertise shared between Kelvinator and Nash. This was the first <b>hot-water</b> car <b>heater</b> to draw fresh air from outside the car, and {{is the basis of}} all modern car heaters in use today. Also in 1938, Nash, along with other car manufacturers Studebaker and Graham, offered vacuum-controlled shifting, an early approach at removing the gearshift from the front floorboards. Automobiles equipped with the Automatic Vacuum Shift (supplied by the Evans Products Company) had a small gear selector lever mounted on the dashboard, immediately below the radio controls.|$|R
