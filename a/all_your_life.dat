25|$|Because in Catholicism {{you are a}} born sinner and you're {{a sinner}} <b>all</b> <b>your</b> <b>life.</b> No matter how {{you try to get}} away from it, the sin is within you all the time. It was this fear that haunted me; it taunted and pained me every moment. My music was {{probably}} the only distraction I had.|$|E
25|$|You have no {{idea what}} sending on those checks to me at this time. After {{fighting}} for an idea <b>all</b> <b>your</b> <b>life</b> I realize that your backing has saved it for me and meant to thank you with all my heart and soul for what you have done. It has been marvelous. So many letters have been written and not mailed and owing to having been in bed {{a great deal of time}} this summer, the paintings were about all I could muster up enough energy to do what I considered the best of my ability. Just before Stieglitz’s death I took some paintings to him that I considered as having something new in the. He immediately walked right up to them and spoke of the new ideas. His intuition in that way was remarkable and I am so glad to have been allowed to live during his and your lifetimes. It has been a great privilege for which I am truly thankful.|$|E

500|$|... "Love Like This" [...] {{is a song}} {{performed}} by British singer Natasha Bedingfield. It was included on Bedingfield's second North American album, Pocketful of Sunshine, and features vocals from reggae singer Sean Kingston. The song was written by Bedingfield, Kingston, Louis Biancaniello, Rico Love, Ryan Tedder, Sam Watters, and Wayne Wilkins, while production was handled by Biancaniello, Love, Tedder, and Watters under their production group, The Runawayz. Its lyrics discuss finding love with {{a person who has}} [...] "been there <b>all</b> <b>your</b> <b>life</b> and has always loved you, but you've never noticed it until now". The official remix features vocals from rapper Lil Wayne and a slightly different beat, produced by Jim Jonsin.|$|E
500|$|When Madonna {{started work}} on her fourth studio album, Like a Prayer, she was already in an {{emotional}} state of mind, following her divorce with then-husband Sean Penn, her thirtieth birthday, and unfavorable reviews for her acting endeavors. She had certain personal matters on her mind that she thought could be the musical direction of the album. But she understood that as she was growing up, so was her core audience. Feeling the need to try something different, Madonna wanted {{the sound of her}} new album to indicate what could be popular in music. However, being raised as a Catholic, Madonna felt guilty about the failure of her marriage. She said, [...] "Because in Catholicism you are a born sinner and you are a sinner <b>all</b> <b>your</b> <b>life.</b> ... I could not escape my past, nor could I relax". Saddened by what was happening with her, Madonna missed her family, her father and her siblings. She confessed to Becky Johnston for Interview magazine: ...|$|E
500|$|The lyrical meaning behind [...] "Give It Away" [...] is {{centered}} on the philosophy of selflessness and altruistic behavior. The song is titled after its most prevalent lyrical phrase [...] "give it away", which is taken from an experience Kiedis had with his former girlfriend—punk rock singer Nina Hagen—in the early 1980s. Hagen was several years Kiedis' senior and became a role-model during his drug addiction to heroin: [...] "she realized how young and inexperienced I was then, so she was always passing on gems to me, not in a preachy way, just by seizing on opportunities." [...] When Kiedis was looking through her closet he came across a jacket he liked, and commented to Hagen that it was [...] "really cool". Upon expressing this, Hagen immediately told him to keep it. Her reasoning behind this selflessness was due to an attempt to constantly make her life more enjoyable, and explained to Kiedis that [...] "if you have a closet full of clothes {{and you try to}} keep them <b>all,</b> <b>your</b> <b>life</b> will get very small. But if you have a full closet and someone sees something they like, if you give it to them, the world is a better place." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Confess, then," [...] {{she went}} on, [...] "confess, Mr. Walmsley, that in <b>all</b> <b>your</b> well-ordered <b>life</b> {{you have never}} heard such an {{admission}} made by two apparently respectable people before." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have heard}} your story, Myeerah, {{and it is}} wonderful. You must tell me <b>all</b> about <b>your</b> <b>life</b> with the Indians. You speak my {{language}} almost as well as I do. Who taught you?" ...|$|R

2500|$|Bukowski often {{spoke of}} Los Angeles as his {{favorite}} subject. In a 1974 interview he said, [...] "You {{live in a}} town <b>all</b> <b>your</b> <b>life,</b> {{and you get to}} know every bitch on the street corner and half of them you have already messed around with. You've got the layout of the whole land. You have a picture of where you are.... Since I was raised in L.A., I've always had the geographical and spiritual feeling of being here. I've had time to learn this city. I can't see any other place than L.A." ...|$|E

2500|$|When {{she left}} Sandusky, Mona’s mother advised her, “You’ve known the church <b>all</b> <b>your</b> <b>life.</b> [...] There {{are a lot}} of devils in the world, but the ones you’ll find in church are more likely nicer than what’s on the street.” [...] Mona took her mother’s advice and quickly joined a church in Chicago where she sang in the church choir {{directed}} by Hilda Robinson, the mother of double bassist and photographer Milt Hinton. [...] Milt and Mona first met on the Southside of Chicago at Milt’s grandmother’s funeral in 1939, and they were inseparable for the next sixty-one years.|$|E
2500|$|In January 1993, the International Year of the World's Indigenous People, Jones {{described}} {{the choice of}} Aboriginal Australian Mandawuy Yunupingu as Australian of the Year as [...] "ridiculous" [...] and suggested Yunupingu had been granted the award because of his [...] "colour or...history". Later that year, prominent Aboriginal Australian Charles Perkins and Jones clashed in a live TV and radio debate. Jones said Australians are [...] "getting no say when [...] say this is [...] nation; it's not, it's Australia's nation... {{are being asked to}} pay taxes to fund people who are seeking title to productive land to which they've made no contribution to its productivity". Perkins called Jones racist and a redneck and commented [...] "You've sat on your white bum at 2UE in Sydney <b>all</b> <b>your</b> <b>life</b> so you wouldn't know what goes on out there".|$|E
2500|$|The band {{originally}} {{played together}} under the name [...] "Charity" [...] in 1972 with Jesus People Milwaukee, based in Milwaukee. [...] When the community split into four groups, one became the [...] "Jesus People USA Traveling Team", working primarily in Florida. [...] Before their relocation to Chicago, the name [...] "Resurrection Band" [...] was chosen and the band became a primary focus of the community's ministry. [...] After arriving in Chicago, the band recorded two independent cassettes that were given away after their concerts. [...] These were performed anywhere Resurrection Band was allowed to play, from schools to prisons to street corners. [...] The first cassette, Music to Raise the Dead, featured hard rock, while <b>All</b> <b>Your</b> <b>Life</b> comprised only their acoustic numbers. [...] These were {{a reflection of the}} folk-oriented sets they would play at more conservative venues such as nursing homes and churches. [...] The churches were deeply sceptical of Christian rock, especially the borderline heavy metal that Resurrection Band specialized in.|$|E

Aziel, you have sinned indeed, and must bear the {{appointed}} punishment of your sin. Yet hear a message of mercy spoken through my lips: Because you have sinned through love and pity, your offence is not unto death. Still shall you sorrow for it <b>all</b> <b>your</b> <b>life's</b> days, and in desolation of heart and bitterness of soul shall creep back to the feet of Him you have forsworn.|$|R
5000|$|Of one of {{the early}} attacks he wrote: Once again I am beset by this strong feeling of discord... the feel of battle, the will to victory, the hatred towards one who wishes to take from you what is most {{precious}} of <b>all</b> - <b>your</b> <b>life.</b> These first victories have been too easy.|$|R
2500|$|W. B. Yeats and Arthur Symons {{described}} Nietzsche as {{the intellectual}} heir to William Blake. Symons {{went on to}} compare {{the ideas of the}} two thinkers in The Symbolist Movement in Literature, while Yeats tried to raise awareness of Nietzsche in Ireland. A similar notion was espoused by W. H. Auden who wrote of Nietzsche in his New Year Letter (released in 1941 in The Double Man): [...] "O masterly debunker of our liberal fallacies [...] <b>all</b> <b>your</b> <b>life</b> you stormed, like your English forerunner Blake". Nietzsche made an impact on composers during the 1890s. Writer on music Donald Mitchell notes that Gustav Mahler was [...] "attracted to the poetic fire of Zarathustra, but repelled by the intellectual core of its writings." [...] He also quotes Mahler himself, and adds that he was influenced by Nietzsche's conception and affirmative approach to nature, which Mahler presented in his Third Symphony using Zarathustra's roundelay. Frederick Delius produced a piece of choral music, A Mass of Life, based on a text of Thus Spoke Zarathustra, while Richard Strauss (who also based his Also sprach Zarathustra on the same book), was only interested in finishing [...] "another chapter of symphonic autobiography". Famous writers and poets influenced by Nietzsche include André Gide, August Strindberg, Robinson Jeffers, Pío Baroja, D. H. Lawrence, Edith Södergran and Yukio Mishima.|$|E

6000|$|Olfan {{was about}} to answer when Soa, fearing lest Juanna's {{pleading}} should prevail against his passion, broke in saying, [...] "Be not fooled, King, by a woman's pretty speeches, or by her idle threats that she will kill herself. She will not kill herself, I know her well, she loves her life too much; and soon, when you are wed, she will love you also, {{for it is the}} nature of us women to worship those who master us. Moreover, that man, the Deliverer, is not her husband, except in name; for months I have lived with them and I know it.
