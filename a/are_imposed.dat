5|$|As their landscapes {{have similar}} scenic qualities, AONBs may be {{compared}} to the national parks of England and Wales. AONBs are created under the same legislation as the national parks, the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949. In contrast to national parks, which have their own authorities and legal power to prevent unsympathetic development, very few statutory duties <b>are</b> <b>imposed</b> on the local authorities within an AONB. However, further regulation and protection of AONBs was added by the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000.|$|E

40|$|A {{large and}} growing {{literature}} has demonstrated that imposing control on agents {{has the potential to}} backfire, leading agents to withhold effort. Consistent with principles of procedural fairness, we find that the way in which control <b>is</b> <b>imposed</b> — in particular whether control <b>is</b> <b>imposed</b> symmetrically on both principals and agents and whether both parties have a say in whether control <b>is</b> <b>imposed</b> — affects how agents respond to control. In our setting, control leads agents to withhold effort only when control <b>is</b> <b>imposed</b> unilaterally with an asymmetric affect on the agent...|$|R

Mid and late winter can become severely dry in Florida. In some years {{the dry season}} becomes quite severe and water restrictions <b>are</b> <b>imposed</b> to conserve water. While most areas of Florida do not experience any type of frozen precipitation, north Florida can see fleeting snow or sleet a few times each decade.|$|E
5|$|To {{summarize}} {{and conclude}} upon this point: Section 3 of the Recovery Act (15 USCA 703) is without precedent. It supplies no standards for any trade, industry, or activity. It does not undertake to prescribe {{rules of conduct}} {{to be applied to}} particular states of fact determined by appropriate administrative procedure. Instead of prescribing rules of conduct, it authorizes the making of codes to prescribe them. For that legislative undertaking, section 3 sets up no standards, aside from the statement of the general aims of rehabilitation, correction, and expansion described in section 1. In view of the scope of that broad declaration and {{of the nature of the}} few restrictions that <b>are</b> <b>imposed,</b> the discretion of the President in approving or prescribing codes, and thus enacting laws for the government of trade and industry throughout the country, is virtually unfettered. We think that the code-making authority thus conferred is an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power.|$|E

50|$|The United States social {{insurance}} system {{is funded by}} a tax similar to an income tax. Social Security tax of 6.2% <b>is</b> <b>imposed</b> on wages paid to employees.

Thus, property taxes tend to <b>be</b> <b>imposed</b> on property owners.

Thus, partners are taxed on the income of their partnership.|$|R
