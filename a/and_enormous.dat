5|$|A second full telling (even {{shorter than}} the summary of Hesiod) is in a Roman-era {{collection}} of myths; the account of Orion is based largely on the mythologist and poet Pherecydes of Leros. Here Orion is described as earthborn <b>and</b> <b>enormous</b> in stature. This version also mentions Poseidon and Euryale as his parents. It adds a first marriage to Side before his marriage to Merope. All that is known about Side is that Hera threw her into Hades for rivalling her in beauty. It also gives a different version of Orion's death than the Iliad: Eos, the Dawn, {{fell in love with}} Orion and took him to Delos where Artemis killed him.|$|E
5|$|Other {{groups also}} {{underwent}} major radiations. Based on molecular sequencing and fossil dating, Neoaves appeared to radiate after the K–Pg boundary. They even produced giant, flightless forms, {{such as the}} herbivorous Gastornis and Dromornithidae, and the predatory Phorusrhacidae. The extinction of Cretaceous lizards and snakes {{may have led to}} the radiation of modern groups such as iguanas, monitor lizards, and boas. On land, giant boid <b>and</b> <b>enormous</b> madtsoiid snakes appeared, and in the seas, giant sea snakes radiated. Teleost fish diversified explosively, filling the niches left vacant by the extinction. Groups appearing in the Paleocene and Eocene include billfish, tunas, eels, and flatfish. Major changes are also seen in Paleogene insect communities. Many groups of ants were present in the Cretaceous, but in the Eocene ants became dominant and diverse, with larger colonies. Butterflies diversified as well, perhaps {{to take the place of}} leaf-eating insects wiped out by the extinction. The advanced mound-building termites, Termitidae, also appear to have risen in importance.|$|E

25|$|The {{years from}} 1410-1466 were a {{particularly}} troubled and violent time for Louviers. The only construction {{that occurred in}} the early fifteenth century was the addition of the “Challenge Tower” to the church of Notre-Dame de Louviers. Named after a military captain, construction began in 1414. The tower design was influenced by defensive architecture. It features massive walls <b>and</b> <b>enormous</b> sloping buttresses to thwart attackers. The Lovériens told the English {{it was to be a}} bell tower, which it later became and remains so today. Its massive construction dominates the west façade of the church.|$|E

25|$|However, {{the time}} <b>and</b> <b>enormous</b> effort Rogers {{expended}} {{on the project}} continued to undermine his already declining health, {{not only because of}} his Herculean work but also because of the uncertain economy of the period, exacerbated by the financial Panic of 1907 which began in March of that year. To obtain the needed financing, he was forced to pour many of his own assets into the railroad. Management of the funding Rogers was providing was handled by Boston financier Godfrey M. Hyams, with whom he had also worked on the Anaconda Company, and many other natural resource projects.|$|E

25|$|After {{compiling}} {{information from}} many intelligence sources, primarily from spies along the Silk Road, Genghis Khan carefully prepared his army, which was organized differently from his earlier campaigns. The changes {{had come in}} adding supporting units to his dreaded cavalry, both heavy and light. While still relying on the traditional advantages of his mobile nomadic cavalry, Genghis incorporated many aspects of warfare from China, particularly in siege warfare. His baggage train included such siege equipment as battering rams, gunpowder, <b>and</b> <b>enormous</b> siege bows capable of throwing 20-foot arrows into siege works. Also, the Mongol intelligence network was formidable. The Mongols never invaded an opponent whose military and economic will and ability to resist had not been thoroughly and completely scouted. For instance, Subutai and Batu Khan spent a year scouting central Europe, before destroying the armies of Hungary and Poland in two separate battles, two days apart.|$|E
25|$|The overall {{internal}} {{situation of}} Bulgaria following the two Balkan Wars remained greatly strained. The acquisition of around 18,000km2 of new land with its over 400,000 inhabitants failed {{to compensate for}} the loss of Southern Dobrudja, one of the country's most fertile regions; the approximately 176,000 casualties; <b>and</b> <b>enormous</b> financial costs. Agriculture, which was the leading sector of the economy, was badly affected and could no longer rely on Southern Dobrudja's annual grain harvest of up to 150,000 tonnes. The number of available horses, sheep and cattle was also lower when compared with 1912. Annual meat production was about 105,629 tonnes when the amount needed to sustain an army of 600,000 for a year was estimated at 87,600 tonnes. External trade and the public finances in this period were also characterized by a widening negative imbalance. It was reckoned that in case of war the country could not afford to feed, clothe and replace the manpower losses of an army greater than half a million men without severely undermining the economy.|$|E
25|$|Into this, 135 Squadron were thrust {{with few}} aircraft, spares <b>and</b> <b>enormous</b> {{logistics}} challenges. Carey {{set up the}} airfield at Zayatkwin and flew his first combat with No. 136 Squadron RAF on 26 January 1942 because his own did not possess any Hurricanes. The newer Hurricane Mk IIAs, equipped with twelve machine guns, offered an improvement in striking power to the previous variants. On 28 January 135 moved to RAF airfield at Mingaladon Township and the following day engaged in combat with the enemy for the first time. During the air battle Carey claimed a Nakajima Ki-27 from the 77th Sentai (77th Fighter Unit) over Mingaladon. The battle took place in 6/10th cumulus at approximately 5,000ft. Major Hirose led {{the attack on the}} Hurricanes, supported by a number of P-40 Kittyhawks from an American unit. Carey shot down Sergeant Nagashima with his first burst of fire. Two P-40s were lost and one pilot wounded. They claimed 12 enemy aircraft while the RAF pilots claimed two. The 77th Sentai lost four Ki-27s—Warrant Officer Yoshida, Sergeant Kanda and Kojima failed to return with Nagashima.|$|E

25|$|Capt. Robert G. Coman {{reported}} as Lafayettes prospective commanding officer on 31 January 1942, overseeing a skeleton engineering force numbering 458 men. The complicated nature <b>and</b> <b>enormous</b> {{size of the}} conversion effort prevented Coman's crew from adhering to the original schedule; crew familiarization with the vessel was an issue, and additional crew members were arriving to assist the effort. On 6 February 1942, {{a request for a}} two-week delay for the first sailing of Lafayette, originally scheduled for 14 February, was submitted to the Assistant Chief of Naval Operations. On that day, a schedule extension was granted due to a design plan change: elements of the superstructure were to be removed to improve stability, in work that was expected to take another 60 to 90 days. However, on 7 February, orders came from Washington that the reduction of the top-hamper had been abandoned and Lafayette was to sail on 14 February as planned. This abrupt reversal necessitated a frantic resumption of conversion work, and Capts Coman and Simmers scheduled 9 February meetings in New York and Washington to lobby for further clarification of conversion plans; ultimately, these meetings would never take place.|$|E
25|$|After {{sitting out}} the next Pride to recuperate, Sakuraba found himself across the ring from Quinton Jackson, a former collegiate wrestler who had {{compiled}} a record of 10–1 on the American circuit. At {{the sound of the}} bell, Sakuraba immediately took the bigger man to the canvas with a low single-leg takedown. However, Jackson's superior size <b>and</b> <b>enormous</b> physical strength allowed him to muscle out of Sakuraba's submission attempts. After locking his legs around Jackson for a triangle choke, Sakuraba found himself hefted into the air and repeatedly slammed to the canvas {{in the way of a}} powerbomb. Later, he attempted an armbar against Jackson, only for the Tennessee native to again lift him up and this time attempt to drop him from the ring. His expression unchanging through the course of Jackson's assault, Sakuraba continued to flow from one lock to another. Eventually, he took the back of an exhausted Jackson and submitted him with his first rear naked choke victory. The contest was a launchpad for Jackson's career, leading to a long-term contract with Pride where he eventually became regarded as a top middleweight competitor, and later, a UFC champion.|$|E
25|$|The European arrival tremendously {{damaged the}} Inuit way of life, causing mass death through new {{diseases}} introduced by whalers and explorers, <b>and</b> <b>enormous</b> social disruptions {{caused by the}} distorting effect of Europeans' material wealth. Nonetheless, Inuit society in the higher latitudes had largely remained in isolation during the 19th century. The Hudson's Bay Company opened trading posts such as Great Whale River (1820), today {{the site of the}} twin villages of Whapmagoostui and Kuujjuarapik, where whale products of the commercial whale hunt were processed and furs traded. The British Naval Expedition of 1821–3 led by Admiral William Edward Parry, which twice over-wintered in Foxe Basin, provided the first informed, sympathetic and well-documented account of the economic, social and religious life of the Inuit. Parry stayed in what is now Igloolik over the second winter. Parry's writings, with pen and ink illustrations of Inuit everyday life, and those of George Francis Lyon, both published in 1824 were widely read. Captain George Comer's Inuit wife Shoofly, known for her sewing skills and elegant attire, was influential in convincing him to acquire more sewing accessories and beads for trade with Inuit.|$|E
