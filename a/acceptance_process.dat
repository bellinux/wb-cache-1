In this process, unit tests are written first, by the software engineers (often with pair programming in the extreme programming methodology). The tests are expected to fail initially. As code is written, the tests pass incrementally larger portions of the test suites. The test suites are continuously updated as new failure conditions and corner cases are discovered, and they are integrated with any regression tests that are developed.

50|$|In conversation, {{in order}} to {{establish}} common ground and make referencing known concepts or objects easier, speakers work together to establish definite references. Unlike the literary model of definite reference, which takes into account only what the speaker does to create the definite reference; the conversational model has the speaker and the listener working together. The listener is interpreting {{at the same time as}} the speaker is talking, and the speaker may have to edit to rephrase what is being said based on how the listener reacts. Speaker A and speaker B must mutually accept the functionality and usefulness of A’s reference before they can allow the conversation to go on. The belief that both have accepted the reference is established through a two-part process: (a)presentation and (b)acceptance. Speaker A presents a reference (e.g. the dog with the pink collar) and Speaker B accepts it by responding with the affirmation that he understood which dog was discussed. If A realizes the presentation wasn’t definitive enough, he may edit his speech to be more specific (e.g. the dog with the pink collar, near the tree, by the parking lot over there). If B doesn’t accept the presentation (e.g. the dog with the what? that’s not a dog, that’s a weasel), then A has to reissue the reference. Completing the <b>acceptance</b> <b>process</b> may take several exchanges between the speakers.|$|E
40|$|In recent years, {{manufacturers}} of high precision mechanical parts {{have been required}} to produce increasingly complex designs, in smaller lot sizes, with improved quality. These requirements demand lower process costs, shorter development cycles and more accurate manufacturing technologies.

The technique of on-machine acceptance provides one mechanism for improving the part inspection and verification process. This approach allows one machine and one process capability model {{to be used for}} both fabrication and inspection, reducing capital cost and overall cycle time.

50|$|In {{the same}} paper, they {{proposed}} the Collaborative Model as an alternative. They believed this model was {{more able to}} explain the aforementioned features of conversation. They had conducted an experiment to support this theory and also to further determine how the <b>acceptance</b> <b>process</b> worked. The experiment consisted of two participants seated at tables separated by an opaque screen. On the tables {{in front of each}} participant were a series of Tangram figures arranged in different orders. One participant, called the director, was tasked with getting the other participant, called the matcher, to accurately match his configuration of figures through conversation alone. This process was to be repeated 5 additional times by the same individuals, playing the same roles. The collaborative model they proposed allowed them to make several predictions about what would happen. They predicted that it would require many more words to establish reference the first time, as the participants would need to use non-standard noun phrases which would make it difficult to determine which figures were being talked about. However, they hypothesized that later references to the same figures would take fewer words and a shorter amount of time, because by this point definite reference would have been mutually established, and also because the subjects would be able to rely on established standard noun phrases. The results of the study confirmed many of their beliefs, and outlined some of the processes of collaborative reference, including establishing the types of noun phrases used in presentation, and their frequency.|$|E

50|$|Acceptance and {{commitment}} therapy utilizes behavior change process, mindfulness and <b>acceptance</b> <b>process.</b> ACT, involves non-judgmental awareness and openness to cognitive sensation an emotional experiences. It also promotes exposure to previously avoided situations that have caused anxiety {{in order to}} promote acceptance. The avoidant behavior is treated by having clients observing their thoughts and accepting that their thoughts are not necessarily harmful. In general ACT strategies are customized to fit each participant so they obtain psycho-education, problem solving skills and psychological flexibility. Mindfulness and acceptance exercises skills facilitates the behavioral changes necessary for its user to pursue a life that they feel is vital and meaningful. Various sources have indicated that acceptance {{and commitment}} therapy overlaps with Neff's conceptualization of self compassion particularly the ACT's relational frame theory. The basic theories and concepts underlining ACT, may be relevant and have shown to be parallels and hold similarities found in self-compassion The first is ACT perspective and Neff's concept of self-kindness are both linked to self-acceptance. Acceptance of one's painful experiences and hurt is related to kindness to one's self. Second Neff's conceptualization of self-compassion and ACT both emphasize mindfulness, which is practiced ACT through the concepts of defusion, acceptance, contact with the present moment and the self as a context. Defusion is also used in self-compassion as a means of allowing self-criticisms to pass through the mind with believing, proving them wrong or engaging stance to make these thoughts workable. In a study conducted by Yadavaia, Hayes & Vilardaga, 2014 test the efficacy of an ACT approach to self-compassion as compared to a waitlist control, the study showed that ACT interventions led to a large increase in self-compassion and psychopathology compared to the waitlist control at post-treatment and two months post intervention.|$|E

Particular attention has been directed at (1) streamlining fragmented technology <b>acceptance</b> <b>processes</b> within and among the states, and (2) alleviating disincentives, created by inadequate or unverified technology cost and performance data, for users and regulators to choose innovative technologies. Market fragmentation currently imposes significant cost burdens on technology developers and inhibits the investment of private capital in environmental technology companies. Among the responses to these problems are state and federal technology certification/validation programs, efforts to standardize cost/performance data reporting, and initiatives aimed at promoting interstate cooperation in technology testing and evaluation.

40|$|AbstractThe {{utilization}} of established virtual communities {{as a source}} of profit has become crucial for virtual community service providers. Thus, the service providers should try to determine what types of users are present in their communities, that is, whether the use of the community is utilitarian or hedonic. They would then be able to ascertain what type of trust is to be facilitated. When the service providers understand the kind of trust they need to develop to induce members to use the site more often, they can manage their respective virtual communities more efficiently. In this context, this paper studies two types of trust in virtual communities to differentiate their <b>acceptance</b> <b>processes</b> for usage based on the Technology Acceptance Model. The different effects of trust and other variables are investigated based on customer type. The relationships among these factors are hypothesized.

40|$|Software Systems of Systems (SoS) are {{large-scale}} distributed component-based {{systems in}} which the individual components are elaborate and complex systems in their own right. Distinguishing characteristics are their short expected integration and deployment time, and the need to modify their architecture at runtime, while preserving the integrity of the system. Integration testing is a commonly used technique employed in the <b>acceptance</b> <b>processes</b> of software SoS. In this paper, we propose a scheme to test a complete SoS at every reconfiguration, re-exercising the test cases of every updated component. In practice, re-executing all the test cases, whenever a modification takes place in one of the components, would be very costly. This is the case, in particular, when the system has to keep running all the time. Our proposal, therefore, encompasses several methods to limit the amount of test cases to be executed. The basis of all these methods is to rely on as much information as possible extracted from previous runs of the test cases. We illustrate our findings with an example SoS coming from the maritime safety and security domain. Software Computer TechnologyElectrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Scienc...|$|R
