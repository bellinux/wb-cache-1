40|$|Oxidative damage, {{caused by}} {{reactive}} oxygen species during aerobic respiration, {{is thought to be}} an important mediator of life-history trade-offs. To mitigate oxidative damage, antioxidant defence mechanisms are deployed, often at the cost of resource <b>allocation</b> to other <b>body</b> functions. Both reduced resource <b>allocation</b> to <b>body</b> functions and direct oxidative damage may decrease individual fitness, through reducing survival and/or reproductive output. The oxidative costs of reproduction have gained much attention recently, but few studies have investigated the long-term consequences of oxidative damage on survival and (future) reproductive output under natural conditions. Using a wild population of the cooperatively breeding Seychelles warbler (Acrocephalus sechellensis), we tested the prediction that high levels of {{reactive oxygen species}}, or high antioxidant investments to avoid oxidative damage, have fitness consequences because they reduce survival and/or reproductive output. We found that individuals with higher circulating non-enzymatic antioxidant capacity had a lower probability of surviving until the next year. However, neither current reproductive output, nor future reproductive output in the surviving individuals, was associated with circulating non-enzymatic antioxidant capacity or oxidative damage. The negative relationship between antioxidant capacity and survival that we observed concurs with the findings of an extensive comparative study on birds, however the mechanisms underlying this association remain to be resolved.

40|$|In this thesis, {{transport}} infrastructure slot allocation has been studied, focusing on selection slot allocation, i. e. on longer-term slot allocation decisions determining the traffic patterns served by infrastructure bottlenecks, rather than timetable-related slot allocation problems. The allocation of infrastructure capacity among carriers {{is a major}} issue in various {{transport infrastructure}} sectors, and therefore a theoretical framework on slot allocation would be desirable to support rational decision-making on slot allocation. The current state-of-the-art of slot allocation research does not provide such a theoretical framework, and therefore a theoretical framework to analyze slot allocation problems has been developed in this thesis. The first step {{in the development of a}} theoretical framework to analyze slot allocation problems has been the specification of a conceptual framework, which includes the definition of key concepts such as capacity. Capacity has been defined as being dependent on conditions such as composition of traffic and traffic context as well as assumptions about the desired balance between capacity and quality-of-service. The next step was to review the current application of slot allocation in the railway and aviation sectors, and the potential application of slot allocation in the road and navigation sectors. Slot allocation is currently applied in the railway and aviation sectors, and slot allocation may potentially be applied in other sectors. This thesis introduces the important distinction between selection and scheduling slot allocation. In both the railway and aviation sectors, the tradition has been to integrate selection and scheduling slot allocation. This thesis, however, considers selection slot allocation as a separate slot allocation level. Separating selection and scheduling slot allocation enables the application to each level of different rules with respect to slot validity, valuation of alternative slot requests, etc. The desired characteristics of selection slot allocation have been formulated in this thesis by analyzing the main desires of carriers and other interested parties such as shippers and authorities. It has been concluded that selection slots should be valid for a significantly longer period than scheduling slots, and a semi-static slot allocation procedure has been proposed. Furthermore, the acceptability principle has been introduced as a basis to specify desired slot size. However, the specification of standard basic slots by the <b>allocation</b> <b>body</b> (at different levels to attain differentiation of slot size) is desirable. A semi-static slot allocation procedure implies that selection slot allocation decisions may be based on an explicit evaluation of selection slot requests. The selection problem may be analyzed using congestion theory, resulting in a generic specification of traffic supply and demand. The next step is to specify traffic supply in more detail by specifying capacity constraints. Examining various types of primary traffic processes, traffic service processes, and traffic externalities, capacity constraints have been formulated, which may be applied to different types of bottlenecks. Three categories of capacity constraints have been distinguished, i. e. homogeneous capacity constraints, linear capacity constraints, and non-linear capacity constraints. The next step is the specification of objectives. The (primary) objective of slot allocation may usually be specified as a linear objective function. Depending on the type and number of capacity constraints, various instances of selection slot allocation decision problems may be formulated. The corresponding optimization problems may be solved using an exact solution algorithm, but for various reasons this thesis proposes a greedy approximation instead. Besides a standard greedy algorithm for selection problems with a single type of capacity constraint, an extended greedy algorithm has been developed to solve problems with two or more different types of capacity constraints. The latter algorithm has been tested for a hypothetical case study. Three main conclusions have been formulated in this thesis. The first main conclusion is that selection and scheduling should be considered as separate slot allocation levels having a hierarchical relationship. Selection slot allocation is of primary importance and scheduling slot allocation is only of secondary importance, because selection decisions determine which traffic is facilitated and which is not. The second main conclusion is that the validity of slots is a compromise between stability and flexibility. To ensure a sufficient level of stability, a validity of at least 5 years seems reasonable for selection slots. To ensure a reasonable level of flexibility, infinite validity of selection slots (historic rights) is not desirable, and at least every timetable season the opportunity should be offered to reserve selection slots. The final main conclusion is that the objec-tives and constraints of the selection problem can be modeled as linear functions, and the resulting binary linear programming problem can best be solved with the greedy efficiency algorithm presented in this thesis. This efficiency algorithm does not provide an exact solution of the binary linear programming problem, but its results are more robust and are easier to interpret than exact solution approaches.

40|$|The {{condition}} {{dependence of}} sexually selected traits {{is an important}} assumption of sexual selection theory. Several laboratory studies have documented {{a positive relationship between}} food availability, body condition, and sexual display.

Further, the effect of condition-dependent signaling on female mate choice has hardly been investigated experimentally in the field. We therefore investigated the effect of food availability on body condition, calling behavior, and sexual attractiveness of male field crickets, Gryllus campestris, under field conditions. Food availability was manipulated for individual males by supplementing food in a confined area close to the burrow. Food-supplemented males showed a significant increase in body condition, whereas the opposite was found in the control males. Males receiving extra food called more frequently, whereas the calling-song characteristics were not affected by the treatment. Further, food-supplemented males attracted more females than did control males, and their higher attractiveness was partly explained by their superior calling rate.

Zoological Studies 50 (2) : 192 - 202. Life-history theory predicts that birds nesting at higher elevations will have lower reproductive output due to ecological constraints. Higher-elevation birds should allocate more energy into individual offspring through producing fewer and larger eggs {{to allow their}} offspring to better survive the harsh environments. To test the prediction, I collected reproductive data on 3 waterbirds, the Mallard Anas platyrhynchos, Common Moorhen Gallinula chlorpus and Eurasian Coot Fulica atra, at Lhalu Wetland (3650 m in elevation), the largest marshland with macrophytes on the Tibetan Plateau. These birds became regular nesters after prohibition of yak grazing and reed harvesting in the wetland since 2003. Mallards laid eggs from mid-Apr. to mid-June, moorhens from early May to mid-June, and coots from mid-May to late June. Clutch size and egg size of these high-elevation waterbirds were smaller or intermediate compared to those of their lowland counterparts, partially supporting the prediction.

40|$|Resource {{limitation}} {{during the}} juvenile stages frequently results in developmental delays and reduced size at maturity, and dietary restriction during adulthood can affect longevity and reproductive output. Variation in food intake can also result in alteration {{to the normal}} pattern of resource <b>allocation</b> among <b>body</b> parts or life-history stages. My primary aim {{in this study was}} to determine how varying juvenile and/or adult feeding regimes affect particular female and male traits in the sexually cannibalistic praying mantid Pseudomantis albofimbriata. Praying mantids are sit-and-wait predators whose resource intake can vary dramatically depending on environmental conditions within and across seasons, making them useful for studying the effects of feeding regime on various facets of reproductive fitness. In this study, there was a significant trend/difference in development and morphology for males and females as a result of juvenile feeding treatment, however, its effect on the fitness components measured for males was much greater than on those measured for females. Food-limited males were less likely to find a female during field enclosure experiments and smaller males were slower at finding a female in field-based experiments, providing some of the first empirical evidence of a large male size advantage for scrambling males. Only adult food limitation affected female fecundity, and the ability of a female to chemically attract males was also most notably affected by adult feeding regime (although juvenile food limitation did play a role).

40|$|Abstract Background Growing {{interest}} is turned to fat storage levels and <b>allocation</b> within <b>body</b> compartments, {{due to their}} impact on human health and quality properties of farm animals. Energy intake and genetic background are major determinants of fattening in most animals, including humans. Previous studies have evidenced that fat deposition depends upon balance between various metabolic pathways. Using divergent selection, we obtained rainbow trout with differences in fat allocation between visceral adipose tissue and muscle, and no change in overall body fat content. Transcriptome and proteome analysis were applied to characterize the molecular changes occurring between these two lines when fed a low or a high energy diet. We focused on the liver, center of intermediary metabolism and the main site for lipogenesis in fish, as in humans and most avian species. Results The proteome and transcriptome analyses provided concordant results. The main changes induced by the dietary treatment were observed in lipid metabolism. The level of transcripts and proteins involved in intracellular lipid transport, fatty acid biosynthesis and anti-oxidant metabolism were lower with the lipid rich diet. In addition, genes and proteins involved in amino-acid catabolism and proteolysis were also under expressed with this diet. The major changes related to the selection effect were observed in levels of transcripts and proteins involved in amino-acid catabolism and proteolysis that {{were higher in the}} fat muscle line than in the lean muscle line. Conclusion The present study led to the identification of novel genes and proteins that responded to long term feeding with a high energy/high fat diet. Although muscle was the direct target, the selection procedure applied significantly affected hepatic metabolism, particularly protein and amino acid derivative metabolism. Interestingly, the selection procedure and the dietary treatment used to increase muscle fat content exerted opposite effects on the expression of the liver genes and proteins, with little interaction between the two factors. Some of the molecules we identified could be used as markers to prevent excess muscle fat accumulation. </p...|$|R
40|$|Many organisms display {{phenotypic}} plasticity as adaptation to seasonal environmental fluctuations. Often, such seasonal responses entails plasticity {{of a whole}} suite of morphological and life-history traits that together contribute to the adaptive phenotypes in the alternative environments. While {{phenotypic plasticity}} in general is a well-studied phenomenon, {{little is known about}} the evolutionary fate of plastic responses if natural selection on plasticity is relaxed. Here, we study whether the presumed ancestral seasonal plasticity of the rainforest butterfly Bicyclus sanaos (Fabricius, 1793) is still retained despite the fact that this species inhabits an environmentally stable habitat. Being exposed to an atypical range of temperatures in the laboratory revealed hidden reaction norms for several traits, including wing pattern. In contrast, reproductive <b>body</b> <b>allocation</b> has lost the plastic response. In the savannah butterfly, B. anynana (Butler, 1879), these traits show strong developmental plasticity as an adaptation to the contrasting environments of its seasonal habitat and they are coordinated via a common developmental hormonal system.

40|$|In dynamic {{models of}} energy allocation, assimilated energy is {{allocated}} to reproduction, somatic growth, maintenance or storage, and the allocation pattern can change with age. The expected evolutionary outcome is an optimal allocation pattern, but this {{depends on the}} environment experienced during the evolutionary process and on the fitness costs and benefits incurred by allocating resources in different ways. Here we review existing treatments which encompass some of the possibilities as regards constant or variable environments and their predictability or unpredictability, {{and the ways in}} which production rates and mortality rates depend on body size and composition and age and on the pattern of energy allocation. The optimal policy is to allocate resources where selection pressures are highest, and simultaneous <b>allocation</b> to several <b>body</b> subsystems and reproduction can be optimal if these pressures are equal. This may explain balanced growth commonly observed during ontogeny. Growth ceases at maturity in many models; factors favouring growth after maturity include non-linear trade-offs, variable season length, and production and mortality rates both increasing (or decreasing) functions of body size. We cannot yet say whether these are sufficient to account for the many known cases of growth after maturity and not all reasonable models have yet been explored.

40|$|Although most of {{the genetic}} {{progress}} in production efficiency is achieved through selection at a global scale, locally, farm managers can also influence the selection process to better match genotypes and their varying herd environment. This study focused {{on the influence of}} a particular management decision-the use of extended lactation (EL) in dairy goat production systems- as it affects the survival and reproduction rates at the herd level, which may then shape different long-term selection responses. The objective was to understand and quantify the influences of EL and variability in achieved intake level on the responses to selection for production, reproduction, and longevity. An animal model of resource allocation between life functions was applied to the dairy goat. It predicts the trajectory of change in the herd genetic composition as affected by the feeding level and the selection pressure applied by the manager. During 40 yr, goats were selected for milk yield, reproduction, and, with a different selection weight for age (W-AGE), for longevity. Under varying achieved intake levels, increasing W-AGE improved the survival rate but a nonlinear effect was observed for the average milk yield and BCS. When moderately increasing W-AGE from 0, resources were reallocated from lactation towards body reserves and survival, which led to a trade-off at the herd level between improving survival and BCS and increasing milk yield. When further increasing W-AGE, old females became systematically preferred regardless of their reproductive status and the proportion of EL in the herd increased. Females undergoing EL had reduced energetic costs of reproduction, which improved their probability of survival. Across generations, an increased herd incidence of EL led to a relaxation of the selection pressure on the resource <b>allocation</b> to <b>body</b> reserves, which is normally imposed by the manager's priority to achieve successful reproduction at each mating. As selection for longevity progressed, the incidence of high-producing females increased within the herd, driving a long-term trend in increased milk production. Thus, the use of EL as a management tool led to an alleviation of the trade-off between milk yield progress and survival improvement. Although the model simplifies the underlying physiology of nutrient allocation, it provides insights into how farm manager strategies can influence the development of genotype x environment interactions and promote herd robustness...|$|R

We have monitored aggregate territory size, spore <b>allocation</b> and fruiting <b>body</b> morphology in chimaeric groups of (quasi-wild-type) Ax 2 and triA(-) cells. Developmental canalisation breaks down in chimaeras and leads {{to an increase in}} phenotypic variation. A minority of triA(-) cells causes largely Ax 2 aggregation streams to break up; the effect is not due to the counting factor. Most chimaeric fruiting bodies resemble those of Ax 2 or triA(-). Others are double-deckers with a single stalk and two spore masses, one each at the terminus and midway along the stalk. The relative number of spores belonging to the two genotypes depends both on the mixing ratio and on the fruiting body morphology. In double-deckers formed from 1 : 1 chimaeras, the upper spore mass has more Ax 2 spores, and the lower spore mass more triA(-) spores, than expected. Thus, the traits under study depend partly on the cells' own genotype and partly on the phenotypes, and so genotypes, of other cells: they are both autonomous and non-autonomous. These findings strengthen the parallels between multicellular development and behaviour in social groups. Besides that, they reinforce the point that a trait can be associated with a genotype only in a specified context...|$|R

This was an exploratory analysis of the International Breast Cancer Intervention Study II, a doubleblind randomized clinical trial in which women at increased risk of breast cancer were randomly assigned to receive anastrozole or placebo. This is the first report of risk factors for and characteristics of CTS in women taking an AI in a placebo-controlled trial. Results. Overall, 96 participants with CTS were observed: 65 (3. 4 %) in the anastrozole arm and 31 (1. 6 %) in the placebo arm (odds ratio, 2. 16 [1. 40 to 3. 33]; P <. 001).

Testes mass varied greatly among the seven species analyzed, ranging from 1. 6 ± 1. 1 mg in Timogenes dorbignyi to 16. 3 ± 4. 5 mg in Brachistosternus pentheri with an average of 8. 4 ± 5. 0 mg in all the species.

40|$|Summary 1. Agent-based models (ABMs) {{are widely}} used to predict how populations respond to {{changing}} environments. As the availability of food varies in space and time, individuals should have their own energy budgets, {{but there is no}} consensus as to how these should be modelled. Here, we use knowledge of physiological ecology to identify major issues confronting the modeller and to make recommendations about how energy budgets for use in ABMs should be constructed. 2. Our proposal is that modelled animals forage as necessary to supply their energy needs for maintenance, growth and reproduction. If there is sufficient energy intake, an animal allocates the energy obtained in the order: maintenance, growth, reproduction, energy storage, until its energy stores reach an optimal level. If there is a shortfall, the priorities for maintenance and growth/reproduction remain the same until reserves fall to a critical threshold below which all are allocated to maintenance. Rates of ingestion and <b>allocation</b> depend on <b>body</b> mass and temperature. We make suggestions for how each of these processes should be modelled mathematically. 3. Mortality rates vary with body mass and temperature according to known relationships, and these can be used to obtain estimates of background mortality rate. 4. If parameter values cannot be obtained directly, then values may provisionally be obtained by parameter borrowing, pattern-oriented modelling, artificial evolution or from allometric equations. 5. The development of ABMs incorporating individual energy budgets is essential for realistic modelling of populations affected by food availability. Such ABMs are already being used to guide conservation planning of nature reserves and shell fisheries, to assess environmental impacts of building proposals including wind farms and highways and to assess the effects on nontarget organisms of chemicals for the control of agricultural pests.

40|$|This work {{investigated}} {{individual and}} geographic variation in life history tradeoffs in tree swallows (Tachycineta bicolor) and European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) by examining how breeding females make tradeoffs between {{current and future}} reproduction. In tree swallows, timing of breeding is a strong predictor of reproductive success, with early laying birds tending to have higher fitness than do later laying birds. Experimental manipulation of offspring numbers in Ithaca, NY, revealed that later-laying females raising enlarged broods showed significantly decreased cell-mediated immune responses to phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) and humoral responses to sheep red blood cells (SRBC) relative to higher-quality females. Nestlings in enlarged broods grew at slightly slower rates, but otherwise nestlings {{did not differ in}} offspring quality among groups, suggesting tree swallows are willing to trade immune self-maintenance for offspring quality. The short-term stress of raising enlarged broods had long-term consequences. Females raising enlarged broods in year 1 mounted weaker secondary antibody responses to SRBC than did control females. Most importantly, females in year 2 that showed stronger secondary responses were more likely to return to breed for a third year. A brood manipulation experiment was conducted at the extremes of the tree swallow range: Alaska and Tennessee. In Alaska, breeding females raising enlarged broods increased feeding effort, decreased immune responses and raised offspring in similar quality to unmanipulated broods. However, in Tennessee, females raising enlarged broods did not increase feeding effort and, consequently, did not show decreased immune function and raised lower quality offspring. Tennessee females returned to breed at higher rates than did Alaska females and maintained higher cell-mediated responses than did Alaska females, suggesting different resource allocation patterns. To investigate offspring quality in more detail, a study was conducted to examine factors affecting nestling immune response in European starlings breeding in New Zealand. A split-nest cross-fostering brood manipulation revealed that nestling immune response was influenced by female genetic quality (in part through spleen size), maternal effects (in part through temperature conditions), and parental resource <b>allocation</b> (through residual <b>body</b> mass).

40|$|BACKGROUND The HealthValues Healthy Eating Programme is a {{standalone}} Internet-based {{intervention that}} employs a novel strategy for promoting behavior change (analyzing one's reasons for endorsing health values) alongside other psychological principles {{that have been}} shown to influence behavior. The program consists of phases targeting motivation (dietary feedback and advice, analyzing reasons for health values, thinking about health-related desires, and concerns), volition (implementation intentions with mental contrasting), and maintenance (reviewing tasks, weekly tips). OBJECTIVE The aim was {{to examine the effects of}} the program on consumption of fruit and vegetables, saturated fat, and added sugar over a 6 -month period. METHODS A total of 82 females and 18 males were recruited using both online and print advertisements in the local community. They were allocated to an intervention or control group using a stratified block randomization protocol. The program was designed such that participants logged onto a website every week for 24 weeks and completed health-related measures. Those allocated to the intervention group also completed the intervention tasks at these sessions. Additionally, all participants attended laboratory sessions at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months. During these sessions, participants completed a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ, the Block Fat/Sugar/Fruit/Vegetable Screener, adapted for the UK), and researchers (blind to group <b>allocation)</b> measured their <b>body</b> mass index (BMI), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), and heart rate variability (HRV). RESULTS Data were analyzed using a series of ANOVA models. Per protocol analysis (n= 92) showed a significant interaction for fruit and vegetable consumption (P=. 048); the intervention group increased their intake between baseline and 6 months (3. 7 to 4. 1 cups) relative to the control group (3. 6 to 3. 4 cups). Results also showed overall reductions in saturated fat intake (20. 2 to 15. 6 g, Ptextless. 001) and added sugar intake (44. 6 to 33. 9 g, Ptextless. 001) during this period, but there were no interactions with group. Similarly, there were overall reductions in BMI (27. 7 to 27. 3 kg/m(2), P=. 001) and WHR (0. 82 to 0. 81, P=. 009), but no interactions with group. The intervention did not affect alcohol consumption, physical activity, smoking, or HRV. Data collected during the online sessions suggested that the changes in fruit and vegetable consumption were driven by the motivational and maintenance phases of the program. CONCLUSIONS Results suggest that the program helped individuals to increase their consumption of fruit and vegetables and to sustain this over a 6 -month period. The observed reduction in fat and sugar intake suggests that monitoring behaviors over time is effective, although further research is needed to confirm this conclusion. The Web-based nature of the program makes it a potentially cost-effective way of promoting healthy eating...|$|R
40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the {{dolomitization}} in the Latemar Lower Platform Facies and the underlying Contrin Formation (Northern Italy), which have not been studied in detail. Several dolomitized pipe-like structures occur that crosscut both the Contrin and the Sciliar carbonates (Latemar Formation). The origin of these massive and vertically oriented pipe structures and their relation to crosscutting mafic dikes {{is part of this}} ongoing petrographical, geochemical (stable O- and C-isotopes, Sr- & Mg-isotopes) and petrophysical (poroperm) study. The Latemar group is crosscut by numerous mafic dikes that are related to the nearby Predazzo Intrusion. These mafics {{have played a role in}} the dolomitization in the Latemar group. First of all, contact metamorphism in the host limestone caused formation of marble and recrystallization confined within a zone of a few meters around the dikes. This often prevents dolomitization inside the contact aureole around these dikes. Secondly, reactivation of the fractures that are now filled by dike material causes brecciation along the carbonate – dike contact and forms a permeable pathway for dolomitizing fluids along these dikes. Thirdly, dolomite bodies are repeatedly bounded by these dikes. Even though they have formed a pathway for fluids, dolomitization is often limited to one side of a dike. Staining and crosscutting relationships between different dolomite and calcite veins show a clear decrease in Fe content, with early generations of dolomite veins having very high Fe contents and later (saddle) dolomite veins having successively lower and lower Fe content. Calcite veins mainly occur subsequent to the formation of the last generation of dolomite veins and also have a low Fe content. Within almost all dolomite bodies of the Valsorda valley local variations exist in the Fe content of the replacive dolomite. Therefore it is concluded that these dolomite bodies did not form as the result of one pulse but are the combined result of multiple pulses. An important difference between the lowermost part of the Latemar group and the upper parts is the fact that almost all limestone in the lower part is completely recrystallized (often coarse crystalline) after most of the replacement dolomite was formed. It is still unclear if this massive recrystallization phase is driven by the same mechanism that caused dolomitization or is caused by a different system. The geospatial <b>allocation</b> of dolomite <b>bodies</b> and dikes is studied on a high-resolution photorealistic 3 D model to overcome field access limitations and obtain a detailed distribution of dolomite body occurrences. Field observations and laboratory measurements can be implemented in this model. Large scale dolomitization patterns, their relation to the dikes and the distribution of properties (poroperm, isotopes) within dolomite bodies can then be studied. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the spatial {{distribution}} and genesis of dolomite in the Lower Platform Facies of the Latemar Formation and the underlying Contrin Formation in the Latemar buildup (Dolomites, Northern Italy). The Contrin Formation is completely dolomitized. From this formation several dolomitized pipe-like structures up to 100 m in diameter occur that extend from into the Latemar Formation. In addition large dolomite bodies (50 - 100 m) occur scattered in the Lower Platform Facies. The origin of these massive dolomite structures and their relation to crosscutting mafic dikes and the nearby Predazzo Intrusion {{is part of this}} ongoing petrographical, geochemical (stable C- and O-isotopes, Sr- & Mg-isotopes) and petrophysical (poroperm) study. The Latemar group is crosscut by numerous mafic dikes that are related to the nearby Predazzo Intrusion (Ladinian age). These mafics {{have played a role in}} the dolomite distribution and the fluid circulation in the Latemar group. First of all, contact metamorphism prevents dolomitization inside the contact aureole around these dikes. Secondly, reactivation of the fractures that host the dike material causes brecciation along the carbonate–dike contact and forms a permeable pathway for dolomitizing fluids.
