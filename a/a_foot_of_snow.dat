25|$|The {{heaviest}} snow in Maryland {{fell from}} the northern suburbs of Washington, D.C., to the Baltimore area. These areas overwhelmingly saw over <b>a</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>snow.</b> Snowfall rates of 2–3inches (5–8cm) per hour were common, and thundersnow occurred. Snowfall amounts of up to 21inches (53cm) were reported in Columbia, 13.1inches (33.3cm) in Baltimore, 17inches (43cm) in Catonsville, and a foot (30.5cm) in Potomac. This was the area's heaviest snow since the North American blizzard of 2003. Lesser amounts occurred in western and southern parts of the state.|$|E
25|$|The North American Blizzard of 2006 was a nor'easter {{that began}} {{on the evening of}} February 11, 2006. It dumped heavy snow across the Mid-Atlantic and New England states, from Virginia to Maine through the early evening of February 12, and ended in Atlantic Canada on February 13. The major cities from Baltimore to Boston {{received}} at least <b>a</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>snow,</b> with a second-highest amount of 26.9inches (68.3cm) in New York City, the (at the time) most since at least 1869, the start of record keeping, only broken by the January 2016 United States blizzard nearly 10 years later.|$|E
25|$|As {{the storm}} {{moved into the}} Northeastern United States and {{portions}} of Ontario and Quebec on December 2, six inches (152mm) of snow fell in portions of central New York, while three inches (76mm) of snow fell across New Jersey with a dusting in several other areas. A second band of precipitation during the late hours produced areas of rain and freezing rain (of up to four-tenths of an inch of ice) across several valley areas from New York to Pennsylvania, with rain further {{to the east and}} south, while locally over <b>a</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>snow</b> fell across parts of Upstate New York, Vermont and New Hampshire, causing several accidents which forced the shutdown of northbound Interstate 89.|$|E
5000|$|... "Most notably, {{the weather}} was ominous - cloudy and cool. The opening-night party was at a private house {{and it was an}} {{invitational}} affair.

60|$|Daylight had {{not broken}} across the prairie when, floundering through <b>a</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> dusty <b>snow,</b> Winston reached the Grange. He was aching from fatigue and cold, and the deerskin jacket {{stood out from}} his numbed body stiff with frost, when, leaning heavily on a table, he awaited Colonel Barrington. The latter, on entering, stared at him, and then flung open a {{cupboard}} and poured out a glass of wine.|$|R
25|$|As {{the storm}} redeveloped off the Atlantic Coast on December 3 and 4, it gave {{another round of}} heavy and mixed {{precipitation}} for New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island and Nova Scotia. Areas of northern and eastern New Brunswick received over <b>a</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>snow,</b> causing the city of Moncton to shut down all services, while several flights from airports in Moncton, Saint John, Fredericton and Halifax were cancelled. In Fredericton, a unique phenomenon consisting of blowing and heavy snow along with winds produced several giant snowballs, called snowrollers, across several front lawns. About 24,000 homes in New Brunswick, 8,000 in Nova Scotia and 14,500 in Prince Edward Island were without power due to the snow, mixing and strong winds.|$|E
25|$|On November 19, 1981, a rapid {{accumulation}} of over <b>a</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>snow</b> caused {{the roof to}} collapse, requiring it to be re-inflated. It deflated the following winter on December 30, 1982, again because of a tear caused by heavy snow. This was {{four days before the}} Vikings played the Dallas Cowboys in the last regular-season game of the 1982 NFL season. In the spring following that same winter, on April 14, 1983, the Metrodome roof deflated because of a tear caused by a late-season heavy snow, and the scheduled Twins' game with the California Angels was postponed. On April 26, 1986, the Metrodome roof suffered a slight tear because of high winds, causing a nine-minute delay {{in the bottom of the}} seventh inning versus the Angels; however, the roof did not deflate.|$|E
25|$|Another major {{winter storm}} {{developed}} on December 14 {{east of the}} Rockies and across the southern states and traveled across {{many of the same}} areas, bringing significant snows to areas that were affected by both ice storms. Portions of Kansas received over a foot (30cm) of snow on top of the accumulated ice. The system moved across the Great Lakes region on December 15 and 16 and intensified while adding moisture from a developing coastal low as well as residual moisture from what was Tropical Storm Olga that affected most of the Antilles and Caribbean. Several areas in the Midwest and eastern North America received close to <b>a</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>snow</b> including Chicago, some areas of the Toronto and Detroit areas, Montreal, and Ottawa. Accumulations of as much as 20inches (50cm) fell across northern New England, northern New York, eastern Ontario from rural eastern Ottawa to Cornwall, and north of the Saint Lawrence River in the province of Quebec into the Charlevoix region. Thundersnow was even reported across portions of southern Ontario and Quebec. Widespread amounts of snow between 8 and 14inches (20–35cm) were reported across Ontario, Quebec, most of New England and the Canadian Maritimes as well as in several areas of the Midwest including Kansas and Missouri, while between a half-inch to an inch (13–25mm) of ice fell across higher elevations in Maryland and Virginia with significant icing as well over West Virginia and Pennsylvania. This was accompanied by heavy rain between 2 and 4inches (50–100mm) south of the Mason–Dixon line towards the Carolinas and the Southeast, with significant rainfall across the Middle Atlantic Coast, coastal sections of Nova Scotia, and the Avalon Peninsula of Newfoundland and Labrador. Additionally, heavy thunderstorms developed across the Southern states near the Gulf of Mexico coast, where tornado watches were issued for portions of Alabama, Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina on December 15 with several tornadoes later confirmed. The storm finally exited off the coast into the Atlantic Ocean on December 18.|$|E

2500|$|The storm system began {{developing}} on February 11 as {{a relatively}} minor system, bringing some snow along the southern Appalachian range. The low pressure center moved off-shore early February 12 before it began its rapid intensification. By early morning, snow began falling heavily, taking several forecasters by surprise who had expected about <b>a</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>snow,</b> at most, along the eastern fringes of the Atlantic seaboard. [...] During {{the height of the}} storm on Sunday morning the 12th, thunder and lightning occurred as the snow fell. The presence of this thundersnow shows how energetic this storm became.|$|E
2500|$|From Texas {{north and}} east through Ohio, heavy snow fell. According to The Weather Channel and the National Weather Service, Dallas and Fort Worth {{received}} anywhere from [...] to [...] Sherman, Texas received , while Collinsville, TX got 8inches. Cincinnati, Ohio received [...] which broke the daily snowfall record for March 7. The Memphis metropolitan area received anywhere from [...] in Lakeland, Tennessee to [...] at the NWS office in East Memphis, with the Memphis International Airport picking up , its heaviest snowfall in 20 years.

2500|$|That evening a civilian, John [...] "Portugee" [...] Phillips, {{volunteered to}} carry a {{distress}} message to Fort Laramie. Carrington's message to General Cooke told of the Fetterman disaster and requested immediate reinforcements and repeating Spencer carbines. Carrington sent Phillips and another messenger, Philip Bailey, out that evening on the Fort's best remaining horses. Phillips accomplished the 236-mile ride to Fort Laramie in four days. A blizzard began on December 22, and Phillips rode through <b>a</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>snow</b> and below-zero temperatures. He saw no Indians during his ride. He arrived at Fort Laramie {{late in the evening}} on December 25 during a full-dress Christmas ball, and staggered, exhausted, into the party to deliver his message.|$|E
2500|$|Albuquerque averages around 9 inches <b>of</b> <b>snow</b> per winter, and {{experiences}} several accumulating snow events each season. [...] Locations in the Northeast Heights and Eastern Foothills tend to receive more snowfall due to each region's higher elevation and {{proximity to the}} mountains. [...] The city {{was one of several}} in the region experiencing a severe winter storm on December 28–30, 2006, with locations in Albuquerque receiving between [...] <b>of</b> <b>snow.</b> [...] More recently, a major winter storm in late February 2015 dropped up to <b>a</b> <b>foot</b> (30cm) <b>of</b> <b>snow</b> on most <b>of</b> the city.|$|R
50|$|Southern England saw {{up to half}} <b>a</b> <b>foot</b> (15 cm) <b>of</b> <b>snow,</b> causing travel {{disruption}} {{right across}} the region.

5000|$|The weather on {{any given}} day and indeed for entire seasons can be very unpredictable. Some winters feature several <b>feet</b> <b>of</b> <b>snow</b> and cold temperatures, while others like that of 1976-77 (in the January of which Anchorage amazingly {{averaged}} [...] warmer than Atlanta almost 30 degrees closer to the equator), just <b>a</b> <b>foot</b> or two <b>of</b> <b>snow</b> and frequent thaws, which put dangerous ice on the streets.|$|R
2500|$|The {{regiment}} {{spent the}} harsh winter of 1862-3 in the Shenandoah Valley, without seeing action. Few {{of the men}} were equipped with tents, most slept in the open on the frozen ground and, according to Goldsborough, [...] "it was no unusual thing to see several hundred men arise from a covering of <b>a</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>snow</b> that had fallen during the night." [...] In May 1863 the regiment was united with the Baltimore Light Artillery and Company A of the 1st Maryland Cavalry (CSA), as Colonel Johnson, under orders by the Secretary of War, began to organize the various Maryland units under one command, with a view to forming {{for the first time a}} true Maryland Line in the Confederate Army.|$|E
2500|$|This {{event was}} the second of four nor'easters during the 2009-2010 winter that brought heavy snow to enough of the Northeast's {{population}} to be numerically recognized by NOAA's NESIS intensity rating. [...] The first and third of these systems, the December 2009 Nor'Easter and the February 9–10, 2010 North American blizzard, respectively, combined with this event to bring the snowiest winter on record {{to much of the}} Mid-Atlantic. [...] Additionally, this event {{was the second}} of three major Mid-Atlantic snowstorms that occurred over a 12-day period; each subsequent storm focused its heaviest snow slightly farther north: the January 30, 2010 storm (not recognized by NESIS) dropped more than <b>a</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>snow</b> across Virginia and the lower Chesapeake Bay region, while the February 9–10, 2010 North American blizzard bulls-eyed the Maryland-Pennsylvania border with as much as 38.3 inches.|$|E
2500|$|As {{the snow}} wound down Saturday night, {{snowfall}} totals were over 20inches (50cm) for parts of central Ohio, with most areas of Ohio reporting over 10inches (25cm). Port Columbus reported total snowfall of , the most ever recorded for central Ohio. Large sections of Ohio including the Dayton and Cincinnati areas were under snow emergencies. 5to 7inches (12–17cm) fell across Mississippi with over <b>a</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>snow</b> (30cm) {{in parts of}} Kentucky (including Louisville) and Tennessee. [...] Residents reported in Leitchfield, KY that snow accumulated to 6-8inches, with 10 at most in rural areas. For portions of Middle Tennessee, {{it was the worst}} snowstorm since 2003. Humphreys and Perry Counties along the Tennessee River both exceeded 8inches (20cm) of snow while portions of the Nashville area received its biggest snowfall since March 19, 1996, where 9inches (22cm) fell. A large area of Tennessee affected by the winter storm were hit by several strong and deadly tornadoes just over one month earlier on February 5.|$|E
50|$|On Saturday, October 29, 2011, Washingtonville {{was also}} ravaged by an {{unexpected}} early snow storm. Up to <b>a</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> heavy wet <b>snow</b> {{fell on the}} town.

Over 90% of residents were left without power.|$|R
50|$|These {{mountains}} are {{high enough to}} receive snowfall in the winter, perhaps up to a dozen times. Occasionally, when a cold, wet storm comes in from the Gulf of Alaska or Canada, Mt. Hamilton and the surrounding peaks get significant snowfall. In February 2001, 30 in <b>of</b> <b>snow</b> fell, and in March 2006, the peak was left with over <b>a</b> <b>foot</b> (30 cm) <b>of</b> <b>snow</b> in one night.|$|R
50|$|The {{station was}} 10 miles (16 km) from the Pacific Ocean and some 8.4 km {{east of the}} coastal {{community}} of Hebo. Due to local orographic lift of the predominant westerly Pacific airflow, Mount Hebo is often rainy, windy, cold, and snowy. Three giant Air Force radomes, about 140 ft in diameter and 100 ft high, were destroyed by the elements: the first was constructed in 1962 and was destroyed by high winds on 12 Oct 1962 while yet incomplete; the second was built in 1963 and was destroyed by lightning and high winds in Jan 1964; the third was a different design and constructed in 1965, but it eventually succumbed to the winds in 1968. The top of Mount Hebo is usually under <b>a</b> few <b>feet</b> <b>of</b> <b>snow</b> during the winter.|$|R
2500|$|The {{soldiers}} had to heat their forks in the coals of their fires {{to prevent the}} tines from freezing to their tongues. A blizzard on March 5 deposited over <b>a</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>snow</b> and significantly delayed Crook's progress. Temperatures fell so low that the thermometers of the day could not record the cold. Crook's column slowly followed the Bozeman Trail north to Old Fort Reno, reaching it on March 5. There, the expedition established its supply base, leaving the wagons and Infantry accompanying the column, Companies C, and I, of the 4th U.S. Infantry, under Captain Edwin M. Coates. The five Cavalry battalions then marched {{to the head of}} Otter Creek. On March 16, scout Frank Grouard saw two Indian warriors observing the soldiers. He identified them as Oglala Lakota and believed that the camp of Crazy Horse might be nearby. [...] This was reported to Crook, and at 5 p.m. he divided his command and sent Colonel Joseph J. Reynolds (a West Point classmate of President Ulysses S. Grant, and a combat veteran of both the Mexican-American War, and Civil War) on a night march with about 383 men, with rations for one day, following the trail of the two Oglalas southeast toward Powder River. Crook kept with him about 300 men. That night Frank Grouard and the other scouts followed the two Oglala Sioux's trail in the snow. It led right to what they were looking for, an Indian village, which they described as containing more than 100 lodges on the west bank of Powder River. The scouts immediately reported this information back to Colonel Reynolds.|$|E

Airlines canceled over 1,300 flights {{in or out of}} New York airports. Parks in New York City were closed, and construction was halted. In Nassau County, New York, more than 140 trucks put sand and salt on roads. Schools were closed in Connecticut. Due to sufficiently cool air and steady snowfall, the National Weather Service issued a winter storm warning.

Within the confines of Torre there is a castle and a Catholic church, the church tower was built by Savino Barello. Each year on Fat Tuesday there is a town gathering at the bar where the citizens gather and eat beans—cooked in a terra cotta pot over an open flame—and soup.

50|$|Matters {{of weather}} play {{a large role}} in IMINT failure. While radar imaging can see through clouds, it is {{unlikely}} that a general satellite sweep could find something buried under <b>a</b> few <b>feet</b> <b>of</b> <b>snow</b> or in <b>a</b> frozen lake. Another problem with satellite imagery {{is that it is a}} simple snapshot in time. If the satellite that captures the image is not in a geo-synchronous orbit, there is a risk of the target not being there when the satellite passes over the area again. There is also the possibility of camouflage. For example, the entrance to an underground bunker may be camouflaged with foliage and it would take an arduous examination of the image to find the information needed. Another potential failure is a satellite being unavailable at the time needed because it is being used for other intelligence purposes, and the situation or event of interest is missed. Images can also be misinterpreted, generating misleading information and potentially supporting a bad decision.|$|R
