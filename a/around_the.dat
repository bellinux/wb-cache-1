5|$|The {{middle layer}} of the heart wall is the myocardium, which is the cardiac muscle – a layer of {{involuntary}} striated muscle tissue surrounded by a framework of collagen. The cardiac muscle pattern is elegant and complex, as the muscle cells swirl and spiral <b>around</b> <b>the</b> chambers of the heart, with the outer muscles forming a figure 8 pattern <b>around</b> <b>the</b> atria and <b>around</b> <b>the</b> bases of the great vessels, and inner muscles formining a figure 8 <b>around</b> <b>the</b> two ventricles and proceed toward the apex. This complex swirling pattern allows the heart to pump blood more effectively.|$|E
