He was the starting quarterback for Center in his junior year, throwing for 777 yards in the first eight games of the season. In his junior year of basketball, Vlasic was a starter, in one game scoring 23 points and 11 rebounds with <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>back.</b> He continued to play football and basketball during his senior year, with performances that included a 36-point effort against Las Vegas Western High School, making 18 of 20 shots.

5|$|County cricket fully resumed in 1946. Hutton {{was troubled}} by his injury; his wrists no longer rotated fully and he {{abandoned}} the hook shot. Nevertheless, he scored 1,552 runs {{at an average of}} 48.50, and was recognised by Wisden as Yorkshire's most effective batsman as the county won their fourth consecutive championship title. His four centuries included 183 not out against the touring Indian team, but he was less successful in the three Tests, scoring 123 runs at an average of 30.75. England won the series 1–0 but Hutton's only fifty was a defensive innings in the second Test, when he {{was troubled by}} <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>back.</b> He was omitted from the Gentlemen and Players match, but was part of the MCC team touring party for the 1946–47 tour of Australia.|$|E

50|$|He {{is famous}} for his semi final match in the 1994 BDO World Darts Championship against crowd {{favourite}} Bobby George. He defeated Wayne Weening, Leo Laurens and Martin Adams {{to set up a}} match with George who was struggling with <b>a</b> very <b>bad</b> <b>back</b> following his quarter final win over Kevin Kenny.

5000|$|In his fictional backstory, Mason was {{originally}} born in June 1999. His birth date {{was changed to}} 15 February 1995 upon his introduction. Mason arrived in Erinsborough two weeks after his family due to being in juvenile detention, where he was serving a three-month sentence. Glockner revealed that Mason had fallen in with <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> crowd <b>back</b> in Mount Isa, where his family are from, and was led astray by [...] "troublemaker" [...] Robbo Slade (Aaron Jakubenko). Robbo developed a plan to rob a local warehouse, which Mason went along with - but it went wrong. While Robbo escaped, Mason was caught and the arresting officer was his father Matt (Josef Brown).|$|R
500|$|Although Kidd {{drove his}} dancers hard, {{partly because he}} himself was capable of doing all the dance steps that he {{required}} of them, his personal style was gentle. Nanette Fabray, who performed in Love Life, could only make dancing turns {{to the left side}} because of a hearing problem. Rather than insisting she turn to the right, as many choreographers would do, Kidd [...] "found that fascinating, and he made all the other dancers turn to the left". Julie Andrews recalled that the [...] "Burlington Bertie From Bow" [...] number in Star! was physically demanding, and she balked when Kidd asked her for a retake, saying she had <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>back.</b> Andrews recalled that [...] "he looked crestfallen. Then he said, 'I wasn't trying to be mean. I just knew that when you saw it on film, you wouldn't be pleased.' I always thought that was a nice way to say, 'Once more.|$|E
500|$|He was {{inspired}} by his sister Colleen to study Early Childhood Education, and became convinced that teaching preschool children [...] "was my calling". He was also attracted to the field's freedom, artistic nature, and lack of discipline, which was different from his experience in boarding school. Field put off university when The Cockroaches became successful, but he was dissatisfied with touring and plagued by [...] "perhaps irrational, but very real, feelings of inadequacy and depression". By his mid-twenties, {{he decided that he}} did not want to tour any longer, so he took two breaks. His first break was as an infantry soldier, medic, and rifleman in the 5th/7th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment, Australia's regular army from 1982 to 1985. He played the bagpipes in parades and on training missions, but ended his military service in July 1985 and suffered from <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>back</b> as a result of his training. He also went backpacking in the U.K., listening to roots music, to children's music by artists like Raffi, and to recordings of children's books.|$|E
2500|$|Motz's playing career {{ended at}} the age of 29, after he was found to have a {{displaced}} vertebra – indeed, he had been playing with <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>back</b> for over a year. After his retirement from cricket, he became a taxi driver. He also ran a sports business, and then ran a pub in Timaru. [...] In later years, he put on considerable weight, ending over 30 stone.|$|E
50|$|Jacky Ickx won in 1969 {{driving a}} Brabham. The Belgian had made <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> start, clawed <b>back</b> {{through the field}} and after a long battle with Stewart, Ickx took the lead from Stewart on Lap 5. The Scot fell back with gearbox problems, leaving the Belgian in a {{dominant}} position. Stewart was able {{to hold on to}} second place. German driver Gerhard Mitter was killed during practice driving a BMW 269 Formula 2 car after his rear suspension failed and the car went straight on at the downhill section near the very fast Schwedenkreuz bend. This was the fifth Formula One-related fatality at the 14.2-mile German circuit in 15 years, the most out of all the circuits yet used for the championship.|$|R
60|$|Three o'clock came in due course, but no Hilda. Philip {{was seriously}} disturbed; {{but there was}} now no train by which she could arrive that day, so {{he was forced to}} the {{conclusion}} that she had postponed her departure. There were now two things to be done, one to follow her down to where she was staying--for he had ascertained her address from Mrs. Jacobs; the other, to return home and come back on the morrow. For reasons which appeared to him imperative, but which need not be entered into here, he decided on the latter course; so leaving a note for his wife, he drove, in <b>a</b> very <b>bad</b> temper, <b>back</b> to Paddington in time to catch the five o'clock train to Roxham.|$|R

2500|$|In another rain-affected {{match it}} was agreed that the MCC could bat first to get some batting practice. David Lloyd (66) and John Edrich (51) made 108 for the first wicket until Edrich [...] "retired out" [...] with <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>back</b> and {{declared}} the innings at 159/2 after 34 overs. No England bowler took a wicket in the home innings as the top scorer Brian Kensey was run out for 30 and the game ended with them 58/1.|$|E
2500|$|Kennedy {{was unable}} to enlist in the {{military}} to serve in World War II because of <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>back,</b> {{so he decided to}} channel his patriotism towards combatting racial injustices in the Jim Crow South. He is best known for infiltrating the Georgia Ku Klux Klan and exposing their secrets on the popular children's radio program The Adventures of Superman, trivializing their rituals. He also targeted the Columbians, an Atlanta-based neo-Nazi organization. Kennedy said, [...] "There were an awful lot of evils abroad in the world at the time, as there still are, but I couldn't help but feel that racism was perhaps the most evil".|$|E
2500|$|Two St. Elsewhere {{characters}} were carried {{over to the}} NBC series , which was executive produced by St. Elsewhere alumnus Tom Fontana. In an episode in season six entitled [...] "Mercy," [...] Alfre Woodard reprises her role of Dr. Roxanne Turner, {{who is accused of}} illegally euthanizing a cancer patient. Woodard was nominated for an Emmy Award as Outstanding Guest Actress in a Drama Series for her performance. [...] In other Homicide episodes, the character of Detective Tim Bayliss (played by Kyle Secor) develops <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>back</b> and is treated by an offscreen [...] "Dr. Ehrlich."

2500|$|The {{style of}} film is {{presented}} in a nonlinear narrative. Each scene is introduced using a title card showing which of the 500 days it is. Co-writer of the film Scott Neustadter admitted the film {{was based on a}} real romance. Neustadter explains that when he met the real girl who inspired the character Summer as a student at the London School of Economics in 2002, he was rebounding from <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> breakup <b>back</b> home, and promptly fell [...] "crazily, madly, hopelessly in love" [...] with the girl who [...] "returned his kisses but not his ardor." [...] The ending of the relationship was [...] "painfully and unforgettably awful," [...] which prompted him to co-write the film with Michael H. Weber. When Neustadter later showed the script to Summer's real life counterpart, she said she related more to the Tom character. Weber also stated that, [...] "we've all been in the trenches of love, we've all gone through the highs and lows, so Scott and I felt {{that the only way to}} tell this story was to come at it from a completely real place. It was pretty interesting for us because Scott was just going through a break-up and I was in a long-term relationship, so we each brought a totally opposite perspective, living it and not living it, and I think that tension helped to bring out more of the comedy".|$|R
50|$|Bruce is {{a working}} friend of Terry, {{and at first}} keeps asserting that he is 'not Terry's mate'. Bruce is {{described}} as having <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> haircut, glasses and a sweet but goofy smile. He owns a florist's shop called 'Freda's Flowers', which his mother, Freda, used to run, before she died. He treats Dixie like a daughter and she in return adores him. Bruce damages his already <b>bad</b> <b>back</b> halfway through the book, and while heaving Rochelle's dressing table up the stairs, he damages it, and is unable to walk or sit up, and has {{to stay at the}} Diamond residence lying on a mattress. It is suggested he and Sue might begin a romantic relationship. Dixie calls him 'Uncle Bruce'.|$|R
5000|$|Triumph insulted {{the entire}} state of New Jersey when he {{traveled}} to the Meadowlands to interview Bon Jovi on their return to their home state (according to Triumph: [...] "much like poop, returning up into the butthole"). He proceeded to tear down everything the band has done, knocking their age, lack of media ("People have come {{from as far away as}} exit 12!"), Jon Bon Jovi's foray into acting ("You're doing a vampire movie, yes? That's good. Finally a role that requires you to suck!") and even humped Heather Locklear's arm. (She was married to Bon Jovi lead guitarist Richie Sambora at the time). Triumph displayed a mock playlist on the stage consisting of song titles like [...] "Crap", [...] "Poop", [...] "Loads of Crap (ballad version)" [...] and others saying [...] "They haven't closed with [...] "Turd" [...] since 1989! Awesome!" [...] He visited the [...] "real heterosexuals" [...] (the road crew) and produced his own bong made from a doggy squeaky toy and an Alpo can. He, naturally, insulted every drunk fan he could find, knocking the 1980s dress and hair along with the blue collar and unemployment jokes. For his finale, he got to sing [...] "You Give Love <b>a</b> <b>Bad</b> Name" [...] with the band and his own words: Humped a shar pei/ pulled out too late/ now that bitch has a litter of eight/ they eat all the Alpo, right off my plate/ why the hell didn't I just masturbate?!

[...] Jenny later cares for Eugene while he recovers from Headstone's attack on his life. She may have a romance with Sloppy {{at the end of}} the book, which the reader may surmise will end in marriage. Although her mannerisms give her a certain [...] "strangeness", Jenny is very perceptive, identifying Eugene Wrayburn's intentions towards Lizzie in his small actions. Her role is a creator and a caretaker, and her [...] "pleasant fancies" [...] of [...] "flowers, bird song, numbers of blessed, white-clad children" [...] reflect the mind's ability to rise above adverse circumstances.|$|E
2500|$|A common sight-gag of {{the show}} was George {{slamming}} the door in Bentley's face mid-conversation. Bentley also had <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>back,</b> and frequently needed George to walk on his back. He also became known for addressing the Jeffersons as [...] "Mr. J" [...] and [...] "Mrs. J". Zara Cully played George's mother, Olivia [...] "Mother" [...] Jefferson, who constantly disparaged her daughter-in-law. Cully, who had {{first appeared in the}} 1974 All in the Family episode, [...] "Lionel's Engagement", reprised her role. She appeared regularly in the first two seasons, but made sporadic appearances {{over the next two years}} and was written out in the fifth season (Cully died in 1978, from lung cancer; no episode was centered on Mother Jefferson's death, but it was mentioned that she had died in season 5). Ned Wertimer played the doorman, Ralph Hart, throughout the series, along with Danny Wells who played Charlie the bartender.|$|E
2500|$|On June 20, 1965, Sinatra, Martin, and Davis, with Johnny Carson as the emcee (substituting for Bishop, who was {{out with}} <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>back),</b> {{performed}} their only televised concert together during {{the heyday of the}} Pack at the Kiel Opera House in St. Louis, a closed-circuit broadcast done as a fundraiser for Dismas House (the first halfway house for ex-convicts) and fed live to movie theatres across the country.

2500|$|Proximate cause {{means that}} you {{must be able to}} show that the harm was caused by the tort you are suing for. The defense may argue that there was a prior cause or a {{superseding}} intervening cause. A common situation where a prior cause becomes an issue is the personal injury car accident, where the person re-injures an old injury. For example, someone who has <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>back</b> is injured in the back in a car accident. Years later he is still in pain. He must prove the pain is caused by the car accident, and not the natural progression of the previous problem with the back. [...] A superseding intervening cause happens shortly after the injury. For example, if after the accident the doctor who works on you commits malpractice and injures you further, the defense can argue that it was not the accident, but the incompetent doctor who caused your injury.|$|E
2500|$|Julian Dalrymple-Sykes (Ben Aris) (Series 5, Series 8–9) Dancing Instructor – Julian was {{a former}} lover of Yvonne's who stood in for Barry when he was {{incapacitated}} with <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>back</b> during the 1959 season. He then joined Yvonne full-time at the camp following Barry's departure mid-way through the 1960 season. Julian was a pig farmer by profession and had a very successful business, which he left {{in the care of}} his assistant Mr Turner (Billy Burden) when he went to work at Maplins. He was also a championship boxer having been ABA welterweight champion four years running in the 1940s, and challenged Ted to a fight after an argument in one episode. After joining Maplins full-time, he briefly shared Ted and Spike's chalet before being given one of his own, and annoyed Ted with his habit of getting up early to go for a morning swim. Throughout the series he desperately tried to rekindle his past romance with Yvonne, but she frequently played hard-to-get, which frustrated him enormously. He tried to persuade Yvonne to leave Maplins and live with him at his pig farm, but she refused, claiming that she [...] "couldn't stand the mud". After the 1960 season, he sold his farm and took Yvonne travelling around the world.|$|E
2500|$|Barry Stuart-Hargreaves [...] (Series 1–7) (Barry Howard) Dancing Instructor – Barry {{was born}} Bert Pratt in Nottingham, {{the son of}} a bus inspector. By the late 1930s he was living in Sunderland where he met Yvonne and they began a brief affair, but she left him for another man. She later {{returned}} to him when she was pregnant, and he proposed. He took Yvonne's last name, and changed his first name to Barry, for the sake of their careers. During World War II he was conscripted into the Royal Navy and served as a stoker, though it is presumed he did not do this for long as he and Yvonne became ballroom champions in 1942. After the war, he and Yvonne continued dancing, but their careers were drawing to an end, and in 1956 they joined Maplins as a last resort. He was often heavily criticised by Yvonne for his etiquette, a habit which annoyed him intensely. Although his official jobs were to teach dance and give ballroom demonstrations, Barry was regularly chosen against his will to be the victim of the campers in the entertainment events, such as getting covered in water while dressed as a granny, having spaghetti stuffed down his trousers, and dressing up as [...] "Percy the Pixie" [...] to entertain the children. Barry suffered from <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>back,</b> and on one occasion during the 1959 season he was left unable to move after straining it. Yvonne called in Julian Dalrymple-Sykes to take his place in the ballroom until he recovered, though it was made clear that Barry already knew about Julian and his history with Yvonne. Barry left Yvonne and departed Maplins midway through the 1960 season, and it is unknown why he left or where he went. Throughout the series, several hints were made that Barry was actually gay, although this was never confirmed.|$|E
