5|$|In 1967, the British Whippet Racing Association was {{established}} to bring around reform and consistency in race rules and procedures for races involving non-purebred Whippets. A year later, viewing the non-purebred dogs <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat,</b> the Whippet Club Racing Association {{was established}} exclusively for purebred animals.|$|E
5|$|Adams also {{rebuilt the}} Navy, adding six fast, {{powerful}} frigates, {{most notably the}} USS Constitution. To pay for the military buildup, Congress imposed new taxes on property: the Direct Tax of 1798. It was the first (and last) such federal tax. Taxpayers were angered, especially in southeast Pennsylvania, where the bloodless Fries's Rebellion broke out among rural German-speaking farmers who protested what they saw <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> to their republican liberties and to their churches.|$|E
5|$|Between 1025 and 1028, the Fatimids {{reached an}} {{agreement}} with Salih's Jarrahid/Tayyi allies, allowing them to maintain their foothold in interior Palestine, while Anushtakin was recalled to Cairo. In contrast to the Mirdasids, the Tayy consistently plundered their territory and its inhabitants. Moreover, the Fatimids would not tolerate independent rule in Palestine, which they viewed <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> to the Caliphate's survival.|$|E

5|$|By 2003, many Turks {{had come}} to see American foreign policy in the region <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat.</b> Matters were not helped by the {{election}} in 2002 of the Justice and Development Party (AKP). The election of the AKP led to an immediate increase in tensions with America, especially after the Parliament's decision not to send any Turkish troops to Iraq further eroded US-Turkish relations. 70% of the parliament members were Justice and Development Party members.|$|E
5|$|During the 1989 season, 11–year veteran Ottis Anderson, a Plan B Free Agent, {{emerged as}} the Giants new {{featured}} running back. His style of power running was an ideal fit for Parcells' offensive strategy and he ran for 1,023yards and caught 28 passes. Dave Meggett also emerged <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> on third downs and special teams, catching 34 passes for 531yards and making the Pro Bowl.|$|E
5|$|Franz Ferdinand was an {{advocate}} of increased federalism and widely believed to favor trialism, under which Austria-Hungary would be reorganized by combining the Slavic lands within the Austro-Hungarian empire into a third crown. A Slavic kingdom {{could have been a}} bulwark against Serb irredentism, and Franz Ferdinand was therefore perceived <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> by those same irredentists. Princip later stated to the court that preventing Franz Ferdinand's planned reforms was one of his motivations.|$|E

5|$|Habitat {{destruction}} {{represents a}} threat to biodiversity in Croatia, as developed and agricultural land is expanded into previous natural habitats, while habitat fragmentation occurs as roads are created or expanded. A further threat to biodiversity is the introduction of invasive species, with Caulerpa racemosa and C. taxifolia identified as especially problematic ones. The invasive algae are monitored and regularly removed to protect the benthic habitat. Agricultural monocultures have also been identified <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> to biodiversity.|$|E
5|$|In a 2016 {{oral history}} of South Park in The Hollywood Reporter, Vernon Chatman, {{the voice of}} Towelie {{as well as a}} writer and {{producer}} on the show said that after Comedy Central censored the episode, series co-creator Trey Parker purchased a ticket to South Africa and showed it {{to the head of the}} network <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> because Dave Chappelle had fled to Africa, though Parker never actually went.|$|E
5|$|Murdoch's {{previous}} {{foray into}} the sport was advising Amstrad chairman Alan Sugar to support Terry Venables's takeover bid for Tottenham Hotspur. The club, {{on the verge of}} bankruptcy, courted newspaper owner Robert Maxwell, someone whom Murdoch regarded <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat.</b> Murdoch chose not to make a bid for Tottenham himself, for conflict of interest reasons, and used his newspapers to create momentum in favour of Sugar.|$|E

5|$|Other {{immunotherapy}} treatments {{interfere with}} the binding of programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) protein with its ligand PD-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1). Signaling through PD-1 inactivates T cells. Some cancer cells appear to exploit this by expressing PD-L1 in order to switch off T cells that might recognise them <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat.</b> Monoclonal antibodies targeting both PD-1 and PD-L1, such as pembrolizumab and nivolumab are currently in clinical trials for treatment for lung cancer.|$|E

5|$|Some of {{the militias}} that were then {{competing}} for power interpreted the UN troops' presence <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> to their hegemony. Consequently, several gun battles {{took place in}} Mogadishu between local gunmen and peacekeepers. Among these was the Battle of Mogadishu of 1993, a US apprehension of two high-ranking lieutenants of faction leader Aidid. The UN soldiers eventually withdrew altogether from the country on 3 March 1995, having incurred more significant casualties.|$|E

5|$|The Gospels {{say that}} Jesus was betrayed to the {{authorities}} by a disciple, and many scholars consider this report to be highly reliable. He was executed on the orders of Pontius Pilate, the Roman prefect of Judaea. Pilate most likely saw Jesus' reference to the Kingdom of God <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> to Roman authority and worked with the Temple elites to have Jesus executed. The Sadducean high-priestly leaders of the Temple more plausibly had Jesus executed for political reasons than for his teaching. They may have regarded him <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> to stability, especially after he caused a disturbance at the Second Temple. Other factors, such as Jesus' triumphal entry into Jerusalem, {{may have contributed to}} this decision. Most scholars consider Jesus' crucifixion to be factual, because early Christians would not have invented the painful death of their leader.|$|E
5|$|The Habsburg Charles II of Spain {{was dying}} {{at this time}} and had no children. At Charles' request, Innocent advised that the throne pass to Philip of Anjou, {{grandson}} of Louis XIV of France, due to the close kinship between Louis and Charles. Philip succeeding to the Spanish throne was seen <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> to {{the balance of power}} by other European nations, leading to the War of the Spanish Succession upon Charles' death, which took place six weeks after Innocent's own.|$|E
5|$|The prey {{does not}} have to be {{attracted}} towards the predator for the predator to benefit: it is sufficient for the predator simply not to be identified <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat.</b> Wicklerian-Eisnerian mimics may resemble a mutualistic ally, or a species of little significance to the prey such as a commensal. For example, the spider Arachnocoris berytoides resembles Faiditus caudatus, a spider commensal of ants.|$|E

5|$|After the lynchings {{of their}} {{prominent}} competitors, the WSGA's {{control over the}} range was undisputed, until a group of smaller ranchers led by a local cowboy named Nate Champion formed the Northern Wyoming Farmers and Stock Growers' Association (NWFSGA) {{to compete with the}} WSGA. Upon hearing this, the WSGA immediately viewed Champion's association <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> to their hold on the stock interests. The WSGA then blacklisted members of the NWFSGA from the round-ups in order to stop their operations. However, the latter refused the orders to disband and instead publicly announced their plans to hold their own round-up in the spring of 1892.|$|E
5|$|As the Golden Path secures Kyrat's {{southern}} provinces, Ajay is {{contacted by}} Willis Huntley (Alain Goulem), a CIA agent who offers intelligence for the rebels and pages from his father's diary {{in exchange for}} killing Yuma's lieutenants. After Ajay kills several of them, Huntley admits they were in fact CIA assets, {{and that he was}} sent to clean up after the CIA as the agency did not see Pagan <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> anymore. Huntley betrays Ajay to Pagan just as the Golden Path prepare to push into Northern Kyrat.|$|E
5|$|As the {{hurricane}} turned northward and was seen <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> to the Hawaiian Islands, {{officials in the}} Papahanaumokuakea requested that all 17personnel in the region be evacuated. Several days before the storm passed through the islands, an AC-130 aircraft was flown to the area and evacuated the people stationed on Tern Island, while a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration vessel evacuated the temporary residents on Laysan Island. Hurricane Neki caused relatively little damage in the Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument. All of the structures were undamaged; however, two small natural habitat islands, Round and Disappearing Islands, were affected substantially. The former lost some land area and the latter was completely washed away.|$|E
