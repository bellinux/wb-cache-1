5|$|Approximately 400 were built, with Gordon and Dexter citing {{sources that}} state 389 or 399. They <b>also</b> <b>provide</b> <b>a</b> yearly {{production}} table that lists 35 built in 1928, 47 in 1929, 250 in 1930 and 55 in 1931, which {{add up to}} 389 when the two prototypes are included.|$|E
5|$|Dive {{computers}} <b>also</b> <b>provide</b> <b>a</b> {{measure of}} safety for divers who accidentally dive a different profile to that originally planned. If the diver exceeds a no-decompression limit, decompression additional to the ascent rate will be necessary. Most dive computers {{will provide the}} necessary decompression information for acceptably safe ascent {{in the event that}} the no-decompression limits are exceeded.|$|E
5|$|Independent {{companies}} <b>also</b> <b>provide</b> <b>a</b> battery replacement service, {{returning the}} original unit with new battery but original case. Alternatively {{it is possible}} for a technically competent user to buy and install a new battery. The task does not require soldering, but is technically challenging.|$|E

5|$|Nationally {{important}} {{populations of}} breeding waders {{are present in}} the Outer Hebrides, including common redshank, dunlin, lapwing and ringed plover. The islands <b>also</b> <b>provide</b> <b>a</b> habitat for other important species such as corncrake, hen harrier, golden eagle and otter. Offshore, basking shark and various species of whale and dolphin can often be seen, and the remoter islands' seabird populations are of international significance. St Kilda has 60,000northern gannets, amounting to 24% of the world population; 49,000breeding pairs of Leach's petrel, up to 90% of the European population; and 136,000pairs of puffin and 67,000northern fulmar pairs, about 30% and 13% of the respective UK totals. Mingulay is an important breeding ground for razorbills, with 9,514pairs, 6.3% of the European population.|$|E
5|$|P.atriplicifolia is {{frequently}} propagated by cuttings. Because its woody crown is resistant to division, softwood cuttings {{are taken from}} shoots near the base, generally in late spring. Hardwood cuttings selected in mid-to-late summer <b>also</b> <b>provide</b> <b>a</b> viable propagation technique. The plant is also grown from seed in cultivation. Such seeds require exposure to cold for 30–160 days to germinate, and seed-raised specimens may not preserve the characteristics of named cultivars. In the commercial greenhouse or nursery setting, P.atriplicifolia relatively large size and rapid growth can adversely affect quality or make plants more difficult and expensive to transport; the use of plant growth regulators such as chlormequat chloride and daminozide may be more cost-effective than large-scale pruning.|$|E
5|$|Ultrasound is {{commonly}} used {{in the evaluation of}} people who have sustained physical trauma, for example with the FAST protocol. Ultrasound may be more sensitive than chest X-rays in the identification of pneumothorax after blunt trauma to the chest. Ultrasound may <b>also</b> <b>provide</b> <b>a</b> rapid diagnosis in other emergency situations, and allow the quantification {{of the size of the}} pneumothorax. Several particular features on ultrasonography of the chest can be used to confirm or exclude the diagnosis.|$|E

5|$|A {{personal}} dive {{computer is}} a small computer designed to be worn by a diver during a dive, with a pressure sensor and an electronic timer mounted in a waterproof and pressure resistant housing which has been programmed to model the inert gas loading of the diver's tissues in real time during a dive. A display allows the diver to see critical data during the dive, including the maximum and current depth, duration of the dive, and decompression data including the remaining no decompression limit calculated in real time for the diver throughout the dive. The dive computer keeps track of residual gas loading for each tissue used in the algorithm. Dive computers <b>also</b> <b>provide</b> <b>a</b> measure of safety for divers who accidentally dive a different profile to that originally planned. Most dive computers will provide the necessary decompression information for acceptably safe ascent {{in the event that}} the no-decompression limits are exceeded. The use of computers to manage recreational dive decompression is becoming the standard and their use is also common in occupational scientific diving. Their value in surface supplied commercial diving is more restricted, but they can usefully serve as a dive profile recorder.|$|E
5|$|Because the Sprint was {{designed}} to operate at short range, a single base could not provide protection to a typical US city, given urban sprawl. This required the Sprint launchers to be distributed around the defended area. Because a Sprint launched from a remote base might not be visible to the MAR during {{the initial stages of}} the launch, Bell proposed building a much simpler radar at most launch sites, the Missile Site Radar (MSR). MSR would have just enough power and logic to generate tracks for its outgoing Sprint missiles and would hand that information off to the DCDPS using conventional telephone lines and modems. Bell noted that the MSR could <b>also</b> <b>provide</b> <b>a</b> useful second-angle look at threat tubes, which might allow the decoys to be picked out earlier. Used as radio receivers, they could also triangulate any radio broadcasts coming from the threat tube, which the enemy might use as a radar jammer.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} be issued an {{identity}} card, one needs to fill in a form, which {{should be taken to}} the Identity Documents and Passport Regime Units within the District Police Stations. The forms could be obtained at all District Police Stations. When applying the name, gender, date and place of birth, digital image, ten fingerprints, palmprints, and an electronic signature in a JPEG2000 format are taken. First-time appliers must <b>also</b> <b>provide</b> <b>a</b> valid birth certificate. It is possible for a person to apply for a renewal of the ID card via a representative with a notary signed permit, provided there are no significant changes in his or hers appearance. There are, however limitations. If you apply via a representative, you must receive the new ID yourself. Vice versa, if you applied yourself, then an authorized representative may receive your ID. This does not apply to applying for passports, as fingerprints must be taken.|$|E
