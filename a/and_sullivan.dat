5|$|After {{the success}} of Trial by Jury, Gilbert <b>and</b> <b>Sullivan</b> were {{suddenly}} in demand to write more operas together. Over the next two years, Richard D'Oyly Carte and Carl Rosa were two of several theatrical managers who negotiated with the team but were unable to come to terms. Carte proposed a revival of Thespis for the 1875 Christmas season, which Gilbert <b>and</b> <b>Sullivan</b> would have revised, but {{he was unable to}} obtain financing for the project. In early 1876, Carte requested that Gilbert <b>and</b> <b>Sullivan</b> create another one-act opera on the theme of burglars, but this was never completed.|$|E
5|$|During {{the years}} when the Gilbert <b>and</b> <b>Sullivan</b> operas were being written, Richard D'Oyly Carte also {{produced}} operas and plays by other writing teams, {{as well as other}} works to fill the Savoy Theatre in between new operas. Many of these were companion pieces to the Gilbert <b>and</b> <b>Sullivan</b> operas, as the Victorian audiences preferred long evenings in the theatre. Some, however, were new full-length pieces either for the Savoy or for Carte's touring companies, which toured the Gilbert <b>and</b> <b>Sullivan</b> operas, and these new works, extensively. Carte and Lenoir also continued to run his management agency. As an example of their level of activity, an 1881 souvenir programme commemorating the 250th performance of Patience in London and its 100th performance in New York states that, in addition to these two productions of Patience, Carte was simultaneously producing many other projects. These included two companies touring with Patience, two touring with other Gilbert <b>and</b> <b>Sullivan</b> operas, one touring with the operetta Olivette (co-produced with Charles Wyndham), one with Claude Duval in America, a production of Youth running at a New York theatre, a lecture tour by Archibald Forbes (a war correspondent) and productions of Patience, Pirates, Claude Duval and Billee Taylor in association with J. C. Williamson in Australia, among other things.|$|E

5|$|Gilbert <b>and</b> <b>Sullivan</b> scored {{their first}} {{international}} hit with H.M.S. Pinafore (1878), satirising {{the rise of}} unqualified people to positions of authority and poking good-natured fun at the Royal Navy and the English obsession with social status (building on a theme introduced in The Sorcerer, love between members of different social classes). As {{with many of the}} Gilbert <b>and</b> <b>Sullivan</b> operas, a surprise twist changes everything dramatically {{near the end of the}} story.|$|E
5|$|In fact, the {{management}} knew about Bond's abscess, since Sullivan's diary records that {{both he and}} Gilbert visited her during her temporary incapacity, <b>and</b> <b>Sullivan</b> paid the doctor's bill.|$|E
5|$|Recordings of {{excerpts}} from the Gilbert <b>and</b> <b>Sullivan</b> operas began {{to be released in}} 1906. In 1917, the Gramophone Company (also known as HMV) produced the first album of a complete musical score of a Gilbert <b>and</b> <b>Sullivan</b> opera, The Mikado, followed by recordings of eight more of the operas. Electrical recordings of the complete musical scores of most of the operas were then issued by the Gramophone Company and Victor Talking Machine Company beginning in the late 1920s. These recordings were supervised by Rupert D'Oyly Carte. The original D'Oyly Carte Opera Company continued to produce well-regarded recordings until 1979, helping to keep the operas popular through the decades. Many of these recordings have been reissued on CD. After the copyrights on the operas expired, other professional companies were free to perform and record the operas. Many performing companies arose to produce the works, such as Gilbert <b>and</b> <b>Sullivan</b> for All in Britain and the Light Opera of Manhattan and Light Opera Works in the U.S., and existing companies, such as English National Opera and Australian Opera added Gilbert <b>and</b> <b>Sullivan</b> to their repertories. These companies also released popular audio and video recordings of the operas. In 1966 and again in the 1980s, BBC Radio presented complete cycles of the thirteen extant Gilbert <b>and</b> <b>Sullivan</b> operas, with dialogue. In 1980, a Broadway and West End production of Pirates produced by Joseph Papp brought new audiences to Gilbert <b>and</b> <b>Sullivan,</b> and between 1988 and 2003, the revived D'Oyly Carte Opera Company revived the operas on tour and on the West End, also recording seven of the operas. A set of eleven of the operas (omitting the last two) was produced in 1982 for television, ten of which are available on VHS and DVD.|$|E

The group {{is directed by}} Alistair Donkin, a former principal comic for the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company. Members of the group have won several awards at the International Gilbert <b>and</b> <b>Sullivan</b> Festival. Sale Brass is a traditional brass band based in Sale, formed in about 1849 as the Stretford Temperance Band. Its first recorded performance was at the 1849 opening of the railway between Manchester and Altrincham.|$|E
5|$|Star Trek {{has been}} blended with Gilbert <b>and</b> <b>Sullivan</b> at least twice. The North Toronto Players {{presented}} a Star Trek adaptation of Gilbert & Sullivan entitled H.M.S.

Pinafore {{that sets the}} operetta {{in the world of}} Star Trek has played in Los Angeles and was attended by series luminaries Nichelle Nichols, D.C. Fontana and David Gerrold. A similar blend of Gilbert <b>and</b> <b>Sullivan</b> and Star Trek was presented as a benefit concert in San Francisco by the Lamplighters in 2009. The show was entitled Star Drek: The Generation After That. It presented an original story with Gilbert <b>and</b> <b>Sullivan</b> melodies.|$|E

5|$|After {{the success}} of Trial by Jury, there were discussions towards {{reviving}} Thespis, but Gilbert <b>and</b> <b>Sullivan</b> {{were not able to}} agree on terms with Carte and his backers. The score to Thespis was never published, and most of the music is now lost. It took some time for Carte to gather funds for another Gilbert <b>and</b> <b>Sullivan</b> opera, and in this gap Gilbert produced several works including Tom Cobb (1875), Eyes and No Eyes (1875, his last German Reed Entertainment), and Princess Toto (1876), his last and most ambitious work with Clay, a three-act comic opera with full orchestra, as opposed to the shorter works for much reduced accompaniment that came before. Gilbert also wrote two serious works during this time, Broken Hearts (1875) and Dan'l Druce, Blacksmith (1876).|$|E
5|$|By the 19th-century, the act {{of suicide}} had shifted from being viewed as caused by sin to being caused by {{insanity}} in Europe. Although suicide remained illegal during this period, it increasingly became the target of satirical comments, such as the Gilbert <b>and</b> <b>Sullivan</b> musical The Mikado that satirized the idea of executing someone who had already killed himself.|$|E
5|$|Carte {{had been}} {{planning}} {{to build a new}} theatre for several years to promote English comic opera and, in particular, the Gilbert <b>and</b> <b>Sullivan</b> operas. With profits from the Gilbert <b>and</b> <b>Sullivan</b> operas and his concert and lecture agency, he bought property along the Strand in 1880 with frontage onto the Thames Embankment, where he built the Savoy Theatre in 1881. Carte chose the name in honour of the Savoy Palace, which had been built on the site in the thirteenth century by Peter, Count of Savoy. It later passed to John of Gaunt but was destroyed in the Peasants' Revolt in 1381. The Savoy Theatre was a state-of-the-art facility, setting a new standard for technology, comfort and decor. It was the first public building in the world to be lit entirely by electric lights and seated nearly 1,300 people (compared to the Opera Comique's 862).|$|E

5|$|Carte's real {{ambition}} was {{to develop}} an English form of light opera that would displace the bawdy burlesques and badly translated French operettas then dominating the London stage. He assembled a syndicate and formed the Comedy Opera Company, with Gilbert <b>and</b> <b>Sullivan</b> commissioned to write a comic opera that would serve as the centrepiece for an evening's entertainment.|$|E
5|$|Former {{chairman}} Eggert Magn√∫sson {{made clear}} his ambition for West Ham {{to move to}} the Olympic Stadium after the 2012 Summer Olympics, a desire reiterated by current chairmen Gold <b>and</b> <b>Sullivan</b> when they assumed control of the club stating that they felt it was a logical move for the Government {{as it was in the}} borough of Newham.|$|E
5|$|Gilbert <b>and</b> <b>Sullivan</b> operas {{have been}} {{translated}} into many languages, including Portuguese, Yiddish, Hebrew, Swedish, Dutch, Danish, Estonian, Hungarian, Russian, Japanese, French, Italian, Spanish (reportedly including a version of Pinafore transformed into zarzuela style), Catalan and others.|$|E

5|$|Gilbert <b>and</b> <b>Sullivan</b> {{refers to}} the Victorian-era {{theatrical}} partnership of the librettist W. S. Gilbert (1836‚Äì1911) and the composer Arthur Sullivan (1842‚Äì1900) and to the works they jointly created. The two men collaborated on fourteen comic operas between 1871 and 1896, of which H.M.S. Pinafore, The Pirates of Penzance and The Mikado {{are among the best}} known.|$|E
5|$|Gilbert next wrote The Mountebanks with Alfred Cellier and the flop Haste to the Wedding with George Grossmith, <b>and</b> <b>Sullivan</b> wrote Haddon Hall with Sydney Grundy. Gilbert {{eventually}} won the lawsuit, but {{his actions}} and statements had been hurtful to his partners. Nevertheless, the partnership {{had been so}} profitable that, after the financial failure of the Royal English Opera House, Carte and his wife sought to reunite the author and composer. In late 1891, after many failed attempts at reconciliation, Gilbert and Sullivan's music publisher, Tom Chappell, stepped in to mediate between two of his most profitable artists, and within two weeks he had succeeded, eventually leading to two further collaborations between Gilbert <b>and</b> <b>Sullivan.</b>|$|E
5|$|Gilbert's aggressive, though successful, {{legal action}} had embittered Carte <b>and</b> <b>Sullivan,</b> but the {{partnership}} {{had been so}} profitable that Carte and his wife eventually sought to reunite the author and composer. After several attempts by the Cartes, the reconciliation finally came {{through the efforts of}} Tom Chappell, who published the sheet music to their operas. In 1893, Gilbert <b>and</b> <b>Sullivan</b> produced their penultimate collaboration, Utopia, Limited. While Utopia was being prepared, Carte produced Jane Annie, by J. M. Barrie and Arthur Conan Doyle, with music by Ernest Ford. Despite the popularity of Barrie and Conan Doyle, the show was a flop, closing after only 51 performances.|$|E

25|$|Another {{predominant}} tag team rivalry {{heading into}} the event pitted the team of Eddie Gilbert and Rick Steiner against Varsity Club (Kevin <b>Sullivan</b> <b>and</b> Dan Spivey) for the NWA United States Tag Team Championship. At Chi-Town Rumble, the United States Tag Team Champions Kevin <b>Sullivan</b> <b>and</b> Steve Williams failed in their opportunity for the NWA World Tag Team Championship against Road Warriors. On March 18 edition of World Championship Wrestling, Eddie Gilbert and Rick Steiner defeated <b>Sullivan</b> <b>and</b> Williams to win the United States Tag Team Championship. On April 2 edition of Clash of the Champions, Gilbert <b>and</b> Steiner defeated <b>Sullivan</b> <b>and</b> Dan Spivey to retain the titles.
