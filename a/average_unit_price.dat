30|$|Competitive {{tendering}} and entry {{regulations are}} difficult to combine, particularly in smaller markets.

On <b>average,</b> <b>unit</b> <b>prices</b> have dropped, but there are reports of isolated cases of higher prices. In general, the quality of the service has improved, although there are examples to the contrary. This research has shown that, within the Norwegian regulatory framework, the challenge has not been to maintain services to the outermost rural areas, as was the case in Sweden, but to maintain the service in communities between these areas and regional centres. This could be attributed to the fact that in the outermost rural areas the entry regulation protects the incumbent from competition. In the in-between areas, where the markets are larger, the taxi service industry is faced with much stiffer competition from the minibus industry, which is not entry regulated, and has a different cost structure.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present {{research}} was to analyze the available data on river restoration projects in Europe. As the framework of our study, we conducted a structured international survey. We asked selected entities and experts from among those responsible for river restoration in European countries about the details and costs of European Union river restoration projects. We examined 119 river restoration projects that were implemented in Europe between 1989 and 2016; during the collection of data, some of the projects were still ongoing. Based upon the collected data we observed that the number of river restoration projects has been increasing since 1989, which expresses society’s growing interest in improving the quality of aquatic environments. We revealed that 56 % of these European river restoration projects have been implemented by dedicated entities and stakeholders, not as part of any structured, larger-scale river restoration policy. This indicates that most European countries do not have integrated plans for river restoration. Our analysis showed that 52 % of the projects analyzed have been designed and implemented without the participation of local stakeholders. It also showed that the budgets for river restoration projects did not differ significantly across various time horizons from 1989 to 2016.

30|$|In {{the first}} step, all the devices {{register}} basic {{information for the}} upcoming 15  min. In the second step, all the consumers send out price queries to renewable energy producers or to storage units of the community. After all queries have been responded to, consumers sort all possible offers according to the updated <b>unit</b> <b>prices.</b> The received responses are sorted by the following guidelines: (i) Sort from the lowest price to the highest price. (ii) Rank down the unresponsive devices. At the same time, heat pumps receive the demand of hot water from their connected water tanks. Heat pumps convert the requested volume into needed electricity and broadcast the demand to connected devices. Meanwhile, water tanks calculate their new <b>averaged</b> <b>unit</b> <b>price</b> of the stored hot water for the upcoming trading period. In the third step, producers ask for the sorted result from their connected consumers and make their own list of ranks based on the preference of consumers. The guideline for producers to sort their connected consumers follows: (i) Outdated information is not considered for sorting. (ii) Sort all consumers based on their Rank. The smallest Rank is placed highest in the list. (iii) For two items with the same Rank, the smaller Total ranks up. (iv) Devices with larger consumption are ranked down. In the heating network, the water tanks query houses for the hot water consumption at this step. At stage four, nodes with negative energy load initiate energy transactions based on the sorted rank list. If one heat pump receives energy during this stage, it immediately initiates another transaction in the heating network to the connected water tank, as it consumes electricity to produce heat. Similarly, in the heating grid, each water tank transacts hot water to corresponding households. If there are still residues of generation or lack of supply, at the final clearing step five, producers and consumers act {{at the same time}} with storage or grid to offset the surplus or deficiency. It is possible for devices in the community to define “blacklists” for some connected devices. The communication is cut off with the blacklisted device. This mechanism allows punishment against deceit or unaffordable energy price.|$|R
40|$|In {{the early}} 1970 s, {{research}} {{carried out on}} rechargeable lithium batteries at the Exxon Laboratories in the US established that lithium ions can be intercalated electrochemically into certain layered transition-metal sulphides, the most promising being titanium disulphide. Stemming from this discovery for titanium disulphide, there has been increased interest on lithium-ion intercalation compounds for application in rechargeable batteries. The first rechargeable lithium cell was commercialized in late 1980 s by Moli Energy Corporation in Canada. The cell comprised a spirally wound lithium foil as the anode, a separator and MoS 2 as the cathode. The cell had a nominal voltage of 1. 8 V and an attractive value of specific energy, which was 2 to 3 times greater than either lead-acid or nickel-cadmium cells. However, the battery was withdrawn from the market after safety problems were experienced. This paved way for the discovery of lithium-ion battery. The origin of lithium-ion battery lies in the discovery that Li+-ions can be reversibly intercalated within or deintercalated from the van der Walls gap between graphene sheets of carbon materials at a potential close to the Li/Li+ electrode. Thus, lithium metal is replaced by carbon as the anode material for rechargeable lithium-ion batteries, and {{the problems associated with}} metallic lithium mitigated. Complimentary investigations on intercalation compounds based on transition metals resulted in establishing LiCoO 2 and LiNiO 2 as promising cathode materials. By employing aforesaid intercalation materials, namely carbon and LiCoO 2 respectively, as negative and positive electrodes in a non-aqueous lithium-salt electrolyte, a Li-ion cell with a voltage value of about 3. 5 V resulted. These findings led to a novel rechargeable battery technology. Lithium-ion batteries were first introduced commercially in 1991 by the Sony Corporation in Japan. Other Japanese manufacturers soon entered the market, followed closely by American and European companies. The subsequent growth in sales of the batteries was truly phenomenal. Beginning from 1991, the lithium-ion battery market has grown from an R&D interest to sales of over 400 million units in 1999. The global market value for lithium-ion batteries at original equipment manufacturer level was estimated to be $ 1. 86 billion in 2000. By 2006, the market is expected to grow to over 1. 2 billion units with value of over $ 4 billion, while the <b>average</b> <b>unit</b> <b>price</b> is expected to fall. Initially, realizable specific energy of commercial Li-ion battery was only about 120 Wh kg- 1. However, with continuing improvements in various cell components, present day Li-ion batteries can provide a specific energy density of about 200 Wh kg- 1. With the ‘holy grail’ far to be realized, the current R&D efforts are focussed on furthering the specific energy of lithium-ion batteries in conjunction with safety, environmental compatibility, and cost effectiveness. In the Li-ion cell, all of its electrochemical constituents, namely anode, cathode and electrolyte are central to its performance. This thesis describes some novel studies on cathode and anode materials for lithium-ion Batteries...|$|E

Results also show that the motivational effect of <b>unit</b> <b>pricing</b> operates independently of the cognitive effect, and that an individual's price consciousness moderates the motivational effect. The paper demonstrates that <b>unit</b> <b>pricing</b> increases consumer price sensitivity in the context of price discounts, extending the generalizability of the <b>unit</b> <b>pricing</b> effect. 13 page(s...|$|R
40|$|We {{conducted}} preference assessments with 4 typically developing {{children to}} identify potential reinforcers and assessed the reinforcing efficacy of those stimuli. Next, we tested two predictions of economic theory: that overall consumption (reinforcers obtained) would decrease as the <b>unit</b> <b>price</b> (response requirement per reinforcer) increased {{and that the}} cost and benefit components that defined <b>unit</b> <b>price</b> would not influence overall consumption considerably when <b>unit</b> <b>price</b> values were equal. We tested these predictions by arranging <b>unit</b> <b>price</b> such that the denominator was one (e. g., two responses produced one reinforcer) or two (e. g., four responses produced two reinforcers). Results showed that consumption decreased as <b>unit</b> <b>price</b> increased and that <b>unit</b> <b>price</b> values with different components produced similar consumption.

40|$|Purpose - This paper aims {{to first}} {{investigate}} how <b>unit</b> <b>pricing</b> affects consumers’ grocery purchase decisions {{and perceptions of}} the shopping task’s information load. The second goal is to test how time pressure enhances the behavioural and perceptual effects of displaying <b>unit</b> <b>prices.</b> Design/methodology/approach - Two on-line experiments were conducted using national samples of shoppers. In Study 1, participants indicated their choices and perceptions in an inter-brand shopping scenario where prepackaged products have conflicting positions on retail <b>price</b> and <b>unit</b> <b>price.</b> In Study 2, participants conducted the same shopping task but now under a condition of time pressure. Findings - Study 1 shows that <b>unit</b> <b>pricing</b> shifts consumer choices towards the lower <b>unit</b> <b>priced</b> options and improves their perceptions of task information load. Study 2 shows that when consumers are under time pressure, <b>unit</b> <b>pricing</b> shows stronger effects on choices but not on perceptions. Research limitations/implications - The study comprised a fairly homogenous set of low involvement categories and relatively small assortments in a hypothetical purchase setting. Exploration {{of the role of}} <b>unit</b> <b>pricing</b> in more complex and more realistic purchase environments pose suitable avenues for future research. Practical implicationsThis study shows that consumers benefit from <b>unit</b> <b>pricing</b> because it makes it easier for them to find the lower <b>unit</b> <b>priced</b> items and to more quickly complete their shopping task. Retailers will benefit from increased customer satisfaction and possibly an improved store image. Social implications - The study shows that consumers generally benefit from the presence of <b>unit</b> <b>pricing</b> and that <b>unit</b> <b>price</b> information does not create harmful effects in terms of increasing their information load. Originality/value - This study uses a specifically designed and controlled but nevertheless realistic grocery choice task to study the effects of <b>unit</b> <b>pricing</b> in an inter-brand context where there are only small differences in size and price. The study contributes to the literature by showing that in such conditions, <b>unit</b> <b>prices</b> help consumers compare the economic losses associated with product options. Their heuristic role is more pronounced when consumers are under time pressure. The study shows that consumers generally benefit from the presence of <b>unit</b> <b>prices.</b> 21 page(s...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT <b>Unit</b> <b>pricing</b> {{at retail}} can be {{recommended}} when the <b>unit</b> <b>price</b> is more informative {{to the consumer}} than the traditional price. Using data from twelve cities over four years, per dozen retail egg prices in Grade A large and medium sizes were compared to the equivalent per ounce <b>unit</b> <b>price.</b> The {{results show that the}} per ounce <b>unit</b> <b>price</b> would not present the consumer with more informative price information than was presented by traditional methods of pricing...|$|R
