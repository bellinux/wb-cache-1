The acidic strength of the catalysts was measured using a n-butylamine potentiometric titration method. The bulk BaTiO 3 catalyst exhibits a tetragonal phase with the P 4 mm space group. A structural transition from tetrahedral to cubic phase was observed for Fe, Co and Ni doped BaTiO 3 catalysts with an increase in doped metal concentration from 1 to 5 mol%. The particle sizes of the catalysts were calculated from TEM images and are in the range of 30 - 80 nm.

40|$|With the {{exception}} of osmium, iridium is the least abundant of the six platinum group metals. It is of crucial importance i n a number of high technology applications and, {{at least in the}} past, has been regarded as a strate-gic material and stockpiled by majorgovernments. In recentyears it has become more readily available, prompting renewed interest by researchers, including those seeking to develop improved catalysts. In this paper we discuss the results of our investigations on the use of iridium as an hydrogenation catalyst. Data are presented on the characteristics of an iridium-based catalyst developed here for the effective and selective synthesis of substituted N-aryl-hydroxylamines and chloro-substituted anilines, symmetric and asymmetric <b>azoxybenzenes,</b> and unsaturated alcohols. These demonstrate that iridium is unique among the platinum metals. Historically, the interest of researchers in the use of iridium as a catalyst for the hydrogena-tion of organic compounds has been intermit-tent. One recent period of activity occurred in the late 1960 s to early 1970 s when the charac-teristics and properties of various iridium-based catalysts were investigated. Russian scientists were involved in these researches; in particular, a new procedure to prepare a boron-promoted iridium-based catalyst, containing 0. 5 to 20 wt. % iridium and 0. 002 to 0. 45 wt. % boron based on the weight of carrier, and a carrier which is inert towards various chemicals wa...|$|R

40|$|The {{selective}} hydrogenation of aromatic nitrocompounds {{to their}} corresponding azoxy compounds is challenging in organic synthesis, which are typically performed under harsh reaction conditions. The core issue {{involved in this}} reduction is to finely control the product selectivity. Herein, we report an efficient photocatalytic process using supported silver–copper alloy nanoparticles (Ag–Cu alloy NPs) to selectively transform nitrobenzene to <b>azoxybenzene</b> by visible light irradiation under green mild reaction conditions. Ag–Cu alloy NPs can absorb visible light, causing excited hot-electrons due to the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) effect, and the excited electrons can activate the reactant molecule adsorbed on the NP surface to induce a reaction. The photocatalytic performance was affected by the Ag–Cu ratio, and the catalyst with an Ag–Cu molar ratio of 4 – 1 exhibited the optimal performance. Tuning the wavelength of incident light manipulated the product selectivity between <b>azoxybenzene</b> and aniline.
