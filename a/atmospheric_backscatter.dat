Statistical analyses of the data set by computer show that <b>atmospheric</b> <b>backscattering</b> is approximately lognormally distributed {{for all but the}} lowest altitudes, and a theoretical explanation is offered for this property. Seasonally-averaged profiles and altitudinally-stacked, filtered time sequences show the volcanic cloud appearing in the stratosphere and falling through the tropopause into the troposphere at rates far higher than can be explained by gravitational settling alone. The dynamic process of tropopause folding is proposed as the dominant mechanism for the observed exchange of volcanic debris from the stratosphere to the troposphere. This hypothesis is supported by case studies of mid-tropospheric backscatter-enhancing events. Mie calculations and comparisons with other measurements show that vertically-integrated backscatter is a good long-term measure of total atmospheric mass loading of volcanic debris. It is found that the time constant which characterizes debris removal is 208 days for the stratosphere and 60 days for the troposphere.

40|$|Lidar {{atmospheric}} {{systems have}} required large telescope for receiving <b>atmospheric</b> <b>backscatter</b> signals. Thus, the relative complexity {{in size and}} ease of operation has limited their wider use in the atmospheric science and meteorology community. The Holographic Airborne Rotating Lidar Instrument Experiment (HARLIE) uses a scanning holographic receiver and demonstrates that these issues can be overcome. HARLIE participated at the DOE-ARM Southern Great Plains site (CART) during the Water Vapor Intensive Operation Period (WVIOP 2000) held September-October 2000. It provided exceptional high temporal and spatial resolution measurements of aerosol and cloud backscatter in three dimensions. HARLIE recorded over 110 hours of data were recorded on 16 days between 17 September and 6 October 2000. Placed in a ground-based trailer for upward looking scanning measurements of clouds and aerosols, HARLIE provided a unique record of time-resolved <b>atmospheric</b> <b>backscatter</b> at 1 -micron wavelength.

The lidar is a compact, continuous wave system which can operate in two modes, multiple particle scattering and single particle scattering. In the multiple scattering mode, the lidar employs an extended focal volume and utilizes a technique similar to Dicke switching to achieve measurement of the volume backscatter. In the single scattering mode, the focal volume is reduced to ensure a high probability of single particle scattering. Measurement of the single particle backscatter {{as a function of}} time leads to the formation of signal histogram from which the volume backscatter can be inferred. In addition to providing the <b>atmospheric</b> <b>backscatter</b> value, appropriate data processing algorithms and focal volume calibration allow the single particle mode to yield information on the atmospheric aerosol scattering cross-section distribution...|$|E

The electrons are very strongly field-aligned, having pitch angles confined within 10 deg of the magnetic field.

In many cases, however, the observations may be interpreted directly on a qualitative basis and show the distribution of particulate matter in clear air or enable the dimensions of visible cloud to be measured accurately. In other cases, particularly where additional data are available, quantitative solutions can provide useful information on remote targets such as tenuous smoke clouds or haze layers.

40|$|Research has {{established}} {{the importance of}} global tropospheric wind measurements for large scale improvements in numerical weather prediction. In addition, global wind measurements provide data that are fundamental to the understanding and prediction of global climate change. These tasks are closely linked {{with the goals of}} the NASA Earth Science Enterprise and Global Climate Change programs. NASA Goddard has been actively involved in the development of direct detection Doppler lidar methods and technologies to meet the wind observing needs of the atmospheric science community. In this paper we describe a recently developed prototype wind lidar system using a direct detection Doppler technique for measuring wind profiles from the surface through the troposphere. This system uses a pulsed ND:YAG laser operating at 1064 nm as the transmitter. The laser pulse is directed to the atmosphere using a 40 cm diameter scan mirror. The portion of the laser energy backscattered from aerosols and molecules is collected by a 40 cm diameter telescope and coupled via fiber optics into the Doppler receiver. Single photon counting APD's are used to detect the <b>atmospheric</b> <b>backscattered</b> signal. The principle element of the receiver is a dual bandpass tunable Fabry Perot etalon which analyzes the Doppler shift of the incoming laser signal using the double edge technique. The double edge technique uses two high resolution optical filters having bandpasses offset relative to one another such that the 'edge' of the first filter's transmission function crosses that of the second at the half power point. The outgoing laser frequency is located approximately at the crossover point. Due to the opposite going slopes of the edges, a Doppler shift in the <b>atmospheric</b> <b>backscattered</b> laser frequency produces a positive change in signal for one filter and a negative change in the second filter. Taking the ratio of the two edge channel signals yields a result which is directly proportional to the component of the wind along the line-of-sight of the laser. Measuring the radial wind in several directions provides sufficient information to determine the true wind speed and direction. The lidar has operated from our laboratory at Goddard since June, 1997. Wind profiles have been obtained to altitudes of 12 km with a vertical resolution of 330 in. Vector wind data are obtained by rotating the scan mirror to measure line-of-sight wind profiles for at least two azimuth angles at an elevation angle of 45 degrees. The precision of the data as determined from the standard deviation of multiple independent lidar profiles is in the range of 1 to 3 m/sec up to 10 km. Good agreement is obtained when the lidar data are compared with the upper air rawinsonde soundings taken at Dulles airport. Examples of the wind lidar data will be presented along with a description of the instrument and future developments...|$|R
