50|$|<b>Asparagus</b> rust {{is found}} {{worldwide}} wherever garden <b>asparagus</b> (<b>Asparagus</b> officinalis) is grown. As with many crop diseases, rust disease caused by Puccinia <b>asparagi</b> spreads rapidly due to poor field maintenance and close proximity of crop fields - <b>asparagus</b> rust was enabled to establish itself from New Jersey to California in five years. The disease {{has long been}} known in Europe, but did not attain prominence in the United States until 1902. Since then, the rust has spread to every important asparagus-growing region in the United States. Even in areas with climate ill suited to support vegetation, such as the Imperial Valley of California, have reported severe rust damage, with many crop fields having 100% infection rate. Puccinia <b>asparagi</b> also attacks a number of nonedible species of <b>asparagus,</b> including A. brouseopetii, A. caspius, A. maritimus, A. medeoloides, <b>asparagus</b> fern (A. <b>plumosus),</b> and A. verticillatus.

30|$|We {{emphasize}} {{that it is}} not the use of calorie value and nutrition value is inappropriate or unsophisticated; it is that the adoption of calorie and nutrition measures may differentiate food commodities unnecessarily, and adds levels of complexity to the entire estimating process. For example, equivalent weight measures of fresh <b>asparagus,</b> frozen <b>asparagus,</b> cooked <b>asparagus,</b> and canned <b>asparagus</b> will have varying levels of calorie and nutrition. It is possible to make the same argument for the different varieties of <b>asparagus</b> (white, green, purple, and wild). Furthermore, other researchers have argued that where and how the produce is grown (in fertile versus arid lands; using various cultivation practices), processed, transported, stored, and prepared will influence calorie and nutrition values.|$|R

The harvest of various plants varies. Shoots, and leaves of some plants are harvested, while roots and tubers of others are picked like potatoes.

50|$|In the United Kingdom, {{colonies of}} Helicobasidium purpureum {{have been found}} on the living stems of dog's mercury (Mercurialis perennis) and {{stinging}} nettle (Urtica dioica). The fungus is also associated as a saprobe with decaying wood and stumps of broad leaf trees.

40|$|The signals {{controlling}} {{the abundance of}} transcripts up-regulated (pTIP 27, pTIP 31, and pTIP 32) or down-regulated (pTIP 20 and pTIP 21) after harvest in <b>asparagus</b> (<b>Asparagus</b> officinalis L.) spears were examined. pTIP 27 and pTIP 31 are known to encode asparagine synthetase (AS) and a beta-galactosidase (beta-gal) homolog, respectively. The nucleotide sequences of pTIP 20, pTIP 21, and pTIP 32 were determined, and they encode histone 3, histone 2 B, and an unknown product, respectively. Changes in respiration, soluble sugars, and abundance of the five mRNAs were similar in the tips stored as 30 -mm lengths {{or as part of}} 180 -mm spears. We previously hypothesized that sugars may regulate the level of AS transcripts in <b>asparagus</b> tissue. <b>Asparagus</b> cell cultures were used to test the role of sugar status may regulate the level of AS transcripts in <b>asparagus</b> tissue. <b>Asparagus</b> cell cultures were used to test the role of sugar status in regulating gene expression. Transcript abundance for AS, beta-gal, and pTIP 32 was low in cells in sugar-containing medium but increased within 12 h after transferring cells to a sugar-free medium. Histone 3 and histone 2 B transcripts were, in general, abundant in cells on sugar-containing medium but declined in abundance when transferred to sugar-free medium. When cells were returned to sugar-containing medium the abundance of transcripts for histone 3 and histone 2 B increased, whereas that for AS, beta-gal, and pTIP 32 decreased. Soluble sugar levels are known to decline rapidly in the tips of harvested spears. Metabolic regulation by sugar status may have a major influence on gene expression in <b>asparagus</b> spears and other tissue after harvest...|$|R
