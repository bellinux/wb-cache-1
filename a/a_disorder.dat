5|$|Although {{there are}} {{a wide range of}} {{attachment}} difficulties within the styles which may result in emotional disturbance and increase the risk of later psychopathologies, particularly the disorganized style, none of the styles constitute <b>a</b> <b>disorder</b> in themselves and none equate to criteria for RAD as such. <b>A</b> <b>disorder</b> in the clinical sense is a condition requiring treatment, as opposed to risk factors for subsequent disorders. Reactive attachment disorder denotes a lack of typical attachment behaviors rather than an attachment style, however problematic that style may be, in that there is an unusual lack of discrimination between familiar and unfamiliar people in both forms of the disorder. Such discrimination does exist as a feature of the social behavior of children with atypical attachment styles. Both DSM-IV and ICD-10 depict the disorder in terms of socially aberrant behavior in general rather than focusing more specifically on attachment behaviors as such. DSM-IV emphasizes a failure to initiate or respond to social interactions across a range of relationships and ICD-10 similarly focuses on contradictory or ambivalent social responses that extend across social situations. The relationship between patterns of attachment in the Strange Situation and RAD is not yet clear.|$|E

Although there is no known cure, there have been reported cases of children who recovered. Not many children with autism live independently after reaching adulthood, though some become successful.

5|$|Geophagy, the {{practice}} of eating soil or rock, has been observed in orangutans. There are three main reasons for this dietary behaviour: for the addition of mineral nutrients to their diet; for the ingestion of clay minerals that can absorb toxic substances; or to treat <b>a</b> <b>disorder</b> such as diarrhoea. Orangutans also use plants of the genus Commelina as an anti-inflammatory balm.|$|E

Eliashberg equations for s-wave superconductivity are generalized for such <b>a</b> <b>disordered</b> superconductor. Anderson's theorem is found to be violated in the sense that embedding of the impurities into a s-wave superconductor increases its critical temperature. We showed the amplification of superconducting properties is a result of nonelastic effects in a scattering by the impurities.

5|$|An ongoing {{question}} is whether RAD should {{be thought of as}} <b>a</b> <b>disorder</b> of the child's personality or a distortion {{of the relationship between the}} child and a specific other person. It has been noted that as attachment disorders are by their very nature relational disorders, they do not fit comfortably into noslogies that characterize the disorder as centered on the person. Work by C.H. Zeanah indicates that atypical attachment-related behaviors may occur with one caregiver but not with another. This is similar to the situation reported for attachment styles, in which a particular parent's frightened expression has been considered as possibly responsible for disorganized/disoriented reunion behavior during the Strange Situation Procedure.|$|E
5|$|Because the {{ketogenic}} diet {{alters the}} body's metabolism, it is a first-line therapy {{in children with}} certain congenital metabolic diseases such as pyruvate dehydrogenase (E1) deficiency and glucose transporter 1 deficiency syndrome, which prevent the body from using carbohydrates as fuel, leading to a dependency on ketone bodies. The ketogenic diet is beneficial in treating the seizures and some other symptoms in these diseases and is an absolute indication. On the other hand, it is absolutely contraindicated {{in the treatment of}} other diseases such as pyruvate carboxylase deficiency, porphyria and other rare genetic disorders of fat metabolism. A person with <b>a</b> <b>disorder</b> of fatty acid oxidation is unable to metabolise fatty acids, which replace carbohydrates as the major energy source on the diet. On the ketogenic diet, their body would consume its own protein stores for fuel, leading to ketoacidosis, and eventually coma and death.|$|E
5|$|In the {{clinical}} sense, <b>a</b> <b>disorder</b> {{is a condition}} requiring treatment as opposed to risk factors for subsequent disorders. There {{is a lack of}} consensus about the precise meaning of the term 'attachment disorder' although there is general agreement that such disorders only arise following early adverse caregiving experiences. Reactive attachment disorder indicates the absence of either or both the main aspects of proximity seeking to an identified attachment figure. This can occur either in institutions, or with repeated changes of caregiver, or from extremely neglectful primary caregivers who show persistent disregard for the child's basic attachment needs after the age of 6 months. Current official classifications of RAD under DSM-IV-TR and ICD-10 are largely based on this {{understanding of the nature of}} attachment.|$|E

5|$|The {{causes of}} plantar {{fasciitis}} {{are not entirely}} clear. Risk factors include overuse such as from long periods of standing, an increase in exercise, and obesity. It is also associated with inward rolling of the foot and a lifestyle that involves little exercise. While heel spurs are frequently found it is unclear {{if they have a}} role in causing the condition. Plantar fasciitis is <b>a</b> <b>disorder</b> of the insertion site of the ligament on the bone characterized by micro tears, breakdown of collagen, and scarring. As inflammation plays a lesser role, many feel the condition should be renamed plantar fasciosis. The diagnosis is typically based on signs and symptoms with ultrasound sometimes used to help. Other conditions with similar symptoms include osteoarthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, heel pad syndrome, and reactive arthritis.|$|E
5|$|With {{regard to}} sexual {{orientation}} categories, asexuality may be argued {{as not being}} a meaningful category {{to add to the}} continuum, and instead argued as the lack of a sexual orientation or sexuality. Other arguments propose that asexuality is the denial of one's natural sexuality, and that it is <b>a</b> <b>disorder</b> caused by shame of sexuality, anxiety or sexual abuse, sometimes basing this belief on asexuals who masturbate or occasionally engage in sexual activity simply to please a romantic partner. Within the context of sexual orientation identity politics, asexuality may pragmatically fulfill the political function of a sexual orientation identity category.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the terms}} of DrSteevens' will were that work on the {{hospital}} would not begin until after Griselda Steevens' death, she decided to begin work on the hospital in 1720. Reserving only £120 per year for her own use, she used the remaining funds to buy a plot of land near Kilmainham and to build the new hospital, with the sole condition being that she be granted a suite of apartments in the building. As a youth Griselda had suffered <b>a</b> <b>disorder</b> of the eyes, and since then had worn a veil while in sunlight. Shy and reclusive, while conducting her charitable works in the Dublin slums she would remain in her carriage while servants gave out alms to the poor. By 1723 a sufficient portion of the new Dr Steevens' Hospital was completed to accommodate 40 patients, in addition to Griselda's apartments. The remainder of the hospital, with space for 200 patients, opened in 1733. Griselda lived in the hospital from 1723 until her death.|$|E

5|$|Autism is <b>a</b> <b>disorder</b> that is {{associated}} with social and communicative deficits. A single cause of autism has yet to be identified, but the mu wave and mirror neuron system have been studied specifically for their role in the disorder. In a typically developing individual, the mirror neuron system responds when he or she either watches someone perform a task or performs the task him- or herself. In individuals with autism, mirror neurons become active (and consequently mu waves are suppressed) only when the individual performs the task him- or herself. This finding has led some scientists, notably V. S. Ramachandran and colleagues, to view autism as disordered understanding of other individuals' intentions and goals due to problems with the mirror neuron system. This deficiency would explain the difficulty people with autism have in communicating with and understanding others. While most studies of the mirror neuron system and mu waves in people with autism have focused on simple motor tasks, some scientists speculate that these tests can be expanded to show that problems with the mirror neuron system underlie overarching cognitive and social deficits.|$|E
5|$|If an {{underlying}} muscle disease is suspected, for instance {{if there is}} no obvious explanation or there have been multiple episodes, {{it may be necessary to}} perform further investigations. During an attack, low levels of carnitine in the blood and high levels of acylcarnitine in blood and urine may indicate a lipid metabolism defect, but these abnormalities revert to normal during convalescence. Other tests may be used at that stage to demonstrate these disorders. Disorders of glycolysis can be detected by various means, including the measurement of lactate after exercise; a failure of the lactate to rise may be indicative of <b>a</b> <b>disorder</b> in glycolysis, while an exaggerated response is typical of mitochondrial diseases. Electromyography (EMG) may show particular patterns in specific muscle diseases; for instance, McArdle's disease and phosphofructokinase deficiency show a phenomenon called cramp-like contracture. There are genetic tests available for many of the hereditary muscle conditions that predispose to myoglobinuria and rhabdomyolysis.|$|E
5|$|The use of bone {{building}} drugs, like bisphosphonates and anti-RANKL drugs {{require special}} consideration with implants, {{because they have}} been associated with <b>a</b> <b>disorder</b> called Bisphosphonate-associated osteonecrosis of the jaw (BRONJ). The drugs change bone turnover, which is thought to put people at risk for death of bone when having minor oral surgery. At routine doses (for example, those used to treat routine osteoporosis) the effects of the drugs linger for months or years but the risk appears to be very low. Because of this duality, uncertainty exists in the dental community about how to best manage the risk of BRONJ when placing implants. A 2009 position paper by the American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons, discussed that the risk of BRONJ from low dose oral therapy (or slow release injectable) as between 0.01 and 0.06 percent for any procedure done on the jaws (implant, extraction, etc.). The risk is higher with intravenous therapy, procedures on the lower jaw, people with other medical issues, those on steroids, those on more potent bisphosphonates and people who have taken the drug for more than three years. The position paper recommends against placing implants in people who are taking high dose or high frequency intravenous therapy for cancer care. Otherwise, implants can generally be placed and the use of bisphosphonates does not appear to affect implant survival.|$|E
40|$|People {{communicate}} to understand {{one another and}} share information. Speaking is crucial {{in the course of}} everyone's entire life. In this thesis, we have focused on the issues related to communication with seniors with <b>a</b> hearing <b>disorder.</b> It is necessary to properly diagnose the hearing disorder using suitable methods of examination, and subsequently propose possible means of therapy and train the patient on use of the hearing aid if necessary. Two objectives were set out, both of which were achieved. Objective 1 : Map the effective skills used by nurses when communicating with seniors with <b>a</b> hearing <b>disorder.</b> Objective 2 : Determine how unsuitable communication by nurses affects seniors with <b>a</b> hearing <b>disorder.</b> <b>A</b> quantitative and qualitative examination was performed. Within the quantitative examination, 200 questionnaires were handed out, of which 178 properly completed were returned for processing. The qualitative examination consisted of a semi-structured interview of ten seniors with <b>a</b> hearing <b>disorder</b> with the help of technology. We defined three hypotheses. Hypothesis 1 : The type of education affects nurses' communication skills with seniors with <b>a</b> hearing <b>disorder.</b> Hypothesis 2 : Nurses adhere to the principles of communication with seniors with <b>a</b> hearing <b>disorder.</b> Both hypotheses were confirmed. Hypothesis 3 : Nurses consider care for seniors with <b>a</b> hearing <b>disorder</b> to be <b>a</b> burden. The last hypothesis was not confirmed. Three research questions were also defined. Research question 1 : How does the current manner of communication by nurses affect seniors with <b>a</b> hearing <b>disorder?</b> Answer 1 : The current manner of communication of nurses with seniors with <b>a</b> hearing <b>disorder</b> has <b>a</b> positive effect. Research question 2 : How do seniors with <b>a</b> hearing <b>disorder</b> perceive non-verbal communication by nurses?

The ultrasonic attenuation, number density susceptibility, spin density susceptibility and the electrical conductivity are used as examples.
