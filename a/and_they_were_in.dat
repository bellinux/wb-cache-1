From then until the fourth centuryAD, copies of his orations multiplied <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> a relatively good position to survive the tense period from the sixth until the ninth centuryAD. In the end, sixty-one orations attributed to Demosthenes survived till the present day (some however are pseudonymous). Friedrich Blass, a German classical scholar, believes that nine more speeches were recorded by the orator, but they are not extant. Modern editions of these speeches are based on four manuscripts of the tenth and eleventh centuriesAD.|$|E

Victoria {{had to try to}} stave off defeat <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> trouble when Illingworth came in to bat, partnering captain Bill Lawry after wicket-keeper Ray Jordon was out with the score at 6/193. Illingworth scored his highest {{first-class}} score of 47, putting on a partnership of 87 runs with Lawry before he was dismissed with the score at 7/280. Victoria were 8/286 at the end of play, just 38 runs ahead, as the match ended in a draw.|$|E
5|$|York started 1976–77 poorly, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> {{the bottom}} {{two of the}} Third Division {{for most of the}} first half of the season. The midseason signings Chris Galvin and Gordon Staniforth marked an {{improvement}} in results, but after winning only one of their last 15 matches they finished in bottom place and were relegated for the second successive season. The 1977–78 season also started poorly; York lost seven of their opening 12 matches, leaving them 17th in the table. McGuinness was dismissed in October 1977 and was succeeded the following month by Charlie Wright, a former Charlton Athletic player. York remained in the lower reaches of the table and finished the season in 22nd place, forcing the club to apply for re-election for the sixth time. This was successful, as the club polled the maximum number of votes. This season, attendances fell to an all-time low, and amid growing financial trouble, Michael Sinclair took over as chairman in April 1978 in a boardroom shuffle. Results improved in 1978–79; York finished 10th in the Fourth Division and reached the FA Cup fourth round. They played reigning First Division champions and European Cup winners-elect Nottingham Forest, and were beaten 3–1 at the City Ground. In 1979–80, York were consistently in the lower reaches of the table, before finishing 17th. With the club 18th in the table by mid March 1980, Wright was dismissed. Youth coach Barry Lyons succeeded him, initially as caretaker manager, before being appointed permanently in May 1980.|$|E

The British and French were also active in the region now known as Kerala, the former from 1615 and the latter from 1725. These various European powers combined with one or another of the Nair rulers, fighting for control. One notable alliance was that of the Portuguese with the Kingdom of Cochin, with whom they sided in order to work against the power of the Zamorins of Calicut. Although Calicut remained the most significant of the kingdoms until the 1730s, its power was eroded and the rulers of Cochin were freed from being vassals of the Zamorins.|$|E
