5|$|I <b>am</b> <b>at</b> first {{inclined}} to agree... But on re-reading the whole Ode, this line {{strikes me as}} a serious blemish on a beautiful poem, and the reason must be either that I fail to understand it, or that it is a statement which is untrue. And I suppose that Keats meant something by it, however remote his truth and his beauty may have been from these words in ordinary use. And I am sure that he would have repudiated any explanation of the line which called it a pseudo-statement... The statement of Keats seems to me meaningless: or perhaps {{the fact that it is}} grammatically meaningless conceals another meaning from me.|$|E
5|$|The PVA 38th Corps, on {{the other}} hand, was marching towards the Kunu-ri—Sunchon road {{virtually}} unopposed. On 7 <b>a.m.</b> <b>at</b> November 28, the PVA 113th Division of the 38th Corps occupied the town of Samo-ri, placing it right {{in the path of}} the 5th Cavalry Regiment and besides the Kunu-ri—Sunchon road. An hour and half later, the advance platoon from the 5th Cavalry Regiment was ambushed and destroyed. With its advance blocked, the 5th Cavalry Regiment tried to dislodge the Chinese garrison, but it was forced to turn back by the afternoon. The 113th Division then occupied the valley containing the Kunu-ri—Sunchon road at that night and blocked the retreat route of the US 2nd Infantry Division. Upon receiving the news on November 29, 1st Battalion, Middlesex Regiment, part of 27th Brigade, tried to clear the valley from the south, but the attack was halted due to the lack of heavy weapons.|$|E

25|$|The {{broadcast}} or {{transport channel}} for TV {{in countries that}} use NTSC or ATSC has a bandwidth of 6MHz. To conserve bandwidth, SSB would be desirable, but the video signal has significant low-frequency content (average brightness) and has rectangular synchronising pulses. The engineering compromise is vestigial-sideband transmission. In vestigial sideband, the full upper sideband of bandwidth W2 = 4.75MHz is transmitted, but only W1 = 1.25MHz of the lower sideband is transmitted, along with a carrier. This effectively makes the system <b>AM</b> <b>at</b> low modulation frequencies and SSB at high modulation frequencies. The absence of the lower sideband components at high frequencies must be compensated for, and this {{is done by the}} RF and IF filters.|$|E
