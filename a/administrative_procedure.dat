5|$|To {{summarize}} {{and conclude}} upon this point: Section 3 of the Recovery Act (15 USCA 703) is without precedent. It supplies no standards for any trade, industry, or activity. It does not undertake to prescribe {{rules of conduct}} {{to be applied to}} particular states of fact determined by appropriate <b>administrative</b> <b>procedure.</b> Instead of prescribing rules of conduct, it authorizes the making of codes to prescribe them. For that legislative undertaking, section 3 sets up no standards, aside from the statement of the general aims of rehabilitation, correction, and expansion described in section 1. In view of the scope of that broad declaration and {{of the nature of the}} few restrictions that are imposed, the discretion of the President in approving or prescribing codes, and thus enacting laws for the government of trade and industry throughout the country, is virtually unfettered. We think that the code-making authority thus conferred is an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power.|$|E

In this paper we has analyzed the ontology annotation aimed to provide the groundwork for automatic generation administrative act. The proposed semantic rep-resentation of the <b>administrative</b> <b>procedures</b> enables use of the document templates, which are the framework for the automatic generation of an administrative act. This would be a result of the <b>administrative</b> <b>procedures</b> execution. The proposed approach is verified by a case study of building an ontological model of the <b>administrative</b> <b>procedures</b> for the Guarantee Fund of Autonomous Province of Vojvodina (APV) ...|$|R
25|$|The <b>Administrative</b> <b>Procedure</b> Act is enacted {{to ensure}} that all {{administrative}} acts are carried out in pursuance of a fair, open and democratic process based on the principle of administration by law so as to protect the rights and interest of the people, enhance administrative efficiency and further the people's reliance on administration. <b>Administrative</b> <b>procedure</b> means the procedure to be followed by administrative authorities in performing such acts as rendering administrative dispositions, entering into administrative contracts, establishing legal orders and administrative rules, deciding on administrative plans, employing administrative guidance and dealing with petitions. Administrative authority is an organization representing the State, any local self-governing body or any other subject of administration with an independent legal status, in declaration of its intention and carrying on public affairs. An individual or entity commissioned to exercise public authority shall be deemed to be an administrative authority within the scope of commission (Articles 1–2).|$|E

According to the French Ministry of Justice, Jehovah's Witnesses currently have 111 chaplains for their own service in prison.|$|E

The hearing function includes acting on interlocutory requests filed in the proceedings such as petitions to intervene, petitions to enlarge issues, and contested discovery requests.

25|$|The NLRB recognizes {{a breach}} of the duty of fair {{representation}} {{as a violation of}} the National Labor Relations Act. However, because the duty of fair representation was originally created by judicial interpretation, rather than as an express statutory prohibition, employees covered by the National Labor Relations Act may sue their unions directly, without being required to first exhaust any administrative procedures provided under the National Labor Relations Board. The same is true for workers covered by the Railway Labor Act, which does not provide any <b>administrative</b> <b>procedure</b> for pursuing claims against a union. Employees' claims under either Act are governed by a six-month statute of limitations.|$|E

25|$|In December 2005, the {{bankrupt}} Volare Group (Volareweb, Air Europe) {{was put up}} for sale. Alitalia bid to buy the group (other bidders were Air One and Meridiana/Eurofly). Air One went to court claiming that Alitalia could not buy Volare Group as it had received state aid in the past. The TAR (Regional Administrative Tribunal) of Lazio tried to block Alitalia's acquisition of Volare Group but abandoned the attempt, claiming that Alitalia had repaid its €400 million loan and {{so there would be}} nothing stopping it from buying Volare Group. Air One also went to court, unsuccessfully. Alitalia created Volare SpA to buy the Volare Group. The airlines were becoming closer and Volare Group had started providing soft maintenance services for some Alitalia aircraft in Milan Malpensa airport. However, the Italian Consiglio di Stato (State Council) on 23 May 2006 has once again blocked the acquisition of the airline. It is not clear {{what is going to happen}} as Volare is in serious financial difficulties. On 2 November 2006 TAR court decided that the <b>administrative</b> <b>procedure</b> used by the Italian government to sell Volare to Alitalia was invalid but the selling contract is still valid because the administrative court was declared incompetent about this topic. If Air One wants to obtain Volare it will have to go to the local civil court and ask it to declare that the selling contract is invalid. Alitalia's offer for 38 million euros was the winning bid. On 15 May 2006 the former Volare Group employees were transferred to Volare SpA (the Alitalia subsidiary).|$|E
500|$|Members of {{the hearing}} panel met with Robb prior to the hearing to review the {{contents}} of Oppenheimer's FBI file.

500|$|HUD {{tried again}} to {{implement}} a regulatory prohibition of seller-funded down payments when it re-proposed, in May 2007, its failed 1999 proposal. [...] There were some 15,000 comments from the public, the majority of which were brief statements of opposition written [...] "in a standard similar format and wording". [...] While the period for public comment was still open, the Committee on Financial Services held a hearing on down payment assistance, a primary topic at which was the HUD proposal. [...] Nehemiah's president gave testimony at this hearing, saying [...] "mend it, don't end it" [...] and, in a written statement, adding that the proposal [...] "makes no sense as rational behavior or measured action". [...] In October 2007, HUD pronounced its proposed change as [...] "final", meaning that it now would be implemented, with an effective date of October 31, 2007. [...] However, Nehemiah sued HUD in a federal district court, citing violations of the <b>Administrative</b> <b>Procedure</b> Act. [...] In particular, Nehemiah alleged that (i) HUD failed to provide a [...] "reasoned analysis" [...] for its change in policy, (ii) HUD ignored reasonable alternatives (such as charging mortgage-insurance premiums that varied according {{to the risk of}} default), (iii) HUD relied on data that was not provided to the public, and (iv) HUD's secretary (Alphonso Jackson) had prejudged the outcome before all public comments had been received. [...] At about the same time, another provider of seller-funded down-payment assistance (AmeriDream) filed a similar action in a different court. [...] On October 31, that other court issued a temporary order barring HUD from implementing the regulation until a final disposition had been reached. [...] The court in Nehemiah issued its final ruling in February 2008, finding that Nehemiah prevailed on some (but not all) of its allegations. [...] The court ordered HUD to vacate the regulation.|$|E
