5000|$|Other proponents, like Mill, argue <b>a</b> <b>qualitative</b> <b>approach.</b> Mill {{believed}} {{that there can be}} different levels of pleasure - higher quality pleasure is better than lower quality pleasure. Mill also argues that simpler beings (he often refers to pigs) have an easier access to the simpler pleasures; since they do not see other aspects of life, they can simply indulge in their lower pleasures. The more elaborate beings tend to spend more thought on other matters and hence lessen the time for simple pleasure. It is therefore more difficult for them to indulge in such [...] "simple pleasures" [...] in the same manner.|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{demonstrate}} that, theoretically, <b>a</b> <b>qualitative</b> {{case study}} <b>approach</b> holds substantial promise for {{conducting research on}} caregiver involvement in inpatient traumatic brain injury (TBI) rehabilitation. Methods: Narrative reviews of the TBI rehabilitation and case study literature are presented to explain our rationale for advocating the use of <b>a</b> <b>qualitative</b> case study <b>approach</b> for research in this area. Results: We found that there are four interconnected reasons why this research approach is well suited for investigating caregiver involvement in inpatient TBI rehabilitation. More specifically, <b>a</b> <b>qualitative</b> case study <b>approach</b> allows us to: (a) address the context of inpatient TBI rehabilitation; (b) account for the complexity of caregiver involvement; (c) adapt research to the practical and ethical needs of TBI inpatients and their caregivers; and (d) create research that is congruent with family-centered theory. Conclusion: <b>A</b> <b>qualitative</b> case study <b>approach</b> {{has the ability to}} address the complexity and context that surrounds caregiver involvement in inpatient TBI rehabilitation. A case study approach is also congruent with the characteristics of inpatient rehabilitation settings and can take into consideration family-centered theory, which is instrumental to understanding caregiver involvement...|$|R

5000|$|Bender {{had been}} skilled in depth {{psychology}} and oriented himself mostly by approaches of Pierre Janet and Carl Gustav Jung. From this, {{it follows that}} on the one hand, he used mostly <b>a</b> <b>qualitative</b> <b>approach</b> instead of a quantitative one. On the other hand, he held an [...] "animistic" [...] approach in parapsychology instead of a [...] "spiritualistic" [...] one. In parapsychology this means that paranormal phenomena were not treated as influences of spirits, {{but as a result}} of the great strain of the [...] "focus person". Because of this approach concerning parapsychological phenomena, he associated the experiments of a sensitive approach with the analysis of an affective approach to parapsychology and neurotic faulty attitudes.|$|E
5000|$|While {{there is}} no {{statistical}} or empirical evidence that suggests Heisman winners underperform compared to other high-profile collegiate players, some [...] try to explain {{the perception of the}} curse by reference to trends regarding voter selections. Some see the trend going back decades to other players, but it has most famously been observed since the 1990s. The accepted logical explanation for the discrepancy between success and failure of Heisman winners is that the people who pick the Heisman are sportswriters and former Heisman winners. This might mean that they vote for a winner based on reputation, without seeing him or really studying him, basically <b>a</b> <b>qualitative</b> <b>approach.</b> On the other hand, the people who pick players for the NFL are talent evaluators.

This package {{supports}} {{the representation of}} models where anin-depth knowledge of the biochemical reactions and their kinetics is missingand <b>a</b> <b>qualitative</b> <b>approach</b> must be used. Examples of phenomena that havebeen modeled in this way include gene regulatory networks and signalling pathways, basing the model structure onthe definition of regulatory or influence graphs. The definition and use ofsome components of this class of models differ from the way that species andreactions are defined and used in core SBML models. For example,qualitative models typically associate discrete levels of activities withentity pools; consequently, the processes involving them cannot be describedas reactions per se, but rather as transitions between states. These systemscan be viewed as reactive systems whose dynamics are represented by means ofstate transition graphs (or other Kripke structures [...] ) inwhich the nodes are the reachable states and the edges are the statetransitions.|$|E

40|$|In this article, {{we suggest}} and discuss <b>a</b> <b>qualitative,</b> multi-methods <b>approach</b> to data {{collected}} on smartphones {{as a way}} of uncovering a user-centred perspective on cross-media communication. As an individualised multimedia device, the smartphone represents a relevant starting point for studying individual users’ cross-media practices. Moreover, the technological affordances of the smartphone, including built-in sensors and GPS tracker as well as features for capturing photo, audio and video material, enable the collection {{of a wide range of}} data. These properties have mainly been approached from a quantitative point of view focusing on automatically logged use data as an alternative to, for instance, survey data. Complementing this evidence, we argue that <b>a</b> <b>qualitative,</b> multiple-method <b>approach</b> to data collected on smartphones provides crucial insight into the contexts and everyday practices of cross-media communication...|$|R
5000|$|Place {{attachment}} is deﬁned as one's {{emotional or}} affective ties to a place, and is generally {{thought to be}} the result of a long-term connection with a certain environment. This is different from a simple aesthetic response such as saying a certain place is special because it is beautiful. For example, one can have an emotional response to a beautiful (or ugly) landscape or place, but this response may sometimes be shallow and ﬂeeting. This distinction is one that Schroeder labeled [...] "meaning versus preference". According to Schroeder the definition of [...] "meaning" [...] is [...] "the thoughts, feelings, memories and interpretations evoked by a landscape"; whereas [...] "preference" [...] is [...] "the degree of liking for one landscape compared to another". For a deeper and lasting emotional attachment to develop (Or in Schroeder's terms, for it to have meaning) an enduring relationship with a place is usually a critical factor. Chigbu carried out a rural study of place-attachment using <b>a</b> <b>qualitative</b> <b>approach</b> to check its impact on a community, Uturu (in Nigeria), and found that it has direct relationship to level of community development.|$|E

The aim {{of this article is}} to discuss the potential benefits of <b>a</b> <b>qualitative</b> descriptive <b>approach,</b> to identify its strengths and weaknesses and to provide examples of use. Discussion <b>Qualitative</b> description is <b>a</b> useful <b>qualitative</b> method in much medical research if you keep the limitations of the approach in mind. It is especially relevant in mixed method research, in questionnaire development and in research projects aiming to gain firsthand knowledge of patients', relatives' or professionals' experiences with a particular topic. Another great advantage of the method is that it is suitable if time or resources are limited. Summary As a consequence of the growth in qualitative research in the health sciences, researchers sometimes feel obliged to designate their work as phenomenology, grounded theory, ethnography or a narrative study when in fact it is not. Qualitative description might be a useful alternative approach to consider. </p...|$|R
