50|$|To Nietzsche {{everything}} in this world {{is an expression of}} will to power. To exist is to represent will to power, to cause influence (compare similar views of Protagoras' disciples in Plato's Theaetetus). One can cause influence only on something that exists. Therefore, (through induction) an act changes everything from that moment onwards. If one thing <b>was</b> <b>otherwise,</b> everything would have to <b>be</b> <b>otherwise</b> (and generally also backwards). Contrary to Chesterton's views, this general rule is not precluded even by absolute chances: they of course change the course of the world too, but still: if one thing <b>was</b> set <b>otherwise,</b> everything would have to <b>be</b> <b>otherwise.</b>|$|R

5|$|As the two <b>are</b> <b>otherwise</b> unattested {{outside of}} Snorri's Prose Edda, {{suggestions}} {{have been made}} that Hjúki and Bil may have been of minor mythic significance, or that they were made up outright by Snorri, while Anne Holtsmark (1945) posits that Snorri may have known or had access to a now lost verse source wherein Hjúki and Bil personified the waxing and waning moon. Holtsmark further theorizes that Bil {{may have been a}} dís (a type of female deity).|$|E
5|$|Aspirin {{is used in}} the {{treatment}} of a number of conditions, including fever, pain, rheumatic fever, and inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, pericarditis, and Kawasaki disease. Lower doses of aspirin have also been shown {{to reduce the risk of}} death from a heart attack, or the risk of stroke in some circumstances. There is some evidence that aspirin is effective at preventing colorectal cancer, though the mechanisms of this effect are unclear. In the United States low dose aspirin is deemed reasonable in those between 50 and 70 years old who have a more than 10% risk of cardiovascular disease and are not at an increased risk of bleeding who <b>are</b> <b>otherwise</b> healthy.|$|E
5|$|Carriage and {{shipment}} of {{some kinds of}} lithium batteries may be prohibited aboard certain types of transportation (particularly aircraft) because of the ability of most types of lithium batteries to fully discharge very rapidly when short-circuited, leading to overheating and possible explosion in a process called thermal runaway. Most consumer lithium batteries have built-in thermal overload protection to prevent this type of incident, or <b>are</b> <b>otherwise</b> designed to limit short-circuit currents. Internal shorts from manufacturing defect or physical damage can lead to spontaneous thermal runaway.|$|E

5|$|Cockatoos {{maintain}} their plumage with frequent preening throughout the day. They remove dirt {{and oil and}} realign feather barbs by nibbling their feathers. They also preen other birds' feathers that <b>are</b> <b>otherwise</b> hard to get at. Cockatoos produce preen-oil from a gland on their lower back and apply it by wiping their plumage with their heads or already oiled feathers. Powder-down is produced by specialised feathers in the lumbar region and distributed by the preening cockatoo all over the plumage.|$|E
5|$|Early in the game, {{the player}} is {{provided}} with a personal data assistant (PDA). PDAs contain security clearance levels, allowing the player to access certain areas that <b>are</b> <b>otherwise</b> locked and off-limits. Additionally, the PDA {{can be used to}} read e-mails and play videos that the player's character acquires during the game. Whenever the player picks up any of the other PDAs found throughout the game, its contents are automatically downloaded to the player's own device. Other PDAs often contain e-mails and audio logs for other characters, which can provide useful information such as storage or door key codes, as well as significant plot details.|$|E
5|$|For {{individuals}} with specific health problems, {{certain forms of}} birth control may require further investigations.

For example, a pelvic exam, breast exam, or blood test before starting birth control pills {{does not appear to}} affect outcomes.

5|$|Frequent {{hand washing}} {{reduces the risk}} of viral spread. Wearing a {{surgical}} mask is also useful. Yearly vaccinations against influenza are recommended by the World Health Organization for those at high risk. The vaccine is usually effective against three or four types of influenza. It is usually well tolerated. A vaccine made for one year may not be useful in the following year, since the virus evolves rapidly. Antiviral drugs such as the neuraminidase inhibitor oseltamivir, among others, have been used to treat influenza. Their benefits in those who <b>are</b> <b>otherwise</b> healthy {{do not appear to be}} greater than their risks. No benefit has been found in those with other health problems.|$|E
5|$|In a 1998 review, {{primatologist}} Marc Godinot recognized Sivaladapidae as {{a separate}} family within the Adapiformes, and this classification has been followed since then. Several genera in addition to Indraloris and Sivaladapis are now allocated to Sivaladapidae, which is known from the Eocene through the Miocene of China, Thailand, Myanmar, India, and Pakistan. Sivaladapids are notable for including by far the youngest adapiforms; {{members of this group}} <b>are</b> <b>otherwise</b> known mostly from the Eocene, but several sivaladapids occurred during the Miocene.|$|E
5|$|In a loose, {{unstructured}} modernist narrative {{style that}} draws from Christian allegory and oral storytelling, Faulkner explores themes of race, sex, class and {{religion in the}} American South. By focusing on characters that are misfits, outcasts, or <b>are</b> <b>otherwise</b> marginalized in their community, he portrays the clash of alienated individuals against a Puritanical, prejudiced rural society. Early reception of the novel was mixed, with some reviewers critical of Faulkner's style and subject matter. However, over time, the novel {{has come to be}} {{considered one of the most}} important literary works by Faulkner and one of the best English-language novels of the 20th century.|$|E
