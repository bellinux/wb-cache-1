40|$|A {{preliminary}} {{investigation of the}} application of two well-known machine learning schemes [...] -C 4. 5 and FOIL [...] -to detection of oestrus in dairy cows has been made. This {{is a problem of}} practical economic significance as each missed opportunity for <b>artificial</b> <b>insemination</b> <b>results</b> in 21 days lost milk production. Classifications were made on normalised deviations of milk volume production and milking order time series data. The best learning scheme was C 4. 5 which was able to detect 69 % of oestrus events, albeit with an unacceptably high rate of "false positives" (74 %). Several directions for further work and improvements are identified. Keywords Machine learning, oestrus detection, dairy cow. 2 1.

40|$|Twenty cattle {{were used}} in this {{experiment}} {{to determine the effect}} of administration follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and pregnant mare serum gonadotrophin (PMSG) hormones on superovulation of Brahman cross cattle. The experiment was designed into completely randomized design with 5 treatments as follows. Treatments 1 (T 1) : 4 mg of FSH was injected twice a day intra-ovary, T 2 : 8 mg of FSH was injected twice a day intra-ovary, T 3 : 300 IU of PMSG was injected single dose intra-ovary, T 4 : 600 IU of PMSG was injected single dose intra-ovary, T 5 : 40 mg of FSH was injected intramuscular. All experimental cattle were oestrus synchronized using 15 mg of PGF 2 α twice at 11 -days intervals. Number of corpus luteum (CL) was detected by rectal palpation at day- 7 after <b>artificial</b> <b>insemination.</b> <b>Results</b> showed that 19 cattle (95 %) indicated oestrus sign. Eleven cattle (57. 9 %) showed oestrus sign 2 days after PGF 2 α injection and the rest 8 cattle (42. 1 %) oestrus sign was detected at 3 days after PGF 2 α injection. FSH and PMSG treatments increased significantly (P< 0. 05) number of CL. The highest CL number was found in T 5, meanwhile number of CL in T 2 and T 4 were higher compared to T 1 and T 3. The average treatment effect could produce 6. 8 ± 5. 42 CL with range 2 – 26 CL.

40|$|Neutrophils ordinarily {{infiltrate}} the female reproductive tract subsequent to mating or <b>artificial</b> <b>insemination,</b> <b>resulting</b> in reduced fertility. Recently, it was demonstrated that equine neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) entangled sperm in these DNA-rich structures, interfering with their normal transport through the female reproductive tract. Seminal plasma (SP) or proteinaceous extracts from SP inhibited sperm-neutrophil binding and specifically degraded sperm-activated NETs, without suppressing bactericidal activity of neutrophils.

40|$|Summary. At any {{one time}} a large {{proportion}} of individually caged, sexually mature female rabbits failed to copulate. Intravenous adminis¬ tration ofpurified pituitary luteinizing hormone (plh) (Armour) produced ovulations in sexually receptive and nonreceptive does alike. Does with histories of infertility ovulated after the injection of plh. The routine administration of 2 - 5 mg of plh to fifty-seven virgin and multi-parous Dutch-Belted does averaging 2 to 3 kg, followed by <b>artificial</b> <b>insemination,</b> <b>resulted</b> in 91 % of the does kindling and 307 young being born. Administration of either 0 - 5 mg or 1 mg of plh per kg to random members of fourteen pairs of does, accompanied by artificial insemina¬ tion, resulted in no difference between the number of ovulations or the number of young per treatment (> 0 · 05).

40|$|Induction of {{ovulation}} with pregnant mare’s serum (PMS) and {{the timing}} of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) injection on chromosomal normality were examined in preimplantation hamster embryos. Two separate experimental trials were done. The first compared superovulation (SO, PMS on Day I of the cycle followed by hCG on Day 4) to natural ovulation. Natural mating was used. In the second series of trials, precocious super-ovulation (PSO, PMS on Day 1 followed by hCG on Day 3) was used. Since there is poor sperm transport in PSO females, direct uterine <b>artificial</b> <b>insemination</b> (Al) was used to achieve fertilization. The control animals in the second series of trials were naturally ovulating females subjected to the <b>artificial</b> <b>insemination</b> procedure. Of 785 embryos analyzed in the SO group, 9 (1. 1 %) were aneuploid (5 hyperploidy and 4 hypoploidy) and 8 (1. 0 %) showed triploidy. In the PSO group, <b>artificial</b> <b>insemination</b> <b>resulted</b> in a normal development rate of 85. 5 % up to the 2 -cell stage. A total of 2. 6 % karyotypically abnormal embryos, consisting of 5 (1. 1 %) aneuploid and 7 (1. 5 %) polyploid, were found among 460 embryos examined in PSO females. No {{significant difference in the}} incidence of chromosomal abnormalities was observed between the stages of development. The overall incidence of chromosomal imbalance in hormonally treated females was not significantly differ-ent from that in controls (2. 2 % in SO cycles vs. 1. 2 % in natural cycles, 2. 6 % in PSO with Al vs. 2. 4 % in natural cycles with Al).

A field study with 231 blue fox females at the beginning of the trial was carried out in a private blue fox farm 2005 - 2006. Young blue fox females were selected for breeding in September (Early group) or late in November (Late group). The females in Early group were fed on a restricted breeder's diet during growing-furring season and before <b>artificial</b> <b>insemination.</b> The females in group Late were fed as ad libitum during growing-furring season and the feeding was strongly restricted after selection for breeding. Commercial fox feed was used and the feed consumption was not registered due to the practical field conditions. The females of the Early group were weighed when selected for breeding, in January and at the time of <b>artificial</b> <b>insemination.</b> The females in group Late were weighed in January, in February and also at the time of <b>artificial</b> <b>insemination.</b> Breeding <b>result</b> (litter size/inseminated female) was calculated when litters were 25 days old. The season for selecting the first year blue fox breeders was important. There was statistically significant difference in the average weight of females between groups in January and at the time of <b>artificial</b> <b>insemination</b> (p< 0. 0001). At insemination time the average weights were 8848 ± 83 g and 11052 ± 158 g in groups Early and Late, respectively. The breeding result was 5. 21 cubs per inseminated female in group Early and 2. 37 cubs per inseminated female in group Late (p< 0. 0001). The selection in early autumn improved the breeding result. The weight of blue fox female at the time of <b>artificial</b> <b>insemination</b> had an effect to the litter size.

40|$|Conservation {{of genetic}} {{resources}} from endangered breeds may be conducted through germinal banks. Preservation of healthy samples is paramount to avoid preserving pathogens shed with germinal products. The black variety of Manchega sheep (BMS), and endangered breed endemic to south-central Spain, {{is the subject}} of a conservation program; a germinal bank has been recently established. However, several pathogens circulating in BMS flocks may be shed with semen and threaten BMS preservation. Therefore, we investigated the sanitary status of BMS flocks and semen samples from 4 of the 17 flocks in which this variety is bred worldwide. A serological screening for Maedi-Visna virus, bluetongue virus, Pestivirus spp., Brucella spp., Coxiella burnetii, Chlamydophila spp., Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex, Mycobacterium avium paratuberculosis, Anaplasma spp., Mycoplasma agalactiae, Toxoplasma gondii and Neospora caninum was performed to assess for pathogens potentially shed by semen. Semen samples from 11 of the 35 BMS rams and 4 samples from coexisting rams of the white variety (WMS) were analyzed by PCR to detect Maedi-Visna virus, C. burnetii, Anaplasma marginale, Anaplasma phagocytophilum and T. gondii. Maedi-Visna virus RNA was detected in 3 semen samples (2 BMS and 1 WMS) while C. burnetii DNA was detected in 3 samples from WMS rams.

The increasing risk of line extinction for sanitary or breeding failure reasons makes clear the need for an efficient method of reproductive cell cryopreservation in this species. However, an efficient method of guinea fowl sperm freezing in secured packaging is still lacking. The aim {{of the present study was}} to develop such a method. Based on results previously obtained in chickens, different cryoprotectants and freezing/thawing processes were tested and then adapted to guinea fowl. Semen quality was measured by semen viability evaluation and then by fertility measured after intravaginal <b>artificial</b> <b>insemination.</b> The best <b>results</b> (70 % fertility with frozen-thawed sperm) were obtained by the use of the permeant cryoprotectant agents dimethyl formamide combined with a freezing rate of 30 °C/min. The initial insemination frequency also affected the fertility results: 2 consecutive days of inseminations were needed in the first week to ensure enough filling of the utero-vaginal glands of the guinea fowl hen and thus to get successive fertile eggs. Thereafter, a 2 -wk insemination frequency was sufficient. This new method, combining biophysical (cryoprotectant agents, freeze/thaw rate) and zootechnical (<b>artificial</b> <b>insemination</b> frequency) features, is the first cryopreservation method successfully developed in secured packaging for guinea fowl sperm.

40|$|In dairy cattle, the {{widespread}} use of <b>artificial</b> <b>insemination</b> has <b>resulted</b> in increased selection intensity, which has led to spectacular increase in productivity. However, cow fertility has concomitantly severely declined. It is generally assumed that this reduction is primarily due to the negative energy balance of high-producing cows at the peak of lactation. We herein describe the fine-mapping of a major fertility QTL in Nordic Red cattle, and identify a 660 -kb deletion encompassing four genes as the causative variant. We show that the deletion is a recessive embryonically lethal mutation. This probably results from the loss of RNASEH 2 B, which is known to cause embryonic death in mice. Despite its dramatic effect on fertility, 13 %, 23 % and 32 % of the animals carry the deletion in Danish, Swedish and Finnish Red Cattle, respectively. To explain this, we searched for favorable effects on other traits and found that the deletion has strong positive effects on milk yield. This study demonstrates that embryonic lethal mutations account for a non-negligible fraction of the decline in fertility of domestic cattle, and that associated positive effects on milk yield may account for part of the negative genetic correlation. Our study adds to the evidence that structural variants contribute to animal phenotypic variation, and that balancing selection migh...|$|R

Early initial inseminations were made on Days 13 and 15 following photostimulation with subsequent <b>artificial</b> <b>insemination</b> (AI) every 7 (EI + 7) or 14 (EI + 14) days. Late initial inseminations were made on Days 20 and 22 postlighting with subsequent AI every 7 (LI + 7) or 14 (LI + 14) days. Percent of egg production, fertility, and hatch of fertile eggs were measured following the initial AI in each treatment. No significant differences in egg production were seen between treatments. Percent of fertility was greatest in Weeks 6 to 20 with 7 -day AI intervals as compared to 14 -day intervals.

40|$|International audienceBackground Low {{birth weight}} and {{postnatal}} growth restriction {{are the most}} evident symptoms of dwarfism. Accompanying skeletal aberrations may compromise the general condition and locomotion of affected individuals. Several paternal half-sibs with a low birth weight and a small size were born in 2013 in the Fleckvieh cattle population. ResultsAffected calves were strikingly underweight at birth {{in spite of a}} normal gestation length and had craniofacial abnormalities such as elongated narrow heads and brachygnathia inferior. In spite of a normal general condition, their growth remained restricted during rearing. We genotyped 27 affected and 10, 454 unaffected animals at 44, 672 single nucleotide polymorphisms and performed association tests followed by homozygosity mapping, which allowed us to map the locus responsible for growth failure to a 1. 85 -Mb segment on bovine chromosome 3. Analysis of whole-genome re-sequencing data from one affected and 289 unaffected animals revealed a 1 -bp deletion (g. 15079217 delC, rs 723240647) in the coding region of the GON 4 L gene that segregated with the dwarfism-associated haplotype. We showed that the deletion induces intron retention and premature termination of translation, which can lead to a severely truncated protein that lacks domains that are likely essential to normal protein function. The widespread use of an undetected carrier bull for <b>artificial</b> <b>insemination</b> has <b>resulted</b> in a tenfold increase in the frequency of the deleterious allele in the female population.
