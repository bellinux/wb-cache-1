50|$|Firstly, {{the vehicle}} is {{reversed}} up to the drawbar of the trailer/dolly, stopping short of hitting. The height of the drawbar is checked, and adjusted accordingly. The safety catch handle on the upper left of the Ringfeder is pulled out and turned 90 degrees, and then allowed to return into the upper detent on the shaft collar. This then allows the actuator handle {{on the right of}} the body to be lifted to the stop. This pulls the bolt upwards, and sets the <b>automatic</b> <b>tripping</b> function. The Ringfeder is now ready to be coupled.|$|E
50|$|The loss {{of control}} room annunciators {{concurrent}} with the plant transient resulting from <b>automatic</b> <b>tripping</b> of the main generator, main turbine, and reactor caused the licensee (Niagara Mohawk) to declare a site area emergency {{in accordance with the}} site emergency plan. The {{loss of control}} rod position indicators and other equipment losses burdened the operators in implementing the emergency procedures. However, the operators shut down the plant in accordance with emergency procedures. About 13 hours after the plant trip, the reactor was placed in a cold shutdown condition; and approximately 1 hour later, the licensee ended the site area emergency.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—We {{consider}} a price signal with two settings: off-peak tariff and on-peak tariff. Some loads {{are connected to}} specific electricity meters which allow the consumption of power only in off-peak periods. Historically, off-peak periods were located during the night and on-peak periods during the day. Changing the assignment of off-peak periods is an easy method for distribution system operators to access to the flexibility of small consumers. This solution can be implemented quickly as the infrastructure needed already exists in some countries. We propose a mixed-integer linear model to assign optimally the off-peak hours so as to minimize a societal cost. This cost gathers together the cost of electricity, the financial losses due to energy curtailments of photovoltaic installations and the loads’ wellbeing. Our model considers <b>automatic</b> <b>tripping</b> of inverters and constraints of the electrical distribution networks. Simulation {{results show that the}} new disposition of off-peak hours could reduce significantly the photovoltaic energy curtailed in the summer.

30|$|In the post-event {{analysis}} of the September 8 th blackout, phase measurement unit (PMU) data proved extremely valuable in constructing {{the sequence of events}} and validating simulation results. However, PMUs did not play a part in observing system behaviors in real time. For instance, tripping of the H–NG line led to the increase of phase angle difference between voltages of the two terminals. Post-event simulation showed that this angle difference exceeded APS’s synchro-check relay setting of 60 degrees and re-dispatch of a significant amount of generation was required to reduce this difference to the acceptable value. Without situational awareness of the real-time value of this phase angle difference, WECC and California Independent System Operator(CAISO)were informed by APS that the line could be quickly reconnected. If PMUs were used to monitor the voltage angle difference between two ends of the tripped line, the time required to reclose the H–NG line would not have been wrongly estimated and WECC probably would have taken action to reduce loading on Path 44 to prevent its <b>automatic</b> <b>tripping.</b>|$|E
