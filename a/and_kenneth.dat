5|$|Although {{very small}} amounts of {{berkelium}} were possibly produced in previous nuclear experiments, it was first intentionally synthesized, isolated and identified in December 1949 by Glenn T.

Similar to the nearly simultaneous discovery of americium (element 95) and curium (element 96) in 1944, the new elements berkelium and californium (element 98) were both produced in 1949–1950.|$|E

5|$|In 1955, Bernard Burke <b>and</b> <b>Kenneth</b> Franklin {{detected}} {{bursts of}} radio signals coming from Jupiter at 22.2MHz. The period of these bursts matched {{the rotation of}} the planet, and they were also able to use this information to refine the rotation rate. Radio bursts from Jupiter were found to come in two forms: long bursts (or L-bursts) lasting up to several seconds, and short bursts (or S-bursts) that had a duration of less than a hundredth of a second.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, Lichtenstein {{reproduced}} masterpieces by Cézanne, Mondrian and Picasso before embarking on the Brushstroke series in 1965.

Lichtenstein was identified with some such modes by critics and found himself linked to both Frank Stella <b>and</b> <b>Kenneth</b> Noland. Brushstrokes was the first element of the Brushstrokes series.|$|E

5|$|William Burdick, Mark Hauswald, <b>and</b> <b>Kenneth</b> Iserson {{have criticized}} the above {{definition}} as oxymoronic, given the international nature of medicine {{and the number of}} physicians working internationally.

5|$|Born in Blackpool, Lancashire, Montalban {{moved to}} London {{in the early}} 1930s, {{immersing}} herself in the city's esoteric subculture, and influenced by Hermeticism she taught herself ceremonial magic. She associated with significant occultists, including Thelemites like Aleister Crowley <b>and</b> <b>Kenneth</b> Grant, and Wiccans like Gerald Gardner and Alex Sanders. From 1933 to 1953 she published articles on astrology and other esoteric topics in the magazine London Life, and from then until her death in the nationally syndicated magazine Prediction. These were accompanied by several booklets on astrology, released {{using a variety of}} different pseudonyms, including Dolores North, Madeline Alvarez and Nina del Luna.|$|E
5|$|Clark Gregg reprises {{his role}} as Coulson from the film series, and is joined by {{principal}} cast members Ming-Na Wen, Brett Dalton, Chloe Bennet, Iain De Caestecker, Elizabeth Henstridge, and Nick Blood.

That month, guest star Lucy Lawless's role was revealed, building hype for her appearance, although her character was always intended to be killed off {{at the end of}} the episode. Other guest stars include Hayley Atwell, Neal McDonough, <b>and</b> <b>Kenneth</b> Choi, reprising their roles from previous MCU projects in a sequence that ties-in with another MCU television series, Agent Carter.

Its {{first meeting}} on June 25, 1942 was {{attended}} by Bush, Styer and Colonels Marshall <b>and</b> <b>Kenneth</b> Nichols. It discussed the acquisition of land for the project's production facilities, which the Army recommended be {{in the vicinity of}} Knoxville, Tennessee, with the Boston firm of Stone & Webster as the project's principal contractor. The meeting on July 30, 1942, was devoted to reviewing progress on isotope separation by the centrifugal and gaseous diffusion methods. The August 26, 1942, meeting considered Lawrence's electromagnetic separation project, and expansion of the program to produce heavy water.|$|E
5|$|First officially {{described}} by Carl Linnaeus in his 1753 Species Plantarum, Hydnum repandum was sanctioned by Elias Fries in 1821. The species has been shuffled to several genera: Hypothele by Jean-Jacques Paulet in 1812; Dentinum by Samuel Frederick Gray in 1821; Tyrodon by Petter Karsten in 1881 Sarcodon by Lucien Quélet in 1886. After a 1977 nomenclatural proposal by mycologist Ronald H. Petersen was accepted, Hydnum repandum became the official type {{species of the}} genus Hydnum. Previously, supporting arguments for making H.repandum the type were made by Marinus Anton Donk (1958) and Petersen (1973), while Zdeněk Pouzar (1958) <b>and</b> <b>Kenneth</b> Harrison (1971) thought that H.imbricatum should be the type.|$|E
5|$|In 1964 he <b>and</b> <b>Kenneth</b> Adam {{initiated}} the new anthology series The Wednesday Play, a BBC equivalent of Armchair Theatre, which had great success and critical acclaim with plays {{written and directed}} by the likes of Dennis Potter, Jeremy Sandford and Ken Loach. The strand attracted comment and debate for several of its productions, such as Cathy Come Home, a Tony Garnett production of a Jeremy Sandford script, which dealt with the issue of homelessness. There were also problems caused by Newman bringing in freelance directors to work on the programme, who sometimes overspent on their plays to try and increase their impact; with staff directors this could be compensated by reducing the budget of a subsequent production, but for a freelancer there would be no such recourse.|$|E
