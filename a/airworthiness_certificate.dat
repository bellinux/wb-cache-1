5|$|The {{flight test}} program was {{hampered}} by {{problems with the}} 747's JT9D engines. Difficulties included engine stalls caused by rapid throttle movements and distortion of the turbine casings after {{a short period of}} service. The problems delayed 747 deliveries for several months; up to 20 aircraft at the Everett plant were stranded while awaiting engine installation. The program was further delayed when one of the five test aircraft suffered serious damage during a landing attempt at Renton Municipal Airport, site of the company's Renton factory. On December 13, 1969 a test aircraft was being taken to have test equipment removed and a cabin installed when pilot Ralph C. Cokely undershot the airport's short runway. The 747's right, outer landing gear was torn off and two engine nacelles were damaged. However, these difficulties did not prevent Boeing from taking a test aircraft to the 28th Paris Air Show in mid-1969, where it was displayed to the public for the first time. The 747 received its FAA <b>airworthiness</b> <b>certificate</b> in December 1969, clearing it for introduction into service.|$|E

25|$|The first prototype, {{powered by}} a {{two-cylinder}} horizontally opposed engine, flew in 1919, receiving its <b>Airworthiness</b> <b>Certificate</b> in December that year. Production aircraft were {{powered by a}} six-cylinder Anzani air-cooled radial, and four more aircraft followed before Austin abandoned aircraft production in 1920, when it realised that the postwar depression was severely limiting aircraft sales.|$|E
25|$|The first Model 80, {{powered by}} three Pratt & Whitney Wasp radial engines, flew on July 27, 1928. It was {{followed}} by three more Model 80s before production switched to the improved Model 80A, which was longer, allowing 18 passengers to be carried, and was powered by more powerful Pratt & Whitney Hornet engines, first flying on July 18, 1929 and receiving its <b>airworthiness</b> <b>certificate</b> on August 20, 1929.|$|E
25|$|The first prototype, {{with the}} {{military}} designation YC-95, was flown on 26 October 1968. and two other prototypes were built, known as EMB 100. By 1969 an order was placed for 80 production aircraft, by now known as EMB 110 Bandeirante, for the Brazilian Air Force (FAB) with the newly formed aircraft company Embraer. The Bandeirante received its Brazilian <b>airworthiness</b> <b>certificate</b> {{at the end of}} 1972. and on 9 February 1973 was made the first delivery to FAB.|$|E

The CAA, however, maintained {{that it did not}} issue any airline license or <b>airworthiness</b> <b>certificate</b> under political pressure, however it did announce that the Bhoja Air engineers were not qualified to issue the air worthiness certificate.|$|E
25|$|In May 1974, an <b>airworthiness</b> <b>certificate</b> for the Corvette {{was awarded}} by French authorities. However, {{deliveries}} were delayed until early 1974, partially {{as a result}} of industrial action at engine manufacturer United Aircraft of Canada. In response to the lack of deliveries, Air Center Inc. sued Aérospatiale for non-performance, having only received a single non-certified demonstrator aircraft out of a contracted fleet of 70 production Corvettes which had been due to be delivered by May 1974. Ultimately, only six new Corvettes would be dispatched to Oklahoma, {{and there would be no}} sales of the type during or after 1975; in March 1976, the U.S. marketing programme was terminated by Aérospatiale.|$|E
25|$|On 28 April 2017 the AIBN {{released}} a new preliminary report {{with an update}} of the investigation progress {{one year after the}} accident. In this report they stated that the accident was a result of a fatigue fracture in one of the eight second stage planet gears in the epicyclic module of the main rotor gearbox and that the crack initiation appeared to be a surface micro-pit. The origin of the micro-pit was considered unknown at the time when the report was published. Also unknown is whether the fracture occurred momentarily or over several flight hours, and whether fracture fragments were spalled for detection by maintenance systems as happened in G-REDL. The issue is related to the <b>airworthiness</b> <b>certificate</b> of the aircraft.|$|E

Although delivered in 2001, the Mk3 could not receive <b>airworthiness</b> <b>certificates</b> as {{it was not possible}} to certify the avionics software.|$|R
500|$|In {{the final}} car chase scene, the {{production}} actually dropped a Ford Pinto, representing the one {{driven by the}} [...] "Illinois Nazis", from a helicopter {{at an altitude of}} about 1,200 feet—and had to gain a Special <b>Airworthiness</b> <b>Certificate</b> from the Federal Aviation Administration to do it. The FAA was concerned that the car could prove too aerodynamic in a high-altitude drop, and pose a threat to nearby buildings. The shot leading up to the car drop, where the [...] "Illinois Nazis" [...] drive off a freeway ramp, was shot in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, near the Hoan Bridge on Interstate 794. The Lake Freeway (North) was a planned but not completed six-lane freeway, and I-794 contained an unfinished ramp off which the Nazis drove. Several Milwaukee skyscrapers are visible in the background as the Bluesmobile flips over, notably the U.S. Bank Center.|$|E

2500|$|The {{aircraft}} {{involved in}} the accident was an Embraer EMB 120 Brasilia (registration number N270AS), manufactured on November 30, 1990. It was equipped with two Pratt & Whitney PW-118 engines and Hamilton Standard 14RF-9 propellers. The airplane received its U.S. standard <b>airworthiness</b> <b>certificate</b> on December 20, 1990. The aircraft had accumulated about 1,000 flying hours prior to the accident. Only one deferred maintenance item was noted in the maintenance logs. This was for fuel leaking from the auxiliary power unit cowling. The circuit breaker for the APU had been pulled while spare parts could {{be made available to}} fix the cowling. [...] Because they were not required at the time, the aircraft did not have a Cockpit Voice Recorder or Flight Data Recorder.|$|E
2500|$|The Jaguar-engined first prototype, {{registered}} as G-ABEZ [...] flew on 22 January 1931, piloted by Cyril Uwins. It flew under the experimental registration R-3 during 1931 and received its <b>airworthiness</b> <b>certificate</b> that December. A planned Baltic sales tour was disrupted by disputes over engine-manufacturing licensing rights. In the meantime Air Ministry {{interest in the}} Type 118 had increased and they hired [...] "R-3", now powered by a Mercury V, fitted with a four-blade propeller and stripped of armament for endurance and desert trials (in Iraq) of that engine from February 1932. During this time, the Type 118 wore RAF markings with the serial number K2873. After these trials, this aircraft returned to Filton and was stored until April 1935 when it {{was used as a}} testbed for the engine that became the two-speed supercharged Bristol Pegasus XVII.|$|E
2500|$|The {{majority}} of An-8s built {{served in the}} Soviet Air Forces, with two An-8s being used to land special forces to seize Plzeň airport during the Invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968.

[...] They continued in large-scale use on frontline military duties in the Soviet Air Force until the 1970s, when many were later transferred to Aeroflot for use as freighters. [...] Following a series of accidents in the early 1990s, the An-8 was withdrawn from use in Russia. This did not {{mean the end of}} the An-8, however, as a number were sold overseas with a few aircraft observed flying in the Middle East, and until recently, in Africa, (particularly Liberia), DR Congo and Angola, (especially airlines associated with the Russian businessman and alleged arms dealer Viktor Bout), despite Antonov having withdrawn the <b>airworthiness</b> <b>certificate</b> and support for the type in 2004, ending legal use of the aircraft.|$|E
