5|$|Casualties in {{the battle}} <b>are</b> <b>notoriously</b> hard to {{calculate}} exactly. With only one exception (Scipion), records made by the French captains of their losses at the time are incomplete. The only immediately available casualty counts are the sketchy reports of Saint-André and the records made by British officers aboard the captured ships, neither {{of which can be}} treated as completely reliable. Most sources accept that French casualties in the campaign numbered approximately 7,000, including around 3,000captured, but these figures are vague and frequently do not agree with each other on details. British casualties are easier to confirm but here, too, there are some discrepancies; overall British casualties are generally given as around 1,200.|$|E
5|$|The https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulabi_Gang in India. They wear pink saris {{and carry}} lathis (bamboo staves) for {{protection}} against physical attack. They punish abusive husbands, publicly shaming and sometimes beating them. They also {{watch out for}} and expose dowry beatings, dowry death, rape, child marriages, desertion, depriving girls of education, child molestation, and sexual harassment. They have invaded police stations to demand that police investigate these matters, {{and other things that}} affect the community such as corruption. India’s police <b>are</b> <b>notoriously</b> corrupt and sometimes only the threat of a full-scale female riot will get them to act.|$|E
5|$|A few spider {{species that}} build webs live {{together}} in large colonies and show social behavior, although not as complex as in social insects. Anelosimus eximius (in the family Theridiidae) can form colonies of up to 50,000 individuals. The genus Anelosimus has a strong tendency towards sociality: all known American species are social, and species in Madagascar are at least somewhat social. Members of other species {{in the same family}} but several different genera have independently developed social behavior. For example, although Theridion nigroannulatum belongs to a genus with no other social species, T. nigroannulatum build colonies that may contain several thousand individuals that co-operate in prey capture and share food. Other communal spiders include several Philoponella species (family Uloboridae), Agelena consociata (family Agelenidae) and Mallos gregalis (family Dictynidae). Social predatory spiders need to defend their prey against kleptoparasites ("thieves"), and larger colonies are more successful in this. The herbivorous spider Bagheera kiplingi lives in small colonies which help to protect eggs and spiderlings. Even widow spiders (genus Latrodectus), which <b>are</b> <b>notoriously</b> cannibalistic, have formed small colonies in captivity, sharing webs and feeding together.|$|E

Yorkers are best used to surprise a batsman who has become accustomed to hitting shorter-pitched balls and not with the bat speed necessary to defend against a yorker. As such, a yorker is frequently bowled quickly to give the batsman less time to react and position his bat.|$|E

Wearing the black and gold livery of John Player & Sons, Lotus' F1 sponsor at the time, these cars were known as the Commemorative Edition Esprits. They were mechanically identical to the regular 2.0L S2. According to Lotus a series of 300 was built, but it is likely the total was considerably lower. Lotus' production records <b>are</b> <b>notoriously</b> vague, but reliable estimates suggest that 149 Commemorative Esprits were made.|$|E

25|$|Although {{statistics}} of the Soviet economy <b>are</b> <b>notoriously</b> unreliable and its economic growth difficult to estimate precisely, by most accounts, the economy continued to expand until the mid-1980s.

However, after 1970, the growth, while still positive, steadily declined much more quickly and consistently than in other countries despite a rapid increase in the capital stock (the rate of increase in capital was only surpassed by Japan).|$|E
25|$|The live {{rock with}} mantis shrimp burrows are {{actually}} considered useful by {{some in the}} marine aquarium trade and are often collected. It {{is not uncommon for}} a piece of live rock to convey a live mantis shrimp into an aquarium. Once inside the tank, they may feed on fish and other inhabitants.
