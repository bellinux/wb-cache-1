The organization can and should use that potential, which, <b>as</b> <b>empirical</b> <b>research</b> <b>shows,</b> is not a rule. An attempt has been made to demonstrate which internal factors are significant barriers to the development of innovative attitudes and behaviours of employees. The focus was on management issues.

40|$|The traffic {{performance}} of a roundabout depends on {{the accuracy of the}} capacity models used for its design and analysis. However, the inconsistencies among the inputs for various existing models suggest that our understanding of the variables which impact on roundabout capacity remains limited. This paper thus presents the results of an investigation into the impact on entry capacity of the flows exiting on the same arm as the subject entry, <b>as</b> recent <b>empirical</b> <b>research</b> <b>showed</b> that this variable could explain more variation in entry capacity than other more commonly-used variables. Microscopic simulation models were developed for three entries of different-sized roundabouts, calibrated using ground-truth capacity data and follow-on headways. Experimental investigations revealed piecewise linear relationships between separation and capacity, which affected the direction and magnitude of the effect of exiting flows on capacity. At low separation distances, inhibitory effects (where the inability of entering drivers to distinguish circulating vehicles from exiting vehicles leads them to inadvertently reject acceptable gaps either wholly or partially) dominated and resulted in negative impacts by exiting flow. However, at separation distances larger than a critical distance threshold, exiting flows had near-linear positive relationship with entry capacity, arising possibly from their correlation with the proportion of circulating vehicles originating from the first entry immediately upstream. A new model was hypothesised based on these observations, and regressed on a large set of recent field data. The resulting new nonlinear regression model was found to perform well and provided a better explanation for the impacts of separation and exiting flow compared to those developed for the same dataset in a preceding study. By enabling {{a better understanding of the}} impacts of separation and exiting flow on capacity, this study hopes to contribute towards the development of improved roundabout capacity models...|$|R
40|$|When Belgian voters go to {{the polling}} booth on {{election}} day, they are presented {{with a set of}} candidate lists of different political parties. Voters know that they can either cast a list vote, which implies that they endorse the party list in its entirety, or they can cast an individual preferential vote for one or several candidates from the same list. What most voters are unaware of, however, is the amount of effort and preparation that political parties have invested in drafting those candidate lists and selecting candidates, long before election day. In list proportional systems such as Belgium, party selectorates are inclined to carefully balance their lists in terms of various candidate characteristics, in order to include candidates from all social groups. There are both electoral and organizational incentives to balance the ticket. From the electoral perspective, the exclusion of any major social group could signal discrimination, which discourages voters and could result into an electoral setback. From the organizational perspective, balancing the ticket decreases the chances of internal conflicts between the various party factions. While previous research has traditionally focused on the gender and ethnic dimensions of the candidate selection process, this dissertation examines the geographical aspect of ticket-balancing. In Belgium, but also in other list proportional systems worldwide, parties {{go out of their way}} to select candidates from all regions, municipalities or other localities within the electoral district. This is an intriguing observation, <b>as</b> <b>empirical</b> <b>research</b> <b>shows</b> that elections are becoming increasingly nationalized and homogenized and the role of the local seems to have diminished over time. Based on the case of the Belgian Lower House elections between 1987 and 2010, this dissertation aims to tackle this research problem and examines how and why political parties geographically balance their ticket. How important are local and geographical candidate characteristics for parties, vis-à-vis other candidate characteristics? Which intraparty mechanism are at work to realize geographical representation on party lists? What impact does geographical representation have on the electoral result? And do political parties develop a clear strategy with regard to geographical representation, for instance in response to electoral losses in some districts or local areas? Chapter 2 presents a descriptive analysis of the place of residence of Belgian parliamentary candidates, and shows that the share of small municipality candidates has systematically decreased over the years. The analysis also shows that the number of represented municipalities on party lists decreased, possibly as a result of the consecutive electoral district reforms that took place in Belgium during the period of investigation. Chapter 3 and 4 focus on the importance of local candidate characteristics as candidate nomination criteria and electoral assets. The results suggest that political parties especially nominate local mayors, incumbents and party employees for realistic list positions, and that candidates from larger municipalities and cities are more often assigned to these attractive positions. Moreover, for marginal positions party selectorates look for local office holders from larger municipalities. With regard to election results, a multilevel analysis shows that municipality size in itself does not have a significant effect on the number of preferential votes, but the expected interaction between local office and municipality size (which was also found in Chapter 3) was confirmed. This implies that the electoral advantage of holding a local office increases with one’s municipality size in the district. These findings show that local office holders, and especially local-office holders in large cities, dominate intra-party competition (both in terms of candidate selection as election results). With regard to the determinants of geographical representation, the empirical analysis in Chapter 5 has shown that especially the level of decentralization in candidate selection processes plays the decisive role. If local party branches are allowed to participate, a more balanced representation of municipalities within the district is reached. Although the analysis in Chapter 6 suggests that geographical dispersion in itself does not lead to electoral victories, geographical representation on candidate lists can be an important antidote for intraparty turmoil. From the individual politician’s perspective, this dissertation demonstrates the added value of combining parliamentary office with local office, as a ‘cumul des mandats’ provides a career insurance for national politicians and gives them a head start in intraparty candidate selection and electoral competition. From the political party perspective, it seems that investing in local elections and local party branches still pays off as both the aggregate list result as the individual results of party candidates are strongly determined by local roots. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The studies {{carried out}} on {{disclosure}} {{in the last two}} decades have created great interest in the narrative section of corporate reporting. However, despite the undoubted effects of disclosure on the efficiency of the capital markets, <b>as</b> <b>empirical</b> <b>research</b> has <b>shown,</b> the significant increase in information in corporate reporting and the lack of adequate regulation have contributed to incrementing the complexity, subjectivity and unreliability of disclosure. There is a strong consensus in the financial community on the essential role of disclosure in corporate financial reports, with the result that many standard setters have increased their efforts to develop a framework for disclosures. Among others, in July 2012, the European Financial Reporting Advisory Group published a Discussion Paper, “Towards a Disclosure Framework for Notes”, and in October 2012, the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) published the Discussion Paper “Thinking about disclosure in a broader context” that aimed to address the underlying principles and content of corporate disclosure to assist standard setters in developing disclosure requirements on a more consistent basis using a set of agreed principles. From an interpretative and critical perspective of qualitative analysis, this paper examines the main characteristics of the two kinds of disclosure and compares them in order to verify how they fit in with the necessity to rationalize and simplify the current disclosure regime and to create a Framework that may lead to an equilibrium between costs/benefits and providing entity-specific information/comparability. The analysis presented here is supported by an examination of the vast literature on the subject with the aim of highlighting how the two papers in question respond to the issues arising from studies on disclosure. The results of the analysis show that the two Disclosure Frameworks apply different approaches with few similarities. This situation could create various initiatives that complicate the debate on disclosure framework and the identification of disclosure requirements on a more consistent basis of agreed principles. Additionally, the critical analysis underlines the gap between the EFRAG and FRC discussion papers and the features of high quality disclosure identified by the main studies on disclosure. Finally, it presents some reflections about the identification of the key principles for a better disclosure such as user’s needs, placement criteria, materiality and comparability starting from the Conceptual Framework of financial statement. This paper encourages debate on the narrative part of the financial statement and the importance of finding a framework for disclosure that would eliminate the tendency to present a boilerplate lacking in relevance and comparability...|$|R
