5|$|After the {{nationalisation}} of British Rail in 1948, Marylebone {{was initially}} kept open as <b>a</b> <b>long-distance</b> station.

5|$|Often, the {{migration}} route of <b>a</b> <b>long-distance</b> migrator bird doesn't follow {{a straight line}} between breeding and wintering grounds. Rather, it could follow a hooked or arched line, with detours around geographical barriers. For most land-birds, such barriers could consist in seas, large water bodies or high mountain ranges, {{because of the lack}} of stopover or feeding sites, or the lack of thermal columns for broad-winged birds.|$|E

5|$|Amtrak {{rebuilt the}} cafes into {{numerous}} configurations during the 1980s and 1990s. These included all-table dinettes, club cars {{for use in}} Metroliner service, and club-dinettes {{with a mix of}} tables and club seats. By the 2010s most cafes were configured as club-dinettes; some had been converted into all-table dinettes. Five dinettes were rebuilt for use on the Inter-American, <b>a</b> <b>long-distance</b> train operating between Texas and St. Louis, Missouri; lounge seats replaced the coach seats. 21 dinettes were also refurbished for Metroliner service. By the 2010s all the remaining dinettes were rebuilt with all-table seating, save two which were converted into short-distance coaches.|$|E
5|$|Chrysippus, {{the son of}} Apollonius of Tarsus, {{was born}} at Soli, Cilicia. He was slight in stature, and is reputed to have trained as <b>a</b> <b>long-distance</b> runner. While still young, he lost his {{substantial}} inherited property when it was confiscated to the king's treasury. Chrysippus moved to Athens, where he became the disciple of Cleanthes, {{who was then the}} head (scholarch) of the Stoic school. He is believed to have attended the courses of Arcesilaus and his successor Lacydes, in the Platonic Academy.|$|E

5|$|The immensely {{complex and}} ambitious F-111 design and {{construction}} process forced the Australian government to quickly adopt sophisticated American procurement and project management methods. Although Australia originally planned to buy the American F-111A design, RAAF liaison officers requested country-specific changes such as <b>a</b> <b>long-distance</b> radio, Aeronautical Research Laboratories in Melbourne participated in an intake redesign and provided metal fatigue expertise, and an Australian test pilot evaluated the Australian version's longer wings and performance in tropical conditions. The differences from the F-111A caused it to be designated the F-111C in 1966.|$|E

5|$|A second bid to the Heritage Lottery Fund for the {{connection}} from Stonehouse to the Gloucester and Sharpness Canal at Saul was rejected in 2007. This section presents some engineering challenges, {{as it was}} severed by {{the construction of the}} M5 motorway and the A38 road. The roundabout where the A38 joins the A419 road was built over Bristol Road Lock, and part of the route was destroyed by flood relief work for the River Frome. At Stonehouse, the bridge carrying the Bristol and Gloucester Railway {{has been replaced by a}} culvert, but a bid has been made to the newly formed Gloucestershire Local Transport Board for its reinstatement, and to create <b>a</b> <b>long-distance</b> footpath along the route. Outside of the main restoration, the Cotswold Canals Trust are gradually restoring many of the other structures, with the ultimate goal of re-opening a link between the River Thames and the River Severn.|$|E
5|$|Club flying {{started in}} November 1927 with the East Kent Flying Club and {{although}} membership reached 220 by 1931 {{the club was}} struggling financially. On 1 January 1932 it became part of Brooklands Aviation and was renamed as the Cinque Ports Flying Club. Lympne was visited by many aviation personalities. Ken Waller learnt to fly at Lympne and became <b>a</b> <b>long-distance</b> and race pilot. W. E. Davis was the secretary/manager of Cinque Ports Flying Club from 1932 {{until his death in}} 1938. His wife Ann took over the position in the 18 {{months leading up to the}} Second World War. On 22 May 1937 the Duke and Duchess of Kent visited Lympne in an Airspeed Envoy (G-AEXX) of the King's Flight while visiting Shorncliffe Barracks. From 1938 the club participated in the Civil Air Guard training programme, giving subsidised flying lessons. The Currie Wot was designed and built at Lympne. The Cinque Ports Flying Club restarted after the war but folded on 1 October 1948.|$|E
5|$|Digital: A Love Story is {{a visual}} novel, or {{interactive}} fiction game, where the game's {{story is told}} primarily through text. The game is presented {{as if on a}} computer from the late 1980s running the Amie operating system (the name and visual appearance a reference to 1.x versions of AmigaOS). The player logs into bulletin board systems, or BBSs, where they read and reply to messages from other people. Messages received from other characters in the game are displayed through a different program on the computer screen. Accessing a BBS requires the knowledge of the telephone number for that board, which the player must type in manually. Boards that require <b>a</b> <b>long-distance</b> telephone number to reach require the player to use illegally obtained long-distance calling card numbers found online. Accessing boards also requires the player to either set up a user account for that board or to know the password necessary to enter the system.|$|E

5|$|Each year, some East African {{populations of}} blue {{wildebeest}} have <b>a</b> <b>long-distance</b> migration, seemingly timed {{to coincide with}} the annual pattern of rainfall and grass growth. The timing of their migrations in both the rainy and dry seasons can vary considerably (by months) from year to year. At the end of the wet season (May or June in East Africa), wildebeest migrate to dry-season areas in response to a lack of surface (drinking) water. When the rainy season begins again (months later), animals quickly move back to their wet-season ranges. Factors suspected to affect migration include food abundance, surface water availability, predators, and phosphorus content in grasses. Phosphorus is a crucial element for all life forms, particularly for lactating female bovids. As a result, during the rainy season, wildebeest select grazing areas that contain particularly high phosphorus levels. One study found, in addition to phosphorus, wildebeest select ranges containing grass with relatively high nitrogen content.|$|E
5|$|In 1777, the Revolutionary War {{intensified}} in Kentucky. British {{lieutenant governor}} Henry Hamilton armed his Indian allies from his headquarters at Fort Detroit, {{encouraging them to}} wage war on the Kentucky settlers in hopes of reclaiming the region as their hunting ground. The Continental Army could spare no men for an invasion in the northwest or {{for the defense of}} Kentucky, which was left entirely to the local population. Clark spent several months defending settlements against the Indian raiders as a leader in the Kentucky County militia, while developing his plan for <b>a</b> <b>long-distance</b> strike against the British. His strategy involved seizing British outposts north of the Ohio River to destroy British influence among their Indian allies.|$|E
5|$|In January 2008 China and Germany inaugurated <b>a</b> <b>long-distance</b> {{freight train}} service between Beijing and Hamburg.

After reaching {{the end of the}} Trans-Siberian at Moscow the train continues to Germany via rail links in Belarus and Poland. Total transit time is 15 days, as compared with the 30 days average it would take for the freight to make the same journey by ship. The first train of 50 containers, carrying a mixed load of clothes, ceramics and electronics (for the Fujitsu company), travelled on tracks operated by six different railways.|$|E
