40|$|The children, {{in school}} ages, are an {{important}} social group. In this stage of life the more frequent neurological diagnosis is the <b>Attention</b> Deficit Disorder <b>with</b> Hyperactivity.

40|$|Reward {{processing}} {{is suggested}} {{to be an}} underlying cognitive process that {{is related to the}} manifestation of attention problems in a subset of children <b>with</b> <b>Attention</b> Deficit-Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). To successfully implement intervention programs it is necessary to identify this subset of children and their profile of reward processing deficiencies. Therefore this study examined the heterogeneity in reward processing of children and adolescents <b>with</b> <b>attention</b> problems. A group of 276 participants <b>with</b> <b>attention</b> problems, consisting of 150 participants with ADHD and 126 participants with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), and a comparison group of 176 typically developing participants performed a neuropsychological guessing task that tested the effect of reward magnitude and frequency on performance. Two Latent Class Analyses were used to identify subgroups of participants <b>with</b> and without <b>attention</b> problems based on their task performance. Among participants <b>with</b> <b>attention</b> problems one large subgroup was found, consisting of half of the participants that seemed not affected in their reward processing. Three smaller subgroups were identified, each reflecting a different reward processing profile. Across subgroups participants differed in age and clinical diagnosis they received. Finally, the two subgroups found in the comparison group showed a similar profile compared to the two largest subgroups found among children <b>with</b> <b>attention</b> problems. In conclusion, considerable heterogeneity exists among children <b>with</b> <b>attention</b> problems <b>with</b> regards to their processing of rewards. Our findings indicate that intervention programs should address reward processing deficiencies more specifically...|$|R
5|$|Did Siletzia pivot {{about its}} {{northern}} end or southern end? This question has attracted considerable <b>attention,</b> <b>with</b> the evidence now favoring a northern pivot.

5|$|Dunne's {{bartender}} came to wider <b>attention</b> <b>with</b> {{the wartime}} columns, and the Dooley pieces were soon in newspapers nationwide.

Beginning around 1905, Dunne had increasing trouble finding time and inspiration for new columns, and they ended in 1915, except for a brief resurrection in the mid-1920s. Even in Dunne's own time (he died in 1936), his work was becoming obscure {{due in part to}} his use of dialect, and the unusual spellings that it used have proved a lasting barrier for potential readers.|$|E
5|$|During {{the postwar}} era, Indiana became a {{critical}} swing state that often helped decide which party controlled the presidency. Elections were very close, {{and became the}} center of frenzied <b>attention</b> <b>with</b> many parades, speeches and rallies as election day approached; voter turnout ranging over 90% to near 100% in such elections as 1888 and 1896. In remote areas, both sides paid their supporters to vote, and occasionally paid supporters of the opposition not to vote. Despite allegations, historians have found very little fraud in national elections.|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} in order to (a) compare the visual perceptions of seven-year-old children diagnosed <b>with</b> <b>attention</b> deficit hyperactivity disorder with those of normally developing children of the same age and development level and (b) determine whether the visual perceptions of children <b>with</b> <b>attention</b> deficit hyperactivity disorder vary with respect to gender, having received preschool education and parents` educational level. A total of 60 children, 30 <b>with</b> <b>attention</b> deficit hyperactivity disorder and 30 with normal development, were assigned to the study. Data about children <b>with</b> <b>attention</b> deficit hyperactivity disorder and their families was collected by using a General Information Form and the visual perception of children was examined through the Frostig Developmental Test of Visual Perception. The Mann-Whitney U-test and Kruskal-Wallis variance analysis was used to determine whether there was a difference of between the visual perceptions of children with normal development and those diagnosed <b>with</b> <b>attention</b> deficit hyperactivity disorder and to discover whether the variables of gender, preschool education and parents` educational status affected the visual perceptions of children <b>with</b> <b>attention</b> deficit hyperactivity disorder. The results showed that there was a statistically meaningful difference between the visual perceptions of the two groups and that the visual perceptions of children <b>with</b> <b>attention</b> deficit hyperactivity disorder were affected meaningfully by gender, preschool education and parents` educational status...|$|R

5|$|In Europe, 17-year-old Brigitte Bardot wore scanty bikinis (by {{contemporary}} standards) in the French film Manina, la fille sans voiles ("Manina, {{the girl}} unveiled"). The promotion for the film, released in France in March 1953, drew {{more attention to}} Bardot's bikinis than to the film itself. By the time the film was released in the United States in 1958 it was re-titled Manina, the Girl in the Bikini. Bardot was also photographed wearing a bikini on the beach during the 1953 Cannes Film Festival.

5|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, {{there were four}} notable Christian heavy metal groups: Messiah Prophet, Leviticus, Saint, and Stryper. Although it is {{debatable}} as to which band was formed first, the Orange County native glam metal group Stryper {{was the most popular}} one. Stryper was also the first band to identify as Christian metal. Stryper gained <b>attention</b> <b>with</b> their way of throwing Bibles to the audience at their concerts. In the beginning, mostly Christians went to Stryper's concerts but soon they reached non-Christian audience. In the 1980s, Christian metal bands closely followed the trends of mainstream metal bands.|$|E
