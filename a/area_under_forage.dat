Forages were continuously increasing in importance, as they comprised 73 % of the total area under field crops early in the eighties compared to 91 % by the end of the decade, with 26 % as the annual rate of increase. Alfalfa and grasses, mainly Rhodes grass, were the commonly grown crops in the UAE's four production regions. Such crops are generally classified as heavy consumers of natural agricultural resources (land and water) which are critically limiting the country's agricultural development. The major objectives of this study were to investigate allocation of natural resources to forage crops in the four regions and suggest alternative production plans. Statistical analysis of average yields revealed that the Central region has an absolute advantage in production of alfalfa and grasses over the other regions, while the Northern region has a comparative advantage in grass production. Accordingly, an LP model was constructed to determine an optimal production plan with the current restrictions on resources use and production levels. The results indicated that resources were under-utilized. Hence, it was possible to increase total alfalfa production by 26 % while maintaining grasses at the current production level. Equivalently, either 47 % or 27 % of the total <b>area</b> <b>under</b> <b>forage</b> production in Southern or Central regions, respectively, could be saved. The study also suggested usage of modern technologies and improved cultural operations together with introduction of other crops that are less exhaustive to natural resources as alternative ways for improved resource utilization and conservation.

30|$|Because {{we found}} {{evidence}} supporting {{increased use of}} prescribed burns but no evidence that it negatively influenced bighorn survival, we determined that prescribed burning likely contributed to bighorns expanding distribution via selection for treated habitat. Although specific habitat selection through RSF modeling revealed no selection for treated areas as a whole, increased use of this <b>area</b> <b>under</b> optimal <b>foraging</b> theory (Stephens and Krebs 1986) likely did not hinder bighorn fitness, and we found no increase in mortality during this time. Likewise, {{in a review of}} case studies on influences of fire on bighorn sheep populations, Peek et al. (1985) provide many examples in which fire-treated habitats benefited bighorn sheep populations. However, we postulate that wildfire that occurred late in the study negatively impacted bighorn sheep when an apparent decrease in survival was documented.|$|R

During the spring migration smaller herds will group together to form larger herds of 50,000 to 500,000 animals, but during autumn migrations the groups become smaller, and the reindeer begin to mate. During winter, reindeer travel to forested <b>areas</b> to <b>forage</b> <b>under</b> the snow. By spring, groups leave their winter grounds {{to go to the}} calving grounds. A reindeer can swim easily and quickly, normally at about 6.5 km/h but if necessary at 10 km/h, and migrating herds will not hesitate to swim across a large lake or broad river.|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE — To {{develop a}} {{mathematical}} model for the determination of total <b>areas</b> <b>under</b> curves from various metabolic studies. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS — In Tai's Model, the total <b>area</b> <b>under</b> a curve is computed by dividing the <b>area</b> <b>under</b> the curve between two designated values on the X-axis (abscissas) into small segments (rectangles and triangles) whose areas can be accurately calculated from their respective geometrical formulas. The total sum of these individual areas thus represents the total <b>area</b> <b>under</b> the curve. Validity of the model is established by comparing total areas obtained from this model to these same areas obtained from graphic method Gess than ± 0. 4 %). Other formulas widely applied by researchers under- or overestimated total <b>area</b> <b>under</b> a metabolic curve by a great margin. RESULTS — Tai's model proves {{to be able to}} 1) determine total <b>area</b> <b>under</b> a curve with precision; 2) calculate area with varied shapes {{that may or may not}} intercept on one or both X/Y axes; 3) estimate total <b>area</b> <b>under</b> a curve plotted against varied time intervals (abscissas), whereas other formulas only allow the same time interval; an...|$|R
