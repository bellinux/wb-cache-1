5|$|Association {{football}} initially {{struggled to}} take hold in Wigan with non-league clubs Wigan United (1890s), Wigan County (1897-1900) and Wigan Town (1905-1908) all folding {{within a few years}} of their creation. Wigan Borough, founded in 1919, became the town's first club to play in the Football League when in 1921 they became founder members of the Football League Third Division North. The club left the Football League <b>and</b> <b>folded</b> in 1931. They were replaced a year later by Wigan Athletic, the town's current professional football club.|$|E
5|$|Large {{sections}} of the hull plating seem to have fallen off well before the wreck hit the bottom. One such section, {{thought to have been}} from the galleys, separated from the stern in one piece and landed nearby. The force of the water tore up the poop deck <b>and</b> <b>folded</b> it back on itself. The center propeller is totally buried, while the force of the impact caused the two wing propellers and shafts to be bent upwards by an angle of about 20°.|$|E
5|$|Phellodon was {{circumscribed}} in 1881 by Finnish mycologist Petter Karsten to contain white-toothed fungi. Karsten included three species: P.cyathiformis, P.melaleucus, and the type, P.niger (originally published with the epithet nigrum). P.nigrum was originally described by Elias Fries in 1815 {{as a species}} of Hydnum. Some early authors did not consider Phellodon distinct {{enough to be a}} separate genus, <b>and</b> <b>folded</b> species assigned to this genus into Hydnellum.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{validity}} of “lateral fault model” <b>and</b> “apparent <b>fold</b> model” in aiding lower secondary school children to acquire the concept of fault <b>and</b> <b>fold</b> in their science study. We proposed new “lateral fault model” <b>and</b> “apparent <b>fold</b> model” considering the characteristics of the models proposed thus far. These models were developed to help the children easily visualize the concept of fault <b>and</b> <b>fold,</b> understand it intuitively when manipulating the teaching materials. 　Lower secondary school students, after learning the character of fault <b>and</b> <b>fold</b> topography, identified the location of faults <b>and</b> <b>folds</b> using geological maps. Sampling fault topography encourages them to be aware of natural disasters and their prevention. 本研究では、熊本県の露頭で観察される地層教材を活用し、学習に有効なモデル教材の作成と、それを用いた授業実践を行った...|$|R

5|$|Standard {{diagnostic}} criteria require impairment in social interaction and repetitive and stereotyped patterns of behavior, activities and interests, without significant delay in language or cognitive development. Unlike the international standard, the DSM-IV-TR criteria also required significant impairment in day-to-day functioning; DSM-5 eliminated AS {{as a separate}} diagnosis in 2013, <b>and</b> <b>folded</b> it into the umbrella of autism spectrum disorders. Other sets of {{diagnostic criteria}} have been proposed by Szatmari et al. and by Gillberg and Gillberg.|$|E

Hindwings from costa to Cubitus are tough and opaque like the forewings. The large anal area are membranous <b>and</b> <b>folded</b> in fan-like manner. There are no or very few branching in stick insect wing veins.|$|E
5|$|The Mildenhall, Kaiseraugst, and Esquiline treasures {{comprise}} large {{items of}} tableware. Other hoards, however, {{such as those}} found at Thetford and Beaurains consist mostly of coins, jewellery, and small tableware items; these two hoards probably are pagan votive offerings. A hoard from Traprain Law in Scotland contains decorated Roman silver pieces cut up <b>and</b> <b>folded,</b> showing regard {{for the value of}} their metal alone, and may represent loot from a raid.|$|E

5|$|The {{club was}} formed in 1878 and {{initially}} took part only in minor local competitions. In 1880, the club entered the FA Cup for the first time, and three years later defeated Old Etonians at Kennington Oval to win the trophy. Olympic, however, proved unable to compete with wealthier and better-supported clubs in the new professional era, <b>and</b> <b>folded</b> in 1889.|$|E
5|$|The {{reflector}} sight mechanism {{was mounted}} {{in front of}} the gyro, slightly to the left. A metal flap protected the half-mirror from damage when stowed, which was rotated rearward during use, covering the spirit level. The collimator was mounted on a prominent arm that projected above and {{in front of the}} sight when in use, <b>and</b> <b>folded</b> forward when stored. Electrical power was provided to light the collimator as well as the drift scale, which indicated the angle to fly to correct for the wind drift.|$|E
5|$|The two choughs are {{distinguishable}} {{from each}} other by their bill colour, and in flight the long broad wings and short tail of the red-billed give it a silhouette quite different from its slightly smaller yellow-billed relative. Both species fly with loose deep wing beats, and frequently use their manoeuvrability to perform acrobatic displays, soaring in the updraughts at cliff faces then diving and rolling with fanned tail <b>and</b> <b>folded</b> wings.|$|E

40|$|Distributions {{of protein}} {{families}} <b>and</b> <b>folds</b> in genomes are highly skewed, having {{a small number}} of prevalent superfamiles/superfolds and a large number of families/folds of a small size. Why are the distributions of protein families <b>and</b> <b>folds</b> skewed? Why are there {{only a limited number of}} protein families? Here, we employ an information theoretic approach to investigate the protein sequence-structure relationship that leads to the skewed distributions. We consider that protein sequences <b>and</b> <b>folds</b> constitute an information theoretic channel and computed the most efficient distribution of sequences that code all protein folds. The identified distributions of sequences <b>and</b> <b>folds</b> are found to follow a power law, consistent with those observed for proteins in nature. Importantly, the skewed distributions of sequences <b>and</b> <b>folds</b> are suggested to have different origins: the skewed distribution of sequences is due to evolutionary pressure to achieve efficient coding of necessary folds, whereas that of folds is based on the thermodynamic stability of folds. The current study provides a new information theoretic framework for proteins that could be widely applied for understanding protein sequences, structures, functions, and interactions...|$|R
5|$|After {{a fire at}} Manchester City's Hyde Road {{ground in}} 1920, the club {{considered}} a move to the Belle Vue athletics stadium, but it was deemed too small. At the behest of Belle Vue director John Henry Iles and John Ayrton, Manchester Central, was formed, and played its home matches at the speedway stadium. One of Manchester Central's first matches at Belle Vue was a visit by FA Cup holders Blackburn Rovers in September 1928. The club attempted unsuccessfully to join The Football League in 1930 and in 1931; with momentum lost, the club faded, <b>and</b> <b>folded</b> in 1934.|$|E
5|$|Francis has {{individualized}} features, to {{the point}} that the attention to his face gives it the quality of a portrait such as van Eyck's c. 1431 Portrait of Cardinal Niccolò Albergati. The head and face are minutely detailed. Francis is in his mid-thirties, wears stubble and has a somewhat jowly face and receding hairline. He is presented as a highly intelligent but perhaps detached and impassive individual. He is given a complex and inscrutable expression; physiological traits not uncommon in contemporary Flemish painting. He kneels on a bed of flowers, and his heavy robe <b>and</b> <b>folded</b> drapery have a choppy and overflowing feel. His lower limbs seem disconnected, positioned in an anti-naturalistic manner; giving the impression that he is levitating.|$|E
5|$|Herodotus, {{the ancient}} Greek historian, {{documented}} women carrying large phallic shaped monuments and ornaments {{the size of}} a human body in villages in ancient Dionysia. On the island of Delos a pillar supports a colossal phallus, the symbol of Dionysus. Phallus reliefs on buildings on such sites are also believed to have been apotropaic devices to ward off evil. The elaborate use of phallic architecture and sculpture in ancient Greek society can also be seen in sites such as Nea Nikomedeia in northern Greece. Archaeologists excavating the ancient town discovered clay sculptures of plump women with phallic heads <b>and</b> <b>folded</b> arms.|$|E

5|$|In 1888, {{the club}} became a limited company {{under the name}} of Small Heath F.C. Ltd, and joined the Combination, a league set up to provide {{organised}} football for those clubs not invited to join the Football League which was to start the same year. However, the Combination was not well organised <b>and</b> <b>folded</b> in April 1889 with many fixtures still outstanding. Small Heath were founder members of the Football Alliance in 1889–90, and three years later were elected to the newly formed Second Division of the Football League. They topped the table in their first season, failing to win promotion via the test match system then in operation, but reached the top flight {{for the first time in}} 1894. They were renamed Birmingham in 1905, finally becoming Birmingham City in 1943.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, Burger King and its franchises formed Restaurant Services Inc. (RSI), an {{independent}} purchasing cooperative, which covered 100 percent of BK {{stores in the}} United States. The creation of RSI {{was based on a}} proposal by then-CEO Barry Gibbons create an organization that would be autonomous from BK corporate operations, provide full financial disclosure to participants on pricing issues and revenues, and enjoy the participation of the entire chain to maximize the benefits of volume purchasing. The format of RSI was based on the system employed by KFC for its distribution system and was operated in a similar manner. Two weeks after the formation of the co-operative, Grand Met sold the physical assets of BKDS to Canadian-based buyout firm Onex Corporation <b>and</b> <b>folded</b> BKP into RSI.|$|E
5|$|The {{extent of}} the overlap between AS and high-functioning autism (HFA—autism unaccompanied by {{intellectual}} disability) is unclear. The ASD classification is to some extent an artifact of how autism was discovered, and may not reflect {{the true nature of}} the spectrum; methodological problems have beset Asperger syndrome as a valid diagnosis from the outset. In the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), published in May 2013, AS, as a separate diagnosis, was eliminated <b>and</b> <b>folded</b> into autism spectrum disorder. Like the diagnosis of Asperger syndrome, the change was controversial and AS was not removed from the WHO's ICD-10.|$|E

When the monthly comic was launched later that year the focus switched to Roy's son Rocky, who also played for Melchester. This publication was short-lived, <b>and</b> <b>folded</b> after only 19 issues. The adventures of the Race family were subsequently featured in the monthly Match of the Day football magazine, in which father and son were reunited as manager and player respectively. These strips began in 1997 and continued until the magazine's closure in May 2001.|$|E
5|$|Birmingham City Football Club, an English {{association}} {{football club}} {{based in the}} city of Birmingham, was founded in 1875 as Small Heath Alliance. For their first thirteen years, there was no league football, so matches were arranged on an occasional basis, supplemented by cup competitions organised at both local and national level. In 1888, Small Heath joined the Combination, a league set up to provide organised football for those clubs not invited to join the Football League which was to start the same year. However, the Combination was not well organised, <b>and</b> <b>folded</b> in April 1889 with many fixtures still outstanding.

5|$|DRS was enabled on lap 46, as Barrichello and Rosberg were contesting eighth position. Button {{had caught}} Maldonado and Alguersuari, and passed both cars for tenth place. Mark Webber {{was the first}} driver to switch to slick tyres, and was {{followed}} by Barrichello and Buemi. Kobayashi and Massa, fighting for second place, were both passed by Schumacher on lap 51; Massa then passed Kobayashi for third place. As the drivers pitted for slick tyres {{over the next three}} laps, Massa damaged his wing forcing him into another pitstop, while damage to Adrian Sutil's car led to his retirement. Button had risen from ninth after his pit-stop to fourth, and was catching the leading trio of Vettel, Schumacher and Webber. On lap 56 Heidfeld, while battling Kobayashi for fifth place, collided with the rear of the Sauber which damaged his front wing. The wing then detached <b>and</b> <b>folded</b> under the car, and Heidfeld after losing control of his car ran down an escape road on turn 3. The debris on-track from the accident called the sixth safety car period of the race.|$|E
