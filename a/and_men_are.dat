5|$|In Muslim families, women <b>and</b> <b>men</b> <b>are</b> {{considered}} equal, {{but not in}} the westernised sense. The Quran {{teaches that}} the minds of males and females work differently and are generally different biologically. Therefore, Islam grants different rights to the husband and wife.

5|$|People over 20 {{years of}} age with Birt–Hogg–Dubé {{syndrome}} have {{an increased risk of}} developing slow-growing kidney tumors (chromophobe renal carcinoma and renal oncocytoma, respectively), kidney cysts, and possibly tumors in other organs and tissues. These tumors often occur in both kidneys and in multiple locations in each kidney. The average number of kidney tumors found in a person with BHD is 5.3, though up to 28 tumors have been found. Hybrid oncocytoma/chromophobe carcinoma, found in 50% of cases, is the most commonly found cancer, followed by chromophobe renal carcinoma, clear cell renal carcinoma, renal oncocytoma, and papillary renal cell carcinoma. People over 40 years old <b>and</b> <b>men</b> <b>are</b> more likely to develop kidney tumors, which are diagnosed at a median age of 48. Kidney cancer associated with BHD have been diagnosed in people at ages as young as 20.|$|E

Recovery of functional abilities is often greater in male stroke survivors than females, especially in the area of activities of daily living.|$|E

25|$|Throughout Lanying’s life, {{she faced}} {{a lot more}} {{difficulties}} {{because she was a}} female. So after she came back from America, she joined the All-China Women's Federation. She held a lot of conferences and talked about the gender issues. As a woman, she never believed gender schema and always fought for herself. She believed that in the science field, women <b>and</b> <b>men</b> <b>are</b> equal, and that the reason why women are fewer in this field is because women are more easily distracted by other things such as gossip, so women have to memorize more unrelated things and cannot focus on work.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, {{women as}} a whole {{tend to be less}} {{assertive}} and confrontational. One of the factors contributing to the higher proportion of raises going to men is the simple fact that men tend to ask for raises more often than women, and are more aggressive when doing so. Women, <b>and</b> <b>men,</b> <b>are</b> socialized at young ages into these roles. School-age boys and girls have been noted as enacting the same aggressive and passive characteristics, respectively, in educational settings that we see in adults in the workplace. Boys {{are more likely to be}} pushed competitively in school, and sports, to be dominant. The idea that “winning is everything” is not emphasized to the same extent for girls and therefore they are less likely to seek recognition for their work.|$|E

25|$|In the Second Age of Middle-earth, {{the lords}} of Elves, Dwarves, <b>and</b> <b>Men</b> <b>are</b> given Rings of Power. Unbeknownst to them, the Dark Lord Sauron forges the One Ring in Mount Doom to conquer them all, abandoning {{a great part}} of his power to it in order to dominate, through it, at a distance, the other Rings and conquer Middle-earth. A final {{coalition}} of men and elves battle Sauron’s forces in Mordor, where Prince Isildur of Gondor cuts the One Ring off of Sauron's finger, thereby destroying his physical form. Unfortunately, Isildur decides {{to take care of the}} Ring himself, but the evil influence of the Ring corrupts Isildur, preventing him from destroying it in Mount Doom. Isildur is later killed by Orcs, and the Ring is lost for 2,500 years, found and owned by Gollum for five centuries. The Ring is then found by a Hobbit named Bilbo Baggins.|$|E
25|$|Girls {{are most}} likely to enjoy high {{self-esteem}} when engaged in supportive relationships with friends, the most important function of friendship to them is having someone who can provide social and moral support. When they fail to win friends' approval or couldn't find someone with whom to share common activities and common interests, in these cases, girls suffer from low self-esteem. In contrast, boys are more concerned with establishing and asserting their independence and defining their relation to authority. As such, {{they are more likely to}} derive high self-esteem from their ability to successfully influence their friends; on the other hand, the lack of romantic competence, for example, failure to win or maintain the affection of the opposite or same-sex (depending on sexual orientation), is the major contributor to low self-esteem in adolescent boys. Due to the fact that both men and women happen to have a low self-esteem after ending a romantic relationship, they are prone to other symptoms that is caused by this state. Depression and hopelessness are only two of the various symptoms and it is said that women are twice as likely to experience depression <b>and</b> <b>men</b> <b>are</b> three to four times more likely to commit suicide (Mearns, 1991; Ustun & Sartorius, 1995).|$|E
25|$|If, {{like other}} Platonists, he {{designated}} the material principle as undefined duality, the world-soul was probably described by {{him as the}} first defined duality, the conditioning or defining principle of every separate definitude {{in the sphere of}} the material and changeable, but not extending beyond it. He appears to have called it in the highest sense the individual soul, in a derivative sense a self-moving number, that is, the first number endowed with motion. To this world-soul Zeus, or the world-spirit, has entrusted - in what degree and in what extent, we do not learn - dominion over that which is liable to motion and change. The divine power of the world-soul is then again represented, in the different spheres of the universe, as infusing soul into the planets, Sun and Moon, - in a purer form, in the shape of Olympic gods. As a sublunary daemonical power (as Hera, Poseidon, Demeter), it dwells in the elements, and these daemonical natures, midway between gods <b>and</b> <b>men,</b> <b>are</b> related to them as the isosceles triangle is to the equilateral and the scalene. The divine world-soul which reigns over the whole domain of sublunary changes he appears to have designated as the last Zeus, the last divine activity.|$|E

25|$|Gender is {{a factor}} that {{plays a role in}} both human and animal aggression. Males are {{historically}} believed to be generally more physically aggressive than females from an early age, and men commit the vast majority of murders (Buss 2005). This {{is one of the most}} robust and reliable behavioral sex differences, and it has been found across many different age groups and cultures. However, some empirical studies have found the discrepancy in male and female aggression to be more pronounced in childhood and the gender difference in adults to be modest when studied in an experimental context. Still, there is evidence that males are quicker to aggression (Frey et al. 2003) and more likely than females to express their aggression physically. When considering indirect forms of non-violent aggression, such as relational aggression and social rejection, some scientists argue that females can be quite aggressive, although female aggression is rarely expressed physically. An exception is intimate partner violence that occurs among couples who are engaged, married, or in some other form of intimate relationship. In such cases, some research suggests that women are more physically aggressive than men, although differences are small <b>and</b> <b>men</b> <b>are</b> less likely to be injured than women are.|$|E
