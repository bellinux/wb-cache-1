The Tuscany Region included the Measure 215 in its rural development program for the period 2007 - 2013, supporting 162 dairy sheep farms. This study aims at evaluating animal welfare on a sample of 42 dairy sheep farms. Materials and methods - Farm surveys were performed by a trained observer to collect information on farm management and to measure structure characteristics through a checklist submitted to farmers. A software has been developed in order to grade farms after processing data built upon objective and easily measurable parameters. The check-list embraced five focal macroarea: A. management; B. farming system; C. environmental control; D. feeding and water supply; E. hygiene, health and behavioural aspects. An Excel spreadsheet was created to input the data and automatically assign both a partial and a total score to each area; then areas as well as farms were evaluated according to five classes of increasing level of animal welfare. Descriptive analysis of the data was performed and non parametric Wilkoxon test was used to verify statistical differences in levels of welfare distribution. Results and discussion - The study displays a situation characterized by a satisfactory level of well-being, with only 10...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} <b>animal</b> <b>welfare</b> {{definitions}} and <b>animal</b> <b>welfare</b> assessment. <b>Animal</b> <b>welfare</b> is a prolonged mental state, resulting from how the animal experiences its environment over time. There are different methods for <b>animal</b> <b>welfare</b> assessment. The four basic criteria for <b>animal</b> <b>welfare</b> assessment are feeding, housing, health and appropriate behavior. Therefore, criteria {{used to assess}} <b>animal</b> <b>welfare</b> are not direct measures of the mental state but only parameters {{that need to be}} interpreted in terms of welfare. The immediate housing environment and feeding may influence <b>animal</b> <b>welfare</b> either positively, when most of the important requirements are respected, or negatively, when animals are exposed to various stress factors and unpleasant emotions that contribute to animal disease, injuries or inappropriate behavior. Therefore, <b>animal</b> <b>welfare</b> is a unique link between housing conditions, feeding and watering on one side, and animal health status and behavior on the other side...|$|R

40|$|On {{the first}} January 2009 the {{official}} <b>animal</b> <b>welfare</b> control were {{transferred from the}} municipalities to the County Administrative board. With this transition, some changes occurred for those who work as <b>animal</b> <b>welfare</b> inspectors. The aim {{for this study was}} to examine farmers' view on the transition between the municipalities and County Administrative board, in order to compare the two authorities. I have also studied the farmers view about <b>animal</b> <b>welfare</b> inspectors' knowledge, both theoretical and practical. The questionnaire also included questions about farmers' view on <b>animal</b> <b>welfare</b> legislation. I choose to interview farmers from various places in Dalecarlia County, so that I would get all the municipalities represented. The questionnaire was sent to 40 farmers, which 26 chose to participate in my survey. The results of my questionnaire showed a lack of introduction to the farmer, 38 percent of the farmers received no initial information. 62 percent of the farmers did not want <b>animal</b> <b>welfare</b> controls to be pre-notified. The overall opinion of the farmers was that they always should take care of their animals well, therefore they do not need <b>animal</b> <b>welfare</b> controls to be pre-notified. The County Administrative welfare inspector was considered to have a better knowledge than the municipality's <b>animal</b> <b>welfare</b> inspector had, although the difference was barely noticeable with 22 to 21 pleased farmers. Farmers were also pleased with <b>animal</b> <b>welfare</b> inspectorâ€™s practical experience, 50 percent were pleased with the municipalityÂ´s <b>animal</b> <b>welfare</b> inspector and 58 percent were pleased with the County Administrative <b>animal</b> <b>welfare</b> inspector. Overall, the farmers were very satisfied with the <b>animal</b> <b>welfare</b> inspectorâ€™s ways to deal with <b>animal</b> <b>welfare</b> controls. Twice as many indicated that they were dissatisfied with the municipalityÂ´s <b>animal</b> <b>welfare</b> inspector than the County Administrative welfare inspector; as they do not take into account the farmers' thoughts and opinions. 81 percent of the farmers were satisfied with the County Administrative <b>animal</b> <b>welfare</b> inspectors work because they considered the farmer's thoughts and opinions. One of my questions was how the farmers perceived the <b>animal</b> <b>welfare</b> legislation. Half of the farmers responded that they had knowledge of the legislation surrounding their species. In my study, 18 out of the 26 farmers perceive that the <b>animal</b> <b>welfare</b> legislation is at an acceptable level. About half of the farmers had suggestions on how contact between farmers and <b>animal</b> <b>welfare</b> inspector could be done better. Opinions emerged suggesting that the farmers want to have a closer contact with <b>animal</b> <b>welfare</b> inspectors to promote prevention before major flaws were noticed...|$|R

These standards are under constant review and are debated, created and revised by <b>animal</b> <b>welfare</b> groups, legislators and academics worldwide. <b>Animal</b> <b>welfare</b> science uses various measures, such as longevity, disease, immunosuppression, behavior, physiology, and reproduction, although there is debate about which of these indicators provide the best information.|$|R
40|$|<b>Animal</b> <b>welfare</b> is an {{increasing}} issue of public concern and debate. As a result, many countries are reconsidering the way <b>animal</b> <b>welfare</b> {{is embedded in the}} legislation and rules for housing and care of animals. This requires general agreement of what <b>animal</b> <b>welfare</b> is. Unfortunately, the current science of <b>animal</b> <b>welfare</b> is less scientific than what has been claimed. In our view, it is overly guided by anthropocentric thinking about how animals ought to be handled and neglects the latest concept of physiology: `The Allostasis ConceptÂ¿. Allostasis, which means stability through change, has the potential to replace homeostasis as the core model of physiological regulation. Not constancy or freedoms, but capacity to change is crucial to good physical and mental health and good <b>animal</b> <b>welfare.</b> Therefore, not homeostasis but allostasis is at the basis of our new <b>animal</b> <b>welfare</b> concept.

40|$|Purpose Â¿ The {{purpose of}} this paper is to provide {{insights}} into the rationale of Dutch pig farmers concerning <b>animal</b> <b>welfare</b> and animal-friendly production. It aims to show the interrelations between farmers' production logic, their ideas about good farming and <b>animal</b> <b>welfare</b> and the characteristics of Dutch pig production. Design/methodology/approach Â¿ In total, 62 Dutch pig farmers, participating in quality assurance schemes with different focuses on <b>animal</b> <b>welfare,</b> were interviewed about <b>animal</b> <b>welfare,</b> legislation, quality assurance schemes, and possibilities for animal-friendly production. Findings Â¿ Farmers' attitudes towards <b>animal</b> <b>welfare</b> and the implementation of <b>animal</b> <b>welfare</b> measures follow their understanding of good farming practices, which in turn are strongly influenced by the rationale of the market in which they operate. Two groups can be distinguished. Farmers operating in markets that focus on price and production-efficiency tend to define <b>animal</b> <b>welfare</b> in terms of animal health and optimal zoo-technical performance. Farmers operating in markets with a broader sense of quality, which incorporates values such as naturalness, <b>animal</b> <b>welfare</b> and care for the environment, define <b>animal</b> <b>welfare</b> in terms of the room the animals have to express natural behaviour. Originality/value Â¿ This article provides insights into the perception of Dutch pig farmers about <b>animal</b> <b>welfare</b> and their readiness to change towards more animal-friendly production methods. It points to the interrelations between <b>animal</b> <b>welfare</b> attitudes and behaviour, farmers' perception of good farming and the production logic of the farm. These interrelated influences should be borne in mind by policy makers and researchers seeking to raise welfare levels in pig production...|$|R
