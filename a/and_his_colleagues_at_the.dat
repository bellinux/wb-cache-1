The biocompatibility of these glasses has led them to be investigated extensively for use as implant materials {{in the human body}} to repair and replace diseased or damaged bone.

25|$|Michael Lesch was {{a medical}} student at Johns Hopkins University and William Nyhan, a {{pediatrician}} and biochemical geneticist, was his mentor, when the two identified LNS and its associated hyperuricemia in two affected brothers, ages 4 and 8. Lesch and Nyhan published their findings in 1964. Within three years, the metabolic cause was identified by J. Edwin Seegmiller <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>colleagues</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> NIH.|$|E
25|$|In 1954, Freitag <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>colleagues</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Bureau of Aeronautics (BuAer) again {{tried to}} engage the Navy in FBM {{development}} by funneling their research to a secret study committee chaired by Massachusetts Institute of Technology president James R. Killian. The Killian Committee had a charter to unify the ballistic missile programs scattered among the services, and enthusiastically recommended that the Navy develop a fleet-based intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM). This external endorsement by a distinguished independent evaluator persuaded the chief of BuAir, Rear Admiral James S. Russell, to fully commit the bureau to FBM development.|$|E

25|$|In May and June 2002 Roberto Soria <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>colleagues</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics {{discovered}} two Ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) {{with the}} Chandra X-ray Observatory. ULXs are objects that emit tremendous amounts of X-rays (> 1032 watts or 1039 erg/s), assuming they radiate isotropically (the same in all directions). This amount {{is larger than}} currently understood stellar processes (including supernovae) but smaller than the amount of X-rays emitted by active galactic nuclei, which accounts for their alternate name, Intermediate-luminosity X-ray Objects (IXOs). The source designated ULX1 {{was found in a}} relatively empty interarm region, far from any bright clusters or star-forming complexes, and showed a 75% increase in X-ray luminosity over the course of 20 days. ULX2 was found in an exceptionally bright young stellar complex, and showed an order of magnitude increase over the same time period.|$|E
25|$|PfEMP1 was {{discovered}} by Russell J. Howard <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>colleagues</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> US National Institutes of Health in 1984. Using the techniques of radioiodination and immunoprecipitation, they found a unique but yet unknown antigen from P. falciparum-infected RBCs that appeared to cause binding with other cells. Since the antigenic protein could only be detected in infected cells, they asserted that the protein was produced by the malarial parasite, and not by RBCs. The antigen was large {{and appeared to be}} different in size in different strains of P. falciparum obtained from night monkey (Aotus). In one strain, called Camp (from Malaysia), the antigen was found to have a molecular size of approximately 285 kDa; while in the other, called St. Lucia (from El Salvador), it was approximately 260 kDa. Both antigens bind to cultured skin cancer (melanoma) cells. But the researchers failed to confirm whether or not the protein actually was an adhesion molecule to the wall of blood vessels. Later in the same year, they found out that the unknown antigen was associated only with RBCs having small lumps called knobs on their surface. The first human RBC antigen was reported in 1986. Howard's team found that the antigens from Gambian children, who were suffering from falciparum malaria, were similar to those from the RBCs of night monkey. They determined that the molecular sizes of the proteins ranged from 250 to 300 kDa.|$|E
500|$|Along {{with this}} research, Fischbach <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>colleagues</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Simons Foundation are {{studying}} diseases that have autistic features, such as Rett syndrome and Fragile X syndrome. [...] The {{hope is that}} {{a better understanding of}} the central role of the synapse in autistic symptoms can be discovered as well as which specific regions of the brain are responsible for these behaviors. [...] Within the next decade, the ultimate goal of this research is to determine the precise neural circuitry involved in autism and how it translates to the autistic behaviors displayed.|$|E

2500|$|The lamprey {{has been}} {{extensively}} studied because its relatively simple brain is thought in many respects to reflect the brain structure of early vertebrate ancestors.

2500|$|Phnom Penh {{was founded}} when Lady Penh found a [...] "four-faced Buddha" [...] {{floating}} {{down the river}} on a Koki tree during the flooding season. She retrieved the Buddha image and had the Wat Phnom constructed to house the image. The four-faced Buddha [...] is important in Khmer Buddhist iconography, signifying {{the establishment of the}} kingdom of the Buddha of the Future, Maitreya, who is often identified with the Buddha-king of Cambodia. The type of Buddhism practiced in medieval Cambodia has been widely studied by professor François Bizot <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>colleagues</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> École française d'Extrême-Orient. They have identified tantric and esoteric elements in this tradition and thus call it [...] "Tantric Theravada".|$|E

The officers entered an apartment on Chicago's West Side, shooting and killing Hampton and Black Panther activist Mark Clark, and wounding four others. Taylor, together with several other People's Law Office lawyers and staff, were called to the apartment by survivors. For the next ten days they collected evidence at the scene.|$|E
