5|$|Four pilosity {{patterns}} (patterns of hair-like setae) {{are known}} to occur within Tatuidris collections. Pilosity pattern A consists of a mix of both long flexuous and short appressed setae. This {{is the most common}} pilosity pattern <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> that most resembles the type specimens from El Salvador and the gyne from Otongachi, Ecuador. Pilosity pattern B is characterized by very short, fully appressed, and regular spaced setae arrayed homogeneously and equidistantly on the head, mesosoma, petiole, postpetiole and gaster. Pilosity pattern C is characterized by dense lanose-looking setae. Pilosity pattern D consists of short and uniform decumbent (strongly inclined but not fully appressed) setae scattered throughout the body.|$|E

5|$|In {{the sixth}} match, Ryusuke Taguchi defended the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship against Kenny Omega of the Bullet Club. Distractions by the Bullet Club's Young Bucks allowed Omega to spray Taguchi {{in the eyes}} with an aerosol can and broke Taguchi's ankle lock on Omega later in the match. Omega {{captured}} the championship after a snap dragon suplex, a bicycle knee strike, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>One</b> Winged Angel (electric chair dropped into a one-handed driver), pinning the champion at 13 minutes and 20 seconds.|$|E

She decides {{that she wants to}} buy her apartment <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> above her, and turn them into her dream home. When she learns that her neighbor, Brian (Nate Corddry), will not be bribed out of his apartment, she agrees to move in with him, seemingly to save money, hoping to drive him out with her behavior. At work, Liz is disgusted by her staff writer, Frank Rossitano (Judah Friedlander) peeing in bottles to stop global warming. However, she decides to adopt this behavior to force Brian to leave; she is successful.|$|E
5|$|Navenby {{is served}} by its own village school, Navenby Church of England Primary School. It is a {{voluntary}} controlled school for children aged 4–11. There is a choice of nearby senior schools for older Navenby pupils, although none are within the village. Lincolnshire County Council operates a preference system for parents, which allows them to choose a preferred school, rather than one {{for which they are}} in the catchment area. The closest senior school to Navenby, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> that is within the Designated Transport Area, is Sir William Robertson High School at Welbourn. This is a mixed comprehensive school named after Field Marshal William Robertson, who was born in Welbourn and served in the First World War.|$|E

5|$|Perhaps {{the best}} known nativity scene in America is the Neapolitan Baroque Crèche {{displayed}} annually in the Medieval Sculpture Hall of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. Its backdrop is a 1763 choir screen from the Cathedral of Valladolid and a twenty-foot blue spruce decorated {{with a host of}} 18th-century angels. The nativity figures are placed at the tree's base. The crèche was the gift of Loretta Hines Howard in 1964, and the choir screen was the gift of The William Randolph Hearst Foundation in 1956. Both this presepio <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> displayed in Pittsburgh originated from the collection of Eugenio Catello.|$|E
5|$|Pillars of Eternity was {{developed}} by Obsidian Entertainment and published by Paradox Interactive. The game uses {{a modified version of}} the Unity game engine made specifically for Pillars of Eternity. The game was directed by Josh Sawyer.

Also involved in production were Adam Brennecke, Chris Avellone and Tim Cain. The audio director of Pillars of Eternity was Justin Bell, who also composed the game's score. Bell stated he was inspired by the music of Baldur's Gate and Icewind Dale when composing the game's music.|$|E

5|$|Since Smyth {{still had}} his {{commitments}} at Princeton and Chicago, he could only work on the report part-time. He wrote the report {{in his office in}} Princeton's Palmer Laboratory. Bars were installed on the windows of Smyth's office <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> adjacent to it. The hallway door to his office was locked and blocked by a large safe so that the only access was through the adjacent office, where there was an armed guard. The guards worked in eight-hour shifts, and one was present around the clock. When Smyth sent papers to Groves in Washington, D.C., they went by military courier.|$|E

Without telling Stephen, she flees, returning to her family home <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> constant in her life: her sister Jeanne.

5|$|The Hemingway scholar Allen Josephs {{thinks the}} novel is {{centered}} on the corrida (the bullfighting), and how each character reacts to it. Brett seduces the young matador; Cohn fails to understand and expects to be bored; Jake understands fully because only he moves between {{the world of the}} inauthentic expatriates and the authentic Spaniards; the hotel keeper Montoya is the keeper of the faith; and Romero is the artist in the ring—he is both innocent and perfect, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> who bravely faces death. The corrida is presented as an idealized drama in which the matador faces death, creating a moment of existentialism or nada (nothingness), broken when he vanquishes death by killing the bull.|$|E
5|$|The Ornithological Dictionary is George Montagu's best-known work, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> that {{established}} {{his reputation as}} a pioneer of British ornithology. He compiled the book at his home Knowle House, near Kingsbridge in Devon. It was published soon after the first volume of Thomas Bewick's illustrated handbook, A History of British Birds, which appeared in 1797. It does not describe what is now called Montagu's harrier, which he separated from the hen harrier in 1803, after the publication of the book.|$|E

5|$|The {{life-cycle}} {{assessment of}} bismuth {{will focus on}} solders, {{one of the major}} uses of bismuth, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> with the most complete information. The average primary energy use for solders is around 200 MJ per kg, with the high-bismuth solder (58% Bi) only 20% of that value, and three low-bismuth solders (2% to 5% Bi) running very close to the average. The global warming potential averaged 10 to 14kg carbon dioxide, with the high-bismuth solder about two-thirds of that and the low-bismuth solders about average. The acidification potential for the solders is around 0.9 to 1.1kg sulfur dioxide equivalent, with the high-bismuth solder and one low-bismuth solder only one-tenth of the average and the other low-bismuth solders about average.|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} grave, {{and the most}} spectacular set of artefacts, was found near {{the centre of the}} cemetery. Grave 42 was a deep, wide pit in which a high-status individual was buried on top of a wooden bed with iron fittings. The body lying on the bed was most likely that of a woman of very high-ranking noble descent, possibly royalty, as {{the quantity and quality of}} the jewellery found in the grave is indicative of a woman ranking at the top of Anglo-Saxon society.
