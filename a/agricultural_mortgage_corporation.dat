40|$|Mortgage {{fees that}} are charged by lenders have caused {{increasing}} concerns to borrowers and policymakers, and heighted {{debate over the}} time with particular scrutiny during the recent global financial crisis. Interestingly however, {{there is almost no}} research on mortgage fees in the Australian context. This paper analyzes mortgage fee differentials among banks, <b>mortgage</b> <b>corporations,</b> building societies and credit unions operating in Australia during the research period. Findings suggest that banks charged the highest total, origination and ongoing fees while <b>mortgage</b> <b>corporations</b> have the lowest ongoing fees. The results also suggest that <b>mortgage</b> <b>corporations</b> require the same level of total fees as those of member-based institutions (building societies and credit unions), however banks and building societies have about 7 and 3 basis points of ongoing fees respectively more than <b>mortgage</b> <b>corporations.</b> Ongoing fees are an important mortgage cost because a borrower must pay them for a whole life of a loan, unlike the upfront fees that are paid just once. It also suggests that unlike <b>mortgage</b> <b>corporations</b> (the securitizer), depository lenders that charged higher ongoing fees probably maintain the customer relationship. This provides preliminary evidence in line with the existing US literature that there are statistically significant differences between the fee structures of Australian mortgage products.

40|$|Australia {{has seen}} {{significant}} rises in mortgage costs and sharp declines in housing affordability {{in the past}} decade or so, which corresponds with the introduction of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) in July 2000. To what extent the GST has impacted mortgage costs is the research question. This study investigates the GST impact on the mortgage costs of Australian <b>mortgage</b> <b>corporations.</b> Using data of <b>mortgage</b> <b>corporations</b> operating in Australia, we perform t-tests and multivariate regression analysis to examine the GST effects on mortgage yield spreads. The empirical results clearly indicate that <b>mortgage</b> <b>corporations</b> increased their <b>mortgage</b> charges in the post-GST periods significantly beyond the magnitude of the GST. Furthermore, the lenders started to increase the yield spreads before and continued to increase the spreads after the implementation of the GST, indicating the rise in mortgage costs was not a one-off surge. The findings offer insights into mortgage costs and have significant policy implications and wider economic relevance...|$|R
