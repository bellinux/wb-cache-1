25|$|The sibling {{relationship}} {{is a unique}} one, as they share a special bond and a common history from birth, have a certain role <b>and</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> family, often complement each other, and share genetic traits. Siblings who enjoy a close relationship participate in each other's daily lives and special events, confide in each other, share joys, spend leisure time together (whether they are children or adults), and have a relationship that not only exists in the present but often looks toward a future together (even into retirement). Surviving siblings lose this “companionship and a future” with their deceased siblings.|$|E

25|$|The convenience, low cost, and {{mobility}} {{of this method}} distinguish it from conventional testing and are the primary reasons for its growing popularity. The method is convenient because all required sound system, power generation and distribution and data acquisition and control equipment is brought to the test site. Equipment is usually leased for each test event. There is no large investment in a facility, equipment or personnel required {{on the part of}} the customer. A diesel generator is the preferred power source, therefore providing clean on-site electrical power in a consistent configuration for connection to the MSI power distribution equipment. This removes the demand for large quantities of power from the test facility. In addition, testing can be performed at a much lower cost per test compared to the installation, operation and maintenance of a more standard high intensity reverberant acoustic chamber system. Finally, mobility allows this test method to be performed at almost any time <b>and</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> normal test article integration and test flow. The test equipment is completely portable and no special facility or infrastructure is required.|$|E

500|$|The {{first known}} mention {{of this disease}} is from a 1700 BC Egyptian papyrus, which advises: “...

500|$|The Bears {{kicked off}} the regular season at home against the Cincinnati Bengals. The game was the teams' first meeting since 2009, in which the Bengals won 45–10. Since , the Bears dropped two of three games to the Bengals, winning 24–0 in 2001, while losing 24–7 in 2005 and 45–10 in 2009. The two teams entered with {{defenses}} that {{ranked in the top}} six in 2012, but the Bears were ranked 16th in scoring at 23.4 points per game and 28th overall on offense, while the Bengals had an average score of 24.4 PPG and were 22nd in total offense. Among the Bears' strategies that should be utilized include trying to protect Jay Cutler, as six of the Bengals' linemen had combined for 129 career sacks. The Bears' offensive line allowed 44 sacks in 2012, and as a result, changed the line by adding veterans Jermon Bushrod and Matt Slauson to supplement Roberto Garza on the left, while rookies Kyle Long and Jordan Mills joined Garza on the right side, marking the first time the Bears offensive line featured two rookies since Jim Covert and Rob Fada in 1983. The Bears' defense had to apply pressure to Andy Dalton, whose quick release led to four play-action touchdown passes to A. J. Green in 2013, the third most in the NFL. Bears' radio announcer Jeff Joniak wrote, [...] "Marc Trestman owns the element of surprise, a true asset in Week 1. There is not much tape on Trestman for the Bengals to game plan from. It's old tape with very different personnel from a different time <b>and</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> NFL. Trestman will try to use this asset to his advantage and a quick strike early in the game will jack up the crowd, and give the team a foundation to build on." [...] The Bears captains team captains for the season, starting with the Bengals game, were Cutler and Roberto Garza on offense, Lance Briggs and Julius Peppers on defense and Patrick Mannelly on special teams. 2013 was Mannelly's sixth consecutive season as captain, the fifth season for Cutler, third for Garza, fourth for Peppers and first for Briggs.|$|E
