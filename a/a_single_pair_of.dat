5|$|The {{differences}} between millipedes and centipedes {{are a common}} question from the general public. Both groups of myriapods share similarities, such as long, multi-segmented bodies, many legs, <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> antennae, {{and the presence of}} postanntennal organs, but have many differences and distinct evolutionary histories, as the most recent common ancestor of centipedes and millipedes lived around 450 to 475 million years ago in the Silurian. The head alone exemplifies the differences; millipedes have short, elbowed antennae for probing the substrate, a pair of robust mandibles and <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> maxillae fused into a lip; centipedes have long, threadlike antennae, a pair of small mandibles, two pairs of maxillae and a pair of large poison claws.|$|E
5|$|Among myriapods, millipedes have {{traditionally}} been considered most {{closely related to the}} tiny pauropods, although some molecular studies challenge this relationship. Millipedes can be distinguished from the somewhat similar but only distantly related centipedes (class Chilopoda), which move rapidly, are carnivorous, and have only <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> legs on each body segment. The scientific study of millipedes is known as diplopodology, and a scientist who studies them is called a diplopodologist.|$|E
40|$|Vogel, E. H. Universidad de Talca, Escuela de Psicología, Casilla N° 747, Talca, Chile. The goal of {{this study}} was to define {{conditions}} under which conditioned immunosuppression may be observed reliably. In three experiments, rats were exposed to a gustatory conditioned stimulus (CS) paired with cyclophosphamide (US), which induces immunosuppression and malaise. In Experiment 1, <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>pairing</b> <b>of</b> the CS with low, medium, or high doses of cyclophosphamide in separate groups produced no reliable conditioned immunosuppression even though conditioned taste aversion was observed in groups trained with high and medium doses of CY. Experiment 2 replicated the lack <b>of</b> effect following <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>pairing</b> <b>of</b> the CS with the medium dose of cyclophosphamide but demonstrated that three pairings are sufficient to induce conditioned immunosuppression. Experiment 3 demonstrated that significant immunosuppression is observable following <b>a</b> <b>single</b> CSûUS <b>pairing</b> if the CS is presented in compound with a previously nonreinforced CS during training, an effect reminiscent of supernormal conditioning. These findings indicate that conditioned immunosuppression effects can be enhanced in magnitude through the use of certain procedural techniques...|$|R

5|$|The jack jumper ant genome is {{contained}} on <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> chromosomes (males {{have just one}} chromosome, as they are haploid). This is the lowest number known (indeed possible) for any animal, a number shared with the parasitic roundworm Parascaris equorum univalens. Jack jumper ants are taxonomically discussed as a single biological species in the Myrmecia pilosula species complex. The ant has nine polymorphic loci, which yielded 67 alleles.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>single</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> {{long and}} slender {{antennae}} is present, the segments {{of which are}} relatively few and elongated.

In between them is a small triangular rostral plate with a narrow and sharp central ridge.|$|E
5|$|The {{head of a}} {{millipede}} {{is typically}} rounded above and flattened below and bears a pair of large mandibles {{in front of a}} plate-like structure called a gnathochilarium ("jaw lip"). The head contains <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> antennae with seven or eight segments and a group of sensory cones at the tip. Many orders also possess a pair of sensory organs known as the Tömösváry organs, shaped as small oval rings posterior and lateral {{to the base of the}} antennae. Their function is unknown, but they also occur in some centipedes, and are possibly used to measure humidity or light levels in the surrounding environment.|$|E

5|$|Using {{techniques}} of genetic complementation, Macrae paired nonluminescent monocaryons with luminescent ones, {{and concluded that}} luminosity in P.stipticus is an inherited character, and governed by <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> alleles in which luminosity was dominant over nonluminosity. Luminosity factors were independent of intersterility factors. In 1992, Lingle and colleagues agreed with Macrae about luminosity and stated that at least three different gene mutations {{could lead to the}} loss of luminescence. They also reported that the maximum bioluminescence was found at 525nm, and shifted to 528nm in deeply pigmented fruit bodies.|$|E
5|$|Diptera {{have one}} pair of fore wings on the {{mesothorax}} {{and a pair of}} halteres, or reduced hind wings, on the metathorax. A further adaptation for flight is the reduction in number of the neural ganglia, and concentration of nerve tissue in the thorax, a feature that is most extreme in the highly derived Muscomorpha infraorder. Some species of flies are exceptional in that they are secondarily flightless. The only other order of insects bearing <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> true, functional wings, in addition to any form of halteres, are the Strepsiptera. In contrast to the flies, the Strepsiptera bear their halteres on the mesothorax and their flight wings on the metathorax. Each of the fly's six legs has a typical insect structure of coxa, trochanter, femur, tibia and tarsus, with the tarsus in most instances being subdivided into five tarsomeres. At the tip of the limb is a pair of claws, and between these are cushion-like structures known as pulvilli which provide adhesion.|$|E
5|$|In the chaetonotidans, the {{excretory}} system {{consists of}} <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> protonephridia, which open through separate pores on the lateral {{underside of the}} animal, usually in the midsection of the body. In the macrodasyidans, there are several pairs of these opening {{along the side of}} the body. Nitrogenous waste is probably excreted through the body wall, as part of respiration, and the protonephridia are believed to function mainly in osmoregulation. Unusually, the protonephridia do not take the form of flame cells, but, instead, the excretory cells consist of a skirt surrounding a series of cytoplasmic rods that in turn enclose a central flagellum. These cells, termed cyrtocytes, connect to a single outlet cell which passes the excreted material into the protonephridial duct.|$|E

40|$|Presentation of odourized {{protein-free diet}} for 4 {{or more hours}} after gastric {{intubation}} with a balanced amino acid mixture established a preference for the odour. <b>A</b> <b>single</b> <b>pairing</b> <b>of</b> odour presentation and the same gastric load with histidine omitted induced a conditioned aversion, i. e. the histidine-devoid load generated a negative US. Supplying the omitted histidine at or before the time the odourized diet was removed counteracted the deficiency- induced aversion by generating a positive US. When the balanced mixture or the histidine-devoid mixture was tubed one hour before or {{right at the end}} of a 4 -hr odour presentation, no conditioned preference or aversion was formed. The results suggest that, in contrast to toxic reinforcers, the dosages of the nutritional reinforcers used here generate internal unconditioned stimuli which have no capacity to condition reactions to stimuli withdrawn an hour or more previously...|$|R

5|$|Jack jumper ants are {{primarily}} active {{during the day}} and live in open habitats, nesting in bushland, woodland and dry open forests, surrounded by gravel and sandy soil, which can be found in rural areas and are less common in urban areas. They prey on small insects and use their barbless stinger to kill other insects by injecting venom. Other ants and predatory invertebrates prey on the jack jumper. The average worker has a life expectancy of over one year. Workers are gamergates, allowing them to reproduce with drones, whether or not a queen is present in the colony. The ant {{is a part of the}} Myrmecia pilosula species complex; this ant and other members of the complex are known to have <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> chromosomes.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} {{chromosomes}} per individual varies {{from one to}} over 70 among the species in the genus. The genome of M. pilosula is contained on <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> chromosomes (males have just one chromosome, as they are haploid). This is the lowest number possible for any animal, and workers of this species are homologous. Like M. pilosula, M. croslandi also contains a single chromosome. While these ants only have a single chromosome, M. pyriformis contains 41 chromosomes while M. brevinoda contains 42. The chromosome count for M. piliventris and M. fulvipes is 2 and 12, respectively. The genus Myrmecia retains many traits that are considered basal for all ants (i.e. workers foraging alone and relying on visual cues).|$|E
5|$|There are {{a number}} of drains that connect to the River Witham and that are {{protected}} by flood doors. These consist of <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> mitre gates that are designed to close if the level in the river rises above the level in the drain. Several of these are navigable to the more adventurous boater. The river is also joined by the Kyme Eau, which connects to the Sleaford Navigation on which navigation will eventually be restored to Sleaford. At Antons Gowt, a lock drops down into the Witham Navigable Drains, a system of drainage ditches which are used to prevent flooding of the fens to the north of Boston. Since November 2008 there has been an active campaign by the Billinghay Skirth Regeneration Society to restore navigation on the River Skirth, and the project has won the support of Billinghay and other parish councils, the Inland Waterways Association, the Environment Agency, Lincolnshire County Council and the Lincolnshire Waterways Partnership.|$|E

5|$|Unlike most {{primitive}} rhinoceroses, {{the front}} teeth of Paraceratherium {{were reduced to}} <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> incisors in either jaw, which were large and conical, and {{have been described as}} tusks. The upper incisors pointed downwards; the lower ones were shorter and pointed forwards. Among known rhinoceroses, this arrangement is unique to Paraceratherium and the related Urtinotherium. The incisors may have been larger in males. The canine teeth otherwise found behind the incisors were lost. The incisors were separated from the row of cheek teeth by a large diastema (gap). This feature is found in mammals where the incisors and cheek teeth have different specialisations. The upper molars, except for the third upper molar that was V-shaped, had a pi-shaped (π) pattern and a reduced metastyle. The premolars only partially formed the pi pattern. Each molar {{was the size of a}} human fist; among mammals they were only exceeded in size by proboscideans, though they were small relative to the size of the skull. The lower cheek teeth were L-shaped, which is typical of rhinoceroses.|$|E
5|$|The {{body can}} be divided into three parts – the cephalon (head), the pereon (thorax), and the abdomen. The pereon {{comprises}} most of the length of the body. It is divided into seven segments known as pereonites. The rounded and smooth cephalon is fused to the first pereonite; while the highly reduced and almost invisible abdomen is attached to the posterior of the seventh pereonite. In males the first two pereonites are elongated, with the second pereonite being the longest of all the pereonites. They are densely covered with long setae (bristles), giving them a hairy appearance. The second pereonite also has two to three pairs of spines on the back, with an additional two pairs at the sides near the base of the limbs. The remaining pereonites (third to seventh) lack the dense setae of the first two pereonites. The third pereonite has seven pairs of spines at the back while the fourth pereonite has eight pairs. Both have three to seven pairs of spines near the base of the gills. The fifth pereonite has five pairs of back spines and a pair of spines at the sides. The sixth and seventh pereonites each have two pairs of back spines, situated at their centers and near the posterior. Females differ from males in having much shorter pereonites which lack the dense covering of setae. The cephalon and first pereonite also possess <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> spines each, though they can sometimes be absent.|$|E

40|$|An {{analysis}} of the microstructure of licking responses was used to investigate the effects of conditioning and extinguishing a taste aversion. Rats received <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>pairing</b> <b>of</b> 8 % fructose with lithium chloride (LiCl) while controls received unpaired exposure to fructose and LiCl. Pairing fructose with LiCl produced a reduction both in consumption and {{in the size of}} licking clusters. Subsequent exposure to fructose in the absence of LiCl produced some extinction of the taste aversion although at asymptote there was a residual difference in consumption between the taste aversion group and unpaired controls. In contrast the reduction in lick cluster size did completely extinguish. Previous analyses of licking microstructure indicate that lick cluster size is related to the palatability of the ingested solution. Thus these results indicate that although taste aversion learning initially reduces the palatability of the cue solution this reduction is not permanent. These results are discussed with reference to the possibility that preparatory behaviours are more resistant to extinction than are consummatory behaviours...|$|R
40|$|The present fMRI study {{tested the}} {{assumption}} that <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>pairing</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> stimulus and a logically unrelated response is sufficient for binding the corresponding stimulus and response codes into an event representation (event file) that is automatically retrieved upon processing {{of at least one}} of its components. In particular, we investigated whether repeating a face or a house stimulus and/or a left or a right manual response induces the automatic retrieval of the response or stimulus that it previously accompanied. ROI analyses of fusiform face area, parahippocampal place area, and right and left motor cortex revealed that repeating one component of a previously encountered stimulusresponse episode leads to the suppression of cortical areas processing the other components, suggesting that these components were indeed automatically retrieved and conflicted with ongoing processing. The particular pattern obtained is consistent with predictions from diffusion models of decision making, which suggest a crucial role of local competition in response selection. ...|$|R
