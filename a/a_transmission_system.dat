The bodies were built by Skabo and received a similar design to the electric Class 62. The series was delivered on 6 March, 13 April and 7 June 1932, respectively. The trains were numbered 18236 through 18237.|$|E

Batch 7 introduced <b>a</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>system</b> to the command vehicle, and a data system giving instantaneous vision of the state of all battle tanks and acquired targets. It also incorporated minor improvements in the visor. Batch 8 was a modernisation of the electronic system, and Batch 9 replaced the thermal imaging ATHOS by a SAGEM Iris with better resolution.|$|E

2500|$|The {{competition}} between AC and DC {{came to a}} head during the development of the potential of Niagara Falls because AC systems could supply electricity over much longer distances than DC systems. This was enormously important to Canada, which had numerous potential hydroelectric sites in remote locations. In 1897 <b>a</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>system</b> was built from the Batiscan River [...] to Trois-Rivières, Quebec. In 1901 Shawinigan Falls was harnessed, and by 1903 a 50,000 volt power line carried electricity from it to Montreal.|$|E

2500|$|In America, George Westinghouse who {{had become}} {{interested}} in the power transformer developed by Gaulard and Gibbs, began to develop his AC lighting system, using <b>a</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>system</b> with a 20:1 step up voltage with step-down. In 1890 Westinghouse and Stanley built a system to transmit power several miles to a mine in Colorado. A decision was taken to use AC for power transmission from the Niagara Power Project to Buffalo, New York. Proposals submitted by vendors in 1890 included DC and compressed air systems. [...] A combination DC and compressed air system remained under consideration {{until late in the}} schedule. [...] Despite the protestations of the Niagara commissioner William Thomson (Lord Kelvin) the decision was taken to build an AC system, which had been proposed by both Westinghouse and General Electric. In October 1893 Westinghouse was awarded the contract to provide the first three 5,000hp, 250 rpm, 25Hz, two phase generators.|$|E

2500|$|Only {{a quarter}} of the worlds {{estimated}} hydroelectric potential of 14,000 TWh/year has been developed, the regional potentials for the growth of hydropower around the world are, 71% Europe, 75% North America, 79% South America, 95% Africa, 95% Middle East, 82% Asia Pacific.

There is slow growth taking place in Western counties, but not in the conventional dam and reservoir style of the past. New projects take the form of run-of-the-river and small hydro, neither using large reservoirs. It is popular to repower old dams thereby increasing their efficiency and capacity as well as quicker responsiveness on the grid. Where circumstances permit existing dams like the Russell Dam built in 1985 may be updated with [...] "pump back" [...] facilities for pumped-storage which is useful for peak loads or to support intermittent wind and solar power. Countries with large hydroelectric developments like Canada and Norway are spending billions to expand their grids to trade with neighboring countries having limited hydro.|$|E
