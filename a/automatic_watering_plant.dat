But it would be a problem if the people were too busy with the job and forgot their obligations in <b>watering.</b> To make <b>plants</b> can be <b>watered</b> even <b>plant</b> owners busy, so the <b>automatic</b> <b>plant</b> <b>watering</b> machine is created. This machine connected to IoT server and consists of two sensors, The sensors are sensor for check soil moisture and sensor that is used to monitor how many liters of water that used to do watering,.

40|$|Abstract:. The paper {{deals with}} the self {{configured}} intelligent sensor networking. The individual sensors are acting on the body or an object to measure different parameters. Although the sensors are measuring parameters accurately, but they are failed to act depending on different situations. For example a robot is moving on a surface can take decision to turn left or right when an obstacle come across. But the same robots take wrong decision when the obstacle is not static. The robot can wait till the obstacle passed away from its way. But the robot still follows the traditional way, which is turning left or turn. In this case the robot is failed to take correct decision depending on the situation. If we consider other example such as traditional <b>automatic</b> <b>water</b> supply to <b>plants</b> or crops, the system supplies the water at regular intervals of time with accurate quantity. But the system takes same decisions in all seasons irrespective of the soil type and crop type. In our system we are proposing a Wireless Distributing sensor system design which is able to take wise decisions as a farmer. A farmer can understands how much water the soil needs and at what time it need to apply. In our work, we are developing, (1...|$|R

Nowadays, the developments in every fields are always increasing. One of those field is technology. Technology should give some contributions which can develop the agriculture field. One of the contribution {{that can be done}} is <b>automatic</b> <b>watering</b> system on chili, so it become easier for the farmers to control the chili. The <b>automatic</b> <b>watering</b> system use internet technology to control a device from distance. This chili’s <b>automatic</b> <b>watering</b> system based on bash shell with openWRT platform. This system was made to help farmers watering the chili automatically. The methods that used in this system can be based on the ground’s moisture, time, or manual. Ground’s moisture based method used soil moisture, that tool can measure the ground’s moisture and automatically send order to the device. This system can reduce delays of the chili’s daily treatment, so the chili’s production will be increasing.

40|$|Pollutants {{tends to}} {{accumulate}} in enclosed ponds, lakes, estuaries because the water stays {{in one place}} for many years. Water quality in such closed watef area is changed by outside disturbances (wind, solar heat, etc.). An experimental investigation of turbulent structures induced by wind action in the area which has a two layer system {{was carried out in}} a laboratory wind-wave tank. Such closed water area, on one hand, has ecosystem diversity. Especially in warm climate areas, various <b>water</b> <b>plants</b> grow by the shore of the closed water area. But it is considered that the <b>water</b> <b>plants</b> which cut a part of wind {{play an important role in}} the turbulent structures. Hence the experiments to clarify the relationship between the <b>water</b> <b>plants</b> and the turbulent structures were performed. In the experiments, the <b>water</b> <b>plants</b> imitated by a styrene foam were set afloat in a laboratory wind-wave tank. And it was divided four types by the covered rate of the imitated <b>water</b> <b>plants</b> to compare. Results of the expetiments indicate that the existence of the <b>water</b> <b>plants</b> contribute to make a significant effect on the scale of the turbulent structures. lt is also studied that an increase of the rate of the <b>water</b> <b>plants</b> reduces its scale gradually. 本研究から，浮難水草による被覆率の増大に伴って，吹送流型 2 成層流の上層の乱流エネルギーの発生および輸送が妨げられる結果を得た．また，これまでに行ってきた閉鎖性 2 成層流の連行速度に関する実験についても，乱流構造と連行現象は密接な関係を持つており，乱流エネルギーの収支を把握することによって再評価することができた．先に述べたように，湖沼や貯水池，または親水公園等において最適な水環境を創造するためには周辺の生態系を加味した水質変動の時空間的な把握が必要となっている．本研究では特に浮葉性の水草の存在を考慮することで，その水草が閉鎖性水域の水循環に与える影響を把握した．これは水質変動を予測するモデルの構築の一助となるものである...|$|R
