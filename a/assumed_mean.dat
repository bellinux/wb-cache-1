40|$|Background and Aim: Learning may be {{the only}} {{sustainable}} competitive advantage for all organizations. A learning organization is an organisation where people continually expand their capacity to create results they truly desire; new and expansive patterns of thinking are nurtured; collective aspirations are set free; people are continually learning from what others have learned. The aim of this research is to study whether a learning organization and its subsystems are established in Shahrekord University of Medical Sciences (SKUMS). Materials and Methods: This descriptive-survey study was conducted in 2012. Marquardt's standard questionnaire was used to measure learning organization based on Likert's scale with a Cronbach's Alpha coefficient of 0. 946. The research sample consisted of 177 staff members (bachelor's degree holders and bove) in seven vice-chancellorships of SKUMS, selected through simple random sampling. Results: The findings of the study are twofold. (1) According to the results of one-sample t-test with a 95 % confidence interval, the mean scores in learning organization and sub-systems of learning dynamics, people empowerment, knowledge management and technology application subsysems were higher than the <b>assumed</b> <b>mean</b> of 3; however, the figure turned out to be equal to the <b>assumed</b> <b>mean</b> for the organization transformation subsystem, and (2) Based on Freidman Test, {{there was a significant difference}} between the means of at least 2 learning organization subsystems. Conclusion: According to the research findings, more attention should be paid to the subsystems of learning organization establishment and balanced development of these subsystems...|$|E

In particular it should be noted that, unless life-time changes can be excluded, the occurrence of linear plots of reciprocal degree of polarization against the temperature/viscosity ratio does not necessarily indicate the absence of intramolecular freedoms. An attempt to correct for such life-time changes by measurement of the fluorescence intensity is made for the bovine serum albumin– 1 -dimethyl-aminonaphthalene- 5 -sulphonyl chloride system. The value of ρ/ 3 τ thus obtained for this system at 20 ° is approx. 4 · 7, as against approx. 3 · 4 obtained by several workers in the absence of life-time corrections...|$|E
