5|$|Anggun's {{image has}} been {{compared}} to that of Pocahontas. At the early stage of her career <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>rock</b> singer, Anggun was known for her tomboy look—wearing a crooked beret, shorts, studded jacket, and large belt; this set a trend during the early 1990s. Later, she has focused on femininity and sexuality, emphasising her long black hair and brown skin. For this look she utilises the work of fashion designers like Azzedine Alaïa, Dolce & Gabbana, and Roberto Cavalli. In 2001, Anggun was dubbed as the sixth Sexiest Women of Asia by FHM magazine. Later in 2010, she was ranked at number 18 on the French version of FHMs list of 100 Sexiest Women in the World.|$|E
5|$|Bass guitarist and lyricist Roger Waters {{conceived}} the album <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>rock</b> opera during Pink Floyd's 1977 In the Flesh Tour, when his {{frustration with the}} audience became so acute that he spat on them. Its story, which follows themes of abandonment and personal isolation, explores Pink, a character whom Waters modeled after himself and the band's original leader Syd Barrett. Pink's life begins {{with the loss of}} his father during the Second World War, and continues with abuse from his schoolteachers, an overprotective mother, and the breakdown of his marriage; all contribute to his eventual self-imposed isolation from society, represented by a metaphorical wall. The band, who were then struggling with personal and financial difficulties, supported the idea. The album {{is considered one of the}} most recognisable concept albums.|$|E
5|$|Imaginos was envisioned <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>rock</b> opera to be {{published}} as a trilogy of double albums, with a storyline encompassing about two hundred years of history, {{from the beginning of}} the 19th century to the end of the 20th. This album represents an abbreviated version of the first volume of that planned trilogy, but with the songs arranged out of order, rendering the story harder to comprehend. Even when the song lyrics are analyzed in the chronological order that was devised by the authors and is followed in this section, the narrative progression is scarce and the content often difficult to decipher for the casual reader. However, thanks to various comments in interviews by Pearlman and Bouchard, and the extensive sleeve notes by Pearlman that were issued with the original release, it is possible to reconstruct the story to a great extent.|$|E

5|$|The {{first edition}} of Spin Alternative Record Guide was {{published}} on October 10, 1995, by Vintage Books. It was the first book compiled by Spin. Having edited their book, Weisbard put his pursuit of a PhD at UC Berkeley on hold and accepted a job offer from the magazine, which {{marked the beginning of}} his career <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>rock</b> critic. Although the book did not sell well, its entry on 1960s folk artist John Fahey, written by Byron Coley, helped renew interest in Fahey's music. According to Ben Ratliff from The New York Times, this led to substantial interest in Fahey from record labels and the alternative music scene, helping revive his career.|$|E
5|$|This {{version of}} the Mothers debuted on Zappa's next solo album Chunga's Revenge (1970), which was {{followed}} by the double-album soundtrack to the movie 200 Motels (1971), featuring the Mothers, the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, Ringo Starr, Theodore Bikel, and Keith Moon. Co-directed by Zappa and Tony Palmer, it was filmed in a week at Pinewood Studios outside London. Tensions between Zappa and several cast and crew members arose before and during shooting. The film deals loosely with life on the road <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>rock</b> musician. It was the first feature film photographed on videotape and transferred to 35mm film, a process that allowed for novel visual effects. It was released to mixed reviews. The score relied extensively on orchestral music, and Zappa's dissatisfaction with the classical music world intensified when a concert, scheduled at the Royal Albert Hall after filming, was canceled because a representative of the venue found some of the lyrics obscene. In 1975, he lost a lawsuit against the Royal Albert Hall for breach of contract.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{being called}} the tree wasp, D. sylvestris builds both aerial nests in trees and hedges, as well as {{underground}} nests.

Northern red-backed voles frequently invade houses during the winter.|$|E
