In November 1992, Disney, Schumacher, Levine, Gelb, and Butoy met in Vienna to discuss a collection of story reels developed, one of them being Pines of Rome, which Levine took an immediate liking to. Butoy described Levine's enthusiasm toward the film as [...] "like <b>a</b> <b>kid</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> candy store".

As he grew older, his strength and size were no longer an advantage like they were in high school. Cotton became too short to be a forward, but was not quick enough to defend guards.

Cartman is distraught to {{discover}} {{that most of the}} park's attendants are people of different races, while Kyle is incredibly repulsed to learn so many people freely urinate in the pools. Based on his observance of more minorities at the park than white people, Cartman calculates there will be no white people left by the year 2012, and interprets this as a sign that Mayans accurately predicted the world would end the same year, and that the new world will be [...] "made up of minorities." [...] Annoyed by Cartman's racism, Kyle points out that since white people do not make up the majority of the park's attendance, then they are the new minority, but Cartman refuses to believe it, ignorantly thinking that a minority is someone who is [...] "black or brown." [...] At the same time, Kyle walks by an elderly man and woman and finds out that the man peed in the pool, which disgusts Kyle. A bespectacled male scientist tests the park's water and discovers it is 98% urine. He urges Pi Pi, the park's Venetian owner, to immediately close and evacuate his park, claiming the high urine content will soon trigger a cataclysmic event. Pi Pi dismisses the warning. But when <b>a</b> <b>kid</b> pees <b>in</b> <b>a</b> wave pool, the park gets overcome and destroyed by tsunamis of yellow urine and volcanic eruptions.

40|$|Taking into {{consideration}} the popularity of multiplayer games and the tremendous success of wireless networks, we strongly believe that future game engines {{will benefit from the}} integration of MANET (Mobile Ad hoc NETworks) technology [1]. Indeed, in addition to the social interests of playing with close located persons, MANET technology will allow players, like <b>a</b> group of <b>kids</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> playground, to easily improvise a LAN multiplayer party without any need for an existing wireless network infrastructure. In order to make such scenario a common based reality, several issues still have to be addressed. Among which is the MANET’s broadcast problem. In fact, broadcast is a fundamental network service for multiplayer LAN mode. But up to now, the most used scheme for broadcasting in MANET relies on flooding. Unfortunately, this simple scheme leads to high redundancy and collisions. In the context of a multiplayer party supported by mobile terminals, this broadcast storm problem [10], could result into a dramatic reduction of the network energy-based lifetime and to a high variability of the transmission delay. The latter one is know to be a crucial QoS parameter which can significantly affect the game play. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of different MANET broadcast schemes in the context of multiplayer video games. We analyze the capacity of simple flooding, distance based, probability based and self pruning broadcast schemes to satisfy the QoS constraints required by multiplayer games like FPS. Assessment simulations are conducted for both Client/Server and P 2 P network game architectures...|$|R

As a faith-based non-profit, its mission is to increase resiliency and inspire big dreams and hope for children by providing inspirational experiences and nurturing personal relationships, one child at a time. Each week, over 2, 000 children receive home visits from City Kidz volunteers. Each Saturday, over 1, 000 children attend <b>a</b> dynamic <b>kids</b> program <b>in</b> <b>a</b> classic Vaudeville theatre. City Kidz also trains interested youth “graduates” to become the next generation of volunteers. The purpose of this presentation is to share the evaluation experience of City Kidz. It was a collaborative evaluation that followed the principles of participatory action research (PAR). The presentation will focus on the process of the evaluation, in particular how stakeholder voices were engaged throughout the evaluation. Drawing on existing PAR literature, the presentation will describe the mechanisms of engagement that were used. These mechanisms included a stakeholder steering group that guided each step of the evaluation, the training and supporting of “community researchers” to assist with data gathering, a mixed method design that considered multiple stakeholder perspectives, and the facilitation of active funder involvement (World Vision Canada) towards using evaluation findings to inform the replication of City Kidz nation-wide. The presentation will also describe the products of engagement. These products were collaboratively developed, including a comprehensive evaluation framework, program logic model, community researcher training manual, qualitative and quantitative evaluation tools, and a user-friendly evaluation report. In particular, we will highlight the process of collaboratively developing the evaluation’s measures of hope. These measures drew on previous standardized tools based on theories of hope and resiliency developed by academic researchers.
