5|$|Hydro-Québec's {{electricity}} transmission system {{is an international}} power transmission system centred in Quebec, Canada. The system pioneered the use of very high voltage 735kV <b>alternating</b> <b>current</b> (<b>AC)</b> power lines that link the population centers of Montreal and Quebec City to distant hydroelectric power stations like the Daniel-Johnson Dam and the James Bay Project in northwestern Quebec and the Churchill Falls Generating Station in Labrador.|$|E
5|$|Solar panels produce {{direct current}} (DC) electricity, so solar parks need {{conversion}} equipment to convert this to <b>alternating</b> <b>current</b> (<b>AC),</b> {{which is the}} form transmitted by the electricity grid. This conversion is done by inverters. To maximise their efficiency, solar power plants also incorporate maximum power point trackers, either within the inverters or as separate units. These devices keep each solar array string close to its peak power point.|$|E
5|$|Power is {{distributed}} over multiple 500 kilovolt (kV) transmission lines. Three direct current (DC) {{lines to the}} East China Grid carry 7,200 MW: Three Gorges – Shanghai (3,000 MW), HVDC Three Gorges – Changzhou (3,000 MW), and HVDC Gezhouba – Shanghai (1,200 MW). The <b>alternating</b> <b>current</b> (<b>AC)</b> lines to the Central China Grid have a total capacity of 12,000 MW. The DC transmission line HVDC Three Gorges – Guangdong to the South China Grid has a capacity of 3,000 MW.|$|E

30|$|Low-voltage {{currents}} and high-voltage currents are equally able to cause electrocution-related fatality. However, most fatalities occurring {{in a common}} household or a minor industrial setting happen due to contact with low-voltage currents.

50|$|The {{resistance}} of a conductor at DC (0 Hz) {{depends on its}} cross-sectional area. A conductor with a larger area has a lower resistance. The resistance also depends on frequency because the effective cross-sectional area changes with frequency. For <b>alternating</b> <b>currents</b> (<b>AC),</b> the skin effect causes the resistance to increase with increasing frequency.|$|R
5|$|The {{array of}} a {{photovoltaic}} power system, or PV system, produces direct current (DC) power which fluctuates with the sunlight's intensity. For practical use this usually requires conversion to certain desired voltages or <b>alternating</b> <b>current</b> (<b>AC),</b> {{through the use}} of inverters. Multiple solar cells are connected inside modules. Modules are wired together to form arrays, then tied to an inverter, which produces power at the desired voltage, and for AC, the desired frequency/phase.|$|E
5|$|Born {{and raised}} in the Austrian Empire, Tesla {{received}} an advanced education in engineering and physics in the 1870s and gained practical experience in the early 1880s working in telephony and at Continental Edison in the new electric power industry. He emigrated to the United States in 1884, where he would become a naturalized citizen. He worked for a short time at the Edison Machine Works in New York City before he struck out on his own. With the help of partners to finance and market his ideas, Tesla set up laboratories and companies in New York to develop a range of electrical and mechanical devices. His <b>alternating</b> <b>current</b> (<b>AC)</b> induction motor and related polyphase AC patents, licensed by Westinghouse Electric in 1888, earned him a considerable amount of money and became the cornerstone of the polyphase system which that company would eventually market.|$|E
5|$|In {{engineering}} or household applications, {{current is}} often described as being either direct current (DC) or <b>alternating</b> <b>current</b> (<b>AC).</b> These terms refer to how the current varies in time. Direct current, as produced by example from a battery and required by most electronic devices, is a unidirectional flow from the positive part of a circuit to the negative. If, as is most common, this flow is carried by electrons, they will be travelling in the opposite direction. Alternating current is any current that reverses direction repeatedly; almost always this {{takes the form of a}} sine wave. Alternating current thus pulses back and forth within a conductor without the charge moving any net distance over time. The time-averaged value of an alternating current is zero, but it delivers energy in first one direction, and then the reverse. Alternating current is affected by electrical properties that are not observed under steady state direct current, such as inductance and capacitance. These properties however can become important when circuitry is subjected to transients, such as when first energised.|$|E
40|$|The main {{objective}} was to study the treatment of wastewater generated by the oil industry. This work consisted of tests of electroflocculation with <b>alternate</b> <b>current</b> (<b>AC),</b> and chemical coagulation. The removal efficiencies of organic load were evaluated by the removal of oils and greases, color and turbidity. The parameters investigated were the change in <b>alternate</b> <b>current</b> frequency, the initial pH, the distance between electrodes, the applied potential and time lapse. From the results, one may conclude that the electroflocculation process is potential applicability to the effluent studied, while chemical coagulation was not successful...|$|R

Various distributed generation (DG) units {{are connected to the}} <b>alternate</b> <b>current</b> (<b>AC)</b> grid via pulse width modulation (PWM) based voltage-source converters (VSCs) [1, 2]. In addition, VSCs are also applied in grid-connected energy storage (ES) systems and are even used as commutation components in high-voltage DC (HVDC) transmission [3, 4, 5]. Consequently, VSCs are gaining a vital role in the modern power system.|$|R

30|$|As we know, JPEG image {{compression}} {{is divided into}} the following steps: 8 × 8 block extraction, DCT transform, quantization, and coding. An original uncompressed image is first partitioned into 8 × 8 pixel blocks. Then each block is converted to frequency space by a 2 D DCT. The value located in the upper-left corner of the block is called direct currentcoefficient, and the other 63 values are called <b>alternate</b> <b>current</b> (<b>AC)</b> coefficients. Next, each block DCT coefficients are quantized by the JPEG quantization table.|$|R
40|$|Silicon {{nanowires}} are label-free {{sensors that}} allow real-time measurements. They are economical and pave {{the road for}} point-of-care applications but require complex readout and skilled personnel. We propose a new model and technique for sensing nanowire sensors using <b>alternating</b> <b>currents</b> (<b>AC)</b> to capture both magnitude and phase information from the sensor. This approach combines the advantages of complex impedance spectroscopy with the noise reduction performances of lock-in techniques. Experimental results show how modifications of the sensors with different surface chemistries lead to the same direct-current (DC) response but can be discerned using the AC approach...|$|R
30|$|Temperature-modulated DSC {{is a type}} of DSC {{attached}} with the <b>alternate</b> <b>current</b> (<b>AC)</b> calorimetry where two types of heat flows are coinstantaneously obtained from not only constant heating/cooling temperature programs but also perturbation temperature programs with small amplitude and periods. By superimposing temperature oscillations on a constant heating/cooling rate, temperature-modulated DSC enables the heat flow to be divided into different components associated with the heat capacity and other kinetic processes [10 – 12]. This technique can be used to obtain a lot of information about glass transition phenomena and other kinetic processes in wood for temperatures that are applicable to practical applications.|$|R
