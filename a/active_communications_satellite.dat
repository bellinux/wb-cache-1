25|$|A {{communications}} satellite is an artificial satellite stationed in {{space for the}} purposes of telecommunications. Modern {{communications satellite}}s use a variety of orbits. For fixed point-to-point services, communications satellites provide a microwave radio relay technology complementary to that of submarine communication cables. Invented in 1962 by the American aerospace engineer John Robinson Pierce, NASA launched Telstar, the world's first <b>active</b> <b>communications</b> <b>satellite,</b> and the first satellite designed to transmit telephone and high-speed data communications. Its name is still used to this day for a number of television broadcasting satellites.|$|E

50|$|SCORE's {{technical}} {{objectives were}} two-fold. In addition to showing that an Atlas missile, {{a hundred times}} more massive than any previous US satellite, could be put into orbit, the project demonstrated the feasibility of transmitting messages through the upper atmosphere from one ground station {{to one or more}} ground stations. The result of the project, which used both real-time and store and forward techniques, was a major scientific breakthrough which proved that <b>active</b> <b>communications</b> <b>satellites</b> could provide a means of transmitting messages from one point to any other on Earth.|$|R

All 12 launches occurred from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Launch Complex 17. The launch of Telstar 1 used pad B, while all other launches were from pad A. All launches were successful except the maiden flight, which failed to place Echo 1 into orbit due a problem with the second stage.|$|R
50|$|In 1954, Gerald Pearson, Darryl Chapin and Calvin Fuller {{invented the}} solar cell. Telstar, the first <b>active</b> <b>communications</b> <b>satellite</b> also {{developed}} by Bell Labs and launched in 1962, used these solar cell batteries as an external renewable {{source of power}} once launched.

50|$|Three large orbit {{rings of}} {{stainless}} steel encircle the Unisphere at various angles. These orbit rings are believed to represent the tracks of Yuri Gagarin, the first man in space, John Glenn, the first American to orbit the Earth, and Telstar, the first <b>active</b> <b>communications</b> <b>satellite.</b> In fact, the early design {{was to have a}} ring for each of a dozen satellites in place {{at the time of the}} Fair. This proved impractical, not only in the number of satellites, but also in the height of their orbits and the fact that geostationary satellites had no orbit path. As a result, a symbolic number of three was chosen for aesthetic reasons.|$|E

50|$|There are {{two major}} classes of <b>communications</b> <b>{{satellites}},</b> passive and <b>active.</b> Passive satellites only reflect the signal coming from the source, toward {{the direction of the}} receiver. With passive satellites, the reflected signal is not amplified at the satellite, and only a very small amount of the transmitted energy actually reaches the receiver. Since the satellite is so far above Earth, the radio signal is attenuated due to free-space path loss, so the signal received on Earth is very, very weak. Active satellites, on the other hand, amplify the received signal before retransmitting it to the receiver on the ground. Passive satellites were the first <b>communications</b> <b>satellites,</b> but are little used now.Telstar was the second <b>active,</b> direct relay <b>communications</b> <b>satellite.</b> Belonging to AT&T as part of a multi-national agreement between AT&T, Bell Telephone Laboratories, NASA, the British General Post Office, and the French National PTT (Post Office) to develop <b>satellite</b> <b>communications,</b> it was launched by NASA from Cape Canaveral on July 10, 1962, in the first privately sponsored space launch. Relay 1 was launched on December 13, 1962, and it became the first satellite to transmit across the Pacific Ocean on November 22, 1963.|$|R
40|$|Some {{results of}} a study on <b>active</b> antennas for <b>communications</b> <b>satellites</b> are presented. A {{comparison}} between the performances of the antenna system in the two cases of a beam forming network (BFN) at low (IF) or high (RF) frequency is carried out, {{and the results are}} presented. The comparison is performed {{from the point of view}} of total weight, size, bandwidth, and reliability for a near-field multibeam antenna covering Western Europe. In the case of a low-frequency BFN the system is formed by a diode matrix followed by 37 chains of two cascaded mixers for the two-step up-conversion. The prevailing mass contribution comes from the mixers, even if they are refunded, while the use of the active matrix has the greater impact on reliability and bandwidth limitation. In the case of a high-frequency BFN the single or double (cascaded) bank of 14 mixers is followed by a hybrid BFN. The mixers, even if fully redundant and with a two-step up-conversion, are fewer in number, and therefore lighter, than in the previous case, while the reliability is ensured to a good level...|$|R
