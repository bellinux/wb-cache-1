25|$|Like the {{majority}} of his contemporaries, he worked mostly in the ōban tate-e format. There <b>are</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> number of single panel series, as well as many other prints in this format which are not a part of any series.|$|E
25|$|There are {{education}} facilities for foreign residents, though foreign nationals are not {{accepted in the}} public schools of Ethiopia.

25|$|There <b>are</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> few guitar solos on this album. To be honest, I've {{never really}} classed {{myself as a}} lead player as such, {{but this is the}} first time I've sat down and seriously practiced lead work. I've been so {{involved}} in actually writing new material and coming up with song structures that I haven't had time to practice all the frilly things that go on top of it. Up 'till now, there hasn't really been much room for guitar solos as such. The riffs we write, they're not riffs that are meant to be soloed on top of. They're melodic within themselves. But I'm a great believer that less is definitely more. I love listening to all the shreddy, widdly stuff, but I have no interest in playing it. This new album is quite guitar-orientated. The last album was, but this is definitely more melodic. Dare I say it, there <b>are</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> lot of typical Maiden-esque harmonies in there.|$|E
25|$|There <b>are</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> {{few players}} {{like me who}} did really well early in their careers, but didn't {{consolidate}} later on. I guess it is like climbing the highest peak on your first climb - {{where do you go}} from there, where is the next peak? Players these days have a great support network around them to guide them through that sort of stuff.|$|E
25|$|As for {{the less}} {{quantifiable}} differences—mainly {{to do with the}} content, and of which there <b>are</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> lot—Marlovians suggest that they are quite predictable, given that under their scenario Marlowe would have undergone a significant transformation of his life—with new locations, new experiences, new learning, new interests, new friends and acquaintances, possibly a new political agenda, new paymasters, new performance spaces, new actors, and maybe (not all agree on this) a new collaborator, Shakespeare himself.|$|E

25|$|During {{the period}} of Ayya Vaikundar the lower caste people of the South Travancore {{are not allowed to}} enter the temples. So they erected small pyramids of mud or brick and use to worship them. Ayya found these practises as uncivilised custom and put forward a new way of worship. This serves as a {{religious}} reformation in the socio-cultural history of South Travancore. There <b>are</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> large number of verses in the Ayyavazhi scriptures on strengthening this view of Vaikundar.|$|E
25|$|Amphibians include {{numerous}} toads and frogs in the American Southwest. Toads {{which can}} be found in the region include: the Great Plains toad (Anaxyrus cognatus); the green toad (Anaxyrus debilis); the Arizona toad (Anaxyrus microscaphus); the New Mexico spadefoot (Spea multiplicata stagnalis); and the Colorado River toad (Incilius alvarius), also known as the Sonoran Desert toad. Frog representation includes: western barking frog (Craugastor augusti); the canyon tree frog (Hyla arenicolor); the Arizona treefrog (Hyla wrightorum); the western chorus frog (Pseudacris triseriata); Chiricahua leopard frog (Lithobates chiricahuensis); and the relict leopard frog (Lithobates onca). There <b>are</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> few salamanders throughout the region, including: the Arizona tiger salamander (Ambystoma mavortium nebulosum) and the painted ensatina (Ensatina eschscholtzii picta).|$|E
25|$|Because of the {{controversy}} over Westropp's Mesolithic and Mortillet's Gap beginning in 1872 archaeological attention focused mainly on the revolution at the Palaeolithic—Neolithic boundary as {{an explanation of the}} gap. For a few decades the Neolithic Period, as it was called, was described as a kind of revolution. In the 1890s, a standard term, the Neolithic Revolution, began to appear in encyclopedias such as Pears. In 1925 the Cambridge Ancient History reported:There <b>are</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> large number of archaeologists who justifiably consider the period of the Late Stone Age to be a neolithic revolution and an economic revolution at the same time. For that is the period when primitive agriculture developed and cattle breeding began.|$|E

25|$|There <b>are</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> few {{different}} dielectrics {{that can}} be chosen to provide different insulating values depending on {{the requirements of the}} circuit. Some of these dielectrics are polytetrafluoroethylene (Teflon), FR-4, FR-1, CEM-1 or CEM-3. Well known pre-preg materials used in the PCB industry are FR-2 (phenolic cotton paper), FR-3 (cotton paper and epoxy), FR-4 (woven glass and epoxy), FR-5 (woven glass and epoxy), FR-6 (matte glass and polyester), G-10 (woven glass and epoxy), CEM-1 (cotton paper and epoxy), CEM-2 (cotton paper and epoxy), CEM-3 (non-woven glass and epoxy), CEM-4 (woven glass and epoxy), CEM-5 (woven glass and polyester). Thermal expansion is an important consideration especially with ball grid array (BGA) and naked die technologies, and glass fiber offers the best dimensional stability.|$|E
25|$|There <b>are</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> {{large number}} of local weekly newspapers, with most {{counties}} and large towns having two or more newspapers. In Munster the Evening Echo, published in separate editions for Cork and Limerick, is a daily local newspaper. Curiously Dublin {{remains one of the}} few places in Ireland without a major local paper; The Dublin Evening Mail having closed down in the 1960s. The Evening Herald markets itself from time to time as a Dublin local newspaper, however it is distributed nationally. In 2003 the Dublin Daily was launched, but failed to attract enough readers to make it viable, and closed after 90 issues and a full rebrand as the Dublin Evening. In 2008, a number of local papers have been launched by the Gazette Group.|$|E
25|$|There <b>are</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> few drug therapies {{that are}} {{possible}} for Parkinson's disease (ex. Sinemet). Since {{there is no}} cure for it, the patient will probably end up having to have surgery done to relieve some of the symptoms. When a patient has this procedure done, they are most likely going to receive a deep brain stimulation. So it will keep the brain stimulated even though the disease tries to disable it. Recently a study was performed to test if surgery helps the patients discover their symptoms post surgery than pre-surgery. They found that the symptoms were still present but the patients were more aware of their difficulties than before they had surgery. This shows that surgery does improve a patients speech perception, even though it might not cure their disease.|$|E
