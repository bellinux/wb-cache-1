5|$|Waddesdon Manor was {{complete}} in 1889, 13 years after construction began. The Winchendon Branch closed <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>track</b> was removed. The gasworks remained operational, although supplied by road, until its closure during the coal shortage of 1916. It was demolished shortly afterwards.

5|$|A small {{gasworks}} a {{short distance}} {{to the south of}} Westcott station opened in 1889 to provide power to Waddesdon Manor and to other buildings on the Rothschild's estate. A short spur line was built from Westcott station to the gasworks, running immediately parallel to the road south from Westcott village. In 1926 the gasworks closed and was replaced by an electrical generator elsewhere on the Waddesdon Manor grounds, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>track</b> of the spur was removed.|$|E
5|$|After a {{temporary}} closure between October 1951 and January 1952, British Railways (the {{successor to the}} LNER) ended passenger services between Finsbury Park and Alexandra Palace permanently on 3 July 1954. British Rail freight traffic continued {{to pass through the}} station until 1964. After freight traffic ceased, the line continued to be used for occasional London Underground rolling stock transfers between Highgate depot and the Northern City line, with the stock being pulled over the unelectrified lines by battery locomotives. This ceased in 1970 because of the poor condition of some of the intermediate bridges, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>track</b> was lifted through the surface platforms in 1972.|$|E
5|$|By this time, {{the route}} from Quainton Road to Brill was in severe decline. Competition from the newer lines and from {{improving}} road haulage had drawn away {{much of the}} tramway's custom, and the trains would often run without a single passenger. The A Class locomotives were now 70 years old, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>track</b> itself was poorly maintained. Trains, once again, were regularly derailing on the line.|$|E

5|$|Cloverleaf {{announced}} Rosecroft {{would close}} on July 1, 2010. Live racing ended in 2009, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>track</b> only had simulcasts as revenue from off-track betting. After {{several of the}} surrounding states legalized casinos, Rosecroft was unable to continue as a successful business. Cloverleaf Enterprises filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in June 2009. Mark Vogel loaned the track $350,000 and offered to buy the track, but a bankruptcy court judge refused to approve the plan. Rosecroft officials had hoped that the Maryland General Assembly would approve legislation allowing casino-style gambling at Rosecroft, {{but that did not}} occur. In early June 2010, Cloverleaf filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy.|$|E
5|$|Discussions {{regarding}} {{the building of}} a line through Lier started in 1895, and construction commenced in 1901. The line opened on 12 July 1904 and was initially profitable, in part because of tourist traffic. In 1920, the Drammen Line was converted to standard gauge, resulting in expensive transshipment between the two lines. This and falling traffic caused the line to become unprofitable. The Lier line was closed for ordinary traffic on 23 October 1932. All traffic ceased on 1 January 1937 <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>track</b> was demolished shortly afterwards.|$|E
5|$|During the Olympics, {{transport}} {{was in part}} {{provided by}} Vikingskipet Station on the Røros Line, which passes {{right next to the}} venue. The station is a cul-de-sac station which is electrified and allowed trains during the Olympics <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Track</b> Cycling World Championships to reach the venue within a short walk from the train. The station was officially opened on 16 August 1993. The station has not been used since the Olympics. In 2006, the Norwegian National Rail Administration proposed re-opening the station in conjunction with larger events.|$|E

25|$|This line {{then turns}} south {{to go under}} Sixth Avenue, merging with the branch from 57th Street and a {{connection}} to the IND Queens Boulevard Line (used by the M train) to become a four-track line. <b>The</b> southbound <b>track</b> becomes <b>the</b> westernmost <b>track,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> northbound <b>track</b> becomes <b>the</b> second <b>track</b> from <b>the</b> east; the other lines merge to become <b>the</b> second <b>track</b> from <b>the</b> west <b>and</b> <b>the</b> easternmost <b>track,</b> with connections only between the 63rd Street Line <b>and</b> <b>the</b> two main <b>tracks.</b> After passing through 47th–50th Streets–Rockefeller Center, <b>the</b> two southbound <b>tracks</b> cross; <b>the</b> main <b>tracks</b> become <b>the</b> two center express <b>tracks</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>tracks</b> from <b>the</b> other lines are the two outside local tracks.|$|R

5|$|In 1947, the velodrome {{was removed}} <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>track</b> {{converted}} for use for speedway. For the 1952 Winter Olympics, the venue was upgraded {{with a new}} ice hockey clock, a new lighting system and new ice hockey boards. The speedway course was dismounted in 1968. During the 1980s, the stadium became a central location for drug dealing, but the traffic moved away during the 1990s. In 1985, artificial ice was laid north of the football pitch, costing 2.1 million Norwegian krone (NOK). Of this, NOK1.3 million was financed by Grüner IL through loans. At {{the same time a}} new gravel pitch was laid on the football field.|$|E
5|$|In December 2006 and January 2007, {{during the}} off-season, both zero-G rolls {{were removed from}} the ride. The rolls were a problem due to {{concerns}} of occasional stalling caused by a failure of the tower's LIMs. The rolls were replaced by a slightly banked inclined S-curve. Batman's train had its shells painted red so Robin could be ready to open first before Batman. This was done because Robin was more reliable than Batman <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>track</b> replacement for Robin was completed first on March 13. It re-opened on April 7. Batman's track was replaced between April 16 and April 20, while the park was closed. However, Batman never re-opened.|$|E
5|$|In the 1970s, the {{eastbound}} Circle line platform {{was taken}} out of use <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>track</b> layout was rearranged to remove the westbound Circle line track and widen the island platform. The eastbound Circle and District lines both serve {{the north side of the}} island platform and the westbound Circle line which was redirected to serve the south side of the island platform. The disused platform is used for Art on the Underground installations, often placed into the brick recesses in the northern retaining wall. In the 1990s a deck was constructed above the District and Circle line platforms on which was constructed a shopping mall and apartment building.|$|E

5|$|Like his predecessor, Bill Dellinger's {{involvement}} with the University of Oregon began before his coaching career. He lettered in track at the university, graduating in 1956 and won a Bronze medal in the 1964 Summer Olympics. After his athletic career, he joined Bowerman's staff in 1967 {{as an assistant coach}} where he helped coach Steve Prefontaine. He took over as head coach in 1973 after Bowerman's retirement. With Dellinger at the helm, Oregon's Cross Country team brought home four NCAA national championships <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>track</b> and field team brought home one NCAA national championship. He retired in 1998. The Bill Dellinger Invitational is an annual race held at Hayward Field in honor of the coach.|$|E
5|$|Major {{repair work}} was done in 2003 and 2006, when the Victorian {{drainage}} culvert was replaced <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>track</b> lowered to allow access for larger passenger and freight stock {{at a cost of}} £10million. The 16 closed airshafts were deteriorating and had to be re-capped. In 2003 the excavated material from the works was recycled to shore up the railway embankment near Castley.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the Lillehammer Olympics, {{there was}} no {{bobsleigh}} and luge track in Norway. During the 1952 Winter Olympics in Oslo, Korketrekkeren had been built as a temporary venue, but {{it was made of}} snow and was not reused after the Olympics. In its bid for the 1994 Winter Olympics, Lillehammer had proposed placing the bobsleigh and luge track next to Balbergbakken in Fåberg. By May 1989, plans for most of the venues were being reshuffled <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>track</b> was then proposed located at Kanthaugen as part of an Olympic Park at Stampesletta. The Kanthaugen proposal was estimated to cost NOK231 million.|$|E

50|$|After German reunification in 1990, Meerane {{station was}} also stop for express, D and InterRegio trains {{for a short}} time. In the 1993/94 timetable, the long-distance train pairs, D 2058/59 (Chemnitz-Erfurt/Weimar-Chemnitz) and IR 2550/51 (Chemnitz-Aachen and return) stopped in Meerane. There was, however, {{a sharp drop in}} freight traffic. After 2000, the {{equipment}} for handling freight <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>tracks</b> that were no longer needed were closed <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>tracks</b> were dismantled.|$|R
