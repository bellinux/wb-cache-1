Little work, however, has focused on perceived <b>acceptance</b> <b>for</b> subgroups within the gay community or broader society. Using interviews (n = 20) and a survey (n = 202) of gay and bisexual men in a mid-sized Canadian city, we find perceived hierarchies of <b>acceptance</b> <b>for</b> the various subgroups as well as an age effect wherein middle-aged men perceive the least <b>acceptance</b> <b>for</b> all groups. These differences are linked with the uneven impact of social, political, and institutional changes relevant to gay and bisexual men in Canada...|$|R

We find that female consumers show high <b>acceptance</b> <b>for</b> some functional dairy products, such as yogurt enriched with calcium, fiber and probiotics. <b>Acceptance</b> <b>for</b> functional dairy products increases among consumers with higher diet/health related knowledge, {{as well as with}} aging. General interest in health, food-neophobia and perceived self-efficacy seem also to contribute shaping the <b>acceptance</b> <b>for</b> functional dairy products. Furthermore, products with “natural” matches between carriers and ingredients have the highest level of acceptance among consumers. Last, we find that brand familiarity drives consumers with low interest in health to increase their <b>acceptance</b> and preference <b>for</b> health enhanced dairy products, such as probiotic yogurts, or those with a general function claim...|$|R

40|$|Objective: There {{is concern}} {{about the extent to}} which {{consumers}} will accept genetically modified (GM) foods in China. Existing studies are mostly inconsistent and sometimes confusing. Although China produced and consumed the biggest amount of GM crops and other derived products, there were only limited studies about Chinese public <b>acceptance</b> <b>for</b> GM foods. This review was aimed to explore the public <b>acceptance</b> <b>for</b> GM food in China and reasons <b>for</b> <b>acceptance</b> or against <b>for</b> GM food. Methods: Literature were retrieved from Google Scholar, Pubmed and CNKI using key words of "genetically modified food" (OR "GM food" OR "GMO Food" OR "GM foods") combined with "acceptance" (OR “attitude” OR “willingness to buy”). Consumers' knowledge and understanding about GM food, attitudes and <b>acceptance</b> <b>for</b> GM food as well as factors or reasons associated with their attitudes or acceptance were synthesized. Result: Of 1000 literature retrieved from the specified data sources, 20 were eligible to be included in this study. Generally, knowledge and understanding of GM food was limited among Chinese consumers. However, <b>acceptance</b> <b>for</b> GM food were generally positive among the Chinese consumers, around 60 %- 80 % according to the studies included in this review. Factors associated with <b>acceptance</b> <b>for</b> GM food included price of GM food, respondents' demographics, government attitudes and media coverage. Conclusion: The Chinese government should better communicate the risk and benefits associated GM food to improve acceptance of GM food. Communication should target subgroups of consumers to improve their knowledge and perceived benefits of GM food. Labeling of GM food should also be implemented in China to help the consumers to make a better choice. published_or_final_versionPublic HealthMasterMaster of Public Healt...|$|R
