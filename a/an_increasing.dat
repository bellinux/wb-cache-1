5|$|After the Second World War the {{historical}} analysis of British castles {{was dominated by}} Arnold Taylor, R. Allen Brown and D. J. Cathcart King. These academics made use of a growing amount of archaeological evidence, as the 1940s saw <b>an</b> <b>increasing</b> number of excavations of motte and bailey castles, {{and the number of}} castle excavations as a whole went on to double during the 1960s. With <b>an</b> <b>increasing</b> number of castle sites under threat in urban areas, a public scandal in 1972 surrounding the development of the Baynard's Castle site in London contributed to reforms and a re-prioritisation of funding for rescue archaeology. Despite this the number of castle excavations fell between 1974 and 1984, with the archaeological work focusing on conducting excavations on a greater number of small-scale, but fewer large-scale sites. The study of British castles remained primarily focused on analysing their military role, however, drawing on the evolutionary model of improvements suggested by Thompson earlier in the century.|$|E
