50|$|In {{her work}} Influences of Geographic Environment on the Basis of Ratzel's System of <b>Anthropo-Geography</b> (1911), she {{describes}} {{people and their}} associated landscapes, dividing the world into key environmental types. Semple identifies four key ways that the physical environment: 1) direct physical effects (climate, altitude); 2) psychical effects (culture, art, religion); 3) {{economic and social development}} (resources and livelihoods); 4) movement of people (natural barriers and routes, such as mountains and rivers).|$|E
40|$|The idea of {{developing}} a theoretical conception for explaining anthropogene structures and processes in space and time, reverts to the early 1960 ´s, when I discovered latent rotation effects {{in the course of}} an investigation of population and traffic movement in various West German cities (D. FLIEDNER, 1962 a). However, at the time I was not yet in a position to interpret these "cyclonic tendencies" as the expression of an universal phenomenon. Having subsequently been engaged in various historical geographic investigations, I felt it appropriate to take up the theme once again. I found further encouragement in numerous stimulating discussions with my brother, Dr. Siegfried Fliedner, Bremen, on basic and methodological problems concerning the complex of questions dealt with here. This treatise should be seen as an attempt by an anthropo-geographer to recognize phenomena, structures and processes in the scientific environment he is familiar with, to bring them into proper perspective and to understand their underlying basic order. During the course of this work it very soon became evident that a limitation of these considerations to anthropo-geographical facts and circumstances in the traditional sense could not lead to success. The fact that the conventional structure of science is rooted in a different conception of reality sometimes proved to be an impediment to a more comprehensive theoretical interpretation. Thus, it was necessary in several points to venture far beyond the limits of geography. Of course, the further away I moved from <b>anthropo-geography,</b> going on into related branches, the more difficult it became to evaluate the facts. However, this had to be the course of procedure, as it was also a matter of breaking the spell of isolation surrounding more or less every scientist in his own discipline. May my colleagues involved in related sciences or in those branches touched upon in this treatise not regard my exposition as an encroachment on their domain...|$|E
40|$|Since the {{establishment}} of the Sian Ka 2 ̆ 7 an Biosphere Reserve in the Zona Maya of Quintana Roo in 1986, the communities in the “buffer zone” of the reserve have been subjects of several initiatives to change or to alter their livelihood practices. These initiatives and programs come from a particular perspective that is not necessarily compatible with the local Maya worldview, and embodies a clash of viewpoints so characteristic of globalization and localizations. In addition to biodiversity conservation programs, the region is heavily influenced by the tourism boom from Cancún to Tulum. Today, the Mayas of central Quintana Roo are caught between the discourses and practices of tourism and biodiversity conservation both of which are transforming their everyday life. The consequences are not only economic and environmental, but also extend to issues of negotiating culture, identities, and ‘being Maya’ as well as of inclusion and exclusion of local indigenous communities within the Mexican national space. ^ The general aim of this dissertation research project is to make a multi-sited ethnography of Mexican environmentalism and conservation policies as well as conflicts over the management of natural resources in the Sian Ka 2 ̆ 7 an Biosphere Reserve and the Zona Maya, in central Quintana Roo, Mexico, between Mayan communities (descendents of the rebels of the 19 th century Caste War of Yucatan), local environmental NGO 2 ̆ 7 s, Mexican natural resource managers, and the United Nations Development Program. The use of what I call a critical <b>anthropo-geography</b> perspective is intended to highlight this work as mainly anthropological but with a focus on socio-spatial relations by incorporating insights from cultural geography. I assess how these actors, with different understandings of place, nature, and sustainability negotiate the future of the area through the implementation of biodiversity conservation projects that aim to provide alternative practices to maintain and manage the natural resources of the region specifically in regard to traditional milpa agriculture and hunting. The contestation of these meanings are key to understanding recent development of the Zona Maya. I also examine how Mayan notions of local knowledge of their environment through participant observation and surveys to assess how it changes as they incorporate or resist new conservation practices. ^ The purpose is to identify not only seemingly irresolvable conflict but also areas of consensus, while identifying factors that contribute to the discourse dynamics between these groups. In addition, I will examine how knowledge and ideas about place, nature, and sustainability are produced and reproduced. Finally, my research will assess the ‘impact’ of the biodiversity conservation projects on local populations with regards to ethnic, gender, and class relations and how they are included or excluded from the development process and how this process is contested by the local population. ...|$|E
