500|$|Section 5 {{and most}} other special {{provisions}} apply to jurisdictions encompassed by the [...] "coverage formula" [...] prescribed in Section 4(b). The coverage formula was originally designed to encompass jurisdictions that engaged in egregious voting discrimination in 1965, and Congress updated the formula in 1970 and 1975. In Shelby County v. Holder (2013), the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the coverage formula as unconstitutional, reasoning {{that it was no}} longer responsive to current conditions. The Court did not strike down Section 5, but without <b>a</b> <b>coverage</b> formula, Section 5 is unenforceable.|$|E

However, a U.S. judge found that the Aetna CEO misrepresented why his company was leaving the exchanges; {{an important part of}} the reason was the Justice Department's opposition to the intended merger between Aetna and Humana. Aetna announced that it would exit the exchange market in all remaining states. It stated that its losses had grown from $100M in 2014 to $450M in 2016. Wellmark withdrew from Iowa in April. As of May, no insurer had indicated its intention to offer ACA insurance in Nebraska. Also in May Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Kansas City announced it would withdraw from Missouri and Kansas's individual markets in 2018, potentially leaving nearly 19,000 residents in Western Missouri without <b>a</b> <b>coverage</b> option. Anthem announced plans to withdraw from Ohio and later Wisconsin and Indiana, describing the market as [...] "volatile" [...] and referring to the difficulty in pricing its plans [...] "due to the shrinking individual market as well as continual changes in federal operations, rules and guidance." ...|$|E

However, if {{a property}} has <b>a</b> debt <b>coverage</b> ratio of more than 1, the property does generate enough revenue to cover annual debt payments. For example, a property with <b>a</b> debt <b>coverage</b> ratio of 1.5 generates enough income to pay all of the annual debt expenses, all of the operating expenses and actually generates fifty percent more income than is required to pay these bills.|$|R

2500|$|Geodatabases in ArcGIS can {{be stored}} in three {{different}} ways – as a [...] "file geodatabase", a [...] "personal geodatabase", or an [...] "ArcSDE geodatabase". [...] Introduced at 9.2, the file geodatabase stores information in a folder named with a [...]gdb extension. The insides look similar to that of <b>a</b> <b>coverage</b> but is not, in fact, <b>a</b> <b>coverage.</b> Similar to the personal geodatabase, the file geodatabase only supports a single editor. However, unlike the personal geodatabase, there is virtually no size limit. By default, any single table cannot exceed 1TB, but this can be changed. [...] Personal geodatabases store data in Microsoft Access files, using a BLOB field to store the geometry data. [...] The OGR library is able to handle this file type, to convert it to other file formats. [...] Database administration tasks for personal geodatabases, such as managing users and creating backups, can be done through ArcCatalog. [...] Personal geodatabases, which are based on Microsoft Access, run only on Microsoft Windows and have a 2 gigabyte size limit. [...] Enterprise (multi-user) level geodatabases are handled using ArcSDE, which interfaces with high-end DBMS such as PostgreSQL, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, DB2 and Informix to handle database management aspects, while ArcGIS deals with spatial data management. [...] Enterprise level geodatabases support database replication, versioning and transaction management, and are cross-platform compatible, able to run on Linux, Windows, and Solaris.|$|E
2500|$|The first regular radio {{broadcasts}} of VFA games {{were made by}} 3XY, a little after the station commenced operations in 1935. The commentator was former Geelong VFL player Wallace [...] "Jumbo" [...] Sharland who had earlier {{been the first to}} describe VFL matches, that being on 3AR in 1923. In 1954 3AK began broadcasting VFA games, albeit only for a season or two. The 1970s also saw broadcasts on 3UZ, and local Geelong station, 3GL, broadcast all Geelong West matches. In 1982, the then-dominant Melbourne sports radio station, 3AW, broadcast the Grand Final. In 2003, 3AK evolved into sports radio station SEN 1116, and provided <b>a</b> <b>coverage</b> of VFL matches, but this was discontinued after they won the rights to broadcast the AFL (Australian Football League) from the 2007 season. In the 2007 and 2008 seasons, Radio 1611 Double X began broadcasting VFL matches. The station was the first to podcast replays.|$|E
2500|$|The SR-72, the {{proposed}} {{successor to the}} SR-71 Blackbird retired in 1998, is expected to fill what is considered <b>a</b> <b>coverage</b> gap between surveillance satellites, manned aircraft, and unmanned aerial vehicles for intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) and strike missions. With the growth of anti-satellite weapons, anti-access/area denial tactics, and counter-stealth technologies, a high-speed aircraft could penetrate protected airspace and observe or strike a target before enemies could detect or intercept it. The proposed reliance on extremely high speed to penetrate defended airspace is considered a significant conceptual departure from the emphasis on stealth in fifth-generation jet fighter programs and projected drone developments. There were unconfirmed reports about the SR-72 dating back to 2007, when various sources disclosed that Lockheed Martin was developing an airplane able to fly six times {{the speed of sound}} or [...] for the United States Air Force. Skunk Works' development work on the SR-72 was first published by Aviation Week & Space Technology on 1 November 2013. Public attention to the news was large enough to overwhelm the Aviation Week servers.|$|E

2500|$|There are 6 billion base pairs in the diploid human genome. Statistical {{analysis}} {{reveals that}} <b>a</b> <b>coverage</b> of approximately ten times {{is required to}} get coverage of both alleles in 90% human genome from 25 base pair reads with shotgun sequencing. This means a total of 60billion base pairs that must be sequenced. An Applied Biosystems SOLiD, Illumina or Helicos sequencing machine can sequence 2 to 10 billion base pairs in each $8,000 to $18,000 run. The cost must also take into account personnel costs, data processing costs, legal, communications and other costs. One way to assess this is via commercial offerings. [...] The first such whole diploid genome sequencing (6 billion bp, 3 billion from each parent) was from Knome and their price dropped from $350,000 in 2008 to $99,000 in 2009. [...] This inspects 3000-fold more bases of the genome than SNP chip-based genotyping, identifying both novel and known sequence variants, some relevant to personal health or ancestry. [...] In June 2009, Illumina announced the launch of its own Personal Full Genome Sequencing Service {{at a depth of}} 30X for $48,000 per genome. In 2010, they cut the price to $19,500.|$|E
2500|$|As a U.S. Congressman, Price voted {{multiple}} times {{to repeal the}} Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as well as portions of the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010. Price introduced his first post-Obamacare bill as early as 2009, thereafter reintroducing updated versions in every Congress since that point. In May 2015, as House Budget Committee chairman, Price released health care legislation which was described by Bill Kristol of the National Review as [...] "the strongest Obamacare alternative offered in Congress to date." [...] Greg Sargent of the Washington Post wrote of the bill, [...] "it's {{good to have a}} fleshed out plan, because it helps clarify the differences between the parties on health reform." [...] Sargent also wrote that [...] "GOP reforms would likely translate into lower-quality plans and <b>a</b> <b>coverage</b> expansion that would benefit fewer people. But that would be the trade-off Republicans would make to achieve their goal of less government spending and interference in the market than that which occurs under Obamacare."
