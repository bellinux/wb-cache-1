25|$|Headquarters for Amoco Corporation were in Chicago, {{because that}} city {{is close to}} Whiting, Indiana. Whiting was home of Amoco’s largest oil {{refinery}} (and {{one of the largest}} in the world). In operation since 1890, Whiting originally refined sour crude oil from the neighbouring state of Ohio. And it was Standard of Indiana's (Amoco's) most important single asset after the US Supreme Court ordered the Standard Oil Trust broken up. In its early years, Amoco was primarily <b>a</b> <b>refiner</b> and a marketer of refined products to expanding Midwestern markets. Whiting provided products that could be marketed from Chicago — a city that was itself a large market for petroleum products.|$|E
25|$|Soap pellets are {{combined}} with fragrances {{and other materials}} and blended to homogeneity in an amalgamator (mixer). The mass is then discharged from the mixer into <b>a</b> <b>refiner,</b> which, {{by means of an}} auger, forces the soap through a fine wire screen. From the refiner, the soap passes over a roller mill (French milling or hard milling) {{in a manner similar to}} calendering paper or plastic or to making chocolate liquor. The soap is then passed through one or more additional refiners to further plasticize the soap mass. Immediately before extrusion, the mass is passed through a vacuum chamber to remove any trapped air. It is then extruded into a long log or blank, cut to convenient lengths, passed through a metal detector, and then stamped into shape in refrigerated tools. The pressed bars are packaged in many ways.|$|E
60|$|I confess myself {{so little}} <b>a</b> <b>refiner</b> in the politics, {{as not to}} be able to discover, what other motive besides {{obedience}} to the Queen, a sense of public danger, and a true love of their country, joined with invincible courage, could spirit those great men, who have now under her Majesty's authority undertaken the direction of affairs. What can they expect but the utmost efforts of malice from a set of enraged domestic adversaries, perpetually watching over their conduct, crossing all their designs, and using every art to foment divisions among them, in order to join with the weakest upon any rupture? The difficulties they must encounter are nine times more and greater than ever; and the prospects of interest, after the reapings and gleanings of so many years, nine times less. Every misfortune at home or abroad, though the necessary consequence of former counsels, will be imputed to them; and all the good success given to the merit of former schemes. A sharper has held your cards all the evening, played booty, and lost your money, and when things are almost desperate, you employ an honest gentleman to retrieve your losses.|$|E

50|$|From {{high density}} storage or from slusher/pulper the pulp is pumped {{to a low}} density storage chest (tank). From there it is {{typically}} diluted to about 4% consistency before being pumped to an unrefined stock chest. From the unrefined stock chest stock is again pumped, with consistency control, through <b>a</b> <b>refiner.</b> Refining is an operation whereby the pulp slurry passes between a pair of discs, {{one of which is}} stationary and the other rotating at speeds of typically 1,000 or 1,200 RPM for 50 and 60 Hz AC, respectively. The discs have raised bars on their faces and pass each other with narrow clearance. This action unravels the outer layer of the fibres, causing the fibrils of the fibres to partially detach and bloom outward, increasing the surface area to promoting bonding. Refining thus increases tensile strength. For example, tissue paper is relatively unrefined whereas packaging paper is more highly refined. Refined stock from the refiner then goes to a refined stock chest, or blend chest, if used as such.|$|E
