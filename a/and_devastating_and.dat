50|$|Typhoon Ike, {{known in}} the Philippines as Typhoon Nitang, was the deadliest typhoon of the 1984 Pacific typhoon season and crossed the Philippines in September. This {{tropical}} cyclone formed on August 27 in the Philippine Sea, and strengthened as it moved westward into the southern Philippines, becoming a typhoon on August 31. Typhoon Ike caused extreme wind and flooding damage when it crossed the Philippines, resulting in 1492 fatalities, one of the Philippines' worst natural disaster in modern times, and its worst typhoon since Amy struck the archipelago in 1951. A total of 200,000 to 480,000 were left homeless. Emerging from the Philippines as a strong tropical storm, Ike restrengthened as it tracked northwest through the South China Sea across northeast Hainan Island. Weakening back into a tropical storm, Ike moved inland into mainland China. In Hong Kong, winds gusted to 49 kn at Tate's Cairn. Extensive crop damage was experienced in southern China, with Ike becoming the most significant tropical cyclone to strike Guangxi since 1954. The total damage was reportedly US$111 million (1984 dollars). The name Ike was retired after this season. Typhoon Ike was recorded with a 220 km/h gust and an estimated 185 km/h msw in Surigao on September 2 {{and is one of}} the intense tropical cyclones <b>and</b> <b>devastating</b> <b>and</b> deadliest to hit the RP.|$|E

5000|$|Many {{commentators}} expressed {{fears that}} the explosives {{had fallen into the}} hands of terrorists and would be used by the Iraqi insurgency to mount attacks against US and Iraqi troops.

It is not clear whether these attacks were mounted using explosives from Al Qa'qaa. However, on October 28, 2004 a video was released by a group calling itself [...] "Al-Islam's Army Brigades, Al-Karar Brigade" [...] in which a masked man claimed that [...] "the American intelligence" [...] had helped them to obtain a [...] "huge amount of the explosives that were in the Al Qa'qaa facility" [...] and that the explosives would be [...] "used against the occupation forces and those who cooperate with them in the event of these forces threatening any Iraqi city." [...] And a December 2003 report from a joint Defense Department intelligence task force concluded that the insurgents in Iraq [...] "retain access to virtually all the weapons systems and ordnances previously controlled by the Iraqi military, security and intelligence assets. Unsecured arms depots and storage sites, in addition to open and black market availability of weapons and ammunition, eliminate the need for the insurgents to maintain a formidable arsenal." ...|$|E

One third of our elderly have echo-cardiographic or radiological evidence of calcific aortic valve sclerosis (CAVS), an early and subclinical form of CAVD. 1 However, even in middle age, ≈ 10 % exhibit CAVS by echo-cardiography. 2 On progression to its most severe form, cal-cific aortic stenosis (CAS), CAVD becomes debilitating <b>and</b> <b>devastating,</b> <b>and</b> 2 % of individuals> 60 years {{are affected by}} CAS {{to the extent that}} surgery is required to preclude death once symptoms occur. 2 Age, sex, tobacco use, hypercholes-terolemia, and hypertension all contribute to the risk of dis-ease that has worldwide distribution. 1, 2 Genetics plays a direct role in that bicuspid aortic valve, a congenital risk factor for precocious CAS, has a significant genetic diathesis. 3, 4 Recently, type II diabetes mellitus has emerged as a particu-larly relevant and worrisome metabolic risk factor for native CAVD 5 as well as precocious degeneration of bioprosthetic valves. 6 It is becoming increasingly apparent that a diverse spectrum of cell-dependent mechanisms converge to regulate valvular calcium load; this is evidenced not only in histopatho-logic heterogeneity of CAVD, 7, 8 but also from the multiplicity of cell types, interstitial cells, endothelial cells (ECs), car-diac chondrocytes, and circulating osteoprogenitors, that par-ticipate in valve biomineralization. 1, 9 This review highlights our current understanding of CAVD disease biology and its regulation, emphasizing cellular physiology and mechanisms...|$|E
