[...] "It's so hard given the breadth of this topic to be factually correct, <b>and</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> don't lose your audience," [...] Thompson said. [...] "As scientists, we publish our papers in Science and Nature, but very few people read those. Here's another way to get this message out.

To me, it has tremendous value. It will reach people that scientists will never reach." ...|$|E
500|$|Rangel rose {{rapidly in}} the House, due to his {{political}} skills, hard work, knowledge of legislative matters, and genial manner. [...] In 1974, {{he became the first}} black ever named to the House Committee on Ways and Means, a position he assumed in 1975 (and left the Judiciary Committee), and by 1979 had become the chairman of its important Subcommittee on Health. [...] In 1976, he was named to the House Select Committee on Narcotics Abuse and Control. [...] By 1979, Rangel {{was a member of the}} influential House Democratic Steering and Policy Committee. [...] Rangel combined his solidly liberal views–interest group ratings in 1978 indicated he was the most liberal member of the New York State congressional delegation–with a pragmatic approach towards finding political and legislative compromises. [...] Rangel built alliances with others in Congress (collaborating for example with Michigan Republican Guy Vander Jagt on welfare reform measures), with people in governmental agencies, and with the Carter administration. [...] In some cases Rangel was criticized for being too pragmatic, such as when he switched his position on natural gas deregulation; Rangel denied that he did so in exchange for the authorization of a new federal building in Harlem. [...] Rangel said of himself, [...] "I guess I'm practical, but you have to live with yourself <b>and</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> are not so practical that you sell out a part of yourself." ...|$|E
