5|$|In 1935 Pei {{boarded a}} boat and sailed to San Francisco, then {{traveled}} by train to Philadelphia. What he found, however, differed vastly from his expectations. Professors at the University of Pennsylvania based their teaching in the Beaux-Arts style, rooted in the classical traditions of Greece and Rome. Pei was more intrigued by modern <b>architecture,</b> <b>and</b> also felt intimidated by {{the high level of}} drafting proficiency shown by other students. He decided to abandon <b>architecture</b> <b>and</b> transferred to the engineering program at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Once he arrived, however, the dean of the architecture school commented on his eye for design and convinced Pei to return to his original major.|$|E

5|$|In 2008, the Utzon Center, its art, <b>architecture</b> <b>and</b> design {{credited}} to the noted architect Jørn Utzon, is also dedicated to him.

The centre contains an exhibition on Utzon's work, which includes the Sydney Opera House, as well as educational displays on <b>architecture</b> <b>and</b> design. The centre consists of several individual buildings creating a special place around a courtyard on a platform. The tall sculptural roofs of the auditorium and the boat-hall, both on the harbour front, and the library facing the park area and the city are set off by the lower roofs of the exhibition and workshop areas inside the complex.|$|E
