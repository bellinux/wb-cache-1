50|$|For hypervalent {{compounds}} {{in which the}} ligands are more electronegative than the central, hypervalent atom, resonance structures can be drawn {{with no more than}} four covalent electron pair bonds and completed with ionic bonds to obey the octet rule. For example, in phosphorus pentafluoride (PF5), 5 resonance structures can be generated each with four covalent bonds and one ionic bond with greater weight in the structures placing ionic character in the axial bonds, thus satisfying the octet rule and explaining both the observed trigonal bipyramidal molecular geometry {{and the fact that the}} <b>axial</b> <b>bond</b> length (158 pm) is longer than the equatorial (154 pm).|$|E
50|$|According to the VSEPR {{theory of}} {{molecular}} geometry, an axial position is more crowded because an axial atom has three neighboring equatorial atoms (on the same central atom) at a 90° bond angle, whereas an equatorial atom {{has only two}} neighboring axial atoms at a 90° bond angle. For molecules with five identical ligands, the <b>axial</b> <b>bond</b> lengths tend to be longer because the ligand atom cannot approach the central atom as closely.

Comparison between the cis and trans isomers of 1, 2 -dimethylcyclohexane, 1, 4 -dimethylcyclohexane and decalin provides a quantitative evaluation of the role played by strain release in these reactions. kH values for HAT from tertiary equatorial C−H bonds were found to be at least 1 order of magnitude higher than those for HAT from the corresponding tertiary <b>axial</b> C−H <b>bonds</b> (kH(eq) /kH(ax) = 10 − 14). The higher reactivity of tertiary equatorial C−H bonds was explained in terms of 1, 3 -diaxial strain release in the HAT transition state.

40|$|Recombination of two {{fragments}} of horse cytochrome c (the heme-containing N-fragment, residues 1 - 56, and the C-fragment, residues 57 - 104), which are substantially unstructured at neutral pH, {{gives rise to}} a 1 : 1 fragment complex with a compact conformation, in which the alpha helical structure and the native Met 80 -Fe(III) <b>axial</b> <b>bond</b> are recovered. With respect to the native protein, the ferric complex shows a less rigid atomic packing and a decreased stability [Delta(DeltaG(o)) (D) = 14. 7 kJ. mol(- 1) ], ascribed to perturbations involving the Trp 59 microenvironment and, to a lower extent, the heme pocket region. The redox potential, E- 1 / 2 = 234 +/- 5 mV vs. normal hydrogen electrode at 25 degreesC, is close to that of the intact protein, consistent with recovery of the native Met 80 -heme Fe(III) <b>axial</b> <b>bond.</b> Furthermore, the fragment complex shows reactivity similar to intact cytochrome c, in the reaction with cytochrome c oxidase. We conclude that the absence in the complex of some native cross-links and interlocked packing important for protein rigidity and stability is not as relevant for maintaining the native redox properties of the protein, provided that some structural requirements (i. e. recovering of the native-like alpha helical structure) are fulfilled and coordination of Met 80 to the heme-iron is restored...|$|E
