5|$|American {{historian}} Richard Landes, {{who specializes}} {{in the history of}} apocalypticism and was co-founder and director of the Center for Millennial Studies at Boston University, argues that new and emerging technologies often trigger alarmism among millenarians and even the introduction of Gutenberg's printing press in 1436 caused waves of apocalyptic thinking. The Year 2000 problem, bar codes and Social Security numbers all triggered end-time warnings which either proved to be false or simply were no longer taken seriously once the public became accustomed to these technological changes. Civil libertarians argue that the privatization of surveillance {{and the rise of the}} surveillance-industrial complex in the United States does raise legitimate concerns about the erosion of privacy. However, skeptics of mass surveillance conspiracism caution that such concerns should be disentangled from secular paranoia <b>about</b> <b>Big</b> Brother or religious hysteria about the Antichrist.|$|E

500|$|The Futon Critic listed it the 16th best {{television}} {{episode of}} 2009, explaining [...] "J.J. Abrams and company know all <b>about</b> <b>big</b> reveals... but this one, in which William Bell reveals himself as {{living in a}} parallel universe where the Twin Towers weren't lost, {{was one of their}} most indelible". In a comparison of [...] "There's More Than One of Everything" [...] and The X-Files episode [...] "4-D", UGO Networks columnist Alex Zalben wrote that the Fringe episode won [...] "by a landslide. This episode kicked the show into high gear, while '4-D' was The X-Files winding down." [...] Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly named [...] "There's More Than One of Everything" [...] the seventh best episode of the series, calling it [...] "the episode that changed everything... With that, the most hyped show of the 2008-2009 TV season produced a moment that finally earned it buzz." [...] Den of Geek ranked the episode as the fifth best of the entire series, while IGN ranked it the ninth best.|$|E

Grahame-Smith signed on with the {{intention}} of doing [...] "a story that is worthy of us actually doing this for real, something that is not just about cashing in, is not just about forcing a remake or a reboot down someone's throat." [...] He was also adamant that Keaton would return and that Warner Bros. would not recast the role. Burton and Keaton have not officially signed on but will return if the script is good enough. Grahame-Smith met with Keaton in February 2012, [...] "We talked {{for a couple of hours}} and talked <b>about</b> <b>big</b> picture stuff. It's a priority for Warner Bros. It's a priority for Tim. [...] been wanting to do it for 20 years and he'll talk to anybody about it who will listen." [...] The story will be set in a real time frame from 1988; [...] "This will be a true 26 or 27 years later sequel. What's great is that for Beetlejuice , time means nothing in the afterlife, but the world outside is a different story." ...|$|E

500|$|Later that night, {{the bait}} and tackle shop owner {{walks through the}} swamp in boots, making fake dinosaur tracks. However, he is {{attacked}} and killed. Mulder wants the lake to be closed but the local sheriff declines and says {{that he does not}} have enough men to cover the 48 miles of shoreline. Two teenagers, previously seen in the episode [...] "War of the Coprophages", head to the lake to lick toads; while experimenting, a diver friend of theirs is suddenly attacked underwater and his severed head floats to the surface. Scully, still skeptical <b>about</b> <b>Big</b> Blue being the killer, thinks that a boat propeller was responsible. A photographer named Ansel is also attacked just as he was frantically taking pictures of the creature. After falling into the lake and feeling something in the water, the Sheriff orders the lake closed. While Mulder looks at Ansel's photographs later that night, Scully takes Queequeg for a walk; the dog, sensing something in the nearby woods, ends up running off and disappearing (yelping is heard), becoming the latest victim of the attacks and leaving Scully saddened. Mulder realizes that the Big Blue sightings have been occurring closer and closer to shore.|$|E
500|$|The first {{image the}} Coens and Raimi {{conceived}} was of Norville Barnes about {{to jump from}} the window of a skyscraper and then they had to figure out how he got there and how to save him. The inclusion of the hula hoop came {{as a result of a}} plot device. Joel remembers, [...] "We had to come up with something that Norville was going to invent that on the face of it was ridiculous. Something that would seem, by any sort of rational measure, to be doomed to failure, but something that on the other hand the audience already knew was going to be a phenomenal success." [...] Ethan said, [...] "The whole circle motif was built into the design of the movie, and that just made it seem more appropriate." [...] Joel: [...] "What grew out of that was the design element which drives the movie. The tension between vertical lines and circles; you have these tall buildings, then these circles everywhere which are echoed in the plot...in the structure of the movie itself. It starts with the end and circles back to the beginning, with a big flashback." [...] It took the Coens and Raimi three months to write the screenplay. As early as 1985, the Coens were quoted as saying that an upcoming project [...] "takes place in the late Fifties in a skyscraper and is <b>about</b> <b>Big</b> Business. The characters talk fast and wear sharp clothes." ...|$|E
500|$|Matt Richenthal of TV Fanatic {{gave the}} episode a 4.6 out of 5 stars, {{and went on}} to {{describe}} the episode as [...] "A funny, touching, entertaining Glee episode that didn't feature a single line from Sue Sylvester? I never thought I'd see the day. But that's exactly what transpired on 'Silly Love Songs', as the show stopped feeling like a Public Service Announcement for a week and actually focused on well-paced, well-written relationship developments among its core characters." [...] Joel Keller of TV Squad gave the episode a positive review, and wrote, Silly Love Songs' strikes an interesting contrast to Sunday night's post-Super Bowl episode in that tonight was more about the kids and where they are in their stories than <b>about</b> <b>big</b> production numbers and Sue's cartoon evilness. It was also the funniest episode of the season, in no small part because we got some insight into the lives of two New Directions members we rarely get to hang out with for any length of time: Santana and Lauren." [...] James Poniewozik of Time Magazine praised the storyline and the musical performances of the episode. However, Soraya Roberts of the Daily News gave the episode a negative review: [...] "This show sometimes sounds like it was written by a PIT, prime idiot TV writer. It's almost as bad as Tina breaking down into tears for no reason while singing 'My Funny Valentine' to Mike and Blaine attempting to channel Frank Sinatra while singing Paul McCartney's 'Silly Love Songs' in the middle of Breadsticks." [...] Lisa de Moraes of The Washington Post praised the storyline, calling it cohesive.|$|E

In the following weeks, tension was teased between Bryan and Big Show, with Big Show unhappy about Bryan taking the world championship from him, and Bryan being displeased <b>about</b> <b>Big</b> Show's lack of appreciation for Bryan's help in matches against Henry. As World Heavyweight Champion, Bryan began a slow heel turn as he gradually showed signs of overconfidence and arrogance, with Bryan beginning to partake in excessive victory celebrations, even when he won his matches by disqualification or count-out. Also, despite AJ's declaration of love for Bryan, Bryan avoided saying that he loved her in return.|$|E

Albini explained that the performance was [...] "not <b>about</b> <b>Big</b> Black wanting to get back together or even an audience wanting to see Big Black, it's that ... to not honor Touch and Go would be an insult by way of damning with faint praise", describing the label as [...] " [...] just a benchmark for how a record label should behave, but how people should behave." [...] During the performance he stated that [...] "You can tell [...] not something we had a burning desire to do, but we did it because we love Touch and Go [...] we love Corey Rusk [...] When history talks about rock music it {{has a tendency to}} skip from the Sex Pistols to Nirvana, [...] something started in the 1980s and you're seeing the evidence of it all around you", remarking that the label was [...] "the best thing to happen to music in my lifetime, and we did this to say thanks". Though the band has been approached by promoters about doing other reunion shows, Albini has stated flatly [...] "that is definitely not going to happen." ...|$|E

The pirates tell Guybrush that Largo LaGrande, LeChuck's former first mate, has placed an embargo on the island, and is not allowing any ships to enter or leave. Guybrush wanders into Woodtick, the only town on the island, and encounters Largo, who promptly robs him of all of his money and takes off. Wandering the island, Guybrush comes across the International House of Mojo, the Voodoo Lady's new shop. She offers to help him drive Largo off the island if he can get her some ingredients for a voodoo doll. After retrieving the needed ingredients, Guybrush, with the voodoo doll that Voodoo Lady makes for him, defeats Largo. However, in trying to prove that {{he was the one who}} killed LeChuck, Guybrush makes the mistake of showing Largo LeChuck's beard, which he had kept as a trophy. Largo then steals the beard and uses it to resurrect his old boss, this time as a zombie. The Voodoo Lady reveals to Guybrush that Big Whoop, the mythical treasure for which he is searching, is also the key to another dimension which will allow him to escape from LeChuck forever. In addition, she gives him a library book <b>about</b> <b>Big</b> Whoop which reveals that a map, made by the original discoverers of the treasure, still exists in four fragments.|$|E
