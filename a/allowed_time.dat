25|$|The tower {{began to}} sink after {{construction}} had progressed {{to the second}} floor in 1178. This was due to a mere three-metre foundation, set in weak, unstable subsoil, a design that was flawed from the beginning. Construction was subsequently halted for almost a century, because the Republic of Pisa was almost continually engaged in battles with Genoa, Lucca, and Florence. This <b>allowed</b> <b>time</b> for the underlying soil to settle. Otherwise, the tower would almost certainly have toppled.

25|$|Though the midshipmen {{picked up}} one first down on their next drive, {{they were forced to}} punt the ball away with just over two minutes {{remaining}} in the quarter. Greg Veteto's punt was downed at the Utes' 16-yard line. The Utes' offense connected on passes of 10, 18, and 11 yards before Johnson completed a 40-yard pass to Derrek Richards for another touchdown. The 1:24 long drive took five plays and covered 84 yards. With the touchdown, Utah regained the lead by a 21–17 score. Midshipmen Campbell ran the opening kickoff return to the Navy 32-yard line, but the team struggled on the next two plays, fumbling and recovering the ball each time.

25|$|Many Egyptian {{stories about}} the gods are {{characterized}} as having taken place in a primeval time when the gods were manifest on the earth and ruled over it. After this time, the Egyptians believed, authority on earth passed to human pharaohs. This primeval era seems to predate {{the start of the}} sun's journey and the recurring patterns of the present world. At the other end of time {{is the end of the}} cycles and the dissolution of the world. Because these distant periods lend themselves to linear narrative better than the cycles of the present, John Baines sees them as the only periods in which true myths take place. Yet, to some extent, the cyclical aspect of time was present in the mythic past as well. Egyptians saw even stories that were set in that time as being perpetually true. The myths were made real every time the events to which they were related occurred. These events were celebrated with rituals, which often evoked myths. Ritual <b>allowed</b> <b>time</b> to periodically return to the mythic past and renew life in the universe.|$|E

25|$|The {{successful}} siege {{upon the}} stone and earthen fort required the prolonged bombardment by the British Navy {{under the command of}} Admiral Howe, also involving land batteries, lasting from September 26 to November 16, 1777. The standoff and defense of the fort <b>allowed</b> <b>time</b> for Washington and the Continental Army to safely deploy for the Battle of White Marsh and its subsequent withdrawal to Valley Forge. Washington received warnings from Generals Porter and Lee, stationed on the Schuylkill River at Philadelphia, that the British were making communication runs across the river at night using small boats. In a letter of November 4, Washington advised Hazelwood to do all he could to stop the activity. Hazelwood's efforts to end the communications were less than effectual. Several days before the fall of the fort Washington dispatched another letter to Hazelwood inquiring about his status, urging that if at all possible to remain at his station with the fleet after the fort has fallen so as to hinder and prolong British operations long enough to allow the river to freeze over, preventing passage of supply ships into Philadelphia until the spring thaw.|$|E
25|$|While Su Shi {{concentrated}} {{on making the}} lives of the local people in his charge better, and pursued his poetry which his position <b>allowed</b> <b>time</b> for, Wang Anshi's policies went awry. Were they bad policies, or were they badly implemented, or were climatic changes leading to drought and poor harvests to blame? These are all serious questions, important to historians of the time, and nowhere near to being definitively answered; but, they are rather subject of great scholarly debate. What is certain is that Su Shi was exiled until emperor Shenzong became somewhat disillusioned with Wang Anshi (and the powerful empress dowager had never been much of a fan of his). The Kaifeng merchants were becoming angry at the price inflation of wholesale goods together with additional tax increases and imposition of fees; and in north of the country a major drought followed by horrible famine occurred in 1074, displacing thousands of refugees (Murck, 37-38). In late 1075, this was followed by a spectacular comet, traditionally viewed as a sign of great changes on earth, even the fall of dynasties (Murck, 48) These events helped to lead Wang Anshi into a gentle but real exile, and to lead to the restoration of Su Shi and other banished officials to positions of power and respect, aided by empress dowager Cao. However, this was just the warm-up to a bitter and deadly political struggle between the two factions in the ensuing years: now both groups had had their ranks decimated, and all sorts of charges of criminal impropriety were our would be filed. Ouyang Xiu had even already been charged with incest, and placed in early retirement: the battle lines drawn, and Su Shi would soon be charged with treason to the state.|$|E

500|$|A {{series of}} reforms to the Russian army {{had begun in}} 1802, {{creating}} regiments [...] of three battalions, each battalion having four companies. [...] The defeats of Austerlitz, Eylau, and Friedland led to important additional reforms, though continuous fighting {{in the course of}} three wars with France, two with Sweden, and two with the Ottoman Empire had not <b>allowed</b> <b>time</b> for these to be fully implemented and absorbed. A divisional system was introduced in 1806, and corps were established in 1812. Prussian influence may be seen in the organizational setup. By the time of Borodino the Russian Army had changed greatly from the force which met the French in 1805–1807.|$|E

500|$|Holden, {{concerned}} {{about the risks of}} introducing a new platform and drivetrain at the same time, introduced the Australian-built Alloytec V6 engine in the proven VZ model.

An updated version of the long-serving four-speed GM 4L60-E automatic transmission remained for this engine. Manual transmission options are the Aisin AY6 and Tremec T-56 six-speeders. Two automatics featuring Active Select; the five-speed GM 5L40-E and six-speed GM 6L80-E were also offered. The latter was reserved exclusively for a modified L76 V8 engine, giving an extra [...] of power compared to the VZ.

Khiêm was a Catholic with ties to Diệm's older brother, Archbishop Ngô Đình Thục. Khanh also convinced Lê Nguyên Khang, the acting head of the Republic of Vietnam Marine Corps to send the 1st and 2nd Marine Battalions. Rangers were called into Saigon from the western town of Tây Ninh. Assistant Secretary of Defense Nguyễn Đình Thuận phoned Durbrow and discussed the impending standoff between the incoming loyalists and the rebels. Durbrow said [...] "I hope that the Revolutionary Committee and President Diệm can get together and agree to cooperate as a civil war could only benefit communists.
