5000|$|Private <b>Mail</b> <b>Bags</b> or {{so-called}} [...] "Locked Bags" [...] are {{a worldwide}} solution for specialized mail delivery {{to a single}} location. Like PO Box addresses, Private <b>Mail</b> <b>Bag</b> addresses omit {{the name of the}} building and street, and include only the number allocated to the user. Private <b>Mail</b> <b>Bag</b> addresses are often used in countries in Africa where there may be no street delivery service. In Europe and North America, where street delivery is more commonplace, large users may be allocated their own postal codes, and consequently need only use their physical address in correspondence; the postal code implies that the recipient receives mail by caller service. Private <b>mail</b> <b>bags</b> may be in lieu of a Post Office Box, but sometimes can {{go so far as to}} have an individualized corporate zip code.|$|R
