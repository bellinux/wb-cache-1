5|$|By 1939, the Bells {{had moved}} to Brisbane, where John was Queensland manager for Airlines of Australia Ltd, having left the RAAF in 1929. Mary became leader of forty or so members of the Women's National Emergency Legion Air Wing who had volunteered to assist with {{aircraft}} maintenance during times of war. Determining that their objectives would not be met in their existing organisation, on 17July they formed a new paramilitary group, the Women's Air Training Corps (WATC), and elected Bell its commander. She soon expanded the WATC into a national organisation, with Commandants leading each state's chapter, and herself as Australian Commandant. Bell wrote to Air Vice Marshal Richard Williams, with whom she was acquainted via her husband and through aviation circles, advocating {{the establishment of a}} women's branch of the RAAF similar to the RAF's Women's Auxiliary Air Force (WAAF). Among other things, she pointed out that female volunteers such as hers were already supporting the Air Force in driving, nursing and clerical duties. The WATC was one of several women's voluntary organisations whose members were keen to support the military, arguing that their personnel provided a ready-made pool of skilled staff for <b>auxiliary</b> <b>services,</b> saving the government time and money training unskilled labour.|$|E

25|$|The Supreme Court {{first met}} on February 1, 1790, at the Merchants' Exchange Building in New York City. When Philadelphia became the capital, the Court met briefly in Independence Hall before {{settling}} in Old City Hall from 1791 until 1800. After the government moved to Washington, D.C., the Court occupied various {{spaces in the}} United States Capitol building until 1935, when it moved into its own purpose-built home. The four-story building was designed by Cass Gilbert in a classical style sympathetic to the surrounding buildings of the Capitol and Library of Congress, and is clad in marble. The building includes the courtroom, justices' chambers, an extensive law library, various meeting spaces, and <b>auxiliary</b> <b>services</b> including a gymnasium.

While most residence halls are only for housing, several halls also provide <b>auxiliary</b> <b>services.</b> For example, Chandler Hall, {{located in the}} Lake area, offers a basement dining facility and a computer lab. All freshmen must live on campus, and {{a large portion of}} JMU's on-campus housing is set aside for incoming students. Consequently, most upperclassmen and graduate students live off campus. Continuing students who wish to live on campus must re-apply for housing each year. While occasional exceptions are granted, generally freshmen are not granted on-campus parking permits. Some JMU halls are set-aside as specialized living and learning residential communities. Shenandoah Hall is devoted as an Honors residential experience, Chesapeake Hall is for pre-professional health disciplines, Gifford Hall includes the Roop Learning Community for future teachers, and Wayland Hall is reserved for majors in the art disciplines.|$|E
500|$|Between World War I and World War II, the Royal Australian Navy {{underwent}} a severe reduction in ships and manpower. As {{a result of}} the Washington Naval Treaty, the flagship HMAS Australia was scrapped with her main armaments and sunk outside Sydney Heads in 1924. In the same year, the RAN began a five-year program of obtaining new ships from Britain: the heavy cruisers [...] and [...] and the seaplane carrier [...] This purchase was partly paid for by scrapping Brisbane, Melbourne, Sydney, and most of the destroyers. The Great Depression of 1929 led to another reduction of manpower; although reduced in size, the available posts were easily filled as many men were unemployed and the offered pay was greater than most jobs. The RAN's personnel strength fell to 3,117 personnel, plus 131 members of the Naval <b>Auxiliary</b> <b>Services.</b> By 1932, the strength of the Reserves stood at 5,446. In the early 1930s, lack of funds forced the transfer of the Royal Australian Naval College from Jervis Bay to Flinders Naval Depot in Victoria. In 1933 the Australian Government ordered three light cruisers; HMA Ships , , and selling the seaplane carrier Albatross to fund Hobart. During this time, the RAN also purchased destroyers of the V and W destroyer classes, the ships that would become known as the Scrap Iron Flotilla. With the ever-increasing threat of Germany and Japan in the late 1930s, the RAN was not in the position it was at the outbreak of World War I.|$|E

2500|$|Alice {{was not a}} {{champion}} for Greek Life, which had become popular {{at the time she}} came to her position at the University. She believed school had become a place where social life mattered more than the academics. The experience outside of the classroom had become {{just as important as the}} academics. Despite her attitude that school should be a place for learning, away from social distractions, Lloyd still maintained an idealistic view on the world and education. In a speech given to the National Association of Deans of Women from January, 1944 she stated, [...] "Education must be inspired by courageous and spiritual leadership and must touch the hearts of people as well as train their minds." [...] Additionally, in a speech given at the American Legion <b>Auxiliary</b> <b>Services</b> on August 16, 1945, she said, [...] "It is through generosity and compassion and honesty and love that we will build a new world." ...|$|E

A timeline was also provided by Marysville police spokesman Robb Lamoureux. According to the timeline and recordings, an anonymous 9-1-1 caller, using a cellphone, first alerted police to the shooting. The school resource officer was the first law enforcement officer {{to make contact with}} the victims, arriving at the scene a minute after the first 9-1-1 call was received. He immediately reported that a fire alarm was going off and that there were students and staff evacuating from the building. A dispatcher then informed him about a report of a possible shooting in the cafeteria. The officer responded, [...] "Ocean 12, it's confirmed. We have a shooter. We have five down." [...] He later said, [...] "Shooter is DOA [...] We have got apparently four [...] " [...] Soon afterward, he said, [...] "Ocean 12, I need aid here. I have two that are still breathing and alive. Looks like I have three possibly deceased." [...] The first paramedics arrived on the scene ten minutes after the first radio dispatch.|$|E

2500|$|Women were [...] "drafted" [...] in {{the sense}} that they were conscripted into war work by the Ministry of Labour, {{including}} non-combat jobs in the military, such as the Women's Royal Naval Service (WRNS or [...] "Wrens"), the Women's Auxiliary Air Force (WAAF or [...] "Waffs") and the Auxiliary Territorial Service (ATS). <b>Auxiliary</b> <b>services</b> such as the Air Transport Auxiliary also recruited women. In the early stages of the war such services relied exclusively on volunteers, however by 1941 conscription was extended to women for the first time in British history and around 600,000 women were recruited into these three organizations. In these organizations women performed a wide range of jobs in support of the Army, Royal Air Force (RAF) and Royal Navy both overseas and at home. These jobs ranged from traditionally feminine roles like cook, clerk and telephonist to more traditionally masculine duties like mechanic, armourer, searchlight and anti- aircraft instrument operator. British women were not drafted into combat units, but could volunteer for combat duty in anti-aircraft units, which shot down German planes and V-1 missiles. Civilian women joined the Special Operations Executive (SOE), which used them in high-danger roles as secret agents and underground radio operators in Nazi occupied Europe.|$|E
