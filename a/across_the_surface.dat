5|$|At a given {{temperature}} a {{lipid bilayer}} can exist in either a liquid or a gel (solid) phase. All lipids have a characteristic temperature at which they transition (melt) from the gel to liquid phase. In both phases the lipid molecules are prevented from flip-flopping across the bilayer, but in liquid phase bilayers a given lipid will exchange locations with its neighbor millions of times a second. This random walk exchange allows lipid to diffuse and thus wander <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> of the membrane. Unlike liquid phase bilayers, the lipids in a gel phase bilayer have less mobility.|$|E

40|$|Leaf {{structural}} {{characteristics and}} gas-exchange measurements {{were used to}} determine whether photosynthetic tissue of Typha Iatifolia L. (cattail) utilized CO 2 from the aerenchyma gas spaces, part of an internal pathway for gas transport in this wetland species. The partial pressure of CO 2 (pCO 2) in these aerenchyma gas spaces can be more than 10 times atmospheric pCO 2. The photosynthetic tissue occurred in structurally similar adaxial and abaxial palisades, which were distinctly separated from each other by the aerenchyma gas spaces. In each palisade there were three to four layers of tightly packed, nonchlorophyllous cells separating the photosynthetic tissue from the aerenchyma gas space. Different lines of evidence indicated that CO 2 conductance in the light was significantly greater <b>across</b> <b>the</b> epidermal <b>surface</b> than <b>across</b> <b>the</b> internal <b>surface</b> of both palisades. However, at an epidermal pCO 2 of 350 [mu]bars and an internal pCO 2 of 820 [mu]bars, the net rates of CO 2 uptake (PN) <b>across</b> <b>the</b> epidermal and internal surfaces were about equal. PN <b>across</b> <b>the</b> internal <b>surface</b> was greater than <b>across</b> <b>the</b> epidermal <b>surface</b> at higher internal pCO 2. Gas space pCO 2 can be greater than 820 [mu]bars in the field, and therefore, PN <b>across</b> <b>the</b> internal <b>surface</b> could be a significant proportion of epidermal surface PN...|$|R
5|$|Io's {{colorful}} {{appearance is}} the result of materials deposited by its extensive volcanism, including silicates (such as orthopyroxene), sulfur, and sulfur dioxide. Sulfur dioxide frost is ubiquitous <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> of Io, forming large regions covered in white or grey materials. Sulfur is also seen in many places across Io, forming yellow to yellow-green regions. Sulfur deposited in the mid-latitude and polar regions is often damaged by radiation, breaking up the normally stable cyclic 8-chain sulfur. This radiation damage produces Io's red-brown polar regions.|$|E
5|$|The red-legged running frog (Kassina maculata) has short, slim hind limbs unsuited to jumping. It {{can move}} fast {{by using a}} running gait {{in which the two}} hind legs are used alternately. Slow-motion {{photography}} shows, unlike a horse that can trot or gallop, the frog's gait remained similar at slow, medium, and fast speeds. This species can also climb trees and shrubs, and does so at night to catch insects. The Indian skipper frog (Euphlyctis cyanophlyctis) has broad feet and can run <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> of the water for several metres (yards).|$|E
5|$|The {{surface of}} the forewing is super-hydrophobic; it is covered with minute waxy cones, blunt spikes that create a {{water-repellent}} film. Rain rolls <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface,</b> removing dirt in the process. In the absence of rain, dew condenses on the wings. When the droplets coalesce, they leap several millimetres into the air, which also serves to clean the wings. It {{has been found that}} bacteria landing on the wing surface are not repelled, rather their membranes are torn apart by the nanoscale-sized spikes, making the wing surface the first-known biomaterial that can kill bacteria.|$|E

5|$|The {{theory of}} plate {{tectonics}} {{demonstrates that the}} continents of the Earth are moving <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> {{at the rate of}} a few centimeters per year. This is expected to continue, causing the plates to relocate and collide. Continental drift is facilitated by two factors: the energy generation within the planet and the presence of a hydrosphere. With the loss of either of these, continental drift will come to a halt. The production of heat through radiogenic processes is sufficient to maintain mantle convection and plate subduction {{for at least the next}} 1.1 billion years.|$|E
5|$|Thermal inertia and the {{transfer}} of heat by winds in the lower atmosphere mean that the temperature of Venus's surface does not vary significantly between the night and day sides, despite Venus's extremely slow rotation. Winds at the surface are slow, moving at a few kilometres per hour, {{but because of the}} high density of the atmosphere at the surface, they exert a significant amount of force against obstructions, and transport dust and small stones <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface.</b> This alone would make it difficult for a human to walk through, even if the heat, pressure, and lack of oxygen were not a problem.|$|E
5|$|A sand sheet is a near-level, firm {{expanse of}} {{partially}} consolidated particles in a layer that varies {{from a few}} centimeters to a few meters thick. The structure of the sheet consists of thin horizontal layers of coarse silt and very fine to medium grain sand, separated by layers of coarse sand and pea-gravel which are a single grain thick. These larger particles anchor the other particles in place and may also be packed together on the surface so as to form a miniature desert pavement. Small ripples form on the sand sheet when the wind exceeds 24 km/h (15 mph). They form perpendicular to the wind direction and gradually move <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> as the wind continues to blow. The distance between their crests corresponds to {{the average length of}} jumps made by particles during saltation. The ripples are ephemeral and a change in wind direction causes them to reorganise.|$|E

5|$|Earth's {{lithosphere}} {{is divided}} into several rigid tectonic plates that migrate <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> over periods of many millions of years. About 71% of Earth's surface is covered with water, mostly by oceans. The remaining 29% is land consisting of continents and islands that together have many lakes, rivers and other sources of water {{that contribute to the}} hydrosphere. The majority of Earth's polar regions are covered in ice, including the Antarctic ice sheet and the sea ice of the Arctic ice pack. Earth's interior remains active with a solid iron inner core, a liquid outer core that generates the Earth's magnetic field, and a convecting mantle that drives plate tectonics.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to larvae that have portable cases, {{members of the}} Annulipalpia have a completely different feeding strategy. They make fixed retreats in which they remain stationary, waiting for food to come to them. Members of the Psychomyiidae, Ecnomidae and Xiphocentronidae families construct simple tubes of sand and other particles held together by silk and anchored to the bottom, and feed on the accumulations of silt formed when suspended material is deposited. The tube can be lengthened when the growing larva needs to feed in new areas. More complex tubes, short and flattened, are built by Polycentropodidae larvae in hollows in rocks or other submerged objecte, sometimes with strands of silk suspended across the nearby surface. These larvae are carnivorous, resembling spiders in their feeding habits and rushing out of their retreat to attack any unwary small prey crawling <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface.</b>|$|E
5|$|Ocean {{surface waves}} are {{propagating}} oscillations {{caused by the}} drag and friction from air moving <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> of the water. This friction transfers energy and forms surface waves in the water {{more or less in}} the direction of the wind. The top of a wave is known as its crest and its foot as its trough; the distance between two crests is the wavelength. These waves are mechanical: as they approach, the water at a given point rise up and, as they pass, the water goes down, with parcels of water tracing a roughly circular path. The energy is passed along with the wave at a much greater speed than the motion of the water itself.|$|E

5|$|Sand dunes are accumulations of {{windblown sand}} {{piled up in}} mounds or ridges. They form {{downwind}} of copious sources of dry, loose sand and occur when topographic and climatic conditions cause airborne particles to settle. As the wind blows, saltation and creep {{take place on the}} windward side of the dune and individual grains of sand move uphill. When they reach the crest, they cascade down the far side. The upwind slope typically has a gradient of 10° to 20° while the lee slope is around 32°, the angle at which loose dry sand will slip. As this wind-induced movement of sand grains takes place, the dune moves slowly <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> of the ground. Dunes are sometimes solitary, but they are more often grouped together in dune fields. When these are extensive, they are known as sand seas or ergs.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after the}} discovery, {{separate}} teams, one led by David Charbonneau including Timothy Brown and others, {{and the other}} by Gregory W. Henry, were able to detect a transit of the planet <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> of the star making it the first known transiting extrasolar planet. On September 9 and 16, 1999, Charbonneau's team measured a 1.7% drop in HD209458's brightness, which was attributed {{to the passage of}} the planet across the star. On November 8, Henry's team observed a partial transit, seeing only the ingress. Initially unsure of their results, the Henry group decided to rush their results to publication after overhearing rumors that Charbonneau had successfully seen an entire transit in September. Papers from both teams were published simultaneously in the same issue of the Astrophysical Journal. Each transit lasts about three hours, during which the planet covers about 1.5% of the star's face.|$|E
5|$|The {{relationship}} between Link and Zelda {{was quite different}} from earlier incarnations, in particular the fact that Zelda was {{not a member of}} royalty. According to Aonuma, a recurring difficulty was how contrived the necessity for Link to rescue Zelda became with each passing installment, as their contact may only have been fleeting beforehand. In response to this, the team considered how to make the player care about Zelda and want to rescue her. Having the two characters as childhood friends both served this purpose and cut down on extraneous plot elements. They continued to encourage the player by having Link only just miss her on her early travels <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>Surface.</b> Mischievous elements were also added to Zelda's personality by her pushing Link over an ledge: initially intended as a rule of three-style gag, it was cut down to two during development. The figure of Hylia was a new addition to the world's lore, although her existence was linked to Zelda, with the two being essentially the same character known under different names in subsequent ages. Groose, who acted as Link's rival, was introduced to make the story more interesting within the school setting. Groose's maturation {{during the course of the}} story was intended to help convey Link's parallel growth as a character as he was otherwise mute and static.|$|E

40|$|In {{the paper}} we study the {{qualitative}} dynamics of piecewise-smooth slow-fast sys-tems (singularly perturbed systems). First we consider in detail a planar system when the slow and the fast dynamics are one-dimensional. The slow manifold of the reduced {{system is a}} piecewise continuous curve – differentiability is lost <b>across</b> <b>the</b> switching <b>surface.</b> We show that in the full system the slow manifold is no longer continuous <b>across</b> <b>the</b> switching <b>surface.</b> There is an O(ε) discontinuity <b>across</b> <b>the</b> switching manifold. However, this discontinuity cannot qualitatively affect system dynamics. We show that system trajectories move <b>across</b> <b>the</b> switching <b>surface</b> and evolve exponentially fast toward the slow manifold that lies {{on the other side}} of the switching surface; small scale oscillations between the two parts of the slow manifold are not possible. We then classify the system dynamics in the case when there is an equilibrium on <b>the</b> switching <b>surface.</b> <b>The</b> results of our analysis are then used to investigate the dynamics of a simple box model of a climate change. The presence of a non-smooth equivalent of a fold bifurcation in the model is shown. Fi-nally, the results on the topology of <b>the</b> slow manifolds <b>across</b> <b>the</b> switching <b>surface</b> are generalized to n + 1 -dimensional slow-fast systems (the slow dynamics being n-dimensional) ...|$|R

5|$|There are two {{longitudinal}} {{coordinate systems}} in use for Vesta, with prime meridians separated by 150°. The IAU established a coordinate system in 1997 based on Hubble photos, {{with the prime}} meridian running {{through the center of}} Olbers Regio, a dark feature 200km across. When Dawn arrived at Vesta, mission scientists found that the location of the pole assumed by the IAU was off by 10°, so that the IAU coordinate system drifted <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> of Vesta at 0.06° per year, and also that Olbers Regio was not discernible from up close, and so was not adequate to define the prime meridian with the precision they needed. They corrected the pole, but also established a new prime meridian 4° from the center of Claudia, a sharply defined crater 700 meters across, which they say results in a more logical set of mapping quadrangles. All NASA publications, including images and maps of Vesta, use the Claudian meridian, which is unacceptable to the IAU. The IAU Working Group on Cartographic Coordinates and Rotational Elements recommended a coordinate system, correcting the pole but rotating the Claudian longitude by 150° to coincide with Olbers Regio. It was accepted by the IAU, though it disrupts the maps prepared by the Dawn team, which had been positioned so they would not bisect any major surface features.|$|E
5|$|The {{circulation}} in Venus's troposphere follows the so-called cyclostrophic approximation. Its windspeeds are roughly {{determined by the}} balance of the pressure gradient and centrifugal forces in almost purely zonal flow. In contrast, the {{circulation in}} the Earth's atmosphere is governed by the geostrophic balance. Venus's windspeeds can be directly measured only in the upper troposphere (tropopause), between 60–70km, altitude, which corresponds to the upper cloud deck. The cloud motion is usually observed in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum, where the contrast between clouds is the highest. The linear wind speeds at this level are about 100±10m/s at lower than 50° latitude. They are retrograde {{in the sense that they}} blow in the direction of the retrograde rotation of the planet. The winds quickly decrease towards the higher latitudes, eventually reaching zero at the poles. Such strong cloud-top winds cause a phenomenon known as the super-rotation of the atmosphere. In other words, these high-speed winds circle the whole planet faster than the planet itself rotates. The super-rotation on Venus is differential, which means that the equatorial troposphere super-rotates more slowly than the troposphere at the midlatitudes. The winds also have a strong vertical gradient. They decline deep in the troposphere with the rate of 3m/sperkm. The winds near the surface of Venus are much slower than that on Earth. They actually move at only a few kilometres per hour (generally less than 2m/s and with an average of 0.3 to 1.0m/s), but due to the high density of the atmosphere at the surface, this is still enough to transport dust and small stones <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface,</b> much like a slow-moving current of water.|$|E
