50|$|<b>Antibiosis</b> is a {{biological}} interaction between {{two or more}} organisms that is detrimental {{to at least one}} of them; it can also be an antagonistic association between an organism and the metabolic substances produced by another. Examples of <b>antibiosis</b> include the relationship between antibiotics and bacteria or animals and disease-causing pathogens. The study of <b>antibiosis</b> and its role in antibiotics has led to the expansion of knowledge in the field of microbiology.

50|$|Amensalism is {{the type}} of {{relationship}} that exists where one species is inhibited or completely obliterated and one is unaffected by the other. There are two types of amensalism, competition and <b>antibiosis.</b> Competition is where a larger or stronger organism deprives a smaller or weaker one from a resource. <b>Antibiosis</b> occurs when one organism is damaged or killed by another through a chemical secretion. An example of competition is a sapling growing under the shadow of a mature tree. The mature tree can rob the sapling of necessary sunlight and, if the mature tree is very large, it can take up rainwater and deplete soil nutrients. Throughout the process, the mature tree is unaffected by the sapling. Indeed, if the sapling dies, the mature tree gains nutrients from the decaying sapling. Note that these nutrients become available because of the sapling's decomposition, rather than from the living sapling, which would be a case of parasitism. An example of <b>antibiosis</b> is Juglans nigra (black walnut), secreting juglone, a substance which destroys many herbaceous plants within its root zone.|$|E

50|$|Several {{varieties}} of soybean have demonstrated {{resistance to the}} soybean aphid. Resistance may be conferred by <b>antibiosis,</b> antixenosis, or tolerance. In some instances, such as with the soybean cultivars 'Dowling', 'Jackson', and 'Palmetto', resistance to the soybean aphid results {{from a combination of}} both <b>antibiosis</b> and antixenosis. In the 'Dowling' cultivar, resistance is conferred by a single dominant gene (Rag1). Soybean plants that are resistant to the soybean aphid can cause both reduced fecundity and longevity in soybean aphids. In the case of <b>antibiosis,</b> certain life stages of the soybean aphid may be more susceptible than others. For example, nymphs have higher rates of metabolism than other life stages, ingest more phloem, and are thus exposed to larger quantities of antibiotic compounds. Expression of antibiotic factors in resistant soybean plants that negatively affect soybean aphids has been shown to remain constant throughout the growing season, remaining unaffected by the physiological maturity of the plant. Colonization of resistant soybean cultivars can vary between years depending upon the level of infestation, with resistant plants showing lower levels of resistance in years with significant levels of soybean aphid infestation. Physical characteristics of soybean, such as dense pubescence, have thus far proven incapable of reducing colonization by soybean aphids.|$|E

The resistant check Rathu Heenati (RHT), highly resistant varieties Mudgo and Kasalath, and resistant variety IR 36 expressed strong antixenosis and <b>antibiosis</b> against SBPH, indicating the close relationship between resistance level and these two resistance mechanisms in the four rice varieties. <b>Antibiosis</b> was the dominant resistance pattern in the resistant varieties Daorenqiao and Yangmaogu due to their high <b>antibiosis</b> but low antixenosis.

40|$|Myzus persicae (S√ºlzer), {{commonly}} known as green peach aphid (GPA), utilizes its slender stylet to penetrate the plant tissues intercellularly and consume copious amounts of photoassimilates present in the phloem sap causing extensive damage to host plants. The compatible interaction between GPA and Arabidopsis thaliana enabled us to characterize plant response to aphid infestation. Upon GPA infestation, Arabidopsis PAD 4 (PHYTOALEXIN DEFICIENT 4) gene modulates premature leaf senescence, which {{is involved in the}} programmed degradation of cellular components and the export of nutrients out of the senescing leaf. Senescence mechanism is utilized by plants to limit aphid growth. In addition, PAD 4 provides antixenosis (deters insect settling and feeding) and <b>antibiosis</b> (impair aphid fecundity) against GPA and adversely impact sieve element availability to GPA. Basal expression of PAD 4 contributes to <b>antibiosis,</b> and the GPA-induced expression of PAD 4 contributes to antixenosis. Mutation in the Arabidopsis stearoyl-ACP desaturase encoding SSI 2 (suppressor of SALICYLIC ACID [SA] insensitivity 2) gene that results in an accelerated cell death phenotype and dwarfing, also conferred heightened <b>antibiosis</b> to GPA. Results {{of this study indicate that}} PAD 4 is required for the ssi 2 -mediated enhanced <b>antibiosis</b> to GPA. The PAD 4 protein contains conserved Ser, Asp and His residues that form the catalytic triad of many Œ±/Œ≤ fold acyl hydrolases. Arabidopsis plants expressing mutant versions of PAD 4 [PAD 4 (S 118 A) and PAD 4 (D 178 A) ] supported higher numbers of GPA as compared to wild type (WT) plants in no-choice tests. Furthermore, Electrical Penetration Graph (EPG) studies revealed that S 118 residue in PAD 4 is essential to limit GPA feeding from the sieve elements. However, the ability to deter insect settling in choice tests was not impacted by the PAD 4 (S 118 A) and PAD 4 (D 178 A) mutations, thus suggesting that PAD 4 s involvement in deterring insect settling and in <b>antibiosis</b> are determined by separate regions of PAD 4. The MPL 1 (MYZUS PERSICAE INDUCED LIPASE 1) gene is another critical component of Arabidopsis defense against GPA. Like PAD 4, MPL 1 expression is induced in response to GPA infestation. However, MPL 1 is required only for <b>antibiosis</b> and is not essential for antixenosis against GPA. EPG analysis suggests that the mpl 1 mutant allele does not impact aphid feeding behavior. Since, MPL 1 exhibits lipase activity, and ssi 2 petiole exudates contain elevated levels of <b>antibiosis,</b> we propose that <b>antibiosis</b> to GPA requires a lipid(s), or a product thereof...|$|E
30|$|Rice {{varieties}} {{have different}} mechanisms {{of resistance to}} BPH, classed as antixenosis, <b>antibiosis</b> and tolerance (Alam and Cohen 1998; Painter 1951). <b>Antibiosis</b> is the most commonly studied mechanism (Cohen et al. 1997; Du et al. 2009; Qiu et al. 2010). BPH behavior (host-searching, feeding, mating) is most obviously affected by resistant varieties through <b>antibiosis.</b> After infestation by BPH the rice plant activates its own stress response for defense, including secretion of insect-toxic compounds, activation of expression of genes producing metabolic inhibitors, and formation of physical barrier (such as cuticle thickening, and callose deposition) to prevent continuous feeding by BPH (Cheng et al. 2013). Hao et al. (2008) showed that plants carrying Bph 14 undergo quicker deposition of callose on the sieve plate following infestation than those without the gene, suggesting that sieve tube plugging is an important mechanism for defense to BPH.|$|E
