5|$|Despite the {{sometimes}} gruesome testimony {{it was generally}} believed the hearings were politically motivated and that individual excesses could largely be traced only to Lang and Dorcas Williams, both {{of whom had been}} acting under the orders of a Marine Corps officer who had since been committed to <b>an</b> <b>insane</b> asylum. Both of the accused gendarmerie officers had been indicted by U.S. Navy court-martial prior to the hearings. A separate inquiry conducted by the Haitian government concluded that, outside of 10 killings attributed to Lang and Williams, the gendarmerie's conduct of the war had been justifiable.|$|E
5|$|In a {{telephone}} interview with Today's Zaman, in 2009, Finkelstein stated:I think Israel, {{as a number of}} commentators pointed out, is becoming <b>an</b> <b>insane</b> state. And we have to be honest about that. While {{the rest of the world}} wants peace, Europe wants peace, the US wants peace, but this state wants war, war and war. In the first week of the massacres, there were reports in the Israeli press that Israel did not want to put all its ground forces in Gaza because it was preparing attacks on Iran. Then there were reports it was planning attacks on Lebanon. It is a lunatic state.|$|E

5|$|Born in Salem, Massachusetts to two unwed first cousins, Jones Very became {{associated}} with Harvard University, first as an undergraduate, {{then as a}} student in the Harvard Divinity School and as a tutor of Greek.

Frohman is incredibly naïve and, unlike the other citizens, seems to enjoy living under the rule of the totalitarian administrator, Dr. Breen, and the Combine. He holds <b>an</b> <b>insane</b> reverence for the latter, even going to the point of having a plush doll of a Combine soldier.|$|E

5|$|There are few {{surviving}} sources {{about the}} reign of Caligula, although he {{is described as a}} noble and moderate emperor during {{the first six months of}} his rule. After this, the sources focus upon his cruelty, sadism, extravagance, and sexual perversion, presenting him as <b>an</b> <b>insane</b> tyrant. While the reliability of these sources is questionable, it is known that during his brief reign, Caligula worked to increase the unconstrained personal power of the emperor, as opposed to countervailing powers within the principate. He directed much of his attention to ambitious construction projects and luxurious dwellings for himself, and initiated the construction of two aqueducts in Rome: the Aqua Claudia and the Anio Novus. During his reign, the empire annexed the Kingdom of Mauretania as a province.|$|E
