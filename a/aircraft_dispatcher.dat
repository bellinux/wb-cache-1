50|$|ATP Flight School solely {{focuses on}} airline-oriented flight training, {{operating}} their programs with a fixed-cost, fixed timeframe training model, {{with an emphasis}} on multi-engine flight experience. ATP offers training programs for most all fixed-wing FAA pilot certificates and ratings. Other programs offered include type ratings, <b>aircraft</b> <b>dispatcher</b> certification, and the Airline Transport Pilot Certification Training Program (ATP CTP).|$|E
50|$|Part 65 is {{certification}} for airmen {{other than}} flight crewmembers; such as Air Traffic Control Tower Operators, <b>Aircraft</b> <b>Dispatchers,</b> Mechanics, Repairmen and Parachute Riggers.|$|R

5000|$|In 2013 Saudi Arabia {{registered}} {{its first}} female trainee lawyer, Arwa al-Hujaili, {{who is also}} the first Saudi woman to attain an <b>aircraft</b> <b>dispatcher</b> license. The same year, Saudi women were first allowed to ride bicycles, although only around parks and other [...] "recreational areas". They must also be dressed in full Islamic body coverings and be accompanied by a male relative.|$|E
50|$|A flight {{dispatcher}} (also {{known as an}} <b>aircraft</b> <b>dispatcher,</b> airline dispatcher, flight follower or flight operations officer) assists in planning flight paths, taking into account aircraft performance and loading, enroute winds, thunderstorm and turbulence forecasts, airspace restrictions, and airport conditions. Dispatchers also provide a flight following service and advise pilots if conditions change. They usually work in the operations center of the airline. In the United States and Canada, the {{flight dispatcher}} shares legal responsibility with {{the commander of the}} aircraft (joint responsibility dispatch system).|$|E
50|$|SkyRouter also enables {{pilots and}} {{operators}} to communicate by sending two-way messages. Both the communications solutions and global tracking are {{made possible by}} transceivers that are installed in the asset. The transceivers both transmit and receive data signals, constantly updating the position and events associated with the assets. In aviation applications, Automated Flight Following via SkyRouter allows the transmission of satellite messages from <b>aircraft</b> to <b>dispatchers</b> {{on the ground in}} the form of special events reports, such as updates on take-offs and landings, as well as telemetric data reports, and emergency location.|$|R
50|$|Indigo was a {{vertically}} integrated {{aviation company}} and owned, employed and controlled its own <b>aircraft</b> fleet, pilots, <b>dispatchers</b> and maintenance services. The company operated as a Federal Aviation Administration FAR Part 135 commercial operator, and was {{certified by the}} United States Department of Transportation under Parts 41101 and 380 as a public charter operator. Indigo was the first business jet commercial operator to receive an additional DOT fitness approval and was granted a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity.|$|R
50|$|A {{static line}} is a cord {{attached}} at {{one end to the}} aircraft and at the other end {{to the top of the}} jumper's 'D-Bag' (Deployment Bag, into which the canopy is packed). The parachutist's fall from the aircraft causes the static line to become taut, this then pulls the D-Bag out of the container on the jumper's back. The static line and D-Bag stay with the aircraft as the jumper leaves, and is pulled back into the <b>aircraft</b> by the <b>dispatcher.</b> Now free of its D-Bag, the canopy is allowed to inflate as the jumper continues to fall. Effectively, the jumper drags the parachute behind him, causing the upward-rushing wind to force open and inflate the canopy. The canopy should inflate and begin supporting the jumper within 4 seconds. In the unlikely event of a malfunction, students are taught how to cut away the main canopy and deploy the reserve chute. The aim of static line progression is to train students to maintain the correct, stable body position upon exiting the aircraft, and to teach how to deploy the canopy via the pilot chute mechanism.|$|R
50|$|In some jurisdictions of the US, similar {{duties and}} {{responsibilities}} are designated to flight followers. The main {{difference between the}} <b>aircraft</b> <b>dispatcher</b> and the flight follower is that the latter does not share legal responsibility for the operation of a flight. During the flight, the dispatcher is required to monitor and advise the crew of changes affecting safety of flight. In flight following, ultimate responsibility and operational control of the flight rests with the Pilot in command and Director of Operations (DO). Flight followers work for the Director of Operations and are tasked with carrying out operational control functions. Flight followers {{are not required to}} attain a flight dispatcher's certificate, although they are usually encouraged to do so.|$|E
