5|$|<b>Airborne</b> <b>radar</b> for {{detecting}} ships at sea {{came to be}} known as Air-to-Surface-Vessel (ASV) radar. Its successes led to continued demands for additional tests. Growing interest and increased efforts in ASV contributed to delays in airborne intercept sets; the team spent a considerable time in 1937 and 1938 working on the ASV problem.|$|E
5|$|Since 1942 {{research}} and development into physics and electronics has been {{the major source of}} employment in Malvern when during World War II the Telecommunications Research Establishment (TRE) moved from Worth Matravers on the south coast for safety from enemy action.

5|$|In 2008, the British Antarctic Survey {{reported}} a volcanic eruption under the Antarctica ice sheet 2,200 years ago. It {{is believed to}} be that this was the biggest eruption in Antarctica in the last 10,000 years. Volcanic ash deposits from the volcano were identified through an <b>airborne</b> <b>radar</b> survey, buried under later snowfalls in the Hudson Mountains, close to Pine Island Glacier.|$|E

50|$|AIRPASS (<b>Airborne</b> Interception <b>Radar</b> & Pilot's Attack Sight System) was {{an early}} British <b>airborne</b> {{interception}} <b>radar</b> and fire-control radar system developed by Ferranti. It was the world's first <b>airborne</b> monopulse <b>radar</b> system.|$|R
5|$|The Gneiss-2 <b>airborne</b> <b>radar</b> was {{evaluated}} in the Pe-3 beginning in July 1942 {{and it was}} sent to both Moscow and Stalingrad for combat trials in late 1942. Another round of trials was conducted by aircraft of the 2nd Guards Fighter Corps of the PVO in Leningrad between February and May 1943 and it was approved for service the next month. Very few {{appear to have been}} deployed as only fifteen were fitted on Pe-3s.|$|E
5|$|All four {{receiver}} antennas {{were connected}} via separate {{leads to a}} motorized switch that selected {{each one of the}} inputs in turn, sending it into the amplifier. The output was then switched, using the same system, to one of four inputs into the CRTs. The entire radar dipole aerial setup for the AI Mk.IV was simple in comparison to the 32-dipole Matratze (mattress) transceiving array fitted to the noses of the earliest German night fighters to use AI radar, for their own UHF-band Lichtenstein B/C <b>airborne</b> <b>radar</b> design from 1942–43.|$|E
5|$|In November 1941, Schnaufer {{was posted}} to the II. Gruppe of Nachtjagdgeschwader 1 (II./NJG1—2nd {{group of the}} 1st Night Fighter Wing) at the time based at Stade near Hamburg. Here, Schnaufer was {{assigned}} to the 5. Staffel (5./NJG1—5th squadron of 1st Night Fighter Wing). The Bf 110's of II./NJG1 at the time were not equipped with <b>airborne</b> <b>radar</b> such as the Lichtenstein radar. Night fighter intercept tactics had matured since their early beginnings in July 1940, and II. Gruppe had already been credited with 397 victories. Missions against enemy bombers at the time were usually flown by means of ground-controlled interception, although the Luftwaffe was already experimenting with <b>airborne</b> <b>radar.</b> This air defence system, consisting of a series of radar stations with overlapping coverage, layered three deep, was conceived by Generalleutnant (lit. Lieutenant General; equivalent to Major General) Josef Kammhuber and was organised in the so-called Kammhuber Line. Conceptually, the system was based on a combination of ground-based radar stations, search lights and a Jägerleitoffizier (fighter pilot control officer). The Jägerleitoffizier had to vector the airborne night fighter by means of radio communication to a point of visual interception of the illuminated bomber. These interception tactics were referred to as the Himmelbett (canopy bed) procedure.|$|E

5|$|In {{a desperate}} attempt to improve the {{situation}} and hamper British operations, a number of experienced night fighter commanders and pilots suggested restarting intruder operations over England. In 1940–41, German night fighters, lacking <b>airborne</b> <b>radar</b> sets and a means to locate them over Germany, had flown to British bomber bases and attempted to destroy RAF bombers as they returned from their missions. Adolf Hitler had ordered a cessation of these activities for propaganda and practical reasons but these operations had met with reasonable success in 1941 and it was felt they may do so again.|$|E
5|$|At de Havilland he {{was awarded}} a salary of £1,500 in a company that had {{expanded}} enormously during the war. The number of employees rose from 5,000 to 38,000. The turnover of the company had gone from £1.5 million before the war to £25 million and was now supported by around 100 factories. Cunningham now took the title of chief test pilot of the de Havilland Engine Company {{under the supervision of}} Geoffrey de Havilland Jr. Cunningham served as a pilot and consultant in a series of deals with the Swedish Air Force and Swiss Air Force. Both countries were keen to employ him but Cunningham visited only to deliver and advise on the de Havilland Vampire and British <b>airborne</b> <b>radar</b> design. In 1990 the Swiss presented him with the spade-grip from the control column mounted on a wooden stand when they withdrew the last of their Vampires. When the Swedes retired the machine in 1997 he was invited to celebrate its 50 years of Swedish service.|$|E
5|$|Having {{lost all}} of its Bristol Blenheim night fighters in the raid of 16 August, Tangmere {{dispatched}} two Hurricanes from the Fighter Interception Unit (FIU) fitted with FIU <b>airborne</b> <b>radar</b> to test the device in action. RAF Coastal Command also joined in, and committed No. 235 Squadron RAF and its Bristol Blenheims. The defence was reliant on the 68 Spitfires and Hurricanes. The numerical standing meant a ratio of one RAF fighter to every four German fighters and bombers, or in other words, one British aircraft to every two German fighters. Even had the fighter controllers realised {{the strength of the}} raid, there was little that could be done. Other fighters were refuelling and rearming after the attacks on Kenley and Biggin Hill and would not be available.|$|E

25|$|<b>Airborne</b> Interception <b>radar,</b> Mark VIII, or AI Mk. VIII for short, was {{the first}} {{operational}} microwave-frequency air-to-air radar. It was used by Royal Air Force night fighters from late 1941 {{until the end of}} World War II. The basic concept, using a moving parabolic antenna to search for targets and track them accurately, remained in use by most <b>airborne</b> <b>radars</b> well into the 1980s.|$|R
5|$|In January 2008 the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) scientists, Hugh Corr and David Vaughan, {{reported}} that 2,200years ago a volcano erupted under the Antarctic ice sheet. This {{was the biggest}} Antarctic eruption in the last 10,000years. The volcano is situated in the Hudson Mountains, close to Pine Island Glacier. The eruption spread a layer of volcanic ash (or tephra) {{over the surface of}} the ice sheet. This ash was then buried under the snow and ice. Corr and Vaughan were able to map this ash layer using an <b>airborne</b> <b>radar</b> system and calculate the date of the eruption from the depth of burial of the ash. This method uses dates calculated from nearby ice cores. The presence of the volcano raises the possibility that volcanic activity could have contributed, or may contribute in the future, to increases in the flow of the glacier.|$|E
5|$|The next day, 21 January 1944, Sayn-Wittgenstein, {{wireless}} operator Ostheimer {{and board}} mechanic Unteroffizier Kurt Matzuleit {{took off on}} a Zahme Sau (Tame Boar), a combination of ground controlled and <b>airborne</b> <b>radar,</b> night fighter intercept mission flying the Ju88R4+XM (Werknummer 750 467—factory number), which normally {{was assigned to the}} Technical Officer of NJG2. At 22:00 contact with the first of five Lancasters was established and shot down which was observed to explode at 22:05. Between 22:10 and 22:15 the second Lancaster was shot down. Observers reported the third Lancaster exploded at approximately 22:30, followed shortly by number four, which hit the ground at 22:40. During the fifth and final attack, the four-engined bomber was burning when their Ju 88 came under attack, presumably from British fighter escorts. In the attack, their left wing caught fire. Sayn-Wittgenstein ordered his crew to jump, and Ostheimer and Matzuleit parachuted to safety from the damaged aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Schnaufer had to {{wait two}} months to achieve another victory, {{claiming}} the destruction of two Vickers Wellingtons and one Armstrong Whitworth Whitley within the space of 62 minutes {{in the early hours}} of 1 August. Rumpelhardt and Schnaufer flew their first combat mission with the Lichtenstein radar on the night 5/6 August 1942. Though they managed to make contact with an enemy aircraft they failed to shoot it down. On the night of the 24/25 August 1942, Schnaufer became an ace (his fifth aerial victory), when he filed a claim for another Wellington. This was the first time Rumpelhardt had guided him into contact using the FuG 202 Lichtenstein B/C UHF-band <b>airborne</b> <b>radar.</b> His next claim was made on the night of 28/29 August. This was probably a No. 78 Squadron Halifax II W7809, piloted by Sergeant John A. B. Marshall of the Royal Australian Air Force, on a secondary attack against Saarbrücken. The primary attack force was targeting Nuremberg that night. On the night of the 21/22 December 1942, Schnaufer shot down an Avro Lancaster; his first victory against this type. It was Schnaufer's seventh victory. Schnaufer may also have been responsible for the destruction of another Lancaster that night. Rumpelhardt and Schnaufer had attacked a Lancaster and observed it catching fire followed by the aircraft plunging earthwards. Hauptmann Wilhelm Herget from I./Nachtjagdgeschwader 4 (I./NJG4—1st group of the 4th Night Fighter Wing) had also attacked a four-engined bomber in the same vicinity. The draw decided in favour of Herget who was given credit for the destruction of the Lancaster.|$|E

5|$|The Germans quickly {{developed}} {{a series of}} basic tactics for intercepting enemy intruders. The lack of <b>airborne</b> <b>radar</b> {{at this stage in}} the war meant finding and destroying Allied bombers at night was a difficult prospect, thus it was decided to use the Fernnachtjagd in operations over Britain. Major Kuhlmann, head of the wireless telegraphy interception service played a significant part in assisting the Luftwaffe night fighter force as did Wolfgang Martini's Luftnachrichtentruppe (Air Signal Corps). Intercepting British signal communications by monitoring the radio traffic of enemy ground stations and aircraft the Germans could determine where and at what airfields RAF night activity was occurring. With the British base identified Falck could then move against them over their own airfields. Three waves could then be deployed; one to attack the bombers as they took off, one to cover the known routes taken by the enemy over the North Sea, and the third to attack them on landing at a time when, after a long flight, enemy crews were tired and much less alert. For operational purposes, Eastern England was divided into four regions or Räume (areas). Raum A was Yorkshire, bounded by Hull, Leeds, Lancaster and Newcastle. Raum B covered the Midlands and Lincolnshire whilst Raum C encompassed East Anglia bounded by London Peterborough, Luton and The Wash. Operations began in earnest in October 1940.|$|E

40|$|Emerging {{technologies}} such as wireless local area networks and cellular telephones have dramatically increased the use of wireless communications services within the last 10 years. The shortage of available spectrum exists due to increasing demand for wireless services and current spectrum allocation regulations. To alleviate this shortage, Research aims to improve spectral efficiency and to allow spectrum sharing between separately managed and non-coordinating communications systems. This thesis explores the feasibility of spectrum sharing between <b>airborne</b> weather <b>radar</b> and wireless local area networks at 9. 3 GHz – 9. 5 GHz. Characteristics of flight paths of aircraft using <b>airborne</b> weather <b>radar</b> and the low duty cycle of radar transmissions offer unique opportunities for spectrum sharing. But {{it was found that}} the extremely sensitive receivers provide challenges for designing a communications system meant for widespread use. The probability of causing harmful interference to <b>airborne</b> weather <b>radar</b> is too great for most types of wireless local area networks, but a direct sequence spread spectrum scheme could share spectrum with <b>airborne</b> weather <b>radar.</b> Bit errors in wireless local area network links caused by <b>airborne</b> weather <b>radar</b> interference do not significantly decrease the performance of the wireless local area network system. The distribution of interference outside of the <b>airborne</b> weather <b>radar</b> receiver by using direct sequence spread spectrum combined with the acceptable bit error rates indicate that while spectrum sharing between <b>airborne</b> weather <b>radar</b> and wireless local area network at 9. 3 GHz – 9. 5 GHz is not feasible, direct sequence spread spectrum systems can share spectrum with <b>airborne</b> weather <b>radars</b> under more limited assumptions...|$|R
