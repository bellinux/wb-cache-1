25|$|Biosequestration as {{a natural}} process has {{occurred}} in the past, and was responsible for the formation of the extensive coal and oil deposits which are now being burned. It is a key policy concept in the climate change mitigation debate. It does not generally refer to the sequestering of carbon dioxide in oceans (see carbon sequestration and ocean acidification) or rock formations, depleted oil or gas reservoirs (see oil depletion and peak oil), deep saline aquifers, or deep coal seams (see coal mining) (for <b>all</b> <b>see</b> geosequestration) or through the use of industrial chemical carbon dioxide scrubbing.|$|E
25|$|Most, but not <b>all</b> (<b>see</b> fr. Multiregional {{origin of}} modern humans), {{scientists}} in the relevant fields consider this observation robust. This common direct ancestor {{in the line of}} mother to daughter (or mitochondrial most recent common ancestor (mtMRCA)) of all extant humans has become known as Mitochondrial Eve. (Mitochondria are inherited from the mother only.) The observation that the mtMRCA is the direct matrilineal ancestor of all living humans does not mean either that she was the first anatomically modern woman, nor that no other women lived concurrently with her, nor even excluding the existence of other women being ancestors of today's people. Other women would have lived {{at the same time and}} passed nuclear genes down to living humans, but their mitochondrial lineages were lost over time. This could be due to events such as producing only male children.|$|E
25|$|Shape - The third episode {{features}} Trinny and Susannah {{exploring the}} theme of shape, where they promote wearing clothes suitable to body shape rather than clothing size. Trinny and Susannah get 60 size 16 women to wear an identical size 16 dress in order to discover how many women the dress fits properly. They find that the dress only fits two women, despite all 60 being classed as a size 16. To explore how women see their own bodies, the duo take their pink box in which women can draw their impressions of themselves, finding that they <b>all</b> <b>see</b> their bodies in different shapes. Then 60 of the women from the investigation are introduced to 12 different objects which Trinny and Susannah believe can represent all women's body shapes. The shapes include 'apple', 'hourglass', 'skittle', 'vase', 'cornet', 'lollipop', 'column', 'bell', 'goblet', 'cello', 'pear' and 'brick'. The different objects are displayed around a gallery where twelve women with tightly fitted outfits, to show their figures clearly, stand next to the object which they best represent to demonstrate the general idea. Each model is then given a makeover {{according to the rules}} which Trinny and Susannah have applied to each body shape. The rest of the women are then required to go shopping to buy themselves clothes, complying with the rules. Only the women with the correct shape clothes receive their money back. Also around the town are the 12 live manikins, standing by a list of the rules for their body shape.|$|E

World Humanitarian Day is an opportunity {{for all of us to}} work together to make a difference. This is our time to leave our mark on the world and show that we were here and we care." [...] During another interview posted on the UN website, Beyoncé said she was attracted to raising awareness on the day of recognition: [...] "I found out that 22 people lost their lives helping people [...] I thought it was such an incredible thing to turn that into something positive and try to include the world into doing something great for someone else". Another inspiration for Beyoncé to participate in the campaign were the finalists at the 2012 Do Something Awards and their humanitarian work.|$|E
500|$|Production {{designer}} Cory Kaplan {{explains how}} she was attracted {{to the idea of}} using primitive materials when she states, [...] "We <b>all</b> <b>see</b> super-tech now, but the idea of low-tech was much more interesting to me, much more visual. So, you take elements of rock and steel and chisel them into interesting shapes." [...] She also describes the creation of the set by stating, [...] "I found the backdrop from Alien, and Bill Roe lit it very dimly and put it behind. And it was just this rotating platform with this humongous dental piece that could rotate around as well and pull his face apart." [...] According to Makeup Supervisor Cheri Montasanto-Medcalf, Matthew Mungle helped {{in the creation of the}} alien torture machine by making the cheeks and putting the hooks in. The makeup supervisor adds that the hooks would actually stretch out and that David Duchovny [...] "sat pretty good through all that." ...|$|E
500|$|After John {{receives}} {{a call from}} Mortimer that Henry has run off with a gun, John, Sherlock and Lestrade run to the hollow to find Henry about to commit suicide. Sherlock explains the hound was an hallucination; his father was actually killed by Frankland, who was wearing a gas mask and a sweatshirt with [...] "H.O.U.N.D. Liberty, In" [...] on it; a child couldn't cope with this, so his mind tricked him. Every time Henry came back, Frankland gassed him with the hallucinogen; the chemical agent is the fog they encountered at the hollow, triggered by pressure pads in the area. As Henry calms down, they <b>all</b> <b>see</b> the innkeepers' dog; John shoots it. Sherlock finds and catches Frankland at the scene. Henry realises that Frankland murdered Henry's father, because he found him testing the drug. Frankland flees into the base's minefield and gets blown up. As Sherlock and John prepare to leave the next morning, John wonders why he saw the hound in the lab despite not having inhaled the gas from the hollow. Sherlock surmises that John was poisoned by the leaking pipes in the laboratory, and John realises Sherlock locked him in the labs {{in order to test}} his theory. He also points out Sherlock was wrong for once; he believed the drug was in Henry's sugar and put it in John's coffee.|$|E

2500|$|Most Christians {{understand}} these miraculous resurrections {{to be of}} a different nature than the resurrection of Jesus and the future resurrection of the dead. The raising of Lazarus and others from the dead could also be called [...] "resuscitations" [...] or [...] "reanimations", since the life given to them is presumably temporary in nature—there is no suggestion in the Bible or hagiographic traditions that these people became truly immortal.

2500|$|The {{language}} was {{a descendant of}} the Proto-Slavic language and faithfully retained many of its features. A striking innovation {{in the evolution of}} this {{language was}} the development of so-called pleophony (or polnoglasie 'full vocalisation'), which came to differentiate the newly evolving East Slavic from other Slavic dialects. For instance, Common Slavic *gordъ 'settlement, town' was reflected as OESl. gorodъ, Common Slavic [...] 'milk' > OESl. moloko, and Common Slavic [...] 'cow' > OESl korova. Other Slavic dialects are differed by resolving the closed-syllable clusters *eRC and *aRC as liquid metathesis (South Slavic and West Slavic), or by no change at <b>all</b> (<b>see</b> the article on Slavic liquid metathesis and pleophony for a detailed account).|$|E
