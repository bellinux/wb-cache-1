5|$|When Lord Melbourne loses {{a vote in}} Parliament, the new Prime Minister designate, Sir Robert Peel, {{wishes to}} replace some of her ladies-in-waiting with {{supporters}} {{of his own party}} and the queen refuses. Peel in turn refuses the queen's invitation to form a new government, allowing Melbourne to continue as Prime Minister. The subsequent crisis damages Victoria's popularity, leading to demonstrations outside the palace and insults hurled <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>in</b> public. Her loneliness during the turbulence draws Victoria closer to Albert through their letters and she decides to invite him back to Britain. Since protocol prevents him suggesting marriage, she proposes to him herself.|$|E
5|$|One {{particular}} aspect {{that led}} to disagreement amongst {{the cast and crew}} was the genuine killing of animals. Kerman stormed off the set while the death of the coatimundi was filmed, and Yorke refused to participate in the killing of a pig, which he was originally scripted to execute, leaving the duty to Luca Barbareschi. When it was shot, the squeal of the pig subsequently caused Yorke to botch a long monologue, and retakes were not an option because they had no access to additional pigs. Perry Pirkanen cried after filming the butchering of a turtle, and crew members vomited off camera when a squirrel monkey was killed for the film. Actress Francesca Ciardi also objected to the film's sexual content {{and did not want to}} bare her breasts during the sex scene between her and Carl Yorke. When she refused to comply with Deodato's direction, he dragged her off the set and screamed <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>in</b> Italian. She had earlier suggested that she and Yorke actually have sex in the jungle before filming in order to relieve the tension of the upcoming scene. When Yorke declined, she grew upset with him, alienating him for the rest of the shoot.|$|E
25|$|The {{trial began}} on January 24, 1995 and was {{televised}} by Court TV {{and in part}} by other cable and network news outlets for 134 days. Los Angeles County prosecutor Christopher Darden argued that Simpson killed his ex-wife in a jealous rage. The prosecution opened its case by playing a 9-1-1 call from Nicole Brown Simpson on January 1, 1989. She expressed fear that Simpson would physically harm her, and he could be heard yelling <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>in</b> the background. Other material related to domestic violence was presented. The prosecution also presented dozens of expert witnesses to place Simpson {{at the scene of}} the crime, on subjects ranging from DNA profiling to blood and shoeprint analysis.|$|E

50|$|Herring was {{originally}} called Weed, {{and under the}} latter name was platted in 1899. The community was renamed <b>Herring</b> <b>in</b> 1901, in honor of a local pioneer settler.

25|$|Reconciling with Lizaveta Prokofyevna, the Prince {{visits the}} Yepanchins at their dacha. He is {{beginning}} {{to fall in love}} with Aglaya, and she likewise appears to be fascinated by him, though she often mocks or angrily reproaches him for his naiveté and excessive humility. Myshkin joins Lizaveta Prokofyevna, her daughters and Yevgeny Pavlovich for a walk to the park to hear the music. While listening to the high-spirited conversation and watching Aglaya in a kind of daze, he notices Rogozhin and Nastassya Filippovna in the crowd. Nastassya Filippovna again addresses herself to Yevgeny Pavlovich, and in the same jolly tone as before loudly informs him that his uncle—a wealthy and respected old man from whom he is expecting a large inheritance—has shot himself and that a huge sum of government money is missing. Yevgeny Pavlovich stares <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>in</b> shock as Lizaveta Prokofyevna makes a hurried exit with her daughters. Nastassya Filippovna hears an officer friend of Yevgeny Pavlovich suggest that a whip is needed for women like her, and she responds by grabbing a riding-whip from a bystander and striking the officer across the face with it. He tries to attack her but Myshkin restrains him, for which he is violently pushed. Rogozhin, after making a mocking comment to the officer, leads Nastassya Filippovna away. The officer recovers his composure, addresses himself to Myshkin, politely confirms his name, and leaves.|$|E
25|$|Hantuchová beat Tatiana Golovin in {{straight}} sets, before losing to Dinara Safina. The following week, {{she reached the}} quarterfinals of Stuttgart with an easy victory over the then top-10 player Safina in the second round. This was both her first victory over a top-10 player and first appearance in a quarterfinal since January. In October 2006, Hantuchová reached {{the final of the}} Zurich Open. In the first round, she upset sixth seed Patty Schnyder. In the second round, she defeated her doubles partner Ai Sugiyama. Hantuchová was then scheduled to play world No. 1 Amélie Mauresmo in the quarterfinals. However, Mauresmo withdrew due to a right shoulder injury. In the semifinals, Hantuchová upset world No. 4 Svetlana Kuznetsova, 6–4, 6–2, to reach the final of the Tier I event. In the final, Hantuchová lost in a tight three-setter to second seed Maria Sharapova, 1–6, 6–4, 3–6. The results in this tournament were the culmination of Hantuchová's up-turn of form, which kept her in the top 20, as she had arrived in Zurich outside the top group {{for the first time in}} over 11 months. The injury she suffered to her right rib after Mary Pierce hit a shot <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>in</b> doubles, caused her the most serious injury of her career and also forced her to retire in her match against Vesnina the following week in Linz. Hantuchová finished the year ranked No. 17 in the world, with a 34–25 record. She went 24–17 on hard courts, 5–4 on clay, 3–2 on grass, and 2–2 on carpet. She was 4–6 against top-10 players, beating Schnyder twice, Safina, and Kuznetsova, with losses to Sharapova (twice), Clijsters, Henin-Hardenne, Dementieva, and Nadia Petrova.|$|E

Harry is dating Sally's friend Amanda. During the drive, Harry and Sally discuss their differing ideas about relationships; Sally disagrees with Harry's assertion {{that men and women}} cannot be friends, as [...] "the sex part gets in the way". At a diner, Sally is angered when Harry tells her she is attractive; she accuses him of making a pass <b>at</b> <b>her.</b> <b>In</b> New York, they part on unfriendly terms.|$|E

500|$|Eventually, the Skinkers found {{a man in}} London {{willing to}} marry Tannakin. On {{the day of the}} wedding, and despite all efforts to improve her appearance, her face was as pig-like as ever. With the wedding service concluded, the newly-wed couple retired to the bedroom. When they lay in bed {{together}} for the first time, Tannakin reached for her husband's arm, saying that she would release him from his vows provided that he would look <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>in</b> the face. He turned to look at her, and saw [...] "a sweet young Lady of incomparable beauty and feature, the like to whom to his imagination he never had in his whole life time beheld". He reached to kiss her, but she refused, saying: ...|$|E
500|$|She {{was nearly}} sunk by the [...] on 5 January 1916 when the {{destroyer}} fired seven torpedoes <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>in</b> {{a case of}} mistaken identity; luckily they all missed. Three days later she encountered the Ottoman battlecruiser Yavuz at long range. The ships opened fire at about [...] and Yavuz only got off five salvoes before she disengaged from the slower Russian dreadnought without damaging her. Imperatritsa Ekaterina Velikaya fired 96 shells from her longer-ranged guns, but inflicted only splinter damage on Yavuz before she pulled out of range. Six months later both Imperatritsa Ekaterina Velikaya and her half-sister , alerted by intercepted radio transmissions, sortied from Sevastopol {{in an attempt to}} intercept Yavuz as she returned from a bombardment of the Russian port of Tuapse on 4 July. Yavuz dodged north and avoided the Russians by paralleling the Bulgarian coastline back to the Bosphorus.|$|E
500|$|Two of Bosse's older sisters, Alma (1863–1947) and Dagmar (1866–1954), {{were already}} {{successful}} performers when Harriet {{was a small}} child. [...] Inspired by these role models, Harriet began her acting career in a Norwegian touring company run by her sister Alma and Alma's husband Johan Fahlstrøm (1867–1938). [...] Invited to play Juliet in Romeo and Juliet, the eighteen-year-old Harriet reported {{in a letter to}} her sister Inez that she had been paralysed by stage-fright before the premiere, but had then taken delight in the performance, the curtain-calls, and the way people stared <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>in</b> the street the next day. [...] Alma was Harriet's first and only—rather authoritarian—acting teacher. Their harmonious and sisterly teacher–pupil relationship became strained when Alma discovered that her husband Johan and Harriet were having an affair. [...] Both Bosse parents were now dead, and Harriet, ordered by Alma to leave, used a modest legacy from her father to finance studies in Stockholm, Copenhagen, and Paris.|$|E

500|$|On a few episodes, Phineas {{shows an}} angrier side of himself, first {{seen in the}} [...] movie, where Phineas gets angry at Perry after finding out his secret {{identity}} because Perry [...] "never trusted him" [...] by telling him the truth, but later realizes that Perry kept his identity hidden because if Phineas and his family found out, Perry {{would be forced to}} relocate to another family. Another episode, [...] again demonstrates Phineas' angry side, when he got angry at Candace when she accidentally caused Baljeet to turn into a Hulk-type version of himself, but they later made amends {{at the end of the}} episode. Later, on [...] "Phineas and Ferb Save Summer", when Candace tries to power-up the machine, Phineas starts raising his voice <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>in</b> order for her to stop, to which Buford breaks the fourth wall by saying: [...] "Must be a special episode, he's yelling at his sister again!".|$|E
500|$|The mainly {{computer}} generated music video for [...] "Play" [...] {{was directed by}} Francis Lawrence. Set in a futuristic multi-level spaceship, the clip begins with Lopez strutting into the boarding area whilst the other passengers gaze <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>in</b> awe. The video then cuts to Lopez, now on the plane, relaxing {{with a pair of}} headphones on listening to music. Various shots showing the plane's exterior are inter cut with these scenes of the singer. Lopez is then seen entering a room through sliding doors with a new outfit. The doors lead to a club filled with dancers. Intercut with these scenes are Lopez dancing solo on a platform, later joined by back-up dancers. Towards the music video's conclusion, Lopez asks the DJ (who takes the avatar of an iris) to play her favorite song. Its final shot depicts the plane flying towards the horizon. The music video, much like [...] "Love Don't Cost a Thing", also features Cris Judd as a back-up dancer, who would later go on to become her second husband months later.|$|E
500|$|Writer and {{executive}} producer Howard Gordon was originally working on an episode about someone {{who appeared to be}} immortal, but after discussions with consulting producer Ken Horton he added in the notion of xenophobia and [...] "melanin-sucking albino vampires". Series creator Chris Carter approved the storyline, but the first draft of the script was met with disapproval by the writing staff, and the story was restructured and rewritten. As the episode entered pre-production, Carter asked Gordon to refine the script to give it a purpose, and it was then that Gordon came up with the theme of [...] "deceive, inveigle, and obfuscate". This phrase is first spoken by Scully in conversation with Mulder after the post mortem on Owen Sanders, the fourth missing man. Mulder later throws the same phrase back <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>in</b> frustration as he leaves the Mt Zion Medical Center (where Aboah has been examined) to meet Diabra, the Burkinabe diplomat. And Scully finally uses the phrase in her field journal during her closing sentiments.|$|E

500|$|At the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign {{she belonged}} to Kappa Kappa Gamma {{sorority}} where she befriended a beautiful older sorority sister, [...] "the prettiest I had ever seen", quite popular {{with men and}} with women. Bannon witnessed a younger sorority sister's unabashed infatuation with the older sister. She recalls it was an awkward situation, even though the older sorority sister was [...] "unfailingly gracious" [...] to the younger one. In recognizing the younger woman's attractions, she began to suspect her own sexuality. She said, [...] "I {{saw a lot of}} it happening and I didn't {{know what to make of}} it. I don't even know how to put it—I was absolutely consumed with it, it was an extraordinary thing." [...] Another sorority sister was physically remarkable, very tall—almost , with a husky voice and boyish nickname, that Bannon imagined was a blend of Johnny Weissmuller and Ingrid Bergman. She recalled entering the communal restroom and seeing the sister, [...] "both of us in underwear, and experienc(ing) a sort of electric shock", and trying not to stare <b>at</b> <b>her.</b> <b>In</b> 1954, she graduated with a degree in French and soon married an engineer whose job made them relocate frequently.|$|E
500|$|Mia Farrow, who {{had come}} and gone from the ashram before, left again and drifted around India before {{returning}} to the United States. Geoffrey Giuliano in Revolver: The Secret History of the Beatles says that, before leaving, she told the Beatles that the Maharishi had made a pass at her. Ned Wynn, one of Farrow's childhood friends, wrote in his 1990 memoir that she had told him in the early 1970s that the Maharishi had definitely made sexual passes <b>at</b> <b>her.</b> <b>In</b> her 1993 autobiography, Cooke de Herrera wrote that Farrow had confided to her, before the arrival of the Beatles, that the Maharishi had made a pass during a private puja ceremony by stroking her hair. Cooke de Herrera wrote that she told Farrow that she had misinterpreted the Maharishi's actions. Farrow's 1997 memoirs are ambiguous, describing an encounter with the Maharishi in his private meditation [...] "cave" [...] when he tried to put his arms around her. She reports that her sister Prudence told her that it was [...] "an honour" [...] and [...] "a tradition" [...] for a [...] "holy man" [...] to touch someone after meditation.|$|E
500|$|Barrowman {{states in}} a behind-the-scenes {{featurette}} that Gwen brings a [...] "little bit of soul" [...] back to Jack, following her recruitment. In a 2007 interview, Eve Myles, who plays Gwen, describes the relationship between Jack and Gwen as a [...] "palpable love" [...] and opines that [...] "with Jack and Gwen, it’s the real thing and they’re {{going to make you}} wait for that." [...] The first two series suggest the possibility of romantic and sexual tension behind Jack and Gwen's working relationship, with Stephen James Walker drawing on the firing range sequence in series one episode [...] "Ghost Machine" [...] as a key example, as well as the scene where Jack discovers that Gwen has become engaged to Rhys in [...] "Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang", the series two opener. AfterElton.com's Locksley Hall conjectures that Jack is attracted to Gwen because of [...] "her warmth, her sense of justice, her very ordinariness and lack of glamour", whilst Eve Myles explains Gwen's attraction to Jack by stating: [...] "the most monogamous woman in the world would probably go for him– it'd be hard not to". Valerie Estelle Frankel describes Jack as a [...] "compelling trickster", who acts out Gwen's private desires with his [...] "outrageous flirting". She suggests that Jack (unlike Rhys) is not mature enough to occupy the role of [...] "steady prince" [...] for Gwen, whilst Barrowman feels that if Jack were to settle down with her, [...] "he'd have to commit completely"; this is why he does not act on his feelings, because though Gwen would let him flirt with other people, he could [...] "never afford to do anything more". Gareth David-Lloyd, who played Ianto, feels that for Jack, [...] "there’s two different sorts of love going on there", and that Jack feels for Gwen and Ianto in different ways, although both have helped him become less emotionally isolated. [...] Lynnette Porter feels that part of the reason Jack leaves Earth at the conclusion of Children of Earth is Gwen's idealisation of Jack, which is so intense that he cannot stand to look <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>in</b> the wake of Ianto's death. Gwen hopes that she is reason enough for Jack to stay on Earth, but Jack is ready to give up any hero worship because he feels unworthy.|$|E
