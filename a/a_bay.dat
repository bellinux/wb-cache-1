5|$|A {{laboratory}} {{study examined the}} effects on the Antarctic scallop {{of an increase in}} lead, copper and mercury content in the water. It was found that a rise in levels of heavy metals led to quite severe morphological changes in the scallop and a reduction in lysosomal membrane stability. Another experiment involved transplanting scallops from a clean water area to <b>a</b> <b>bay</b> where effluent from an Antarctic base was released. It was found that the scallops were relatively unaffected by the outflows and this resulted in the belief that benthic marine communities were unlikely to be severely affected by such discharges.|$|E

5|$|Chesham {{also had}} {{extensive}} goods facilities, particularly for coal; the goods yard was initially {{equipped with a}} mobile 5-ton crane, replaced by a fixed 8-ton crane between 1898–1900. The outward transport of watercress, a major local industry, also generated significant traffic. During the electrification of the line in 1957–60 the station was equipped with <b>a</b> <b>bay</b> platform for passenger trains, {{to allow it to}} accommodate both through services to and from Baker Street and the Chalfont& Latimer–Chesham shuttle simultaneously. This bay platform was closed on 29 November 1970 and is now a garden.|$|E
5|$|Dolphin drive hunting, {{also called}} dolphin drive fishing, {{is a method}} of hunting {{dolphins}} and occasionally other small cetaceans by driving them together with boats and then usually into <b>a</b> <b>bay</b> or onto a beach. Their escape is prevented by closing off the route to the open sea or ocean with boats and nets. Dolphins are hunted this way in several places around the world, including the Solomon Islands, the Faroe Islands, Peru, and Japan, the most well-known practitioner of this method. By numbers, dolphins are mostly hunted for their meat; some end up in dolphinariums.|$|E
5|$|Green Grocer (set number: 10185) was {{the third}} of the Modular Buildings series. It was {{originally}} released in 2008.

5|$|In Japan, {{the hunting}} {{is done by}} {{a select group of}} fishermen. When a pod of {{dolphins}} has been spotted, they're driven into <b>a</b> <b>bay</b> by the fishermen while banging on metal rods in the water to scare and confuse the dolphins. When the dolphins are in the bay, it is quickly closed off with nets so the dolphins cannot escape. The dolphins are usually not caught and killed immediately, but instead left to calm down over night. The following day, the dolphins are caught one by one and killed.|$|E

The protest, led by Black Lives Matter co-founder Alicia Garza, was organized in response to the grand jury decision not to indict Darren Wilson for the death of Mike Brown.|$|E
5|$|Locally, {{many of the}} {{regional}} governmental agencies and districts recognize the nine counties that border the San Francisco, San Pablo, and Suisun estuaries {{as part of the}} Bay Area: Alameda, Contra Costa, Marin, Napa, San Francisco, San Mateo, Santa Clara, Solano, and Sonoma counties.

5|$|Orme was <b>a</b> <b>bay</b> colt born in 1889 at Eaton Stud in Cheshire. He was bred by the 1st Duke of Westminster. Orme stood 16 hands {{high and}} had a large white star, with no other white markings. His sire was the unbeaten 2000 Guineas, Epsom Derby and St. Leger winner Ormonde. Orme was one of Ormonde's first crop of foals. By the time Orme reached a racecourse, Ormonde had been {{exported}} to Argentina. Ormonde did not become a great sire due to fertility problems, producing only a few foals most years. However, he did also sire Goldfinch, a horse that was a top class two-year-old and won the New Stakes. In the United States, he sired Futurity Stakes winner Ormondale. Orme was clear-winded, unlike his sire, who was a roarer.|$|E
