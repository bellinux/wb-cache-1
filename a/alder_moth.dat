50|$|The <b>alder</b> <b>moth</b> (Acronicta alni) is a moth of {{the family}} Noctuidae. It is found in Europe (from {{southern}} Fennoscandia to Spain, Italy and the Balkans), Turkey, the European part of Russia and the neighbouring countries, the Caucasus, the Ural, southern Siberia, Transbaikalia, the Russian Far East (Primorye, Sakhalin, southern Kuriles, Khabarovsk and the Amur region), China, Japan (Hokkaido and Honshu) and the Korean Peninsula.|$|E

We hypothe-sized that such a change may be driven by differential predation favoring dissimilar anti-predator strategies in different life stages. We show with a series of laboratory assays that larvae are distasteful to birds regardless of their developmental stage, suggesting that ontogenetic color change is not driven by the differential chemical defense. Birds showed higher variance in hesitation to-ward conspicuous prey; some individuals hesitated long time before attacking whereas all birds attacked instantly masqueraded prey. We also found that the activity level of the larvae increased with age, which fits to the fact that larvae need to move from foliage to pupation sites. In the field by using artificial larvae resembling the two life-history stages we found predation risk to vary during the season: In early summer larger yellow-and-black larvae were attacked most, whereas later in the summer small ‘bird-dropping-larvae ’ suffered the highest predation. We conclude that the ontogenetic switch from masquerading to aposema-tism is adaptive most likely because actively moving prey cannot mimic immotile objects and thus, aposematism during the ac-tive and vulnerable period when larvae are searching for pupation sites becomes beneficial [Current Zoology 60 (1) : 114122, 2014]...|$|E
50|$|Acrobasis rubrifasciella, the <b>alder</b> tubemaker <b>moth,</b> is {{a species}} of snout moth in the genus Acrobasis. It was {{described}} by Alpheus Spring Packard in 1874, and is known from central-eastern Canada and eastern United States.|$|R
25|$|A {{large area}} of the southerly hill is {{protected}} as a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) for its biological importance; much of this hill {{is owned by the}} National Trust. Its summit plateau has an extensive area of lowland heath, a rare habitat in Cheshire, and one that is particularly important for reptiles. A substantial population of Lobed Maidenhair Spleenwort, a fern that is rare in Britain, is found here. Nationally scarce species observed in the area include the bleached pug and <b>alder</b> kitten <b>moths,</b> and the Malthus frontalis species of soldier beetle. The western escarpment of the northerly hill has also been designated an SSSI for its exposed Triassic sandstones.|$|R
