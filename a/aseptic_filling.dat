Arbitrary shapes of the paperboard are handled through an unstructured 3 D surface mesh. Stationary and transient edge wicking simulations are validated against experiments with excellent agreement.

The results as functions of saturation and porosity are stored in a database. The database is used as input for two-phase flow simulations on the paper macro-scale. The resulting fluid penetration is validated against pressurized edge wick measurements on paper lab sheets with very good agreement.

40|$|Sterility {{means the}} absence of all viable {{microorganisms}} including viruses. At present, a sterility assurance level (SAL) of 10 – 6 is generally accepted for pharmacopoeial sterilization procedures, i. e., a probability of not more than one viable microorganism in an amount of one million sterilised items of the final product. By extrapolating the reduction rates following extreme artificial initial contamination, a theoretical overall performance of the procedure of at least 12 lg increments (overkill conditions) is demanded to verify an SAL of 10 – 6. By comparison, other recommendations for thermal sterilization procedures demand only evidence {{that the difference between}} the initial contamination and the number of test organisms {{at the end of the}} process amount to more than six orders of magnitude. However, a practical proof of the required level of sterility assurance of 10 – 6 is not possible. Moreover, the attainability of this condition is fundamentally dubious, at least in non-thermal procedures. Thus, the question is discussed whether the undifferentiated adherence to the concept of sterility assurance on the basis of a single SAL of 10 – 6 corresponds with the safety requirements in terms of patient or user safety, costs and energy efficiency. Therefore, in terms of practical considerations, a concept of tiered SALs is recommended, analogous to the comparable and well-established categorization into “High-level disinfection”, “Intermediate-level disinfection” and “Low-level disinfection”. The determination of such tiered SALs is geared both to the intended application of the sterilized goods, as well as to the characteristics of the products and the corresponding treatment options. In the case of <b>aseptic</b> preparation, <b>filling</b> and production procedures, a mean contamination probability of 10 – 3 is assumed. In automated processes, lower contamination rates can be realized. In the case of the production of re-usable medical devices, a reduction of at least 2 lg increments can be achieved through prior cleaning in validated cleaning and disinfecting devices. By chemical disinfection, a further reduction of ≥ 5 lg increments is achieved. In the case of sterilized surgical instruments, an additional concern is that they lay opened in contaminated air for the duration of the operation, at least in conventionally ventilated operating theaters. Finally, the amount of pathogens necessary to cause an infection must be considered. By logical consideration of all aspects, it seems possible to partially reduce sterility assurance levels without any loss of safety. Proceeding from this, we would like to make the following suggestions for tiered SAL values, adjusted according to the respective sterilization task: * SAL 10 – 6 for heat-resistant pharmaceutical preparations (parenterals), suggested term: “Pharmaceutical sterilization”, * SAL 10 – 4 for heat-resistant medical devices, suggested term: “High-level sterilization”, * SAL 10 – 3 for heat-sensitive re-usable medical devices, under the precondition of a validated cleaning efficacy of > 4 lg increments, suggested term: “Low-level sterilization”...|$|R

40|$|One of the {{possible}} reasons for post-contamination of extended shelf life (ESL) milk could be attachment and formation of biofilms on stainless steel pipe surfaces. In South Africa, ESL milk processors are still facing challenges extending the shelf life beyond 14 days. It is hypothesized that post-contamination along the milk processing line is responsible of reducing the shelf life of ESL milk. This assumption was investigated by assessing the microorganisms associated with the nozzles of <b>aseptic</b> <b>filling</b> machines post CIP process and {{this study was designed}} and divided into two phases. Phase one involved isolation and characterisation of the bacteria associated with the nozzles of <b>aseptic</b> <b>filling</b> machines after CIP process with the aim of determining the diversity of microorganisms attached to the nozzles of <b>aseptic</b> <b>filling</b> machines. Swab samples were collected from a plant processing ESL milk. Twenty swabs were taken from ten different nozzles of <b>aseptic</b> <b>filling</b> machines during 4 visits (n= 80). The swab samples were plated on the day of sampling. A total bacterial count ranging from 1. 75 - 1. 95 log CFU/cm 3 with an average of 1. 81 log CFU/cm 3 (n= 80). MALDI-TOF revealed a high percentage of Gram-positive rods (69 %), followed by Gram-positive cocci (20 %) and then Gram-negative rods (7 %). The Gram-positive rods belonging to genus Bacillus were identified as Bacillus cereus, followed by B. pumilus, B. subtilis and Paenibacillus spp. The Gram-positive cocci included S. hominis, S. epidermidis, Micrococcus luteus and Anaerococcus spp. The Gram-negative rods were identified as Acinetobacter junii. The prevalence of Bacillus spp. noted in the nozzles of ESL <b>aseptic</b> <b>filling</b> machines is attributed to their ability to resist heat treatment during CIP process and their ability to attach to stainless steel surfaces. There was a degree of similarity in terms of MALDI-TOF MS profiles for the strains of B. cereus, Staphylococcus spp. and Paenibacillus spp. originating from the nozzles of <b>aseptic</b> <b>filling</b> machines and the packaged ESL milk product. Furthermore, these isolates show close relatedness. These bacteria are likely to originate from the nozzles, dispensed into the final ESL milk during filling process. Phase two aimed at determining cell surface hydrophobicity of the isolates originating from the nozzles of <b>aseptic</b> <b>filling</b> machines. Co-currently the study further determined the ability of B. cereus, S. epidermidis, M. luteus and Paenibacillus spp. to attach and form biofilms on stainless surfaces. The bacterial strains were isolated from the nozzles of <b>aseptic</b> <b>filling</b> machines. The degree of hydrophobicity of the spore formers ranged from 8 - 91 % while non-spore formers ranged from 6 - 67 %. Hydrophobicity of S. hominis, S. epidermidis, Acinetobacter junii and Arthrobacter castelli differed significantly (p? 0. 05). Hydrophobicity of B. pumilus, Paenibacillus spp. and B. cereus (p? 0. 05) differed significantly. Spore formers showed the highest hydrophobicity to solvents, this can be contributed to their hydrophobic nature and their ability to attach to stainless surfaces. A continuous flow reactor system was used to grow biofilm of the isolates in skim milk. The skim milk was inoculated with spore suspension of B. cereus, Paenibacillus spp. and bacterial suspension of M. luteus and S. epidermidis. The bacterial suspensions were run separately over a period of 20 h at 37 °C. Stainless steel strips were submitted to Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) after 22 h. The results suggested that spores of B. cereus and Paenibacillus spp. can only attach whilst M. luteus and S. epidermidis can attach and form biofilms on stainless steel. The ability of these isolates to form biofilms on stainless steel strips could be the main cause of contamination of ESL milk. Strains of Bacillus spp. can form biofilm on stainless steel and limit the shelf life of milk and milk products. However, toxins produced by some of these strains of B. cereus might be contagious to humans. The results confirmed {{that one of the reasons}} of contamination of ESL milk could be the ability of B. cereus to attach to stainless surfaces and M. luteus to form biofilms. Over and above the fact that the spores of B. cereus can lead to spoilage of milk and milk products, a concern is that the toxins produced by some of the strains of B. cereus are detrimental to human health.

Two different sensor layouts, namely a circular and a linear form, {{as well as two}} various material pairs such as tungsten/nickel and gold/nickel, have been examined for the realization of a thin-film thermopile. Additionally, manganese oxide and palladium particles have been compared as responsive catalysts towards H 2 O 2. The thin-film sensors have been investigated at various H 2 O 2 concentrations, gas temperatures and flow rates. (C) 2010 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinhei...|$|E
