5|$|During the Philippine–American War, Yorktown {{stood in}} to Baler Bay, {{on the west}} coast of Luzon, on 11 April 1899, on a mission to relieve a Spanish {{garrison}} that had been under siege by Filipino troops for nine months. Lt. James C. Gillmore and a party of sailors in the ship's whaleboat provided a decoy, ostensibly taking soundings of a nearby river. Meanwhile, Standley and an enlisted man landed farther up the coast to reconnoiter. The next day, Gillmore and his boat crew drifted into a trap, running aground too far from the river's mouth <b>and</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> of Yorktown. Filipino troops, hidden in the jungle-covered banks, raked the boat with rifle fire. Two American sailors were killed; two were mortally wounded; and the remainder, including Gillmore, were slightly wounded. The survivors were taken prisoner until freed by U.S. Army troops. Standley completed his mission and, together with the enlisted signalman, made it back to the ship.|$|E
5|$|Chambers and {{his second}} in command, Captain Charles Spragg, {{immediately}} set about constructing a defensive trench across the post, and strengthening its other defences. But by now the Turks, from the 72nd Infantry Regiment, about 1,000-strong, had managed to use the terrain and darkness to close in on the position. At 22:00 Chambers reported that the position was under attack and surrounded, and at 23:35 the telephone line to headquarters was cut by the Turks. The area in front of No.3 Post was in a gully <b>and</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> to the defenders, {{so they had to}} climb on the trench parapet to engage the Turks. This tactic worked well, and they broke up the Turkish assault, causing the attackers some casualties. The Turks did not withdraw far, and crept up {{to the edge of the}} New Zealanders' trench during the night. They then threw hand grenades into the New Zealanders' position. At the same time, small arms fire from the surrounding Turkish positions pinned the New Zealanders down.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps no American neo-noirs better {{reflect the}} classic noir A-movie-with-a-B-movie-soul {{than those of}} director-writer Quentin Tarantino; neo-noirs of his such as Reservoir Dogs (1992) and Pulp Fiction (1994) display a relentlessly self-reflexive, {{sometimes}} tongue-in-cheek sensibility, similar {{to the work of}} the New Wave directors and the Coens. Other films from the era readily identifiable as neo-noir (some retro, some more au courant) include director John Dahl's Kill Me Again (1989), Red Rock West (1992), The Last Seduction (1993), as well as Gus van Sant's To Die For (1995), and Andrew Davis's A Perfect Murder (1998); four adaptations of novels by Jim Thompson—The Kill-Off (1989), After Dark, My Sweet (1990), The Grifters (1990), and the remake of The Getaway (1994); and many more, including adaptations of the work of other major noir fiction writers: The Hot Spot (1990), from Hell Hath No Fury, by Charles Williams; Miami Blues (1990), from the novel by Charles Willeford; <b>and</b> <b>Out</b> <b>of</b> <b>Sight</b> (1998), from the novel by Elmore Leonard. Several films by director-writer David Mamet involve noir elements: House of Games (1987), Homicide (1991), The Spanish Prisoner (1997), and Heist (2001). On television, Remington Steele (1982–87) and Moonlighting (1985–89) paid homage to classic noir while demonstrating an unusual appreciation of the sense of humor often found in the original cycle. Between 1983 and 1989, Mickey Spillane's hardboiled private eye Mike Hammer was played with wry gusto by Stacy Keach in a series and several stand-alone television films (an unsuccessful revival followed in 1997–98). The British miniseries The Singing Detective (1986), written by Dennis Potter, {{tells the story of a}} mystery writer named Philip Marlow; widely considered one of the finest neo-noirs in any medium, some critics rank it among the greatest television productions of all time.|$|E

The police responded with tear-gas; when the stone-throwing continued, the assistant-mayor and two Arab Knesset members on the scene guaranteed a cessation {{in exchange for a}} police retreat, which they did. Arab youths also vandalized traffic signals at the Canyon Junction.|$|E
25|$|Alexander, {{destroying}} Porus' {{right flank}} circled around to Porus' left flank launching a mass attack against Porus's left flank.

Alexander foresaw this and placed his cavalry, under the command of Coenus, opposite of them <b>and</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>sight.</b> Their job was to break cover and follow the Indian cavalry, which forced the Indians to go forward, right into Craterus. Arrian states that 12,000 Indians and 80 elephants died in this mass pincer movement.|$|E
25|$|Another {{prominent}} {{controversy surrounding}} {{preparations for the}} World Cup is the N2 Gateway housing project in Cape Town, which plans to remove over 20,000 residents from the Joe Slovo Informal Settlement along the busy N2 Freeway and build rental flats and bond-houses in its place {{in time for the}} 2010 World Cup. The residents would be moved to the poverty stricken Delft township {{on the outskirts of the}} city <b>and</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> from the N2 Freeway. There has been particular concern about forced removals to the Blikkiesdorp camp in Delft and that in Durban, children are being forcibly removed from the city centre.|$|E

500|$|While on the {{campaign}} trail in 1964, Lyndon B. Johnson and Minnesota Senator Hubert H. Humphrey visited the park. [...] Johnson would go on to win the presidential election that year with Humphrey as his running mate. [...] Their visit is commemorated with a plaque which reads: President Lyndon B. Johnson, Senator Hubert H. Humphrey and Governor Karl Rolvaag enjoy the spray from Minnehaha Falls. [...] On that day, however, Minneapolis was experiencing a drought. [...] In order to create the beautiful spray of the falls pictured here the city had to open many fire hydrants upstream <b>and</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>sight,</b> to feed water to the creek." ...|$|E
500|$|Track signals {{were based}} on two designs—station signals on posts, each post with two {{moveable}} arms—and portable signals; flags were used by day, and coloured lanterns at night. [...] The signals on posts were patented semaphore designs from J Stevens & Son. [...] Each post had two arms—linked by chain to a foot control at the base—which were used to alert drivers on both {{the up and down}} lines. [...] Each foot control was held in place by a hook on the post. [...] An arm set at an angle would indicate that the train should approach slowly, before stopping at the station. [...] The same arm set vertically (<b>and</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>sight)</b> would indicate that the train could pass through without stopping. [...] The posts were also illuminated to allow use at night. [...] Signals at Accrington station were more complex, linked to the station building with wires, and by default set at 'stop' when released. [...] The coloured lanterns used as portable signals were painted red on one side (stop), green on another (go slowly), and clear on the third (proceed).|$|E
500|$|The {{figure is}} clearly {{identifiable}} as a pope from his clothing. It seems trapped and isolated within {{the outlines of}} an abstract three-dimensional glass cage. This framing device, described by Sylvester as a [...] "space-frame", was to feature heavily throughout the artist's career. A cord hangs from the upper edge of the glass case, falling {{just in front of}} the pope's face and partially covering his eyes. It is too indistinctly drawn to identify with certainty, but given the presence of similar objects in Bacon's later works, may be either the end of a hanging light switch or the tassel of a curtain; the hanging cord was to become a signature for the artist. Apart from its symbolic meaning, it has a compositional function, framing the painting with a further set of vertical lines. Such an object reappears most prominently in the centre panel of his 1973 Triptych, May–June 1973, where it is clearly a dangling light bulb. For Bacon, these elements were intended to make the figure waver in <b>and</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> for the viewer, alluding to the fact that bulbs can be on or off, curtains open or closed.|$|E

500|$|At 8:45 a.m. the Newfoundland Regiment and 1st Battalion of the Essex Regiment {{received}} {{orders to}} move forward. The Newfoundland Regiment was situated at St. John's Road, a support trench [...] behind the British forward line <b>and</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> of the enemy. Movement forward through the communication trenches {{was not possible}} because they were congested with dead and wounded men and under shell fire. Lieutenant Colonel Arthur Lovell Hadow, the battalion commander, decided to move immediately into attack formation and advance across the surface, which involved first navigating through the British barbed wire defences. As they breasted the skyline behind the British first line, they were effectively the only troops moving on the battlefield and clearly visible to the German defenders. Subjected to {{the full force of}} the 119th (Reserve) Infantry Regiment, most of the Newfoundland Regiment who had started forward were dead, dying or wounded within 15 to 20 minutes of leaving St. John's Road trench. Most reached no further than the Danger Tree, a skeleton of a tree that lay in No Man's Land that was being utilized as a landmark. So far as can be ascertained, 22 officers and 758 other ranks were directly involved in the advance. Of these, all the officers and slightly under 658 other ranks became casualties. Of the 780 men who went forward only about 110 survived unscathed, of whom only 68 were available for roll call the following day. For all intents and purposes the Newfoundland Regiment had been wiped out, the unit as a whole having suffered a casualty rate of approximately 80%. The only unit to suffer greater casualties during the attack was the 10th Battalion of the West Yorkshire Regiment, attacking west of Fricourt village.|$|E
2500|$|Before Rhames was cast, {{the part}} of Wallace was offered to Sid Haig, who had {{appeared}} in many 1970s exploitation films. Haig passed on the role.

2500|$|Just {{before the}} New Zealanders' attack began a strong German and Ottoman counterattack {{fell on the}} {{junction}} between the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade and the Imperial Camel Corps Brigade.
