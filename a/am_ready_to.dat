[...] Munongo fled Kolwezi and angrily declared that he would continue the campaign from Rhodesia, though he soon returned. Tshombe offered to return to Élisabethville to oversee the implementation of Thant's proposal for reunification if Prime Minister Adoula granted amnesty to himself and his government. At a press conference, Adoula accepted Tshombe's proposition and announced that what remained of the Katangese Gendarmerie would be integrated into the ANC.|$|E

Gangwar ended his fast after 14 days, saying, [...] "My fight to demand a strict law against rape will be {{continued}} in the future... I have dedicated myself for this cause".

500|$|Debate over Trescothick's {{place in}} the England squad {{continued}} amid an end-of-series reshuffle in the England batting lineup. This included the dropping of fellow opener Strauss from the one-day side, {{and the rise of}} Alastair Cook as a Test and ODI opener for England. Trescothick stated that he would see how he progresses before committing to the international scene: [...] "Of course I'd love to play for England again.... Clearly, if I want to continue my career I have to undertake another tour. But for now, if and when I get back to full fitness and I think I am OK and ready to play, I'll make myself available for England." [...] He added that he was [...] "desperate to play for England again" [...] but was waiting until he was [...] "as convinced as I can be that I <b>am</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> take on the challenge of international cricket".|$|E
500|$|Early in his career, West {{made clear}} his {{interest}} in fashion and desire {{to work in the}} clothing design industry. In September 2005, West announced that he would release his Pastelle Clothing line in spring 2006, claiming [...] "Now that I have a Grammy under my belt and Late Registration is finished, I <b>am</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> launch my clothing line next spring." [...] The line was developed over the following four years – with multiple pieces teased by West himself – before the line was ultimately cancelled in 2009. In 2009, West collaborated with Nike to release his own shoe, the Air Yeezys, with a second version released in 2012. In January 2009, West introduced his first shoe line designed for Louis Vuitton during Paris Fashion Week. The line was released in summer 2009. West has additionally designed shoewear for Bape and Italian shoemaker Giuseppe Zanotti. In fall 2009 West moved to Rome and did an internship at Italian fashion brand Fendi where he gave ideas for the men's collection. In March 2011, West collaborated with M/M Paris for a series of silk scarves featuring artwork from My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy.|$|E
500|$|The loss of Lochry's {{detachment}} {{proved to}} be the fatal setback to Clark's 1781 campaign. In early September, Clark held a series of councils with Kentucky militia officers at Fort Nelson. Clark still advocated carrying out an expedition into the Ohio Country, saying that [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> lead you on to any Action that has the most distant prospect of Advantage, however daring it may appear to be." [...] Given the lateness of the season and the shortage of available men, the council overruled Clark and decided instead to remain on the defensive, although they proposed that another campaign against Detroit should be carried out the next year. On October 1, 1781, a disappointed Clark wrote, [...] "My chain appears to have run out. I find myself enclosed with a few troops, in a trifling fort, and shortly expect to bear the insults of those who have for several years been in continual dread of me." [...] Clark led an expedition against the Shawnee towns on the Great Miami River in 1782, one of the last actions of the war, but he was never able to mount an expedition against Detroit.|$|E

500|$|The {{movement}} organizers {{found themselves}} out of money after the amount of required bail was raised. Because King was the major fundraiser, his associates urged him to travel the country to raise bail money for those arrested. He had, however, previously promised to lead the marchers to jail in solidarity, but hesitated as the planned date arrived. Some SCLC members grew frustrated with his indecisiveness. [...] "I have never seen Martin so troubled", one of King's friends later said. After King prayed and reflected alone in his hotel room, he and the campaign leaders decided to defy the injunction and prepared for mass arrests of campaign supporters. To build morale and to recruit volunteers to go to jail, Ralph Abernathy spoke at a mass meeting of Birmingham's black citizens at the 6th Avenue Baptist Church: [...] "The {{eyes of the world}} are on Birmingham tonight. Bobby Kennedy is looking here at Birmingham, the United States Congress is looking at Birmingham. The Department of Justice is looking at Birmingham. Are you ready, are you ready to make the challenge? I <b>am</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> go to jail, are you?" [...] With Abernathy, King was among 50 Birmingham residents ranging in age from 15 to 81 years who were arrested on Good Friday, April 12, 1963. It was King's 13th arrest.|$|E
500|$|When {{the case}} {{came to be}} heard in the King's Bench on 17 November, a huge crowd packed Westminster Hall {{to such an extent that}} counsel had great {{difficulty}} in entering. When Thornton was called upon for his plea, he responded, [...] "Not guilty; and I <b>am</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> defend the same with my body." [...] He then put on one of a pair of leather gauntlets, which Reader handed him. Thornton threw down the other for William Ashford to pick up and thus accept the challenge, which Ashford did not do. Instead, his counsel, Nathaniel Clarke, argued that Thornton should not be able to compound his murder of the sister with an attempt to murder the brother, to which the Lord Chief Justice, Lord Ellenborough responded, [...] "It is the law of England, Mr Clarke; we must not call it murder." [...] Clarke then argued Ashford's youth and lack of bodily strength as a reason not to allow the battle. Reader, in reply, stated that Ashford's counsel should not waste the Court's time by arguing that trial by battle was unwise because of Ashford's physical condition, but should file responsive pleadings and allow the case to move forward. Reader also noted that he and his co-counsel had advised Thornton to wage battle out of concern that with the [...] "extraordinary and unprecedented prejudice" [...] against the defendant, a fair jury could not be obtained. The matter was adjourned to 22 November to allow Ashford's counsel to file pleadings.|$|E
500|$|Cyrus {{was raised}} as a Christian and {{identified}} herself as such during her childhood and early adult life. Some recent quotes such as [...] "You are all stardust. You couldn’t {{be here if}} stars hadn’t exploded... So forget Jesus. Stars died so you can live", and social media content have led to questions surrounding her religious beliefs. Cyrus includes references to Tibetan Buddhism in the lyrics of [...] "Milky Milky Milk" [...] (2015). Cyrus came out as pansexual to her mother when she was 14, and has said: [...] "I never want to label myself! I <b>am</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> love anyone that loves me for who I am! I am open." [...] In June 2015, Time reported that she also identifies as gender fluid. She was quoted as stating she [...] " [...] relate to being boy or girl, and I don't have to have my partner relate to boy or girl." [...] Cyrus is {{a supporter of the}} LGBT community, and is often vocal about her beliefs on the topic. Her song [...] "My Heart Beats For Love" [...] (2010) was written for one of Cyrus' gay friends, while she has since claimed that London is her favorite place to perform due to its extensive gay scene. Cyrus also has an equals sign tattooed on her ring finger in support of same-sex marriage. She is the founder of the Happy Hippie Foundation, which works to [...] "fight injustice facing homeless youth, LGBTQ youth and other vulnerable populations". Cyrus is open about her recreational use of cannabis. She told Rolling Stone in 2013 that it was [...] "the best drug on earth" [...] and called it, along with MDMA, a [...] "happy drug". While accepting the Best Video award at the 2013 MTV Europe Music Awards, Cyrus smoked {{what appeared to be a}} joint on stage; this was removed from the delayed broadcast of the program in the United States. In a 2014 interview with W, Cyrus stated [...] "I love weed" [...] and [...] "I just love getting stoned." ...|$|E
