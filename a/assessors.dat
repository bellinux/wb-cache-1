5|$|Although most of {{the judging}} had been {{completed}} before the fire, suggestions {{at the time that}} the committee could use what they had learned from the entrants to propose a new competition with greater clarity as to the requirements led to naught: a 1925 letter to the then Premier John Gunn reveals that there was little to be learned from the competition, as the <b>assessors</b> had found that none of the designs were suitable.|$|E

40|$|Past {{research}} on performance appraisal focusing on <b>assessor’s</b> ability to assess accurately {{has not made}} much progress because practitioners have not adopted most of the recommendations. One of the arguments has been that enhancing <b>assessor’s</b> ability to is useless unless s/he intends to appraise accurately. The focus {{of this paper is}} to understand <b>assessor’s</b> intention to appraise performance and it draws from political view of organisation, which considers <b>assessor</b> as a politician and proposes that certain contextual factors cause <b>assessor’s</b> to adopt goals other than accuracy. Specifically, it is proposed that, instrumentality of outcomes, ambiguity in the process/ policies, and accountability pressures shape the <b>assessor’s</b> perception of appraisal politics, which determine <b>assessor’s</b> intention to achieve specific goals through appraisal. Accountability research reveals that only specific accountability conditions have favourable affect on decision. While procedural accountability reduces <b>assessor’s</b> perception of appraisal politics, the outcome accountability will increase this perception and affect appraisal accuracy. ...|$|R

5|$|The SPC is {{the highest}} court for appeal and review, and it reports to the National Assembly, which {{controls}} the judiciary's budget and confirms the president's nominees to the SPC and SPP. The SPP issues arrest warrants, sometimes retroactively. Below the SPC are district and provincial people's courts, military tribunals, and administrative, economic and labor courts. The people's courts are the courts of first instance. The Ministry of Defence (MOD) has military tribunals, which have the same rules as civil courts. Military judges and <b>assessors</b> are selected by the MOD and the SPC, but the SPC has supervisory responsibility. Although the constitution provides for independent judges and lay <b>assessors</b> (who lack administrative training), the United States Department of State maintains that Vietnam lacks an independent judiciary, {{in part because the}} Communist Party selects judges and vets them for political reliability. Moreover, the party seeks to influence the outcome of cases involving perceived threats to the state or the party's dominant position. In an effort to increase judicial independence, the government transferred local courts from the Ministry of Justice to the SPC in September 2002. However, the Department of State saw no evidence that the move actually achieved the stated goal. Vietnam's judiciary is also hampered by a shortage of lawyers and by rudimentary trial procedures. The death penalty often is imposed in cases of corruption and drug trafficking.|$|E
5|$|The Assembly was {{strictly}} {{under the control}} of Parliament, and was only to debate topics which Parliament directed.

Due to Twisse's ill health, Cornelius Burges, whom Parliament appointed as one of several <b>assessors,</b> served as prolocutor pro tempore for most of the Assembly. Twenty-two appointed members of the Assembly died before 1649, and they along with those who did not attend for other reasons were replaced by another nineteen members.
