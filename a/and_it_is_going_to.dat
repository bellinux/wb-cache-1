Eurogamer stated that Opposing Force still had similar problems to other expansion packs, commenting that [...] "χ amount of new content has been created <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be cut into the old content in a linear {{way to make it}} look like an all new game", but noted that [...] "fortunately though the new stuff in Opposing Force... is pretty damn good". Although praising the level design as the game's strongest point, the reviewer felt that [...] "towards the end of the game... they were running out of development time". Reviewing for IGN, Vincent Lopez stated that the game [...] "does a fantastic job of making you remember exactly why you enjoyed the original so much", but criticized this as the biggest drawback, commenting that [...] "you may find yourself wishing for a more original experience", but concluded that [...] "for good, and bad: it's good to be back".|$|E

60|$|But {{though he}} has been followed, he has great doubt as to his own course. To {{hesitate}} is to be lost, so he goes on, on rapidly, looking as he clears every fence for the spot at which he is to clear the next; but he {{is by no means}} certain of his course. Though he has admirers at his heels who credit him implicitly, his mind is racked by an agony of ignorance. He has got badly away, and the hounds are running well, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be a good thing; and he will not see it. He has not been in for anything good this year, and now this is his luck! His eye travels round over the horizon as he is gallopping, and though he sees men here and there, he can catch no sign of a hound; nor can he catch the form of any man who would probably be with them. But he perseveres, choosing his points as he goes, till the tail of his followers becomes thinner and thinner. He comes out upon a road, and makes the pace as good as he can along the soft edge of it. He sniffs at the wind, knowing that the fox, going at such a pace as this, must run with it. He tells himself from outward signs where he is, and uses his dead knowledge to direct him. He scorns to ask a question as he passes countrymen in his course, but he would give five guineas to know exactly where the hounds are at that moment. He has been at it now forty minutes, and is in despair. His gallant nag rolls a little under him, and he knows that he has been going too fast. And for what; for what? What good has it all done him? What good will it do him, though he should kill the beast? He curses between his teeth, and everything is vanity and vexation of spirit.|$|E
