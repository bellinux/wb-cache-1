40|$|Application of {{slightly}} modified off-the-shelf <b>automatic</b> <b>celestial</b> <b>navigation</b> systems ('star trackers') is {{considered for the}} purposes of monitoring variations in the optical depth of the stratospheric aerosol and ozone layers. The basic principle of the technique is to observe stars from an orbiting station as they are occulted by the stratospheric aerosol layer. Since molecular and refraction extinction are directly calculable, total extinction measurements using a dual-sensor (S 4 and S 20) approach allows us to directly solve for ozone and aerosol extinction and look for correlations between these two parameters. The technique appears promising for remotely monitoring aerosol and ozone optical depth in the 15 - 25 km region over selected locations and is independently accurate if aerosol composition and relative size distribution are invariant...|$|E

For <b>celestial</b> <b>navigation</b> the Portuguese, like other Europeans, used Arab navigation tools, like the astrolabe and quadrant, which they made easier and simpler.

50|$|While <b>celestial</b> <b>navigation</b> is {{becoming}} increasingly redundant {{with the advent of}} inexpensive and highly accurate satellite navigation receivers (GPS), it was used extensively in aviation until the 1960s, and marine navigation until quite recently.

One of the most common current usages of <b>celestial</b> <b>navigation</b> aboard large merchant vessels is for compass calibration and error checking at sea when no terrestrial references are available.|$|R

40|$|A {{practical}} and reliable capability for autonomous navigation needs to reduce operation cost, to improve operational efficiency, {{and to increase}} mission safety. <b>Celestial</b> <b>navigation</b> is a very attractive autonomous navigation solution for deep space spacecraft. There are mainly two kinds of <b>celestial</b> <b>navigation</b> methods: the direct calculation method and the filter method. The accuracy of the direct calculation method is low and very sensitive to the measurement noise. The filter method can provide a better navigation performance if a high accuracy dynamical model is available. However, the main practical problem existing in the autonomous <b>celestial</b> <b>navigation</b> of spacecraft on a gravity assist trajectory is that the accuracy of trajectory model {{is not enough to}} be used in the real navigation sometimes, which may introduce large estimation error and even cause filter divergence. To solve this problem, a new <b>celestial</b> <b>navigation</b> method is proposed in this paper, which effectively combines the direct calculation method and the filter method using an interacting multiple model unscented Kalman filter (IMMUKF). The ground experimental results demonstrate that this method can provide better navigation performance and higher reliability than the traditional direct calculation method and filter method...|$|R
