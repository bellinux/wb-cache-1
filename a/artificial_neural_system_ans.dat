NEURAL {{has been designed}} taking into ac- count the learning and self-organizing abilities of the brain.

Basically, the most significant characteristic of NEURAL is the uniform distribution of the information around the node‟s location based on the current changes in its neighborhood.

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{properties}} of a software package called HNeT (Holographic/Quantum Neural Technology) {{which is based on}} the use of an artificial intelligence tool called Neural Networks. The basis for the investigation of this software is to establish its reliability, effectiveness and efficiency. Neural technology is a technological replication of the biological neural system designed to learn data patterns and process the data (stimulus) and then generate a response based on the memory of the data. HNeT theory is fundamentally different from the standard <b>Artificial</b> <b>Neural</b> <b>System</b> (<b>ANS)</b> in that it uses complex scalars to evaluate internal mappings of one set of values (stimuli) to another set of values (responses). HNeT employs a process known as enfolding, which allows the learning and subsequent recall of many stimulus-response associations to be compressed into a single HNeT neuron cell improving the speed of learning and recall accuracy as well as reducing storage requirements. Whereas the traditional ANS stores stimulus patterns separately as a reference template within a cell and are compared one at a time to a new incoming stimulus response pattern which in this case, requires larger amounts of memory.

40|$|Abstract—Synapses are {{essential}} elements for computation and information storage in both real and <b>artificial</b> <b>neural</b> <b>systems.</b> <b>An</b> <b>artificial</b> synapse needs to remember its past dynamical history, store a continuous set of states, and be ”plastic ” {{according to the}} pre-synaptic and post-synaptic neuronal activity. Here we show that all {{this can be accomplished}} by a memory-resistor (memristor for short). In particular, by using simple and inexpensive offthe-shelf components we have built a memristor emulator which realizes all required synaptic properties. Most importantly, we have demonstrated experimentally the formation of associative memory in a simple neural network consisting of three electronic neurons connected by two memristor-emulator synapses. This experimental demonstration opens up new possibilities in the understanding of neural processes using memory devices, an important step forward to reproduce complex learning, adaptive and spontaneous behavior with electronic neural networks.

In {{order to}} allow more {{flexible}} and general learning, it is an advantage for artificial systems {{to be able to}} discover re-usable features that capture structure in the environment, known as Deep Learning.

The detection of hidden {{messages in}} image data stored on websites and computers, called steganalysis, is of prime importance to cyber forensics personnel. Automating the detection of hidden messages is a requirement, since the shear amount of image data stored on computers or websites {{makes it impossible for}} a person to investigate each image separately.

40|$|Abstract. Biological neural {{networks}} having been shaped in {{billions of years}} of evolution {{are the source of}} numerous, complex capabilities of living organisms. Especially, the form of intelligence attributed to humans has inspired computer scientists to model the evolution of {{neural networks}} with the ultimate goal to create computer systems with cognitive abilities. However, considering the cur-rent state of research in the domain of artificial neural network (ANN) evolution there is still a huge gap between the extremely versatile brains of higher organisms, and the very specialized artificial neural systems mostly applied to a single, well–defined task. The majority of work on ANN evolution is concerned with the optimization of network structure and/or network weights so as to achieve maximal network performance for a specific problem. We present a taxonomy in order to categorize the (co) evolution of various components of an <b>artificial</b> <b>neural</b> <b>system</b> (<b>ANS).</b> We illustrate some of the approaches in ANS evolution by a few examples from the literature, and present our extensions to evolution of the ANN learning component by means of experiments with the two spirals benchmark problem utilizing the netGEN system.

40|$|Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) {{techniques}} afford Local Area Networks (LANs) {{the support}} of concurrent, asynchronous communication between users without access delay. These properties are obtained by encoding users' data with high rate code sequences, so that data is spread over a much larger bandwidth than would usually be required for transmission. The necessary bandwidth is provided by using optical fibre both as the LAN medium and for incoherent optical signal processing. Conventionally, extraction of a desired user's signal is achieved by correlation using a single delay-line matched filter. Matched filters are optimal for the recovery of a known signal {{in the presence of}} additive noise. However, in a CDMA environment, their performance is limited by Multiple Access Interference (MAI), arising from the cross-correlation products of overlaid users, and degrades as the number of users increases. Adaptive Logic Networks (ALNs), a form of <b>Artificial</b> <b>Neural</b> <b>System</b> (<b>ANS),</b> are applied to the extraction of a single user's signal in a multi-user environment. In the approach taken, ALNs learn to incorporate the presence of interfering users' signals, in deciding the actual data bit received. Computer simulation is used to compare the error rates obtained by ALNs and the previously proposed correlation receivers; the performance of the latter providing a benchmark. Simulations are conducted assuming chip synchronism between users and no external sources of noise, i. e. MAI is assumed dominant. Consideration is given to systems employing both sparse optical codes and Gold-like codes as spreading sequences. In all the systems considered, ALNs are shown to enable significant reductions in error rate over the conventional correlation receivers. MAI effects, causing errors with the correlation receivers, are reduced by using additional temporal and intensity based information contained in the receiver input signal. This permits an ALN to extract details of the structure of interfering users' signals, to provide a better context for the classification of the desired user's signal. In the systems employing sparse codes, it is demonstrated that while a certain amount of MAI persists, it may be minimised by selection of the ALN input window, to provide the maximum possible information regarding the interfering users' signals. In the systems using Gold-like codes, it is shown that ALNs can be used to completely eliminate the effects of MAI. This is significant since, although this form of code sequence is suited to coherent CDMA systems, the cross-correlation products arising in incoherent optical environments are normally considered to be unacceptably high...|$|E

50|$|Simulations by Stephen Thaler of limbo-thalamo-cortical loops {{engaged in}} invention, discovery, and artistic endeavors reveal a {{critical}} link between various psychopathologies and creativity. These contemplative <b>artificial</b> <b>neural</b> <b>systems</b> exploit the computational equivalent of volume-released neurotransmitters, namely random, hopping disturbances applied to connection weights {{in a process}} tantamount to neuromodulation, the diffusive molecular infiltration of the brain's synapses. These disturbances seed {{the formation of the}} novel neural activation patterns necessary for creativity. Close observation of such <b>artificial</b> <b>neural</b> <b>systems</b> as they engage in creative problem solving tasks reveals a cyclic or ‘tidal’ variation in synaptic chaos. At higher disturbance levels, ideas form as the memories and confabulations absorbed within multiple neural modules weakly couple into transient, subliminal notions that go unnoticed by critic neural modules incapacitated by the synaptic chaos. As disturbance levels subside, certain neural modules may lucidly perceive novelty, utility, or value to these oftentimes half-baked notions that then perfect themselves, consolidating into full-blown ideas coupled with accompanying affective responses. Extending these computational findings to human cognition, creativity cannot be attributed to any given brain state or mood. Instead, it is a hysteretic effect brought about by multiple transits through chaotic and quiescent phases. The more intense these swings, the more novel the creative product, but at the expense of increasingly severe cognitive pathologies, including hallucinations, confusion, inattention to the external environment, and inability to differentiate imagination from reality. In addition to providing a transparent <b>artificial</b> <b>neural</b> <b>system</b> by which to study creative cognition, such brain simulations provide evaluation metrics for originality and utility that are quantitative rather than subjective.|$|R
40|$|This thesis investigates novel robust {{hardware}} {{elements for}} weightless <b>artificial</b> <b>neural</b> <b>systems</b> with a bias towards high integrity avionics applications. The author initially reviews {{the building blocks}} of physiological <b>neural</b> <b>systems</b> and then chronologically describes the development of weightless <b>artificial</b> <b>neural</b> <b>systems.</b> Several new design methodologies for the implementation of robust binary sum-and-threshold neurons are presented. The new techniques do not rely on weighted binary counters or registered arithmetic units for their operation making them less susceptible to transient single event upsets. They employ Boolean, weightless binary, asynchronous elements throughout thus increasing robustness in the presence of impulsive noise. Hierarchies formed from these neural elements are studied and a weightless probabilisitic activation function proposed for non-deterministic applications. Neuroram, an auto-associative memory created using these weightless neurons is described and analysed. The signal-to-noise ratio characteristics are compared with the traditional Hamming distance metric. This led to the proposal that neuroram can form a threshold logic based digital signal filter. Two weightless autoassociative memory based neuro-filters are presented and their filtration properties studied and compared with a traditional median filter. Eachn novel architecture was emulated using weightless numericM ATLAB code prior to schematic design and functional simulation. Several neural elements were implemented and validated using FPGA technology. A preliminary robustness evaluation was performed.
