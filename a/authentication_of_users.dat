50|$|Data access {{services}} work {{hand in hand}} with the data transfer service to provide security, access controls and management of any data transfers within the data grid. Security services provide mechanisms for <b>authentication</b> <b>of</b> <b>users</b> to ensure they are properly identified. Common forms of security for authentication can include the use of passwords or Kerberos (protocol). Authorization services are the mechanisms that control what the user is able to access after being identified through authentication. Common forms of authorization mechanisms can be as simple as file permissions. However, need for more stringent controlled access to data is done using Access Control Lists (ACLs), Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and Tasked-Based Authorization Controls (TBAC). These types of controls can be used to provide granular access to files to include limits on access times, duration of access to granular controls that determine which files can be read or written to. The final data access service that might be present to protect the confidentiality of the data transport is encryption. The most common form of encryption for this task has been the use of SSL while in transport. While all of these {{access services}} operate within the data grid, access services within the various administrative domains that host the datasets will still stay in place to enforce access rules. The data grid access services must be in step with the administrative domains access services for this to work.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Today sending spams {{has turned}} {{to be a major}} problem in the Internet. It is so serious that more than 80 % of the {{transferred}} emails are spams. As a result, various methods have been proposed for preventing spams. One of these methods in this field is CAPTCHA (Completely Automatic Public Turing Test to tell Computer and Humans Apart) method. They have been developed to prevent automatically made accounts in sites which offer free email accounts. In this paper a new protocol is presented for <b>authentication</b> <b>of</b> <b>users</b> which enable us to confirm that a user is a human using CAPTCHA method. By using this protocol for <b>authentication</b> <b>of</b> <b>users,</b> we can design secure mail servers in order to prevent zombie computers sending spams by our server. This protocol has been designed according to CRAM-MD 5 protocol and has been implemented under the SASL (Simple Authentication and Security Layer). This protocol can be implemented easily and enjoys high flexibility and versatility...|$|E
