5|$|Middleton {{stayed at}} LSU until 1942, {{describing}} {{his days as}} the comptroller of LSU as long days {{that he would not}} want to relive, but <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>year</b> he found both the work and his association with Hebert, Borth and Hornbeak to be satisfying and rewarding. He felt that during this period of time, from 1939 to 1941, he was able to make his greatest contribution to an institution that had been very good to him in the past.|$|E
5|$|The {{sales tax}} rate, {{as defined in}} the {{legislation}} for the first year, is 23% of the total payment including the tax ($23 of every $100 spent in total—calculated similar to income taxes). This would be equivalent to a 30% traditional U.S. sales tax ($23 on top of every $77 spent—$100 total, or $30 on top of every $100 spent—$130 total). <b>After</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>year</b> of implementation, this rate is automatically adjusted annually using a predefined formula reflecting actual federal receipts in the previous fiscal year.|$|E
5|$|One of Stanley Marcus's first jobs {{was as a}} 10-year-old {{salesman}} of Saturday Evening Post, {{bringing him}} into the family's business tradition from a young age. He attended Forest Avenue High School, where he studied debate as well as English with teacher Myra Brown, whom he later credited with much of his early interest in books. He began his university studies at Amherst College, but when traditions preventing Jews from joining clubs or fraternities drastically curtailed his social life, he transferred to Harvard University <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>year.</b> At his new school, he {{became a member of}} the historically Jewish fraternity Zeta Beta Tau, later rising to become the group's president.|$|E

5|$|The {{governor}} has a four-year term, commencing {{on the first}} Monday of the January after an election. The Constitution of Utah originally stated that, should the office of governor be vacant, the power be devolved upon the Secretary of State, but the office of Lieutenant Governor was created in 1976, and a 1980 constitutional amendment added it to the constitution. If the office of governor becomes vacant {{during the first year}} of the term, the lieutenant governor becomes governor until the next general election; if it becomes vacant <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>year</b> of the term, the lieutenant governor becomes governor for the remainder of the term. The offices of governor and lieutenant governor are elected on the same ticket. The Governor of Utah was formerly limited to serving three terms, but all term limit laws were repealed by the Utah Legislature in 2003; Utah is one of the few states where gubernatorial term limits are not determined by the constitution.|$|E
5|$|<b>After</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>year</b> of development, Gas Powered Games {{found that}} {{they were not going to}} be able to finish the game within the planned two years; not only was the {{seamless}} world without loading screens harder to create than they had thought, but, according to lead developer Bartosz Kijanka, they had been overambitious in choosing how many innovative features they could put into the game's custom engine, such as the wide range through which the virtual camera system could zoom in and out. Other features supported and later dropped included allowing up to ten characters at once—and therefore maintaining up to ten areas of the single-player world—instead of the final maximum of eight, and a weather system that included wind blowing projectiles off course. According to Kijanka, the developers also spent a lot of time changing technologies mid-development, such as building a custom animation editor before moving to a licensed one, and starting with the OpenGL graphics library only to switch to Direct3D. As a result, the team was required to work 12–14 hour days and weekends for most of the development time in order to complete the game within four years. In a 2011 interview, Taylor stated that in retrospect the final cost in development time of the seamless world may have been too high, and also that the team tried to make too large of a game for their budget; he believed that a game with closer to 35 hours of playtime instead of 70 would have been a better and more polished experience given their constraints.|$|E

50|$|In 1863, Saratoga Race Course opened, {{moving to}} its current {{location}} the following year.

In addition, the Saratoga Springs area was known for its gambling, which <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>years</b> of <b>the</b> 20th century was illegal, but still widespread.

50|$|Even {{though the}} persecutions {{provided}} {{the impetus for}} mass emigration, there were other relevant factors that can account for <b>the</b> Jews' migration. <b>After</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>years</b> of large emigration from Russia, positive feedback from the emigrants in the U.S. encouraged further emigration. Indeed, {{more than two million}} Jews fled Russia between 1880 and 1920. While a large majority emigrated to the United States, some turned to Zionism. In 1882, members of Bilu and Hovevei Zion made what came to be known <b>the</b> <b>First</b> Aliyah to Palestine, then a part of the Ottoman Empire.|$|R

Nevertheless, economic conditions worsened; psychological adjustment to ghettoization was difficult; the winter of 1943 was severe and hunger was widespread.|$|E
