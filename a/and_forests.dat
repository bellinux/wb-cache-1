5|$|After the {{intersection}} with U.S. Route6, the surroundings around the highway become {{a mix of}} homes <b>and</b> <b>forests.</b> This lasts {{for much of the}} distance on Route434 until Greeley, where it becomes urbanized again. In downtown Greeley, Route434 splits at an intersection where Pennsylvania Route 590 begins. The highway makes a curve, turning to the southeast for a distance north of Greeley. Soon afterwards, Route434 parallels Shohola Creek, heading northeastward. Route434 begins to become urbanized for a third time, passing some large buildings along with homes <b>and</b> <b>forests.</b> The creek continues to parallel, with the highway turning in several different directions. The forests begin to recede as Route434 enters Shohola Township. Twin Lakes Road, a quadrant route, terminates at Route434 before crossing the Delaware River and becoming New York State Route 55 and Sullivan County Route 11 at the border.|$|E

40|$|Using {{six years}} of remote sensing data, we {{estimated}} land <b>and</b> <b>forest</b> degradation inside 1788 protected areas across 19 countries in Latin America. From 2004 – 2009, the rate of land <b>and</b> <b>forest</b> degradation increased by 250 % inside the protected areas, and the land <b>and</b> <b>forest</b> degradation totaled 1, 097, 618 hectares. Of the protected areas in our dataset, 45 % had land <b>and</b> <b>forest</b> degradation. There were relatively large variations by major habitat type, with flooded grasslands/savannas <b>and</b> moist broadleaf <b>forest</b> protected areas having {{the highest rates of}} degradation. We found no association between a country’s rate of land <b>and</b> <b>forest</b> degradation inside protected areas and Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita, GDP growth, or rural population density. We found significant, but weak, associations between the rate of land <b>and</b> <b>forest</b> degradation inside protected areas and a country’s protected area system funding, the size of the protected area, and one International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) management category. Our results suggest a high degree of heterogeneity in the variables impacting land <b>and</b> <b>forest</b> degradation inside protected areas in Latin America, but that the targeting of protected area investments on a continental scale is plausible...|$|R

To find out about this a survey was performed. The survey was done using the internet and a questionnaire was send out to 180 persons and 127 persons responded.
