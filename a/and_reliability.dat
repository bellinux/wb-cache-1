5|$|A major {{stimulus}} {{to improving the}} accuracy <b>and</b> <b>reliability</b> of clocks was the importance of precise time-keeping for navigation. The position of a ship at sea could be determined with reasonable accuracy if a navigator could refer to a clock that lost or gained less than about 10 seconds per day. The marine chronometer would {{have to keep the}} time of a fixed location—usually Greenwich Mean Time—allowing seafarers to determine longitude by comparing the local high noon to the clock. This clock could not contain a pendulum, which would be virtually useless on a rocking ship.|$|E
5|$|In 1915, {{the first}} {{proposal}} was launched {{for using a}} bus service {{as an alternative to}} the train.

Among the strongest opponents to the bus alternative was Ingolf Elster Christensen, County Governor of Sogn og Fjordane and later parliamentarian, who stated that the Nordre Bergenhus County (today Sogn og Fjordane County Municipality) had paid part of the regional financing of the Bergen Line on condition that they receive a branch line to the Sognefjord.|$|E

5|$|Richard Bowers' master's thesis (2012), updated to book form by Bowers and Moffett (2012), {{asserts that}} NVC has been absent from {{academic}} programs {{due to a}} lack of research into the theoretical basis for the model and lack of research on the reliability of positive results. Bowers' thesis meets the first objection through an analysis of existing theories which provide solid support for each element of the NVC (mediation) model. Without this theoretical understanding, it would not be clear what aspects of the NVC model make it work or even if it can be effectively applied by anyone other than Marshall Rosenberg. This theoretical analysis can provide a foundation for further empirical research on the effectiveness <b>and</b> <b>reliability</b> of the model.|$|E

5|$|The {{first major}} version to {{incorporate}} changes brought about through experience in operational service was the XX, {{which was designed}} to run on 100 octane fuel. This fuel allowed higher manifold pressures, which were achieved by increasing the boost from the centrifugal supercharger. The Merlin XX also utilised the two-speed superchargers designed by Rolls-Royce, resulting in increased power at higher altitudes than previous versions. Another improvement, introduced with the Merlin X, was the use of a 70%–30% water-glycol coolant mix rather than the 100% glycol of the earlier versions. This substantially improved engine life <b>and</b> <b>reliability,</b> removed the fire hazard of the flammable ethylene glycol, and reduced the oil leaks that had been a problem with the early Merlin I, II and III series.|$|E

In late 2015, EVA Air redesigned their livery and tail logo, using the dark green color on the belly, and cancelled the orange line {{on the edge of the}} tail to highlight the corporate identity. It's the third generation livery of EVA Air, symbolizing their ambition to connect Taiwan to the world.|$|E
