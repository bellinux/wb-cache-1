25|$|PCR greatly amplifies {{the amounts}} of a {{specific}} region of DNA. In the PCR process, the DNA sample is denatured into the separate individual polynucleotide strands through heating. Two oligonucleotide DNA primers are used to hybridize to two corresponding nearby sites on opposite DNA strands in such a fashion that the normal enzymatic extension of the <b>active</b> <b>terminal</b> of each primer (that is, the 3’ end) leads toward the other primer. PCR uses replication enzymes that are tolerant of high temperatures, such as the thermostable Taq polymerase. In this fashion, two new copies of the sequence of interest are generated. Repeated denaturation, hybridization, and extension in this fashion produce an exponentially growing number of copies of the DNA of interest. Instruments that perform thermal cycling are readily available from commercial sources. This process can produce a million-fold or greater amplification of the desired region in 2 hours or less.|$|E

Signals from the SDU are relayed by a satellite, which simply changes the signal's frequency, and then received by a ground station, which processes the signal and, if applicable, routes it to its destination (e.g., Malaysia Airlines' operations centre); signals to the aircraft are sent in reverse order. When the SDU is powered on and attempts to connect with the Inmarsat network, it transmits a log-on request, which the ground station acknowledges.

50|$|The Hutchinson {{river is}} navigable for its final three miles. Tugs and barges and the {{occasional}} small tanker still {{make their way to}} the terminals that are still operating. The northernmost <b>active</b> <b>terminal,</b> Sprague Energy located at 100 Canal Rd. in Mount Vernon, still accepts barges of heating oil, ULSD, and biodiesel blends daily.

The river is suffering from neglect, and although it was dredged in 2010, the northernmost section was not and is filling in with silt. Only shallow draft barges can reach Sprague at high water. The northernmost dock in the dredged project, Imperia Brothers Inc., has not been able to accept a scow of aggregates since 2007 due to the silt.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—We {{analyze the}} optimum {{transmitter}} power levels and the optimum number of <b>active</b> <b>terminals</b> sending data to a CDMA base station. The {{objective is to}} maximize the aggregate throughput of the base station. We find that {{in the presence of}} additive noise, received power balancing is suboptimal mathematically. We consider N terminals transmitting at the same data rate, with the power of the most distant terminal (terminal N), fixed at its maximum value, {{and the power of the}} other N- 1 terminals varying. We conclude that the aggregate throughput at the base station is maximized when the receiver powers for the N- 1 terminals are equal and larger than the receiver power of the N-th terminal. This finding reduces the complexity of the analysis to a univariate optimization problem. A numerical analysis indicates the extent to which additive noise reduces the optimum number of <b>active</b> <b>terminals</b> and the maximum base station throughput.

5000|$|Neurons in the CNS are {{organized}} as interconnected groups of functionally related cells (e.g., in sensory systems).

50|$|Likely {{the most}} {{important}} technological advance made during the General War in the west was the fast drone. Early drones could only make speeds 8 or 12, and target starships could easily evade them while still threatening the ships that launched them. These slow drones made the Anchor tactic an mandatory for the Kzintis and Gorns, who relied on their seeking weapons {{for most of their}} firepower. Just before the war's start, the speed-20 (type M or medium speed) drones appeared. These could still be evaded but were difficult to avoid while attacking the launcher starship. In Y180 the fastest type F or speed-32 drones began appearing in the war, and these proved devastatingly effective, though expensive. Many other drone improvements became available to the drone-using races: multi-warhead drones, spearfish and swordfish drones with specialized warheads, <b>Active</b> <b>Terminal</b> Guidance (freeing drone control channels on the launcher starship), and armored drones which were more difficult to intercept. The Electronic Warfare Drone revolutionized starship fighting tactics because it made its parent ship more difficult to hit. Finally, the long-range bombardment drone, with its specialized carrier starship, won many battles for their users throughout the war. They became ever-more-powerful with the ongoing development of superior drone ammunition.|$|E

40|$|A {{principle}} that regulates detailed architecture {{in the brain}} is that <b>active</b> <b>terminals</b> have a competitive advantage over less <b>active</b> <b>terminals</b> in establishing synaptic connections. This principle is known to apply to fibers within a single neuronal population competing for a common target domain. Here we uncover an additional rule that applies when two neuronal populations compete for two contiguous territories. The cerebellar Purkinje cell dendrites have two different synaptic domains with spines innervated by two separate excitatory inputs, parallel fibers (PFs) and climbing fibers (CFs). Glutamate δ- 2 receptors are normally present only on the PF spines where they are important for their innervation. After block of activity by tetrodotoxin, numerous new spines form in the CF domain and become innervated mainly by PFs; all spines, including those still innervated by the CFs, bear δ- 2 receptors. Thus, {{in the absence of}} activity, PFs gain a competitive advantage over CFs. The entire dendritic arbor becomes a uniform territory with the molecular cues associated with the PFs. To access their proper territory and maintain synaptic contacts, CFs must be active and locally repress the cues of the competitor afferents...|$|R
