50|$|<b>Aeromagnetic</b> <b>surveys</b> were {{performed}} in World War II to detect submarines using a Magnetic Anomaly Detector attached to an aircraft. <b>Aeromagnetic</b> <b>surveys</b> {{are also used}} to perform reconnaissance mapping of unexploded ordnance (UXO).

30|$|We {{needed an}} {{observation}} method in which <b>aeromagnetic</b> <b>surveys</b> could {{be conducted in}} the summit area without risk to human lives. For this purpose, we used an aeromag-netic survey system based on an unmanned autonomous helicopter. By using this system, {{we were able to}} conduct <b>aeromagnetic</b> <b>surveys</b> above the summit crater in late May 2011, and late October through early November, 2011, in order to investigate the magnetization of Shinmoe-dake, and the surrounding area, and changes associated with the 2011 eruption.|$|R

5000|$|The deposit is in Paleoproterozoic to Mesoproterozoic (2500 - 1000 mya) metamorphosed {{sedimentary}} rocks, {{known as}} the [...] "Soldier's Cap Group", and is overlain by approximately 60 m of Cretaceous and more recent overburden. The deposit was discovered as result of an <b>aeromagnetic</b> <b>survey</b> of the Soldiers Cap Group in the eastern Mount Isa inlier. The area was selected for survey based upon extrapolations from known prospects and associated lithostratigraphy. In other words, the rocks {{were the same as}} other known prospects, only slightly more deeply buried.

40|$|Steel, was {{credited}} {{with the discovery of}} additional iron ore at the company’s historic Cornwall mines near Lebanon, Pa., by means of ground magnetic surveys. Then, in 1948, the company’s Geology Department contracted with Aero Service Corporation in Philadelphia to make <b>aeromagnetic</b> <b>surveys</b> of the major lower Mesozoic basins in Pennsylvania, because these were known hosts for several important Cornwall-type iron deposits. Technical equipment for airborne magnetometer surveys had been developed by Gulf Research and Development Company, just before World War II, and improvements were made during the war through research for the U. S. Navy, which was interested in antisubmarine detection. An Aero Service geophysicist, William Agocs, was assigned to Bethlehem Steel to help evaluate the numerous magnetic anomalies shown on the new aeromagnetic maps. Two of the most promising anomalies were near Morgantown, Berks County, and at Pine Swamp, near Warwick, Chester County. An aeromagnetic map of the Morgantown anomaly is shown in Figure 1. The map is a one of the products of <b>aeromagnetic</b> <b>surveys</b> flown in 1957 by the U. S. Geological Survey in cooperation with the Pennsylvania Geological Survey, nine years after the initial surveys for Bethlehem Steel. <b>Aeromagnetic</b> <b>surveys</b> were a tremendous advance over the traditional ground magnetic surveys. They could cover large areas quickly and at modest cost, with no need for permission from landowners. They could also cover very rough terrain without difficulty. The <b>aeromagnetic</b> <b>surveys</b> not only were important for discovering buried mineral deposits but also were helpful in mapping subsurface geology and structure, thereby becoming a standard and useful too...|$|R

The compilation shows that all the study area is covered by <b>aeromagnetic</b> <b>surveys,</b> but in some areas, particularly in the Death Valley region, new surveys flown with closer flight line spacing and lower elevations than the existing coverage are needed. In addition, the California {{part of the study}} area needs to be analytically continued downward to 305 meters (m) above ground level to provide a consistent data set for interpretation of subsurface geologic structures...|$|R

50|$|For <b>aeromagnetic</b> <b>survey</b> {{applications}} {{the magnetic}} sensor can be mounted on an aircraft (typically {{on a long}} probe in front of or behind the aircraft to reduce the magnetic effects of the aircraft itself) or in a towed device. A chart is produced that geologists and geophysicists can study to determine the distribution and concentration of magnetic minerals which are related to geology and mineral deposits..|$|E
50|$|A {{magnetic}} anomaly detector (MAD) is an instrument used to detect minute variations in the Earth's magnetic field. The term refers specifically to magnetometers used by military forces to detect submarines (a mass of ferromagnetic material creates a detectable disturbance in the magnetic field); military MAD equipment is a descendent of geomagnetic survey or <b>aeromagnetic</b> <b>survey</b> instruments used to search for minerals by detecting their disturbance of the normal earth-field.|$|E
50|$|In {{shipborne}} surveys, a magnetometer is towed a {{few hundred}} meters behind a ship in a device called a fish. The sensor is kept at a constant depth of about 15 m. Otherwise, the procedure {{is similar to that}} used in <b>aeromagnetic</b> <b>surveys.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Optically pumped magnetometers, {{which use}} alkali gases (most {{commonly}} rubidium and cesium) have high sample rates and sensitivities of 0.001 nT or less, but {{are more expensive}} than the other types of magnetometers.

40|$|Basin-and-range {{geothermal}} {{resources are}} typically fault-controlled, deep-circulation systems. They commonly occur beneath thick sequences of Tertiary and Quaternary basin-fill sediments which hinder understanding of fault geometries and faulting patterns. Recent experience at Dixie Valley and {{survey of the}} literature for other systems suggest a low-cost and rapid exploration strategy for establishing basin geometries, patterns of Quaternary faulting in and beneath basin-fill sediments, and rationale to select locations for other geophysical surveys and drilling. The strategy involves standard geologic and geophysical techniques but includes early deployment of high-resolution <b>aeromagnetic</b> <b>surveys</b> to establish intra-basin fault patterns. This provides reliable information to focus deployment of more detailed and expensive geophysical surveys, and to site exploration wells. In addition, high-resolution <b>aeromagnetic</b> <b>surveys</b> can provide previously unavailable insight into the structural setting of established geothermal fields...|$|R
5000|$|McCafferty Spur (...) is a spur on {{the north}} face of Butcher Ridge, in the Cook Mountains of Antarctica, 5.5 nmi km {{northwest}} of Mount Ayres. It was named after Anne McCafferty, a geophysicist with the United States Geological Survey (USGS), who in 1991-92 worked on a USGS <b>aeromagnetic</b> <b>survey</b> over the Ross Ice Shelf and, in a cooperative USGS-German project, participated in the first aeromagnetic flight across the Butcher Ridge and Cook Mountains.|$|E
50|$|An <b>aeromagnetic</b> <b>survey</b> is {{a common}} type of {{geophysical}} survey carried out using a magnetometer aboard or towed behind an aircraft. The principle {{is similar to a}} magnetic survey carried out with a hand-held magnetometer, but allows much larger areas of the Earth's surface to be covered quickly for regional reconnaissance. The aircraft typically flies in a grid-like pattern with height and line spacing determining the resolution of the data (and cost of the survey per unit area).|$|E

50|$|Aerovan {{production}} {{started in}} 1946 primarily for civil use, although examples were used briefly {{by the military}} of Israel and New Zealand. Production ended late in 1947. A licence was granted to manufacture the type in France but no production resulted. One RNZAF machine was converted, unsuccessfully, for aerial fertiliser spreading and a second for <b>aeromagnetic</b> <b>survey</b> work. One Mark 6 was used for research with a Hurel-Dubois high aspect ratio wing in 1957, being then known as the HDM.105. The prototype retroactively named the Mark 1 was later fitted with a 5/6th replica of the Armstrong Siddeley Mamba turboprop nacelle for the Miles Marathon.|$|E

5000|$|Sales of the Cresco {{were not}} as {{impressive}} {{as those of the}} piston-engine powered Fletcher, with only 39 examples being built before production was terminated. The Cresco has been sold in several countries and has pioneered new utility roles not explored by the Fletcher. Although used primarily to spread superphosphate fertiliser, the Cresco is also used in the utility role, especially as a skydiving platform, where its fast rate of climb (1560 ft/min m/s) has made it popular, and as a firefighting water bomber, a role it can perform with little alteration from its standard agricultural layout. One aircraft has been converted for <b>aeromagnetic</b> <b>survey.</b> A disadvantage in the utility role is the low internal volume available for the relatively high-powered engine.The Cresco is normally flown by a single pilot, but has a second seat in all versions. It can carry nine (rather cramped) sky divers. Usual powerplant is a [...] Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6-34AG.|$|E
30|$|We have {{conducted}} <b>aeromagnetic</b> <b>surveys</b> at Shinmoe-dake twice in 2011, using an unmanned autonomous helicopter. The average magnetization intensity around Shinmoe-dake is 1.5 A/m, {{suggesting that the}} volcanic edifice is covered with relatively new volcanic material, or has lost magnetic minerals by post-eruption alteration. The magnetization model shows a weakly-magnetized area extending {{to the north and}} northwest of Shinmoe-dake. This area may correspond to the magma supply path from the deep magma chamber to Shinmoe-dake. The differences in the total magnetic field observed between two observations show positive and negative magnetic anomalies in the south and north of the Shinmoe-dake edifice, respectively. The spatial pattern of the anomaly suggests lava cooling in the summit crater. The calculated magnetic anomaly, assuming completely cooled lava in the summit crater between the two <b>aeromagnetic</b> <b>surveys,</b> explains the observed anomaly. But the magnetic intensity that best explains the observation seems rather low. Lava cooling of 20 – 70 % by rainfall in and around the summit area can explain the majority of the observed anomaly.|$|R
30|$|As a first {{application}} to <b>aeromagnetic</b> <b>surveys</b> of an unmanned helicopter with a cesium magnetometer, we carried out high resolution aeromagnetic measurements at Izu-Oshima, Japan, which revealed a detailed shallow magmatic structure inside the summit caldera (Kaneko et al., 2010, 2011). This system {{was also used}} for surveys of {{the northern part of}} Sakurajima in 2010 and 2011. The latest application of this system was at the Tarumae volcano, Hokkaido, Japan (Hashimoto et al., 2012).|$|R
50|$|<b>Aeromagnetic</b> <b>surveys</b> {{are widely}} used {{to aid in the}} {{production}} of geological maps and are also commonly used during mineral exploration and petroleum exploration. Some mineral deposits are associated with an increase or decrease in the abundance of magnetic minerals, and occasionally the sought after commodity may itself be magnetic (e.g. iron ore deposits), but often the elucidation of the subsurface structure of the upper crust is the most valuable contribution of the aeromagnetic data.|$|R
