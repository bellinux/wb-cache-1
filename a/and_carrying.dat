5|$|During their RAAF service, the Chinooks also {{undertook}} {{a range of}} non-military tasks. The helicopters frequently formed part of the Australian Defence Force's response to natural disasters, including by delivering food for people and livestock cut off by floods. They were also used for civilian construction tasks such as emplacing lighthouses <b>and</b> <b>carrying</b> air conditioning plants {{to the top of}} tall buildings. On two occasions Chinooks supported Queensland Police Service drug eradication efforts in remote parts of the state by transporting fuel for RAAF Iroquois helicopters <b>and</b> <b>carrying</b> seized narcotics. In August 1981, two CH-47s lifted containers from the cargo ship Waigani Express to enable the vessel to be refloated after it ran aground in the Torres Strait. A similar operation was undertaken to free the Anro Asia when it ran aground near Caloundra, Queensland, in November the same year. Another unusual task was conducted in December 1981 when a Chinook transported two bulldozers onto a grounded iron ore carrier near Port Hedland, Western Australia, so that they could be used to reposition the ship's load.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Reversible {{logic is}} {{emerging}} as a promising computing paradigm, having its applications in low-power CMOS, quantum computing, nanotech-nology and optical computing. Firstly, we showed a modified design of conventional BCD subtractors and also proposed designs of <b>carry</b> look-ahead <b>and</b> <b>carry</b> skip BCD subtractors. The proposed designs of <b>carry</b> look-ahead <b>and</b> <b>carry</b> skip BCD subtractors {{are based on the}} novel designs of <b>carry</b> look-ahead <b>and</b> <b>carry</b> skip BCD adders, respectively. Then, we introduced the reversible logic implementation of the modified conventional, as well as the proposed, <b>carry</b> look-ahead <b>and</b> <b>carry</b> skip BCD subtractors efficient {{in terms of the number}} of reversible gates used and garbage output produced. To the best of our knowledge, the <b>carry</b> look-ahead <b>and</b> <b>carry</b> skip BCD subtractors and their reversible logic design are explored for the first time ever in literature...|$|R
5000|$|A Pick <b>and</b> <b>Carry</b> Crane {{is similar}} to a mobile crane in that is {{designed}} to travel on public roads; however, Pick <b>and</b> <b>Carry</b> cranes have no stabiliser legs or outriggers and are designed to lift the load <b>and</b> <b>carry</b> it to its destination, within a small radius, then be able to drive to the next job. Pick <b>and</b> <b>Carry</b> cranes are popular in Australia where large distances are encountered between job sites. One popular manufacturer in Australia was Franna, who have since been bought by Terex, and now all Pick <b>and</b> <b>Carry</b> cranes are commonly referred to as [...] "Frannas" [...] even though they may be made by other manufacturers. Nearly every medium and large sized crane company in Australia has at least one and many companies have fleets of these cranes. The capacity range is usually ten to twenty tonnes maximum lift, although this is much less {{at the tip of the}} boom. Pick <b>and</b> <b>Carry</b> cranes have displaced the work usually completed by smaller truck cranes as the set-up time is much quicker. Many steel fabrication yards also use Pick <b>and</b> <b>Carry</b> cranes as they can [...] "walk" [...] with fabricated steel sections and place these where required with relative ease.|$|R

5|$|Nuclear import {{depends on}} the importin binding its cargo in the {{cytoplasm}} <b>and</b> <b>carrying</b> it through the nuclear pore into the nucleus. Inside the nucleus, RanGTP acts to separate the cargo from the importin, allowing the importin to exit the nucleus and be reused. Nuclear export is similar, as the exportin binds the cargo inside the nucleus in a process facilitated by RanGTP, exits through the nuclear pore, and separates from its cargo in the cytoplasm.|$|E

5|$|Uneven heating {{can cause}} newly {{generated}} gases {{to break out}} of a weak spot on the surface of comet's nucleus, like a geyser. These streams of gas and dust can cause the nucleus to spin, and even split apart. In 2010 it was revealed dry ice (frozen carbon dioxide) can power jets of material flowing out of a comet nucleus. Infrared imaging of Hartley 2 shows such jets exiting <b>and</b> <b>carrying</b> with it dust grains into the coma.|$|E

The payload integration program was responsible for determining how the various demands of these customers could be satisfied, and how mixed payloads could best be physically accommodated within the cargo bay of the shuttle. During these years Lunney also spent time working at NASA Headquarters in Washington, D.C., as Deputy Associate Administrator for Space Flight and later as Acting Associate Administrator for Space Transportation Operations.|$|E

5|$|Allied {{planners}} {{proposed that}} small boats, towing large radar reflecting balloons (code named Filbert) <b>and</b> <b>carrying</b> both Moonshine jamming and standard wireless equipment (for transmitting fake traffic), would advance toward the French coast {{under a cloud}} of Window. The chaff and other countermeasures would hide {{the small size of}} the naval force while wireless traffic would play on the FUSAG story to mislead the Germans into expecting a major landing. A third deceptive force, Operation Big Drum, would use radar countermeasures on the western flank of the true invasion fleet. This operation was intended to lend confusion as to the extent of the landings in Normandy.|$|E
5|$|Although Desha was universally {{acknowledged}} {{as the leading}} candidate during {{the early months of}} the campaign, as election day approached, some began to doubt whether he could withstand the withering attacks of the Anti-Relief Party. The Frankfort Argus, a pro-Desha newspaper, remained confident, however, predicting that the Relief candidate would win by a margin of 4-to-1. On election day, Desha secured a comfortable victory, receiving 38,378 votes, nearly 60% of the votes cast, <b>and</b> <b>carrying</b> large majorities even in some strongly Anti-Relief counties. Tompkins garnered 22,499 votes, with his support concentrated mostly in Central Kentucky. Russell finished third with 3,900 votes. Desha and his allies in the General Assembly interpreted the victory as a mandate from the voters to aggressively pursue their debt relief agenda.|$|E
