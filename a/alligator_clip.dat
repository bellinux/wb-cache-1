50|$|Receiver: To go {{with the}} {{spark-gap}} transmitter, Morgan proceeds to build a receiver {{to go with it}} so they can listen in on any responses. She installs a second antenna to the roof of the warehouse and wraps a piece of insulated copper coil around a discarded peanut butter jar. She then hooks the receiver up to a telephone headset and later to a television to listen for any form of radio communication. By moving an <b>alligator</b> <b>clip</b> across the wires, she can pick up different AM frequencies.|$|E
50|$|A typical {{voltmeter}} probe {{consists of}} a single wire test lead that has on one end a connector that fits the voltmeter {{and on the other}} end a rigid, tubular plastic section that comprises both a handle and probe body. The handle allows a person to hold and guide the probe without influencing the measurement (by becoming part of the electric circuit) or being exposed to dangerous voltages that might cause electric shock. Within the probe body, the wire is connected to a rigid, pointed metal tip that contacts the DUT. Some probes allow an <b>alligator</b> <b>clip</b> to be attached to the tip, thus enabling the probe to be attached to the DUT so that it need not be held in place.|$|E
5000|$|A {{crocodile}} clip (also <b>alligator</b> <b>clip</b> or spring clip) is a sprung metal clip with long, serrated jaws {{which is used}} for creating a temporary electrical connection. This simple mechanical device gets {{its name from the}} resemblance of its jaws to that of an alligator's or crocodile's. It is used to connect an electrical cable to a battery or some other component. Functioning much like a spring-loaded clothespin, the clip's tapered, serrated jaws are forced together by a spring to grip an object. When manufactured for electronics testing and evaluation, one jaw of the clip is typically permanently crimped or soldered to a wire, or is bent to form the inner tubular contact of a ~4 mm female banana jack, enabling quick non-permanent connection between a circuit under test and laboratory equipment or to another electrical circuit. The clip is typically covered by a plastic shroud or [...] "boot" [...] to prevent accidental short-circuits.|$|E

5000|$|In an unreported Indiana case, Sprecher wrote, a three-judge {{district}} court panel {{had found a}} more detailed ordinance too vague {{in the use of}} the similar phrase [...] "designed for use with drugs" [...] since many legal items could be used, or easily altered for use, as drug delivery devices. He read the guidelines written for Hoffman Estates ordinance by the village attorney as using [...] "designed" [...] to denote [...] "those items which are inherently suited only for drug use, and are thus covered by the ordinance regardless of the manner of display or avowed intent of the retailer." [...] However, even in one case where the guidelines left no room for interpretation based on the latter, the guidelines were insufficient. For example, the guidelines state that [...] "roach clips" [...] are [...] "designed for use with illegal cannabis or drugs and therefore covered" ... But the guidelines do not define [...] "roach clip." [...] Consequently, stocking any item that could possibly be used as a roach clip, such as an <b>alligator</b> <b>clip</b> or bobby pin, could subject a retailer to the licensing requirement. In reality, it is inconceivable that sale of these innocent items would subject a hardware store or drugstore to the burdens of the license fee and sales register, as well as to the label of [...] "drug paraphernalia store." [...] Perhaps the village wishes to draw a line between items which inherently are roach clips and [...] "innocent" [...] items merely used as roach clips. But neither the ordinance nor the guidelines draws this distinction, and we are uncertain as to whether any definition of a roach clip could draw such a distinction based on design alone.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{describes}} four significant {{breakthroughs in}} the syntheses and test-ing of molecular scale electronic devices. The 16 -mer of oligo(2 -dodecylphenylene ethy-nylene) was prepared on Merrifield’s resin using the iterative divergent/convergent approach which significantly streamlines {{the preparation of}} this molecular scale wire. The formation of self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) and multilayers on gold surfaces of rigid rod conjugated oligomers that have thiol, α,ω-dithiol, thioacetyl, or α,ω-dithioacetyl end groups have been studied. The direct observation of charge transport through molecules of benzene- 1, 4 -dithiol, which have been self-assembled onto two facing gold electrodes, has been achieved. Finally, we are reporting initial studies into what effect varying the molecu-lar <b>alligator</b> <b>clip</b> has on the molecular scale wire’s conductivity...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work is to design and {{validate}} an innovative magnetic-based device for tissue retraction for minimally invasive surgery. An intra-abdominal magnetic module is coupled with an extracorporeal system for establishing a stable attraction, and consequently a reliable tissue retraction. Once the retractor has been inserted into the abdomen, tissue retraction is not constrained by a fixed access port, thus guaranteeing a more flexible, safer and less invasive operation. The intra-abdominal unit is composed of an axial permanent magnet attached to a stainless-steel non-magnetic <b>alligator</b> <b>clip</b> by a traditional suturing thread. A miniaturized mechanism to adjust {{the length of the}} suturing thread for lengthening or shortening the distance between the tissue grasper and the internal magnetic unit is included. A multiphysics approach assured a dedicated design that thoroughly fulfills anatomical, physiological and engineering constraints. System functionalities were demonstrated both in in-vitro and ex-vivo conditions, reaching good results and promising outcomes in terms of effectiveness and maneuverability. The retractor was successfully tested in an animal model, carrying out a whole retraction procedure. The proposed retraction system resulted to be intuitive, reliable, robust and easy to use, representing a suitable device for MIS procedures...|$|E
40|$|Background: We {{carried out}} a bench study of implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) {{performance}} in order to investigate whether the right ventricular (RV) ring contributes to the occurrence of a high-voltage (HV) short circuit. Methods: A polycarbonate water bath with 0. 18 % saline was prepared. An ICD lead was connected to an ICD device and both were placed into the water bath. The impedance of each electrode and coil was measured. In the first experiment, the RV ring was shorted to the RV coil using an <b>alligator</b> <b>clip.</b> The impedance of each electrode and coil at shorting was measured. A maximum energy defibrillation shock was delivered. The therapy log confirmed the HV short circuit and the delivery conditions. In the second experiment, a short circuit was established between the RV ring and the superior vena cava coil and a similar procedure was followed. Results: No HV short circuit was observed in either experiment. Scheduled shock energies were delivered without problems. Some changes in pace–sense impedance or coil impedance were observed, but they remained within the normal range. Conclusions: The RV ring conductor {{is not related to}} HV short circuits, even if the RV ring and/or RV ring conductor is placed in contact with HV electrodes...|$|E
30|$|A {{high voltage}} power supply (CPS- 60 K 02 V 1, Chungpa EMT Co.in Republic of Korea) capable of {{generating}} voltages up to 30  kV {{was used as}} the electric field source for spinning of nanofibers. Solutions to be electrospun were supplied through a 20 -mL plastic syringe attached with stainless steel having 22 gages, (0.7  mm OD ×  0.4  mm ID). The feeding rate of solution to be electrospun was adjusted to be 0.2  mL min− 1 by using a syringe pump (KDS- 100, KD Scientific, United States). The syringe was aligned perpendicular to flat bed collector of electrospinning apparatus. The wire originated from the positive electrode (anode) was connected with the needle tip of plastic syringe with an <b>alligator</b> <b>clip.</b> Finally, the solutions were electrospun at + 18  kV. The distance between the needle tip and the flat bed metallic collector covered with aluminum foil was kept at 15  cm. The as-spun nanofibers were vacuously dried at 60  °C for 24  h in the presence of P 2 O 5 to remove the residual moisture from used solvents.
