Continuum removal, or baseline normalization, is a numerical method to estimate the absorptions not due to the band of interest and to remove their effects. The aim was to analyze the impact of different treatments of nitrogen and different irrigation levels on spectral parameters gotten with continuum removal method (band depth and band area) of bean crop. The continuum removal consist in normalize absorption bands. The absorption band, on visible region centered on 665 nm, was studied in terms of band depth and band wide. Field canopy reflectance measurements were acquired at six bean growth stages over 48 plots with the SPECTRON SE- 590 spectroradiometer. The experimental design was the randomized blocks, with split plots, with 12 treatments, 4 irrigation levels (179, 5; 256, 5; 357, 5 e 406, 2 mm) and 3 nitrogen doses (0; 80 e 160 kg ha- 1), and four replicates.

40|$|Resumen del trabajo presentado a la 20 th International Conference on Solid Compounds of Transition Elements, celebrada del 11 al 15 de abril de 2016 en Zaragoza (España). Molecular overlayers on ordered {{substrates}} {{have a broad}} {{field of}} application in catalysis, sensing, molecular electronics, light-to-energy conversion, etc. In particular, bio-inspired oxygen-binding metalated macrocycles, such as iron-phtalocyanines (FePc), are being investigated as viable substitutes for precious metals in catalysis of the Oxygen Reduction Reaction (ORR) in low-temperature fuel cells. Recent studies of FePc on Ag(110) have shown that sub-monolayer (sub-ML) phases are catalitically active; remarkably, in oxygen-dosed phases O 2 intercalates between the molecules and the surface thereby substantially changing the Fe magnetic moment. Reversible switching of the Fe magnetic moment in some low-density (LD) FePc phases upon an oxygenation (OD) - annealing (ANN) cycle has been demonstrated. In this contribution {{we report on the}} structural and magnetic changes along a catalytic cycle of a new “quasi-squared” FePc sub-ML phase (R 3) evaporated on Ag(110), Fig. a. Structural changes were monitored by Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM) and Low Energy Electron Diffraction (LEED).

XLPA and XMCD (Fig. b) analysis evidence the new R 3 phase is catalitically active, however, oxygenation / deoxydation is less effective than previously characterised LD phase: only partial oxygenation is achieved (about 20...|$|E
