50|$|The Kennedy Center honored Ginger Rogers in December 1992.

50|$|In May 1994, News Corporation, then-parent of the Fox network, {{purchased}} a 20% ownership stake (amounting to a $500 million investment) in WJBK's owner New World Communications.

Fox outbid CBS <b>for</b> the NFL <b>broadcast</b> <b>rights</b> {{on the condition that}} it would improve the network's affiliate coverage in the larger television markets.

50|$|According to {{the book}} Monday Night Mayhem (Reed Business Information, 1988), the National Football League {{received}} a bid from HTN <b>for</b> <b>broadcast</b> <b>rights</b> to Monday Night Football; this, while negotiations with ABC were nearing a standoff. HTN was reportedly offering a significantly higher price than any other network, including ABC. Reportedly, had Hughes made the deal, half of ABC's affiliates would have carried the HTN football games anyway, including at least one ABC owned-and-operated station. Ultimately, the league agreed {{that it would be}} in the NFL's best interests to sign with an established network, eventually striking a deal with ABC for a lower amount than Hughes was offering.|$|R

50|$|Strained {{relations}} between the NFL and its players' union quieted down significantly in the 1990s, {{and the development of}} free agency as well as a salary cap led to peaceful {{relations between}} the two entities for over a decade. This was helped by new television contracts: in 1994, Fox Broadcasting Company set the tone <b>for</b> <b>broadcast</b> <b>rights</b> to the NFL when it outbid CBS for the right to air NFC games with an unheard-of bid of US$395,000,000. This brought total <b>broadcast</b> <b>rights</b> fees <b>for</b> the league to over US$1,000,000,000. In 1998, when CBS outbid NBC for the rights to the AFC, the total rights fees doubled to over US$2,000,000,000. This is in addition to the rights fee for NFL Sunday Ticket, a package offered exclusively to the DirecTV satellite television service, that began in the mid-1990s.|$|R

50|$|Though its {{broadcasts}} {{began in}} 1929, WTMJ {{did not begin}} paying the Packers <b>for</b> <b>broadcast</b> <b>rights</b> until 1943; it paid the team $7500 to broadcast the season. In the early 1930s, there was no exclusive <b>right</b> given to <b>broadcast</b> games, and WHBY, then based in Green Bay, often sent its own announcers to call the game. From 1933 to 1936, three additional stations carried WTMJ's radio broadcasts of Packer games: WLBL in Stevens Point (a non-commercial station owned by the state commerce department decades before the creation of Wisconsin Public Radio), WTAQ in Green Bay and WKBH in La Crosse. WSAW in Wausau and WJMS in Ironwood, Michigan started carrying the feed in 1937.|$|R
5000|$|In preparation, the Japanese {{constructed}} new largescale {{facilities at}} Sapporo and conducted a trial run {{a full year}} {{in advance of the}} Games. An international sport week was held in February, 1971, to assess the city's preparations as well as [...] "to test its civic mettle and hospitality", and this effort was acclaimed by Olympic observers as [...] "a complete success". The development of new infrastructure proved to be a huge boon for the Sapporo economy: {{by the time of the}} Games, the national government had invested some US$500 million in upgrades, including a new subway. The Games' organizers themselves turned a healthy profit in part because they arranged a record $8.47 million <b>for</b> <b>broadcast</b> <b>rights.</b>|$|R
50|$|Fox {{placed a}} bid <b>for</b> NHL <b>broadcast</b> <b>rights</b> {{when they came}} up for renewal in 2011, but {{dropped out of the}} running {{as a result of a}} bidding war between NBCUniversal and ESPN.

50|$|The Conservative Party {{was founded}} as the Romanian Humanist Party (PUR) on 18 December 1991 and {{was for a}} time {{a member of the}} Humanist International. It changed its name in 2005 to reflect a shift in its {{ideology}} from centrist politics to more conservative, right-wing politics. The party was founded by Dan Voiculescu, a businessman who formally gave control of his companies to relatives. Voiculescu was the founder and former owner of an important media chain comprising among others the top-ranking TV channel Antena 1 and the newspapers Jurnalul Naţional and Gazeta Sporturilor. According to CNA (the state <b>agency</b> <b>for</b> <b>broadcast</b> licensing), he retains significant influence in the Romanian mass media, either through his foundation or through his family.|$|R
25|$|In 1976, {{the team}} was {{purchased}} by media magnate Ted Turner, owner of superstation WTBS, {{as a means to}} keep the team (and one of his main programming staples) in Atlanta.
