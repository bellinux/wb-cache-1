5|$|COPD {{is a type}} of obstructive {{lung disease}} in which chronic incompletely {{reversible}} poor airflow (<b>airflow</b> <b>limitation)</b> and inability to breathe out fully (air trapping) exist. The poor airflow is the result of breakdown of lung tissue (known as emphysema) and small airways disease (known as obstructive bronchiolitis). The relative contributions of these two factors vary between people. Severe destruction of small airways can lead to the formation of large air pockets—known as bullae—that replace lung tissue.

50|$|In {{the summer}} of 1943, a brand-new La-5 made a forced landing on a German {{airfield}} providing the Luftwaffe {{with an opportunity to}} test-fly the newest Soviet fighter. Test pilot Hans-Werner Lerche wrote a detailed report of his experience. He particularly noted that the La-5FN excelled at altitudes below 3,000 m (9,843 ft) but suffered from short range and flight time of only 40 minutes at cruise engine power. All of the engine controls (throttle, mixture, propeller pitch, radiator and cowl flaps, and supercharger gearbox) had separate levers which forced the pilot to make constant adjustments during combat or risk suboptimal performance. For example, rapid acceleration required moving no less than six levers. In contrast, contemporary German aircraft, especially the BMW 801 radial-engined variants of the Focke-Wulf Fw 190 front line fighter, had largely automatic engine controls with the pilot operating a single lever and electromechanical devices, like the Kommandogerät pioneering engine computer on the radial-engined Fw 190s, making the appropriate adjustments. Due to <b>airflow</b> <b>limitations,</b> the engine boost system (Forsazh) could not be used above 2,000 m (6,562 ft). Stability in all axes was generally good. The authority of the ailerons was deemed exceptional but the rudder was insufficiently powerful at lower speeds. At speeds in excess of 600 km/h (370 mph), the forces on control surfaces became excessive. Horizontal turn time at 1,000 m (3,281 ft) and maximum engine power was 25 seconds.|$|R
40|$|Objective: Chronic lung {{problems}} often constrain {{physical independence}} of older occupants. The usefulness and practicality {{of an existing}} physical independence level assessment has been studied. Methods: Nine independently living older occupants (aged 52 - 73) with chronic lung disease participated in a pilot study. Physical performance in daily activities was determined from heart-rate and body-movement registrations during a seven-day period at home and a standardised cycle ergometer test in hospital. The individual’s baseline for physical independence was deduced from physical performance outdoors. Results: The highest actual energy expenditure at a relative physical strain of 40 % allowed us to assign subjects to physical independence levels 3 (4 subjects) or 4 (5 subjects). At level 3 activity accommodations, technical aids, and informal assistance are required; at level 4 professional assistance is needed too. Subjects at level 4 had lower values of body weight, body height, peak oxygen uptake, and peak minute ventilation than subjects at level 3. The severity of <b>airflow</b> <b>limitations</b> did not predict physical independence level. Physical performance during outdoor walking showed a higher relative physical strain (above 40 %) at physical independence level 4 as compared to 3. This high strain limits duration of performance {{as a way of}} activity accommodation. Conclusion: Physical independence level assessment is suited to distinguish baselines for physical independence levels 3 and 4 under daily living conditions in older occupants with chronic lung disease. In the future, the assessment method may give insight into the influence of efficacious interventions on physical performance parameters...|$|R
50|$|The {{size of the}} EFA device {{limits the}} amount of airflow that can be generated. A {{possible}} improvement involves layering or stacking a series of EFA devices to increase the <b>airflow.</b> Existing <b>limitations</b> and focus areas in this approach are that larger device sizes are inconvenient, especially for smaller applications such as netbooks. There can be interference between the stages, where the attractor electrode of the first stage and the ionizing electrode of the next stage produce an unwanted corona effect, which can actually result in reverse airflow. Alternatively, sparking can also occur if the layers are placed too close together. It is believed that careful design of the geometry of the devices can improve on all these issues.|$|R
50|$|Both short- and long-acting β2-agonists {{are used}} to treat chronic obstructive {{pulmonary}} disease. COPD causes airflow limitations in the lungs because of inflammation.

Emphysematous mice were treated with G-CSF (3 cycles of 200 mg/kg/day for 5 consecutive days, with 7 -day intervals) or saline and submitted to a third evaluation 8 weeks after treatment. Values of run distance and linear intercept measurement were expressed as mean SD and compared applying a paired t-test. Effects of treatment on these parameters were analyzed applying a Repeated Measures ANOVA, followed by Tukey’s post hoc analysis. p < 0. 05 was considered statistically significant. Twenty eight days later, animals ran significantly less in a treadmill compared to normal mice (549. 7 181. 2 m and 821. 7 131. 3 m, respectively; p < 0. 01). Treatment with G-CSF significantly increased the exercise capacity of emphysematous mice (719. 6 200. 5 m), whereas saline treatment had no effect on distance run (595. 8 178. 5 m). The PCR cytokines genes analysis did not detect difference between experimental groups. Morphometric analyses in the lung showed that saline-treated mice had a mean linear intercept significantly higher (p < 0. 01) when compared to mice treated with G-CSF, which did not significantly differ from that of normal mice. Treatment with G-CSF promoted the recovery of exercise capacity and regeneration of alveolar structural alterations in emphysematous mice...|$|R
30|$|For {{hundreds}} of years, the pulmonary {{system has been}} used to deliver pharmacologically active compounds to the body [47]. The lungs allow for efficient drug delivery as they have a large surface area and are well vascularized [35]. For example, inhaled nicotine is readily absorbed across the pulmonary epithelia into the bloodstream where it can exert its psychotropic effects on the brain [5]. Conversely, for many peptides/proteins, an inability to cross the respiratory epithelium after inhaled delivery may actually be advantageous as it would result in a high ratio of lung to systemic bioavailability and thus would reduce off-target effects [25]. As a case in point, inhaled antibiotics achieve far higher concentrations with far fewer side effects than orally delivered antibiotics [55, 62]. The majority of drugs in use today are classed as “small molecules.” That is, organic chemicals typically bind to their receptor to elicit a response [41, 57]. Since these molecules are often extremely durable, until metabolized by the liver and/or cleared by the kidney, they can have side effects in other organs [22]. In contrast, biological therapeutics, including proteins (e.g., antibodies, enzymes) and peptides, show considerable promise and are emerging as alternatives to small molecule-based drugs [19]. Some protein-based therapies have failed in the clinic, since they are more labile than small molecules and are prone to proteolytic degradation in the blood [32, 39]. However, protein-based therapies show great promise for many types of respiratory disease since they can be delivered to the target organ directly by inhalation. Additionally, whilst small molecules typically have nanomolar potency, biologicals often have picomolar to femtomolar potency due to their increased ability to bind to their protein target with high affinity. This increased binding is achieved due to the ability of proteins and peptides to change their conformation during binding to better fit the binding pocket in their receptor [2]. This review concentrates on asthma, cystic fibrosis (CF), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), three respiratory diseases typified by <b>airflow</b> <b>limitations</b> and poor alveolar gas exchange.|$|R

The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the predictors of uncontrolled BA in a group of elderly patients from western Romania. Patients and methods: We retrospectively evaluated 126 elderly patients (aged ≥ 65 years), who were consecutively evaluated in the Pulmonology Department of Victor Babes Hospital, Timisoara, Romania, between March 2009 and July 2012. We collected demographic data, performed pulmonary function testing and an asthma control test (ACT), and evaluated the level of BA control based on the 2012 Global Initiative for Asthma guidelines. Statistical processing of the data was done using the Epi Info and STATA programs. Results: In our study group, 36 (29 %) patients were men and 90 (71 %) were women; their mean age was 74. 42 ± 8. 32 years (range: 65 – 85 years). A total of 14. 28 % of patients were smokers. About 30. 15 % of patients had an ACT score < 19, 54. 76 % had an ACT score 20 – 24, and 15. 09 % had an ACT of 25. Moreover, 59. 52 % had normal spirometry results. Infectious exacerbations were found in 58. 73 % of patients. A history of allergies was demonstrated in 48. 41 % of patients, 34. 12 % had occupational exposure, and 82. 53 % of patients were treated with inhaled corticosteroids. Our results showed that 30. 15 % of patients had uncontrolled BA. We found six predictive factors for uncontrolled BA: infectious exacerbation, occupational exposure, mixed (obstructive and restrictive) ventilatory dysfunction, persistent airway obstruction on spirometry, duration of disease in months, and current smoking status. Infectious exacerbations, persistent airway obstructions, and occupational exposure were the most powerful predictors. Conclusion: Elderly patients represent an important group that is at risk for developing uncontrolled BA.

40|$|Asthma is {{a chronic}} {{inflammatory}} disorder of the respiratory airways affecting {{people of all}} ages, and constitutes a serious public health problem worldwide (6). Such a chronic inflammation is invariably associated with injury and repair of the bronchial epithelium known as remodelling (11). Inflammation, remodelling, and altered neural control of the airways are responsible for both recurrent exacerbations of asthma and increasingly permanent airflow obstruction (11, 29, 34). Excessive airway narrowing is caused by altered smooth muscle behaviour, in close interaction with swelling of the airway walls, parenchyma retractile forces, and enhanced intraluminal secretions (29, 38). All these functional and structural changes {{are associated with the}} characteristic symptoms of asthma – cough, chest tightness, and wheezing –and {{have a significant impact on}} patients’ daily lives, on their families and also on society (1, 24, 29). Recent epidemiological studies show an increase in the prevalence of asthma, mainly in industrial countries (12, 25, 37). The reasons for this increase may depend on host factors (e. g., genetic disposition) or on environmental factors like air pollution or contact with allergens (6, 22, 29). Physical exercise is probably the most common trigger for brief episodes of symptoms, and is assumed to induce <b>airflow</b> <b>limitations</b> in most asthmatic children and young adults (16, 24, 29, 33). Exercise-induced asthma (EIA) is defined as an intermittent narrowing of the airways, generally associated with respiratory symptoms (chest tightness, cough, wheezing and dyspnoea), occurring after 3 to 10 minutes of vigorous exercise with a maximal severity during 5 to 15 minutes after the end of the exercise (9, 14, 16, 24, 33). The definitive diagnosis of EIA is confirmed by the measurement of pre- and post-exercise expiratory flows documenting either a 15 % fall in the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1), or a ≥ 15 to 20 % fall in peak expiratory flow (PEF) (9, 24, 29). Some types of physical exercise have been associated with the occurrence of bronchial symptoms and asthma (5, 15, 17). For instance, demanding activities such as basketball or soccer could cause more severe attacks than less vigorous ones such as baseball or jogging (33). The mechanisms of exercise-induced <b>airflow</b> <b>limitations</b> seem to be related to changes in the respiratory mucosa induced by hyperventilation (9, 29). The heat loss from the airways during exercise, and possibly its post-exercise rewarming may contribute to the exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) (27). Additionally, the concomitant dehydration from the respiratory mucosa during exercise leads to an increased interstitial osmolarity, which may also contribute to bronchoconstriction (4, 36). So, the risk of EIB in asthmatically predisposed subjects seems to be higher with greater ventilation rates and the cooler and drier the inspired air is (23). The incidence of EIA in physically demanding coldweather sports like competitive figure skating and ice hockey has been found to occur in up to 30 to 35 % of the participants (32). In contrast, swimming is often recommended to asthmatic individuals, because it improves the functionality of respiratory muscles and, moreover, it seems to have a concomitant beneficial effect on the prevalence of asthma exacerbations (14, 26), supporting the idea that the risk of EIB would be smaller in warm and humid environments. This topic, however, remains controversial since the chlorified water of swimming pools has been suspected as a potential trigger factor for some asthmatic patients (7, 8, 20, 21). In fact, the higher asthma incidence observed in industrialised countries has recently been linked to the exposition to chloride (7, 8, 30). Although clinical and epidemiological data suggest an influence of humidity and temperature of the inspired air on the bronchial response of asthmatic subjects during exercise, some of those studies did not accurately control the intensity of the exercise (2, 13), raising speculation of whether the experienced exercise overload was comparable for all subjects. Additionally, most of the studies did not include a control group (2, 10, 19, 39), which may lead to doubts about whether asthma per se has conditioned the observed results. Moreover, since the main targeted age group of these studies has been adults (10, 19, 39), any extrapolation to childhood/adolescence might be questionable regarding the different lung maturation. Considering the higher incidence of asthma in youngsters (30) and the fact that only the works of Amirav and coworkers (2, 3) have focused on this age group, a scarcity of scientific data can be identified. Additionally, since the main environmental trigger factors, i. e., temperature and humidity, were tested separately (10, 28, 39) it would be useful to analyse these two variables simultaneously because of their synergic effect on water and heat loss by the airways (31, 33). It also appears important to estimate the airway responsiveness to exercise within moderate environmental ranges of temperature and humidity, trying to avoid extreme temperatures and humidity conditions used by others (2, 3). So, the aim of this study was to analyse the influence of moderate changes in air temperature and humidity simultaneously on the acute ventilatory response to exercise in asthmatic children. To overcome the above referred to methodological limitations, we used a 15 minute progressive exercise trial on a cycle ergometer at 3 different workload intensities, and we collected data related to heart rate, respiratory quotient, minute ventilation and oxygen uptake in order to ensure that physiological exercise repercussions were the same in both environments. The tests were done in a “normal” climatic environment (in a gymnasium) and in a hot and humid environment (swimming pool); for the latter, direct chloride exposition was avoided...|$|R

Comprehensive PR programs include patient assessment, exercise training, education, and psychosocial support [Nici et al. 2006].

Indeed, both COPD (induced by smoking or other noxious agents) and asthma {{may be associated}} with a decline of lung function that should cause fixed <b>airflow</b> <b>limitation.</b> In the presence of fixed <b>airflow</b> <b>limitation,</b> patients are often diagnosed COPD, even if the differential diagnosis between asthma and COPD in these patients may be important as the natural history as well as the response to treatment are different, depending on whether fixed <b>airflow</b> <b>limitation</b> is due to asthma or COPD. The assessment of patients presenting with fixed <b>airflow</b> <b>limitation</b> has recently hightlighted that airway inflammation is markedly different in asthma and COPD although characterized by the same degree of <b>airflow</b> <b>limitation.</b> Thus, asthma with fixed <b>airflow</b> <b>limitation</b> maintain the same pathological characteristics as asthma with completely reversible <b>airflow</b> <b>limitation.</b> In conclusion, subjects with asthma have distinct characteristics compared with subjects with COPD.

40|$|Rationale: The {{aim of the}} ALICE (<b>Airflow</b> <b>Limitation</b> in Cardiac Diseases in Europe) {{study was}} to {{investigate}} the prevalence of <b>airflow</b> <b>limitation</b> in patients with ischemic heart disease and the effects on quality of life, healthcare use, and future health risk. Objectives: To examine prebronchodilator and post-bronchodilator spirometry in outpatients aged {{greater than or equal to}} 40 years with clinically documented ischemic heart disease who were current or former smokers. Methods: This multicenter, cross-sectional study was conducted in 15 cardiovascular outpatient clinics in nine European countries. <b>Airflow</b> <b>limitation</b> was defined as post-bronchodilator FEV 1 /FVC less than 0. 70. Measurements and Main Results: Among the 3, 103 patients with ischemic heart disease who were recruited, lung function was defined for 2, 730 patients. <b>Airflow</b> <b>limitation</b> was observed in 30. 5 % of patients with ischemic heart disease: 11. 3 % had mild <b>airflow</b> <b>limitation,</b> 15. 8 % moderate <b>airflow</b> <b>limitation,</b> 3. 3 % severe <b>airflow</b> <b>limitation,</b> and 0. 1 % very severe <b>airflow</b> <b>limitation.</b> Most patients with <b>airflow</b> <b>limitation</b> (70. 6 %) had no previous spirometry testing or diagnosed pulmonary disease. <b>Airflow</b> <b>limitation</b> was associated with greater respiratory symptomatology, impaired health status, and more frequent emergency room visits (P < 0. 05). Conclusions: <b>Airflow</b> <b>limitation</b> compatible with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease affects almost one-third of patients with ischemic heart disease. Although <b>airflow</b> <b>limitation</b> is associated with additional morbidity and societal burden, it is largely undiagnosed and untreated...|$|E
40|$|My work {{focused on}} the {{fabrication}} of superhydrophobic surfaces (SHSs) by deposition of Al 2 O 3 nanoparticles (NPs) and chemical modification with fluoroalkylsilanes (FAS). I synthesized Al 2 O 3 NPs via sol-gel method in water or isopropyl alcohol, assessing {{the differences between the}} suspensions in physicochemical properties and coating effectiveness on different materials. In some cases, the dispersant {{played a role in the}} homogeneity and performance of the coating. I explored two deposition techniques, with dip coating proving more effective than spray coating. After NPs deposition, few thermal treatments were required. I assessed the influence of treatment temperature (T) on the coating, especially for a sensitive material like copper. The crucial step of the process was the immersion in boiling water to form a flower-like boehmite nanostructure. After grafting FAS chains, the surface became superhydrophobic. I characterized the coating in terms of wetting properties (static contact angle CA and contact angle hysteresis CAH) with water and other liquids and it proved superhydrophobic and highly oleophobic. I also assessed coating durability by performing ageing tests in chemically and mechanically aggressive conditions. The coating displayed remarkable resistance, still delivering excellent liquid repellence after the tests. Furthermore, I determined surface morphology with FESEM observations throughout the process, while colleagues at Università La Sapienza investigated the surface chemical composition with XPS analysis and DFT calculations. FAS molecules formed an ordered and stable monolayer on the boehmite coating. Further characterizations concerned coating adhesion to different substrates and roughness. As SHSs have a wide range of potential applications, it is useful to assess their behavior in “dynamic” conditions. For example, the study of single drop impacts is crucial in applications like sprays or ink-jet printers. Thus, I observed the impact of water and hexadecane drops on SHSs with different morphology and chemical composition. Surprisingly, it was not possible to easily correlate wetting properties and drop impact outcome, as surfaces with the same CAs provided different drop impact results. Parameters related to the liquid (velocity, surface tension, viscosity) and to the surface (morphology, roughness and, unexpectedly, chemical composition) played relevant roles in determining impact outcomes. I also studied the drop shedding behavior on the SHSs at different T and relative humidity (RH) conditions. At room T and low RH, a sessile drop could be easily shed by a low-speed airflow. On the other hand, high RH and T < 0 °C strongly hindered shedding, thus requiring much higher airflow speed U to occur. Furthermore, surface roughness proved influent in determining critical U. I also tried to quantify the delay in drop freezing provided by the superhydrophobic coating, but instrumental issues made it difficult to obtain reliable data. Moreover, I measured the evolution of CAH when the surface was kept in high RH environment. An interesting drop in CAH after long condensation times was observed, but further investigations are needed. Finally, I evaluated the anti-friction properties of the coating deposited on pump components. The coating provided a remarkable and long-lasting friction reduction, with positive effects on pump efficiency. In summary, the hybrid, nanostructured coating owned remarkable liquid-repellent properties, due to the combination of flower-like morphology and grafted FAS molecules. The coating displayed excellent durability in a wide spectrum of aggressive environments and proved efficient even in dynamic conditions (e. g. drop impact, drop shedding with <b>airflow).</b> However, <b>limitations</b> appeared in severe conditions like high pH, high RH and freezing T. Future work must be devoted to the optimization of the coating to widen its range of potential applications...|$|R

While work has been done to characterize nighttime (NT) and early morning (EM) symptoms in various populations, the impact and factors associated with NT/EM symptoms among patients with COPD in the United States is not well understood. Commercially insured patients aged ≥ 40 years with one or more medical claim for COPD and one or more pharmacy claim for COPD maintenance medication were identified from the HealthCore Integrated Research Database between September 1, 2010 and August 31, 2011. Consenting respondents were asked whether they had COPD symptoms on at least three nights or at least three mornings during the past week. Respondents were then either assigned to one of three symptom groups to complete the survey or excluded if their predefined group quota limit had been met. Survey completers completed the survey with questions about COPD symptoms and other commonly used patient-reported outcome measures. Respondents with NT/EM symptoms were asked about the frequency, severity, and impact of the symptoms on sleep, morning activities, and anxiety levels. Among respondents with symptoms, 73. 1 % of respondents with NT symptoms (N= 376) and 83 % of respondents with EM symptoms (N= 506) experienced at least three distinct types of symptoms over the past week, with cough being the most frequently reported symptom. Approximately half of respondents with NT or EM symptoms perceived their symptoms as moderate to very severe, with a majority reporting their symptoms affected their NT sleep and morning activities, and more than half felt anxious due to their symptoms. Multinomial logistic regression showed COPD patients with both or either NT/EM symptoms were associated with poorer health status compared to those without. Improved disease management may reduce NT/EM symptoms and improve health status in patients with COPD.

40|$|Odour {{localisation}} is {{the problem}} of finding the source of an odour or other volatile chemical. It promises many valuable practical and humanitarian applications. Most localisation methods require a robot to reactively track an odour plume along its entire length. This approach is time consuming and may be not be possible in a cluttered indoor environment, where airflow tends to form sectors of circulating airflow. Such environments may be encountered in crawl-ways under floors, roof cavities, mines, caves, tree-canopies, air-ducts, sewers or tunnel systems. Operation in these places is important for such applications as search and rescue and locating the sources of toxic chemicals in an industrial setting. This thesis addresses odour localisation in this class of environments. The solution consists of a sense-map-plan-act style control scheme (and low level behaviour based controller) with two main stages. Firstly, the airflow in the environment is modelled using naive physics rules which are encapsulated into an algorithm named a Naive Reasoning Machine. It was used in preference to conventional methods as it is fast, does not require boundary conditions, and most importantly, provides approximate solutions to the degree of accuracy required for the task, with analogical data structures that are readily useful to a reasoning algorithm. Secondly, a reasoning algorithm navigates the robot to specific target locations that are determined with a physical map, the airflow map, and knowledge of odour dispersal. Sensor measurements at the target positions provide information regarding the likelihood that odour was emitted from potential odour source locations. The target positions and their traversal are determined so that all the potential odour source sites are accounted for. The core method provides values corresponding to the confidence that the odour source is located in a given region. A second search stage exploiting vision is then used to locate the specific location of the odour source within the predicted region. This comprises the second part of a bi-modal, two-stage search, with each stage exploiting complementary sensing modalities. Single hypothesis <b>airflow</b> modelling faces <b>limitations</b> {{due to the fact that}} large differences between airflow topologies are predicted for only small variations in a physical map. This is due to uncertainties in the map and approximations in the modelling process. Furthermore, there are uncertainties regarding the flow direction through inlet/outlet ducts. A method is presented for dealing with these uncertainties, by generating multiple airflow hypotheses. As the robot performs odour localisation, airflow in the environment is measured and used to adjust the confidences of the hypotheses using Bayesian inference. The best hypothesis is then selected, which allows the completion of the localisation task. This method improves the robustness of odour localisation in the presence of uncertainties, making it possible where the single hypothesis method would fail. It also demonstrates the potential for integrating naive physics into a statistical framework. Extensive experimental results are presented to support the methods described above...|$|R
