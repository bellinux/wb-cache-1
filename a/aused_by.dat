When senior personnel in Naval aviation are asked the question, "How jch {{time and money}} are we spending on corrosion prevention and correction?" airly accurate estimates can be obtained for the organizational and intersdiate levels of maintenance because they break out these costs in their aintenance data reporting system. It {{is virtually impossible to}} quantify hese same costs at the depot level since their current reporting system ill not allow for the collection of such information. A second problem, <b>aused</b> <b>by</b> this rather limited reporting system, concerns the inability of tie depot level engineering staff to gather sufficient accurate information oout the types, extent, and locations of corrosion that occur on aircraft.

Coordinated of the atoms of B-Ag 2 Se and B-Ag 3 AuSe 2 were obtained from refinements using X-ray powder data. The structures are characterized by three, four and five coordinates of silver by the chalcogen, a linear coordination of gold by Se, and by metal-metal distances only slightly larger than in the metals. The {{band structure}} calculations show that B-Ag 3 AuSe 2 is a semiconductor, while B-Ag 2 Se and B-Ag 2 Te are semimetals with an overlap of about 0. 1 - 0. 2 eV. The Ag 4 d and Au 5 d states are strongly hybridized with the chalcogen p states all over the valence bands. B-Ag 2 Se and B-Ag 2 Te have a very low DOS in the energy range from about - 0. 1 To + 0. 5 eV. The calculated effective mass B-Ag 2 Se is about 0. 1 - 0. 3 Me for electrons and 0. 75 Me for holes, respectively...|$|R
40|$|Overview: Increasing {{concerns}} over the potentially impairing effects of prescriptive sedative drugs such as benzodiazepines on driving have been raised. However, other alternatives such as natural medicines may also carry similar risks with respect to driving safety. Kava (Piper methysticum) is a psychotropic plant commonly used both recreationally and medicinally in the United States, Australia, and the South Pacific to elicit a physically tranquilizing effect. To date no controlled study has tested a medicinal dose of kava versus placebo and a standard sedative drug on driving ability and driving safety. Objective: Due {{to the need to}} establish the safety of kava in operating a motor vehicle, we compared the acute effects of the plant extract versus the benzodiazepine oxazepam and placebo using a driving simulator. Methods: A driving simulator (<b>AusEd)</b> was used <b>by</b> 22 adults aged between 18 and 65 years after being randomly administered an acute medicinal dose of kava (180 mg of kavalactones), oxazepam (30 mg), or placebo one week apart in a crossover design trial. Results: No impairing effects on driving outcomes were found after kava administration compared to placebo. Results on specific driving outcome domains revealed that the oxazepam condition had significantly slower braking reaction time compared to the placebo condition (p =. 002) and the kava condition (p =. 003). The kava condition had significantly fewer lapses of concentration compared to the oxazepam condition (p =. 033). No {{significant differences were found between}} conditions for steering deviation, speed deviation, and number of crashes. Results were not modified by driving experience. On the Bond-Lader visual analogue sub-scale of alertness, a significant Treatment &# 0215; Time interaction (p =. 032) was found, with a significant reduction over time for oxazepam decreasing alertness (p <. 001), whereas no significant reduction was found in the kava or placebo conditions. Conclusion: The results indicate that a medicinal dose of kava containing 180 mg of kavalactones does not impair driving ability, whereas 30 mg of oxazepam shows some impairment. Research assessing larger recreational doses of kava on driving ability should now be conducted...|$|R

40|$|Celangulin V (CV), one of dihydroagarofuran {{sesquiterpene}} polyesters {{isolated from}} Chinese bittersweet (Celastrus angulatus Maxim), is famous natural botanical insecticide. Decades of {{research suggests that}} is displays excellent insecticidal activity against some insects, such as Mythimna separata Walker. Recently, it has been validated that the H subunit of V-ATPase {{is one of the}} target proteins of the insecticidal dihydroagarofuran sesquiterpene polyesters. As a continuation of the development of new pesticides from these natural products, a series of β-dihydroagarofuran derivatives have been designed and synthesized. The compound JW- 3, an insecticidal derivative of CV with a p-fluorobenzyl group, exhibits higher insecticidal activity than CV. In this study, the potential inhibitory effect <b>aused</b> <b>by</b> the interaction of JW- 3 with the H subunit of V-ATPase c was verified by confirmatory experiments at the molecular level. Both spectroscopic techniques and isothermal titration calorimetry measurements showed the binding of JW- 3 to the subunit H of V-ATPase was specific and spontaneous. In addition, the possible mechanism of action of the compound was discussed. Docking results indicated compound JW- 3 could bind well in ‘the interdomain cleft’ of the V-ATPase subunit H by the hydrogen bonding and make conformation of the ligand–protein complex become more stable. All results are the further validations of the hypothesis, that the target protein of insecticidal dihydroagarofuran sesquiterpene polyesters and their β-dihydroagarofuran derivatives is the subunit H of V-ATPase. The results also provide new ideas for developing pesticides acting on V-ATPase of insects...|$|E
40|$|Background: Definition of {{fracture}} {{according to}} Price and Wilson (2006) is a broken bone, usually <b>aused</b> <b>by</b> trauma or physical exertion. Meanwhile, according to Reeves, Roux and Lockhart (2001) each fracture is a crack or fracture {{in the bone}} intact. As for the problem that will arise both {{in the form of}} physical capacity such: the absence of pain in right fingers hand, decrease in range of motion, decrease muscle strength right fingers hand and problem of functional ability. To know how big the problem that arise necessary to check, eg for pain with VDS, decrease in range of motion with goneometer, muscle strength with MMT and functional ability with direct interview. In addressing the issue of exercise modalities can be obtained a reduction of pain, increase range of motion, increase muscle strength and reduced interference for functional activity. Methods: Writing this research uses the case study method with the implementation of therapy six times. Results: The results after treatment carried six times is as follows: silent pain of T 1 = 1 and T 6 = 0, tenderness of T 1 = 4 and T 6 = 2, painful motion of T 1 = 3 and T 6 = 1. ROM Active Metacarpophalangeal T 1 = S: 5 - 0 - 35 be T 6 = S: 15 - 0 - 70. ROM Active Interphalangeal Proximal T 1 = S: 5 - 0 - 70 be T 6 = S: 5 - 0 - 90. For the functional ability of patient has increased proved by patient wrting ability. Conclusion: In reducing the pain and the problems that arise with physiotherapy modalities Exercise therapy can reduce pain and problems experienced by the patient. With the provision of exercise therapy modalities are expected pain, edema, decreased LGS, decreased muscle strength and decreased physical ability and functional capacity can be overcome so that the patient can move back as before...|$|E
40|$|Chlorinated {{aliphatic}} hydrocarbons (CAHs), which {{are among the}} most prev alent groundwater contaminants in the industrialized world, have a large potential to discharge into rivers as contaminated baseflow. This cause s diffuse contamination of the surface water and imposes environmental r isks. However, the fate of the infiltrating groundwater pollutants is in fluenced by the sediment zone in eutrophic rivers where biodegradation o f CAHs may reduce the discharge. The strong reducing conditions that may prevail in such river sediments, the abundance of organic material and the presence of CAHs could provide an ideal environment for halorespirin g bacteria, which yield energy for growth from the reductive dechlorinat ion of CAHs. By transforming the CAHs into their nontoxic end products d uring passage of the groundwater, the river sediment would act as a natu ral biobarrier, protecting the surface water from CAH pollution. This study explored the potential of eutrophic river sediments to attenu ate the infiltration of CAH-polluted groundwater discharging into the ri ver Zenne near Brussels, Belgium. Active biotic reductive dechlorination of CAHs in the sediment was suggested by a high dechlorination activity in batch- and column biodegradation tests performed with sediment sampl es, and by the detection of dechlorination products in sediment pore wat er. Monitoring of CAH concentrations and stable isotope ratios of the CA Hs (d 13 C) and the water (d 2 H and d 18 O), allowed to identify different bi otic and abiotic CAH attenuation processes and to delineate their spatia l distribution in the riverbed. In a 45 by 15 m long stretch of the rive r Zenne, pore water samples were repeatedly collected at 25 locations an d three depths in the riverbed. Microbial reductive dechlorination of th e CAHs was observed at 30 to 40 % of the investigated locations and there fore appeared the most widespread CAH attenuation process in the Zenne r iverbed, followed by dilution by surface water-mixing and unpolluted gro undwater discharge. The distribution of those processes proved to be spa tially and temporally heterogeneous. Analysis of pore water samples from stationary sampling devices, installed at three locations in the Zenne riverbed, revealed that the extent of biodegradation from 120 to 20 cm d epth in the riverbed, measured by the increase in d 13 C of the CAHs, rema ined rather constant over time. At those locations, the observed decreas e in the pore water CAH concentrations during vertical discharge of the CAH-polluted groundwater from 120 to 20 cm depth in the sediments, was c <b>aused</b> <b>by</b> a combination of biodegradation and dilution by infiltrating su rface water. The relative contribution of those two processes to the obs erved CAH attenuation varied both spatially and temporally in the Zenne riverbed. Since dilution by surface-water mixing, which is criticized as a natural attenuation process, occasionally contributed to the observed concentration decrease to a larger extent than biodegradation, this cou ld affect acceptance of the Zenne as a natural biobarrier. Bacteria from the genus Dehalococcoides, known for their CAH dechlorinat ion capacity, were detected in Zenne sediments from all investigated riv erbed locations and depths within the test area. Since these species wer e enriched in river sediment columns that actively degraded the CAHs, th ese bacteria were probably associated with the reductive dechlorination activity in the Zenne sediments. The detection of genes related to bvcA and vcrA, encoding the vinyl chloride reductive dehalogenase enzymes in Dehalococcoides, strengthened this hypothesis. Their detection implies t hat energy for growth is recovered from the degradation of the main grou ndwater pollutants discharging into the Zenne, i. e. cis-dichloroethene (cis-DCE) and vinyl chloride (VC), to nontoxic ethene. By using DGGE-fing erprint analysis of relevant nucleic acid markers, it was shown that the Zenne river sediments were inhabited by a metabolically diverse bacteri al community. A large diversity of sulfate-reducing bacteria, Geobactera ceae and methanogens, which potentially compete with halorespiring bacte ria for electron resources, was identified. The high organic carbon leve l {{in the top of the}} riverbed, originating from organic matter deposition from the eutrophic surface water, resulted in a homogeneous microbial c ommunity structure that differed from the microbial community structure of the sediment underneath this layer. Continuous tests performed with Zenne sediments or aquifer collected wit hin the CAH plume adjacent to the river demonstrated that the Zenne sedi ments have a higher CAH reductive dechlorination potential than the poll uted aquifer. While reductive dechlorination of the CAHs to their non-to xic end products continuously occurred in all columns containing river s ediments, biodegradation of CAHs was never observed in the aquifer colum ns. Furthermore, results of the column tests indicated that CAH biodegra dation in the riverbed is affected by the groundwater residence time and the presence of co-contaminants. Whereas 21 µM VC, 3 µM cis-D CE and 0. 37 µM 1, 1 -dichloroethane (1, 1 -DCA) were totally removed fr om the groundwater at a pore water velocity of 2. 7 and 5. 4 cm/day, those CAHs reached the top of the approximately 1 m long sediment layer in th e columns at a pore water velocity of 9. 2 cm/day. Biodegradation of 1, 1 - DCA was inhibited by the presence of cis-DCE and VC and therefore only o ccurred at heights in the river sediment columns where cis-DCE and VC we re partially reduced. Although CAHs were never detected in the surface water, 26 to 28 % of the investigated locations in the riverbed did not show CAH attenuation. Mo reover, CAHs were not completely removed from the discharging groundwate r at 20 cm depth in the riverbed in 67 to 70 % of the remaining riverbed locations. Although attenuation processes in the top 20 cm of the riverb ed could further remove residual CAH, our data suggest that CAHs reached the surface water at certain locations in the studied riverbed section. Therefore, it was concluded that an increase in the extent of biodegrad ation in the riverbed is needed for acceptance of the Zenne biobarrier a s a viable remedial option for attenuation of discharging CAH-polluted g roundwater. Since the moderate extent of biodegradation of the CAHs in t he riverbed, despite the presence and activity of halorespiring bacteria and apparently ideal conditions for reductive dechlorination, was possi bly due to a low residence time of the CAHs in the Zenne sediments, an i ncrease in the groundwater residence time in the riverbed could improve the Zenne biobarrier efficiency. status: publishe...|$|E
