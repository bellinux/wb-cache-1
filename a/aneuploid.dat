25|$|The {{main problem}} {{of the use of}} FISH to study the {{chromosomal}} constitution of embryos is the elevated mosaicism rate observed at the human preimplantation stage. A meta-analysis of more than 800 embryos came to the result that approximately 75% of preimplantation embryos are mosaic, of which approximately 60% are diploid–aneuploid mosaic and approximately 15% <b>aneuploid</b> mosaic. Li and co-workers found that 40% of the embryos diagnosed as <b>aneuploid</b> on day 3 turned out to have a euploid inner cell mass at day 6. Staessen and collaborators found that 17.5% of the embryos diagnosed as abnormal during PGS, and subjected to post-PGD reanalysis, were found to also contain normal cells, and 8.4% were found grossly normal. As a consequence, it has been questioned whether the one or two cells studied from an embryo are actually representative of the complete embryo, and whether viable embryos are not being discarded due to the limitations of the technique.|$|E
40|$|Triploids {{have become}} an {{important}} part of the oyster aquaculture industry. Triploids can be.. produced by two methods: 1 inhibiting polar body II in normal zygotes; and 2 mating diploids and tetraploids. Both methods can theoretically generate some incidental <b>aneuploids,</b> which in higher animals are often lethal or associated with growth retardation. In this study, we investigated. the occurrence of <b>aneuploids</b> in three replicates of a normal diploid group 2 N, a cytochalasin B. induced triploid 3 nCB and a mated triploid group from diploid female = tetraploid male mating. 3 nDT, and documented their growth performance. No <b>aneuploids</b> were found in normal diploid groups, and all diploid oysters had exactly the expected diploid number y 20 chromosomes. Two.. of the 90 oysters 2. 2 % from 3 nCB groups were aneuploids: one with 19 chromosomes 2 ny 1.. and one with 29 chromosomes 3 ny 1.

The large numbers of <b>aneuploids</b> from 3 nDT groups suggested that meiosis in paternal tetraploids was prone to segregation error. Triploids from 3 nDT groups were significantly bigger than normal diploids and 3 nCB triploids. <b>Aneuploids</b> were not significantly different from 3 nDT triploids in body size.

40|$|All {{previous}} {{attempts to}} produce viable tetraploid pearl oyster (Pinctada martensii Dunker) by inhibiting the first polar {{body and the}} first mitosis have failed. This study aims to test the possibility of producing viable tetraploids by the intentional process of crossing triploid females and diploid males following the inhibition of the first polar body. When 0. 5 mg/L CB was applied to inhibit {{the release of the}} first polar body, about 16. 69 % of embryos developed as tetraploids, the majority of embryos were <b>aneuploids</b> (65. 48 %); about 82 % embryos developed as <b>aneuploids</b> in the control group (TD 1), but no tetraploid embryos were found. Ploidy of embryos in the TD 1 group mainly fell between 2 n and 3 n, bur ranged from 2 n to 5 n in the TDCB group. During rearing period, larvae died heavily. At Day 51 post-fertilization, 2125 spat were harvested, averaging 0. 033 % of D-larvae cultured. Chromosome analysis revealed that 115 one-year-old pearl oysters consisted of 28. 70 % diploids (n = 33), 40. 87 % triploids (n = 47), 1. 74 % tetraploids (n = 2) and 28. 70 % <b>aneuploids</b> (n = 33) with 29, 30, 40, 41, and 43 chromosomes. Comparison of growth showed that <b>aneuploids</b> was not significantly different from diploids in both shell length and body weight (P > 0. 1), but significantly smaller than triploids (P < 0. 05). This study demonstrated that the production of viable tetraploid pearl oysters with eggs from triploids is possible, and certain levels of aneuploidy can be tolerated in this species...|$|R

25|$|Somatic mosaicism {{occurs in}} {{virtually}} all cancer cells, including trisomy 12 in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and trisomy 8 in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, these forms of mosaic aneuploidy occur through mechanisms distinct from those typically associated with genetic syndromes involving complete or mosaic aneuploidy, such as chromosomal instability (due to mitotic segregation defects in cancer cells). Therefore, the molecular processes that lead to aneuploidy are targets {{for the development of}} cancer drugs. Both resveratrol and aspirin have been found in vivo (in mice) to selectively destroy tetraploid cells that may be precursors of <b>aneuploid</b> cells, and activate AMPK, which may be involved in the process.|$|E
25|$|Canine {{transmissible}} venereal {{tumors are}} histiocytic tumors {{that may be}} transmitted among dogs through coitus, licking, biting and sniffing tumor affected areas. The concept that the tumor is naturally transmissible as an allograft came from three important observations. First, CTVTs can only be experimentally induced by transplanting living tumor cells, and not by killed cells or cell filtrates. Second, the tumor karyotype is <b>aneuploid</b> but has characteristic marker chromosomes in all tumors collected in different geographic regions. Third, a {{long interspersed nuclear element}} (LINE-1) insertion near c-myc has been found in all tumors examined so far and {{can be used as a}} diagnostic marker to confirm that a tumor is a CTVT.|$|E

Shotgun sequencing can be done with a Solexa/Illumina platform. Whole fetal genome mapping by parental haplotype analysis using sequencing of cell free fetal DNA was done in 2010. Chiu et al. in 2010 studied 753 pregnant females, using a 2-plex massively parallel maternal plasma DNA sequencing and trisomy was diagnosed with z-score greater than 3.

40|$|The Triplo-lethal locus (Tpl) of Drosophila is both triplo-lethal and haploinsufficient, but the {{function}} of the locus is unknown. We have examined Tpl-aneuploid embryos and find that, in both trisomics and monosomics, the midgut shows extensive cell death and the tracheae are abnormal. Shortly thereafter, all tissues die. PCR-based genotyping of individual embryos and larvae show that this phenotype occurs in the trisomics after hatching and in the monosomics before hatching. Weak alleles of the interacting gene Su(Tpl) delay the death of Tpl trisomics, but they still show the same tracheal and midgut phenotypes before dying. Hyperoxia (45 % oxygen) partially suppresses the phenotype of Tpl <b>aneuploids,</b> even though the use of a hypoxia reporter strain shows that dying Tpl <b>aneuploids</b> are not hypoxic.

25|$|Polysomy is a {{condition}} found in many species, including fungi, plants, insects, and mammals, in which an organism {{has at least one}} more chromosome than normal, i.e., there may be three or more copies of the chromosome rather than the expected two copies. Most eukaryotic species are diploid, meaning they have two sets of chromosomes, whereas prokaryotes are haploid, containing a single chromosome in each cell. Aneuploids possess chromosome numbers that are not exact multiples of the haploid number and polysomy is a type of aneuploidy. A karyotype is the set of chromosomes in an organism and the suffix -somy is used to name <b>aneuploid</b> karyotypes. This is {{not to be confused with}} the suffix -ploidy, referring to the number of complete sets of chromosomes.|$|E
25|$|In {{the case}} of FISH, in some centres only embryos are {{replaced}} that {{are found to be}} chromosomally normal (that is, showing two signals for the gonosomes and the analysed autosomes) after the analysis of one or two blastomeres, and when two blastomeres are analysed, the results should be concordant. Other centres argue that embryos diagnosed as monosomic could be transferred, because the false monosomy (i.e. loss of one FISH signal in a normal dipoloid cell) is the most frequently occurring misdiagnosis. In these cases, there is no risk for an <b>aneuploid</b> pregnancy, and normal diploid embryos are not lost for transfer because of a FISH error. Moreover, {{it has been shown that}} embryos diagnosed as monosomic on day 3 (except for chromosomes X and 21), never develop to blastocyst, which correlates with the fact that these monosomies are never observed in ongoing pregnancies.|$|E
25|$|Autopolyploids possess {{at least}} three {{homologous}} chromosome sets, {{which can lead to}} high rates of multivalent pairing during meiosis (particularly in recently formed autopolyploids, a.k.a. neopolyploids) and an associated decrease in fertility due to the production of <b>aneuploid</b> gametes. Natural or artificial selection for fertility can quickly stabilize meiosis in autopolyploids by restoring bivalent pairing during meiosis, but the high degree of homology among duplicated chromosomes causes autopolyploids to display polysomic inheritance. This trait is often used as a diagnostic criterion to distinguish autopolyploids from allopolyploids, which commonly display disomic inheritance after they progress past the neopolyploid stage. While most polyploid species are unambiguously characterized as either autopolyploid or allopolyploid, these categories represent the ends of a spectrum between of divergence between parental subgenomes. Polyploids that fall between these two extremes, which are often referred to as segmental allopolyploids, may display intermediate levels of polysomic inheritance that vary by locus.|$|E
40|$|Breeding {{programs}} {{aiming at}} transferring desirable genes from one species to another through interspecific hybridization and backcrossings often produce monosomic and disomic additions as intermediate crossing products. Such <b>aneuploids</b> contain alien chromosomes {{added to the}} complements of the recipient parent {{and can be used}} for further introgression programs, but lack of homoeologous recombination and inevitable segregation of the alien chromosome at meiosis make them often less ideal for producing stable introgression lines. Monosomic and disomic additions can have specific morphological characteristics, but more often they need additional confirmation of molecular marker analyses and assessment by fluorescence in situ hybridization with genomic and chromosome-specific DNA as probes. Their specific genetic and cytogenetic properties make them powerful tools for fundamental research elucidating regulation of homoeologous recombination, distribution of chromosome-specific markers and repetitive DNA sequences, and regulation of heterologous gene expression.

25|$|Aneuploidy, {{which refers}} to {{abnormal}} number of chromosomes, can also be detected using non-invasive prenatal tests. Research previous shown an increase in quantity of cffDNA in maternal plasma for fetal trisomy 13 and trisomy 21, {{and it is not}} elevated in fetal trisomy 18. A number of fetal nucleic acid molecules derived from <b>aneuploid</b> chromosomes can be detected including SERPINEB2 mRNA, clad B, hypomethylated SERPINB5 from chromosome 18, placenta-specific 4 (PLAC4), hypermethylated holocarboxylase synthetase (HLCS) and c21orf105 mRNA from chromosome 12. With complete trisomy, the mRNA alleles in maternal plasma isn't the normal 1:1 ratio, but is in fact 2:1. Allelic ratios determined by epigenetic markers {{can also be used to}} detect the complete trisomies. Massive parallel sequencing and digital PCR for fetal aneuploidy detection can be used without restriction to fetal-specific nucleic acid molecules. Several cell-free fetal DNA and RNA technologies are under development to test a pregnancy for aneuploidy, mostly focusing on Down syndrome testing. Sampling of cffDNA from maternal blood for analysis by massively parallel sequencing (MPSS) is estimated to have a sensitivity of between 96 and 100%, and a specificity between 94 and 100% for detecting Down syndrome. It can be performed at 10 weeks of gestational age. One study in the United States estimated a false positive rate of 0.3% and a positive predictive value of 80% when using cffDNA to detect Down syndrome.|$|E

Embryogenic cultures were induced from expanding leaves cultured in the presence of Picloram or 2, 4 -dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2, 4 -D) and monthly subcultured on the same media. Embryo development and plantlets were obtained following subculture of the embryogenic tissue in auxin free medium containing gibberellic acid (GA 3). Seedlings and rooted shoots from axillary shoot proliferation were used as controls. The results showed that in long-term embryogenic cultures the ability to develop somatic embryos and plantlets was reduced. Embryogenic tissues maintained for 10 years were mostly <b>aneuploids</b> of the tetraploid (2 n = 4 x = 48) level whereas those kept in culture for 7 years or less were also mostly <b>aneuploids</b> but of the diploid (2 n = 2 x = 24) level.

The chromosome alteration observed in the embryogenic tissues was already present after 1 year of culture and increased with culture age, hence impairing the maintenance of these tissues for long periods without affecting chromosome stability of the regenerated plantlets.

The Malus genome confirmed that this genus was derived through auto-polyploidization, yet the genetic and meiotic mechanisms for polyploidization, particularly for aneuploidization, are unclear in this genus or other woody perennials. In fact the contribution of aneuploidization remains poorly understood throughout Plantae. We add to this knowledge by characterization of eupolyploidization and aneuploidization in 27, 542 F 1 seedlings from seven diploid Malus populations using cytology and microsatellite markers. We provide the first evidence that aneuploidy exceeds eupolyploidy in the diploid crosses, suggesting aneuploidization is a leading cause of genome duplication. Gametes from diploid Malus had a unique combinational pattern; ova preserved euploidy exclusively, while spermatozoa presented both euploidy and aneuploidy. All non-reduced gametes were genetically heterozygous, indicating first-division restitution was the exclusive mode for Malus eupolyploidization and aneuploidization. Chromosome segregation pattern among <b>aneuploids</b> was non-uniform, however, certain chromosomes were associated for aneuploidization.
