5|$|Gout affects around 1–2% of the Western {{population}} {{at some point}} in their lifetimes and is becoming more common. Some 5.8 million people were affected in 2013. Rates of gout approximately doubled between 1990 and 2010. This rise is believed to be due to increasing life expectancy, changes in diet and an increase in diseases associated with gout, such as metabolic syndrome <b>and</b> <b>high</b> <b>blood</b> <b>pressure.</b> Factors that influence rates of gout, include age, race and the season of the year. In men over 30 and women over 50, rates are 2%.|$|E
5|$|In 1951, Djajakusuma {{joined the}} National Film Corporation (Perfini) at the {{invitation}} of Usmar Ismail. After making his directorial debut with Embun, Djajakusuma released a further eleven films with the company before leaving in 1964. He then returned to traditional Indonesian theatre, including wayang. Although he continued to direct movies independently of Perfini, most of his energies were dedicated to promoting traditional art forms and teaching cinematography. After over a decade of poor health <b>and</b> <b>high</b> <b>blood</b> <b>pressure,</b> Djajakusuma collapsed during a ceremony and died. He was buried in Karet Bivak Cemetery.|$|E
5|$|Nasser {{engaged in}} chain smoking. He {{maintained}} 18-hour workdays and rarely took {{time off for}} vacations. The combination of smoking and working long hours contributed to his poor health. He was diagnosed with diabetes in the early 1960s {{and by the time}} of his death in 1970, he also had arteriosclerosis, heart disease, <b>and</b> <b>high</b> <b>blood</b> <b>pressure.</b> He suffered two major heart attacks (in 1966 and 1969), and was on bed rest for six weeks after the second episode.

50|$|Subjects of Whitehall II in {{the lowest}} {{employment}} grades {{were more likely to}} have many of the established risk factors of coronary heart disease (CHD): a propensity to smoke, lower height-to-weight ratio, less leisure time, <b>and</b> <b>higher</b> <b>blood</b> <b>pressure.</b> However, even after normalizing for these factors, the lower employment grades were still at greater risk for a heart attack; another factor was at work.|$|R
5|$|Of the 40% of {{patients}} who develop kidney involvement, almost all have evidence (visible or on urinalysis) {{of blood in the}} urine. More than half also have proteinuria (protein in the urine), which in one eighth is severe enough to cause nephrotic syndrome (generalised swelling due to low protein content of the blood). While abnormalities on urinalysis may continue for a long time, only 1% of all HSP patients develop chronic kidney disease. Hypertension (high blood pressure) may occur. Protein loss <b>and</b> <b>high</b> <b>blood</b> <b>pressure,</b> as well as the features on biopsy of the kidney if performed, may predict progression to advanced kidney disease. Adults are more likely than children to develop advanced kidney disease.|$|E
5|$|In adults, {{occupational}} exposure {{is the main}} cause of lead poisoning. People can be exposed when working in facilities that produce a variety of lead-containing products; these include radiation shields, ammunition, certain surgical equipment, developing dental x-ray films prior to digital x-rays (each film packet had a lead liner to prevent the radiation from going through), fetal monitors, plumbing, circuit boards, jet engines, and ceramic glazes. In addition, lead miners and smelters, plumbers and fitters, auto mechanics, glass manufacturers, construction workers, battery manufacturers and recyclers, firing range instructors, and plastic manufacturers are at risk for lead exposure. Other occupations that present lead exposure risks include welding, manufacture of rubber, printing, zinc and copper smelting, processing of ore, combustion of solid waste, and production of paints and pigments. Parents who are exposed to lead in the workplace can bring lead dust home on clothes or skin and expose their children. Occupational exposure to lead increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, in particular: stroke, <b>and</b> <b>high</b> <b>blood</b> <b>pressure.</b>|$|E

5000|$|The {{cause of}} the {{cardiovascular}} problems became, and remains, a subject of intensive research. [...] As of 2012 results have been converging on {{the hypothesis that the}} adverse cardiovascular effects are most likely due to inhibition of COX-2 in blood vessels, which leads to a decrease in the production of prostacyclin in them. Prostacyclin usually prevents platelet aggregation and vasoconstriction, so its inhibition can lead to excess clot formation <b>and</b> <b>higher</b> <b>blood</b> <b>pressure.</b>|$|R

40|$|When {{asking the}} {{question}} “What determines health? ” {{it is important to}} note that social factors can be powerful determinants of health status.

The patients were randomized into two equal groups of 30 patients each: group A received wound infiltration with a solution containing 0.5 % bupivacaine (2  mg/kg) and group B received infiltration with a solution containing fentanyl 25  μg added to 0.5 % bupivacaine (2  mg/kg).

25|$|Metolazone is a thiazide-like {{diuretic}} marketed {{under the}} brand names Zytanix from Zydus Cadila, Zaroxolyn, and Mykrox. It is primarily {{used to treat}} congestive heart failure <b>and</b> <b>high</b> <b>blood</b> <b>pressure.</b> Metolazone indirectly decreases {{the amount of water}} reabsorbed into the bloodstream by the kidney, so that blood volume decreases and urine volume increases.
