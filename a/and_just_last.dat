The new away kit is all blue with single black stripes along the shoulders and the new Champions League away kit is electric yellow with the red and blue vertical stripe, along with single red and blue stripes on the shoulders. The team's alternate away kit consists of the home shirt with red shorts and white socks. It is only worn when Lyon are unable to wear their white shorts in an away tie due to the designated home team wearing white shorts.|$|E

This traumatic event contaminated various animals including cows, pigs, chickens, and sheep with a flame-retardant product. when a dock worker accidentally shipped 500 pounds of Fire Master instead of the feed supplement called Nutrimaster. Shortly after this happened, the farmers noticed deformities and sickness among their livestock {{as well as the}} newborn calves. Many had no idea why this happened. Because of this mistake, more than 35,000 cows were contaminated and destroyed. Out of these 35,000 cows, 1,300 were dumped into a clay lined pit in Mio, in Oscoda county. This event {{had a profound effect on}} the people of Mio since they raised the cattle themselves. The people just want to forget about this incident, however thirty years later, the PBB is still showing up in the blood results of people in this area. “PBB was eventually banned by most industrial nations <b>and</b> <b>just</b> <b>last</b> year, the world health organization’s cancer research agency upgraded PBBs from “possibly” to “probably” carcinogenic to humans.”  Joe Higgins, a 44-year-old milk truck driver still worries about the PBB levels in his body even though no health issues have posed any threat.|$|E

40|$|The use of {{diazonium}} salts for {{aryl radical}} generation and C-H arylation processes {{has been known}} since 1896 when Pschorr first used the reaction for intramolecular cyclizations. Meerwein developed it further in the early 1900 s into a general arylation method. However, this reaction could not compete with the transition-metal-mediated formation of C(sp 2) -C(sp 2) bonds. The replacement of the copper catalyst with iron and titanium compounds improved the situation, {{but the use of}} photocatalysis to induce the one-electron reduction and activation of the diazonium salts is even more advantageous. The first photocatalyzed Pschorr cyclization was published in 1984, <b>and</b> <b>just</b> <b>last</b> year a series of papers described applications of photocatalytic Meerwein arylations leading to aryl-alkene coupling products.

40|$|This year {{marks the}} eightieth {{anniversary of the}} first edition of Francis Cornford 2 ̆ 7 s The Origin of Attic Comedy, a book that sought the origins and essence of Old Comedy in 2 ̆ 2 {{primitive}} 2 ̆ 2 ritual, cult, and myth. The sub-title of Bowie 2 ̆ 7 s book on Aristophanes might lead one to expect that he is continuing the project begun by Cornford, and the fact that Cambridge has published both books, even if a mere coincidence, also invites comparison between the two. It is likewise noteworthy that Bowie 2 ̆ 7 s book appears at a time when Cornford 2 ̆ 7 s work, long repudiated and ridiculed by classicists, has undergone something of a rehabilitation in certain circles. Kenneth Reckford, for example, offered a judicious and generous reappraisal of Cornford 2 ̆ 7 s approach in his 1987 study of Aristophanes (Aristophanes 2 ̆ 7 Old-and-New Comedy, Chapel Hill), <b>and</b> <b>just</b> <b>last</b> year Michigan reprinted Cornford 2 ̆ 7 s book, with a useful assessment of its reception in twentieth-century scholarship by Jeffrey Henderson...|$|E

In this work we used six durum wheat varieties usually planted in Portugal (Celta, Hélvio, Marialva, Don Duro, Saragolla and Severo), with the purpose of studying their genomic variability, using PCR-based molecular techniques. Our results indicate that, although being reproduced by self-fertilization, durum wheat’s varieties still show some genomic variability, not only among different varieties, but also between individuals from the same variety. We have also showed that, even though being commercial varieties, not all of them appear to have dough with superior end use quality. This variability can help us develop specific primers to easily distinguish different varieties, and aid in the identification and characterization of varieties with better quality trait...|$|E

In a recent string of cases, the Court has refined and narrowed Section 52 ̆ 7 s enforcement power in two significant ways. 1 First, the Court made clear that Congress lacks the authority to interpret the scope of the Fourteenth Amendment 2 ̆ 7 s substantive provisions themselves, and may only 2 ̆ 2 enforce 2 ̆ 2 the judiciary 2 ̆ 7 s definition of Fourteenth Amendment violations. 2 Second, the Court embraced a relatively stringent requirement concerning the relationship between means and ends, ruling that 2 ̆ 2 [t]here must be a congruence and proportionality between the injury to be prevented or remedied and the means adopted to that end. 2 ̆ 23 Within the past three years, the Court has applied these standards governing Congress 2 ̆ 7 s Section 5 enforcement to the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, 4 the Patent and Plant Variety Protection Remedy Clarification Act, 5 and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act. 6 <b>And</b> <b>just</b> <b>last</b> month, the Court applied these same standards to invalidate the Violence Against Women Act in United States v.

40|$|Quantized {{vortices}} is a well-know {{signature of}} superfluidity. They {{have been studied}} extensively in superfluid Helium, type-II superconductors, Bose Einstein condensates and more recently in Fermi gas. We will discuss some mathematical analysis and numerical simulations of the quantized vortex nucleations in superconductors and Bose-Einstein condensates and discuss their connections and similarities. 1 Quantized Vortices Quantized vortex, a signatures of superfluidity, is a fascinating subject that has been studied first in liquid Helium and in superconductors, then nearly a decade ago in Bose-Einstein condensates (as part of the 2001 Nobel prize winning works of Cornell, Wieman and Ketterle) <b>and</b> <b>just</b> <b>last</b> couple years in Fermi gas. They serve as good examples of manifestly quantum-mechanical behavior of matter being demonstrated on a macroscopic scale. In a superconductor, vortices may be thought as co-dimension 2 defects where the applied magnetic field penetrates the sample. In BEC, vortices are normal cores where the superfluid condensate component is depleted. The interactions and dynamics of vortices {{are important to the}} understanding and application of superconductivity and superfluidity. Pinning of vortices is considered to be crucial in various technological applications of superconductors. Theo-retical works in this exciting research area are highlighted by the 2003 Nobel Prize to Ginzburg, Abrikosov and Leggett who made decisive contributions {{to the understanding of the}} quantized vortex state...|$|E

In fear of political turmoil, world leaders have been calling for more food aid, as well as for more funds and technology to boost agricultural production. Cereal exporting countries, meanwhile, are closing their borders to protect their domestic markets, while other countries have been forced into panic buying. Is this a price blip? No. A food shortage? Not that either. We are in a structural meltdown, the direct result of three decades of neoliberal globalisation.
