5|$|The line closure that {{followed}} the initial service suspension saw most Virgin services terminate at Preston or Lancaster from the south, with buses to Carlisle and all stations along the route. The only exception was an early-morning and late-evening through service from Carlisle to London and return. This was diesel-hauled via Blackburn <b>and</b> <b>Settle.</b> There were also several non-stop trains from Preston to London Euston. Local services all terminated short but many {{were able to make}} their journeys as their destinations were off branches. The Caledonian Sleeper was diverted via the East Coast Main Line, along with freight services, although some were diesel-hauled via Blackburn <b>and</b> <b>Settle.</b>|$|E

5|$|Using a Magyar {{invasion}} in {{the lands of}} the neighbouring Slavs in 896 as a casus belli, Simeon headed against the Magyars together with his Pecheneg allies, defeating them completely in the Battle of Southern Buh and making them leave Etelköz forever <b>and</b> <b>settle</b> in Pannonia.

5|$|As a result, {{the gods}} and goddesses meet and hold a thing to discuss and debate the matter. At the thing, the god Heimdallr puts forth the {{suggestion}} that, in place of Freyja, Thor should be dressed as the bride, complete with jewels, women's clothing down to his knees, a bridal head-dress, and the necklace Brísingamen. Thor rejects the idea, yet Loki interjects {{that this will be}} the only way to get back Mjöllnir. Loki points out that, without Mjöllnir, the jötnar will be able to invade <b>and</b> <b>settle</b> in Asgard. The gods dress Thor as a bride, and Loki states that he will go with Thor as his maid, and that the two shall drive to Jötunheimr together.|$|E

5|$|As the League developed, {{its role}} expanded, {{and by the}} middle of the 1920s it had become the centre of {{international}} activity. This change can be seen in the relationship between the League and non-members. The United States and Russia, for example, increasingly worked with the League. During the second half of the 1920s, France, Britain and Germany were all using the League of Nations as the focus of their diplomatic activity, and each of their foreign secretaries attended League meetings at Geneva during this period. They also used the League's machinery to try to improve relations <b>and</b> <b>settle</b> their differences.|$|E
5|$|Continuing to emphasise good {{relations}} with the white settlers, in August 1963 Kenyatta met with 300 white farmers at Nakuru. He reassured them that they would be safe and welcome in an independent Kenya, and more broadly talked of forgiving and forgetting the conflicts of the past. Despite his attempts at wooing white support, he did not do the same with the Indian minority. Like many indigenous Africans in Kenya, Kenyatta bore a sense of resentment towards this community, despite the role that many Indians had played in securing the country's independence. He also encouraged the remaining Mau Mau fighters to leave the forests <b>and</b> <b>settle</b> in society. However, throughout Kenyatta's rule, many of these individuals would remain unemployed, with unemployment being one of the most persistent problems facing his government.|$|E

He lived in Goshen for many years, owning a farm, marrying Anna Norton in 1783 and raising the oldest seven of their nine children there. In 1789, Hudson joined a group to purchase a parcel of land in the Connecticut Western Reserve. The following year, he left Goshen to survey the parcel <b>and</b> <b>settle</b> it as Hudson Township. Hudson traveled through the state of New York, west along Lake Erie and south along the Cuyahoga River to reach his land.|$|E

British journalist Thomas de Waal has described Ring as the Soviet Union's first and only civil war. Some authors have also described the actions of the joint Soviet and Azerbaijani force as ethnic cleansing. The military operation was accompanied by systematic and gross human rights abuses.|$|E
5|$|In 1949, {{after years}} out of the limelight, Larwood was elected to honorary {{membership}} of the MCC. The following year {{he and his family}} were encouraged by former opponent Jack Fingleton to emigrate <b>and</b> <b>settle</b> in Australia, where he was warmly welcomed, in contrast to the reception accorded him in his cricketing days. He worked for a soft drinks firm, and as an occasional reporter and commentator on Tests against visiting England sides. He paid several visits to England, and was honoured at his old county ground, Trent Bridge, where a stand was named after him. In 1993, at the age of 88, he was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in belated recognition of his services to cricket. He died two years later.|$|E

5|$|Noctilucent {{clouds are}} known to exhibit high radar reflectivity, in a {{frequency}} range of 50MHz to 1.3GHz. This behaviour is not well understood but a {{possible explanation is that}} the ice grains become coated with a thin metal film composed of sodium and iron, which makes the cloud far more reflective to radar, although this explanation remains controversial. Sodium and iron atoms are stripped from incoming micrometeors <b>and</b> <b>settle</b> into a layer just above the altitude of noctilucent clouds, and measurements have shown that these elements are severely depleted when the clouds are present. Other experiments have demonstrated that, at the extremely cold temperatures of a noctilucent cloud, sodium vapour can rapidly be deposited onto an ice surface.|$|E
5|$|Regardless of the titles, Odaenathus {{controlled}} the Roman East {{with the approval}} of Gallienus who could do little but to formalize Odaenathus self achieved status <b>and</b> <b>settle</b> for his formal loyalty. Palmyra itself, although officially still part of the Roman empire, became a de facto allied state to Rome instead of a provincial city. Outside of Palmyra, Odaenathus' authority extended from the Pontic coast in the north to Palestine in the south. This area included the Roman provinces of Syria, Phoenice, Palaestina, Arabia, Anatolia's eastern regions and later (following the campaign of 262) Osroene and Mesopotamia.|$|E

5|$|Several {{other teams}} either had similar {{knowledge}} or had pursued Bure, {{but there was}} confusion as to {{the legitimacy of the}} extra games. The Detroit Red Wings had asked league vice president Gil Stein about Bure's availability before their fifth-round pick, but were told he was not eligible. They later decided to select him with their sixth-round pick, 116th overall, <b>and</b> <b>settle</b> his eligibility later. The Canucks selected Bure three picks ahead of Detroit's turn. Meanwhile, Winnipeg Jets general manager Mike Smith, claimed he made an offer to the Soviet Ice Hockey Federation that would involve three years of transfer payments before Bure would be allowed to join the Jets; however Smith did not have any plans to draft Bure in 1989 as he believed he was ineligible.|$|E
5|$|The Latin {{presence}} in the Balkans seriously undermined the Byzantines' ability to coordinate their efforts against the Ottoman Turks. This is exemplified by Michael VIII Palaeologus, whose attempts to drive the Latins out of Greece led to the abandonment of the Anatolian borders which allowed several beyliks, {{as well as the}} Turks of Osman I to raid <b>and</b> <b>settle</b> former Byzantine lands. Andronicus II's campaigns in Anatolia, though it obtained some military success, was constantly thwarted by events in the west of the Empire. In any event, the Byzantines were forced to choose between Papal and Latin threat of attack or an unpopular union, which was exploited by numerous rival claimants as cause for a coup against the Byzantine Emperor.|$|E
5|$|The World Before the Flood is an oil {{painting}} on canvas by English artist William Etty, first exhibited in 1828 and {{currently in the}} Southampton City Art Gallery.

The painting illustrates the stages of courtship as described by Milton; {{a group of men}} select wives from a group of dancing women, drag their chosen woman from the group, <b>and</b> <b>settle</b> down to married life. Behind the courting group, an oncoming storm looms, a symbol of the destruction which the dancers and lovers are about to bring upon themselves.|$|E
