5|$|Amateur astronomers {{continue}} to make scientific contributions {{to the field of}} astronomy and {{it is one of the}} few scientific disciplines where amateurs can still make significant contributions. Amateurs can make occultation measurements that are used to refine the orbits of minor planets. They can also discover comets, and perform regular observations of variable stars. Improvements in digital technology have allowed amateurs to make impressive advances in the field of <b>astrophotography.</b>|$|E
5|$|One hundred asteroids {{had been}} located by mid-1868, and in 1891 the {{introduction}} of <b>astrophotography</b> by Max Wolf accelerated the rate of discovery still further. A total of 1,000 asteroids had been found by 1921, 10,000 by 1981, and 100,000 by 2000. Modern asteroid survey systems now use automated means to locate new minor planets in ever-increasing quantities.|$|E
5|$|Collectively, {{amateur astronomers}} observe {{a variety of}} {{celestial}} objects and phenomena sometimes with equipment that they build themselves. Common targets of amateur astronomers include the Sun, the Moon, planets, stars, comets, meteor showers, {{and a variety of}} deep-sky objects such as star clusters, galaxies, and nebulae. Astronomy clubs are located throughout the world and many have programs to help their members set up and complete observational programs including those to observe all the objects in the Messier (110 objects) or Herschel 400 catalogues of points of interest in the night sky. One branch of amateur astronomy, amateur <b>astrophotography,</b> involves the taking of photos of the night sky. Many amateurs like to specialize in the observation of particular objects, types of objects, or types of events which interest them.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to these natural factors, much has been done intentionally to make the skies at the park clear and dark and help keep them that way. Within the park, former overhead electrical lines have been buried so they do not obstruct views, all lighting is shielded, and all white lights have been converted to red, which has the least effect on night vision and <b>astrophotography.</b> Light from passing vehicles is blocked by earthen berms covered with grass, or shrubbery and spruce trees; the Astronomy Field gate has a special light-blocking tarp. The park's Dark Sky Fund has paid {{for many of these}} improvements since 1999.|$|E
25|$|Besides <b>astrophotography</b> Steve Mandel has {{captured}} and published also images of endangered animals. He specializes in using robotic devices to gain artistic wildlife photographs from unusual angles.|$|E
25|$|Steve Mandel {{has also}} {{cooperated with the}} Kitt Peak National Observatory Visitor Center, {{presenting}} educational Nightly Observer Program and Advanced Observer Program to the public. In 2004 he founded the Advanced Imaging Conference in San Jose, California, where about 250 amateur astronomers and manufacturers of astronomical equipment and software meet annually to discuss technology, imaging techniques and possibilities of scientific contributions. He created the so-called Hubble Award, given at the conference to an astronomer who {{made significant contributions to}} <b>astrophotography.</b>|$|E
25|$|Glass {{plates were}} the medium for most {{original}} camera photography {{from the late}} 1850s until the general introduction of flexible plastic films during the 1890s. Although the convenience of the film greatly popularized amateur photography, early films were somewhat more expensive and of markedly lower optical quality than their glass plate equivalents, and until the late 1910s they were not available in the large formats preferred by most professional photographers, so the new medium did not immediately or completely replace the old. Because of the superior dimensional stability of glass, the use of plates for some scientific applications, such as <b>astrophotography,</b> continued into the 1990s, and in the niche field of laser holography, it has persisted into the 2010s.|$|E
25|$|In some contexts, {{especially}} in photography and astronomy, aperture {{refers to the}} diameter of the aperture stop rather than the physical stop or the opening itself. For example, in a telescope, the aperture stop is typically the edges of the objective lens or mirror (or of the mount that holds it). One then speaks of a telescope as having, for example, a 100-centimeter aperture. Note that the aperture stop is not necessarily the smallest stop in the system. Magnification and demagnification by lenses and other elements can cause a relatively large stop to be the aperture stop for the system. In <b>astrophotography,</b> the aperture may be given as a linear measure (for example in inches or mm) or as the dimensionless ratio between that measure and the focal length. In other photography, it is usually given as a ratio.|$|E
25|$|The {{telescope}}s amateur telescope makers build {{range from}} backyard variety to sophisticated instruments that make meaningful {{contributions to the}} field of astronomy. Instruments built by amateurs have been employed in planetary study, astrometry, photometry, comet and asteroid discovery to name just a few. Even the “hobbyist” end of the field can break down into several distinct categories such as: observing deep sky objects, observing the planets, solar observing, lunar observation, and <b>astrophotography</b> of all those classes of objects. Therefore, the design, size, and construction of the telescopes vary as well. Some amateur telescope makers build instruments that, while looking crude, are wholly suited to the purpose they are designed for. Others may strive for a more aesthetic look with high levels of mechanical “finish”. Since some amateur telescope makers {{do not have access to}} high-precision machining equipment, many elegant designs such as the Poncet Platform, Crayford focuser, and the Dobsonian telescope have evolved, which achieve functionality and stability without requiring precision machining.|$|E
500|$|Wolf 359 {{first came}} to the {{attention}} of astronomers because of the relatively high rate of [...] motion against the background, known as the proper motion. A high rate of proper motion can indicate that a star is located nearby, as more distant stars must move at higher velocities in order to achieve the same rate of angular travel across the celestial sphere. The proper motion of Wolf 359 was first measured in 1917 by German astronomer Max Wolf, with the aid of <b>astrophotography.</b> In 1919 he published a catalog of over one thousand stars with high proper motions, including this one, that are still identified by his name. He listed this star as entry number 359, and the star has since been referred to as Wolf 359 in reference to Max Wolf's catalogue.|$|E
500|$|A {{wind farm}} has been {{proposed}} on a site [...] from the park. In 2008Potter County passed an ordinance that wind turbine lights shall not [...] "interfere with the state-designated Dark Skies Preserve at Cherry Springs State Park". That same year the DCNR commissioned {{a study on the}} wind farm's impact, which concluded the red warning lights on the wind turbines would not impact the darkness of the sky and would only be directly visible from the Astronomy Field under rare conditions. Others in the astronomy community challenged these conclusions and feared that new lights on [...] "several dozen wind turbines near the park" [...] will degrade observations and <b>astrophotography.</b> The study also recommended that the DCNR shield and redirect lights at the nearby Denton Hill State Park downhill ski area to make the sky even darker at Cherry Springs.|$|E
500|$|The {{quality of}} the night skies at the park and its growing {{popularity}} for stargazing {{are the result of}} several factors. Cherry Springs {{is in the midst of}} the largely undeveloped [...] Susquehannock State Forest, and is on a summit [...] above sea level. Because it is on the Allegheny Plateau, there are no mountain peaks to block the sky, and the Astronomy Field offers a 360degree unobstructed view. The closest city is Williamsport, [...] to the southeast. Surrounding communities sit in deep valleys, so the intervening terrain screens much of the light they produce; the park has no artificial skyglow in any direction. Cherry Springs is generally fog-free and its latitude puts it in excellent position to observe the Galactic Center of the Milky Way. The remote location also means there is little commercial air traffic to interfere with <b>astrophotography,</b> while PA Route 44 still offers relatively easy access to the park from Interstate 80.|$|E
500|$|<b>Astro{{photography}},</b> {{the photography}} of celestial objects, began in 1840 when John William Draper took {{an image of}} the Moon using the daguerreotype process. On July 17, 1850, Vega became the first star (other than the Sun) to be photographed, when it was imaged by William Bond and John Adams Whipple at the Harvard College Observatory, also with a daguerreotype. Henry Draper took the first photograph of a star's spectrum in August 1872 when he took an image of Vega, and he also became the first person to show absorption lines in the spectrum of a star. Similar lines had already been identified in the spectrum of the Sun. In 1879, William Huggins used photographs of the spectra of Vega and similar stars to identify a set of twelve [...] "very strong lines" [...] that were common to this stellar category. These were later identified as lines from the Hydrogen Balmer series. Since 1943, the spectrum of this star has served as one of the stable anchor points by which other stars are classified.|$|E
2500|$|In 1891, Max Wolf {{pioneered the}} use of <b>astrophotography</b> to detect asteroids, which {{appeared}} as short streaks on long-exposure photographic plates. This dramatically increased the rate of detection compared with earlier visual methods: Wolf alone discovered 248 asteroids, beginning with 323 Brucia, whereas only slightly more than 300 had been discovered up to that point. It was known {{that there were many}} more, but most astronomers did not bother with them, calling them [...] "vermin of the skies", a phrase variously attributed to Eduard Suess and Edmund Weiss. Even a century later, only a few thousand asteroids were identified, numbered and named.|$|E
2500|$|Steve Mandel's {{interest}} in astronomy {{began when he}} was 11 years old. [...] He built his first telescope, a 6" [...] reflector, {{at his home in}} Los Angeles. [...] His {{interest in}} <b>astrophotography</b> grew in the 1970s and 1980s and been worked as a photographic stringer for Newsweek magazine. Later, his wide-field images became recognized by professional astronomers. In 2005, he took pictures of high latitude areas of the sky and experimented with different wavelengths using various photographic filters and managed to take pictures of very faint unexplored nebulae above the plane of the Milky Way. The pictures were investigated by Adolf Witt, an astronomer of the University of Toledo in Ohio, who found out that the nebulae surprisingly contained carbon. Subsequently, his images became a subject of several scientific papers. These interstellar structures, labelled by Mandel as the [...] integrated flux nebulae, are illuminated by the light from the entire galaxy, which distinguishes them from the typical reflection nebulae, illuminated by a nearby star. In 2004 Mandel started to work on the Mandel-Wilson Unexplored Nebulae Project aimed at their discovering, cataloguing and photographing.|$|E
50|$|He {{was well}} known for his {{pioneering}} work in <b>astrophotography</b> (in particular with cooled and hypered emulsion <b>astrophotography</b> before silver became silicon) with multiple contributions to leading astronomy publications. Healy established the Junk Bond Observatory in Arizona for visual work and recoveries of minor planets.|$|E

5000|$|Afocal {{photography}} {{is a form}} of <b>astrophotography</b> long practiced by astronomers. Afocal setups with film and digital cameras are not the preferred system for <b>astrophotography</b> since astrophotographers have many ways of coupling a camera to an astronomical telescope, the simplest being prime focus (using no camera lens and allowing the image to fall directly onto the film, or image plane of a digital single-lens reflex camera or purpose built astronomical CCD camera). Almost from their invention amateur astronomers were adapting compact digital still and video cameras for use in afocal <b>astrophotography.</b>|$|E
