40|$|An {{evolving}} body {{of electronic}} resources in family studies is currently {{available in a}} variety of formats - online (pay-per-use), CD-ROM, and through the Internet. These resources include different types of data, such as bibliographic databases, full-text databases, and electronic conferences. Perhaps the most ambitious online database in marriage and family studies is the Inventory of Marriage and Family Literature Online (IMFL). IMFL contains over 120, 000 bibliographic citations from English language books, journal articles, audio- and videotapes, unpublished research, and government publications. Other online databases that can be useful for those searching for information in marriage and family studies include the Child Abuse and Neglect and Family Violence Database, PsycINFO, and Sociological Abstracts.

40|$|The FSSP {{database}} {{presents a}} continuously updated structural classification of three-dimensional protein folds. It is derived using an automatic structure comparison program (Dali) for the all-against-all comparison of over 6000 three-dimensional coordinate sets in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). Sequence-related protein families {{are covered by}} a representative set of 813 protein chains. Hierachical clustering based on structural similarities yields a fold tree that defines 253 fold classes. For each representative protein chain, there is a database entry containing structure–structure alignments with its structural neighbours in the PDB. The database is accessible online through World Wide Web browsers and by <b>anonymous</b> ftp (<b>file</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>protocol).</b> The overview of fold space and the individual data sets provide {{a rich source of}} information for the study of both divergent and convergent aspects of molecular evolution, and define useful test sets and a standard of truth for assessing the correctness of sequence–sequence or sequence– structure alignments...|$|R
40|$|High-throughput genomic {{technologies}} {{have been used}} to explore personal human genomes for the past few years. Although the integration of technologies is important for high-accuracy detection of personal genomic variations, no databases have been prepared to systematically archive genomes and to facilitate the comparison of personal genomic data sets prepared using a variety of experimental platforms. We describe here the Total Integrated Archive of Short-Read and Array (TIARA; [URL] database, which contains personal genomic information obtained from next generation sequencing (NGS) techniques and ultra-high-resolution comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) arrays. This database improves the accuracy of detecting personal genomic variations, such as SNPs, short indels and structural variants (SVs). At present, 36 individual genomes have been archived and may be displayed in the database. TIARA supports a user-friendly genome browser, which retrieves read-depths (RDs) and log 2 ratios from NGS and CGH arrays, respectively. In addition, this database provides information on all genomic variants and the raw data, including short reads and feature-level CGH data, through <b>anonymous</b> <b>file</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>protocol.</b> More personal genomes will be archived as more individuals are analyzed by NGS or CGH array.

40|$|Scientists {{working on}} the Hawaii Ocean Time-series (HOT) program have been making {{repeated}} observations of the hydrography, chemistry and biology of the water column at a station north of Oahu, Hawaii since October 1988. The objective {{of this research is}} to pro-vide a comprehensive description of the ocean at a site representative of the North Pacific subtropical gyre. Cruises are made approximately once a month to the HOT deep-water station (22 (45 'N, 158 (00 'W) located about 100 km north of Oahu, Hawaii. Measurements of the thermohaline structure, water column chemistry, currents, primary production and particle sedimentation rates are made on each cruise. This document reports the data collected in 1998. However, we have included some data from 1988 - 1997 to place the 1998 measurements within the context of our ongoing time-series observations. The data reported here are a selected subset of the complete data set. Summary plots are given for CTD, biogeochemical, optical, meteorological, thermosali-nograph, inverted echo sounder and ADCP observations.

40|$|Introduction. The aim of {{this project}} was to {{demonstrate}} the feasibility and effectiveness of a teaching files database on diagnostic radiology accessible via the Internet and the World Wide Web. The Italian experience in developing a national database named "RadioDB" is presented. Material and methods. "RadioDB" {{is sponsored by the}} Italian Society of Radiology (SIRM) and is based on a multicenter academic collaboration. It constitutes a collection of multimedia case record and teaching files. "RadioDB" is based on a Pentium workstation running a Structured Query Language (SQL) database and a World Wide Web server. Each case record contains at least one radiological image and a text file for case comment with key words and codes from the American College of Radiology (ACR). In most cases, a complete teaching file is also available. Peer reviewed teaching files available on this server are contributed via <b>anonymous</b> <b>file</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>protocol</b> (FTP) through the Internet from various Italian academic Departments of Radiology. Results. Worldwide users can easily access and search "RadioDB" database through a World Wide Web query interface and retrieve on-the-fly case record and teaching files. Users can search the database by author name, description, key words, free text or ACR codes. Conclusions. "RadioDB" enlarges the base of current on-line educational materials offerings and it allows radiologists to improve their medical education...|$|E
40|$|FSSP (families of {{structurally}} similar proteins) is {{a database}} of structural alignments of proteins in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) [1]. The database currently contains an extended structural family for each of 330 representative protein chains. Each data set contains structural alignments of one search structure with all other structurally significantly similar proteins in the representative set (remote homologs, < 30 % sequence identity), {{as well as all}} structures in the Protein Data Bank with 70 - 30 % sequence identity relative to the search structure (medium homologs). Very close homologs (above 70 % sequence identity) are excluded as they rarely have marked structural differences. The alignments of remote homologs are the result of pairwise all-against-all structural comparisons in the set of 330 representative protein chains. All such comparisons are based purely on the 3 D co-ordinates of the proteins and are derived by automatic (objective) structure comparison programs. The significance of structural similarity is estimated based on statistical criteria. The FSSP database is available electronically from the EMBL file server and by <b>anonymous</b> ftp (<b>file</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>protocol)</b> ...|$|R

40|$|One common {{characteristic}} of the USMP- 4 experiments is that various effects of gravity make it difficult, if not impossible, to achieve usable results when performing the experiments on Earth's surface. Therefore, the investigators {{took advantage of the}} microgravity environment afforded by being in low-Earth orbit to perform their research. Interpretation of the experiment results both during the mission and upon post-mission analyses of data and samples required an understanding of the microgravity environment in which the experiments were conducted. To achieve that understanding, data were collected using the Orbital Acceleration Research Experiment (OARE) and two Space Acceleration Measurement Systems (SAMS). Data from those systems, combined with an assessment of mission and experiment activities, were used to characterize the microgravity environment that existed on Columbia during the mission. The text herein gives details about some characteristics of the environment that were noted during the mission and during post-mission data analysis. The disturbances studied include the Ku-band antenna 17 Hz dither; the effect of changing the Orbiter attitude deadband limits; the effects of different bicycle ergometer configurations; and the effect of IDGE (Isothermal Dendritic Growth Experiment) experiment fans and SAMS computer hard drives. Additional information about the microgravity environment is provided. Supplementary data plots representing the environment throughout the majority of the mission are available at the Uniform Resource Locator (URL).
