50|$|During {{its first}} three years of operation, Rabkrin was crucial in the {{development}} of the growing Communist state. The Central Bureau of Complaints, or Biuro Zhalob, was an internal department within Rabkrin whose sole purpose was to find and eliminate inefficiency within the state’s administration. Any Soviet citizen could file a complaint against a government official through this bureau, Lenin saw this as giving a voice to the people and a say in their government. After failing its goals and having been severely criticized, among others by Lenin himself, in 1923 it was merged with the CPSU Party Control Committee to become a joint control organ (PCC-WPI, TsKK-RKI) under a common chairman, to oversee state, economy, and the Communist Party. As Stalin’s rise to power began after Lenin’s death in 1924, the complaint bureau became a more sinister tool for the new leader. Biuro Zhalob was now used as a tactic to encourage Soviet citizens to provide detailed accounts, including evidence and witnesses, of other comrades opposing the state or being part of anti-communist organizations. Many complaints were followed by quick court hearings for the accused, most cases were then decided upon by the submitted complaints, with or without evidence. In 1929, the complaint bureau of Rabkrin was also combined with the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions complaint bureau (another Soviet <b>administrative</b> <b>establishment</b> in charge of worker unionization); this merger led to a rise in complaints from both agriculture and industrial sectors until 1934.|$|E
