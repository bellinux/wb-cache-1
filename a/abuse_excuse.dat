5000|$|The abuse {{defense is}} [...] "the legal tactic by which {{criminal}} defendants claim {{a history of}} abuse {{as an excuse for}} violent retaliation". In some instances, such as the Bobbitt trial, the supposed abuse occurs shortly before the retaliative act; in such cases, the <b>abuse</b> <b>excuse</b> is raised as a means of claiming temporary insanity or the right of self-defense. In other trials, such as those of the Menendez brothers, the supposed abuse occurs over a prolonged period of time, often beginning during the defendant's childhood; this relates the abuse defense to the concept of diminished capacity. Because the victim of the act is often the person who committed abuse against the defendant in the past, the goal of the <b>abuse</b> <b>excuse</b> is to [...] "put the victim on trial" [...] and show that the abuser [...] "had it coming".|$|E
5000|$|The Supreme Court of the United States {{has held}} on {{numerous}} occasions that the defendant {{should be permitted to}} present any information that they feel might affect sentencing. Despite this legal precedent, the availability of the abuse defense has been criticized by several legal experts, particularly {{in the aftermath of the}} trials of Lorena Bobbitt and the Menendez brothers. Legal scholar Alan Dershowitz has described the <b>abuse</b> <b>excuse</b> as a [...] "lawless invitation to vigilantism".|$|E
2500|$|A {{review of}} {{qualitative}} research studies published between 1982 and 2001 concluded that child sexual abusers use cognitive distortions to meet personal needs, justifying <b>abuse</b> by making <b>excuses,</b> redefining their actions as love and mutuality, and exploiting the power imbalance inherent in all adult–child relationships. Other cognitive distortions include {{the idea of}} [...] "children as sexual beings", uncontrollability of sexual behavior, and [...] "sexual entitlement-bias".|$|R
40|$|When is {{homicide}} reasonable? That familiar, yet unanswered question {{continues to}} intrigue both courts and criminal law scholars, {{in large part}} because any response must first address the question, 2 ̆ 2 reasonable to whom? 2 ̆ 2 The standard story about why that threshold question is both difficult and interesting usually involves a juxtaposition of 2 ̆ 2 objective 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 subjective 2 ̆ 2 standards for judging claims of reasonableness. On the one hand, the story goes, is a 2 ̆ 2 subjective 2 ̆ 2 standard of reasonableness under which jurors evaluate the reasonableness of a criminal defendant 2 ̆ 7 s beliefs and actions by comparing them to those of a hypothetical reasonable person sharing all of the individual defendant 2 ̆ 7 s character traits. This standard is commonly invoked to support the self-defense claims of women who have killed men who have severely and repeatedly abused them. The appropriate model for assessing reasonableness in such cases, the subjectivists argue, is not the reasonable man, or even reasonable person, but rather, the hypothetical 2 ̆ 2 reasonable battered woman. 2 ̆ 2 In contrast, opponents of a qualified standard of reasonableness maintain that criminal law must return to its 2 ̆ 2 objectivity. 2 ̆ 2 Otherwise, the argument goes, defendants invoking syndromes and 2 ̆ 2 <b>abuse</b> <b>excuses</b> 2 ̆ 2 - most notably the battered woman 2 ̆ 2 poster child 2 ̆ 2 - will literally get away with murder. In Murder and the Reasonable Man: Passion and Fear in the Criminal Courtroom, Cynthia Lee adds a new dimension to this traditional dichotomy by suggesting that it is not battered women but, rather, members of the traditional 2 ̆ 2 majority culture 2 ̆ 2 - white, heterosexual men - who are most able to manipulate the concept of reasonableness by invoking dominant cultural norms. In a book directed as much to lay readers and courts as to a traditional academic audience, Lee weaves together a troubling and compelling array of case narratives to demonstrate how majority culture defendants are able to benefit from jurors 2 ̆ 7 deeply ingrained biases...|$|R
50|$|The {{objective}} was to launch Zara during the “16 Days of Activism for NO Violence against Women and Children” campaign, {{in the hope that}} the message creates awareness to men and women to combat violence and abuse. Although this story is based on an Indian family, the hope is that one woman’s story helps other women to speak out, stand up and defend their honor. It is interesting to note, the Department of Justice estimates that 1 out of every four South African women are survivors of domestic violence. According to People Opposing Women Abuse (POWA) 1 in every 6 women who die in Gauteng are killed by an intimate partner. <b>Abuse</b> is NO <b>excuse.</b>|$|R
50|$|The abuse {{defense is}} a {{criminal}} law defense in which the defendant argues that a prior history of abuse justifies violent retaliation. While the term most often refers to instances of child abuse or sexual assault, it also refers more generally to any attempt by the defense to use a syndrome or societal condition to deflect responsibility away from the defendant. Sometimes the concept {{is referred to as}} the <b>abuse</b> <b>excuse,</b> in particular by the critics of the idea that guilty people may use past victimization to diminish the responsibility for their crimes.|$|E
50|$|Although the American public often {{complains}} about the supposed {{frequency with which}} defendants use the abuse defense, {{the reality is that}} it is generally only used in high-profile cases. In order for the abuse defense to be employed effectively, it is necessary for the defense to produce expert testimony on the defendant's behalf. Most defendants are unable to pay for such testimony; as such, qualified experts tend to provide advocating testimony only in those cases in which the defendant is wealthy or is supported by public interest groups. The trials of Lorena Bobbitt and the Menendez brothers were two high-profile cases that are often cited as examples of the <b>abuse</b> <b>excuse</b> in action.|$|E
50|$|Although {{political}} scientist James Q. Wilson has also denounced the <b>abuse</b> <b>excuse,</b> {{he points out}} that it is only effective if a jury finds it to be compelling evidence of innocence or a substantial mitigating factor. When this occurs, {{there is no reason to}} exclude claims of abuse from the trial proceedings. Wilson has argued that the problem lies not in the employment of excuses as legal defenses, but in the intermingling of social science, which seeks to explain human behavior, with criminal law, which seeks to judge behavior. Although many citizens advocate severe penalties as a means of reducing crime, a number of studies have shown that the juror's desire to realize that goal is often overridden by the inherent desire to understand the behavior that leads to crime.|$|E
60|$|The only logical {{cure for}} all this is the {{assertion}} of a human ideal. In dealing with this, I will {{try to be as}} little transcendental as is consistent with reason; it is enough to say that unless we have some doctrine of a divine man, all <b>abuses</b> may be <b>excused,</b> since evolution may turn them into uses. It will be easy for the scientific plutocrat to maintain that humanity will adapt itself to any conditions which we now consider evil. The old tyrants invoked the past; the new tyrants will invoke the future evolution has produced the snail and the owl; evolution can produce a workman who wants no more space than a snail, and no more light than an owl. The employer need not mind sending a Kaffir to work underground; he will soon become an underground animal, like a mole. He need not mind sending a diver to hold his breath in the deep seas; he will soon be a deep-sea animal. Men need not trouble to alter conditions, conditions will so soon alter men. The head can be beaten small enough to fit the hat. Do not knock the fetters off the slave; knock the slave until he forgets the fetters. To all this plausible modern argument for oppression, the only adequate answer is, that there is a permanent human ideal that must not be either confused or destroyed. The most important man on earth is the perfect man who is not there. The Christian religion has specially uttered the ultimate sanity of Man, says Scripture, who shall judge the incarnate and human truth. Our lives and laws are not judged by divine superiority, but simply by human perfection. It is man, says Aristotle, who is the measure. It is the Son of Man, says Scripture, who shall judge the quick and the dead.|$|R
50|$|Tong runs a {{consultancy}} in Florida by {{the name}} of <b>Abuse</b> <b>Excuse.</b> He has been retained by attorneys and parents in all 50 states and has appeared on more than 2000 radio talk shows talking about false allegations of abuse.

40|$|This article reviews Moral Judgment: Does the <b>Abuse</b> <b>Excuse</b> Threaten Our Legal System? by James Q. Wilson (1997). There {{is growing}} {{interest}} within the academy in reviving the 2 ̆ 2 normative 2 ̆ 2 in criminal law scholarship. Enter a recent book, Moral Judgment, by the distinguished criminologist James Q. Wilson. Professor Wilson 2 ̆ 7 s work prompts the question: What {{is meant by}} the term 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 7 judgment 2 ̆ 2 ? Considering three different models [...] judgment as community, judgment as character, and judgment as critique [...] this review argues that Professor Wilson 2 ̆ 7 s idea of judgment both departs from the 2 ̆ 2 new normativity 2 ̆ 2 in existing scholarship and shows how easily 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 7 judgment 2 ̆ 2 may stand in for partial aims. Professor Wilson argues that the 2 ̆ 2 <b>abuse</b> <b>excuse</b> 2 ̆ 2 {{is the product of}} modern social movements that make some defendants, like battered women, more attractive 2 ̆ 2 victims 2 ̆ 2 than others. For these defendants, Wilson argues, the law seeks to explain rather than judge their behavior. Unfortunately, when one comes to look at the particular defenses that Wilson embraces as proper 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 7 judgments 2 ̆ 2 and rejects as poor 2 ̆ 2 explanations, 2 ̆ 2 Wilson 2 ̆ 7 s theory begins to raise serious questions. For example, although Wilson is particularly critical of battered women 2 ̆ 7 s claims, he leaves out important parallels to excuses typically raised by men under the rubric of a well-known and long-standing defense [...] provocation. This selectivity, the review argues, not only betrays Wilson 2 ̆ 7 s judgment as the embrace of tradition for tradition 2 ̆ 7 s sake, but also tells us something important about the 2 ̆ 2 <b>abuse</b> <b>excuse.</b> 2 ̆ 2 It tells us that the danger to our criminal justice system does not lie in a particular set of modern excuses, nor modern social movements like feminism, but in a failed theory of excuse...|$|E
40|$|The {{provocation}} defense, which mitigates {{murder to}} manslaughter for killings perpetrated {{in the heat}} of passion, {{is one of the most}} controversial doctrines in the criminal law because of its perceived gender bias; yet most American scholars and lawmakers have not recommended that it be abolished. This Article analyzes trendsetting feminist homicide law reforms, including the abolition of the provocation defense in three Australian jurisdictions, places these reforms in historical context, and assesses their applicability to the United States. It ultimately advocates reintroducing the concept of justified emotion, grounded in modern equality principles and social values, as a requirement for voluntary manslaughter mitigation. Two insights guide this Article 2 ̆ 7 s critique of partial excuses for murder. First, the revised legal history of intimate-partner homicide presented here demonstrates that the modern version of the provocation defense protects a broader class of angry, jealous, predominantly male defendants than the traditional doctrine of the nineteenth century did. Heat-of-passion claims have become the new 2 ̆ 2 <b>abuse</b> <b>excuse</b> 2 ̆ 2 for men. Second, battered woman syndrome evidence, which is now commonly admitted when abused women stand trial for murder, resonates uncomfortably with insanity claims. Reliance on such evidence ignores the fact that 2 ̆ 2 rational moral actor 2 ̆ 2 theories were also raised successfully in the past to defend domestic violence victims who killed their partners. Based on these insights, I argue that the most desirable aspects of the Australian reforms emphasize moral judgment about the defendant 2 ̆ 7 s reasons for killing and disfavor concessions to irrationality. Inspired by Australian efforts, legislatures in the U. S. should implement comprehensive reform of homicide law and sentencing. Yet, even if American states retain rigid sentencing structures, this Article advocates the repeal of the extreme mental or emotional disturbance defense and a reconceptualization of the provocation doctrine, guided by substantive equality principles, to require that the defendant 2 ̆ 7 s valuation was justified. Provocation mitigation should be curtailed by categorical exclusions for killings arising from beliefs and passions, including lethal rage at infidelity or the termination of an intimate relationship, that do not comport with evolving social norms. Furthermore, although many battered women charged with murdering a violent spouse can successfully claim provocation under the excuse-based modern doctrine, reformist legislatures ought to provide a new intermediate outcome that fits better with the circumstances of such women 2 ̆ 7 s cases...|$|E
