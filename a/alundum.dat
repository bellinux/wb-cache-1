40|$|Currently, the Morgantown Energy Technology Center, is {{actively}} investigating alternative hot fuel gas desulfurization sorbents for {{application to the}} Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC). A sorbent must be highly active towards sulfur at high temperatures and pressure`s, and under varying degrees of reducing atmospheres. Thus, high conversion of the metal oxide and low hydrogen sulfide exit partial pressures. Also, it must regenerate nearly ideally to maintain activity over numerous cycles. Furthermore, regeneration must yield a sulfur product which is economically recoverable directly or indirectly. This cyclic process requires a holistic approach as any one criteria may eliminate a candidate sorbent from further consideration. Over fifty induration campaigns have been conducted among the fifteens Mn-based sorbent formulations. All indurated sorbents has been tested for crush strength and chemical analysis.

40|$|Simple {{and compact}} design of {{prototype}} electron beam welding machine is presented. The instrument allows welding of typical materials as metals and alloys. It {{can be used}} also for surface melting of insulators like glass and ceramic. Electron beam source uses hollow cathode of 20 mm diameter and operates in the pressure between 0. 001 to 0. 1 Torr of noble gas, with the work-piece positioned at 30 mm distance from the cathode. Focussing of the electron beam is provided by curvature {{and shape of the}} cathode surface. No magnetic focussing is provided. Applied voltage to the cathode is in the range 1 – 3 kV, so the energy of electrons is much lower than in conventional electron beam welders. The presence of working gas in the chamber and the occurrence of accompanying glow discharge allows for surface charge neutralization. This causes that the electron beam can bombard insulating materials. The prototype construction of welder does not require complicated and expensive pumping system. In order to obtain a necessary vacuum, sufficient is rotary vane pump. A simple construction of the electron gun design makes it very cheap.

40|$|Wear {{caused by}} {{abrasive}} particles {{is far more}} extensive, when compared with adhesive or normal wear. The effect of a mating surface on the abrasive wear was rarely observed. In practice, however, the wear caused by particles introduced between rubbing surfaces is very important. Combining various materials as rubbing surfaces, the author investigated {{the effect of the}} difference in hardness on wear caused by abrasive particles between them. Bearing steel, stainless steel, high-chromium steel, heat resisting steel castings, Ni-hard and several hard facing alloys were used as the material for the cylindrical testpiece of 8 mm diameter. The mating surface was a disc of bearing steel, carbon steel, phospher bronze or cast iron. Carborundum, <b>alundum,</b> quartz and garnet were experimented with as the abrasive particles. Test results showed clearly the presence of steep peak in the plot of the product of the hardness and the specific wear, i. e. the abraded volume/(load×rubbed distance), against the hardness, when the hardness of both surfaces became nearly equal. This tendency was always observed irrespective {{of the nature of the}} abrasive material, and deviated considerably from the empirical law stating the constancy of the product. The author attempted to explain this fact by observing traces of free particles and embedded particles on the rubbing surfaces by means of an electron microscope. The difference in the embedability of the rubbing surfaces was found to cause the wide deviation of the value of the product. When the hardness of the cylindrical test piece related to its embedability closely approaches to that of the disk, the abrasive action of embedded particles becomes remarkable...|$|E
40|$|In {{the course}} of {{attempts}} to isolate viruses by direct inoculation of albino Swiss mice with throat washings from clinical cases of influenza, non-influenzal pneumonias were frequently encountered in the passage mice. The pneumonias observed were of two types. One type was indistinguishable in the gross from that produced by influenza virus and the etiological agent of this type {{was found to be}} a filterable virus which was subsequently identified, on the basis of serological reactions, with that described by Horsfall and Hahn (1). Dochez, Mills, and Mulliken (2) and Gordon, Freeman, and Clampit (3) have described similar pneumonia-producing viruses isolated from apparently normal mice. The second type of pneumonia encountered was likewise found to be due to a filterable virus, but the microscopic demonstration of elementary bodies, the characteristic appearance of the early lesions, the greater virulence, and the serological reactions definitely distinguish this virus from the former. A brief description of it has been published (4). It will be dealt with in detail here. Isolation of Virus Albino Swiss mice from 4 to 5 weeks old were used throughout {{the course of}} this study.

40|$|A {{review of}} the {{clinical}} features of seven patients with sporotrichosis arthritis showed that six had joint infection without previous skin or lung involvement and that one with myelofibrosis had joint and skin infection. The average time from onset of joint symptoms to diagnosis was 25 months, resulting in joint damage that required arthrodesis in four patients. Tissue from open synovial biopsy was superior to synovial fluid for obtaining a positive culture; concomitant synovial fluid and synovial tissue cultures were superior to either one alone. Granulomatous inflammation was seen in synovial tissue in six patients biopsied. Amphotericin B with surgical debridement of the affected joint was successful treatment in four patients. Although an uncommon cause of joint disease, sporotrichosis arthritis may go unrecognized and mimic other forms of arthritis, resulting in irreparable damage in an otherwise curable form of arthritis. BECAUSE SPOROTRICHOSIS is an uncommon cause of arthri-tis and occurs {{in the absence of}} the more clinically famil-iar cutaneous infection, delay in diagnosis of this infectious arthritis is frequent and may result in extensive destructive changes in the affected joints. Between 1954 and 1975, seven patients with sporotricho-sis arthritis were treated at the Mayo Clinic. Six patients had joint involvement as the sole manifestation of systemic sporotrichosis, and one patient with myelofibrosis had a multifocal form of systemic sporotrichosis with skin and joint involvement. Records of these patients were analyzed for pattern of joint involvement, clinical and laboratory features, roentgenographic and pathologic findings, and results of treatment. Methods Sporotrichosis arthritis in the seven patients was diagnosed by culture of Sporothrix schenckii from synovial tissue ob-tained at open synovial biopsy or from synovial fluid, or both, of affected joints.
