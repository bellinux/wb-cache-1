5|$|On July 30, 1914, Boston owner Joseph Lannin had {{purchased}} the minor-league Providence Grays, {{members of the}} International League. The Providence team had been owned by several people associated with the Detroit Tigers, including star hitter Ty Cobb, {{and as part of}} the transaction, a Providence pitcher was sent to the Tigers. To soothe Providence fans upset at losing a star, Lannin announced that the Red Sox would soon send a replacement to the Grays. This was intended to be Ruth, but his departure for Providence was delayed when Cincinnati Reds owner Garry Herrmann claimed him off waivers. After Lannin wrote to Herrmann explaining that the Red Sox wanted Ruth in Providence so he could develop as a player, and would not release him to a major league club, Herrmann allowed Ruth to be sent to the minors. Carrigan later stated that Ruth was not sent down to Providence to make him <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>player,</b> but to help the Grays win the International League pennant (league championship).|$|E
5|$|The First World War {{interrupted}} his studies. A {{week after}} winning the OHA championship in March 1915, Smythe and his eight teammates enlisted. Smythe recalled in his memoirs that he and several classmates tried to enlist {{at the beginning of}} the 1914–15 season, but were told to come back when they had beards. After securing a provisional rank of lieutenant with the 2nd (Ottawa) Battery, 8th Brigade, on July 17, he headed to the Royal School of Artillery in Kingston, Ontario, in August for five weeks of training. He made full lieutenant on September 11, and was able to get himself transferred to the 40th (Sportsmen's) Battery of Hamilton, organized by publishing figure Gordon Southam, son of William Southam. The unit, with Smythe as team manager, organized a team to compete in the OHA's senior league; they were one of four Toronto-based teams in the league in 1916. He played one game at centre, and then decided to replace himself with <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>player.</b> The team did not complete the season, as the 40th Battery went overseas in February 1916.|$|E

25|$|Ichiro {{grew up in}} {{the town}} of Toyoyama, a {{relatively}} small town just outside Nagoya. At the age of seven, Ichiro joined his first baseball team and asked his father, Nobuyuki Suzuki (鈴木宣之), to teach him to be <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>player.</b> The two began a daily routine which included throwing 50 pitches, fielding 50 infield balls and 50 outfield balls, and hitting 500 pitches, 250 from a pitching machine and 250 from his father.|$|E
25|$|On the {{subsequent}} tour of Pakistan {{less than six}} months later, Ponting was dropped in favour of Darren Lehmann. The left-hander was perceived to be <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>player</b> of spin and a better prospect on the dry pitches of the Indian subcontinent than Ponting. In the first Test starting in October, Lehmann scored 98 in Rawalpindi, as Australia won their first Test in Pakistan in 39 years. Ponting's only Test outing was in a high-scoring second Test draw in Peshawar, when he scored 76 not out and 43 as Lehmann was injured. The match saw Mark Taylor equal Don Bradman's Australian record score of 334, when he declared Australia's innings overnight on 4/599, despite being not out. Ponting was replaced by Lehmann for the final Test.|$|E

500|$|At {{the same}} time, his mother Loretta was {{diagnosed}} with skin cancer. Following her death early in his freshman year, Cullen contemplated returning to his Ontario home, but was convinced by his father to continue with both school and hockey.

[...] Cullen felt that the inspiration he drew from his mother's battle allowed him to become <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>player.</b>|$|E
500|$|Prior to {{his junior}} year of high school, Sanchez {{transferred}} to Mission Viejo, where Johnson, who was recognized as a [...] "quarterback guru", having trained professionals like Carson Palmer, was head coach. Under Johnson's tutelage, Mark felt {{he would have a}} better opportunity to become <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>player.</b> Johnson tutored Mark on the complexities of the position and in two seasons with the team, Mark led the Diablos to a 27–1 record culminating with the California Interscholastic Federation Division II championship in 2004.|$|E
500|$|Finishing strongly, the Sonics {{ended the}} regular season with a 47–35 record and made the 1978 NBA Playoffs. After {{eliminating}} the Los Angeles Lakers, the defending champion Portland Trail Blazers, and the Denver Nuggets, they almost defeated the Washington Bullets by taking a 3–2 lead in the 1978 NBA Finals. In a 93–92 Game 3 victory, Johnson blocked seven shots—the most blocks in NBA Finals history for a guard. The Sonics lost in seven games, however, partly because of Johnson's Game 7 scoring drought, in which the second-year guard missed all of his 14 field goal attempts. Johnson later acknowledged that he simply [...] "choked"; he vowed never to repeat this again and credited this game as an important lesson to become <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>player.</b>|$|E

500|$|Thousands of fans braved cold {{temperatures}} on January 24 for {{a public}} visitation at the Cathedral Basilica of Saint Louis, where Musial lay in state, dressed in his trademark cardinal-red blazer and with a harmonica in his lapel pocket, flanked by a Navy honor guard. A private funeral Mass was held on Saturday, January 26, 2013, at the New Cathedral in St. Louis, televised locally by KTVI and KPLR as well as Fox Sports Midwest on pay-television. New York's Cardinal Timothy Dolan, who in his first episcopal post served as an auxiliary bishop of the Archdiocese of Saint Louis, was the principal celebrant, and Knoxville's Bishop Richard F. Stika, Musial's former parish priest, was the homilist. Bob Costas gave the principal eulogy, calling him [...] "the genuine hero who as the years and decades passed, and disillusionment came from other directions, never once let us down", and quoting fellow Cooperstown honoree Mickey Mantle, who once said that Musial [...] "was <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>player</b> than me {{because he was a}} better man than me".|$|E
500|$|Listed as a left wing, Breslin {{was capable}} of playing all three forward positions, an ability which gave his coaches {{flexibility}} and allowed him to play in any situation. Not a big player, standing six feet tall weighing 180 pounds, he played a gritty, physical, brand of hockey primary in a checking line role. As a checker it was his responsibility {{to shut down the}} opposition and keep them from scoring, emphasizing defense over offense. Because of his versatility and role, he was often a member of his team's penalty killing unit. Breslin was known for his team-first attitude and willingness to do whatever was asked of him in order to help the team succeed. Former Wolves General Manager Kevin Cheveldayoff said of Breslin, [...] "You could always count on Tim to come and compete every night and do what was needed for the team to win". Not the most talented of players, Breslin's work ethic helped him to be <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>player.</b> Head coach Anderson once stated, [...] "He is the kind of player who maybe isn't in the very upper echelon in skill factor, but his dedication and hard work make up for that." ...|$|E
500|$|Following the 1988 season, the Orioles again named Ripken their third-base coach. Speaking at the Annual Ripken Fan Club Banquet, {{general manager}} Roland Hemond said, [...] " [...] {{was a tough}} year for the Orioles, a tough year for me, and a tough year for the Ripken family. There {{was a lot of}} trauma, and I {{respected}} them for the way they handled it. I will never forget it." [...] Brady Anderson, who would play for the Orioles from 1988 through 2001 and hit 50 home runs in 1996, credited Ripken for helping him make it with the Orioles: [...] "I'll never forget earlier in my career how Cal Sr. stayed with me, trying to help me become <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>player</b> when it might not have been the fashionable thing to do within the organization." [...] Ripken remained with the team until after the 1992 season, when he was removed from third-base coach duties as the Orioles wished to give younger coaches opportunities. The Orioles offered him the brand new position of coordinator of minor league field operations, but he declined, disappointed at being removed from third base. Ripken maintained that he was not retired, but he would never coach professionally again.|$|E

2500|$|Questions over Cotchin's role as captain {{continued}} into the 2017 pre-season, this time from departing Richmond development coach Mark Williams.

2500|$|No {{captain of}} my time has {{impressed}} me more than Richie Benaud. Richie had the gift of making you feel you were <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>player</b> than you really were.

Nothing illustrated more clearly Richie's adroit handling of men than his leadership of the 1961 Australian team which came to Britain. They should never have won the rubber with those players, but Richie instilled into them his belief in themselves - this attitude that [...] "there is nothing we cannot achieve if we set our minds to it".|$|E
2500|$|Despite the {{addition}} of Howard and Nash, Bryant insisted he remained {{the leader of the}} Lakers. Nash agreed that it was Bryant's team, but added the team needed to provide support. Bryant looked forward to Nash running the team's offense. Bryant envisioned that after he retired, Howard would assume the role of team leader. Howard anticipated Bryant being tough on him. [...] "So, I'll take all the heat that he's going to give me because I know {{at the end of the}} day that's going to make me <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>player</b> and a better person and it's going to make this team better", Howard said.
