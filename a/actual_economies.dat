30|$|As shown above, while a {{positive}} marketing shock can raise output, it decreases investment. This phenomenon seems to {{contrast with the}} experience of the late 1990 s.

Of course, since {{there is a possibility that}} matching technology increase investment in the <b>actual</b> <b>economy,</b> careful empirical research is needed.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The paper {{deals with}} an updated Greiner’s model, {{defining}} its final stage, Development through Alliance, {{in the frame}} of <b>actual</b> knowledge based <b>economy,</b> and with introduction and characterization of its final crisis, Incompatibility crisis. The research method is based on analysis of SMEs characteristics that use concentrated energies technologies, correlated with characteristics of <b>actual</b> <b>economy.</b> This led to some elements of the final stage of Greiner’s model, which were developed together with managerial methods of organizational development as well as solutions to avoid or ameliorate the final crisis of Incompatibility, applied to SMEs, using the approached technologies. It was also identified a trend concerning small and medium enterprises (SMEs) evolution from Romania, which use concentrated energies technologies. Some generic development solutions for the mentioned organizations in <b>actual</b> <b>economy</b> are provided...|$|R

5000|$|Natural economics: Economics is {{concerned}} with both 'normal' and 'abnormal' economic conditions. In an objective scientific study one is not restricted by the normality assumption in describing <b>actual</b> <b>economies,</b> as much empirical evidence shows that some [...] "anomalous" [...] behavior can persist {{for a long time}} in real markets e.g., in market [...] "bubbles" [...] and market [...] "herding".|$|E

In this view, it does not focus on explaining <b>actual</b> <b>economies</b> but instead on describing a [...] "utopia" [...] in which Pareto optimality applies. In the opinion of some developers of an alternative approach, the purpose of neoclassical {{economics is}} [...] "to demonstrate the social optimality if the real world were to resemble the model", not [...] "to explain the real world as observed empirically".|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} {{paper of}} Kiyotaki and Moore was theoretical in nature, and made little attempt {{to evaluate the}} quantitative relevance of their mechanism for <b>actual</b> <b>economies.</b> In 2005, Kiyotaki's student Matteo Iacoviello embedded the Kiyotaki-Moore mechanism inside a standard New Keynesian general equilibrium macroeconomic model. For realism, Iacoviello assumed that the collateralizable form of capital corresponds to real estate, and compared the predictions of his model with observed fluctuations of real housing prices in the United States.|$|E

40|$|The GDP is the {{official}} economy of a country but {{may not be the}} country’s <b>actual</b> <b>economy.</b> The gap between GDP and the <b>actual</b> <b>economy</b> has led to the conceptualisation of a second economy. The underground economy (UE) is a portion of the second economy. UE is defined here as the income of legal activities (irregular economy) and illicit activities (illegal economy) that evade taxes. The characteristics and size of UE is estimated based on enforcement data of tax and commercial criminal of 1980 - 2009 using ratio and regression techniques. The objectives of this UE study are; to explore its proxy indicators; estimate its size and growth; identify its characteristics; examine its economic association (CPI, GDP per-capita, cash in circulation, electricity consumption and economic crises) and evaluate government interaction to curb UE activities (tax system and federal expenditure). Over the 1980 - 2009 period, the UE has increased up to 5. 46 folds amounting to MYR 849 billion. The size of UE fluctuates between 8. 92...|$|R
40|$|Optimization by {{individual}} agents, {{often used to}} derive competitive equilibria, are unnecessary for an <b>actual</b> <b>economy</b> to approximately attain such equilibria. From the failure of humans to optimize in complex tasks, one need not conclude that the equilibria derived from the competitive model are descriptively irrelevant. We show that even in complex economic systems, such equilibria can be attained under a range of surprisingly weak assumptions about agent behavior. Competitive model, equilibrium, double auction, experimental economics, Leex...|$|R
50|$|In {{the first}} approach, the {{economic}} models take as given {{the institutions and}} arrangements observed in <b>actual</b> <b>economies.</b> This approach has two advantages. First {{the structure of the}} model {{is similar to that of}} the Arrow-Debreu model to make it amenable to the powerful techniques of analysis developed for that framework. Second it is easy to compare model allocations with their empirical counterpart. Among the first papers using this approach, Diamond (1967) focused directly on the “realistic” market structure consisting of the stock and bond markets.|$|E
50|$|Scarf’s book ``The Computation of Economic Equilibria” (Yale University Press, 1973) is {{considered}} his magnum opus. It is a monumental work both in economic theory and in applied mathematics. Scarf ingeniously developed the first general constructive method for the explicit numerical {{solution to the}} neoclassical model of economic equilibrium and {{has made it possible}} to transform such a model from an abstract representation of an economy into realistic models of <b>actual</b> <b>economies,</b> permitting us to evaluate the effects of significant changes in the environment and in economic policies.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{critics of}} general {{equilibrium}} modeling contend that much research in these models constitutes exercises in pure mathematics with {{no connection to}} <b>actual</b> <b>economies.</b> In a 1979 article, Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen complains: [...] "There are endeavors that now pass for the most desirable kind of economic contributions although they are just plain mathematical exercises, not only without any economic substance but also without any mathematical value." [...] He cites as an example a paper that assumes more traders in existence than there are points in the set of real numbers.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we {{will study}} some {{business}} cycle models with sticky pricing and endogenous and firm-specific capital. We also manage to incorporate capital utilization into the models. As revealed by the simulation results, the cyclical behaviors of our business cycle models are quite normal compared with the literature {{and those of the}} <b>actual</b> <b>economy</b> except the simulated correlations between inflation and output. Such simulation result is mainly because in symmetric equilibriums, money in our models turns out to be superneutral. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{design and}} {{analysis}} of optimal monetary policy is usually guided by the paradigm of homogeneous rational expectations. Instead, we examine the dynamic consequences of implementation strategies, when the <b>actual</b> <b>economy</b> features expectational heterogeneity. Agents have either rational or adaptive expectations. Consequently the central bank's ability to achieve price-stability under heterogeneous expectations depends on its objective and implementation strategy. An expectations-based reaction function, which appropriately conditions on private sector expectations, performs exceptionally well. However, once the objective introduces policy inertia, popular strategies can fail. These results call for new implementation strategies under interest rate stabilization...|$|R
40|$|The {{critical}} role for economic theory {{is no longer}} simply {{to explain how the}} existing system works, but also to explore how the economic system can be changed to become more adaptive and resilient {{in the face of the}} challenges of the 21 st century, and how it can be more directly designed to support human well-being, in the present and the future. Simultaneous changes are needed, in both the <b>actual</b> <b>economy</b> (how it functions, by what rules, how it can be made responsive to constraints) and also in economic theory. ...|$|R

50|$|By 2010, serious games {{had evolved}} to {{incorporate}} <b>actual</b> <b>economies</b> like Second Life, in which users can create actual business which deal in virtual commodities {{and services for}} Linden dollars which were exchangeable for US currency. In 2015, Project Discovery was launched as a serious game. Project Discovery was launched as a vehicle by which geneticists and astronomers with the University of Geneva could access the cataloging efforts of the gaming public via a mini-game contained within the Eve Online massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG). Players acting as citizen scientists categorize and assess actual genetic samples or astrological data. This data was then utilized and warehoused by researchers.

50|$|In each country, a {{panel of}} {{purchasing}} managers is carefully selected by Markit, designed to accurately represent the true structure of the chosen {{sector of the economy}} as determined by official data. Generally, value added data are used at two-digit SIC level, with a further breakdown by company size analysis where possible. The survey panels therefore replicate the <b>actual</b> <b>economy</b> in miniature. A weighting system is also incorporated into the survey database that weights each response by company size and the relative importance of the sector in which that company operates.|$|R
50|$|Economic data or {{economic}} statistics are data (quantitative measures) describing an <b>actual</b> <b>economy,</b> past or present. These are typically found in time-series form, that is, covering {{more than one}} time period (say the monthly unemployment rate {{for the last five}} years) or in cross-sectional data in one time period (say for consumption and income levels for sample households). Data may also be collected from surveys of for example individuals and firms or aggregated to sectors and industries of a single economy or for the international economy. A collection of such data in table form comprises a data set.|$|R

Because such risk is encompassed in the general competitive model, it seems to pose no new theoretical challenge. However, that model has markets contingent on exogenous events, while the <b>actual</b> <b>economy</b> seems to be developing mainly markets contingent {{on the level of}} total damage. In the context of a model with aggregate risk and endogenous total damage, a notion of competitive markets contingent on total damage is formulated. That notion implies that such markets achieve the same (efficient) risk sharing as markets contingent on exogenous events. Risk...|$|R

40|$|Agriculture is {{a sector}} of the {{national}} economy which may represent {{a significant contribution to}} the economic growth if it is quantified properly. In Romania agriculture has declined significantly caused by various reasons. In frame of this study, we will attempt to discern their influence using official statistics. We will try to identify the place and the role of agriculture in Romania's <b>actual</b> <b>economy</b> from the perspective of GDP, investment in agriculture, the employment of this sector activity, because romanian agriculture remains an important sector in terms of view of agricultural area used, the contribution to GDP and, in particular, the percentage of the population employed. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{conducts a}} modern {{variant of the}} test {{proposed}} and carried out by Adelman and Adelman (1959). Using the methods developed by Burns and Mitchell (1946). we {{see if we can}} distinguish between the economic series generated by an <b>actual</b> <b>economy</b> and those analogous artificial series generated by a stochastically perturbed economic model. In the case of the Adelmans, the model corresponded to the Klein-Goldberger equations. In our case, the model corresponds to a simple real business cycle model. The results indicate a fairly high degree of coincidence in key economic aggregates between the business cycle characteristics identified in actual data and those found in our simulated economy. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{develop and}} {{implement}} a limited information diagnostic strategy for assessing the plausibility of monetary business cycle models. Our strategy focuses on a model's ability to reproduce empirical estimates of an <b>actual</b> <b>economy's</b> response to monetary policy shocks. A key input to this diagnostic is a univariate time series representation of the response of money to a shock in monetary policy. We find that a monetary policy shock has only a small contemporaneous effect on the monetary base and M 1. Its primary effect is to signal future movements in the money supply. We implement our diagnostic strategy on a limited participation model of money which {{stresses the importance of}} credit market frictions in the monetary transmission mechanism. ...|$|R

Furthermore, using data from input-output tables for a number of countries and years, it examines the extent to which <b>actual</b> <b>economies</b> fulfil those spectral conditions. ...|$|E
40|$|From {{an initial}} {{position}} of laissez-faire, temporary tariffs {{have been shown}} to improve the current account. However, if tariffs are initially positive (as in many <b>actual</b> <b>economies),</b> temporary tariffs will magnify an existing distortion and therefore lower real income during protectionist periods. Optimizing agents may wish to smooth the path of consumption relative to income by foreign borrowing. If the intertemporal elasticity of substitution is sufficiently low, temporary tariffs may actually worsen the current account. ...|$|E

The HRCC cylinder head had different combustion chamber geometry and relocated spark plug and valves; the inlet system was revised, too, as was the camshaft profile.
