40|$|Efficient {{control of}} Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. dieffenbachiae, the causal agent of <b>anthurium</b> <b>bacterial</b> <b>blight,</b> {{requires}} a sensitive and reliable diagnostic tool. A nested PCR test was developed from a sequence-characterized amplified region marker identified by randomly amplified polymorphic DNA PCR {{for the detection}} of X. axonopodis pv. dieffenbachiae. Serological and pathogenicity tests were performed concurrently with the nested PCR test with a large collection of X. axonopodis pv. dieffenbachiae strains that were isolated worldwide and are pathogenic to anthurium and/or other aroids. The internal primer pair directed amplification of the expected product (785 bp) for all 70 X. axonopodis pv. dieffenbachiae strains pathogenic to anthurium tested and for isolates originating from syngonium and not pathogenic to anthurium. This finding is consistent with previous studies which indicated that there is a high level of relatedness between strains from anthurium and strains from syngonium. Strains originating from the two host genera can be distinguished by restriction analysis of the amplification product. No amplification product was obtained with 98 strains of unrelated phytopathogenic bacteria or saprophytic bacteria from the anthurium phyllosphere, except for a weak signal obtained for one X. axonopodis pv. allii strain. Nevertheless, restriction enzyme analysis permitted the two pathovars to be distinguished. The detection threshold obtained with pure cultures or plant extracts (103 CFU ml− 1) allowed detection of the pathogen from symptomless contaminated plants. This test could be a useful diagnostic tool for screening propagation stock plant material and for monitoring international movement of X. axonopodis pv. dieffenbachiae...|$|E
40|$|Efficient {{control of}} Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. dieffenbachiae, the causal agent of <b>anthurium</b> <b>bacterial</b> <b>blight,</b> {{requires}} sensitive and reliable diagnostic tools. The European standard EN ISO 16140 : 2003 has been followed to compare a nested PCR assay (N-PCR) to a reference method (isolation and serological identification of bacterial colonies) {{and to other}} alternative serological detection methods. The evaluation was performed in two steps: a comparative study and a collaborative study involving 15 European laboratories. Although inclusivity was maximal (100 %) for all methods, a maximal exclusivity was obtained only with N-PCR followed by an enzymatic restriction digestion of the amplicons. Exclusivity indices of 90 * 6, 88 * 7 and 47 * 2 % were found for indirect ELISA, immunofluorescence and double antibody sandwich ELISA, respectively. An exclusivity of 92 * 5 % was obtained with the reference method, further increased to 100 % if pathogenicity tests were performed as a supplemental assay. The best level of sensitivity (relative detection level) was obtained with the reference method followed by the N-PCR assay. The N-PCR performance in terms of relative accuracy, accordance and concordance was {{very similar to that}} of the reference method. Moreover, N-PCR had undeniable advantages compared to the reference method (less labour-intensive and less time-consuming). In addition, post-test probabilities of infection were calculated to select the most appropriate detection scheme related to the prevalence of the pathogen. The N-PCR assay has since been included in a revised version of the EPPO detection protocol. © 2013 British Society for Plant Pathology...|$|E

40|$|<b>Bacterial</b> <b>blight,</b> {{which is}} caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo), {{is one of the}} most devastating rice {{diseases}} worldwide. The development and use of disease-resistant cultivars have been the most effective strategy to control <b>bacterial</b> <b>blight.</b> Identifying the genes mediating <b>bacterial</b> <b>blight</b> resistance is a prerequisite for breeding cultivars with broad-spectrum and durable resistance. We herein describe a genome-wide association study involving 172 diverse Oryza sativa ssp. indica accessions to identify loci influencing the resistance to representative strains of six Xoo races. Twelve resistance loci containing 121 significantly associated signals were identified using 317, 894 single nucleotide polymorphisms, which explained 13. 3 – 59. 9 % of the variability in lesion length caused by Xoo races P 1, P 6, and P 9 a. Two hotspot regions (L 11 and L 12) were located within or nearby two cloned R genes (xa 25 and Xa 26) and one fine-mapped R gene (Xa 4). Our results confirmed the relatively high resolution of genome-wide association studies. Moreover, we detected novel significant associations on chromosomes 2, 3, and 6 – 10. Haplotype analyses of xa 25, the Xa 26 paralog (MRKc; LOC_Os 11 g 47290), and a Xa 4 candidate gene (LOC_ 11 g 46870) revealed differences in <b>bacterial</b> <b>blight</b> resistance among indica subgroups. These differences were responsible for the observed variations in lesion lengths resulting from infections by Xoo races P 1 and P 9 a.
