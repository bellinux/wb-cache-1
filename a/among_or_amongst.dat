50|$|It {{is found}} in lowland forest canopy and semi-open woodland, and builds a {{rudimentary}} platform nest out of twigs 5 - 30 m high in a tree <b>or</b> <b>amongst</b> vines. It lays one white egg.|$|R
50|$|The larvae {{feed on the}} upperside of {{the leaves}} of Quercus species. They live under a slight web. Pupation {{takes place in a}} whitish boat-shaped cocoon on a leaf, trunk, <b>or</b> <b>amongst</b> leaf-litter on the ground.|$|R
50|$|The {{breeding}} season lasts from May to July. A large cup-shaped nest is built {{up to two}} metres above {{the ground in a}} tree <b>or</b> bush <b>or</b> <b>amongst</b> undergrowth. Two to five blue or blue-green eggs are laid.|$|R
50|$|Mistry, or Mistri, is a surname {{found in}} India <b>or</b> <b>amongst</b> people of Indian origin. Gujarat, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and even West Bengal. This surname {{is used by}} many {{different}} communities of India. It is an occupation surname.|$|R
50|$|Unlike {{most members}} of the {{subfamily}} Aviculariinae, which are arboreal, E. murinus lives mainly on or near the forest floor, where it will build a heavily-webbed burrow beneath the topsoil <b>or</b> <b>amongst</b> branches, rocks, and other forest floor debris.|$|R
50|$|The larvae feed on Thymus serpyllum, Thymus drucei and Polygala species. They form a silken gallery {{sometimes}} including {{debris from}} the nests of the ant Lasius flavus. Pupation {{takes place in a}} cocoon in the soil <b>or</b> <b>amongst</b> leaf detritus.|$|R
5000|$|Scenes of play {{fall into}} two categories: [...] "enrichment scenes", {{focusing}} on character development, and [...] "conflict scenes", focusing on clashes between heroes and villains, <b>or</b> <b>amongst</b> the heroes themselves. The outcome of scenes is settled with standard playing cards.|$|R
25|$|Rather uncommon, the {{circular}} stingaree has a restricted range off southwestern Australia between Esperance and Rottnest Island. It is a benthic species {{that can be}} found from the shore to a depth of , generally sighted over rocks and reefs, <b>or</b> <b>amongst</b> kelp.|$|R
50|$|Breeding {{takes place}} from September to December. The nest {{is a simple}} scrape, usually in the old nest of another bird, {{especially}} the sickle-billed vanga. The nest {{is located in a}} tree hole <b>or</b> <b>amongst</b> epiphytic growth. Three yellowish eggs are laid.|$|R
50|$|Rather uncommon, the {{circular}} stingaree has a restricted range off southwestern Australia between Esperance and Rottnest Island. It is a benthic species {{that can be}} found from the shore to a depth of 120 m, generally sighted over rocks and reefs, <b>or</b> <b>amongst</b> kelp.|$|R
50|$|Tripleurospermum maritimum (syn. Matricaria maritima) is {{a species}} of {{flowering}} plant in the aster family commonly known as false mayweed or sea mayweed. It is found in many coastal areas of Northern Europe, including Scandinavia and Iceland, often growing in sand <b>or</b> <b>amongst</b> beach pebbles.|$|R
50|$|The {{habitat is}} Alnus, Quercus and Betula with Salix {{woodland}} or coniferous (Picea) woodland, <b>or</b> <b>amongst</b> Alnus and Salix.Also found by springs, wet flushes and along streams in grassland.Flowers visited include white umbellifers, composites, Cirsium vulgare, Centaurea, Cirsium vulgare, Ranunculus, Rubus, Scabiosa, Succisa pratensis, Mentha aquatica, Sonchus.|$|R
50|$|The larvae feed on Pinus strobus. Full-grown larvae can {{be found}} from July to October. They reach a length of 20 mm and have a green body, {{as well as a}} green head. The species overwinters in the pupal stage in the soil <b>or</b> <b>amongst</b> debris.|$|R
50|$|The Spot {{returned}} in Civil War: War Crimes {{where he was}} recruited as part of Hammerhead's supervillain army. However, as Iron Man and S.H.I.E.L.D. forces attacked their forces, it remains unknown if the Spot is currently incarcerated with other villains, somehow escaped, <b>or</b> <b>amongst</b> the casualties of the raid.|$|R
50|$|Using {{environmental}} cues, {{the timing}} of nesting {{is determined by the}} painted honeyeaters so they are not arriving at sites as food resources are declining rather than beginning to increase. Coinciding breeding with fruit ripening may also correlate with the preference of many individuals to nest near <b>or</b> <b>amongst</b> mistletoe.|$|R
50|$|One {{reason for}} the taxonomic {{uncertainty}} with this species is that, {{if it is a}} true siskin, it is the only one which breeds in cavities. A shallow cup nest is constructed in cracks or holes in rocks, on ledges <b>or</b> <b>amongst</b> vegetation, especially ferns. Natural hollows in trees are rarely used.|$|R
25|$|Banksia wonganensis {{is a large}} shrub {{endemic to}} Western Australia that, until 2007, was {{previously}} known as Dryandra wonganensis. It occurs within a small area {{in the vicinity of}} the Wongan Hills. It grows on lateritic soils in open woodland <b>or</b> <b>amongst</b> dense shrub. It is rare, but does not appear to be endangered.|$|R
50|$|Knipowitschia longecaudata, the Longtail dwarf goby, is {{a species}} of goby native to the Black Sea, Sea of Azov, and the Caspian Sea where it is mostly found in areas of {{brackish}} water over sand <b>or</b> <b>amongst</b> weeds where it feeds on small invertebrates. This species can reach a length of 5 cm TL.|$|R
50|$|The larvae feed on Origanum (including Origanum vulgare), Mentha, Calamintha and Thymus species. They {{live in a}} spun {{terminal}} shoot of their host plant. They constructs a silken web intermixed with dead leaves. It overwinters in the larval stage. Pupation takes place in July within a papery cocoon in the earth <b>or</b> <b>amongst</b> leaf-litter.|$|R
50|$|There {{are many}} {{varieties}} {{of this species}} but in general it is a tough perennial herb which forms mats in gravelly soil <b>or</b> <b>amongst</b> rocks and produces erect inflorescences up to 35 centimeters in height. The pale green to gray leaves {{at the base of}} the plant are rounded and woolly and have petioles.|$|R
50|$|Like all {{albatrosses}} {{they are}} colonial, but unusually they will build their nests in scrub <b>or</b> <b>amongst</b> Blechnum tree ferns. Like all mollymawks they build pedestal nests of mud, peat, feathers, and vegetation to lay their one egg in. They {{do this in}} September or early October, and the chick fledges in late March to April. They breed annually.|$|R
5000|$|Ryukyuan {{languages}} (Ryūkyū-goha): Languages originally and traditionally spoken {{throughout the}} Ryukyu Islands chain, most are considered [...] "definitely" [...] or [...] "critically endangered" [...] due to mainland Japanese influence after the conquering of the Ryukyu Kingdom by Meiji Japan. Most are considered dialects of Japanese in Japan, despite little intelligibility with Japanese <b>or</b> <b>amongst</b> each other.|$|R

25|$|The Xhosa {{people are}} divided into several tribes with related yet {{distinct}} heritages. The main tribes are AmaGcaleka, AmaRharhabe, ImiDange, ImiDushane, and AmaNdlambe. In addition, there are other tribes found near <b>or</b> <b>amongst</b> the Xhosa people such as AbaThembu, AmaBhaca, ], AbakoBhosha and AmaQwathi that are distinct and separate tribes which have adopted the Xhosa language and the Xhosa way of life.|$|R
25|$|The {{caterpillars}} feed inside {{almost any}} plant parts (fruits, seeds, galls, leaves or flowers), sometimes in a mine or sometimes exposed or under silk on the leaf surface; unlike some Lepidoptera the pupa is not extruded from the cocoon (Robinson et al., 1994) {{and may be}} found in its fine open-network cocoon on the plant <b>or</b> <b>amongst</b> debris on the ground (Common, 1990).|$|R
50|$|Due to {{the lack}} of {{consensus}} of almost all aspects of the astrological ages, except for the astrological ages relationship to precession of the equinoxes and the retrograde order of the astrological ages, there are alternative, esoteric, innovative, fringe and newly expressed ideas about the astrological ages which have not established credibility in the wider astrological community <b>or</b> <b>amongst</b> archeoastronomers.|$|R
