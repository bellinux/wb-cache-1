5|$|Himeji Castle {{dates to}} 1333, when Akamatsu Norimura built a fort {{on top of}} Himeyama hill. The fort was {{dismantled}} and rebuilt as Himeyama Castle in 1346, and then remodeled into Himeji Castle two centuries later. Himeji Castle was then significantly remodeled in 1581 by Toyotomi Hideyoshi, who added <b>a</b> <b>three-story</b> castle keep. In 1600, Tokugawa Ieyasu awarded the castle to Ikeda Terumasa for his help in the Battle of Sekigahara, and Ikeda completely rebuilt the castle from 1601 to 1609, expanding it into a large castle complex. Several buildings were later added to the castle complex by Honda Tadamasa from 1617 to 1618. For over 400 years, Himeji Castle has remained intact, even throughout the extensive bombing of Himeji in World War II, and natural disasters such as the 1995 Great Hanshin earthquake.|$|E
5|$|In February 1907, {{with nearly}} 300 new stockholders, Harvey began {{construction}} {{on his next}} hotel, Oklahoma Row, also designed by A. O. Clarke. It was built {{to the west of}} Missouri Row with a wide lawn. It had a similar log, concrete stone, and tile construction. The dining room was on the north end. Each of the 40 rooms had fireplaces, as did the dining room and center hall. Every room featured electric lights, sewerage, and running spring water. The hotel also boasted <b>a</b> <b>three-story</b> concrete tower, one of the earliest multistory concrete constructions in the country. Oklahoma Row and other construction projects drained Harvey's funds. Harvey managed to raise enough money to finish Oklahoma Row, but due to his lack of funds, when that hotel finally opened there was no gala event, as there had been when Missouri Row was finished.|$|E

5|$|Originally, the keeper's {{house had}} eight rooms, but it {{deteriorated}} and was rebuilt in 1858. When rebuilt it was one-and-a-half stories high and had three bedrooms, a kitchen, dining and sitting rooms. Construction quality was poor, allowing snow {{to enter the}} house during the winter through gaps in the walls and roof. In 1871, it was rebuilt by the United States Coast Guard as <b>a</b> <b>three-story</b> house, which remained until it was destroyed by fire on March 15, 1976. The fire also scorched the adjacent lighthouse. In the Spring 2002 edition of The Octagon, the keeper's house {{was said to be}} a two-story house with eleven rooms.|$|E
5|$|Spring Street, {{a typical}} {{commercial}} 19th century corridor, {{is the primary}} roadway within the district. Most buildings along Spring Street are Italianate and eclectic Victorian. The structure vary between two and three stories tall, with brick as the most common building material. The 100 block is the closest to the Ohio River and has seen the most demolition. It contains the Old Strauss Hotel {{at the corner of}} Riverside Drive, <b>a</b> <b>three-story</b> Italianate hostelry with a corbeled cornice and arched windows. The buildings on the 200 block are mostly Italianate style buildings, the most notable being the old Elk's Club structure (<b>a</b> <b>three-story</b> highly decorated glazed brick building) and the Bensinger's Building (a 1920s commercial building of pressed brick and crenelated parapet). There is more diverse architecture on the 300-block, with a 19th-century Masonic Temple, the LaRose Theatre (a 1920s orange glazed brick structure with terra cotta trim), Horner's Novelty (which had to be rebuilt after the worst fire in Jeffersonville's history), and Schimpff's Confectionery, a candy store that opened in 1891 that now also features a small candy museum. More Italianate structures are on the 400 block, but its most important structure is the 1907 Citizens National Bank Building, which is stone Classical Revival with large eagles for adornment. The block also holds the regional office for the local Boy Scouts of America council. Warder Park is located {{on the east side of}} the 500 block and features a Classical Revival Masonic Temple that used for most of the 20th Century.|$|E
5|$|Taiwan (Republic of China) {{reached an}} {{agreement}} with the U.S. to purchase 30 AH-64Es with weapons, and associated equipment in June 2011.

On 25 April 2014, a Taiwanese AH-64E crashed into <b>a</b> <b>three-story</b> building during a training flight in bad weather conditions, the first airframe loss of an AH-64E. An investigation ruled out mechanical failure and concluded human error as responsible, that the pilots descended too fast through clouds at low altitude without checking flight panels to maintain adequate height; the Army responded by stepping up simulator training for pilots. In October 2014, the fifth and final batch of AH-64Es was delivered to Taiwan, completing the order.|$|E

5|$|The {{buildings}} and land were auctioned off in July 1843 and purchased for £5,100 by W. G. Hicks, an ironmonger. The property {{consisted of the}} keeper's house, the canteen (known as a suttling house), the Admiralty section, the chapel, <b>a</b> <b>three-story</b> brick building and eight brick houses, all closed off from Borough High Street by iron gates. Imprisonment for debt was finally outlawed in England in 1869, except in cases of fraud or refusal to pay, and in the 1870s the Home Office demolished most of the prison buildings, though in 1955 parts of it were still in use by George Harding & Sons, hardware merchants.|$|E

5|$|Tulsa High School {{opened in}} 1906 {{on the same}} block {{formerly}} occupied by the Presbyterian mission school, which had been razed. The new school was <b>a</b> <b>three-story</b> cream colored brick building with a dome. The school was accredited by the North Central Association of Schools and Colleges in 1913. It proved too small by 1916, when Tulsa voters approved a bond issue to construct a new high school at Sixth Street and Cincinnati Avenue, which was renamed Central High School. The north half of this facility opened in 1917, while the south half opened in 1922. This building remained in this service until 1976, when it {{was replaced by a}} new building on West Edison Street. The old building was taken over by the Public Service Company of Oklahoma.|$|E
