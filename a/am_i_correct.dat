"The prosecution," [...] said he, [...] "has {{stated that}} the alleged robbery was {{committed}} at Vienna {{on the evening of}} September fifteenth, and that Jack Andrews arrived in America on the steamship Princess Irene on the afternoon of the January twenty-seventh following. <b>Am</b> <b>I</b> <b>correct</b> in those dates?" ...|$|E

"I am {{very curious}} {{to learn how}} you became aware of this oar, of the {{existence}} of which we of the museum were ignorant. <b>Am</b> <b>I</b> <b>correct</b> in assuming that you have read an account in some diary published later by this Daniel Foss?

6000|$|But {{just when}} he was saying this {{there was a knock}} at the door and Mrs. O'Halloran came in. I knew at once what she had come for, because she had been {{threatening}} to do it, and so I felt dreadfully nervous when she began to say that our bill at the house had gone unpaid too long and that we must pay her at once what we owed her. It took some time before Uncle William understood what she was talking about, but when he did he became dreadfully frigid and polite. He said, [...] "Let me understand clearly, madame, just what it is that you wish to say: do I apprehend that you are saying that my account here for our maintenance is now due and payable?" [...] Mrs. O'Halloran said yes, she was. And Uncle said, [...] "Let me endeavour to grasp your meaning exactly: <b>am</b> <b>I</b> <b>correct</b> in thinking that you mean I owe you money?" [...] Mrs. O'Halloran said that was what she meant. Uncle said, [...] "Let me try to apprehend just as accurately as possible what it is that you are trying to tell me: is my surmise correct that you are implying that it is time that I settled up my bill?" ...|$|E

6000|$|Now I do {{not pretend}} to be perfect myself. Heaven knows I have to {{struggle}} hard enough every day with what the Germans call my higher impulses. I know too well the temptation to be moral, to be self-sacrificing, to be loyal and patriotic, to be respectable and well-spoken of. But I wrestle with it and--as far as human fraility will allow--conquer it, whereas the German abandons himself to it without scruple or reflection, and is actually proud of his pious intemperance and self-indulgence. Nothing will cure him of this mania. It may end in starvation, crushing taxation, suppression of all freedom to try new social experiments and reform obsolete institutions, in snobbery, jobbery, idolatry, and an omnipresent tyranny in which his doctor and his schoolmaster, his lawyer and his priest, coerce him worse than any official or drill sergeant: no matter: it is respectable, says the German, therefore it must be good, and cannot be carried too far; and everybody who rebels against {{it must be a}} rascal. Even the Social-Democrats in Germany differ from the rest only in carrying academic orthodoxy beyond human endurance--beyond even German endurance. I am a Socialist and a Democrat myself, the hero of a hundred platforms, {{one of the leaders of}} the most notable Socialist organizations in England. I am as conspicuous in English Socialism as Bebel is in German Socialism; but do you suppose that the German Social-Democrats tolerate me? Not a bit of it. I have begged again and again to be taken to the bosom of my German comrades. I have pleaded that the Super-Proletarians of all lands should unite. I have pointed out that the German Social-Democratic party has done nothing at its Congresses for the last ten years except the things I told them to do ten years before, and that its path is white with the bones of the Socialist superstitions I and my fellow Fabians have slain. Useless. They do not care a rap whether I am a Socialist or not. All they want to know is; Am I orthodox? <b>Am</b> <b>I</b> <b>correct</b> in my revolutionary views? Am I reverent to the revolutionary authorities? Because I am a genuine free-thinker they look at me as a policeman looks at a midnight prowler or as a Berlin bourgeois looks at a suspicious foreigner. They ask [...] "Do you believe that Marx was omniscient and infallible; that Engels was his prophet; that Bebel and Singer are his inspired apostles; and that Das Kapital is the Bible?" [...] Hastening in my innocence to clear myself of what I regard as an accusation of credulity and ignorance, I assure them earnestly that I know ten times as much of economics and a hundred times as much of practical administration as Marx did; that I knew Engels personally and rather liked him as a witty and amiable old 1848 veteran who despised modern Socialism; that I regard Bebel and Singer as men of like passions with myself, but considerably less advanced; and that I read Das Kapital in the year 1882 or thereabouts, and still consider it one of the most important books of the nineteenth century because of its power of changing the minds of those who read it, in spite of its unsound capitalist economics, its parade of quotations from books which the author had either not read or not understood, its affectation of algebraic formulas, and its general attempt to disguise a masterpiece of propagandist journalism and prophetic invective as a drily scientific treatise of the sort that used to impose on people in 1860, when any book that pretended to be scientific was accepted as a Bible. In those days Darwin and Helmholtz were the real fathers of the Church; and nobody would listen to religion, poetry or rhetoric; so that even Socialism had to call itself [...] "scientific," [...] and predict the date of the revolution, as if it were a comet, by calculations founded on [...] "historic laws." ...|$|E

50|$|On {{his return}} to Kishinev, the capital of Bessarabia, South-Western Russia. He was a new man as he later {{described}} it: On Jerusalem’s Mount of Olives he made the matchless discovery that Jesus is Israel’s King and Messiah, the Brother of the Jews and thus {{the answer to the}} Jewish Question! The expression “our brother Jesus’ became a popular new way to describe how Jews began to look at Jesus. This phrase was later coined and used by the famous Jewish philosopher Martin Buber when he referred to Jesus as “my elder brother.” From that point on Rabinowitz’s new movement was called “Israelites of the New Covenant” and later on sometimes referred to as “Novi Israel” (New Israel), though this later name had been used to describe the movement founded by Priluker.What exactly happened to Rabinowitz {{when he was on the}} Mount of Olives as it is not clearly explained? <b>Am</b> <b>I</b> <b>correct</b> in referring to it as “a conversion” as said by some? The expression “conversion or convert” when this involves a Jew is very emotive and strongly suggests that the individual is no longer Jewish and has become a Christian, this is particularly so following baptism. However, Rabinowitz insisted that he still viewed himself as a Jew. What is clear is that his life was given a profound new turn on his return from Palestine to his native Russia. This had far reaching consequences not only for himself personally, effecting Jewish lives far and wide.Rabinowitz elaborated further on the revelation that he received on the Mount of Olives: “Suddenly a word from the New Testament, a word he had read 15 years before without heeding it, penetrated his heart like a flash of lightning: “If the Son shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed” (John 8.36). From that moment that Jesus is the King, the Messiah, who alone can save Israel, gained power over his soul. Deeply moved he immediately returned to his lodgings, seized the New Testament, and, while reading John’s Gospel, was struck by the words, “Without me ye can do nothing” (John 15.5). In that way by the providence of Almighty God, it came about that he was enlightened by the light of the Gospel. “Yeshua, Achinu” (Jesus our brother) was from then on his watchword, with which he returned to Russia” (p 19).This suggests to the listener that it was a sudden and unexpected conversion, a bit like Paul’s Damascus Road experience. We should also remember that included in Rabinowitz’s luggage was that New Testament in Hebrew that had been given him that he had included among his guide books. He said that it had been given him by another enlightened Jews back in Kishinev prior to his departure with the words of explanation that it may be helpful to him when he visits the Christian holy sites during his journey.|$|E
6000|$|This affectionate {{behaviour}} {{of my wife}} {{brought me}} {{a little out of}} the vapours, and I began to consider what <b>I</b> <b>was</b> doing; <b>I</b> <b>corrected</b> my wandering fancy, and began to argue with myself sedately, what business I had, after threescore years, and after such a life of tedious sufferings and disasters, and closed in so happy and easy a manner, I say, what business had I to rush into new hazards, and put myself upon adventures, fit only for youth and poverty to run into? ...|$|R

40|$|There is a {{trend to}} {{consider}} counterfactuals as invariably time-asymmetric. Recently, this trend manifested itself in the controversy about validity of counterfactual application of a time-symmetric quantum probability rule.
