5|$|The first {{bridge to}} be {{constructed}} was a three-arch stone bridge, {{which was built}} in 1746. It was destroyed by a heavy storm which caused the River Taff to flood about two years later. A large amount of debris came down the river, which then become trapped against the two abutments supporting the bridge. The weight and force of the debris ultimately destroyed the bridge, which was then swept <b>away</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> river.|$|E
5|$|The fox {{discovers the}} badger {{asleep in his}} bed, and {{originally}} plans to hit him, but decides against this due to the Badger's teeth. He decides to play a trick upon him involving a pail of water balanced on the overhead tester of the bed. Brock however is awake, escapes the trick, and makes tea for himself in the kitchen. Mr. Tod thinks the bucket has killed Tommy and decides to bury him in the tunnel the rabbits have dug, thinking Tommy dug it. When Mr. Tod discovers Tommy in the Kitchen and has tea thrown over him, a violent fight erupts that continues outdoors. The two roll <b>away</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> hill still fighting. Benjamin and Peter quickly gather the bunnies, and return home in triumph.|$|E
5|$|United {{then went}} back downfield and Ronaldo took on Lauren, who dared not dive in for a tackle and risk a second yellow card. Ronaldo got past the Cameroonian full-back and then chipped a cross into the penalty area, but Van Nistelrooy was unable to make enough contact with the ball to force his header on target. A minute later, Silvestre found Rooney with another {{diagonal}} pass; Rooney attempted to drive in a low cross, but it ended up heading towards goal and came back off {{the foot of the}} post. Fletcher was first to the ball but he fired a shot across the face of the goal and out for a goal kick. With their very next attack, United sent Ronaldo <b>away</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> left wing again; he sent over another cross, but it was again too far in front of Van Nistelrooy.|$|E

25|$|Singles {{were taken}} to end the over, but McGrath was to bowl the last over of the game, with England still needing ten to win. Things got easier for England when McGrath overstepped with the first ball of the over, Gough making contact and running the single to cut the target by two – the no-ball for {{overstepping}} and the run single – and the no-ball meant McGrath still had to bowl six balls in the over. Giles then played and missed, before hitting a single, and then Gough drove the two next balls to cover for two. Suddenly, England only needed three off two – and were, incredibly, in a winning position again. But Gough's next shot was right back to McGrath, who took it up well and tossed it at the stumps, running out Gough and meaning that McGrath would bowl to Ashley Giles – and England still required three to win. The ball hit Giles' pads, ran <b>away</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> off side, and Giles and Harmison ran all they could to scamper two leg byes – and tie the game.|$|E
25|$|He {{reached the}} Easter Cup final at Shelbourne {{and won the}} Spring Cup final at Harold's Cross Stadium and National Cup final at Shelbourne before {{travelling}} to England for the first time. In a solo trial prior to the 1929 English Greyhound Derby on 25 July, Mick broke the track record, reducing his odds from an initial 25–1 to becoming the 4–7 favorite to win {{by the time of}} the final, despite still being new off the board from Ireland. He was housed at the kennels of Paddy McEllistrim for the duration of the Derby. In the first round, Mick pulled <b>away</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> back straight, beating Captured Half by eight lengths and setting a time of 29.82, a new world record over that length. Father Browne sold Mick for £800, plus any prize money that the dog would win on the night, which at the time was more than the cost of buying a house in nearby Shepherd's Bush. By 8:45pm, when the final took place, some 40,000 spectators were in the ground. The lineup was four dogs; in trap one was Beadsman at 20–1; trap two was Palatinus at 3–1; trap three was Entomb at 9–2, and finally Mick the Miller in trap four, wearing the black jacket. Palatinus made the best start, at the first bend both Mick and Entomb attempted to move inside to the rail, but Beadsman collided with both of them, sending all three dogs sprawling. The no–race klaxon went off, and the race had to be restarted. None of the dogs was allowed to leave the track with until the race was re–run at 9:15pm, the only comfort given to Mick on a particularly hot summer's evening was a handkerchief soaked in cold water.|$|E
500|$|McClellan {{was also}} {{fortunate}} {{that the failure}} of the campaign left his army mostly intact, because he was generally absent from the fighting and neglected to name any second-in-command who might direct his retreat. Military historian Stephen W. Sears wrote, [...] "When he deserted his army on the Glendale and Malvern Hill battlefields during the Seven Days, he was guilty of dereliction of duty. Had the Army of the Potomac been wrecked on either of these fields (at Glendale the possibility had been real), that charge under the Articles of War would likely have been brought against him." [...] In the battle of Glendale, McClellan was five miles (8km) away behind Malvern Hill, without telegraph communications and too distant to command his army. In the battle of Malvern Hill, he was on a gunboat, the U.S.S. Galena, which at one point was ten miles (16km) <b>away,</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> James River. In both battles, effective command of the army fell to his friend and V Corps commander Brigadier General Fitz John Porter. [...] When the public heard about the Galena, it was yet another great embarrassment, comparable to the Quaker Guns at Manassas. Editorial cartoons published {{in the course of the}} 1864 presidential campaign lampooned McClellan for having preferred the safety of a ship while a battle was fought in the distance.|$|E

2500|$|... "The best try was the last, by Simon Poidevin. Picking up a loose pass under pressure, Gould fired a long, long pass to Ella, who {{somehow managed}} {{to pick it up}} at toenail height. In the same {{movement}} he sent David Campese <b>away</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> left wing. When challenged by the cover, Campese flicked an overhead pass to Poidevin, who was tailing faithfully on the inside. Poidevin strolled nonchalently over the line to touch down on the hallowed Twickenham turf. Lynagh converted to make the final score 19-3." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{spite of}} the [...] line speed and a man being sent back up the line to warn the second train, it did not stop before {{reaching}} the point where No.1 had lost the rack rail; {{exactly the same thing}} happened, with No.2 losing the rack rail and accelerating out of control. This time, however, the line was blocked by the carriages of the first train; No.2 hit these with some force, causing the carriages of the first train to drag their brakes and run <b>away</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> line, and causing the locomotive to drop back onto the rack rail and stop safely. The carriages from the first train rolled down the line to Clogwyn station, where they became derailed.|$|E
2500|$|Within {{the first}} minute of Darlington's first Football League match, {{at home to}} Halifax Town on 27 August 1921, Winship made a run down the left wing and crossed towards Bill Hooper, whose [...] "driving shot" [...] was [...] "in all probability" [...] the first goal scored in the new division. According to the Northern Echo, Winship was the best player on the field: [...] "time and again he got <b>away</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> wing and sent across some lovely centres". He {{provided}} numerous assists over the season, including one cross that confused Wrexham defenders into giving away an own goal, and scored goals as well, including two in a 7–3 defeat of Durham City, as Darlington finished in second place.|$|E

2500|$|Maclean {{wondered}} whether officials in Cairo [...] "quite realised {{the difficulties of}} travel in German-occupied Europe", when he was told in an official signal {{that he was to}} go to Cairo immediately but that the Partisan delegation could follow later if required... (it turned out that the British delegation was returning from the conference at Teheran via Cairo). While <b>away</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> coast Maclean was amazed to receive a garbled message from Cairo, with a clear sentence [...] "King now in Cairo, Will be dropped to you at first opportunity." [...] He thought that as part of London's gradual rapprochement policy between King Peter of Yugoslavia and the Partisans, the King was to be [...] "dropped headlong into the seething centre of the Jugoslav cauldron." [...] Later he was told that the message referred to their new signals officer, whose surname was King.|$|E
2500|$|... "I {{went to see}} {{quite a lot of}} them" [...] , [...] "I mean I {{went back}} to the villages, and saw what I had done. I used to go painting, as you know, when I had any time off, and I went to one village in Normandy, and painted it, because I had picked it {{particularly}} and it was a waste of time, because everybody" [...] "had got through," [...] " [...] and I found what I had thought in the rubble were a whole row of footballs, and they weren't footballs - I was sitting right beside them, painting - and they weren't footballs, they were children's heads, and what it was, I discovered later, was a whole school of kids, a convent, had been pulled out of school, out of class, and lined up in this little narrow alleyway between the buildings to save them from the bombing, and the whole thing had come in on top of them, plus the nuns, but by that time [...] they were lice-ridden, and there was nothing. I can talk about it now at 65 because it's sort of, dispassionate about it, and I've seen worse things since, but that gave me a bit of a turn, yes, I didn't enjoy that. A row of kid's heads that you thought were footballs and you kick one and it wasn't, and it rolled <b>away</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> rubble." ...|$|E
