500|$|Ahead of the 2012–13 Premier League season, Barton was {{not given}} a squad number by QPR. Towards {{the end of the}} season, however, {{chairman}} Tony Fernandes identified the loss of Barton as a factor in the club's poor performance and relegation from the Premier League, saying: [...] "We missed Joey.

500|$|In {{the late}} 1950s and early 1960s Kirchherr and her art school friends were {{involved}} in the European existentialist movement whose followers were later nicknamed [...] "Exis" [...] by Lennon. In 1995 she told BBC Radio Merseyside: [...] "Our philosophy then, because we were only little kids, was wearing black clothes and going around looking moody. Of course, we hadn't a clue who Jean-Paul Sartre was. We got inspired by all the French artists and writers, because that was the closest we could get. England was so far away, and America was out of the question. So France was the nearest. So we got all the information from France, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> dress like the French existentialists... We wanted to be free, we wanted to be different, and tried to be cool, as we call it now." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1995, Lofton {{was one of}} six Indians' {{starters}} who batted [...]300 {{or higher}} (.310). He also had an MLB-best 13 triples. His 54 stolen bases led the AL {{for the third consecutive}} season. The Indians faced the Seattle Mariners in the 1995 ALCS. In the eighth inning of Game Six, Lofton had an infield bunt, stole second base, and scored from second on a passed ball between pitcher Randy Johnson and catcher Dan Wilson. The Indians won the game 40. It was described by The New York Times as [...] "the run that demoralized the Mariners." [...] Fifteen years after Lofton's crossing of home plate, the Plain Dealer recalled: [...] "Of all the electrifying moments on the Kenny Lofton highlight reel, none captures the essence of the player any better than his 180-foot dash to glory on October 17, 1995." [...] As a result of winning the game, the Indians had won the ALCS and in so doing, Lofton and the Indians had brought the AL pennant to Cleveland {{for the first time since}} the 1954 season. [...] "I'm glad for the city of Cleveland to be able to experience this, because they haven't experience this for a long time. The city of Cleveland has grown a lot, and it's improving, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> do this for the city", Lofton said. The Indians lost the World Series to the Braves in six games despite finishing the regular season with a major league-best 10044 record in the strike-shortened year. Lofton finished with a [...]200 batting average and six stolen bases in his first World Series appearance. In 2010, a few years into his retirement, Lofton stated he felt it was the toughest post-season loss of his 11 career playoff appearances, namely because he felt the umpires had favorable strike zones for Braves pitchers Tom Glavine and Greg Maddux.|$|E

500|$|While {{calling into}} WVEE during their {{interview}} with Ciara and Polow da Don, Hilson said, [...] "I {{just want to}} tell Ciara it’s not about you. People are just reading way too far into it. People take things and make it what they want it to be. It wasn’t taking shots at nobody." [...] I just want to let Atlanta know and Ciara know that this is a true leak. I did, and I don't know if Polow said this on the radio, but I did fight this coming out. I didn't want this coming out because we played it for people when I did it and that's what people said it was about; they started throwing out names. We were like 'No, it's not about that' <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> let them know what it was really about. But the fact that people brought back names, it was like ok, that wasn't the reaction we need, so I told Polow, 'let's not do this and he agreed". Ciara happened to call in during the time period and said she was happy of where Hilson was at in her career, to which Hilson responded the same, saying how proud she was, and [...] "watching her from ground zero." [...] Hilson went on to state she was not jealous of anyone's career, noting how all female R artists are the same, pointing out that [...] "Keyshia’s on my album. I’ve worked with Ciara many times. I’m a fan of Beyoncé’s." [...] When asked exactly who the song is about, Hilson said the targets knew who they were, responding, [...] "It’s anybody that ever tried to take me down and didn’t want to see me succeed. I’m not gonna call their names because I feel I’ve addressed it." [...] She further clarified, commenting [...] "I will say this, my journey has been 12 years long and there have been many people, specifically girls, and it really just isn't one person, it's been a lot of people." ...|$|E

2500|$|Fran Walsh {{suggested}} to Peter Jackson (who was noted for horror-comedy films) that they write {{a film about}} the notorious Parker-Hulme murder. Jackson took the idea to his long-time collaborator, producer Jim Booth (who died after filming).

[...] "The friendship was for the most part a rich and rewarding one, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> honour that in the film. It was our intention to make a film about a friendship that went terribly wrong," [...] said Peter Jackson.|$|E

2500|$|Passengers were in {{the dining}} hall {{when there was a}} sudden, loud bang, which a crew member (speaking over the intercom) {{ascribed}} to an [...] "electrical failure". [...] "We told the guests everything was [...] and under control <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> stop them panicking", a cabin steward recalled. Coincidentally, when the ship first made impact with the rock, it was claimed that Titanics theme song [...] "My Heart Will Go On" [...] was playing in a restaurant. The ship lost cabin electrical power shortly after the initial collision. [...] "The boat started shaking. The noise—there was panic, like in a film, dishes crashing to the floor, people running, people falling down the stairs," [...] said a survivor. Those on board said the ship suddenly tilted to the port side. Passengers were later advised to put on their life jackets.|$|E
2500|$|In September 1985, the El Greco was {{carefully}} carved into four pieces and hauled {{from its original}} site in Westwood to its new location in the Beverly-Fairfax district. [...] Architect Peter de Bretteville, {{who was in charge}} of the move and refurbishment, noted: [...] "The difficult relocation was accomplished by dividing the apartment into four separate sections, preserving all of the structure's Spanish roof tiles and other elements of the charming brick and tile courtyard, including its central fish pond, which was recreated to its original appearance on the new site. [...] The haul from Westwood required a great deal of preparation on the site, careful planning and finally settling of the structure on the new site. [...] We worked within certain budget constraints <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> intrude as little as possible on the structure itself. [...] I believe we came up with a good compromise." [...] When the old structure was removed, construction began on a new $7.5 million, 112-unit apartment complex on the original site.|$|E
2500|$|In February 2014, it was {{reported}} that Sony Pictures Worldwide Acquisitions had bought the rights to the film under the Stage 6 Films banner, with Michael London and his company Groundswell Productions producing the feature. The film was originally picked up by New Line Cinema in November 2011, but the script was shopped elsewhere when production did not get off the ground. The screenplay was written by Joshua John Miller and M.A. Fortin, and was directed by Todd Strauss-Schulson. Miller's father, Jason Miller, was an actor and writer who appeared as Father Karras in The Exorcist. The script for The Final Girls was in part inspired by The Exorcist, with Miller pointing out, [...] "I grew up watching my dad in The Exorcist, and there's something haunting, strange, confusing, and a little bit unnatural to see your parent constantly die in a film. But it's something that also becomes iconic, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> deconstruct what the effects of that would be, as well as {{what it would be like}} if you had a second chance, but your second chance was inside of a movie?"

2500|$|... "I think {{having a}} pilot's licence helped a little bit. One of my road crew said {{we found this}} guy that {{used to work in}} the circus and he does a lot of things for TV and special effects and he's made {{something}} that might interest you, it's a piano that spins round, and I immediately responded, oh that sounds interesting. I happened to be within the New York area and I was driven over to Long Island to a guy called Bob McCarthy, and there in the background he had this piano situated. So he called his wife down from upstairs and said, darling could you demonstrate this for Keith? I looked on, I wasn't quite sure what to expect. His wife comes down and sits on the seat and up she goes in the air and proceeds to spin around. I thought, well that's great! Then Bob asked me, {{do you want to have}} a go at it?... Yea, okay. You need to understand, below the keyboard there's an inverted-tee, like a bar. You wrap your legs around the down pipe and put your heels under the inverted-tee. Then you go up in the air and try and do your best to play. It was a little difficult to play at first because of the centrifugal force, so it wasn't easy. I think we actually used it for the first time at Madison Square Garden, it was a Christmas concert. People in the audience were so astounded they couldn't quite believe what they were seeing. Later on that coming year the California Jam came up and I said we have to do that there. Bob drove the whole contraption down to the California Jam and there was very little space to set it up. There were loads of bands up on that stage, all having to do their set and then getting their equipment off. Now, with the moog, the Hammonds, Carl's gongs and everything, it was hard enough to just get that off stage. We had the spinning piano and everything that went along with it <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> find a place to situate it. It ended up going just at the end of the stage, so when the piano went up it was literally over the heads of the audience. After that every TV show I did came the question... Keith, how do you spin around on that piano? I'd say what about my music? When I had the honor of meeting the great jazz pianist Dave Brubeck just before he died, he said, Keith you've got to tell me how do you spin around on that piano? Dave Brubeck was 90 years old then and I said, 'Dave, don't try it!'" ...|$|E
