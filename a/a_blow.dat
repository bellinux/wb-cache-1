5|$|Anne {{was born}} on 12 December 1574 at the castle of Skanderborg on the Jutland Peninsula in the Kingdom of Denmark. Her birth came as <b>a</b> <b>blow</b> to her father, King Frederick II of Denmark, who was desperately hoping for a son. But her mother, Sophie of Mecklenburg-Güstrow, was only 17; three years later she did bear Frederick a son, the future Christian IV of Denmark.|$|E

5|$|As his hunger became intolerable, Periyar {{was forced}} to feed on {{leftovers}} from the streets. Around this time, he realised that the eatery which had refused him entry was built by a wealthy non-Brahmin from South India. This discriminatory attitude dealt <b>a</b> <b>blow</b> to Periyar's regard for Hinduism, for the events he had witnessed at Kasi were completely different from the picture of Kasi he had in mind, as a holy place which welcomed all. Ramasami was a theist until his visit to Kasi, after which his views changed and he became an atheist.|$|E
5|$|As if {{struck by}} <b>a</b> <b>blow,</b> one {{suddenly}} recognizes the scientific futility, the biological senselessness, {{and the social}} noxiousness of views and institutions, which until that moment had seemed altogether natural and self-evident. It {{is a kind of}} eschatological experience so frequently encountered in a pathological form in schizophrenics. I might even voice the belief that the schizophrenic form of psychic illness is regularly accompanied by illuminating insight into the irrationalism of social and political mores.|$|E

5|$|British {{military}} leadership, {{which had}} been decisive up to Brock's death, suffered <b>a</b> <b>blow</b> with his loss. His direct successor, Major-General Sheaffe, although successful in his approach at Queenston Heights, {{was never able to}} live up to Brock's reputation. He was criticised by many, including John Strachan, for his retreat at the Battle of York, and was shortly after recalled to England, where he continued a successful, if not brilliant, military career.|$|E
5|$|Darlington's {{promotion}} campaign was dealt <b>a</b> <b>blow</b> in February 2009, when club chairman George Houghton placed {{the club in}} administration. As a result, the club were deducted 10points, a penalty from which they could not recover finally finishing 12th. Burgmeier finished with two goals during the season having played 35games, but {{like the rest of}} the playing squad, was told he could find a new club by Darlington's administrators.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{being more}} popular than some men's {{football}} events (one match saw a 53,000 strong crowd), women's football in England suffered <b>a</b> <b>blow</b> in 1921 when The Football Association outlawed the playing of the game on Association members' pitches, {{on the grounds that}} the game (as played by women) was distasteful. Some speculated that this may have also been due to envy of the large crowds that women's matches attracted. This led to the formation of the English Ladies Football Association and play moved to rugby grounds.|$|E
50|$|A {{foaming agent}} is a {{material}} that facilitates formation of foam {{such as a}} surfactant or <b>a</b> <b>blowing</b> agent. <b>A</b> surfactant, when present in small amounts, reduces surface tension of a liquid (reduces the work needed to create the foam) or increases its colloidal stability by inhibiting coalescence of bubbles. <b>A</b> <b>blowing</b> agent is <b>a</b> gas that forms the gaseous part of the foam.|$|R

The plan was to have Lee surface just behind Eagles rudder and use a screw to attach an explosive to the ship’s hull. Once attached, Lee would re-enter the water and make his getaway.|$|E

5|$|In 1786, Hope's career {{suffered}} <b>a</b> <b>blow</b> when he {{was stationed}} aboard the frigate HMS Pegasus, commanded by Prince William Henry. Hope and Prince William fell out badly and {{in less than a}} year Hope had been transferred to the frigate HMS Boreas, at that time commanded by Captain Horatio Nelson, with whom Hope had good relations. Two years later, Hope was transferred to HMS Adamant at the request of Sir Richard Hughes. When Hughes reached flag rank in 1790 whilst stationed in Newfoundland, he promoted Hope to commander and gave him command of Adamant.|$|E

5|$|In a {{political}} and economic referendum held in November 1987, 67% of the eligible voters participated {{and most of them}} approved the government-proposed reforms, but a popular mandate was formally missed because of the unrealistically stringent passage requirements self-imposed by the regime.
