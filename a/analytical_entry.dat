40|$|In {{this article}} we take up a {{critique}} of the concept of Communities of Practice (CoP) voiced by several authors, who suggest that networks may provide a better metaphor to understand social forms of organisation and learning. Through a discussion of the notion of networked learning and the critique of CoPs we shall argue that the metaphor or theory of networked learning is itself confronted with some central tensions and challenges that need to be addressed. We then explore these theoretical and analytical challenges to the network metaphor, through an analysis of a Danish social networking site.

We argue that such investigations are crucial in informing our understandings of how digital data become meaningful in mundane contexts of everyday life for two reasons: first because there is a gap in our understanding of the contingencies and specificities through which big digital data sets are produced, and second because designers and policy makers often seek to make interventions for change in everyday contexts through the presentation of mundane data to consumers but with little understanding of how people produce, experience and engage with these data...|$|E

40|$|Is {{international}} criminal law adequate in respect of ‘economic abuses’ such as corporate complicity in human rights abuses or harm arising through the exploitation of resources from conflict-affected areas? Attempts to assess the adequacy of {{international criminal}} law to deal with ‘economic abuses’ {{have given rise to}} a complex and multi-layered debate. Authors have analysed a range of different phenomena, making it challenging to generalise conclusions on the suitability of existing {{international criminal law}}. Against this background, it is crucial to distinguish different types of ‘economic abuses’ if we are to assess the adequacy of international criminal law to address them. To do so, I propose a three-dimensional model to disentangle the various categories of ‘economic abuses’. Depending on whether the actor, the harmful activity, and the affected legal interests are economic or non-economic, legally distinct types of ‘economic abuses’ can be discerned. Through exploring three specific constellations, the article demonstrates that the adequacy of international criminal law varies significantly for the various types of ‘economic abuses’. The model aims to serve as an <b>analytical</b> <b>entry</b> point to distinguish {{the nature and extent of}} the legal challenges in a factual scenario and contributes to the elaboration of nuanced and meaningful conclusions on the relative adequacy of international criminal law in relation to ‘economic abuses’...|$|E
40|$|This paper evaluates self-tracking {{practices}} {{in connection with}} ideas of objectivity via exploration of confrontations with personal data, particularly with reference to physiological stress and recovery measurements. The discussion departs from the notion of ‘mechanical objectivity’, seeking to obtain evidence that is ‘uncontaminated by interpretation’. The framework of mechanical objectivity tends, however, to fall short when people translate physiological measurements to fit their expectations and everyday experiences. We develop the concept of ‘situated objectivity’ {{with the goal of}} highlighting the everyday as a domain of interpretation, reflection and ambiguity, proposing that the concept offers an <b>analytical</b> <b>entry</b> point to a more profound understanding of how people engage with their personal data. Everyday data encounters are not methodical and systematic, but combine knowledge in an eclectic manner. Framed in this way, self-tracking practices are less occupied with ‘facts of life’ than translating and transforming life based on earlier experiences, cultural understandings and shared expectations. Paradoxically, new measurement devices and software, which are supposed to be based on sound, universal and generalisable principles, hard facts and accurate descriptions, become raw material for daily decisions, as people seek bespoke answers and craft personalised theories of health and life. From this perspective, self-tracking measurements can be used to experiment and learn, gaining value in relation to the communicative processes that they promote and contributing to possibilities for rethinking health knowledge and health promotion...|$|E
40|$|Both {{the authors}} contributed equally. Abstract Epigenetics {{is one of}} the most rapidly {{expanding}} fields in the life sciences. Its rise is frequently framed as a revolutionary turn that heralds a new epoch both for gene-based episte-mology and for the wider discourse on life that pervades knowledge-intensive societies of the molecular age. The fundamentals of this revolution remain however to be scrutinized, and indeed the very contours of what counts as ‘epigenetic ’ are often blurred. This is reflected also in the mounting discourse on the societal implications of epigenetics, in which vast expectations coexist with significant uncertainty about what aspects of this science are most relevant for politics or policy alike. This is therefore a suitable time to reflect on the directions that social theory could most productively take in the scrutiny of this revolution. Here we take this opportunity in both its scholarly and normative dimension, that is, proposing a roadmap for social theorizing on epige-netics that does not shy away from, and indeed hopefully guides, the framing of its most socially relevant outputs. To this end, we start with an epistemological reappraisal of epigenetic discourse that valorizes the blurring of meanings as a critical asset for the field and privileged <b>analytical</b> <b>entry</b> point.

Central to these deeply intertwined processes are tourism imaginaries, understood as rep-resentational systems that mediate reality and form identities, and their (re) production by local tour guides, key agents in the selling and telling of natural and cultural heritage. Drawing on 25 months of multi-sited and multi-temporal fieldwork in Yogyakarta, Indonesia, and Arusha, Tanzania, the presented research addresses the following issues: (1) the representation of peoples and places in globally circulating tourism imaginaries; (2) the formal schooling and informal learning of local tour guides to appropriate images and dis-courses of tourism; (3) the (re) production and contestation of fashionable tourism imagery in guiding narratives and practices; and (4) the ways in which dominant imaginaries and personal imaginations of tourism stakeholders are (dis) connected. The methodology used, labelled as “glocal ethnography”, involves a mixed-methods approach including extensive observation, interviews, questionnaires, and the collection of secondary data. The comparative and discourse-centred analysis of the data reveals how local guides in Yogyakarta and Arusha act as “mechanics of glocalization”, assuring the continued circulation and localization of tourism fantasies, but also using the encounter with foreigners to foment their own imaginations of “paradise on earth” and to accumulate cosmopolitan knowledge. These findings add not only to the current theorizing on tour guiding and tourism, they demonstrate the potential of glocal ethnography as a methodology to move studies of transnational phenomena from mere description or critique to grounded holistic analyses that unravel the complex human mechanisms underlying glocalization. The study’s focus on the human aspects of globalization, on cosmopolitanism and “cosmobility”, and on the role of the imaginary in giving people’s lives meaning, illustrates some creative ways in which anthropologies of mobility can contribute to ongoing theoretical and methodological debates about the local-to-global nexus.

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{political}} struggles that followed after {{the appearance of}} irregular migrants in Sweden. The analysis starts from {{the assumption that the}} group’s precarious circumstances of living disrupted the understanding of Sweden as an inclusive society and shed light on the limits of the welfare state’s inclusionary ambitions. The overarching <b>analytical</b> point of <b>entry</b> is accordingly that the appearance of irregular migrants constitutes an opening for contestation of the demarcation of the welfare state. The analysis draws on two strands of theory to explore this opening. Citizenship theory, first, provides insights about the contradictory logics of the welfare state, i. e. the fact that it rests on norms of equality and inclusion {{at the same time as}} it is premised on a fundamental exclusion of non-members. Discourse theory, furthermore, is brought in to make sense of the potential for contestation. The study approaches these struggles over demarcation through an analysis of the debates and claims-making that took place in the Swedish parliament between 1999 and 2014. The focal point of the analysis is the efforts to make sense of and respond to the predicament of the group. The study shows that efforts to secure rights and inclusion for the group revolved around two demands. The first demand, regularisation, aimed to secure rights for irregular migrants through status, i. e. through the granting of residence permits, whereas the second demand, access to social rights, aimed to secure rights through turning the group into right-bearers in the welfare state. The thesis concludes that the debates and claims-making during the 2000 s resulted in a small, but significant, shift in policy. In 2013, new legislation was adopted that granted irregular migrants access to schooling and health- and medical care. I argue that this was an effect of successful campaigning that managed to establish these particular rights as human rights, and as such, rights that should be provided to all residents regardless of legal status. Overall, however, I conclude that there has been an absence of more radical contestation of the citizenship order, and of accompanying notions of rights and entitlement, in the debates studied...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we focus on}} how models carry out {{correlations}} and how correlations are used as techniques of government. Correlations are fragile exercises which put together two phenomenon, e. g. one nanoparticle and one toxic effect, without linking them with a straight causality. We examine correlations in the situated case of QSAR (quantitative structure-activity relationship) models applied to the toxicity of nanoparticles. Using scientific and regulatory documentation related to QSAR, and the preliminary results of an empirical study of a QSAR project conducted in France, we analyze the initial expectations, i. e. providing knowledge on nanoparticles useful for regulatory purposes, and how this ambition was confronted to the refusal of nanoparticles to feed the QSAR models in a satisfying way. We argue that this led to "thinking on the edge" the wonders and worries of correlation. This calls for a pragmatics of correlation: what does it do? Which are the effects and consequences of a "co-relating" approach? Exploring these questions leads us to examine the type of knowledge produced through models applied to large sets of data, and how it contributes to certain types of regulatory objectivity, particularly in the European legal context. Thus, we discuss {{the ways in which}} a pragmatics of correlation offers <b>analytical</b> <b>entry</b> points {{for the study of the}} contemporary transformation of the public administration of technical objects. ...|$|E

Innovation do not only consider product, but also the way stakeholders are involved and willing to co-create the destination into a dynamic way. This shift generates new and complex interactions between different players and worth to be analysed. Design/methodology/approach: For most of tourist destination, the challenge is to rely on tourism whilst simultaneously to deepen the economic and social fundaments by introducing new functions. The cluster analyse seems to be a good <b>analytical</b> <b>entry</b> to challenge this shift. Theory explains us more “why” a cluster, eventually with “whom” but barely “how” to become a cluster. Findings: We present the concept of "tourism cluster" as a mode of organisation, not as a governance system. In that sense, it is a form of innovation. We also demonstrate that the tourism cluster is the way to develop linkages between tourism and related and local sectors backward and forward (education, health, agriculture, creative and smart industries, commerce and advanced services, etc.). However, every destination may not ne elected as a cluster. Other possibilities can occur. That is what we call the "clusterisation process" that relies on a deep cooperation between actors.

40|$|Recognizing the {{extraordinary}} advances in knowledge of Africa {{over the past}} fifty years, this paper takes the intimate linkages between popular cultural representations of and international tourism to sub-Saharan Africa as an <b>analytical</b> <b>entry</b> to assess the influence of African Studies outside academia. The various ways in which African peoples and places are pictured and documented in mass media have an immense impact on how tourists imagine and anticipate their future African destinations. Based on archival research and ethnographic fieldwork, this paper illustrates the dynamic processes of cultural tourismification in northern Tanzania. In {{many parts of the}} world, famous nature documentaries, mainstream Hollywood entertainment, and semi-biographic films about this region have become fashionable icons for sub-Saharan Africa as a whole, often reinforcing a nostalgic vision of the black continent as an unexplored and time-frozen wild Eden. While tourism representations have overwhelmingly focused on wildlife, a growing demand for meet-the-people tourism is increasingly bringing ethnic groups into the picture. Interestingly, these African people are commonly represented and presenting themselves while engaging in vibrant rituals or in staged poses wearing celebrative costumes. This paper illustrates how the romanticized image of the virile Maasai warrior, dressed in colorful red blankets and beaded jewelry, has led to a true Maasai-mania that is profoundly affecting the daily life and culture of Maasai and other groups. The paper discusses the role of African Studies in cultural tourismification and reflects on the responsibility of Africanists in publicly correcting stereotypical images, discredited histories, and romantic fantasies of Africa. status: publishe...|$|E

A multiperspectival approach to journalistic stance : from ontology to methodology [...] Chapter 4. Methodology : corpus construction [...] Chapter 5.

This research probes into {{the concept of}} journalistic stance by defining it as a nexus of social practice rather than simply linguistic realizations. Journalistic stance has been investigated by drawing on an ontological approach – a multiperspectival approach – to language in social life. This multiperspectival approach holds that analysing discourse/language in social life (e. g. journalistic stance taking practices) needs to incorporate semiotic analysis of discursive performances on site (e. g. the discursive aspect of journalistic stance); ethnographically grounded examination of social, institutional and professional practices and interaction order (e. g. the social-institutional aspect of journalistic stance); accumulated accounts of discursive practices by ratified members of the communities of practice under investigation (e. g. the cognitive or personal aspect of journalistic stance); and explicit reveal of analysts’ motivational relevancies and practice relevance in relation to participants’ perspectives. News writing constitutes the central daily social practice of journalism practitioners. Hence, this research takes the discursive aspect of journalistic stance in news texts as the <b>analytical</b> point of <b>entry</b> into understanding the ways journalistic stances are enacted in Chinese and Australian print media hard news reporting. The discursive aspect of journalistic stance is problematized {{with the assistance of}} newly built Chinese and Australian corpora of hard news reporting in relation to discourses of Risk. The APPRAISAL framework has been adopted in the identification of stance markers in news texts. The social-institutional and (inter) personal aspects of journalistic stance have been examined with insights gained from participant observation in news institutions to understand news production processes. Emphasis has been placed on the articulation of news values and the exercise of symbolic power in each context of news production. This research has found an intimate relationship between the discursive articulation of stance patterns in news texts, the production and reproduction of prioritized news values and power relations in Chinese and Australian news discourses. Mediating positive affect and judgement of social esteem of Chinese authorities in communicating risks is more preferable in the Chinese press. In contrast, the Australian press prefer to mediate negative affect of those individuals influenced by risk events in question but Australian journalists are less likely to provoke judgement of news actors than their Chinese peers. Chinese and Australian journalists undertake different stances in mediating different voices in risk communication. Chinese journalists tend to close down the dialogic space for alternative voices when mediating official sources, whereas they tend to open up the dialogic space when mediating news maker voices. In the Australian press, the dialogic space of the official voice is opened up {{as much as it is}} closed down. However, the analysis of attesting sources (e. g. eyewitness sources) has shown that Australian journalists are hardly on site in reporting risk events, but that Chinese journalists are often on site and eyewitness the happening of risk events. Australian journalists rely heavily on official and organizational sources, whereas Chinese journalists rely on their own authorial voice. The analysis of news values has demonstrated that the news value of positivity is rather marginal in the Australian press, but that it constitutes a significant news value in the Chinese press. The other news value that has been prioritized in the Chinese press is that of personalization (e. g. the human interest aspect of an event or issue). These two news values – positivity and personalization – have been prioritized consistently in the Chinese press, because they are always highlighted in policy documents in news institutions, in daily editorial meetings, in Chinese journalists’ perception of news values and projected on stance patterns in news texts. The power relations and hegemony were (re) produced in each context of news discourse in different ways. Although Chinese press have been undergoing reform towards marketization, the Communist Party of China still keeps the Chinese press firmly on leash by manipulating the distribution of economic and symbolic capital. With four significant newspaper owners overall (News Corp, Fairfax, Seven West Media Limited, and APN News & Media), Australia has one of the most highly concentrated newspaper ownership in the developed world beyond the Party-controlled papers of the communist realm. Despite such a high concentration of press ownership, Australia is known for its belief in and pursuit of media diversity. One basic means to ensure media diversity is to make available to all Australians access to a diversity of media voices in the course of sustaining an effective engagement of people in the democratic discourses. However, while the Chinese press perpetuate the ideology of the government, the Australian press are dominated by the commercial ideology of media proprietors. In other words, to accumulate economic profits in the Chinese press constitutes a significant means to achieve the end of political control of ideology in news production. In contrast, to switch between different political ideologies constitutes a significant means for the Australian press to achieve the end of maximizing economic profits for media proprietors. The research findings are of relevance to a wide range of researchers such as discourse analysts in the field of news discourse and other scholars whose research is relevant to stance/evaluation, or those engaged in corpus-informed studies, along with those in the field journalism and communication.

This paper considers how a refusal of the nation as political community and a questioning of the state as guarantor of rights and responsibilities reconfigure our understandings of citizenship. We do this by taking as a metaphor and <b>analytical</b> <b>entry</b> point an art installation developed by artist Tomás Saraceno titled 14 Billions (Working Title). Forming an exaggerated version of a black widow spider’s web, this installation offers us a way of engaging politics in relational terms. Inspired by this installation, we ask: how are the categories of citizenship and community troubled or reconfigured when we address sociality and politics from a relational perspective? In which ways does 14 Billions prompt us to address questions of spatiality, power, coexistence, and contestation differently from those accounts of citizenship that remain wedded to the state as a contained geographical unit and to the nation as an imaginary of political community? And finally, how might this web installation suggest an intervention into the broader problematic of ‘citizenship without community’ that forms the focus of this theme issue? We address these questions by way of an engagement with the ‘lines’, ‘gaps’, and ‘tension points’ presented by 14 Billions and argue that an understanding of citizenship as based upon membership appears inadequate when we address politics through a web. In so doing, we contend that the provocation of citizenship without community presents a challenge that does not simply demand a shift from the nation to the state or the reaffirmation of a rights-bearing subject; rather, this provocation leads us to argue that politics involves more than a search for inclusion and recognition, whilst the web installation offers us a way in to thinking about politics through heterogeneous sites and moments of encounte...|$|E
40|$|Epigenetics {{is one of}} {{the most}} rapidly {{expanding}} fields in the life sciences. Its rise is frequently framed as a revolutionary turn that heralds a new epoch both for gene-based epistemology and for the wider discourse on life that pervades knowledge-intensive societies of the molecular age. The fundamentals of this revolution remain however to be scrutinized, and indeed the very contours of what counts as ‘epigenetic’ are often blurred. This is reflected also in the mounting discourse on the societal implications of epigenetics, in which vast expectations coexist with significant uncertainty about what aspects of this science are most relevant for politics or policy alike. This is therefore a suitable time to reflect on the directions that social theory could most productively take in the scrutiny of this revolution. Here we take this opportunity in both its scholarly and normative dimension, that is, proposing a roadmap for social theorizing on epigenetics that does not shy away from, and indeed hopefully guides, the framing of its most socially relevant outputs. To this end, we start with an epistemological reappraisal of epigenetic discourse that valorizes the blurring of meanings as a critical asset for the field and privileged <b>analytical</b> <b>entry</b> point. We then propose three paths of investigation. The first looks at the structuring elements of controversies and visions around epigenetics. The second probes the mutual constitution between the epigenetic reordering of living phenomena and the normative settlements that orient individual and collective responsibilities. The third highlights the material import of epigenetics and the molecularization of culture that it mediates. We suggest that these complementary strands provide both an epistemically and socially self-reflective framework to advance the study of epigenetics as a molecular juncture between nature and nurture and thus as the new critical frontier in the social studies of the life sciences...|$|E
40|$|In {{an attempt}} to provide an <b>analytical</b> <b>entry</b> point into my {{compositional}} practice, I have identified eight themes which are significantly recurrent: reduction – {{the selection of a}} small number of elements; imperfection – a damaged or warped characteristic of sound; hierarchy – a concern with the roles of instruments with regard to their relative prominence; motion – apparently static sound masses consist of fine internal movement; listener perception – expectations for change influence the experience of affect; translation – the transitioning of electronic sounds to the acoustic realm, and vice versa; immersion – the creation of an accommodating soundscape; blurring – smearing and overlapping sounds or genres. Each of these eight factors is associated with relevant precedents in the history and theory of music that have been influential on my work. These include the minimalist compositions of Steve Reich and Arvo Pärt; the lo-fi aesthetic of Boards of Canada and My Bloody Valentine; concerns with political hierarchy in the work of Louis Andriessen; the variations of dynamics and microtonal shifts of Giacinto Scelsi; Leonard B. Meyer 2 ̆ 7 s account of expectation in music; cross-fertilisation of the acoustic and electronic in pieces by Gérard Grisey and Gyorgy Ligeti; the immersive technique of Brian Eno 2 ̆ 7 s ambient music; and the overlapping sounds of Aphex Twin. These eight factors are variously applicable to the eleven submitted pieces, which are individually analysed with reference to the most significant of the categories. Together they form a musical language that sustains the interaction of a variety of techniques, concepts and genres. Compositions included are "escalate", "Requiescat", "Forth", "For de ereprijs", "Evolution of close double stars", "Stórr", "Miniatus", "Suaimhneas", "Rotation of the Earth", "String Trio No. 1 ", "The Passion of Joan of Arc...|$|E
