5|$|Reviewers {{noted that}} the book took on a darker tone than its predecessors, though it did contain some humour. Some {{considered}} the main themes to be love and death, and trust <b>and</b> <b>redemption.</b> The character development of Harry and several other teenage characters was also remarked upon.|$|E

5|$|Hosseini has {{commented that}} he {{considers}} The Kite Runner to be a father–son story, emphasizing the familial {{aspects of the}} narrative, an element that he continued to use in his later works. Themes of guilt <b>and</b> <b>redemption</b> feature prominently in the novel, with a pivotal scene depicting an act of violence against Hassan that Amir fails to prevent. The {{latter half of the}} book centers on Amir's attempts to atone for this transgression by rescuing Hassan's son over two decades later.|$|E
5|$|Morrison {{abandoned}} the abstract folk jazz compositions of Astral Weeks {{in favor of}} more formally composed songs on Moondance, which he wrote and produced entirely himself. Its lively rhythm and blues/rock music was the style he would become most known for in his career. The music incorporated soul, jazz, pop, and Irish folk sounds into songs about finding spiritual renewal <b>and</b> <b>redemption</b> in worldly matters such as nature, music, romantic love, and self-affirmation.|$|E

40|$|Open-end {{mutual funds}} allow {{purchases}} <b>and</b> <b>redemptions</b> of shares daily at the closing net asset value. This practice imposes costs upon {{the mutual fund}} for portfolio adjustments and maintaining cash balances to handle inflows <b>and</b> <b>redemptions.</b> The cost of providing liquidity falls disproportionately on nontrading investors. This paper proposes charging fees for purchasing mutual fund shares and for redeeming mutual fund shares. The fees collected will {{become part of the}} assets of the fund and compensate nontrading investors for providing liquidity. This procedure reduces the incentives for the use of mutual funds as short-term trading vehicles...|$|R

5|$|The Rosewood massacre, {{the ensuing}} silence, and the {{compensation}} hearing were {{the subject of}} the 1996 book Like Judgment Day: The Ruin <b>and</b> <b>Redemption</b> of a Town Called Rosewood by Michael D'Orso. It was a New York Times bestseller and won the Lillian Smith Book Award, bestowed by the University of Georgia Libraries and the Southern Regional Council to authors who highlight racial and social inequality in their works.|$|E
5|$|The {{panel is}} rich in Christian iconography, which {{reflects}} the shift in religious attitudes to a more meditative and solitary devotion in the 14th century, exemplified by the Devotio Moderna movement. The painting is devotional; its iconography clearly juxtaposes Old and New Testament imagery, conveying themes of punishment <b>and</b> <b>redemption,</b> against the belief that a second chance is available through the birth of Christ.|$|E
5|$|Three years later, in 1964, Mary Poppins is to {{have its}} world premiere at Grauman's Chinese Theatre in Hollywood. Disney has not invited Travers, fearing how she might react with the press watching. Prompted by Russell, Travers shows up unannounced at Disney's office; he reluctantly issues her an invitation. Initially, she watches Mary Poppins {{with a lack of}} enthusiasm, {{particularly}} during the animated sequences. She gradually warms {{to the rest of the}} film, however, becoming deeply moved by the depiction of George Banks' personal crisis <b>and</b> <b>redemption.</b>|$|E

5|$|American Beauty is a 1999 American drama film {{directed}} by Sam Mendes and written by Alan Ball. Kevin Spacey stars as Lester Burnham, a 42-year-old advertising executive {{who has a}} midlife crisis when he becomes infatuated with his teenage daughter's best friend, Angela (Mena Suvari). Annette Bening co-stars as Lester's materialistic wife, Carolyn, and Thora Birch plays their insecure daughter, Jane. Wes Bentley, Chris Cooper, and Allison Janney also feature. The film is described by academics as a satire of American middle-class notions of beauty and personal satisfaction; analysis {{has focused on the}} film's explorations of romantic, and paternal love, sexuality, beauty, materialism, self-liberation, <b>and</b> <b>redemption.</b>|$|E
5|$|Created by the god Brahma as {{the most}} {{beautiful}} woman, Ahalya was married to the much older Gautama. In the earliest full narrative, when Indra comes disguised as her husband, Ahalya sees through his disguise but nevertheless accepts his advances. Later sources often absolve her of all guilt, describing how she falls prey to Indra's trickery. In all narratives, Ahalya and Indra are cursed by Gautama. The curse varies from text to text, but almost all versions describe Rama as the eventual agent of her liberation <b>and</b> <b>redemption.</b> Although early texts describe how Ahalya must atone by undergoing severe penance while remaining invisible {{to the world and}} how she is purified by offering Rama hospitality, in the popular retelling developed over time, Ahalya is cursed to become a stone and regains her human form after she is brushed by Rama's foot.|$|E
5|$|The story draws {{heavily on}} the {{tradition}} of the romance, a fictitious narrative set far away from ordinary life. Romances were typically based around themes such as the supernatural, wandering, exploration and discovery. They were often set in coastal regions, and typically featured exotic, fantastical locations and themes of transgression <b>and</b> <b>redemption,</b> loss and retrieval, exile and reunion. As a result, while The Tempest was originally listed as a comedy in the First Folio of Shakespeare's plays, subsequent editors have chosen to give it the more specific label of Shakespearean romance. Like the other romances, the play was influenced by the then-new genre of tragicomedy, introduced by John Fletcher {{in the first decade of}} the 17th century and developed in the Beaumont and Fletcher collaborations, as well as by the explosion of development of the courtly masque form by such as Ben Jonson and Inigo Jones at the same time.|$|E

40|$|A {{number of}} finance papers {{have shown that}} the {{downward}} sloping demand curve for equity exists. Many of these previous studies have come to their conclusion via one of two ways. The first method looks at new equity offerings by companies and their affect on stock returns due to increase in supply. The second looks at company inclusion into the S&P 500 Composite Index and its effect on company returns due to increase in demand from index mutual funds. In both cases there has been evidence of the downward sloping demand curve but skeptics still persist due to the inability of these techniques to eliminate company specific information. The use of creations <b>and</b> <b>redemptions</b> of IPUs in the verification of the downward sloping demand curve has the benefit of being free of company specific pressures since they are stand alone equity products. Standard & Poor's Depository Receipts (SPDRs) are the IPU under study in this paper. Through the use of standard event studies we have found that with larger or infrequent creations <b>and</b> <b>redemptions</b> there exists support for the downward sloping demand curve exists. More specifically, with creations we observe negative abnormal returns <b>and</b> with <b>redemptions</b> we observe the reverse. When new creations <b>and</b> <b>redemptions</b> in SPDR units take place, a demand and supply shift occurs in the market due to purchases and sales of S&P 500 portfolio baskets. We found strong evidence that redemptions of SPDRs affects the returns of the underlying stocks of the S&P 500. The negative significance would imply that redeeming parties are not liquidating the equity basket upon receipt. When we eliminate company specific information results persist in large redemption...|$|R
