Deciding on using the subject of Pokémon after considering several possibilities such as Grand Theft <b>Auto</b> <b>and</b> Dragon Ball Z, the producers were surprised by fan reaction to the material.

5|$|Originally, EVE {{would have}} been {{electrocuted}} by <b>Auto,</b> <b>and</b> then be quickly saved from ejection {{at the hands of}} the WALL-A robots by WALL-E. He would have then revived her by replacing her power unit with a cigarette lighter he brought from Earth. Stanton reversed this following a 2007 test screening, as he wanted to show EVE replacing her directive of bringing the plant to the captain with repairing WALL-E, and it made WALL-E even more heroic if he held the holo-detector open despite being badly hurt. Stanton also moved the moment where WALL-E reveals his plant (which he had snatched from the self-destructing escape pod) from producing it from a closet to immediately after his escape, as it made EVE happier and gave them stronger motivation to dance around the ship. Stanton felt half the audience at the screening believed the humans would be unable to cope with living on Earth and would have died out after the film's end. Jim Capobianco, director of the Ratatouille short film Your Friend the Rat, created an end credits animation that continued the story—and stylized in different artistic movements throughout history—to clarify an optimistic tone.|$|E
5|$|The {{world of}} Human Revolution was {{designed}} to parallel the Greek myth of Icarus; in the myth, Icarus was flying with artificial wings, but flew {{too close to the}} sun and destroyed his wings, causing his fatal fall. The world's new reliance on and experimentation with augmentation technology mirrored the myth, with the game's narrative taking place at a crucial tipping point, the outcome of which would be decided by the player. The general focus on technology and its effect on human society also tied into the game's visual themes. The development team used multiple sources as references while creating the world and scenario. The Children of Men was used to capture the setting and resultant chaotic drama, Bioshock gave them a reference for the handling of mature themes, while the television series Rome showed how powerful people's ambitions shaped history. The sense of tension between augmented and normal humans was inspired by the similar tension between humans and mutants in the X-Men franchise. For the conspiracy elements of the plot, the team used novels Deception Point, The Firm, and Frank Herbert's Dune saga as inspiration. The desired quality of cutscenes and dialogue were directly inspired by the Grand Theft <b>Auto</b> <b>and</b> Mass Effect franchises. DeMarle termed the final product as a study in contrasts, as the implementation of augmentation technology had created a new form of divided social class system when other social barriers had fallen. Other themes used earlier in Deus Ex, such as exploring a culture of fear; the workings of a surveillance state; and the exploitation created by economic inequality, were paralleled in Human Revolution. To add more depth to the world and narrative, the team created supplementary written material such as emails, e-books, and cell phone-like devices called pocket secretaries.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Although the {{commonly}} accepted link between <b>auto</b> ownership <b>and</b> <b>auto</b> use has inspired some municipalities {{to experiment with}} neighborhood design {{in an attempt to}} influence travel behavior, the underlying relationship between neighborhood design <b>and</b> <b>auto</b> ownership is still unclear. Evidence suggests that auto ownership is tightly linked with income and household size, and less responsive to urban design. This research uses data from a matched pair of neighborhoods—one conventional and one neo-traditional—to consider first the relationship between neighborhood design <b>and</b> <b>auto</b> ownership, <b>and</b> further that between these factors <b>and</b> <b>auto</b> use. Although no statistically significant difference was found for auto ownership in the two neighborhoods, there were clear differences in auto use—residents of neo-traditional development made fewer auto trips, traveled fewer miles in their vehicles and spent less time driving. This has implications for planning strategies that may help reduce <b>auto</b> trips <b>and</b> miles even when auto ownership remains unchanged...|$|R
