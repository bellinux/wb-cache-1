40|$|AbstractNorepinephrine and {{histamine}} markedly augment <b>accumulations</b> <b>of</b> cyclic AMP elicited by 2 -chloroadenosine in a {{guinea pig}} cerebral cortical vesicular preparation. In addition, these biogenic amines stimulate phosphatidylinositol turnover. Phosphatidylinositol turnover {{is associated with}} mobilization of internal calcium and with stimulation of protein kinase C. Phorbol- 12 -myristate- 13 -acetate (PMA), a known activator of protein kinase C, {{has no effect on}} cyclic AMP levels alone, but in a concentration-dependent manner enhances <b>accumulations</b> <b>of</b> cyclic AMP elicited by 2 -chloroadenosine. PMA, like norepinephrine, also enhances <b>accumulations</b> <b>of</b> cyclic AMP elicited by histamine. PMA has no effect on the synergistic <b>accumulations</b> <b>of</b> cyclic AMP elicited by combinations of amines and 2 -chloroadenosine. PMA also augments <b>accumulations</b> <b>of</b> cyclic AMP elicited by forskolin. The results suggest that activation of, phosphatidylinositol turnover by biogenic amines may lead via stimulation of protein kinase C to enhanced responsiveness of cyclic AMP-generating systems...|$|R
40|$|The Rule Against Perpetuities {{is dying}} an ignoble death. To attract trust {{business}} and the lawyers 2 ̆ 7 fees and trustees 2 ̆ 7 commissions that come with it, twenty states have abolished the Rule as applied to interests in trust. But the Rule Against Perpetuities {{is not the only}} rule of property law that bears on trust duration. Another is the rule against <b>accumulations</b> <b>of</b> income, which limits the timeframe during which a settlor may direct the trustee to accumulate and retain income in trust. For 200 years, the rule against <b>accumulations</b> <b>of</b> income has lurked in the shadow of its older and more distinguished cousin, the Rule Against Perpetuities. But with the race to abolish the Rule Against Perpetuities, the rule against <b>accumulations</b> <b>of</b> income may have newfound relevance. Perpetual trusts are more likely than ordinary trusts to involve <b>accumulations</b> <b>of</b> income in trust. Accordingly, the task for this short essay is to examine the lurking rule against <b>accumulations</b> <b>of</b> income and its potential impact on the 100 billion perpetual trust industry...|$|R
5|$|In a 2003 {{review of}} the literature, Rowan et al. {{proposed}} one model for how LTP might be affected in AD. AD appears to result, at least in part, from misprocessing of amyloid precursor protein (APP). The result of this abnormal processing is the <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> fragments of this protein, called amyloid β (Aβ). Aβ exists in both soluble and fibrillar forms. Misprocessing of APP results in the <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> soluble Aβ that, according to Rowan's hypothesis, impairs hippocampal LTP and {{may lead to the}} cognitive decline seen early in AD.|$|E

Contributing {{to the cause of}} the accident were encounters with wind shear, downdrafts, and turbulence during the climb.

5|$|The kidney {{toxicity}} of ethylene glycol occurs 24 to 72 hours post ingestion and {{is caused by}} a direct cytotoxic effect of glycolic acid. The glycolic acid is then metabolized to glyoxylic acid and finally to oxalic acid. Oxalic acid binds with calcium to form calcium oxalate crystals which may deposit and cause damage to many areas of the body including the brain, heart, kidneys, and lungs. The most significant effect is <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> calcium oxalate crystals in the kidneys which causes kidney damage leading to oliguric or anuric acute kidney failure. The rate-limiting step in this cascade is the conversion of glycolic to glyoxylic acid. <b>Accumulation</b> <b>of</b> glycolic acid in the body is mainly responsible for toxicity.|$|E

Specialisations of the matrix show (see Sect. 4), for instance, that for each positive integer N, (N + √N 2 + 4) 2 and (N + √N 2 + 8) 2 belong to the set IR 0 of index-values of irreducible subfactors of R, that (N + 1 N) 2 is an <b>accumulation</b> point <b>of</b> IR 0, and that 9 is an <b>accumulation</b> point <b>of</b> <b>accumulation</b> points <b>of</b> IR 0, 16 is an <b>accumulation</b> point <b>of</b> <b>accumulation</b> points <b>of</b> <b>accumulation</b> points <b>of</b> IR 0, and so on...|$|R

5|$|Another way enzyme {{malfunctions}} {{can cause}} disease comes from germline mutations in genes coding for DNA repair enzymes. Defects in these enzymes cause cancer because cells are {{less able to}} repair mutations in their genomes.

An example of such a hereditary cancer syndrome is xeroderma pigmentosum, which causes the development of skin cancers in response to even minimal exposure to ultraviolet light.|$|E
