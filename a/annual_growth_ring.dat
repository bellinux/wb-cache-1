30|$|Dendrochronology uses {{synchronous}} time series of <b>annual</b> <b>growth</b> <b>ring</b> widths across a geographical region {{influenced by the}} inter-annual variability of climate and growth limiting factors (e.g., soil moisture). It {{is based on the}} principal of cross-dating, which uses patterns of wide and narrow rings induced by climate variability (Douglass 1941). We cross-dated all cross-sections using standard dendrochronological methods (Stokes and Smiley 1968) and measured <b>annual</b> <b>growth</b> <b>ring</b> widths to the nearest 0.001 mm with a stage micrometer.

30|$|We {{prepared}} and analyzed fire-scarred specimens using dendrochronology techniques (Stokes and Smiley 1968, Arno and Sneck 1977, Orvis and Grissino-Mayer 2002). Samples were air dried and sanded with progressively finer sandpaper until the cellular structure within each <b>annual</b> <b>growth</b> <b>ring,</b> {{and the position}} of fire scars within the ring series, could be viewed clearly under a stereomicroscope with 7 - 45 X magnification (Speer 2010). We identified 373 fire scars in 70 whole or partial cross-sections. Fire scars were identified {{by the presence of}} a gap (often charred) within the ring and subsequent overlapping curvilinear growth characteristic of the treeâ€™s healing pattern (McBride 1983). In addition, we used other fire-associated ring characteristics including traumatic resin ducts, double latewood, and growth releases to confirm the presence of a scar found elsewhere along the circumference of the cross-section (Brown and Swetnam 1994). We approximated the seasonality of fire occurrence by assessing the position of the scar within the <b>annual</b> <b>growth</b> <b>ring</b> (Caprio and Swetnam 1995).|$|E

In this winter-wet, summer-dry climate, dormant season fires {{are most likely to}} represent late summer or fall burns after radial growth has ceased for the year, rather than winter or early spring burns (Caprio and Swetnam 1995).

The lower one-third of the live crown tended to consist of branches without rings; these branches contained an average of 30 % of the total crown leaf area. The ratio of foliage weight to total branch weight, in combination with position of the branch in the canopy, was an effective discriminator of non-ring producing branches. This suggests that both structural and environmental factors influence the cessation of ring production.

40|$|The age {{structure}} of balsam fir (Abies balsamea (L.) Mill.) regeneration is frequently used to investigate boreal forest dynamics of North America.

Inaccurately locating the shoot-root interface could lead to imprecise age determination. In this study, balsam fir seedlings (< 2 m height) were harvested in whole from closed forest stands located {{in the province of}} Quebec, Canada. Seedling age was determined by (i) counting the number of <b>annual</b> <b>growth</b> <b>rings</b> at the presumed shoot-root interface, and (ii) counting all terminal bud scars from the apex {{to the base of the}} hypocotyl (true collar).

Early detection of stress in plants is difficult and the compounding effects of multiple or severe stressors can lead to irreversible damage or death. Annual wood production was used to produce a time series for individuals from stands classified as either high vigor or low vigor (a general measure of health). As a measure of symmetry over time, the fractal dimension of each time series was determined and compared among vigor classes. We found that individuals obtained from low vigor sites had a significantly lower fractal dimension than those from high vigor sites. These results agree with patterns found in a variety of other organisms, and we argue that the reduced fractal dimension is related to a loss in system complexity of stressed individuals...|$|E

The coefficient of diffusion of the adhesive bond lines was determined from the measurements and simulations. The mechanical material model used for the warping simulations takes into account elastic strain, moisture-induced swelling, and mechano-sorptive strain. The simulations showed good agreement with the warping test results. The most important material parameters for the cup deformation, which were identified in a parametric study of a panel with vertically oriented annual rings, are the moduli of elasticity and the swelling coefficients in the longitudinal and radial direction.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{formation}} of <b>annual</b> <b>growth</b> <b>rings</b> {{has been confirmed}} for several mangrove species in the last decade, among which is the Rhizophora mangle. However, the record of annual rings for this species was made in a region with high hydric seasonality, a widely recognized induction factor of annual rings in tropical species. In this sense, the present study aimed to verify the occurrence of <b>annual</b> <b>growth</b> <b>rings</b> in R. mangle in the mangroves of Guaratiba (Rio de Janeiro, Southeastern Brazil), a region with low hydric seasonality. For this purpose, the crossdating technique was applied in ten trees collected with known age (seven years). The <b>growth</b> <b>rings</b> are characterized by alternating layers of low vessel density (earlywood) and high vessel density (latewood). Multiple regression analysis indicated that <b>growth</b> <b>rings</b> width variation is driven by precipitation, water surplus, water deficit and water storage.

40|$|Graduation date: 2000 Physiology and {{genetics}} of drought hardiness were investigated in two-year-old coastal Douglas-fir seedlings from 39 full-sib families obtained from coastal British Columbia and grown at Oregon State University, Corvallis, Oregon. The seedlings {{were subjected to}} three drought treatments (control, moderate, and severe drought) in their second growing season (June through September 1997). Response to drought stress was assessed by measuring stomatal conductance, hydraulic conductivity, xylem cavitation in two annual growth rings, and shoot damage. Growth traits measured were seedling height and basal stem diameter. In response to severe drought, a general decrease in predawn xylem water potential, hydraulic conductivity, and stomatal conductance occurred while xylem cavitation and shoot damage increased significantly (p < 0. 05). Drought stress also reduced seedling growth, with diameter being more severely affected by drought than height. Negative xylem water potential (P = - 1. 7 to - 2. 5 MPa) during the drought period reduced hydraulic conductivity of the seedlings. Mean cavitation in the first <b>annual</b> <b>growth</b> <b>ring</b> was significantly (p < 0. 05) greater in seedlings grown under severe drought than in seedlings grown in the moderate or control treatments. Family variation for cavitation in the first growth ring, however was significant (p < 0. 001) in all treatments indicating that genetic variation in cavitation in this ring is independent of drought treatment. Cavitation in the second <b>annual</b> <b>growth</b> <b>ring</b> showed significant (p < 0. 05) differences among all the treatments. Family variation in cavitation in the second growth ring was significant (p < 0. 0001) only in the severe drought treatment, but not in control or moderate, suggesting that this trait was particularly sensitive to severe, current-season drought. Family variation was significant (p < 0. 05) in two growth potential traits (height and diameter) and in cavitation of the second growth ring and shoot damage (damage traits). Despite relatively high ratios of specific combining ability to general combining ability variance for most traits, family mean heritabilities were moderately high (hr 2 = 0. 41 to 0. 58), suggesting that selection based on family information will be effective for improving drought hardiness and growth potential of seedlings. Cavitation in the second growth ring and shoot damage appear to be largely under control of {{the same set of}} genes. Although estimated family heritability was somewhat greater for cavitation (0. 57) than for shoot damage (0. 41), shoot damage {{is likely to be the}} better choice upon which to base selections for seedling drought hardiness because it is a much easier trait to measure. Damage traits are estimated to have a slight, unfavorable genetic correlation with growth potential traits, thus selection for stem growth at the seedling stage is not expected to have a large influence on the drought hardiness of seedlings...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a new approach}} to air pollution determined through the use of elemental analysis of the annual tree rings (ATRs) of Turkish red pine (Pinus brutia Ten.). For this aim, every annual ring width was measured on the cross-section wheels of Turkish red pine supplied from ten research points around the KemerkÃ¶y (GÃ¶kova) thermal power plant (KTPP). The fly ash collected from the surfaces of the needles and the <b>annual</b> <b>growth</b> <b>ring</b> of Turkish red pine in the polluted points were investigated by energy dispersive spec-trometer (EDS). The elemental analysis of the annual rings were performed considering the fly ash elemental composition because the main pollutant source was the fly ash emitted from KTPP chimney smoke. With EDS analyses, some elements such as Al, Si, Mg, K, Fe, Ca, S, Zn, Ti, and Nb were determined in the fly ash. These elements accumulated in ATRs from the KTPP fly ash. They not only accumulated in annual rings formed after KTPP began operation but also accumulated in ATRs formed before KTPP started. It was confirmed that these elements accumulated in the annual rings affected by KTPP much more than the control ATRs. This paper proved that SEM-EDS, a new approach/analytical method to air pollu-tion determination through ATRs, has been successfully applied to dendro-chemical elemental analysis of annual tree rings...|$|E
