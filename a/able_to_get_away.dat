5|$|At the {{southwest}} corner of the same intersection, the building housing Sidetrack Bar & Grillwhich has held a bar and restaurant continuously since at least 1850has an unusual shape resulting from a 1929 train derailment. On an early January morning, the twelfth car, laden with lumber, of an 85-car freight train came off the tracks and crashed into the corner of the building. The owner of the building, who lived just above the section that was hit, was uninjured but had most of her personal effects scattered into the street. There were only a few people near the railroad crossing when it derailed including an 18-year-old female who was knocked unconscious and a man who was sitting in his car, but was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> unharmed. When the current owners went to build a patio on the spot, they found some of the debris had been piled up underneath, which made it more difficult to dig post holes. In 1931, the entrance to the building was moved from the east side to its current position on the north side to accommodate a post-prohibition law requiring bar entrances to be at least 500 feet from any church. The back patio was constructed after the nearby church burned down. According to Sidetrack owner Linda French, the first-floor walls are three bricks deep, with the oldest remaining bricks dating to the 1850s.|$|E

It provides a legal, social and political analysis of how the British in India all too readily were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> literally <b>get</b> <b>away</b> with murder. She argues that racial violence was a constant and constituent element of British dominance in India, and that regular acts of violence 'simultaneously menaced and maintained British power in India from the late 18 th to the early 20 th centuries. Physical violence was an intrinsic feature of imperial rule'...|$|R

After that incident in 2006, Kelly says that Ailes did not sexually harass her again. Then, in 2016, when Gretchen Carlson first made her sexual abuse allegations, Fox pressured Kelly to defend Ailes, which she refused to do.|$|E

Unwilling to wait any longer, Cal ordered his assassins to stab Goodman {{to death in the}} street, whereupon he {{automatically}} succeeded to the city's highest office. He had Judge Dredd shot and the mayor arrested, and immediately began a despotic reign of terror. By this time the power had gone to his head and he became openly insane. He appointed his own pet goldfish to the vacant position of deputy chief judge, and made criticising the chief judge a capital offence. He was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> with this because he had brainwashed the majority of the judges into obeying his every order.|$|E

As soon as the handkerchief touched the ground a deep, broad river would spring up, which would hinder the witch's progress.

25|$|Mauricio Soler came {{free from}} the peloton before the first climb {{of the day and}} took full points {{available}} to him, taking the lead outright in the King of the Mountains from Rasmussen. He and Carlos Sastre, for whom it was something of a surprise that he was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> from the peloton easily as he was 5th in the GC {{at the beginning of the}} day, worked together to stay away as long as possible. They wound up being caught with 11 kilometers left to race by a group containing Rasmussen, Alberto Contador, Levi Leipheimer, and numerous domestiques from their teams. Rasmussen came clear of this group on the way up the Aubisque to win the stage. It was thought at the time that this all but cinched his victory in the Tour, since only flat stages and an individual time trial remained, and that even a relatively weak time trialist like Rasmussen was unlikely to lose three to five minutes.|$|E
25|$|Women {{were the}} primary vehicle for rumors that touched upon issues of family and {{everyday}} life. Fears that collectivization {{would result in the}} socialization of children, the export of women’s hair, communal wife-sharing, and the notorious common blanket affected many women, causing them to revolt. For example, when it was announced that a collective farm in Crimea would become a commune and that the children would be socialized, women killed their soon-to-be socialized livestock, which spared the children. Stories that the Communists believed short hair gave women a more urban and industrial look insulted peasant women. After local activists in a village in North Caucasus actually confiscated all blankets, more fear dispersed among villagers. The common blanket meant that all men and women would sleep on a seven-hundred meter long bed under a seven-hundred-meter long blanket. Historians argue that women took advantage of these rumors without actually believing them so they could attack the collective farm “under the guise of irrational, nonpolitical protest.” Women were less vulnerable to retaliation than peasant men, and therefore <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> with a lot more.|$|E
25|$|Spanish armies under Freire and Joaquín Blake y Joyes {{threatened}} the French {{grip on the}} south of Spain {{during the summer of}} 1811. Marshal Soult, who had just suffered a bloody defeat at the Battle of Albuera in May, left a colleague's army to observe the Anglo-Portuguese and marched south at the end of June. After driving off Blake's army, the marshal moved east with 12,000 men to deal with the Army of Murcia. Freire's army had enjoyed initial success in its campaign against Jean François Leval's weak IV Corps. At the beginning of August, Freire was joined by Blake's force, which had been shipped to the Region of Murcia by a British naval squadron. The arrival of Soult with reinforcements quickly turned the tables. While Soult faced Freire's main force, Godinot's division brushed aside one Spanish force, then threatened to block Freire's line of retreat. After Godinot savaged O'Donnell's division at Zújar, Freire was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>away.</b> But French cavalry under Pierre Benoit Soult crushed his rear guard at Las Vertientes, east of Cúllar. After the twin defeats, the Murcian army scattered into the mountains.|$|E

25|$|The fourth {{match of}} Triplemanía XIX saw Extreme Tiger and Jack Evans {{defending}} the AAA World Tag Team Championship in a steel cage match against TNA X Division Champion Abyss and TNA World Heavyweight Champion Mr. Anderson. The team whose both members {{managed to escape}} the cage would be declared the winner. Abyss and Anderson dominated the match early, but eventually Extreme Tiger was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> from Abyss and escape the cage. In a two–on–one advantage the TNA team was even more dominant and after more double–teaming, Mr. Anderson eventually {{climbed out of the}} cage. Left in the cage with Abyss, Evans managed to dodge his attack, use his speed to take him down and hit him with a 450° splash. Evans attempted to escape the cage, but Abyss stopped him, opened the bag he had entered the cage with and emptied its contents, thumbtacks, on the mat. Abyss attempted to chokeslam Evans off the ropes, but Evans escaped the hold by biting his fingers and then powerbombed him onto the tacks. Evans {{climbed to the top of}} the cage, but, instead of escaping, dove back into the ring onto Abyss with a crossbody. Immediately afterwards, Evans climbed back up and escaped the cage to successfully defend the AAA World Tag Team Championship.|$|E
25|$|In {{the next}} town, the two swindlers then {{impersonate}} brothers of Peter Wilks, a recently deceased man of property. To match accounts of Wilks's brothers, the king attempts an English accent and the duke {{pretends to be}} a deaf-mute while starting to collect Wilks's inheritance. Huck decides that Wilks's three orphaned nieces, who treat Huck with kindness, do not deserve to be cheated thus and so he tries to retrieve for them the stolen inheritance. In a desperate moment, Huck is forced to hide the money in Wilks's coffin, which is abruptly buried the next morning. The arrival of two new men {{who seem to be}} the real brothers throws everything into confusion, so that the townspeople decide to dig up the coffin in order to determine which are the true brothers, but, with everyone else distracted, Huck leaves for the raft, hoping to never see the duke and king again. Suddenly, though, the two villains return, much to Huck's despair. When Huck is finally <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> a second time, he finds to his horror that the swindlers have sold Jim away to a family that intends to return him to his proper owner for the reward. Defying his conscience and accepting the negative religious consequences he expects for his actions—"All right, then, I'll go to hell!"—Huck resolves to free Jim once and for all.|$|E
25|$|The prisoners waited about a {{week for}} a moonless night, and on Friday 24 March the escape attempt began. As night fell, those {{allocated}} a place moved to Hut 104. Unfortunately for the prisoners, the exit trap door of Harry was frozen solid and freeing it delayed the escape {{for an hour and a}} half. Then it was discovered that the tunnel had come up short of the nearby forest; at 10.30 p.m. the first man out emerged just short of the tree line close to a guard tower. (According to Alan Burgess, in his book The Longest Tunnel, the tunnel reached the forest, as planned, but the first few trees were too sparse to provide adequate cover.) As the temperature was below freezing and there was snow on the ground, a dark trail would be created by crawling to cover. To avoid being seen by the sentries, the escapes were reduced to about ten per hour, rather than the one every minute that had been planned. Word was eventually sent back that no-one issued with a number above 100 would be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> before daylight. As they would be shot if caught trying to return to their own barracks, these men changed back into their own uniforms and got some sleep. An air raid then caused the camp's (and the tunnel's) electric lighting to be shut down, slowing the escape even more. At around 1 a.m., the tunnel collapsed and had to be repaired.|$|E
