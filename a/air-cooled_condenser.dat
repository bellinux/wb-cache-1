This type of system allows existing refrigerant-based HVAC equipment to be converted to Thermal Energy Storage systems, something that could not previously be easily done with chill water technology. In addition, unlike water-cooled chill water systems that do not experience a tremendous difference in efficiency from day to night, this new class of equipment typically displaces daytime operation of <b>air-cooled</b> <b>condensing</b> units.

50|$|A chiller is a {{refrigeration}} unit designed to produce cool (chilled) water for space cooling purposes.The chilled water is then circulated {{to one or}} more cooling coils located in air handling units, fan-coils, or induction units. Chilled water distribution is not constrained by the 100 foot separation limit that applies to DX systems, thus chilled water-based cooling systems are typically used in larger buildings. Capacity control in a chilled water system is usually achieved through modulation of water flow through the coils; thus, multiple coils may be served from a single chiller without compromising control of any individual unit.Chillers may operate on either the vapor compression principle or the absorption principle. Vapor compression chillers may utilize reciprocating, centrifugal, screw, or rotary compressor configurations. Reciprocating chillers are commonly used for capacities below 200 tons; centrifugal chillers are normally used to provide higher capacities; rotary and screw chillers are less commonly used, but are not rare. Heat rejection from a chiller may be by way of an <b>air-cooled</b> <b>condenser</b> or a cooling tower (both discussed below). Vapor compression chillers may be bundled with an <b>air-cooled</b> <b>condenser</b> to provide a packaged chiller, which would be installed outside of the building envelope. Vapor compression chillers may also be designed to be installed separate from the condensing unit; normally such a chiller would be installed in an enclosed central plant space. Absorption chillers are designed to be installed separate from the condensing unit.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the {{modelling}} and findings of the energy performance of an air-cooled reciprocating multiple-chiller plant under the conventional head pressure control and the new condensing-temperature control in a subtropical climate. The simulation model was validated using the operating data of an existing chiller plant. As noted from this existing air-cooled reciprocating chiller plant, there was a substantial efficiency drop at part-load resulting from the head pressure control. If operating at variable lower condensing-temperatures based on the established operating mode of the condenser fans and compressors, it is shown that the chiller consumption can be maintained below 2 kW/refrigeration ton throughout {{the entire range of}} outdoor temperature and part-load conditions, giving an average efficiency of 1. 08 kW/refrigeration ton. The energy imposition due to cycling on more condenser fans can be compensated by the reduced compressor consumption. Potential energy savings of 18. 2 and 29 % in the annual chiller consumption are achievable by applying the condensing-temperature control to two existing chiller plants studied. This supports the need to develop the condensing-temperature control as an improvement to the conventional head pressure control. <b>Air-cooled</b> chillers <b>Condensing</b> temperature control Head pressure control Energy efficiency...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (MScEng (Mechanical and Mechatronic Engineering)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2007. Air-cooled steam {{condensers}} (ACSC’s) are increasingly employed to reject heat in modern power plants. Unfortunately these cooling systems become less effective under windy conditions and when ambient temperatures are high. A {{better understanding of}} the fundamental airflow patterns about and through such air-cooled condensers is essential if their performance is to be improved under these conditions. For known flow patterns, improved fan designs are possible and flow distortions can be reduced by means of extended surfaces or skirts, windwalls and screens. Spray cooling of the inlet air or the addition of an evaporative cooling system can also be considered for improving performance under extreme conditions. The present numerical study models the air flow field about and through an <b>air-cooled</b> steam <b>condenser</b> under windy conditions. The performance of the fans is modeled {{with the aid of a}} novel numerical approach known as the “actuator disc model”. Distorted airflow patterns that significantly reduce fan performance in certain areas and recirculatory flows that entrain hot plume air are found to be the reasons for poor ACSC performance. It is found that the reduction in fan performance is the main reason for the poor ACSC performance while recirculation of hot plume air only reduces performance by a small amount. Significant improvements in ACSC performance are possible under these conditions if a cost effective skirt is added to the periphery of the ACSC while the installation of a screen under the ACSC has very little effect...|$|R
25|$|As alchemy {{evolved into}} the science of chemistry, vessels called retorts became used for distillations. Both alembics and retorts are forms of {{glassware}} with long necks pointing to the side at a downward angle which acted as <b>air-cooled</b> condensers to <b>condense</b> the distillate and let it drip downward for collection. Later, copper alembics were invented. Riveted joints were often kept tight by using various mixtures, for instance a dough made of rye flour.

Today, the retorts and pot stills have been largely supplanted by more efficient distillation methods in most industrial processes. However, the pot still is still widely used for the elaboration of some fine alcohols such as cognac, Scotch whisky, Irish whiskey, tequila and some vodkas.

40|$|The current paper {{presents}} a methodology of a design optimization technique {{that can be}} useful in assessing the best configuration of a finned-tube condenser, using a thermal and economical optimization approach. The assessment has been carried out on an <b>air-cooled</b> finned-tube <b>condenser</b> of a vapour compression cycle for a roof-top bus air-conditioning system at a specified cooling capacity. The methodology has been conducted by studying the effect of some operational and geometrical design parameters for the condenser on the entire cycle exergy destruction or irreversibility, air-conditioning system coefficient of performance (COP), and total annual cost. The heat exchangers for the bus air-conditioning system are featured by a very compact frontal area due to the stringent space limitations and structure standard for the system installation. Therefore, the current study also takes in its account the effect of the varying design parameters on the condenser frontal area. The irreversibility due to heat transfer across the stream-to-stream temperature-difference and due to frictional pressure-drops is calculated {{as a function of the}} design parameters. A cost function is introduced, defined as the sum of two contributions, the investment expense of the condenser material and the system compressor, and the operational expense of air-conditioning system, which is usually driven by an auxiliary engine or coupled with the main bus engine. The optimal trade-off between investment and operating cost is therefore investigated. A numerical example is discussed, in which, a comparison between the commercial condenser design and optimal design configuration has been presented in terms of the system COP and condenser material cost.

A feature of the simulation is that it can simulate the four qasic components in detail, based on fundamental principles. The product of this study is a simulation routine which can be used as a design tool for micro heat pumps as well as its individual components. Experimental tests were conducted on an existing R- 134 a micro heat pump. and the results were successfully used to verify the simulation routines. An extensive literature survey was conducted on heat pump component models as well as heat transfer correlations. In this study models were developed for each of the four basic components used in the micro heat pump, i. e. fluted tube water heating <b>condenser,</b> <b>air-cooled</b> evaporator, reciprocating compressor and capillary tube. The theory on which each model is based, was derived from first principles and the relevant model algorithms were developed and implemented in C++ computer routines. The component models were also integrated to allow a complete cycle simulation at different operating conditions. An advantage of the fluted tube condenser model is that it allows the surface area to be divided into any number of sections over which the change in refrigerant and water properties can be evaluated. The evaporator model calculates the change in refrigerant properties along the length of each tube in the coil. It can also predict in detail the state of the air across the coil face and along the depth of the coil. A model for simulating the compressor was derived which solves for both the mass flow rate and the refrigerant outlet conditions. Two capillary tube models were implemented. The first was based on a theoretical model obtained in the literature. This model did not provide sufficiently accurate results, however the second capillary tube model was based on a dimensional analysis providing a non-dimensional correlation for the mass flow rate. The coefficients of the correlation had to be modified for this application. The individual component models as well as the integrated cycle were both verified by means of the experimental data. The verification study showed that for the integrated cycle the condenser and evaporator heat transfer rates were predicted with average accuracies of 97 % and 96 % respectively. The refrigerant mass flow rates predicted by the compressor and the capillary tube models resulted in an average accuracy of 95 %. The high degree of accuracy obtained with the individual models as well as with the integrated cycle provides confidence in the simulation results. The simulation can therefore be applied as a design tool for micro heat pumps and its individual components. Master...|$|R
