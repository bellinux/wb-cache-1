40|$|The Defense Waste Processing Facility (DWPF) at the Savannah River Site is {{responsible}} for immobilizing high level radioactive waste (HLW) as glass-filled steel canisters for permanent storage. In the DWPF facility, the HLW sludge undergoes chemical treatment to prepare it for vitrification in a melter. The generation of stable foams is possible during treatment. The current DWPF antifoam is ineffective in preventing and minimizing the formation of foam. The adverse consequences of excess foam can be severe enough to cause foam to exit the evaporator and collect in the condensate. A foamover will contaminate the relatively clean condensate with HLW solids. It can also potentially lead {{to the production of}} an unsuitable melter feed that would not make quality glass. Both of these consequences are costly and time consuming to correct. A new <b>antifoam</b> <b>agent</b> was developed by the Illinois Institute of Technology, IIT, for DWPF in an attempt to minimize or eliminate the frequency of these foamovers. This <b>antifoam</b> <b>agent</b> was demonstrated to be superior to the existing DWPF <b>antifoam</b> <b>agent</b> in laboratory scale experiments. However, the DWPF evaporation heat flux was not achievable in the laboratory scale equipment. A 1 / 240 th-scale pilot facility was built to achieve this heat flux and determine whether the existing or new <b>antifoam</b> <b>agent</b> was superior. The pilot facility was built out of glass to allow observation of the foam formation during processing. The experiments used a non-radioactive simulant slurry similar to HLW. The IIT <b>antifoam</b> <b>agent</b> was found to be much more effective than the DWPF antifoam at the current conditions of maximum foam formation. The IIT <b>antifoam</b> <b>agent</b> was comparable or superior to the present DWPF antifoam under all conditions tested.

40|$|Pichia pastoris is {{a widely}} used host for {{recombinant}} protein production.

" Unexpectedly, the addition of a range of antifoams to both shake flask and bioreactor cultures of P. pastoris has been shown to alter the total yield of the recombinant protein being produced. Possible explanations for this are that the presence of the antifoam increases the total amount of protein being produced and secreted per cell or that it increases the density of the culture. <b>Antifoaming</b> <b>agents</b> may therefore have specific effects on the growth and yield characteristics of recombinant cultures, in addition to their primary action as de-foamers...|$|R
40|$|Pichia pastoris is a widely-used {{host for}} {{recombinant}} protein production. Initial screening for both suitable clones and optimum culture conditions is typically {{carried out in}} multi-well plates.

40|$|At Kiviks Musteri AB, {{situated}} in the southeast part of Scania, {{a wide variety of}} products based on fruits and berries, are produced. One of these products is base apple wine, which is used for the production of cider and mulled wine and also is sold to other producers of cider. A foaming problem has occurred at some customers when the cider is bottled, and this problem has been traced to the base wine. The aim {{of this paper is to}} investigate what causes the foaming and how the foaming is affected by the clarifying agents used during the production of the wine. An investigation whether silica based <b>antifoaming</b> <b>agents</b> might be a solution of the problem will be performed. During the work fermentations, clarification and foaming tests will be performed in laboratory scale in Kivik. Tests with four different silica based antifoaming compounds are carried out and on these samples the surface tension and viscosity are measured to see how these factors correlate with the foaming when <b>antifoaming</b> <b>agents</b> are added to the wine. What is more, fermentations with a new yeast type and fermentations with less fruit are made to investigate if this could give better foaming properties in the wine. The tests showed that it is probably proteins that are the main cause of the foaming, but an increase of the amount of bentonite, the clarifying agent reducing protein content in the wine, is not possible since this causes too much sediment. <b>Antifoaming</b> <b>agents</b> gave reduced foaming times, which were at an acceptable level, but when the wine was mixed to cider base and filtered the effect was lost. No significant differences were observed between the four antifoaming compounds. The test with the new yeast type gave no positive results when it came to foaming.
