500|$|In June 2007, YouTube began {{trials of}} a system for <b>automatic</b> <b>detection</b> of {{uploaded}} videos that infringe copyright. Google CEO Eric Schmidt regarded this system as necessary for resolving lawsuits {{such as the one}} from Viacom, which alleged that YouTube profited from content that it did {{not have the right to}} distribute. The system, which became known as Content ID, creates an ID File for copyrighted audio and video material, and stores it in a database. When a video is uploaded, it is checked against the database, and flags the video as a copyright violation if a match is found. When this occurs, the content owner has the choice of blocking the video to make it unviewable, tracking the viewing statistics of the video, or adding advertisements to the video. YouTube describes Content ID as [...] "very accurate in finding uploads that look similar to reference files that are of sufficient length and quality to generate an effective ID File". Content ID accounts for over a third of the monetized views on YouTube.|$|E

2500|$|In January 2012, General Atomics {{released}} a new trailing arm {{design for the}} Reaper's main landing gear; benefits include an over 30 percent increase in landing weight capacity, a 12 percent increase in gross takeoff weight (from [...] to [...] ), a maintenance-free shock absorber (eliminating the need for nitrogen pressurization), a fully rejected takeoff brake system, and provisions for automatic takeoff and landing capability and Anti-lock Brake System (ABS) field upgrades. In April 2012, General Atomics announced possible upgrades to USAF Reapers, including two extra [...] fuel pods under the wings to increase endurance to 37 hours. The wingspan can also be increased to , increasing endurance to 42 hours. The USAF has bought 38 Reaper Extended Range (ER) versions, carrying external fuel tanks (which don't affect weapon capacity), the heavy-weight landing gear, a four-bladed propeller, a new fuel management system which ensures fuel and thermal balance among external tank, wing, and fuselage fuel sources, and an alcohol water injection (AWI) system to shorten required runway takeoff length; these features increase endurance from 27 to 33–35 hours, while the company is still pitching the lengthened wing option. The Reaper ER first flew operationally in August 2015. The aircraft also has the sensor ball replaced with a high-definition camera, better communications so ground controllers can see the higher quality video, software to enable <b>automatic</b> <b>detection</b> of threats and tracking of 12 moving targets at once, {{and the ability to}} [...] "super ripple" [...] fire missiles within 0.32 seconds of each other.|$|E

The very interesting dynamics of flames have motivated {{the use of}} motion estimators to distinguish fire from other types of motion. Since fire is a complex but unusual visual phenomenon, employs distinctive parameters such as color, motion, shape, growth, dynamic texture and smoke behavior. Discrimination between fire and non-fire motion can be easily determined. There are many different approaches are available to detect fire at the early stage. This paper propose a survey about <b>automatic</b> fire <b>detection</b> in videos this survey provide a way to learn about different algorithms used for early fire detection, main problem in <b>automatic</b> fire <b>detection</b> is separation of fir sources from noise sources.
