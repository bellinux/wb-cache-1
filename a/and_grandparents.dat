He played guitar in a band, but his musical style was perhaps most heavily influenced by Pierre Schaeffer, a pioneer of musique concrète at the Groupe de Recherches Musicales.|$|E

For Albania, despite Januzaj was eligible to have an Albania passport through naturalization, it was uncertain that he had parental or maternal parent <b>and</b> <b>grandparent</b> born in the modern border of Albania, {{in order to make}} him eligible. Lastly, Januzaj did not have a British passport, nor a 5-year residency, thus even without Home Nations agreement, he is not eligible.|$|R
5|$|Smith was {{instrumental}} in the inauguration of the air mail service by the United States Postal Service (USPS) in the summer of 1919. He had logged 900 hours of flying time in the Army before he joined the U.S. Mail Service at age nineteen. His first assignment was to fly mail from Omaha, Nebraska, to California, essentially following the same route as the Oregon Trail. His mother had taken this trail by covered wagon from Council Bluffs, Iowa, to Cove, Oregon, in 1871. His mother <b>and</b> <b>grandparents</b> had taken two years to complete their trip, whereas Smith flew his route to California within a week with several stops along the way.|$|E
5|$|Embryos {{produced}} {{using in}} vitro fertilization may be genetically tested for HD using preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD). This technique, where one or two cells are extracted from a typically 4- to 8-cell embryo and then tested for the genetic abnormality, can then be used to ensure embryos affected with HD genes are not implanted, and therefore any offspring will not inherit the disease. Some forms of preimplantation genetic diagnosis—non-disclosure or exclusion testing—allow at-risk people to have HD-free offspring without revealing their own parental genotype, giving no information about whether they themselves are destined to develop HD. In exclusion testing, the embryos' DNA is {{compared with that of}} the parents <b>and</b> <b>grandparents</b> to avoid inheritance of the chromosomal region containing the HD gene from the affected grandparent. In non-disclosure testing, only disease-free embryos are replaced in the uterus while the parental genotype and hence parental risk for HD are never disclosed.|$|E
5|$|Ford reappears in the {{official}} novel continuation Stargate Atlantis Legacy: The Third Path. To their surprise, the team finds Ford alive and {{with a group of}} nomadic humans known as the Travelers. He explains to Sheppard he managed to escape the hive ship before it was destroyed, but crashed on the planet over which the battle took place. With the help of the Travelers, he recovered from his addiction but it took so long that he could no longer find Atlantis afterwards. Ford began leading a guerilla campaign against the Wraith, aided by the Travelers. He also now has a wife and son and regrets his previous actions under the Wraith enzyme. At the end of the novel, Ford is safely returned to Earth with his wife and son and reunites with his cousin <b>and</b> <b>grandparents.</b>|$|E

Through individual and group interviews, this study explored the relationship between <b>grandparents</b> <b>and</b> teenage grandchildren, looking at the ways teenage grandchildren <b>and</b> their <b>grandparents</b> say that they relate to each other, how they care and provide support and how the relationship changes over time. The research also considered how this relationship might be influenced by family, gender, ethnicity or mobility...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to explore the {{following}} relationships: (a) how moderating factors (gender, age, ethnicity, social support, marital status, reason for role assumption and number of grandchildren in the home) can influence the mediating role of resiliency, and (b) how resiliency may mediate the negative effects of raising grandchildren (role demands, life disruptions, and difficulties with grandchildren) on grandparent adjustment over time. Resiliency was hypothesized to have the greatest effect on custodial grandparents who experienced the most stress (i. e., older, single, Caucasian males lacking social support and raising more than one grandchild). Mediation was assessed using structural equation modeling. Results indicated resilience mediated the relationship between role assumptions (i. e., role demands and life disruptions) <b>and</b> <b>grandparent</b> adjustment; however, resilience did not mediate the relationship between grandchild characteristics <b>and</b> <b>grandparent</b> adjustment. Due to the small number of custodial grandfathers (n = 14), non-married grandparents (n = 29), non-Caucasian grandparents (n = 10), the small number of grandparents who assumed the custodial role for less ambiguous reasons (n = 24), and the number of custodial grandparents with more than one grandchild residing in the home (n = 29) participating within the study, hierarchical multiple regressions were only conducted to test for moderated mediation for perceived social support and the age of the grandparent. Results indicated resilience mediates the relationship between life disruption <b>and</b> <b>grandparent</b> well-being for younger custodial <b>grandparents</b> <b>and</b> for custodial <b>grandparents</b> with perceived high social support...|$|R

25|$|A recent {{increase}} in female longevity due to {{improvements in the}} standard of living and social care has also been suggested. It is difficult for selection, however, to favour aid to offspring from parents <b>and</b> <b>grandparents.</b> Irrespective of living standards, adaptive responses are limited by physiological mechanisms. In other words, senescence is programmed and regulated by specific genes.|$|E

40|$|Most {{previous}} studies on intergenerational transmission of human capital {{are restricted to}} two generations - between the parent and the child generation. In this paper we investigate {{if there is an}} independent effect of the <b>grandparent</b> <b>and</b> the great <b>grandparent</b> generations in this process. We use a dataset where we are able to link individual measures of life time earnings for three generation and data on educational attainments of four generations. We first do conventional regressions and transition matrices for life time earnings measures and educational attainments adding variables for the <b>grandparent</b> <b>and</b> great <b>grandparent</b> generations, respectively. We find that <b>grandparents</b> <b>and</b> even great <b>grandparents</b> significantly influence earnings and education. We then estimate the so called Becker-Tomes model using the educational attainment of the great grandparent generation as an instrumental variable. We fail to find support for the model’s predictions. Intergenerational income mobility; earnings distribution; income inequality...|$|R

40|$|The state removes {{children}} from ‘failed’ parents {{to give them}} a better experience of parenting. This article examines the role that the state plays as parent to young mothers in care <b>and</b> <b>grandparent</b> to their children, drawing on a small-scale study undertaken in western Canada using grounded theory methodology. The findings were bleak: the state as parent <b>and</b> <b>grandparent</b> also fails these children. We consider why this is the case and make suggestions for ways forward by critiquing the ideology of familialism that underpins the state’s punitive approach to these young mothers and their children. We also call for policies and a practice that enable practitioners to address structural inequalities such as poverty and racism alongside the capacity to respond to the personal needs of the young women and their children as young people with dignity and rights...|$|R
