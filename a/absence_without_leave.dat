Terms of imprisonment were often suspended, to discourage soldiers from committing an offence to escape the front lines, but also to give a convicted man a chance to earn a reprieve for good conduct.|$|E

He sold cannabis and stole car stereos to earn extra cash, but he was not making enough to support his pregnant girlfriend. Once his daughter was born, he joined the United States Army. Marrow served a four-year tour in the 25th Infantry Division. [...] He was in a group that was charged with the theft of a rug. While awaiting trial, he received a $2,500 bonus check and decided to go <b>Absence</b> <b>Without</b> <b>Leave</b> (UA), yet he returned a month later after the rug had been returned.

50|$|Among the {{important}} masters of these tradition at the time, {{the names of}} Mollā ʿAli Nuri (died 1830-31) and Mollā Esmāʿil Eṣfahāni, a student of Nuri, were prominent. They taught Islamic philosophy, mostly of Sadr al-Din Shirazi and his school. He remained in Isfahan for around eight or nine years, where he studied under these two undisputed masters of Mulla Sadra's school of philosophy. He concentrated on the main works of Mulla Sadra, such as the Asfar and Al-Shawahed al-Robubiya. Simultaneously, he also studied Islamic jurisprudence with Aqa Mohammad 'Ali Najafi, {{one of the major}} Shia scholars of Isfahan. In Isfahan, Sabzevari lived a life of pietry despite having received a substantial inheritance. According to the orientalist Edward Browne, “he used to take pains to discover which of the students stood most in need of pecuniary help, and would then secretly place sums of money in their room during their <b>absence,</b> <b>without</b> <b>leaving</b> any clue that would lead to the identification of the donor. In this way he is said to have expended no less than 100,000 tumáns (about 30,000 Pounds Sterling), while he was in Isfahan, leaving himself only so much as he deemed necessary for his own maintenance”.|$|R
5000|$|That same day, {{police chief}} Ronald dela Rosa warned police {{officers}} and personnel involved in illegal drug trade with the option to voluntarily surrender within 48 hours or [...] "take an <b>absence</b> <b>without</b> official <b>leave,</b> continue being a drug lord, and declare war against the police." [...] On July 5, 2016, Duterte revealed the names of five police officials who were allegedly involved in illegal drug trade. On July 7, during a press conference, Duterte presented a chart identifying three Chinese nationals who serve as drug lords in the Philippines. Chief dela Rosa added that there are 23 mayors on Duterte's list of officials involved in illegal drug trade.|$|R
2500|$|The Cistercian order {{maintained}} the independent organic {{life of the}} individual houses: each abbey having its own abbot elected by its own monks, its own community belonging to itself {{and not to the}} order in general, and its own property and finances administered without outside interference. Yet on the other hand, all the abbeys were subjected to the General Chapter, the constitutional body which exercised vigilance over the Order. [...] Made up of all the abbots, the General Chapter met annually in mid-September at Cîteaux. Attendance was compulsory, and <b>absence</b> <b>without</b> <b>leave</b> was severely punished. [...] The Abbot of Cîteaux presided over the chapter. [...] He had a predominant influence and the power of enforcing everywhere exact conformity to Cîteaux in all details of the exterior life observance, chant, and customs. The principle was that Cîteaux should always be the model to which all the other houses had to conform. In case of any divergence of view at the chapter, the opinion espoused by the Abbot of Cîteaux always prevailed.|$|E
60|$|His {{room was}} on the ground floor, and had a lattice window which opened like a door into the back premises. He pushed the window and found that it opened. What a chance! Mrs Scholtz was still asleep, and snoring. <b>Absence</b> <b>without</b> <b>leave</b> was his chief delight. In two minutes he was deep in the jungle, panting. Knowing from long and bitter {{experience}} that he would be pursued by the inveterate Mrs Scholtz, the urchin ran up the kloof, bent on placing the greatest possible space between him and his natural enemy in the shortest possible time. In this way he was not long of drawing near to the leopard's point of observation.|$|E
60|$|The {{discovery}} that most vexed Jenny was that Sirenwood {{had so much}} of his time. He seemed to be asked to come to dinner whenever Sir Harry saw him, or a chair was left vacant at a party; and though his Rector was inexorable as to releasing him on casual notice from the parish avocations of three nights in the week, the effect was grumbling as savage as was possible from so good-humoured a being; and now and then a regular <b>absence</b> <b>without</b> <b>leave,</b> and a double growl at the consequent displeasure. It was true that in ten minutes he was as hearty and friendly as ever to his colleagues, but that might be only a proof of his disregard of their reproofs, and their small effect.|$|E
5000|$|French leave is [...] "leave of <b>absence</b> <b>without</b> {{permission}} {{or without}} announcing one's departure", including <b>leaving</b> a party <b>without</b> bidding {{farewell to the}} host.

25|$|In May 1916, {{shortly after}} his arrival in France, Braithwaite was demoted for being absent <b>without</b> <b>leave.</b> The {{following}} month, he was courtmartialed for three offences; a second period of <b>absence</b> <b>without</b> leave; lying to an officer; and falsifying a leave pass. He was sentenced to 60-days Field Punishment No. 2 but continued to disregard military discipline. The following month he escaped confinement and on recapture, a senior NZEF officer recommended that he be returned to New Zealand to serve out his punishment. Sentenced to two years imprisonment for his escape, he was being transferred to a prison facility at Blargies when he evaded his guards and went on the run for two days before being caught. He received a further two-year term of imprisonment.|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{consider}} incidents {{relating to}} <b>absences</b> <b>without</b> permission from authorised leave from a security hospital. Method: A retrospective audit over a 10 -year period of all critical incidents relating to {{leave from the}} High Security Inpatient Services, Brisbane, Australia. Results: There has been a low incidence of patients absenting themselves <b>without</b> permission from <b>leave.</b> Of the 12 patients who went absent without permission over the 10 -year study period, only one patient {{was reported to have}} committed an offence and no patient seriously self-harmed. Conclusions: Attention to patient selection and risk management strategies have been effective in minimising the risk to patients and to the community {{as a direct result of}} <b>absences</b> <b>without</b> permission from authorised leave...|$|R
6000|$|New Year's Day also {{restored}} {{to us the}} pup [...] "Páijí." [...] When quite a babe, it had walked up {{to me in the}} streets of Cairo, evidently claimed acquaintanceship, and straightway followed me into Shepheard's, where; having a certain sneaking belief in metempsychosis, I provided it with bed and board. During our third march to the White Mountain, being given to violent yelps, which startled both mules and camels, the small thing had been left to walk, and had apparently made friends with an Arab goatherd. After nine days' <b>absence</b> <b>without</b> <b>leave,</b> [...] "Páijí" [...] reappeared, with dirty rags tied round its bony back and wasted waist, showing an admirable skeleton, and making the most frantic demonstrations of joy. The loss of the poor little brute had affected all our spirits: we thought that the hyenas and the ravens had seen the last of it; and it received a warm welcome home.|$|E
