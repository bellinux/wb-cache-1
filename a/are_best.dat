5|$|People who are {{asymptomatic}} (for instance, those diagnosed through {{family screening}} or {{only as a}} result of abnormal test results) are generally treated, as the copper accumulation may cause long-term damage in the future. It is unclear whether these people <b>are</b> <b>best</b> treated with penicillamine or zinc acetate.|$|E
5|$|Sivaladapids of {{southern}} and eastern Asia <b>are</b> <b>best</b> known from the Miocene, and the only adapiforms to survive past the Eocene/Oligocene boundary (~34mya). Their relationship to the other adapiforms remains unclear. They had vanished {{before the end of}} the Miocene (~7mya).|$|E

5|$|ZnO reacts {{slowly with}} fatty acids in oils {{to produce the}} {{corresponding}} carboxylates, such as oleate or stearate. ZnO forms cement-like products when mixed with a strong aqueous solution of zinc chloride and these <b>are</b> <b>best</b> described as zinc hydroxy chlorides. This cement was used in dentistry.|$|E
5|$|A {{striking}} {{feature of}} metabolism is {{the similarity of}} the basic metabolic pathways and components between even vastly different species. For example, the set of carboxylic acids that <b>are</b> <b>best</b> known as the intermediates in the citric acid cycle are present in all known organisms, being found in species {{as diverse as the}} unicellular bacterium Escherichia coli and huge multicellular organisms like elephants. These striking similarities in metabolic pathways are likely due to their early appearance in evolutionary history, and their retention because of their efficacy.|$|E
50|$|All matches {{up to and}} {{including}} the quarter-finals <b>were</b> <b>best</b> of 3 frames, semi-finals <b>were</b> <b>best</b> of 5 frames and the final <b>was</b> the <b>best</b> of 7 frames. All times are GMT.|$|R
50|$|The {{first round}} of Candidates matches <b>were</b> <b>best</b> of eight games, the semifinals <b>were</b> <b>best</b> of 10, and the final <b>was</b> <b>best</b> of 12. If the scores were tied, sets of two rapid chess games were played as tie breakers, until one player had a lead.|$|R

5|$|Caddisflies <b>are</b> <b>best</b> {{known for}} the {{portable}} cases created by their larvae. About thirty families of caddisfly, members of the suborder Integripalpia, adopt this stratagem. These larvae eat detritus, largely decaying vegetable material, and the dead leaf fragments on which they feed tend to accumulate in hollows, in slow-moving sections of streams and behind stones and tree roots. The cases provide protection to the larvae as {{they make their way}} between these resources.|$|E
5|$|During the 43 {{nomination}} years, 67 {{people have}} been given the Life Achievement Award. Multiple winners have been awarded 20 times, typically two co-winners, though five were noted in 1984. Since 2000 it has become an unofficial tradition for two winners to be announced, often with one winner primarily an author and the other not. While most winners have been authors and editors, five winners have been primarily artists of fantasy art and book covers, and three winners <b>are</b> <b>best</b> known for founding or running publishing houses that produce fantasy works.|$|E
5|$|Hazareesingh (2004) explores how Napoleon's {{image and}} memory <b>are</b> <b>best</b> understood. They {{played a key}} role in {{collective}} political defiance of the Bourbon restoration monarchy in 1815–1830. People from different walks of life and areas of France, particularly Napoleonic veterans, drew on the Napoleonic legacy and its connections with the ideals of the 1789 revolution.|$|E

5|$|Hearing aids or {{cochlear}} implants {{may be used}} if {{the hearing}} loss is severe or prolonged. Hearing aids work by amplifying {{the sound of the}} local environment and <b>are</b> <b>best</b> suited to conductive hearing loss. Cochlear implants transmit the sound that is heard {{as if it were a}} nervous signal, bypassing the cochlea.|$|E
5|$|Heinrich events appear {{related to}} some, but not all, {{of the cold}} periods {{preceding}} the rapid warming events known as Dansgaard-Oeschger (D-O) events, which <b>are</b> <b>best</b> recorded in the NGRIP Greenland ice core. However, difficulties in synchronising marine sediment cores and Greenland ice cores to the same time scale cast aspersions on the accuracy of that statement.|$|E
5|$|In {{the ninth}} century the Scots and Picts {{combined}} under the House of Alpin {{to form a}} single Kingdom of Alba, with a Pictish base and dominated by Gaelic culture. After the reign of King David I in the twelfth century, the Scottish monarchs <b>are</b> <b>best</b> described as Scoto-Norman, preferring French culture to native Scottish culture. Alexander II and his son Alexander III, were able to regain {{the remainder of the}} western seaboard, cumulating the Treaty of Perth with Norway in 1266.|$|E

5|$|Light House {{intentionally}} references the satirical {{novels of}} the early 19th-century British author and satirist Thomas Love Peacock, such as Headlong Hall and Nightmare Abbey. Peacock's novels have little plot and <b>are</b> <b>best</b> known for parodying the intellectual modes and pretenses of his contemporaries; his characters normally assemble in characteristic English country houses and predominantly engage in conversation. Nightmare Abbey satirized the English romantic movement and included characters based on Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Lord Byron, and Percy Bysshe Shelley.|$|E
5|$|Locomotion {{abilities}} <b>are</b> <b>best</b> {{studied for}} Tyrannosaurus {{and there are}} two main issues concerning this: how well it could turn; and what its maximum straight-line speed was likely to have been.Tyrannosaurus may have been slow to turn, possibly taking one to two seconds to turn only 45°– an amount that humans, being vertically oriented and tail-less, can spin in a fraction of a second. The cause of the difficulty is rotational inertia, since much of Tyrannosaurus’ mass was some distance from its center of gravity, like a human carrying a heavy timber.|$|E
5|$|More than 900 {{species of}} crickets are described; the Gryllidae are {{distributed}} {{all around the}} world except at latitudes 55° or higher, with the greatest diversity being in the tropics. They occur in varied habitats from grassland, bushes, and forests to marshes, beaches, and caves. Crickets are mainly nocturnal, and <b>are</b> <b>best</b> known for the loud, persistent, chirping song of males trying to attract females, although some species are mute. The singing species have good hearing, via the tympana (eardrums) on the tibiae of the front legs.|$|E

The stems and flowers are long-lasting if put in water. The flowers, cones and foliage are used in the cut-flower industry.|$|E
5|$|Recommended {{treatment}} for severe malaria is the intravenous use of antimalarial drugs. For severe malaria, parenteral artesunate {{was superior to}} quinine in both children and adults. In another systematic review, artemisinin derivatives (artemether and arteether) were as efficacious as quinine {{in the treatment of}} cerebral malaria in children. Treatment of severe malaria involves supportive measures that <b>are</b> <b>best</b> done in a critical care unit. This includes the management of high fevers and the seizures that may result from it. It also includes monitoring for poor breathing effort, low blood sugar, and low blood potassium.|$|E
5|$|Sweet onions have {{a greater}} water and sugar content than cooking onions. This makes them sweeter and milder tasting, but reduces their shelf life. Sweet onions can be stored refrigerated; they have a shelf life of around 1 month. Irrespective of type, any cut pieces of onion <b>are</b> <b>best</b> tightly wrapped, stored away from other produce, and used within two to three days.|$|E
40|$|This study {{explores the}} {{relationships}} between cooperation, teamwork, and game theory in actual multidisciplinary research teams. Two types of cooperation have been differentiated as ``compliance`` (cooperation, which is enforced by short-term interest) and ``teamwork`` (in which team members give up short-term gains for longer-term gains). ``Compliance`` <b>is</b> <b>best</b> explained by the Principal Agent Theory and <b>is</b> <b>best</b> applied to routine activities. ``Teamwork`` <b>is</b> <b>best</b> explained by a modification of Axelrod`s Theory of Cooperation and <b>is</b> <b>best</b> applied to problem-solving, non-routine activities. These exploratory findings {{have important implications for}} organizational structure considerations and management policies...|$|R
