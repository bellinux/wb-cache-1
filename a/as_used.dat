40|$|Recent {{reports from}} needle {{exchange}} programmes {{and other public}} health initiatives have suggested growing use of anabolic steroids (AS) in the UK and other countries. Data indicate that <b>AS</b> <b>use</b> {{is not confined to}} bodybuilders or high-level sportsmen. Use has spread to professionals working in emergency services, casual fitness enthusiasts and subelite sportsmen and women. Although the precise health consequences of <b>AS</b> <b>use</b> is largely undefined, <b>AS</b> <b>use</b> represents a growing public health concern. Data regarding the consequences of <b>AS</b> <b>use</b> on cardiovascular health are limited to case studies and a modest number of small cohort studies. Numerous case studies have linked <b>AS</b> <b>use</b> with a variety of cardiovascular disease (CVD) events or endpoints, including myocardial infarction, stroke and death. Large-scale epidemiological studies to support these links are absent. Consequently, the impact of <b>AS</b> <b>use</b> upon known CVD risk factors has been studied in relatively small, case-series studies. Data relating <b>AS</b> <b>use</b> to elevated blood pressure, altered lipid profiles and ECG abnormalities have been reported, but are often limited in scope, and other studies have often produced equivocal outcomes. The <b>use</b> of <b>AS</b> has been linked to the appearance of concentric left ventricular hypertrophy as well as endothelial dysfunction but the data again remains controversial. The mechanisms responsible for the negative effect of AS on cardiovascular health are poorly understood, especially in humans. Possibilities include direct effects on myocytes and endothelial cells, reduced intracellular Ca 2 + levels, increased release of apoptogenic factors, as well as increased collagen crosslinks between myocytes. New data relating <b>AS</b> <b>use</b> to cardiovascular health risks are emerging, as novel technologies are developed (especially in non-invasive imaging) that can assess physiological structure and function. Continued efforts to fully document the cardiovascular health consequences of <b>AS</b> <b>use</b> is important to provide a clear, accurate, public health message to the many groups now <b>using</b> <b>AS</b> for performance and image enhancement...|$|R

5|$|A major {{disruption}} to Banksia nomenclature {{occurred in}} 1891, when Otto Kuntze challenged Banksia L.f. {{on the grounds}} that Johann Reinhold Forster and his son Georg had already penned the name Banksia to describe a different genus of plant, and hence Banksia J.R.Forst & G. Forst took precedence and rendered Banksia L.f. (i.e. <b>as</b> <b>used</b> by Linnaeus) invalid. Kuntze transferred all Banksia taxa to the new name Sirmuellera; thus B.dentata became Sirmuellera dentata (L.f.) Kuntze. Kuntze's challenge failed, as did a similar challenge by James Britten in 1905. Britten proposed the generic name Isostylis, republishing B.dentata as Isostylis dentata (L.f.) Britten. In 1940 Banksia L.f. was formally conserved against future challenges.|$|E
5|$|After several modifications, {{the first}} {{production}} variants of the PV-12 were completed in 1936. The first operational aircraft to enter service using the Merlin were the Fairey Battle, Hawker Hurricane and Supermarine Spitfire. The Merlin remains most {{closely associated with}} the Spitfire and Hurricane, although the majority of the production run was for the four-engined Avro Lancaster heavy bomber. A series of rapidly applied developments, brought about by wartime needs, markedly improved the engine's performance and durability. Starting at 1,000hp for the first production models, most late war versions produced just under 1,800hp, and the very latest version <b>as</b> <b>used</b> in the de Havilland Hornet over 2,000hp.
