Unfortunately, Campanelli develops stage fright during filming. Noland then takes over the operation and receives all the acclaim. Kopell returned to {{his role as a}} hospital orderly in two episodes, one in which he causes a furor with a hospital scandal sheet, the other showing Noland having to save him from being fleeced by <b>a</b> <b>patient</b> <b>who</b> is also a card shark.|$|E
5|$|The deadliest fire in Davenport history came on January 7, 1950, when 41 {{people were}} killed in a fire at the St. Elizabeth's Hospital, a mental ward {{operated}} by Mercy Hospital. Most of the people who lost their lives were female patients trapped behind windows locked shut by rusty, iron bars. The cause was attributed to <b>a</b> <b>patient</b> <b>who</b> was lighting curtains on fire with a cigarette lighter.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{follows the}} story of Patti Miller, (Stephanie D'Abruzzo), <b>a</b> <b>patient</b> <b>who</b> mysteriously starts hearing everyone's speech as singing.

5|$|Use of an {{automated}} external defibrillator on a patient in a metal underwire bra can cause burns, and the bra should be removed by the first responder before the AED is applied. In their 2007 season, the television program MythBusters tested the possibility of burns resulting from using a defibrillator on <b>a</b> <b>patient</b> <b>who</b> is using an underwire bra, and concluded that while it is possible, {{it is not likely}} unless the metal underwire is exposed and paddles of the defibrillator are very close to it.|$|E
5|$|In 1848, German anatomist Johann Heinrich Meckel {{recorded}} black-brown pigment granules in {{the blood}} and spleen of <b>a</b> <b>patient</b> <b>who</b> {{had died in a}} mental hospital. Meckel was thought to have been looking at malaria parasites without realizing it; he did not mention malaria in his report. He hypothesized that the pigment was melanin. The causal relationship of pigment to the parasite was established in 1880, when French physician Charles Louis Alphonse Laveran, working in the military hospital of Constantine, Algeria, observed pigmented parasites inside the red blood cells of malaria sufferers. He witnessed the events of exflagellation and became convinced that the moving flagella were parasitic microorganisms. He noted that quinine removed the parasites from the blood. Laveran called this microscopic organism Oscillaria malariae and proposed that malaria was caused by this protozoan. This discovery remained controversial until the development of the oil immersion lens in 1884 and of superior staining methods in 1890–1891.|$|E
5|$|Mercedes has {{sex with}} Dr. Paul Browning (Joe Thompson), who assumes {{she is a}} prostitute and pays her afterwards. Mercedes becomes a cleaner in a {{hospital}} along with Lynsey. Mercedes meets Doctor Browning {{at the hospital and}} he asks to keep seeing and paying Mercedes, which she agrees to. Mercedes convinces Lynsey to help <b>a</b> <b>patient</b> <b>who</b> is DNR. Lynsey is blamed for the incident and Mercedes discovers Doctor Browning had not put the patient's DNR request into their file. Mercedes discovers Doctor Browning is married and threatens him, telling him she will tell his wife of their relationship should he report Lynsey. Mercedes joins an escorting website. She is contacted by a client and arranges to meet him at a hotel. Lynsey finds Mercedes and stops her going ahead with it. Mercedes becomes depressed and Jacqui meets Riley, telling him if Mercedes were to see Bobby then she would feel better. Riley later arrives back in Hollyoaks asking Mercedes to sign legal documents so he will have full custody of Bobby. Mercedes and Riley agree to attend mediation, but Mercedes does not turn up as she gets drunk. Mercedes sees an online news article showing a picture of Riley and Mitzeee (Rachel Shenton) together and considers running away with Bobby, but instead attends Bobby's christening service and slaps Mitzeee. She witnesses Riley and Mitzeee kissing in the car park and later confronts them. Mercedes begins stalking Mitzeee who leaves the village temporarily. Mercedes learns Silas will not be put to trial and will be put in an institute for the insane. Mercedes tells people she is fine but begins having nightmares of her time imprisoned by Silas. Mercedes meets up with Doctor Browning and has sex with him. Mercedes begins escorting again and while meeting a client, locks herself in the bathroom. Lynsey arrives and comforts Mercedes.|$|E

25|$|A shear is a {{separation}} of the skin from underlying tissues.

25|$|Treatment, {{a set of}} {{management}} techniques, is specific to DSPD. It is different from treatment of insomnia, and recognizes the patients' ability to sleep well on their own schedules, while addressing the timing problem. Success, if any, may be partial; for example, <b>a</b> <b>patient</b> <b>who</b> normally awakens at noon may only attain a wake time of 10 or 10:30 with treatment and follow-up.

25|$|Collateral {{information}} or parallel information is information obtained from family, friends or treatment providers of the patient.
