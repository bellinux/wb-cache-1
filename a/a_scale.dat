40|$|Fitness sharing {{has been}} used widely in genetic {{algorithms}} for multi-objective function optimization and machine learning. It is often implemented with <b>a</b> <b>scaling</b> function, which adjusts an individual's raw fitness to improve {{the performance of the}} genetic algorithm. However, choosing <b>a</b> <b>scaling</b> function is <b>an</b> ad hoc affair that lacks sufficient theoretical foundation, and which often gives results that need further processing with a hill-climbing algorithm. Although this is already known, an explanation as to why this is so has been lacking. This paper explains why fitness sharing with <b>a</b> <b>scaling</b> function performs in this way. We investigate fitness sharing's performance at multiobjective optimization, demonstrate the need for <b>a</b> <b>scaling</b> function of some kind, and discuss what form of scaling function works best.
