5|$|The lower tier of the Southern Stand is {{reserved}} for <b>away</b> supporters, {{with most of the}} stand being seated. The western part of the stand, however, is converted into terracing for domestic league games. The area reserved for <b>away</b> supporters varies from game to game depending on how many <b>away</b> fans are expecting: the allocation's size is altered by restricting access to and from the area with large safety nets, which are laid across the seating and supervised by stewards. The <b>away</b> section is small for most Allsvenskan matches, with the most notable exceptions being matches against Helsingborgs IF, AIK, Djurgårdens IF, and IFK Göteborg. These matches tend to draw larger <b>away</b> attendances, and the <b>away</b> area is therefore accordingly expanded across the entire lower tier of the Southern Stand.|$|E

5|$|A 2–1 <b>away</b> defeat to Barrow saw {{the team}} {{knocked out of}} the FA Trophy in the quarter-final, Pacquette scoring for York. York {{suffered}} a second straight league defeat after being beaten 2–1 <b>away</b> by Forest Green Rovers, in which Mackin scored after his shot hit {{the back of an}} opposition player. Chester's expulsion from the Football Conference resulted in York having the three points gained against them from a 3–2 victory expunged, meaning the team moved down to sixth in the table. York were defeated 2–1 at home by Salisbury, after Sangaré had put the team in the lead. Chesterfield midfielder Paul Harsley joined on loan {{until the end of the}} season, and made his debut in a 0–0 draw <b>away</b> to Altrincham, a result that ended a run of three consecutive defeats. York's first victory in six league matches was a 1–0 <b>away</b> win over Mansfield, Pitt scoring his first goal for the club. McWilliams was loaned out to Northern Premier League Premier Division club Whitby Town for one month. A second successive victory came after Barrett scored the only goal in a 1–0 <b>away</b> victory over Kidderminster. Graham opened the scoring in a 1–1 home draw with Tamworth, who equalised through former York player Chris Smith. A 4–0 victory <b>away</b> to Grays saw Brodie score for the first time since January 2010 with two goals; Harsley and Barrett also scored.|$|E
