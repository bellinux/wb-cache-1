40|$|The {{divalent}} ion {{requirements of}} rabbit platelet injury by endotoxin have been {{defined by the}} use of various <b>anticoagulant</b> <b>solutions</b> and have been compared to the divalent ion requirements of platelet injury produced by addition of antigen to immune platelet-rich plasma. The endotoxin-platelet interaction takes place in citrated blood. Platelet damage by antigen is inhibited by citrate, but preincubation of antigen and immune platelet-poor plasma in the absence of citrate results in a substance, presumably antigen-antibody complement complex, which then does injure platelets in the presence of citrate. Neither endotoxin nor preincubated antigen injures platelets in the presence of sodium EDTA in concentrations sufficient to interact with all divalent cations present in plasma. These observations have been interpreted by viewing the platelet-endotoxin interaction as a consequence of platelet phagocytosis of endotoxin, a reaction not requiring complement but requiring definite small concentrations of divalent cations. The interaction of antigen and platelets is regarded as a two phase reaction, the first requiring the participation of complement and concentrations of divalent cation larger than those provided in citrated plasma, the second requiring smaller concentrations of divalent cation, no further participation of complement, and active in citrated plasma. This second phase is regarded as representing platelet phagocytosis of immune complexes...|$|R

30|$|Strategies for the {{prevention}} of intraluminal thrombosis include forcible flushing with saline of both DC lumens to clear them of blood at the beginning {{and at the end of}} each RRT session, anticoagulant interdialytic locking, and careful closing of the clamp on the catheter after interdialytic lock instillation. Concentrated heparin is the most popular interdialytic <b>anticoagulant</b> <b>solution</b> used for DC locking, even though no clinical study in critically ill patients has assessed its efficacy and safety. A recent, prospective, randomized, monocentric study of 78 patients in a surgical ICU suggests that 46.7 % sodium citrate locks reduce DC dysfunction rates and increase DC life span compared with serum saline locks [20]. When thrombosis is limited to the DC lumen, DC locking with fibrinolytic agents, such as urokinase and alteplase, is effective in restoring DC patency in chronic dialysis patients [17]. Whether this intervention is safe in critically ill patients remains unknown and therefore the use of fibrinolytic locks cannot yet be recommended.|$|E
40|$|The haemostatic {{quality of}} plasma for {{transfusion}} {{is liable to}} be affected by techniques for preparation and storage. We have studied changes in the contact system, coagulation and fibrinolysis under the following conditions: blood drawn into a half-strength citrate <b>anticoagulant</b> <b>solution,</b> virus inactivation of plasma with methylene blue and red light, and plasma storage in the fluid phase. Blood is normally drawn into a citrate-phosphate-dextrose (CPD) <b>anticoagulant</b> <b>solution.</b> We evaluated the stability of factor VIII other coagulation factors and their inhibitors in blood drawn into half-strength citrate CPD (0. 5 CPD) and kept at room temperature for eight hours before component preparation., We found no activation of the contact system or coagulation, but a significantly increased stability of coagulation factors VIII and IX. During virus inactivation of single donor units of fresh plasma with methylene blue and red light, the concentration of clottable fibrinogen was unchanged but functional fibrinogen decreased in a light-dose dependent manner. Turbidity measurements of fibrin gel showed a lower fibrin fiber mass-to-length ratio after the treatment, indicating a tighter fibrin gel Structure. Normal clot stability and fibrinolysis were found. L-histidine added to plasma before the treatment normalized the prolonged thrombin-induced coagulation time in a dosedependent way. We defined cold activation of plasma as an elevated kallikrein-like activity. During storage of plasma from male donors at + 4 ºC for 42 days, the cumulative frequency of cold activated plasma units increased in a time-dependent manner. When tested on two occasions, the majority of cold activators remained the same and so did the majority of non-cold activators. However, large intraindividual differences in the onset days of cold activation were observed in plasma of some of our male donors. Cold activation was associated {{with a high degree of}} activation of the contact system and coagulation. Minor changes in fibrinolysis were observed. We have developed a method, to be used before storage, for the selection of transfusion plasma units stable at + 4 ºC for a certain period. In plasma units with short lag phase before cold activation, an imbalance was found between the functional levels of the contact proteins and their inhibitors on day 0, which suggests a mechanism leading to cold activation. An additional mechanism may be involved. In conclusion, we have found an increased stability of factors VIII and IX in 0. 5 CPD. We have demonstrated changes in fibrin polymerization and gel structure after the methylene blue and red light treatment, and an activation of the contact system and coagulation during plasma storage at + 4 ºC For a uniform quality of transfusion plasma units, it is important to maintain normal functional levels of all haemostatic proteins, including zymogen forms of proteinases, cofactors and proteinase inhibitors. An exclusion of cold-activated plasma units would increase the stability of several haemostatic proteins during storage at + 4 ºC...|$|E

Higher education, attitude toward the utility allow to dry antiseptic, and the need of washing hands before wearing gloves for access to port infusion were predictors of performing skin antiseptic and aseptic technique for dressing the catheter insertion site. Educational interventions should be implemented to address the gaps regarding knowledge and practice regarding the prevention of CLABSIs and to ensure that nurses use evidence-based prevention interventions...|$|R

It was believed that peptides of glycophorins A and B contribute to the sialic acid-dependent ligand for invasion. However, P. falciparum invades MkMk human erythrocytes that are deficient in glycophorins A and B (Hadley, T. J., et al., unpublished data). Furthermore, the sialic acid on MkMk cells required by Camp parasites is not carried on the glycophorins (Hadley, T. J., et al., unpublished data).

40|$|This study aims {{to observe}} the wicking and {{separation}} characteristics of blood plasma in a cotton thread matrix functioning as a microfluidic thread-based analytical device (μTAD). We investigated several cotton thread treatment methods using ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) <b>anticoagulant</b> <b>solution</b> for wicking whole blood samples and separating its plasma. The blood of healthy Indonesian thin tailed sheep {{was used in this}} study to understand the properties of horizontal wicking and separation on the EDTA-treated μTAD. The wicking distance and blood cell separation from its plasma was observed for 120 s and documented using a digital phone camera. The results show that untreated cotton-threads stopped the blood wicking process on the μTAD. On the other hand, the deposition of EDTA anticoagulant followed by its drying on the thread at room temperature for 10 s provides the longest blood wicking with gradual blood plasma separation. Furthermore, the best results in terms of the longest wicking and the clearest on-thread separation boundary between blood cells and its plasma were obtained using the μTAD treated with EDTA deposition followed by 60 min drying at refrigerated temperature (2 - 8 °C). The separation length of blood plasma in the μTADs treated with dried-EDTA at both room and refrigerated temperatures was not statistically different (P > 0. 05). This separation occurs through the synergy of three factors, cotton fiber, EDTA anticoagulant and blood platelets, which induce the formation of a fibrin-filter via a partial coagulation process in the EDTA-treated μTAD. An albumin assay was employed to demonstrate the efficiency of this plasma separation method during a one-step assay on the μTAD. Albumin in blood is an important biomarker for kidney and heart disease. The μTAD has a slightly better limit of detection (LOD) than conventional blood analysis, with an LOD of 114 mg L- 1 compared to 133 mg L- 1, respectively. However, the μTAD performed faster to get results after 3 min compared to 14 min for centrifuged analysis of sheep blood samples. In conclusion, on-thread dried-EDTA anticoagulant deposition was able to increase the wicking distance and has a better capability to separate blood plasma and is suitable for combining separation and the assay system in a single device...|$|E

An evaluation of these mutations in combination with previously described point mutations in the factor IX gene of Asians indicates that transitions predominate followed by transversions and microdeletions/insertions. Transitions at the dinucleotide CpG are a dramatic hot spot of mutation. This pattern of mutation {{is very similar to}} that observed in Caucasians with hemophilia B, despite the many differences between Asians (mostly Koreans) and Caucasians in diet, environment and cultural life-styles. The similarity may reflect the predominance of endogenous processes or ubiquitous mutagens rather than specific mutagens in the environment. The following additional conclusions emerge: (1) The missense mutations in Asians occur at evolutionarily conserved amino acids. When combined with the previous data this makes it likely that {{more than two-thirds of the}} missense mutations which could possibly occur at nonconserved amino acids do not cause hemophilia B. (2) Surprisingly, a change in the sixth base of the intron 2 donor splice-junction sequence is associated with severe disease in HB 74 / 77.

The parallel-plate flow chamber technique has been extensively used to measure platelet adhesion and activation in vitro at arterial or venous flow conditions. However, current tests use collagen as the only platelet-adhesive surface, thereby disregarding the contribution of other platelet-adhesive components in the vascular matrix. This is a relevant issue, since multiple platelet adhesive receptors need to interact and signal to form a stable platelet thrombus. On type I collagen fibers, the two collagen receptors, glycoprotein VI (GPVI) and integrin α 2 β 1 (GPIa/IIa) interact with the receptors for von Willebrand factor (vWF), a plasma protein that avidly binds to collagen, i. e. GPIb-V-IX and integrin αIIbβ 3 (GPIIb/IIIa). (6 - 8) It is hence relevant to compare the roles of these receptors with other ones, such as CLEC- 2, CD 36 (GPIV), and the integrins α 5 β 1, α 6 β 1 and αvβ 3. In the accompanying paper, we have described a microspot technology, in which various platelet-adhesive compounds can be coated simultaneously in a flow chamber, and directly compared for their potential to support thrombus formation using small blood samples. (9) When forming a thrombus, platelets show different types of responses, all of which may contribute to effective hemostasis and pathological thrombosis. These include shape change (pseudopod and lamellipod formation), integrin activation, secretion of the contents of dense granules and α-granules (P-selectin exposure), and actin-dependent contraction of the formed thrombus. (1, 5) In addition, a subpopulation of the platelets – with high cytosolic Ca 2 + – assumes a balloon-type of morphology and exposes the procoagulant phospholipid phosphatidylserine (PS) at their outer surface, at which coagulation factors bind and thrombin can be formed. (10) Since it is unclear how these different platelet responses relate during thrombus formation, we developed procedures to measure these in a systematic way in combination with the microspot technology. (9) In this protocol paper, we describe the use of brightfield and confocal fluorescence microscopy to record the various platelet activation processes contributing to thrombus formation; and we give procedures to analyze the acquired microscopic images. We note that all assays are performed in the absence of coagulation. Furthermore, we stress that: due to space restrictions not all details could be given; specific procedures may need adaptation in different laboratories; and that expert knowledge will be required for successful completion of the flow assays. We welcome comments on errors and suggestions for improvement. Content: - A. Flow chamber preparation and whole blood perfusion. - B. Brightfield and fluorescence microscopic imaging of thrombi. - C.

Note: apply either 1 × 3 or 2 × 3 microspots, depending on the possibility to observe these by the microscope. - Humid chamber for storing coated coverslips. - Open parallel-plate flow chamber: transparent polycarbonate block with engraved flow channel (50 μm depth, 3 mm width, 30 cm length, inlet/outlet tubes at an angle of 11 °). The Maastricht chamber has been described before. It needs to be fixed in an aluminium holder with screws. 4 - Silicon tubing (0. 28 mm ID, 0. 61 mm OD; Rubber BV Hilversum). - Blunt syringe needles (18 gauge) to connect with tubing. - Surgical tweezers to clamp tubing. - Pulse-free syringe perfusion pump Type 100 (Harvard Instruments). - Needle or system for blood drawing (e. g., 23 gauge). - Plastic syringes 1 mL (Becton-Dickinson). - 5 mL polystyrene tube (Greiner Bio-One). ### Procedure **Procedures A. Flow chamber preparation and whole blood perfusion** **A 1. Preparation of coverslips** *CRITICAL. Wash cleaned coverslips thoroughly with water*. - 1. Degrease new coverslips (use tweezers) with 2 M HCl in 50 % ethanol. - 2. Wash coverslips twice with milliQ water to remove residual HCl. - 3. Leave coverslips to dry on drying rack. **A 2. Coating of coverslips** *CRITICAL. Prevent drying of biological material on coverslip by storing in humid environment*. - 4. Prepare coating material (collagen, collagen peptide, decorin, fibrinogen, fibronectin, laminin, osteopontin, rhodocytin, thrombospondin, vitronectin, vWF), at 50 - 250 μg/mL, as described. (9) - 5. Mount coverslip onto precision mall for coating. - 6. Apply 0. 5 µL of coating solution(s) in the assigned place(s), and remove from the mall. - 7. Store coverslip in humid environment to prevent drying out of microspots. Allow coating material to bind for 60 minutes at room temperature. - 8. Block uncoated glass with blocking buffer, and leave in humid environment for 30 minutes. - 9. Wash blocked coverslip with saline. If not immediately used, leave coverslip in humid environment to prevent drying. **A 3. Assembly of coverslip and flow chamber** *CRITICAL. Check for leakage of the mounted flow chamber. Also check rigorously for absence of air bubbles before starting the experiment. Note that temperature changes can lead to appearance of air bubbles. Keep inlet tubing as short as possible* - 10. Connect tubing to inlet and outlet of the flow chamber. - 11. Rinse chamber and tubing with flow buffer, check for absence of air bubbles, and mount coated coverslip on top of chamber. - 12. Place chamber with coverslip in aluminium holder and tighten screws. - 13. Check that flow chamber system is leak-tight by perfusion with flow buffer, flush out any bubbles in chamber. **A 4. Drawing of human blood by venipuncture** *CRITICAL: Before drawing human blood, obtain permission from your Medical Ethical Committee, according to the local and national regulations, and get full informed consent from donor. Coagulation (traces of thrombin) need to be rigorously prevented by drawing without constraints, mixing well with anticoagulant, and incubation at 37 oC. Note that PPACK is only shortly active as an anticoagulant at neutral pH. Other possible errors are described elsewhere. (4) * - 14. Add 0. 5 mL saline into a 5 mL polystyrene blood collection tube. Add 40 U/mL (f. c.) fragmin, and add 40 µM PPACK (f. c.) just before venipuncture. - 15. Draw blood according to local protocols, and let smoothly flow into collection tube. Directly mix blood with <b>anticoagulant</b> <b>solution.</b> We prefer an open system using a 23 gauge needle, to ensure undisturbed flow.

40|$|Atrial {{fibrillation}} is the world's {{most common}} sustained cardiac arrhythmia and {{is associated with}} a significantly increased risk of stroke. The global burden of atrial fibrillation is rising, commensurate with the ageing population. Well-controlled vitamin K antagonist-based anticoagulation has been shown {{to reduce the risk of}} stroke secondary to atrial fibrillation by two-thirds. However, patients with atrial fibrillation have frequently been denied anticoagulation because of a variety of perceived risks related to bleeding, falls, chronological age, and poor compliance. Even when vitamin K antagonists are used, maximum benefit and safety are only delivered when high quality control of therapy (TTR > 70 %) is achieved, which has proven remarkably difficult in many health-care systems and amongst many patient groups. The non-vitamin K antagonist oral <b>anticoagulants</b> (NOACs) offer <b>solutions</b> to many of the challenges of achieving widespread, safe, and effective anticoagulation for stroke prophylaxis in atrial fibrillation, yet their uptake into routine clinical practice remains variable. The evidence supporting their more widespread use to overcome the challenges of stroke prophylaxis for atrial fibrillation is reviewed in this article...|$|R
40|$|AbstractCryopreservation of {{stem cells}} after {{collection}} from peripheral blood or bone marrow for autologous transplantation necessitates protection with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Unfortunately, DMSO, when infused with the thawed cell suspension, may induce serious complications and side effects. To assess whether depletion of DMSO before autografting affects safety and efficacy, 56 consenting consecutive patients treated with high-dose chemotherapy and autologous blood stem cell transplantation were assigned to obtain either an untreated or DMSO-depleted autograft. On the day of transplantation, the cryopreserved cells were thawed and infused to the patient either immediately or after washing 3 times in normal saline supplemented with 6 % <b>anticoagulant</b> citrate dextrose <b>solution.</b> Cell count with viability, clonogenic assay, and phenotyping were performed before and after thawing and after washing. Hematologic recovery, side effects, and complications were recorded. The in vitro and clinical data on 56 patients show that the depletion of DMSO in vitro before autografting does not induce a significant loss of cell number, viability, colony-forming unit-granulocyte-macrophage activity, or number of CD 34 + cells. Furthermore, it leads to a safe and sustained engraftment. The complications and side effects, as recorded by continuous monitoring, were substantially less; however, the procedure takes 3 to 4 hours of laboratory work per patient...|$|R
40|$|During {{the last}} 90 years many {{developments}} {{have taken place}} in the world of blood transfusion. Several <b>anticoagulants</b> and storage <b>solutions</b> have been developed. Also the blood processing has undergone many changes. At the moment, in The Netherlands, red blood cell (RBC) concentrates (prepared from a whole blood donation and leukocyte-depleted by filtration) are stored for a maximum of 35 days at 4 degrees C in saline adenine glucose mannitol (SAGM). Most relevant studies show that approximately 20 % of the RBCs is lost in the first 24 hr after transfusion. Even more remarkable is that the average life span is 94 days after a storage period of 42 - 49 days. Such observations create the need for a parameter to measure the biological age of RBCs as a possible predictor of the fate of RBCs after transfusion. The binding of IgG to RBCs can lead to recognition and subsequent phagocytosis by macrophages. This occurs during the final stages of the RBC life span in vivo. We determined the quantity of cell-bound IgG during storage, and found considerable variation between RBCs, but no significant storage-related change in the quantity of cell-bound IgG. The significance of this finding for predicting the survival of transfused RBCs in vivo remains to be established. Hereto we developed a flow cytometric determination with a sensitivity of 0. 1 % for the measurement of survival in vivo based on antigenic differences. This technique has various advantages compared with the 'classical' 51 Cr survival method...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this systematic review was to identify and analyze the evidence base supporting the " 30 -minute" and " 4 -hour" rules in transfusion medicine. The 30 -minute rule states that red blood cell (RBC) units left out of controlled temperature storage for more than 30 minutes should not be returned to storage for reissue; the 4 -hour rule states that transfusion of RBC units should be completed within 4 hours of their removal from controlled temperature storage. Eligible studies were identified from searches (to October 2010) {{of a range of}} electronic databases (including The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the National Health Service Blood and Transplant's Transfusion Evidence Library) and contact with transfusion medicine and blood bank experts. Twenty-three studies were identified that measured the quality of the RBC unit (n = 19), bacterial contamination in the RBC unit (n = 4), or both (n = 2) after exposure to greater than 4 °C ± 2 °C from between 20 minutes to 42 days. The overall finding was that temperature exposure did not adversely affect the quality of the RBC units or result in significant bacterial contamination. However, the variation in the temperature of exposure, its duration, the amount of data reported by the individual studies, and the age of the studies (and thus their comparability to current clinical practice) make it difficult to draw significant conclusions. To reliably determine whether these time "rules" could be extended without an adverse risk to the RBC unit requires robust, modern studies using multiple combinations of blood, <b>anticoagulant,</b> and additive <b>solutions</b> with defined temperatures and times of exposure. © 2012...|$|R

Ten millilitre sheep blood was taken into injection syringe containing 3  mL Alsever’s <b>solution</b> (<b>anticoagulant)</b> and transferred to sterile centrifuge tubes. The blood was centrifuged at 1, 600 ×g at room temperature (25  ±  3 °C) for 20  min to separate the plasma from the cells. The supernatant was discarded and centrifuged again adding 6  mL phosphate buffer saline (PBS). The blood cells were washed thrice with PBS by centrifugation and the pellet was resuspended in 6  mL of PBS. Various dilutions of these cells using PBS were prepared and counted {{with the help of}} a haemocytometer under a light microscope so as to obtain cells equivalent to 1  ×  105 cells. The following formula was used to determine the required number of cells: number of cells/mL = number of cells counted in 25 squares × dilution factor ×  104. The cell suspension thus prepared was dispensed into Elisa plates (100  µL/well) and incubated at 37 °C for overnight. The supernatant was removed carefully and 200  µL of the extract and the purified compound was added and incubated further for 24  h. Supernatant was removed again and added 20  µL MTT solutions (5  mg/mL) to each well and incubated further for 3  h at 37 °C on orbital shaker at 60  rpm. After incubation, the supernatant was removed without disturbing the cells and 50  µL DMSO was added to each well to dissolve the formazan crystals. The absorbance was measured at 590  nm using an automated microplate reader (Biorad 680 -XR, Japan). The wells with untreated cells served as control.|$|R
