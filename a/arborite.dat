5000|$|<b>Arborite</b> is {{the leading}} Canadian {{manufacturer}} of high-pressure decorative plastic laminates (HPL). [...] Best known as a counter top surfacing material, laminate is a durable decorative veneer applied to cabinetry, furniture, and other horizontal and vertical surfaces. The original <b>Arborite</b> material was developed in 1942 by the Howard Smith Paper Company as an innovative way to utilize waste by-products of the Canadian papermaking industry, {{and to this day}} laminate is commonly referred to in Canada by the trade name <b>Arborite.</b>|$|E

25|$|CHS {{opened in}} September 1972, after a $100,000 {{renovation}} {{to an empty}} downtown building (constructed in 1925) that had formerly housed Jones Elementary School, a majority African-American school which was closed in 1965 due to re-districting for racial-desegregation purposes. Although members {{of the school board}} proposed naming classrooms after Ann <b>Arborites</b> who had been killed in the Vietnam War, these plans angered local citizens and teachers who opposed the war, and were never implemented.|$|R
50|$|The ONCE Group was a {{collection}} of musicians, visual artists, architects, and film-makers who wished {{to create an environment}} in which artists could explore and share techniques and ideas in the late 1950s and early 1960s. The group was responsible for hosting the ONCE Festival of New Music in Ann Arbor, Michigan, between 1961 and 1966. It was founded by Ann <b>Arborites</b> Robert Ashley, George Cacioppo, Gordon Mumma, Roger Reynolds and Donald Scavarda.|$|R
50|$|NOTE: Many Ann <b>Arborites</b> were charmed {{with the}} beauty of the Frankfort area and built their own summer homes there, {{including}} Dr. Ruthven’s sister-in-law. The pink art deco house next door to the Ruthvens was built by the Dean of the Medical School, Dr. Furstenberg. Mrs. Canfield, widow of a prominent medical doctor in Ann Arbor, built the house now known as the “King House” and the property where “The Bluffs” stands. In downtown Frankfort, there is no consistency in the naming of the cross streets. For example, it doesn’t go 1st, 2nd, 3rd streets. Instead, what should be 1st street is actually called Michigan Avenue. According to Beatrice (Nesbitt) Ruthven, when all of the University of Michigan people moved up to Frankfort and built homes on the street, it was referred to as “Michigan Avenue,” and the name stuck.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Arborite,</b> {{a similar}} and also popular paper-melamine composite, was {{developed}} in Canada in the 1940s.|$|E
5000|$|By {{the early}} 1950s, <b>Arborite</b> was {{available}} in more than 60 colors and patterns, mostly solid colors and wood grains. In 1954, Western Woods built 10 trend houses across Canada, representing the epitome in modern design and materials. [...] <b>Arborite</b> was chosen for kitchen and bathroom surfaces {{in many of these}} model homes. 1958 saw the introduction of new lines of pastel Glitter and Metallic Tone laminates, closely followed by Stardust (a random breakup pattern) and Fantasy (abstract mid-century stars). Woodgrain patterns at this time included Sliced Walnut, Fawn English Walnut and Blond Persian Walnut.|$|E

50|$|Only one {{incident}} {{has been reported}} to the National Transportation Safety Board since 2000: an airplane left the side of the runway, attributed to pilot error. Before 2000, three doctors were killed on a football Saturday when they crashed into the runway. Runway expansions have been proposed since the 1980s but have been denied on each occasion by city councils. The need for runway expansion on safety grounds is unclear as purported over-runs were actually {{off the side of the}} runway and attributed to pilot error after investigation. The most recent proposed runway expansion project, first floated to the Ann Arbor City Council in 2007, proposes lengthening the runway by 800 feet, and moving the entire runway toward the south west corner of the airport (closer to neighboring residential subdivisions). This would not change the airport's classification but could affect the size of the aircraft using the airport; the decision to land is made on an individual basis at the discretion of the pilot. All B-II small aircraft are currently capable of operating on the existing 3,505 ft runway without weight restriction. However, larger airplanes (jets) already do use this B-II certified runway but with weight and fuel restrictions. Any extension to the runway will not change the operation of B-II classification aircraft, but will allow larger aircraft (jets in the C-I and C-II categories) to land and operate out of the airport with full weight and fuel. The proposal is undergoing environmental impact studies, but has experienced delays because of initial inaccuracies supplied in the proposal, prolonged review by the FAA, and opposition from Pittsfield Township and the local citizens' group Committee for Preserving Community Quality, made up of citizens from Pittsfield and Lodi, as well as some Ann <b>Arborites</b> who view the project as too expensive or unlikely to be approved. On March 24, 2009, Pittsfield unanimously approved a Resolution Opposing Proposed Expansion of the Ann Arbor Municipal Airport Runway. Lodi Township, which is adjacent to Pittsfield on the west side and also impacted by ARB, passed a similar resolution on May 12, 2009. A legal petition has been made to the Secretary of Transportation Washington, D.C. in opposition to the proposed expansion.|$|R
5000|$|The 1970s saw a {{shift in}} marketing, from the {{residential}} market to a more corporate focus. <b>Arborite</b> was advertised as [...] "An excellent choice for architects, designers and furniture manufacturers alike." ...|$|E
5000|$|Production presses were {{established}} and a company was formed. Edmund Howard Smith {{went on to}} become Arborite's first president, with George Tomlinson Jr. as his chief engineer. <b>Arborite</b> was the first commercial decorative melamine laminate. The manufacturing facility was opened in 1948 in LaSalle, Quebec, where it still is to this day. [...] By early 1949, <b>Arborite</b> was being advertised as the [...] "only all-Canadian" [...] laminate on the market, available in 35 [...] "solid colors, as well as a series of five colored fabric designs, two tones of [...] "marble" [...] and a wide variety of simulated wood grains." ...|$|E
50|$|Then, in 1963, {{came one}} of the most pivotal changes {{in the history of the}} company. Howard Smith Paper Mills Ltd. was {{acquired}} by Domtar Inc, {{one of the}} largest manufacturing enterprises in Canada at the time; <b>Arborite</b> was now a division of Domtar Construction materials.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Arborite</b> was {{originally}} marketed not to design or construction firms, but directly to housewives {{looking for a}} [...] "modern surfacing material". One of the new material's first marketing platforms was the popular Chatelaine ladies’ home magazine, where it was touted as being [...] "tested {{and approved by the}} Chatelaine Institute".|$|E
50|$|The {{principle}} use of {{melamine resin}} is {{as the main}} constituent of high-pressure laminates, such as Formica and <b>Arborite,</b> and of laminate flooring. Melamine-resin tile wall panels {{can also be used}} as whiteboards. Melamine formaldehyde is used in plastic laminate and overlay materials. Formaldehyde is more tightly bound in Melamine Formaldehyde than it is in urea-formaldehyde, reducing emissions.|$|E
50|$|Wilsonart is {{a global}} {{manufacturer}} and distributor of High Pressure Laminates and other engineered composite materials, used in furniture, office and retail space, countertops, worktops and other applications. Headquartered in Temple, Texas, Wilsonart was founded by Ralph Wilson Sr. in 1956. The company sells decorative laminates and other engineered surfaces under the Wilsonart brand and international brands <b>Arborite,</b> Polyrey, and Resopal.|$|E
5000|$|By 1962, <b>Arborite</b> had {{branched}} {{into the}} United Kingdom. This is from Design magazine in 1965: [...] "Arborite decorative laminates only appeared in Britain in 1960, but already they have radically effected the decorative laminates scene here. The company established its name with its woodgrains and marbles, and has recently launched {{the most comprehensive}} plain colour range on the British market, as well as issuing an architectural manual." ...|$|E
5000|$|Over 140 {{patterns}} and colors were available at this point, including East Indian Teak and Black Leather, with [...] "new Metallic and Fabric laminates". Many of the 52 solid colors {{could be seen}} as epitomizing the decade, from Bitter Lemon and Dusty Olive, to Pale Avocado and Minton Blue. Application locations of <b>Arborite</b> laminate included McGill University, high-end hotels, corporate offices and private, architect-designed residences, and Canadian Pacific rail car interiors.|$|E
50|$|The {{beginnings}} of this seminal Michigan band starts {{on the east}} side of Detroit in the late 1960s. Session guitarist Ron Koss, a self-taught musician who paid his dues in the local bar scene and recorded sessions with Wilson Pickett, Marv Johnson, and Hank Ballard, joined forces with classically trained keyboardist John Seanor and rock drummer / percussionist Larry Zack to form the core of “The Scarlet Letter.” The trio decided to find a bass player who could sing and Ann <b>Arborite</b> Al Jacquez was added on lead vocals and bass.|$|E
50|$|Wood is a {{naturally}} occurring composite comprising cellulose fibres in a lignin and hemicellulose matrix. Engineered wood includes {{a wide variety}} of different products such as wood fibre board, plywood, oriented strand board, wood plastic composite (recycled wood fibre in polyethylene matrix), Pykrete (sawdust in ice matrix), Plastic-impregnated or laminated paper or textiles, <b>Arborite,</b> Formica (plastic) and Micarta. Other engineered laminate composites, such as Mallite, use a central core of end grain balsa wood, bonded to surface skins of light alloy or GRP. These generate low-weight, high rigidity materials.|$|E
40|$|Intensive {{plantation}} forestry will {{be increasingly}} important in the next 50 yr to meet the high demand for domestic wood in the United States. However, forest management practices can substantially influence downstream water quality and ecology. This study analyses, the effect of fertilization on effluent water quality of a low gradient drained coastal pine plantation in Carteret County, North Carolina using a paired watershed approach. The plantation consists of three watersheds, two mature (31 -yr) and one young (8 -yr) (age at treatment). One of the mature watersheds was commercially thinned in 2002. The mature unthinned watershed was designated as the control. The young and mature-thinned watersheds were fertilized at different rates with <b>Arborite</b> (Encee Chemical Sales, Inc., Bridgeton, NC), and boron. The outflow rates and nutrient concentrations in water drained {{from each of the}} watershed...|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{this study}} is to assess the fire {{performance}} of laminated wall panels comprised of medium density fibreboard (MDF) core sandwiched between two outer layers of a thin sheet <b>Arborite</b> laminates. Both fire retarded (FR) and non-fire-retarded (NFR) versions of each material were tested by themselves and also in various laminated combinations. In this research, the hypothesis is that the fire performance of each individual material will be mirrored layer by layer in the properties of the overall assembly. Important questions then included, how many of the layers need to contain fire retardant additives to achieve a target performance for the panel assembly? In addition, the effect of the glue used in the construction of the panel was unknown, but it was hypothesized that due to the flammability of most glues, the adhesives have a significant impact on the requirement for FR additives in each layer. The main apparatus used in the investigation is a Cone Calorimeter. Testing followed the ASTM E- 1345 protocol, so the time to ignition, mass loss rates, heat release rates (HRR) during open flaming periods, peak heat release rates and time to reach peak heat release rate were measured. These parameters were used to assess the relative fire performance of each base material and assembly, thus deducing the efficacy of the fire retardant additives in each combination. The panel assembly selected for the present study is typical of laminated MDF panels used as elevator cab lining materials. All materials were obtained from Elevator Cab Renovations (ECR), the industrial partner for much of this work. Both front and backer materials were made by <b>Arborite</b> and both regular NFR and FR versions of each were used. Similarly NFR and FR core MDF specimens were used in custom assembled test panels glued together using Permagrip PG 107, a common glue in the industry. In total seven different individual materials, eight unglued panel assemblies and eight fully assembled and glued laminated panels were tested for this research. In most cases, three repeat tests were run for each specimen to determine repeatability and, where necessary, allowing averaging to reduce overall variability in the results. Key performance indicators were determined using the results from each test and the relationships between various combinations of samples were examined. A recommendation is presented that FR additives should be used in the front and core sections of the panel assembly. This is based on the results across all tests and the observations made regarding the effectiveness of FR additives to each individual material, as well as to the panel assembly. It was also concluded that there is no strong evidence to demonstrate that the use of NFR backer materials significantly reduces the fire performance characteristics of the panel assembly when FR additives are used in the other two layers. Finally, there is strong evidence that the glue in a laminated assembly does lead to increased values of measured HRR, and also has a discernible effect on the rate of Carbon Monoxide (CO) production from the assembly...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2017 - 08 The coupled {{role of the}} {{terrestrial}} nitrogen (N) and carbon (C) cycles is of increasing importance, {{particularly in light of}} global climate change. Forested ecosystems contain over half of {{the terrestrial}} C pool and currently absorb as much as 30 % of anthropogenic CO 2 emissions. Many forests, particularly Douglas-fir forests in the Pacific Northwest, are growth limited with respect to N. Fertilizers are therefore applied in commercially managed forests to increase productivity and timber yields. However, high N inputs can saturate the biological demand for N and lead to increased rates of N loss through leaching and gas loss via denitrification and volatilization. To improve N use efficiency one approach is the application of Enhanced Efficiency Fertilizers (EEFs) designed to limit N losses to volatilization. In this dissertation, the recovery rates of three different EEFs including Environmentally Smart Nitrogen (ESN), N-(n-butyl) (NBPT), and <b>Arborite</b> coated urea fertilizer (CUF), are compared to the recovery rates of an unformulated urea fertilizer. Using 15 N enriched fertilizer I determined both short term N losses (0 - 4 weeks after fertilization) and how the applied N is partitioned between ecosystem pools one year after fertilization. After four weeks, a mean of 60 % of the applied N was recovered in the soil and forest floor. Retention rates were not significantly improved with the use of EEFs. After 1 -year, N recovery was low across all sites and fertilizer types with a mean of 39. 0 %. The remaining N could not be accounted for in the pools we sampled. The largest fertilizer pool was the top 20 cm of mineral soil. Again, after 1 -year, no differences were found between EEFs and the standard urea fertilizer. Monitoring of nitrogen (N) inputs to forested ecosystems in China has historically been limited despite known negative effects that high N additions can have on environmental and human health. To better understand terrestrial patterns of foliar, soil, and wood δ 15 N relative to soil N concentrations (%N) in a heavily polluted region, two Chinese parasol tree (Firmiana simplex) groves adjacent to a industrialized basin were examined the Loess Plateau, approximately 80 km east of the city of Xi’an, Shaanxi Province, China. The δ 15 N values of ecosystem pools sampled in this study are substantially lower than what is typically observed in temperate forests around the world. Results suggest greater foliar uptake of N in the tree canopies bordering the industrialized basin compared to trees located at the forest interior. N concentrations and δ 15 N of soil and plant tissue were inversely correlated along this transect and indicate higher inputs of N from δ 15 N depleted sources in the basin. Tree ring δ 15 N values declined between 2003 and 2014 during a time of rapid development and expansion of industry in the basin. The projects in the Pacific Northwest and on the Loess Plateau in China are two separate studies. The differences in experimental design and objectives of the two studies does not facilitate comparisons between them...|$|E
