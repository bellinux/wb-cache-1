40|$|A Thomas's splint with an {{adjustable}} ring has been devised with <b>a</b> stainless steel <b>hose</b> <b>clip,</b> {{which can be}} adjusted up to 5 or 7. 5 cm, attached on the lateral side and a hinge attached on the medial aspect of the anterior half of the ring. Thus when there is swelling in {{the upper part of}} the thigh the ring can be widened and when it goes down the ring can be tightened again so that it remains an exact fit. This prevents pressure sores developing and avoids cutting the ring in order to relieve pressure from swelling...|$|R
25|$|Gas-tight {{connections}} between the flexible hoses and rigid fittings are made by using crimped <b>hose</b> <b>clips</b> or ferrules, {{often referred to as}} 'O' clips, over barbed spigots. The use of worm-drive <b>hose</b> <b>clips</b> or Jubilee clips is specifically forbidden in the UK and other countries.|$|R
2500|$|Metabolic chambers: Chambers may be {{glass jars}} with rubber {{stoppers}} for lids; syringe barrels for small animals and insects; or constructed from Plexiglas. Ideally, chambers should be constructed from inert materials; for example, the acrylic plastics can absorb O2 {{and may be}} a poor choice for respirometry with very small insects. Chambers need to be constructed {{in a manner that}} yields rapid mixing of gases within the chamber. [...] The simplest metabolic chamber for a small vertebrate might be a glass jar with a stopper. [...] The stoppers are fitted with two ports: short extensions of Teflon tubing are provided for line connections. Teflon tube extensions are pushed through the bulkhead and the line connection is finished by attaching <b>a</b> small <b>hose</b> <b>clip</b> {{to the base of the}} Teflon tube extension. Additionally, an extension to the inlet port inside the jar should be providedâ€”this ensures that the animal's expiratory gases are not washed away by the in flow stream. The animal is sealed inside and the rubber stopper is held in place with Velcro straps. If an upstream system is used, any metabolic chamber leak will result in loss of animal air and, therefore, an underestimate of the animal's metabolic rate. When you close an animal inside a metabolic chamber, attention must be paid to the seal. To ensure tight seals before closing the lid, firmly work the stopper into the jar and make sure that it is even. Use 1-2 straps (2 are better) and pull tightly. Acrylic (Plexiglas) chambers will be constructed for some uses, but precise engineering will be needed to ensure proper seating; gaskets will help, and judicious use of tight-fitting clamps will minimize leaks.|$|R
5000|$|In many countries, Jubilee Clips tend to {{be known}} almost {{exclusively}} by their brand name, but elsewhere (where the brand is not so well known for example), they are known by generic names such as worm-drive <b>hose</b> <b>clip</b> or <b>hose</b> clamp or <b>hose</b> <b>clip.</b> The Jubilee Clip dominated the market {{to the point where}} the brand name is often used instead of the generic term [...] "hose clamp", particularly in the United Kingdom, Ireland and in some of the former British colonies. It remains the term used in everyday speech in the UK and Ireland.|$|R
40|$|The {{description}} {{relates to}} a process and a device or a tool for the fully automatic assembly of hose locking devices, in particular worm drive <b>hose</b> <b>clips</b> which are attached by a screw connection to lock <b>a</b> <b>hose</b> to <b>a</b> solid or hollow body such as a pipe socket or similar. The invention {{is characterized by the}} fact that <b>an</b> open, unscrewed <b>hose</b> locking device is bent at its point of fixture about the <b>hose</b> in <b>a</b> bending and shaping operation, the tip of the hose locking device is introduced into its lock, and the screw thread in the lock is tightened to secure the hose locking device. The assembly process or the corresponding tool are particularly suitable for a fully automated assembly of hose locking devices by means of an industrial robot, whereby hose assembly on the connecting sockets is fully separated from the following assembly of the hose locking device...|$|R
500|$|In October 2006, Holden {{introduced}} a bi-fuel {{version of the}} Alloytec V6, available to the Omega and Berlina. Able to run on both petrol and LPG, it features an advanced sequential vapour gas injection (SVGI) system and hardened valve seats to cope. The bi-fuel V6 produces [...] and [...] less than the conventional V6 when run on LPG, {{for a total of}} [...] Although LPG prices are lower, the engine uses a large [...] cylindrical gas tank which causes decreased boot space and slightly increased fuel consumption. Holden was {{able to take advantage of}} a loophole in government legislation, allowing an A$2,000 rebate on LPG installation because the unit is fitted post-production by Holden's customisation arm HSVi. Normally, people would only be entitled to a A$1,000 rebate for new cars pre-installed with LPG. Due to the possibility that these bi-fuel Commodores may have been fitted with undersized O-rings in the service valve hand tap, Holden issued a recall affecting the first 981 of these models on 10 April 2007. There were also two VE recalls previous to this. The initial 16 October 2006 recall affecting 1,521 V8 Commodore and WM Statesman/Caprice models involved <b>a</b> faulty fuel <b>hose,</b> causing <b>a</b> fuel smell to enter the cabin. A second 10 November 2006 recall affecting 12,830 Commodores and WM models built prior to 11 September 2006 resulted from defective rear seat belt anchors. On 7 December 2007, another recall was issued for over 86,000 VE and WM V6 models. This was due to the possibility that one of the fuel lines in the engine compartment may have a rub condition with <b>a</b> fuel vapour <b>hose</b> <b>clip,</b> possibly causing <b>a</b> fuel smell to become evident.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} Jubilee Clip {{was invented}} by Commander Lumley Robinson of the British Royal Navy, who was granted the first patent for the device by the London Patent Office in 1921 while operating as a sole trader. It is now subject to a registered trademark in many countries around the world. The design has been copied with many variations, {{and there are many}} other <b>hose</b> <b>clips</b> of <b>a</b> similar design.|$|R
5000|$|<b>A</b> <b>hose</b> {{coupling}} is <b>a</b> connector {{on the end}} of <b>a</b> <b>hose</b> {{to connect}} (or couple) it with another <b>hose</b> or with <b>a</b> tap or <b>a</b> <b>hose</b> appliance, such as an irrigation sprinkler. It is usually made of steel, brass, stainless steel, aluminium or plastic.|$|R
5000|$|<b>A</b> <b>hose</b> is <b>a</b> {{flexible}} hollow tube {{designed to}} carry fluids from one location to another. Hoses are also sometimes called pipes (the word pipe usually {{refers to a}} rigid tube, whereas <b>a</b> <b>hose</b> is usually <b>a</b> flexible one), or more generally tubing. The shape of <b>a</b> <b>hose</b> is usually cylindrical (having a circular cross section).|$|R
50|$|After use, <b>a</b> fire <b>hose</b> {{is usually}} hung to dry, because {{standing}} water that remains in <b>a</b> <b>hose</b> for <b>a</b> long time can deteriorate {{the material and}} render it unreliable or unusable. Therefore, the typical fire station often has a high structure to accommodate the length of <b>a</b> <b>hose</b> for such preventative maintenance.|$|R
50|$|A {{vacuum bell}} jar is placed on a base which is vented to <b>a</b> <b>hose</b> fitting, that can be {{connected}} via <b>a</b> <b>hose</b> to <b>a</b> vacuum pump. A vacuum is formed by pumping {{the air out of}} the bell jar.|$|R

(He, being under 21 when his mother changed her name, had been the only other member of the family to take the surname Lumley-Robinson). During and after the war other <b>hose</b> <b>clip</b> manufacturers started to emerge all over Europe, but Jubilee continued to be successful. The business was finally incorporated on 1 April 1948 as L. Robinson & Co (Gillingham) Ltd. Subsequently, the group grew with Jubilee Components Ltd and Jubilee Clips Ltd being formed to take on the manufacturing processes, alongside L. Robinson & Co (Plating) Ltd, an electro-plating company established in 1968.|$|R
