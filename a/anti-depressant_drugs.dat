50|$|As part of {{the idea}} that the central-auditory-system may be implicated into the {{tinnitus}} development, serotonin has also been implicated.

40|$|The {{treatment}} of {{central nervous system}} (CNS) diseases is challenged by the limited penetration of drug therapies in the brain. This lack of penetration is caused in part by P-glycoprotein (P-gp) at the blood-brain barrier that removes drugs from brain capillary endothelial cells before brain entry. Therefore, inhibiting the activity of P-gp at the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is attractive {{as a means to}} increase CNS drug penetration. We have examined two central nervous system disorder agents, olanzapine and venlafaxine, which do not penetrate the brain effectively because they are substrates of P-gp. We have synthesized a small library of bivalent agents based on the <b>anti-depressant</b> <b>drug</b> venlafaxine (effexor) and two homodimers of olanzapine. The homodimers show varying levels of inhibitory potency against P-gp in a multidrug resistant MCF 7 -DX 1 breast cancer cell line. ...|$|R
50|$|Mental {{illness is}} second to {{cardiovascular}} disease in reasons for losing an aviation license. One major {{issue is that}} most pilots on <b>anti-depressant</b> <b>drugs,</b> for example, withhold this information from their doctor or the governing body of aviation in their country due to fear of losing their license.Detection is further {{complicated by the fact}} that few medical examiners fully understand the complexity and effects of the different disorders. Additionally, psychiatrists are unfamiliar with the regulations of pilots suffering from mental health issues. Even though pilots need to have their medical license renewed every 6 months by a certified medical examiner, there is little focus on mental health and no psychologist or psychiatrist follows up unless requested to do so by the pilot, which is rarely the case.|$|E

50|$|Under experimentation, mice {{deficient}} in the p11 protein display depression-like behaviors. Knockout experiments {{in which the}} gene coding for protein p11 was deleted from the mouse genome caused them {{to show signs of}} depression. This is also observed in humans. On the other hand, those with sufficient amount of p11 protein behave normally. When mice that showed depressive symptoms were administered <b>anti-depressant</b> <b>drugs,</b> their levels of p11 were found to increase at the same rate, as antidepressants affected their behavioral changes. In addition, post-mortem comparisons of brain tissues showed much lower levels of p11 in depressed compared to control subjects. Levels of p11 {{have been found to be}} substantially lower in depressed humans and helpless mice, which suggests that altered p11 levels may be involved in the development of depression-like symptoms.|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} assesses the {{protective}} effect of Nyctanthes arbor-tristis (Nyctaginaceae) extracts and {{in combination with}} fluoxetine on stress-induced depression in mice.

These extracts showed significant improvement in the mobility percentage but among these, hydroethanol extract showed better protective effect from day 1 to 14 in both forced swimming and tail suspension test model. Hydroethanol (100 mg/kg) and chloroform (100 mg/kg) extracts with fluoxetine showed synergistic effect when compared with fluoxetine treated group (10 mg/kg) alone at day 7 and 14. Among monoamine levels only hydroethanol extract (400 mg/kg) restored the 5 -HT level near to level of fluoxetine-treated group.

40|$|Using {{insurance}} claims data from nine large self-insured employers offering 26 alternative health benefit plans, we examine empirically how {{the composition and}} utilization {{for the treatment of}} depression vary under alternative organizational forms of insurance (indemnity, preferred provider organization networks or PPOs, and mental health carve-outs), and variations in patient cost-sharing (copayments for psychotherapy and for prescription drugs). Although total outpatient mental health/substance abuse (MHSA) expenditures per treated individual do not vary significantly across insurance forms, the depressed outpatient is more likely to receive <b>anti-depressant</b> <b>drug</b> (ADD) medications in PPOs and carve-outs than under indemnity insurance. Those individuals facing higher copayments for psychotherapy are more likely to receive ADD medications. For those receiving ADD treatment, increases in prescription drug copay tend to increase the share of ADD medication costs accounted for by the newest (and more costly) generation of drugs, the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. ...|$|R

5000|$|The {{inception}} of many classes of drugs is in principle straightforward: any chemical that can enhance or diminish {{the action of}} a target protein could be investigated further for such use. The trick is to find such a chemical that is receptor-specific (cf. [...] "dirty drug") and safe to consume. The 2005 Physicians' Desk Reference lists {{twice the number of}} prescription drugs as the 1990 version. Many people by now are familiar with [...] "selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors", or SSRIs which exemplify modern pharmaceuticals. These SSRI <b>anti-depressant</b> <b>drugs,</b> such as Paxil and Prozac, selectively and therefore primarily inhibit the transport of serotonin which prolongs the activity in the synapse. There are numerous categories of selective drugs, and transport blockage is only one mode of action. The FDA has approved drugs which selectively act on each of the major neurotransmitters such as NE reuptake inhibitor antidepressants, DA blocker anti-psychotics, and GABA agonist tranquilizers (benzodiazepines).|$|E

However, do fish respond to pharmaceuticals as humans do? To address this question, we provide a novel quantitative cross-species extrapolation approach (qCSE) based on the hypothesis that similar plasma concentrations of pharmaceuticals cause comparable target-mediated effects in both humans and fish at similar level of biological organization (Read-Across Hypothesis). To validate this hypothesis, the behavioural effects of the <b>anti-depressant</b> <b>drug</b> fluoxetine on the fish model fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas) were used as test case.

Most of its thirteen songs concern or tell tragic stories of deception and death. For example, [...] "Medication," [...] the album's opener, is a first-person tale: the narrator, under the strain of having an adulterous affair with a police officer's wife as well as caring for his mentally unbalanced brother, prays for his brother's death.

[...] "Paxil," [...] as its title suggests (referring to an <b>anti-depressant</b> <b>drug),</b> mentions medicating [...] "a heart that doesn't work."

The present article describes effective, selective and reproducible methods of chiral analysis of citalopram in human plasma. The sample preparation of human plasma was carried out by Solid Phase Extraction (SPE) C 18 cartridges with elution via methanol having 0. 1 % acetic acid. The chiral analysis was achieved on AmyCoat column (150 x 46 mm) of the amylase type CSP, by using n-hexane- 2 -propanol-DEA (95 : 05 : 0. 2, v/v/v) as mobile phase. Flow rate of mobile phase was 0. 5 mL/min with detection at 240 nm. The values of k [R-(-) -], k [S-(+) -], α and Rs were 3. 56, 4. 00, 1. 12 and 1. 22, respectively. Linearity was in the concentration range of 100 - 500 μg/L with 10. 0 ng as the detection limit.

40|$|Estrogen {{replacement}} therapy (ERT) engenders much debate since several studies contradict its efficacy asa palliative therapy for cognitive decline and neurodegenerative diseases. Signaling transduction pathwaysalter brain cell activity, survival, and morphology by facilitating transcription factor activation and proteinproduction. The steroidal hormone estrogen and the <b>anti-depressant</b> <b>drug</b> lithium can interact also throughthese signaling transduction pathways resulting in transcription factor activation. The transcription factorcAMP response element binding protein (CREB) {{is affected by}} both estrogen and lithium, and CREBregulates genes involved in learning, memory and neuronal survival. CREB is activated upon phosphorylationat serine 133 by protein kinases and, estrogen and its receptors (ER) facilitate this phosphorylation. Glycogensynthase kinase- 3 beta (GSK- 3 β) attenuates CREB’s transcriptional properties via subsequent phosphorylationof its serine 129, and lithium {{is known as a}} negative regulator of GSK- 3 β, thus facilitating CREB responseelement binding. Interestingly, ERα function and DNA-binding properties are facilitated by GSK- 3 β.
