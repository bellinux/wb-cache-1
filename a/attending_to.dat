40|$|Social phobics exhibit an attentional bias for {{threat in}} probe {{detection}} and probe discrimination paradigms. Attention training programs, in which probes always replace nonthreatening cues, reduce attentional bias for threat and self-reported social anxiety. However, researchers have seldom included behavioral measures of anxiety reduction, {{and have never}} taken physiological measures of anxiety reduction. In the present study, we trained individuals with generalized social phobia (n = 57) <b>to</b> <b>attend</b> <b>to</b> threat cues (<b>attend</b> <b>to</b> threat), <b>to</b> <b>attend</b> <b>to</b> positive cues (<b>attend</b> <b>to</b> positive), or <b>to</b> alternately <b>attend</b> <b>to</b> both (control condition). We assessed not only self-reported social anxiety, but also behavioral and physiological measures of social anxiety.

The next year saw the Democrats win election to city government, replacing the more prohibition-friendly Whigs, and many liquor-sellers resumed their trade as prosecutions were deferred indefinitely.

40|$|There are few {{empirical}} studies that explore how managers at senior executive levels of international nongovernmental development organizations (INGDOs) conciliate multiple identities with purposeful strategic change. This article offers rich excerpts from high-level strategy meetings in two Member Organizations {{of a major}} INGDO and explores deeply embedded tensions in its organizational identity. In the case study, there were several identities in play simultaneously—“we <b>attend</b> <b>to</b> donors, ” “we <b>attend</b> <b>to</b> beneficiaries, ” “we <b>attend</b> <b>to</b> the confederation, ” and finally “we <b>attend</b> <b>to</b> ourselves. ” Strategic planning meetings were therefore fraught with tension over the balance between generalist versus specialist activities, organizational survival, autonomy, and image. Managers reconciled these tensions by creating a meta-identity of a “strategic organization”: “We may <b>attend</b> <b>to</b> different things but we <b>attend</b> <b>to</b> {{all of these things}} in a purposeful and directed way. ” As aid organizations become ever larger and more complex, there i...|$|R

5|$|An infant's social {{environment}} relates {{to his or}} her later language development. Children's first words are closely linked to their early language experience. For children with typically developing language skills, there is a close match between maternal speech and their environment: up to 78% of maternal speech is matched to the object the child is focusing on. In children with delayed language development, only 50% of maternal speech is matched to the object the infant is focusing on. Infants are {{more likely to engage in}} joint attention when the parent talks about an object that the child is <b>attending</b> <b>to</b> as opposed to an object outside of the infant's attention. This increased level of joint attention aids in encouraging normal language development, including word comprehension and production.

Principalities are the seventh-highest ranking choir and belong to the lowest grouping of angels, those most likely to appear to mankind. Principalities oversee those humans who rule over others, teaching kings and heads of families the skills needed to lead.|$|E
5|$|Casualty Clearing Stations were {{deliberately}} sited {{as close}} to the front line as possible, since many injuries caused during battle required more urgent attention than the time to travel to a field hospital allowed. Often within seven miles of the front line, they were considered extremely dangerous, and the appropriateness of having nurses attend such stations was hotly debated within the military. As a result of its proximity to the front, the station would often come under enemy attack, as was the case of the 38th British Casualty Station on 23 August. The Casualty Station suffered a heavy air raid by German forces, with the sterilisation room being destroyed and the camp being hit by numerous bombs.
