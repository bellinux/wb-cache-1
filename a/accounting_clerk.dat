He had come to loath Christianity and the Victorian moral systems that he associated with it; instead he began reading about Eastern religion, yoga, and Western esotericism. While at work, he met Charles Stansfeld Jones, a Thelemite who shared Smith's interest in these subjects and who lent him copies of Aleister Crowley's Book 4 and volume one, number one of The Equinox. Intrigued, Smith paid to join Crowley's Britain-based magical order, the A∴A∴, in doing so obtaining more of Crowley's writings. He began performing many of the practices encouraged by the group, including yoga and the keeping of a diary recording his magical endeavours.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{looks at}} how some {{selected}} classical Pentecostal churches 50 in the Ashanti Region of Ghana could be proactive in managing their funds generated from their offerings above reproach 51. This {{has been done}} using both primary and secondary sources. With respect to the primary sources, the purposive sampling and the lottery system were used. Whiles the first method was used to sample the church leaders for interview, the other was used to sample a total of one hundred and seventy-one respondents from the congregations of churches 1, 2 and 3. Besides the researcher made several visits to these churches to observe most of their activities. It came to light that these churches have a lay down routine procedures that {{have been put in}} place to help their <b>accounts</b> <b>clerks</b> to prudently manage their funds. In spite of these routine procedures, the <b>accounts</b> <b>clerks</b> are not leaving above reproach and this is due to some challenges confronting these selected churches with respect to the management of their offerings. However, this issue can be minimized or perhaps over-come when the churches appoint qualified <b>accounts</b> <b>clerks</b> as full-time employees. The churches also need to go further by providing adequate office spaces equipped with the necessary machinery that would enable their <b>accounts</b> <b>clerks</b> to operate efficiently and effectively. 1...|$|R
