5|$|On March 9, Cross <b>abruptly</b> <b>{{resigned}}</b> as Attorney-General; Woods resigned {{the next}} day. Cross gave as his reason that Rutherford {{had told him}} that Cushing was re-entering cabinet, and Cross felt that that made his position untenable. Cushing gave a different account: {{he said that he had}} been asked by Rutherford to re-enter cabinet, and that the Premier {{had told him that}} if he did, Cross would resign. However, he denied ever having agreed to do so, and accused Cross of fabricating his story completely. Rutherford stayed silent until March 11, when he announced that he had refused Cross's resignation, and that he was still Attorney-General. Soon after, Boyle made his own set of accusations, saying that agents of the liquor license department, which was under Cross, had been demanding bribes from hoteliers in exchange for licenses and that Cross was aware of this. Cross denied the charge.|$|E

His 71–7 loss at Texas in 1941 {{on the day before}} the attack on Pearl Harbor stands as the most points allowed by any Oregon team, and the second largest margin of defeat. Oliver, in 1945, is the only coach to see his team lose twice to Oregon State in the same season.

25|$|On Memorial Day, 2003, Brown <b>abruptly</b> <b>resigned</b> as head coach, {{taking over}} the reins in Detroit a few days later. Brown's Pistons would win the 2004 NBA Championship over the Los Angeles Lakers, in some ways avenging his loss to them in 2001. After being turned down by Jeff Van Gundy and Eddie Jordan, the 76ers hired Randy Ayers, an {{assistant}} under Brown, as their new head coach. Ayers lasted only 52 games and was fired with the team's record at 21–31. Chris Ford took over, but the 76ers finished the 2003–04 season at 33–49, missing {{the playoffs for the}} first time in six years.

25|$|Upon {{his return}} from abroad in 1988, Brown {{announced}} that he would stand as a candidate to become chairman of the California Democratic Party, and won against investment banker Steve Westly. Although Brown greatly expanded the party's donor base and enlarged its coffers, with a focus on grassroots organizing and get out the vote drives, he was criticized for not spending enough money on TV ads, which was felt to have contributed to Democratic losses in several close races in 1990. In early 1991, Brown <b>abruptly</b> <b>resigned</b> his post and {{announced that he would}} run for the Senate seat held by the retiring Alan Cranston. Although Brown consistently led in the polls for both the nomination and the general election, he abandoned the campaign, deciding instead to run for the presidency for the third time.|$|E

On 6 October 1999, Admiral Bokhari <b>abruptly</b> <b>resigned</b> from the navy when the televised media news reached to him that prime minister Nawaz Sharif appointed the chief of army staff General Pervez Musharraf as chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee. Bokhari reached to Prime minister Secretariat and lodged a loud protest against Musharraf and Nawaz Sharif as Bokhari considered Musharraf as much junior officer to him.

25|$|In 1960, the orchestra, led {{again by}} Chandler, signed Georg Solti to a three-year {{contract}} to be music director after he had guest conducted the orchestra in winter concerts downtown, at the Hollywood Bowl, and in other Southern California locations including CAMA concerts in Santa Barbara. Solti was to officially begin his tenure in 1962, and the Philharmonic had hoped that he would lead the orchestra when it moved into its new home at the then yet-to-be-completed Dorothy Chandler Pavilion; he even began to appoint musicians to the orchestra. However, Solti <b>abruptly</b> <b>resigned</b> the position in 1961 without officially taking the post after learning that the Philharmonic board of directors failed to consult him before naming then 26-year-old Zubin Mehta to be assistant conductor of the orchestra. Mehta was subsequently named to replace Solti.|$|E
25|$|In November 2013, Wesley L. Knapp, M.ED ($113,850 in 2009) <b>abruptly</b> <b>resigned</b> his {{position}} {{in exchange for the}} Midd-West School Board dropping pending charges. The Board offered no explanation regarding the departure, however Knapp received a substantial cash payout ($60,682 plus another $10,000 to be paid over six months). The Board appointed Daphne Snook as acting Superintendent pending the hiring of a new superintendent. In April 2014, the Board suspended Daphne Snook pending the results of a criminal investigation into her reading School Board confidential emails. The Midd-West School Board approved $200 per day as salary for Donna Samuelson as Interim Superintendent starting April 15, 2014. In early May 2014, the Snyder County District Attorney, Michael Piecuch, reported his investigation found insufficient evidence to file criminal charges against Snook.

25|$|After Johnson {{announced}} {{the cancellation of}} the 65,000-ton , under construction and the Navy's hope to participate in strategic nuclear air operations, without consulting the Department of the Navy nor Congress, Secretary of the Navy John L. Sullivan <b>abruptly</b> <b>resigned,</b> beginning the Revolt of the Admirals. In June 1949, the House Committee on Armed Services launched an investigation into charges of malfeasance in office against Secretary Johnson. While ultimately cleared of any wrongdoing, the congressional rebuke weakened Johnson's power with the military and President Truman, and few subsequent cuts were made. After his severe cutbacks resulted in a military too weak to perform effectively in the initial days of the Korean War, Johnson resigned on 19 September 1950, replaced with George Marshall. Ironically, the Marines, {{as part of an}} amphibious corps with the US Army 7th division who deployed, and made an amphibious operation at Inchon {{at the opening of the}} war.|$|E
25|$|In July 2005, the 33-year-old Murdoch <b>abruptly</b> <b>resigned</b> as an {{executive}} at the News Corp. The unexplained departure apparently dashed News Corp. Chief executive Rupert Murdoch's hopes that his son would one day take over as CEO of the global media empire, which includes the Twentieth Century Fox movie studio, the Fox television network, several satellite broadcasters, and newspapers in Britain, Australia, and the United States. Roger Ailes, the chairman of Fox News Channel, was named chairman of News Corp's group of television stations to succeed Murdoch junior. Media speculated that his brother, James Murdoch, {{the chief executive of}} UK satellite TV company BSkyB may succeed Rupert Murdoch. During his time as {{an executive}} at News Corp, Murdoch was the Deputy Chief Operating Officer of News Corporation (now 21st Century Fox). He had oversight of HarperCollins and the company's lines of business in Australia, including REA. He also served on the Board of Foxtel and as Chairman of Fox Television stations and was the publisher of the New York Post. He was appointed to the News Corp board in 1996.|$|E
25|$|In June 2013, Metra CEO Alex Clifford <b>abruptly</b> <b>resigned</b> his {{position}} with no public comment. It gradually {{was reported that}} his exit had been demanded by the Metra board, which negotiated a $871,000 severance package including a non-disclosure agreement. Clifford's ouster was allegedly arranged because he rejected requests for patronage hiring and promotion, including a request to promote a longtime supporter of State Representative Michael Madigan. In the wake of this scandal, five board members resigned. In August 2013, the remaining board members unanimously elected Don Orseno as interim CEO. (The six-member board was operating with reduced membership and thus lacked the authority to elect a permanent CEO. Orseno and Alex Wiggins shared duties as co-executive directors.) Orseno's long railroad career, beginning with work to set up trains and check doors for the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad played favorably in the board's decision. By October 2013, local officials had restored Metra's board to 11 members. After reviewing four candidates, the re-constituted board formally appointed Orseno CEO of Metra in January 2014.|$|E

50|$|In {{the lead}} up to 1978, the Opposition Liberal Party seemed destined to return to power. A number of scandals had been tied to the Conservatives and Liberal leader Robert Higgins was widely popular. In early 1978, Higgins {{believed}} he had tied some of the scandals directly to Hatfield himself. In a bold move, Higgins promised to resign should Hatfield prove {{that he was not}} tied directly to the scandal, which Hatfield promptly did. Higgins was forced to <b>abruptly</b> <b>resign</b> and was replaced by Joseph Daigle as leader. The Liberals mused that Hatfield had purposely ensured false information was leaked to the Liberals to lead them into making false accusations.|$|R
50|$|John Godfrey left {{politics}} to become Headmaster of the Toronto French School, a prestigious independent {{school in the}} Lawrence Park area with two campuses in Toronto. He held the position from 2008 until <b>abruptly</b> <b>resigning</b> in June 2014, one year into his second five-year contract. In November 2014, the school settled a $1.6 million lawsuit by two Muslim former students who sued for defamation and racial profiling due to the school's handling of a 2008 incident in which the pair were involved in an altercation after they had been subjected to racial slurs. The school apologised for {{its role in the}} affair and for defamatory comments about the individuals made by Godfrey to a student assembly.|$|R
25|$|There {{have been}} 13 head coaches for the Pacers {{franchise}}. Larry Staverman {{was the first}} coach of the team in 1967, when the team was in the ABA. Coach Bobby Leonard has the most wins in franchise history, with 529 in his 12 seasons with the team. After Leonard, Jack McKinney, George Irvine, and Dr. Jack Ramsay. When Ramsay <b>abruptly</b> <b>resigned</b> in 1988 after the team {{got off to a}} horrid start, Pacers legend George McGinnis took over on an interim basis for two games, before Irvine returned for 20 more. Dick Versace then led the Pacers through another sub-par stretch before Bob Hill got the Pacers back to the playoffs and into contention. Then in 1993, Larry Brown joined the Pacers franchise and led the team to many playoff appearances as Reggie Miller blossomed into a superstar and eventual Hall of Famer. Larry Bird took over the team in 1997 and coached until 2000. Bird took the Pacers to their only NBA Finals appearance in the 1999–2000 season. Isiah Thomas, Rick Carlisle, and Jim O'Brien were next up as the Pacers top coach. The most recent head coach of the Pacers was Frank Vogel, until May 5, 2016 when his contract was not renewed after the number 7 seeded Pacers lost game 7 of {{the first round of the}} 2016 NBA Playoffs to the number two seeded Toronto Raptors. Subsequently, associate head coach Nate McMillan was promoted to the top spot.|$|E

However, a 1-3 start, marked by a loss to the Raiders in {{what became known as}} the Holy Roller game of September 10 that ultimately cost the Chargers a playoff spot, caused Prothro to <b>abruptly</b> <b>resign</b> as head coach in favor of Don Coryell. The Chargers finished 1978 with a 9-7 record, their first winning season since 1969, and the team he helped build then won three straight AFC Western Division titles and made the playoffs every year from 1979 to 1982.|$|R
