25|$|A {{change has}} also come over Voigt's voice lately, though it's {{hard to tell}} if it's from weight loss or normal aging—controversy still rages over whether Maria Callas's drastic diets contributed to her rapid vocal decline. Not that Voigt as yet {{exhibits}} any of Callas's technical problems: Her voice continues to be reliably supported and under control. What is noticeable, however—earlier this season in Verdi's La Forza del Destino and now in Tosca—is a marked thinning of quality <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> the instrument, together with a slight acidity and tightening of the tone that has definitely taken the youthful bloom off, especially at the top.|$|E

25|$|Several {{explanations}} {{have been}} put forth to explain the existence of blue stragglers. The simplest is that blue stragglers formed later {{than the rest of}} the stars in the cluster, but evidence for this is limited. Another simple proposal is that blue stragglers are either field stars which are not actually members of the clusters to which they seem to belong, or are field stars which were captured by the cluster. This too seems unlikely, as blue stragglers often reside <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> the clusters to which they belong. Another theory is that blue stragglers are the result of stars that come too close to another star or similar mass object and collide.|$|E
25|$|Carpenter {{finally gave}} up and in 1961 sold the stadium for $600,000 {{to a group of}} New York real estate investors, losing over a million dollars after his 7-year ownership; he secured a 3-year lease and an option to stay through 1967 while he pursued his Torresdale stadium plan. The New York buyers quickly flipped the {{property}} to another New York consortium who, assuming the Phillies would be gone by 1967, began planning the demolition of the stadium and construction of a bowling alley and discount store on the site. Then in May 1964, Jerry Wolman, who had just bought the Philadelphia Eagles in February, brought the stadium ownership back to town, paying $757,000 for it {{as part of a larger}} real estate deal. Wolman's motivations for the purchase are in dispute – all the mortgage shuffling did not slow the decay out at the park – but he claimed he wanted to help the Phillies; the move also put him <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> the emerging fight over a new stadium in Philadelphia, which would likely affect his Eagles.|$|E
25|$|Because of the relics they contained, wooden pagodas {{used to be}} the {{centerpiece}} of the garan, the seven edifices considered indispensable for a temple. They gradually lost importance and were replaced by the kondō (golden hall), because of the magic powers believed to lie within the images the building housed. This loss of status was so complete that Zen schools, which arrived late in Japan from China, normally do not have any pagoda in their garan. The layout of four early temples clearly illustrates this trend: they are in chronological order Asuka-dera, Shitennō-ji, Hōryū-ji, and Yakushi-ji. In the first, the pagoda was <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> the garan surrounded by three small kondō (see the reconstruction of the temple's original layout). In the second, a single kondō {{is at the center of}} the temple and the pagoda lies in front of it. At Hōryū-ji, they are one next to the other. Yakushi-ji has a single, large kondō at the center with two pagodas on the sides. The same evolution can be observed in Buddhist temples in China.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we report}} on the growth and {{characterization}} of quantum dot-quantum well nanostructures with photoluminescence (PL) that is tunable over the visible range. The material exhibits a PL efficiency as high as ∼ 60 % and is prepared by reacting ZnS nanocrystals in turn with precursors for CdSe and ZnS in an attempt to form a simple "ZnS/CdSe/ZnS quantum-well structure". Through the use of synchrotron radiation-based photoelectron spectroscopy in conjunction with detailed overall compositional analysis and correlation with the size of the final composite nanostructure, the internal structure of the composite nanocrystals is shown to consist of a graded alloy core whose composition gradually changes from ZnS <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>center</b> to CdSe <b>at</b> <b>the</b> onset of a CdSe layer. The outer shell is ZnS with a sharp interface, probably reflecting the relative thermodynamic stabilities of the parent binary phases.

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} that our Galactic Center, despite little {{evidence for the}} presence of a currently active nucleus, provides insight into the feeding of AGN: The observed velocity field of molecular clouds can be interpreted as tracing out the spiralling inwards of gas in a large accretion flow towards the Galactic Center (Linden et al. 1993, Biermann et al. 1993) in the radial distance range from a few parsec to a few hundred pc. The required effective viscosity corresponds well to the observed turbulent velocities and characteristic length scales. The implied mass influx provides indeed all the material needed to maintain the presently observed star formation rate at distances closer than about $ 100 $ pc. We argue that the energy input from supernova explosions due to the high rate of star formation can feed the turbulence of the interstellar medium. This then keeps the effective viscosity high as required to feed the star formation. We suggest that this process leads to limit cycles in star formation, and as a consequence also to limit cycles in the feeding of any activity <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>center.</b> Comment: 1 + 15 pages, no figures, plain Te...|$|R
