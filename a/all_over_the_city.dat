5|$|As {{part of the}} {{unification}} of the three subway companies that comprised the New York City Subway in 1940, elevated lines were being shut down <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> and replaced by subways. The northern half of the Second Avenue Elevated, serving the Upper East Side and East Harlem, closed on June 11, 1940; the southern half, running through Lower Manhattan, East Midtown and across the Queensborough Bridge to Queens, closed on June 13, 1942. The demolition of the Second Avenue elevated caused overcrowding on the Astoria and Flushing Lines in Queens, which no longer had direct service to Manhattan's far East Side. Because of the elevated line's closure, {{as well as a}} corresponding increase in the East Side's population, the need for a Second Avenue subway increased.|$|E

5|$|The {{personal}} experiences of many Londoners during the fire are glimpsed in letters and memoirs.

For example, they both travelled out to the Moorfields park area north of the City on the Wednesday—the fourth day—to view the mighty encampment of distressed refugees there, which shocked them. Their diaries are the most important sources for all modern retellings of the disaster. Books on the fire by Tinniswood (2003) and Hanson (2001) also rely on the brief memoirs of William Taswell (1651–82), who was a fourteen year-old schoolboy at Westminster School in 1666.|$|E
