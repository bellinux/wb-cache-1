5|$|The Tennessee Coal, Iron <b>and</b> <b>Railroad</b> Company (1852–1952), {{also known}} as TCI and the Tennessee Company, was a major American steel {{manufacturer}} with interests in coal and iron ore mining <b>and</b> <b>railroad</b> operations. Originally based entirely within Tennessee, it relocated most of its business to Alabama {{in the late nineteenth}} century. With a sizable real estate portfolio, the company owned several Birmingham satellite towns, including Ensley, Fairfield, Docena, Edgewater and Bayview.|$|E
5|$|However, {{to finance}} these improvements, {{the company also}} {{incurred}} massive debt, and with the market price for iron remaining low, the company was sold in 1880 to another group of Portland financiers led by Simeon Gannett Reed <b>and</b> <b>railroad</b> baron Henry Villard.|$|E
5|$|In 1903, Horatio Nelson Jackson {{became the}} first {{documented}} person to drive an automobile from San Francisco to New York using only a connection of dirt roads, cow paths, <b>and</b> <b>railroad</b> beds. His journey, covered by the press, became a national sensation {{and called for a}} system of long distance roads.|$|E
50|$|The McMinnville <b>and</b> Manchester <b>Railroad</b> Company never {{complied}} with the terms of sale. On June 28, 1875, another decree was entered by the court confirming {{the sale of the}} McMinnville <b>and</b> Manchester <b>Railroad</b> <b>and</b> the Winchester <b>and</b> Alabama <b>Railroad</b> to the Memphis <b>and</b> Charleston <b>Railroad</b> Company.

Between Rutland and Fort Ann traffic would use the R&S's Troy, Salem <b>and</b> Rutland <b>Railroad,</b> Rutland <b>and</b> Whitehall <b>Railroad</b> <b>and</b> Saratoga <b>and</b> Whitehall <b>Railroad.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Bloomsburg <b>and</b> Sullivan <b>Railroad</b> had {{stations}} at Bloomsburg, Lightstreet, Orangeville, Forks, Stillwater, and Jamison City, Pennsylvania. The Bloomsburg <b>and</b> Sullivan <b>Railroad</b> intersected the Pennsylvania <b>Railroad</b> <b>and</b> the Reading <b>Railroad</b> at {{its southern}} terminus.

5|$|The sparsely {{populated}} Bay Area transformed during the 20th century. Following the hurricane, donations by {{the newly established}} Red Cross helped revive area farming communities. The newly established community of Texas City opened its port <b>and</b> <b>railroad</b> junctions shipping cotton and grain. Commercial fishing, particularly for oysters and shrimp, grew as a significant area industry.|$|E
5|$|The war-time economy {{provided}} a boom to Indiana's industry and agriculture, {{which led to}} more urbanization throughout the 1920s. By 1925, more workers were employed in industry than in agriculture in Indiana. Indiana's greatest industries were steel production, iron, automobiles, <b>and</b> <b>railroad</b> cars.|$|E
5|$|William Benjamin Cornwell (November 25, 1864 – April 8, 1926) was an American lawyer, businessperson, {{newspaper}} editor and publisher, <b>and</b> <b>railroad</b> and timber {{executive in the}} U.S. state of West Virginia.

5|$|After the war, {{the three}} {{surviving}} ships were decommissioned and later sold on 12 September 1874. Chickasaws new owners converted her to sidewheel propulsion {{and she became}} a coal <b>and</b> <b>railroad</b> ferry until 1944 when she was scuttled. Her wreck was discovered in 2004. Milwaukees wreck was salvaged {{after the war and}} some of her iron was used in building the Eads Bridge over the Mississippi at St. Louis.|$|E
5|$|At {{one time}} the second largest steel {{producer}} in the USA, TCI was listed on the first Dow Jones Industrial Average in 1896. However, in 1907, the company was merged with its principal rival, the United States Steel Corporation. The Tennessee Coal, Iron <b>and</b> <b>Railroad</b> Company was subsequently operated as a subsidiary of U. S. Steel for 45 years until it became a division of its parent company in 1952.|$|E
5|$|At sunrise on 25 July 1953 New Jersey {{was off the}} key port, {{rail and}} {{communications}} center of Hungnam, pounding coastal guns, bridges, a factory area, and oil storage tanks. She sailed north that afternoon, firing at rail lines <b>and</b> <b>railroad</b> tunnels as she made for Tanchon, where she launched a whaleboat {{in an attempt to}} spot a train known to run nightly along the coast. Her big guns were trained on two tunnels between which she hoped to catch the train, but in the darkness she could not see the results of her six-gun salvo.|$|E

His family later moved to Nokomis, Illinois, where Bottomley {{enrolled}} in grade school and Nokomis High School. He dropped out when he was 16 years old {{in order to help}} support his family financially. Bottomley worked as a coal miner, truck driver, grocery clerk, <b>and</b> <b>railroad</b> clerk.

Hinde served in executive leadership positions in the river navigation, shipping, railroad, and hotel businesses. By his late forties, Hinde had already amassed a great fortune from his work in the steamboat <b>and</b> <b>railroad</b> industries.|$|E
5|$|Debates ensued {{over the}} fate of the Marysvale branch line. The mines {{at the end of the}} line had long closed; the last train to {{traverse}} the entire length of the line passed through in 1970. Still, farmers and industry in the Sevier and Sanpete Valleys generated enough traffic that the line broke even most years. However, this line was severely damaged, with several washed-out bridges <b>and</b> <b>railroad</b> tracks draping over the sides of newly created cliffs. The railroad determined that at best it would take years to recover the cost of rebuilding the line.|$|E

5|$|Erie was an {{important}} shipbuilding, fishing, <b>and</b> <b>railroad</b> hub during the mid-19th century. The city was the site where three sets of track gauges met. While the delays engendered cargo troubles for commerce and travel, they provided much-needed local jobs in Erie. When a national standardized gauge was proposed, those jobs, {{and the importance of}} the rail hub itself, were put in jeopardy. In an event known as the Erie Gauge War, the citizens of Erie, led by the mayor, set fire to bridges, ripped up track and rioted to try to stop the standardization.|$|E
5|$|Goldschmidt {{became the}} sixth U.S. Secretary of Transportation in 1979.

50|$|The current {{station was}} built in 1911 by the New York Central Railroad along the Boston <b>and</b> Albany <b>Railroad</b> Main Line, during the heyday of railroading in the United States, {{replacing}} the previous 1875 station. As a union station, it also served the Providence <b>and</b> Worcester <b>Railroad</b> (which was acquired by the New York, New Haven <b>and</b> Hartford <b>Railroad),</b> the Norwich <b>and</b> Worcester <b>Railroad</b> (acquired by the New York <b>and</b> New England <b>Railroad),</b> the Worcester, Nashua <b>and</b> Rochester <b>Railroad</b> <b>and</b> the Boston, Barre <b>and</b> Gardner <b>Railroad</b> (which both {{became part of the}} Boston <b>and</b> Maine <b>Railroad).</b> Passenger service to Union Station ended by 1974, and the abandoned station fell into disrepair.|$|R

He married his first wife Blanche Beckwith on 12 September 1913, {{with whom he had}} his first son, Forrester Mashbir; the couple separated during the mid/late-1920s.|$|E
5|$|Natural ice {{typically}} had to {{be moved}} several times between being harvested and used by the end customer. A wide range of methods were used, including wagons, railroads, ships and barges. Ships were particularly important to the ice trade, particularly in the early phase of the trade, when {{the focus of the}} trade was on international exports from the U.S. <b>and</b> <b>railroad</b> networks across the country were non-existent.|$|E
5|$|The {{north-east}} {{coast of}} the United States depended on these supplies of oil, importing both crude and refined products. Across most of Texas, there had been little interest in building pipelines to transport oil, and petroleum was typically moved from the south-west to the north-east coast using a mixture of sea freight <b>and</b> <b>railroad</b> transport. In early 1941, 70,000 barrels of oil were moved on the railroads each day, but this method was expensive, and {{the bulk of the}} oil was moved using barges, some with a capacity of up to 15,000 barrels, operating up and down rivers and the Atlantic Coast.|$|E
50|$|On January 1, 1873, the Boston, Clinton, <b>and</b> Fitchburg <b>Railroad</b> {{signed a}} fifty-year lease of the Mansfield <b>and</b> Framingham <b>Railroad,</b> {{providing}} {{a connection to}} the Boston <b>and</b> Providence <b>Railroad</b> <b>and</b> the Taunton Branch Railroad in Mansfield. On July 1, 1873 the Taunton Branch Railroad merged with the New Bedford <b>and</b> Taunton <b>Railroad</b> <b>and</b> the Middleborough <b>and</b> Taunton <b>Railroad</b> to form the New Bedford Railroad. Less than a year later, on February 2, 1874, the Boston, Clinton, <b>and</b> Fitchburg <b>Railroad</b> entered into a fifty-year lease agreement with the New Bedford Railroad, which provided access to the deep water whaling port at New Bedford. On June 1, 1875, the Boston, Clinton, <b>and</b> Fitchburg <b>Railroad</b> consolidated with the Mansfield <b>and</b> Framingham <b>Railroad,</b> <b>and</b> exactly one year later, on June 1, 1876, the Boston, Clinton, <b>and</b> Fitchburg <b>Railroad</b> merged with the New Bedford Railroad to form the Boston, Clinton, Fitchburg <b>and</b> New Bedford <b>Railroad.</b> In 1879, the Boston, Clinton, Fitchburg <b>and</b> New Bedford <b>Railroad</b> was leased to the Old Colony Railroad for 999 years, but on October 1 of that same year nonetheless extended its lease of the Framingham <b>and</b> Lowell <b>Railroad</b> to 998 years. On September 10, 1881, the Framingham <b>and</b> Lowell <b>Railroad</b> was deeded on execution sale to the Boston, Clinton, Fitchburg, <b>and</b> New Bedford <b>Railroad,</b> forming the railroad's largest network with 126.2 miles of track system-wide.|$|R
