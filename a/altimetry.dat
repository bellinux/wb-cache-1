5|$|The first volcanoes {{along the}} Juan de Fuca ridge, {{including}} Axial Seamount, were {{detected in the}} 1970s by satellite <b>altimetry.</b> Axial Seamount's proximity to the western coast and shallow depth make {{it one of the}} most easily accessible seamounts in the world, and its unique geological setting and active state also makes {{it one of the most}} interesting, rivaling Davidson Seamount to the south in scientific interest.|$|E
5|$|Because {{of their}} large numbers, many seamounts {{remain to be}} {{properly}} studied, and even mapped. Bathymetry and satellite <b>altimetry</b> are two technologies working to close the gap. There have been instances where naval vessels have collided with uncharted seamounts; for example, Muirfield Seamount is named after the ship that struck it in 1973. However, the greatest danger from seamounts are flank collapses; as they get older, extrusions seeping in the seamounts put pressure on their sides, causing landslides that {{have the potential to}} generate massive tsunamis.|$|E
5|$|There {{are also}} streaky features, {{some of them}} {{hundreds}} of kilometers in length, {{that appear to be}} caused by windblown particles. Examination has also shown the surface to be relatively smooth; the few objects that seem to be impact craters appeared to have been filled in, perhaps by raining hydrocarbons or volcanoes. Radar <b>altimetry</b> suggests height variation is low, typically no more than 150meters. Occasional elevation changes of 500meters have been discovered and Titan has mountains that sometimes reach several hundred meters to more than 1 kilometer in height.|$|E
5|$|Methods for {{measuring}} retreat include staking terminus location, global positioning mapping, aerial mapping and laser <b>altimetry.</b> The key symptom of disequilibrium is thinning {{along the entire}} length of the glacier. This indicates a diminishment of the accumulation zone. The result is marginal recession of the accumulation zone margin, not just of the terminus. In effect, the glacier no longer has a consistent accumulation zone and without an accumulation zone cannot survive. For example, Easton Glacier in Washington state, U.S. will likely shrink to half its size but at a slowing rate of reduction and stabilize at that size despite the warmer temperature over a few decades. However, the Grinnell Glacier in Montana, U.S. will shrink at an increasing rate until it disappears. The difference is that the upper section of Easton Glacier remains healthy and snow-covered, while even the upper section of the Grinnell Glacier is bare, is melting and has thinned. Small glaciers with minimal altitude range are most likely to fall into disequilibrium with the climate.|$|E
25|$|Comparison of {{the wave}} model {{forecasts}} with observations is essential for characterizing model deficiencies and identifying areas for improvement. In-situ observations are obtained from buoys, ships and oil platforms. <b>Altimetry</b> data from satellites, such as GEOSAT and TOPEX, {{can also be used}} to infer the characteristics of wind waves.|$|E
25|$|The modern uses of radar {{are highly}} diverse, {{including}} air and terrestrial traffic control, radar astronomy, air-defence systems, antimissile systems, marine radars to locate landmarks and other ships, aircraft anticollision systems, ocean surveillance systems, outer space surveillance and rendezvous systems, meteorological precipitation monitoring, <b>altimetry</b> and flight control systems, guided missile target locating systems, ground-penetrating radar for geological observations, and range-controlled radar {{for public health}} surveillance. High tech radar systems are associated with digital signal processing, machine learning and are capable of extracting useful information from very high noise levels.|$|E
25|$|Since the 1992 {{launch of}} TOPEX/Poseidon, {{altimetric}} satellites have been recording {{the change in}} sea level. Current rates of sea level rise from satellite <b>altimetry</b> have been estimated {{in the range of}} 2.9–3.4 ± 0.4–0.6mm per year for 1993–2010. This exceeds those from tide gauges. It is unclear whether this represents an accelerated increase over the last decades, variability due to the sparse sampling of the tide gauges, true differences between satellites and tide gauges, or problems with satellite calibration. In 2015, a small calibration errors of the first altimetric satellite – Topex/Poseidon - was identified. It had caused a slight overestimation of the 1992-2005 sea levels, which masked the ongoing sea level rise acceleration.|$|E
500|$|The U.S. co-launched the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) and the LCROSS {{impactor}} {{and follow-up}} observation orbiter on 18 June 2009; LCROSS completed its mission {{by making a}} planned and widely observed impact in the crater Cabeus on 9 October 2009, whereas LRO is currently in operation, obtaining precise lunar <b>altimetry</b> and high-resolution imagery. In November 2011, the LRO passed over the large and bright Aristarchus crater. [...] NASA released photos of the crater on 25 December 2011.|$|E
500|$|The lake {{is named}} after Vostok Station, which in turn {{is named after}} the Vostok (Восток), a sloop-of-war ship, which means [...] "East" [...] in Russian. The {{existence}} of a subglacial lake in the Vostok region was first suggested by Russian geographer Andrey Kapitsa based on seismic soundings made during the Soviet Antarctic Expeditions in 1959 and 1964 to measure the thickness of the ice sheet. The continued research by Russian and British scientists led by 1993 to the final confirmation of the existence of the lake by J. P. Ridley using ERS-1 laser <b>altimetry.</b>|$|E
500|$|Before seamounts {{and their}} oceanographic impact can be fully understood, {{they must be}} mapped, a {{daunting}} task due to their sheer number. The most detailed seamount mappings are provided by multibeam echosounding (sonar), however after more than 5000 publicly held cruises, {{the amount of the}} sea floor that has been mapped remains minuscule. Satellite <b>altimetry</b> is a broader alternative, albeit not as detailed, with 13,000 catalogued seamounts; however this is still {{only a fraction of the}} total 100,000. The reason for this is that uncertainties in the technology limit recognition to features [...] or larger. In the future, technological advances could allow for a larger and more detailed catalogue.|$|E
500|$|Axial Seamount {{was first}} {{detected}} in the 1970s by satellite <b>altimetry,</b> and mapped and explored by Pisces IV, DSV Alvin, and others through the 1980s. A large package of sensors was dropped on the seamount through 1992, and the New Millennium Observatory was established on its flanks in 1996. Axial Seamount received significant scientific attention following the seismic detection of a submarine eruption at the volcano in January 1998, {{the first time a}} submarine eruption had been detected and followed in situ. Subsequent cruises and analysis showed that the volcano had generated lava flows up to [...] thick, and the total eruptive volume was found to be [...] Axial Seamount erupted again in April 2011, producing a mile-wide lava flow. There was another eruption in 2015.|$|E
500|$|The {{topography}} of the Moon has been measured with laser <b>altimetry</b> and stereo image analysis. Its most visible topographic {{feature is the}} giant far-side South Pole–Aitken basin, some [...] in diameter, the largest crater on the Moon and the second-largest confirmed impact crater in the Solar System. At [...] deep, its floor is the lowest point {{on the surface of}} the Moon. The highest elevations of the Moon's surface are located directly to the northeast, and it has been suggested might have been thickened by the oblique formation impact of the South Pole–Aitken basin. Other large impact basins, such as Imbrium, Serenitatis, Crisium, Smythii, and Orientale, also possess regionally low elevations and elevated rims. The far side of the lunar surface is on average about [...] higher than that of the near side.|$|E
500|$|The {{surface of}} Titan has been {{described}} as [...] "complex, fluid-processed, [...] geologically young". Titan has been around since the Solar System's formation, but its surface is much younger, between 100 million and 1 billion years old. Geological processes may have reshaped Titan's surface. Titan's atmosphere is twice as thick as Earth's, making it difficult for astronomical instruments to image its surface in the visible light spectrum. The Cassini spacecraft used infrared instruments, radar <b>altimetry</b> and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging to map portions of Titan during its close fly-bys. The first images revealed a diverse geology, with both rough and smooth areas. There are features that may be volcanic in origin, disgorging water mixed with ammonia onto the surface. There is also evidence that Titan's ice shell may be substantially rigid, which would suggest little geologic activity.|$|E
500|$|When British {{scientists}} in Antarctica performed airborne ice-penetrating radar surveys {{in the early}} 1970s, they detected unusual radar readings at the site which suggested {{the presence of a}} liquid freshwater lake below the ice. In 1991, Jeff Ridley, a remote sensing specialist with the Mullard Space Science Laboratory at University College London, directed the ERS-1 satellite to turn its high-frequency array {{toward the center of the}} Antarctic ice cap. The data from ERS-1 confirmed the findings from the 1973 British surveys, but these new data were not published in the Journal of Glaciology until 1993. Space-based radar revealed that this subglacial body of fresh water is one of the largest lakes in the world, and one of some 140 subglacial lakes in Antarctica. Russian and British scientists delineated the lake in 1996 by integrating a variety of data, including airborne ice-penetrating radar imaging observations and space-based radar <b>altimetry.</b> It has been confirmed that the lake contains large amounts of liquid water under the more than [...] ice cap. The lake has at least 22 cavities of liquid water, averaging [...] each.|$|E
500|$|Long-term {{mass balance}} records from Lemon Creek Glacier in Alaska show {{slightly}} declining mass balance with time. The mean annual balance for this glacier was − each {{year during the}} period of 1957 to 1976. Mean annual balance has been increasingly negatively averaging − per year from 1990 to 2005. Repeat glacier <b>altimetry,</b> or altitude measuring, for 67 Alaska glaciers find rates of thinning have increased by more than a factor of two when comparing the periods from 1950 to 1995 ( [...] per year) and 1995 to 2001 ( [...] per year). This is a systemic trend with loss in mass equating to loss in thickness, which leads to increasing retreat—the glaciers are not only retreating, but they are also becoming much thinner. In Denali National Park, all glaciers monitored are retreating, with an average retreat of [...] per year. The terminus of the Toklat Glacier has been retreating [...] per year and the Muldrow Glacier has thinned [...] since 1979. Well documented in Alaska are surging glaciers that have been known to rapidly advance, even as much as [...] per day. [...] Variegated, Black Rapids, Muldrow, Susitna and Yanert are examples of surging glaciers in Alaska that have made rapid advances in the past. These glaciers are all retreating overall, punctuated by short periods of advance.|$|E

2500|$|ISRO {{has also}} {{successfully}} launched the Indo-French satellite SARAL on 25 February 2013, 12:31 UTC. SARAL (or [...] "Satellite with ARgos and ALtiKa") is a cooperative <b>altimetry</b> technology mission. It {{is being used}} for monitoring the oceans surface and sea-levels. AltiKa will measure ocean surface topography with an accuracy of 8mm, against 2.5cm on average using current-generation altimeters, and with a spatial resolution of 2km.|$|E
2500|$|Recent rise in {{sea levels}} has been {{monitored}} by tide gauges and satellite <b>altimetry</b> (e.g. TOPEX/Poseidon). [...] As {{well as the}} addition of melted ice water from glaciers and ice sheets, recent sea level changes {{are affected by the}} thermal expansion of sea water due to global warming, sea level change due to deglaciation of the last glacial maximum (postglacial sea level change), deformation of the land and ocean floor and other factors. [...] Thus, to understand global warming from sea level change, one must be able to separate all these factors, especially postglacial rebound, since {{it is one of the}} leading factors.|$|E
2500|$|The Taku Glacier near Juneau, Alaska {{has been}} studied by the Juneau Icefield Research Program since 1946, and is the longest {{continuous}} mass balance study of any glacier in North America. Taku is the world's thickest known temperate alpine glacier, and experienced positive mass balance between the years 1946 and 1988, resulting in a huge advance. The glacier has since been in a negative mass balance state, which {{may result in a}} retreat if the current trends continue. The Juneau Icefield Research Program also has studied the mass balance of the Lemon Creek Glacier since 1953. [...] The glacier has had an average annual balance of −0.44 m per year from 1953–2006, resulting in a mean loss of over 27 m of ice thickness. [...] This loss has been confirmed by laser <b>altimetry.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The National Transportation Safety Board {{investigated}} {{the accident and}} their final report was issued on April 14, 1972. In the report the NTSB concluded that the probable cause was that [...] "...the accident {{was the result of}} a descent below Minimum Descent Altitude during a nonprecision approach under adverse operating conditions, without visual contact with the runway environment...". They further stated, [...] "The Board has not been able to determine the reason for the (greater) descent, although the two most likely explanations are an improper use of cockpit instrumentation data, or (b) an <b>altimetry</b> system error." [...] At least one source says that water that had seeped into the plane's altimeter could have thrown off its height readings, leading the pilots to believe the plane was higher than was actually the case.|$|E
2500|$|Geodetic {{methods are}} an {{indirect}} method for {{the determination of}} mass balance of glacier. Maps of a glacier made at two different points in time can be compared and the difference in glacier thickness observed {{used to determine the}} mass balance over a span of years. This is best accomplished today using Differential Global Positioning System. Sometimes the earliest data for the glacier surface profiles is from images that are used to make topographical maps and digital elevation models. Aerial mapping or photogrammetry is now used to cover larger glaciers and icecaps such found in Antarctica and Greenland, however, because of the problems of establishing accurate ground control points in mountainous terrain, and correlating features in snow and where shading is common, elevation errors are typically not less than 10m (32ft). Laser <b>altimetry</b> provides a measurement of the elevation of a glacier along a specific path, e.g., the glacier centerline. The difference of two such measurements is the change in thickness, which provides mass balance over the time interval between the measurements. [...] Again a good method over a span of time but not for annual change detection. The value of geodetic programs is providing an independent check of traditional mass balance work, by comparing the cumulative changes over ten or more years.|$|E
