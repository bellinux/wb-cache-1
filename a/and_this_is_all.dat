For example, there is no DNA difference between human beings. We <b>are</b> <b>all</b> African. Biologically, race does not exist. It is a social and cultural construct ... The U.S. is {{a country with a}} long history of social genocide (Native Americans, African slavery, etc.) <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> due to the seeming differences we attributed to race.
