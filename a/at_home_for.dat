5|$|A sickly child, Gordon Childe {{was educated}} <b>at</b> <b>home</b> <b>for</b> {{a number of}} years, before gaining a private school {{education}} in North Sydney. In 1907, he began attending Sydney Church of England Grammar School, gaining his Junior Matriculation in 1909 and Senior Matriculation in 1910. At school he studied ancient history, French, Greek, Latin, geometry, algebra and trigonometry, achieving good marks in all subjects, but was bullied because of his strange appearance and unathletic physique. In July 1910 his mother died; his father soon took Monica Gardiner as his third wife. Childe's relationship with his father was strained, particularly following his mother's death, and they disagreed {{on the subject of}} religion and politics, with the Reverend being a devout Christian and conservative while his son was an atheist and socialist.|$|E
5|$|After {{the special}} session of Congress had adjourned, Sherman {{returned}} home to Mansfield.

Sherman looked forward to staying with his wife <b>at</b> <b>home</b> <b>for</b> an extended period {{for the first time in}} years, when news arrived that Garfield had been shot in Washington. The assassin, Charles J. Guiteau, was a deranged office-seeker who believed that Garfield's successor would appoint him to a patronage job. After lingering for several months, Garfield died, and Arthur became president. After completing a long-planned visit to Yellowstone National Park and other Western sites with his brother William, Sherman returned to a second special session of Congress in October 1881.|$|E

5|$|McGill University {{played a}} {{meaningful}} {{role in the}} Great War. Many students and alumni enlisted in {{the first wave of}} patriotic fervor that swept the nation in 1914, but in the spring of 1915 — after the first wave of heavy Canadian casualties at Ypres — Hamilton Gault, the founder of the Canadian regiment and a wealthy Montreal businessman, was faced with a desperate shortage of troops. When he reached out to his friends <b>at</b> <b>home</b> <b>for</b> support, over two hundred were commissioned from the ranks, and many more would serve as soldiers throughout the war. On their return to Canada after the war, Major George McDonald and Major George Currie formed the accounting firm McDonald Currie, which later became {{one of the founders of}} Price Waterhouse Coopers. Captain Percival Molson was killed in action in July 1917. Percival Molson Memorial Stadium at McGill is named in his honour.|$|E
5|$|The Highlanders again {{opened their}} {{season with a}} victory at Carisbrook; this time a 238 victory over the Blues. After losing to the Cats in Johannesburg and the Sharks in Durban, they {{returned}} to Carisbrook with a one-point victory over the Stormers. Their 3920 defeat of the Waratahs at Carisbrook on 7 April was the first defeat of New South Wales by an Otago-based side since the Otago provincial team defeated New South Wales 50 in 1901. They narrowly lost to the Hurricanes in Napier 3533 before defeating the Brumbies at Carisbrook on 20 April. After a loss to Queensland they finished their season with a 2621 defeat of the defending champion Crusaders at Carisbrook. Although the Highlanders went undefeated <b>at</b> <b>home</b> <b>for</b> a second consecutive season, the Highlanders finished fifth with six wins that season.|$|E

5|$|Their {{income was}} modest, with George's small per annum living; Cassandra brought the {{expectation}} of a small inheritance {{at the time of}} her mother's death to the marriage. They took up temporary residence at the nearby Deane rectory until Steventon, a 16th century house in disrepair, underwent necessary renovations. Cassandra gave birth to three children while living at Deane: James in 1765, George in 1766, and Edward in 1767. Her custom was to keep an infant <b>at</b> <b>home</b> <b>for</b> several months and then placed it with Elizabeth Littlewood, a woman living nearby to nurse and raise for twelve to eighteen months.|$|E
5|$|With Benfica {{committed}} to the league race, March was a critical month for the club's aspirations. Their first game was a visit to Aves to play Desportivo de Aves. The home team {{had an opportunity to}} lead with a penalty kick in the 36th minute, but Quim stopped Hernâni Borges's shot. In the second half, Nuno Gomes scored the match's only goal when he answered a cross from Nélson. Santos said the result was better than the performance. On the next Thursday, Benfica played Paris St-Germain at the Parc des Princes. Benfica scored first with header from Simão in the tenth minute, but PSG reacted with two goals in five minutes before half-time. The score remained unchanged, giving Benfica a one-goal disadvantage. On 12 March, Benfica met União de Leiria <b>at</b> <b>home</b> <b>for</b> match-day 21. Benfica won 2–0 with goals from Simão and Petit, keeping up the pressure on Porto.|$|E

5|$|In the semi-finals, the Kerala Blasters {{were set}} {{to take on the}} regular season winners, Chennaiyin. The first leg took place <b>at</b> <b>home</b> <b>for</b> the Kerala Blasters, the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium in Kochi, on 13 December 2014. The match could not have been any better for the Kerala Blasters as goals from Ishfaq Ahmed, Iain Hume, and Sushanth Mathew gave the Kerala Blasters a 3–0 {{advantage}} heading to Chennai. The second leg took place three days later at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium in Chennai. Despite heading into the game leading 3–0 on aggregate, the Blasters managed to concede three goals to Chennaiyin in the second leg and thus bring the game into extra-time. Just as it looked like the game was going to be settled in a penalty shoot-out, the Blasters managed to steal the tie when Stephen Pearson scored in the 117th minute and thus help the Kerala Blasters win 4–3 on aggregate.|$|E

They played the Crusaders at Jade Stadium in their semi-final, and were defeated 37–15 after Marika Vunibaka scored two tries for the Crusaders in the last 20minutes. The next season opened with a 23–8 victory over the Blues. Their 39–20 defeat of the Waratahs at Carisbrook on 7 April was the first defeat of New South Wales by an Otago-based side since the Otago provincial team defeated New South Wales 5–0 in 1901.

5|$|The {{band members}} all {{responded to this}} {{production}} method differently, with Iwadera and Kusakari finding the approach the easiest. Okazaki and Ejima both had trouble adopting this method. Okazaki was very anxious about her ability to create demos, having never used music software before, and not even owning a computer before moving to Tokyo. Yamaguchi bought her an iBook to help her with the process. Ejima found difficulty in recording demos due {{to the problem of}} recording drums <b>at</b> <b>home</b> <b>for</b> sound sampling. As a result, he learnt how to play the guitar. In June, the band were creating songs on a daily basis, and in August were still in the pre-production stages of the album. The album was created at Yamaguchi's apartment in Noborito in Kawasaki, Kanagawa, which became a meeting place for all of the band members for the album. In total, around thirty demo compositions were produced for the album. This method of song production also led to Yamaguchi being able to think of the album as a whole, as opposed to their methods on Go to the Future and Night Fishing, in which each song was thought of in its own individual context.|$|E
5|$|The team's {{first season}} at {{their new home}} was in 2002. Their first game at the new {{facility}} was a 28–10 preseason loss to the Indianapolis Colts on August 11, 2002.

It {{was the first time}} the franchise had won 10 games in a single season in 17years. The Seahawks again reached the postseason during the 2004 season and played their first playoff game at CenturyLink Field on January 8, 2005. In that game, they lost to the St. Louis Rams who had already defeated them twice that season. The following season, the Seahawks went undefeated <b>at</b> <b>home</b> <b>for</b> the second time in three years and won their first-ever NFC Championship, but lost in Super Bowl XL.
