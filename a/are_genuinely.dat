5|$|The {{question}} of whether selection of signals works {{at the level of}} the individual organism or gene, or {{at the level of the}} group, has been debated by biologists such as Richard Dawkins, arguing that individuals evolve to signal and to receive signals better, including resisting manipulation. Amotz Zahavi suggested that cheating could be controlled by the handicap principle, where the best horse in a handicap race is the one carrying the largest handicap weight. According to Zahavi's theory, signallers such as male peacocks have 'tails' that <b>are</b> <b>genuinely</b> handicaps, being costly to produce. The system is evolutionarily stable as the large showy tails are honest signals. Biologists have attempted to verify the handicap principle, but with inconsistent results. The mathematical biologist Ronald Fisher analysed the contribution that having two copies of each gene (diploidy) would make to honest signalling, demonstrating that a runaway effect could occur in sexual selection. The evolutionary equilibrium depends sensitively on the balance of costs and benefits.|$|E
5|$|In 1973, Mavis starts dating {{the equally}} shy Jerry Booth (Graham Haberfield), {{but it remains}} platonic. Jerry dies {{of a heart attack}} in 1975 before being able to express his romantic intentions. She meets {{salesman}} Derek Wilton (Peter Baldwin) the following year. They date, but the relationship is strained by Derek's interfering mother, who believes that Mavis is not good enough for her son. The relationship remains non-committal until 1983, when another man competes for Mavis's hand, the artistic Victor Pendlebury (Christopher Coll). Mavis is torn as she likes both but chooses Derek in the end. On their wedding day in 1984 Mavis has second thoughts about marrying Derek and jilts him at the altar. Her guilt turns to indignation when she learns that Derek– feeling the same way she does– did not attend the ceremony either. Derek goes on to an unhappy marriage with Angela Hawthorne (Diane Fletcher), but in 1986 he begins wooing Mavis again, realizing he made a mistake when he let her go. Mavis eventually decides Derek is the man for her and the couple marry in September 1988. The other residents of Coronation Street consider Mavis and Derek something of a joke, but neither care as they <b>are</b> <b>genuinely</b> in love. They spend evenings reading aloud to each other and discussing the events of the day. They remain happy despite the occasional problem, but their happiness is cut short in 1997 when Derek dies suddenly of a heart attack after a road rage incident. Devastated, at his funeral Mavis chastises those who mocked her marriage over the years.|$|E

25|$|In {{the media}} and popular science, quantum non-locality is often portrayed as being {{equivalent}} to entanglement. While {{it is true that}} a pure bipartite quantum state must be entangled in order for it to produce non-local correlations, there exist entangled states that do not produce such correlations, and there exist non-entangled (separable) quantum states that present some non-local behaviour. A well-known example of the first case is the Werner state that is entangled for certain values of , but can always be described using local hidden variables. In short, entanglement of a two-party state is necessary but not sufficient for that state to be non-local. Moreover, it was shown that, for arbitrary number of party, there exist states that <b>are</b> <b>genuinely</b> entangled but admits a fully local strategy. It {{is important to recognize that}} entanglement is more commonly viewed as an algebraic concept, noted for being a precedent to non-locality as well as to quantum teleportation and to superdense coding, whereas non-locality is defined according to experimental statistics and is much more involved with the foundations and interpretations of quantum mechanics.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the late}} 1990s, housing {{policy has been}} a devolved matter, and state support for the homeless, {{together}} with legal rights in housing, have therefore diverged to a certain degree. A national service, called Streetlink, was established in 2012 to help {{members of the public}} obtain near-immediate assistance for specific rough sleepers, {{with the support of the}} Government (as housing is a devolved matter, the service currently only extends to England). Currently, the service does not operate on a statutory basis, and the involvement of local authorities is merely due to political pressure from the government and charities, with funding being provided by the government (and others) on an ad-hoc basis. A member of the public who is concerned that someone is sleeping on the streets can report the individual's details via the Street Link website or by calling the referral line number on 0300 500 0914. Someone who finds themselves sleeping on the streets can also report their situation using the same methods. It is important to note that the Streetlink service is for those who <b>are</b> <b>genuinely</b> sleeping on the streets, and not those who may merely be begging, or ostensibly living their life on the streets despite a place to sleep elsewhere (such as a hostel or supported accommodation).|$|E

25|$|The code {{of ethics}} that is {{affiliated}} with traditional marketing can also be applied to social media. However, with social media being so personal and international, there is another list of complications and challenges that come along with being ethical online. With the invention of social media, the marketer no longer has to focus solely on the basic demographics and psychographics given from television and magazines, but now they can see what consumers {{like to hear from}} advertisers, how they engage online, and what their needs and wants are. The general concept of being ethical while marking on social network sites is to be honest with the intentions of the campaign, avoid false advertising, be aware of user privacy conditions (which means not using consumers' private information for gain), respect the dignity of persons in the shared online community, and claim responsibility for any mistakes or mishaps that are results of your marketing campaign. Most social network marketers use websites like Facebook and MySpace to try to drive traffic to another website. While it is ethical to use social networking websites to spread a message to people who <b>are</b> <b>genuinely</b> interested, many people game the system with auto-friend adding programs and spam messages and bulletins. Social networking websites are becoming wise to these practices, however, and are effectively weeding out and banning offenders.|$|E

A Cercopithecus monkey that ate other grasshoppers refused to eat the species. Another species, the rainbow or painted grasshopper of Arizona, Dactylotum bicolor (Acridoidea), has been shown by experiment with a natural predator, the little striped whiptail lizard, to be aposematic.|$|E

John Lannert of Billboard magazine called the album a [...] "predictable, albeit fan-pleasing, double CD live set" [...] and referred to his mariachi performances as [...] "classics done up mariachi style". Chito de la Torre wrote for La Prensa de San Antonio praised the album, stating that Miguel [...] "stands among the few that <b>are</b> <b>genuinely</b> good both on disc and live" [...] and complimented its [...] "energetic feel and live audience reactions". Rene Carbrera of the Corpus Christi Caller-Times said the album's productions [...] "essentially takes listeners through one of Miguel's dynamic performances" [...] and praised the bolero performances as [...] "superbly executed as pop ballads by Miguel."

500|$|The {{following}} year, Ardai {{stated that}} [...] "Unlike many recent CD-ROM upgrades, {{which have been}} embarrassing and amateurish", the CD-ROM version [...] "has the stamp of quality all over it", with the added dialogue and sound effects [...] "like taking a silent film and {{turning it into a}} talkie ... It's hard to go back to reading text off a monitor after experiencing a game like this". He concluded that [...] "LucasArts has done an impeccable job ... a must-see". In 1992 the magazine named the title as one of the year's four best adventure games. Andy Nuttal of Amiga Format wrote, [...] "The puzzles are very well thought-out, with some exquisite, subtle elements that give you a real kick when you solve them." [...] He noted that the game is [...] "littered with elements that <b>are</b> <b>genuinely</b> funny". His sole complaint was about the game's linearity compared to Monkey Island 2; but he finished by saying, [...] "It's a minor point, anyway, and it shouldn't put you off buying what {{is one of the best}} Amiga adventures ever." [...] In 2008, Retro Gamer Magazine praised it as [...] "a masterful piece of storytelling, and a spellbinding adventure".|$|E

500|$|The {{game was}} {{primarily}} criticized for its short length. IGN's Hilary Goldstein {{stated that the}} game offers [...] "no reason to come back" [...] once you've completed all the puzzles. However, others compared Braids short experience to similar criticisms with Portal in that its length [...] "can be disregarded {{in the face of}} its unique approach to storytelling and expansive ideas". The game's price was also seen as a negative for the game, though McShea wrote that [...] "Braid is worth every penny". Blow later said that he expected the price to be , but Microsoft, in promoting the game as part of its Summer of Arcade, made the price $15. Edge also noted that while Blow had tried to integrate the story and gameplay throughout the game, this only worked well in the final world, and otherwise the story was [...] "a little trite in its self-conscious obscurity". However, others—including new media academics—have disagreed, praising the philosophical complexity of the game, saying [...] "Jonathan Blow's Braid is the sort of ontological labyrinth that Jorge Luis Borges might have made.

500|$|Justin Sevakis, {{writing for}} Anime News Network, and Erica Friedman, founder of Yuricon, {{consider}} the series a [...] "true" [...] shōjo. Friedman wrote, [...] "As {{a representative of}} early shoujoai, Ace wo Nerae is a spectacular example, but expect a fair dollop of cheesy-ness, as the character designs, music, art, etc are all over 30 years old. The op art graphics and laughable opening theme are delightfully retro now. The {{most important thing is}} that the characters <b>are</b> <b>genuinely</b> likeable and their motivations fathomable." [...] Sevakis praised the story as having [...] "purity", as [...] "There are no manufactured obstacles to overcome." [...] He also declared, [...] "Despite being Western-looking and ostensibly about universally accessible sport of tennis, it's a fascinating look at Japanese personal motivation, interaction and decorum," [...] playing [...] "like a catalog of Japan's most interesting cultural quirks." [...] Art-wise it was compared to Dear Brother and The Rose of Versailles by Anime News Network's Lynzee Lamb, who said it [...] "reinforces a lot of the dangerous work ethic that permeates sports series, like battling through a serious injury or abandoning emotional 'dalliances' like romance." ...|$|E
500|$|Reviewers also {{praised the}} game's varied {{scenarios}} and replayability. Dora from Jay Is Games praised the game, saying that [...] "with {{a huge amount}} of replay value, creativity to burn, and some of the most shocking plot lines you could ever hope to encounter, Hatoful Boyfriend is a fascinating and surprising text adventure well worth checking out", though she also observes that [...] "the delayed payoff and the abruptness of some of the endings combined with the oddball concept may not appeal to every fan of the visual novel genre". Alexa Ray Corriea's Polygon review of the remake gave it an 8 out of 10, concluding that the [...] "witty dialogue and absolutely bonkers scenarios <b>are</b> <b>genuinely</b> fun to discover, and the handful of different storylines make repeated playthroughs worthwhile". Some critics however expressed concerns over the presence of some repetitive aspects of gameplay—noted as being especially apparent when attempting multiple playthroughs—as well as the accessibility of the game's Bad Boys Love scenario to casual players: in his review of the remake for PC Gamer, Julian Murdoch states that [...] "I suspect few will have the patience to ride the fast forward button and suss out the romantic proclivities of each cast member to get to the extended ending—really a second half—of the game".|$|E
