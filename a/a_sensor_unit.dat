50|$|According to the Chinese government, the {{importance}} of the HJ-10 program was not only limited to the missile itself, but also in the production techniques associated with it. For example, to meet the developmental needs, various laboratories had to be established, including those for inertial, stabilization, C2 and MEMS technologies; multispectral detection, simulation, digitization, and temperature control. Most of these laboratories had not existed in China previously; their establishment would not only help the development of the HJ-10, but also other missiles and systems, such as the airborne FCS. However, WZ-10, the primary platform originally designed to be armed with the HJ-10, had a slower developmental pace, the ground-launched version of the HJ-10 actually entered service before its airborne counterpart in the early 2000s. Although China had advertised that the HJ-10 could be deployed from various platforms such as airborne, ship-borne and ground-launched vehicles, the only surface version known to exist (as of 2009) is the model based on a high-mobility cross-country truck with <b>a</b> <b>sensor</b> <b>unit</b> mounted on a telescoping arm.|$|E

50|$|The PSE {{unit was}} {{constructed}} principally of beryllium {{and had a}} mass of 11.5 kg, including the electronics module and thermal insulation. It was housed in a drum-shaped enclosure 23 cm in diameter and 29 cm in height. The enclosure was rounded {{on the bottom and}} rested on a leveling stool. The PSE consisted of two main subsystems, <b>a</b> <b>sensor</b> <b>unit</b> and an electronics module. The sensor unit contained three matched long-period (LP) seismometers aligned orthogonally in a triaxial set to measure one vertical and two horizontal components of surface motion. The horizontal component seismometers were very sensitive to tilt and were leveled to high accuracy by means of a two-axis motor-driven gimbal operated by ground command. A third motor adjusted the vertical component seismometer in the vertical direction. A fourth, short-period (SP) seismometer with a resonant period of 1 second measured vertical motion at a peak sensitivity of 8 Hz and a response range from 0.05 to 20 Hz. A thermal shroud and 2.5-W heater for thermal control comprised the rest of the experiment package. The thermal shroud was aluminized mylar which covered the instrument and the ground surrounding the base out to about 75 cm radially.

A fourth, short-period (SP) seismometer with a resonant period of 1 second measured vertical motion at a peak sensitivity of 8 Hz and a response range from 0.05 to 20 Hz. A thermal shroud and 6-W heater for thermal control comprised the rest of the experiment package. The thermal shroud was aluminized mylar which covered the instrument and the ground surrounding the base out to about 75 cm radially. A gnomon and level sensor were mounted on the top center of the shroud. The shroud was modified slightly from the one used on Apollo 12. Total power drain varied from 4.3 to 7.4 W.The seismometers consisted of an inertial mass on a sensor boom suspended by springs and hinges, a capacitor plate and a damping magnet. The LP seismometers could function in a flat-response mode and in a peaked response mode. In the flat response mode, the LP seismometers had a natural period of 15 s. In the peaked-response mode, they acted as underdamped pendulums with a natural period of 2.2 s. Sensitivity to ground motion peaked sharply at 0.45 Hz in peaked response mode with a useful frequency range of 0.004 to 2 Hz. Maximum sensitivity was enhanced by a factor of 6 in the peaked response mode, but sensitivity to low-frequency signals was reduced. All seismometers could detect ground motions as small as 0.3 nm. At tidal frequencies, gravitational acceleration was measured by monitoring the feedback current used to center the seismometer mass. The sensitivity of the instruments was 0.008 mgal. The lunar surface impacts of the spent S-IVB and LM ascent stages were used as external calibration sources for the seismometers. The known mass and velocity of these stages at surface impact and the lunar impact point coordinates enabled the computation of energy generated at impact and the point of energy application. (The calibration characteristics were determined by measuring seismometer response to these energy sources.) ...|$|E

This current study developed <b>a</b> small <b>sensor</b> <b>unit</b> comprising <b>an</b> accelerometer and a gyroscope in order to detect shank and foot segment motion and orientation during different walking conditions. The kinematic data obtained in the pre-swing phase were used to classify five walking conditions: stair ascent, stair descent, level ground, upslope and downslope. The kinematic data consisted of anterior-posterior acceleration and angular velocity measured from the shank and foot segments. A machine learning technique known as support vector machine (SVM) was applied to classify the walking conditions. SVM was also compared with other machine learning methods such as artificial neural network (ANN), radial basis function network (RBF) and Bayesian belief network (BBN). The SVM technique was shown to have a higher performance in classification than the other three methods. The results using SVM showed that stair ascent and stair descent could be distinguished from each other and from the other walking conditions with 100 % accuracy by using <b>a</b> single <b>sensor</b> <b>unit</b> attached to the shank segment.
