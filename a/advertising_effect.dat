40|$|A key {{concern about}} counterfeits and weak {{intellectual}} property protection {{is that they}} may hamper innovation by displacing legitimate sales. This paper combines a natural policy experiment with randomized lab experiments to estimate the heterogeneous impacts of counterfeiting on the sales and consumer purchase intent related to branded products of various quality levels. I collect new product-line-level panel data (1993 - 2004) on Chinese shoe companies. I identify heterogeneous effects of counterfeit entry on sales of authentic products of three quality tiers, finding that counterfeits have both advertising effects for a brand and substitution effects for authentic products, additionally the effects linger for some years. The <b>advertising</b> <b>effect</b> dominates the substitution effect for high-end authentic-product sales, and the substitution effect outweighs the <b>advertising</b> <b>effect</b> for low-end product sales. The positive effect of counterfeits is most pronounced for high-fashion products (such as women’s high-leg boots and dress shoes), for shoes tailored to young customers, and for high-end products of brands not yet well-known {{at the time of}} counterfeiter entry. ...|$|E
40|$|Managing the {{advertising}} function for established brands {{requires an understanding}} of the nature of {{the advertising}}-sales relationship. Historically, both experimental and non-experimental approaches have been used to investigate this relationship, but the impressive amount of literature in this area seems to have identified only a number of broad generalizations. In part, this is due to the inadequacies of the different methodologies and data sources that have been used, which make difficult a comparison of the reported studies for the purpose of establishing guidelines for strategic advertising management. Continuous panel-based experimental research seems to offer greater potential for providing further insights into the nature of the advertising-sales relationship. The research first investigates the appropriateness and sensitivity of a number of models in identifying and quantifying the effect of changes in advertising strategy on sales, using The Test Marketing Group's (TMG) consumer diary and scanner panel data. It is shown that the ability to identify an <b>advertising</b> <b>effect,</b> referred to as the system's sensitivity, is significantly influenced by a number of factors, and that it can be predicted from the number of purchase transactions of the test brand. By using one specific model, thirty-five advertising strategy tests are analyzed at the aggregate, panel level, in order to estimate the probability of causing an <b>advertising</b> <b>effect</b> on all panelists, and to identify factors that influence the effect. Application of this methodology represents the first consistent analysis of a collection of historical data with the objective of developing a knowledge base regarding advertising strategy making and testing. It is found the probability of causing an <b>advertising</b> <b>effect</b> does not differ between copy and weight tests, but that a change in copy carries a significant risk of causing a negative effect. Increases in weight are particularly effective in causing a positive effect for small share brands. among the tests that are analyzed there is a 37. 1...|$|E

40|$|Children are {{important}} targets of advertising campaigns from companies. However, {{children have been}} found to be particularly vulnerable to negative <b>effects</b> of <b>advertising,</b> and protecting children from these effects is an important task of consumer policy. Two important aspects have to be considered in this task. First, advertising affects judgments and behaviour not only during ad exposure, but also in delayed consumption and purchase contexts. Second, advertising thrives largely at an implicit level – during ad exposure as well as in consumption decisions. The current article introduces a dual-step (ad exposure vs. purchase/consumption) and dual-process (implicit vs. explicit) model of <b>advertising</b> <b>effects</b> on children. The model is based on a review of implicit <b>advertising</b> <b>effects</b> and implicit mechanisms of self-control. It implies that consumer policies intending to prevent undesired <b>advertising</b> <b>effects</b> should support interventions with the goal of strengthening advertising and purchasing literacy and, in addition, implicit self-control mechanisms in children. As self-control in consumption decisions is largely relevant for, and learned during, shopping and consumption, such interventions should focus on educating parents or other primary caregivers, because they are the most likely persons to accompany children in such situations and have a great influence on children’s implicit learning...|$|R
40|$|The <b>effect</b> of <b>advertising</b> {{on market}} {{performance}} {{has been a}} long-standing debate. Advertising that increases the dispersion of consumers’ valuations for advertised goods raises the market power of firms, while advertising that decreases the dispersion of consumers’ valuations leads to narrower price-cost margins and superior performance in markets for advertised goods. Numerous challenges confound the empirical identification of <b>advertising</b> <b>effects</b> on market performance. This paper proposes a simple method that relies on the revealed preferences of firms participating in generic advertising programs. Generic advertising programs provide a unique window through which to observe <b>advertising</b> <b>effects</b> on market performance, because changes in the dispersion of consumers’ valuations systematically redistributes rents among firms according to observable characteristics on producer size. We examine producer attitudes towards generic advertising in the “Beef. It’s What’s for Dinner” campaign of the U. S. Beef Checkoff program and find the likelihood a producer favors {{an expansion of the}} advertising program increases in operating scale. This finding is consistent with <b>advertising</b> <b>effects</b> that have led to a decrease in the dispersion of consumers’ valuations for beef products and a commensurate increase in market performance.

We used both types of measures to assess whether exposure to different media combinations affects the cognitive and evaluative impact of advertising. Results show that participants performed better on all explicit and implicit measures of memory and brand preference after exposure (versus no exposure) to target ads, which validated the use of these measures. Comparison of cross-media versus single medium exposure showed differences on the explicit level, but not on the implicit level. This suggests (1) that cross-media advantages may be driven by explicit rather than implicit memory mechanisms, and (2) that implicit <b>advertising</b> <b>effects</b> may require more drastic manipulations than context changes, such as varying the combination of media used for exposure to advertising...|$|R

40|$|As it {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} that subliminal advertising can affect consumers' decisions - if the ad is goal relevant - the question rises whether consumers are able to shield themselves from subliminal influences. In the present research it was examined whether warning people {{of the presence of}} subliminal ads could decrease subliminal <b>advertising</b> <b>effects.</b> In Study 1, it was demonstrated that warning people of subliminal ads indeed diminished priming effects on consumer choice, whereas subliminal <b>advertising</b> <b>effects</b> were replicated for people who were not warned (i. e., people for whom the primed brand was goal relevant were more likely to select it when primed). Study 2 extended these findings, revealing that both participants warned before and after the priming manipulation were less influenced by subliminal brand primes than controls. This suggests that the warning does not decrease participants' sensitivity to the prime, but instead affects the influence of the prime at the behavioral level.
