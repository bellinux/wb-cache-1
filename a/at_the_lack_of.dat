5|$|In 1974, {{staff at}} Canada Post's Montreal office were noticing a {{considerable}} number of letters addressed to Santa Claus entering the postal system, and those letters were being treated as undeliverable. Since employees handling those letters did not want the writers, mostly young children, to be disappointed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> response, they started answering the letters themselves.|$|E
5|$|No Doubt became {{frustrated}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> progress {{they were}} making with Interscope, who were proving unreliable in their support of the band. Instead, they built their own studio in their garage on Beacon Avenue in Anaheim, California Although the band had knowledge that they didn't want any songs {{to be released in}} an Interscope-distributed album, they recorded The Beacon Street Collection in their studio and Clear Lake Audio in one long weekend. Their independence shocked their company representative, Tony Ferguson, who had assumed they were recording a third single.|$|E
5|$|Both clubs {{received}} an allocation of approximately 25,000 tickets, {{fewer than the}} 32,000 received for the semi-finals. The allocation was enough for the 21,000 Stoke City season ticket holders, but not for Manchester City's 36,000 season ticket holders. Consequently, some supporters felt aggrieved <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> tickets, including Stoke City chairman Peter Coates who expressed his disappointment and suggested an allocation {{in the region of}} 30,000 for both clubs. Ticket prices for the final exceeded £100 for the first time. The most expensive tickets cost £115, an increase of 22percent on the previous season. The cheapest tickets available at £45, up £5 from 2010.|$|E

5|$|By {{the sixth}} {{day of the}} siege the gunmen had become {{increasingly}} frustrated <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> progress in meeting their demands. That evening, they killed one of the hostages and threw his body out of the embassy. As a result, the government ordered the Special Air Service (SAS), a special forces regiment of the British Army, to conduct an assault—Operation Nimrod—to rescue the remaining hostages. Shortly afterwards, SAS soldiers abseiled {{from the roof of}} the building and forced entry through the windows. During the 17-minute raid, they rescued {{all but one of the}} remaining hostages, and killed five of the six hostage-takers. The soldiers later faced accusations of unnecessarily killing two of the five, but an inquest into the deaths eventually cleared the SAS of any wrongdoing. The sole remaining gunman was prosecuted and served 27 years in British prisons.|$|E
5|$|Dishonored 2 was {{released}} {{to a positive}} reception. Praised were the improvements made since the first game: the more challenging stealth, the adaptability of Emily and Corvo's abilities to both play styles, the art direction, the creative design of individual missions, {{the realization of the}} game's world as well as the replay-value and the artificial intelligence. Criticism was directed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> focus of the overarching narrative. Aside from this, technical blunders as well as issues with the PC version were received unfavorably. Dishonored 2 won the award for Best Action/Adventure Game at The Game Awards 2016 and for Costume Design at the 2017 NAVGTR Awards.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{conclusion}} of the season, Murray mutually agreed a split with long-term backroom staff, training partner Dani Vallverdu and fitness coach Jez Green. They had been with him for five and seven years respectively but were both reported to have been unhappy <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> consultation they had been given about the appointment of Mauresmo. Murray also took part in the inaugural season of the International Premier Tennis League, representing the Manila Mavericks, who had drafted him as an icon player in February. Murray took part in the first three matches of the tournament which were all played in Manila.|$|E

5|$|Houston pioneered American car {{culture in}} the early 1900s thanks to the ready {{availability}} of inexpensive gasoline. By the 1920s traffic congestion had become so serious that the city became {{the first in the}} nation to install interconnected traffic lights. Visitors to the city were often astonished <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> pedestrian access to shopping venues and the importance of the automobile within the city. Though mass transit had been successful in Houston's earlier years, later efforts aimed at promoting mass transit and urban planning were largely defeated in Houston because of opposition by the public, which favored public investment in roads over mass transit. Urban concepts pioneered in Houston, like establishing shopping centers outside the city's core and encouraging suburban sprawl, became major trends adopted in many cities, both within the state and around the country.|$|E
5|$|In 1974, Eastwood {{teamed up}} with Jeff Bridges and George Kennedy in the buddy action caper Thunderbolt and Lightfoot, a road movie about a veteran bank robber Thunderbolt (Eastwood) and a young con man drifter, Lightfoot (Bridges). On its release, in spring 1974, the film was praised for its offbeat comedy mixed with high {{suspense}} and tragedy but was only a modest success at the box office, earning $32.4million. Eastwood's acting was noted by critics, but was overshadowed by Bridges who was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. Eastwood reportedly fumed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> Academy Award recognition for him and swore {{that he would never}} work for United Artists again.|$|E
5|$|In November 1882, he {{left the}} Inconstant, spent Christmas in Darmstadt, and in March the {{following}} year visited his younger brother, Prince Alexander, in Bulgaria. Alexander had been made Sovereign Prince of Bulgaria in 1879 {{with the approval of}} Europe's Great Powers. Louis accompanied his brother on a state visit to Turkey, and then on a tour of Cyprus and the Holy Land with the Turkish navy, during which Louis was appalled <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> seamanship—the Turkish captains were unable to navigate and had to hug the coast so as not to get lost; when they did leave the coast they became so disoriented that they were unable to steer for Jaffa. On its return journey the ship on which they had travelled ran aground.|$|E

50|$|One of the {{earliest}} V4 internal combustion engines was that designed by Émile Mors of Paris to power his motor-car of 1897. The 90 degree V-angle with central camshaft and spark ignition meant its layout is much like more modern engines, though {{in this case the}} inlet valves were operated by suction alone. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> time <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> vibration from this layout was a key selling point.|$|R
5|$|Meanwhile, the {{marriage}} of Mary's parents was in jeopardy. Disappointed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> a male heir, and eager to remarry, Henry attempted to have his marriage to Catherine annulled, but Pope Clement VII refused his request. Henry claimed, citing biblical passages (Leviticus 20:21), that his marriage to Catherine was unclean {{because she was the}} widow of his brother Arthur (Mary's uncle). Catherine claimed that her marriage to Arthur was never consummated and so was not a valid marriage. Her first marriage had been annulled by a previous pope, Julius II, on that basis. Clement may have been reluctant to act because he was influenced by Charles V, Catherine's nephew and Mary's former betrothed, whose troops had surrounded and occupied Rome in the War of the League of Cognac.|$|E
5|$|Returning to England in 1934, Morgan assumed {{command of}} the 4th Anti-Aircraft Battery, which was {{deployed}} to Malta during the diplomatic crisis that accompanied the Italian invasion of Abyssinia in 1935. He served in the War Office from 1936 to 1938. Here he became increasingly disturbed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> urgency that the government displayed {{in the face of}} a war that Morgan and his fellow staff officers felt was inevitable and imminent. That year he was promoted colonel and became General Staff Officer (Grade 1) of the 3rd Division, in which Brigadier Bernard Montgomery commanded the 8th Infantry Brigade.|$|E
5|$|September 16, 1903– A {{hurricane}} makes landfall on Atlantic City as an 80mph (129km/h) hurricane, {{making it}} the most recent (until 2011) hurricane to directly strike the state. Dubbed by the Atlantic City Press as the Vagabond Hurricane, the storm gathers media interest from Philadelphia and New York, with one newspaper offering $200,000 (1903USD) to aid the survivors. When the reporters arrive at the coast, they are disappointed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> damage, which is confined to loose boards along the boardwalk. The storm's strong surf destroys several boats along the coastline, including 34 in Waretown.|$|E

50|$|The small {{effective}} range of only 64 unique glyphs precludes support for Latin lower case letters, and many symbols used widely in computing {{such as the}} exclamation point and <b>the</b> <b>at</b> sign. <b>The</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> an apostrophe led some software authors to use a comma instead.|$|R
50|$|On January 3 the two armies met <b>at</b> Kinsale. <b>The</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> {{coordination}} between <b>the</b> rescue {{army and the}} besieged, coupled with the disorganization of the Irish and {{the superiority of the}} English cavalry, turned the Battle of Kinsale into a major defeat for the Spanish-Irish coalition.|$|R
5|$|September 27, 1985– Hurricane Gloria {{parallels}} the New Jersey coastline just offshore as a Category2 hurricane. Its arrival forces 95,000citizens to evacuate, while eleven casinos in Atlantic City are closed, {{resulting in a}} loss of $7million (1985USD). Dubbed by some as the storm of the century, the hurricane is expected to become the first hurricane to hit the New Jersey coastline since the hurricane in 1903, though a last minute turn spares the state. While passing by the state, Gloria caused a storm surge of 4.6feet (1.4m) in Ventnor City and a wind gust of 80mph (129km) in Ocean City. Despite coming within miles of the coast, the storm caused only light rainfall along the shoreline, though further inland there were reports of over 5inches (13cm). Strong winds down trees and power lines, leaving 237,000 without power after the storm. Overall, damage is minor, and some were even disappointed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> damage from the proclaimed storm of the century.|$|E
5|$|The 1st Rhodesia Regiment {{was soon}} posted back to Cape Town, {{where many of}} the troopers voiced their dissatisfaction <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> {{fighting}} in South-West Africa, and requested discharge so they could join the war in Europe. Superiors assured the men that they would see action in East Africa if they stayed, but failed to convince most of them; the 1st Rhodesia Regiment promptly disbanded {{due to a lack of}} personnel. The majority of the South-West Africa veterans boarded ship for England to enlist in the British Army, while others mustered into South African units already billed for European service.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. Department of Homeland Security's U.S. Coast Guard, 7th District {{issued an}} {{advisory}} to mariners, warning them {{to prepare for}} the storm and avoid the ocean if possible. In Georgia, the National Park Service evacuated the residents of Cumberland Island and closed the ferry which services it. The Glynn County Emergency Operations Agency monitored and prepared for Tropical Storm Tammy's landfall, however the poor warning hampered their efforts. Residents all over the state expressed frustration <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> time they had to prepare.

5|$|The game {{retained}} the mechanics and gameplay of its predecessor but introduced new levels, settings and graphics. Former journalist Stuart Campbell designed the game's levels, making them harder and more tactically demanding, {{as well as}} introducing a multitude of pop culture references in the level titles. The development of the game's plot was hampered by budget constraints and the resulting lack of explanation confused reviewers. Critics enjoyed the gameplay retained from the original Cannon Fodder but were disappointed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> new mechanics or weapons, comparing the game to a data disk. Reviewers praised the game's level design, though less so those of its alien planet. Critics gave Cannon Fodder 2 positive reviews but lower scores than its predecessor and gave mixed criticism of the new theme music and increased difficulty.|$|E
5|$|The {{general strike}} of 1950 {{began in the}} coal mining centres of Hainaut and quickly spread. Workers were soon on strike across Wallonia, Brussels, and, to a lesser extent, Flanders.

On 30 July, four workers were shot dead by the Gendarmerie at Grâce-Berleur, near Liège and the violence intensified. Staunch Leopoldists in the Government called for a stronger stance but found themselves in a minority, even in the PSC–CVP.

5|$|After {{scouring}} the Great Sea, Link learns {{that he must}} use maps and clues hidden in the Temple of the Ocean King to find the Spirits of Courage, Wisdom, and Power, which in turn will help him locate the Ghost Ship. With {{the help of the}} Phantom Hourglass, Link finds the Spirits of Wisdom and Power. When Link asks Oshus where to find the Spirit of Courage, Oshus explains that it is in fact Ciela, after which she transforms into her true form. Now in possession of the three Spirits, Link, along with Ciela and Oshus, locate the Ghost Ship and find Tetra on board, who has been turned to stone. While Link determines how to save Tetra, Oshus reveals that he is the Ocean King and that he and Ciela had to change their appearances to hide from Bellum, a life-eating monster that Link must destroy to save Tetra. Oshus also mentions that Bellum was the one who created the Ghost Ship and turned Tetra into a statue, and that he has taken residence deep in the Temple of the Ocean King. Linebeck quickly readies to abandon their quest; outraged <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> treasure to be found.
