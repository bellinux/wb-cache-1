40|$|In {{order to}} prevent the scour {{resulting}} from water falls, such as a vertical waterjet impinging normally on a sediment bed, {{it is necessary to}} make clear the hydraulicmechanism of the beginning of motion of sand gravels, that is the criterion for scour,due to the flows caused by a vertical jet. The first part of this paper deals with the theoretical approach to solve the char-acter of flows close to a boundary which is caused by impingement of jets on a normalboundary. A theoretical consideration for the boundary layer growth on the normalboundary in the various cases of two and three dimensional jets, at submerged and non-submerged conditions is described with the aid of the results of some experiments. Inthe above considerations, the boundary layer growth in the vicinity of impingement ofjets is disclosed. In the second part, the criterion <b>for</b> <b>scour</b> from a vertical submerged water jet isanalyzed by the same procedure as done by the author in the previous paper entitled"Basic Studies on the Criterion <b>for</b> <b>Scour</b> from Flows Downstream of an Outlet". It isconcluded from the comparison between the theoretical and experimental results that thefundamental relationships in the criterion <b>for</b> <b>scour,</b> which are reduced by the theory,are in good agreement with the experimental results. Based on both results of the theoryand the experiments, an empirical formula for the criterion <b>for</b> <b>scour</b> from a verticalsubmerged water jet is proposed, and moreover, some considerations on the method pre-venting the bed from scour are described...|$|R

" These three documents contain updated material from previous editions and continued research by NCHRP, FHWA, State DOTs, and universities. This fifth edition of HEC- 18 also contains revisions obtained from further scour-related developments {{and the use of}} the 2001 edition by the highway community. The major changes in the fifth edition of HEC- 18 are: expanded discussion on the policy and regulatory basis <b>for</b> the FHWA <b>Scour</b> Program, including risk-based approaches for evaluations, developing Plans of Action (POAs) <b>for</b> <b>scour</b> critical bridges, and expanded discussion on countermeasure design philosophy (new vs. existing bridges).

40|$|Survival to {{maturity}} and {{age at first}} calving were studied in heifer calves from 34 randomly selected Holstein dairy farms in southwestern Ontario. Calves were divided into cohorts {{on the basis of}} treatment <b>for</b> pneumonia, <b>scours,</b> other diseases, or no treatments, during the first 90 days of life. An effect of pneumonia and scours together, over and above the effects of each disease alone, was assessed by means on an interaction term in the statistical analyses. Heifers which had been treated for pneumonia during {{the first three months of}} life were 2. 5 times more likely to die after 90 days of age than heifers which had not been treated for pneumonia, after controlling for the farm effect. Heifers with a calfhood history of being treated <b>for</b> <b>scours</b> were 2. 5 times more likely to be sold for dairy purposes than other calves.

40|$|Tens of {{millions}} of dollars have been spent over the years on Federal-aid highway system bridges damaged by floods. Nearly 500, 000 of the 577, 000 existing bridges within the National Bridge Inventory are over waterways. The screening of these bridges over waterways <b>for</b> <b>scour</b> susceptibility will be completed, for the most part, by October 1992. The Federal Highway Administration has established January 1997 as the completion date <b>for</b> the <b>scour</b> evaluations of all existing bridges identified as scour susceptible. A cost-effective means of determining the specifics of bridges with unknown foundations is not currently available. Pending the development of technology to determine unknown foundations, these structures must be monitored during routine National Bridge Inspection Standards inspections and following significant flood events. The only exception to this course of action is for unknown foundation bridges on the Interstate system, which must be evaluated <b>for</b> <b>scour</b> before the January 1997 target date. This paper presents the existing bridge scour evaluation requirements, the magnitude of the overall scour evaluation program and the status of progress to date...|$|R
