2500|$|Some Israeli {{media outlets}} {{initially}} suggested that Natan-Zada {{be buried in}} the West Bank settlement of Kiryat Arba, where Baruch Goldstein, who committed Cave of the Patriarchs massacre 11 years earlier, is buried. Natan-Zada's body resided for two days in the Abu-Kabir morgue, pending an appeal to Prime Minister Sharon by his parents. On 7 August 2005, the Prime Minister's Bureau overruled Meir Nitzan's ban against burial in Rishon LeZion, and decreed that Zada should be buried in the civilian cemetery there. He {{was buried in the}} Gordon neighborhood. Because of the delays, Natan-Zada was buried two days after Jewish law allows. Three of the hundreds of mourners at the burial were arrested with <b>administrative</b> <b>arrest</b> orders, including [...] "New Kach" [...] leader Efraim Hershkovits, American citizen Saadia Herskof, and former Kach activist Tiran Pollack's son Gilad.|$|E

50|$|In {{addition}} to the 678 arrested gang members, 164 individuals were arrested for federal and/or state criminal violations, or administrative immigration violations. Of the 164, 117 were charged with criminal offenses, 46 had violent criminal histories, 47 were <b>administrative</b> <b>arrests</b> and 78 were foreign nationals. Eighty-six firearms, eight pounds of methamphetamine, thirty pounds of marijuana, one pound of cocaine, over $70,000 and two vehicles were also seized.|$|R
5000|$|In April 2015 Alexander Lukashenko {{signed a}} bill [...] "On {{preventing}} freeloading practices" [...] which introduced a fine on unemployed population. This law obliges all citizens who are not paying direct taxes less than 183 days every year to pay a fee {{in the size of}} 20 basic amounts (BYN 360 ≈ $250). Mass media compared the bill with a struggle with [...] "тунеядцы", or social parasites, in Soviet Union. Several groups of people are exempt from paying the fee: parents with a child under 7 years old, disabled persons, students, etc. Avoiding of payment is going to be punished by fines, <b>administrative</b> <b>arrests</b> and compulsory public works.|$|R
2500|$|Despite pre-match scare stories {{suggesting}} 5,600 hooligans {{were about}} to descend on the [...] "Venice of the north", Birmingham's visit passed off with only eight <b>administrative</b> <b>arrests,</b> and the Bruges police used their Twitter account to thank the visiting fans for their [...] "friendly conduct". On the field, the defence made a shaky start as Brugge took an early lead through Joseph Akpala. After 25 minutes, David Murphy ran into the penalty area apparently unnoticed to finish Elliott's cross. Rooney failed to convert Žigić's knockdown and Žigić put a free header wide before Hughton brought on King and Wood in their place. Near the end of normal time, a clash of heads with Akpala left Pablo Ibáñez unconscious for some minutes before he was carried off on a spinal board, leaving teammate Guirane N'Daw in tears. In the tenth minute of stoppage time, King crossed from the right and Wood shot into {{the roof of the}} net from six yards out, to make Birmingham the first English team to defeat Brugge in their own stadium, and put them top of Group H.|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, Zaur Gurbanli was blogger and on September 29, 2012 he was {{detained}} {{by people in}} civic gears presenting themselves as officials of Department for Combating Organized Crime because of his political activity and Absheron district court {{made a decision to}} <b>administrative</b> <b>arrest</b> for 15 days according to article 310.1 of the Administrative offences Code of the Azerbaijan Republic.|$|E
50|$|Several {{days after}} Berkut riot police clashed with Euromaidan protesters, Verkhovna Rada enacted law 721-VII banning wearing masks, helmets or {{camouflage}} clothing by people {{taking part in}} a gathering, assembly, demonstration, protest, rally or other mass event. Fines for violating are monetary up to about $400 or <b>administrative</b> <b>arrest</b> up to 15 days. The law was repealed in January 2014.|$|E
50|$|In September 1999 the {{governor}} of Amman, Qaftan Majali, asked Abu Zant to sign a pledge withholding him from keeping pro-Hamas speeches. Abu Zant refused and was placed under <b>administrative</b> <b>arrest.</b> In total he was arrested three times during the month for violating the Sermons Law of Jordan. Shortly before his arrest he had criticized a government crackdown on Hamas supporters, which happened in August. The Muslim Brotherhood subsequently demanded his release. During his life Abu Zant had been expelled from Egypt, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia as his voiced opinions were deemed to radical.|$|E
50|$|With a {{high profile}} as an ultra-nationalist, Meir, {{together}} with Eviatar Slonim and Mordechai Meyer, was arrested in a government crackdown as a suspect for the arson given his association with numerous prior attacks. The government withheld the reasons for his arrest. He was imprisoned under administrative detention laws, which are mainly applied to Palestinians and rarely to Jews, for six months leading to widespread assumptions {{that he was the}} ringleader of several violent terrorist actions. Human rights groups in Israel like B'Tselem criticized the use of administrative detention. The confirmation of the decision was made by Judge Avraham Tal after reviewing 180 intelligence reports and an 82 page long document of analysis provided by the Shin Bet. His lawyer complained that Ettinger had been subjected to tiltul methods, rough shaking and punching, during his interrogation. Moshe Yaalon also commented that the government was convinced the 3 youths in detention were linked to the Duma attack, stating that, 'We wouldn't conduct these <b>administrative</b> <b>arrests</b> if there wasn't any connection to the arson.'His mother secluded herself after her son was arrested.|$|R

50|$|Other {{employees}} of the Channel were repeatedly subjected to <b>administrative</b> <b>arrest</b> on fake charges as well. For instance, Dmitri Schelokov was arrested for 15 days for appearing {{in front of the}} administrative Court building to support the arrested journalist Andrei Tsukanov. Prior to this, Dmitri Schelokov and Rinat Kibrayev had been arrested for 10 days for intending {{to take part in the}} meeting with Akim Akhmetzhan Yesimov arranged especially for Almaty bloggers.

40|$|Excerpt] Over {{the past}} few years, the media have been filled with reports about {{worksite}} enforcement operations, {{commonly referred to as}} immigration raids. These operations represent the public face of efforts by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to curtail the employment of unauthorized immigrants (illegal aliens). According to 2006 estimates, there are some 7. 8 million unauthorized workers in the U. S. civilian workforce. DHS’s U. S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is responsible for Immigration-related worksite enforcement, or enforcement of the prohibitions on unauthorized employment in Section 274 A of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). The INA § 274 A provisions, sometimes referred to as employer sanctions, make it unlawful for an employer to knowingly hire, recruit or refer for a fee, or continue to employ an alien who is not authorized to be so employed. Today, ICE’s worksite enforcement program is focused primarily on cases that involve critical infrastructure facilities and cases involving employers who commit “egregious violations” of criminal statutes and engage in worker exploitation. Employers who violate INA prohibitions on the unlawful employment of aliens may be subject to civil monetary penalties and/or criminal penalties. Criminal investigations may result in defendants being charged with crimes beyond unlawful employment and being subject to the relevant penalties for those violations. Various measures are available to examine the performance of ICE’s worksite enforcement program. They include Final Orders for civil monetary penalties, <b>administrative</b> fines, <b>administrative</b> <b>arrests,</b> criminal arrests, criminal indictments and convictions, and criminal fines and forfeitures. In recent years, ICE has generally focused less on administrative fines and more on <b>administrative</b> and criminal <b>arrests,</b> criminal prosecutions, and criminal fines and forfeitures. The data presented here show increases in these latter measures in recent years. At the same time, however, when considered in terms of the estimated size of the unauthorized workforce or the potential number of employers employing these workers in violation of the law, ICE’s worksite enforcement program can seem quite small. Enforcement activity by the Department of Labor (DOL) is also relevant to a discussion of federal efforts to curtail unauthorized employment. DOL, which is responsible for enforcing minimum wage, overtime pay, and related requirements, focuses a significant percentage of its enforcement resources on a group of low-wage industries that employ large numbers of immigrant—and presumably large numbers of unauthorized—workers. Related background information can be found in CRS Report RL 33973, Unauthorized Employment in the United States: Issues and Options, and a discussion of related legislation can be found in CRS Report RL 34204, Immigration Legislation and Issues in the 110 th Congress. This report will be updated when new data become available...|$|R

50|$|The Kazakhstan’s {{authorities}} have repeatedly {{tried to stop}} the broadcasting of Channel 16/12. The Channel’s employees were intimidated, arrested, their offices were searched and the equipment needed for their work seized. Specifically, in 2014, officers of the National Security Committee of Kazakhstan, along with law enforcement officers of Russia, burst into the office of the production company which was making videos for the TV Channel 16/12. They conducted a search, withdrew hard discs from the operating computers and took them away. Soon after that, a similar search was conducted in the Astana office of a company which was also making videos for the opposition channel. During the search, the equipment needed for their work was seized. Prior to this, Sanat Urnaliyev, journalist of TV Channel 16/12, and Viktor Gudz, the cameraman, were subjected to <b>administrative</b> <b>arrest</b> on a fake charge, along with a correspondent of Radio Azattyk, the Kazakh service of the Radio Liberty.|$|E

40|$|In 2009, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) issued new {{guidance}} on immigration- related worksite enforcement.

5000|$|Arguably {{only the}} last is a true exception—the first two can better be viewed as {{consistent}} with the Miranda factors. For example, questions that are routinely asked {{as part of the}} <b>administrative</b> process of <b>arrest</b> and custodial commitment are not considered [...] "interrogation" [...] under Miranda because they are not intended or likely to produce incriminating responses. Nonetheless, all three circumstances are treated as exceptions to the rule. The jail house informant exception applies to situations where the suspect does not know that he is speaking to a state-agent; either a police officer posing as a fellow inmate, a cellmate working as an agent for the state or a family member or friend who has agreed to cooperate with the state in obtaining incriminating information.|$|R

When Fedya is urged to let him sit in his seat, Shurik offers the seat to the pregnant woman. Fedya is enraged at being deceived and gets into a fight with Shurik. As a result, Fedya is arrested and sentenced to 15 days of Community service, Russian <b>administrative</b> <b>arrest</b> or simply '15 sutok' (15 days). Ironically, he is sent to serve his term to the same construction site where Shurik works part-time. The manager puts them on the same work crew. Fedya does not do his work properly, bullies Shurik, and plans to get revenge on the young student. When Shurik finally hits back, the two get involved in a Tom and Jerry-style chase throughout the construction site using building equipment and various materials as weapons.

50|$|Special {{agents of}} the ATF, DEA, FBI, USSS, DSS, USCG, CGIS, EPA Criminal Investigation Division, PFPA, USMS, and ICE/Homeland Security Investigations not only {{have the power to}} enforce the General Criminal Code (Title 18), but also {{applicable}} state and local laws, if so authorized by the state in which they are operating. Defense Criminal Investigative Service (DCIS), United States Army Criminal Investigation Command (USACIDC), United States Army Counterintelligence, Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS), and U.S. Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI) special agents not only investigate statutes within the United States Code and state and local laws with a nexus to their branch, but are also tasked with enforcing the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), a jurisdiction not held by most of the larger federal agencies. All DCIS, USACIDC, Army Counterintelligence, NCIS, and AFOSI special agents enjoy statutory law enforcement authority, although civilian and military agents derive their principal arrest authority from different federal statutes. Other special agents, such as those employed by the National Park Service, have jurisdiction over crimes committed within the boundaries of or have a nexus to the lands managed by their agency or department only. Homeland Security Investigations Special Agents have <b>administrative</b> <b>arrest</b> powers under the Immigration and Nationality Act.

One reason given to explain why, as opposed to the rapid results in tracking down and arresting Palestinian militants, the Jewish suspects had managed to remain operative and undetected for 5 years, was that, with Palestinian cases, Israel applies the British Mandatory Emergency Defense Regulations code of 1945, whereas the Shin Bet is required to observe the Israeli criminal code procedures with Jewish suspects, procedures which do not foresee <b>administrative</b> detention, placing <b>arrested</b> suspects in isolation for 2 weeks, demolishing homes and other forms of pressure to obtain breakthroughs.|$|R

[...] Individuals who publicly or privately criticized the government or the president risked government reprisal. In March 2011 President Jammeh warned independent journalists that he would “not compromise or sacrifice the peace, security, stability, dignity, and the well being of Gambians for the sake of freedom of expression.” Accusing some journalists of being the “mouthpiece of opposition parties,” he vowed to prosecute any journalist who offended him.
