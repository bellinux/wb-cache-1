Processing elements {{are arranged in}} a regular grid of identical cells. The grid is usually a square tiling, or tessellation, {{of two or three}} dimensions; other tilings are possible, but not yet used. Cell states are determined only by interactions with adjacent neighbor cells. No means exists to communicate directly with cells farther away. One such cellular automaton processor <b>array</b> <b>configuration</b> is the systolic array. Cell interaction can be via electric charge, magnetism, vibration (phonons at quantum scales), or any other physically useful means. This can be done in several ways so no wires are needed between any elements. This is very unlike processors used in most computers today, von Neumann designs, which are divided into sections with elements that can communicate with distant elements over wires.|$|E

In {{uniform linear array}} (ULA) the phase of the incoming signal [...] {{should be limited to}} [...] to avoid grating waves. It means that for angle of arrival [...] in the interval [...] sensor spacing should be smaller than half the wavelength [...] However, the width of the main beam, i.e., the resolution or directivity of the array, is determined by the length of the array compared to the wavelength. In order to have a decent directional resolution the length of the array should be several times larger than the radio wavelength.|$|E

These observations were taken at the highest frequency of the telescope, centered at 34 GHz, to reduce foreground contamination. Another, larger area of the sky was also observed, but less precisely. The data from these observations were reduced independently at all three involved institutions. The results from these observations were published {{in a series of}} four papers in 2003; those by Watson et al., Taylor et al., Scott et al. and Rubino-Martin et al. (see References below). The key results were the power spectra of the Cosmic Microwave Background between multipoles of 150 and 900, and the resulting limits on cosmological parameters when combined with data from observations from other experiments.|$|E

It is located at Kilpisjärvi, Enontekiö near the border with Norway. It comprises two LOFAR-derived radio telescope systems and is capable of observing at HF and VHF radio frequencies. It is used for atmospheric, near-Earth space and astronomical research. KAIRA uses LOFAR phased-array antennas and digital signal-processing hardware. The phased <b>array</b> <b>configuration</b> has no moving parts and with digital control, allows KAIRA to quickly scan the sky, giving KAIRA a large field of view. KAIRA can produce a continuous all-sky image of the radio transparency of ionosphere, using cosmic radio noise for [...] "illumination" [...] (riometry). KAIRA can also obtain electron density profiles in the atmosphere.

In the Group mode we can have number of configurations to defend vulnerable areas depending upon nature and expected threat pattern, characteristics of threat. Similarly, multiple batteries in autonomous mode can be deployed to defend vulnerable areas/points. In a Group formation, the four Batteries can be deployed in various geometric formations, as suited to the vulnerable area being protected and the extent desired to be sanitized from enemy air threat. In a box deployment pattern, an Akash group can defend an area of 62 km x 62 km. In a linear <b>array</b> <b>configuration,</b> it covers an area of 98 km x 44 km.

40|$|A {{simulation}} suite, cueMAP, {{has been}} developed to facilitate the design of inspection processes and sparse 2 D <b>array</b> <b>configurations.</b> At the core of cueMAP is a Total Focusing Method (TFM) imaging algorithm that enables computer assisted design of ultrasonic inspection scenarios, including the design of bespoke <b>array</b> <b>configurations</b> to match the inspection criteria. This in-house developed TFM code allows for interactive evaluation of image quality indicators of ultrasonic imaging performance when utilizing a 2 D phased array working in FMC/TFM mode. The cueMAP software uses a series of TFM images to build a map of resolution, contrast and sensitivity of imaging performance of a simulated reflector, swept across the inspection volume. The software takes into account probe properties, wedge or water standoff, and effects of specimen curvature. In the validation process of this new software package, two 2 D arrays have been evaluated on 304 n stainless steel samples, typical of the primary circuit in nuclear plants. Thick section samples have been inspected using a 1 MHz 2 D matrix array. Due to the processing efficiency of the software, the data collected from these <b>array</b> <b>configurations</b> {{has been used to}} investigate the influence sub-aperture operation on inspection performance...|$|R
30|$|Recent {{years have}} seen great {{interest}} {{in the design of}} steerable broadband beamformers for microphone arrays [7 – 14]. Among the proposed design approaches, some are tailored to specific <b>array</b> <b>configurations,</b> such as differential microphone arrays [7] and spherical microphone arrays [8]. Comparatively, the Farrow-structure-based steerable broadband beamformers (FSBBs), also known as the polynomial beamformers [12], are particularly interesting in some applications, since they are applicable to arbitrary <b>array</b> <b>configurations,</b> and moreover, their passbands can be steered online with just one single parameter [10]. In practice, there usually exist some mismatches among microphones, such as gain and phase errors [15]. Unfortunately, the FSBBs are highly sensitive to microphone mismatches. Therefore, the design of FSBBs robust against microphone mismatches has drawn attention recently.|$|R
50|$|The HF radar CODAR SeaSonde and Helzel WERA {{are well}} {{established}} as {{a powerful tool for}} sea current measurements up to a range of 300 km. It operates in the HF and low VHF frequencies band corresponding to a radar wavelength in the range of 10 to 300m. The Doppler shift of the first order Bragg lines of the radar echo is used to derive sea current estimates in very {{much the same way as}} for the dual frequency microwave radar. Two radar installations are normally required, looking at the same patch of the sea surface from different angles. The latest generation of shore-based ocean radar can reach more than 200 km for ocean current mapping and more than 100 km for wave measurements Helzel WERA. For all ocean radars, the accuracy in range is excellent. With shorter ranges, the range resolution gets finer. The angular resolution and accuracy depends on the used antenna <b>array</b> <b>configuration</b> and applied algorithms (direction finding or beam forming). The WERA system provides the option to use both techniques; the compact version with direction finding or the array type antenna system with beam forming methods.|$|E
50|$|The {{introduction}} of the CCD revolutionized high-speed photography in the 1980s. The staring <b>array</b> <b>configuration</b> of the sensor eliminated the scanning artifacts. Precise control of the integration time replaced {{the use of the}} mechanical shutter. However, the CCD architecture limited the rate at which images could be read off the sensor. Most of these systems still ran at NTSC rates (approximately 60 frame/s), but some, especially those built by the Kodak Spin Physics group, ran faster and recorded onto specially constructed video tape cassettes. The Kodak MASD group developed the first HyG (rugged) high-speed digital color camera called the RO that replaced 16-mm crash sled film cameras. Many new innovations and recording methods were introduced in the RO and further enhancements were introduced in the HG2000, a camera that could run at 1000 frame/s with a 512 x 384 pixel sensor for 2 seconds. Kodak MASD group also introduced an ultra high-speed CCD camera called the HS4540 that was designed and manufactured by Photron in 1991 that recorded 4,500 frame/s at 256 x 256. The HS4540 was used extensively by companies manufacturing automotive air bags to do lot testing which required the fast record speed to image a 30 ms deployment. Roper Industries purchased this division from Kodak in November 1999 but no longer manufactures cameras.|$|E
