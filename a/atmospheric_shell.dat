40|$|Electromagnetic rays {{travel on}} curved paths under the {{influence}} of gravity. When a dispersive optical medium is included, these trajectories are frequency-dependent. In this work we consider the behaviour of rays when a spherically symmetric, luminous compact object described by the Schwarzschild metric is surrounded by an optically thin shell of plasma supported by radiation pressure. Such levitating atmospheres occupy a position of stable radial equilibrium, where radiative flux and gravitational effects are balanced. Using general relativity and an inhomogeneous plasma we find the existence of a stable circular orbit within the <b>atmospheric</b> <b>shell</b> for low-frequency rays. We explore families of bound orbits that exist between the shell and the compact object, and identify sets of novel periodic orbits. Finally, we examine conditions necessary for the trapping and escape of low-frequency radiation.

40|$|Atmospheric {{refraction}} bends optical {{beams and}} lets objects appear in positions they not really are. This phenomenon {{is very important}} in astronomy. However, astronomical refraction formulas can only be used if the light source is at a very far distance from the observer. Then, atmospheric refraction mainly depends on meteorological conditions on ground. In case of optical free-space communications, the distances are comparatively short and well-known formulas for astronomical refraction are no longer sufficient. An exact knowledge {{of the structure of the}} whole atmosphere is required to assess refraction in this case. Due to the complexity of the atmosphere, analytical solutions are not possible. Hence, a numerical simulation model based on spherical symmetry, <b>atmospheric</b> <b>shell</b> modeling and standard atmosphere models was used instead. Three different categories of refraction were examined: 1) the observer is situated on ground and the object is at an altitude of at least 25 km, 2) both object and observer are below 25 km and the link path is mainly vertical and 3) both object and observer are in the stratosphere and ray paths are mainly horizontal. The results presented in this work are useful for applications like laser beam pointing and satellite tracking, UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) and HAP (High Altitude Platform) downlinks or long-haul cross-links through the atmosphere, e. g. HAP-HAP or UAV-satellite...|$|E
30|$|Many {{problems}} {{in science and}} technology can be modeled by boundary value problems for singularly perturbed differential equations. Singularly perturbed problems arise for example in the modeling of fluid flow at high Reynolds numbers, water quality {{problems in}} river networks, convective heat transport problems with large Peclet numbers, drift diffusion equations of semiconductor device modeling, simulation of oil extraction from under-ground reservoirs, theory of plates and <b>shells,</b> <b>atmospheric</b> pollution, groundwater transport, and chemical reactor theory. For a detailed survey of different applications, we refer to [1]. Recently also singularly perturbed semilinear boundary value problems with discontinuous coefficients and nonlinear reaction-diffusion equations attracted some attention; see [2, 3] and the references therein. A vast majority of these problems cannot be solved analytically and therefore it is necessary to solve them approximately. In the modeling of the above processes, one can observe boundary and interior layers whose width can be arbitrarily small.|$|R
5000|$|The video {{accompanying}} the song (directed by Mike Lipscombe, produced by Michael J. Pierce) shows Faith encountering past phases {{of her life}} and unrequited love, moving from happy, carefree childhood, through adult betrayal to bitterness and the desire for emotional revenge, all taking place in the <b>atmospheric,</b> rain soaked <b>shell</b> of an old mansion surrounded by a neglected garden. As each scene comes to life, different parts of the dilapidated ruin return magically to their former glory - as if receiving a fresh lick of paint before our eyes. But with the renewed memories, Faith revisits the raw hurt of rejection. The video is notable for its use of driving rain and a brooding presence to evoke the tragic memories, giving rise to the [...] "wet look" [...] Faith, which is showcased in the album's promotional photography. The last iconic scene shows a rusty old Cadillac Eldorado, abandoned in the murky, overgrown garden coming back to life, as a 'childhood Faith' with her friend get in the back seat - but only 'semi-materialised', followed by the adult Faith, wearing a stylish, sleek, black dress getting in the drivers seat. The final shot shows her head slumping down on the steering wheel in despair, the past hurt still not resolved. It is one of Faith's most powerful performances, aided by a classy arrangement and has provoked a plethora of responses from people sharing their own moving experiences of rejection and betrayal.|$|R
