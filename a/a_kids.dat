25|$|The children's {{areas in}} Canada's Wonderland all began as The Happyland of Hanna-Barbera.

In 1993, the Smurf area transitioned to Kids Kingdom, which became Kidzville in 1998. In 2003, Bedrock became Nickelodeon Central; Bedrock Aquarium and its marine mammal show closed down as well.

Lindsay Williams of Gospel Music Channel said that [...] "Move may not be Third Day’s best effort in their large discography, but it’s certainly {{a treasure trove of}} hooky rock.

Whether it's better than Revelation or some of their other previous installments (like Wire or Conspiracy No. 5) is something to leave up to the listener to decide, but it does feel safe enough to say that Third Day's Move is a dozen tracks of southern rock goodness".
