This involves forming an augmented network state vector consisting of all unit activities and weights. This report notes some relationships between the EKF as applied to recurrent net learning and some simpler techniques that are more widely used. In particular, it is shown that making certain simplifications to the EKF gives rise to an algorithm essentially identical to the real-time recurrent learning (RTRL) algorithm. That is, the resulting algorithm both maintains the RTRL data structure and prescribes identical weight changes. In addition, because the EKF also involves <b>adjusting</b> <b>unit</b> activity in the network, it provides a principled generalization of the useful "teacher forcing" technique.

It is based on microdata of the Swiss household expenditure survey from 2000 to 2009, containing data from more than 34, 000 households. We applied a two-stage quadratic almost ideal demand system, correcting for the high share of zero consumption for some product categories at stage 2 and for endogeneity of the expenditure variable. Missing price data were received by <b>adjusting</b> <b>unit</b> values for quality as recently proposed by Aepli and Finger ([2013]) and Majumder et al. ([2012]). We tested the model specification with respect to household characteristics {{as well as the}} quadratic income term, which distinguishes the QUAIDS from the AIDS. Testing for the overall significance of the household characteristics and the quadratic income terms confirms the model specification. With respect to wine and beer, moderate and heavy drinking households are less price-sensitive than light drinking households are, while for spirits we did not find a difference among the three household segments.|$|E

In polymer blend systems, increasing LDPE content in PP resulted in an increase in the cooling rate accompanied by decreases in the T c, crystallisation time and degree of crystallinity.

In the current study, Single and Multi-objective optimizations were conducted for a compressor station comprising four similar compressor units driven by four similar gas turbines, four coolers {{of the same}} size and a pipeline section to the next station. This pipeline section is on the 2 th major gas transmission pipeline of the National Iranian Gas Company, NIGC, or IGAT 2 which is designed to move over 79 MMSCMD (2. 8 BCFD) of natural gas from the Assaluyeh Gas Refinery to the ports. Genetic, Particle Swarm and SQP Algorithms were used in this optimization along with detailed modeling of the performance characteristics of compressors, aerial coolers, and downstream pipeline section.

40|$|Purpose - The {{contribution}} {{of this study}} is both methodological and empirical. It provides a method of estimating preference consistent true cost of living indices and demonstrates the use of unit values (food items), adjusted for quality and demographic effects, as prices. Using NSS data, changes in living standards (measured by per capita real expenditure) in India are examined between 1999 / 2000 and 2009 / 2010. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach - From the <b>adjusted</b> <b>unit</b> values, "exact" price indices are computed using QAIDS-based preference consistent methods that allow between-item substitution effects and variation across states. Findings - A comparison of the nominal and price deflated real expenditures under alternative temporal price scenario during 1999 / 2000 - 2009 / 2010 shows that the states largely preserve their ranks over the periods, in spite of differential temporal price movement. However, comparison of the nominal and price-deflated real expenditure growth reveals that the rankings are sensitive to the price deflator used. Practical implications - The results question the wisdom of the treatment of large countries with heterogeneous preferences, e. g. India, as single entities in PPP calculations as in the ICP project. Hence, the results have methodological and empirical implications that extend beyond India. Originality/value - The study provides evidence on the issue of spatial difference in the temporal movement in prices, where no such evidence exists, and contains the first evidence on living standards in India in the post global financial crisis era. Also, this is the first attempt to base calculation of temporal movement in prices, as measured by the "exact" price indices, on the <b>adjusted</b> <b>unit</b> values of food items. 17 page(s...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2017 Production {{and use of}} {{bio-based}} products offer {{a number}} of advantages over conventional petrochemicals, yet the relatively high cost of production has restricted their mainstream adoption. Optimization of waste treatment processes could reduce capital expenditures, lowering the barrier to market entry for lignocellulosic biorefineries. This paper characterizes waste production from lignocellulosic ethanol production and analyzes potential wastewater treatment operations. It is found that organic material is intrinsic to bioconversion wastes, supplying up to 260 kilograms of biological oxygen demand per tonne of feedstock. Inorganic material, however, is largely added to waste streams throughout the bioconversion process {{as a result of}} pretreatment and pH adjustment operations which increase the inorganic loading by 44 kilograms per tonne of feedstock. <b>Adjusting</b> <b>unit</b> operations to limit addition of inorganic material can reduce the demands and therefore cost of waste treatment. Various waste treatment technologies – including those that take advantage of ecosystem services provided by feedstock production – are evaluated in terms of capital and operating costs, as well as technical feasibility. It is concluded that waste treatment technologies may be better integrated with conversion processes and even feedstock production. In general, there should be an effort to recycle resources throughout the bioenergy supply chain through application of ecosystem services provided by adjacent feedstock plantations and recovery of resources from the waste stream to reduce overall capital and operating costs of bioconversion facilities...|$|E

40|$|Water {{planners}} {{facing a}} choice between water “supply ” options (including conservation and other water management strategies such as operational changes, and conjunctive ground and surface water management) customarily use the average unit cost of each option as a decision criterion. This approach is misleading and potentially costly when comparing options with very different reliability characteristics. For example, surface water, desalinated seawater or recycled wastewater, and some outdoor demand management programs have very different yield patterns. This guidance document introduces planners to some methods adapted from financial portfolio theory. These methods allow planners to explicitly account for uncertainty in yield or water quality by calculating “constant-reliability-benefit unit costs ” or blending requirements to reliably achieve water quality objectives (e. g., 500 ppm of TDS 99. 5 % of the time). Explicitly accounting for these uncertainties via <b>adjusted</b> <b>unit</b> costs can significantly change the relative attractiveness of options. In particular, surface water, usually a low cost option, is more expensive after its variability has been accounted for. Further, options that are uncorrelated or inversely correlated with existing supply sources will be more attractiv...|$|R

40|$|Current {{research}} and development have been trending towards approaches based on simulation and virtual testing. Industrial development processes for complex products employ optimization methods to ensure results are close to reality, simultaneously minimizing required resources. The results of virtual testing are optimized in accordance with requirements using optimization techniques. Robust Design Optimization (RDO) is one established approach to optimization. RDO {{is based on the}} identification of an optimal parameter set which includes a small variance of the target value as a constraint. Under most circumstances, this approach does not involve separate optimization of the target value and target variance. However, the basic strategy of the optimization approach developed by Taguchi is to first optimize the parameter sets for the target value and then optimize and minimize the target variance. According to an application example, the benefit of Taguchi's approach (TM) is that it facilitates the identification of an optimal parameter set of nominal values for technical feasibility and possible manufacturing. If an optimal parameter set is determined, the variance can be minimized under consideration of process parameters. This paper examines and discusses the differences between and shared characteristics of the robust optimization methods TM and RDO, and discusses their shortcomings. In order to provide a better illustration, this paper explains and applies both methods using an <b>adjuster</b> <b>unit</b> of a commercial vehicle braking system.
