5|$|In June 1970, the Dubna {{team made}} {{improvements}} on their original experiment, providing a purer target <b>and</b> <b>reducing</b> <b>the</b> intensity of transfer reactions by installing a collimator before the catcher. This time, {{they were able}} to find 9.1MeV alpha activities with daughter isotopes identifiable as either 256103 or 257103; thus, the original isotope was either 260105 or 261105.|$|E
5|$|After {{the first}} two adaptations, both done by Clark, the tales were adapted {{by a number of}} playwrights and screenwriters. In most {{instances}} the adaptations alter the original source material. For example, A Warning to the Curious frequently deviates from its literary source. The screenplay avoids the convoluted plot structure of M. R. James's original, opting for a more linear construction <b>and</b> <b>reducing</b> <b>the</b> number of narrators. In addition the central character, Paxton, is changed from a young fair-haired innocent who stumbles across the treasure to a middle-aged character driven by poverty to seek the treasure and acting in full awareness of what he is doing.|$|E

5|$|Experiments {{showed the}} need for {{only a small number}} of design changes, mainly {{involving}} the wing profile and positioning. To improve high-alpha performance, the leading edge of the wing was drooped, especially on outer sections, a dog-tooth was introduced at about half-span to control spanwise flow, and the entire wing given a slight negative camber which helped control trim drag and pitch-up. The area rule principle, made public in 1952, was also applied to the design. This resulted in several changes including the addition of a tailcone, sharpening the radar nose profile, thinning the intake lips, <b>and</b> <b>reducing</b> <b>the</b> cross-sectional area of the fuselage below the canopy.|$|E
5|$|In {{recognition}} of the established and popular activity of mountain biking in the greater Adelaide area, and to better accommodate the mountain biking community in the north eastern suburbs, it was proposed in 2006 to permit cycling in designated zones on purpose-built tracks and on certain management tracks within the park. The intention is to satisfy both biodiversity and recreation objectives in the park <b>and</b> <b>reducing</b> <b>the</b> incidence of illegal mountain bike riding in other non designated areas.|$|E
5|$|Lead {{compounds}} {{are used}} as, or in, coloring agents, oxidants, plastic, candles, glass, and semiconductors. Lead-based coloring agents {{are used in}} ceramic glazes and glass, especially for red and yellow shades. Lead tetraacetate and lead dioxide are used as oxidizing agents in organic chemistry. Lead is frequently used in the polyvinyl chloride coating of electrical cords. It {{can be used to}} treat candle wicks to ensure a longer, more even burn. Because of its toxicity, European and North American manufacturers use alternatives such as zinc. Lead glass is composed of 12–28% lead oxide, changing its optical characteristics <b>and</b> <b>reducing</b> <b>the</b> transmission of ionizing radiation. Lead-based semiconductors such as lead telluride and lead selenide are used in photovoltaic cells and infrared detectors.|$|E

5|$|Many {{buildings}} did {{not hold}} up to the shaking of the earthquake and those that did collapse often lacked any survival space, but lack of effective medical care and poor planning {{also contributed to the}} substantial scope of the disaster. Buildings that didn't collapse featured well-maintained masonry and skeletal components that were joined together adequately in a way that allowed for the building to resist seismic waves. Most bridges and tunnels and other public infrastructure withstood the earthquake but hospitals did not fare well. Most collapsed, killing two-thirds of the doctors, destroying equipment and medicine, <b>and</b> <b>reducing</b> <b>the</b> capacity to handle the critical medical needs in the region.|$|E

5|$|On {{moving into}} , Thatcher {{introduced}} {{a series of}} political and economic initiatives intended to reverse high unemployment and Britain's struggles {{in the wake of the}} Winter of Discontent and an ongoing recession. Her political philosophy and economic policies emphasised deregulation (particularly of the financial sector), flexible labour markets, the privatisation of state-owned companies, <b>and</b> <b>reducing</b> <b>the</b> power and influence of trade unions. Thatcher's popularity during her first years in office waned amid recession and increasing unemployment, until victory in the 1982 Falklands War and the recovering economy brought a resurgence of support, resulting in her decisive re-election in 1983. She survived an assassination attempt in 1984.|$|E

His suggestions were approved in 1729, and 125troops were removed from Texas, leaving only 144soldiers divided between Los Adaes, La Bahía, and San Antonio. The three East Texas missions which had depended on Presidio de los Tejas were relocated along the San Antonio River in May 1731, {{increasing the number of}} missions in the San Antonio area to five. The San Antonio missions usually contained fewer than 300Indians. Many of those who lived at the mission had nowhere else to go, and belonged to small tribes that have since become extinct.|$|E
5|$|Romney {{opposed the}} use of {{mandatory}} limits on greenhouse gas emissions to deal with global warming. He stated that he believed climate change is occurring, but {{that he did not}} know how much of it could be linked to human activity. He was a proponent of increased domestic oil drilling, hydraulic fracturing ("fracking"), building more nuclear power plants, <b>and</b> <b>reducing</b> <b>the</b> regulatory authority of the Environmental Protection Agency. He believed North American energy independence could be achieved by 2020.|$|E
5|$|Sometimes {{trees are}} also girdled {{to act as}} trap trees to monitor for emerald ash borer. The {{stressed}} tree attracts egg-laying females {{in the spring and}} trees can be debarked in the fall to search for larvae. If detected, an area is often placed under a quarantine to prevent infested wood material from causing new infestations. Further control measures are then taken within the area to slow population growth by reducing beetle numbers, preventing them from reaching reproductive maturity and dispersing, <b>and</b> <b>reducing</b> <b>the</b> abundance of ash trees.|$|E

5|$|Temnothorax unifasciatus, a myrmicinid ant, {{has been}} shown not to have {{collective}} worker policing. However, when a queen is removed, a rank order for reproduction appears, where top ranking reproductives display aggression towards lower-order female workers. Thus, reductions in egg laying are created by dominance hierarchies. Individuals do not act in benefit of the colony, instead opting to increase their own fitness by laying their eggs <b>and</b> <b>reducing</b> <b>the</b> contributions of opponents.|$|E
5|$|The {{demobilisation}} of the Australian military after World War II involved discharging almost 600,000 men {{and women}} from the military, supporting their transition to civilian life <b>and</b> <b>reducing</b> <b>the</b> three armed services to peacetime strengths. Planning for the demobilisation process began in 1942 and thousands of service{{men and women}} were discharged {{in the last years of}} the war in response to shortages of labour in the domestic war economy. The general demobilisation of the military began in October 1945 and was completed in February 1947. The demobilisation process was largely successful, though some military personnel stationed in the South West Pacific complained that their repatriation to Australia was too slow.|$|E

5|$|The {{secretory}} {{phase is}} {{the final phase of}} the uterine cycle and it corresponds to the luteal phase of the ovarian cycle. During the secretory phase, the corpus luteum produces progesterone, which plays a vital role in making the endometrium receptive to implantation of the blastocyst and supportive of the early pregnancy, by increasing blood flow and uterine secretions <b>and</b> <b>reducing</b> <b>the</b> contractility of the smooth muscle in the uterus; it also has the side effect of raising the woman's basal body temperature.|$|E
5|$|The {{trend towards}} more {{intensive}} farming {{began to be}} partially reversed {{by the end of}} the century as more environmentally friendly practices were encouraged by government and European Union grants. For example, Richard Zawadzki, owner of Balfour Mains (the largest farm on the island), ceased to breed livestock (instead keeping animals bred elsewhere) and grew less grain (some barley is still grown on the farm). Instead, some of the land is now managed under a Habitat Creation Scheme, which aims to encourage natural vegetation, wild flowers and nesting birds by limiting grazing <b>and</b> <b>reducing</b> <b>the</b> use of chemical fertilisers.|$|E
5|$|As a senator, McGovern was an {{exemplar of}} modern American liberalism. He became most {{known for his}} outspoken {{opposition}} to the growing U.S.involvement in the Vietnam War. He staged a brief nomination run in the 1968 presidential election as a stand-in for the assassinated Robert F. Kennedy. The subsequent McGovern–Fraser Commission fundamentally altered the presidential nominating process, by greatly {{increasing the number of}} caucuses and primaries <b>and</b> <b>reducing</b> <b>the</b> influence of party insiders. The McGovern–Hatfield Amendment sought to end the Vietnam War by legislative means but was defeated in 1970 and 1971. McGovern's long-shot, grassroots-based 1972 presidential campaign found triumph in gaining the Democratic nomination but left the party badly split ideologically, and the failed vice-presidential pick of Thomas Eagleton undermined McGovern's credibility. In the general election McGovern lost to incumbent Richard Nixon in one of the biggest landslides in American electoral history. Re-elected Senator in 1968 and 1974, McGovern was defeated in a bid for a fourth term in 1980.|$|E
