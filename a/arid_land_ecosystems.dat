50|$|The {{overall goal}} of {{research}} at Gobabeb {{is to improve the}} understanding of <b>arid</b> <b>land</b> <b>ecosystems,</b> particularly their variability, with a focus on supporting well-trained specialists and decision-makers in southern Africa and the world. Gobabeb has been the locus of much of the basic research on Namib desert organisms and, more broadly, into the ecology of southern African deserts and arid land. Every year over 100 scientists visit Gobabeb to undertake research and in the past 50 years, over 1900 publications has been produced at Gobabeb. As a result of such research, the worldwide knowledge about animals and plants coping with the extreme conditions of the desert has vastly improved.|$|E
40|$|Soil {{bacteria}} are important contributors to primary productivity and nutrient cycling in <b>arid</b> <b>land</b> <b>ecosystems,</b> and their populations may be greatly affected {{by changes in}} environmental conditions. In parallel studies, {{the composition of the}} total bacterial community and of members of the Acidobacterium division were assessed in arid grassland soils using terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (TRF, also known as T-RFLP) analysis of 16 S rRNA genes amplified from soil DNA. Bacterial communities associated with the rhizospheres of the native bunchgrasses Stipa hymenoides and Hilaria jamesii, the invading annual grass Bromus tectorum, and the interspaces colonized by cyanobacterial soil crusts were compared at three depths. When used in a replicated field-scale study, TRF analysis was useful for identifying broad-scale, consistent differences in the bacterial communities in different soil locations, over the natural microscale heterogeneity of the soil. The compositions of the total bacterial community and Acidobacterium division in the soil crust interspaces were significantly {{different from those of the}} plant rhizospheres. Major differences were also observed in the rhizospheres of the three plant species and were most apparent with analysis of the Acidobacterium division. The total bacterial community and the Acidobacterium division bacteria were affected by soil depth in both the interspaces and plant rhizospheres. This study provides a baseline for monitoring bacterial community structure and dynamics with changes in plant cover and environmental conditions in the arid grasslands...|$|E

To get the full text please contact the other at Abusuwar @ yahoo. comThe effectiveness of land imprintation in interseeding <b>arid</b> <b>land</b> <b>ecosystem</b> with perennial grasses and legumes was studied at two different elevations (Oracle at 1125 m and Tucson at 710 m) in southern Arizona. Three plant cover treatments, including grasses only, legumes only and a grass-legume mix, combined with four surface treatments (imprinted, mulched, imprinted-mulched, and an untreated surface), were imposed at both sandy-loam sites. The Oracle site received natural rainfall only, whereas the dry Tucson site received supplemental irrigation in addition to rainfall in amounts equal to the rainfall differences. Imprintation increased soil moisture over the untreated surface by 33 % at Oracle and by 54 % at Tucson. At Oracle, grass seedling emergence was increased by 126 % over the untreated surface and by 87 % over the mulch treatment; while legume emergence was increased by 800 % and 367 %. Imprinting increased grass emergence of the grass-legume mix by 295 % over the untreated surface, and by 190 % over the mulch treatment, while legume emergence was increased 123 % over the untreated surface and 109 % over the mulch treatment. Imprinting produced similar increases in grass and legume emergence at the lower elevation. Interseeding of grass and legume species was greatly enhanced by the imprintation technique in the arid region of south western United States...|$|R

El-Hassan Bin-Talal faculty of <b>arid</b> <b>land</b> studies came to enhance the agricultural investments in the <b>arid</b> <b>land</b> of Jordan, which consist about 80% of Jordan area, so it can face the rapid demand of food productions due to rapid population growth.

The mission of the El-Hassan Bin-Talal faculty of <b>arid</b> <b>land</b> studies is to provide spearheading solutions for unbalance use for the natural resources and environment by developing interactive educational and research programs. These decisive results to be use in mitigate the climate change effect, natural resource degradation, and depleted water resources and increase the <b>arid</b> <b>land</b> productivity in Jordan. Furthermore, El-Hassan Bin-Talal faculty of <b>arid</b> <b>land</b> studies tactics to be internationally resource for sustainable development of <b>arid</b> <b>lands</b> by collaborating with other international institutions and attracting scientists and students from across the world. El-Hassan Bin-Talal faculty of <b>arid</b> <b>land</b> studies vision is establishing an exceptional education curriculum that grants bachelor degrees in the <b>arid</b> <b>lands</b> studies including range-livestock science and management, natural resources and the environment, economic development, policy analysis, and rural sociology. El-Hassan Bin-Talal faculty of <b>arid</b> <b>land</b> studies objectives are to impart knowledge from the scientist from Arab countries and {{the world on the}} sustainable development of <b>arid</b> <b>lands,</b> and to generate an entrepreneurial approach in solving the problems of over-use and misuse of natural resources in <b>arid</b> <b>land</b> by involving local communities, which will involve them in decision-making and open new opportunities for employment.|$|R

40|$|No {{studies have}} proven the {{existence}} of soil assemblages typical of <b>arid</b> <b>lands</b> in Europe. This study {{was carried out in}} a representative territory of the southeastern part of the Iberian Peninsula, Almería province, which is the driest part of Europe, to determine if soils characteristic of <b>arid</b> <b>lands</b> are present. In order to analyse the spatial distribution of soils, the authors made use of mathematical tools previously developed in biodiversity and pedodiversity analysis, such as richness, entropy indices, abundance distribution models, diversity-area relationships and nested subset analysis. The study demonstrates that the soil types or pedotaxa are typical of mountainous <b>arid</b> <b>lands.</b> Shallow and weakly developed soils (e. g. Leptosols, Regosols and Arenosols), Calcisols, Gypsisols and Solonchaks, cover most of the study area, and pedodiversity analysis demonstrates that the pedotaxa spatial patterns follow the same regularities as in other areas, environments and scales.
