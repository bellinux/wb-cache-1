40|$|The {{opportunity}} to maintain continuity of supply using dispersed generation when the network becomes disjointed and the grid connection is lost, is becoming realisable given the increasing penetration of these units in distribution networks. A rule-based system is presented which provides the necessary switching between the control strategies required for operation {{in parallel with}} the grid and when islanded. It consists of an expert system technique for selecting {{the control of the}} generator's excitation system and the <b>automatic</b> <b>governor</b> <b>control</b> system. The control strategy is such that when operating in parallel with the grid, the excitation and governor systems are operated to control the power factor and to regulate active power generation. In islanded operation these systems are operated to regulate the voltage and frequency of the islanded network. An advantage of this system {{is that it does not}} use communications to determine which control strategy is appropriate and instead relies on local measurements. Simulation studies are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the adaptive control system under a variety of operating condition...|$|E
40|$|Fluctuating {{wind power}} {{is due to}} wind {{turbulence}} and is the part which should be filtered out leaving behind the more predictable mean wind power which can be traded in the hourly energy market. The power fluctuations cause the frequency of electric utility to deviate from the 60 Hz standard. This thesis is concerned with estimating the maximum fluctuating wind power before the 1 % deviation from the 60 Hz standard (required by some utilities) is exceeded. To keep the thesis manageable, the scope is narrowed to thermal power plants with governor speed control but no <b>Automatic</b> <b>Governor</b> <b>Control</b> (AGC). This thesis shows that each governor speed control system provides energy storage buffer to attenuate the wind power fluctuations and arrives at the estimate that the fluctuating wind power penetration is conservatively around 5 % of the generation capacity of the utility grid. The methodologies used to reach this estimate are: (i) Transfer Function analysis of power plants; (ii) digital simulations using HYPERSIM. Through the research, an innovative method of predicting the frequency deviation in an electric grid with multiple power plants has been developed and validated by simulation. The thesis also shows that fluctuating wind power penetration can be higher when there are filtering also in the wind farms. Wind turbines, with small inertias, driving constant speed squirrel cage induction generators are found to provide poor filtering. On the other hand, the fluctuating wind power penetration limit is increased to 18 % {{in the case of}} wind turbines, with large inertias, driving variable-speed doubly-fed induction generators (DFIG) with decoupled P-Q control to implement optimal wind power acquisition...|$|E

30|$|Primary {{frequency}} <b>control</b> is an <b>automatic</b> <b>governor</b> {{response in}} proportion to the frequency deviation from the scheduled value. This response, also called frequency responsive reserve, is typically provided by a conventional generator with <b>governor</b> droop <b>control</b> to regulate its power output as a function of frequency deviation and droop setting [50, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68]. A WTG’s primary frequency regulation resembles that of a conventional generator, which is usually activated within a few tens of seconds and sustained for up to 15 min once the grid frequency deviation exceeds the allowable threshold [67]. It {{plays an important role in}} mitigating the steady-state frequency deviation after inertial response until the secondary frequency control (automatic generation control, AGC) takes over to achieve zero frequency error in the steady-state condition.|$|R

50|$|Fitchburg were notable in also {{supplying}} an <b>automatic</b> <b>governor</b> (illus., left-hand flywheel) {{that controlled}} the valve's cut-off according to load. Such governors would become significant around 1900 {{with the development}} of the high-speed engine, where they were used to control speed precisely. In these earlier medium-speed engines, the function of these governors was not just to control the engine's speed, but also to improve efficiency. The Fitchburg piston valves could be operated with a cut-off from zero to two-thirds of the stroke. A larger cut-off improves efficiency when operating under light loads. Earlier engines had used devices such as expansion valves to achieve this, but they also required the continued attention of a skilled driver, who could 'drive' the engine by varying the cut-off as load changed. The earlier Watt <b>governors</b> only <b>controlled</b> a throttle valve, so although they controlled an engine's speed, they did not encourage efficiency. An engine operating with no cut-off but a throttled steam supply will be operating inefficiently, owing to reduced expansive working and the risk of wire-drawing. The first 'automatic' governors were termed that because they not only controlled the speed, but could also take over the role of the driver and could vary cut-off too.|$|R

Furthermore, the nonlinear L 2 -gain disturbance attenuation control strategy is achieved for speed <b>governor</b> <b>control</b> of turbo-generators without requiring the solution of an HJI inequality. With multi-machine power system control, all the variables in the control law are only relevant to the state variables of the local generator, thus a decentralized control strategy is achieved. Simulation results of a 4 -machine system show that the controller can enhance power transient stability and dynamic performance. ...|$|R

40|$|A novel {{nonlinear}} decentralized robust <b>governor</b> <b>control</b> for hydroturbine-generator sets in multi-machine {{power systems}} is suggested in this paper. The nonelastic water hammer effect and disturbances are {{considered in the}} modeling. The advanced differential geometry theory, nonlinear robust control theory and the dynamic feedback method are combined to solve the problem. The nonlinear decentralized robust control law for the speed governor of hydroturbine-generators has been derived. The input signals to the proposed controller are all local measurements and independent to the system parameters. The derived control law guarantees the integrated system stability with disturbance attenuation, which is significant to the real power system application. Computer tests on an 8 -machine, 36 -bus power system show clearly {{the effectiveness of the}} new control strategy in transient stability enhancement and disturbance attenuation. The computer test results based on the suggested controller are compared favorably with those based on the conventional linear <b>governor</b> <b>control.</b> © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.
