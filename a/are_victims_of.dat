5|$|All birds lay amniotic {{eggs with}} hard shells made mostly of calcium carbonate. Hole and burrow nesting species tend to lay white or pale eggs, while open nesters lay camouflaged eggs. There are many {{exceptions}} to this pattern, however; the ground-nesting nightjars have pale eggs, and camouflage is instead provided by their plumage. Species that <b>are</b> <b>victims</b> <b>of</b> brood parasites have varying egg colours to improve the chances of spotting a parasite's egg, which forces female parasites to match their eggs to those of their hosts.|$|E
5|$|Hibakusha {{and their}} {{children}} were (and still <b>are)</b> <b>victims</b> <b>of</b> severe discrimination in Japan due to public ignorance {{about the consequences of}} radiation sickness, with much of the public believing it to be hereditary or even contagious. This is despite the fact that no statistically demonstrable increase of birth defects or congenital malformations was found among the later conceived children born to survivors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. A study of the long-term psychological effects of the bombings on the survivors found that even 17–20 years after the bombings had occurred survivors showed a higher prevalence of anxiety and somatization symptoms.|$|E

40|$|In 2008, U.

Approximately three quarters of them had no history of prior victimization. • Seventy-one {{percent of the children}} <b>were</b> classified as <b>victims</b> <b>of</b> child neglect; 16 percent as <b>victims</b> <b>of</b> physical abuse; 9 percent as <b>victims</b> <b>of</b> sexual abuse; and 7 percent as <b>victims</b> <b>of</b> emotional abuse. • A non-CPS study estimated that 1 in 5 U. S. children experience some form of child maltreatment: approximately 1 percent <b>were</b> <b>victims</b> <b>of</b> sexual assault; 4 percent <b>were</b> <b>victims</b> <b>of</b> child neglect; 9 percent <b>were</b> <b>victims</b> <b>of</b> physical abuse; and 12 percent <b>were</b> <b>victims</b> <b>of</b> emotional abuse. 2 Note: A child is counted each time she or he is a subject of a report, which means a child may be counted more than once as a <b>victim</b> <b>of</b> child maltreatment...|$|R
40|$|Currently, {{the best}} {{estimate}} of the incidence and prevalence of rape {{is provided by the}} National Violence Against Women study, published in 2000 and sponsored by the National Institute of Justice and the Centers for Disease Control 1. This study employed a sampling strategy that closely matched national demographics and found the following: • 14. 8 % <b>of</b> women <b>were</b> <b>victims</b> <b>of</b> rape at some point during their lifetime • 2. 8 % <b>of</b> women <b>were</b> <b>victims</b> <b>of</b> attempted rape at some point during their lifetime • 0. 3 % <b>of</b> women <b>were</b> <b>victims</b> <b>of</b> rape during the previous 12 months, yielding an 8. 7 per 1000 “incidence rate” Extrapolating this incidence rate to the population of Metro Boston reveals the stark disparity between “official ” rape statistics and the reality of sexual violence. In 1998, there were 1, 687 rapes reported in all of Massachusetts, and 526 arrests were made 17. That same year, among the approximately 1. 75 million women in the Boston Metro area, there were actually 15, 225 rapes. The NIJ study findings described above closely match those of the Rape in America study 2, published in 1992, which found: • 13. 0 % <b>of</b> women <b>were</b> <b>victims</b> <b>of</b> rape at some point during their lifetime • 0. 7 % <b>of</b> women <b>were</b> <b>victims</b> <b>of</b> rape during the previous 12 months Two other prevalence studies have documented even higher victimization rates, probably due to the unique characteristics of their samples. A study of naval recruits published in 19993 found: • 36. 1 % <b>of</b> female recruits <b>were</b> <b>victims</b> <b>of</b> rape since the age of 14 • 9. 4 % <b>of</b> female recruits <b>were</b> <b>victims</b> <b>of</b> attempted rape since the age of 14 A study of a national sample of college students, published in 19874, found: • 15. 4 % <b>of</b> women <b>were</b> <b>victims</b> <b>of</b> rape since the age of 14 • 12. 1 % <b>of</b> women <b>were</b> <b>victims</b> <b>of</b> attempted rape since the age of 1...|$|R
5|$|Slow lorises are {{threatened}} by deforestation and the wildlife trade, which includes the exotic pet trade, traditional medicine, and bushmeat. Other threats includes road construction, selective logging, and slash and burn agriculture. Habitat fragmentation obstructs biological dispersal for these species that rely on vines and lianas to move from tree to tree. Consequently, slow lorises are found dead on power lines or <b>are</b> <b>victims</b> <b>of</b> roadkill in areas where roads cut between forest patches.|$|E
5|$|Procellariids are {{vulnerable}} to other threats as well. Ingestion of plastic flotsam {{is a problem for}} the family as it is for many other seabirds. Once swallowed, this plastic can cause a general decline in the fitness of the bird, or in some cases lodge in the gut and cause a blockage, leading to death by starvation. Procellariids are also vulnerable to general marine pollution, as well as oil spills. Some species, such as the Barau's petrel, the Newell's shearwater or the Cory's shearwater, which nest high up on large developed islands <b>are</b> <b>victims</b> <b>of</b> light pollution. Chicks that are fledging are attracted to streetlights and are unable to reach the sea. An estimated 20–40% of fledging Barau's petrels are attracted to the streetlights on Réunion.|$|E

Arrow D.I.T claims that twenty-three percent of 9-16 year olds in Ireland have been bullied on-line or of-line, compared to nineteen percent in Europe. Although, on-line bullying in Ireland at 4% according to Arrow D.I.T is lower than the European average which stands at 6%, and half that of the UK where 8% reported being cyberbullied. As a result, traditional forms of bullying in Ireland is higher than their European counterparts, but lower when it comes to cyberbullying.|$|R
