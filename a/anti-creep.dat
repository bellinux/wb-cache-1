5000|$|But 1950 saw the “Next Look in Cars" [...] — Studebaker’s {{answer to}} the other {{manufacturers}} 1949 models. Considered very radical for the era, it had 3-point front styling (called the “bullet-nose” by some). Over 10,000 more Land Cruisers were sold in 1950 than in 1949. Studebaker Automatic Drive was introduced mid-year and was arguably the most advanced automatic transmission of the day. It featured reverse gear lock-out, hill-holder, <b>anti-creep</b> and a locking torque converter which allowed direct drive with virtually no converter power loss in high gear. The price of the 1950 Land Cruiser went down to $2187.|$|E
30|$|The {{final value}} of creep {{can be used}} as {{criteria}} of the <b>anti-creep</b> properties. From Fig.  4, it showed that the final creep of A 1 was lowest, and that of A 2 was highest. From Fig.  5, {{it can be seen that}} the final creep of B 1 was lowest, and that of B 3 was highest. In general, the final creep of outer layer was lowest, whether type A or type B, which showed creep resistance of outer layer was best.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. General {{kinematics}} simulation is {{only for}} regular mechanism about turning in fix axis, shifting on plane {{as well as their}} compound motions. However, there is no mature technique supporting kinematic simulation for those mechanisms depending on clearance operation such as lorry couplers. Considering such irregularly mechanism, authors proposed a method based on collision kinematics simulation, and combining structure analysis as well as virtual assembly in Pro/Engineer. According to methods above, authors implemented three postures of coupler operation kinematics simulation, as well as the reliability avaluation for <b>anti-creep</b> of coupler function. This method supplies a practical solution for irregular machine kinematics simulation...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{chemical}} modification on mechano-sorptive creep in bending was studied by experimental work. Stakes with 20 × 20 × 400 mm RTL of Portuguese wood species (Pinus pinaster Aiton) modified with 1, 3 -dimethylol- 4, 5 -dihydroxyethyleneurea (DMDHEU), m-methylated melamine resin (MMF), tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) and amid wax (WA) were measured under asymmetric moistening conditions {{over a period}} of 42 days (app. 1000 hours) with stress level (SL) of 12 MPa, according to ENV 1156. The cell wall treatments (DMDHEU and MMF resins) had shown significant reduction of creep (creep factors, kc) when compared to untreated wood under similar conditions. Both types of resins and levels of treatments (different WPG) did not shown significant effects. In the lumen fill treatments, deposit material of TEOS did not affected the creep behaviour (kc); Wax treatment was shown a particular compliance of creep due to avoid exchange moisture (by the hydrophobic effect of wax). The <b>anti-creep</b> efficiency (ACE) correlated better than other mechanical or physical properties imparted by the modification process. Przemysław Szmi...|$|E
