5|$|By early afternoon, the {{low-pressure}} {{area had}} moved east into Nebraska, while the warm front had moved northward into southern Minnesota. The atmosphere {{to the south}} of the warm front was strongly capped, meaning that the best chance of thunderstorm development was in areas <b>along</b> <b>and</b> slightly north of the front. By the time the thunderstorms started developing, CAPE values were 2000J/kg, indicating moderate atmospheric instability. Also present were low-level and deep-layer wind shear values of , respectively. All of these factors combined to create very favorable conditions for the development of severe thunderstorms and tornadoes.|$|E
5|$|Chris tells Ann {{that after}} Indianapolis, {{he will be}} sent to a {{different}} city. The two agree they need to talk about the future of their relationship.

Price told Kilkelly (Digital Spy) his {{character}} panics and becomes annoyed. Nick is arrogant to his actions and believes David will just forgive him because they are related. He then tells David that they should discuss the affair with Kylie and move on. Price explained that David is worried that Kylie will feel betrayed he knew all <b>along</b> <b>and</b> does not want her to leave him. He decides he must stop Nick and grabs {{the steering wheel and}} causes a car crash. Price believed David was not trying to murder Nick, just prevent him from contacting Kylie.|$|E

5|$|Doctor Ox, {{catching}} him alone, reveals Georges's true parentage, and persuades him {{to drink}} a magic potion {{that allows him to}} go beyond the limits of the probable and journey through the impossible. Eva, realizing what has happened, takes the potion and drinks some as well, so as not to desert Georges. A family friend, the dancing master Tartelet (from The School for Robinsons), is seduced by the opportunity to travel and drinks his own share of the potion before anyone can stop him. Ox sets off with all three travelers, while Volsius makes secret plans to come <b>along</b> <b>and</b> protect Georges from Ox's influence. Along the way, another Dane, Axel Valdemar, also gets mixed up into the journey and becomes a friend of Tartelet.|$|E
5|$|From {{late morning}} to early afternoon, another squall line moved through {{northern}} parts of Mississippi and Alabama as high wind shear and low-level moisture persisted.

5|$|In 2001, the DelDOT {{conducted}} a feasibility study {{for a future}} north–south limited access highway in Sussex County. The Sussex County North–South Transportation Study explored routes <b>along</b> <b>and</b> between the US13, US113, and DE1 corridors. The study took into account local, long distance, and seasonal traffic patterns; environmental, agricultural, and developmental impacts; connections with arterial highways; {{and the ability to}} build the limited-access highway in usable sections. The study recommended routing the limited-access highway along the US113 corridor, using as much of the current US113 route as possible. For its standing US113 North/South Study, DelDOT has split the corridor into four areas: Millsboro–South, Georgetown, Ellendale, and Milford.|$|E
5|$|It is {{reported}} that this {{problem with the}} CL contributed to the bankruptcy of the cable company in 1888. However, electric motor traction had been considered all <b>along,</b> <b>and</b> much engineering progress had been made since the tunnel's construction had begun in 1886. So, CL chairman Charles Grey Mott decided to switch to electric traction. Other cable-operated systems using the Hallidie patents continued to be designed, such as the Glasgow Subway which opened in 1896.|$|E

5|$|Like spot welding, {{seam welding}} relies on two {{electrodes}} to apply pressure and current to join metal sheets. However, instead of pointed electrodes, wheel-shaped electrodes roll <b>along</b> <b>and</b> often feed the workpiece, {{making it possible}} to make long continuous welds. In the past, this process was used in the manufacture of beverage cans, but now its uses are more limited. Other resistance welding methods include butt welding, flash welding, projection welding, and upset welding.|$|E

5|$|Some {{research}} suggests that G-spot and clitoral orgasms are of the same origin. Masters and Johnson {{were the first to}} determine that the clitoral structures surround and extend <b>along</b> <b>and</b> within the labia. Upon studying women's sexual response cycle to different stimulation, they observed that both clitoral and vaginal orgasms had the same stages of physical response, and found that the majority of their subjects could only achieve clitoral orgasms, while a minority achieved vaginal orgasms. On this basis, Masters and Johnson argued that clitoral stimulation is the source of both kinds of orgasms, reasoning that the clitoris is stimulated during penetration by friction against its hood.|$|E
