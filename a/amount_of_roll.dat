The main principles of this testing are described in the standard GOST 30415 - 96 “The steel. The NDT of mechanical properties and microstructure of steel articles by magnetic technique”. The method is widely applied so it is completely presented in special literature. The present work describes the method application in iron and steel industry, particularly in a roll state testing. The following tasks are fulfilled by means of testing of structural stressed state of a roll barrel surface layers: 1. Accomplishment of incoming control of a roll structural stressed state before its service life starting. Incoming control makes it possible to reveal a roll residual stress caused by a supplier’s methodical violations. 2. Diagnosis of abnormal areas in a roll barrel working layer which appeared due to the roll damage in the run of operation. 3. Determination of the optimal depth of re-grinding which guarantees removal of layers with intolerable level of accumulated residual stress. Calculation of residual resource of each roll that allows to define optimal <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>roll</b> inventory. Diagnostics of preparation and installation defects of rolls in the rolling mill stands. Optimal stress redistribution in multi-stand mills.

40|$|Abstract: In the tandem groove rolling process, when {{a certain}} amount of wear on the work roll exists and the roll speed is not changed, the roll gap, i. e. the section height, should be {{adjusted}} to keep a mass balance between stands, i. e. multiply the exit cross-sectional area by the roll speed between stands. To investigate the actual relationship between the amount of wear on the work roll and the subsequent exit cross-sectional area variation, the authors designed wear contours and machined them on the original roll groove, i. e. on the roll groove with no wear. They then performed a pilot hot rolling test using a work roll with a worn-down groove and one with a groove with no wear, and measured the exit cross-sectional area of the workpiece while the roll gap changed. To predict the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>roll</b> gap adjustment that compensates wear, a model for roll gap adjustment is proposed. In the proposed model, the authors introduced the concept of equiva-lent roll gap adjustment, which reduces the increased exit cross-sectional area owing to wear up to a base exit cross-sectional area of the workpiece. Results reveal that the exit cross-sectional area calculated by the roll gap adjustment model is in good agreement with the exit cross-sectional area measured. It has been found from the pilot hot rolling test that variation in exit cross-sectional area is almost linearly proportional to roll gap change while the roll gap decreases from a datum roll gap to about half of the datum one...|$|E
40|$|An observing {{program on}} the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) is {{described}} in terms of exposures that are obtained by {{one or more of the}} instruments onboard the HST. Many requested exposures might specify orientation requirements and accompanying ranges. Orientation refers to the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>roll</b> (in degrees) about the line of sight. The range give the permissible tolerance (also in degrees). These requirements may be (1) absolute (in relation to the celestial coordinate system), (2) relative to the nominal roll angle for HST during that exposure, or (3) relative (in relation to other exposures in the observing program). The TRANSformation expert system converts proposals for astronomical observations with HST into detailed observing plans. Part of the conversion involves grouping exposures into higher level structures based on exposure characteristics. Exposures constrained to be at different orientations cannot be grouped together. Because relative orientation requirements cause implicit constraints, orientation constraints have to be propagated. TRANS must also identify any inconsistencies that may exist so they can be corrected. We have designed and implemented an orientation constraint propagator as part of TRANS. The propagator is based on an informal algebra that facilitates the setting up and propagation of the orientation constraints. The constraint propagator generates constraints between directly related exposures, and propagates derived constraints between exposures that are related indirectly. It provides facilities for path-consistency checking, identification of unsatisfiable constraints, and querying of orientation relationships. The system has been successfully operational as part of TRANS for over seven months. The solution has particular significance to space applications in which satellite/telescope pointing and attitude are constrained and relationships exist between multiple configurations...|$|E
40|$|The blanking/trimming/cropping process {{introduces}} a substantial plastic deformation to the sheet metal and causes premature edge fracture during the subsequent forming process. In {{an attempt to}} understand how the blanking process affects edge fracture, an experimental and numerical study was undertaken on the plane-strain blanking process. Blanking tests on a DP 780 steel sheet were carried out on a special fixture utilizing a in-situ microscope for the digital mage correlation (DIC) deformation measurement. The DIC method provides a detailed deformation field of the specimen that has not been reported in any other publications before. Interrupted tests were carried out to study the crack formation and propagation during the blanking procedure, while scanning electron microscope was applied to examine the blanked surface quality as well as the edge profile after test. Following the experimental study, a detailed finite element model with mesh size of 0. 01 mm in the critical region was established for the numerical investigation. The model features (a) a non-associated Hill 48 flow rule, (b) von-Mises yield condition and (c) modified Mohr–Coulomb fracture model. With material parameters calibrated from the in-plane tests as well as accurate boundary conditions measured in actual tests, the finite element model accurately predicted the blanking process quantitatively.

40|$|This Master’s Thesis {{consists}} of two separate and independent studies: One metallurgical study and one industrial buying behaviour study. Both studies concern continuous casting rolls. Metallurgical Study: The first objective {{of this study was}} to investigate two continuous casting <b>rolls,</b> consisting <b>of</b> different steel tubes with different martensitic stainless steel weld overlays. The second objective was to evaluate the methods employed in the study. The weld overlaps are clearly the weakest points of the weld overlay. They are sensitive to corrosion attacks, mainly due to sensitisation. The delta ferrite present in the welded overlay <b>of</b> both <b>rolls</b> is a preferential site for the corrosion attacks and the delta ferrite content depends primarily on the chemical composition of the weld overlay. The welding temperature may also have some influence on the delta ferrite content, but this has not been observed in this study. Both rolls have similar surface hardness. Roll no. 2 has more generalized corrosion attacks than roll no. 1. This is due to a higher delta ferrite content in roll no. 2 than in roll no. 1. The methods employed during the study proved to be adequate. In any future study, on condition that the visual inspection, diameter measurements, ultrasonic testing and surface hardness measurements show that all positions on the roll are similar, it will be sufficient to cut a bead and overlap sample from only one position. The rolls were investigated using macro etching, optical microscopy, Vickers hardness testing, ultrasonic testing ICP-OES analysis of nickel and chromium content and carbon content analysis by wet chemical method. Delta ferrite content was also calculated theoretically using a Schaeffler – DeLong diagram and a semi-empirical model. Industrial Buying Behaviour Study: The aim of this study is to investigate the industrial buying behaviour in slab casting steelworks in Western Europe when buying roll-lines. Case studies have been conducted at four steelworks belonging to different companies. Data was collected through personal interviews with people from production, maintenance and purchasing department and intermediate level management. A test consisting <b>of</b> a smaller <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>rolls</b> is always performed before buying any larger quantities <b>of</b> <b>rolls.</b> Even though the test order has relatively low economic value, compared to a full-scale order, it is during this process that the relationships are established between the buying and the selling company. Findings show that the industrial buying behaviour of steelworks in Western Europe agrees well with the theory in this field. The buying process follows the steps in the buygrid model with only a few exceptions. The decision-making power lays in the intermediate level management, even though approval is required from upper level management. The most important factors affecting the buying behaviour are the relationship between the buyer and the seller, service-life and life cycle cost of the roll-line. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|R

40|$|The {{subject of}} the study is the {{high-carbon}} tool cast steel G 200 CrMoNi 4 - 3 - 3 used for metallurgical rolls, especially in section rolling mills. The test material was derived from a roll damaged in production; therefore, the authors had the material in a raw state at their disposal, on which they were able to carry out additional heat treatment operations. The pearlitic matrix of casting steel G 200 CrMoNi 4 - 3 - 3 allows machining to be done to modify the pass or to remove any defects, and the primary and secondary precipitates of carbides enhance the tribological properties. The authors have been for years involved in the optimization of the structure of this material by slight correction to its chemical composition and/or the modification of heat treatment. The presented principles of heat treatment modifications will lead to considerable economic and ecologic profits. It has also been demonstrated that raising slightly the contents of carbide-forming elements, which markedly increases the quantity of transformed ledeburite, results in an enhancement of tribological properties.
