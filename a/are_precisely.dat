5|$|In DNA replication, DNA-dependent DNA polymerases {{make copies}} of DNA polynucleotide chains. To {{preserve}} biological information, {{it is essential that}} the sequence of bases in each copy <b>are</b> <b>precisely</b> complementary to the sequence of bases in the template strand. Many DNA polymerases have a proofreading activity. Here, the polymerase recognizes the occasional mistakes in the synthesis reaction by the lack of base pairing between the mismatched nucleotides. If a mismatch is detected, a 3′ to 5′ exonuclease activity is activated and the incorrect base removed. In most organisms, DNA polymerases function in a large complex called the replisome that contains multiple accessory subunits, such as the DNA clamp or helicases.|$|E
