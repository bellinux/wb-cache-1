40|$|Design {{considerations}} for UV-NIL resists were investigated {{focusing on the}} major issues of ink-jetting performance, pattern formability, release property, and dry etching resistance. Regarding ink-jetting performance, small droplet ink-jetting of 0. 7 pl was successfully demonstrated by adjusting the resist fluid property to the ink-jet coater and controlling the resist volatilization. Regarding pattern formability, a resist pattern was imprinted from a mold pattern of 28 nm in width and 60 nm in depth without pattern dimension change. It was thought that modulus control of the resist {{was more important than}} resist shrinkage in achieving excellent pattern formability. As for release property, resist with fluorine monomer and with non-reactive fluorine <b>anti-sticking</b> <b>agent</b> were compared. The results indicated that resist design has the capability to both reduce separation force and maintain a clear mold surface. The mold release agent decomposed with increasing number of imprint shots, but the low release force resist with non-reactive <b>anti-sticking</b> <b>agent</b> was able to control degradation of the mold release agent and thus improve release property endurance. Regarding etching resistance, it was found that increasing the ring parameter of resist is essential for high etching resistance, and resulted in improved etched pattern features of the substrate...|$|R
30|$|Not {{only to the}} RLT-controllable resin coating for R 2 R NIL {{and simple}} planar thin film fabrication, can the airbrushing method also be {{applicable}} to more specific uses and broader materials. As the microscale droplets out of an airbrusher nozzle can smoothly reflow along the surface topography [12], airbrushing further enables the conformal coating over the surfaces especially with large surface roughness, which otherwise demands special treatments in ordinary spin coating or drop casting. By airbrushing, many functional materials can be conformally coated on highly topographic and flexible surfaces, including photoresists [21], <b>anti-sticking</b> <b>agents</b> [22], and active layers in flexible photovoltaic cells [23 – 25].|$|R
30|$|Figure  1 {{demonstrates}} the fabrication {{procedures of the}} nanocone cluster microstructure. V-shape AAO {{was used as the}} template. The <b>anti-sticking</b> <b>agent</b> (GL-AAC, GermanLitho) was spin coated on the AAO template to make following procedures more easily. Then, the PDMS solution (GL-ML CURE, GL-ML BASE, GermanLitho, 10 : 1 ratio) was drop-cast on the V-shape template followed by a degassing process and then cured at 75  °C for 4  h, as shown in Fig.  1 b, c. The PDMS film was peeled off from the V-shape AAO template after the sample cooling down to the room temperature. The structure was thought to be vertical, just as shown in Fig.  1 d. However, as the pitch between each cone is very small and the height is very high, nanocones will be inclined to the side and aggregated together {{in order to reduce the}} surface energy, thus forming the nanocone cluster microstructure (Fig.  1 e). The aggregation of nanocones could be described in terms of two processes: fractal percolation and general Brownian movement. In the beginning, all the particles involved in PDMS solutions moved chaotically over the lattice points in fractal Brownian motion. When two particles met, they formed stable doublets, lost their mobility, and became the nuclei for the aggregates. When wandering particles approached cells next to aggregates, they were captured and became elements of the aggregate. Thus, more and more free particles were bound into an aggregate and form nanocone cluster microstructure [22].|$|R
