5|$|The first schools {{offering}} Western-style {{education in}} the presidency were established in Madras during the 18th century. In 1822, a Board of Public Instruction was created based on the recommendations of Sir Thomas Munro, after which schools teaching students in vernacular language was established.

However, this system appeared to be a failure and the policy was altered in 1836 in order to promote European literature and science. The Board of Public Instruction was superseded by a Committee for Native Education. In January 1840, during the viceroyalty of Lord Ellenborough, a University Board was established with Alexander J. Arbuthnot as the Joint Director of Public Instruction. The central school was converted to <b>a</b> <b>high</b> <b>school</b> <b>in</b> April 1841 with 67 students and in 1853 became the Presidency College {{with the addition of a}} college department.
