500|$|The {{character}} of Mahone {{was not in}} the original plan of the Prison Break staff writers for the second season. When the writers approached the Fox network with their plans for the second season, Fox Entertainment president Peter Liguori suggested including a fugitive pursuer who was [...] "not corrupt"; a character who is [...] "like the Tommy Lee Jones character in The Fugitive." [...] Along with Paul Kellerman and Brad Bellick, Mahone became a fugitive hunter {{at the start of the}} second season. The writers were aware of the increasing number of antagonists in the show, which led Olmstead to remark, [...] "If there <b>are</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> pursuing them, [...] are rendered inept because they're not all catching our convicts, and you can only have so many close calls." [...] The writers decided that the {{character of}} Mahone was to be a [...] "very formidable" [...] nemesis for the protagonists, and the [...] "flip side of Michael Scofield." [...] Scheuring acknowledges comparisons made between Mahone and Les Miserables character, Inspector Javert, [...] "He certainly is Javert to Michael's Valjean, but you can express it however you want. He's his nemesis." [...] One of the tricks used by the Prison Break writers is to constantly shift the sympathetic characters. Olmstead notes, [...] "A white-hat character can be kind of boring." [...] Fichtner does not believe that Mahone is a [...] "bad guy"; rather, he has [...] "a lot of demons driving him." ...|$|E
2500|$|When {{interviewed by}} Marc Maron in 2011, O'Brien remarked, [...] "I'm {{trying to avoid}} that thing where you get a story in your head that's very clean. I think there <b>are</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> that {{come up with a}} very simple story where they're the hero, and they don't learn anything." ...|$|E
2500|$|Roh {{committed}} suicide on 23 May 2009 by jumping from a mountain cliff behind his home, after saying that [...] "there <b>are</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> suffering because of me" [...] on {{a suicide note}} on his PC. About 4 million people visited Roh's hometown Bongha Village in the week following his death. His suicide was confirmed by police.|$|E
60|$|I couldn't try this, before, {{because there}} <b>were</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> along, but Rectus, {{who thought the}} idea was splendid, {{although}} he didn't intend to dive himself, agreed to hire a sail-boat with me, and go off to the reef, with only the darkey captain.|$|R
50|$|The {{first people}} were {{a brother and}} sister. Once the brother hit his sister with a fish {{and told her to}} multiply. Following this, she gave birth to a child every seven days and soon there <b>were</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> <b>people,</b> so women <b>were</b> then forced to have just one child every year.|$|R
5|$|The trial {{started on}} February 4, 2013. Blythe testified {{that when he}} wanted to see the club before the concert, Lamb of God's {{technician}} told him that the club was terrible and messy. According to Blythe, the technician went on, saying that the stage was small, there <b>were</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> <b>people,</b> and that it was rather dangerous.|$|R
2500|$|During his {{retirement}} years, Wieman lived in Portland, Oregon and Lake Arrowhead, California. [...] In 1962, {{he became the}} first full-time West Coast director of the Fellowship of Christian Athletes (FCA), and serving as its president for a time. [...] Wieman established the FCA's west coast headquarters in Portland. [...] Wieman chose Portland rather than his hometown of Los Angeles, saying [...] "There <b>are</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> and too much smog down there. [...] In Portland a man can feel good." [...] In a 1963 interview with the Los Angeles Times, Wieman said the FCA sought to [...] "harness hero worship" [...] and use it for evangelism and conversion to Christianity. [...] Wieman died in December 1971 in Portland at age 75.|$|E
2500|$|With the {{addition}} of the University to the Big Ten Conference comes {{the addition}} of a national television outlet, the Big Ten Network (BTN). RVision and BTN work hand in hand to bring sports fanatics as much coverage as possible of Rutgers athletics. [...] "There is an additional amount of work that BTN needs for their network that we can now shoot for them since we’re here and local," [...] said Rutgers senior associate athletics director Jason Baum, who has overseen the venture since its launch in 2009. [...] "RVision is a three-person team led by Colin Osborne that has a lot on their plate. I don’t know if there <b>are</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> that work as many hours a year as the RVision crew." [...] RVision has been asked by the Big Ten Network to provide footage of games, individual players, talkbacks with players and coaches, and scenic shots around campus with a Big Ten-logoed sign.|$|E

40|$|This was a rush job on a {{spontaneous}} trip. It {{was not possible}} to stay long or to meet with just one person. The whole recording is rather chaotic. There <b>were</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> but I tried to speak just with a few. Sonny Djonler was there to help as interpreter and to provide input. Recording and scan of transcription included...|$|R
50|$|Dylan has echoed most critics' complaints, telling Rolling Stone in a 2006 {{interview}} that the album's shortcomings resulted from hurried and unfocused recording sessions, {{due in part to}} his activity with the Traveling Wilburys at the time. He also claimed that there <b>were</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> working on the album, and that he was very disillusioned with the recording industry during this period of his career.|$|R
50|$|There {{are four}} school houses. Brock (after Sir Isaac Brock), Carey, Durand and De Sausmarez, commemorating {{the names of}} {{families}} who have been benefactors to the College and distinguished in their service to the Island. Until 1930, {{there were only three}} houses, Brock, Carey and De Sausmarez. In 1931, the school said that there <b>were</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> to fit into three houses so they created a new house called Durand.|$|R
60|$|CZAR. Quite right. There <b>are</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> in Russia, {{too much}} money spent on them, {{too much money}} in courts of justice. I'll shut them up.|$|E

50|$|The Dutch {{government}} {{had not wanted}} to use the old water line when the Germans had invaded in 1940. It was still possible to create an island out of the Holland region by destroying dikes and flooding the polders, but this island contained the main cities. The Dutch {{government had}} decided then that there <b>were</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> to keep alive to justify the flooding. However, Hitler ordered that Fortress Holland (German: Festung Holland) be held at any price.|$|R
60|$|There was no {{question}} of an accidental likeness; it was the girl herself, and he recognised the dress as one {{he had seen her}} wear. Turning sharply on his heel he turned down a bye street, and came out into Upper Street. There <b>were</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> here for him to think; he passed on, walking in the road {{at the edge of the}} pavement, to the Angel, and then turned down the comparatively quiet pavement of Pentonville Hill.|$|R

25|$|According to Greek mythology, Zeus {{had become}} {{king of the}} gods by overthrowing his father Cronus; Cronus in turn had overthrown his father Uranus. Zeus was not {{faithful}} {{to his wife and}} sister Hera, and had many relationships from which many children were born. Since Zeus believed that there <b>were</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> populating the earth, he envisioned Momus or Themis, who was to use the Trojan War as a means to depopulate the Earth, especially of his demigod descendants.|$|R
50|$|Hamsa Nandini (born Poonam Bartake) is an Indian model, dancer, {{and actress}} {{known for her}} works in Telugu cinema. She has modeled for MaaStars magazine, Celebrity Cricket League, and Hyderabad International Fashion week 2011 and 2013. Her birth name is Poonam, under which she {{appeared}} in her first few films, but since there <b>were</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> named Poonam in the film industry, director Vamsy rechristened her Hamsa Nandini. In 2015, she played the warrior princess Madanika in the Telugu historical Rudhramadevi.|$|R

60|$|The air of London {{feels very}} heavy. There is a nasty smell of smoke in London. There <b>are</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> in London. They {{seem to be}} mostly people in a hurry.

Of course it was talked about at every station in India at the time, and I know that even about here it is {{generally}} known. No, {{it will be better}} some day or other to tell it them ourselves, making, of course, light of the matter, and letting them see that we regard them equally as our sons, and love and care for them alike, and that even if we now knew the truth it could make no difference in our feelings towards them. It is much better they should learn it from us than from anyone else." ...|$|E
50|$|Meredith {{was born}} in Orange, New South Wales to George and Florence Meredith, and was their only child. She was educated in Sydney, first at Sydney Girls High School then the University of Sydney from which she {{graduated}} with a Bachelor of Arts in 1929. Her father believed that, with the Depression, there <b>were</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> needing jobs and that she should stay at home. She therefore managed the housekeeping and, from 1932 to 1939, owned and operated a bookshop.|$|R
50|$|Chambliss {{was later}} cornered in the Yankee locker room by Graig Nettles, who {{asked him if}} he had touched home. Chambliss responded that he had not, because there <b>were</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> in the way. Nettles then told him that home plate umpire Art Frantz was waiting for him out on the field for him to touch home so that the home run could be ruled official. Chambliss was then escorted out to the field and touched the area where home had been.|$|R
50|$|Maclean later {{described}} his writing process:I drew a cross square, lines down representing the characters, lines across representing chapters 1-15. Most {{of the characters}} died, in fact only one survived the book, but when I came to the end the graph looked somewhat lopsided, there <b>were</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> dying in the first, fifth and tenth chapters so I had to rewrite it, giving an even dying space throughout. I suppose it sounds cold blooded and calculated, but that's the way I did it.|$|R
60|$|So {{it is not}} all {{prayers for}} help that are heard, or deserve to be heard. And indeed--I {{do not wish to}} be hard, but the truth must be spoken--there <b>are</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> in the world who pray to God to help them, when they are in {{difficulties}} or in danger, or in fear of death and of hell, but never pray at any other time, or for any other thing. They pray to be helped out of what is disagreeable. But they never pray to be made good. They are not good, and they do not care to become good. All they care for, is to escape death, or pain, or poverty, or shame, when they see it staring them in the face: and God knows I do not blame them. We are all children, and, like children, we cry out when we are hurt; and that is no sin to us. But that is no part of godliness, not even of mere religion.|$|E
6000|$|In {{these recent}} {{debates in the}} House of Commons one can see every stock trick of the wire-puller in operation. Particularly we have the old dodge {{of the man who}} is [...] "in theory quite in sympathy with Proportional Representation, but ..." [...] It is, he {{declares}} regretfully, too late. It will cause delay. Difficult to make arrangements. Later on perhaps. And so on. It is never too late for a vital issue. Upon the speedy adoption of Proportional Representation depends, as Mr. Balfour made plain in an admirable speech, whether the great occasions of the peace and after the peace are to be handled by a grand council of all that is best and most leaderlike in the nation, or whether they are to be left to a few leaders, apparently leading, but really profoundly swayed by the obscure crowd of politicians and jobbers behind them. Are the politicians to hamper and stifle us in this supreme crisis of our national destinies or are we British peoples to have a real control of our own affairs in this momentous time? Are men of light and purpose to have a voice in public affairs or not? Proportional Representation is supremely a test question. It is a question that no adverse decision in the House of Commons can stifle. There <b>are</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> now who grasp its importance and significance. Every one who sets a proper value upon purity in public life and the vitality of democratic institutions will, I am convinced, vote and continue to vote across every other question against the antiquated, foul, and fraudulent electoral methods that have hitherto robbed democracy of three-quarters of its efficiency.|$|E
60|$|It was a {{car that}} promised comfort; indeed, luxury. Yet the cost of it --well, economy could no further go; even in France; not even in Italy. It was built of the plainest and {{cheapest}} partially-smoothed boards, with a coating of dull paint on them, and there was nowhere a thought of decoration. The floor was bare, but would not long remain so when the dust should begin to fly. Across {{one end of the}} compartment ran a netting for the accommodation of hand-baggage; at the other end was a door which would shut, upon compulsion, but wouldn't stay shut; it opened into a narrow little closet which had a wash-bowl in one end of it, and a place to put a towel, in case you had one with you--and you would be sure to have towels, because you buy them with the bedding, knowing that the railway doesn't furnish them. On each side of the car, and running fore and aft, was a broad leather-covered sofa to sit on in the day and sleep on at night. Over each sofa hung, by straps, a wide, flat, leather-covered shelf--to sleep on. In the daytime you can hitch it up against the wall, out of the way--and then you have a big unencumbered and most comfortable room to spread out in. No car in any country is quite its equal for comfort (and privacy) I think. For usually there are but two persons in it; and even when there are four there is but little sense of impaired privacy. Our own cars at home can surpass the railway world in all details but that one: they have no cosiness; there <b>are</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> together.|$|E
50|$|The would-be assassin {{appeared}} on the chosen location {{in the morning of}} December 3, but, like in 1959, he saw that there <b>were</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> along Krakowska Street, so he decided to postpone the explosion until the delegation came back from the opening of the mine. After waiting for a few hours, he saw a few vehicles, and came to conclusion it was Gomułka's motorcade. Jaros detonated the bomb, not knowing that Gomułka still was at the coal mine, {{and as a result of}} the explosion, two innocent people were injured.|$|R
6000|$|... "There <b>are</b> far <b>too</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> {{along the}} road, sahib; {{it could not}} have been done. But, of course, there was no knowing that she would be sent off {{directly}} after the Nana had seen her." ...|$|R
5000|$|The colonial {{authorities}} implemented this decree because <b>too</b> <b>many</b> (early) Christianized Filipinos assumed religious-instrument and saint names. There soon <b>were</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> surnamed [...] "de los Santos" [...] ("of the Saints"), [...] "de la Cruz" [...] ("of the Cross"), [...] "del Rosario" [...] ("of the Rosary"), [...] "Bautista" [...] ("Baptist"), etcetera, {{which made}} it difficult for the Spanish colonists to control the Filipino people, and most important, to collect taxes. This Spanish naming custom countered the native Filipino naming custom wherein siblings assumed different surnames, as practised before the Spanish conquest of the Philippine Islands.|$|R
