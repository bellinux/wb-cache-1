He was {{dissatisfied}} with it and wrote to William Plomer, the copy editor of his novels, <b>asking</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> to be rewritten. Fleming became increasingly unhappy with the book and considered rewriting it, but was dissuaded by Plomer, who considered it viable for publication.|$|E

25|$|Consumers {{typically}} have positive attitudes for {{products that are}} ethically made. These products may include promises of fair labor conditions, protection of the environment, and protection of human rights. All fair trade products must meet standards such as these. Despite positive attitudes toward ethical products including fair trade commodities, consumers often {{are not willing to}} pay the higher price associated with fair trade coffee. The attitude-behavior gap can help explain why ethical and fair trade products take up less than 1% of the market. Coffee consumers can say {{they would be willing to}} pay a higher premium for fair trade coffee, but most consumers are actually more concerned with the brand, label, and flavor of the coffee. However, socially conscious consumers with a commitment to buying fair trade products are more likely to pay the premium associated with fair trade coffee. Once enough consumers begin purchasing fair trade, companies are more likely to carry fair trade products. Safeway Inc. began carrying fair trade coffee after individual consumers dropped off postcards <b>asking</b> <b>for</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
25|$|Since {{the late}} 1990s, {{there have been}} {{plans for a new}} 20,200-seat stadium at nearby Great Coates – {{tentatively}} titled the Conoco Stadium after a naming rights deal with the American energy corporation ConocoPhillips. There have been numerous delays {{to the development of the}} new stadium. The plans have been met with resistance from many residents of the local area surrounding the proposed stadium site, but other factors have also slowed progress. One of the most notable difficulties for the club was in demonstrating how it planned to finance the scheme. As a result, they later amended their proposal to include a retail park on the site, which would help to fund the development. This raised other problems, due to a rival proposal by the property developer Henry Boot, who are continuing with plans for their own retail park, which will be in direct competition with the Grimsby Town site and which has also been approved by the local council. Henry Boot attempted to have the football team's development plan stopped, by <b>asking</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> to be sent for judicial review by the Government, however their attempt failed. Currently, the Grimsby Town stadium development proposal has satisfied all the conditions that were imposed by planning officials and consent for the project has been granted. Initial estimates had suggested that the club would be able to move to the new stadium for the start of the 2011–12 season. However, as a result of the ongoing global recession, the club has halted all progress on the new development and it is unlikely that any work will begin until an upturn in the economy.|$|E

500|$|The {{sound mixing}} department's {{inspiration}} for the [...] "Edina hum" [...] (the frequency hiding the deformities of the townsfolk) came from executive producer Jeff Pinkner.

After the scene when Mark inadvertently reveals Jerry was adopted, the writers built upon that joke and established Jerry as the co-worker the rest of the department picks on. Schur said after [...] "Practice Date", [...] "We realized that's who he is: He's the guy who wants to put his head down and get his pension, but is <b>asking</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> all the time. In the next three scripts, it was like throwing chum into the water. Every script after that had 15 slams on Jerry. [...] "Practice Date" [...] marked the first of several appearances by Jay Jackson as Pawnee news reporter Perd Hapley. The character was only originally intended for one appearance, but Schur said the staff enjoyed his performance so much that they made him a recurring character.|$|E

500|$|Disney's English dub {{was well}} {{received}} by audiences and critics, especially {{in comparison to}} Warriors of the Wind, with the leading voice actors frequently being praised for their performances. However, in conducting a comparative analysis of the Japanese-language anime with their English translations, Eriko Ogihara-Schuck believes that although Disney's dub eschewed the dualistic, good versus evil worldview of Warriors of the Wind, it also “Christianiz Miyazaki's animism”. According to her, the translators of the film were working a language suffused with Judeo-Christian idioms not found in Japanese, which they introduce to the text, such as the nature of humanity's relationship with the environment and animals as seen in Judeo-Christian narratives and cultural practices. Examples of these changes include when Nausicaä describes an insect as a [...] "good boy", a term often used in describing domesticated animals (instead of a [...] "good child", as in the Japanese version), and when Nausicaä converses with the wounded baby Ohm - in Japanese, she does not consider forgiveness from the baby a possibility, while the English version has her <b>asking</b> <b>for</b> <b>it,</b> albeit admitting the difficulty for the Ohm to do so. As {{a result of these}} changes, Nausicaä's death and subsequent resurrection by the Ohm herd present her as a Christ figure whose self-sacrifices are for mankind, rather than for nature. Ogihara-Schuck believes that Disney erased animistic motifs almost entirely from the film, even more so than Warriors of the Wind, {{in order to make it}} more accessible for American audiences due the film's non-specific setting, since animism was retained in their versions of My Neighbour Totoro, Princess Mononoke, Spirited Away and Ponyo, as well as their own production Pocahontas.|$|E

2500|$|After {{her success}} in this role, she {{appeared}} as a society belle in Betrayed by a Handprint and as an Indian in The Red Girl. In total, she had parts {{in most of the}} 60 films directed by Griffith in 1908. Toward the end of 1908 Lawrence married Harry Solter. Lawrence gained much popularity, but because her name was never publicized, fans began writing the studio <b>asking</b> <b>for</b> <b>it.</b> Even after she had gained wide recognition, particularly after starring in the highly successful Resurrection, Biograph Studios refused to publicly announce her name and fans simply called her [...] "The Biograph Girl". During cinema's formative years, silent screen actors were not named, because studio owners feared that fame might lead to demands for higher wages. She continued to work for Biograph in 1909. Her demand to be paid by the week rather than daily was met, and she received double the normal rate.|$|E
2500|$|Although some antiquarians {{had made}} {{attempts}} to excavate and catalogue the Anglo-Saxon grave-sites, on the whole, such sites were commonly damaged and destroyed in eighteenth and {{early nineteenth century}} England, with little attempt being made to properly study them. Due to the Society of Antiquaries' inability {{to act on the}} situation, in 1843 Charles Roach Smith and Thomas Wright [...] both keen Anglo-Saxonists [...] founded the British Archaeological Association (BAA), which held its first conference the following year in Canterbury. The BAA's leadership campaigned for better rights for native British archaeology, <b>asking</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> to be protected legally and to be recognised by major institutions. When the British Museum refused to purchase Faussett's collection of Anglo-Saxon artefacts following his grandson's death in 1853, Roach Smith complained that [...] "not only does the Government begin with gathering the monuments, ancient and modern, of all foreign countries, but it ends there also.

2500|$|Martin Horwood, MP for Cheltenham, Sandiford's {{most recent}} UK residence, {{expressed}} his shock at the sentence. [...] "The {{days of the}} death penalty ought to be past. This is not the way that a country that now values democracy and human rights should really be behaving." [...] The sentence was also condemned by the anti–death penalty charity Reprieve, which has taken up her case. The organisation's Harriet McCulloch said, [...] "She is clearly not a drug king pin - she has no money to pay for a lawyer, for the travel costs of defence witnesses or even for essentials like food and water. She has cooperated fully with the Indonesian authorities but has been sentenced to death while the gang operating in the UK, Thailand and Indonesia remain free to target other vulnerable people." [...] Tim Hancock, Campaigns Director of Amnesty International UK also criticised the sentence. [...] "It is extremely sad to hear that judges have decided to give Lindsay Sandiford a death sentence – {{despite the fact that the}} prosecution weren't even <b>asking</b> <b>for</b> <b>it.</b> She is the second British citizen sentenced to death for drug offences in the last six months – an extremely worrying trend." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{recording}} {{sessions for}} Live Through This began on October 8, 1993 at Triclops Sound Studios in Marietta, Georgia. The studio was booked at {{the recommendation of}} The Smashing Pumpkins, who had recorded their second studio album, Siamese Dream (1993) there. The assigned producers were Paul Q. Kolderie and Sean Slade. The first week of recording was spent recording basic tracks, including drums, bass, scratch guitars, and scratch vocals. After basic tracks were completed, Love's husband, Kurt Cobain, joined the band in-studio before Nirvana were set to tour to promote In Utero. Cobain was presented with the basic tracks and the band invited Cobain to sing on a few unfinished numbers. Cobain initially refused, due to being unfamiliar with the material. When Cobain asked, [...] "how can I sing on it if I haven't heard it?," [...] Love answered by encouraging him to [...] "just sing {{off the top of}} [...] head." [...] Cobain is known to have provided backing vocals to [...] "Asking for It" [...] and [...] "Softer, Softest," [...] however Kolderie has said Cobain [...] "sang on about five or so , probably [...] "Violet", [...] "Miss World" [...] and [...] "Doll Parts, I can't remember any of the others." [...] After taking a break for dinner, the session devolved into a [...] "formless jam" [...] with Cobain on drums, Love and Erlandson on guitars and producer Sean Slade on bass. Dana Kletter (blackgirls, Dish, Dear Enemy) was asked to sing backing vocals on the record, and appears on seven songs, including Violet, Miss World, <b>Asking</b> <b>For</b> <b>It,</b> Doll Parts, Softer Softest, and She Walks On Me. Producer Sean Slade said, [...] "I {{think one of the reasons}} that Doll Parts might have been a hit is that harmony Dana does on the You will ache like I ache part, it's almost like an Appalachian close harmony against what Courtney is doing. It's very melancholic." [...] There have been rumors that Kletter did more than sing backing vocals, but the band denies it.|$|E
