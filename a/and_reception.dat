5|$|Carlton House Terrace {{underwent}} {{a series of}} renovations between 1999 and November 2003 to improve and standardise the property. New waiting, exhibition <b>and</b> <b>reception</b> rooms were created in the house at No.7, using the Magna Boschi marble found in No.8, and greenish grey Statuario Venato marble was used in other areas to standardise the design. An effort was also made to make {{the layout of the}} buildings easier, consolidating all the offices on one floor, Fellows' Rooms on another and all the accommodation on a third.|$|E

The {{building}} opened in 1925 under its former name of Kirkcaldy Museum and Art Gallery and was extended to provide a main library in 1928. In 2011, the building was closed to allow a £2.4million renovation which was completed in June 2013. The work resulted in the integration of the facilities within the building through a single entrance <b>and</b> <b>reception</b> desk. The building also adopted its present name.|$|E

In March 1995, the People's Association (PA) announced plans to spend S$9.56 million to upgrade 54 community centres and clubs that were over ten years old, adding facilities such as lifts, dance studios, karaoke rooms and multi-purpose air-conditioned activities rooms, to make community centres more user-friendly, with open concept offices <b>and</b> <b>reception</b> areas.|$|E
5|$|The oldest {{building}} in the complex is the Executive, Library and Museum Building. Situated next to the Hills Capitol and the Huston Capitol, {{it was built in}} 1894. It was designated the Matthew J. Ryan Legislative Office Building on June 14, 1999, in recognition of former Speaker Matthew J. Ryan. The Ryan Office Building is the oldest {{building in}} the complex and was originally designed to house the State Library and State Museum of Pennsylvania, as well as the Governor's Office <b>and</b> <b>Reception</b> Room. Today it houses the offices {{of the members of the}} Pennsylvania House of Representatives.|$|E
5|$|William I. McLaughlin {{proposed}} {{a new strategy}} {{in the search for}} extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) in 1977. He suggested that widely observable events such as nova explosions might be used by intelligent extraterrestrials to synchronise the transmission <b>and</b> <b>reception</b> of their signals. This idea was tested by the National Radio Astronomy Observatory in 1988, which used outbursts of Nova Cygni 1975 as the timer. Fifteen days of observation showed no anomalous radio signals coming from Epsilon Eridani.|$|E

5|$|Work {{began on}} {{creating}} a landing ground at Folks Wood, Lympne, {{in the autumn}} of 1915. This site soon proved unsuitable and another site was sought. Lympne was established in March 1916 as an Emergency Landing Ground for the Royal Flying Corps (RFC) home defence fighters defending London against Zeppelins and Gothas. No.1 Advanced School of Air Gunnery operated from Lympne during January and February 1917. In January 1917 it was designated as No.8 Aircraft Acceptance Park for delivery of aircraft to, <b>and</b> <b>reception</b> from, France. On 25 May 1917 Lympne was bombed by Gotha G.IV bombers of Kagohl 3 who dropped 19 bombs on the airfield.|$|E
5|$|Communications signals {{can be sent}} {{either by}} analog signals or digital signals. There are analog {{communication}} systems and digital communication systems. For an analog signal, the signal is varied continuously {{with respect to the}} information. In a digital signal, the information is encoded as a set of discrete values (for example, a set of ones and zeros). During the propagation <b>and</b> <b>reception,</b> the information contained in analog signals will inevitably be degraded by undesirable physical noise. (The output of a transmitter is noise-free for all practical purposes.) Commonly, the noise in a communication system can be expressed as adding or subtracting from the desirable signal in a completely random way. This form of noise is called additive noise, with the understanding that the noise can be negative or positive at different instants of time. Noise that is not additive noise is a much more difficult situation to describe or analyze, and these other kinds of noise will be omitted here.|$|E
5|$|Filming moved {{once again}} in January 2011 to the Druid Hills {{quadrant}} of Atlanta, which contains {{the headquarters of the}} Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The restricted nature of the CDC campus meant that producers were only allowed to shoot exterior scenes of the area, as well as within the parking garage <b>and</b> <b>reception</b> area for the CDC's museum onsite. Principal photography then proceeded into Atlanta's central business district and Decatur, before advancing to London, Geneva, and lastly San Francisco, California, in the ensuing month. The San Francisco Film Commission charged filmmakers $300 per day for production within the city limits. In the North Beach and Potrero Hill sections of the city, production designer Howard Cummings scattered trash and discarded clothing on the ground to depict the rapid decline of civilization. For the Civic Center set, over 2,000 extras were sought for in background roles; actors who were a part of the Screen Actors Guild were paid $139 per day, while nonunion workers received $64 per day for their work. Other filming locations were established at Golden Gate Park, Chinatown, and Candlestick Park; it cost $60,000 to rent the football stadium for six days.|$|E

5|$|Homing on the enemy's {{broadcasts}} {{meant that}} there was no accurate way to calculate the range to the target; radar ranging measurements are based on timing the delay between broadcast <b>and</b> <b>reception,</b> {{and there was no way}} to know when the enemy's signal was originally broadcast. This meant that the homing device could only be used for the initial tracking, and the final approach would have to be carried out by radar. The extra range of the Mk. VIII was not required in this role as Serrate would bring the fighter within easy tracking range, and the loss of a Mk. IV would not reveal the secret of the magnetron to the Germans. For this reason, the Mk. IV was considered superior to the newer radars for this role, in spite of any technical advantages of the newer designs.|$|E
5|$|In July 2013, the Air Force began a fleet-wide {{technological}} upgrade of its B-52 bombers called Combat Network Communications Technology (CONECT) {{to modernize}} electronics, communications technology, computing, and avionics {{on the flight}} deck. CONECT upgrades include software and hardware such as new computer servers, modems, radios, data-links, receivers, and digital workstations for the crew. One update is the ARC-210 Warrior beyond-line-of-sight software programmable radio able to transmit voice, data, and information in-flight between B-52s and ground command and control centers, allowing the transmission <b>and</b> <b>reception</b> of data with updated intelligence, mapping, and targeting information; previous in-flight target changes required copying down coordinates. The ARC-210 allows machine-to-machine transfer of data, useful on long-endurance missions where targets may have moved {{before the arrival of}} the B-52. The aircraft will be able to receive information through Link-16. CONECT upgrades will cost $1.1 billion overall and take several years. Funding has been secured for 30 B-52s; the Air Force hopes for 10 CONECT upgrades per year, but the rate has yet to be decided.|$|E
5|$|The Eucharist {{was a key}} {{center of}} {{controversy}} in the Reformation as it not only focused differences between the reformers and the church but also between themselves. For Zwingli {{it was a matter}} of attacking a doctrine that imperiled the understanding <b>and</b> <b>reception</b> of God's gift of salvation, while for Luther {{it was a matter of}} defending a doctrine that embodied that gift. It is not known what Zwingli's eucharistic theology was before he became a reformer and there is disagreement among scholars about his views during his first few years as a priest. In the eighteenth article of The Sixty-seven Articles (1523) which concerns the sacrifice of the mass, he states that it is a memorial of the sacrifice. He expounds on this in An Exposition of the Articles (1523).|$|E

5|$|The {{sixth and}} final symphony, Sinfonia semplice, {{was written in}} 1924–25. After {{suffering}} a serious heart attack in 1925, Nielsen was forced to curtail much of his activity, although he continued to compose until his death. His sixtieth birthday in 1925 brought many congratulations, a decoration from the Swedish government, and a gala concert <b>and</b> <b>reception</b> in Copenhagen. The composer, however, was in a dour mood; {{in an article in}} Politiken on 9 November 1925 he wrote: If I could live my life again, I would chase any thoughts of Art out of my head and be apprenticed to a merchant or pursue some other useful trade the results of which could be visible in the end... What use is it to me that the whole world acknowledges me, but hurries away and leaves me alone with my wares until everything breaks down and I discover to my disgrace that I have lived as a foolish dreamer and believed that the more I worked and exerted myself in my art, the better position I would achieve. No, it is no enviable fate to be an artist.|$|E
