5|$|After {{the fall}} of Napoleon, {{not only was the}} Napoleonic Code {{retained}} by conquered countries including the Netherlands, Belgium, parts of Italy and Germany, but has been used <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> certain parts of law outside Europe including the Dominican Republic, the US state of Louisiana and the Canadian province of Quebec. The memory of Napoleon in Poland is favorable, for his support for independence and opposition to Russia, his legal code, the abolition of serfdom, and the introduction of modern middle class bureaucracies.|$|E
5|$|Another legacy was the Arbeitsstab Wiederaufbau zerstörter Städte (Working {{group on}} Reconstruction of {{destroyed}} cities), authorized by Speer in 1943 to rebuild bombed German cities {{to make them}} more livable {{in the age of the}} automobile. Headed by Wolters, the working group took a possible military defeat into their calculations. The Arbeitsstabs recommendations served <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> the postwar redevelopment plans in many cities, and Arbeitsstab members became prominent in the rebuilding.|$|E

5|$|As {{early as}} 1857 the Beetons had {{considered}} using the magazine columns <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> {{a book of}} collected recipes and homecare advice, Hughes believes, and in November 1859 they launched a series of 48-page monthly supplements with The Englishwoman's Domestic Magazine. The print block for the whole series of the supplements was set from the beginning so the break between each edition was fixed at 48 pages, regardless of the text, and in several issues the text of a sentence or recipe is split {{between the end of}} one instalment {{and the beginning of the}} next.|$|E
5|$|By 1942, {{most of the}} {{differences}} between politicians in occupied Poland and those in exile had been positively settled. By 1943, the PKP had evolved into the Home Political Representation (Krajowa Reprezentacja Polityczna, KRP), which served <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> the Council of National Unity (Rada Jedności Narodowej, RJN), created on 9 January 1944. The Council, headed by Kazimierz Pużak, was seen as the Underground State's parliament. Meanwhile, the military arm of the Underground State expanded dramatically, and the ZWZ was transformed into Armia Krajowa (AK, or the Home Army) in 1942. ZWZ-AK commanders included Stefan Rowecki, Tadeusz Komorowski and Leopold Okulicki.|$|E
5|$|During the Napoleonic era, {{there was}} a move {{among some of the}} German states to reform their systems of {{measurement}} using the prototype metre and kilogram <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> the new units. Baden, in 1810, for example, redefined the Ruthe (rods) as being 3.0m exactly and defined the subunits of the Ruthe as 1 Ruthe = 10Fuß (feet) = 100Zoll (inches) = 1,000Linie (lines) = 10,000Punkt (points) while the Pfund was defined as being 500g, divided into 30Loth, each of 16.67g. Bavaria, in its reform of 1811, trimmed the Bavarian Pfund from 561.288g to 560g exactly, consisting of 32 Loth, each of 17.5g while the Prussian Pfund remained at 467.711g.|$|E

5|$|It isn't a {{personal}} pain which has brought me here, {{as is the}} case in the majority of these people, but rather recognition of the symbolic nature of Katyń. Russians and Poles, tortured to death, lie here together. It seems very important to me that the truth should be spoken about what took place, for only with the truth can the new Soviet leadership distance itself from the crimes of Stalin and the NKVD. Only the truth can serve <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> true friendship between the Soviet and the Polish peoples. The truth will make a path for itself. I am convinced of this by the very fact that I was able to travel here.|$|E
5|$|MacPaint uses two offscreen memory buffers {{to avoid}} flicker when {{dragging}} shapes or images across the screen. One of these buffers contained the existing pixels of a document, {{and the other}} contained the pixels of its previous state. The second buffer was used <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> the software's undo feature. In April 1983, the software's name was changed from MacSketch to MacPaint. The original MacPaint was programmed as a single-document interface. The palette positions and sizes were unalterable, as was the document window. This was different from other Macintosh software at the time, which allowed the users to move windows and resize them.|$|E
5|$|Regularity {{and order}} are common {{features}} in Toraja wood carving (see table below), {{as well as}} abstracts and geometrical designs. Nature is frequently used <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> Toraja's ornaments, because nature is full of abstractions and geometries with regularities and ordering. Toraja's ornaments have been studied in ethnomathematics to reveal their mathematical structure, but Torajans base this art only on approximations. To create an ornament, bamboo sticks are used as a geometrical tool.|$|E

5|$|Sharia (or Islamic law), {{the primary}} source of law in modern Saudi Arabia, was {{developed}} gradually by Muslim judges and scholars between the seventh and tenth centuries. From the time of the Abbasid caliphate in the 8th century, the developing Sharia was accepted <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> law in the towns of the Muslim world, including the Arabian peninsula, and upheld by local rulers, eclipsing urf (or pre-Islamic local customary law). In the rural areas, urf continued to be predominant for some time, and, for instance, was the main source of law among the bedouin of Nejd in central Arabia until the early 20th century.|$|E
5|$|Shaw's next {{attempt at}} drama was a one-act playlet in French, Un Petit Drame, written in 1884 but not {{published}} in his lifetime. In {{the same year}} the critic William Archer suggested a collaboration, with a plot by Archer and dialogue by Shaw. The project foundered, but Shaw returned to the draft <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> Widowers' Houses in 1892, and the connection with Archer proved of immense value to Shaw's career.|$|E
5|$|The 1910s were a {{productive}} time for Du Bois. In 1911 {{he attended the}} First Universal Races Congress in London and he published his first novel, The Quest of the Silver Fleece. Two years later, Du Bois wrote, produced, and directed a pageant for the stage, The Star of Ethiopia. In 1915, Du Bois published The Negro, a general history of black Africans, and {{the first of its}} kind in English. The book rebutted claims of African inferiority, and would come to serve <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> much Afrocentric historiography in the 20th century. The Negro predicted unity and solidarity for colored people around the world, and it influenced many who supported the Pan-African movement.|$|E

5|$|The Mk. IV {{was used}} in the front lines for only a short period. The {{introduction}} of the cavity magnetron in 1940 led to rapid progress in microwave-frequency radars, which offered far greater accuracy and were effective at low altitudes. The prototype Mk. VII began to replace the Mk. IV at the end of 1941, and the AI Mk. VIII largely relegated the Mk. IV to second-line duties by 1943. The Mk. IV's receiver, originally a television receiver, was used <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> the ASV Mk. II radar, Chain Home Low, AMES Type 7, and many other radar systems throughout the war.|$|E
5|$|The Model 8-A, {{the export}} {{model of the}} Northrop Attack Bomber series was never {{intended}} to serve <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> a floatplane {{and had to be}} redesigned to meet the requirements of the Norwegian order. The new N-3PB was the first product of Northrop Aircraft, which had reformed in 1939, and was a low-winged cantilever monoplane fitted with twin floats. First intended for a lower powered engine, the N-3PB was ultimately powered by a Wright Cyclone radial engine, of the same type specified for the Douglas 8A-5N bombers and Curtiss Hawk 75A-8s ordered by Norway at the same time, simplifying the eventual maintenance and operation requirements for the entire Norwegian military aircraft fleets.|$|E
5|$|The New Zealand Division was an {{infantry}} {{division of the}} New Zealand Expeditionary Force raised for service in the First World War.
