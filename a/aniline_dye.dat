25|$|Sir William Henry Perkin (12 March 1838 - 14 July 1907), {{was born}} in Shadwell and {{at the age of}} 18 {{discovered}} the first <b>aniline</b> <b>dye</b> while doing experiments at his home in Cable Street.|$|E
25|$|Traditional dyes used in Persian rugs are {{obtained}} from plants and insects. In 1856, the English chemist William Henry Perkin invented the first <b>aniline</b> <b>dye,</b> mauveine. A {{variety of other}} synthetic dyes were invented thereafter. Cheap, readily prepared {{and easy to use}} as they were compared to natural dyes, their use is documented since the mid 1860s. The tradition of natural dyeing was revived in Turkey in the early 1980s. Chemical analyses led to the identification of natural dyes from antique wool samples, and dyeing recipes and processes were experimentally re-created.|$|E
25|$|Discoveries {{in color}} science created new {{industries}} and drove changes in fashion and taste. The discovery in 1856 of mauveine, the first <b>aniline</b> <b>dye,</b> was a forerunner {{for the development}} of hundreds of synthetic dyes and pigments like azo and diazo compounds which are the source of a wide spectrum of colors. Mauveine was discovered by an 18-year-old chemist named William Henry Perkin, who went on to exploit his discovery in industry and become wealthy. His success attracted a generation of followers, as young scientists went into organic chemistry to pursue riches. Within a few years, chemists had synthesized a substitute for madder in the production of Alizarin Crimson. By the closing decades of the 19th century, textiles, paints, and other commodities in colors such as red, crimson, blue, and purple had become affordable.|$|E

2500|$|Mauveine <b>Aniline</b> <b>dyes</b> (first {{chemical}} dyes) {{were discovered}} in 1856 and quickly became fashionable colors. [...] The first ones were mauve and bright purple. [...] In 1860, two fashionable brilliant pink <b>aniline</b> <b>dyes</b> were named after battles in Italy's fight for independence: magenta, named after the Italian town of Magenta, Lombardy, and the similar solferino, named after Solferino. [...] Magenta was popularized in England by the Duchess of Sutherland after she was appealed to by the Spitalfields silk weavers.|$|R

25|$|Despite his {{pioneering}} work with gas Murdoch {{never made any}} money from this invention due to his failure to obtain a patent. This may have been partly {{a result of the}} advice of James Watt, Junior, that the discovery was not patentable, and partly a result of the commercial failure of his earlier patent of 1791 for an early form of <b>aniline</b> <b>dye.</b> This failure to apply for a patent, despite the commercial participation of Boulton and Watt in this field, left the fledgling industry of gas production and lighting open for exploitation by other commercial interests, such as his former assistant Samuel Clegg and Frederick Albert Winsor. In large part this was due to the failure of Boulton and Watt to make sufficient effort to expand from the factory and mill lighting market which they dominated by 1809 into the street and domestic lighting market. This reason for this lassitude is unknown but can be attributed to lack of interest, a failure to appreciate the size of the potential market, and a lack of desire to be involved in smaller, less prestigious projects. By May 1809 Boulton and Watt faced little competition in any gas market due to their success in lobbying Parliament to block the granting of a charter for the National Heat and Light Company, their only real competitor in this field. However, despite blocking the charter until 1812 this advantage was squandered as Boulton and Watt did not develop the gas market, or technology, and in 1814 abandoned the gas business. A few decades later most towns in Britain were lit by gas and most had their own gasworks.|$|E
500|$|Mendelssohn married Cécile Charlotte Sophie Jeanrenaud (10 October 1817– 25 September 1853), the {{daughter}} of a French Reformed Church clergyman, on 28 March 1837. The couple had five children: Carl, Marie, Paul, Lili and Felix. The second youngest child, Felix August, contracted measles in 1844 and was left with his health impaired; he died in 1851. The eldest, Carl Mendelssohn Bartholdy (7 February 1838– 23 February 1897), became a distinguished historian, and professor of history at [...] Heidelberg and Freiburg universities, dying in 1897 in a psychiatric institution in Freiburg. Paul Mendelssohn Bartholdy (1841–1880) was a noted chemist and pioneered the manufacture of <b>aniline</b> <b>dye.</b> Marie married Victor Benecke and lived in London. Lili married Adolph Wach, later Professor of Law at Leipzig University.|$|E
500|$|The first {{synthetic}} dyes {{were discovered}} in the mid-19th century, starting with William Henry Perkin's mauveine in 1856, an <b>aniline</b> <b>dye</b> derived from coal tar. Alizarin, the red dye present in madder, was the first natural pigment to be duplicated synthetically, in 1869, leading {{to the collapse of}} the market for naturally grown madder. [...] The development of new, strongly colored aniline dyes followed quickly: a range of reddish-purples, blues, violets, greens and reds became available by 1880. These dyes had great affinity for animal fibres such as wool and silk. [...] The new colors tended to fade and wash out, but they were inexpensive and could be produced in the vast quantities required by textile production in the industrial revolution. By the 1870s commercial dyeing with natural dyestuffs was fast disappearing.|$|E

500|$|In 1902 William John Matheson, who {{had made}} his fortune in the <b>aniline</b> <b>dye</b> business, visited Biscayne Bay on his yacht. He soon built a winter home in Coconut Grove {{overlooking}} the bay. In 1908 Matheson began buying up the property on Key Biscayne north of the Davis holdings, {{all the way to}} Bear Cut, over 1,700 (about 690 hectares) acres. Matheson created a plantation community, employing 42 workers by 1915, and 60 later. It included housing for the workers and their families, packing houses, docks, a school, a big barn, windmills, and [...] of (unpaved) roads. The plantation had 36,000 coconut trees, {{and a variety of other}} tropical fruits. In 1921 Matheson introduced the Malay Dwarf coconut to the United States. This is now the most common variety of coconut found in Florida, after lethal yellowing killed off most of the Jamaican Tall coconut trees and many other varieties. The Matheson coconut plantation was at least twice as large as any other in the United States. By 1933, the world price for coconut products had dropped to about two-fifths of its 1925 level, and the plantation stopped shipping.|$|E

2500|$|Membrane {{filtration}} is {{the method}} of choice {{for the analysis of}} fecal coliforms in water. [...] Samples to be tested are passed through a filter of particular pore size (generally 0.45 micrometre). [...] The microorganisms present in the water remain on the filter surface. [...] The filter is placed in a sterile petri dish with a selective medium, growth of the desired organisms is encouraged, while other non--target organisms is suppressed. [...] Each cell develops into a separate colony, which can be counted directly, and the initial inoculum size can be determined. [...] Typically sample volumes of 100 ml will be used for water testing and filtered, with the goal of achieving a final desirable colony density range of 20 to 60 colonies per filter. [...] Contaminated sources may require dilution to achieve a [...] "countable" [...] membrane. The filter is placed on a petri dish containing M-FC agar and incubated for 24 hours at 44.5 °C (112.1 degrees F). [...] This elevated temperature heat shocks non-fecal bacteria and suppresses their growth. [...] As the fecal coliform colonies grow they produce an acid (through fermenting lactose) that reacts with the <b>aniline</b> <b>dye</b> in the agar thus giving the colonies their blue color.|$|E

60|$|Water Colours and Dyes.--The pads most {{commonly}} used with office stamps are made of variously prepared gelatine, covered with fine silk to protect the surface, and saturated with an <b>aniline</b> <b>dye.</b> If the surface be touched, the finger is inked, and if the circumstances are all favourable, a good print may be made, but there is much liability to blot. The pad remains ready for use during many days without any attention, fresh ink being added at long intervals. The advantage of a dye over an ordinary water colour is, that it percolates the silk without any of its colour being kept back; while a solution of lampblack or Indian ink, consisting of particles of soot suspended in water, leaves all its black particles behind when it is carefully filtered; only clear water then passes through.|$|E

50|$|The {{earliest}} form of colorization introduced limited color into {{a black-and-white}} film using dyes, {{as a visual}} effect. The earliest Edison films, most notably the Anabelle Butterfly Dance series, were also the earliest examples of colorization, done by painting <b>aniline</b> <b>dyes</b> onto the emulsion.|$|R
50|$|The {{process for}} tinting was laborious, {{although}} simple in principle. Editing {{was done in}} rolls based on tint color, with numbered frames of film in between scenes for later assembly. Once these rolls were printed and processed from the negative, they were immersed in <b>aniline</b> <b>dyes,</b> specified to the colors that were listed in the script or continuity. Hardening fixer was not used on the film {{in order for the}} dye to be imbibed into the emulsion quicker and with better results. Once the film had dried on large film drums, it would be assembled in correct order and rewound onto reels for shipping. Toning was similar, but instead of <b>aniline</b> <b>dyes,</b> the film was immersed in chemicals to change the silver image into colored salts.|$|R
5000|$|In 1856, whilst {{trying to}} {{synthesise}} quinine, von Hofmann's student William Henry Perkin discovered mauveine {{and went into}} industry producing the first synthetic <b>dye.</b> Other <b>aniline</b> <b>dyes</b> followed, such as fuchsine, safranine, and induline. At the time of mauveine's discovery, aniline was expensive. Soon thereafter, applying a method reported in 1854 by Antoine Béchamp, it was prepared [...] "by the ton". [...] The Béchamp reduction enabled {{the evolution of a}} massive dye industry in Germany. Today, the name of BASF, originally Badische Anilin- und Soda-Fabrik (English: Baden Aniline and Soda Factory), now among the largest chemical suppliers, echoes the legacy of the synthetic dye industry, built via <b>aniline</b> <b>dyes</b> and extended via the related azo dyes. The first azo <b>dye</b> was <b>aniline</b> yellow.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} stages of flexography, <b>aniline</b> <b>dye</b> ink was used. Because of its toxicity, its use in food {{packaging}} was banned and it brought on complications due to frequent staining and the need for bleeding. Over time, changes and improvements were made, involving the substitution of <b>aniline</b> <b>dye</b> for polyamide resins which speed up the drying process and as such the overall printing process itself.|$|E

5000|$|Indelible pencils {{were the}} cause of {{significant}} health risks due {{to the presence of}} <b>aniline</b> <b>dyes.</b> Exposure to <b>aniline</b> <b>dyes</b> could lead to eczema, acne and carcinoma. Penetration of the pencil lead into the body commonly leads to severe and debilitating effects such as fever, anaemia, elevated white cell count, gastro-intestinal upset, kidney and liver damage, anorexia and necrosis of the tissue surrounding the wound. Such risks are not associated with ordinary graphite pencils. While these symptoms may appear after a couple of days they often develop only after weeks have passed since the injury was sustained. Surgery is required to remove the lead and the infected tissue and [...] "the necrotizing action may be so severe and extensive amputation is necessary".|$|R
