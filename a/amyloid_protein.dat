5|$|One area of {{clinical}} research {{is focused on}} treating the underlying disease pathology. Reduction of beta-amyloid levels is a common target of compounds (such as apomorphine) under investigation. Immunotherapy or vaccination for the <b>amyloid</b> <b>protein</b> is one treatment modality under study. Unlike preventative vaccination, the putative therapy {{would be used to}} treat people already diagnosed. It is based upon the concept of training the immune system to recognise, attack, and reverse deposition of amyloid, thereby altering the course of the disease. An example of such a vaccine under investigation was ACC-001, although the trials were suspended in 2008. Another similar agent is bapineuzumab, an antibody designed as identical to the naturally induced anti-amyloid antibody. However, immunotherapeutic agents have been found to cause some concerning adverse drug reactions, such as amyloid-related imaging abnormalities. Other approaches are neuroprotective agents, such as AL-108, and metal-protein interaction attenuation agents, such as PBT2. A TNFα receptor-blocking fusion protein, etanercept has showed encouraging results.|$|E

40|$|Cathepsin (Cath) B, CathK and CathL are {{cysteine}} proteases {{that participate}} in the lysosomal protein degradation system and are expressed in macrophages, epithelioid cells, and multinucleated histiocytic giant cells (MGCs). Both macrophages and MGCs are commonly found adjacent to immunoglobulin light chain -associated (AL) amyloid deposits, which {{raised the question of}} whether cysteine proteases are able to cleave AL <b>amyloid</b> <b>proteins</b> and AL <b>amyloid</b> deposits. The present study has investigated whether recombinant human CathB, CathK, and CathL are able to degrade AL(VlambdaVI) <b>amyloid</b> <b>proteins</b> and AL <b>amyloid</b> deposits. Using immunohistochemistry, CathB, CathK, and CathL were found adjacent to AL amyloid deposits. In vitro degradation experiments using purified AL <b>amyloid</b> <b>proteins</b> showed that CathB, CathK, and CathL degrade AL(VlambdaVI) <b>amyloid</b> <b>proteins.</b> Furthermore, using unfixed tissue sections from an amyloidotic spleen as an in vitro model for extracellular proteolysis of intact amyloid deposits, it was demonstrated that all three cysteine proteases are also capable of degrading AL amyloid in situ. This is the first study to show that cysteine proteases are able to cleave AL <b>amyloid</b> <b>proteins.</b> However, the efficiency with which proteolysis occurs depends on the concentration of active protease recruited at the sites of amyloid deposition, and possibly on the structure of the AL <b>amyloid</b> <b>proteins.</b> Copyright 2004 Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.

40|$|Dysregulation of the {{proteolytic}} {{processing of}} <b>amyloid</b> precursor <b>protein</b> by c-secretase {{and the ensuing}} generation of amyloid-b {{is associated with the}} pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease. Thus, the identification of <b>amyloid</b> precursor <b>protein</b> binding proteins involved in regulating processing of <b>amyloid</b> precursor <b>protein</b> by the c-secretase complex is essential for understanding the mechanisms underlying the molecular pathology of the disease. We identified calreticulin as novel <b>amyloid</b> precursor <b>protein</b> interaction partner that binds to the c-secretase cleavage site within <b>amyloid</b> precursor <b>protein</b> and showed that this Ca 2 +- and N-glycan-independent interaction is mediated by amino acids 330 – 344 in the C-terminal C-domain of calreticulin. Co-immunoprecipitation confirmed that calreticulin is not only associated with <b>amyloid</b> precursor <b>protein</b> but also with the c-secretase complex members presenilin and nicastrin. Calreticulin was detected at the cell surface by surface biotinylation of cells overexpressing <b>amyloid</b> precursor <b>protein</b> and was co-localized by immunostaining with <b>amyloid</b> precursor <b>protein</b> and presenilin at the cell surface of hippocampal neurons. The P-domain of calreticulin located between the N-terminal N-domain and the C-domain interacts with presenilin, the catalytic subunit of the c-secretase complex.

40|$|The <b>amyloid</b> beta <b>protein</b> (25 - 35) stimulated {{appearance}} of 3 H-inositol phosphates from [3 H]inositol-prelabeled LA-N- 2 cells was investigated. This stimulation was unaltered by extra- and intracellular calcium chelators in a calcium-free medium or by several protein kinase inhibitors. This phospholipase C stimulation by <b>amyloid</b> beta <b>protein</b> {{appeared to be}} pertussis toxin sensitive. It is possible that this phospholipase C stimulation by <b>amyloid</b> beta <b>protein</b> is a receptor-mediated process. This possibility is based on two related observations. The stimulation is ablated {{by the presence of}} conventional antagonists for metabotropic, adrenergic, and bombesin agonists. The IC 50 values were 12 microM for propranolol, 15 microM for AP- 3, and 25 nM for [Tyr 4,D-Phe 12]bombesin. Additional support comes from results of desensitization and resensitization experiments. <b>Amyloid</b> beta <b>protein</b> stimulation of phospholipase C was absent from LA-N- 2 cells previously treated with norepinephrine, trans- 1 -amino- 1, 3 -cyclopentanedicarboxylic acid (t-ACPD), bombesin, or amyloid beta peptide. In a similar manner, LA-N- 2 cells previously treated with <b>amyloid</b> beta <b>protein</b> were no longer responsive to norepinephrine, t-ACPD, or bombesin. The responsiveness to <b>amyloid</b> beta <b>protein</b> returned, subsequent to a period of resensitization for the individual agonists.

The presented data show that there is a constitutive release of secretory <b>amyloid</b> precursor <b>protein</b> from synaptosomes and suggest that (i) processing of <b>amyloid</b> precursor <b>protein</b> at the synaptic level is controlled by L-glutamate presumably via activation of protein kinase C, and (ii) isolated cortical synaptosomes represent a useful experimental approach to selectively study <b>amyloid</b> precursor <b>protein</b> metabolism at the synaptic level...|$|R

50|$|The {{most common}} cause of kidney failure in {{multiple}} myeloma is due to proteins secreted by the malignant cells. Myeloma cells produce monoclonal proteins of varying types, most commonly immunoglobulins (antibodies) and free light chains, resulting in abnormally high levels of these proteins in the blood. Depending on the size of these proteins, they may be excreted through the kidneys. Kidneys can be damaged by the tubulopathic effects of proteins or light chains. Increased bone resorption leads to hypercalcemia and causes nephrocalcinosis, thereby contributing to the kidney failure. Amyloidosis is a distant third in the causation. Patients with amyloidosis have high levels of <b>amyloid</b> <b>protein</b> that can be excreted through the kidneys and cause damage to the kidneys and other organs.|$|E
40|$|Summary: Fifty adults {{hospitalized with}} {{extensive}} burns {{formed the basis}} of the present study. Serum <b>amyloid</b> A <b>protein,</b> C-reactive protein, arantichymotrypsm and aracid glycoprotein were measured in serum samples taken on admission, and 3 and 7 days later. Fatal outcome was observed in 13 out of 14 (93 %) patients with serum <b>amyloid</b> A <b>protein</b> over 100 mg/ 1 on admission and in only 2 of the remaining 36 (6 %) patients with serum <b>amyloid</b> A <b>protein</b> below 100 mg/ 1. The median serum <b>amyloid</b> A <b>protein</b> concentration on admission in 15 patients with fatal outcome was 134 mg/ 1, and only 30 mg/ 1 in 35 patients who recovered (p < 0. 00005). As a reference value, the level of 100 mg serum <b>amyloid</b> A <b>protein</b> per litre on admission gave an evident predictive value (93 %) and sensitivity (87 %) for fatal outcome. The difference between serum <b>amyloid</b> A <b>protein</b> concentrations in patients with complications (median 642 mg/ 1) and those without complications (median 250 mg/ 1) was statistic-ally very significant (p = 0. 0003) three days after burn injury. The level of 400 mg/ 1 as a reference value 3 days after burn injury gave a reasonable predictive value (80 %) and sensitivity (74 %) for the development of postburn complications, but patients who died did not develop a hypermetabolic reaction and their serum <b>amyloid</b> A <b>protein</b> concentration remained below 400 mg/ 1, despite high serum <b>amyloid</b> A <b>protein</b> concentrations observed on admission (above 100 mg/ 1).

Of the patients included in the study, 29 who died had autopsies performed on their brains and in all but one the brain autopsy results matched the diagnosis based on the PET scan taken before death.

50|$|One {{chromosome}} 21 {{gene that}} might predispose Down syndrome individuals to develop Alzheimer's pathology is {{the gene that}} encodes the precursor of the <b>amyloid</b> <b>protein.</b> Neurofibrillary tangles and amyloid plaques are commonly found in both Down syndrome and Alzheimer's individuals. Layer II of the entorhinal cortex and the subiculum, both critical for memory consolidation, are among the first affected by the damage. A gradual {{decrease in the number}} of nerve cells throughout the cortex follows. A few years ago, Johns Hopkins scientists created a genetically engineered mouse called Ts65Dn (segmental trisomy 16 mouse) as an excellent model for studying the Down syndrome. Ts65Dn mouse has genes on chromosomes 16 that are very similar to the human chromosome 21 genes. Recently, researchers have used this transgenic mouse to connect APP to cognitive problems among the mice.|$|E
50|$|The amyloid {{hypothesis}} is initially compelling because {{the gene for}} the amyloid beta precursor APP is located on chromosome 21, and patients with trisomy 21 - better known as Down syndrome - who thus have an extra gene copy almost universally exhibit AD-like disorders by 40 years of age. The traditional formulation of the amyloid hypothesis points to the cytotoxicity of mature aggregated amyloid fibrils, which {{are believed to be}} the toxic form of the protein responsible for disrupting the cell's calcium ion homeostasis and thus inducing apoptosis. This {{hypothesis is}} supported by the observation that higher levels of a variant of the beta <b>amyloid</b> <b>protein</b> known to form fibrils faster in vitro correlate with earlier onset and greater cognitive impairment in mouse models and with AD diagnosis in humans. However, mechanisms for the induced calcium influx, or proposals for alternative cytotoxic mechanisms, by mature fibrils are not obvious.|$|E

40|$|Any {{explanation}} {{of the causes of}} Alzheimer's disease and of its unique cerebral pathologic features must take into account the distribution and ultrastructural localization of the pre-A 4 <b>amyloid</b> <b>proteins</b> in tissues and organs. The authors have analyzed the expression of the pre-A 4 <b>amyloid</b> <b>proteins</b> in several tissues by immunogold electron microscopy and by immunofluorescence. For this purpose, they have used a mouse monoclonal antibody and a guinea pig antiserum raised against two synthetic peptides corresponding to two different sequences common to all the full-length forms of the A 4 amyloid precursors. They observed a tissue-specific distribution of the secreted and the transmembrane form of the precursors. The authors could determine that the secreted form is generated in vivo within the cytoplasm. In the salivary glands and in the adenohypophysis, all the immunoreactivity is associated with the process of secretion, whereas in the muscle, a staining pattern compatible with the presence of the pre-A 4 <b>amyloid</b> <b>proteins</b> in the sarcoplasmic reticulum has been observed. This difference in the localization may reflect tissue-specific processing pathways and suggests that posttranslational modifications such as proteolytic removal of the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains contribute to the structural and thus functional diversity of the A 4 amyloid precursors...|$|R
40|$|The {{abnormal}} fibrillation {{of human}} islet amyloid polypeptide (hIAPP) has {{been implicated in}} the development of type II diabetes.

In the present work, we sought to view insight into the structures and properties of Al(III) and EGCG complex by using spectroscopic experiments and quantum chemical calculations and also investigated the influence of Al(III) and EGCG on hIAPP fibrillation and aggregation as well as their combined interference on this process. Our studies demonstrated that Al(III) could promote fibrillation and aggregation of hIAPP, while EGCG could inhibit the fibrillation of hIAPP and lead to the formation of hIAPP amorphous aggregates instead of the ordered fibrils. Furthermore, we proved that the Al(III) /EGCG complex in molar ratio of 1 [*]:[*] 1 as Al(EGCG) (H 2 O) 2 could inhibit the hIAPP fibrillation more effectively than EGCG alone. The results provide the invaluable reference for the new drug development to treat type II diabetes...|$|R
