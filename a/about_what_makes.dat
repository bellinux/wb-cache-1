In the magazine, he notices an ad for a children's contest in which an essay must be written <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>makes</b> America great. Lisa chooses to enter, takes a trip to Springfield Forest, and is inspired to write her essay when she sees the forest's natural beauty and when an eagle lands right by the branch she is sitting under. Lisa's article is approved for entry in the national finals in Washington, D.C. after the contest judge observes Homer's poor vocabulary and realizes that he could not have written Lisa's essay for her.|$|E

500|$|During the 90s, new manga author Masashi Kishimoto {{sought to}} write a {{one-shot}} chapter that would feature Naruto as a chef, but this version {{never made it to}} print. Kishimoto originally wanted to make Naruto a child who could transform into a fox, so he created a one-shot of Naruto for the summer 1997 issue of Akamaru Jump magazine based on the idea. For the serialized version, Kishimoto incorporated traits he felt made an ideal hero in the creation of Naruto: a straightforward way of thinking, a mischievous side, and attributes possessed by Goku from the Dragon Ball franchise. Aiming to keep Naruto [...] "simple and stupid", Kishimoto avoided modeling him after anyone in particular, instead conceiving of him as naïve with a dark side resulting from his harsh past. Despite this, he is always optimistic, a trait Kishimoto said makes this character unique. By and large, Naruto's personality is childish; the creator tried to convey this trait in his illustrations. Kishimoto notes as an example of this the cover of volume 10, where Kishimoto depicts Naruto mimicking a turtle as a child might do. Naruto was Kishimoto's first published manga, and he focused on making Naruto's facial expressions consistent in difficult situations. He commented: [...] "It's rather awkward to talk <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>makes</b> Naruto appealing to audiences, but I think his being a knucklehead gives him an appeal." [...] He believed it was Naruto's losses that made readers identify with him, although he wanted Naruto not to feel defeat again, which was his primary aim when writing the series. Kishimoto has said that Naruto's burning desire to be a ninja was based on his own ambition to succeed as a manga artist.|$|E

60|$|In estimating, therefore, {{the ground}} of Scott's pre-eminence in romance we must {{absolutely}} rid ourselves {{of the notion that}} romance or adventure are merely materialistic things involved in the tangle of a plot or the multiplicity of drawn swords. We must remember that it is, like tragedy or farce, a state of the soul, and that, for some dark and elemental reason which we can never understand, this state of the soul is evoked in us by the sight of certain places or the contemplation of certain human crises, by a stream rushing under a heavy and covered wooden bridge, or by a man plunging a knife or sword into tough timber. In the selection of these situations which catch the spirit of romance as in a net, Scott has never been equalled or even approached. His finest scenes affect us like fragments of a hilarious dream. They have the same quality which is often possessed by those nocturnal comedies--that of seeming more human than our waking life--even while they are less possible. Sir Arthur Wardour, with his daughter and the old beggar crouching in a cranny of the cliff as night falls and the tide closes around them, are actually in the coldest and bitterest of practical situations. Yet the whole incident has a quality that can only be called boyish. It is warmed with all the colours of an incredible sunset. Rob Roy trapped in the Tolbooth, and confronted with Bailie Nicol Jarvie, draws no sword, leaps from no window, affects none of the dazzling external acts upon which contemporary romance depends, yet that plain and humorous dialogue is full of the essential philosophy of romance which is an almost equal betting upon man and destiny. Perhaps the most profoundly thrilling of all Scott's situations is that in which the family of Colonel Mannering are waiting for the carriage {{which may or may not}} arrive by night to bring an unknown man into a princely possession. Yet almost the whole of that thrilling scene consists of a ridiculous conversation about food, and flirtation between a frivolous old lawyer and a fashionable girl. We can say nothing <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>makes</b> these scenes, except that the wind bloweth where it listeth, and that here the wind blows strong.|$|E

40|$|Because {{important}} {{foreign policy}} decisions are usually crafted by {{small groups of}} policymakers, {{it is important to}} examine the effects of group dynamics and features of groups on the choices those groups make. The effects of one group feature, the extent to which groups experience internal conflict or controversy <b>about</b> <b>what</b> choices to <b>make,</b> on the decisions those groups make is examined in the context of Repeated Prisoner’s Dilemma (RPD) games. Results suggests that groups of experimental subjects that experience conflict or controversy within the group <b>about</b> <b>what</b> decision to <b>make</b> are significantly more likely to make competitive (non-cooperative) choices in the RPD context. However, we know when policymakers are engaged in making repeated policy decisions, that group choice is strongly affected by prior policy outcomes and how the group evaluates those outcomes. Not surprisingly, additional analysis indicates that the strength and direction of the relationship between intra-group conflict and group choice varies depending upon specific prior outcomes. ...|$|R
