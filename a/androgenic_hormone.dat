5|$|The main {{hormonal}} {{driver of}} oily sebum {{production in the}} skin is dihydrotestosterone. Another <b>androgenic</b> <b>hormone</b> responsible for increased sebaceous gland activity is DHEA-S. Higher amounts of DHEA-S are secreted during adrenarche (a stage of puberty), and this leads {{to an increase in}} sebum production. In a sebum-rich skin environment, the naturally occurring and largely commensal skin bacterium P. acnes readily grows and can cause inflammation within and around the follicle due to activation of the innate immune system. P. acnes triggers skin inflammation in acne by increasing the production of several pro-inflammatory chemical signals (such as IL-1α, IL-8, TNF-α, and LTB4); IL-1α is known to be essential to comedo formation.|$|E

50|$|Individuals {{who have}} {{cirrhosis}} or chronic liver disease may develop gynecomastia for several reasons. Cirrhotics {{tend to have}} increased secretion of the <b>androgenic</b> <b>hormone</b> androstenedione from the adrenal glands, increased conversion of this hormone into various types of estrogen, and increased levels of SHBG, which leads to decreased blood levels of free testosterone. Approximately 10-40% of individuals with Graves disease (a common form of hyperthyroidism) experience gynecomastia. Increased conversion of testosterone to estrogen by increased aromatase activity, increased levels of SHBG and increased production of testosterone and estradiol by the testes due to elevated levels of LH cause the gynecomastia.

40|$|To {{assess the}} effect of urinary {{bisphenol}} A (BPA) on repeated measurements of <b>androgenic</b> <b>hormones</b> and metabolic indices, we used {{multivariate analysis of variance}} (MANOVA) adjusted for potential confounders at baseline. During July to August 2011, 80 preadolescent girls enrolled in the Ewha Birth & Growth Cohort study participated in a follow-up study and then forty-eight of them (60. 0 %) came back one year later. Baseline levels of estradiol and androstenedione were higher in the BPA group than in the non-BPA group. One year later, girls in the high BPA exposure group showed higher levels of androstenedione, testosterone, estradiol, and insulin, and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) index, than those in the other groups (p < 0. 05). In MANOVA, estradiol and androstenedione showed significant differences among groups, while dehydroepiandrosterone, insulin, and HOMA-IR showed marginally significant differences. Exposure to BPA may affect endocrine metabolism in preadolescents.

40|$|SYNOPSIS. The {{androgenic}} gland {{has been}} described {{in a variety of}} crustacean species—isopods, amphipods and decapods. It has been shown {{to play a role in}} the regulation of male differentiation and in the inhibition of female differentiation. Upon its application for endocrine manipulation, it inhibits female characteristics. Recently, the <b>androgenic</b> <b>hormone</b> from the isopod Armadillidium vulgare was purified and characterized on the basis of a morphological bioassay. The hormone is a glycosylated protein composed of two peptide chains connected each to the other by two disulfide bridges. The pro-hormone consists of the same two chains connected by a third peptide in a complex that resembles the insulin super family hormones. The study of the androgenic gland in decapods lags behind that in the isopods, and a decapod <b>androgenic</b> <b>hormone</b> has yet to be identified. In this review, five decapod species are described as models, in which the androgenic gland exerts morphological, anatomical, physiological and behavioral effects. These models could serve as the basis of possible bioassays for the study of the structure and mode of action of the <b>androgenic</b> <b>hormone</b> in decapod crustaceans...|$|E

40|$|Objective: Acne vulgaris {{is one of}} {{the most}} common skin disorders, and is a multifactorial disease {{characterized}} by androgenic stimulation of sebaceous glands. This study aimed to further understand the antiandrogenic effects of isotretinoin by using isotretinoin, cyproterone acetate/ethynil estradiol (CTA/EE) and isotretinoin+CTA/EE combination treatments with analyzing their effects on serum androgenic hormon levels. Materials and methods: 60 females that were clinically evaluated as grade 4 - 8 on Allen-Smith scale were selected from our patient population for whom isotretinoin, CTA/EE and isotretinoin+CTA/EE combination treatment was planned. Fasting <b>androgenic</b> <b>hormone</b> levels (androstenedion, luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), dehidroepiandrosteron sulfate (DHEAS), free and total testosterone) were detected in venous blood before treatment and on the third and the sixth month of study. Results: The statistical analysis showed that similar to the CTA/EE treatment; the decrease of the serum androstenedion and free testosterone levels with isotretinoin treatment in females with acne vulgaris were found to be statistically significant (p 0, 0056). There is no statistically significant change in LH/FSH ratio in isotretinoin monotherapy, so as in CTA/EE treatment (p> 0, 0056). Conclusion: Our study demonstrates isotretinoin monotherapy made us to think that antiandrogenic effect may be one of the pathways of antiacne effect of isotretinoin. No statistically significant correlation was found between the severity of acne vulgaris and the <b>androgenic</b> <b>hormone</b> levels...|$|E

40|$|Bilateral {{ablation}} of the corpora cardiaca and corpora allata of larval Lampyris noctiluca {{may result}} in sexual inversion. Larval males operated at a time near to the third molt (molt of sexual differentiation) become females. The operation does not, however, result in sexual inversion in older larval males (5 th stage) or in any larval females (4 th, 5 th, and 6 th stages). It is suggested that the feminization of young larval males results from a "feminization" of the pars intercerebralis. A hypothesis regarding the endocrine control of male differentiation is proposed. It is suggested that genetic sex determination produces a specific activity in some neurosecretory cells of the pars intercerebralis, and that this induces {{the formation of the}} testicular apical tissue which {{is the source of the}} <b>androgenic</b> <b>hormone.</b> No such endocrine control has so far been revealed in females. © 1966.

40|$|The {{crustacean}} male-specific androgenic gland (AG) regulates sexual differentiation. In the prawn Macrobrachium rosenbergii, silencing an AG-specific insulin-like encoding transcript (Mr-IAG) inhibited {{the development}} of male sexual characters, suggesting that Mr-IAG is a key <b>androgenic</b> <b>hormone.</b> We used recombinant pro-Mr-IAG peptide to generate antibodies that recognized the peptide in AG cells and extracts, as verified by mass spectrometry. We revealed the temporal expression pattern of Mr-IAG and studied its relevance to the timetable of sex differentiation processes in juveniles and after puberty. Mr-IAG was expressed from as early as 20 days after metamorphosis, prior to the appearance of external male sexual characters. Mr-IAG expression was lower in the less reproductively active orange-clawed males than in both the dominant blue-clawed males and the actively sneak mating small males. These results suggest a role for Mr-IAG both in the timing of male sexual differentiation and in regulating reproductive strategies...|$|E
40|$|Background: Androgen {{insensitivity}} syndrome (AIS) {{is a rare}} X-linked disorder due to {{mutations in}} the androgen receptor (AR) gene causing end-organ resistance to the <b>androgenic</b> <b>hormone.</b> Subjects and Methods: Genetic {{studies were carried out}} in two families by karyotype and targeted exome sequencing of the AR gene. Results: Two novel missense mutations were identified, p. L 822 P and p. P 392 S, in two families with complete androgen insensitivity (CAIS) and partial androgen insensitivity (PAIS), respectively. Both had 46, XY karyotype. The mother was a heterozygous carrier in PAIS and negative in CAIS. These two were novel mutations, reported for the first time, in the AR gene. In silico analysis predicted that both mutations were damaging. We reviewed the various reported Indian mutations in the AR gene. Conclusion: AR gene mutations cause a wide spectrum of disorders from CAIS to male infertility or primary amenorrhea. Early diagnosis is essential for gender assignment and further management, family counseling, and prenatal diagnosis...|$|E
40|$|Benzene is a {{frequently}} used industrial solvent. Its toxic manifestations could be modified by sex hormones, but mechanisms of their action are poorly understood. We {{have examined the}} influence of progesterone on lipid peroxidation (malondialdehyde), reduced glutathione (GSH), and cytochrome P 450 2 E 1 (CYP 2 E 1) in the liver and kidneys of female rats. Progesterone applied to benzene-treated rats inhibited the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), but in ovariectomised benzene-treated rats it significantly increased GSH in the liver. No improvement in CYP 2 E 1 activity was observed in progesterone treated rats. Our results evidence that progesterone changes benzene toxicity (generation of ROS, oxidative stress).
