500|$|Joel Bullock from The Coaster Critic and Mike from NewsPlusNotes both {{praised the}} g-forces {{experienced}} while {{going through the}} helix, {{and the amount of}} airtime Goliath has. Bullock described Goliath as, [...] "not only the park’s best roller coaster, but arguably the best coaster in the South East (south of Virginia)." [...] Mike Collins from Coaster Radio particularly enjoyed the section of the roller coaster that takes riders outside of the park boundaries. He also said that, [...] " [...] a fun and fast coaster. It’s all about the airtime... <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> lot of it." ...|$|E
500|$|GamePro did {{not find}} the game worthy of its name, {{although}} the cutscenes were praised, stating, [...] "The cinemas {{at the opening of}} the game and between each level are stunning; however, the game graphics, particularly buildings and enemies, are lackluster at best. The sound effects are bland, and there are no weapon power-ups to be found. Put that all together <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> very generic game." [...] Next Generation criticized the game for being tedious, but recognized that it is still an enjoyable game. Computer and Video Games offered similar criticism, declaring that [...] "it was too repetitive to become anything more than a good game." [...] Edge criticized the gameplay features such as camera control and boss difficulty. Electronic Gaming Monthly reviewers criticized the game for its easy bosses and its repetitive and short gameplay value. Famitsu liked the battles but complained about the Fuchikoma attaching to walls when not intended.|$|E

500|$|The {{majority}} of the suits were designed using ZBrush. A scan of an actor's body was taken, which was then encased to decipher the fabric, {{the location of the}} foam, amongst other concerns. With a computer numerical cutting of dense foam, a small scale output would be created to perfect fine details before initiating construction of the suit. Upon downloading the participant's body scan, the illustrations were overlaid to provide an output manufacturing element. Describing the computer numerical cutting process, Chris Lavery of Clothes on Film noted that it had a tendency to elicit bubbles and striations. Clark stated: [...] "The [...] suit is all made of a hexagon mesh which we also printed and made the fabric from 3D files. This would go onto the hard form; it would go inside the mould which was silicon matrix. We would put those together and then inject foam into the negative space. The wiring harness is embedded into the mould <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> torso. We then paint it and that’s your finished suit." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{standard}} {{version of the}} album contains ten tracks and the deluxe edition adds three acoustic versions as bonus tracks. Editions of the album sold at Walmart stores in North America feature a censored version of [...] "The Devil Beneath My Feet". Manson later criticized the store and its gun sales policy, categorizing Walmart in an Australian interview as [...] "that store in America which sells guns to kids but won't sell R-rated lyrics." [...] Manson went on to joke that he might [...] "do a signing at a Walmart store where I just sign guns, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> free record with it {{when you buy a}} gun." [...] American CD versions of the album were packaged with black polycarbonate discs identical to those used by Sony for the original PlayStation in the early 1990s; the discs were sourced by Brian Schuman of Concord Music from the same plant Sony used. A heat-sensitive thermal texture was added to the CD, so that it appeared black when first opened but revealed a white pattern when exposed to the heat from a CD player.|$|E

2500|$|IGN's Robert Canning {{thought it}} was a fun episode, and said that it [...] "helped that the major flashbacks {{involved}} took place in a fantasy world as to not effect the whole of the show. But even in those flashbacks, the jokes stayed true to what we know of the series. Add to that the great new look of the series <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> memorable episode from season twenty of The Simpsons." [...] Erich Asperschlager of TV Verdict said he had always liked flashback and alternate future episodes, and he thought [...] "Take My Life, Please" [...] put them together in a [...] "clever way". He added: [...] "Maybe it’s all the shiny newness, but I thought {{this was one of the}} best episodes this season. It took full advantage of the new widescreen format to cram in a ton of background detail and blink-and-you’ll-miss-’em jokes. The finale dragged a bit, and they could have spent more time with the surreality of Homer’s almost-the-same alternate past, but those are minor quibbles." ...|$|E

Can you imagine working for a fucking year, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> B+ from some asshole in The Village Voice?" [...] Christgau rated the album C+ and wrote in his review, [...] "I thank Lou for pronouncing my name right." [...] In December 1980, Christgau provoked angry responses from Voice readers when his column approvingly quoted his wife Carola Dibbell's reaction {{to the murder of}} John Lennon: [...] "Why is it always Bobby Kennedy or John Lennon? Why isn't it Richard Nixon or Paul McCartney?" [...] Similar angst came from Sonic Youth in their song [...] "Kill Yr Idols" [...] (at the time known as [...] "I Killed Christgau with My Big Fucking Dick"), in which they sing [...] "I don't know why / You wanna impress Christgau / Ah let that shit die / And find out the new goal"; Christgau responded by saying [...] "Idolization is for rock stars, even rock stars manqué like these impotent bohos—critics just want a little respect. So if it's not too hypersensitive of me, I wasn't flattered to hear my name pronounced right, not on this particular title track." ...|$|E
2500|$|Bale had initial {{concerns}} about playing Batman, {{as he felt}} more ridiculous than intimidating in the Batsuit. He dealt with this by depicting Batman as a savage beast. To attain {{a deeper understanding of}} the character, Bale read various Batman comic books. He explained his interpretation of the young boy: [...] "Batman is his hidden, demonic rage-filled side. The creature Batman creates is an absolutely sincere creature and one that he has to control but does so in a very haphazard way. He's capable of enacting violence— and to kill— so he's constantly having to rein himself in." [...] For Bale, the most gruelling part about playing Batman was the suit. [...] "You stick it on, you get hot, you sweat <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> headache in the mask ... But I'm not going to bitch about it because I get to play Batman", he said. Bale trained in Wing Chun Kung Fu under Eric Oram in preparation for the movie. When promoting the film in interviews and public events, Bale retained an American accent to avoid confusion. Batman Begins was released in the U.S. on 15 June 2005 and was a U.S. and international triumph for Warner Bros., costing approximately US$135 million to produce and taking in over US$370 million in returns worldwide. Bale's performance was well received by critics and fans alike, earning him the Saturn Award for Best Actor and the Best Hero award at the 2006 MTV Movie Awards. He also provided his voice and likeness for the video game adaptation of the film.|$|E

2500|$|The {{film was}} met with {{critical}} acclaim upon its release. In his 1977 review, Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times called the film [...] "an out-of-body experience", compared its special effects to those of , and opined that the true strength of the film was its [...] "pure narrative". Vincent Canby of The New York Times called the film [...] "the movie that's going to entertain a lot of contemporary folk who have {{a soft spot for}} the virtually ritualized manners of comic-book adventure" [...] and [...] "the most elaborate, most expensive, most beautiful movie serial ever made." [...] A.D. Murphy of Variety described the film as [...] "magnificent" [...] and claimed George Lucas had succeeded in his attempt to create the [...] "biggest possible adventure fantasy" [...] based on the serials and older action epics from his childhood. Writing for The Washington Post, Gary Arnold gave the film a positive review, writing that the film [...] "is a new classic in a rousing movie tradition: a space swashbuckler." [...] However, the film was not without its detractors: Pauline Kael of The New Yorker criticized Star Wars, stating that [...] "there's no breather in the picture, no lyricism", and that it had no [...] "emotional grip". [...] John Simon of New York magazine also panned the film and wrote, [...] "Strip Star Wars of its often striking images and its highfalutin scientific jargon, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> story, characters, and dialogue of overwhelming banality." [...] Stanley Kauffmann, reviewing the film in The New Republic, opined that it [...] "was made for those (particularly males) who carry a portable shrine within them of their adolescence, a chalice of a Self that was Better Then, before the world's affairs or—in any complex way—sex intruded." ...|$|E
