5|$|Cameroonian {{literature}} has concentrated on both European and African themes. Colonial-era {{writers such as}} Louis-Marie Pouka and Sankie Maimo were educated by European missionary societies and advocated <b>assimilation</b> into European culture as the means to bring Cameroon into the modern world. After World War II, writers such as Mongo Beti and Ferdinand Oyono analysed and criticised colonialism and rejected <b>assimilation.</b>|$|E
5|$|During the {{communist}} era, rapid urbanization {{and growth of}} heavy industry occurred. Whole villages in the coal mining areas were destroyed by the mining activity. These conditions quickened the <b>assimilation</b> of the Poles. Another cause of <b>assimilation</b> was {{the high rate of}} intermarriage. Besides Poles belonging to the minority, many more commuted across the border from Polish People's Republic to work in Czechoslovakia or {{to take advantage of the}} relative abundance of consumer goods in Czechoslovakia.|$|E
5|$|Archaea {{carry out}} many {{steps in the}} {{nitrogen}} cycle. This includes both reactions that remove nitrogen from ecosystems (such as nitrate-based respiration and denitrification) as well as processes that introduce nitrogen (such as nitrate <b>assimilation</b> and nitrogen fixation).|$|E
5000|$|In the Kabyle {{language}} {{there are}} various accents which {{are the result of}} <b>assimilations</b> (these accents are generally divided into western and eastern Kabyle).

5|$|Ecological {{evolutionary}} {{developmental biology}} (eco-evo-devo) integrates research from developmental biology and ecology {{to examine their}} relationship with evolutionary theory.

5|$|In 1939, Hitler and Mussolini {{resolved}} {{the problem of}} self-determination of Germans and maintaining the Brenner Pass frontier by an agreement in which German South Tyroleans were given the choice of either <b>assimilation</b> into Italian culture, or leave South Tyrol for Germany; most opted to leave for Germany.|$|E
50|$|Although {{all four}} occur, changes {{in regard to}} a {{following}} adjacent segment account for virtually all assimilatory changes (and most of the regular ones). <b>Assimilations</b> to an adjacent segment are vastly more frequent than <b>assimilations</b> to a non-adjacent one. These radical asymmetries might contain hints about the mechanisms involved, but they are unobvious.|$|R

5|$|Kneale had {{fourteen}} years earlier adapted George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four {{as a classic}} and controversial BBC broadcast and the play reflects much of Kneale's <b>assimilation</b> of Orwell's concern {{about the power of}} the media and Kneale's experience of the evolving media industry.|$|E
5|$|Magmatic {{processes}} {{important in}} the Central Andes include the partial melting of the subducting plate and its sediments and of mantle peridotite, and fractional crystallization in the crust. Large scale <b>assimilation</b> of the crust has not been reported at Lastarria.|$|E
5|$|The Polish {{population}} is historically declining. This is primarily caused by low natural birth rate, <b>assimilation,</b> high intermarriage rate (the majority of Poles live in mixed relationships), and migration {{to other parts}} of the country as a result of job seeking.|$|E
50|$|<b>Assimilations</b> {{are common}} in Gheg but {{are not part of}} the Albanian {{literary}} language, which is a standardized form of Tosk Albanian.|$|R
25|$|Initial {{mutations}} {{must not}} be confused with <b>assimilations</b> that may occur in compound words (such as, for instance, in the Sindarin names Araphor, Arassuil and Caradhras).|$|R
50|$|Alternatively, as {{a result}} of her <b>assimilations,</b> Mut is {{sometimes}} depicted as a cobra, a cat, a cow, or as a lioness as well as the vulture.|$|R
5|$|The caste {{structure}} of the majority Sinhalese has also accommodated Hindu immigrants from South India since the 13th century CE. This {{led to the emergence}} of three new Sinhalese caste groups: the Salagama, the Durava and the Karava. The Hindu migration and <b>assimilation</b> continued until the 18th century CE.|$|E
5|$|There {{are also}} {{arguments}} against polyethnicity, {{as well as}} the <b>assimilation</b> of ethnicities in polyethnic regions. Wilmot Robertson in The Ethnostate and Dennis L. Thomson in The Political Demands of Isolated Indian Bands in British Columbia, argue for some level of separatism.|$|E
5|$|While {{in control}} of Belgium, France and the Netherlands each tried to force <b>assimilation</b> of their {{national}} languages, but in neither case did their rule last {{long enough for the}} language to become fully entrenched across the region or for local dialects to be displaced.|$|E

5|$|An {{example of}} <b>assimilation</b> {{took place in}} Maharashtra, where a {{regional}} deity named Khandoba is a patron deity of farming and herding castes. The foremost center of worship of Khandoba in Maharashtra is in Jejuri. Khandoba has been assimilated {{as a form of}} Shiva himself, in which case he is worshipped {{in the form of a}} lingam. Khandoba's varied associations also include an identification with Surya and Karttikeya.|$|E
5|$|Charles {{believed}} {{it was very important}} to assimilate the new Swedish territories of Scania, Blekinge, Halland, in southern Sweden; Bohuslän in western Sweden and Jämtland, in northern Sweden, and the island of Gotland.

5|$|Historically, {{the largest}} ethnic group inhabiting the Zaolzie area was the Poles. During the 19th century {{the number of}} Germans grew. At the {{beginning}} of the 20th century and later from 1920 to 1938, the Czech population grew significantly (mainly as a result of immigration and the <b>assimilation</b> of locals) and the Poles became a minority, which they are to this day.|$|E
5|$|In 1658, {{shortly after}} the Swedish general Printzenskiöld was sent to Bornholm to start the <b>assimilation</b> process, the {{population}} of Bornholm rebelled. Led by Jens Kofoed and Poul Anker, the rebellion formed {{in the town of}} Hasle, north of the largest city, Rønne.
