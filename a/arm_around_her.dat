5|$|Meanwhile, Pete Miller (Jake Lacy) teaches Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) {{about his}} {{favorite}} movie, Die Hard, {{and attempts to}} recite all the dialogue from memory while an impressed Erin checks his accuracy using an online transcript. Andy Bernard (Ed Helms), who is still away in the Caribbean after sailing his family's boat, emails Erin and {{says that he is}} going to stay for a few weeks. Hurt, Erin decides to watch Die Hard with Pete rather than just hear him quote it. While watching the movie, Erin begins to cry and Pete tries to comfort her by placing his <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>her.</b> In the meantime, Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) tells Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate) about the Scranton Strangler case he was on. After boring her for what is implied to be several hours, she hushes him, before gently kissing him. Toby then whips off his glasses and kisses her back.|$|E
500|$|Critics {{and fans}} responded {{negatively}} to the episode's final sequence. Taylor described getting adverse fan mail {{about the lack}} of sympathy expressed by Voyagers crew members for Torres in the ending. She clarified that Chakotay's response to Torres was intended to be unresponsive rather than cold, and acknowledged that he should have [...] "put his <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> and show some warmth" [...] as suggested by fans. Green was surprised that Torres was not given a pep talk by either Captain Kathryn Janeway (Kate Mulgrew) or Chakotay in the final scene. Epsicokhan, on the other hand, found the lack of answers from Chakotay to be an appropriate ending given the focus on Torres' personal conflicts.|$|E
500|$|The {{next morning}} in the East Room, Nixon gave a {{televised}} 20-minute farewell speech to the White House staff, during which time he read from Theodore Roosevelt's biography and praised his own parents. The First Lady could hardly contain her tears; she was most upset about the cameras, because they recorded her anguish, as they had during the 1960 election defeat. The Nixons walked onto the Executive Mansion's South Lawn with Vice President Gerald Ford and Betty Ford. The outgoing president would depart from the White House on Marine One. As the family walked towards the helicopter, Pat, with one <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> husband's waist and one around Betty's, said to Betty, [...] "You'll see many of these red carpets, and you'll get so you hate 'em." [...] The helicopter transported them to Andrews Air Force Base; from there they flew to California.|$|E

500|$|Two {{young female}} millworkers in 1873 Maine visit the town's {{carousel}} after work. One of them, Julie Jordan, attracts {{the attention of}} the barker, Billy Bigelow ("The Carousel Waltz"). [...] When Julie lets Billy put his <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> during the ride, Mrs. Mullin, the widowed owner of the carousel, tells Julie never to return. Julie and her friend, Carrie Pipperidge, argue with Mrs. Mullin. [...] Billy arrives and, seeing that Mrs. Mullin is jealous, mocks her; he is fired from his job. Billy, unconcerned, invites Julie to join him for a drink. As he goes to get his belongings, Carrie presses Julie about her feelings toward him, but Julie is evasive ("You're a Queer One, Julie Jordan"). Carrie has a beau too, fisherman Enoch Snow ("(When I Marry) Mister Snow"), to whom she is newly engaged. [...] Billy returns for Julie as the departing Carrie warns that staying out late means the loss of Julie's job. Mr. Bascombe, owner of the mill, happens by along with a policeman, and offers to escort Julie to her home, but she refuses and is fired. Left alone, she and Billy talk about what life might be like if they were in love, but neither quite confesses to the growing attraction they feel for each other ("If I Loved You").|$|E
500|$|McKinley {{had been}} given nutritive enemas; on September 11, he took some broth by mouth. [...] When it seemed to do him good, the {{following}} morning they allowed him toast, coffee, and chicken broth. [...] His subsequent pain was diagnosed as indigestion; he was given purgatives and most doctors left after their evening consultation. [...] In the early morning of September 13, McKinley suffered a collapse. [...] Urgent word to return to Buffalo was sent to Vice President Roosevelt, [...] from the nearest telegraph or telephone in the Adirondack wilderness; a park ranger was sent to find him. [...] Specialists were summoned; although at first some doctors hoped that McKinley might survive with a weakened heart, by afternoon they knew the case was hopeless. As yet unknown to the doctors, gangrene was growing {{on the walls of}} his stomach and toxins were passing into his blood. [...] McKinley drifted {{in and out of consciousness}} all day; when awake he was the model patient. [...] By evening, McKinley too knew he was dying, [...] "It is useless, gentlemen. I think we ought to have prayer." [...] His friends and family were admitted, and the First Lady sobbed over him, [...] "I want to go, too. [...] I want to go, too." [...] Her husband replied, [...] "We are all going, we are all going. [...] God's will be done, not ours" [...] and with final strength put an <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>her.</b> [...] He may also have sung part of his favorite hymn, [...] "Nearer, My God, to Thee", although other accounts have her singing it softly to him. [...] Ida McKinley was led away, her place briefly taken by Senator Hanna. [...] Morgan recounts their final encounter, [...] "Sometime that terrible evening, Mark Hanna had approached the bedside, tears standing in his eyes, his hands and head shaking in disbelief that thirty years of friendship could end thus." [...] When a tentative, formal greeting gained no coherent response, Hanna [...] "cried out over the years of friendship, 'William, William, don't you know me?'" ...|$|E
500|$|When Leigh {{returned}} from the beach, she was bleeding between her legs, distressed, crying and seeking assistance. Some people at the party reported trying to console Leigh {{and find out what}} had happened to her; Leigh [...] "asserted she had been raped", replying [...] " [...] fucked me" [...] and [...] "I hate him". After witnessing Leigh's complaints, Webster is quoted as saying to a group of boys [...] "she's a bit of a slut and why don't all of us have a go". Nineteen-year-old Guy Wilson then approached Leigh, placed his <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> and asked her for sex. Wilson pushed Leigh to the ground when she refused, and was joined by Webster and around ten other boys who surrounded Leigh. They yelled abuse, kicked her, poured beer on her and spat both beer and saliva on her. Several people witnessed the assault, yet nobody came to help her or attempted to contact the police, her parents or other adults. The assaults continued for approximately five minutes; Leigh stood up when they stopped and staggered away before picking up an empty beer bottle and throwing it at the group of boys, missing them. Guy Wilson threw a beer bottle back at her as she left, which either hit her in the leg or missed, according to different witness accounts. The group of boys followed her inside the crowded clubhouse where she sought refuge, and similar assaults continued. Leigh was seen leaving the club and walking towards the beach at about 10:30pm. Leigh's stepfather arrived at the party to pick her up at 10:50pm. He and several of the party-goers searched for Leigh, but she could not be found. After repeated search attempts, Leigh's mother and stepfather decided to wait for her to return home, assuming she had gone to a friend's house for the night. Leigh's stepfather recommenced the search for Leigh the following morning, aided by several youths from the party. Her body was found in the sand dunes about [...] north of the surf club. Leigh's invitation to attend the party was still in her pocket.|$|E

60|$|And then {{he sort of}} stumbles {{across the}} room, and goes down on his knees, and gets his <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>her.</b>|$|R
2500|$|At first [...] gave no reply. He {{carefully}} weighed {{all that}} she had said. Then slowly he placed his <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>her.</b> She allowed him to do so. Then he promised her that {{all the things she}} wished for she would have. She would have a house in the west on the shimmering water. She would have gems, and animals. They would dwell together in harmony.|$|E
2500|$|His {{interest}} in music kept him on friendly terms with female musicians including pianist Moura Lympany. When Heath was Prime Minister she {{was approached by}} the Conservative MP Tufton Beamish, who said: [...] "Moura, Ted must get married. Will you marry him?" [...] She said she would have done but {{was in love with}} someone else. She later said the most intimate thing Heath had done was to put his <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> shoulder.|$|E
2500|$|He infamously {{identified}} {{a picture of}} a heavily muddied jockey as John Reid, only to be mortified when told it was the Princess Anne. Later in the same series, she came on the programme, made it clear she was not remotely offended by the misidentification, and was put on his team. Hughes caused a minor national debate when he defied protocol and put his <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>her.</b> [...] He called her [...] "ma'am" [...] throughout. Hughes later joined her team for the much-criticised It's a Royal Knockout project, the brainchild of her brother the Prince Edward.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the ninth}} season finale, [...] "Till Death Do Us Part", a bomb is planted by {{domestic}} terrorist Harper Dearing. Tony and Ziva, feeling bad about missing Jimmy and Breena's wedding, try to cheer {{each other up}} by joking about how awful weddings are—an exchange that begins to take on meaning when they become wistful about [...] "the vow, the ring, the kiss, the ketubah..." [...] and eloping instead of dealing with all the fuss. Later, when the Navy Yard is seconds from exploding, Ziva refuses to leave the building without Tony. The bomb goes off while they {{are still in the}} elevator; Ziva and Tony fall to the ground, with Tony's <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> waist, and their free hands clasped tightly as the elevator appears to crash.|$|E
2500|$|In {{matters of}} diplomacy, Elizabeth {{is known to}} be quite formal, and royal {{protocol}} is generally very strict. Though some of the traditional rules for dealing with the monarch have been relaxed during her reign (bowing is no longer required, for example, although it is still frequently performed), other forms of close personal interaction, such as touching, are discouraged by officials. At least six people are known to have broken this rule, the first being a woman named Alice Frazier, who hugged the Queen in 1991 when Elizabeth visited her residence in a government housing project in Washington, D.C. (accompanied by First Lady Barbara Bush and Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Jack Kemp). The second was Paul Keating, Prime Minister of Australia, when he was photographed with his arm around the Queen in 1992. The third was Canadian cyclist Louis Garneau, who did the same thing ten years later when posing for a photograph with the Queen at Rideau Hall (her official residence in Canada). In 1997 during the Cabot 500 celebrations of Newfoundland and Labrador, the then Premier Brian Tobin placed an arm behind her while walking up a staircase. This was frowned upon in the press, but the Premier said that he placed his <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> as an effort to help an elderly woman climb the stairs. In 2009, the Queen initiated an affectionate gesture with First Lady Michelle Obama at a palace reception she attended with President Obama. The Queen rested her hand briefly at the small of the First Lady's back, a gesture that Mrs Obama returned. It was remarked at the time as unprecedented and described afterwards by a palace spokeswoman as [...] "a mutual and spontaneous display of affection and appreciation between The Queen and Michelle Obama." ...|$|E
2500|$|Cephalopods are not {{broadcast}} spawners. During {{the process}} of fertilization, the females use sperm provided by the male via external fertilization. Internal fertilization is seen only in octopods. The initiation of copulation begins when the male catches a female and wraps his <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>her,</b> either in a [...] "male to female neck" [...] position or mouth to mouth position, depending on the species. The males then initiate {{the process of}} fertilization by contracting their mantle several times to release the spermatozoa. Cephalopods often mate several times, which influences males to mate longer with females that have previously, nearly tripling the amount of contractions of the mantle. To ensure the fertilization of the eggs, female cephalopods release a sperm-attracting peptide through the gelatinous layers of the egg to direct the spermatozoa. Female cephalopods lay eggs in clutches; each egg is composed of a protective coat {{to ensure the safety}} of the developing embryo when released into the water column. Reproductive strategies differ between cephalopod species. In giant pacific octopus, large eggs are laid in a den; it will often take several days to lay all of them. Once the eggs are released and attached to a sheltered substrate the females then die. In some species of cephalopods, egg clutches are anchored to substrates by a mucilaginous adhesive substance. These eggs are swelled with preivitelline fluid (PVF), a hypertonic fluid that prevents premature hatching. Fertilized egg clusters are neutrally buoyant depending at the depth that they were laid but can also be found in substrates such as sand, matrix of corals, or seaweed. Because these species do not provide parental care for their offspring, egg capsules can be injected with ink by the female in order to camouflage the embryos from predators.|$|E

2500|$|The video {{starts with}} King {{swinging}} {{around on a}} chair, then goes {{through all of the}} band's members with a close up shot. As Healy starts singing, she is at a window, and it is images outside of the window, with raindrops on the window, goes inside of the house, where she is seen sitting playing with the blinds at the window. The band are pictures at the Cinema trying to cheer Healy up after she's had her heart broke, eventually the band start having a laugh by throwing popcorn at her. Sandford and Wiseman are seen putting the phone down on their boyfriends after singing the lyrics, [...] "there's nothing left to say". As the chorus kicks in, White is seen walking out of the house, slamming the door, singing the lyrics, [...] "forever is over", which means she's left her boyfriend, she has had enough. The band start smashing and throwing things as they are angry with their ex-boyfriends. Wiseman is later seen having lunch with her boyfriend, which she is not very happy about and starts pulling faces, and later throws her glass of wine over him, and throws her engagement ring away. Sandford is also seen trying to phone her boyfriend, but he does not pick up the phone, and she puts her head against the wall, and King comes comfort her by putting her <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>her.</b> There are scenes where Healy and Wiseman begin to cook cakes in the kitchen, and where all the band are dancing in the car. Healy is seen typing 'Lover' into her laptop, but then deletes the L so it spells 'Over'. As the video comes to an end, the band are seen in a night club dancing, then leaving the club.|$|E
