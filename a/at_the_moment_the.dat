5|$|Phylogenetic {{studies have}} shown that, in its current circumscription, the genus Hydnellum is polyphyletic and only distantly related to the white-spored genera Bankera and Phellodon, {{currently}} grouped together in the family Bankeraceae. Analyses of the ITS region by Parfitt and colleagues and Ainsworth and colleagues, have further revealed multiple cryptic lineages within the genus. Most of the cryptic species belong to the H. concrescens/H. scrobiculatum species complex, resulting in frequent misinterpretations of these old and widely applied names. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment,</b> <b>the</b> number of phylogenetically distinct lineages confirmed by molecular sequencing exceeds the number of described taxa in the genus, making further taxonomic revisions inevitable in the future.|$|E
5|$|The {{tactical}} methods {{had been}} {{tested by the}} Australians in a local counter-attack at the Battle of Hamel on 4 July. The German defenders of Hamel were deeply dug in, and their position commanded a very wide field of fire. Similar positions had resisted capture for two months in the Battle of the Somme. The Australians had used surprise rather than weight at Hamel. The artillery had opened fire only <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>the</b> infantry and tanks advanced, and the Germans were rapidly overrun.|$|E

5|$|The {{scientific}} study of water and Earth's water cycle is hydrology; hydrodynamics studies the physics of water in motion. The more recent study of the sea in particular is oceanography. This began as {{the study of the}} shape of the ocean's currents but has since expanded into a large and multidisciplinary field: it examines the properties of seawater; studies waves, tides, and currents; charts coastlines and maps the seabeds; and studies marine life. The subfield dealing with the sea's motion, its forces, and the forces acting upon it is known as physical oceanography. Marine biology (biological oceanography) studies the plants, animals, and other organisms inhabiting marine ecosystems. Both are informed by chemical oceanography, which studies the behavior of elements and molecules within the oceans: particularly, <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment,</b> <b>the</b> ocean's role in the carbon cycle and carbon dioxide's role in the increasing acidification of seawater. Marine and maritime geography charts the shape and shaping of the sea, while marine geology (geological oceanography) has provided evidence of continental drift and the composition and structure of the Earth, clarified the process of sedimentation, and assisted the study of volcanism and earthquakes.|$|E
5|$|Wood small-reed (Calamagrostis epigejos) {{is present}} {{in the center of the}} site and threatens to spread into {{herbaceous}} areas. It compromises sustainability of stations, including man orchid and bee orchid populations. Two distinct zones can be distinguished. The first, where the wood small-reed has a very high rate of recovery, is not hosting any heritage value. It is mowed early and disposed of. Grazing is not possible <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment.</b> <b>The</b> second, on the contrary, not densely colonized by this plant is much more of a fragile situation due to the presence of orchids and the sickle-bearing bush cricket or long-horned groundhopper. Differentiated management is applied depending on the issues. At orchid stations, slight thinning is done early by hand pruning. The less dense areas where the grass is sparse (conducive to the long-horned groundhopper (Tetrix tenuicornis)) are pulled. In the newly opened areas, a systematic and annual pulling avoids expansion. Finally, dense areas, well exposed, are left in that state.|$|E

As the pilots struggled to control the aircraft, it went into a flat spin. The resulting aerodynamic loads sheared both engines from the aircraft seconds before impact. The engines landed several blocks north and east of the main wreckage site. Losing the engines cut off power to the FDR at 9:16:00, while the CVR (cockpit voice recorder), utilizing a battery backup, cut off at 9:16:15 moments before impact with the ground. The main impact location was the intersection of Newport Avenue and Beach 131st Street.|$|E

Recently, there was a protest in the plaza to let Hong Kong Resorts know that everybody wants a sports ground. The government refuses to provide any assistance or land.|$|E

25|$|An open-bolt {{mechanism}} {{is a common}} characteristic of fully automatic firearms. With this system, pulling the trigger releases the bolt from a cocked, rearward position, pushing a cartridge from the magazine into the chamber, firing the gun. The bolt retracts to the rearward position, ready to strip the next cartridge from the magazine. The open-bolt system is often used in submachine guns and other weapons with {{a high rate of}} fire. It is rarely used in semi-automatic-only firearms, which can fire only one shot with each pull of the trigger. The closed-bolt system is generally more accurate, as the centre of gravity changes relatively little <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>the</b> trigger is pulled.|$|E
