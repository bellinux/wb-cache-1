In many of these cases, it is unclear if oxidants trigger the disease, or if they are produced as a secondary consequence of the disease and from general tissue damage; One case in which this link is particularly well understood is the role of oxidative stress in cardiovascular disease. Here, low density lipoprotein (LDL) oxidation appears to trigger the process of <b>atherogenesis,</b> which results in atherosclerosis, and finally cardiovascular disease.|$|E

A study published in 2011 shows that CRP is associated with lipid responses to low-fat and high-polyunsaturated fat diets.|$|E
25|$|Early <b>atherogenesis</b> is {{characterized}} by the adherence of blood circulating monocytes (a type of white blood cell) to the vascular bed lining, the endothelium, then by their migration to the sub-endothelial space, and further activation into monocyte-derived macrophages. The primary documented driver of this process is oxidized lipoprotein particles within the wall, beneath the endothelial cells, though upper normal or elevated concentrations of blood glucose also plays a major role and not all factors are fully understood. Fatty streaks may appear and disappear.|$|E
25|$|In {{laboratory}} experiments, animals {{exposed to}} certain PAHs have shown increased development of plaques (<b>atherogenesis)</b> within arteries. Potential mechanisms for the pathogenesis {{and development of}} atherosclerotic plaques may {{be similar to the}} mechanisms involved in the carcinogenic and mutagenic properties of PAHs. A leading hypothesis is that PAHs may activate the cytochrome enzyme CYP1B1 in vascular smooth muscle cells. This enzyme then metabolically processes the PAHs to quinone metabolites that bind to DNA in reactive adducts that remove purine bases. The resulting mutations may contribute to unregulated growth of vascular smooth muscle cells or to their migration {{to the inside of the}} artery, which are steps in plaque formation. These quinone metabolites also generate reactive oxygen species that may alter the activity of genes that affect plaque formation.|$|E
25|$|Lp(a) is {{assembled}} at the hepatocyte {{cell membrane}} surface, while other scenarios exist {{with regard to}} the location of assembly. It mainly exists in plasma. Lp(a) contributes to the process of <b>atherogenesis.</b> Because of its structural similarity to plasminogen and tissue plasminogen activator, competitive inhibition leads to reduced fibrinolysis, {{and as a result of}} the stimulation of secretion of plasminogen activator inhibitor 1, Lp(a) leads to thrombogenesis. It may also enhance coagulation by inhibiting the function of tissue factor pathway inhibitor. Lp(a) carries cholesterol and binds atherogenic proinflammatory oxidized phospholipids as a preferential carrier of oxidized phospholipids in human plasma, which attract inflammatory cells to vessel walls and leads to smooth muscle cell proliferation. Moreover, Lp(a) is also hypothesized to be involved in wound healing and tissue repair, interacting with components of the vascular wall and extra cellular matrix. Apo(a), a distinct feature of the Lp(a) particle, binds to immobilized fibronectin and endows Lp(a) with the serine-proteinase-type proteolytic activity.|$|E
25|$|<b>Atherogenesis</b> is the {{developmental}} process of atheromatous plaques. It {{is characterized by}} a remodeling of arteries leading to subendothelial accumulation of fatty substances called plaques. The buildup of an atheromatous plaque is a slow process, developed {{over a period of several}} years through a complex series of cellular events occurring within the arterial wall and in response to a variety of local vascular circulating factors. One recent hypothesis suggests that, for unknown reasons, leukocytes, such as monocytes or basophils, begin to attack the endothelium of the artery lumen in cardiac muscle. The ensuing inflammation leads to formation of atheromatous plaques in the arterial tunica intima, a region of the vessel wall located between the endothelium and the tunica media. The bulk of these lesions is made of excess fat, collagen, and elastin. At first, as the plaques grow, only wall thickening occurs without any narrowing. Stenosis is a late event, which may never occur and is often the result of repeated plaque rupture and healing responses, not just the atherosclerotic process by itself.|$|E

50|$|Anti-atherogenic activity:Atherogenesis {{refers to}} the {{formation}} of atheromas on arteries’ walls. It is believed that <b>atherogenesis</b> may be caused by an infection of the vascular smooth muscle cells. Find molecules that possess anti-proliferation activity of vascular smooth muscle cells seems a good strategy to treat <b>Atherogenesis.</b> In 2006, a research group from Korea found Ochnaflavone could inhibit tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a-induced human vascular smooth muscle cells proliferation. It was achieved by the ability of Ochnaflavone to regulate the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2, matrix metalloproteinase-9 and cell cycle.|$|E

50|$|Under normal conditions, {{to avoid}} <b>atherogenesis,</b> thrombosis, smooth muscle {{proliferation}} and endothelial apoptosis, shear stress maintains its magnitude and direction within an acceptable range.

50|$|Atherosclerosis is {{most often}} the culprit in {{coronary}} heart disease and other cardiovascular conditions, and a large aggregation of perlecan protein is symptomatic of advanced atherosclerotic plaques. VSMCs are the producers of the perlecan in this condition, meaning that {{a good deal of}} research has been focused on understanding the means of perlecan upregulation in this condition. In a test of the effect of circulating nonesterified fatty acids (symptomatic of diabetes and <b>atherogenesis)</b> on perlecan expression by VSMCs, expression did not change when compared to control cells. This was in contrast to a 2-10-fold increase in expression of other basement membrane proteoglycans. Thrombin is another marker associated with <b>atherogenesis</b> and procoagulation, and it selectively upregulates production of perlecan but not other proteoglycans in human VSMCs in culture. It is suggested that this effect is only seen when VSMCs reach confluence, but not prior to confluence. This concept is similar to previously mentioned studies showing that perlecan is only produced by VSMCs once they have ceased proliferation during development. Another marker in the atherosclerotic pathway is angiotensin II, which also upregulates perlecan expression in VSMCs in culture. Given the prominence of perlecan expression in atherosclerosis there is potential for therapy based upon perlecan expression and research may eventually proceed in that direction.|$|E
50|$|In other investigations, {{the team}} has {{identified}} novel lymphocyte, dendritic cell and macrophage chemoattractants and receptors, as well as monocyte and arterial wall endothelial molecules that regulate monocyte-endothelial interactions in models of <b>atherogenesis.</b> They {{are interested in the}} structure and function of these molecules, and their importance in disease models. Finally, they have shown that leukocytes can effectively navigate through complex chemoattractant arrays, and they are exploring the mechanisms that permit this surprising behavior through computer simulations of chemotactic behavior, and through experimental manipulation of the molecules and receptors involved.|$|E

During valve tissue development the interaction of HB-EGF with EGF receptors and heparan sulfate proteogylcans is essential for the prevention of malformation of valves due to enlargement. In the vascular system areas of disturbed flow show upregulation of HB-EGF with promotion of vascular lesions, <b>atherogenesis,</b> and hyperplasia of intimal tissue in vessels. The flow disturbance remodeling of the vascular tissues due to HB-EGF expression contributes to aortic valve disease, peripheral vascular disease, and conduit stenosis.|$|E

50|$|Given its {{function}} in facilitating lysosomal degradation or recycling of ligands in lipid metabolism and the neural system, sortilin likely {{plays an important}} role in the underlying mechanisms and pathophysiology of <b>atherogenesis</b> and coronary artery disease, as well as in neurological disorders. For example, sortilin has been identified as an important receptor for brain apolipoprotein E (APOE) metabolism, which is implicated in the underlying mechanisms of Alzheimer’s disease. Interestingly, a significant role for sortilin has recently also been reported in the field of oncology, as it has been detected in several cancer cell lines. Notably, human cancerous epithelial cells exhibited increased levels of sortilin as compared to normal epithelial tissues. Furthermore, it appears that sortilin participates in the progression of breast cancer and contributes to tumor cell adhesion and invasion.|$|E
