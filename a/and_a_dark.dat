5|$|A. r. eremoeca was {{described}} by N. C. Brown in 1882. It is found from southeastern Colorado to New Mexico, Texas, northern Chihuahua, and central Coahuila. It has grayish upperparts <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>dark</b> breast.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, Juno was imaged by the Hooker Telescope at Mount Wilson Observatory at {{visible and}} near-IR wavelengths, using {{adaptive}} optics. The images spanned a whole rotation period and revealed an irregular shape <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>dark</b> albedo feature, {{interpreted as a}} fresh impact site.|$|E
5|$|Masked shrikes {{are most}} similar in {{appearance}} to woodchat shrikes, but are smaller, more slender and longer-tailed. Adults {{of the two}} species are easily distinguished, since the masked shrike has white on its head <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>dark</b> rump, whereas the woodchat shrike has a black crown, rusty nape and white rump. Juveniles are more similar, but the masked shrike has a longer tail, paler face, and grey back and rump, whereas the woodchat shrike has a sandy back and pale grey rump.|$|E

5|$|Ruthenium trichloride is a {{well-known}} compound, existing in a black α-form <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>dark</b> brown β-form: the trihydrate is red. Of the known trihalides, trifluoride is dark brown and decomposes above 650°C, tetrabromide is dark-brown and decomposes above 400°C, and triiodide is black. Of the dihalides, difluoride is not known, dichloride is brown, dibromide is black, and diiodide is blue. The only known oxyhalide is the pale green ruthenium(VI) oxyfluoride, RuOF4.|$|E
5|$|For example, in {{the common}} {{cuttlefish}} the display consists of flattening the body, making the skin pale, showing a pair of eyespots on the mantle, dark eye rings, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>dark</b> line on the fins, and dilating the pupils of the eyes. The common octopus similarly displays pale skin and dark eye rings with dilated pupils, but also curls its arms and stretches out the web between the arms as far as possible, and squirts out jets of water. Other octopuses such as Atlantic white-spotted octopus turn bright brownish red with oval white spots all over in a high contrast display. The paper nautilus can rapidly change its appearance: it suddenly withdraws the shining iridescent web formed by its first pair of arms from its shell.|$|E
5|$|The {{child in}} the man's arms was wearing light-coloured pink pyjamas with a floral pattern and cuffs on the legs, similar to Madeleine's. Tanner {{described}} the man as white, dark-haired, 5ft 7 in (1.70 m) tall, of southern European or Mediterranean appearance, 35–40 years old, wearing gold or beige trousers <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>dark</b> jacket, and {{said he did not}} look like a tourist. Tanner told the Portuguese police, but they did not pass the description to the media until 25 May. Madeleine's Fund hired a forensic artist to create an image of the man (left), which was released in October 2007.|$|E
60|$|But this {{anxiety was}} deepened, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>darker</b> gloom was cast over the party, by an {{incident}} which happened soon afterwards.|$|R
25|$|The {{most recent}} {{modification}} of the crest was in 2010, with the yellow and blue more vibrant <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>darker</b> outline <b>and</b> border.|$|R
50|$|To have a {{reasonable}} change of being visible against most backgrounds, the tape needs a light colour (white or yellow) <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>darker</b> colour.|$|R
5|$|The {{predominant}} club colours {{are green}} and white, {{which have been}} used since {{the formation of the}} club in 1875. The strip typically has a green body, white sleeves and a white collar. The shorts are normally white, although green has been used in recent seasons. The socks are green, usually with some white detail. Hibs have used yellow, purple, black, white <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>dark</b> green in recent seasons for their alternate kits. In 1977, Hibs became the first club in Scotland to bear sponsorship on their shirts. This arrangement prompted television companies to threaten a boycott of Hibs games if they used the sponsored kit, which resulted in the club using an alternate kit for the first time.|$|E
5|$|The spores are spherical, and 3.5–4.5µm in diameter. They {{are covered}} with short narrow {{abruptly}} terminating projections of a translucent (hyaline) substance, which turn a pale cinnamon brown in potassium hydroxide, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>dark</b> dull brown (nearly sepia) when stained with iodine. The capillitium is made of {{what appears to be}} encrusted cylindrical filaments 3–6µm in diameter, of a color varying from hyaline to dull yellowish brown in potassium hydroxide, and yellowish in iodine; its walls are thickened {{to the point where the}} interior (lumen) appears as only a line. Either two or four spores are attached to the basidia, and the sterigmata (extensions of the basidia that attach the spores) are long, up to 20µm. Geastrum triplex does not have cystidia.|$|E
5|$|The {{two species}} of manta differ in color patterns, dermal denticles, and dentition. M. birostris has more angular {{shoulder}} markings, larger ventral dark spots on the abdominal region, charcoal-colored ventral outlines on the pectoral fins <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>dark</b> colored mouth. The shoulder markings of M. alfredi are more rounded, while its ventral spots are located near the posterior end and between the gill slits, and the mouth is white or pale colored. The denticles have multiple cusps and overlap in M. birostris, while those of M. alfredi are evenly spaced and lack cusps. Both species have small square shaped teeth on the lower jaw but M. birostris also has enlarged teeth on the upper jaw. Unlike M. alfredi, M. birostris has a caudal spine near its dorsal fin.|$|E
50|$|Hocking has {{referred}} to Torn as 'the dark middle child' of the series, citing more mature themes <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>darker</b> storyline than the previous novel.|$|R

50|$|Chiara Iezzi {{was born}} on 27 February 1973, with blonde hair and blue eyes. Paola Iezzi {{was born on}} 30 March 1974, with <b>dark</b> hair <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>darker</b> complexion.|$|R
5|$|Confusion {{with the}} highly {{regarded}} miller or sweetbread mushroom (Clitopilus prunulus) {{is a common}} cause of poisoning in France; the latter fungus has a greyish-white downy cap and whitish decurrent gills which turn pink with maturity. Young fruit bodies of Entoloma sinuatum can also be confused with St George's mushroom (Calocybe gambosa), although the gills of the latter are crowded and cream in colour, and the clouded agaric (Clitocybe nebularis), which has whitish decurrent gills and an unusual odour. To complicate matters, it often grows near these edible species. Its overall size and shape resemble members of the genus Tricholoma, although the spore colour (white in Tricholoma, pinkish in Entoloma) and shape (angular in Entoloma) help distinguish it. The rare and edible all-white dovelike tricholoma (T.columbetta) has a satiny cap and stem and a faint, not mealy, odour. E.sinuatum may be confused with Clitocybe multiceps in the Pacific Northwest of North America, although the latter has white spores and generally grows in clumps. A casual observer may mistake it for an edible field mushroom (Agaricus campestris), but this species has a ring on the stipe, pink gills that become chocolate-brown in maturity, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>dark</b> brown spore print. The poorly known North American species E. albidum resembles E.sinuatum but is likewise poisonous.|$|E
5|$|In 1902, the hotel's {{first floor}} held its {{reception}} rooms, parlors, dining rooms, library, and a lounge area called the Dutch kitchen. The library was adjacent to {{and north of}} the large dining room. The ballroom had classical fluted Ionic columns and Italian marble walls. Thomas Edison was honored there in 1909. The Dutch kitchen had decorations and furnishings from Holland and {{was based on a}} restaurant in Edam. It had rough adze-hewn timbers, a hipped ceiling, etchings from England, and European and American oil paintings. Much of the furniture was purchased from Law's former employer, home furnishings pioneer W. & J. Sloane. Art and decorations throughout the building were largely were sourced from markets in Europe and Asia, and included expensive paintings, bronzes, marble sculptures, rare books, and carved antique furniture. The hotel also had a Chinese tea room <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>dark</b> room for amateur photographers. The kitchen was kept clean (such that it was proposed to serve lunches in the kitchen). It was reported to be of elegant design, utilizing white tile and marble. The kitchen equipment was of white porcelain and aluminum, and included numerous glass-lined refrigerators. It sourced its milk, butter, eggs, and vegetables from Briarcliff Farms. The kitchen's trash was frozen to prevent odors before its eventual removal; the lodge also had an ice-producing plant that used sterilized well water.|$|E
5|$|The Pharisee Nicodemus {{supports}} Christ {{as he is}} lowered, and can {{be identified}} by his similarity to Simon the Pharisee in another canvas attributed to Bouts, Christ in the House of Simon. The Virgin wears a white headdress <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>dark</b> blue dress with a yellowish mantle, and holds Christ's arm just above his wrist as if afraid {{to let go of}} her dead son. She is supported by John the Evangelist, who wears a red robe. Dressed in green robes, Mary Salome stands to the Virgin's left, wiping tears from her face with the fold of her white headdress. Mary of Clopas is behind them, holding a red cloth over her mouth, while the Magdalen is in the foreground at Christ's feet, dressed in a heavily folded cloak. The man in the brown–green tabard at the feet of Christ is probably Joseph of Arimathea, who, according to Gospel, brought Christ's body to Golgotha from Pontius Pilate.|$|E
50|$|The {{length of}} the {{forewings}} is 12-13.5 mm. The forewings are whitish, slightly striped by light brown. The hindwings are white with <b>a</b> metallic hue, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>darker</b> fringe.|$|R
50|$|This small nocturnal wallaby {{is found}} amid rocky outcrops. It is {{generally}} greyish-brown with <b>a</b> paler belly <b>and</b> chest, <b>a</b> <b>dark</b> stripe running from its head down its spine, <b>and</b> it has <b>a</b> <b>dark</b> tail <b>and</b> feet.|$|R
50|$|The model 1874, {{of which}} 35,000 were made, was an officer version. It differs from model 1873 by <b>a</b> lighter {{structure}} <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>darker</b> finish. Many civilians copies {{were made in}} France and Belgium.|$|R
5|$|The Sunda slow loris has dark rings {{around its}} large eyes, a white nose with a whitish strip that {{extends to the}} {{forehead}} <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>dark</b> stripe that stretches {{from the back of}} the head along the spine. Its soft, thick, woolly fur ranges from light brown to deep reddish brown, with a lighter underside. The species is distinct from the Bengal slow loris due to the dark inverse teardrop markings around the eyes which meet the dark dorsal stripe on the back of the head. It tends to have a much more distinct white stripe between the eyes, more distinct dark coloring around the eyes, and a browner coat than the Bengal slow loris which is larger, grayer, and shows less contrast. The Sunda slow loris has less white facial coloring than the much smaller pygmy slow loris. Local color variations are known to occur.|$|E
5|$|The {{rings are}} made of an {{extremely}} dark material. The geometric albedo of the ring particles does not exceed 5–6%, while the Bond albedo is even lower—about 2%. The rings particles demonstrate a steep opposition surge—an increase of the albedo when the phase angle is close to zero. This means that their albedo is much lower when they are observed slightly off the opposition. The rings are slightly red in the ultraviolet and visible parts of the spectrum and grey in near-infrared. They exhibit no identifiable spectral features. The chemical composition of the ring particles is not known. However, they cannot be made of pure water ice like the rings of Saturn because they are too dark, darker than the inner moons of Uranus. This indicates that they are probably composed of a mixture of the ice <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>dark</b> material. The nature of this material is not clear, {{but it may be}} organic compounds considerably darkened by the charged particle irradiation from the Uranian magnetosphere. The rings' particles may consist of a heavily processed material which was initially {{similar to that of the}} inner moons.|$|E
25|$|The first {{addition}} to the Law School was completed in 1994, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>dark</b> polished granite façade {{was added to the}} rear exterior of the building, enclosing the interior courtyard.|$|E
50|$|The {{length of}} the {{forewings}} is 11-13 mm. The forewings are light brown with <b>a</b> silver-white dot <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>darker</b> brownish copper longitudinal streak immediately above a white longitudinal streak. The hindwings are pale grey.|$|R
50|$|The {{length of}} the {{forewings}} is 11.8-13.5 mm for males and 11.3-12.6 mm for females. The forewings are powdery gray and the hindwings are semitranslucent pale luteous, with <b>darker</b> veins <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>darker</b> outer margin.|$|R
50|$|The {{length of}} the {{forewings}} is 12.5-14 mm. The forewings are whitish with longitudinal light brown longitudinal striae, more or less following the veins. The hindwings are whitish with <b>a</b> metallic hue, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>darker</b> fringe.|$|R
25|$|Philip IV of Spain wears {{breeches}} and doublet {{of brown}} and silver <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>dark</b> cloak all trimmed with silver lace. His sleeves are white and he wears white stockings, plain black shoes, and brown leather gloves, 1631–32.|$|E

5000|$|A small {{bird with}} a short tail. Males and females are similar in color, as well as juveniles after fledging; they are brown all over with <b>a</b> paler underpart <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>darker</b> brown crest <b>and</b> eyeline.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 26 mm. The ground colour of the forewings is creamish with leaden-grey suffusions <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>darker</b> costa with brownish-cream costal strigulae (fine streaks). The apex and posterior {{part of the}} costa are brownish. The markings consist of <b>a</b> <b>dark</b> purple-brown blotch edged with whitish. The hindwings are brownish.|$|R
50|$|Often {{confused}} with eastern quoll, it differs in possessing a first toe on the hind foot <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>darker</b> tail. It does share a white-spotted brown coat <b>and</b> <b>a</b> long tail {{with both the}} eastern quoll and northern quoll.|$|R
