Ernslaw One had also sold 50,000 units at $NZ20 (sales value about $NZ1 million worth) to a NZ buyer and then subsequently at the end of 2009 made a second 500,000 tonne trade with the Norwegian Government.|$|E

40|$|Abstract- The {{inclusion}} of emissions trading in the Kyoto Protocol reflects an important decision to address climate change issues through flexible market mechanisms. In this paper, we have addressed {{a number of}} policy issues that {{must be considered in}} designing and implementing an international greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions trading scheme. These include how much of a Party’s <b>assigned</b> <b>amounts</b> of GHG emissions can be traded internationally; emissions trading models; competitiveness concern in the allocation of emissions permits; banking and borrowing; accountability; emissions trading system enlargement; and bubbles. Although our focus has been exclusively on emissions trading, we have discussed its relationship with the clean development mechanism, joint implementation and bubbles wherever necessary. By providing some new insights, the paper aims to contribute to the design and operationlization of an international emissions trading scheme...|$|R
5000|$|In the United States, the [...] "acid rain"-related {{emission}} {{trading system}} was principally conceived by C. Boyden Gray, a G.H.W. Bush administration attorney. Gray {{worked with the}} Environmental Defense Fund (EDF), who worked with the EPA to write the bill that became law {{as part of the}} Clean Air Act of 1990. The new emissions cap on NOx and [...] gases took effect in 1995, and according to Smithsonian magazine, those acid rain emissions dropped 3 million tons that year. In 1997, the CoP agreed, in what {{has been described as a}} watershed in international environmental treaty making, the Kyoto Protocol where 38 developed countries (Annex 1 countries) committed themselves to targets and timetables for the reduction of GHGs. These targets for developed countries are often referred to as <b>Assigned</b> <b>Amounts.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Under the Kyoto Protocol, the 'caps' or [...] for Greenhouse gases for the {{developed}} Annex 1 countries {{are known as}} Assigned Amounts and are listed in Annex B. The quantity of the initial <b>assigned</b> <b>amount</b> is denominated in individual units, called <b>Assigned</b> <b>amount</b> units (AAUs), each of which represents an allowance to emit one metric tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent, and these are entered into the country's national registry.|$|E

40|$|In 2005 EU {{will launch}} its {{emissions}} trading system (ETS) under which energy intensive firms within EU may trade carbon emission allowances. This system is by many seen as instrumental for EU’s ability {{to fulfill its}} Kyoto commitment. At the same time, in {{what seems to be}} an ambition to go one step ahead, Germany, Sweden and the UK have adopted national greenhouse-gas emission targets equal to or below the so-called <b>Assigned</b> <b>Amounts</b> that EU’s burden-sharing agreement for 2008 - 12 allots to these countries. It is shown here that implementation of these policies means that EU’s greenhouse-gas emissions during 2008 - 12 would be an increasing function of the aggregate net sale of emission allowances by ETS firms in countries with national emission targets. One implication of this circumstance is that the climate policies announced by Germany, Sweden and the UK are incompatible with the burden-sharing agreement and the Kyoto Protocol.

2500|$|The Protocol defines three [...] "flexibility mechanisms" [...] {{that can}} be used by Annex I Parties in meeting their {{emission}} limitation commitments. [...] The flexibility mechanisms are International Emissions Trading (IET), the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), and Joint Implementation (JI). IET allows Annex I Parties to [...] "trade" [...] their emissions (<b>Assigned</b> <b>Amount</b> Units, AAUs, or [...] "allowances" [...] for short).|$|E
2500|$|An {{individual}} allowance, {{such as an}} <b>Assigned</b> <b>amount</b> unit (AAU) or its near-equivalent European Union Allowance (EUA), {{may have}} a different market value to an offset such as a CER. [...] This {{is due to the}} lack of a developed secondary market for CERs, a lack of homogeneity between projects which causes difficulty in pricing, as well as questions due to the principle of supplementarity and its lifetime. [...] Additionally, offsets generated by a carbon project under the Clean Development Mechanism are potentially limited in value because operators in the EU ETS are restricted as to what percentage of their allowance can be met through these flexible mechanisms.|$|E
60|$|Considered {{in their}} ensemble, the several groups of evidences <b>assigned</b> <b>amount</b> almost to proof. We have seen that, when {{critically}} examined, the speculations of late years current respecting {{the nature of}} the nebulæ, commit their promulgators to sundry absurdities; while, on the other hand, we see that the various appearances these nebulæ present, are explicable as different stages in the precipitation and aggregation of diffused matter. We find that the immense majority of comets (i.e. omitting the periodic ones), by their physical constitution, their immensely-extended and variously-directed paths, the distribution of those paths, and their manifest structural relation to the Solar System, bear testimony to the past existence of that system in a nebulous form. Not only do those obvious peculiarities in the motions of the planets which first suggested the Nebular Hypothesis, supply proofs of it, but on closer examination we discover, in the slightly-diverging inclinations of their orbits, in their various rates of rotation, and their differently-directed axes of rotation, that the planets yield us yet further testimony; while the satellites, by sundry traits, and especially by their occurrence in greater or less abundance where the hypothesis implies greater or less abundance, confirm this testimony. By tracing out the process of planetary condensation, we are led to conclusions respecting the physical states of planets which explain their anomalous specific gravities. Once more, it turns out that what is inferable from the Nebular Hypothesis respecting the temperatures of celestial bodies, is just what observation establishes; and that both the absolute and the relative temperatures of the Sun and planets are thus accounted for. When we contemplate these various evidences in their totality--when we observe that, by the Nebular Hypothesis, the leading phenomena of the Solar System, and the heavens in general, are explicable; and when, on the other hand, we consider that the current cosmogony is not only without a single fact to stand on, but is at variance with all our positive knowledge of Nature, we see that the proof becomes overwhelming.|$|E
