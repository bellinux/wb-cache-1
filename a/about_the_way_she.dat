Therefore people in the textile factory alienated and called her Shen Nü (神女), which means goddess. Although she looked glum, Sun Quan was still shocked by her beauty and was curious <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>she</b> smiles. Lady Pan was later brought into the palace and loved by Sun Quan.|$|E
500|$|After {{graduating from}} Notre Dame in 2000, Dunst {{continued}} the acting career {{that she had}} begun. As a teenager, she {{found it difficult to}} deal with her rising fame, and for a period she blamed her mother for pushing her into acting as a child. However, she later expressed that her mother [...] "always had the best intentions". When asked if she had any regrets <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>she</b> spent her childhood, Dunst said: [...] "Well, it's not a natural way to grow up, but it's the way I grew up and I wouldn't change it. I have my stuff to work out... I don't think anybody can sit around and say, 'My life is more screwed up than yours.' Everybody has their issues." ...|$|E

She went to York Preparatory in New York City for {{junior high and high}} school after her mother researched the school to accommodate Tyler's ADHD. She graduated in 1995 and left to continue her acting career. [...] When asked <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>she</b> spent her youth, Tyler said: [...] "For me, I didn’t get much of a childhood in my teen years because I’ve been working since I was 14. But that also kept me out of trouble. When everybody was doing acid and partying like crazy, I was at work on a movie in Tuscany... having my own fun, of course, but it was a different kind of thing. I have no regrets. I love the way my life has gone." ...|$|E

[...] "Someone from the New Musical Express rang us about a feature we're to do with them and said 'We don't want it to be <b>about</b> <b>the</b> multi-cultural angle'. In other words that fad is over. And I'm {{personally}} insulted... what other angle is there for us?! I get sick of it all." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{went down}} to dinner rather early and found Alice in the hall. There was nobody else <b>about,</b> and by <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>she</b> looked up as he {{advanced}} he thought she {{had been waiting for}} him. Alice had beauty, but it was her proud reserve he felt most. She did not give her friendship lightly, but he believed it was worth winning.|$|R
500|$|More than a {{thousand}} young actresses were considered for the part of Max. Cameron started reviewing audition tapes when the field had been narrowed down to twenty or thirty applicants. He was initially not impressed with Alba's audition tape, saying [...] "she had her head down, she was reading out of the script... she didn't present herself all that well. But there was something <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>she</b> read the script that copped an attitude that I liked." [...] Cameron continually reviewed the audition tapes but {{kept coming back to}} Alba's, eventually deciding that he needed to meet her. Alba was hired for the role before the script was written. Eglee said: [...] "We had the benefit of being able to write a script kind of backwards, we were writing for this actress, with her cadences and her rhythms and her sensibilities and her attitude and her slang." [...] To train for the role, Alba spent a year doing martial arts and gymnastics and riding motorcycles.|$|E
500|$|Season two {{also showed}} Lana's {{transition}} from the [...] "girl next door" [...] to a more [...] "self-reliant young woman". At {{the beginning of the}} season Lana is forced to come to terms with her diminished feelings for Whitney, as well as her growing feelings for Clark. It takes time before Lana is strong enough to finally tell Whitney the truth, in a video message, <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>she</b> feels. The Talon, a local coffee shop co-owned by Lana, becomes her new grounding force as Whitney and her aunt have left Smallville. Kreuk thinks that it can be hard to believe that a sixteen-year-old girl could become co-owner of a coffee shop, but she believes that it helps to provide more independence for the character and establish her more within the show. Eventually, in order to really get to know herself, and find her role in life, Lana leaves Smallville for Paris. In season four, Kristin Kreuk felt like Lana is [...] "going a little crazy and is uncertain about her direction, and feels people aren't validating her beliefs".|$|E
500|$|Richard Bradley, {{editor-in-chief}} of Worth magazine, {{was the first}} mainstream journalist to question the Rolling Stone article, in a blog entry written on November 24, 2014. The entry began drawing national media attention {{in the days after}} paleoconservative pundit Steve Sailer made an entry on his own blog at the Unz Review on November 29 in which he discussed and linked to Bradley's piece. After an interview Erdely gave to Slate, in which she was questioned <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>she</b> investigated the piece, some commentators escalated their questioning of the veracity of the article. It was later revealed Erdely had not interviewed any of the men accused of the rape. Erdely defended her decision not to interview the accused by saying that the contact page on the fraternity's website [...] "was pretty outdated". Washington Post media critic Erik Wemple rejected Erdely's statement, saying that the severity of the accusations she was reporting required [...] "every possible step to reach out and interview them, including e-mails, phone calls, certified letters, FedEx letters, UPS letters and, if all of that fails, a knock on the door. No effort short of all that qualifies as journalism." ...|$|E

Charlie Brown tries to correct her, but she retaliates with a false explanation, and Charlie Brown bangs his head against a tree in frustration ("Little Known Facts"). That evening, Snoopy complains that he hasn't been fed yet, and begins to overcomplicate and dramaticize the matter until Charlie Brown shows up with his dinner. Snoopy bursts into song about his craving for supper until Charlie Brown firmly tells him to eat his meal ("Suppertime").|$|R

5000|$|By all accounts, Lois {{was obsessed}} with abusing Dennis, and she wanted {{the world to know}} he was a [...] "bad child"; she made no apologies <b>about</b> <b>the</b> {{inappropriate}} <b>way</b> <b>she</b> was disciplining him. Lois considered herself a devout Catholic and believed she was doing [...] "God's work" [...] by making Dennis [...] "perfect" [...] in her eyes. To this end, she forced religious training on her young sons; reports had young Robert flawlessly reciting the Rosary at two. Dennis struggled with such training and was forced to pray and recite his Rosary kneeling on a broomstick for extended periods, until he did it correctly.|$|R

60|$|When {{his sister}} Effie {{came to the}} Marsh for a week, he went with her for once to church. In the tiny place, with its mere dozen pews, he sat {{not far from the}} stranger. There was a {{fineness}} about her, a poignancy <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>she</b> sat and held her head lifted. She was strange, from far off, yet so intimate. She was from far away, a presence, so close to his soul. She was not really there, sitting in Cossethay church beside her little girl. She was not living the apparent life of her days. She belonged to somewhere else. He felt it poignantly, as something real and natural. But a pang of fear for his own concrete life, that was only Cossethay, hurt him, and gave him misgiving.|$|E

50|$|After {{completing}} {{experiments in}} New York, Demkina made several complaints {{in regard to}} the conditions under which they were conducted, and <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> in which <b>she</b> and her diagnoses were treated. She argued that she had required more time to see a metal plate in one subject's skull, that surgical scars interfered with her ability to see the resected esophagus in another, and that she had been presented with two study subjects who had undergone abdominal procedure, but that she had only one abdominal condition on her list of potential diagnoses, leaving her confused as to which one matched the listed condition.|$|R

For the times it was considered a very sexy, provocative look, bordering on scandalous, and [...] "heso dashi" [...] became the topic of much media discussion.

40|$|Abstract: After their introduction, {{technical}} systems {{designed for}} Situational Awareness {{have changed the}} possibilities on the battlefield. Today, Swedish tanks use a system known as the TCCS. This system offers many advantages to a tank platoon, but does it also bring disadvantages? This essay examines pros and cons with the TCCS. To find these the author uses a Swedish Armed Forces analyze model in a comparative study. The comparison is between a platoon with the TCCS and one platoon without it. The author {{has found that the}} use of TCCS reduces the risk of friendly fire amongst the platoon; this will serve as an example of one of the advantages the author has identified. One of the disadvantages of using TCCS identified in this study is that a platoon commander might use less personal leadership because of the technical potentials of the system. The conclusion {{of this study is that}} a user of this system should take note of and reflect <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> he or <b>she</b> uses it. By doing so, the user can get the desired effect out of this technical system...|$|R
