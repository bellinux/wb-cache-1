5|$|Quarries of {{the local}} blue lias stone were worked from {{as early as the}} 12th century {{to the end of the}} 19th century. It is a {{geological}} formation in southern England, part of the Lias Group. The Blue Lias consists of a sequence of limestone and shale layers, laid down in latest Triassic and early Jurassic times, between 195 and 200 million years ago. Its age corresponds to the Rhaetian to lower Sinemurian stages of the geologic timescale, thus fully including the Hettangian stage. It is the lowest of the three divisions of the Lower Jurassic period and, as such, is also given the name Lower Lias. It consists of thin blue <b>argillaceous,</b> or clay-like, limestone. The Blue Lias contains many fossils, especially ammonites. Fossils discovered in the lias include many ichthyosaurs, one of which has been adopted as the badge of Street. There is a display of Street fossils in the Natural History Museum in London.|$|E
25|$|The Womble Shale is {{the oldest}} {{geologic}} unit that underlies all other exposed units. It is black, hard, and <b>argillaceous</b> shale.|$|E
25|$|The Winterburn Group is {{composed}} of silty dolomite, evaporite, <b>argillaceous</b> limestone, red and green siltstone, anhydrite, silty dolomite and siltstone. Pinnacle reefs develop in the Nisku Formation.|$|E
25|$|Geologically, {{the island}} {{consists}} of gneiss and <b>argillaceous</b> schists with occasional tufts and other sedimentary layers from which fossils have been recovered. The island is {{a fragment of}} some greater land-mass now vanished and was probably a former extension of the Andean system.|$|E
25|$|Shale {{is a fine}} grained, hard, {{laminated}} mudrock, {{consisting of}} clay minerals, and quartz and feldspar silt. Shale is lithified and fissile. It must have at least 50-percent of its particles measure less than 0.062mm. This term is confined to <b>argillaceous,</b> or clay-bearing, rock.|$|E
25|$|The Polk Creek Shale and Missouri Mountain Shale overlie the Bigfork Chert and {{generally}} consist of shale with minor thin layers of quartzitic sandstone. The Polk Creek Shale is a black, fissile, graphitic shale. The Missouri Mountain Shale varies in color, and {{is soft and}} <b>argillaceous.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{base of the}} Tunbridge Wells Sand {{is marked}} by a {{distinct}} change from the predominantly <b>argillaceous</b> sediments of the Wadhurst Clay to siltstones and silty sands. This boundary is often indicated on maps by spring lines and seepages, where groundwater percolating through the permeable Tunbridge Wells Sand is forced to surface at the junction with the Wadhurst Clay.|$|E
25|$|In the Lower Eocene, Basin {{conditions}} became restricted, {{producing an}} alternating dolomite and anhydrite sequence with a consistent thickness. The mid-Eocene saw {{development of a}} wide carbonate platform, richly nummulitic, also constant in thickness. There are <b>argillaceous</b> limestone interbeds, marl, and occasional calcareous sandstones. The Late Eocene reflects more frequent lateral variations of interbedded limestones, dolomites, marls, and shales.|$|E
25|$|The mycelia of {{truffles}} form symbiotic, mycorrhizal {{relationships with}} the roots of several tree species including beech, birch, hazel, hornbeam, oak, pine, and poplar. They prefer <b>argillaceous</b> or calcareous soils that are well drained and neutral or alkaline. Truffles fruit throughout the year, depending on the species, {{and can be found}} buried between the leaf litter and the soil.|$|E
25|$|Although {{most of the}} Cotentin Peninsula {{belongs to}} the Armorican Massif, the Plain {{is part of the}} Paris Basin. <b>Argillaceous</b> {{limestone}} from the Sinemurian contributes to the region's dairy product appellation (AOC) Isigny-Sainte-Mère, which it shares with Bessin. Horse breeding has long been practiced in the Plain, which is regarded as the cradle of the Anglo-Norman horse breed, the product of English stallions and mares from the Cotentin Peninsula.|$|E
25|$|The Dox Formation, {{also known}} as the Dox Sandstone, is a Mesoproterozoic rock {{formation}} that outcrops in the eastern Grand Canyon, Coconino County, Arizona. The strata of the Dox Formation, except for some more resistant sandstone beds, are relatively susceptible to erosion and weathering. The lower member of the Dox Formation consists of silty-sandstone and sandstone, and some interbedded <b>argillaceous</b> beds, that form stair-stepped, cliff-slope topography. The bulk of the Dox Formation typically forms rounded and sloping hill topography that occupies an unusually broad section of the canyon.|$|E
25|$|In 1825, Jacob ceded {{a portion}} of his land to John B. Jervis of the Delaware and Hudson Canal Company so that a canal could be built across the property. As a {{condition}} of building the canal, Jacob required the company build him a slip so he could ship his produce to market, and a bridge to reach his mill. Crews excavating the area a short while later found large deposits of dolostone, an <b>argillaceous</b> mineral that, once pulverized and mixed, could be turned into natural cement without additives.|$|E
25|$|Generally {{the same}} {{sedimentary}} types {{are present in}} the marls as are in the waterstones but with less arenaceous and more <b>argillaceous</b> material. An irregular rhythm is discernible, each sedimentary cycle is well developed and have banded or stippled beds at the base. It is in this banded stratum that features such as sun cracks are found. Ripple marks are less common but they are evidence of deposition in shallow water. Pitting sometimes found has been linked to rain pitting but may have occurred during the de-gassing of the marls during drying out. The banded strata which may be red or grey pass up into blocky unstratified mudstones (broken up and allowed to resettle before consolidation).|$|E
25|$|Named after Mount Ainslie, Australian Capital Territory {{where their}} type {{location}} occurs, the Ainslie Volcanics {{are composed of}} Dacitic ignimbrite and minor volcaniclastic and <b>argillaceous</b> sediments. The lithology is bluish grey dacitic tuff, which can be massive or foliated, also dacitic agglomerate and shale. These volcanics contain chloritised cordierite and some have red almandine garnet. Jasper is found on low hills {{on the north side}} of the Molonglo River. The thickness is at least 700 metres. The magma was formed by melting an aluminiumrich pelitic sediment. The eruption came from a volcano into shallow sea water. The deposits built above sea level as they progressed. The underlying sediments now make up the Canberra Formation. Between Hall and Namina Hill on Spring Range, the Mount Painter Volcanics lie unconformably on top.|$|E
25|$|In sharp {{contrast}} to <b>argillaceous</b> strata above and below it, the Shinumo Quartzite consists characteristically of beds that are red, brown, or purple sedimentary quartzites and lesser massive white, red, or purple sandstone; also conglomeratic sandstone. Within these cliff-forming sandstones, mudstone-rich intervals occur. Some of these sandstone beds exhibit well-developed soft-sediment deformation structures. No fossils {{have been found in}} the Shinumo Quartzite. The lower and middle parts of the Shinumo Quartzite accumulated in coastal tidal flats and the upper part of it represents the deposits of river deltas. The gradational contact between the Shinumo Quartzite and Dox Formation above indicates a shift from deposition in coastal deltas – to fluvial deposition by a large river system. Of note, the 'soft-sediment deformation' seen in this Shinumo Quartzite formation indicates significant earthquake and tectonic activity during its deposition.|$|E
25|$|In {{an archaeological}} {{excavation}} {{of the road}} at {{the southern edge of}} Bourne (TF098193), where it ran across a margin between Kellaways clay and the <b>argillaceous</b> (clayey) Kellaways sand, {{it was found that the}} construction of the carriageway had been done by digging two parallel shallow trenches into the subsoil and over-filling them with gravel ballast so as to form kerbs. Coarse sand was used to form the carriageway between them. This was a skilful use of the available materials as south of Kate's Bridge, the road passes over such minerals but little but rather friable Cornbrash is available near the excavated site. Clearly, this part of the road was constructed from the south, northwards and the materials carried along it. However, further north, in the Long Hollow, cornbrash from Sapperton TF019239, seems to have been used (Lane p.23.) Again, the use is north of the source.|$|E
25|$|The Pittman Formation was {{described}} originally by Öpik in 1958 who named {{it after the}} Pittman Valley, southeast of Aranda, Australian Capital Territory. It is entirely of Ordovician age and about 800 metres thick near Canberra, but at Captains Flat it is over 1,200 metres thick. The lower levels are greywacke, exposed east of Queanbeyan and north are very thick and heavily overturned and thrusted. At Etheridge Creek, the type locality is a repeating pattern of sandstone, micaceous sandy shale, mudstone, black <b>argillaceous</b> and radiolarian chert. In the sandstone beds there are occurrences of graded bedding, clay pellets, and current bedding. Fossils of graptolites, radiolarians, conodonts, and occasionally brachiopods and sponges are found. The geological formation east of Queanbeyan {{used to be known}} as the Muriarra Formation. This alternates between sandstone with a high quartz content and mica, and phyllite. Radiolarian chert is found in the central section. The railway forms the border between Queanbeyan in NSW and Oaks Estate in the ACT. West of the Queanbeyan railway station is a cutting where folding has overturned the beds, with axes dipping to the east at 50 degrees. 300 metres of thickness is exposed in this cutting. Llanvirnian age (Pygodus serrus conodont zone). Fossils found include Phyllograptus anna, Trigonograptus ensiformus, Pterograptus, Didymograptus, Isograptus, Hallograptus from the Darriwillian age. Near the top of the formation are fossils Dicellograptus sextans, D divaricatus, D salopiensis, which are Gisbornian.|$|E
500|$|... {{formations}} in {{the area}} date from the Triassic and early Jurassic periods, and have been named Zerqa and Kurnub formations. The rock formations are marine sediments, remnants of the prehistoric Tethys Sea, which used to cover the area running roughly east–west, halfway across the present Dead Sea. Along the Zarqa, we find crystalline limestone alternating with shale. The next layer is a 20-30 meter high layer of gypsum, <b>argillaceous</b> marly lime, shales and iron-rich stone and sandstone. This layer is rich in fossils. The Zarqa valley was an important passageway connecting the Eastern Desert with the Jordan Valley.|$|E
500|$|In 1946, the Planning Office for Oslo Central Station, led by Fin Hvoslef, was {{established}} by the government. In 1950, they presented a new report, which recommended that a new route for the tunnel be considered to ease construction and increase safety. This was in part based on an engineering report from 1949, which had made the first detailed plans for the line. It was a compromise between the Norwegian State Railways' need for a line as straight as possible, and Oslo Municipality's demands that the construction {{should not be a}} risk to buildings in the area. The ground in Oslo consists of clay-filled grooves up to [...] deep. The area also contains alum shale, which expands when it comes into contact with air and water and can attack concrete, <b>argillaceous</b> schist, cracks with clay and water, and hard volcanic rocks.|$|E
500|$|Sleaford is the {{principal}} market town in the North Kesteven district of Lincolnshire. The civil parish includes the hamlet of Holdingham to the north east and the village of Quarrington to the south east, both of which merge with the town. The County Council's State of the Environment Report (1994) found that roughly three-quarters of Lincolnshire is low-lying, with much of it near sea-level; Sleaford lies approximately 43 feet (13 m) above sea level close to Lincoln Cliff, a Limestone scarp running north–south through Lindsey and Kesteven. The bedrock under the western half of the town belongs to the Great Oolite Group of Jurassic Sandstone, Limestone and <b>Argillaceous</b> rocks formed 168−165 million years ago; Kellaways and Oxford Clay formations, dated to 165–156 million years ago, underlie the eastern half. Alluvium deposits are found along the Slea's course, and Fen sand and gravel are found {{to the east and}} south. The county's agricultural land is generally of [...] "very good" [...] quality; as a result, intensive arable and vegetable farming is predominant and pastoral farming declined {{over the course of the}} 20th century. Sleaford is on the edge of the Fens, a low-lying region of the East of England which, before drainage from the 17th to the 20th centuries, were marshy and liable to flooding. Draining has revealed nutrient-rich soils and enabled 88% of the land to be cultivated, especially for arable farming, and most of it is graded amongst the most productive farmland in the country.|$|E

2500|$|The subsoil of the Andaman islands {{consists}} essentially of Late Jurassic to Early Eocene ophiolites and {{sedimentary rocks}} (<b>argillaceous</b> and algal limestones), deformed by numerous deep faults and thrusts with ultramafic igneous intrusions. [...] There {{are at least}} 11 mud volcanoes on the islands.|$|E
2500|$|... "Natural" [...] cements {{correspond}} to certain cements of the pre-Portland era, produced by burning <b>argillaceous</b> limestones at moderate temperatures. The level of clay {{components in the}} limestone (around 30–35%) is such that large amounts of belite (the low-early strength, high-late strength mineral in Portland cement) are formed without the formation of excessive amounts of free lime. As with any natural material, such cements have highly variable properties.|$|E
2500|$|The beds {{consists}} of thin to very thick layers {{of a light}} grey, fine grained <b>argillaceous</b> sandstone, containing a small calcareous element. [...] The sandstones are occasionally intercalated with very thin-bedded blue-grey claystone. [...] In places, the sandstone is overlain by the upper Burgsvik beds, which comprise thin-bedded, light-to-bluish grey, oolitic limestone with, here and there, alternating sandy beds containing problematic structures described by Manten (1966).|$|E
2500|$|The {{characterisation}} of soils {{is mainly}} {{related to the}} inclination of the terrain. The Asociación Monserrate type soil occurs in areas with inclinations between 30 and 75%. The dark well-draining soils originate from the Plaeners Formation of the Guadalupe Group with influence of volcanic ashes, are thinner than [...] and very acidic with a pH of 4.4. The Asociación Cabrera-Cruz Verde type soils exist at moderate inclinations between 12 and 50%, are derived from <b>argillaceous</b> rocks with volcanic ash influence, have a fast drainage and a pH between 4.5 and 5.0. The Complejos Coluviales {{are present in the}} undulated areas with inclinations below 12%, susceptible to erosion, and are apt for intensive agriculture.|$|E
2500|$|The Bogotá Formation, {{named after}} the capital, is a Paleocene to Lower Eocene <b>argillaceous</b> unit, concordantly {{overlying}} the lower Paleogene sequence. The formation is composed of grey, purple and red shales with micaceous sandstone beds towards {{the top of the}} stratigraphical unit. The thickness in the subsurface of the Bogotá savanna ranges from [...] and outcrops {{at the edges of the}} flatlands. In this formation fossils of the ungulate Etayoa bacatensis, {{named after the}} name for the savanna and its main settlement in present-day Funza, used by the native Muisca; Bacatá, have been found. The estimated size of the South American hoofed mammal was that of a dog. Other fossilised fragments found in the Bogotá Formation are molds of Stephania palaeosudamericana and Menispina evidens.|$|E
2500|$|Within the Dox Formation, the Comanche Point Member overlies the Solomon Temple Member. Within {{the central}} Grand Canyon, {{it has been}} removed by pre-Tapeats Sandstone erosion. The strata of this member consist mainly of {{interbedded}} fine grained, slope-forming, <b>argillaceous</b> sandstone and sandy argillite, and subordinate claystone. The colors exhibited by these strata are variegated, typically alternating between purplish and red-brown. Five pale green-to-white, leached red beds that are as much as [...] thick give a variegated appearance to this member. Salt casts, ripple marks, and desiccation cracks are common in the Comanche Point Member. It also contains a few thin beds of stromatolitic dolomite. These stromatolitic dolomite beds occur either within or directly adjacent to the leached beds. In the eastern Grand Canyon, the Comanche Point Member occupies {{more than half of}} the Dox outcrop area and is distinguished from enclosing members by its slope-forming and color variegated character.|$|E
2500|$|The Qomolangma Formation, {{also known}} as the Jolmo Lungama Formation or the Everest Formation, runs from the summit {{to the top of the}} Yellow Band, about [...] above sea level. It {{consists}} of greyish to dark grey or white, parallel laminated and bedded, Ordovician limestone inter layered with subordinate beds of recrystallised dolomite with <b>argillaceous</b> laminae and siltstone. Gansser first reported finding microscopic fragments of crinoids in this limestone. Later petrographic analysis of samples of the limestone from near the summit revealed them to be composed of carbonate pellets and finely fragmented remains of trilobites, crinoids, and ostracods. Other samples were so badly sheared and recrystallised that their original constituents could not be determined. A thick, white-weathering thrombolite bed that is [...] thick comprises the foot of the [...] "Third Step", and base of the summit-pyramid of Everest. This bed, which crops out starting about [...] below the summit of Mount Everest, consists of sediments trapped, bound, and cemented by the biofilms of micro-organisms, especially cyanobacteria, in shallow marine waters. The Qomolangma Formation is broken up by several high-angle faults that terminate at the low angle normal fault, the Qomolangma Detachment. This detachment separates it from the underlying Yellow Band. The lower five metres of the Qomolangma Formation overlying this detachment are very highly deformed.|$|E

6000|$|Professor Dana further remarks: [...] "Over {{interior}} oceanic basins {{as well as}} off a {{coast in}} quiet depths, fifteen or twenty fathoms and beyond, the deposits are mostly of fine silt, fitted for making fine <b>argillaceous</b> rocks, as shales or slates. When, however, {{the depth of the}} ocean falls off below a hundred fathoms, the deposition of silt in our existing oceans mostly ceases, unless {{in the case of a}} great bank along the border of a continent." ...|$|E

"May it please you, then, {{my right}} worshipful lord, this Farnoo is an unctuous, <b>argillaceous</b> substance; {{in its natural}} state, soft, malleable, and easily worked as the cornelian-red clay from the famous pipe-quarries of the wild tribes to the North. But though mostly found buried in terra-firma, {{especially}} in the isles toward the East, this Farnoo, my lord, is sometimes thrown up by the ocean; in seasons of high sea, being plentifully found on the reefs. But, my lord, like amber, the precise nature and origin of this Farnoo are points widely mooted." ...|$|E
6000|$|The gravel-capped cliffs at {{the mouth}} of the river are 355 feet in height: the lower part, to a {{thickness}} of fifty or sixty feet, consists of a more or less hardened, darkish, muddy, or <b>argillaceous</b> sandstone (like the lowest bed of Port Desire), containing very many shells, some silicified and some converted into yellow calcareous spar. The great oyster is here numerous in layers; the Trigonocelia and Turritella are also very numerous: it is remarkable that the Pecten Paranensis, so common in all other parts of the coast, is here absent: the shells consist of:-- ...|$|E
6000|$|The clay-slate is {{generally}} fissile, sometimes siliceous or ferruginous, with veins of quartz and calcareous spar; it often assumes, {{especially on the}} loftier mountains, an altered feldspathic character, passing into feldspathic porphyry: occasionally it is associated with breccia and grauwacke. At Good Success Bay, {{there is a little}} intercalated black crystalline limestone. At Port Famine much of the clay-slate is calcareous, and passes either into a mudstone or into grauwacke, including odd-shaped concretions of dark <b>argillaceous</b> limestone.
