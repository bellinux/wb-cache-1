40|$|At the {{reinsurance}} {{market the}} object of purchase and sale is a specific product - <b>a</b> <b>reinsurance</b> service.

The concepts of "reinsurance service demand" and "reinsurance service supply" have been clarified. Reinsurance service demand is a conscious and financially secured desire to buy reinsurance services. Reinsurance service supply is all services submitted in the reinsurance market...|$|R
