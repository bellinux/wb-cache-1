5|$|Because of {{the change}} in {{designated}} values relative to the WHERE clause, from <b>a</b> <b>logic</b> perspective the law of excluded middle is a tautology for CHECK constraints, meaning CHECK (p OR NOT p) always succeeds.

5|$|Specifying power levels over 100% {{may seem}} nonsensical, {{but there was}} <b>a</b> <b>logic</b> behind it. The 100% level {{does not mean the}} maximum {{physical}} power level attainable, rather it was a specification decided on during engine development—the expected rated power level. When later studies indicated the engine could operate safely at levels above 100%, these higher levels became standard. Maintaining the original relationship of power level to physical thrust helps reduce confusion, as it created an unvarying fixed relationship so that test data (or operational data from past or future missions) can be easily compared. If the power level was increased, and that new value was said to be 100%, then all previous data and documentation would either require changing, or cross-checking against what physical thrust corresponded to 100% power level on that date. Engine power level affects engine reliability, with studies indicating the probability of an engine failure increasing rapidly with power levels over 104.5%, which was why power levels above 104.5% were retained for contingency use only.|$|E

25|$|But the use {{of stable}} models in answer set {{programming}} {{provides a different perspective}} on such programs. In that programming paradigm, a given search problem is represented by <b>a</b> <b>logic</b> program so that the stable models of the program correspond to solutions. Then programs with many stable models correspond to problems with many solutions, and programs without stable models correspond to unsolvable problems. For instance, the eight queens puzzle has 92 solutions; to solve it using answer set programming, we encode it by <b>a</b> <b>logic</b> program with 92 stable models. From this point of view, logic programs with exactly one stable model are rather special in answer set programming, like polynomials with exactly one root in algebra.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — A {{temporal}}ization of <b>a</b> modal <b>logic</b> is <b>a</b> temporal <b>logic</b> {{containing the}} modal logic and the temporalization {{problem is the}} problem of construction and classification of temporal-ization for <b>a</b> given modal <b>logic.</b> <b>A</b> temporal <b>logic</b> carries two dual pairs of modal operators and. By taking each pair of them, one obtains <b>a</b> normal modal <b>logic.</b> In this situation, we refer to the temporal <b>logic</b> as <b>a</b> strict temporalization of the normal modal logic. Under mathematical morphological investigation over non-classical logics, the author showed that an adjoint pair of modal operators gives rise to <b>a</b> temporal <b>logic</b> ([1]). This result can be used to show the existence of a temporalization for <b>a</b> normal modal <b>logic.</b> By combining with canonical models, mathematical morphology illustrates the relationship between <b>a</b> modal <b>logic</b> and its temporalization. In this article, we will show how morphological analysis is applied to the temporalization problem. I...|$|R
