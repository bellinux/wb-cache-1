500|$|Muransky is also {{remembered for}} a cameo {{appearance}} in the 1983 film The Big Chill: [...] "I was in the theater watching it, not knowing {{what was going to}} happen. It was kind of interesting with all of (the characters) watching (the 1980 Michigan-Michigan State game). It was pretty cool. Watching [...] John Wangler go back was pretty cool. For a split-second as they're going back, I'm thinking to myself, 'Oh my God, I pray to God I'm not holding or I missed a block for a sack or something on the big screen pass.' But it was a good block, and it was a fun moment. <b>Any</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> hear 'The Big Chill,' it's good memories." ...|$|E
500|$|Milk drifted from California to Texas to New York, {{without a}} steady job or plan. In New York City he became {{involved}} with O'Horgan's theater company as a [...] "general aide", signing on as associate producer for Lenny and for Eve Merriam's Inner City. The time he had spent with the cast of flower children wore away much of Milk's conservatism. A contemporary New York Times story about O'Horgan described Milk as [...] "a sad eyed man—another aging hippie with long, long hair, wearing faded jeans and pretty beads". Craig Rodwell read {{the description of the}} formerly uptight man and wondered if it could be the same person. One of Milk's Wall Street friends worried that he seemed to have no plan or future, but remembered Milk's attitude: [...] "I think he was happier than at <b>any</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> had ever seen him in his entire life." ...|$|E

500|$|At the US National Championships he equaled his 100m best of 9.84s {{while running}} into the wind. This was a meeting record and the second fastest 100m time with a {{headwind}} after Maurice Greene's 9.82s run. He followed this with a new 200m personal best in the finals, again facing an impeding wind. His time of 19.62s was the second fastest ever; only Johnson's 19.32s run at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics was faster. Gay was happy with the achievement but noted that the competition was still strong: [...] "I wasn't thinking about <b>any</b> <b>time.</b> <b>I</b> {{was trying to get}} away from Spearmon as fast as I could." [...] After noting that he was feeling worn out, Gay had a brief recuperation period in preparation for the 2007 World Championships in Osaka, Japan. He returned to the track in Europe and, while weather conditions were poor, he won the 200m in Lausanne with 19.78s and had wins at 100m events in Sheffield and London. He relished the opportunity to face Powell at the World Championships: both sprinters were undefeated that year and Gay said that he felt ready for the challenge.|$|E
2500|$|I have no {{statute that}} I had in mind. Perhaps {{everything}} that I did wasn't legal....It became {{a question of}} 'Are you American, or are you not?'"

2500|$|On his eightieth birthday, Carmichael was reflective, observing, [...] "I'm a bit {{disappointed}} in myself. I know I could have accomplished {{a hell of}} a lot more... I could write anything <b>any</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> wanted to. But I let other things get in the way.... I've been floating around in the breeze." [...] He spent his final years at home in Rancho Mirage, near Palm Springs, California, where he continued to play golf and remained an avid coin collector.|$|E

2500|$|During {{his stay}} at Green Bay, Lombardi once {{emerged from his}} office and {{appeared}} before his secretary, Ruth McKloskey, wearing [...] "...all these priest robes on, {{and he had a}} miter with a tassel, everything." [...] Each day on his way to work for the Green Bay Packers, Lombardi would stop at St. Willebrord Church and [...] "offer a prayer in case of unexpected death: 'My God, if I am to die today, or suddenly at <b>any</b> <b>time,</b> <b>I</b> wish to receive this Communion as my viaticum...'". He regularly attended Sunday Mass at Resurrection Church in the Allouez neighborhood of Green Bay's southeast side, always sitting with his wife {{in the middle of the}} ninth pew.|$|E
2500|$|Mishnah Sheviit chapter 10 and Tosefta Sheviit 8:3–11 {{interpreted}} [...] {{to address}} debts and the Sabbatical year. The Mishnah {{held that the}} Sabbatical year cancelled loans, whether they were secured by a bond or not, but did not cancel debts to a shopkeeper or unpaid wages of a laborer, unless these debts were made into loans. When Hillel saw people refraining from lending, in transgression of [...] he ordained the prosbul (...) , which ensured the repayment of loans notwithstanding the Sabbatical year. Citing the literal meaning of [...] — [...] "this is {{the word of the}} release" [...] — the Mishnah held that a creditor could accept payment of a debt notwithstanding an intervening Sabbatical year, if the creditor had first by word told the debtor that the creditor relinquished the debt. A prosbul prevents the remission of debts in the Sabbatical year. Hillel saw that people were unwilling to lend money to one another and disregarded the precept laid down in [...] "Beware that there be not a base thought in your heart saying, ‘The seventh year, the year of release, is at hand'; and your eye be evil against your needy brother, and you give him nothing," [...] and Hillel therefore decided to institute the prosbul. The text of the prosbul says: [...] "I hand over to you, So-and-so, the judges in such-and-such a place, my bonds, so that I may be able to recover any money owing to me from So-and-so at <b>any</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> shall desire."
