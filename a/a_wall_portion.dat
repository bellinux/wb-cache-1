40|$|DE 102005044403 B 3 UPAB: 20061018 NOVELTY - Projectile {{accelerating}} device has a barrel (2) along which the projectile (4) is accelerated when a valve system {{connected to a}} pressure chamber (1) is opened. The barrel has <b>a</b> <b>wall</b> <b>portion</b> in which a connecting opening to the pressure chamber is provided. In {{this area of the}} barrel, the wall portion has an internal cross-sectional contour, so that when the projectile is in its firing position, it gas-tightly covers the connecting opening. An actuator pushes the projectile from its firing position {{towards the end of the}} barrel, so that the projectile opens the connecting opening. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is included for a method of accelerating a projectile using gas pressure. USE - For testing the strength of mechanical structures, using equipment, such as plate impact systems, crash systems, Split-Hopkinson pressure bars etc. ADVANTAGE - Compact structure with optimized acceleration along a short barrel.

The wall portion includes a unit i. e. positive pressure detector, which experiences deformation that is irreversible {{in the course of}} an intended use of an actuator during application of pressure by a working medium e. g. liquid, with exceedance of predetermined maximum pressure. The unit is designed {{in the form of a}} predetermined breaking point, a diaphragm or a deformable diaphragm wall (9). The unit and the actuator are connected as a single piece. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a method for positive pressure detection in an operating volume filled by a working medium and provided of an actuator. USE - Device for positive pressure detection in an operating volume of an actuator i. e. robotic gripper, in industrial processing and manufacturing fields. ADVANTAGE - The unit experiences the deformation that is irreversible in the course of the intended use of the actuator during the application of pressure by the working medium with exceedance of the predetermined maximum pressure, thus reducing a number of components for configuring the device, and hence realizing a simple and inexpensive device.

50|$|The Tungri, not {{mentioned}} by Caesar, came to dominate {{this area in}} the Roman era, and are {{the reason for the}} name of the modern name Tongeren. Tacitus says that Tungri was a new name for the original tribes who had previously been called the Germani. But many modern writers believe that the Gallo-Roman population of the area contained a significant amount of more recent Germanic immigrants from across the Rhine. Located on the important road linking Cologne to Bavay via the relay of Liberchies, and surrounded by the fertile lands of the Hesbaye region, Roman Tongeren quickly became one of the largest Gallo-Roman administrative and military towns in the first century. It suffered from a destructive fire during the Batavian siege in 70 AD, which was part of the Batavian revolt.

40|$|SummaryA 78 -year-old woman {{presented}} with leg edema and exertional dyspnea. Echocardiography revealed a smooth-surfaced mass {{adjacent to the}} left atrium in the pericardial cavity with a massive pericardial effusion.

40|$|PURPOSE: Aortic wall {{calcification}} {{is problematic}} in stentless porcine valves. We evaluated the possible anticalcification effect of photo-oxidation on the aortic <b>wall</b> <b>portion</b> of porcine stentless bioprostheses. A comparison with glutaraldehyde-fixed tissue was made. METHODS: Six Photofix and six Freestyle valves were implanted in juvenile sheep in pulmonary position. Valves were explanted after 3 or 6 months and examined macroscopically, by x-ray, light, and transmission electron microscopy. Calcium content {{was determined by}} atomic absorption spectrometry. RESULTS: The aortic <b>wall</b> <b>portion</b> of all Photofix valves remained free from calcification, while the <b>wall</b> <b>portion</b> of glutaraldehyde-fixed valves calcified strongly, both after 3 and 6 months. Calcium content of the aortic <b>wall</b> <b>portion</b> was: 0. 71 +/- 1. 27 in the Photofix valves versus 10. 78 +/- 77. 22 in the Freestyle valves (P < 0. 05).
