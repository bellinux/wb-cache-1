5|$|<b>Aphasia</b> is {{the result}} of damage to the brain's {{language}} centres affecting production, comprehension, or both, and can cause severe, chronic language impairment. Individuals with <b>aphasia</b> often communicate using a combination of speech, gestures, and aided communication; the proportion of each may change as the person recovers, and depends on the context and the individual's skills.|$|E
5|$|Early work in {{neurolinguistics}} {{involved the}} study of language in people with brain lesions, to see how lesions in specific areas affect language and speech. In this way, neuroscientists in the 19th century discovered that two areas in the brain are crucially implicated in language processing. The first area is Wernicke's area, which {{is located in the}} posterior section of the superior temporal gyrus in the dominant cerebral hemisphere. People with a lesion in this area of the brain develop receptive <b>aphasia,</b> a condition {{in which there is a}} major impairment of language comprehension, while speech retains a natural-sounding rhythm and a relatively normal sentence structure. The second area is Broca's area, located in the posterior inferior frontal gyrus of the dominant hemisphere. People with a lesion to this area develop expressive <b>aphasia,</b> meaning that they know what they want to say, they just cannot get it out. They are typically able to understand what is being said to them, but unable to speak fluently. Other symptoms that may be present in expressive <b>aphasia</b> include problems with fluency, articulation, word-finding, word repetition, and producing and comprehending complex grammatical sentences, both orally and in writing. Those with this <b>aphasia</b> also exhibit ungrammatical speech and show inability to use syntactic information to determine the meaning of sentences. Both expressive and receptive <b>aphasia</b> also affect the use of sign language, in analogous ways to how they affect speech, with expressive <b>aphasia</b> causing signers to sign slowly and with incorrect grammar, whereas a signer with receptive <b>aphasia</b> will sign fluently, but make little sense to others and have difficulties comprehending others' signs. This shows that the impairment is specific to the ability to use language, not to the physiology used for speech production.|$|E
5|$|Neurolinguistic {{techniques}} {{are also used}} to study disorders and breakdowns in language, such as <b>aphasia</b> and dyslexia, and how they relate to physical characteristics of the brain.|$|E
50|$|The <b>aphasias</b> {{listed below}} are {{examples}} of acute <b>aphasias</b> which can result from brain injury or stroke.|$|R
50|$|The {{acquired}} language disorders {{that are}} associated to brain activity are called <b>aphasias.</b> Depending on {{the location of the}} damage, the <b>aphasias</b> can present several differences.|$|R
25|$|Conduction and transcortical <b>aphasias</b> {{are caused}} by damage to the white matter tracts. These <b>aphasias</b> spare the cortex of the {{language}} centers, but instead create a disconnection between them.|$|R
5|$|Cognition {{can also}} be {{affected}} in Wilson's disease. This comes in two, not mutually exclusive, categories: frontal lobe disorder (may present as impulsivity, impaired judgement, promiscuity, apathy and executive dysfunction with poor planning and decision making) and subcortical dementia (may present as slow thinking, memory loss and executive dysfunction, without signs of <b>aphasia,</b> apraxia or agnosia). It is suggested that these cognitive involvements are related and closely linked to psychiatric manifestations of the disease.|$|E
5|$|The Edwin Smith Papyrus, {{an ancient}} Egyptian medical {{treatise}} {{written in the}} 17th century BC, contains the earliest recorded reference to the brain. The hieroglyph for brain, occurring eight times in this papyrus, describes the symptoms, diagnosis, and prognosis of two traumatic injuries to the head. The papyrus mentions the external surface of the brain, the effects of injury (including seizures and <b>aphasia),</b> the meninges, and cerebrospinal fluid.|$|E
5|$|In March 1923, Lenin {{suffered}} a third stroke {{and lost his}} ability to speak; that month, he experienced partial paralysis on his right side and began exhibiting sensory <b>aphasia.</b> By May, {{he appeared to be}} making a slow recovery, regaining some of his mobility, speech, and writing skills. In October, he made a final visit to the Moscow Kremlin. In his final weeks, Lenin was visited by Zinoviev, Kamenev, and Bukharin, with the latter visiting him at his Gorki mansion on the day of his death. On 21 January 1924, Lenin fell into a coma and died later that day. His official cause of death was recorded as an incurable disease of the blood vessels.|$|E

50|$|<b>Aphasias</b> {{are also}} seen in many elder adults. <b>Aphasias</b> are {{responsible}} for many sentence comprehension deficits. Many language-impaired patients make several complaints about short-term memory deficits, with several family members confirming that patients have trouble recalling previously known names and events. The opinion is supported by many studies showing that many aphasics also have trouble with visual-memory required tasks.|$|R
5|$|Language {{assessment}} {{will allow}} the recognition of medical conditions presenting with aphonia or dysarthria, neurological conditions such as stroke or dementia presenting with <b>aphasia,</b> and specific language disorders such as stuttering, cluttering or mutism. People with autism or Asperger syndrome may have abnormalities in paralinguistic and pragmatic aspects of their speech. Echolalia (repetition of another person's words) and palilalia (repetition of the subject's own words) can be heard with patients with autism, schizophrenia or Alzheimer's disease. A person with schizophrenia might use neologisms, which are made-up words which have a specific meaning to the person using them.|$|E
5|$|Unaided AAC {{systems are}} {{those that do not}} require an {{external}} tool, and include facial expression, vocalizations, gestures, and sign languages and systems. Informal vocalizations and gestures such as body language and facial expressions are part of natural communication, and such signals may be used by those with profound disabilities. More formalized gestural codes exist that lack a base in a naturally occurring language. For example, the Amer-Ind code is based on Plains Indian Sign Language, and has been used with children with severe-profound disabilities, and adults with a variety of diagnoses including dementia, <b>aphasia</b> and dysarthria. The benefits of gestures and pantomime are that they are always available to the user, usually understood by an educated listener, and are efficient means of communicating.|$|E
5|$|Augmentative and {{alternative}} communication {{is used by}} individuals to compensate for severe speech-language impairments in the expression or comprehension of spoken or written language. People making use of AAC include individuals {{with a variety of}} congenital conditions such as cerebral palsy, autism, intellectual disability, and acquired conditions such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, traumatic brain injury and <b>aphasia.</b> Prevalence data vary depending on the country and age/disabilities surveyed, but typically between 0.1 and 1.5% of the population are considered to have such severe speech-language impairments that they have difficulty making themselves understood, and thus could benefit from AAC. An estimated 0.05% of children and young people require high technology AAC. Well-known AAC users include physicist Stephen Hawking, broadcaster Roger Ebert and poet Christopher Nolan. Award-winning films such as My Left Foot and The Diving Bell and the Butterfly, based on books by AAC users Christy Brown and Jean-Dominique Bauby respectively, have brought the lives of those who use AAC to a wider audience.|$|E
50|$|A {{fascinating}} corollary of {{this has}} come from research on <b>aphasias</b> in deaf users of sign language, who show deficits in signing and comprehension analogous to Expressive and Receptive <b>aphasias</b> in hearing populations. These studies demonstrate that the grammatical functions of Broca's area and the semantic functions of Wernicke's area are indeed deep, abstract properties of the language system independent of its modality of expression.|$|R

25|$|Subcortical <b>aphasias</b> {{characteristics}} and symptoms {{depend upon the}} site and size of subcortical lesion. Possible sites of lesions include the thalamus, internal capsule, and basal ganglia.|$|R
5|$|The {{modern era}} of AAC {{began in the}} 1950s in Europe and North America, spurred by several {{societal}} changes; these included an increased awareness of individuals with communication and other disabilities, and a growing commitment, often backed by government legislation and funding, to develop their education, independence and rights. In the early years, AAC was primarily used with laryngectomy and glossectomy cases, and later with individuals with cerebral palsy and <b>aphasia.</b> It was typically only employed after traditional speech therapy had failed, as many felt hesitant to provide non-speech intervention to those {{who might be able}} to learn to speak. Individuals with intellectual impairment were not provided with AAC support because it was believed that they did not possess the prerequisite skills for AAC. The main systems used were manual signs, communication boards and Morse code, though in the early 1960s, an electric communication device {{in the form of a}} sip-and-puff typewriter controller named the Patient Operated Selector Mechanism (POSM or POSSUM) was developed in the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|In October 1932, Ravel {{suffered}} {{a blow to}} the head in a taxi accident. The injury was not thought serious at the time, but in a study for the British Medical Journal in 1988 the neurologist R. A. Henson concludes that it may have exacerbated an existing cerebral condition. As early as 1927 close friends had been concerned at Ravel's growing absent-mindedness, and within a year of the accident he started to experience symptoms suggesting <b>aphasia.</b> Before the accident he had begun work on music for a film, Don Quixote (1933), but he was unable to meet the production schedule, and Jacques Ibert wrote most of the score. Ravel completed three songs for baritone and orchestra intended for the film; they were published as Don Quichotte à Dulcinée. The manuscript orchestral score is in Ravel's hand, but Lucien Garban and Manuel Rosenthal helped in transcription. Ravel composed no more after this. The exact nature of his illness is unknown. Experts have ruled out the possibility of a tumour, and have variously suggested frontotemporal dementia, Alzheimer's disease and Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease. Though no longer able to write music or perform, Ravel remained physically and socially active until his last months. Henson notes that Ravel preserved most or all his auditory imagery and could still hear music in his head.|$|E
25|$|There are two {{different}} kinds of aphasic patients: Expressive <b>Aphasia</b> (also known as Broca's <b>Aphasia)</b> and receptive <b>aphasia</b> (also known as Wernicke's <b>Aphasia).</b> There are three distinctive dimensions to phonetics: manner of articulation, place of articulation, and voicing.|$|E
50|$|<b>Aphasia's</b> {{music and}} style was {{directly}} {{influenced by their}} collaborative approach to writing, its members being proficient in several forms of instrumentation and contributing to {{all aspects of the}} creative process.|$|R
50|$|Diseases and {{disorders}} of the brain, including alogia, <b>aphasias,</b> dysarthria, dystonia {{and speech}} processing disorders, where impaired motor planning, nerve transmission, phonological processing or {{perception of the}} message (as opposed to the actual sound) leads to poor speech production.|$|R
50|$|There are {{no known}} {{environmental}} {{risk factors for}} the progressive <b>aphasias.</b> However, one observational, retrospective study suggested that vasectomy could be {{a risk factor for}} PPA in men. These results have yet to be replicated or demonstrated by prospective studies.|$|R
25|$|Bilingual <b>aphasia</b> is a {{specific}} form of <b>aphasia</b> which affects one or more languages of a bilingual (or multilingual) individual. As of 2001, 45,000 new cases of bilingual <b>aphasia</b> are predicted annually in the United States. The main factors influencing the outcomes of bilingual <b>aphasia</b> are the number of languages spoken and {{the order in which}} they are learned—both influenced by the pattern of daily use and expertise in each language before the onset of <b>aphasia.</b> The type and severity of the <b>aphasia,</b> as well as the patient's levels of education and literacy also influence the functional outcomes of bilingual <b>aphasia.</b>|$|E
25|$|Transcortical motor <b>aphasia</b> and transcortical sensory <b>aphasia,</b> {{which are}} similar to Broca's and Wernicke's <b>aphasia</b> respectively, but the ability to repeat words and {{sentences}} is disproportionately preserved.|$|E
25|$|The term Anomic <b>Aphasia</b> usually {{refers to}} {{patients}} whose only prevalent symptom is impaired word retrieval in speech and writing. Typically, the spontaneous speech {{of a person}} with anomic <b>aphasia</b> is fluent and grammatically correct but contains many word retrieval failures. These failures lead to unusual pauses, talking around the intended word, or substituting a different word for the intended word. Anomic <b>aphasia</b> is the mildest form of <b>aphasia,</b> indicating a likely possibility for better recovery. Patients with Broca’s <b>aphasia</b> may also have difficulty with word retrieval, or anomia. In addition, patients with Broca’s <b>aphasia</b> comprehend spoken and written language better than they can speak or write. These patients self-monitor, are aware of their communicative impairments, and frequently try to repeat or attempt repairs. The preceding factors discussed correlate with a good prognosis for patients with Broca’s <b>aphasia.</b> Many patients with an acute onset of Broca’s <b>aphasia</b> eventually progress to milder forms of <b>aphasia,</b> such as conduction or anomic.|$|E
40|$|Transient <b>aphasias</b> {{are very}} common in {{patients}} during the acute days following neurosurgical resection in the language-dominant hemisphere. This study used quantitative analysis of connected speech to characterize the incidence and nature of these <b>aphasias,</b> to assess their recovery over time, and {{to determine whether there}} are systematic relationships between the location of surgical resection and specific deficits in various language domains. A cohort of 114 patients underwent neurosurgical resection in the language-dominant hemisphere. Language was evaluated by means of standardized assessment and connected speech elicitation prior to surgery, 2 - 3 days post-surgery and 1 month post-surgery. Voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping was used to elucidate any relationships between site of lesion and the specific language deficits identified by the connected speech analysis. High proportions of closed class words were associated with resections of the left middle and inferior temporal gyrus. Low proportions of closed class words were associated with resections of the left inferior frontal gyrus. Most language deficits observed 2 - 3 days post-surgery resolved by 1 month post-surgery. However, still present at one month were disruptions to fluency (including increased incidence of retracings and false starts),lexical access impairments, and speech sound errors (including increased incidence of phonological errors and distortions). These findings demonstrate that transient <b>aphasias</b> generally resolve within one month post-surgery. However, subtle language deficits left undetected by standardized language assessments sometimes persist beyond 1 month post-surgery...|$|R
50|$|It is {{important}} to note that there are typical difficulties with speech and language that come with normal aging as well. As we age language can become more difficult to process resulting in slowing of verbal comprehension, reading abilities and more likely word finding difficulties. With each of these though, unlike some <b>aphasias,</b> functionality within daily life remains intact.|$|R

25|$|<b>Aphasia</b> affects {{both the}} {{expression}} and reception of language.
