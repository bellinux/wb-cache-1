All of the city's newspapers editorialized against the strike and the public was, by and large, opposed to the strike as well. Several of the strike leaders, including James McMenamin and Frank Carney, were arrested for violating the anti-strike act. The NAACP played an active role both in pressuring the PTC <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> to institute fair hiring practices at the PTC for several years before the strike, and in maintaining the calm during the strike itself.|$|E

Lower-level administration is carried out by local authorities, which include city councils, district councils, and municipal councils, although autonomous statutory bodies can be created by {{the federal and state}} governments to deal with certain tasks. The federal constitution puts local authorities outside of the federal territories under the exclusive jurisdictions of the state government, although in practice the federal government has intervened in the affairs of state local governments. There are 144 local authorities, consisting of 11 city councils, 33 municipal councils, and 97 district councils.|$|E

With significant economic development and investment into the oil sands, the industry has been enjoying strong support by both the province's government <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government.</b> However, the industry has also been subject to criticism due to {{the environmental impacts of}} bitumen exploitation. While the industry has attempted to resolve these issues by developing new techniques, such as in situ extraction, environmental organizations, such as Greenpeace, have launched campaigns to delegitimize the resource, based on its greenhouse gas emission records.|$|E
5|$|On April 20, 2010, an {{explosion}} destroyed an {{offshore drilling rig}} at the Macondo Prospect in the Gulf of Mexico, causing a major sustained oil leak. Obama visited the Gulf, announced a federal investigation, and formed a bipartisan commission to recommend new safety standards, after a review by Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar and concurrent Congressional hearings. He then announced a six-month moratorium on new deepwater drilling permits and leases, pending regulatory review. As multiple efforts by BP failed, some {{in the media and}} public expressed confusion and criticism over various aspects of the incident, and stated a desire for more involvement by Obama <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government.</b>|$|E

The Enforcement Acts of 1870–1871 and the Civil Rights Act of 1875, in combating the violence and intimidation of white supremacy, were {{also part of the}} effort to end slave conditions for Southern blacks.

5|$|The Sierra Club and the San Diego National Audubon Society, {{as well as}} {{some other}} groups, sued the FHWA, USACE, and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to block the {{construction}} of the toll road over alleged breaches of the Endangered Species Act in October 2001; however, a San Diego judge sided with the contractor <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> in March 2003. The environmental concerns were resolved by the developer for $3.07 million and an agreement to work outside breeding times for the endangered species involved in May of that year; in return, the environmental groups agreed not to appeal the court decision. Some community groups also opposed the project.|$|E
5|$|Another {{conservation}} {{concern was}} made public in September 2008 when the Canadian government decided {{it was not necessary}} to enforce further protections (including the Species at Risk Act in place to protect endangered animals along their habitats) for killer whales aside from the laws already in place. In response to this decision, six environmental groups sued the federal government, claiming killer whales were facing many threats on the British Columbia Coast <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> did nothing to protect them from these threats. A legal and scientific nonprofit organization, Ecojustice, led the lawsuit and represented the David Suzuki Foundation, Environmental Defence, Greenpeace Canada, International Fund for Animal Welfare, the Raincoast Conservation Foundation, and the Wilderness Committee. Many scientists involved in this lawsuit, including Bill Wareham, a marine scientist with the David Suzuki Foundation, noted increased boat traffic, water toxic wastes, and low salmon population as major threats, putting approximately 87 killer whales on the British Columbia Coast in danger.|$|E

5|$|Articles 41–43 mandate the State to {{endeavour}} to secure to all citizens the right to work, a living wage, social security, maternity relief, and a decent standard of living. These provisions aim at establishing a socialist state as envisaged in the Preamble. Article 43 also places upon the State the responsibility of promoting cottage industries, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> has, in furtherance of this, established several Boards {{for the promotion of}} khadi, handlooms etc., in coordination with the state governments. Article 39A requires the State to provide free legal aid to ensure that opportunities for securing justice are available to all citizens irrespective of economic or other disabilities. Article 43A mandates the State to work towards securing the participation of workers in the management of industries. The State, under Article 46, is also mandated to promote the interests of and work for the economic uplift of the scheduled castes and scheduled tribes and protect them from discrimination and exploitation. Several enactments, including two Constitutional amendments, have been passed to give effect to this provision.|$|E
5|$|In 1873, Barton S. Alexander {{completed}} a {{report for the}} U.S. Army Corps of Engineers {{that was the first}} attempt at creating a Central Valley Project. In 1904, the Bureau of Reclamation (then the Reclamation Service) first became interested in creating such a water project, but did not get far involved until a series of droughts and related disasters occurred in the early 1920s. The State of California passed the Central Valley Project Act in 1933, which authorized Reclamation to sell revenue bonds in order to raise about $170 million for the project. Unfortunately, because of insufficient money in the state's treasury and the coincidence with the Great Depression, California turned to the national government for funding to build the project. This resulted in several transfers of the project between California <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government,</b> and between Reclamation and the Army Corps of Engineers. The first dams and canals of the project started going up in the late 1930s, and the last facilities were completed in the early 1970s. Other features of the project were never constructed, some lie partly finished, or are still awaiting authorization.|$|E
5|$|In 1936 the U.S. {{court ruled}} in U.S. v. One Package that {{medically}} prescribing contraception {{to save a}} persons life or well being was not illegal under the Comstock Law; following this decision, the American Medical Association Committee on Contraception revoked its 1936 statement condemning birth control. A national survey in 1937 showed 71 percent {{of the adult population}} supported the use of contraception. By 1938 347 birth control clinics were running in the United States despite their advertisement still being illegal. First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt publicly supported birth control and family planning. In 1966, President Lyndon B. Johnson started endorsing public funding for family planning services, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Government</b> began subsidizing birth control services for low-income families. The Affordable Care Act, passed into law on March 23, 2010 under President Barack Obama, requires all plans in the Health Insurance Marketplace to cover contraceptive methods.
