5|$|The modern administrative-territorial {{division}} of the Republic of Adygea is regulated by Law No.171 of May5, 2000 with subsequent amendments. The Law establishes the <b>administrative</b> <b>units</b> described below.|$|E
5|$|Historically; the {{division}} into ancient parishes {{was linked to}} the manorial system, with parishes and manors often sharing the same boundaries. However the Poor Law Amendment Act 1866 declared a divergence between the historic ecclesiastical parish and administrative functions within the locality, thus creating civil parishes. These <b>administrative</b> <b>units</b> formed the bottom-tier of local government within England and were established from 1866.|$|E

5|$|In the 13th century, a new fiscal {{system was}} {{introduced}} and the hundreds were gradually included into larger <b>administrative</b> <b>units</b> called len, with a castle {{serving as the}} administrative center. This new administrative development {{was a result of}} the increased power of the aristocracy. In each len, a noble man was put in charge, with the title lensmand.|$|E
5|$|James Campbell refutes {{suggestions}} that the hides given for each tribe were {{the sum of}} a system of locally-collected assessments and argues that a two-tier system of assessment, one for large areas such as kingdoms and a more accurate one for individual estates, may have existed. He considers the possibility that many of the tribes named in the Tribal Hidage were no more than <b>administrative</b> <b>units</b> and that some names did not originate from a tribe itself but from a place from where the people were governed, eventually coming to signify the district where the tribe itself lived. Barbara Yorke suggests that the -sætan/sæte form of several of the place-names are an indication that they were named after a feature of the local landscape. She also suggests the tribes were dependent <b>administrative</b> <b>units</b> and not independent kingdoms, some of which were created as such after the main kingdoms were stabilized.|$|E
5|$|London's vast {{urban area}} is often {{described}} using a set of district names, such as Bloomsbury, Mayfair, Wembley and Whitechapel. These are either informal designations, reflect the names of villages that have been absorbed by sprawl, or are superseded <b>administrative</b> <b>units</b> such as parishes or former boroughs.|$|E

5|$|An earlier {{administrative}} and political {{function of the}} area was {{to serve as a}} core area for one of the three provincial things that together elected the king of Denmark. The first Danish administrative sub-divisioning occurred as part of the centralization process, when the area became divided into <b>administrative</b> <b>units</b> called hundreds (herreder in Danish). The hundreds were possibly based on older, already existing units, but the establishment of the new form of hundreds was prompted by an increase in royal power during the High Middle Ages. These differed from the provincial thing areas in that they were not local communities joined under a governing assembly but top-down regional divisions established to ensure royal authority. These medieval Danish hundreds were used to implement military obligations and to expedite the collection of renders due to the king in the provinces. They were first established in Jutland, where they replaced previous <b>administrative</b> <b>units</b> called syssel. According to some scholars, they were introduced in Skåneland possibly as early as the 11th century.|$|E

5|$|Hastily deployed, {{the first}} {{contingent}} of AIF was essentially untrained and suffered from widespread equipment shortages. In early 1915 the AIF was largely an inexperienced force, {{with only a}} small percentage of its members having previous combat experience. However, many officers and non-commissioned personnel (NCOs) had previously served in the pre-war permanent or part-time forces, and a significant proportion of the enlisted personnel had received some basic military instruction as part of Australia's compulsory training scheme. Predominantly a fighting force based on infantry battalions and light horse regiments, the AIF had a high proportion of close combat troops to support personnel. Nevertheless, the AIF eventually included a large number of logistics and <b>administrative</b> <b>units</b> which were capable of meeting most of the force's needs, and in some circumstances provided support to nearby allied units. Each division also included a range of combat support and service units, including artillery, machine-gun, mortar, engineer, pioneer, signals, logistic, medical, veterinary and <b>administrative</b> <b>units.</b> Corps troops included light horse, army artillery, and cyclists. Regardless, the AIF mainly relied on the British Army for medium and heavy artillery support and other weapons systems necessary for combined arms warfare that were developed later in the war, including aircraft and tanks.|$|E
5|$|The kingdom {{was often}} divided into {{sections}} or provinces and governed separately. Rajarata, {{the area around}} the capital, was under the direct administration of the king, while the Ruhuna (southern part of the country) and the Malaya Rata (hill country) were governed by officials called apa and mapa. These <b>administrative</b> <b>units</b> were further divided into smaller units called rata. Officials called ratiya or ratika were in charge of these. The smallest administrative unit was the gama (village), under a village chief known as gamika or gamladda.|$|E
5|$|These {{leaders are}} charged with {{implementing}} {{the will of the}} president, reporting on the general mood and conditions of the regions, administering the civil service, keeping the peace, and overseeing the heads of the smaller <b>administrative</b> <b>units.</b> Governors have broad powers: they may order propaganda in their area and call in the army, gendarmes, and police. All local government officials are employees of the central government's Ministry of Territorial Administration, from which local governments also get most of their budgets.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} {{the second}} day, tens of {{thousands}} of defenders had been killed or captured. The remaining garrisons in the Gerfan and Ponticelli sectors were completely isolated. The logistical and <b>administrative</b> <b>units</b> were being overrun. Recognising that the situation was hopeless, General Bergonzoli and his staff had departed on foot for Tobruk during the afternoon, in a party of about 120 men. General Giuseppe Tellera, the commander of the Italian Tenth Army, considered the possibility of sending a force to relieve the Bardia fortress but in the end concluded that such an operation had no chance of success.|$|E
5|$|Stephen I granted {{privileges}} to the Roman Catholic Church, {{for example}} by ordering the general {{imposition of the}} tithe upon the population. Burials in most local pre-Christian cemeteries, for example at Hunedoara, only ceased around 1100. Stephen I also divided his kingdom, including the territories of modern Romania he had occupied, into counties, that is <b>administrative</b> <b>units</b> around royal fortresses, each administered by a royal official called count. In time the voivode, a higher royal official first attested in 1176, became the principal of all the counts in Transylvania. In contrast with Transylvania, the counts in modern Banat and Crişana remained {{in direct contact with}} the king who appointed and replaced them at will.|$|E
5|$|The civitas (tribal community) of the Helvetii {{was similar}} to that of the Celtic tribes of the Valais, which were merged into a single civitas Vallensis {{probably}} around 40AD, and given Forum Claudii Vallensium (Martigny) as their capital. Parts of the modern Ticino belonged to the colony of Comum (Como), founded in the 1st century AD. On the local level, the basic <b>administrative</b> <b>units</b> were the vici, replacing the Helvetic pagi, or tribes, which were dissolved at the time of colonization. These villages enjoyed a certain autonomy and were governed by popularly elected magistrates (magistri or curatores).|$|E

5|$|The {{programme}} originally called {{only for}} an initial training wing and six schools, {{but this was}} expanded to eight flying schools and a school for bomb aimers, navigators and air gunners. There were two air firing and bombing ranges. Six reserve landing grounds were constructed for landing and take-off instruction to prevent congestion on the main airstrips. Later in the war, a dedicated air station was designated for the training of instructors. Small <b>administrative</b> <b>units</b> were established in South Africa at Cape Town, Durban and Port Elizabeth to handle incoming equipment and arrivals and departures of personnel.|$|E
5|$|West Bengal is now {{divided into}} 23 districts which {{includes}} the newly formed Jhargram district, Alipurduar district and the Kalimpong district, Paschim Bardhaman district under five divisions and divisions are administered by Divisional Commissioners. Kolkata, {{the capital of the}} state, constitutes the Kolkata district. Other districts are further divided into <b>administrative</b> <b>units</b> such as subdivisions and blocks, administered by SDO and BDO, respectively. The Panchayati Raj has a three-tier structure in the state. The atomic unit is called a Gram Panchayat, which is the Panchayat organisation for a collection of villages. The block-level organisations are called Panchayat Samiti, and the district-level organisations are named Zilla Parishad.|$|E
5|$|During the Han, {{the empire}} {{was divided into}} large <b>administrative</b> <b>units</b> of kingdoms and commanderies; within a commandery there were {{counties}}, and within counties there were districts that contained at least several hamlets. An average hamlet contained about a hundred families and usually was enclosed by a wall with two gates. At the center of social life in the hamlet was the religious altar (built in honor of a local deity) where festivities could be staged. Each district and county also had an official religious altar. The official reach of government extended {{no further than the}} district level, where county-appointed officials included the chief of police who maintained law and order and the district tax collector. However, the government was able to control local society at the hamlet level with their bestowal of twenty ranks.|$|E
