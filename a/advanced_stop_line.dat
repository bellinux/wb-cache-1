50|$|On multi-lane roads, advance yield {{lines are}} used before mid-block crosswalks to prevent multiple-threat crashes. These occur when a driver yields to a {{pedestrian}} in a crosswalk, but the drivers {{in the adjacent}} lane cannot see the pedestrian because of the stopped vehicle. Another driver may pass the stopped vehicle and collide with pedestrians as they step out from in front of it. An advance yield line instructs the driver to stop {{far enough away from}} the crosswalk that other drivers can see around their vehicle. In jurisdictions where drivers are legally required to stop for pedestrians, an <b>advance</b> <b>stop</b> <b>line</b> may be used instead.|$|R

50|$|Traffic {{signals in}} most areas of Europe are located at the stop line on {{same side of the}} {{intersection}} as the approaching traffic (there being both right- and left-hand traffic) and are often mounted overhead as well as on side of the road. At particularly busy junctions for freight, higher lights may be mounted specifically for trucks. The stop line alignment is done to prevent vehicles blocking any crosswalk and allow for better pedestrian traffic flow. There may also be a special area a few meters in advance of the stop line where cyclists may legally wait but not motor vehicles; this <b>advanced</b> <b>stop</b> <b>line</b> is often painted with a different road surface with greater friction and a high colour, both for the benefit of cyclists and for other vehicles.

40|$|Abstract. Over {{the past}} two decades a range of {{different}} line marking techniques has been introduced to Melbourne’s arterial roads. These include wide kerbside lanes sometimes marked with bike symbols, exclusive bike lanes, parking and bike lanes, and <b>advanced</b> <b>stop</b> <b>lines</b> at signalised intersections. In parallel to their introduction, VicRoads has undertaken a wide range of studies to test the effects of the new treatments. This paper describes the range of line marking measures and the situations in which they have been applied. It summarises a series of video based studies which have observed the response of over 10, 000 car drivers- particularly changes to the tracking of cars. The studies emphasise the critical affect that line marking has on separating cyclists from motor vehicles and on the comfort and stress levels of cyclists...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Nowadays, various signalized intersections with bicycle lanes {{designs are}} {{available}} for implementation. However, no safety comparisons have been made between these various designs. Therefore, {{it is necessary to}} compare the various designs available. In this study, intersection designs from Western countries are investigated to determine the safety measures available. Then the safety and comfort are compared with left-hooks being focused. Five patterns were selected including (1) Mixed traffic with left-turning motorist; (2) Left-turn in the intersection for motorist; (3) Bicycle signal; (4) <b>Advanced</b> <b>stop</b> <b>lines</b> for bicycles; and (5) Bicycle box. The five intersection patterns were prepared at an experiment site, and human subjects consisting bicyclist and motorist were traveled on the specified route freely. Questionnaire surveys and video observations were used for data analyses. The results show that (1) Mixed traffic with left-turning motorist is the safest and (3) Bicycle signal is the most comfortable intersection design...|$|R
50|$|By 2012, cycling in Amsterdam {{had grown}} tremendously in {{popularity}} — up by some 40% {{in the previous}} twenty years. The city had 490,000 fietsers (cyclists) take to the road to cycle 2 million kilometres every day according to statistics of the city council. This has caused some problems as, despite 35,000 kilometers of bicycle paths, the country's 18 million bicycles (1.3 per citizen old enough to ride) were clogging Amsterdam's streets at peak times and parked bicycles were overcrowding train stations and other areas. This is being addressed by building even more bike lanes and bicycle parking stations with much greater capacity to tackle a problem many other cities {{in the world would}} envy, that of bicycle traffic congestion. Safety is also a concern, mainly on infrastructure that does not yet conform to the modern Dutch road safety policies of Sustainable Safety. <b>Advance</b> <b>stop</b> <b>lines</b> or otherwise little protection at traffic lights on distributor roads is a major cause of collisions, including the death of a 7-year-old girl under a garbage truck in 2013 on a road which did not include protected cycle paths.|$|R
40|$|There {{is always}} {{some degree of}} risk {{involved}} whenever a pedestrian crosses a street. One would think that risk should be somewhat decreased when a pedestrian crosses a street in a marked crosswalk. However, that {{is not always the}} case. Motorists don’t always acknowledge crosswalks and some fail to yield to pedestrians who are in crosswalks. This in turn has lead to some tragic outcomes. When pedestrians fear being able to safely cross a street that becomes a general access issue. By being denied ii access to crossing a street, people, especially those individuals with disabilities, are being denied access to employment and leisure activities. There are some steps that could be taken help ensure safety when crossing a street. For instance, <b>advanced</b> <b>stop</b> <b>lines</b> could be placed on the road so that motorists would stop further away from the crosswalk. Also some type of a sign could be placed, {{on the side of the}} road or above the road, to warn motorists of a crosswalk. A flashing yellow light could be used, as well, to warn motorists of a crosswalk. The crosswalk located at the corner of 10 th Street an...|$|R
40|$|Research was {{undertaken}} in Christchurch, New Zealand to investigate motor vehicle behavior near bicycle facilities at signalized intersections. Motorists not keeping clear of such facilities may limit their usefulness and safety for bicyclists. The main research {{objective was to}} assess motorists’ avoidance of colored facilities in comparison to uncolored ones. The research also investigated if wide combined bicycle and traffic lanes encourage drivers to queue side-by-side, thereby encroaching into bicyclist spaces. 18 sites were identified to evaluate the effect of colored surfacing and lane widths on {{the rate at which}} motorists encroach on marked bicycle spaces. The sites contained either <b>Advanced</b> <b>Stop</b> <b>Lines</b> (ASL) or <b>Advanced</b> <b>Stop</b> Boxes (ASB) and were a mix of colored and uncolored facilities with “narrow” and “wide” lane combinations. Manual surveys were carried out to observe the positions of motor vehicles in relation to the bicycle facilities. Four of the uncolored sites were then colored and “after” surveys conducted. The results showed that drivers were much less likely to encroach on colored bicycle spaces in comparison to uncolored ones, particularly ASLs. Motorists {{were also more likely to}} encroach on bicycle lanes in “wide” lane combinations. It is recommended that road agencies continue coloring new and existing bicycle facilities at intersections, with preference given to existing ASLs over ASBs and sites with wider approaches. Traffic and bicycle lane combinations greater than 5. 0 m (16 ½ ft) should also be avoided if separate turning traffic lanes are not present...|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} of the capacity implications of installing <b>Advanced</b> <b>Stop</b> <b>Lines</b> (ASLs) {{has been carried out}} by TRL Limited as part of a project entitled Cycling Facilities and Engineering, commissioned by the Charging and Local Transport Division of the Department for Transport. The study included a review of previous research into ASLs in the UK and in the Netherlands; an examination of the theoretical capacity implications of installing ASLs using OSCADY (Optimised Signal Capacity and Delay) the signal-controlled junction modelling computer programme and saturation flow formulae; 'before' and 'after' video surveys of modified junctions at four sites in Guildford, Surrey, and questionnaires to examine the attitudes of cyclists. While cyclists generally thought that the ASLs were safer and easier to use than unadapted junctions, concerns were expressed that some drivers did not comply with the new layout. Changes in the length of time between green signals or a longer minimum green time may be required in some circumstances. At the two sites where the number of traffic lanes remained the same there was a slight increase in saturation flow, but at the two sites where a traffic lane was removed large reductions in saturation flow were observed.

40|$|The Norwegian {{transportation}} {{authorities have}} the ambitious goal of improving cycle infrastructure {{in order to}} increase the share of cycle commuters. This project was undertaken to find design solutions for cycle facilities that terminate at intersections. Two sites with existing but discontinuous cycle facilities in Trondheim, Norway were used as a case study &# 150; a roundabout and a signalized regular intersection. An extensive literature review of best practices from around the world was carried out to provide different design solutions. Video recordings and on-site observations were carried out to gather data which was afterwards analyzed to get {{a better understanding of the}} behavior and interactions of the traffic users at intersections. Based on the results of the analysis, two solutions were suggested as being appropriate for the roundabout: Raised crossing at the approaches and Separate cycle paths in the inside of the roundabout. The proposed design implementations for the regular intersections were: Cycle lanes through the intersection, <b>Advanced</b> <b>Stop</b> <b>lines</b> and Cycle paths with sidewalk. Although the above solutions were based on the best international practices and the specifics of the studied sites, their expected positive effects cannot be guaranteed. That is why a before-and-after study is highly recommended in the case of their actual implementation. </p...|$|R
2500|$|How {{traffic signals}} are {{designed}} and implemented directly impacts cyclists. For instance, poorly adjusted vehicle detector systems, used to trigger signal changes, may not correctly detect cyclists. This can leave cyclists {{in the position}} of having to [...] "run" [...] red lights if no motorized vehicle arrives to trigger a signal change. Some cities use urban adaptive traffic control systems (UTCs), which use linked traffic signals to manage traffic in response to changes in demand. There is an argument that using a UTC system merely to provide for increased capacity for motor traffic will simply drive growth in such traffic. However, there are more direct negative impacts. For instance, where signals are arranged to provide motor traffic with so called green waves, this can create [...] "red waves" [...] for other road users such as cyclists and public transport services. Traffic managers in Copenhagen have now turned this approach on its head and are linking cyclist-specific traffic signals on a major arterial bike lane to provide green waves for rush hour cycle-traffic. However, this would still not resolve the problem of red-waves for slow (old and young) and fast (above average fitness) cyclists. Cycling-specific measures that can be applied at traffic signals include the use of <b>advanced</b> <b>stop</b> <b>lines</b> and/or bypasses. In some cases cyclists might be given a free-turn or a signal bypass if turning into a road on the nearside.|$|R
40|$|This report {{presents}} a before-after study of bike boxes at 10 signalized intersections in Portland, Oregon. The bike boxes, {{also known as}} <b>advanced</b> <b>stop</b> <b>lines</b> or <b>advanced</b> <b>stop</b> boxes, were installed to increase visibility of cyclists and reduce conflicts between motor vehicle and cyclists, particularly in potential ?right-hook? situations. Before and after video were analyzed for seven intersections with green bike boxes, three intersections with uncolored bike boxes, and two control intersections. User perceptions were measured through surveys of cyclists passing through five of the bike box intersections and of motorists working downtown, where the boxes were concentrated. Both the observations and survey of motorists found {{a high rate of}} compliance and understanding of the markings. Overall, 73 % of the stopping motor vehicles did not encroach at all into the bike box. Both motor vehicle and bicycle encroachment in the pedestrian crosswalk fell significantly at the bike box locations compared to the control intersections. The bike boxes had mixed effects on the motorists? encroachment in the bicycle lane. The number of observed conflicts at the bike box locations decreased, while the total number of cyclists and motor vehicles turning right increased. Negative-binomial models based upon the data predict fewer conflicts with the boxes, particularly as right-turning motor vehicle volumes increase. Observations of yielding behavior at two bike box and one control intersection found an improvement in motorists yielding to cyclists at the bike box locations. Differences in the traffic volumes and location contexts make firm conclusions about the effects of green coloring of the boxes difficult. Higher shares of surveyed motorists felt that the bike boxes made driving safer rather than more dangerous, even when the sample was narrowed to respondents who were not also cyclists. Over three-quarters of the surveyed cyclists thought that the boxes made the intersection safer...|$|R
40|$|Cycling is an {{important}} mode of travel for work, education, and other trips, and is {{a viable alternative to}} car travel especially for shorter trips. However, cycling is perceived to be a less safe mode. Cyclists are vulnerable road users and don't feel secure in the company of faster motorised modes. In this paper, safety measures are examined for cyclists by presenting low cost infrastructure solutions. This paper describes four sets of solutions. The first solution set deals with the provision of basic infrastructure for cyclists which should conform to the Austroads guidelines with proper attention to cyclists' space, surface quality, continuous routes and proper management of shared parking lanes. The second set of solutions is based on the concept of Bicycle Compatibility Index (BCI). This is a level-of-service concept developed by the U. S. Federal Highway Administration and is an index of the cyclists' comfort level. Instruments for improving BCI include parking controls, widening of bicycle lane or paved shoulder, and speed management. The third set recommends the choice of special intersection treatments. A world-wide review of treatments has been undertaken and a spectrum of safety measures including dashed bike lanes, coloured blue bike lanes, raised and painted bicycle crossings, profiled pavement marking, <b>advanced</b> <b>stopped</b> <b>lines,</b> signal phase design, roundabout design etc. have been examined with a view to developing an inventory of possible strategies for improving bicycle safety. Finally, a proposal to undertake a comprehensive study on modelling the comfort level of cyclists at roundabouts and intersections is also presented. This research would enable the evaluation of a variety of geometric and operational characteristics at intersections and roundabouts with a view to prescribing low cost solutions for improving intersection safety...|$|R
40|$|In {{recent years}} {{it has been the}} goal of traffic {{engineers}} {{to try to get the}} most out of the systems that they develop. By designing the most efficient systems the overall costs of transportation should be slightly easier to manage. As with all transportation infrastructure the design of traffic signals should be undertaken to produce the maximum benefits for the costs outlayed. The design and location of the vehicle detectors used for traffic actuated signals has for many years been taken for granted. The locations in which they are installed may not be the optimum for the efficient performance of the signal.

40|$|The Metropolitan Transport Strategy (1995) {{proposed}} {{moving from}} a transport system which was dominated by low occupancy car use, to a more balanced transport system of public transport and non-motorised transport options. Creating this change requires initiatives that create critical mass awareness, in work organisations and the community. The ‘Bike to Work Breakfast’ {{is an example of}} such an initiative. This year it was held on Friday 12 March, 2004 and aimed to increase awareness of, and promote cycling as an alternative mode of transport to and from work. A free healthy breakfast was provided to everyone who cycled on the day. A total of 1657 participants who attended the 2004 ‘Bike to Work Breakfast’ completed questionnaires.

Respondents cited a number of different reasons for cycling. The majority indicated improved fitness (88 %, n= 1460) and enjoyment (71 %, n= 759) as the main reasons for cycling. Almost half of respondents (44 %, n= 713) cycled on a daily basis whilst a further 704 (n= 43 %) participants reported cycling 2 - 3 times per week.
