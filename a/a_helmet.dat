He ordered that it be changed to <b>a</b> <b>helmet.</b>|$|E

5|$|Electromagnetic articulography {{uses the}} {{principle}} of electromagnetic induction to measure the position and movement of various points {{in and around the}} mouth. <b>A</b> <b>helmet</b> containing electromagnetic transmitters creates a variable magnetic field by running currents through the transmitters at different frequencies. Sensor coils placed midsagittally in the mouth produce current as they move through the magnetic field inversely proportional to the cube of the distance from the transmitters. The current induced alternates at the same frequency as the transmitter coil and the composite signal can be separated out to determine the distance from each individual coil, thus determining the position of the sensor in space.|$|E

40|$|The "snorfiets" is a moped with {{a limited}} speed of 20 km and on which the wearing of <b>a</b> crash <b>helmet</b> is not compulsory.

The danger for drivers on the "snorfiets" is expected to be greater than for cyclists, smaller than for moped riders without <b>a</b> crash <b>helmet</b> but equal to that for moped riders wearing <b>a</b> crash <b>helmet.</b> The influence of the introduction of the "snorfiets" on traffic safety in general is expected to be only small. In spite of the low speed limit of the "snorfiets" the wearing of <b>a</b> crash <b>helmet</b> would decrease the fatality and injury rate...|$|R
5|$|First {{appearing}} in Dead 'Ard and Warrior, The Black Currant returned {{in a series}} of White Dwarf Thrud strips titled Thrud the Destroyer.

5|$|Stephen's rule {{consolidated}} {{the usage}} of the coat of arms of Moldavia, featuring the aurochs head (first attested in 1387), sometimes as <b>a</b> <b>helmet</b> atop his personal arms. He revived the elaborate design introduced under Alexander the Good, which also featured a rose, crescent, sun and star (often, but not always, five-pointed); its tinctures remain unknown. This arrangement was not familiar to heraldists in Western Europe. By the 1530s, they represented Moldavia with attributed arms featuring Maures; these arms, though originally used for Wallachia, possibly echoed Stephen's victories over the Ottomans.|$|E
