5|$|Later in 1969, Biden ran as a Democrat for the New Castle County Council on {{a liberal}} {{platform}} that included support for public {{housing in the}} suburban area. He won by a solid, two-thousand vote margin in the usually Republican district and in a bad year for Democrats in the state. Even before taking his seat, he was already talking <b>about</b> <b>running</b> <b>for</b> the U.S. Senate {{in a couple of}} years. He served on the County Council from 1970 to 1972 while continuing his private law practice. Among issues he addressed on the council was his opposition to large highway projects that might disrupt Wilmington neighborhoods, including those related to Interstate 95.|$|E
5|$|Schwarzkopf {{returned}} to the United States after the Gulf War as a national hero, {{and his ability to}} effectively deal with the press left him a positive image. Schwarzkopf indicated a desire to retire from the military in mid-1991. He was initially considered for promotion alternatively to General of the Army or to Army Chief of Staff, and was ultimately asked to assume the latter post, but he declined. He was later questioned <b>about</b> <b>running</b> <b>for</b> political office, but, considering himself an independent, expressed little interest in doing so. Schwarzkopf was not vocal about his political opinions during his military career. He retired from the military in August 1991, moving to Tampa, Florida.|$|E

5|$|In April 1962, McGovern {{announced}} he would run for election to South Dakota's other Senate seat, intending to face incumbent Republican Francis H. Case. Case died in June, however, and McGovern instead faced an appointed senator, former Lieutenant Governor Joseph H. Bottum. Much of the campaign revolved around policies of the Kennedy administration and its New Frontier; Bottum accused the Kennedy family of trying to buy the Senate seat. McGovern appealed to those worried about the outflux of young people from the state, and had the strong support of the Farmers Union. Polls showed Bottum slightly ahead throughout the race and McGovern was hampered by a recurrence of his hepatitis problem in the final weeks of the campaign. (During this hospitalization, McGovern read Theodore H. White's classic The Making of the President, 1960 {{and for the first}} time began thinking <b>about</b> <b>running</b> <b>for</b> the office someday.) Eleanor McGovern campaigned for her ailing husband and may have preserved his chance of winning. The November 1962 election result was very close and required a recount, but McGovern's 127,458 votes prevailed by a margin of 597, making him the first Democratic senator from the state in 26 years and only the third since statehood in 1889.|$|E
25|$|In 1894, a {{group of}} reform Republicans {{approached}} Roosevelt <b>about</b> <b>running</b> <b>for</b> Mayor of New York again; he declined, mostly due to his wife's resistance to being removed from the Washington social set. Soon after he declined, {{he realized that he}} had missed an opportunity to reinvigorate a dormant political career. He retreated to the Dakotas for a time; his wife Edith regretted her role in the decision and vowed {{that there would be no}} repeat of it.|$|E
25|$|Upon Roosevelt's {{return to}} New York in 1886, Republican leaders quickly {{approached}} him <b>about</b> <b>running</b> <b>for</b> mayor of New York City. Roosevelt accepted the nomination despite having {{little hope of}} winning the race against United Labor Party candidate Henry George and Democratic candidate Abram Hewitt. Roosevelt campaigned hard for the position, but Hewitt won with 41% (90,552 votes), taking the votes of many Republicans who feared George's radical policies. George was held to 31% (68,110 votes), and Roosevelt took third place with 27% (60,435 votes). Fearing that his political career might never recover, Roosevelt {{turned his attention to}} writing The Winning of the West, a historical work tracking the westward movement of Americans; the book was a great success for Roosevelt, earning favorable reviews and selling numerous copies.|$|E
50|$|Occasionally, when media {{begin to}} {{speculate}} <b>about</b> persons <b>running</b> <b>for</b> statewide office in Ohio, Eckart is usually mentioned by prognosticators for United States Senator.

25|$|Robinson {{remained}} in the Seanad for four more years, although at this point {{many of the issues}} she had campaigned for had been tackled. Contraception had been legalised although heavily restricted, women were on juries, and the marriage bar on women in the civil service had been revoked. To the surprise of many, she decided not to seek re-election to the senate in 1989. One year later, however, Labour approached her <b>about</b> <b>running</b> <b>for</b> president in that year's election. She thought she was being asked her legal advice about the type of policy programme party leader Dick Spring was proposing. However, as she read the briefing notes, she began to realise that the programme was aimed at her. After some consideration, she agreed to become the first Labour nominee for the presidency and the first woman candidate in what was only the second presidential election to be contested by three candidates since 1945.|$|E
500|$|While he {{was still}} serving as Secretary of State, Everett was {{approached}} by Massachusetts Whig leaders <b>about</b> <b>running</b> <b>for</b> the United States Senate. [...] He was elected by the state legislature, and took the office on March 4, 1853. [...] In the Senate {{he sat on the}} Foreign Relations Committee, and on the Committee on Territories. [...] He was opposed to the extension of slavery in the western territories, but was concerned that the radical Free Soil Party's hardline stance would result in disunion.|$|E
500|$|Farmer {{was limited}} to two terms by the Kentucky Constitution, and in October 2009, the Lexington Herald-Leader {{reported}} that he was [...] "in discussions" [...] <b>about</b> <b>running</b> <b>for</b> governor in the 2011 election. In August 2010, Farmer {{announced that he would}} be [...] "running for something" [...] in the upcoming election and would announce his plans within weeks after the Kentucky State Fair. The Lexington Herald-Leader speculated that Farmer could run for governor, secretary of state, or lieutenant governor on a ticket with Senate President David Williams. On September 1, 2010, Williams and Farmer announced that they would run as a ticket for governor and lieutenant governor, respectively.|$|E
50|$|In 2012, Perry gave up {{his state}} house seat {{to run for the}} 4th congressional {{district}}. The district had previously been the 19th District, represented by six-term incumbent Republican Todd Platts, who was giving up the seat to honor a self-imposed term limit. In 2010, when Platts wanted to become the U.S. Comptroller General, he spoke to Perry <b>about</b> his <b>running</b> <b>for</b> the seat.|$|R

500|$|In 1825 Lincoln was {{approached}} by Republican party leaders <b>about</b> <b>running</b> <b>for</b> governor. [...] Adopting a firmly centrist stance, he refused to run as the candidate of a single party. [...] When a Federalist caucus seconded the nomination, he agreed to stand and won the election in a landslide against insignificant opposition. [...] For the next five years, he ran virtually unopposed, only occasionally facing opposition from what were basically single-issue candidates and the weak perennial Democratic candidate Marcus Morton. [...] Historian Ronald Formisano characterizes Lincoln's administration as [...] "basically a National Republican, proto-Whig administration." [...] In 1832, opposition parties began to gain strength, and he won a narrow majority over Democratic and Anti-Masonic opposition.|$|E
500|$|While {{serving in}} the army in early 1862, Garfield was {{approached}} by friends <b>about</b> <b>running</b> <b>for</b> Congress from Ohio's newly redrawn, heavily Republican 19th district. [...] He was worried that he and other state-appointed generals would get obscure assignments, and running for Congress {{would allow him to}} resume his political career. [...] The fact that the new Congress would not hold its first regular session until December 1863 would allow him to continue his war service for a time. Home on medical leave, he refused to campaign for the nomination, leaving that to political managers who secured it at the local convention in September 1862, on the eighth ballot. In October, he defeated D.B. Woods by a two-to-one margin in the general election for a seat in the 38th Congress.|$|E
500|$|Despite Kemp's {{return from}} injury {{and the arrival}} of running back O. J. Simpson, the Bills only {{compiled}} a 4–10 record during the 1969 season under new coach John Rauch. Kemp was named an AFL All-Star in 1969 for the seventh time in the league's 10 years. He advocated recognition of the league, and in its last year, 1969, lobbied Pete Rozelle to have AFL teams wear an AFL patch to honor it. In 1969, the Erie County Republican Party approached him <b>about</b> <b>running</b> <b>for</b> the United States Congress. After the January 17, 1970, AFL All-Star game, Kemp returned home and talked to his wife before deciding to enter politics. Kemp said, [...] "I had a four-year no-cut contract with the Bills at the time. ...I figured that if I lost I could always come back and play. But the fans had their say and I was elected to Congress." ...|$|E

500|$|As {{part of the}} D.A. office, Ferraro {{worked long}} hours, and gained a {{reputation}} for being a tough prosecutor but fair in plea negotiations. Although her unit was supposed to turn over cases [...] which were bound for trial to another division, she took an active role in trying some cases herself, and juries were persuaded by her summations. Ferraro was upset to discover that her superior was paying her less than equivalent male colleagues because she was a married woman and already had a husband. Moreover, Ferraro found the nature of the cases she dealt with debilitating; the work left her [...] "drained and angry" [...] and she developed an ulcer. She grew frustrated that she was unable to deal with root causes, and talked <b>about</b> <b>running</b> <b>for</b> legislative office; Cuomo, now Secretary of State of New York, suggested the United States Congress.|$|E
500|$|During {{a tour of}} the U.S. Senate {{with reporters}} before leaving office, on December 5, 2016, Biden refused to rule out a {{potential}} bid for the Presidency in the 2020 presidential election, after leaving office as Vice President. If he were to run in 2020, Biden would be 77 years old on election day and 78 on inauguration day in 2021. He reasserted his ambivalence about running on an appearance of The Late Show with Stephen Colbert on December 7, in which he stated [...] "never say never" [...] <b>about</b> <b>running</b> <b>for</b> President in 2020, while also admitting he did not see a scenario in which he would run for office again. He seemingly announced on January 13, 2017, exactly one week prior to the expiration of his vice presidential term, that he would not run. However, four days later, on January 17, he seemed to backtrack, stating [...] "I'll run if I can walk." ...|$|E
500|$|Senator Nathaniel Silsbee, whose term {{ended in}} 1835, {{decided not to}} run for reelection. [...] Davis was {{approached}} by Whig leader Daniel Webster <b>about</b> <b>running</b> <b>for</b> the seat in December 1834, as part of a bid to oppose Adams, who had announced his interest in the seat. [...] The idea was that Davis, a strong candidate, would be positioned against Adams (a long-standing rival of Webster who was again running as an Anti-Mason) in the vote, which would be made by the state legislature, while Edward Everett would have the opportunity to run for governor when Davis vacated that seat. [...] The state house and senate deadlocked on the two choices until a speech by Adams in Congress arguing in favor of Jackson's foreign policies alarmed enough senators to change their votes in favor of Davis. [...] The deadlock was not resolved until February 1835; Davis, who had been reelected governor, resigned that post to assume the Senate seat. [...] Everett {{went on to win the}} governor's seat in the next election. (Adams' son Charles Francis believed that Webster and Everett conspired to achieve this end, but there is no evidentiary support for the idea.) [...] Webster, in exchange for his advocacy on behalf of Davis, expected Davis' faction in the Whig Party to support him in a future bid for the presidency.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} effect of social {{learning}} on political outcomes in a model of informative campaign advertising. Voters' communication network affects parties' incentives to disclose political information, voters' learning <b>about</b> candidates <b>running</b> <b>for</b> office, and polarization of the electoral outcome. In richer communication networks, parties disclose less political information and voters {{are more likely to}} possess erroneous beliefs about the characteristics of the candidates. In turn, a richer communication network among voters may lead to political polarization. These results are reinforced when interpersonal communication occurs more frequently among ideologically homogeneous individuals and parties can target political advertising.

5000|$|Speculation that U.S. Senator Susan Collins was {{considering}} <b>running</b> <b>for</b> governor arose during the 2015 Maine Legislative session when Rep.

Moonen denied that he was motivated by Collins possibly running and was only interested in counterbalancing Republican-sponsored bills to change how the Maine Attorney General and Maine Secretary of State are chosen. Moonen stated that he spoke with Collins and she called speculation <b>about</b> her <b>running</b> <b>for</b> governor [...] "silly." [...] Collins, who was the 1994 Republican nominee for governor, told MPBN News on January 4, 2016 that she was [...] "baffled" [...] by the rumors about her being interested in <b>running</b> <b>for</b> governor, and that many have encouraged her to run, but said she would not rule anything in or out.|$|R
