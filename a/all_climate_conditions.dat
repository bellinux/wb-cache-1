Mean grain size, grain size distribution, standard deviation and skewness are the parameters reflecting sedimentation environments and are used to elucidate mechanisms of deposition and determining the provenance of aeolian deposits (Zhu et al., 2014).

The climate parameters used to calculate the climate indices were taken from the NASA-Modern Era Retrospective-Analysis for Research and Applications (NASA-MERRA) reanalysis from 2002 to 2010. Cow milk data were considered for the same period from April to September when the cows use the natural pasture. The study is based on a linear regression analysis using correlations as a summarizing diagnostic. Bootstrapping is used to represent uncertainty information in the confidence intervals. The main results identify an interesting relationship between the milk compounds and climate indices under <b>all</b> <b>climate</b> <b>conditions.</b> During spring, there are reasonably high correlations between the fat and protein concentrations vs. the climate indices, whereas there are insignificant dependencies between the milk yield and climate indices. During summer, the correlation between the fat and protein concentrations with the climate indices decreased in comparison with the spring results, whereas the correlation for the milk yield increased. This methodology is suggested for studies investigating the impacts of climate variability/change on food and agriculture using short term data considering uncertainty...|$|E

Additionally, urban areas are the most impacted zones by anthropogenic sources and they are often affected by local climate phenomena such as urban heat islands. In this view, several measures to mitigate this effects and to save energy in constructions are dealt with the implementation of cool materials for roofs and urban paving. Since the majority of cities in Europe is characterized by traditional architectures in residential buildings, the implementation of white cool coatings is not feasible and new solutions are being proposed.

40|$|Green roofs enjoy a good {{reputation}} concerning comfort in summertime, energy savings, rain water retention and durability. However, applied on moisture sensitive substrates like timber constructions, their high thermal inertia and limited drying potential may lead to failure, especially in case of insufficient design or workmanship. As the conditions below the greenery cannot be evaluated by dew point calculations, only a more detailed simulation allows for a realistic prediction of the hygrothermal performance of the components. This contribution introduces a new hygrothermal green roof model based on field and laboratory tests. In difference to previous models it focuses on the moisture and temperature conditions beneath the greenery using more simple approaches for the plant cover but more detailed approaches for the moisture balance in the drainage and growth media. Therefore material data for moisture storage, vapor diffusion and liquid transport were determined in the laboratory and adapted to the built in situation by the help of additional field tests. The model is validated by the help of measured temperature conditions beneath the green roof test fields, as well as concerning the moisture conditions in the critical layers of sensitive timber roofs!

40|$|The {{importance}} of atmospheric down-welling radiation in studying building thermal environments and energy performance {{has been well}} identified, and empirical formulae to evaluate atmospheric down-welling radiation values developed with their inadequacies. In this paper, a study of developing an alternative general method for evaluating atmospheric down-welling radiation values to the water pond-based empirical formula by Clark and Allen is reported. The validity of the alternative general method has been demonstrated by comparing the atmospheric down-welling radiation values evaluated using the alternative general method and that using the Clark and Allen's formula. Since the alternative general method developed {{is based on a}} building roof system, and no water is involved, the alternative general method developed in this paper appears to have more advantages. On one hand, this could eliminate any potential impacts on prediction accuracy when water is used in different climates. On the other hand, the application of the alternative general method is relatively easier as only a suitable existing roof system is required. Therefore, the use of alternative general method can provide a more reliable and economic alternative in evaluating atmospheric down-welling radiation, when compared to using Clark and Allen's empirical formula.

40|$|The {{energy demand}} for {{operating}} modern office spaces is often driven {{by either the}} annual heating demand, cooling demand or the demand for electrical lighting. The irradiation of the sun directly and indirectly affects the demand of all three. Consequently, the glazing of higher office buildings is often treated with coating that allows a fixed transmittance. Due to changing exterior conditions and interior needs, a fix-transmittance value is a compromise and most often doesn’t provide optimal thermal and visual conditions. The team in the research project named Fluidglass develops a new glazing in which the transmittance of the glazing can   be adjusted. This is possible by colouring a fluid, which is circulated in chambers of the glazing. The concentration of the colorant can be infinitely adjusted. In addition, this window allows collecting heat in the exterior fluid and allows the interior fluid chamber to operate as heating panel. This paper presents a first assessment of different control strategies for adjusting the colorant concentration with a simplified model. The assessed control strategies result in considerably different overall energy demands. Certain control strategies have high potential for reducing the energy demand for heating and cooling depending on the locations (Munich 20 – 30 %, Madrid 50 – 70 %, Dubai 50 – 60 %). However, certain control strategies increase the electricity demand for lighting, which needs {{to be considered in}} the further development. In general, control strategies that only consider the solar irradiation are less promising strategies in temperate climate than strategies that also take the interior temperature into account. The results of controls that also respect the thermal comfort based on a Predicted Mean Vote (PMV) index can achieve low energy demand, presuming that a deviation from the highest level of comfort is acceptable. At this stage of research, none of the studied control strategies shows to be optimal for <b>all</b> <b>climate</b> <b>conditions</b> to achieve highest energy reductions.

H 577 P BSE 2017 Wangxxv, 195 pages :color illustrationsNatural {{disasters}} have {{an increased}} occurrence rate in recent decades, and hence providing disaster victims with a temporary housing {{has always been one}} of the key problems to be addressed in disaster management. Prefabricated houses (PHs) can be very effective in quickly providing disaster victims with a temporary living place whenever there is a natural disaster. Currently, most existing research and development efforts related to indoor thermal environment and comfort mainly focused on providing occupants with a comfortable indoor thermal environment and improving energy use efficiency in conventional permanent buildings. However, temporary PHs are much different from conventional permanent buildings due to their inherent characteristics. Unlike in conventional buildings, environmental control systems are normally not installed inside PHs so that unbearable indoor thermal environment can be often experienced by their occupants. On the other hand, although temporary PHs for disaster relief are intended for temporary purpose, unfortunately, they are increasingly used for a prolonged time period of up to several years. Therefore, it has become highly necessary to study the thermal environment inside temporary PHs used for disaster relief in order to provide their occupants or disaster victims with a more acceptable thermal environment. Consequently, a programmed research work on studying the thermal environment inside PHs used for disaster relief has been carried out and is reported in this thesis. This thesis begins firstly with reporting a study on measuring the actual yearly indoor thermal environments in an experimental PH located in the subtropical Chengdu City, China. The measured results suggested that at closed door and windows condition, the air temperature inside the experimental PH was very high at daytime in summer, but very low at nighttime in winter. Therefore, the actual thermal environment inside the experimental PH was highly unacceptable if it was used on a long-term basis. The variation of the air temperature inside the PH appeared synchronized with that of outdoor air temperature at daytime in summer, suggesting the insignificant thermal mass of its envelope to store solar heat gain. The measured results also indicated an indoor air temperature stratification inside the PH in both winter and summer. At daytime, indoor air temperature was increased with the height but at nighttime, decreased with the height. Besides, at nighttime in both winter and summer, the external surface temperature of PH's roof was lower than the outdoor air temperature, reflecting the sky cooling effects for the experimental PH. Secondly, the thesis presents a numerical study on both the thermal performances of the experimental PH's envelope, and the effectiveness of applying various passive cooling measures to the PH for improving its indoor thermal environment in summer. A numerical model for the experimental PH was firstly developed using Energyplus and validated using the measured results from the experimental PH. Using the validated model, a detailed breakdown of summer heat gain by the PH was then numerically evaluated. The results showed that PH's windows were responsible for the lion's share of the total heat gain, followed by the roof and east wall. Thereafter, the effectiveness of applying four passive cooling measures, individually or in combination, to the PH was numerically studied using the validated model. The study results suggested that adding a thin movable fabric layer of 0. 9 reflectance to the walls and roof of the PH, and applying external window blinds would lead to a very high percentage reduction in unacceptable hours for occupants, without however the need to implement all the four passive measures, so as to save the implementation cost. Thirdly, using the validated model, a further numerical study on various design issues for a disaster relief PH, including orientation, natural ventilation strategies and window to wall ratio (WWR), to achieve an improved indoor thermal environment, is presented. The numerical study results demonstrated that under the climate condition of Chengdu City, the orientation for the PH would have an obvious effect on its indoor thermal environment, with a south-facing orientation being the most favourable for the PH. In addition, in contrast to that in conventional permanent buildings, the use of daytime ventilation was more effective than the use of nighttime ventilation in the PH for improving its indoor thermal environment. Lastly, the study results suggested that there was an optimum value of ~ 20 % for WWR for the PH, at which its indoor thermal environment was the least unacceptable for PH's occupants. Finally, a study on developing an alternative general method (AGM) which is valid for <b>all</b> <b>climate</b> <b>conditions</b> and easy to be implemented, to evaluate the atmospheric downwelling radiation (ADR) values is reported. The AGM was developed based on the heat exchange of long wave radiation between a horizontal upward facing surface and the sky. Using the AGM developed, the ADR values in Chengdu, China, were evaluated based {{on the roof of the}} experimental PH, and its validity was demonstrated by comparing the ADR values evaluated using the AGM developed and that using the widely used Clark and Allen's formula, which is based on a water pond. Since the AGM developed was based on a roof surface, and no water was involved, the AGM developed appeared more advantageous. On one hand, this could eliminate any potential influence on evaluation accuracy when water was used in different climates. On the other hand, the application of the AGM was relatively easier as only a suitable existing roof system was required. Therefore, the use of AGM can provide a more reliable and low-cost alternative to evaluate ADR values, when compared to using Clark and Allen's empirical formula.

In {{this thesis}} work, the {{electronic control system}} design and design method of a refrigerator that is supplied from PV panel have been studied. The designed system includes PV panel, accumulator and a compressor with a high efficiency BLDC (brushless DC) motor. For the system, motor has an input power of 100 W and the controlled speed range is 2200 – 3600 min- 1. Open-circuit voltage range for the PV panel is 15 – 50 V and design is suitable for both 12 V and 24 V accumulators. For such an application, {{it is necessary to}} use PV panel at the voltage and current that gives maximum power. Using MPPT algorithms, energy supplied from PV panel is transferred to the accumulator with maximum energy efficiency. Having high efficiency and being suitable for using in variable speed applications, BLDC motor was preferred at this study. A compressor {{is a part of the}} cooling system (compressor, evaporator, condenser etc.) and it is driven with the BLDC motor. This cooling system ensures the inside temperature of the refrigerator cabin as low as desired. A boost DC/DC converter that is supplied from the accumulator is used for adjusting the DC bus voltage at the input of 3 -phase motor inverter. The speed of the BLDC motor is controlled by adjusting the DC bus voltage. On the other hand, three phase motor inverter is used for energizing the motor phases at the right instances according to the rotor position information coming from sensorless position detection circuit. As a result, BLDC motor is controlled with six-step trapezoidal control method. Below are the criteria for the MPPT charger circuit design: • Flexibility in using(being compatible with various kind of accumulators and PV panels), • Successful MPPT operation during the whole day and <b>all</b> <b>climate</b> <b>conditions,</b> • Low electromagnetic radiation and low electrical noise, • Cost-effectiveness (single switch topologies were considered) Input impedance of buck-boost type DC/DC converters can be adjusted in range [0,&# 8734;) in continuous conduction mode. Consequently, regardless of the ratio between input voltage and output voltage of the converter, a successful MPPT operation can be done and converter can run the PV panel from open-circuit point to short-circuit point. Therefore, buck-boost type DC/DC converter topologies were considered for MPPT charger circuit. Classical buck-boost converter and Zeta converter has a controlled switch at the input side. Thus these converters have high input current ripple, harmonic and differential mode electromagnetic noise. On the other hand, &# 262;uk and SEPIC topologies are better in harmonic and noise performance because of the input inductor. In battery supplied systems, peak value of the battery charge current is crucial because high ripple current affects battery life and parasitic losses. Because of the output inductor, ripple of the battery charging current for &# 262;uk converter is low, whereas SEPIC converter has a discontinuous and high ripple output current because of the diode at the output. As a result, &# 262;uk converter is the best alternative among other single switch topologies for MPPT charger circuit. With the &# 262;uk MPPT charger an efficiency of 92, 04 % has been obtained. MPPT algorithms are used for obtaining maximum power from the panel that is available. At this thesis work, open circuit voltage method, perturb&observe method and incremental conductance method have been studied. There are various other MPPT algorithms in the literature. Open circuit (OC) voltage method adjusts panel voltage to a k multiple of open circuit voltage. But this method is satisfactory only certain conditions because maximum power point voltage depends on irradiance and ambient temperature. On the other hand, OC voltage method is a useful method to approach maximum power point rapidly after power-on. Perturb and observe (PO) algorithm is the method that the PV panel voltage or current is increased and decreased, the PV power is calculated at each time and the direction of change is reversed when the PV power decreases. As a result, PO algorithm is an algorithm of trial and error that the PV power works and oscillates around maximum power point. According to the incremental conductance algorithm maximum power point for the PV panel is located when the instantaneous conductance is equal to the negative value of incremental conductance. When instantaneous conductance is greater than negative of the incremental conductance, this means operating point is at the left of the MPPT point. Then, algorithm will decrease PV voltage. When instantaneous conductance is smaller than negative of the incremental conductance, this means operating point is at the right of the MPPT point. Then, algorithm will increase PV voltage. Incremental conductance algorithm is successful in rapidly varying irradiance conditions. However, it is not immune to noise, then noise reduction will be important in the implementation of this algorithm. At this thesis work, two implementations of MPPT algorithms have been done and MPPT efficiencies have been measured. MPPT efficiency is the ratio of generated PV output power to available PV power under test irradiance and temperature conditions. During MPPT tests, Chroma 62150 H 400 S DC power supply, which has solar panel simulation property, has been used. A model of Kyocera KC 85 T PV panel has been done and two parallel KC 85 T panel model has been used in MPPT efficiency tests. At the first implementation, OC method is used after first power-on and approach to maximum power point rapidly. Then, PO algorithm starts to work and find the MPPT point. At this first hybrid MPPT method an MPPT efficiency of 99 % has been obtained under constant 600 W/m 2 irradiance. At the second MPPT test, from 600 W/m 2 to 300 W/m 2 and from 300 W/m 2 to 600 W/m 2 a rapidly varying irradiance at each 5 second has been implemented. At this test, an MPPT efficiency of 96, 2 % has been obtained. At the second implementation, OC method is used after first power-on and approach to maximum power point rapidly. Then, IC algorithm starts to work and find the MPPT point. At this hybrid MPPT method an MPPT efficiency of 98, 5 % has been obtained under constant 600 W/m 2 irradiance. At the second MPPT test, from 600 W/m 2 to 300 W/m 2 and from 300 W/m 2 to 600 W/m 2 a rapidly varying irradiance at each 5 sec has been implemented. At this test, an MPPT efficiency of 96. 6 % has been obtained. A boost DC/DC converter is used for boosting 12 / 24 V accumulator voltage to 35 - 50 V. Peak current mode control has been used for the control of boost converter. An efficiency of 91. 41 % has been obtained for this boost converter with 100 W maximum output power. BLDC motors have generally three phase winding in the stator and they have permanent magnet in the rotor. Back-EMF voltages induced in phase windings are trapezoidal for BLDC motors. Brushed DC motors need frequent maintenance due to the arcs caused by brush-commutator structure and mechanical frictions. On the other hand, for BLDC motors commutation action is done electronically instead of mechanical brush-commutator action. Thus, BLDC motors do not require maintenance and do not have risk of arcs. Moreover, compressor contains oil for the protection of mechanical parts of the compressor; arcs that result from mechanical friction of brushes can ignite or cause fire. Therefore, BLDC motor was preferred for this thesis work. When two of the three phases of BLDC motors are energized consecutively, this motor model does not have a difference with simple brushed DC motor. To obtain maximum torque from BLDC motor and to drive efficiently each phase should be energized at the 120 electrical degrees part where the EMF is maximum. In a BLDC inverter there are six semiconductor switches that enable electronic commutation. In six step trapezoidal drive method there are six combinations for two of three motor phase winding energizing. At every 60 degrees two of three phases are energized and there will be a sequence of energizing according to the rotor position. If this action is done in the right sequence, motor runs at desired speed and torque. Speed control of the motor is done via adjusting the input DC bus voltage of the three phase inverter with a boost DC/DC converter, thus there is no need to a high frequency PWM operation in motor inverter. As a result, at the motor inverter, switching frequency of semiconductor switches is equal to the motor electrical commutation frequency. Therefore, switching losses of motor inverter transistors and parallel diode reverse recovery losses are very low. There is a relationship between motor EMF voltage and rotor’s mechanical position. Rotor position information is critical for six step trapezoidal drive. Thus, there are sensored and sensorless position detection methods for BLDC motors. There are various position detection sensors such as Hall effect sensors, optical sensors etc. that generate three sensor signals at the same phase and frequency of back EMF voltage. According to information coming from these sensors, motor inverter switches energize the motor windings. In sensorless position detection methods, by sensing the back EMF voltage on motor terminals, it is possible to detect rotor position without sensors. Generally, there are two kinds of sensorless position detection methods. At the first method, zero crossing points of the back EMF voltages are detected and delayed digitally. As the commutation point has a phase difference of 30 degrees with respect to zero crossing point, commutation signals can be determined with digital delay. At the second type of sensorless methods, phase voltages are filtered first and delayed after filtering. Delaying and/or filtering is done in such a manner that the result exactly gives the commutation point when they are compared to each other or compared with the neutral point. The sensorless position detection method used in this thesis work is belonging to the second group. In this method, delay time is adjusted according to the rotating speed and motor phase voltages are compared to each other. As a result, method gives three position signals that have the same electrical frequency with the back EMF voltage. Square wave position detection signals have a phase difference of 120 degrees to each other and they have 180 degrees on time. Magnitude of back EMF voltage has a linear relationship with the motor speed. Thus, at low speeds motor back EMF voltages are small and not enough to give correct commutation instant. Sensorless motor control methods are not able to detect motor position at low speeds. Then, sensorless position detection algorithms work as follows: firstly, rotor is aligned to a known position. Secondly, during free run interval, motor phases are energized according to six step trapezoidal drive for predetermined time intervals in an open loop manner. After this open loop interval, closed loop sensorless position detection algorithm starts to work and all commutation is done according to the position signals coming from sensorless position detection circuit. As a result, BLDC motor control has three steps: align, free run, closed loop operation. With the stated sensorless position detection and motor control method, motor speed control and drive has been done and motor speed has been regulated to desired reference between 2200 - 3600 min- 1 speed interval.

The intensity of a storm is quantified by the associated estimated loss derived with using an empirical model. The geographical focus is ‘Core Europe’, which comprises countries of Western Europe. Possible changes of losses are analysed by comparing ECHAM 5 GCM data for recent (20 C, 1960 to 2000) and future <b>climate</b> <b>conditions</b> (B 1, A 1 B, A 2; 2060 to 2100), each with 3 ensemble members. Changes are quantified using both rank statistics and return periods (RP) estimated by fitting an extreme value distribution using the peak over threshold method to potential storm losses. The estimated losses for ECHAM 5 20 C and reanalysis events show similar statistical features in terms of return periods. Under future <b>climate</b> <b>conditions,</b> <b>all</b> <b>climate</b> scenarios show an increase in both frequency and magnitude of potential losses caused by windstorms for Core Europe. Future losses that are double the highest ECHAM 5 20 C loss are identified for some countries. While positive changes of ranking are significant for many countries and multiple scenarios, significantly shorter RPs are mostly found under the A 2 scenario for return levels correspondent to 20 yr losses or less. The emergence time of the statistically significant changes in loss varies from 2027 to 2100. These results imply {{an increased risk of}} occurrence of windstorm-associated losses, which can be largely attributed to {{changes in the}} meteorological severity of the events. Additionally, factors such as changes in the cyclone paths and in the location of the wind signatures relative to highly populated areas are also important to explain the changes in estimated losses...|$|R

As a factor of the damages, <b>climate</b> <b>conditions</b> and physiographic factors have an effect on damages. In concrete construction, we should consider a <b>climate</b> <b>conditions</b> to build the concrete structure that gave an appropriate response. Therefore, we should build concrete structures that enable minor maintenance in the future. In general, designer and constructor should share to build concrete structure that was done measure construction about <b>climate</b> <b>conditions</b> in Japan. However, large-scale civil engineering project are dividing by specialization, measures of share are not enough among designer and constructor. Therefore, designer and constructor need the tool that enable to realize <b>climate</b> <b>condition</b> in Japan. In this paper, we used Geographic Information Systems (GIS) that enable to integrate different types of data on the map to create climate map. Then, we show these maps to the public by cloud GIS among designer and constructor currently. Finally, we developed support application that support to understand <b>climate</b> <b>condition</b> to share by cloud GIS for designer and constructor in Japan. Designer and constructor enable to build concrete structure that was done consistent measures by our application...|$|R
40|$|The {{soil and}} <b>climate</b> <b>conditions</b> in Romania are {{favorable}} for the sunflower crops. The sunflower {{is one of}} the main large culture crops in Romania and the most important oilseed plant, being on the third place as cultivated area, after corn and wheat. This makes the sunflower the most important melliferous crop plant, ensuring the last great production harvest before winter. This importance results both from the period and the duration of flowering, and from the large number of flowers per unit of area and the great nectar secretion. Yet, the melliferous capacity in sunflower is affected by the <b>climate</b> <b>conditions</b> [3], fact ascertained by beekeepers over great variations in time and space of honey productions. Likewise, the melliferous capacity in sunflower differs from one hybrid to another [1][2], the beekeepers being interested in the melliferous capacities specific to various sunflower hybrids cultivated in our country. The current work depicts the results of researches on the melliferous capacity on a variety of 4 sunflower hybrids cultivated over 5 periods, under the conditions of the southern part of Romania, (15 km North-East from Bucharest) and under the <b>climate</b> <b>conditions</b> of 2007. The studied sunflower hybrids were: Fleoret OR, Melodi, Sunko and Arena. By the cultivation over different periods it was intended that the flowering period to overlap periods with different <b>climate</b> <b>conditions,</b> so to determine the melliferous potential in the hybrids studied in different <b>climate</b> <b>conditions</b> and to note the way in which the vary according to the <b>climate</b> <b>conditions...</b>|$|R
