5|$|An {{intelligence}} official told Seymour Hersh in 2015 that no fire-fight took place.

A short firefight took place between al-Kuwaiti and the SEALs, in which al-Kuwaiti was killed. His wife Mariam was allegedly shot and wounded in the right shoulder. The courier's male relative Abrar was then said to have been shot <b>and</b> <b>killed</b> <b>by</b> the SEALs' second team {{on the first floor of}} the main house as shots had already been fired and the SEALs thought that he was armed with a loaded AK-47 (this was later confirmed to be true in the official report).

Bin Laden's young adult son {{is said to have}} encountered the SEALs on the staircase of the main house, and to have been shot <b>and</b> <b>killed</b> <b>by</b> the second team. An unnamed U.S. senior defense official stated that only one of the five people killed, Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti, was armed. The interior of the house was pitch dark, because CIA operatives had cut the power to the neighborhood. However, the SEALs wore night vision goggles.|$|E
