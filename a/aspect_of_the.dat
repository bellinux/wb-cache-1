40|$|People {{generally}} {{say they}} prefer {{to have the opportunity}} to revise decisions at a later point in time. Research has shown, however, that reversible decision-making leads to lower as opposed to higher levels of post-choice satisfaction (Gilbert & Ebert, 2002). In three studies we aimed to gain insight into the underlying processes driving this counterintuitive finding. Our results show that irreversible decision-making increases <b>the</b> accessibility <b>of</b> <b>the</b> positive <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chosen and <b>the</b> negative <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rejected alternatives. Hence, in line with what would be expected on <b>the</b> basis <b>of</b> cognitive dissonance theory, irreversible decision-making results in a focus on <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> decision that optimize choice satisfaction. After reversible decision-making, however, <b>the</b> negative <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chosen and <b>the</b> positive <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rejected alternatives tend to become relatively more accessible. Apparently, reversible decisions automatically direct people's attention to those <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> decision that potentially decrease satisfaction with the chosen alternative...|$|R
