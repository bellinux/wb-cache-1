5|$|After the war, Bockscar {{returned}} to the United States in November 1945. In September 1946 {{it was given to}} the National Museum of the United States Air Force at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio. The aircraft was flown to the Museum on 26 September 1961, and its original markings were restored (noseart was added after the mission). Bockscar is now on permanent display at the National Museum of the United States Air Force, Dayton, Ohio, next to a replica of <b>a</b> <b>Fat</b> Man.|$|E
5|$|Bockscar {{was used}} in 13 {{training}} and practice missions from Tinian, and three combat missions in which it dropped pumpkin bombs on industrial targets in Japan. On 9 August 1945, Bockscar, piloted by the 393d Bombardment Squadron's commander, Major Charles W. Sweeney, dropped <b>a</b> <b>Fat</b> Man nuclear bomb with a blast yield equivalent to 21 kilotons of TNT over the city of Nagasaki. About 44% {{of the city was}} destroyed; 35,000 people were killed and 60,000 injured.|$|E

40|$|Kidney {{failure is}} {{frequently}} {{associated with the}} risk factors linked to metabolic syndrome. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a potent inflammatory molecule, which has increased absorption from the gut into blood circulation following <b>a</b> high <b>fat</b> and high-energy diet. We hypothesized that LPS from <b>a</b> high <b>fat</b> diet can amplify inflammation, thereby exacerbating chronic kidney disease and associated disorders. We have found that adding <b>a</b> high <b>fat</b> diet to renal insufficient mice significantly progressed their kidney disease as well as associated disorders, compared to both <b>a</b> high <b>fat</b> diet and renal insufficiency alone. Additionally, {{we were able to}} demonstrate in vitro that the combination of LPS and palmitic acid, a marker of high fat diet, induced inflammatory pathways significantly more than either LPS or palmitic acid alone. These results provide insight into connection between <b>a</b> high <b>fat</b> diet and the progression of chronic kidney disease as well as associated disorders...|$|R
5|$|Contrary {{to popular}} belief, great white sharks do not mistake humans for seals. Many bite {{incidents}} occur in waters with low visibility or other situations which impair the shark's senses. The species appears to {{not like the}} taste of humans, or at least finds the taste unfamiliar. Further research shows that they can tell in one bite {{whether or not the}} object is worth predating upon. Humans, for the most part, are too bony for their liking. They much prefer <b>a</b> <b>fat,</b> protein-rich seal.|$|E
5|$|Everyone is {{in disbelief}} that Stewie {{would try to}} murder Lois, but she insists that he is evil, and {{explains}} what happened. After falling overboard, she was rescued by a merman. Having developed retrograde amnesia, she starts working at <b>a</b> <b>fat</b> camp in North Carolina. While in a diner, she meets a new boyfriend, who {{turns out to be}} a white supremacist. While at a white supremacist rally, she takes a blow to the head and regains her memory, at which point she returns to Quahog.|$|E
5|$|Internationally {{viewed as}} a sex symbol, he was named one of People magazine's 100 Most Beautiful People in 2006. The {{following}} year, Eckhart was {{invited to join the}} Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. He starred in No Reservations (2007), a remake of the 2001 German romantic comedy Mostly Martha. He starred opposite Catherine Zeta-Jones as an up-and-coming hotshot chef. The film was met with mixed reviews and was unfavorably compared to the original film. Eckhart starred in the 2008 comedy Meet Bill, in which he played the eponymous character, a sad executive working at his father-in-law's bank. He gained 30pounds and donned <b>a</b> <b>fat</b> suit for the role.|$|E

5|$|It was {{reported}} by Entertainment Weekly that Pitt would don <b>a</b> <b>fat</b> suit for flashback scenes to his fat childhood, though this was unfounded as Will's weight was merely referred to on screen. Pitt frequently visited Aniston at the studios before and after his appearance, {{though he did not}} go onto the set for fear of distracting the audience. When questioned about his appearance in the show, Pitt said it was to promote his upcoming film Spy Game, though added that he liked the series anyway. The episode was taped on November 2, following four days of rehearsals.|$|E
5|$|January Jones became {{pregnant}} {{in between the}} fourth and fifth season of the series. Instead of writing in a pregnancy for the Betty Francis character, the writers opted to write in a weight gain. January Jones wore <b>a</b> <b>fat</b> suit during the filming of this episode, the same technique used by Elizabeth Moss during the first season when her character encountered a similar weight gain (though in that instance, the character was actually pregnant). Make-up tricks and clever camera angles were also used to create the dramatic impression of Betty's weight gain. A body double was used for the scene in which Betty rises from the bathtub.|$|E
5|$|Parsons {{became the}} head of Project Alberta, with Ramsey as his {{scientific}} and technical deputy, and Ashworth as his operations officer and military alternate. There were two bomb assembly teams, <b>a</b> <b>Fat</b> Man Assembly Team under Commander Norris Bradbury and Roger Warner, and a Little Boy Assembly under Birch. Philip Morrison was {{the head of}} the Pit Crew, Bernard Waldman and Luis Alvarez led the Aerial Observation Team, and Sheldon Dike was in charge of the Aircraft Ordnance Team. Physicists Robert Serber and William Penney, and US Army Captain James F. Nolan, a medical expert, were special consultants. All members of Project Alberta had volunteered for the mission.|$|E

40|$|There is {{a strong}} {{relation}} between diet and risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. Generally <b>a</b> high <b>fat</b> consumption will increase the serum cholesterol level. Different fatty acids have different effects on total cholesterol, LDL and HDL lipoproteins and therefore on the risk for cardiovascular diseases. This knowledge was translated into guidelines for a healthy diet and in advices to use less fat. In reality {{it was not easy}} for physicians to reach a substantial reduction in total cholesterol by limiting the <b>fat</b> consumption. <b>A</b> recent investigation in Belgium showed that the median reduction obtained by dietary changes through general practitioners was only 3. 5 %. In medical education not much attention is paid to the communication of the "fat message". In addition, individual patients have frequently multiple risk factors e. g. abdominal obesity, insulin resistance, diabetes, hypertension and a sedentary lifestyle. Therefore in the clinical setting an integrated approach is needed, in which dietary advice is supported by behavioural therapy and suggestions to increase physical activity. Currently there is a debate on the preference of <b>a</b> low <b>fat</b> or <b>a</b> modified <b>fat</b> diet. <b>A</b> low <b>fat</b> diet is rich in carbohydrates and <b>a</b> modified <b>fat</b> diet is rich in mono-unsaturated fatty acids. Recent investigations in diabetic patients are in favour of <b>a</b> modified <b>fat</b> diet. This has the advantage that in practice the possibilities for realizing <b>a</b> low saturated <b>fat</b> diet are increased. status: publishe...|$|R
5|$|Purnell, Parsons, Tibbets, Spaatz and Curtis LeMay met on Guam on 7 August, the {{day after}} the Hiroshima attack, to discuss what should be done next. Parsons said that Project Alberta would have <b>a</b> <b>Fat</b> Man bomb ready by 11 August, as {{originally}} planned, but Tibbets pointed to weather reports indicating poor flying conditions on that day due to a storm, and asked if it could be readied by 9 August. Parsons agreed to do so.|$|E
5|$|The P2Vs {{would be}} first augmented, and then replaced, {{by the more}} capable North American AJ Savage as they became available. These could take off and land on a carrier, {{carrying}} <b>a</b> <b>Fat</b> Man. On 21 August 1950, Hayward was at the controls of the first carrier landing and takeoff of an AJ-1 Savage heavy attack bomber, on the Coral Sea with the Commander of Naval Air Forces Atlantic Fleet (COMAIRLANT), Vice Admiral Felix Stump, in the back seat. However, by mid-December VC-5 still only had six AJ-1s.|$|E
5|$|After World War II, the US Navy {{sought to}} acquire a nuclear strike capability, and the Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for Air, Rear Admiral Arthur W. Radford wanted them to operate from {{aircraft}} carriers. There were practical problems with this. Nuclear weapons at that time were bulky and required a large aircraft to carry them. After Operation Crossroads, Radford asked Hayward if the Navy had such an aircraft, and Hayward suggested modifying the Lockheed P2V Neptune for carrier operations using jet-assisted takeoff (JATO) rocket boosters. It was an interim solution, as it a could not carry <b>a</b> <b>Fat</b> Man, but only the smaller Little Boy bomb; {{it could only be}} operated by the large Midway class aircraft carriers, which still had to be modified for the task; and initially had no tailhook, so it was unable to land on a carrier, and a mission would have to end with it either landing at a land base or ditching at sea.|$|E

5|$|Assembly of <b>a</b> <b>Fat</b> Man {{unit was}} a complex {{operation}} involving personnel from the HE-ME, Pit, Fusing and Firing teams. To prevent the assembly building from becoming overcrowded and thereby causing an accident, Parsons limited the numbers allowed inside at any time. Personnel waiting {{to perform a}} specific task had to wait their turn outside the building. The first Fat Man assembly, known as F13, was assembled by 31 July, and expended in a drop test the next day. This was followed by F18 on 4 August, which was dropped the next day. Three sets of Fat Man high explosive pre-assemblies, designated F31, F32, and F33, arrived on a B-29 of the 509th Composite Group and 216th Army Air Forces Base Unit on 2 August. On inspection, the high explosive blocks of F32 {{were found to be}} badly cracked and unserviceable. The other two were assembled, with F33 earmarked for a rehearsal and F31 for operational use.|$|E
5|$|Purnell, Parsons, Paul Tibbets, Spaatz and Curtis LeMay met on Guam on 7 August, the {{day after}} the Hiroshima attack, to discuss what should be done next.

Parsons agreed to do so. For this mission, Ashworth was the weaponeer, with Lieutenant Philip M. Barnes, of the 1st Ordnance Squadron as assistant weaponeer on the B-29 Bockscar. Walter Goodman and Lawrence H. Johnston were on board the instrumentation aircraft, The Great Artiste. Leonard Cheshire and William Penney were on the observation plane Big Stink. Robert Serber was supposed to be on board but was left behind by the aircraft commander because he had forgotten his parachute.|$|E
5|$|The 38th Engineer Battalion's {{electrical}} group {{studied the}} batteries, the electrical firing {{systems and the}} radar fuzes which detonated the bomb at the required altitude. The mechanical group dealt with the exploding-bridgewire detonators and the explosive lenses. The nuclear group moved to Los Alamos to study the cores and initiators. As part of their training, they attended lectures by Edward Teller, Hans Bethe, Lise Meitner and Enrico Fermi. The electrical and mechanical groups at Sandia, although not the nuclear group, completed their training {{around the end of}} October 1946 and spent the next month devising the best methods of assembling <b>a</b> <b>Fat</b> Man, drawing up detailed checklists so that later bomb assembly teams could be trained. They also drew up a proposed table of organization and equipment for an assembly team. It took two weeks for them to assemble their first bomb in December 1946.|$|E
