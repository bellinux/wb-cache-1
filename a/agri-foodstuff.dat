The study {{investigates the}} <b>agri-foodstuffs</b> market, {{highlighting}} the {{developments of the}} last decades that have seen the large-scale retail trade to exert an action more and more invasive in the distribution value along the line characterizing the production chain. We focused on the Province of Reggio Calabria, its scenario of metropolitan city and the <b>agri-foodstuffs</b> chains that configure it as an important area for quality and quantity produced. Finally, it was proposed to overcome the narrow view of wholesale trade, with the hypothesis of a major agricultural hub serving the primary production in the Province of Reggio Calabria and its future metropolitan city, a route outlined by this work in order to revive a field {{that has always been}} strategic for the development and dynamics of the local market. 1. Changes and transformations in the <b>agri-foodstuffs</b> market. The analysis of value formation processes in the different steps of the sequence characterizing a production chain is extremely important, because on this one depends both the economic advantage lying at the basis of production and the economic benefit of the consumer to get in a supply of the product itself. The two ends of the chain are the balance in determining the price, although not the main component. In fact, in the production of value, the intermediate steps, characterized b...|$|R

40|$|International audienceNowadays, {{multiple}} constraints {{imposed by}} economical, {{social and environmental}} considerations undergo maintenance planning optimization into a major challenge to designers, owners and users of infrastructure. This study presents a simplified methodology to evaluate the sustainability of maintenance strategies used in reinforced concrete structures exposed to chlorides. The proposed approach is illustrated throughout the paper with an application to large-scale maintenance of a real structure (<b>Agri-foodstuffs</b> terminal wharf). The repair strategy consists of demolition of the polluted concrete and rebuilding of cover by using three techniques (wet shotcrete, dry shotcrete and formed concrete). The repair times are estimated by taking the randomness of chloride ingress into account. Three criteria are {{used to evaluate the}} sustainability of the repair techniques: present value life-cost, waste production and CO 2 emissions. Based on this multi-criteria comparison, a simplified decision-making scheme based on a multi-objective index is proposed...|$|R
