It captures the activity of a local system (e.g., a single neuron or neural ensemble) by its circular phase alone and hence ignores the <b>amplitude</b> <b>of</b> <b>oscillations</b> (amplitude is constant).

The Kuramoto model is widely used to study oscillatory brain activity and several extensions have been proposed that increase its neurobiological plausibility, for instance by incorporating topological properties of local cortical connectivity. In particular, it describes how the activity of a group of interacting neurons can become synchronized and generate large-scale oscillations. Simulations using the Kuramoto model with realistic long-range cortical connectivity and time-delayed interactions reveal the emergence of slow patterned fluctuations that reproduce resting-state BOLD functional maps, which can be measured using fMRI.|$|E

40|$|The given work to {{some extent}} meets the {{shortage}} of experimental investigations directed {{to the study of}} the behavior of buildings with dynamic oscillation dampers. Investigations were carried out by means of vibration testing on a large-scale model of a 9 -story frame building. The purpose was revealing the effectiveness and damping properties of two-mass damper and comparing them with the effectiveness of single-mass damper. Before construction of such a damper in a form of an additional tenth floor, the dynamic characteristics of the model (periods and damping factors) were determined and their values are given in the paper. It was revealed that the maximum <b>amplitude</b> <b>of</b> <b>oscillations</b> on the top level of model (the slab of the 9 th floor) with the main damper is almost 3 times less than the <b>amplitude</b> <b>of</b> <b>oscillations</b> on the top level of the model without damper. The <b>amplitude</b> <b>of</b> <b>oscillations</b> of the main damper was about 3 - 4 times bigger than the <b>amplitude</b> <b>of</b> <b>oscillations</b> on the top level of model. A damping factor of the main damper determined by the record of free oscillations was equal to = 0. 7 %. Then the damper was transformed from the single-mass to the two-mass damper by suspending the second mass to the slab of the main damper The obtained results show the high effectiveness of the two-mass damper as its damping degree reaches to about 4. 4, that is 46. 7 % bigger than that of one-mass damper. If before suspending the second mass to the single-mass damper its maximal amplitude was about 3. 5 cm, then after it the amplitude became equal to 1. 4 cm. The experimental investigations confirm the quite high effectiveness of the dynamic oscillation dampers and incontrovertible expediency of their application for increasing of earthquake resistance of buildings and structures...|$|E
40|$|Mobilisation of {{the spine}} is a common {{technique}} used in clinical practice. Studies have shown that mobilisation to the spine can decrease pain. The optimum treatment dose for achieving this has not so far been investigated. Previous studies that demonstrate the pain relieving effects of mobilisations have used large <b>amplitude</b> <b>of</b> <b>oscillations.</b> The importance of amplitude on pain relief has not been established. The current study aims to: a) Investigate the importance of amplitude {{as part of the}} treatment dose. b) To explore the extent of any pain reliving effects seen following mobilisations. The study employed a randomised, single blind, within-subjects repeated measure design. Thirty asymptomatic subjects participated. The subjects completed three experimental conditions on three separate occasions. The conditions were: large <b>amplitude</b> <b>of</b> <b>oscillations</b> (forces between 50 and 200 N), small <b>amplitude</b> <b>of</b> <b>oscillations</b> (150 N– 200 N) and quasi-static (maintained at 200 N).

Pressure pain thresholds (PPT) were measured immediately before and after each intervention at 4 different sites. The sites were chosen {{to determine the extent of}} the hypoalgesic response. Results demonstrated a significant increase in PPT following lumbar mobilisations (p = 0. 013) at all measured sites. However, no significant difference was found between amplitude conditions (p = 0. 864). This study suggests that in asymptomatic subjects a systemic hypoalgesic response is caused by lumbar mobilisation regardless of amplitude. ...|$|E
