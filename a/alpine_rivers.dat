And observe how sternly, how constantly the place where they are to be governed is marked by the mischief done by their liberty.

40|$|Freshwater {{ecosystems}} are often of high conservation value, yet {{many have been}} degraded significantly by direct anthropogenic impacts and are further threatened by global environmental change. Traditionally, conservation science and policy has promoted principles based on preservation and restoration paradigms, which are linked to assumptions of stationarity and uniformitarianism. Adaptation requires new approaches based on flexibili- ty, iterativity, non-linearity, and redundancy. Many high <b>alpine</b> <b>river</b> networks represent near natural, pristine river systems and important biodiversity ‘hotspots’ of European freshwater fauna. However, there remains a lack of guidance on <b>alpine</b> <b>river</b> conservation strategies under a changing climate at EU, regional and local levels. A critical evaluation of current conservation and adaptation principles and governance frameworks was undertak- en with relation to predicted climate change impacts on freshwater ecosystems. Case studies are presented from two alpine zones in mainland Europe (the Pyre´ne´es and the Swiss Alps). The complexity of climate change impacts on hydrological regimes, habitat and biota from both case study regions suggests that current legislative and policy mechanisms, which frame conservation approaches, need to be realigned. In particular, a shift in focus from species-centric approaches to more holistic ecosystem functioning conservation is proposed. A methodological approach is set out that may help conservationists and resource managers to both prioritise their efforts, and better predict future habitat and biotic responses to set ecological baseline conditions. Due to the complexity and limited potential for preventative intervention in these systems, conservation strategies should focus on: (i) the maintenance and enhancement of connectivity within and between <b>alpine</b> <b>river</b> basins and (ii) the control and reduction of additional anthropogenic stressors...|$|R

40|$|Climate change disproportionately threatens <b>alpine</b> <b>river</b> {{ecosystems}} due to {{the strong}} connections between cryosphere, hydrology and physicochemical habitat. Our general understanding of how these systems will respond to warming is, however, based on conceptual models derived from studies undertaken at relatively small spatial scales. This research utilizes: (i) field data collected from five glacierized river basins in the French Pyrénées; (ii) field based experimentation; and (iii) climate/hydrological modelling, to improve understanding of <b>alpine</b> <b>river</b> ecosystem change. Despite a linear, harsh-begin, physicochemical habitat gradient running from high to low meltwater (snow and ice) contribution, observed benthic macroinvertebrate community level metrics were unimodal (i. e. mid-meltwater peak). Community assembly processes shifted from niche filtering/stochastic (trait convergence) at high meltwater sites, to limiting similarity/stochastic (trait divergence) at low meltwater sites. Benthic macroinvertebrate community structure, feeding interactions and body size spectra were altered when invertebrate predator range expansion was experimentally simulated. Empirical observation (space for time substitution) and statistical modelling both suggest an increase in reach scale diversity (alpha) is likely as glacier cover is lost. However, a reduction in habitat heterogeneity is {{likely to lead to}} biotic homogenization (reduced beta diversity) as a specialist high meltwater community is replaced by a more generalist community.

40|$|Impacts of {{anthropogenic}} flow regulation on the thermal regimes of <b>alpine</b> <b>river</b> systems are poorly understood. This is surprising {{given the importance}} of water temperature for river ecosystems and the widespread regulation of mountain rivers across the world. This study examined water temperature dynamics year-round between July 2008 and September 2009 in the Eisboden river system, central Austrian Alps. Water temperature data were examined alongside hydroclimatological data to infer the key processes driving thermal variability from diurnal to inter-annual scales. As expected, interactions between meteorology and water source controlled year-round thermal heterogeneity. However, water entering the proglacial river from a hydropower storage reservoir caused significant increases in water temperature during both late summer and early winter, resulting in a marked longitudinal thermal discontinuity. The timing and duration of flows discharged from reservoirs, and thus effects on river thermal regimes, differed considerably from previous studies of subalpine hydropeaking. Furthermore, thermal responses to flow regulation extended laterally to some groundwater tributaries even where there was no upstream surface connectivity, suggesting significant hyporheic flow or conduction of heat through coarse alluvium. River water temperature continued to be altered even after reservoir releases had ceased due to the removal of winter snow cover and recharged groundwater sources. Together, these insights into the thermal variability have broad implications for conservation and management of <b>alpine</b> <b>river</b> systems because water temperature is a key variable influencing aquatic ecosystems, and because anthropogenic pressures on alpine environments are expected to grow in the future...|$|R

40|$|In <b>alpine</b> <b>river</b> networks, {{water source}} (i. e. snow, ice or groundwater) {{plays a major}} role in {{influencing}} flow regimes, benthic habitat and macroinvertebrate community structure. Across these systems a natural stress gradient can be conceptualised, from rivers fed exclusively by meltwater (harsh habitat) to those with no melt input (relatively benign, groundwater-fed). However, despite the current context of rapid glacier retreat, our understanding of linkages between meltwater contributions, physicochemical habitat and biodiversity remains limited. To address this research gap, habitat characteristics and macroinvertebrate community structure were studied at 26 sites (five river basins) in the French Pyrénées across a meltwater gradient from 0 to 99 %. A combination of generalised regression models and multivariate analyses showed that the stress gradient was associated with: (i) linear responses of key physicochemical habitat variables, in particular bed stability; (ii) unimodal responses at the community level (e. g. richness and total density peaks at 40 – 60 % meltwater contribution); and, (iii) both unimodal and monotonic responses at the level of individual taxa. Sites characterised by high contributions of meltwater, although species poor, were important for beta diversity due to their specialist endemic fauna. Our findings suggest continued glacier and snowpack retreat due to expected future climate change are likely to lead more homogeneous <b>alpine</b> <b>river</b> habitats (i. e. reduced meltwater - groundwater stress gradient breadth). As a result, increased alpha diversity is expected as previously harsh habitats become more favourable; however, an associated decrease in beta diversity is likely as glacial stream specialists become replaced by generalists...|$|R
