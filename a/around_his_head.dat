25|$|Several traditions {{describe}} Servius' {{father as}} divine. Livy depicts Servius' mother as a captured Latin princess enslaved by the Romans; her child is chosen as Rome's future king after {{a ring of}} fire is seen <b>around</b> <b>his</b> <b>head.</b> The Emperor Claudius discounted such origins and described him as an originally Etruscan mercenary, named Mastarna, who fought for Caelius Vibenna.|$|E

25|$|The Moor's head {{is fairly}} common in European heraldry. It still appears {{today in the}} arms of Sardinia and Corsica, {{as well as in the}} blazons of various noble families. Italian heraldry, however, usually depicts the Moor wearing a white band <b>around</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> instead of a crown, {{indicating}} a slave who has been freed; whereas in German heraldry the Moor is shown wearing a crown. The Moor's head is common in the Bavarian tradition and is known as the caput Ethiopicum or the Moor of Freising.|$|E
25|$|Shepard had {{suffered}} fractures {{to the back}} of his head and in front of his right ear.

Shepard never regained consciousness and remained on full life support. While he lay in intensive care and in the days following the attack, candlelight vigils were held around the world.|$|E
25|$|A common {{variant of}} the Zoroaster images derives from a Sassanid-era rock-face carving. In this {{depiction}} at Taq-e Bostan, a figure is seen to preside over the coronation of Ardashir I or II. The figure is standing on a lotus, with a baresman in hand and with a gloriole <b>around</b> <b>his</b> <b>head.</b> Until the 1920s, this figure was commonly {{thought to be a}} depiction of Zoroaster, but in recent years is more commonly interpreted to be a depiction of Mithra. Among the most famous of the European depictions of Zoroaster is that of the figure in Raphael's 1509 The School of Athens. In it, Zoroaster and Ptolemy are having a discussion in the lower right corner. The prophet is holding a star-studded globe.|$|E

25|$|After a {{short while}} he was dragged down and {{stripped}} of his nightgown and shirt, which was then wrapped <b>around</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> before he was hauled up again. However, the mob had not tied his hands and, as he struggled free, they broke his arm and shoulder, while another attempted to set light to his naked foot. He was taken down a further time and cruelly beaten before being hung up again, and died {{a short while}} later, just before midnight on 7 September 1736. The spot where Porteous died is today marked by a memorial plate in the Grassmarket. The site of the Tolbooth is marked by paving stones arranged {{in the form of}} a heart, 'The Heart of Midlothian'. Tour guides will assure you that, even today, passers-by will spit on the spot, a tradition originally intended to demonstrate their contempt for the hated Tolbooth.|$|E
500|$|The episode portrays Mulder as a Christ-like figure. As {{scientists}} {{experiment on}} him, he {{is placed on}} a cross-like table, which has been interpreted to be symbolic of the cross to which Jesus was nailed. Mulder wears a metal ring <b>around</b> <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> similar to the biblical crown of thorns. Donaldson notes that The Smoking Man's advice to Mulder to save himself echoes the bystanders who told Jesus to save himself from the cross. She draws parallels between Mulder's status as the [...] "savior" [...] of the human race—because of his immunity from the alien infection—and Jesus, whom Christians venerate as humanity's savior.|$|E

One evening, Grimaldi was playing {{the part of a}} monkey and was led onto the stage by his father, who had attached a chain to Grimaldi's waist. [...] Giuseppe swung his young son <b>around</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> [...] "with the utmost velocity", when the chain snapped, causing young Grimaldi to land in the orchestra pit. From 1789 Grimaldi would appear alongside his siblings in an act entitled [...] "The Three Young Grimaldis".|$|E

500|$|In {{many of her}} World Grand Championship portraits, Nipper {{painted a}} montage {{depicting}} the horse's life and show career. She first used this technique for a portrait of Pride's Generator. When Nipper asked the horse's owner, Claude Crowley, if she could do a montage, Nipper said, [...] "He said 'I don't know what that is, but why not?'" [...] The style soon caught on and was requested by other horse owners. Nipper herself bred Tennessee Walking Horses, and once bred a mare to The Whole Nine Yards, a World Grand Champion, of whom she had previously painted a portrait. Although the portrait was painted before the horse ever won a title, Nipper depicted him with roses <b>around</b> <b>his</b> <b>head.</b> The horse's owner later said she almost sent the picture back.|$|E
500|$|Leonardo DiCaprio was {{the first}} actor to be cast in the film. Nolan {{had been trying to}} work with the actor for years and met him several times, but was unable to {{convince}} him to appear in any of his films until Inception. DiCaprio finally agreed because he was [...] "intrigued by this concept—this dream-heist notion and how this character's going to unlock his dreamworld and ultimately affect his real life." [...] He read the script and found it to be [...] "very well written, comprehensive but you really had to have Chris in person, to try to articulate {{some of the things that}} have been swirling <b>around</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> for the last eight years." [...] DiCaprio and Nolan spent months talking about the screenplay. Nolan took a long time re-writing the script in order [...] "to make sure that the emotional journey of his character was the driving force of the movie." [...] On February 11, 2009, it was announced that Warner Bros. purchased Inception, a spec script written by Nolan.|$|E

However final figures for the broadcast, which factored in digital and recorded viewings, rose to over 17 million making it the highest rated screening of a British soap since 2003. The episode received a massive amount of media interest, and was highly praised for displaying [...] "some of the tightest, funniest dialogue this soap has seen".
