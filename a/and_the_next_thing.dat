500|$|Although {{the first}} season {{primarily}} deals {{with the murder of}} Veronica's best friend, Lilly Kane (Amanda Seyfried), and the murder is resolved in [...] "Leave It to Beaver", another arc running throughout the season is the story of Veronica's mysterious rape a year earlier. At that time, Veronica went to a party at a wealthy student, Shelly's, house. There, she was slipped a mysterious drink, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> she knew, she woke up in an unidentified bed missing her underwear", indicating that she had been raped. The next day, she walked into the sheriff's department and reported the crime, where Sheriff Don Lamb (Michael Muhney) mocked her predicament and refused to conduct an investigation, leaving Veronica in tears.|$|E
500|$|The Skelton family {{received}} {{support from}} CBS management {{and from the}} public following the announcement of Richard's illness. Skelton himself was beset by a serious illness and by a household accident which kept him off the air. He suffered a life-threatening asthma attack on December 30, 1957, and was taken to St. John's Hospital in Santa Monica, where his doctors said that [...] "if there were ten steps to death, Red Skelton had taken nine of them {{by the time he}} had arrived". Initially hospitalized for an indeterminate length of time, Skelton later said he was working on some notes for television <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> he remembered, he was in a hospital bed; he did not know how serious his illness was until he read about it himself in the newspapers. His illness and recovery kept him off the air for a full month; Skelton returned to his television show on January 28, 1958.|$|E
500|$|Considering Kiedis had resumed heavy {{drug use}} and Frusciante was no longer present for collaboration, songs were written at a far slower rate. Working with Frusciante had been {{something}} Kiedis took for granted: [...] "John Frusciante had been a true anomaly {{when it came to}} song writing. He made it even easier than Hillel Slovak to create music, even though I'd known Hillel for years. I just figured that was how all guitar players were, that you showed them your lyrics and sang a little bit <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> you knew you had a song. That didn't happen right off the bat with Dave." [...] Drummer Chad Smith suggested it was writer's block that was holding Kiedis back from coming up with lyrics, however Kiedis strongly denied this. With the writing process taking too much time and Kiedis returning to his drug habit, Flea {{for the first time on}} any of the band's albums, besides contributing music as usual, took over and wrote some of the song's lyrics, including [...] "Transcending", his tribute to River Phoenix along with the intro and outro to [...] "Deep Kick", a song that told the story of his and Kiedis's youth. [...] Also for the first time on any album, Flea contributed lead vocals which he performed on his solo track titled [...] "Pea".|$|E
60|$|Such, {{and much}} worse, is our {{condition}} at present, if I had leisure or liberty to lay it before you; <b>and,</b> therefore, <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> {{which might be}} considered is, whether there may be any probable remedy found, at the least against some part of these evils; {{for most of them}} are wholly desperate.|$|R
6000|$|... "What of my cousin?" [...] {{demanded the}} captain, calmly. [...] "We have not met in thirty years, <b>and</b> are <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> to strangers to each other.

Perhaps if he had not lived in Paris it would never have been uttered.|$|R
2500|$|One of the 61 {{survivors}} of the Pan Am flight, John Coombs of Haleiwa, Hawaii, said that sitting in {{the nose of the}} plane probably saved his life: [...] "We all settled back, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> an explosion took place and the whole port side, left side of the plane, was just torn wide open." ...|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{this winter}} regimen, Kazmir began the {{season on the}} {{disabled}} list with hamstring and shoulder issues. He made his first start on April 15, a loss to the Yankees. His struggles continued throughout {{the first half of the}} season, as he posted the worst ERA among starters in the AL (6.92) along with a 7–9 record. Quoted in the Los Angeles Times in July, Kazmir said [...] "It kind of feels like I'm thinking too much about where I'm throwing the ball and things start snowballing, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> you know you don't really know what's going on." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 11 December 2011, after {{performing}} at the Meredith Music Festival in Victoria, Nick Cave announced on-stage that Grinderman were [...] "over," [...] telling the audience: [...] "that's it for Grinderman. It's over. We'll maybe {{see you all}} in another ten years, when we'll be even older and uglier." [...] Jim Sclavunos later told FasterLouder that [...] "we were finished with {{what we had to}} do as Grinderman and it's time to move on, for now at least, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> we are moving onto is The Bad Seeds" [...] and [...] "I can’t predict what the future of Grinderman is – if there is a future." ...|$|E

60|$|As these {{orders were}} obeyed, of course, a general bustle now took place. Mulford soon had <b>the</b> reef out, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> sail {{distended}} to the utmost, while the topgallant-mast was soon up <b>and</b> fidded. <b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> was to sway upon <b>the</b> fore-yard, <b>and</b> get that into its place.

2500|$|Owen said he grew {{up around}} [...] "a mob of entertaining, troublesome, fascinating" [...] actors {{involved}} in challenging the Lord Chamberlain during {{some of the most}} exciting days of a very controversial Royal Court Theatre. When he was at Highgate School, because his father was an actor, his teachers thought that {{he should be able to}} act, too. However, at first he was not interested. [...] "I was always made to read plays at school but I never wanted to. Then I was made to take part in a school play and I didn't want to do that either but I started to get approval for my acting. I was reasonably academic, good at sport, but somehow with the acting, people said 'that was fantastic'. So I thought,'Ok, I'll carry on doing this for a bit <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> you know that's how I make my living these days".|$|E
2500|$|Tritt is {{a member}} of the Republican Party and {{supported}} George W. Bush for President in 2000. The two met in 1996 at the Republican National Convention in San Diego, California, where Tritt sang the national anthem. Tritt told Insight on the News, that he is a strong supporter of Second Amendment rights and believes the answer to crime is not gun control but criminal control. [...] "I'm a pro-gun guy. I'm an NRA National Rifle Association member, a life member as a matter of fact. I'm more for the belief of making the punishment tougher for the criminals to start with. I think that sends much more of an incentive for people to not commit crimes of any type than taking away guns. Because you take away guns, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> you know, stabbing murders are going to increase." [...] He adds that he is [...] "definitely pro-death penalty." ...|$|E
2500|$|Minutes before impact, the {{aircraft}} had {{an altitude of}} 930 meters (3,050ft). It descended to 670meters (2,200ft) in the next 26 seconds, leveled for 16 seconds, then descended to sea level in one minute and 16 seconds. The pilots did not have control over the rate of descent, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> remembered by the first officer was seeing the altimeter approaching zero. He attempted to pull up through back pressure and adding power, but {{the aircraft}} hit the water before {{he was able to}} execute this maneuver. The impact took place at 19:21:30 PST (03:21:30 on January 14 Coordinated Universal Time) in Santa Monica Bay, about [...] west of LAX, in international waters where the sea is 110meters (350ft) deep. The crew did not recall any unusual sink rate, buffeting and yawing, nor were there any instrument warnings except a last-moment flashing of the heading-difference light.|$|E
50|$|An {{important}} {{hole for}} the prosecution to fill is how James Stone found Marilyn Miller's apartment. Miller lived in a multiple-dwelling residence, with doors leading to two different apartments inside of a main door (one upstairs, one downstairs). Miller testified that she heard a crash <b>and</b> that <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> she knew, her rapist {{was standing in the}} doorway. Her rapist thus must have known which apartment inside the building was hers.|$|R

6000|$|... 'She had a long, low, nervous fever, as {{they called}} it; but I have never known much about it, for it was when we were all taken up with John's illness.

2500|$|... "(O'Hare) {{was a great}} swimmer and spear fisherman, and {{he insisted}} that the {{squadron}} swim with him. Swimming with Butch O'Hare meant that at eight o'clock in the morning, you swam out into the ocean off Maui; he would still be out there {{at three in the}} afternoon! If he got hungry, Butch would roll over and dive, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> you knew, he would come up with a fish of some sort. Then he'd just roll over and lie on his back like an otter and eat the thing raw! He really impressed us with that! One day, he came back to the surface with an octopus draped over his arm. He said, 'Now, you {{have to learn how to}} kill these things, boys: you bite 'em right behind the eye.' And with that, he chomped down! The octopus has some sort of spinal cord there, and biting it there does kill it! Then we had to go back to the beach where Butch would put these things in a frying pan with a little oil and some salt and stir them around. He enjoyed them, but they tasted like old rubber tires to me!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Navarro's joining and Kiedis's {{continued}} {{drug addiction}} {{had a profound}} effect on the band and the subsequent sound of their next album, One Hot Minute (1995). With Frusciante no longer present for collaboration, songs were written at a far slower rate. Working with Frusciante had been something Kiedis took for granted: [...] "John had been a true anomaly when it came to song writing. He made it even easier than Hillel to create music, even though I'd known Hillel for years. I just figured that was how all guitar players were, that you showed them your lyrics and sang a little bit <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> you knew you had a song. That didn't happen right off the bat with Dave." [...] To compensate, Kiedis and bassist Flea took several vacations together, during which entire songs were conceived and with Kiedis often absent from recording due to his drug problems or struggling to come up with lyrics, Flea took a much bigger role in the writing process; coming up with ideas for many songs including full lyrics and even singing lead on his own song, [...] "Pea".|$|E
