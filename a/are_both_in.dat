5|$|While {{the lightest}} (252Lr to 254Lr) and {{heaviest}} (266Lr) lawrencium isotopes are produced only as alpha decay products of dubnium (Z=105) isotopes, the middle isotopes (255Lr to 262Lr) {{can all be}} produced by bombarding actinide (americium to einsteinium) targets with light ions (from boron to neon). The two most important isotopes, 256Lr and 260Lr, <b>are</b> <b>both</b> <b>in</b> this range. 256Lr can be produced by bombarding californium-249 with 70MeV boron-11 ions (producing lawrencium-256 and four neutrons), while 260Lr can be produced by bombarding berkelium-249 with oxygen-18 (producing lawrencium-260, an alpha particle, and three neutrons).|$|E

5|$|During the 1960s and 1970s, New York state {{planners}} {{envisioned a}} system of arterial roads in Utica that would include connections to Binghamton and Interstate 81.

Six New York State highways, one three-digit interstate highway, and one two-digit interstate highway pass through Utica. New York State Route 49 and State Route 840 are east–west expressways running along Utica's northern and southern borders, respectively, and the eastern terminus of each is in the city.
