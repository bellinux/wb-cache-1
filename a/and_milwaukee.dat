5|$|Another freeway section {{from north}} of Green Bay to Suamico was opened in 1971. In 1972, the divided-highway segment between Suamico and Abrams opened, {{and the state}} started the {{construction}} of additional freeways between Green Bay <b>and</b> <b>Milwaukee.</b> The bypasses of Sheboygan and Cedar Grove were converted to full freeways in 1973. Another segment of freeway opened in 1975 that bypassed Port Washington and connected the freeway sections that ended near Grafton and Cedar Grove. I-43 was first designated on the 1978 official state highway map along US141 from Milwaukee to Sheboygan; missing segments of I-43 between Green Bay <b>and</b> <b>Milwaukee</b> are shown as either under construction or proposed. By 1980, the northern bypass of Green Bay was under construction and I-43/US141 was open from Maribel to Branch northwest of Manitowoc; US141 was truncated to end at {{the northern end of}} the Sheboygan bypass. I-43 was initially completed in 1981, and the southern terminus of US141 was moved again, truncating the highway to end in Bellevue by 1983.|$|E

5|$|The {{team was}} {{established}} as an expansion {{team of the}} Double-A Southern League in 1978, in which it competed through 1984.

The Sounds moved to the Triple-A American Association in 1985 {{and then to the}} Triple-A Pacific Coast League in 1998.

5|$|The two daily round-trips were branded Turboliner, {{replacing}} the individual names Abraham Lincoln and Prairie State. Amtrak repeated this {{experiment with the}} Detroit <b>and</b> <b>Milwaukee</b> corridors. Track conditions limited the new trainsets to , but they were clean, comfortable, quiet and reliable. In the first year, the Chicago–St. Louis running time dropped from 5.5 to 5 hours. The Federal Railroad Administration refused a request from Amtrak to raise the speed limit to , citing inadequate signalling along the route. The new trains {{had fallen out of}} favor by the end of 1974: food service was inadequate, and the five-car fixed consist could not handle demand. Amfleet coaches and new conventional diesels replaced both of the Turboliner trainsets in 1975.|$|E
5|$|Lincolnshire's {{government}} initially {{adhered to}} a conservative and cautious approach, {{and refused to}} annex two corporate park divisions in the 1980s. Opponents to the village government's methods, however, won out in later years; supporting a quick growth to rival the increasing affluence of surrounding villages, they oversaw the cessions of the Marriott Lincolnshire Resort and Lincolnshire Corporate Center {{over a period of}} years following 1983. Lincolnshire also sought to annex the old remnants of the unincorporated community of Half Day from which it was created, but lost in a court battle with the village of Vernon Hills in 1994; the court case set the present-day border between the two villages, which lies along Route 22 up to its intersection with Milwaukee Avenue. To consolidate these new acquisitions, Lincolnshire set to work on a new village hall that was completed in 1993, and constructed a downtown area centered on the intersection of Aptakisic Road <b>and</b> <b>Milwaukee</b> Avenue; the village's endeavors included commercial regions like the Lincolnshire Corporate Center, City Park, and the Lincolnshire Commons. These facilities were planned and constructed from the mid-1990s to the mid-2000s.|$|E

He will concentrate on his continued recovery and the rehabilitation process following bilateral hip surgery this past summer. During his career at Michigan, Albrecht played in 115 career games, and was named Michigan's co-MVP during the 2014–15 season, after starting 18 of 31 games and posting a career-best 7.5 points per game, while battling hip problems. On March 29, Albrecht announced that he would use the graduate transfer option to play a fifth year at another school. On April 1, head coach John Beilein decided not to restrict Albrecht or teammate Ricky Doyle from transferring to schools within the Big Ten if they desired to do so. By April 18, Albrecht was considering interest from home state Big Ten programs Purdue and Indiana as well as Wichita State, Texas A, Syracuse, USC, <b>and</b> <b>Milwaukee</b> (where Michigan assistant coach LaVall Jordan had just taken over as head coach).|$|E

5|$|On November 9, 2007, Yao {{played against}} fellow Chinese NBA <b>and</b> <b>Milwaukee</b> Bucks player Yi Jianlian {{for the first}} time. The game, which the Rockets won 104–88, was {{broadcast}} on 19networks in China, and was watched by over 200million people in China alone, {{making it one of}} the most-watched NBA games in history. In the 2008 NBA All-Star Game, Yao was once again voted to start at center for the Western Conference. Before the All-Star weekend, the Rockets had won eight straight games, and after the break, they took their win streak to 12games. On February 26, 2008, however, it was reported that Yao would miss the rest of the season with a stress fracture in his left foot. He missed the 2008 NBA Playoffs, but he did not miss the 2008 Summer Olympics at Beijing, China in August. After Yao's injury, the Rockets stretched their winning streak to 22 games, at the time the second-longest such streak in NBA history. Yao underwent a successful operation on March 3, which placed screws in his foot to strengthen the bone, and recovery time was estimated at four months. Yao's final averages in 55games were 22.0points, 10.8rebounds, and 2.0blocks a game.|$|E
5|$|The Half Day area {{experienced}} an economic boom {{with the arrival}} of new settlers during the two decades after Wright's arrival. Among these pioneers were Seth Washburn, the first postmaster of the Vernon Township, who settled at the site of what later became the Lincolnshire-Prairie View School District 103's Half Day Intermediate School, and Laura Sprague, the first teacher to reside in the area. By 1855, 21years after the settling of the Half Day area by Wright, the town was a thriving community with a blacksmith's shop, sawmill, country store, and a church. At this time, the Chicago <b>and</b> <b>Milwaukee</b> Railroad connected Milwaukee to the county seat of Waukegan, and it expanded throughout the Lake County area over the next few decades; this also contributed to the town's prosperity. Henry Ford's invention of the automobile in the early 20thcentury made Half Day a more accessible destination to other communities within the Chicago metropolitan area, and the village became a popular recreation area. This prompted the opening of many businesses, including an amusement park, a race track, a bowling alley, a dance hall, and taverns, that catered to visitors.|$|E
5|$|The Sounds changed {{affiliates}} in 2005, {{welcoming the}} Milwaukee Brewers as their sixth different major league franchise. Coincidentally, the major/minor league sports connection between Nashville <b>and</b> <b>Milwaukee</b> was duplicated from 2005 to 2014, but with reverse roles, in ice hockey, as the Milwaukee Admirals were the top-level minor league affiliate of the National Hockey League's Nashville Predators. The Sounds also debuted a new oval-shaped logo {{with a baseball}} player silhouetted against a yellow background hitting a ball toward the Nashville skyline with the city's name written above within a red border and the team name written in red and black script below. The new Brewers affiliate was managed by Frank Kremblas and featured top prospects such as Rickie Weeks, Prince Fielder, Nelson Cruz, and Corey Hart. The affiliation started well as the club won the American Conference Northern Division title on the second-to-last {{day of the season}} with a 75–69 record. The team {{went on to win the}} American Conference title against the Oklahoma RedHawks, three games to two, before sweeping the Tacoma Rainiers in three straight games in the finals to win the 2005 Pacific Coast League championship. Outfielder Nelson Cruz clinched the title with a three-run home run with two outs in the 13th inning. This was Nashville's first title since their previous league crown in 1982 and their first championship as a Triple-A team.|$|E
