Each nation could enter a maximum of five athletes per race and the team scores were calculated by combining the finishing times of each team's top three runners. Nations with less than three runners were disregarded for the team event and their runners competed for the individual prizes only.|$|E

25|$|Levonorgestrel-releasing implant {{should not}} be used in women with liver disease, breast cancer, or blood clots. Women who believe they may already be {{pregnant}} or those with vaginal bleeding should first see a physician.

25|$|Girls <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>with</b> CAH {{constitute}} {{the majority of}} genetic females with normal internal reproductive hormones who {{have been exposed to}} male levels of testosterone throughout their prenatal lives. Milder degrees of continuing androgen exposure continue throughout childhood and adolescence {{as a consequence of the}} imperfections of current glucocorticoid treatment for CAH. The psychosexual development of these girls and women has been analyzed as evidence of the role of androgens in human sex-dimorphic behaviors.|$|E
25|$|However, gender {{identity}} of girls <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>with</b> CAH is nearly always unequivocally female. Sexual orientation is more mixed, though {{the majority are}} heterosexual. In one study, 27% of women with CAH were rated as bisexual in their orientations. Abnormalities of body image due {{to the effects of}} the disease likely {{play a role in the}} sexual development of these women, and one cannot conclude that the androgens are the major determinant of their sexuality.|$|E

25|$|In October 1988, Orr {{publicly}} {{announced the}} upcoming release of his cookbook, which became his first published work.

The cookbook was expanded to include contributions from other notable Nebraskan men, including Tonight Show host Johnny Carson and football coach Tom Osborne. Ultimately, Orr wrote the cookbook to include recipe submissions from famous men <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>with</b> ties to Nebraska or the Orrs. Notable contributors to Orr's cookbook, in addition to Carson and Osborne, included then United States First Lady Barbara Bush, former First Lady Nancy Reagan, Katharine Hepburn, Dick Cavett, and Warren Buffett.|$|E
