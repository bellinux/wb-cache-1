50|$|The African {{lungfishes}} are obligate <b>air</b> <b>breathers,</b> {{with reduced}} gills in the adults. They have two anterior gill arches that retain gills, {{though they are}} too small to function as the sole respiratory apparatus. The lungfish heart has adaptations that partially separate the flow of blood into its pulmonary and systemic circuits. The atrium is partially divided, so that the left side receives oxygenated blood and the right side receives deoxygenated blood from the other tissues. These two blood streams remain mostly separate as they flow through the ventricle leading to the gill arches. As a result, oxygenated blood mostly goes to the anterior gill arches and the deoxygenated blood mostly goes to the posterior arches.|$|R
50|$|Unlike the South American and African {{lungfish}}es, the Australian {{species has}} gills {{on all the}} first four gill arches, while the fifth arch bears a hemibranch. It is also the only facultative <b>air</b> <b>breather</b> lungfish species, only breathing air when oxygen in the water {{is not sufficient to}} meet their needs. The lung is a single long sac situated above and extending the length of the body cavity, and is formed by a ventral outgrowth of the gut. Internally, the lung is divided into two distinct lobes that interconnect along its length, compartmentalized by the infolding of the walls.Each compartment is further divided to form a spongy alveolar region. Blood capillaries run through this region close enough to the air space in the lung to enable gas exchange. Lungfish breathe in using a buccal force-pump similar to that of amphibians. The contraction of smooth muscles in the walls of the lung results in exhalation.|$|E

50|$|Callichthys is {{normally}} found in large schools on the muddy bottoms of slow-moving rivers, pools, drainage ditches, and swampy areas. In water with low oxygen content, {{the fish are}} capable of utilizing atmospheric air by taking in a gulp of air at {{the surface of the}} water and passing it back to the hind gut. The walls of the gut are lined with tiny blood vessels into which the oxygen from the air can pass, similar to the function of true lungs. The remaining gasses pass out through the anus. When there is a severe drought, these <b>air</b> <b>breathers</b> are able to traverse short stretches of land seeking better conditions. The fish is also capable of making sounds, both grunts and squeaks.|$|R
40|$|In hypoxia-intolerant {{temperate}} fish such as {{the rainbow}} trout, exposure to severe environmental hypoxia results in a large elevation of circulating catecholamines (Reid et al., 1998). In general, these hormones serve to increase the transfer of oxygen across the gills and the transport of oxygen, in the blood, to actively metabolising tissues. During environmental hypoxia, catecholamines are mobilised into the blood when the arterial oxygen content decreases by approximately 50 % (Perry and Reid, 1994). Furthermore, the concentration of plasma catecholamines can reach over 500 nmol l- 1 in this species. This study examined whether hypoxia-tolerant neotropical fish also release catecholamines during hypoxia and whether the levels are comparable to those observed in the rainbow trout.

40|$|Frequency of aerial {{respiration}} in Ctenopoma muriei {{increased as}} dissolved oxygen (DO) decreased; breathing behaviour was spatially synchronous, {{and there was}} no difference in air-breathing frequency between populations from a high- and low-DO site. Although C. muriei survived without access to the surface, its loss of buoyancy and equilibrium under these conditions suggested that it is a functionally obligatory <b>air</b> <b>breather.</b> # 2005 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles Key words: Anabantidae; bimodal breather; synchronous air breathing; tropical freshwater fish. All air-breathing fishes are bimodal, and thus use a combination of aerial and aquatic respiration. This is partially because air-breathing fishes continue to rely on their gills for gas exchange, nitrogen excretion and ionic regulation (Claiborne, 1998; Gilmour, 1998; Karnaky, 1998). There is a large range, how-ever, in the use of aquatic respiration among air-breathing fishes. Fishes that regularly use aerial respiration over a range of dissolved oxygen (DO) levels are considered continuous air breathers (Graham, 1997).

5000|$|As an {{intermediate}} in the fish-tetrapod evolution, Panderichthys {{had the capacity}} to breathe air. The trend from the early sarcopterygians to the first tetrapods was an increase {{in the size of the}} spiracular chamber and its opening to the outside. Compared to Eusthenopteron, the spiracular chamber of Panderichthys is greatly expanded and the hyomandibula is shorter compared to those in fish. The opercular series was also shorter compared to other osteolepiforms. Panderichthys also has a single external nasal opening and a palatal choana. In contrast to earlier osteolepiforms, the palatal choana is elongated and the nariochoanal lamina is narrow. Along with the spiracular chamber, this feature in Panderichthys can be considered transitional during the evolution from fish to tetrapods. Sarcopterygians such as Panderichthys can be considered at least facultative <b>air</b> <b>breathers</b> and demonstrate {{an intermediate}} form as air breathing was becoming more abundant.|$|R
30|$|Compared to {{euryhaline}} teleosts (Jensen et al. 1998; Kelly and Woo 1999; Lin et al. 2004 a, b, 2006; Scott et al. 2006; Chew et al. 2009; Huang et al. 2010), {{fluctuations in}} body fluid osmolality and ionic concentrations were relatively small {{in the three}} sea snakes subjected to salinity challenges. Changes in osmolality are about 50 to 100 mOsm/kg in teleosts, whereas they were only about 20 mOsm/kg in these sea snakes (Figure  1). In teleosts, the problem of osmotic and ionic gradients is exacerbated {{by the presence of}} the gill epithelium, a large, thin tissue used for efficient gas exchange and passive movement of water and salts (Evans et al. 2005). In contrast, the sea snakes are <b>air</b> <b>breathers,</b> and their skin is impermeable to Na+ and slightly permeable to water (Dunson and Robinson 1976; Lillywhite et al. 2009). Therefore, the body fluid osmolality and ionic composition were relatively stable in these sea snakes subjected to salinity changes.|$|R

The hematological parameters presented seasonal variations, which were not correlated to oxygen, temperature, and water level oscillations. Five anodic hemoglobin fractions were detected in starch gel electrophoresis. In addition to ATP, GTP and Fe-GTP being detected, 2, 3 -DPG was also detected in red blood cells of H. littorale.

40|$|This study {{examined}} the stress response of pirarucu juveniles in a closed system transport. Pirarucu (Arapaima gigas) is a native Amazonian fish species from the Osteoglossidae family and an obligated <b>air</b> <b>breather.</b> A short duration transport trial (6 h) was undertaken comparing closed polyethylene bags filled with atmospheric air (Air group) and bags filled with pure oxygen (Oxi group). Dissolved oxygen was the only water parameter that presented a difference between fish groups, and was saturated in the oxi group as expected. There was no mortality in either group after transport. Fish feeding was observed 36 h after transport for all fish, and normal feeding consumption was observed at 72 h. In both groups physiological responses were similar. Cortisol did not show any significant alteration during the sampled period. Unlike most fish species, cortisol values were unaltered in both groups during sampling, while glucose presented a significant change up to 12 h after transport. The results showed that pirarucu transport in plastic bags could be made with either atmospheric air or pure oxygen, since physiological response to stress, water quality and feeding behavior after 36 h were similar in both groups...|$|E
40|$|Odontamblyopus lacepedii is an eel goby that inhabits both {{coastal waters}} and {{intertidal}} zones in East Asia, including Japan. The fish excavates burrows in mudflats but, unlike the sympatric amphibious mudskippers, {{it does not}} emerge but stays in the burrows filled with hypoxic water during low tide. Endoscopic observations of the field burrows demonstrated that the fish breathed air in the burrow opening; air breathing commenced 1. 3 h following burrow emersion, when water P O 2 was âˆ¼ 2. 8 kPa, with an air-breathing frequency (f AB) of 7. 3 Â± 2. 9 breaths h â€“ 1 (mean Â± s. d., N= 5). Laboratory experiments revealed that the fish is a facultative <b>air</b> <b>breather.</b> It never breathed air in normoxic water (P O 2 = 20. 7 kPa) but started bimodal respiration when water P O 2 was reduced to 1. 0 â€“ 3. 1 kPa. The fish held air inside the mouth and probably used the gills as gas-exchange surfaces since no rich vascularization occurred in the mouth linings. As is known for other air-breathing fishes, f AB increased with decreasing water P O 2. Both buccal gas volume (V B) and inspired volume (V I) were significantly correlated with body mass (M b). At a given M b, V I was nearly always equal to V B, implying almost complete buccal gas renewal in every breathing cycle. A temporal reduction in expired volume (V E) was probably due to a low aerial gas exchange ratio (CO 2 elimination/O 2 uptake). Air breathing appears to have evolved in O. lacepedii as an adaptation to aquatic hypoxia in the burrows. The acquisition of the novel respiratory capacity enables this species {{to stay in the}} burrows during low tide and extends the resident time in the mudflat, thereby increasing its chances of tapping the rich resources of the area.
