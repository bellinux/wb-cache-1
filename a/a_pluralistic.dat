5|$|Ibn Batuta, {{during his}} visit in 1344, {{observed}} that the kingdom of Jaffna was a major trading kingdom with extensive overseas contacts. The Kingdom's trades were oriented towards maritime South India, with which it developed a commercial interdependence. The non-agriculture tradition of the kingdom became strong {{as a result of}} large coastal fishing and boating population and growing opportunities for seaborne commerce. Influential commercial groups, drawn mainly from south Indian mercantile groups as well as other, resided in the royal capital, port, and market centers. Artisan settlements were also established and groups of skilled tradesmen—carpenters, stonemasons, wavers, dryers, gold and silver smiths—resided in urban centers. Thus, <b>a</b> <b>pluralistic</b> socio-economic tradition of agriculture marine activities, commerce and handicraft production was well established.|$|E

However, it continues to face the challenges of poverty, corruption, malnutrition, and inadequate public healthcare.

Finally, to operationalize how the complex relationships between law and agroecosystems can be studied from <b>a</b> legal <b>pluralistic</b> perspective, it describes the rise of nonstate sovereigns over sustainability...|$|R

25|$|The {{pressures}} of indigenization {{and the growing}} acceptance of a unique Taiwanese cultural identity have met opposition from more conservative elements of Taiwan society. Critics argue that the new perspective creates a “false” identity rooted in ethnic nationalism {{as opposed to an}} “authentic” Chinese identity, which is primordial and inherent. Many mainlanders living on Taiwan complain that their own culture is marginalized by bentuhua, and initially expressed fear of facing growing alienation.

25|$|Feyerabend {{described}} {{science as}} being essentially anarchistic, obsessed {{with its own}} mythology, and as making claims to truth well beyond its actual capacity. He was especially indignant about the condescending attitudes of many scientists towards alternative traditions. For example, he thought that negative opinions about astrology and the effectivity of rain dances were not justified by scientific research, and dismissed the predominantly negative attitudes of scientists towards such phenomena as elitist or racist. In his opinion, science has become a repressing ideology, even though it arguably started as a liberating movement. Feyerabend thought that <b>a</b> <b>pluralistic</b> society should be protected from being influenced too much by science, {{just as it is}} protected from other ideologies.|$|E

25|$|By {{the time}} of the English Revolution Helwys' stance on {{religious}} toleration was more commonplace. However, whilst accepting their zeal in desiring a 'godly society', some contemporary historians doubt whether the English Puritans during the English Revolution were as committed to religious liberty and pluralism as traditional histories have suggested. However, historian John Coffey's recent work emphasises the contribution of a minority of radical Protestants who steadfastly sought toleration for heresy, blasphemy, Catholicism, non-Christian religions, and even atheism. This minority included the Seekers, as well as the General Baptists and the Levellers. Their collective witness demanded the church be an entirely voluntary, non-coercive community able to evangelise in <b>a</b> <b>pluralistic</b> society governed by a purely civil state. Such a demand was {{in sharp contrast to the}} ambitions of the magisterial Protestantism of the Calvinist majority.|$|E

According to McKenna, feminism rejects dualistic ways of thinking, especially [...] "typical male/female dualism". Feminist philosophy, instead, calls for <b>a</b> <b>pluralistic</b> way of thinking, noting {{that there are many}} consistent sets of truths about the world. In the episode, Scully starts out [...] "sure of her more rational scientific view and approach". As the episode progresses, however, she decides to branch out.

500|$|There are {{multiple}} ways {{to define the}} concept of [...] "species." [...] The choice of definition {{is dependent on the}} particularities of the species concerned. For example, some species concepts apply more readily toward sexually reproducing organisms while others lend themselves better toward asexual organisms. Despite the diversity of various species concepts, these various concepts can be placed into one of three broad philosophical approaches: interbreeding, ecological and phylogenetic. The Biological Species Concept (BSC) {{is a classic example of}} the interbreeding approach. Defined by Ernst Mayr in 1942, the BSC states that [...] "species are groups of actually or potentially interbreeding natural populations, which are reproductively isolated from other such groups." [...] Despite its wide and long-term use, the BSC like others is not without controversy, for example because these concepts cannot be applied to prokaryotes, and this is called the species problem. Some researchers have attempted a unifying monistic definition of species, while others adopt <b>a</b> <b>pluralistic</b> approach and suggest that there may be different ways to logically interpret the definition of a species.|$|E
500|$|The {{last two}} {{chapters}} feature Peshkin's {{commentary on the}} school in society, its tradeoffs and comparison with other total institutions and larger social movements, like the New Religious Right. He also compares the academy to public and parochial schools, wherein he finds public school students more politically tolerant and acceptant of religious pluralism. Peshkin's final reflections are written as a [...] "cost-benefit analysis" [...] of these Christian schools in the larger American society. In the last chapter, Peshkin contemplates how his Jewish identity is insulated within <b>a</b> <b>pluralistic</b> and secular society, and how he is fearful of absolutist [...] "imperious, implacable logic" [...] and [...] "zeal for conversion and exclusivism". He recounted that while the school spoke derogatorily of non-fundamentalists and non-Christians, no one spoke of the American religious plurality that permitted this. In response to the encroaching state, fundamentalists feel that their political conviction should mirror that of their religion. Peshkin views the school as schismatic in a larger society for promoting intolerance towards fellow Americans. He also praised traits of the schools including its community, dedicated teachers, and attractive image. At the time of print, Christian schools like Bethany were outpacing the growth of other schools. In 1989, Christian schools comprised about 20% of private school enrollment—around 700,000 students.|$|E
