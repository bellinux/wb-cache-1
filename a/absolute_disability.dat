This paper extends earlier analyses which show that the probability of employment is a variable, not an <b>absolute.</b> The <b>disability</b> employment penalty varies by number, type, severity and duration of impairments. Many impaired people's job prospects are scarcely affected, and they are probably not "disabled" at all. Others have very low chances of employment, and fit the concept of "incapacity". In between is a group who face serious barriers, without work being ruled out altogether. This " 50 : 50 " group may be the primary focus of policy interest...|$|R
40|$|Patients with Parkinson's disease, 132 in number, were {{followed}} up after approximately one year, {{and measures of}} depression and disability re-administered. Depression was common on both occasions, and was characterized by dysphoria, pessimism and somatic symptoms, but not guilt or self-blame. Depression and disability were associated on both occasions. The relationship between changes in disability and depression across time was complex. In trying to understand changes in depression, the <b>absolute</b> change in <b>disability</b> may be {{less important than the}} relative change and rate of change. The results were discussed in relation to findings from other disease groups, and the implications for the clinical management of depression in Parkinson's disease...|$|R

Attempts to manage clinical outcome by systemic infusion of recombinant tissue plasminogen acti-vator (rt-PA) have so far had mixed success. 1 2 The benefits seen in the National Institutes of Neurological Diseases and Stroke (NINDS) trial of rt-PA in acute ischaemic stroke were a significant <b>absolute</b> improvement in <b>disability</b> outcome. 2 3 However, the risks in that study and in the European Cooperative Acute Stroke Study (ECASS) 1 included further disability and mortality associated with haemorrhagic consequences of the plasminogen activator (PA). 1 2 Three recent studies of streptokinase in acut...|$|R
40|$|Positive {{obligations}} of state arising from Art. 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights focusing on persons with <b>disabilities</b> <b>Absolute</b> prohibition {{of torture and}} ill-treatment is clearly set in article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights. When assessing particular obligations, which are arising out of it, {{we need to look}} deep into the European Court of Human Rights jurisprudence. The aim of this thesis is to analyse positive {{obligations of}} state arising from article 3 focusing on persons with disabilities. This is achieved also with the aid of various human right bodies such as UN Human Rights Committee, UN Committee on Torture or UN Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. Due to the fact that this area is not really covered yet, certain parts of this thesis are focused on defining important terms and putting them together. The approach is analytic with elements of comparison between the view of European Court of Human Rights and other relevant international human rights bodies. The thesis is composed of three main chapters. Chapter One is introductory and defines the main terms such as ill-treatment, torture, scope of the article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights in connection with rights of persons with disabilities and the concept of positive obligations [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} whether the socioeconomic disparity in disability status in Korea improved during the decade between 1994 and 2004. Information was obtained from the National Survey of Elders' Life and Welfare Desires in 1994, 1998, and 2004. Age-adjusted disability rates by educational level and income were calculated separately for women and men. Prevalence ratios for disability by education and income were estimated using log-binomial regression. The relative index of inequality (RII) was calculated controlling for age. We also assessed trends in the disability rate as well as the RII p-trend by year. We found that disability rates declined during the decade from 1994 to 2004 among Koreans aged 65 years old or older. Older persons with less education and income exhibited greater decline in their disability than did those with higher socioeconomic status. Although the <b>absolute</b> disparity in <b>disability</b> decreased during the studied decade, the relative disparity for any disability remained stable in terms of both education and income. Despite rapid decreases in socioeconomic inequality among older adults with severe disabilities, older adults with lower socioeconomic status have remained more vulnerable to milder forms of disability during recent years.

5000|$|In the Avegnor case, the Louisiana Supreme Court {{held that}} {{there was such a}} privity between a person whose life estate had been {{condemned}} under the Act of July 17, 1862, and his heirs, that the latter were bound by a suit and decree to enforce a mortgage executed by their ancestor containing the pact de non alienando, to which the ancestor alone had been made a party defendant. It is sustained by Wallach v. Van Riswick, ubi supra, as will appear by the following passages from that Court's opinion:"If it be contended that the heirs of Charles S. Wallach," [...] the person whose property had been condemned,"cannot take by descent unless their father, at his death, was seized of an estate of inheritance, e.g., reversion or a remainder, it may be answered that even at common law it was not always necessary that the ancestor should be seized to enable the heir to take by descent. Shelley's Case is that where the ancestor might have taken and been seized, the heir shall inherit. Fortescue, J., in Thornby v. Fleetwood, 1 Str. 318.""If it were true that at common law the heirs could not take in any case where their ancestor was not seized at his death, the present case must be determined by the statute. Charles S. Wallach was seized of the entire fee of the land before its confiscation, and the act of Congress interposed to take from him that seizing for a limited time. That it was competent to do, attaching the limitation {{for the benefit of the}} heirs. It wrought no corruption of blood. In Lord de la Warre's Case, 11 Coke 1a, it was resolved by the justices""{{that there was}} a difference betwixt disability personal and temporary and a <b>disability</b> <b>absolute</b> and perpetual, as where one is attainted of treason and felony, that is an <b>absolute</b> and perpetual <b>disability,</b> by corruption of blood, for any of his posterity to claim any inheritance in fee simple, either as heir to him or any ancestor above him, but when one is disabled by Parliament (without any attainder) to claim the dignity for his life, it is a personal disability for his life only, and his heir, after his death, may claim as heir to him or to any ancestor above him.""There is a close analogy between that case and the present.""Without pursuing this discussion further, we repeat, that to hold that any estate or interest remained in Charles S. Wallach after the confiscation and sale of the land in controversy, would defeat the avowed purpose of the confiscation act and the only justification for its enactment, and to hold that the joint resolution was not intended for the benefit of his heirs exclusively, to enable them to take the inheritance after his death, would give preference to the guilty over the innocent. We cannot so hold." ...|$|R

A composite indicator of income, education, and fertility was developed (Socio-demographic Index [SDI]) for each geographic unit and year, which evaluates the historical association between SDI and health loss. Global child and adolescent mortality decreased from 14. 18 million (95 % uncertainty interval [UI], 14. 09 million to 14. 28 million) deaths in 1990 to 7. 26 million (95 % UI, 7. 14 million to 7. 39 million) deaths in 2015, but progress has been unevenly distributed. Countries with a lower SDI had a larger proportion of mortality burden (75 %) in 2015 than was the case in 1990 (61 %). Most deaths in 2015 occurred in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. Global trends were driven by reductions in mortality owing to infectious, nutritional, and neonatal disorders, which in the aggregate led to a relative increase in the importance of noncommunicable diseases and injuries in explaining global disease burden. The <b>absolute</b> burden of <b>disability</b> in children and adolescents increased 4. 3 % (95 % UI, 3. 1 %- 5. 6 %) from 1990 to 2015, with much of the increase owing to population growth and improved survival for children and adolescents to older ages. Other than infectious conditions, many top causes of disability are associated with long-term sequelae of conditions present at birth (eg, neonatal disorders, congenital birth defects, and hemoglobinopathies) and complications of a variety of infections and nutritional deficiencies. Anemia, developmental intellectual disability, hearing loss, epilepsy, and vision loss are important contributors to childhood disability that can arise from multiple causes. Maternal and reproductive health remains a key cause of disease burden in adolescent females, especially in lower-SDI countries. In low-SDI countries, mortality is the primary driver of health loss for children and adolescents, whereas disability predominates in higher-SDI locations; the specific pattern of epidemiological transition varies across diseases and injuries. Consistent international attention and investment have led to sustained improvements in causes of health loss among children and adolescents in many countries, although progress has been uneven.

40|$|Objective. To {{assess the}} {{prevalence}} and the prognostic factors of disabilities after minor and major childhood injuries and to analyze which sociodemographic and injury-related factors are predictive for suboptimal functioning {{in the long}} term. Method. We conducted a patient follow-up study in a stratified sample of 1221 injured children who were aged 5 to 14 years and had visited an emergency department in the Netherlands. Our study sample was stratified so that severe, less common injuries were overrepresented. Postal questionnaires were sent 2. 5, 5, and 9 months after the injury. We gathered injury and external cause data, sociodemographic information, and data on functional outcome with a generic health status measure EuroQol (EQ- 5 D) with an additional cognitive dimension. A nonresponse analysis was performed by multivariate logistic regression, and the data were adjusted for nonresponse and the sample stratification. We performed bootstrap analysis to estimate the prevalence of disability {{in terms of the}} EQ- 5 D summary score and the occurrence of limitations in separate health domains: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression, and cognition. Respondents also rated their own health state on a visual analog scale, between 0 (worst imaginable health state) and 100 (best imaginable health state). We analyzed the relationship between functional outcome and sociodemographic (age and gender) and injury-related determinants (type of injury, external cause, multiple injury, admission to hospital, and length of stay) by logistic regression analysis. Results. Response rates with respect to the original sample were 43 %, 31 %, and 30 %, respectively. A total of 37 % of the children were admitted to the hospital. The mean age of the children was 9. 6 years. In two thirds (65 %) of the cases, the injury was attributed to a home and/or leisure injury. The health status of injured children improved from 0. 92 (EQ- 5 D summary score) at 2. 5 months to 0. 96 at 5 months and 0. 98 at 9 months. Of all injured children, 26 % had at least 1 functional limitation after 2. 5 months, 18 % after 5 months, and 8 % still experienced functional limitations after 9 months. After 2. 5 months, lower extremity fractures and other injuries (eg, spinal cord injury, injury of the nerves) demonstrated the worst functional outcome. Independent of the type of injury, our sample of injured children generally showed good recovery between 2. 5 and 9 months. The highest prevalence of dysfunction after 9 months existed for pain/discomfort (7 %) and usual activities (5 %). Hospital admission (odds ratio: 3. 6 - 5. 8) and female gender (odds ratio: 3. 0) were predictive for long-term disability. Girls reported more problems for all health domains (except self-care) compared with boys after 9 months, which was also confirmed by the visual analog scale score for self-related health (89 for girls vs 95 for boys). Almost one fifth of injured children with a hospital stay of > 3 days still had pain and problems with usual activities 9 months after the injury. Three quarters of all residual problems were caused by nonhospitalized injuries. Conclusion. Most children show quick and full recovery after injury, but a small subgroup of patients (8 %) have residual disabilities after 9 months. Girls have a 3 -fold risk compared with boys for long-term disability after childhood injury. Prognosis in the long-term is also negatively influenced by hospitalization, but in <b>absolute</b> terms, residual <b>disabilities</b> are frequently caused by injuries that are treated fully in the emergency department. The group of injured children with persistent health problems as identified in this study indicates the importance of health monitoring over a longer period in trauma care, whereas trauma care should be targeted at early identification and management of the particular needs of these patients.
