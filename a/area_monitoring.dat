50|$|Delayed neutron {{analysis}} {{can be used}} for accurate screening of various materials for fissile content. The determination requires only six minutes and features a 15-picogram detection limit. Samples of smears, vegetation, soil, rock, plastics, wood, metal, and sand are equally amenable to delayed neutron analysis. This tool facilitates International Atomic Energy Agency IAEA efforts to establish wide <b>area</b> <b>monitoring</b> and enables individual inspectors to obtain large numbers of samples in the hopes of finding required evidence. By screening those samples, the very high costs of destructive analysis are required only for those samples deemed interesting. Delayed neutron analysis is becoming increasingly useful for these studies.|$|E
50|$|In 2006, China's Wide <b>Area</b> <b>Monitoring</b> Systems (WAMS) for its 6 grids had 300 PMUs {{installed}} mainly at 500 kV and 330 kV substations {{and power}} plants. By 2012, China {{plans to have}} PMUs at all 500kV substations and all powerplants of 300MW and above. Since 2002, China has built its own PMUs to its own national standard. One type has higher sampling rates than typical and is used in power plants to measure rotor angle of the generator, reporting excitation voltage, excitation current, valve position, and output of the power system stabilizer (PSS). All PMUs are connected via private network, and samples are received within 40 ms on average.|$|E
50|$|A curfew {{requirement}} {{can require}} that an offender {{will be at}} a fixed address for between 2-12 hours during a 24-hour period {{for up to six}} months. The order can be enforced with electronic tagging. These orders can only be issued if there is monitoring system for curfew in their <b>area.</b> <b>Monitoring</b> can be done via spot-check, with private security firm sending employees to check on an offender at home or but more commonly by electronic tagging. The cost of tagging is estimated to be £675 per month per offender. This compares favourably with keeping an offender in prison which is estimated at £1,555 per offender per month. A 2007 report showed that 58 per cent of offenders broke the terms of their tagging order and more than a quarter committed further offences.|$|E
