5|$|Even {{within the}} Bond canon, Goldfinger is acknowledged; the 22nd Bond film, Quantum of Solace, {{includes}} {{an homage to}} the gold body paint death scene by having a female character dead on a bed nude, covered in crude oil. Outside the Bond films, elements of Goldfinger, such as Oddjob and his use of his hat as a weapon, Bond removing his drysuit to reveal a tuxedo underneath and the laser scene have been homaged or spoofed in works such as True Lies, The Simpsons, and the <b>Austin</b> <b>Powers</b> series. The US television programme MythBusters explored many scenarios seen in the film, such as the explosive depressurisation in a plane at high altitudes, the death by full body painting, an ejector seat {{in a car and}} using a tuxedo under a drysuit.|$|E

500|$|Regarding {{comparisons}} between {{the game and the}} <b>Austin</b> <b>Powers</b> film series, Hubbard pointed out on several occasions that, unlike <b>Austin</b> <b>Powers,</b> No One Lives Forever is not a parody of the spy genre.

500|$|In the 2002 film <b>Austin</b> <b>Powers</b> in Goldmember, Beyoncé portrays Foxxy Cleopatra, {{the female}} protagonist {{alongside}} the film's lead character, <b>Austin</b> <b>Powers,</b> portrayed by Canadian film actor and comedian Mike Myers. Cleopatra is a parody to {{the characters in}} blaxploitation films such as Foxy Brown and Cleopatra Jones, {{both of which are}} used in her name. Her clothing style is reminiscent of the disco era and her hair is in the afro style of the time. Taking inspiration from her portrayal, Beyoncé adopted in the song a persona similar to that of Cleopatra. Cleopatra and police officer Get Christie Love! use the slang term [...] "sugar", which Beyoncé ad-libs and incorporates into the song. Many similarities are seen as she performs under her Cleopatra persona in the music video of [...] "Work It Out". Due to the characters' sassy nature, Beyoncé performs the song very confidently and assertively. Powers meets Cleopatra at the villain's discothèque in 1975, which attributes to Cleopatra's disco-type fashion and the heavily inspired disco-era music video for [...] "Work It Out".|$|E
500|$|Universal {{approached}} screenwriter Jim Herzfeld {{to expand}} the screenplay. Herzfeld expanded the modest script, completing the first draft as early as 1996. He initially presented it to Roach who had, up to that point, directed the first two <b>Austin</b> <b>Powers</b> films. Roach admits to have liked the script {{from the beginning and}} was very much willing to make the film even though he thought [...] "it needed more work." [...] Universal initially declined to have relatively inexperienced Roach take on the project. The studio was skeptical of Roach's ability to direct a [...] "less-cartoony, character-driven script" [...] compared to a comedy like <b>Austin</b> <b>Powers.</b> Universal's reluctance to give the project to Roach was also due to new interest from Steven Spielberg who wanted to direct and produce the film with Jim Carrey playing the role of Greg Focker. However, Spielberg and Carrey never took the project past the planning stages. The script was then returned to Roach who had by now taken on his next project of Mystery, Alaska but was still interested in making Meet the Parents.|$|E
500|$|The exaggerated {{nature of}} the plot and space station {{sequence}} has seen the film parodied on numerous occasions. Of note is the <b>Austin</b> <b>Powers</b> spoof film [...] (1999) which whilst a parody of other James Bond films, pays reference to Moonraker by Dr. Evil's lair in space. The scene in which Drax is shot by the cyanide dart and ousted into space is parodied by Powers' ejection of Dr. Evil's clone Mini-Me into outer space in the same way.|$|E
50|$|Also in plastic, Hubley {{did make}} {{contracted}} promotional models, cars {{very similar to}} those made by AMT, Jo-Han, or PMC. Hubley's angle was unique in contracting particular models that other promo manufacturers did not, or could not, get contracts for. While AMT or Jo-Han focused on sportier two-doors and convertibles, Hubley promotionals were a bit different, featuring station wagon and four-door configurations, or independent manufacturers not represented by the other model makers. For example, one of the cuter promos ever done - by any company - was the <b>Austin</b> <b>powered</b> 1960 American Motors Nash Metropolitan. The Metropolitan was made in a couple of two-tone color schemes - similar to the real car. A polybagged and simpler version of the Metropolitan was also made for the retail toy market. A more conventional promo line by Hubley were the full-size Ford wagon and sedan series starting in 1960, a niche not covered by AMT. The 1960 Ford wagon, molded in powder blue, was apparently a contract wrestled away from PMC which had the Country Wagon and Ranchero contract for 1959. Hubley continued offering a full-size Ford wagon and sedan for the 1961 model year, but apparently only made a wagon for 1962. Hubley's promotional offerings could have been the arrow that killed PMC as a promotional producer, since PMC's 1959 models were its last.|$|R
