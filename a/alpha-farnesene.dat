40|$|Fruit body {{development}} is a particular phase of the Tuber life cycle, characterised by the aggregation {{of different types of}} hyphae, i. e., vegetative hyphal cells and highly specialised reproductive hyphae (asci). In order to identify the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) produced in different stages of the Tuber borchii ripening fruit body, solid-phase microextraction with gas chromatography and mass spectrometry was used. The volatile organic compounds were extracted using a DVB/CAR/PDMS 50 / 30 mum fiber placed for 10 min at room temperature in the truffle headspace. The results obtained reveal 49 compounds each of which was present only in a particular stage of maturation. 1 -octen- 3 -ol, aromadendrene, <b>alpha-farnesene</b> and other terpenoid compounds were of particular interest, and their possible biological roles are discussed. The production of aromadendrene in the completely unripe fruit body suggests the existence of communication events in the early stage of ascomata formation between the fungus and the host plant. <b>alpha-Farnesene</b> could represent a chemotactic attractant to saprophytic organisms in order to disperse the fungal spores in the environment. The identification of the VOCs produced by truffles during their maturation could give information about the processes underlying this phase of Tuber life cycle...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1981 Ovipositional {{behavior}} of the codling moth, Laspeyresia pomonella (L.), on several varieties of apples and pears grown in the Pacific Northwest was investigated during the spring/summer of 1979. Field studies showed that {{early in the season}} more eggs were laid on the Bosc variety than on several other apple and pear varieties. The number of eggs laid on all varieties, except the early ripening Gravenstein, increased as the season progressed. Additional investigations showed that significantly fewer eggs were laid on cultivars tested after their normal harvest periods. It was suggested that volatiles associated with fruit ripening, such as ethylene, may act as oviposition inhibitors. The location of eggs on apple and pear cultivars was also investigated. It was found that on apples more eggs were laid on the upper-leaf surface than the lower-leaf surface, while on pears the "preference" was reversed. This difference was probably due to the moths avoidance of the more pubescent under-side of apple leaves. The percentage of eggs laid on apple and pear fruits did not change significantly throughout the season. Contrary to previous reports, codling moths were found to "prefer" pear cultivars to apple cultivars when given a choice between the two. This "preference" was seen late in the season but not early in the season, indicating that it was a result of factors associated with the seasonal growth of the plants. Additional data suggested that it was a result of physical, as well as chemical, factors. Levels of the known colding moth oviposition stimulant, <b>alpha-farnesene,</b> present in the epicuticular wax of apple and pear fruits, were determined twice during the season for each variety. The total amount per fruit and per unit area of skin was greater for all four pear varieties than the five apple varieties. On all cultivars, the total amount of <b>alpha-farnesene</b> on individual fruits increased with increasing fruit size. However, the amount of the sesquiterpene per cmÂ² of fruit skin decreased from early to late season. Varietal differences in the concentrations of <b>alpha-farnesene</b> were positively related to differences in total oviposition per female on apple and pear cultivars...|$|E

40|$|The {{flavor and}} taste of fruits are often {{determined}} by terpenes. We identified three cDNAs encoding putative terpene synthases from olive fruits of cv. Frantoio and Grignano. Heterologous expression in a bacterial system demonstrated {{that one of}} the terpene synthases, OeGES 1, was an active monoterpene synthase that converted geranyl diphosphate to the monoterpene alcohol geraniol. The transcript accumulation pattern of this gene showed a peak during fruit ripening in both genotypes, indicating that the enzyme may be involved in the production of monoterpene flavor compounds in olive fruit. Although the putative terpene synthases OeTPS 2 and OeTPS 3 clustered with <b>alpha-farnesene</b> synthases and angiosperm monoterpene synthases, no detectable in vitro activity was found after expression in a bacterial system.

Both tree species were studied for seasonal variability of BVOC emission rates under natural biotic stress (infestations). Emissions were normalized at standard conditions of temperature and photosynthetic active radiation (PAR) (30 degrees C and 1000 mu mol m(- 2) s(- 1), respectively). Emission rates from Fraxinus excelsior were highest in May (9. 56 mu g g(DW) (- 1) h(- 1)) and lowest in October (1. 17 mu g g(DW) (- 1) h(- 1)). This tree species emitted (Z) -beta-ocimene, (E) -beta-ocimene and <b>alpha-farnesene</b> during the entire measurement period and additionally isoprene only in May.

40|$|AbstractIn {{the present}} study, in vitro anticariogenic {{potential}} of ethyl acetate, hexane and methanol and aqueous extracts {{of plant leaves}} of Eucalyptus globules Labill. were evaluated by using four cariogenic bacteria, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus mutans. Agar well diffusion method and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) were used for this purpose. The ethyl acetate extracted fraction of plant leaves showed good inhibitory effects against all selected bacteria. In Eucalyptus globules, hexane and ethyl acetate extracts found highly effective against, Lactobacillus acidophilus with MIC value of 0. 031 and 0. 062 mg/mL, respectively. Qualitative phytochemical investigation of above extracts showed the presence of alkaloids, phenolic compounds, steroids, cardiac glycosides and terpenes. Based on the MIC value and bioautography, ethyl acetate of plant leaf was selected for further study. Further investigation on the structure elucidation of the bioactive compound using IR, GC-MS and NMR techniques revealed the presence of <b>alpha-farnesene,</b> a sesquiterpene.

40|$|Twenty-five {{strains of}} Fusarium sambucinum grown on wheat kernels were {{examined}} for trichothecene {{production and the}} synthesis of volatile sesquiterpenes. The volatiles were purged with air and collected on Tenax traps. Adsorbed compounds were eluted from the traps and injected into a gas chromatograph coupled with a mass spectrometer. Ten strains isolated from potato tubers produced high amounts of diacetoxyscirpenol and its derivatives. These strains were characterized by the production of high amounts of diverse sesquiterpenes. In 10 cultures, 19 compounds were detected, of which 6 were predominant and composed as much as 82 % of the volatile sesquiterpene fraction (e. g., beta-farnesene, beta-chamigrene, beta-bisabolene, <b>alpha-farnesene,</b> trichodiene, and an unidentified compound). Fifteen strains isolated from various sources that did not produce trichothecenes produced much less volatile sesquiterpenes, with less chemical diversity. No more than six compounds were present in cultures. Two of these compounds {{were present in the}} toxigenic strains isolated from potatoes (beta-farnesene and acoradiene), but four were unique to the strains not producing trichothecenes (longifolene, isocaryophyllene, delta-elemene, and an unidentified one).

40|$|Different spectroscopic {{techniques}} {{based on}} infrared and Raman {{were used to}} evaluate the natural wax and related surface quality of apple fruit. Transmission near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy was applied to solutions of single wax components and extracted apple wax, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was used for transmission measurements of wax films on NaCl crystals, diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRIFTS) was used to analyze wax powders, and FT-Raman spectroscopy was explored to examine intact wax layers on whole fruit. The natural wax layers of apple fruit from a maximum of three different cultivars (Jonagold, Jonagored, and Elshof) from three picking dates (early, commercial, and late), three controlled atmosphere storage durations (0, 4, and 8 months), and three shelf life periods (0, 1, and 2 weeks) within each storage duration were examined. Canonical discriminant analysis was carried out on the first derivative NIR and FTIR spectra to describe the information contained in the spectra. Discrimination between cultivars and between storage duration based on wax layer properties was achieved with reasonable accuracy from both of the techniques. Information contained in the spectra of apples from different picking dates and shelf life periods was not significant. Differences between cultivars and storage periods in this analysis mostly related to differences in the number of aliphatic chains (e. g., alkanes and esters) and the presence of <b>alpha-farnesene.</b> No satisfactory results were obtained by means of Raman spectroscopy and DRIFTS. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|By {{naturally}} occurring gene-transformation Ri-plasmids of Agrobacterium rhizogenes have been {{integrated into the}} plant genome of Chamomillo recutita, thereby inducing the formation of hairy roots. Clones with the best biosynthetic potential were multiplied for phytochemical investigations. The amounts of terpenoid and polyene compounds in the genetically transformed cultures were compared with those in in-vivo plants. In Hungary a wild chamomile population was found which contained significant amount of (-) -alpha-bisabolol in the oil from the inflorescence. We used biotechnological methods to preserve the genome of this wild type. Transformed chamomile root cultures were obtained by infection of sterile organized cultures with Agrobacterium rhizogenes strains #A- 4,# 15834, and #R- 1601. Hairy roots freed from bacteria were cultivated on solid medium and then in liquid, hormone-free, B 5 and MS media. The qualitative and quantitative composition of the essential oil was examined by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. The volatile compounds were identified by comparing their retention times with those of authentic standards and of essential oils of known composition, and by peak enrichment. Confirmation of identity was achieved by comparison of mass spectra with those {{reported in the literature}} and those of reference compounds. The amount of each component {{as a percentage of the}} total was determined by area normalization. GC and GC-MS studies showed that genetically transformed chamomile cultures generated the terpenoid and polyene compounds most characteristic of the parent plant. The main components of hairy root cultures were trans-beta-farnesene, <b>alpha-farnesene,</b> geranyl isovalerate, and cedrol.

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{identify}} physiological markers in superficially scalded 'Rocha' pear (Pyrus communis L 'Rocha') that would relate to chlorophyll a fluorescence (CF), allowing a non-invasive {{diagnosis of the}} disorder. Conditions chosen before shelf life provided two fruit groups with different developing patterns and severity of superficial scald: T fruit fully developed the disorder in storage, while C fruit developed it progressively throughout shelf life. Principal component analysis (PCA) of all the measured variables, and simple linear correlations among several major parameters and scald index (SI) /shelf life showed that scald and ripening/aging were concurring processes, {{and that it was}} not possible to isolate a particular variable that could deliver a direct non-invasive diagnosis of the disorder. For both fruit groups the SI resulted from the balance between the reducing power (OD 200) and the content of conjugated trienols (CTos) and <b>alpha-farnesene</b> (alpha-Farn) in the fruit peel. At OD 200 > 150 there was a linear relationship between CTos and OD 200, suggesting that the level of antioxidants was self-adjusted in order to compensate the CTos level. However, at OD 200 < 150 this relationship disappeared. A consistent linear relationship between dos and alpha-Farn existed throughout shelf life in both fruit groups, contrarily to the early storage stage, when those compounds do not relate linearly. The CF variables F- 0, F-v/F-m, and the colorimetric variables, L* and h degrees were used in multi-linear regressions with other physiological variables. The regressions were made on one of the fruit groups and validated through the other. Reliable regressions to alpha-Farn and CTos were obtained (R approximate to 0. 6; rmsec approximate to rmsep). Our results suggest that a model based on CF and colorimetric parameters could be used to diagnose non-invasively both the contents and the relationship between alpha-Farn and CTos and hence the stage of scald development.

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} test whether the {{chlorophyll}} a (Chla) fluorescence determined by a low-cost non-modulated fluorometer could provide fast, reliable and non-invasive estimators of superficial scald in 'Rocha' pear (Pyrus communis L. 'Rocha'). Fruit were harvested before the optimal maturation stage and cold stored under normal atmosphere for 7 months (NA: 0 degrees C, 90 - 95 % RH) and 2 in controlled atmosphere (CA: 0 degrees C, 90 - 95 % RH, 1. 5 kPaO(2) + 0. 5 kPa CO 2) (T), or harvested at the optimal maturation stage and cold stored for 9 months under CA (C). Then, they were transferred to shelf-life conditions (22 +/- 2 degrees C, 70 % RH) and followed for 7 d. Chla fluorescence, scald index (SI), ripening attributes, <b>alpha-farnesene,</b> conjugated trienols, and photosynthetic pigments were determined for each pear in both groups. Conditions chosen before shelf-life did not prevent the subsequent ripening of any fruit, but changed dramatically the superficial scald development pattern: in C fruit, the disorder developed progressively during shelf-life, whereas in T fruit, it peaked during storage. C fruit exhibited a significant negative correlation (R=- 0. 65; p< 0. 05) between Fv/Fm and scald development, but not with ripening (R=- 0. 15; p< 0. 05). As expected, the opposite was observed in T fruit, in which only a low, positive, yet significant correlation was found between Fv/Fm and ripening (R= 0. 44; p< 0. 05). The multiple regression approach using Fv/Fm and other Chla fluorescence parameters produced an equation from which we calculated the 'predicted' scald index in C fruit. This correlated clearly (R= 0. 73; p< 0. 05) with the real values visually assessed. If color values a*, b* and Hue were included in this multiple regression, the correlation was significantly enhanced (0. 91; p< 0. 05). Although preliminary, {{this study has shown}} that basic Chla fluorescence parameters are valuable estimators of superficial scald in 'Rocha' pear and might be used in the early detection of the disorder...|$|E
40|$|Current {{monitoring}} {{methods for}} walnut husk flies (WHFs), Rhagoletis completa Cresson, (Diptera: Tephritidae), a major pest of commercial walnuts, are ineffective at predicting {{the onset of}} damage, since the initiation of oviposition is determined by walnut phenology, and not fly population levels. The {{purpose of this study}} was to initiate the development of a new monitoring lure for WHFs by identifying walnut leaf volatiles that are kairomonally attractive to WHFs. One laboratory and three field experiments were undertaken to test the hypothesis that walnut volatiles are selectively attractive to the flies. Laboratory electroantennogram (EAG) experiments were performed to record WHF responses to three groups of volatile compounds: seven monoterpenes and four sesquiterpenes found in walnut leaves and husks, and nine aliphatic green leaf volatiles. The aliphatic compounds elicited the largest EAG responses, with 8 of 9 of the aliphatics ranked in the top 10 of 21 compounds tested. The monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes elicited weaker absolute EAG responses, but in relation to their lower volatility, they were assessed as strong EAG stimulants. Our interpretation of the EAG results suggested that monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes should be included in field attractancy tests. A blend of monoterpenes and a blend of sesquiterpenes, similar in proportions to walnut leaf headspace concentrations, were field tested, with both blends being significantly more attractive than the control. The second field experiment was conducted to elucidate which components of a previously suggested male WHF attractant, angelica seed oil (ASOil) (Angelica archangelica), are attractive. Distilled fractions of ASOil, along with crude ASOil were tested. Only one fraction was significantly attractive, a fraction composed predominantly of sesquiterpenes high in both alphacopaene (a known medfly, Ceratitis capitata, attractant) and caryophyllene, a sesquiterpene found in walnut headspace. The final set of field experiments tested individual walnut headspace sesquiterpenes (caryophyllene, beta-farnesene, <b>alpha-farnesene</b> and germacrene D) and the one attractive ASOil fraction. Caryophyllene, a common plant volatile, was more attractive than any other test lure, including germacrene D, a more walnut-specific volatile. This is the first report of a host-plant based volatile attractant for WHFs. The attractant, caryophyllene, captured primarily male WHFs (approximately 3 : 1, male:female). The impact of these studies may lead to a new WHF monitoring tool that might be predictive of the onset of walnut damage by ovipositing females. The lead-time provided by a predictive lure will help walnut growers reduce WHF damage by accurately timing their spray applications, thus treating their orchards less often, and with less adverse environmental impact...|$|E
