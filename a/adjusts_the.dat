5|$|Halo Wars is a {{real-time}} strategy (RTS) {{video game}} developed {{exclusively for the}} Xbox 360 console, in which players command armies from a bird's-eye view of the battlefield. The game focuses on military combat, but contains streamlined resource management and base construction elements. It was designed with the Xbox 360 controller in mind; for example, the A button is used for selecting units. A single tap of the button selects one unit, while a double tap selects all units of the same type. The d-pad navigates to current battles and cycles through bases, while the right analog stick <b>adjusts</b> <b>the</b> camera angle. A radial menu is used for base construction.|$|E
5|$|Next is {{the short}} barrel; {{this part of}} the {{instrument}} may be extended to fine-tune the clarinet. As the pitch of the clarinet is fairly temperature-sensitive, some instruments have interchangeable barrels whose lengths vary slightly. Additional compensation for pitch variation and tuning can be made by pulling out the barrel and thus increasing the instrument's length, particularly common in group playing in which clarinets are tuned to other instruments (such as in an orchestra or concert band). Some performers use a plastic barrel with a thumbwheel that <b>adjusts</b> <b>the</b> barrel length. On basset horns and lower clarinets, the barrel is normally replaced by a curved metal neck.|$|E
5|$|The Odyssey {{is capable}} of {{displaying}} three square dots and a vertical line on the screen. Two of the dots are controlled by the two players, and the third by the system itself. The main console has two dials, one of which moves the vertical line across the screen, and one which <b>adjusts</b> <b>the</b> speed of the computer-controlled dot. Different games direct the player to adjust the dials to different positions, for example to change the center line of a tennis game into the side wall of a handball game. The games include plastic overlays which stick to the television via static cling, to create visuals for the game. Different games that use the same game card can have different overlays, which can change a game with the same controls from, for example, a mountain ski path to a movement-based Simon Says game.|$|E
30|$|Sensitivity {{refers to}} the number of times that the system could {{automatically}} <b>adjust</b> <b>the</b> application volume on out of the number of times <b>the</b> user manually <b>adjusted</b> <b>the</b> application volume on (i.e., how much the system could estimate the application volume on). Specificity {{refers to the}} number of times that the system could automatically <b>adjust</b> <b>the</b> application volume off out of the number of times that <b>the</b> user manually <b>adjusted</b> <b>the</b> application volume off (i.e., how much the system could estimate the application volume off). Positive Predictive Value (PPV) refers {{to the number of}} times that the user wanted to <b>adjust</b> <b>the</b> application volume on out of the number of times that <b>the</b> system automatically <b>adjusted</b> application volume off (i.e., the rate of correct estimation of application volume on versus <b>adjusted</b> by <b>the</b> system). Negative Predictive Value (NPV) refers to the number of times that the user wanted to <b>adjust</b> <b>the</b> application volume off out of the number of times that <b>the</b> system automatically <b>adjusted</b> <b>the</b> application volume off (i.e., the rate of correct estimation the application volume off versus <b>adjusted</b> by <b>the</b> system). Accuracy refers to the rate of correct estimation of all. The higher the sensitivity, the fewer times the user needs to <b>adjust</b> <b>the</b> application volume on. The higher the specificity, the fewer times the user needs to <b>adjust</b> <b>the</b> application volume off.|$|R

5|$|Typically, the {{equipment}} used for SMAW {{consists of a}} step-down transformer and for direct current models a rectifier, which converts alternating current into direct current. Because the power normally supplied to the welding machine is high-voltage alternating current, the welding transformer is used to reduce the voltage and increase the current. As a result, instead of 220 V at 50 A, for example, the power supplied by the transformer is around 17–45V at currents up to 600A. A number {{of different types of}} transformers can be used to produce this effect, including multiple coil and inverter machines, with each using a different method to manipulate the welding current. The multiple coil type <b>adjusts</b> <b>the</b> current by either varying the number of turns in the coil (in tap-type transformers) or by varying the distance between the primary and secondary coils (in movable coil or movable core transformers). Inverters, which are smaller and thus more portable, use electronic components to change the current characteristics.|$|E

50|$|Prior to autoclaving, some labs <b>adjust</b> <b>the</b> pH of LB to 7.5 or 8 with sodium {{hydroxide}}. However {{sodium hydroxide}} {{does not provide}} any buffering capacity to the media, and this results in rapid changes to the pH during bacteria cultivation.To get around this some labs prefer to <b>adjust</b> <b>the</b> pH with 5-10 mmol/L TRIS buffer, diluted from 1 mol/l TRIS stock at the desired pH. However, it is not absolutely necessary to <b>adjust</b> <b>the</b> pH for most situations. Some labs <b>adjust</b> <b>the</b> pH to 7.0 merely as a precaution.|$|R

50|$|Since the {{beginning}} the Iron Cobra {{was known for}} adjustability. Through all the generations, the pedal has had <b>the</b> ability to <b>adjust</b> <b>the</b> footboard angle independently of the beater shaft angle, <b>adjust</b> <b>the</b> beater head angle, <b>adjust</b> <b>the</b> hoop clamp size, <b>adjust</b> <b>the</b> beater shaft length, <b>adjust</b> <b>the</b> feel of the beater with a sliding weight, and <b>adjust</b> <b>the</b> spring tension. Not all of these adjustments are universally possible on all other pedals from other manufacturers. The cam shape is not adjustable on the Iron Cobra, except on the third gen. duo-glide model, but the pedal has historically been offered with two different optional cams. The rolling-glide cam is round for a smooth action, while the powerglide cam changes radius mid-stroke for more acceleration. While most of the Iron Cobra pedals are double chain drive, the flexi-glide version has a kevlar strap drive. Since at least the second generation, the pedals have come with a hard plastic carrying case.|$|R

25|$|Control {{engineers}} often utilize feedback when designing control systems. For example, in {{an automobile}} with cruise control the vehicle's speed is continuously monitored and fed back to the system which <b>adjusts</b> <b>the</b> motor's power output accordingly.

25|$|Nevertheless, in {{the modern}} fully quantum {{treatment}} in phase space, the proper deformation (careful full extension) of the semi-classical result <b>adjusts</b> <b>the</b> angular momentum value to the correct effective one. As a consequence, the physical ground state expression is obtained through a shift of the vanishing quantum angular momentum expression, which corresponds to spherical symmetry.|$|E

25|$|Earnshaw's theorem {{shows that}} no {{combination}} of static magnets {{can be in}} a stable equilibrium. Therefore a dynamic (time varying) magnetic field is required to achieve stabilization. EMS systems rely on active electronic stabilization that constantly measures the bearing distance and <b>adjusts</b> <b>the</b> electromagnet current accordingly. EDS systems rely on changing magnetic fields to create currents, which can give passive stability.|$|E
25|$|Tim Noakes, {{based on}} an earlier idea by the 1922 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine winner Archibald Hill has {{proposed}} {{the existence of a}} central governor. In this, the brain continuously <b>adjusts</b> <b>the</b> power output by muscles during exercise in regard to a safe level of exertion. These neural calculations factor in prior length of strenuous exercise, the planned duration of further exertion, and the present metabolic state of the body. This <b>adjusts</b> <b>the</b> number of activated skeletal muscle motor units, and is subjectively experienced as fatigue and exhaustion. The idea of a central governor rejects the earlier idea that fatigue is only caused by mechanical failure of the exercising muscles ("peripheral fatigue"). Instead, the brain models the metabolic limits of the body to ensure that whole body homeostasis is protected, in particular that the heart is guarded from hypoxia, and an emergency reserve is always maintained. The idea of the central governor has been questioned since ‘physiological catastrophes’ can and do occur suggesting athletes (such as Dorando Pietri, Jim Peters and Gabriela Andersen-Schiess) can over-ride the ‘‘central governor’.|$|E

All of the dining establishments on campus use fair trade coffee, recycled napkins, and are required to recycle and compost.|$|E
25|$|A {{relatively}} {{new technology is}} the electronically controlled 'active differential'. An electronic control unit (ECU) uses inputs from multiple sensors, including yaw rate, steering input angle, and lateral acceleration—and <b>adjusts</b> <b>the</b> distribution of torque to compensate for undesirable handling behaviours like understeer. Active differentials used to play {{a large role in}} the World Rally Championship, but in the 2006 season the FIA has limited the use of active differentials to only those drivers who have not competed in the World Rally Championship in the last five years.|$|E
25|$|Baroreceptor reflex: Baroreceptors in {{the high}} {{pressure}} receptor zones detect changes in arterial pressure. These baroreceptors send signals ultimately to the medulla of the brain stem, specifically to the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM). The medulla, {{by way of the}} autonomic nervous system, <b>adjusts</b> <b>the</b> mean arterial pressure by altering both the force and speed of the heart's contractions, as well as the systemic vascular resistance. The most important arterial baroreceptors are located in the left and right carotid sinuses and in the aortic arch.|$|E
