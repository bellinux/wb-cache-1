2500|$|With {{the legal}} system of the U.S. based on common law, motivations for {{lawsuits}} can range from legitimate legal grounds to cases filed {{with the intent of}} shaping case law to favor the socio-political aims of special interest groups. [...] Clubs <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>have</b> personnel and clientele that are purported to engage in not only sex acts on the premises, but also drug use and other criminalized activities. Incidents of such activity vary widely. Their prevalence is dependent on regional differences in the attitudes of management, entertainers, customers, and law enforcement. Strip clubs are obligated to enforce age limits for entry to the clubs and consumption of alcohol. If a club is found to have served a person under the age of 21 alcohol it can have its liquor license suspended or rescinded for repeated violations. Licenses can also be lost due to evidence of drug use in the club. Club owners have closed their businesses as a result of losing a liquor license.|$|E

He argues for putting citations in footnotes while noting in-text information that is important but non-bibliographic. He opposes references such as [...] "457 U.S. 423, 432, 102 S.Ct. 2515, 2521, 89 L.Ed.2d 744, 747" [...] as interruptions {{in the middle of a}} line. To this day, however, such interruptions in judges' opinions and in lawyers' briefs remain the norm. Some courts and advocates <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>have</b> begun adopting Garner's recommended style of footnoted citations, and a surprising degree of internal strife has resulted within some organizations. For example, one appellate judge in Louisiana refused to join in a colleague's opinions written in the new format. Garner says that one of the main reasons for the reform is to make legal writing more comprehensible to readers who lack a legal education. But he has attracted vehement opposition, most notably from Judge Richard A. Posner of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, and from his co-author, Justice Antonin Scalia.|$|E
2500|$|This legend, which {{surfaced}} on the Internet just in {{time for}} Halloween in October 2004, claimed that drug dealers were giving lollipops laced with drugs, typically a combination of THC and PCP, to unsuspecting children and causing them great harm. [...] Such suckers are allegedly referred to as [...] "dro pops" [...] or something to that effect, and various towns <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>have</b> had their own versions of the legend. [...] According to the U.S. DEA, suckers containing THC and/or PCP have been found and confiscated in Chicago in the spring of 2004. [...] They also report that in 2003 and 2004 some psilocybin mushroom chocolate candies were seized near Amarillo, Texas, and that hollowed-out lollipops filled with heroin have been seized in New York City. The goal of doing so was likely to evade detection by law enforcement by disguising the drugs as candy. There is no evidence that these were ever given to children, much less that any such children were harmed, or even that such lollipops have been found outside of these specific locations or anywhere since early 2004. Thus, this legend can be considered to be in a similar vein as the infamous blue star tattoo legend.|$|E
