25|$|<b>Aripiprazole</b> is a {{substrate}} of CYP2D6 and CYP3A4. Coadministration with {{medications that}} inhibit (e.g. paroxetine, fluoxetine) or induce (e.g. carbamazepine) these metabolic enzymes {{are known to}} increase and decrease, respectively, plasma levels of <b>aripiprazole.</b> As such, anyone taking <b>aripiprazole</b> {{should be aware that}} their dosage of <b>aripiprazole</b> may need to be adjusted.|$|E
25|$|<b>Aripiprazole</b> is an {{effective}} add-on treatment for major depressive disorder; however, {{there is a greater}} rate of side effects such as weight gain and movement disorders. The overall benefit is small to moderate and its use appears to neither improve quality of life nor functioning. <b>Aripiprazole</b> may interact with some antidepressants, especially SSRIs. There are interactions with fluoxetine and paroxetine and lesser interactions with sertraline, escitalopram, citalopram and fluvoxamine, which inhibit CYP2D6, for which <b>aripiprazole</b> is a substrate. CYP2D6 inhibitors increase <b>aripiprazole</b> concentrations to 2-3 times their normal level.|$|E
25|$|A Cochrane review {{comparing}} <b>aripiprazole</b> with placebo {{concluded that}} high dropout rates in clinical trials, {{and a lack}} of outcome data regarding general functioning, behavior, mortality, economic outcomes, or cognitive functioning make it difficult to definitively conclude that <b>aripiprazole</b> is useful for the prevention of relapse. The World Federation of Societies for Biological Psychiatry recommends <b>aripiprazole</b> for the treatment of acute exacerbations of schizophrenia as a Grade 1 recommendation and evidence level A.|$|E
25|$|<b>Aripiprazole</b> acts by {{modulating}} neurotransmission overactivity on the dopaminergic mesolimbic pathway, {{which is}} thought to be the cause of positive schizophrenia symptoms. Due to its agonist activity on D2 receptors, <b>aripiprazole</b> may also increase dopaminergic activity to optimal levels in the mesocortical pathways where it is reduced.|$|E
25|$|<b>Aripiprazole</b> is also {{a partial}} agonist of the {{serotonin}} 5-HT1A receptor (intrinsic activity = 68%). It is a very weak partial agonist of the 5-HT2A receptor (intrinsic activity = 12.7%), and like other atypical antipsychotics, displays a functional antagonist profile at this receptor. The drug differs from other atypical antipsychotics in having higher affinity for the D2 receptor than for the 5-HT2A receptor. At the 5-HT2B receptor, <b>aripiprazole</b> acts as a potent inverse agonist. Unlike other antipsychotics, <b>aripiprazole</b> is a high-efficacy partial agonist of the 5-HT2C receptor (intrinsic activity = 82%) and with relatively weak affinity; this property may underlie the minimal weight gain seen {{in the course of}} therapy. At the 5-HT7 receptor, <b>aripiprazole</b> is a very weak partial agonist with barely measurable intrinsic activity, and hence is a functional antagonist of this receptor. <b>Aripiprazole</b> also shows lower but likely clinically insignificant affinity for a number of other sites, such as the histamine H1, α-adrenergic, and dopamine D4 receptors as well as the serotonin transporter, while it has negligible affinity for the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors.|$|E
25|$|Wood and Reavill (2007) {{reviewed}} {{published and}} unpublished data and proposed that <b>aripiprazole</b> may act essentially as a selective D2 receptor partial agonist without significantly affecting {{most of the}} serotonin receptors at therapeutically relevant doses. A positron emission tomography imaging study found that 10 to 30mg/day <b>aripiprazole</b> resulted in 85 to 93% occupancy of the D2 receptor in various brain areas (putamen, caudate, ventral striatum) versus 54 to 60% occupancy of the 5-HT2A receptor and only 16% occupancy of the 5-HT1A receptor. It {{has been suggested that}} the low occupancy of the 5-HT1A receptor by <b>aripiprazole</b> may have been an erroneous measurement however.|$|E
25|$|Both {{risperidone}} and <b>aripiprazole</b> {{have received}} FDA labelling for autism.|$|E
25|$|<b>Aripiprazole</b> {{is also a}} mild partial agonist of 5HT2C receptor.|$|E
25|$|<b>Aripiprazole</b> is {{primarily}} {{used for the}} treatment of schizophrenia or bipolar disorder.|$|E
25|$|<b>Aripiprazole</b> is a phenylpiperazine and is {{chemically}} {{related to}} nefazodone, etoperidone, and trazodone.|$|E
25|$|In 2007, <b>aripiprazole</b> was {{approved}} by the FDA for the treatment of unipolar depression when used adjunctively with an antidepressant medication. That same year, BMS settled a case with the U.S. government in which it paid $515 million; the case covered several drugs but the focus was on BMS's off-label marketing of <b>aripiprazole</b> for children and older people with dementia.|$|E
25|$|<b>Aripiprazole</b> {{displays}} linear kinetics {{and has an}} elimination half-life {{of approximately}} 75hours. Steady-state plasma concentrations are achieved in about 14days. Cmax (maximum plasma concentration) is achieved 3–5hours after oral dosing. Bioavailability of the oral tablets is about 90% and the drug undergoes extensive hepatic metabolization (dehydrogenation, hydroxylation, and N-dealkylation), principally by the enzymes CYP2D6 and CYP3A4. Its only known active metabolite is dehydro-aripiprazole, which typically accumulates to approximately 40% of the <b>aripiprazole</b> concentration. The parenteral drug is excreted only in traces, and its metabolites, active or not, are excreted via feces and urine. When dosed daily, brain concentrations of <b>aripiprazole</b> will increase {{for a period of}} 10–14days, before reaching stable constant levels.|$|E
25|$|An {{antipsychotic}} {{combined with}} an antidepressant, particularly atypical antipsychotics such as <b>aripiprazole</b> (Abilify), quetiapine (Seroquel), olanzapine (Zyprexa), and risperidone (Risperdal).|$|E
25|$|For {{the purpose}} of D2 blockage, <b>aripiprazole,</b> a partial agonist on D2 {{receptor}} site, {{should not be used}} with a full antagonist.|$|E
25|$|Olanzapine is {{considered}} moderately toxic in overdose; more toxic than quetiapine, <b>aripiprazole</b> and the SSRIs and less toxic than the MAOIs and TCAs.|$|E
25|$|<b>Aripiprazole</b> {{has been}} {{approved}} by the FDA for the treatment of acute manic and mixed episodes, in both pediatric patients aged 10–17 and in adults.|$|E
25|$|A 2015 {{systematic}} review of add-on therapies for treatment-resistant depression concluded that quetiapine and <b>aripiprazole</b> have the strongest evidence-base supporting their efficacy, {{but they are}} associated with additional treatment-related side effects when used as an add-on therapy.|$|E
25|$|Only <b>aripiprazole,</b> olanzapine, and {{quetiapine}} have specifically {{been approved}} for MDD by the FDA in the United States. Quetiapine and lurasidone have been approved, as monotherapies, for bipolar depression, but as of present, lurasidone has not {{been approved for}} MDD.|$|E
25|$|It is {{a partial}} {{dopamine}} agonist. <b>Aripiprazole</b> {{was developed by}} Otsuka in Japan. In the United States, Otsuka America markets it jointly with Bristol-Myers Squibb. From April 2013 to March 2014, sales of Abilify amounted to almost $6.9 billion.|$|E
25|$|Aripiprazole's {{mechanism}} of action is {{different from those of}} the other FDA-approved atypical antipsychotics (e.g., clozapine, olanzapine, quetiapine, ziprasidone, and risperidone)., D3, and D4 Dopamine Receptors: Identification of the Clozapine Metabolite N-Desmethylclozapine as a D2/D3 Partial Agonist| journal = The Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics | volume = 315 | issue = 3 | pages = 1278–87 | date = December 2005 | pmid = 16135699 | doi = 10.1124/jpet.105.092155 }} Rather than acting as a pure antagonist of the dopamine D2 receptor, <b>aripiprazole</b> shows functional selectivity at the D2 receptor, acting as a silent antagonist of some subpopulations of D2 receptors but as a high-efficacy partial agonist (intrinsic activity = 75%) of other D2-receptor subpopulations. It appears to show predominantly antagonist activity on postsynaptic D2 receptors and partial agonist activity on presynaptic D2 receptors. <b>Aripiprazole</b> is also a partial agonist of the D3 receptor. In healthy human volunteers, D2 and D3 receptor occupancy levels are high, with average levels ranging between approximately 71% at 2mg/day to approximately 96% at 40mg/day. Most atypical antipsychotics bind preferentially to extrastriatal receptors, but <b>aripiprazole</b> appears to be less preferential in this regard, as binding rates are high throughout the brain.|$|E
25|$|Risperidone is {{effective}} in treating the acute exacerbations of schizophrenia. A 2013 study compared 15 antipsychotic drugs in treating schizophrenia. Risperidone was ranked fourth, 11% more effective than paliperidone (5th), 20-23% more effective than haloperidol, quetiapine, and <b>aripiprazole,</b> and 36% less effective than clozapine (1st).|$|E
25|$|In a 2013 {{study in}} a {{comparison}} of 15 antipsychotic drugs in effectiveness in treating schizophrenic symptoms, clozapine was ranked first, demonstrating very high effectiveness. 25% more effective than amisulpride (2nd), 33% more effective than olanzapine (3rd), and twice as effective as haloperidol, quetiapine, and <b>aripiprazole.</b>|$|E
25|$|A 2014 {{systematic}} review concluded that add-on therapy with low dose <b>aripiprazole</b> {{is an effective}} treatment for obsessive-compulsive disorder that does not improve with SSRIs alone. The conclusion {{was based on the}} results of two relatively small, short-term trials, each of which demonstrated improvements in symptoms.|$|E
25|$|Children or {{adults who}} {{ingested}} acute overdoses have usually manifested {{central nervous system}} depression ranging from mild sedation to coma; serum concentrations of <b>aripiprazole</b> and dehydroaripiprazole in these patients were elevated by up to 3-4 fold over normal therapeutic levels, yet to date no deaths have been recorded.|$|E
25|$|Urine drug screens {{are used}} to test for {{recreational}} drug use. There are case reports of 2 children accidentally ingesting large quantities of <b>aripiprazole</b> and subsequently testing positive for amphetamines on urine drug screens; both children then had gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis sent on their blood and urine that were negative for amphetamines.|$|E
25|$|A Cochrane review {{concluded}} that <b>aripiprazole</b> {{is similar to}} other typical and atypical antipsychotics with respect to benefit. Compared to typical antipsychotics, there are fewer extrapyramidal side effects, but higher rates of dizziness. With respect to other atypicals, {{it is difficult to}} determine differences in adverse effects as data quality is poor.|$|E
25|$|Otsuka's U.S. {{patent on}} <b>aripiprazole</b> expired on October 20, 2014 {{but due to}} a {{pediatric}} extension, a generic did not become available until April 20, 2015. Barr Laboratories (now Teva Pharmaceuticals) initiated a patent challenge under the Hatch-Waxman Act in March 2007. On November 15, 2010, this challenge {{was rejected by the}} U.S. District Court in New Jersey.|$|E
25|$|The acute {{treatment}} of a manic episode of bipolar disorder involves the utilization of either a mood stabilizer (valproate, lithium, or carbamazepine) or an atypical antipsychotic (olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, or <b>aripiprazole).</b> Although hypomanic episodes may respond to a mood stabilizer alone, full-blown episodes are treated with an atypical antipsychotic (often {{in conjunction with a}} mood stabilizer, as these tend to produce the most rapid improvement).|$|E
25|$|A {{comparative}} {{meta-analysis of}} 12 major antidepressants found that venlafaxine, mirtazapine, escitalopram, and sertraline {{were significantly more}} efficacious than duloxetine, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, and reboxetine. A combination of venlafaxine and mirtazapine achieved remission rates (defined as a HAM-D score of 7 or less) of 58% in one controlled trial. In combination with an antipsychotic medicine <b>aripiprazole,</b> better results in treatment resistant depression in older adults have been demonstrated.|$|E
25|$|The {{introduction}} of clozapine (Clozaril) represents {{a breakthrough in}} the treatment of psychotic symptoms of PD. Prior to its introduction, treatment of psychotic symptoms relied on reduction of dopamine therapy or treatment with first generation antipsychotics, all of which worsened motor function. Other atypical antipsychotics useful in treatment include quetiapine (Seroquel), ziprasidone (Geodon), <b>aripiprazole</b> (Abilify), and paliperidone (Invega). Clozapine is believed to have the highest efficacy and lowest risk of extrapyramidal side effect.|$|E
25|$|The National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence, the British Association for Psychopharmacology and the World Federation of Societies for Biological Psychiatry {{suggest that}} there is little {{difference}} in effectiveness between antipsychotics in prevention of relapse, and recommend that the specific choice of antipsychotic be chosen based on persons preference and side effect profile. The latter group recommends switching to <b>aripiprazole</b> when excessive weight gain is encountered during treatment with other antipsychotics.|$|E
25|$|A Lancet review {{found that}} it is in the middle range of 15 {{antipsychotics}} for effectiveness, approximately as effective as haloperidol and quetiapine and slightly more effective than ziprasidone and chlorpromazine, with better tolerability compared to the other antipsychotic drugs (4th best for weight gain, 5th best for extrapyramidal symptoms, best for prolactin elevation, 2nd best for QTc prolongation, and 5th best for sedation). The authors concluded that for acute psychotic episodes <b>aripiprazole</b> results in benefits in some aspects of the condition.|$|E
25|$|<b>Aripiprazole,</b> {{sold under}} {{the brand name}} Abilify among others, is an {{atypical}} antipsychotic. It is recommended and primarily used {{in the treatment of}} schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Other uses include as an add-on treatment in major depressive disorder, tic disorders, and irritability associated with autism. According to a Cochrane review, evidence for the oral form in schizophrenia is not sufficient to determine effects on general functioning. Additionally, because many people dropped out of the medication trials before they were completed, the overall strength of the conclusions is low.|$|E
25|$|Escitalopram, {{similarly}} to other SSRIs (with {{the exception of}} fluvoxamine), inhibits CYP2D6 and hence may increase plasma levels {{of a number of}} CYP2D6 substrates such as <b>aripiprazole,</b> risperidone, tramadol, codeine, etc. As much of the effect of codeine is attributable to its conversion (10%) to morphine its effectiveness will be reduced by this inhibition, not enhanced. As escitalopram is only a weak inhibitor of CYP2D6, analgesia from tramadol may not be affected. Escitalopram can also prolong the QT interval and hence it is not recommended in patients that are concurrently on other medications that have the ability to prolong the QT interval. Being a SSRI, escitalopram should not be given concurrently with MAOIs or other serotonergic medications.|$|E
25|$|Other {{drugs are}} {{prescribed}} off-label in the U.S., {{which means they}} have not been approved for treating ASD. Large placebo-controlled studies of olanzapine and <b>aripiprazole</b> were underway in early 2008. <b>Aripiprazole</b> may be effective for treating autism in the short term, but is also associated with side effects, such as weight gain and sedation. Some selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and dopamine blockers can reduce some maladaptive behaviors associated with ASD. Although SSRIs reduce levels of repetitive behavior in autistic adults, a 2009 multisite randomized controlled study found no benefit and some adverse effects in children from the SSRI citalopram, raising doubts whether SSRIs are effective for treating repetitive behavior in autistic children. A further study of related medical reviews determined that the prescription of SSRI antidepressants for treating autistic spectrum disorders in children lacked any evidence, and could not be recommended. One study found that the psychostimulant methylphenidate was efficacious against hyperactivity associated with ASD, though with less response than in neurotypical children with ADHD. Of the many medications studied for treatment of aggressive and self-injurious behavior in children and adolescents with autism, only risperidone and methylphenidate demonstrate results that have been replicated. A 1998 study of the hormone secretin reported improved symptoms and generated tremendous interest, but several controlled studies since have found no benefit. Oxytocin {{may play a role in}} autism and may be an effective treatment for repetitive and affiliative behaviors; two related studies in adults found that oxytocin decreased repetitive behaviors and improved interpretation of emotions, but these preliminary results do not necessarily apply to children. An experimental drug STX107 has stopped overproduction of metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 in rodents, and it has been hypothesized that this may help in about 5% of autism cases, but this hypothesis has not been tested in humans.|$|E
25|$|Recently, {{metabolic}} {{concerns have}} been of grave concern to clinicians, patients and the FDA. In 2003, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) required all manufacturers of atypical antipsychotics to change their labeling to include a warning {{about the risks of}} hyperglycemia and diabetes with atypical antipsychotics. It must also be pointed out that although all atypicals must carry the warning on their labeling, some evidence shows that atypicals are not equal in their effects on weight and insulin sensitivity. The general consensus is that clozapine and olanzapine are associated with the greatest effects on weight gain and decreased insulin sensitivity, followed by risperidone and quetiapine. Ziprasidone and <b>aripiprazole</b> are thought to have the smallest effects on weight and insulin resistance, but clinical experience with these newer agents is not as developed as that with the older agents. The mechanism of these adverse effects is not completely understood but it is believed to result from a complex interaction between a number of pharmacologic actions of these drugs. Their effects on weight are believed to mostly derive from their actions on the H1 and 5-HT2C receptors, while their effects on insulin sensitivity are believed {{to be the result of}} a combination of their effects on body weight (as increased body mass is known to be a risk factor for insulin resistance) and their antagonistic effects on the M3receptor. Some of the newer agents, however, such as risperidone and its metabolite paliperidone, ziprasidone, lurasidone, <b>aripiprazole,</b> asenapine and iloperidone have clinically-insignificant effects on the M3 receptor and appear to carry a lower risk of insulin resistance. Whereas clozapine, olanzapine and quetiapine (indirectly via its active metabolite, norquetiapine) all antagonise the M3 receptor at therapeutic-relevant concentrations.|$|E
