The plastic strain scatter increases for decreasing ma-croscopic strains. The number of cycles to the first micro-crack initiation corresponding to the aforesaid plastic strain distributions is then calculated using a surface roughness based initiation criterion.

40|$|The most {{important}} failure cause in automotive industry {{is believed to}} be fatigue. Hence, predicting the lifetime of critical components would be of interest for manufacturers. Computerized methods for predicting the fatigue lifetime as well as microstructural predictions could always be helpful once utilized properly. Amongst numerous components used in automotive industry, limited numbers are subjected to torsion especially if they are welded, but their reduced quality could lead into catastrophic failure. As a matter of fact, the fatigue properties of structures subjected to torsion loading is less investigated than the properties under other loading conditions. Combining the ideas above, this work has been developed based on modeling, simulating and predicting plenty of characteristics in high strength steel welds subjected to <b>alternating</b> <b>torsion</b> loading, using a number of softwares. Numerous approaches for predicting fatigue lifetime in such components alongside of microstructural prediction and control in those welds were engaged to help the automotive industry grasp a deeper knowledge about such specific cases. A test specimen which can include both welded high strength steels and specifications for bearing torsion loading has been designed. For analyzing the stress distribution on such specimen under defined torsion loading, ABAQUS was used. Then the model was imported into FRANC 3 D which specifically looks into fatigue via Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics (LEFM) method. Afterwards, several other methods and hypotheses were employed to do the same procedure for comparison. For instance; strain-base hypotheses, Elasto-Plastic Fracture Mechanics (EPFM), rain-flow analysis for spectrum loading cases and hot-spot analysis were employed. The other interesting part of prediction relates to weldâ€™s microstructure. For predicting the microstructure, both cooling rates after welding and CCT diagrams should be available.

40|$|AbstractThe {{construction}} of modern commercial buildings should always incorporate building services while reducing {{the cost of}} steel. A frequently used solution is to provide openings at the web of the beams and girders to enable services to pass through. The main objective {{of this paper is}} to determine the angle of torsion of a flat-web (FW) profile steel section with openings of different shapes and sizes using LUSAS software. A model consisting of a FW profile beam steel section of five shapes and three sizes of openings has been developed. The shapes of opening are circle, square, regular octagon, C-hexagon, and regular hexagon. The sizes of the opening are 0. 5 D, 0. 6 D and 0. 8 D; D is the height of the web. Based on the results of the analytical investigations, the best shape of the opening is C-hexagon, and best size is 0. 5 D in <b>resistance</b> <b>torsion</b> compared with a FW profile section without opening. When the length of the beam section becomes longer, the value of the rotation angle increases. In general, the value of the angle of rotation for all shapes and sizes is close to the value of the angle of rotation for a FW profile without opening. Hence a flat-web section with opening is suitable in many cases to reduce cost and weight of steel...|$|R

MATERIAL E MÃ‰TODOS: Foram montados fixadores externos lineares em tubos de polipropileno de 500 mm, com um corte obliquo a 45 Âº no seu centro, com dois pinos de Schanz em cada segmento. Foram estudados 18 corpos de prova, divididos em trÃªs grupos de seis peÃ§as cada. No grupo 1 foram utilizados pinos de Schanz de 4, 5 mm, no grupo 2 pinos de 5, 5 mm ambos com alma de 3, 2 mm e no grupo 3 pinos de 5, 5 mm com alma de 4, 5 mm de diÃ¢metro. Os testes mecÃ¢nicos foram {{realizadas}} em mÃ¡quina de torÃ§Ã£o MT- 100, e as medidas de resistÃªncia realizadas com 4, 5 Âº, 9, 0 Âº, 13, 5 Âº e 18, 0 Âº de torÃ§Ã£o. RESULTADOS: Os pinos de Schanz de 4, 5 mm e alma de 3, 2 mm mostraram como mÃ©dia de resistÃªncia para as torÃ§Ãµes de 4, 5 Âº, 9, 0 Âº, 13, 5 Âº e 18, 0 Âº, respectivamente: 12, 0 N/mm, 21, 0 N/mm, 33, 0 N/mm e 46, 0 N/mm. Os pinos de 5, 5 com alma de 3, 2 mm mostraram como resistÃªncia mÃ©dia: 13, 2 N/mm, 25, 3 N/mm, 40, 0 N/mm e 51, 2 N/mm, respectivamente. Os testes com os pinos de Schanz de 5, 5 mm com alma de 4, 5 mm mostraram resistÃªncia mÃ©dia de: 15, 2 N/mm, 33, 5 N/mm, 53, 0 N/mm e 70, 0 N/mm. Estudo estatÃ­stico com o teste da AnÃ¡lise de VariÃ¢ncia e o teste de Bonferroni mostraram ausÃªncia de diferenÃ§a estatisticamente significante entre os grupos com pinos com diÃ¢metro da alma da parte roscada de 3, 2 mm (de 4, 5 mm e 5, 5 mm). Houve diferenÃ§a estatisticamente significante (alfa OBJECTIVE: The {{objective of}} this study was to evaluate the mechanical force of three different assemblies of a linear external fixator using 4. 5 mm and 5. 5 mm Schanz screws with a 3. 2 mm-diameter root, and another screw with 5. 5 mm diameter with a 4, 5 mm root. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The linear external fixator was assembled in a 500 mm-long polypropylene tube, with a 45 -degree oblique angle cut in the center of the cylinder, with two Schanz screws in each segment. Eighteen assemblies were studied, divided into three groups of six pieces each. In the group 1, 4. 5 mm-diameter Schanz screws were used, in the group 2, 5. 5 mm-diameter Schanz screws, both with 3, 2 mm root were used. In the group 3, 5. 5 mm-diameter Schanz screws with a diameter root of 4. 5 mm were used. The mechanical tests were performed in a MT- 100 torsion machine, and the resistance measurements were performed at 4. 5 Âº, 9. 0 Âº, 13. 5 Âº, and 18 Âº of torsion. RESULTS: The 4. 5 mm Schanz screws with 3, 2 mm root showed an average <b>torsion</b> <b>resistance</b> at 4. 5 o, 9. 0 o, 13. 5 o and 18. 0 o, respectively of: 12. 0 N/mm, 21. 0 N/mm, 33. 0 N/mm, and 46. 0 N/mm. The 5. 5 mm Schanz screw with 3. 2 mm root, showed as average resistance: 13. 2 N/mm, 25. 3 N/mm, 40. 0 N/mm, and 51. 2 N/mm, respectively. The tests with 5. 5 mm Schanz screws with 4. 5 mm root showed an average resistance of: 15. 2 N/mm, 33. 5 N/mm, 53. 0 N/mm, and 70. 0 N/mm. Statistical analysis with the Variance Analysis test and the Bonferroni's test showed the absence of statistically significant differences among groups with root diameter of 3. 2 mm (4. 5 mm and 5. 5 mm). There was a statistically significant difference between the group with the 5. 5 mm Schanz screws with 4. 5 mm root and the other two groups. CONCLUSIONS: 1 - There was no statistically significant difference among assemblies of linear external fixator using 4. 5 mm and 5. 5 mm Schanz screws with 3. 2 mm root. 2 - The linear external fixator with 5. 5 mm Schanz screws with 4. 5 mm root, showed a stronger mechanical <b>resistance</b> to the <b>torsion,</b> statistically significant, regarding the other two groups...|$|R
