50|$|Not all the {{clusters}} are stable. The stability of nanoclusters {{depends on the}} number of atoms in the nanocluster, valence electron counts and encapsulating scaffolds. In the 1990s, Heer and his coworkers used supersonic expansion of an <b>atomic</b> <b>cluster</b> source into a vacuum in the presence of an inert gas and produced <b>atomic</b> <b>cluster</b> beams. Heer's team and Brack et al. discovered that certain masses of formed metal nanoclusters were stable and were like magic clusters. The number of atoms or size of the core of these magic clusters corresponds to the closing of atomic shells. Certain thiolated clusters such as Au25(SR)18, Au38(SR)24, Au102(SR)44 and Au144(SR)60 also showed magic number stability. Häkkinen et al explained this stability with a theory that a nanocluster is stable if the number of valence electrons corresponds to the shell closure of atomic orbitals as (1S2, 1P6, 1D10, 2S2 1F14, 2P6 1G18, 2D10 3S2 1H22.......).|$|E

40|$|The {{temperature}} {{dependence of the}} viscosity of liquid Al- 12 wt. %Sn- 4 wt. %Si was studied with a high-temperature viscosity apparatus. Anomalous changes of viscosity of the melt were found at 1, 103 K and 968 K in the cooling process, which indicates anomalous structural changes of the melt. It is calculated that the anomalous structural change is associated with an abrupt decrease of atomic clusters’ size and activation energy in the melt.

40|$|It {{is ideal}} to {{theoretically}} predict {{the activity of}} a catalyst. It has been recognized that not only the type of metal, but also its atomic size {{plays an important role}} in catalysis. In the past, <b>atomic</b> <b>clusters</b> have been created by sputtering from a sacrificial metal plate and then using a mass selector to choose cluster sizes from 1 - 233 atoms of gold. This approach has practical limitations. In this thesis, I describe a procedure by which <b>atomic</b> <b>clusters</b> of gold containing 1 - 8 atoms are deposited in polyaniline as an isolation matrix. My atomic deposition follows a cyclic pathway. <b>Atomic</b> <b>clusters</b> of palladium and atomic alloys of gold and palladium are also deposited in polyaniline using the same process. It is to show that this method will also work for other metals. These composite materials are characterized, and the catalytic activity for alcohol oxidation is evaluated. This thesis is divided into seven chapters. The first chapter discusses the chemistry of polyaniline for using gold and palladium as catalysts. The technique developed to deposit the <b>atomic</b> <b>clusters</b> is discussed in the second chapter. This technique deposits one atom of metal per imine site on polyaniline, per cycle. The cycle is repeated n-times until a cluster of specified size, Mn, and composition has been synthesized. It is known that polyaniline {{plays an important role in}} stabilization of the formed clusters which prevents their aggregation. The optimization of this technique is the topic of the third chapter along with the description of how these composite films are produced. To end this chapter, the composite films are characterized by cyclic voltammetry, Kelvin probe, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. In chapters 4 and 5, the catalytic activity of the polyaniline/gold composites for the oxidation of alcohols in alkaline media using cyclic voltammetry is evaluated. In chapter 4, the correlation of the electrochemical activity for the oxidation of n-PrOH with the odd-even pattern from the calculated HOMO-LUMO gap energies for the same size clusters is shown. It is shown that the infrared spectrum of polyaniline with different sizes of <b>atomic</b> gold <b>clusters</b> also follows the odd-even pattern. Chapter 5 expands on the discussion of the catalytic oxidation of alcohols. The oxidation of methanol, ethanol, propanol, and butanol is surveyed. The peak currents are again dominated by the odd-even pattern. In chapter 6, the versatility of the atomic deposition cycle is shown by depositing <b>atomic</b> palladium <b>clusters.</b> The peak currents for the oxidation of n-PrOH by these palladium composite films again follows the predicted pattern of the calculated HOMO-LUMO gap energies for <b>atomic</b> palladium <b>clusters.</b> This chapter also explores bimetallic <b>atomic</b> <b>clusters</b> of gold and palladium. The results indicate that the catalytic activity depends on the orientation of the cluster in the polyaniline matrix. Chapter 7 discusses the oxidation of methanol, ethanol, and isopropanol on AunPd 1 bimetallic <b>atomic</b> <b>clusters.</b> The addition of palladium in the cluster increases the peak current densities for the oxidation of both alcohols except for the most stable of the <b>atomic</b> gold <b>clusters,</b> while it inactivated the electrodes for isopropanol. The possible future work for this project is discussed in chapter 8. Overall, this thesis has developed a novel and unique technique for depositing <b>atomic</b> metal <b>clusters</b> into a polyaniline matrix. The technique is versatile enough to deposit <b>atomic</b> metal <b>clusters</b> other than gold, as shown by creating <b>atomic</b> palladium <b>clusters</b> and <b>atomic</b> bimetallic <b>clusters</b> of gold and palladium. This is extremely useful, since this single technique can produce many different types of atomic catalysts. The composite materials have been shown to be catalytically active for the oxidation of alcohols in alkaline media. This indicates a significant improvement to conserve precious metals while still retaining a high catalytic activity. Ph. D...|$|R

Our method provides an efficient tool for the calculation and analysis of <b>atomic</b> <b>cluster</b> structure. With its use we justify the magic numbers sequence for the clusters of noble gases atoms and compare it with experimental observations.

40|$|We report {{electronic}} transmission properties of a tight binding Aharonov-Bohm ring threaded by a magnetic flux, to one arm {{of which a}} finite cluster of atoms has been attached from one side. we demonstrate that, by suitably choosing the number of scatterers in each arm of the quantum ring and, by decoupling the ring from the <b>atomic</b> <b>cluster,</b> the transmission across the ring can be completely blocked when the flux threading the ring becomes equal to half the fundamental flux quantum. A transmission resonance then occurs immediately as the coupling between the ring and the impurity cluster is switched 'on'. It is shown that the delta-like transmission resonances occur precisely at the eigenvalues of the side coupled chain of atoms. Thw 'switching' effect can be observed either for all the eigenvalues of the isolated <b>atomic</b> <b>cluster,</b> or for a selected set of them, depending {{on the number of}} scatterers in the arms of the ring. The ring-dot coupling can be gradually increased to suppress the oscillations in the magneto-transmission completely.

40|$|We {{develop a}} {{framework}} for understanding the difference between strong and fragile behavior in the dynamics of glass-forming liquids from {{the properties of the}} potential energy landscape. Our approach is based on a master equation description of the activated jump dynamics among the local minima of the potential energy (the so-called inherent structures) that characterize the potential energy landscape of the system. We study the dynamics of a small <b>atomic</b> <b>cluster</b> using this description as well as molecular dynamics simulations and demonstrate the usefulness of our approach for this system. Many of the remarkable features of the complex dynamics of glassy systems emerge from the activated dynamics in the potential energy landscape of the <b>atomic</b> <b>cluster.</b> The dynamics of the system exhibits typical characteristics of a strong supercooled liquid when the system is allowed to explore the full configuration space. This behavior arises because the dynamics is dominated by a few lowest-lying minima of the potential energy and the potential energy barriers between these minima. When the system is constrained to explore only a limited region of the potential energy landscape that excludes the basins of attraction of a few lowest-lying minima, the dynamics is found to exhibit the characteristics of a fragile liquid.
