It is generic {{in the sense that the}} <b>automatic</b> <b>scaling</b> technique can be applied to improve any particular service discovery system, and it is applicable across a large variety of types of network because we show how all the tuning parameters are derived. We present results showing controlled load discovery with scalability up to very large networks. We also show that the algorithms are simple and easy to implement; an important practical requirement since the method is used in Windows Vista and licensed by many hardware vendors.
