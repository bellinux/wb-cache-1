To seek new markets and sources of raw materials, the Conservative Party under Benjamin Disraeli launched a period of imperialist expansion in Egypt, South Africa, and elsewhere. Canada, Australia, and New Zealand became self-governing dominions.|$|E

For the first six months, the album sold poorly, and attracted little fanfare. Geffen did not promote the band, as they were virtually unaware of their existence. This led Aubin Paul of Punknews.org to jokingly comment that Fat Wreck Chords was doing more to promote the band. Rise Against's incessant touring schedule resulted in greater exposure, which contributed to <b>an</b> <b>gradual</b> increase in sales. Eventually, Geffen noticed the increase in sales, and began promoting the band.|$|R
