5|$|Safeties are {{the least}} common method of scoring in American {{football}} but are not rare occurrences– since 1932, a safety has occurred once every 14.31 games in the National Football League (NFL), or <b>about</b> <b>once</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> under current scheduling rules. On October 21, 1973, Fred Dryer, playing for the Los Angeles Rams against the Green Bay Packers, became the only player in NFL History to score two safeties in a single game. A much rarer occurrence is the one-point safety, which can be scored by the offense on an extra point or two-point conversion attempt; those have occurred at least twice in NCAA Division I football since 1996, most recently at the 2013 Fiesta Bowl. No conversion safeties have occurred since at least 1940 in the NFL. A conversion safety by the defense is also possible, though highly unlikely; although this has never occurred, {{it is the only}} possible way a team could finish with a single point in an American football game.|$|E
500|$|The {{line was}} {{recommended}} for closure by Dr. Richard Beeching in the 1963 Beeching Report, as {{in addition to}} its inconvenient location, it maintained fully manned staff at all stations despite low passenger numbers. Like several other lines threatened with closure, there was strong opposition, and the route survived because the nearby road network made it impractical to run a replacement bus service. The parallel main road from Hastings to Brenzett, the A259, had several level crossings over the line and a hairpin bend at Winchelsea, all of which remain as of the 21st century. At {{the same time as the}} Beeching Report was published, Arthur Irvine complained that a bus took an hour to travel the [...] between Rye and Ashford. The branch to New Romney closed on 6 March 1967, although since 1975 freight traffic has used the line as far as a nuclear flask loading and unloading point just outside Dungeness. This branch now sees flask trains <b>about</b> <b>once</b> <b>a</b> <b>week.</b> Very occasional passenger services are run for rail enthuasists; as of 2008 the former Lydd station was beginning to fall into disrepair. The branch to Rye Harbour was lifted at around the same time as the New Romney Branch's closure.|$|E

2500|$|Both {{passenger}} and {{freight traffic}} declined in later years, and beginning in 1922 mixed train service was partially supplanted by a Brill railbus, a self-propelled vehicle designed to carry passengers and small freight shipments. [...] For {{most of the}} 1920s, the railbus operated between Salmon and Gilmore, while the tri-weekly mixed continued between Salmon and Armstead. [...] In 1931, the G borrowed a second, larger railbus from the Northern Pacific, {{and used it to}} provide a daily-except-Sunday roundtrip between Armstead and Salmon. [...] The mixed was discontinued at that time, and freight trains began operating only as required, usually <b>about</b> <b>once</b> <b>a</b> <b>week.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Sloths go to {{the ground}} to urinate and defecate <b>about</b> <b>once</b> <b>a</b> <b>week,</b> digging a hole and {{covering}} it afterwards. They {{go to the}} same spot each time and are vulnerable to predation while doing so. The reason for this risky behaviour is unknown, although some believe it is to avoid making noise while defecating from up high that would attract predators. Consistent with this, they reportedly relieve themselves from their branches during storms in the rainy season. Another possible explanation is that the middens provide the sloths with one of their few methods of finding one another for breeding purposes, since their sense of smell is far more acute than their eyesight or hearing. Still other recent studies have suggested that it might be relevant for maintaining the ecosystem in the sloths' fur. Individual sloths tend to spend the bulk of their time feeding on a single [...] "modal" [...] tree; by burying their excreta near the trunk of that tree, they may help nourish it. Recently there has been some speculation that sloths go to the ground to defecate because of their mutually beneficial relationships with moths. While the sloth defecates, female moths that otherwise live on a sloth will get off and immediately lay their eggs directly on the fecal matter, on which the larvae survive until they mature to adulthood and are able to fly onto sloths. Incidentally, it appears that sloths benefit from their relationship with moths because the moths are responsible for fertilizing algae on the sloth, which provides them with nutrients.|$|E

60|$|Nevertheless, the parlor-window {{has given}} us {{a pretty good idea of}} the {{nautical}} business of Liverpool; the constant objects being the little black steamers puffing unquietly along, sometimes to our own ferry, sometimes beyond it to Eastham, and sometimes towing a long string of boats from Runcorn or otherwhere up the river, laden with goods, and sometimes gallanting a tall ship in or out. Some of these ships lie for days together in the river, very majestic and stately objects, often with the flag of the stars and stripes waving over them. Now and then, after a gale at sea, a vessel comes in with her masts broken short off in the midst, and with marks of rough handling <b>about</b> the hull. <b>Once</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> comes <b>a</b> Cunard steamer, with its red funnel pipe whitened by the salt spray; and, firing off cannon to announce her arrival, she moors to a large iron buoy in the middle of the river, and a few hundred yards from the stone pier of our ferry. Immediately comes poring towards her a little mail-steamer, to take away her mail-bags and such of the passengers as choose to land; and for several hours afterwards the Cunard lies with the smoke and steam coming out of her, as if she were smoking her pipe after her toilsome passage across the Atlantic. <b>Once</b> <b>a</b> fortnight comes an American steamer of the Collins line; and then the Cunard salutes her with cannon, to which the Collins responds, and moors herself to another iron buoy, not far from the Cunard. When they go to sea, it is with similar salutes; the two vessels paying each other the more ceremonious respect, because they are inimical and jealous of each other.|$|R
