25|$|The {{purpose of}} calculating dietary {{exposure}} to a given chemical or contaminant is so the estimated dietary exposure {{can be compared to}} a relevant health standard such as the acceptable daily intake (ADI), the acute reference dose (ARfD) or reference dose (RfD), or a level known to cause adverse effects in animal or human health studies. From this comparison, one can begin to <b>assess</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of adverse effects from a chemical or contaminant due to dietary exposure.|$|E

It was suggested that Mylar tape be used to coat the windows for a barrier, but the cost, about $4.5 million, was considered prohibitive. It was also suggested that the perimeter be expanded to at least 500 feet to save servicemen from flying glass.|$|E

2500|$|The Court {{found that}} the Government had taken no steps to <b>assess</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> posed should the marches have gone ahead.

[...] (para.85) The Government had failed to demonstrate any pressing social need to ban such demonstrations {{for any of the}} reasons it had given. The Court therefore found the ban not to have been necessary in a democratic society, and to have been a violation of the right to freedom of assembly under Article 11.|$|E
2500|$|Pregnant {{women may}} carry a fetus with a blood type which is {{different}} from their own. In those cases, the mother can make IgG blood group antibodies. This can happen {{if some of the}} fetus' blood cells pass into the mother's blood circulation (e.g. a small fetomaternal hemorrhage at the time of childbirth or obstetric intervention), or sometimes after a therapeutic blood transfusion. [...] This can cause Rh disease or other forms of hemolytic disease of the newborn (HDN) in the current pregnancy and/or subsequent pregnancies. [...] Sometimes this is lethal for the fetus; in these cases it is called hydrops fetalis. If a pregnant woman is known to have anti-D antibodies, the Rh blood type of a fetus can be tested by analysis of fetal DNA in maternal plasma to <b>assess</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> to the fetus of Rh disease. One of the major advances of twentieth century medicine was to prevent this disease by stopping the formation of Anti-D antibodies by D negative mothers with an injectable medication called Rho(D) immune globulin. Antibodies associated with some blood groups can cause severe HDN, others can only cause mild HDN and others are not known to cause HDN.|$|E
