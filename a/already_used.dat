5|$|The genus name Triturus was {{introduced}} in 1815 by the polymath Constantine Samuel Rafinesque, with the northern crested newt (Triturus cristatus) as type species.

5|$|Construction of {{the delayed}} 1926 order for 20 K class {{locomotives}} began in 1928 after alteration to the U class specification. As {{a result of}} Harold Holcroft’s position as one of Maunsell’s assistants, the new-builds also displayed the Churchward GWR 4300 Class influence. The ideas applied to this class were <b>already</b> <b>used</b> on the N, N1 and K class rebuilds, including long-travel valves for fast running, Belpaire firebox and conical boilers, constructed at the North British Locomotive Works in Glasgow. The first of the production batch emerged from Brighton works in August 1928 and featured a tapered chimney and smokebox snifting valves, {{both of which were}} used on the K and N class locomotives.|$|E

5|$|In mid-1961, President Ngo Dinh Diem of South Vietnam {{asked the}} United States to conduct aerial {{herbicide}} spraying in his country. In August of that year, the Republic of Vietnam Air Force conducted herbicide operations with American help. But Diem's request launched a policy {{debate in the}} White House and the State and Defense Departments. However, U.S. officials considered using it, {{pointing out that the}} British had <b>already</b> <b>used</b> herbicides and defoliants during the Malayan Emergency in the 1950s.

5|$|Synthetic diamond is <b>already</b> <b>used</b> as {{radiation}} detection device. It is radiation hard {{and has a}} wide bandgap of 5.5 eV (at room temperature). Diamond is also distinguished from most other semiconductors {{by the lack of}} a stable native oxide. This makes it difficult to fabricate surface MOS devices, but it does create the potential for UV radiation {{to gain access to the}} active semiconductor without absorption in a surface layer. Because of these properties, it is employed in applications such as the BaBar detector at the Stanford Linear Accelerator and BOLD (Blind to the Optical Light Detectors for VUV solar observations). A diamond VUV detector recently was used in the European LYRA program.|$|E
5|$|The {{group had}} {{originally}} {{wanted to call}} the album Abracadabra, until they discovered that another band had <b>already</b> <b>used</b> it. When discussing possible alternatives, during their German tour, Lennon opted for Four Sides to the Circle in response to McCartney's Magic Circle, and Starr jokingly suggested After Geography, a play on {{the title of the}} Rolling Stones' recently released Aftermath LP. Other suggestions included Bubble and Squeak, Beatles on Safari and Pendulum before the band settled on Revolver. They confirmed their choice in a telegram to EMI, sent from the Tokyo Hilton on 2 July.|$|E

5|$|Unlike most {{electrical}} insulators, diamond {{is a good}} {{conductor of}} heat because of the strong covalent bonding and low phonon scattering. Thermal conductivity of natural diamond {{was measured to be}} about 2200W/(m·K), which is five times more than copper. Monocrystalline synthetic diamond enriched to 99.9% the isotope 12C has the highest thermal conductivity of any known solid at room temperature: 3320W/(m·K). Because diamond has such high thermal conductance it is <b>already</b> <b>used</b> in semiconductor manufacture to prevent silicon and other semiconducting materials from overheating. At lower temperatures conductivity becomes even better, and reaches 41000W/(m·K) at 104K (12C-enriched diamond).|$|E
5|$|Back in Arendelle, Anna (who has {{woken up}} from the spell) tried to track down a device known as a wishing star, which will {{have the power to}} bring her and Kristoff to {{wherever}} Elsa is. It was apparently the necklace Elsa had given Anna long ago, Elsa using it to bring Anna and Kristoff to Storybrooke. However, the Spell of Shattered Sight had already begun, and the only ones immune to it were Elsa, Emma, and Anna (Anna because it was <b>already</b> <b>used</b> on her a while ago). Tracking down a note written by Elsa and Anna's mother right before her death, the three bring it to Ingrid. It reads that Gerda forgave Ingrid for all that had transpired and still loved her, Ingrid realizing this was what the prophecy meant by regaining her sister's love. Realizing {{there is no point in}} killing the town now, the Snow Queen kills herself using the mirror, which deactivates the curse, though a bit of it remained in Storybrooke, reinstating the town line, making it impossible to return to town if you are to leave it.|$|E
5|$|Beginning {{with the}} 2005–06 season, the NHL instituted several new rules. Some {{of them were}} <b>already</b> <b>used</b> by the IIHF, such as the shootout and making the two-line pass legal. Others which were not {{picked up by the}} IIHF, such as {{requiring}} smaller goaltender equipment and the addition of the goaltender trapezoid to the rink. However, the IIHF did agree to follow the NHL's league's zero-tolerance policy on obstruction and required referees to call more hooking, holding and interference penalties. In 2006, the IIHF voted to eliminate tie games and institute a three-point system: wins in regulation time would be worth three points, overtime wins would be two points and over-time losses would be worth one point. The system was first used at the 2007 World Championships.|$|E

5|$|Despite limited {{information}} about its service routes and construction, the Nathan F. Cobb {{was the subject}} of two separate New York Times articles during its short career. One article reported the wreck the day after it occurred, the other article came from 20 June 1892 and chronicled a disturbance between mates. The Cobb was still in tow only three miles outside Mobile Bay, beginning its route from Mobile, Alabama to New York, when mate Henry Shaffer jumped over board to avoid a beating. Another mate, J. Trott had <b>already</b> <b>used</b> a belaying pin to half kill another seaman on the schooner and Shaffer was fearful for his life. Shaffer began swimming towards a nearby light house and was picked up nearly five miles from where he jumped over board. The captain of the towboat reported that Captain Cookson of the Cobb, mentioned incidentally they had lost a crewman. Both Cookson and Trott already had pending charges against them for cruelty and marooning of sailors, stemming from an incident in May 1891 at Calcasieu Pass, Louisiana.|$|E
5|$|Further, {{the work}} shows {{evidence}} of its having been {{put together in}} a very haphazard and hasty fashion, with little to no subsequent editing of the material to form a cohesive narrative. Birley sees {{an example of the}} carelessness with which the author approached the work in the construction of Marcus Aurelius' biography, where midway through the Life of Marcus Aurelius the author found himself in a muddle, probably because he had historical material in excess of what he required, and also because he had <b>already</b> <b>used</b> up much of his source to write separate biographies of Lucius Verus and Avidius Cassius, whose lives intersected with Marcus'. The answer he came up with was to use Eutropius as his source for a brief overview of Marcus' principate following the death of Lucius Verus. However, he found that in doing so, the narrative's ending was too abrupt and so, after including some gossip about Commodus not being his son, he once again began an account of Marcus' reign after the death of Verus.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} days before the 2015 Michigan Wolverines {{football}} team began its season for new head coach Jim Harbaugh against Utah, Morris was in a quarterback battle with incoming graduate student transfer Jake Rudock, who had started the prior two seasons for Iowa. On Monday before the Thursday September 3 game, Harbaugh would not name his starter. Rudock started the game. After the second game, against Oregon State, there was controversy when Wilton Speight took the mopup snaps during the 357 victory instead of Morris. Harbaugh explained that since Speight had <b>already</b> <b>used</b> his redshirt season and Morris had not, {{there was no reason}} for Morris to lose a season unless it was for meaningful snaps, but that Morris is the #2 quarterback. When Rudock was sidelined in the third quarter with the team trailing in the October 31, 2015, Little Brown Jug rivalry game against Minnesota, Speight engineered the game-winning drive via his first touchdown pass with less than five minutes remaining in the fourth quarter. Harbaugh explained that Speight had earned the backup role in practice in the preceding weeks.|$|E
