5|$|In 1949 Sweden {{chose not}} to join NATO and {{declared}} a security policy aiming for non-alignment in peace and neutrality in war. A modified version now qualifies non-alignment in peace for possible neutrality in war. This position was maintained without much discussion during the Cold War. Since the 1990s however {{there has been an}} active debate in Sweden on the question of NATO membership in the post–Cold War world. These ideological divides were visible in November 2006 when Sweden could either buy two new transport planes or join NATO's plane pool, and in December 2006, when Sweden was invited to join the NATO Response Force. Sweden have been <b>active</b> <b>participants</b> in NATO-led missions in Bosnia (IFOR and SFOR), Kosovo (KFOR), Afghanistan (ISAF), and Libya (Operation Unified Protector).|$|E
5|$|It is not {{a unique}} case among English medieval monasteries that almost nothing has survived of {{what must have been}} a number of books owned by the house as such or in the keeping of {{individual}} monks. These would include at least a small library with biblical texts, spiritual works and perhaps some books on practical subjects, bearing in mind that the management of the abbey plant would have been a considerable challenge. Furthermore, the celebration of the liturgy for a large part of the day and night would necessitate texts for the different participants, who as monks were for the most part not spectators but <b>active</b> <b>participants,</b> some of them with particular roles.|$|E
5|$|Proponents of {{this idea}} point out that moralists during Bosch's era {{believed}} that it was woman'sultimately Eve'stemptation that drew men into a life of lechery and sin. This would explain why the women in the center panel are very much among the <b>active</b> <b>participants</b> in bringing about the Fall. At the time, the power of femininity was often rendered by showing a female surrounded by a circle of males. A late 15th-century engraving by Israhel van Meckenem shows a group of men prancing ecstatically around a female figure. The Master of the Banderoles's 1460 work the Pool of Youth similarly shows a group of females standing in a space surrounded by admiring figures.|$|E

5|$|Scholars have differing {{views on}} whether this {{dialogue}} {{is evidence that}} in ancient Vedic tradition women were accepted as <b>active</b> <b>participants</b> in spiritual discussions and as scholars of Brahman. Wendy Doniger, an American Indologist {{and a professor of}} History of Religions, states that in this dialogue Maitreyi is not portrayed as an author, but is part of an Upanishadic story of a Brahmin with two wives who are distinguished by their intellect. Karen Pechelis, another American Indologist and a professor of Comparative Religion, in contrast, states that Maitreyi is portrayed as theologically minded, as she challenges Yajnavalkya in this dialogue and asks the right questions.|$|E
5|$|Semantic {{support is}} the most obvious method of {{vocabulary}} development in school-age children. It involves giving direct verbal information {{of the meaning of}} a word. By the time children are in school, they are <b>active</b> <b>participants</b> in conversation, so they are very capable and willing to ask questions when they do not understand a word or concept. For example, a child might see a zebra {{for the first time and}} ask, what is that? and the parent might respond, that is a zebra. It is like a horse with stripes and it is wild so you cannot ride it.|$|E
5|$|While domain-specific {{accounts}} of word learning argue for innate constraints that limit infants' hypotheses about word meanings, domain-general perspectives argue that word learning can {{be accounted for}} by general cognitive processes, such as learning and memory, which are not specific to language. Yet other theorists have proposed social pragmatic accounts, which stress the role of caregivers in guiding infants through the word learning process. According to some research, however, children are <b>active</b> <b>participants</b> in their own word learning, although caregivers may still {{play an important role in}} this process. Recently, an emergentist coalition model has also been proposed to suggest that word learning cannot be fully attributed to a single factor. Instead, a variety of cues, including salient and social cues, may be utilized by infants at different points in their vocabulary development.|$|E
