60|$|We may learn, first; {{not to be}} astonished, if we have {{to change}} our {{opinions}} as we grow older. When we are young, we are very positive about this thing and that, <b>as</b> St. <b>Paul</b> was; violent in favour of our own opinions; ready to quarrel with any one who differs from us, <b>as</b> St. <b>Paul</b> was. But let ten years, twenty years, roll over our heads, and we may find our opinions utterly changed, <b>as</b> St. <b>Paul</b> did, and look back with astonishment on ourselves, for having been foolish enough to believe what we did, <b>as</b> St. <b>Paul</b> looked back; and with shame, <b>as</b> did St. <b>Paul</b> likewise, at having said so many violent and unjust things against people, who, we now see, were in the right after all.|$|R
5|$|Alessandro Farnese, <b>as</b> <b>Paul</b> III, was {{the last}} of the popes {{appointed}} by the ruling Medici family of Florence. He was socially ambitious, a careerist and not particularly pious. He kept a concubine, fathered four children out of wedlock and viewed the throne as an opportunity to fill his coffers while he placed his relatives in high positions. A talented and cunning political operator, Paul was precisely the sort of man the Florentines needed to assist them in their defence against French and Spanish threats.|$|E
5|$|Also known <b>as</b> <b>Paul</b> Faraj Rahho and Paulos Faradsch Raho, he was {{an ethnic}} Chaldean, born in Mosul, where he lived almost his entire life.

50|$|Felix has {{arranged}} for Annette to visit Paul during his lunch break in his office. Paul, shy to a fault, doesn't {{know how to}} deal with the situation.

While just a moment before, he wasn't sure whether he should perhaps court Annette, now it is clear: Annette must be removed from his life.|$|R
5|$|Considering the {{lopsided}} {{score of}} the series, historians such <b>as</b> <b>Paul</b> Kitchen question why Dawson City was even granted a chance at the Cup. Dawson City had won no championships and {{did not belong to}} any recognized senior league. While team official Weldy Young knew Stanley Cup trustee P. D. Ross personally through their joint connection with the club, {{it may have been the}} political connections that Joe Boyle had with the government Interior Minister of the time, Clifford Sifton, that got Dawson City the series.|$|E
5|$|During these events, no gunshots were fired. The {{people did}} not react strongly, which {{according}} to the military, {{was a sign of}} approval. A provisional government was formed, and the presidency was offered to Aubame. The government was composed of civilian politicians from both the UDSG and BDG, such <b>as</b> <b>Paul</b> Gondjout. As for the coup plotters, they were content to ensure security for civilians. The small Gabonese army did not intervene in the coup; composed mostly of French officers, they remained in their barracks.|$|E

2500|$|Jack Cafferty {{observed}} that Paul's grassroots network is one [...] "politicians dream about" [...] {{and that no}} other candidate running had a base as dedicated or <b>as</b> vocal <b>as</b> <b>Paul's.</b> Paul also earned the attention of many sympathizers outside of the United States.|$|R

5|$|In Justinian's reign, {{and partly}} under his patronage, Byzantine culture {{produced}} noteworthy historians, including Procopius and Agathias, and poets such <b>as</b> <b>Paul</b> the Silentiary and Romanus the Melodist flourished. On the other hand, centres of learning as the Platonic Academy in Athens {{and the famous}} Law School of Beirut lost their importance during his reign. Despite Justinian's passion for the glorious Roman past, the practice of choosing Roman consul was allowed to lapse after 541.|$|E

5|$|Some philosophers, such <b>as</b> <b>Paul</b> Boghossian, have {{attempted}} to show that eliminativism is in some sense self-refuting, since the theory itself presupposes the existence of mental phenomena. If eliminativism is true, then the eliminativist must permit an intentional property like truth, supposing {{that in order to}} assert something one must believe it. Hence, for eliminativism to be asserted as a thesis, the eliminativist must believe that it is true; if that is the case, then there are beliefs and the eliminativist claim is false.|$|E
5|$|Aspinall {{was born}} in Prestatyn, North Wales, after {{his mother had been}} {{evacuated}} from the family home in Liverpool because of the air-raids on Liverpool during the Second World War, while Aspinall's father was away at sea with the Royal Navy.
