40|$|Introduction: During {{the period}} from November 1998 through February 1999, a series of {{measurements}} was carried out on the 70 -m antenna at DSS 14 to determine the performance characteristics of two systems designed {{to compensate for the}} effects of elevation-dependent gravity distortion of the main reflector on antenna gain. The array feed compensation system (AFCS) and the deformable fiat plate (DFP) system were both mounted on the same feed cone and each was used independently as well as jointly to measure and improve the <b>antenna</b> <b>aperture</b> <b>efficiency</b> as a function of elevation angle. The experimental data is presented in [1] and [2]. This write-up contains a description of the computational method and theoretical results for the DFP and Array Feed systems. The basic analysis tool is a Physical Optics reflector analysis code that was ported to a parallel computer for faster execution times. There are several steps involved in computing the RF performance of the various systems. A mode...|$|E
40|$|An {{improved}} {{method of}} calibrating a large directional radio antenna {{of the type}} used in deep-space communication and radio astronomy has been developed. This method involves a raster-scanning-and-measurement technique denoted on-the-fly (OTF) mapping, applied in consideration {{of the results of}} a systematic analysis of the entire measurement procedure. Phenomena to which particular attention was paid in the analysis include (1) the noise characteristics of a total-power radiometer (TPR) that is used in the measurements and (2) tropospherically induced radiometer fluctuations. The method also involves the use of recently developed techniques for acquisition and reduction of data. In comparison with prior methods used to calibrate such antennas, this method yields an order-of-magnitude improvement in the precision of determinations of <b>antenna</b> <b>aperture</b> <b>efficiency,</b> and improvement by a factor of five or more in the precision of determination of pointing error and beam width. Prerequisite to a meaningful description of the present method is some background information concerning three aspects of the problem of calibrating an antenna of the type in question: In OTF mapping measurements in which a TPR is used, the desired data are the peak temperature corresponding to a radio source, the pointing offset when the antenna is commanded to point toward the source, and the shape of the main lobe of the antenna beam, all as functions of the antenna beam elevation and azimuth angles. These data enable one to calculate the (1) <b>antenna</b> <b>aperture</b> <b>efficiency</b> by comparing the measured peak temperature with that expected for a 100 -percent-efficient antenna, (2) the mechanical pointing error resulting from small misalignments of various parts of the antenna structure, and (3) misalignments of the antenna subreflector and other mirrors. For practical reasons having to do with obtaining adequate angular resolution and all-sky coverage, it is necessary to perform azimuth and elevation scans fairly rapidly. Many natural radio sources used in calibrating antennas are only approximately pointlike: some sources subtend angles greater than the beam width of a given antenna. In such a case, the antenna partially resolves the source structure and does not collect all of the radiation emitted by the source. This makes it necessary to estimate how much of the total known radiation from the source would actually be collected by the antenna if it were 100 -percent efficient. The resulting estimate, leading to a source-size correction factor, introduces another degree of uncertainty to the measurements. OTF mapping can remove this uncertaint...|$|E
50|$|In general, the <b>aperture</b> of an <b>antenna</b> is not {{directly}} related to its physical size. However some types of antennas, for example parabolic dishes and horns, have a physical aperture (opening) which collects the radio waves. In these <b>aperture</b> <b>antennas,</b> the effective <b>aperture</b> Aeff must always be less than the area of the <b>antenna's</b> physical <b>aperture</b> Aphys, as {{can be seen from the}} definition above. An <b>antenna's</b> <b>aperture</b> <b>efficiency,</b> ea is defined as the ratio of these two areas:The <b>aperture</b> <b>efficiency</b> is a dimensionless parameter between 0 and 1.0 that measures how close the antenna comes to using all the radio power entering its physical <b>aperture.</b> If the <b>antenna</b> were perfectly efficient, all the radio power falling within its physical aperture would be converted to electrical power delivered to the load attached to its output terminals, so these two areas would be equal Aeff = Aphys and the <b>aperture</b> <b>efficiency</b> would be 1.0. But all antennas have losses, such as power dissipated as heat in the resistance of its elements, nonuniform illumination by its feed, and radio waves scattered by structural supports and diffraction at the aperture edge, which reduce the power output. <b>Aperture</b> <b>efficiencies</b> of typical <b>antennas</b> vary from 0.35 to 0.70 but can range up to 0.90.|$|R
40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 13 - 15, 1981 / Bahia Hotel, San Diego, CaliforniaMultimode {{rectangular}} horn radiators {{have been}} in widespread use as reflector antenna feed elements for many years. These horns provide equal E and H planes over moderate bandwidths. With a few simple additional design considerations, however, these same horns can operate over two separate frequency bands. Dual mode operation is achieved by designing to prohibit generation of higher order beamshaping modes for lower operating band. Thus the horn operates as a square pyramidal horn at the low band and as a traditional multimode horn in the upper band. Upper band performance is not affected; however, efficiency in the lower band is somewhat less due to unequal beamshapes characteristic of square pyramidal horns. A horn utilizing these design concepts was developed and tested.

40|$|A novel {{method is}} {{presented}} to design single-feed high-gain EBG resonator antennas (ERAs) with significantly wider bandwidths. Dielectric contrast is introduced to 1 -D EBG superstructures composed of unprinted dielectric slabs, and the thicknesses {{of each of these}} slabs is optimized to achieve a wideband defect mode in a unit-cell model. Next, antennas are designed and their superstructure areas are truncated to increase the <b>antenna</b> bandwidth and <b>aperture</b> <b>efficiency</b> while decreasing <b>antenna</b> footprint.
