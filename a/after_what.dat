5|$|Heber was {{interested}} {{in all aspects of}} Indian life and quickly made friends, both with the local population and with the representatives of non-Anglican churches. Occasionally his easy manner and lavish hospitality clashed with the principles of the more puritan and evangelical of his clergy; one such, Isaac Wilson of the CMS, used a sermon to mount a direct attack on the bishop <b>after</b> <b>what</b> he considered were excessive celebrations following a baptismal service. Wilson was forced to apologise after Heber threatened him with a Consistory court.|$|E

5|$|In Albany, New York, a disk jockey named Bryan Jackson helped {{organize}} a relief effort for the Texas town {{of the same}} name, with sponsorship from radio station WOKO and a local supermarket chain. After raising six tons of emergency aid and $1,000 from area residents, a C-130 airplane was loaded with the provisions, but the plane was continuously grounded due to calls saying that Albany, Texas was not a disaster area and did not need the relief. <b>After</b> <b>what</b> was described by U.S. Senator Samuel S. Stratton as almost a comedy of errors, the flight {{was funded by the}} Defense Department and was able to take off. In addition, a sheriff dispatch in the Texas town mentioned that aid was possibly being sent from several other towns with the same name as well as from other Texas towns like Abilene.|$|E
5|$|The {{day after}} Clifford's death {{the bulk of}} the Yorkist and Lancastrian armies faced each other at the Battle of Towton. <b>After</b> <b>what</b> is now {{considered}} the biggest and possibly bloodiest battle ever to take place on English soil, the Lancastrians were routed, and the son of the duke of York was crowned King Edward IV. On 4 November 1461, at Edward's first parliament, Clifford was attainted and his estates and barony forfeited to the king; a large portion were later granted to the earl of Warwick. The story– which would later be repeated by George Edward Cokayne in his Complete Peerage– of how Clifford's widow, fearing her son, Henry, would be slain in retaliation for Rutland's death, sent him into hiding as a shepherd, is almost certainly a folklore. As Dr James Ross has pointed out, the young Henry Clifford was pardoned in 1472, and as early as 1466 was named publicly as receiving a bequest, although Ross does suggest that Henry may well have gone into hiding for a time from his father's enemies.|$|E
