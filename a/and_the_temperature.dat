5|$|Inconsistencies in the {{official}} accounts of Scott's death have been cited in conspiracy theories, which suggest that Scott died of a heroin overdose, or was killed by exhaust fumes redirected into the car, or that Kinnear did not exist.

5|$|The core of Neptune {{is likely}} {{composed}} of iron, nickel and silicates, with an interior model giving a mass about 1.2 {{times that of}} Earth.

5|$|Due to {{the warm}} waters of the Great Salt Lake, lake effect snowfalls are {{frequent}} phenomena of the surrounding area. Cold north, northwest, or west winds generally blow across the lake following {{the passage of a}} cold front, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>temperature</b> difference between the warm lake and the cool air can form clouds that lead to precipitation downwind of the lake. It is typically heaviest from eastern Tooele County east and north into central Davis County. It can deposit excessive snowfall amounts, generally with a narrow band of snow highly dependent on the direction the wind is blowing.|$|E
50|$|Khammam {{experiences}} typical Indian climatic conditions. Summer {{season is}} hot <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>temperatures</b> can climb rapidly during the day.

5|$|Modern {{experimental}} {{archaeology and}} history re-enactment have shown {{there is only}} a very short step from the Catalan forge to the true blast furnace, where the iron is gained as pig iron in liquid phase. Usually, obtaining the iron in liquid phase is actually undesired, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>temperature</b> is intentionally kept below the melting point of iron, since while removing the solid bloom mechanically is tedious and means batch process instead of continuous process, it is almost pure iron and can be worked immediately. On the other hand, pig iron is the eutectic mixture of carbon and iron and needs to be described to produce steel or wrought iron, which was extremely tedious in the Middle Ages.|$|E
5|$|Paul Drude in 1900 {{proposed}} the first theoretical {{model for a}} classical electron moving through a metallic solid. Drude's model described properties of metals {{in terms of a}} gas of free electrons, and was the first microscopic model to explain empirical observations such as the Wiedemann–Franz law. However, despite the success of Drude's free electron model, it had one notable problem: it was unable to correctly explain the electronic contribution to the specific heat and magnetic properties of metals, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>temperature</b> dependence of resistivity at low temperatures.|$|E
5|$|Rousseau was {{enthusiastic}} and sent his cycling editor, Victor Breyer, {{to find a}} route. Breyer travelled to Amiens in a Panhard driven by his colleague, Paul Meyan. The following morning Breyer— later deputy organiser of the Tour de France and a leading official of the Union Cycliste Internationale - continued by bike. The wind blew, the rain fell <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>temperature</b> dropped. Breyer reached Roubaix filthy and exhausted {{after a day of}} riding on cobbles (setts). He swore he would send a telegram to Minart urging him to drop the idea, saying it was dangerous to send a race the way he had just ridden. But that evening a meal and drinks with the team from Roubaix changed his mind.|$|E

5|$|When helium is {{exhausted}} at {{the core}} of a massive star, the core contracts <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>temperature</b> and pressure rises enough to fuse carbon (see Carbon-burning process). This process continues, with the successive stages being fueled by neon (see neon-burning process), oxygen (see oxygen-burning process), and silicon (see silicon-burning process). Near the end of the star's life, fusion continues along a series of onion-layer shells within a massive star. Each shell fuses a different element, with the outermost shell fusing hydrogen; the next shell fusing helium, and so forth.|$|E
25|$|The wind {{gradient}} <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>temperature</b> gradient {{can also have}} complex interactions. For example, a foghorn can be audible at a place near the source, and a distant place, {{but not in a}} sound shadow between them.|$|E
25|$|The {{climate of}} the region is {{temperate}} with high thermal aptitude. The maximum temperatures are generally 30°C in the summer, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>temperature</b> does not fall below -20°C during the winter (approximately the end of April {{to the beginning of}} September).|$|E

25|$|A {{running engine}} is much hotter than room {{temperature}} <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>temperature</b> {{in various parts}} of the system vary widely. This affects the actual flow, fuel effects as well as the dynamic wave effects in the engine which do not exist on the flow bench.|$|E

When the boiling phenomenon had occurred <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>temperatures</b> have reached almost a steady state, {{the values of the}} liquid flow rate or the heat flux of the power source were varied <b>and</b> <b>the</b> same procedure was repeated.
