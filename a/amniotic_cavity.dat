25|$|Development of {{the mature}} kidney begins between weeks 5 and 7 of gestation. Fetal urine {{production}} begins in early gestation and comprises {{the majority of}} the amniotic fluid {{in the second and third}} trimesters of pregnancy. The fetus continuously swallows amniotic fluid, which is reabsorbed by the gastrointestinal tract and then reintroduced into the <b>amniotic</b> <b>cavity</b> by the kidneys via urination. Oligohydramnios occurs if the volume of amniotic fluid is less than normal for the corresponding period of gestation. The fetal urine is critical to the proper development of the lungs by aiding in the expansion of the airways - alveoli, by means of hydrodynamic pressure and by also supplying proline which is a critical amino acid for lung development. Alveoli are the small sacs in the lungs that exchange oxygen with the blood. If the alveoli, and thereby the lungs, are underdeveloped at the time of birth the infant will not be able to breathe air properly and will go into respiratory distress shortly after birth due to pulmonary hypoplasia (underdeveloped lungs). This is the primary cause of death to Potter sequence infants secondary to renal failure. The fetal urine also serves to cushion the fetus from being compressed by the mother's uterus as it grows.|$|E
60|$|Section 29. The {{nature of}} the amnion will be {{understood}} by following Figures 4b, 5, and 6 on Sheet 23. The three embryonic layers are indicated by broken lines, dots, and black lines, {{just as they are}} in the frog diagrams. Not only is the embryo slowly pinched off from the yolk sac (y.s.), but, as the yolk is absorbed beneath it, and it grows in size, it sinks into the space thus made, the extra-embryonic somatopleur and epiblast rise up round it as two folds, which are seen closing in 5, and closed in 6, over the dorsal side of the young chick. In this way a cavity, a., lined by epiblast, and called the <b>amniotic</b> <b>cavity,</b> is formed. Dorsal to this, in 6, comes a space lined by somatic mesoblast, and continuous with p.p., the pleuro-peritoneal cavity, or body cavity of the embryo. Outside this, again, is a layer, of somatopleur internally and epiblast externally, the false amnion (f.a.), which is continuous with the serous membrane (s.m.) enclosing the rest of the egg. The student should, carefully copy these diagrams, with coloured pencils or inks for the different layers, and should compare them with the more realistic renderings of Figures 2, 5, and 8, Sheet 24.|$|E

40|$|Hydrops amnii, {{also known}} as hydramnion, or hydramnios, is a term taken from medical {{terminology}} where in the female the allantois ceases to exist at an early date and the dropsy naturally occurs in the amnion. In veterinary obstetrics this term is somewhat of a misnomer since in domestic animals there exists two ample cavities of the fetal envelops, the amniotic and allantoic, which regularly contains fluids in varying amounts. In veterinary obstetrics the term is used to indicate an excessive amount of fluid in the allantoic or the <b>amniotic</b> <b>cavities.</b> These two cavities communicate through the urethra-urinary bladder-urachus passageway and approximately equal pressure is maintained within the two cavities.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: We {{sought to}} {{determine}} amnioticfluid (AF) volume in diamniotic twin gestations and to relate these findings to estimates using standard ultrasonic techniques. METHODS: In this prospective study, AF volume in 45 diamniotic twin gestations at 27 - 38 weeks was assessed by sonography using the largest vertical pocket technique, the AF index, and the two-diameter pocket method. After the three different sonographic estimations ofAF volume, the true amount ofAF was determined using amniocentesis and a dye-dilution technique. RESULTS: The individual sac AF volume was less than 500 mL in 35 <b>amniotic</b> <b>cavities,</b> 500 - 2000 mL in 48 sacs, and greater than 2000 mL in seven. Individual AF volume between 500 and 2000 mL was correctly predicted by sonographic use of the largest vertical pocket in 47 of 48 patients (98 %), the AF index in 47 of 48 (98 %), and the two-diameter pocket method in 39 of 48 (81 %). Estimation ofAF volume less than 500 mL was significantly more accurate using the two-diameterpocket method compared with either the AF index (P =. 015) or the largest vertical pocket technique (P <. 0001).

During adaptation, 6 amino acid substitutions occurred: 4 in HA (G 186 V, S 219 F, V 226 I, V 309 I) and 2 in NA (E 119 Q, Q 136 K). These substitutions allowed binding to SAα 2, 3 Gal- and SAα 2, 6 Gal-containing receptors, conferred SAα 2, 3 Gal specificity, and preserved antigenicity. Two HA substitutions (G 186 V, V 226 I) were sufficient to improve growth. Changing 2 NA residues (E 119 Q, Q 136 K) did not improve growth, and adaptation did not result in the HA changes H 183 L, D 188 Y, and V 226 A found by others.

50|$|At the {{beginning}} of the second week, a cavity appears within the inner cell mass and when it enlarges it becomes the <b>amniotic</b> <b>cavity.</b> The floor of the <b>amniotic</b> <b>cavity</b> is formed by the epiblast. Epiblast migrates between the epiblastic disc and trophoblast. In this way the epiblastic cells migrate between the embryoblast and trophoblast. The floor is formed by the epiblast which later on transforms to ectoderm while the remaining cells which are present between the embryoblast and trophoblast are called amnioblasts (flattened cells). These cells are also derived from epiblast which is transformed into ectoderm.|$|E
5000|$|Bilaminar {{blastocyst}} or Bilaminar disc {{refers to}} the [...] epiblast and the hypoblast, evolved from the embryoblast. These two layers are sandwiched between two balloons: the primitive yolk sac and the <b>amniotic</b> <b>cavity.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{floor of}} the <b>amniotic</b> <b>cavity</b> is formed by the {{embryonic}} disc (or embryonic disk) composed of a layer of prismatic cells, the embryonic ectoderm, derived from the inner cell-mass and lying in apposition with the endoderm.|$|E
50|$|The zygote first {{transformed}} into a morula through cleavage and then more divisions lead to a blastocyst that consisted of just a trophoblast, and an embryoblast. By {{the end of the}} first week, the embryoblast has begun separating into two layers: the epiblast and hypoblast also called the primitive endoderm. At the embryonic pole of the blastocyst, the <b>amniotic</b> <b>cavity</b> finds a home between the epiblast and the trophoblast. The epiblast stretches to surround the cavity very quickly and this layer of the epiblast becomes known as the amnion, which is one of the four extraembryonic membranes. The rest of the hypoblast and epiblast, not including the amnion, is what contributes to the bilaminar embryonic disc (bilaminar blastoderm/blastocyst), which sits between the <b>amniotic</b> <b>cavity</b> and the blastocyst cavity. The embryo proper and extramembryonic membranes are later derived from the embryonic disc.|$|E
50|$|This, the amniotic fold, first {{makes its}} {{appearance}} at the cephalic extremity, and subsequently at the caudal end and sides of the embryo, and gradually rising more and more, its different parts meet and fuse over the dorsal aspect of the embryo, and enclose a cavity, the <b>amniotic</b> <b>cavity.</b> This kind of amnion is known as pleuroamnion (formed by folding), as opposed to schyzoamnion (formed by delamination).|$|E
50|$|The embryoblast {{forms an}} {{embryonic}} disc, {{which is a}} bilaminar disc of two layers, an upper layer called the epiblast (primitive ectoderm) and a lower layer called the hypoblast (primitive endoderm). The disc is stretched between what will become the <b>amniotic</b> <b>cavity</b> and the yolk sac. The epiblast is adjacent to the trophoblast and made of columnar cells; the hypoblast is closest to the blastocyst cavity and made of cuboidal cells. The epiblast migrates away from the trophoblast downwards, forming the <b>amniotic</b> <b>cavity,</b> the lining of which is formed from amnioblasts developed from the epiblast. The hypoblast is pushed down and forms the yolk sac (exocoelomic cavity) lining. Some hypoblast cells migrate along the inner cytotrophoblast lining of the blastocoel, secreting an extracellular matrix along the way. These hypoblast cells and extracellular matrix are called Heuser's membrane (or the exocoelomic membrane), and they cover the blastocoel to form the yolk sac (or exocoelomic cavity). Cells of the epiblast migrate along the outer edges of this reticulum and form the extraembryonic mesoderm; this disrupts the extraembryonic reticulum. Soon pockets form in the reticulum, which ultimately coalesce to form the chorionic cavity or extraembryonic coelom.|$|E
50|$|The cells {{surrounding}} the blastocyst now destroy {{cells in the}} uterine lining, forming small pools of blood, which in turn stimulate the production of capillaries. This is the first stage {{in the growth of}} the placenta. The inner cell mass of the blastocyst divides rapidly, forming two layers. The top layer becomes the embryo, and cells from there occupy the <b>amniotic</b> <b>cavity.</b> At the same time, the bottom layer forms a small sac (if the cells begin developing in an abnormal position, an ectopic gestation may also occur at this point).|$|E
50|$|Most chorioangiomas are asymptomatic. They are {{generally}} {{picked up in}} second trimester scan. Chorioangioma {{is seen as a}} hypo- or hyperechoic circumscribed mass that is distinct from the placenta at gray-scale US examination. Large lesions may contain fibrous septa. It is seen protruding into the <b>amniotic</b> <b>cavity</b> near the insertion of the cord. Doppler examination shows anechoic cystic areas, with pulsatile flow in spectral analysis. Some chorioangiomas may be solid masses, and may not be identifiable in gray-scale imaging. Therefore, the investigation of choice is Colour Doppler, which also distinguishes it from placental hematoma.|$|E
50|$|The amniotic sac, {{commonly}} called {{the bag of}} waters, sometimes the membranes, is the sac in which the fetus develops in amniotes. It is a thin but tough transparent pair of membranes that hold a developing embryo (and later fetus) until shortly before birth. The inner of these fetal membranes, the amnion, encloses the <b>amniotic</b> <b>cavity,</b> containing the amniotic fluid and the fetus. The outer membrane, the chorion, contains the amnion and {{is part of the}} placenta. On the outer side, the amniotic sac is connected to the yolk sac, the allantois and, via the umbilical cord, to the placenta.|$|E
50|$|In 1614 Mercier (also {{shown as}} Mercerus) {{described}} ovarian pregnancy {{for the first}} time, as a condition separate from a tubal pregnancy. Once the study of physiology emerged, Boehmer classified extra-uterine pregnancy into three classes: abdominal, ovarian, and tubal. There were many doubters that such a condition existed, particularly Mayer, who wrote an essay not only denying the existence of ovarian pregnancy, but demonstrating that recorded cases to that time were other conditions. Then Cohnstein proposed four criteria that {{would need to be}} present for ovarian pregnancy exist. His requirements were: 1) absence of the ovary on the side in which the alleged pregnancy was located; 2) connection of the uterus and sac via an ovarian ligament; 3) cylindrical tissue must line the layers of the sac with direct connection between the tunica albuginea and sac wall; and 4) evidence of the <b>amniotic</b> <b>cavity</b> connection to the ovarian follicle or corpus luteum. These were replaced by Otto Spiegelberg's criteria in 1878, which have been used into the 20th century with additions and modifications.|$|E
5000|$|Before gastrulation, {{the cells}} of the {{trophoblast}} become differentiated into two strata: The outer stratum forms a syncytium (i.e., a layer of protoplasm studded with nuclei, but showing no evidence of subdivision into cells), termed the syncytiotrophoblast, while the inner layer, the cytotrophoblast or [...] "Layer of Langhans," [...] consists of well-defined cells. As already stated, {{the cells of}} the trophoblast do not contribute to the formation of the embryo proper; they form the ectoderm of the chorion and play an important part {{in the development of the}} placenta. On the deep surface of the inner cell mass, a layer of flattened cells, called the endoderm, is differentiated and quickly assumes the form of a small sac, called the yolk sac. Spaces appear between the remaining cells of the mass and, by the enlargement and coalescence of these spaces, a cavity called the <b>amniotic</b> <b>cavity</b> is gradually developed. The floor of this cavity is formed by the embryonic disk, which is composed of a layer of prismatic cells, the embryonic ectoderm, derived from the inner cell mass and lying in apposition with the endoderm.|$|E
50|$|Development of {{the mature}} kidney begins between weeks 5 and 7 of gestation. Fetal urine {{production}} begins in early gestation and comprises {{the majority of}} the amniotic fluid {{in the second and third}} trimesters of pregnancy. The fetus continuously swallows amniotic fluid, which is reabsorbed by the gastrointestinal tract and then reintroduced into the <b>amniotic</b> <b>cavity</b> by the kidneys via urination.

50|$|The {{primitive}} streak, {{a linear}} band of cells {{formed by the}} migrating epiblast, appears, and this {{marks the beginning of}} gastrulation, which takes place around the seventeenth day (week 3) after fertilisation. The process of gastrulation reorganises the two-layer embryo into a three-layer embryo, and also gives the embryo its specific head-to-tail, and front-to-back orientation, by way of the primitive streak which establishes bilateral symmetry. A primitive node (or primitive knot) forms in front of the primitive streak which is the organiser of neurulation. A primitive pit forms as a depression in the centre of the primitive node which connects to the notochord which lies directly underneath. The node has arisen from epiblasts of the <b>amniotic</b> <b>cavity</b> floor, and it is this node that induces the formation of the neural plate which serves {{as the basis for the}} nervous system. The neural plate will form opposite the primitive streak from ectodermal tissue which thickens and flattens into the neural plate. The epiblast in that region moves down into the streak at the location of the primitive pit where the process called ingression, which leads to the formation of the mesoderm takes place. This ingression sees the cells from the epiblast move into the primitive streak in an epithelial-mesenchymal transition; epithelial cells become mesenchymal stem cells, multipotent stromal cells that can differentiate into various cell types. The hypoblast is pushed out of the way and goes on to form the amnion.The epiblast keeps moving and forms a second layer, the mesoderm. The epiblast has now differentiated into the three germ layers of the embryo, so that the bilaminar disc is now a trilaminar disc, the gastrula.|$|E
