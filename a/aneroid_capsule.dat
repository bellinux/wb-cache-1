5|$|The Meteorological Flight {{first came}} into being on 1 November 1924. Its main {{priority}} was identifying temperature, pressure, humidity and general weather conditions being logged at sea level to 18,000 feet. These flights were named THUM (Temperature/Humidity). Changes in air conditions usually came in the Atlantic in the west. The Meteorological Office (MET) relied on reports from ships in this regard. The need for aircraft for operations was ignored in 1939 owing to lack of aircraft. However, in June 1940, Bomber Command started to become anxious about base landing conditions and the accuracy of general forecasts. In response from strong support, No. 403 Squadron RAF, No. 404 Squadron RAF and No. 405 Squadron RAF were formed for this purpose. The routes requested by the MET usually involved distances of up to 1,000nm. Hudsons were ideal for this operation, but since none were available Bristol Blenheims filled the role. On 1 March 1941 Coastal Command assumed operational control of all the units. They were redesignated No. 1401 to 1406 flights. All were handed over to No. 18 Group RAF. In October 1940, two more flights, 1407 and 1408 were sent to Iceland to begin operations from there. Several types of single engine aircraft were used; Gloster Gladiators, Hawker Hurricanes and Supermarine Spitfires. Operations were conducted mostly up to 15,000 feet in wartime as the <b>aneroid</b> <b>capsule</b> altimeter {{was not able to}} give accurate readings. A Mk. 14B ICAN altimeter was used. The aircraft had to be flown at the height measured for two minutes to allow the readings to settle or stabilise.|$|E

50|$|The {{altimeter}} {{shows the}} aircraft's altitude above sea-level {{by measuring the}} difference between the pressure in a stack of <b>aneroid</b> <b>capsules</b> inside the altimeter and the atmospheric pressure obtained through the static system. It is adjustable for local barometric pressure which must be set correctly to obtain accurate altitude readings. As the aircraft ascends, the capsules expand and the static pressure drops, causing the altimeter to indicate a higher altitude. The opposite effect occurs when descending. With the advancement in aviation and increased altitude ceiling, the altimeter dial had to be altered for use both at higher and lower altitudes. Hence when the needles were indicating lower altitudes i.e. the first 360-degree operation of the pointers was delineated by the appearance of a small window with oblique lines warning the pilot {{that he or she is}} nearer to the ground. This modification was introduced in the early sixties after the recurrence of air accidents caused by the confusion in the pilot's mind. At higher altitudes, the window will disappear.|$|R

30|$|EXAMPLE 2 : A {{digital camera}} returns an image (Observation), with a spatial {{receptive}} field {{equal to the}} size of the aperture and a temporal receptive window equal to the shutter speed. The aperture is “the size of the adjustable opening inside the lens, which determines how much light passes through the lens to strike the image sensor” [64], and the shutter speed is “the amount of time the digital camera’s shutter remains open when capturing a photograph” [65]. The receptor of the camera is the image sensor, but the size of the aperture determines the actual portion of the image sensor that is stimulated during the production of an image. The shutter speed determines the duration of the image sensor’s exposure to light. It is acknowledged here that resolution has been defined in the literature (for example, [66]) as a function of imaging aperture and the wavelength of the light. This is the optical resolution (which has sometimes also been called spatial resolution). It is inversely correlated with aperture, and measures the shortest distance between two points on an image that can still be distinguished by the observer. However, in line with previous work [5, 67], the term ‘discrimination’ is reserved for the shortest distance between two points on an image that can still be distinguished by the observer (the optical resolution). Approximating spatial resolution (as defined in this work, see Section Introduction) with spatial receptive field intends to inform about a different notion, and tell instead about the portion of the observer which was stimulated while producing the observation. It also reflects intuition, namely: the larger the aperture, the smaller the optical resolution (smallest details the lens can resolve), and consequently the larger the amount of spatial detail in the final image (spatial resolution). Further examples of receptors for technical observers include thermistors (for medical digital thermometers), bulbs (for clinical mercury thermometers), telescopes (for laser altimeters), <b>aneroid</b> <b>capsules</b> (for pressure altimeters), bulbs (for psychrometers), to name a few.|$|R
2500|$|An aneroid {{barometer}} is {{an instrument for}} measuring pressure as a method that does not involve liquid. Invented in 1844 by French scientist Lucien Vidi, the {{aneroid barometer}} uses a small, flexible metal box called an <b>aneroid</b> cell (<b>capsule),</b> which is made from an alloy of beryllium and copper. The evacuated capsule (or usually several capsules, stacked to add up their movements) is prevented from collapsing by a strong spring. Small changes in external air pressure cause the cell to expand or contract. [...] This expansion and contraction drives mechanical levers such that the tiny movements of the capsule are amplified and displayed {{on the face of}} the aneroid barometer. [...] Many models include a manually set needle which is used to mark the current measurement so a change can be seen. [...] In addition, the mechanism is made deliberately [...] "stiff" [...] so that tapping the barometer reveals whether the pressure is rising or falling as the pointer moves. This type of barometer is common in homes and in recreational boats, as well as small aircraft. It is also used in meteorology, mostly in barographs and as a pressure instrument in radiosondes.|$|R
40|$|The RS 2 - 91 {{rawinsonde}} system {{replaced the}} RS 2 - 80 rawinsonde system on January 1, 1995 for upper-air observations at Syowa Station, Antarctica. In {{order to determine}} the properties of RS 2 - 91 and RS 2 - 80,a total of 45 flights were carried out with the two types of link radiosondes at Syowa Station, from December 1994 to September 1995. The RS 2 - 80 rawinsonde consists of a rod thermistor painted in white, a carbon hygristor and a baroswitch <b>aneroid</b> <b>capsule</b> for measuring temperature, humidity and pressure, respectively. The RS 2 - 91 rawinsonde consists of a rod thermistor coated with vacuum-evaporated aluminum, a thin capacitor film and a capacitive <b>aneroid</b> <b>capsule,</b> respectively. The solar radiation correction is applied for air temperature measurements with both the RS 2 - 91 and RS 2 - 80. The differences of temperatures measured at standard pressure levels were within approximately ± 1. 5 ℃ in the stratosphere during this period. The characteristic tendencies are as follows. In the stratosphere in the daytime, the temperatures measured by RS 2 - 91 were lower than those measured by RS 2 - 80 in the winter, under low temperature conditions (below - 80 ℃). In the fall (approximately - 50 ℃), however, those measured by RS 2 - 91 were higher than those measured by RS 2 - 80...|$|E
