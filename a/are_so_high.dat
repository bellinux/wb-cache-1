5|$|Pele {{was born}} to the female spirit Haumea, or Hina, who, like all Hawaiian gods and goddesses, descended from the supreme beings, Papa, or Earth Mother, and Wakea, or Sky Father. According to the myth, Pele {{originally}} lived on Kauai, when her older sister Nāmaka, the Goddess of the Sea, attacked her for seducing her husband. Pele fled southeast to the island of Oahu. When forced by Nāmaka to flee again, Pele moved southeast to Maui and finally to Hawaii, where she {{still lives in the}} Halemaumau Crater at the summit of Kīlauea. There she was safe, because the slopes of the volcano <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>high</b> that even Nāmaka's mighty waves could not reach her. Pele's mythical flight, which alludes to an eternal struggle between volcanic islands and ocean waves, is consistent with geologic evidence about the ages of the islands decreasing to the southeast.|$|E

25|$|One of five {{problems}} can prevent a fire from lighting properly: wet wood, wet weather, too little tinder, too much wind, or {{a lack of}} oxygen. Rain will douse a fire, but a combination of wind and fog also has a stifling effect. Metal fire rings generally {{do a good job of}} keeping out wind, but some of them <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>high</b> as to impede the circulation of oxygen in a small fire. To make matters worse, these tall fire rings also make it very difficult to blow on the fire properly.|$|E

25|$|The Matanza-Riachuelo river (MR), a {{tributary}} of the Río de la Plata (La Plata River), is the most contaminated river basin in Argentina and {{considered one of the most}} polluted water bodies in the world. Pollution levels in Buenos Aires’ rivers <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>high</b> that they have been considered “open sewers”, making pollution the greatest environmental risk for the metropolitan area. Pollution levels have increased steadily as urbanization and industrial growth have continuously increased in the metropolitan area of Buenos Aires. It is estimated that more than 4,000 industrial facilities are located in the lower and middle sections of the basin. Almost all of these industries discharge untreated effluents into the drainage system or directly into the MR River. In addition to high levels of organic pollution, these discharges contribute toxic contaminants such as heavy metals from petrochemical industries, tanneries, and meat processing facilities. More specifically, the Riacheuleo has levels of Lead, Zinc and Chrome 50 times higher than the legal limit in Argentina; 25% is from industrial sewage and waste, while the remaining 75% originates from domestic sources. The sudden onset of environmental and social degradation of the MR basin has resulted from limited investment in public infrastructure, poor environmental management, lack of adequate urban and industrial planning, and limited public infrastructure investment.|$|E

500|$|In {{the fourth}} chapter, [...] "Pyramid Schemes", the fates of the Roman and Mayan civilisations are compared; both peaked with {{centralised}} empires but ended with power being diffused to their periphery {{as the center}} collapsed and ultra-conservative leadership refused reformations. Anthropologist Joseph Tainter's explanation for {{the fall of the}} Roman Empire is invoked, that [...] "complex systems inevitably succumb to diminishing returns" [...] so that the costs of operating an empire <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>high</b> that alternatives are implemented. Two examples of civilisations that have been sustainable are described: China and Egypt. Both had an abundance of resources, particularly topsoil, and used farming methods that worked with, rather than against, natural cycles, and settlement patterns that did not exceed, or permanently damage, the carrying capacity of the local environment.|$|E

500|$|At ground level, shelf {{clouds and}} roll clouds {{can be seen}} at the leading edge of outflow boundaries. [...] Through {{satellite}} imagery, an arc cloud is visible as an arc of low clouds spreading out from a thunderstorm. If the skies are cloudy behind the arc, or if the arc is moving quickly, high wind gusts are likely behind the gust front. [...] Sometimes a gust front can be seen on weather radar, showing as a thin arc or line of weak radar echos pushing out from a collapsing storm. The thin line of weak radar echoes is known as a fine line. [...] Occasionally, winds caused by the gust front <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>high</b> in velocity that they also show up on radar. This cool outdraft can then energize other storms which it hits by assisting in updrafts. Gust fronts colliding from two storms can even create new storms. Usually, however, no rain accompanies the shifting winds. An expansion of the rain shaft near ground level, in the general shape of a human foot, is a telltale sign of a downburst. Gustnadoes, short-lived vertical circulations near ground level, can be spawned by outflow boundaries.|$|E
500|$|People {{who have}} two mutated {{copies of the}} BRCA2 gene have one type of Fanconi anemia. This {{condition}} is caused by extremely reduced levels of the BRCA2 protein in cells, which allows the accumulation of damaged DNA. Patients with Fanconi anemia are prone to several types of leukemia (a type of blood cell cancer); solid tumors, particularly of the head, neck, skin, and reproductive organs; and bone marrow suppression (reduced blood cell production that leads to anemia). [...] Women having inherited a defective BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene have risks for breast and ovarian cancer that <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>high</b> and seem so selective that many mutation carriers choose to have prophylactic surgery. There has been much conjecture to explain such apparently striking tissue specificity. Major determinants of where BRCA1 and BRCA2 associated hereditary cancers occur are related to tissue specificity of the cancer pathogen, the agent that causes chronic inflammation or the carcinogen. The target tissue may have receptors for the pathogen, become selectively exposed to carcinogens and an infectious process. An innate genomic deficit impairs normal responses and exacerbates the susceptibility to disease in organ targets. This theory also fits data for several tumor suppressors beyond BRCA1 or BRCA2. A major advantage of this model is that it suggests there are some options in addition to prophylactic surgery.|$|E
2500|$|When the pH of acid mine {{drainage}} {{is raised}} past 3, either through contact with fresh water or neutralizing minerals, previously soluble iron(III) ions precipitate as iron(III) hydroxide, a yellow-orange solid colloquially known as yellow boy. Other types of iron precipitates are possible, including iron oxides and oxyhydroxides. All these precipitates can discolor water and smother {{plant and animal}} life on the streambed, disrupting stream ecosystems (a specific offense under the Fisheries Act in Canada). The process also produces additional hydrogen ions, which can further decrease pH. [...] In some cases, the concentrations of iron hydroxides in yellow boy <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>high,</b> the precipitate can be recovered for commercial use in pigments.|$|E

2500|$|As {{opposed to}} all other sumo ranks yokozuna cannot be demoted. [...] A yokozuna is {{expected}} to retire if {{he can no longer}} compete {{at the peak of the}} sport or in some cases if he is deemed to have not upheld the dignity of the rank. [...] Expectations <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>high</b> that, even in the course of one tournament, a yokozuna who early on appears to be headed for a losing tournament will feel the pressure to retire; there are many cases of yokozuna dropping out mid-tournament with a real or imagined injury to avoid a make-koshi (a losing record) and the expectation to retire. These expectations are a large part of the reason that the promotion criteria for yokozuna are so strict in the first place.|$|E
2500|$|Various biotechnological {{processes}} {{have been}} developed for industrial scale riboflavin biosynthesis using different microorganisms, including filamentous fungi such as Ashbya gossypii, Candida famata and Candida flaveri, [...] as well as the bacteria Corynebacterium ammoniagenes and Bacillus subtilis. The latter organism has been genetically modified to both increase the bacteria's production of riboflavin and to introduce an antibiotic (ampicillin) resistance marker, and is now successfully employed at a commercial scale to produce riboflavin for feed and food fortification purposes. The chemical company BASF has installed a plant in South Korea, which is specialized on riboflavin production using Ashbya gossypii. The concentrations of riboflavin in their modified strain <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>high,</b> that the mycelium has a reddish/brownish color and accumulates riboflavin crystals in the vacuoles, which will eventually burst the mycelium. Riboflavin is sometimes overproduced, possibly as a protective mechanism, by certain bacteria in the presence of high concentrations of hydrocarbons or aromatic compounds. [...] One such organism is Micrococcus luteus (American Type Culture Collection strain number ATCC 49442), which develops a yellow color due to production of riboflavin while growing on pyridine, but not when grown on other substrates, such as succinic acid.|$|E
2500|$|In 2013, {{more than}} 100 cancer specialists {{published}} {{a letter in}} Blood saying that the prices of many new cancer drugs, including imatinib, <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>high</b> {{that people in the}} United States couldn't afford them, and that the level of prices, and profits, was so high as to be immoral. Signatories of the letter included Brian Druker, Carlo Gambacorti-Passerini, and John Goldman, developers of imatinib. [...] They wrote that in 2001, imatinib was priced at $30,000 a year, which was based on the price of interferon, then the standard treatment, and that at this price Novartis would have recouped its initial development costs in two years. [...] They wrote that after unexpectedly becoming a blockbuster, Novartis increased the price to $92,000 per year in 2012, with annual revenues of $4.7 billion. [...] Other physicians have complained about the cost. By 2016, the average wholesale price had increased to $120,000 a year, according to an analysis prepared for the Washington Post by Stacie Dusetzina of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. When competitive drugs came on the market, they were sold at a higher price to reflect the smaller population, and Novartis raised the price of Gleevec to match them.|$|E
