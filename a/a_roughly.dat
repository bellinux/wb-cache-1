5|$|Alveoli {{consist of}} {{two types of}} {{alveolar}} cell and an alveolar macrophage. The two types of cell are known as type I and type II alveolar cells (also known as pneumocytes). Types I and II make up the walls and alveolar septa. Type I cells provide 95% of the surface area of each alveoli and are flat ("squamous"), and Type II cells generally cluster {{in the corners of}} the alveoli and have a cuboidal shape. Despite this, cells occur in <b>a</b> <b>roughly</b> equal ratio of 1:1 or 6:4.|$|E
5|$|As 241Am has <b>a</b> <b>roughly</b> similar {{half-life}} to 238Pu (432.2 years vs. 87 years), it {{has been}} proposed as an active element of radioisotope thermoelectric generators, for example in spacecraft. Although americium produces less heat and electricity – the power yield is 114.7mW/g for 241Am and 6.31mW/g for 243Am (cf. 390mW/g for 238Pu) – and its radiation poses more threat to humans owing to neutron emission, the European Space Agency is considering using americium for its space probes.|$|E

5|$|Determining {{the nature}} of the planet has not been straightforward; a 2002 paper hypothesizes that the clumps are caused by <b>a</b> <b>roughly</b> Jupiter-mass planet on an {{eccentric}} orbit. Dust would collect in orbits that have mean-motion resonances with this planet—where their orbital periods form integer fractions with the period of the planet—producing the resulting clumpiness.|$|E
5|$|During {{a central}} eclipse, the Moon's umbra (or antumbra, {{in the case}} of an annular eclipse) moves rapidly from west to east across the Earth. The Earth is also {{rotating}} from west to east, at about 28km/min at the Equator, but as the Moon is moving in the same direction as the Earth's spin at about 61km/min, the umbra almost always appears to move in <b>a</b> <b>roughly</b> west-east direction across a map of the Earth at the speed of the Moon's orbital velocity minus the Earth's rotational velocity.|$|E
5|$|From 1980 on, {{a better}} {{understanding}} of dinosaur biomechanics, and studies by palaeontologists Andreas Christian and Holger Preuschoft on the resistance to bending of the back of Plateosaurus, led to widespread acceptance of an erect, digitigrade limb posture and <b>a</b> <b>roughly</b> horizontal position of the back. Many researchers were of the opinion that Plateosaurus could use both quadrupedal gaits (for slow speeds) and bipedal gaits (for rapid locomotion), and Wellnhofer insisted that the tail curved strongly downward, making a bipedal posture impossible. However, Moser showed that the tail was in fact straight.|$|E

5|$|Geological {{evidence}} shows the Thera volcano erupted numerous times over {{several hundred thousand}} years before the Minoan eruption. In a repeating process, the volcano would violently erupt, then eventually collapse into <b>a</b> <b>roughly</b> circular seawater-filled caldera, with numerous small islands forming the circle. The caldera would slowly refill with magma, building a new volcano, which erupted and then collapsed in an ongoing cyclical process.|$|E
5|$|In 2003 it was {{hypothesized}} that these clumps could be caused by <b>a</b> <b>roughly</b> Neptune-mass planet having migrated from 40 to 65AU over 56millionyears, an orbit large enough to allow the formation of smaller rocky planets closer to Vega. The migration of this planet would likely require gravitational interaction with a second, higher-mass planet in a smaller orbit.|$|E
