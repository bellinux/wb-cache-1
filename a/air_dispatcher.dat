25|$|In 1973, former Laotian General Thao Ma {{was living}} in exile in Bangkok, Thailand, where he worked as an <b>air</b> <b>dispatcher</b> for Air France for $270 per month. By the {{beginning}} of August, a deal was being thrashed out for a coalition government that would include the Laotian communist insurrectionists. Several Royal Lao Army officers traveled to Bangkok to keep Thao Ma posted on events. Rumors of a potential coup by Thao Ma began to surface in the Laotian capital of Vientiane.|$|E
5000|$|On the 12 May 1967 {{the unit}} was renamed 176 AD Company and was {{relocated}} from Vung Tau to Nui Dat, where it remained {{until the last}} <b>Air</b> <b>Dispatcher</b> returned to Australia on the 27 February 1972. At this time, while 176 AD Company was the operational unit [...] "in country", the Australian-based unit at Wallgrove, New South Wales was renamed 186 AD Company acting as support. Just after the Vietnam War, Air Dispatch in Australia underwent command structural changes {{in the form of}} renaming the 1st Army Air Supply Organisation to the 1st Air Transport Support Regiment.|$|E
50|$|The Aviation Corps utilises {{soldiers}} from various other Army corps. The Royal Australian Corps of Transport trains and provides <b>air</b> <b>dispatchers,</b> while the Royal Australian Electrical and Mechanical Engineers trains aircraft structural fitters, who maintain aircraft life support equipment, and avionics technicians. Members of the Aviation Corps {{are entitled to}} wear a sky blue beret.|$|R

50|$|The {{programme}} captured dramatic {{footage of}} {{the aftermath of the}} Cumbria shootings during Summer 2010. The team also filmed what is thought to be the first footage of a patient - <b>air</b> ambulance <b>dispatcher</b> Chris Solomons - actually suffering a heart attack, going into cardiac arrest and being revived with CPR and a defibrillator. This is now widely used around the world as a training aid for police, firefighters, air ambulance crews and paramedics.|$|R
50|$|Ventspils Airport {{was founded}} in 1975. One asphalt-concrete runway (1298 x 32 m) and an apron (100 x 100 m) were built. At that time there was an <b>air</b> control <b>dispatchers</b> point at the aerodrome and 40-45 {{employees}} worked in the airport. The aerodrome was used by aircraft AN-24, AN-2, YAK-40, MI-2. The flight range was small and {{there were only two}} scheduled flights: Ventspils - Riga and Ventspils - Leningrad (now St. Petersburg).|$|R
25|$|In 1955 No. 41 Squadron, {{which was}} now {{equipped}} with four Bristol Freighters and had a strength of 73 officers and airmen, was deployed to RAF Changi in Singapore {{as part of an}} expansion of New Zealand's commitment to the Commonwealth Far East Strategic Reserve. The Bristol Freighters were slow and uncomfortable aircraft, but proved successful in transporting supplies and personnel throughout Southeast Asia. The squadron transported a very wide range of equipment, and established the first scheduled air ambulance service in Malaya. No. 41 Squadron also dropped supplies to Commonwealth forces engaged in the Malayan Emergency. On 10 December 1956 a Bristol Freighter piloted by No. 41 Squadron's commanding officer, Squadron Leader A.S. Tie, was destroyed when it crashed in the Cameron Highlands region of Malaya. Tie was killed in this accident, along with the three other aircrew, three Royal Army Service Corps <b>air</b> <b>dispatchers</b> and two Malayan film makers travelling as passengers; a fourth dispatcher survived. While the other RNZAF squadron in Malaya, No. 14 Squadron, returned home in 1958 following Malaysian independence, No. 41 Squadron remained in Singapore; at this time the squadron had a strength of three Bristol Freighters. The Whenuapai-based Transport Support Unit was responsible for training aircrew to serve with No. 41 Squadron.|$|R
5000|$|October 1960 saw {{the raising}} and {{training}} of a Section of Regular Army <b>Air</b> <b>Dispatchers,</b> who formed a regular component of 39 Air Dispatch Platoon (Reserve) at Frenchmans Road Depot in Randwick, Sydney. In order to gain operational experience the Regular Army section of 39 AD Pl. was detached to 55 Company RASC (AD) in February 1961 for duty on the Malaya / Thailand Border. At that time duties of 55 Company RASC (AD) included the resupplying by air of the Commonwealth Brigade in their operations against the Communist Guerrillas. On returning to Australia the Regular Army Section carried out extensive parachute training plus logistic support force supply path finding duties. A second (Regular) Section was formed mid-1961 and detached to 55 Company RASC (AD) for duties on the Malaya / Thailand Border from February to May 1962. Both ARA sections were then sent to Singapore in May 1962 for international Exercise [...] "Trumpeter", {{this was followed by}} heavy drop training at the Far East School of Land / Air Warfare. On return from Singapore in July 1962 a Regular Platoon of half strength was formed (40 AD Platoon) at Avoca Street Randwick using the 2 ARA Sections of 39 AD Pl. as the NCO base.|$|R
5000|$|The flight academy, {{headquartered}} in Miami, is an aviation school {{that specializes in}} training airlines and pilots from around the world. Core training programs include: Pilot training, Airline Crew training, Type Rating training, Aircraft Maintenance training, Flight Attendant, <b>Dispatcher,</b> <b>Air</b> Traffic Control, and Ab Initio training.|$|R
5000|$|On 19 September, RAF Douglas Dakota Mk. III, KG374, c/n 12383, (ex-USAAF C-47A-DK, 42-92568), 'YS-DM', of 271 Squadron, RAF Down Ampney, Gloucester, piloted by F/Lt. David Lord, {{was hit by}} {{anti-aircraft}} fire in {{the starboard}} engine while on a supply sortie to Arnhem. Fire spread over the starboard wing, as Lord spent ten minutes making two passes over very small dropzones (which, unknown to the crew, had been overrun by German forces) to drop eight ammunition panniers. Just after the last pannier was dropped, the fuel tank exploded, tore off the wing and only the navigator F/O Harry King escaped. He was made POW the following morning, spending {{the rest of the}} war in Stalag Luft I at Barth. Lord, the second pilot P/O R. E. H. [...] "Dickie" [...] Medhurst (son of Air Chief Marshal Sir Charles Medhurst), the wireless operator F/O Alec Ballantyne and <b>air</b> <b>dispatchers</b> Cpl. P. Nixon, Dvr. A. Rowbotham, Dvr. J. Ricketts and Dvr. L. Harper of 223 Company RASC, were killed. Following the release of King from prison camp, full details of the action became known and Lord received a posthumous Victoria Cross on 13 November 1945, the only VC awarded to any member of Transport Command during the Second World War. In May 1949, the Dutch Government awarded Harry King the Netherlands Bronze Cross.|$|R
40|$|Increasing {{competition}} demands more competitiveness {{from companies}} and constant and accurate information about competitors {{and the market}} place. This requires the development of performance evaluation methods. Although airport cargo revenues are larger than airport passengerâ€™s, no survey has provided a detailed study on competitive performance factors of air cargo players in Brazil. This paper has surveyed major airlines operating in Brazil and major <b>air</b> cargo <b>dispatchers</b> (domestic and international). The results of this work are directly useful to INFRAERO, to the airlines and to the Brazilian Civil Aviation Agency (ANAC), in order to suggest improvements in {{the efficiency of the}} air sector...|$|R
40|$|After {{a number}} of {{background}} studies (including surveys, a simulator study, and interviews with commercial <b>air</b> traffic controllers, <b>dispatchers,</b> and pilots), several design concepts have been developed t o guide {{in the design of}} tools to aid in enroute flight planning activities. Alternative versions of these tools have been implemented in the Flight Planning Testbed (FPT), a part-task simulation environment for studying interactions with flight planning tools. This testbed, which runs on a Macintosh IIfx, presents scenarios and records all interaction with the operators. Thirty commercial airline pilots participated in a between-subjects experiment involving three alternative system designs and four flight planning scenarios. The results provide some very interesting insights into planning strategies and the effects of cognitive tools on those strategies. BACKGROUND The Flight Planning Testbed is the culmination of a two year effort to design a system that would allow testing of various design concepts for supporting enroute flight planning. Enroute flight planning involves the adaptation of a planned flight, while it is airborne, in response to...|$|R
40|$|The primary {{objective}} is to develop an advanced pilot weather interface for the flight deck and to measure its utilization and effectiveness in pilot reroute decision processes, weather situation awareness, and weather monitoring. Identical graphical weather displays for the <b>dispatcher,</b> <b>air</b> traffic control (ATC), and pilot crew should also enhance the dialogue capabilities for reroute decisions. By utilizing a broadcast data link for surface observations, forecasts, radar summaries, lightning strikes, and weather alerts, onboard weather computing facilities construct graphical displays, historical weather displays, color textual displays, and other tools to assist the pilot crew. Since the weather data is continually being received and stored by the airborne system, the pilot crew has instantaneous access to the latest information. This information is color coded to distinguish degrees of category for surface observations, ceiling and visibilities, and ground radar summaries. Automatic weather monitoring and pilot crew alerting is accomplished by the airborne computing facilities. When a new weather information is received, the displays are instantaneously changed to reflect the new information. Also, when a new surface or special observation for the intended destination is received, the pilot crew is informed so that information can be studied at the pilot's discretion. The pilot crew is also immediately alerted when a severe weather notice, AIRMET or SIGMET, is received. The cockpit weather display shares a multicolor eight inch cathode ray tube and overlaid touch panel with a pilot crew data link interface. Touch sensitive buttons and areas are used for pilot selection of graphical and data link displays. Time critical ATC messages are presented in a small window that overlays other displays so that immediate pilot alerting and action can be taken. Predeparture and reroute clearances are displayed on the graphical weather system so pilot review of weather along the route can be accomplished prior to pilot acceptance of the clearance. An ongoing multiphase test series is planned for testing and modifying the graphical weather system. Preliminary data shows that the nine test subjects considered the graphical presentation to be much better than their current weather information source for situation awareness, flight safety, and reroute decision making...|$|R
