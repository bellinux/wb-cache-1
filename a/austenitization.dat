50|$|By {{changing}} the temperature for <b>austenitization,</b> the austempering process can yield different and desired microstructures. A higher <b>austenitization</b> temperature {{can produce a}} higher carbon content in austenite, whereas a lower temperature produces a more uniform distribution of austempered structure.

50|$|<b>Austenitization</b> {{means to}} heat the iron, iron-based metal, or steel to a {{temperature}} at which it changes crystal structure from ferrite to austenite. The more open structure of the austenite is then able to absorb carbon from the iron-carbides in carbon steel. An incomplete initial <b>austenitization</b> can leave undissolved carbides in the matrix.|$|E
50|$|In {{order for}} any {{transformation}} to take place, the microstructure {{of the metal}} must be austenite structure. The exact boundaries of the austenite phase region depend on the chemistry of the alloy being heat treated. However, austenitizing temperatures are typically between 790 and 915°C (1455 to 1680°F). The {{amount of time spent}} at this temperature will vary with the alloy and process specifics for a through-hardened part. The best results are achieved when <b>austenitization</b> is long enough to produce a fully austenitic metal microstructure (there will still be graphite present in cast irons) with a consistent carbon content. In steels this may only take a few minutes after the austenitizing temperature has been reached throughout the part section, but in cast irons it takes longer. This is because carbon must diffuse out of the graphite until it has reached the equilibrium concentration dictated by the temperature and the phase diagram. This step may be done in many types of furnaces, in a high temperature salt bath, via direct flame or induction heating. Numerous patents exist for specific methods and variations.|$|E

In this paper the effect of processing type and partial <b>austenitization</b> time on the mechanical properties of Ni-Mo low alloyed ductile cast iron are investigated. In the process of partial <b>austenitization,</b> increasing the heating time above 400 seconds, results in an increase in both the ultimate tensile strength and yield strength.

40|$|Surface {{hardening}} of steels involves rapid <b>austenitization</b> {{and subsequent}} quenching of the surface. The resulting extent of hardening largely {{depends on the}} rate of <b>austenitization</b> of the surface under the applied high heating rates. In the present work the kinetics of austenite formation in Fe-C alloys during rapid, non-isothermal heating conditions, characterized by high heating rates and short <b>austenitization</b> periods, were studied by means of computational simulation. <b>Austenitization</b> of lamellar pearlite/proeutectoid ferrite microstructures was simulated by assuming two kinetically distinct stages: i) dissolution of lamellar pearlite followed by ii) dissolution of proeutectoid ferrite. The two stages were simulated by two corresponding I-D diffusion models employed in series. Numerical solution of the resultant moving-boundary diffusion problems provide calculated results regarding the dependency of vol. fraction austenite on thermal cycle parameters and on initial microstructural features of the steel.

40|$|AbstractNowadays, {{light weight}} {{design of the}} body in white is {{achieved}} by manufacturing structural components out of high strength steel grades. Due to the increase of materials tensile strength, a reduction of sheet thickness of the component is possible to attend by a weight reduction of the component with remaining or increasing components strength. Such steel grades are often processed by direct hot stamping, which can be described as forming and quenching in one process step. Due to the high temperature difference and the relative movement between the hot blank and the cold tool surfaces during the forming operation, high thermal and mechanical loads are applied on the tool. In order to avoid decarburization and scaling during <b>austenitization,</b> semi-finished products with an aluminum-silicon pre-coating are used. The pre-coating intensifies the occurrence of wear in terms of adhesive layer build-up on the tool. This leads to a degradation of material flow and workpiece accuracy by increasing number of drawn parts which can result in time consuming and expensive rework to remove the layer build-up and ensure components quality. Within this work, adhesive wear behavior of aluminum-silicon pre-coated boron-manganese steel is investigated under process relevant conditions. Therefore, a wear test rig is used which enables investigations on layer build-up on tools with respect to contact pressure, blank temperature and <b>austenitization</b> parameters following the time-temperature profile within a hot stamping operation.

40|$|Knowledge {{of phase}} transformations {{in a hot}} {{stamping}} and cold die quenching process (HSCDQ) is critical for determining physical and mechanical properties of formed parts. Currently, no modelling technique is available to describe the entire process. The research work described in this thesis deals with the modelling of phase transformation in HSCDQ of boron steel, providing a scientific understanding of the process. Material models in a form of unified constitutive equations are presented. Heat treatment tests were performed to study the <b>austenitization</b> of boron steel. Strain-temperature curves, measured using a dilatometer, were used to analyse the evolution of austenite. It {{was found that the}} evolution of austenite is controlled by: diffusion coefficient, temperature, heating rate and current volume proportion of austenite. An <b>austenitization</b> model is proposed to describe the relationship between time, temperature, heating rate and <b>austenitization,</b> in continuous heating processes. It can predict the start and completion temperatures, evolution of strain and the amount of austenite during <b>austenitization.</b> Bainite transformation with strain effect was studied by introducing pre-deformation in the austenite state. The start and finish temperatures of bainite transformation at different cooling rates were measured from strain-temperature curves, obtained using a dilatometer. It was found that pre-deformation promotes bainite transformation. A bainite transformation model is proposed to describe the effects of strain and strain rate, of pre-deformation, on the evolution of bainite transformation. An energy factor, as a function of normalised dislocation density, is introduced into the model to rationalise the strain effect. Viscoplastic behaviour of boron steel was studied by analyzing stress-strain curves obtained from uni-axial tensile tests. A viscoplastic-damage model has been developed to describe the evolution of plastic strain, isotropic hardening, normalised dislocation density and damage factor of the steel, when forming in a temperature range of 600 °C to 800 °C. Formability tests were conducted and the results were used to validate the viscoplastic-damage model and bainite transformation model. Finite element analysis was carried out to simulate the formability tests using the commercial software, ABAQUS. The material models were integrated with ABAQUS using VUMAT. A good agreement was obtained between the experimental and FE results for: deformation degree, thickness distribution, and microstructural evolution.

40|$|Ductile iron was {{quenched}} using two-variant isothermal transformation. The first treatment variant {{consisted of}} one-phase <b>austenitization</b> at a temperature t = 830, 860 or 900 C, cooling {{down to an}} isothermal transformation temperature of 300 or 400 C and holding from 8 to 64 minutes. The second treatment variant consisted of two-phase <b>austenitization.</b> Cast iron was austenitizied at a tem- perature t = 950 C and cooled down to a supercritical temperature t ’ = 900, 860 or 830 C. Isothermal transformation was conducted under the same conditions as those applied to the first variant. Ferrite cast iron was quenched isothermally. Basic strength (Rp 0. 2, Rm) and plastic (A 5) properties as well as matrix microstructure and hardness were examined. As a result of heat treatment, the following ADI grades were obtained: EN-GJS- 800 - 8, EN-GJS- 1200 - 2 and EN-GJS- 1400 - 1 in accordance with PN–EN 1564 : 2000 having plasticity of 1. 5 ÷ 4 times more than minimum requirements specified in the standard...|$|E
