5|$|In 1552 Dudley {{was made}} a Knight of the Garter; {{at the end of}} the year he was sent on a {{diplomatic}} mission to discuss Edward VI's hopes to mediate for peace between the Empire and France. He first travelled to Brussels, where he was received by Mary of Hungary on 8 January 1553. Impatient to see the Emperor himself, he tried to intercept him on his way to Flanders. Sir Richard Morrison, the English resident ambassador with Charles V, knew nothing of this until he met Dudley at Treves. The ailing ruler was averse to be molested by diplomats while journeying, nevertheless Morrison arranged <b>an</b> <b>interview</b> <b>at</b> Luxembourg in which Charles referred them to a later occasion. On 11 February 1553 the Emperor gave the Englishmen an audience at Brussels. When Dudley offered to kiss his hand, he embraced him. The visitors noted that the chamber was hung with tapestries depicting the Emperor's victories at Tunis. Charles V was non-committal, declaring that he was well-disposed to peace if he only could trust the French king. On returning to England Dudley had an audience with Edward on 19 February. Jehan Scheyfve, the Emperor's agent, reported that Dudley was discreet, and only mentioned that Charles had given him a present. The French ambassador in London was not pleased. Dudley was elected MP for Oxfordshire in the March parliament of 1553, carrying Edward's train at the proceedings.|$|E

The rushing water nearly drowns him, but Homer arrives and pulls {{him out of the}} water, saving Mr. Burns's life. To reward him, Mr. Burns offers to take Homer out to dinner. Homer says he likes Chicago deep dish pizza, so Mr. Burns takes him to Chicago on his private plane. On the plane, Homer is treated with luxury and gets serenaded by Lionel Richie. Homer has the time of his life in Chicago, but he becomes depressed on the return trip because he does not have the plane. Back in Springfield, Homer tells Marge that he is tired of being a normal person and becomes depressed. Marge, pitying for Homer, decides to help and hires him a life coach named Colby Kraus (Stephen Colbert), who will help with Homer's dream. Colby starts right away in his treatment with Homer by videotaping his every move. At the bowling alley and after watching Homer's daily habits for a few days, Colby realizes that bowling is the one thing Homer is good at and enjoys doing. He instructs Homer to wear his bowling shoes everywhere he goes to help instill confidence in everything he does. The bowling shoes work, Homer becomes a new man, and as a result he receives numerous new job offers. Homer decides to only go for <b>an</b> <b>interview</b> <b>at</b> Handyman's Choice Copper Tubing because he would be required to fly in the company jet as part of his new job, however, the Rich Texan does not hire him.|$|E
