5|$|Although {{used before}} his presidency, Roosevelt used {{military}} muscle several times throughout his two terms with <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>subtle</b> touch to complement his diplomatic policies and enforcing the Monroe Doctrine throughout multiple interventions in Latin America. This included the Great White Fleet, 16 battleships which peacefully circumnavigated the globe {{as an illustration}} of United States' rising yet neutral prestige under Roosevelt's direction.|$|E
5|$|Assonance, {{where the}} use of similar vowel sounds within a word rather than similar sounds at the {{beginning}} or end of a word, was widely used in skaldic poetry, but {{goes back to the}} Homeric epic. Because verbs carry much of the pitch in the English language, assonance can loosely evoke the tonal elements of Chinese poetry and so is useful in translating Chinese poetry. Consonance occurs where a consonant sound is repeated throughout a sentence without putting the sound only at the front of a word. Consonance provokes <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>subtle</b> effect than alliteration and so is less useful as a structural element.|$|E

50|$|Agolli's second novel, The {{man with}} the cannon (Njeriu me top, Tirana 1975) {{translated}} into English in 1983, takes up the partisan theme from a different angle and with <b>a</b> somewhat <b>more</b> <b>subtle</b> approach.|$|R
25|$|The Kisman-Masurel {{scale is}} similar, and gives <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>subtle</b> {{gradation}} of bubbles, but {{is more difficult}} to rate proficiently. The Spencer scale has been more popular in practice. Grade categories are non-linear and cannot be averaged.|$|E
25|$|From February to April 2007, Peter Dunne {{exercised}} his {{own right}} to a conscience vote to support Sue Bradford's private members bill against parental corporal punishment of children, while Gordon Copeland vigorously opposed it, as did Judy Turner, but on <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>subtle</b> level.|$|E
25|$|In 1969, Harriott {{recorded}} the album Hum-Dono {{in collaboration with}} the Goan guitarist Amancio D'Silva. This was an unqualified success.

25|$|The {{first half}} of each issue of the magazine, which {{consists}} chiefly of news reporting and investigative journalism, tends to include these in-jokes in <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>subtle</b> manner, so as to maintain journalistic integrity, while the second half, generally characterised by unrestrained parody and cutting humour, tends to present itself in a more confrontational way.|$|E
25|$|In later years, <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>subtle</b> {{method of}} disrupting Christian {{holidays}} involved broadcasting very popular movies {{one after the}} other on the major holidays when believers are expected to participate in religious processions, especially during the Easter celebration. Apparently, this was intended to keep those whose faith was uncertain or wavering in their homes and glued to their TVs.|$|E
25|$|<b>A</b> <b>more</b> <b>subtle</b> form {{of scale}} {{symmetry}} {{is demonstrated by}} fractals. As conceived by Benoît Mandelbrot, fractals are a mathematical concept in which {{the structure of a}} complex form looks similar at any degree of magnification, well seen in the Mandelbrot set. A coast {{is an example of a}} naturally occurring fractal, since it retains similar-appearing complexity at every level from the view of a satellite to a microscopic examination of how the water laps up against individual grains of sand. The branching of trees, which enables small twigs to stand in for full trees in dioramas, is another example.|$|E
50|$|The Ellimist tells {{that when}} Crayak first appeared, they waged {{a war that}} {{destroyed}} {{a tenth of the}} galaxy.

25|$|The Knicks updated their 'New Look Logo', {{this time}} {{eliminating}} the color black from the scheme. They still used the previous uniform during the 2011–12 season, {{but for the}} 2012–13 season, the Knicks unveiled new uniforms inspired from their 'Championship Era' uniforms. <b>A</b> <b>more</b> <b>subtle</b> and bolder 'New York' script was introduced, while the uniform piping stopped until the lettering. The phrase Once A Knick, Always A Knick is added on the uniform collar. Gray became the accent color. In addition, {{an updated version of}} their 1970s secondary logo, this time featuring only the team name, was introduced.|$|E
25|$|LQC models share {{features}} of LQG {{and so is}} a useful toy model. However, the results obtained {{are subject to the}} usual restriction that a truncated classical theory, then quantized, might not display the true behaviour of the full theory due to artificial suppression of degrees of freedom that might have large quantum fluctuations in the full theory. It has been argued that singularity avoidance in LQC are by mechanisms only available in these restrictive models and that singularity avoidance in the full theory can still be obtained but by <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>subtle</b> feature of LQG.|$|E
25|$|Direct and inverse {{images of}} sheaves Every {{continuous}} map f : X → Y between topological spaces induces a functor f ∗ from {{the category of}} sheaves (of sets, or abelian groups, or rings...) on X to the corresponding category of sheaves on Y, the direct image functor. It also induces a functor f −1 from the category of sheaves of abelian groups on Y to the category of sheaves of abelian groups on X, the inverse image functor. f −1 is left adjoint to f ∗. Here <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>subtle</b> {{point is that the}} left adjoint for coherent sheaves will differ from that for sheaves (of sets).|$|E

25|$|The fourth {{generation}} GS had its world premiere at the Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance in California in August 2011. The vehicle {{was shown to}} have <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>subtle</b> version of the LF-Gh's spindle grille, while overall exterior dimensions are almost identical to the previous generation. L-shaped LED front daytime running lamps and rear LED tube lamps are a new design feature. The new GS was the centerpiece of Toyota chairman Akio Toyoda's initiative to restore passion to the Lexus brand and better compete with German luxury automakers that had been gaining market share in the United States. It was reported that Toyoda initially opposed the styling choices made for the new model, but since thanked the design team that persuaded him to greenlight the project.|$|E

500|$|The 2009–10 season saw the Blazers unveil {{a fourth}} {{alternate}} uniform, {{a design that}} features the team's 'Rip City' nickname and <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>subtle</b> version of the [...] "blaze" [...] on the side. This uniform was tweaked to include sleeves in the 2014–15 season.

500|$|Whereas {{video game}} music prior to Space Invaders was {{restricted}} to the extremities (i.e., a short introductory theme with game-over counterpart), the alien-inspired hit featured continuous music—the well-known four-note loop—throughout, uninterrupted by sound effects. [...] "It was thus {{the first time that}} sound effects and music were superimposed to form a rich sonic landscape.

500|$|The {{film has}} rarely been repeated, {{and has never been}} {{released}} on DVD, perhaps due to its subject matter. The [...] "Toonhound" [...] review suggest that the film takes the tone of the ending of The Snowman even further, [...] "exploring an aspect of life rarely approached in animated form." [...] Paul Madden, writing Dianne Jackson's obituary in 1993 suggests that the film [...] "was less of immediate popular appeal than The Snowman, but was perhaps more satisfying to her creatively, demanding <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>subtle</b> approach." ...|$|E
500|$|Thirty Three & 1/3 (1976), Harrison's {{first album}} release {{on his own}} Dark Horse Records label, {{produced}} the hit singles [...] "This Song" [...] and [...] "Crackerbox Palace", both of which reached the top 25 in the US. The surreal humour of [...] "Crackerbox Palace" [...] reflected Harrison's association with Monty Python's Eric Idle, who directed a comical music video for the song. With an emphasis on melody and musicianship, and <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>subtle</b> subject matter than the pious message of his earlier works, Thirty Three & 1/3 earned Harrison his most favourable critical notices in the US since All Things Must Pass.|$|E
