5|$|In 2011, the {{academic}} journal Public <b>Archaeology</b> published a research paper by Moshenska and Schadla-Hall that analysed Wheeler's role in presenting <b>archaeology</b> to the British public. Two years later, the Papers from the Institute of <b>Archaeology</b> issued a short comic strip by Moshenska and Alex Salamunovich depicting Wheeler's activities {{in studying the}} <b>archaeology</b> of Libya during World War II.|$|E
5|$|Chatwin {{enrolled}} in October 1966 at the University of Edinburgh to study <b>Archaeology.</b> He had regretted not attending Oxford {{and had been}} contemplating going to university for a few years. A visit in December 1965 to the Hermitage in Leningrad sparked {{his interest in the}} field of <b>archaeology.</b> Despite winning the Wardrop Prize for the best first year's work, he found the rigour of academic <b>archaeology</b> tiresome, and he left after two years without taking a degree.|$|E

5|$|Vere Gordon Childe (14 April 1892 – 19 October 1957), {{better known}} as V. Gordon Childe, was an Australian {{archaeologist}} and philologist who specialized {{in the study of}} European prehistory. Working most of his life as an academic in the United Kingdom for the University of Edinburgh and then the Institute of <b>Archaeology,</b> London, he wrote twenty-six books and was an early proponent of culture-historical <b>archaeology</b> and Marxist <b>archaeology.</b>|$|E
5|$|After {{completing}} the excavations at Mucking in 1978, the Joneses retired from field <b>archaeology</b> {{and returned to}} their cottage in Hereford. Margaret became the patron of the Thurrock Local History Society (the source of many volunteers to the Mucking excavation) and sat on many other <b>archaeology</b> committees in Essex. In this role she regularly gave lectures, guided tours and talks to schoolchildren across the county.|$|E

5|$|Alongside his {{academic}} publications, Aston wrote two books on <b>archaeology</b> {{for a more}} general audience, {{both of which were}} published by Channel 4 Books as a spin-off from the Time Team television series. The first of these was Time Team's Timechester: A Companion to <b>Archaeology,</b> co-written with Carenza Lewis and Phil Harding and first published in 2000. Based around the fictional British town of Timechester, the book looks at how the settlement would have progressed from the Palaeolithic through to the modern day, and examines the remains that each period would have left behind in the archaeological record. This was followed in 2002 by <b>Archaeology</b> is Rubbish: A Beginner's Guide, which Aston co-wrote with Tony Robinson and dedicated to Harding. <b>Archaeology</b> is Rubbish describes a fictional excavation site in an ordinary suburban back garden, and discusses the evidence from different archaeological periods, the field methods and techniques used by the excavators, and the legal proceedings and problems that archaeologists in Britain face.|$|E
5|$|Archaeoastronomy uses {{a variety}} of methods to uncover {{evidence}} of past practices including <b>archaeology,</b> anthropology, astronomy, statistics and probability, and history. Because these methods are diverse and use data from such different sources, integrating them into a coherent argument has been a long-term difficulty for archaeoastronomers. Archaeoastronomy fills complementary niches in landscape <b>archaeology</b> and cognitive <b>archaeology.</b> Material evidence and its connection to the sky can reveal how a wider landscape can be integrated into beliefs about the cycles of nature, such as Mayan astronomy and its relationship with agriculture. Other examples which have brought together ideas of cognition and landscape include studies of the cosmic order embedded in the roads of settlements.|$|E
5|$|Aston first gained {{full-time}} employment in 1970, {{working as a}} field officer at the Oxford City and County Museum in Oxfordshire. For a time living in a tent, {{he worked on the}} sites and monuments record and taught several extramural classes while based at the museum. This extramural teaching fitted closely with Aston's staunch belief that <b>archaeology</b> should be open to all who were interested in it. As part of this devotion to public outreach, he presented a radio series on <b>archaeology</b> that was broadcast on Radio Oxford. In 1974 he moved to Taunton to become the first County Archaeologist for Somerset, where he set up a new site record and oversaw the excavation of sites revealed by the construction of the M5 motorway. Again he also taught extramural adult education classes, this time for the University of Bristol. It was here that he developed a passion for aerial <b>archaeology,</b> and would often charter private planes in order to undertake aerial photography. Becoming a pioneer of landscape <b>archaeology,</b> along with Trevor Rowley he was responsible for coining the term in their 1974 book, Landscape <b>Archaeology.</b> With archaeologist James Bond he authored The Landscape of Towns (1976), in which he extended his use of landscape <b>archaeology</b> to urban areas. Recognising his contribution to the discipline, in 1976, he was elected a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London.|$|E

5|$|Aston {{was born}} on 1 July 1946 into a working-class family in Oldbury, Worcestershire, to cabinet-maker Harold Aston and his wife Gladys. He {{developed}} an early interest in <b>archaeology,</b> although teachers at Oldbury Grammar School attempted to dissuade him from pursuing it. His father gave him two books on <b>archaeology</b> as a Christmas present, and he subsequently spent much time visiting archaeological sites, sometimes playing truant to do so. The first of his family to attend university, Aston studied geography at the University of Birmingham, albeit with a subsidiary in <b>archaeology,</b> graduating in 1967. He taught himself more about <b>archaeology</b> by enrolling in various excavations, and was influenced by such figures as his thesis supervisor Harry Thorpe, {{as well as the}} geographer Trevor Rowley and archaeologists Philip Rahtz and Philip Barker. His dissertation was on the development of settlement in the West Penwith peninsula.|$|E
5|$|Balch became {{interested}} in stratigraphy and cave <b>archaeology</b> after attending a talk by William Boyd Dawkins. Balch led much of the exploration through the caves near Wookey Hole village, discovering and mapping many caves. He also made discoveries of artefacts used {{by the people who}} lived in the caves during the Iron Age. Balch was a founder member of the Wells Natural History and <b>Archaeology</b> Society and through the society he founded the Wells Museum, largely including his own collection of artefacts.|$|E
5|$|Between 1996 and 2010 Buckton Castle was {{investigated}} by archaeologists, first the University of Manchester Archaeological Unit then the University of Salford's Centre for Applied <b>Archaeology</b> {{as part of}} the Tameside <b>Archaeology</b> Survey. More than 60 volunteers were involved in the project. It is a Scheduled Ancient Monument and close to the Buckton Vale Quarry. The castle is overgrown with heather and peat, and there are no above-ground ruins.|$|E

5|$|Bronze age <b>archaeology</b> is to {{be found}} in {{abundance}} in the surrounding area. Examples include the short-cist burials found near West Newbigging, about a mile to the North of the town. These burials included pottery urns, a pair of silver discs and a gold armlet. Iron Age <b>archaeology</b> is also well represented, for example in the souterrain nearby Warddykes Cemetery and at West Grange of Conan, as well as the better-known examples at Carlungie and Ardestie.|$|E
5|$|Childe {{continued}} {{writing and}} publishing books on <b>archaeology,</b> {{beginning with a}} series of works following on from The Dawn of European Civilisation and The Aryans by compiling and synthesising data from across Europe. First was The Most Ancient Near East (1928), which assembled information from across Mesopotamia and India, setting a background from which the spread of farming and other technologies into Europe could be understood. This was followed by The Danube in Prehistory (1929) which examined the <b>archaeology</b> along the Danube river, recognising it as the natural boundary dividing the Near East from Europe; Childe believed that it was via the Danube that new technologies travelled westward in prehistory. The book introduced the concept of an archaeological culture to Britain from Germany, revolutionising the theoretical approach of British <b>archaeology.</b>|$|E
5|$|Dani, {{an ethnic}} Kashmiri, {{was born on}} 20 June 1920 in Basna, Central Provinces, India. He {{graduated}} in 1944, with an MA degree, {{to become the first}} Muslim graduate of Banaras Hindu University. He scored highest marks in the exams which earned him a Gold Medal. This also qualified him for a teaching fellowship from the same university. Although he was provided with the grant, he was not allowed to teach due to his religious beliefs. He stayed there for six months. In 1945, he started working as a trainee in <b>archaeology</b> under the guidance of Mortimer Wheeler. At this time, he participated in excavations at Taxila and Mohenjo-daro. He was subsequently posted at the Department of <b>Archaeology</b> of British India at Taj Mahal, Agra. He received his PhD from the Institute of <b>Archaeology,</b> University College London.|$|E
