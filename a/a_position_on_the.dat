5|$|The Army met little {{resistance}} as it advanced {{through the}} Black Forest in four columns, through the Höllental (Hölle valley), via Oberkirch, and Freudenstadt, {{and at the}} southern end of the forest, along the Rhine bank.

5|$|A {{group of}} {{approximately}} 1,000 Muslim men {{set out on}} late Friday from Medina and managed to circle around the Meccan forces. Early the next morning, they took <b>a</b> <b>position</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> lower slopes of the hill of Uhud. Shortly before the battle commenced, 'Abd-Allah ibn Ubayy (the chief of the Khazraj tribe) and his followers withdrew their support for Muhammad and returned to Medina, with reports suggesting Ibn Ubayy's discontent with the plan to march out from Medina to meet the Meccans. Ibn Ubayy and his followers would later receive censure in the Qur'an for this act.|$|E
5|$|After Grant {{retired from}} the screen, he became more active in business. He {{accepted}} <b>a</b> <b>position</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> board of directors at Fabergé. This position was not honorary, as some had assumed; Grant regularly attended meetings and travelled internationally to support them. His pay was modest {{in comparison to the}} millions of his film career, a salary of a reported $15,000 a year. Such was Grant's influence on the company that George Barrie once claimed that Grant had {{played a role in the}} growth of the firm to annual revenues of about $50 million in 1968, a growth of nearly 80% since the inaugural year in 1964. The position also permitted use of a private plane, which Grant could use to fly to see his daughter wherever her mother, Dyan Cannon, was working.|$|E
5|$|After graduating Chelvanayakam started {{teaching}} at St. Thomas but resigned when the warden William Arthur Stone refused him leave {{to visit his}} dying brother Edward Rajasundaram. He then joined Wesley College, Colombo as chief science master. During this period he studied law at Ceylon Law College and became an advocate of the Supreme Court in 1923. He started practising law in Hulftsdorp, specialising in civil law, and was made a King's Counsel on 31 May 1947. Chelvanayakam was twice offered <b>a</b> <b>position</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Supreme Court by Chief Justice John Curtois Howard.|$|E

5|$|Calgary {{ended the}} {{exhibition}} season with several injuries to key players. Centre Daymond Langkow remained sidelined following a neck injury suffered the previous season, while Ryan Stone (knee) was also out. Matt Stajan suffered a shoulder separation, David Moss also suffered {{a shoulder injury}} and Ales Kotalik was lost to a knee injury. As {{a result of the}} injuries, the Flames signed centre Brendan Morrison to a contract; Morrison had been in training camp with the Canucks before being released. Rookie defenceman T. J. Brodie proved the surprise player of training camp. Expected to start the year with the Abbotsford Heat of the American Hockey League (AHL), Brodie impressed the Flames' coaching staff and earned <b>a</b> <b>position</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> team to begin the NHL season.|$|E
5|$|Finally {{accepting}} that Soult would not arrive, Ney could {{not hope to}} hold his position, much less push the Austrians back. He concluded that he must fall back to Winterthur. To cover the retreat, he instructed Walther and his cavalry to establish <b>a</b> <b>position</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Töss, above the bridge at Stieg. From there, the cavalry could protect an orderly retreat. Amidst a muddy rivulet feeding the Töss, Ney positioned a second detachment guarding the village of Töss and the road leading to a ridge of the hills, where he placed a couple of cannons. From the ridge, his rear guard could fire its artillery on the Austrian advance.|$|E
5|$|In 1903, Phleps was {{transferred}} to the 11th Feldjäger (rifle) Battalion in Güns (in modern-day Hungary), and in 1905 was accepted into the Theresian Military Academy in Wiener Neustadt. He completed his studies in two years, and was endorsed as suitable for service in the General Staff. Following promotion to Oberleutnant (first lieutenant) he transferred to the staff of the 13th Infantry Regiment at Esseg in Slavonia, and then the 6th Infantry Division in Graz. This was followed by a promotion to Hauptmann (captain) in 1911 along with <b>a</b> <b>position</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> staff of the XV Army Corps in Sarajevo, where he specialised in mobilisation and communications in the difficult terrain of Bosnia and Herzegovina.|$|E

However, there were occasions when the Australians felt that their hosts had crossed the mark with tactics resembling bodyline.|$|E
5|$|In early 1863, Major General James Longstreet {{was given}} {{command of the}} Confederate Department of North Carolina and Southern Virginia. His {{objectives}} were to defend Richmond from attack from the southeast, forage for supplies in Union controlled southeastern Virginia and to dislodge the Union garrison at Suffolk. Longstreet began the Siege of Suffolk on April 11, 1863. The 6th Massachusetts occupied <b>a</b> <b>position</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> right of the Union defensive siege lines at a location called Fort Nansemond by {{the bank of the}} Nansemond River. For 22 days, the regiment engaged in frequent exchanges of fire with opposing forces though no significant assault was made by the Confederates.|$|E
5|$|Labor unions, politicians, advocates, educators, the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, {{and human}} rights {{advocacy}} organizations such as Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International have {{expressed concern about the}} impartiality of the trial of Abu-Jamal. Amnesty International neither takes <b>a</b> <b>position</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> guilt or innocence of Abu-Jamal nor classifies him as a political prisoner. They are opposed by the family of Daniel Faulkner, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, the City of Philadelphia, Republican politicians, and the Fraternal Order of Police. In August 1999, the Fraternal Order of Police called for an economic boycott against all individuals and organizations that support Abu-Jamal.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the most}} {{contentious}} issues facing the newly elected government was {{the decision of the}} province's capital city. The federal legislation creating the province had fixed Edmonton as the provisional capital, much to the chagrin of Calgary. Neither party had taken <b>a</b> <b>position</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> divisive question during the campaign, but selecting a permanent capital was {{high on the list of}} the new legislature's orders of business. Calgary's case was made most enthusiastically by Minister of Public Works Cushing, Edmonton's by Attorney-General Cross. Banff and Red Deer were also possibilities, but motions to select each failed to find seconders. In the end, Edmonton was designated by a vote of sixteen members—including Rutherford—to eight.|$|E
5|$|Re-joining the 12th Battalion, Newland {{once again}} assumed command of A Company. On 26 February 1917, he was tasked with leading {{it during the}} 12th Battalion's attack on the village of La Barque during the German retreat to the Hindenburg Line. At Bark Trench, <b>a</b> <b>position</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{north side of the}} centre of La Barque, the company {{encountered}} a German strongpoint and Newland received a gunshot wound to the face. He was admitted to the 1st Australian Field Ambulance, and returned to the 12th Battalion on 25 March after a period of hospitalisation at the 7th Stationary Hospital in Boulogne.|$|E
5|$|The 6th Squadron, {{commanded}} by Major Charles Dick, were also sent forward {{to support the}} 2nd Squadron's attempt to break through to the post. Advancing along the ridge from No.2 Post, they reached <b>a</b> <b>position</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> open plateau {{to the north of}} No.3 Post, but neither of the relieving squadrons could break through the Turkish lines, and were confronted by heavy Turkish fire from the surrounding higher ground. They were blocked by the sheer number of Turkish troops. Around noon the Turks undermined and blew up part of the trench at No.3 Post, which they then occupied. Turkish attacks continued all day, and they brought into action a mountain artillery gun from a nearby position. It was now estimated that around 3,000 Turkish troops were involved in the assault on No.3 Post.|$|E

5|$|The first Swedish {{attack on}} Frederikshald started on 14 September 1658 {{with a force}} of 1600 under Harald Stake, who falsely {{believed}} the town to be undefended. But Frederikshald was defended by two companies of the civic militia under captain Peder Olsen Normand, who had taken up <b>a</b> <b>position</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Overberget hill south of the town. Detachments from the regiments of Oppland and Østfold with four cannons came to their rescue. The Swedish attackers were taken by surprise and were completely defeated the day after their arrival.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} day, {{the northern}} column of the 14th Panzer Division drove via Glina {{and crossed the}} Una at both Bosanska Kostajnica and Bosanski Novi before continuing its push east. Elements of LI Infantry Corps also pushed east, establishing bridgeheads over the Kupa. A fragment of the 40th Infantry Division Slavonska, numbering around 300 troops, which had been holding <b>a</b> <b>position</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Sava at Bosanska Gradiška, retreated to Jajce via Banja Luka. When they arrived at Jajce, Nedeljković ordered them to take up blocking positions on the narrow Vrbas valley at Krupa on the road between Banja Luka and Mrkonjić Grad. The rear area units of the 17th Infantry Division Vrbaska were ordered to block the road from Kotor Varoš to Doboj.|$|E

40|$|In salmonid species, {{nucleolar}} organizing regions (NORs) {{have frequently}} been {{found on a}} single chromosome pair. However, some other, smaller yet active NORs have also been described. In the present study, NORs {{were found to be}} located in different <b>positions</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> chromosomes of 12 rainbow trout samples (11 cultivated and one naturalized stocks). Three phenotypes were found: 1) NORs located on two submetacentric chromosomes, in <b>a</b> subterminal <b>position</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> short arm (AA); 2) NORs located on two submetacentric chromosomes, in <b>a</b> subterminal <b>position</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> long arm (BB); and 3) NORs located on two submetacentric chromosomes, one in <b>a</b> subterminal <b>position</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> short arm, and the other in <b>a</b> subterminal <b>position</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> long arm (AB). Phenotype AA was identified in individuals from ten cultivated stocks, phenotype AB was identified in individuals from three cultivated stocks, and phenotype BB was found in one cultivated and one wild stock. Some aspects of the origin and the distribution of the different phenotypes are discussed. Key words: NOR polymorphism, fish cytogenetics, rainbow trout...|$|R
