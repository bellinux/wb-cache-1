40|$|The {{antioxidant}} {{properties of}} traditional balsamic vinegar as regards its phenolic and flavonoid content {{comparing it to}} selected <b>vinegars</b> <b>and</b> red wines have been investigated. The polyphenols were separated from interfering compounds utilizing C 18 columns. The polyphenolic content was determined utilizing both Folin–Ciocalteu and peroxidase assays. The antioxidant capacity was quantified using both ABTS and FRAP assays. The results show that traditional balsamic vinegar has lower antioxidant activity and phenolic and flavonoid content than Nero d’Avola but higher than the other tested products. The antioxidant capacity of wines <b>and</b> <b>vinegars</b> is highly correlated with their phenolic content, measured by peroxidase assay {{and it is also}} highly correlated with their flavonoid content while in traditional balsamic <b>vinegar</b> <b>and</b> balsamic <b>vinegar</b> this correlation diminishes.
