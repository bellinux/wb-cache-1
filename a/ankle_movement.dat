40|$|BACKGROUND: Limited {{information}} processing {{capacity in the}} brain necessitates task prioritisation and subsequent adaptive behavioural strategies for the dual-task coordination of locomotion with severe concurrent cognitive loading. Commonly observed strategies include prioritisation of gait {{at the cost of}} reduced performance in the cognitive task. Alternatively alterations of gait parameters such as gait velocity have been reported presumably to free processing capacity for the benefit of performance in the cognitive task. The aim {{of this study was to}} describe the neuroanatomical correlates of adaptive behavioural strategies in cognitive-motor dual-tasking when the competition for {{information processing}} capacity is severe and may exceed individuals' capacity limitations. METHODS: During an fMRI experiment, 12 young adults performed slow continuous, auditorily paced bilateral anti-phase <b>ankle</b> dorsi-plantarflexion <b>movements</b> as an element of normal gait at. 5 Hz in single and dual task modes. The secondary task involved a visual, alphabetic N-back task with presentation rate jittered around. 7 Hz. The N-back task, which randomly occurred in 0 -back or 2 -back form, was modified into a silent counting task to avoid confounding motor responses at the cost of slightly increasing the task's general coordinative complexity. Participants' <b>ankle</b> <b>movements</b> were recorded using an optoelectronic motion capture system to derive kinematic parameters representing the stability of the movement timing and synchronization. Participants were instructed to perform both tasks as accurately as possible. RESULTS: Increased processing complexity in the dual-task 2 -back condition led to significant changes in movement parameters such as the average inter-response interval, the coefficient of variation of absolute asynchrony and the standard deviation of peak angular velocity. A regions-of-interest analysis indicated correlations between these parameters and local activations within the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) such that lower IFG activations coincided with performance decrements. CONCLUSIONS: Dual-task interference effects show that the production of periodically timed <b>ankle</b> <b>movements,</b> taken as modelling elements of the normal gait cycle, draws on higher-level cognitive resources involved in working memory. The interference effect predominantly concerns the timing accuracy of the <b>ankle</b> <b>movements.</b> Reduced activations within regions of the left IFG, and in some respect also within the superior parietal lobule, were identified as one factor affecting the timing of periodic <b>ankle</b> <b>movements</b> resulting in involuntary 'hastening' during severe dual-task working memory load. This 'hastening' phenomenon may be an expression of re-automated locomotor control when higher-order cognitive processing capacity can no longer be allocated to the movements due to the demands of the cognitive task. The results of our study also propose the left IFG as a target region to improve performance during dual-task walking by techniques for non-invasive brain stimulation...|$|R

ObjectiveTo evaluate the muscle strength of ankles {{in patients with}} rheumatoid arthritis based on isokinetic dynamometry parameters. Materials and methodsThirty patients with a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis involving the ankle(s) and 30 healthy subjects (control group) matched for age, gender, race, body mass index and lower limb dominance were studied. Dorsiflexion, plantar flexion, inversion and eversion were evaluated in all subjects on an isokinetic Cybex Norm dynamometer. The variables were compared between the rheumatoid arthritis and control groups and between {{the right and left}} ankles, and the dorsiflexor/plantar flexor and invertor/evertor muscle strength ratio was determined. ResultsPatients with rheumatoid arthritis performed statistically worse in the isokinetic dynamometry test for all <b>ankle</b> <b>movements.</b> The muscle strength ratio between dorsiflexors and plantar flexors was different in the two groups. No significant differences were observed in the invertor and evertor ratios. In the two groups the plantar flexor musculature was statistically stronger than dorsiflexors. ConclusionWe conclude that patients with rheumatoid arthritis perform worse in isokinetic dynamometry regarding all <b>ankle</b> <b>movements</b> than control subjects, with similar isokinetic test results being observed for the right and left side in both groups, with few exceptions. Isokinetic evaluation posed no additional risk such as important pain or inflammatory activity to patients with rheumatoid arthritis...|$|R
40|$|Severe ankle {{injuries}} {{can result}} in ligament rupture or a fracture. A major problem after such injuries is limitation in mobility. Weight bearing tasks, such as walking, become a problem because of pain, deficits in joint range of motion and muscle strength. This thesis studies a key dilemma in early rehabilitation, whether to immobilise the ankle or allow joint motion to improve mobility outcomes. Studies have focused on two scenarios, severe ligament rupture, and unstable fractures managed through open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF). The analysis of gait outcomes was {{an important component of}} this thesis and a novel analytical method was developed to normalise gait velocity in the estimation of speed-dependent gait outcomes. A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted including evidence to July 2014. The reporting and design of trials was universally poor. In the 6 weeks of recovery following ankle ORIF surgery, there was insufficient evidence that early <b>ankle</b> <b>movements</b> offered a benefit to mobility recovery compared with immobilisation in a cast. <b>Ankle</b> <b>movements</b> compared with immobilisation reduced the risk of venous thrombosis/thromboembolism. However, compared with cast immobilisation, the risk of deep and superficial surgical site infection and fixation-related complications were higher when <b>ankle</b> <b>movements</b> were permitted. To investigate the role of ankle supports in rehabilitation of walking after ORIF, two randomised cross-over studies were completed. In healthy participants with non-pathological gait, a walker boot induced gait abnormalities when compared with Tubigrip (elasticated bandage). There were no important differences in gait between a stirrup brace and Tubigrip. In people who had undergone ankle ORIF 6 weeks previously, a walker boot {{and to a lesser extent}} a stirrup brace offered improvements in gait symmetry and lower pain scores when compared with Tubigrip. Finally, a secondary analysis of the Collaborative Ankle Support Trial cohort (n= 584) was conducted, which concluded that, in comparison to Tubigrip, 10 days of cast immobilisation provided greater probability of recovery of a range of mobility outcomes 4 weeks following injury. This thesis contributes evidence favouring a role for ankle immobilisation in improving mobility following severe ankle injury in adults. Clinicians should be aware of the benefits and risk of harms outlined, as well as the limitations in the current evidence base. This thesis is not currently available on ORA...|$|R

OBJECTIVES: To compare early <b>ankle</b> <b>movement</b> versus ankle {{immobilization}} after surgery for ankle fracture on clinical and patient-reported outcomes. BACKGROUND: A {{significant proportion of}} patients undergoing surgery for ankle fracture experience postoperative complications and delayed return to function. The {{risks and benefits of}} movement of the ankle in the first 6 weeks after surgery are not known, and clinical practice varies widely. METHODS: We searched bibliographic databases and reference lists to identify eligible trials. Two independent reviewers conducted data extraction and risk-of-bias assessments. RESULTS: Fourteen trials (705 participants) were included in the review, 11 of which were included in the meta-analysis. The quality of the trials was universally poor. The pooled effect of early <b>ankle</b> <b>movement</b> on function at 9 to 12 weeks after surgery compared to immobilization was inconclusive (standardized mean difference, 0. 46; 95 % confidence interval: - 0. 02, 0. 93; P =. 06; I(2) = 72 %), and no differences were observed between groups at 1 year. The odds of venous thromboembolism were significantly lower with early <b>ankle</b> <b>movement</b> compared to immobilization (Peto odds ratio = 0. 12; 95 % confidence interval: 0. 02, 0. 71; P =. 02; I(2) = 0 %).

40|$|Objective: This study {{evaluated}} {{the effects of}} a structured nurse-led education programme that aimed to improve patient concordance and prevent venous leg ulcer recurrence. • Method: The design was quasi-experimental. Subjects (average age: 80) had venous leg ulceration that had healed within the previous two years, and were cared for at home by a district nurse. Data were available on 49 patients with 97 legs, 72 of which had had venous leg ulcers. Patients were divided into two groups: a control group, which received ‘usual’ care, and an experimental group, which was exposed to the education programme. Recurrence rates, the effects of the education on patient behaviour and the effect on recurrence of having both <b>ankle</b> <b>movement</b> and general mobility were measured over one year. • Results: Patients in the experimental group experienced significantly less recurrence over the year (log rank test= 8. 28, p= 0. 004). To control for differences in mobility and <b>ankle</b> <b>movement</b> in the control and experimental groups at baseline, simultaneous logistic regression analysis was undertaken. This revealed a significant advantage for patients in the experimental group (p= 0. 035; OR= 4. 45, 95 % CI= 1. 11 – 17. 74), who spent more time with their legs elevated each day. This difference was sustained throughout the 52 weeks (f= 2. 88, p= 0. 015). Those who had both full <b>ankle</b> <b>movement</b> (> 60 degrees) and full mobility (without aid) had significantly less recurrence (p= 0. 042). Education had no significant effect on the amount of time patients wore compression hosiery (f= 2. 1). • Conclusion: A structured nurse-led patient concordance programme is effective in preventing venous leg ulcer recurrence and increasing the time patients spend with their legs elevated at heart level. Having both full <b>ankle</b> <b>movement</b> and full mobility reduces the risk of recurrence. • Declaration of interest: None...|$|E

40|$|Muscle {{weakness}} is consistently associated with {{falls in the}} elderly people, typically when present along with other risk factors. However, it remains unknown whether and how muscle weakness alone affects balance. This hampers development of more effective fall prevention strategies. Clinical observations suggest that the amount and distribution of muscle weakness influences balance control. We therefore investigated balance corrections in patients with either predominantly proximal (limb girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD); n= 8) or distal (distal spinal muscular atrophy; n= 5) leg weakness, and 27 matched healthy controls. Balance was perturbed using surface tilt rotations that were delivered randomly in eight directions. Balance measures were full body kinematics and surface electromyographic activity (EMG) of leg, arm, and trunk muscles. Both patient groups were more unstable than controls, as reflected by greater excursions of the centre of mass (COM), especially in the pitch (anterior-posterior (AP)) plane. COM displacements were greater in distal weakness patients. Patients with distal weakness had excessive and unstable trunk, knee and <b>ankle</b> <b>movements,</b> and this was present following both forward and backward directed balance perturbations, possibly reflecting the greater use of distal leg muscles in these directions. In contrast, the less weak proximal weakness patients demonstrated unstable trunk and <b>ankle</b> <b>movements</b> only for backward directed balance perturbations. Both patient groups used arm movements to compensate for their instability. We conclude that primarily distal but also proximal muscle weakness leads to significant postural instability. This observation, together with the retained ability of patients to use compensatory arm movements, provides targets that may be amenable to improvement with therapeutic interventio...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE—To {{investigate}} {{the relation between}} response to common peroneal nerve stimulation, timed to the swing phase of walking, and abnormal <b>ankle</b> <b>movement</b> and muscle activation patterns.  METHOD—Eighteen patients who took part had a drop foot and had had a stroke at least 6 months before the study Twelve age matched normal subjects were also studied. Response to stimulation was measured by changes in the speed and effort of walking when the stimulator was used. Speed was measured over 10 m and effort by the physiological cost index. Abnormal <b>ankle</b> <b>movement</b> and muscle activation were measured in a rig by ability to follow a tracking signal moving sinusoidally at either 1 or 2 Hz, resistance to passive movement, and EMG activity during both passive and active movements. Indices were derived to define EMG response to passive stretch, coactivation, and ability to activate muscles appropriately during active movement RESULTS—Different mechanisms underlying the drop foot were seen. Results showed that patients who had poor control of <b>ankle</b> <b>movement</b> and spasticity, demonstrated by stretch reflex and coactivation, {{were more likely to}} respond well to stimulation. Those with mechanical resistance to passive movement and with normal muscle activation responded less well.  CONCLUSIONS—The results support the hypothesis that stimulation of the common peroneal nerve to elicit a contraction of the anterior tibial muscles also inhibits the antagonist calf muscles.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} <b>ankle</b> <b>movements</b> {{of healthy}} individuals {{walking on a}} treadmill, {{by means of a}} flexible electrogoniometer. METHOD: Dorsiflexion and plantar flexion and eversion/inversion movements were recorded for 90 seconds at a velocity of 5. 0 km/h. Ten healthy young men of mean age 21. 4 ± 2. 99 years and mean height 1. 62 ± 0. 22 meters took part in this study. The data were analyzed descriptively (mean, standard deviation, maximum and minimum). In the sagittal plane, the gait cycle was analyzed at three times, taking the movement peaks: foot flat (FF), midstance (M) and toe off (TO). The inversion and eversion angles corresponding to these phases were identified, as well as movement peaks during gait cycles. Inter and intra-subject coefficients of variability (CV) were calculated. RESULTS: The mean values for the sagittal plane, for the left and right ankles were, respectively: 7 º and 4 º at FF, 2 º and 7 º at M, and 24 º and 19 º at TO. For the frontal plane, the results were inversion of 5 º and 3 º FF, 4 º and 5 º at M, and 15 º and 16 º at TO. The peak values were inversion of 17 º and 18 º and eversion of 1 º. The maximum intra-subject CV was 0. 39, and the maximum inter-subject CV was 0. 44. CONCLUSION: The results obtained from the electrogoniometer were relatively similar to data reported in the literature for the sagittal plane, but not for the frontal plane.

Three kinds of illusory movements were compared. The first was induced by vibration patterns copying {{the responses of}} muscle spindle afferents previously recorded by microneurography during imposed <b>ankle</b> <b>movements.</b> The two others were generated by the model.

To improve the current performance of below-knee prostheses, we study {{the feasibility of}} using the amputee’s residual limb EMG signals to control the ankle position of an active ankle-foot prosthesis. We propose two control schemes to predict the amputee’s intended ankle position: a neural network approach and a muscle model approach. We test these approaches using EMG data measured from an amputee for several target <b>ankle</b> <b>movement</b> patterns. We find that both controllers demonstrate the ability to predict desired <b>ankle</b> <b>movement</b> patterns qualitatively. In the current implementation, the biomimetic EMG-controller demonstrates a smoother and more natural movement pattern than that demonstrated by the neural network approach, suggesting that a biologically-motivated, model-based approach may offer certain advantages in the control of active ankle prostheses.

The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate the short-term effect of dynamic-repeated-passive <b>ankle</b> <b>movements</b> with weight loading on ambulatory function and spastic hypertonia of chronic stroke patients. In this study, 12 chronic stroke patients with ankle spasticity and inefficient ambulatory ability were enrolled. Stretching of the plantar-flexors of the ankle in the standing position for 15 minutes was performed passively by a constant-speed and electrically powered device. The following evaluations were done before and immediately after the dynamic-repeated-passive <b>ankle</b> <b>movements.</b> Spastic hypertonia was assessed by the Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS; range, 0 – 4), Achilles tendon reflexes test (DTR; range, 0 – 4), and ankle clonus (range, 0 – 5). Improvement in ambulatory ability was determined by the timed up-and-go test (TUG), the 10 -minute walking test, and cadence (steps/minute). In addition, subjective experience of the influence of ankle spasticity on ambulation was scored by visual analog scale (VAS). Subjective satisfaction with the therapeutic effect of spasticity reduction was evaluated by a five-point questionnaire (1 = very poor, 2 = poor, 3 = acceptable, 4 = good, 5 = very good). By comparison of the results before and after intervention, these 12 chronic stroke patients presented significant reduction in MAS and VAS for ankle spasticity, the time for TUG and 10 -minute walking speed (p < 0. 01). The cadence also increased significantly (p < 0. 05). In addition, subjective satisfaction with the short-term therapeutic effect was mainly good (ranging from acceptable to very good). In conclusion, 15 minutes of dynamic-repeated-passive ankle joint motion exercise with weight loading in the standing position by this simple constant-speed machine is effective in reducing ankle spasticity and improving ambulatory ability...|$|R
40|$|An unusual case of {{tuberculosis}} {{of the lower}} end of the fibula in a young patient is reported. The patient presented with symptoms of pain and swelling over the outer aspect of the right ankle with full range of painless <b>ankle</b> <b>movements.</b> The plain radiographs of the ankle were normal but MRI scan showed increased signals within {{the lower end of}} the fibula on T 2 -weighted images. The histology of the lesion showed only a few Langhans giant cells and culture failed to grow any organism. Polymerase chain reac-tion analysis of the biopsy specimen, however, showed growth of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The patient responded to antitubercular treatment with complete resolution of symptoms. Polymerase chain reaction analysis should be considered in atypical presentations with bone pain to rule out an occult infectious pathology...|$|R
40|$|During {{the stance}} {{phase of the}} human step cycle, the ankle {{undergoes}} a natural dorsiflexion that stretches the soleus muscle. The afferent feedback resulting from this stretch enhances the locomotor drive. In this study a robotic actuator was used to slightly enhance or reduce the natural ankle dorsiflexion, in essence, mimicking the small variations in the <b>ankle</b> dorsiflexion <b>movement</b> that take place during the stance phase of the step cycle. The soleus (SOL) and tibialis anterior EMG were analyzed {{in response to the}} ankle trajectory modifications. The dorsiflexion enhancements and reductions generated gradual increments and decrements, respectively, in the ongoing SOL EMG. We exercised care to ensure that the imposed <b>ankle</b> <b>movements</b> were too slow to elicit distinct burst-like stretch reflex responses that have been investigated previously. The increased SOL EMG after the dorsiflexion enhancements was reduced when the group Ia afferents were blocked with peripheral ischemia at the thigh, and during high-frequency Achilles tendon vibration. However, neither ischemia nor tendon vibration affected the decrements in the SOL EMG during the dorsiflexion reductions. These findings give evidence of the contribution of afferent feedback to the SOL activity in an ongoing basis during the stance phase. The results suggest that mainly feedback from the group Ia pathways is responsible for the increments in the SOL EMG during the dorsiflexion enhancements. However, the decrements in the SOL activity might be mediated by different afferent mechanisms...|$|R
