The concept of Gegenständlichkeit discussed by Grass in several essays and in novels acts as a foil to his work. The role of Gegenständlichkeit is examined in two steps: firstly Günter Grass own concept of art is presented; and secondly five Grass-books, as a special form of the concept of Gegenständlichkeit, are analysed. The so-called Text-Bild-Bände contain both literary texts and visual artwork. Grass calls this the neue, alle meine Möglichkeiten versammelnde Form (Fünf Jahrzehnte. Ein Werkstattbericht). The first part of this study deals with Grass visual artwork as a continuous part of his production. In the second part Grass understanding of Gegenständlichkeit and art as inclusive concepts of artistic skill are analysed, as well <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>author</b> <b>s</b> social-political commitment. This is achieved by analyzing two speeches: Vom Stillstand im Fortschritt. Variationen zu Albrecht Dürers Kupferstich Melencolia I (1971) and Der Traum der Vernunft (1984), the latter discussing ideas of the Enlightenment period in relation to Goya s aquatinta etching El sueño de la razón produce monstrous. The third and central part of this study focuses on the five text-picture-books in the order of date of publication: Zunge zeigen (1988), Totes Holz (1990), Fundsachen für Nichtleser (1997), Mein Jahrhundert (1999) und Letzte Tänze (2003). Zunge zeigen, being Grass first text-picture-book, is given special analytical attention, not only because it is the first one: It is also the one with the most stringent performance. The analysis of all of Grass Text-Bild-Bände shows that the combination of the literary text and the visual artwork in each text-picture-book are composed specifically for each book, including the design of the physical book as a product. Grass uses pictures and text within one book to put the main subject of his interest into different perspectives. Different artforms, different literary genres and different forms of composition are used within a Text-Bild-Band. Art for Grass includes different ways of artistic expression. Each technique and literary genre is used for its unique expression. But Grass also crosses the borders between the arts and genres to expand his possibilities of expression. Key words and names: Günter Grass, Kunst (art), Literatur (literature), Text (text), Bild (picture), Gattung (genre), Gegenständlichkeit, Aufklärung (enlightenment), Melancholie (melancholy), Schuld und Scham (guilt and shame), Geschichte (history), Ethik und Handeln (ethics and action...|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Any composite material is made up from two or more materials and therefore contains interfaces, which usually represent planes of weakness. Interfacial fractures are effectively constrained to propagate along these interfaces as mixed-mode fractures with all three opening, shearing and tearing actions (i. e. mode I, mode II and mode III), instead of kinking to maintain pure-mode-I conditions at the advancing crack front, as would typically happen in an isotropic material. This is significant because mixed-mode fracture toughness is load-dependent and not a purely intrinsic material property (although clearly the pure mode fracture toughnesses are indeed intrinsic material properties that can be determined experimentally). Therefore, in order to know the fracture toughness under general loading conditions, {{it is necessary to}} know both the interface failure criterion (that describes the fracture toughness {{as a function of the}} mode mixity), and the mode mixity of the crack under the specified loading conditions. This is a complex problem that has occupied researchers in the fracture mechanics community for decades. Consequently, the literature contains a large number of different mixed-mode partition theories. This work appears to show that, of all the partition theories assessed, Wang and Harvey s (2012 a) Euler beam partition theory is able to most accurately predict the fracture toughness of a mixed-mode delamination in a fibre-reinforced polymer composite laminate. This statement is based on the outcomes of three separate studies: The first study uses data reported in the literature from a thorough programme of mixed-mode fracture testing of unidirectional and multi-directional laminates. The Euler beam partition theory is able to accurately predict the fracture toughness in all cases. Furthermore, the Euler beam partition theory, which is completely analytical, closely agrees over a large domain with Davidson et al. s (2000) independently-derived non-singular field partition theory, which was derived with the aid of experimental test results. In general, the singular-field approach based on 2 D elasticity and the finite element method give poor predictions. In the second study, an original programme of mixed-mode fracture testing is carried out, which incorporates several novel aspects including new test apparatus and a methodology for testing with a wide range of applied pure bending moments. Eighty five fracture tests are performed on unidirectional glass/epoxy laminates to determine the initiation and propagation fracture toughnesses. Although the second study was inconclusive with respect to the correctness of any particular partition theory, the development of the test apparatus and test methodology are considered to be major contributions that will be useful for both design engineers and academic researchers, not only working with fibre-reinforced polymer composite laminates, but also working with other composite materials containing interfacial cracks. The third study uses digital image correlation to investigate the near-crack tip strain fields of mixed-mode delaminations to try to discover the underlying mechanics that govern the selection of a mixed-mode partition theory. The new testing apparatus is used again, and another novel testing methodology is developed. The work appears to confirm (with some caveats) that two sets of pure modes exist, that is, two pure mode I modes, and two pure mode II modes, with their numerical values roughly corresponding to those from Wang and Harvey s (2012 a) Euler beam partition theory. It should be noted that, as far <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>author</b> <b>s</b> knowledge is concerned, Euler beam partition theory is the only one in the literature to predict the existence of two sets of pure modes. Although this work set out to conclusively determine which mixed-mode partition theory is able to most accurately predict the fracture toughness of a mixed-mode delamination in a fibre-reinforced polymer composite laminate, and also, to discover why, the outcomes cannot truly be called conclusions. Rather, they only offer strong support for Wang and Harvey s (2012 a) Euler beam partition theory for predicting the fracture toughness fibre-reinforced polymer composite laminates against delamination. Despite this, the work makes major contributions that will be useful for both design engineers and academic researchers in the field, as described in the above...|$|E

40|$|A forty-hour flight {{program was}} {{completed}} to study {{signal to noise}} ratio, lane counting and position accuracy using a low cost Omega navigation system in a general aviation aircraft. Specific test objectives were developed to investigate signals both {{on the bench and}} in the air. Signal to noise ratio and lane counting characteristics were investigated in a single frequency, uncorrected mode and in a pseudo-differential mode. It was learned that the received signal to noise ratio is highly correlated with lane counting characteristics and receiver navigability. The relationship between system accuracy and reliability was also examined. The Omega navigation system's bias and position accuracy were investigated with the aid of the Discrete Address Beacon System (DABS). A circular probable error of 3500 feet was observed. It was also determined that certain necessary hardware and system improvements must be implemented before a completely usable Omega navigation system can be offered to the general aviation user.

40|$|This report {{describes}} an extensive evaluation of Loran-C {{for use by}} general aviation. Flight, ground, and antenna tests were done. Flight tests measured the accuracy {{and the ability to}} make approaches. Receiver reliability and susceptibility to atmospheric noise were also studied. Ground tests looked into grid stability and grid war page. Antenna tests were done to evaluate three antenna configurations [...] ADF, vertical whip, and trailing wire antennas. The measured accuracy met FAA AC 90 - 45 A requirements for all phases of flight. Loran-C was found to be satisfactory for approaches within AC 90 - 45 A specifications. Reliability was 99. 7 %, the receiver was insensitive to atmospheric noise. The time difference grid was stable in the long run. Antenna tests showed the ADF and vertical whip antennas to be suitable for airborne use. It is concluded that Loran-C is suitable for navigation as an alternative to VHF RNAV.

The investigation begins with an extensive survey {{of the past and}} current air transportation demand models. The model selected uses linear and non-linear log specifications to account for the secular trend and detrended variables to account for the cyclical variations. These transformations allow determination of the coefficients comparable to delta log models and simultaneously retain the forecasting ability of linear log models. Forecasts are provided to 1990 for both the linear and non-linear secular trends. Results show that the price is the most stable and significant determinant of demand. Income and the rate of inflation are both significant but are more variable and highly dependent on the type of secular trend and the time period used in the regression. The non-linear secular trend model provided the best overall fit and explained 96 % of the variation in demand.

The preferred shape {{was found to have}} a large central region of uniform power density, with a roughly cosinusoidal. profile near the ends of the assembly.

State of the art computational methods, LEOPARD and PDQ- 7, were used to evaluate the beginning-of-life and burnup history behavior of a series of three-zone assembly designs, all of which had a large central zone followed by a shorter region of higher enrichment, and with a still thinner blanket of depleted uranium fuel pellets at the outer periphery. It was found that if annular fuel pellets were used in the higher enrichment zone, a design ! was created which not only had the best uranium savings (2. 8 % more energy from the same amount of natural. uranium, compared to a conventional, uniform, unblanketed design), but also had a power shape with a lower peak-to-average power ratio (by 16. 5 %) than the reference case, and which held its power shape very nearly constant over life. This contrasted with the designs without part length annular fuel, which tended to burn into an end-peaked power distribution, and with blanket-only designs, which had a poorer peak-to-average power ratio than the reference udblanketed case.

40|$|Current and {{anticipated}} {{thermal pollution}} regulations will prevent many new steam electric power plants from operating with once-through cooling. Alternative cooling systems acceptable from an environmental view fail {{to operate with}} the same efficiencies, in terms of resources consumed per Kwh of electricity produced, offered by once-through cooling systems. As a consequence there are clear conflicts between meeting environmental objectives and meeting minimum cost and minimum resource consumption objectives. This report examines, at both the regional and national level, the costs of satisfying environmental objec- tives through the existing thermal pollution regulations. This study forecasts the costs of operating those megawatts of new generating capacity to be installed between the years 1975 and 2000 which {{will be required to}} install closed cycle cooling solely to comply with thermal regulations. A regionally disaggregated approach is used in the forecasts in order to preserve <b>as</b> much of <b>the</b> anticipated inter-regional variation in future capacity growth rates and economic trends <b>as</b> possible. <b>The</b> net costs of closed cycle cooling over once- through cooling are based on comparisons of the costs of owning and operating optimal closed and open-cycle cooling configurations in separate regions, using computer codes to simulate joint power plant/ cooling system operation. The expected future costs of current thermal pollution regulations are determined for the mutually exclusive - collectively exhaustive eighteen Water Resources Council Regions within the contiguous U. S., and are expressed in terms of additional dollar expenditures, water losses and energy consumption. These costs are then compared with the expected resource commitments associated with the normal operation of the steam electric power industry. It is found that while energy losses appear to be small, the dollar costs could threaten the profitability of those utility systems which have historically used once-through cooling extensively throughout their system. In addition the additional water demands of closed cycle cooling are likely to disrupt the water supplies in those coastal areas having few untapped freshwater supplies available.

40|$|Introduction: The {{purpose of}} Air Traffic Control {{is to ensure}} {{separation}} of aircraft in the most efficient manner possible. The need for efficiency is becoming more important as air traffic continues to increase at a high rate. Terminal area traffic control is {{the area in which}} the greatest amount of effort is expended since this tends to be the limiting factor in airspace congestion. The current Automated Radar Terminal System provides a monitoring function which was unheard of with previous systems. However, this is not sufficient in view of the increasing air traffic. More improvements are needed in the exchange of information between the ground controller and the aircraft. The proposed upgraded Air Traffic Control system will provide better data acquisition, communications service, and increased automation. Future systems should be capable of providing more complete automation in terms of command generation and delivery. These systems are called Strategic Navigation or Four-Dimensional Navigation. The principle of these systems is to assign a route-time profile to each aircraft thus providing good management of energy, space, and runways. This method utilizes a fixed airspace structure with a variable flight path to de-randomize aircraft runway arrival time. The method favored by the Federal Aviation Administration consists of ground computation of heading, altitude, and airspeed commands which are broadcast to the aircraft via digital data-link. These commands can be either visually displayed for manual operation by the pilot or at some future time directly tied into the aircraft auto-pilot. The {{purpose of this study is}} to simulate the flight of an aircraft on a terminal approach in a Four-Dimensional Navigation environment using discrete control commands. During the flight, position information is estimated from noisy radar observations. Speed is estimated from these observations and is used in a timed delivery algorithm to determine when to issue commands to the aircraft. Time control precision will be experimentally determined in the presence of the radar disturbance and accuracy of the Four-Dimensional Navigation task in the presence of this uncertainty will be quantified. A number of studies have previously been conducted to determine fix-to-fix and runway arrival time accuracy. These studies neglected the effect of wind and assumed perfect radar position information. For this reason a comprehensive model for these two effects was developed. Originally presented <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>author's</b> thesis, (M. <b>S.)</b> in the M. I. T.

40|$|This {{investigation}} {{has attempted to}} provide acurrent estimate of the oil potential of the northern North Sea from which estimates of exploration investment, development investment, and accruing cash-flows can be derived. Current proven reserves are estimated at 29. 4 billion barrels oil equivalent, of which 22. 6 billion barrels are oil. Of the 59 discoveries documented, 8 can be classed as true gas accumulations. Undiscovered potential for the area of study is estimated at 24. 3 billion barrels, giving a most probable ultimate recoverable reserve of 53. 7 billion barrels oil equivalent. Depending on minimum commercial field size, recoverable oil reserves should vary between 33. 7 and 39. 2 billion barrels. Current development of 14. 8 billion barrels of recoverable oil involves an estimated capital investment of $ 16. 8 billion dollars. Peak daily production is estimated to occur in 1981 at 4. 12 million barrels daily. An additional 4. 6 billion barrels of recoverable oil is {{in various stages of}} evaluation and will probably be developed, yielding a total of 19. 4 billion barrels of reserves and a total peak production of 4. 95 million barrels per day in 1981. Capital investment is estimated at $ 27 billion dollars for the total. In order to develop current plus discovered plus future discoveries, private industry is estimated to require between $ 56 and $ 70 billion dollars. Most of this investment, including approximately $ 6 billion additional outlay for exploration, is anticipated to occur between now and 1985. Peak production of 6. 58 to 7. 85 million barrels per day is estimated to occur around 1986, representing a total reserve development of approximately 34. 4 to 38. 4 billion barrels of oil. Private industry is anticipated to earn between $ 30 and $ 56 billion dollars whereas government take, assuming a lower discount rate, is estimated to run between $ 83 and $ 222 billion dollars. Critical to this analysis are assumptions about host-government tax policy and the world price of crude oil, especially as pertaining to "marginal" North Sea fields. Utilizing an econometric model developed by the Supply Analysis Group of the M. I. T. World Oil Project, investigation of discounted cash-flow profiles for various field sizes indicates that access to crude supply and development of subsequent discoveries appear to be the primary economic incentives for continuing to operate smaller fields after peak production is obtained. Tax policy and high operating costs relative to productive capacity tend to make small fields less attractive investments. Finally, it is patently obvious that very high per-well productivity is essential for viable development of North Sea fields under current economic, political, fiscal, and technical constraints.

40|$|Traditionally, only {{space heating}} and {{transportation}} have consumed more fuel than industrial process steam generation. Several {{recent studies have}} examined electricity and industrial steam supply and have recommended vigorous federal efforts to increase the cogeneration, or joint production, of electricity and process steam. The conceptual approach and analytic methods employed in these studies contain flaws that make them incomplete. The studies' recommendations are premised upon the existence of distortions in the markets surrounding cogeneration, but they offer only anecdotal evidence of such market failures. They propose increased cogeneration, citing aggregate energy savings for a single year and cumulative capital savings, but the analytic techniques they use in simulating market behavior and evaluating the desirability of various levels of cogeneration lack needed sophistication. This research addresses several of the methodological objections to the earlier studies. To unite this effort, the report poses two focal questions on cogeneration policy and economics: * Can the historical decline in cogeneration's importance be explained by changes in fuel prices and technologies alone? * What is the best future role for cogeneration if the choice is based on economic efficiency? First, the markets associated with cogeneration are examined from a qualitative perspective, employing the classic basic conditions/market structure/conduct/performance approach of industrial economics to explore the potential for inefficient market performance. Engineering production and cost functions are developed for a simple cogeneration plant design, offering insights into the economies of scale and joint production problems involved in the choice between cogeneration and separated production alternatives. Second, a multi-period linear programming model, called the Joint Generation Supply Model or JGSM, is form- ulated to simulate competitive market behavior in the aggregate U,S. electricity and process steam supply markets throughout a given time interval. JGSM is used to study the historical performance of these markets for 1960 to 1972 and the future role o cogeneration for 1975 to 2000, Appendices survey cogeneration technologies and the issues in integrating cogeneration plants into the utility system. The modeling of the historical question shows the decline {{can be explained by}} changes in cost conditions, but these results are very sensitive to the engineering cost assumptions. Analysis of cogeneration's future role indicates cogeneration should increase from its 4. 5 % share of electricity supply in 1975 to 9 % in 1985; it should also serve more than half the process steam supply. If cogeneration remains at its 1975 share through 2000, the additional costs imposed are worth about $ 10 billion in discounted capital and operating expenses. Too much cogeneration can hurt as much as too little: forcing it up to a 20 % share by 1985 imposes similar costs. For comparison of these losses to another issue, JGSM calculated that failure to develop low-Btu coalgasifying combined cycle power technologies results in losses worth $ 4 billion.
