He {{served as president of the}} Springfield City Council from 1979 to 1983 while teaching high school history courses and lecturing at local colleges. He served as mayor of Springfield from 1983 to 1989, overseeing a period of economic growth.

5|$|This bipedal ornithopod {{is known}} from several partial skeletons and skulls that {{indicate}} it grew to between 2.5 and 4.0meters (8.2 to 13.1ft) in length on average. It had sturdy hind limbs, small wide hands, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>head</b> with an elongate pointed snout. The {{form of the}} teeth and jaws suggest a primarily herbivorous animal. This genus of dinosaur {{is regarded as a}} specialized basal ornithopod, traditionally described as a hypsilophodont, but more recently recognized as distinct from Hypsilophodon. Several species have been suggested for this genus. Three currently are recognized as valid: the type species T. neglectus, T. garbanii and T. assiniboiensis.|$|E

5|$|A route {{popular with}} {{experienced}} hillwalkers starts at Torlundy, {{a few miles}} north-east of Fort William on the A82 road, and follows the path alongside the Allt a' Mhuilinn. It can also be reached from Glen Nevis by following the Pony Track as far as Lochan Meall an t-Suidhe, then descending slightly to the CIC Hut. The route then ascends Càrn Mòr Dearg and continues along the Càrn Mòr Dearg Arête ("CMD Arête") before climbing steeply to the summit of Ben Nevis. This route involves a total of 1,500 metres of ascent and requires modest scrambling ability <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>head</b> for heights. In common with other approaches {{on this side of}} the mountain, it has the advantage of giving an extensive view of the cliffs of the north face, which are hidden from the Pony Track.|$|E

25|$|Minifigures {{built from}} special, uniquely molded pieces were first {{introduced}} in Life on Mars. Martians {{are composed of}} five tools: two pairs of double arms, a mechanical torso, a conjoined leg piece, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>head.</b> This configuration is also used for many Star Wars Droids; Battle Droids follow the same pattern, while Super Battle Droids feature a head fixed to a torso, General Grievous has space for four arms, and IG-88 has a head constructed of other Lego pieces. Other droids, such as Droidekas, Spider Droids and Pit Droids, are constructed entirely from standard Lego pieces, yet are still generally considered minifigures. R2-D2 and other astromech droids are constructed from unique parts, with a separate top, body and legs. The robots of Exo-Force, Mars Mission commander aliens and Bionicle miniatures have a design similar to the Star Wars Battle Droids, but with separate legs, movable hands, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>head</b> affixed to a small torso.|$|E

25|$|Goa's public {{transport}} largely consists of privately operated buses linking the major towns to rural areas. Government-run buses, {{maintained by the}} Kadamba Transport Corporation, link major routes (like the Panaji–Margao route) and some remote parts of the state. The Corporation owns 15 bus stands, 4 depots and one Central workshop at Porvorim <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>Head</b> Office at Porvorim. In large towns such as Panajiand Margao, intra-city buses operate. However, {{public transport}} in Goa is less developed, and residents depend heavily on their own transportation, usually motorised two-wheelers and small family cars.|$|E
25|$|On 23 July 1997, {{at around}} 4.30 pm, a sixteen-year-old boy {{discovered}} {{the body of}} a man, lying face down, at the base of an old water tower in Keillers Park, in downtown Göteborg. Called on site, the police determined that the man had been shot twice with a pistol. The first bullet hit him in the back and went right through the heart, while the second was fired to his head as he lay on the ground. A bag <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>head</b> cap were recovered beside the body.|$|E
25|$|On 18 December 1924, {{not long}} after the C.12a's first flight with the Anzani engine in October, the Belgian pilot Raparlier flew it from Waalhaven, Rotterdam to Le Bourget, Paris via Brussels. The whole flight took just under six hours, despite a one-hour stop in Brussels <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>head</b> wind on the second leg, slowing him down and forcing him to land near Le Bourget for extra fuel. The flight drew much attention; after a large number of {{demonstration}} flights in Paris Raparlier returned the C.12a to Waalhaven on 22 February 1924, again getting press attention.|$|E

25|$|A muzzle gag {{works in}} a similar way as an over-the-mouth gag, only that they are usually made of leather, are {{fastened}} around the head with buckles and straps, and cover {{the lower part of the}} face. It is so called because it resembles a muzzle used on animals, with a flexible pad which straps over the mouth, and sometimes also around the cheeks and chin. Muzzle gags have a strong psychological effect on some people, because of the association of being restrained in a way generally associated with animals. Restricting movement of the jaw and covering the cheeks can both increase the efficiency of a gag. It is difficult to draw the line between a muzzle gag <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>head</b> harness with an attached gag.|$|E
25|$|Timpani are {{typically}} struck {{with a special}} type of drum stick called a timpani stick or timpani mallet. Timpani sticks are used in pairs. They have two components: a shaft <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>head.</b> The shaft is typically made from hardwood or bamboo but may also be made from aluminum or carbon fiber. The head can be constructed {{from a number of}} different materials, though felt wrapped around a wooden core is the most common. Other core materials include compressed felt, cork, and leather, and other wrap materials include chamois. Unwrapped sticks with heads of wood, felt, flannel, and leather are also common. Wooden sticks are used as a special effect—specifically requested by composers as early as the Romantic era—and in authentic performances of Baroque music.|$|E
25|$|A. chamaeleon can be {{differentiated}} {{from other}} members of the A. rugosus species group by shorter nasal barbels (1.06.0% length of the head vs. 6.523.9), wide-set eyes (distance between eyes 38.947·5% length of the head), <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>head</b> with gently sloping lateral margins and a broadly rounded snout when viewed dorsally. A. falcifer can be differentiated from {{other members of}} the species group by an adipose fin with a rounded (vs. angular) posterior margin and a longer dorsal-fin base (10.813.1% standard length vs. 7.910.5); generally the colour pattern of A. falcifer is also different in having many small blotches (vs. few large blotches) of various shades of brown, with many small dark brown spots (vs. no spots) on the dorsal surfaces of the head. Both A. falcifer and A. pachyderma lack serrations on the pectoral spine, but the two species can be separated based on their colouration (cream with numerous small blotches of various shades of brown in A. falcifer vs. overall cream in A. pachyderma) and the shape of the posterior margin of the adipose fin. A. pachyderma can be differentiated by its colouration (overall cream vs. generally dark brown with many irregular patches of light brown) and, except for A. falcifer, lack (vs. presence) of serrations on the posterior edge of the pectoral spine. A. rugosus differs from A. chamaeleon in having longer nasal barbels (6.515.6% head length vs. 1.06.0) <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>head</b> with steeply sloping (vs. gentlysloping) lateral margins and a convex (vs. broadly rounded) snout when viewed dorsally; from A. falcifer in having an adipose fin with an angular (vs. rounded) posterior margin; from A. pachyderma in its colouration (generally dark brown with many irregular patches of light brown vs. overall cream) and the presence (vs. lack) of serrations on the posterior edge of the pectoral spine.|$|E

25|$|The old constabulary barracks on {{the main}} street {{was the scene of}} the {{engagement}} known as the Battle of Tallaght, which occurred during the Fenian rising on 5 March 1867. On that night the Fenians moved out to assemble at the appointed place on Tallaght Hill. The large number of armed men alarmed the police in Tallaght who sent warning to the nearest barracks. There were fourteen constables <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>head</b> constable under Sub-inspector Burke at Tallaght, and they took up a position outside the barracks where they commanded the roads from both Greenhills and Templeogue. The first body of armed men came from Greenhills and, when they came under police fire, retreated. Next a party came from Templeogue, and were also dispersed. In 1936 a skeleton, sword-bayonet and water bottle were found in a hollow tree stump near Terenure. It is thought that these were the remains of one of the Fenians who had taken refuge there after the Battle of Tallaght and either died of his wounds or was frozen to death.|$|E
