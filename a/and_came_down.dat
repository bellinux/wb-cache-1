25|$|The {{second wave}} of mission Elmira arrived at 22:55, and because no other {{pathfinder}} aids were operating, they headed for the Eureka beacon on LZ O. That wave too came under severe ground fire as it passed directly over German positions. One serial released early <b>and</b> <b>came</b> <b>down</b> near the German lines, but the second came down on Landing Zone O. Nearly all of both battalions joined the 82nd Airborne by morning, and 15 guns were in operation on June 8.|$|E
25|$|During {{the morning}} of 23 October 1642 the Royalists formed in battle order on the brow of Edge Hill, facing towards Kineton. Parliamentarian {{commander}} Essex found Charles in a strong position with an equal force to his own 14,000, {{and some of his}} regiments were still some miles distant. However, when he advanced beyond Kineton, and the Royalists left their strong position <b>and</b> <b>came</b> <b>down</b> {{to the foot of the}} hill; Essex had to fight, or risk the starvation of his army in the midst of hostile garrisons.|$|E

25|$|The 1824 presidential {{election}} operated without political parties <b>and</b> <b>came</b> <b>down</b> to a four-man race. Each candidate (Henry Clay, William Crawford, Andrew Jackson, and John Quincy Adams), {{all of whom}} were nominally Democratic Republicans, had a regional base of support involving factions in the various states. With no electoral college majority, the choice devolved on the United States House of Representatives. Clay was not among the three finalists, but as Speaker of the House he negotiated the settlement. Jackson, despite having won the most popular votes and the most electoral votes, was not elected. John Quincy Adams, son of former President John Adams, was elected, and he immediately chose Clay as Secretary of State.|$|E
25|$|Babe Ruth, who got {{his first}} hit as a Yankee at Shibe Park on April 14, 1920, hit a blast to deep left-center on September 9, 1921, that cleared the then-single {{bleacher}} stand, went across the street, and hit a tree over 500feet away. On May 21, 1930, Ruth hit one to right field over the 12-foot wall that landed in Opal Street, the alley behind the second row of houses, again over 500feet distant and {{said to be the}} longest ever home run hit at Shibe Park. The longest strike ever hit there is said to be Ted Williams's prodigious foul ball blast that cleared the high roof at the right field line, passed over 20th, over Opal, over Garnet, <b>and</b> <b>came</b> <b>down</b> on 19th Street.|$|E
25|$|Before {{the first}} {{examination}} for her tragedy class, {{she tried to}} straighten her abundance of frizzy hair, which made it even more uncontrollable, <b>and</b> <b>came</b> <b>down</b> with a bad cold, which made her voice so nasal that she hardly recognized it. Furthermore, the parts assigned for her perform were classical and required carefully stylized emotions, while she preferred romanticism and fully and naturally expressing her emotions. The teachers ranked her 14th in tragedy and second in comedy. Once again, Morny came to her rescue. He put in a good word for her with the National Minister of the Arts, Camille Doucet. Doucet recommended her to Edouard Thierry, the chief administrator of the Théâtre Français, who offered Bernhardt a place as a pensionnaire at the theater, at a minimum salary.|$|E

25|$|Following {{the start}} of World War I, Moon soon enlisted in the Royal Naval Air Service with the rank of Flight Sub-Lieutenant. His {{military}} service took him to East Africa, based on HMS Hyacinth, from where on 6 January 1917 {{he was on a}} reconnaissance flight with Cdr. Richard Bridgeman as observer. They were forced to land with engine trouble <b>and</b> <b>came</b> <b>down</b> in a creek of the Rufiji River delta where they destroyed the seaplane to avoid the possibility of its being captured by the enemy. They then spent three days wandering in the delta trying to avoid capture and to rejoin their ship. During this time they had little or nothing to eat, and were continually obliged to swim across the creeks, the bush on the banks being impenetrable.|$|E
25|$|Pittsburgh then marched 67 {{yards to}} score the winning {{touchdown}}. Running back Byron Bam Morris scored the game-winning 1-yard touchdown run with 1:34 {{remaining in the}} game to pull Pittsburgh ahead for good. The drive was aided by O'Donnell's 9-yard completion to Hastings on fourth down and 3 from the 47-yard line, {{as well as an}} earlier dropped potential interception that went {{in and out of the}} arms of linebacker Quentin Coryatt. On the next play after Hastings' fourth down conversion catch, O'Donnell completed a 37-yard pass to Ernie Mills on the Indianapolis 1-yard line, setting up Morris' 1-yard scoring run. The Colts got the ball back and advanced to the Steelers' 29 with 5 seconds left, narrowly avoiding a turnover when defensive back Chris Oldham dropped a wide open interception. On the game's final play, Harbaugh attempted a hail mary pass which he lofted high <b>and</b> <b>came</b> <b>down</b> into a crowd of players in the end zone; the ball momentarily was against the Colts' WR Aaron Bailey's chest but it hit the turf before he could haul it in.|$|E
25|$|In 1841 James David Forbes, {{professor}} of natural philosophy at the University of Edinburgh, {{came to see}} the Matterhorn. A philosopher and geologist, and an observant traveller, he continued the work of De Saussure in his journeys and his writings. He was full of admiration for the Matterhorn, calling it the most wonderful peak in the Alps, unsealed and unscalable. These words, pronounced by a man noted among all his contemporaries for his thorough knowledge of mountains, show what men's feelings then were towards the Matterhorn, and how {{at a time when the}} idea of Alpine exploration was gaining ground in their minds, the Matterhorn stood by itself as a mountain apart, of whose conquest it was vain even to dream. And such it remained till long after this; as such it was described by John Ball twenty years later in his celebrated guide-book. Forbes ascended the Theodul Pass in 1842, climbed the Breithorn, <b>and</b> <b>came</b> <b>down</b> to Breuil; as he descended from the savage scenery of the Matterhorn, the Italian landscapes of the Valtournanche seemed to him like paradise. Meanwhile Gottlieb Samuel Studer, the geographer, together with Melchior Ulrich, was describing and mapping the topographical features of the Zermatt peaks.|$|E

500|$|While Origen {{argued for}} a naturalistic explanation, John Chrysostom viewed the star as purely miraculous: [...] "How then, tell me, did the star point out a spot so confined, just {{the space of a}} manger and shed, unless it left that height <b>and</b> <b>came</b> <b>down,</b> and stood over the very head of the young child? And at this the evangelist was hinting when he said, [...] "Lo, the star went before them, till it came and stood over where the young Child was." ...|$|E

He said that he was paying homages to Keaton and Chaplin. Barfi!s Oscar selection for Best Foreign Language Film was criticised because of plagiarism, but Oscar selection committee chief Manju Borah defended the film by saying, [...] "Barfi! deserves to be sent outside.

His jet in an unrecoverable spin, Weihs bailed out <b>and</b> <b>came</b> <b>down</b> near the Hamburg-Berlin railroad tracks. The airfield at Kaltenkirchen was immediately informed. Waldmann and Schrey were initially believed missing. Waldmann's body was recovered the next day near Schwarzenbek, roughly [...] away from the crash site of his Me 262. Apparently {{he had managed to}} bail out but failed to deploy his parachute in time, although the injuries sustained during the crash with Weihs' aircraft may have already been fatal as the recovery party found Waldmann with his upper forehead smashed. Schrey was also found dead. He had bailed out with his parachute, but his body was found riddled by machine-gun bullets.|$|E

2500|$|Meanwhile, the routed Roman cavalry and skirmishers {{were just}} straggling into camp {{when they found}} {{themselves}} {{face to face with}} the Nervii – they ran again.

The accompanying party of four consisted of Andrea, the composer's younger brother Francesco who had come specially from Bergamo for this purpose, Dr. Rendu, and a nurse-custodian Antoine Pourcelot. They traveled by train to Amiens, then on to Brussels, after which they traveled in two coaches (one of which was Donizetti's sent ahead to await the party).
