5|$|The {{nature reserve}} {{itself is a}} large expanse of wetland and pools. There {{are a number of}} paths <b>and</b> <b>trails</b> for {{visitors}} to follow, and seven bird hides from which to observe the wildlife. The flora and fauna is extremely varied due to the numerous types of habitat, and includes many species that are otherwise rare in the area.|$|E
5|$|After the {{creation}} of the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) in 1933, nine camps and eight subcamps were set up in Boise National Forest, but the number of camps was reduced from 1934 until the program was closed in 1942. Work conducted by the CCC included fire suppression, fish habitat improvement, and construction of guard houses, fire lookouts, campgrounds, roads, <b>and</b> <b>trails,</b> among other facilities.|$|E
5|$|Roads <b>and</b> <b>trails</b> in {{the state}} forest are also open for horseback riding and {{mountain}} biking. Some trails are dedicated to cross-country skiing and snowmobiling in winter. The state forest is open for primitive camping, although certain areas require a permit. Small campfires are allowed, except from March to mid-May and October through November, or by order of the district forester, when self-contained stoves are allowed.|$|E

5|$|Montgomery County, Maryland, {{similarly}} approved {{plans to}} install 20 stations and 200 bikes in the Rockville and Shady Grove areas near Washington Metro stations and high-traffic destinations such as Montgomery College and Rockville Town Center. The expansion {{will be paid}} for by a $1.288 million grant from the National Capital Region Transportation Planning Board with a $688,000 local match. Officials also cited plans to add 50 stations and 400 bicycles in southern areas of the county, including Bethesda, Silver Spring, Friendship Heights, and Takoma Park. However, bicycling advocates cautioned that clusters of stations in the county could be too far from each other as well as the larger network of stations within neighboring Washington, D.C. There was also concern that the county has too few bike lanes <b>and</b> <b>trails</b> to support the expected number of users. Despite these concerns, Montgomery County added its first stations in May 2013.|$|E
5|$|Nearby {{points of}} {{interest}} include a visitor center <b>and</b> <b>trails</b> for the Gateway National Recreation Area's Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge. The Refuge {{is one of the}} most significant bird sanctuaries in the Northeastern United States, and it is home to more than 330 bird species, making it one of the best places in New York City to observe migrating birds. The visitor center is the start of many guided tours of the refuge and it is home to exhibits that discuss the history of Jamaica Bay, the wide array of wildlife that can be found there, and the impact of human activity.|$|E
5|$|The Wilsonville Community Center holds {{classes and}} {{community}} {{programs as well}} as community meeting space. Wilsonville holds an annual arts fair each May called the Wilsonville Festival of Arts. Another annual event, Wilsonville Celebration Days, started in 2000 and replaced Boones Ferry Days. A farmers' market started in 2009 at the Villebois development, held on Thursdays from May into October. Charbonneau Golf Club is the only golf course in the city, with Langdon Farms and Sandelie just to the south and east respectively. Wilsonville also is along the Willamette Greenway series of open spaces <b>and</b> <b>trails.</b> Wilsonville is the setting for the 2008 film Wendy and Lucy.|$|E
50|$|Most early {{electric}} locomotives shared commonalities with the steam engines of their time. These features included side rods and frame mounted driving axles with leading <b>and</b> <b>trailing</b> axles. The long rigid wheelbase and the leading <b>and</b> <b>trailing</b> axles reduced cornering stability and increased weight.|$|R
40|$|Behavior {{of leading}} <b>and</b> <b>trailing</b> arcs in twin-wire {{submerged}} arc welding has been investigated with help of transient heat transfer analysis. An appropriate heat transfer model with dissimilar heat sources at leading <b>and</b> <b>trailing</b> arcs has been considered. The model has been simulated with different combinations of model parameters. Computed and experimentally measured temperatures have been compared and geometrical and heat distribution differences between leading <b>and</b> <b>trailing</b> heat sources have been suggested. The behavior of leading <b>and</b> <b>trailing</b> arcs along with comparison between the current and the conventional approach has been presented and discussed. The simulation indicates that the leading arc has a major share in producing penetration where as the trailing arc is more responsible for melting. Copyright Â© Taylor & Francis Group, LLC...|$|R

5|$|Wilkins Peak is not gated, {{and it can}} {{be reached}} via an unpaved road known as Wilkins Peak Road that starts on U.S. Route 191 {{southwest}} of Rock Springs, Wyoming. The mountain can also be accessed via another unpaved road that begins in the Scott's Bottom Nature Area in Green River, Wyoming. The peak is accessible year-round, weather permitting. The Green River access road is in worse shape than the Rock Springs side, and it has several road hazards such as steep grades, poor grading, and off-road vehicle traffic. Along with serving radio needs, the peak also is a popular hiking and mountain biking location in the area. There are many smaller roads <b>and</b> <b>trails</b> that spring from the peak that offer varied degrees of challenge.|$|E
5|$|Early European (primarily from England, Ireland and France) {{settlement}} in Newfoundland {{was confined to}} the coast. The rich cod fishery on the Grand Banks and along {{the shore of the}} island was the primary reason for these settlements. The rugged shoreline provided many small, but isolated, harbors (outports) from which to conduct the fishery. The Avalon Peninsula was, and is, the most populous part of the island, and as such had the best developed system of early roads <b>and</b> <b>trails.</b> Transportation between communities on other parts of the coast, especially the south coast between Fortune Bay and Port aux Basques, was exclusively by boat. Almost all communities are now accessible by roads which are part of the provincial road system. The now-defunct Newfoundland Railway, built {{in the latter part of}} the 19th century, and the development of the lead, zinc and copper mine at Buchans and the paper mill in Grand Falls in the early 20th century marked the beginning of the settlement of the interior of the island. Despite these developments the majority of the population is still found along the coast.|$|E
