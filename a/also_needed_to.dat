5|$|Bond {{has driven}} {{a number of}} cars, {{including}} the Aston Martin V8 Vantage during the 1980s, the V12 Vanquish and DBS during the 2000s, {{as well as the}} Lotus Esprit; the BMW Z3, BMW 750iL and the BMW Z8. He has, however, <b>also</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> drive a number of other vehicles, ranging from a Citroën 2CV to a AEC Routemaster bus, amongst others.|$|E
5|$|Allen {{recalled}} The Original Series, {{and said}} that she was pleased to be remembered as an Orion slave girl. However, she was not pleased with the make-up process which took between four and five hours to apply, and required each actress to be sprayed with green make-up over their whole body. Removal of the makeup was via the showers in the Paramount lot's executive gym. The make-up team <b>also</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> apply fake sweat and bruises to other members of the cast to represent the results of the increased aggression shown by them in the episode's plot.|$|E
5|$|For the film, Deodato cast several inexperienced actors {{from the}} Actors Studio in New York City. Luca Giorgio Barbareschi and Francesca Ciardi were cast {{in part because}} they were Italian actors who also spoke English. Deodato decided to make the film in English to appeal to a wider {{audience}} and to lend the film credibility. However, he <b>also</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> establish a European nationality so that the film could be more easily distributed among European countries. Under Italian law, for the film to be recognized as Italian, Deodato had to have at least two native Italian-speaking actors to star in the film.|$|E

5|$|French {{military}} planners had to balance competing demands for the 1781 campaign. After the unsuccessful American attempts of co-operation leading to failed assaults at Rhode Island and Savannah, they realised more {{active participation in}} North America was needed. However, they <b>also</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> co-ordinate their actions with Spain, where there was potential interest in making {{an assault on the}} British stronghold of Jamaica. It turned out that the Spanish were not interested in operations agaynst Jamaica until after they had dealt with an expected British attempt to reinforce besieged Gibraltar, and merely wanted to be informed of the movements of the West Indies fleet.|$|E
5|$|In October 1927, Memoirs of a White Crow Indian was {{accepted}} for publication by Century, and Marquis was prompted to take down his medical practice sign. However, this was premature, {{as it would be}} some time before royalties were forthcoming. Lack of funds drove Marquis to continue seeing patients and carrying out insurance medical examinations. He <b>also</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> borrow money from relatives and cash in his war risk insurance policy. Memoirs of a White Crow Indian was published in April 1928 and received good reviews.|$|E
5|$|The GDR emblem {{was removed}} from over the main {{entrance}} in 1990, the year of reunification, leaving a dark patch. Following reunification, the Berlin offices of the German Chancellery and the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs moved into the building. In January 1993, after a legal decision, the Federal Government returned the building to the Federal State of Berlin, which wished {{to use it for}} its original purpose of city administration. However, it first urgently required refurbishment; under the GDR, upkeep had been neglected and the plumbing facilities, for example, dated in part to the 1920s. Access <b>also</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> be provided for the handicapped.|$|E

5|$|The primary {{treatment}} of DKA is with intravenous fluids and insulin. Depending on the severity, insulin {{may be given}} intravenously or by injection under the skin. Usually potassium is <b>also</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> prevent the development of low blood potassium. Throughout treatment blood sugar and potassium levels should be regularly checked. Antibiotics may be required in those with an underlying infection. In those with severely low blood pH, sodium bicarbonate may be given; however, its use is of unclear benefit and typically not recommended.|$|E
5|$|With {{this growth}} in commerce, Tudor's initial {{monopoly}} on the trade broke down, but he continued to make significant profits from the growing trade. Increased supplies of ice were <b>also</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> keep up with demand. From 1842 onwards, Tudor and others invested at Walden Pond in New England for additional supplies. New companies began to spring up, such as the Philadelphia Ice Company, which made use of the new railroad lines to transport harvested ice, while the Kershow family introduced improved ice harvesting to the New York region.|$|E
5|$|Bringing {{dead and}} seriously wounded {{down from the}} top was {{difficult}} for both sides. UN litter-bearing teams of six men had to carry each wounded man on a stretcher down the mountain. A medical aide was <b>also</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> administer care during the trip if the man was critically wounded, and riflemen often accompanied the groups to protect them from North Korean snipers along the trail. Critically wounded men often died before reaching the bottom where full medical care could be administered. This possibility was one of the factors that lowered morale in the 24th Infantry units fighting on Battle Mountain. Many men were afraid that if they were wounded there they would die before reaching adequate medical care. North Korean troops often did not have time to move dead and wounded from the peak at all, forcing both sides to bury casualties in shallow graves along the peak.|$|E

5|$|In the United States, common {{starlings}} {{are exempt}} from the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, which prohibits the taking or killing of migratory birds. No permit is required to remove nests and eggs or kill juveniles or adults. Research was undertaken in 1966 to identify a suitable avicide that would both kill common starlings and would readily be eaten by them. It <b>also</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> be of low toxicity to mammals and not likely to cause the death of pets that ate dead birds. The chemical that best fitted these criteria was DRC-1339, now marketed as Starlicide. In 2008, the United States government poisoned, shot or trapped 1.7million birds, {{the largest number of}} any nuisance species to be destroyed. In 2005, the population in the United States was estimated at 140million birds, around 45% of the global total of 310million.|$|E
5|$|Kono {{described}} Clock Tower as {{an experimental}} project {{with a small}} budget and staff. His peers believed that a game where the protagonist runs away from the enemy would not work, but he continued on despite these concerns. Due to lack of staffing resources, developer Human Entertainment could not include mouse support and <b>also</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> shrink the map down significantly. Although the graphics are two-dimensional, the mansion is designed within a 3D space. The character graphics in Clock Tower were created by digitizing photographs of real people, a popular technique of the time. The actress for Jennifer was a woman in Human's planning division. Many of the motions in the game came from her acting, such as hanging from a roof and stumbling in the hallway.|$|E
5|$|The field {{selected}} for the observations needed to fulfill several criteria. It {{had to be at}} a high galactic latitude, because dust and obscuring matter in the plane of the Milky Way's disc prevents observations of distant galaxies at low galactic latitudes. The target field had to avoid known bright sources of visible light (such as foreground stars), and infrared, ultraviolet and X-ray emissions, to facilitate later studies at many wavelengths of the objects in the deep field, and <b>also</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> be in a region with a low background infrared 'cirrus', the diffuse, wispy infrared emission believed to be caused by warm dust grains in cool clouds of hydrogen gas (H I regions).|$|E

5|$|The state's {{financial}} position was poor. Supporters of the dictatorship attempted to block progress on reforming the economy. The {{redistribution of wealth}} supported by the new government seemed {{a threat to the}} richest, in light of the recent Wall Street Crash and the onset of the Great Depression. The government attempted to tackle the dire poverty in rural areas by instituting an eight-hour day and giving the security of tenure to farm workers. Landlords complained. The effectiveness of the reforms was dependent on the skill of the local governance, which was often badly lacking. Changes to the military were needed and education reform was another problem facing the Republic. The relationship between central government and the Basque and Catalan regions <b>also</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> be decided.|$|E
5|$|While under Iso's tutelage, Kanō {{witnessed}} a demonstration by the Yōshin-ryū jūjutsu teacher Totsuka Hikosuke and later {{took part in}} randori with members of Totsuka's school. Kanō {{was impressed by the}} Yōshin-ryū practitioners and realized that he might never be able to beat someone as talented as Totsuka simply by training harder: he <b>also</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> train smarter. It was this experience that first led Kanō to believe that to be truly superior, one needed to combine the best elements of several ryū, or schools, of jūjutsu including Yagyu Shingan-ryū Taijutsu. Toward this end, he began to seek teachers who could provide him with superior elements of jūjutsu that he could adopt.|$|E
5|$|With costs {{much higher}} than anticipated, work ceased in June 1811. After much deliberation, {{it was decided to}} {{continue}} construction, and to obtain a third Act of Parliament to authorise increased charges for carriage of goods. By 1812, progress was being made, but was hampered by the need for rock cuttings at Holcombe Rogus. Leakage also meant that some sections needed to be lined with puddle clay. Lime kilns were constructed to provide the materials, which can still be seen beside the canal, close to the Waytown Tunnel. Fenacre Bridge and Fossend Bridge were constructed at Burlescombe, where culverts were <b>also</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> manage the streams. At a total cost of £244,505, the canal was opened on 25 August 1814, when the first boat travelled from Lowdwells to Tiverton, laden with coal.|$|E

5|$|The PlayStation 3 version {{supports}} display {{resolutions of}} 720p and 1080p – the former with {{and the latter}} without anti-aliasing – while the Vita version runs at 720x408 pixels. Graphical features such as the water effects and lighting were improved. Other changes include the addition of bloom, the move from circular to dynamic shadows and tweaks to environmental geometry and texturing. The developers revised the 3D models for both games: most models merely received new textures but those of the playable characters were rebuilt completely with noticeable changes to their faces. The cutscenes and prerendered environments needed to be adjusted from a 4:3 to a 16:9 screen ratio, the process of which required lots of art and programming readjustments. For example, the widescreen display led to character models being visible in a cutscene although they were to appear only in a later shot; these instances had to be corrected. Both the prerendered background images and cutscenes were cropped {{at the top and}} bottom to fit the new screen ratio. However, they received a bump in resolution to appear much clearer than in the PlayStation 2 version. The gameplay <b>also</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> be duplicated while bringing it up to the standard of a high definition game, which was harder than the team thought.|$|E
5|$|Pre-production was {{originally}} estimated at ten months, but ultimately extended to fourteen months. Each {{time a new}} movement or ability was created for the Prince, it required adjustments to multiple other systems, as leaving them alone would have damaged the game. They <b>also</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> make adjustments to the enemy and partner artificial intelligence, {{and they did not}} have time to polish those systems. All this meant that the debugging started much later than originally scheduled. The Prince had over 780 scripted movements, far more than any other character in the game. This caused problems with creating the movements for other characters. To make the character movements realistic, the team used motion capture to animate their movements. Art director Raphael Lacoste did not join the team until July 2002, well into the game's production, resulting in multiple delays in creating the game's environments. This issue was compounded by the need to produce a demo for the 2003 Electronic Entertainment Expo, then to deliver an entire game at the same if not a higher quality than the demo. Each environment needed to work for the Prince's set of movements and abilities: the work needed involved checking each rewind sequence, and each of the Prince's movement in and effect on the environment worked. These issues were compounded by the late delivery of environmental maps. In hindsight, producer Yannis Mallat lamented the fact {{that they did not have}} enough time to work out the problems caused by these issues. Despite these problems, other parts of production including play-testing, management of creative tools, and the integrated testing system worked smoothly. A cited example was the team discovering a tester that was good at finding severe bugs, so they included her in one of their testing groups, giving her a development kit she could use to sort out those bugs. This was replicated, and managed to greatly increase the amount of bugs that could be found and fixed. The development team's enthusiasm was also high, which enabled the problems during development to be overcome. During the aftermath of E3, the team considered release The Sands of Time as two games so they could include all the desired content, but the idea was dropped. Another element that needed to be cut after the demo was a griffin boss that would appear three times during the Prince's journey.|$|E
25|$|The major {{goals of}} spring {{practice}} were {{to improve the}} defense, find a solid backup for running back Steve Slaton, and work out the inexperienced class of receivers.
