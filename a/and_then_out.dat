Short appealed to Masterson, who contacted Earp. On May 31, 1883, Earp and Josephine went with Bat Masterson, Johnny Millsap, Shotgun John Collins, Texas Jack Vermillion, and Johnny Green to Dodge City to help Short.|$|E
5|$|Most comets {{are small}} Solar System bodies with {{elongated}} elliptical orbits that take them {{close to the}} Sun for {{a part of their}} orbit <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>out</b> into the further reaches of the Solar System for the remainder. Comets are often classified according to the length of their orbital periods: The longer the period the more elongated the ellipse.|$|E

The show cave was further extended in 2015 by excavating a tunnel from the ninth chamber to the 20th chamber.|$|E

5|$|Fish have a {{closed-loop}} circulatory system. The heart pumps {{the blood}} in a single loop throughout the body. In most fish, the heart consists of four parts, including two chambers and an entrance and exit. The first part is the sinus venosus, a thin-walled sac that collects blood from the fish's veins before allowing it to flow to the second part, the atrium, which is a large muscular chamber. The atrium serves as a one-way antechamber, sends blood to the third part, ventricle. The ventricle is another thick-walled, muscular chamber and it pumps the blood, first to the fourth part, bulbus arteriosus, a large tube, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>out</b> of the heart. The bulbus arteriosus connects to the aorta, through which blood flows to the gills for oxygenation.|$|E
5|$|In a 2009 {{interview}} with the Discovery Channel, Mike Brown noted that, {{while it is not}} impossible that the Sun has a distant planetary companion, such an object would have to be lying very far from the observed regions of the Solar System to have no detectable gravitational effect on the other planets. A Mars-sized object could lie undetected at 300AU (10 times the distance of Neptune); a Jupiter-sized object at 30,000AU. To travel 1000AU in two years, an object would need to be moving at 2400km/s– faster than the galactic escape velocity. At that speed, any object would be shot out of the Solar System, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>out</b> of the Milky Way galaxy into intergalactic space.|$|E

25|$|In close/narrow-angle, the iridocorneal {{angle is}} {{completely}} closed because of forward {{displacement of the}} final roll and root of the iris against the cornea, resulting in {{the inability of the}} aqueous fluid to flow from the posterior to the anterior chamber <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>out</b> of the trabecular network. This accumulation of aqueous humor causes an acute increase in pressure and pain.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} days of the {{incoming}} Conservative government in 1970, despite failing to be elected to the shadow cabinet, Castle remained as the Labour shadow spokesperson on Employment. The new Government introduced many of her policy suggestions as part of their Industrial Relations Act. When she was attacking the Conservative bill, the government simply pointed to her own white paper, following which Wilson reshuffled her first to the health portfolio <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>out</b> of the shadow cabinet.|$|E
25|$|Beam {{trawlers}} are {{a type of}} {{outrigger trawler}} (above), with the superstructure aft and the working deck amidships. They use a very strong outrigger boom on each side, each towing a beam trawl, with the warps going through blocks {{at the end of}} the boom. This arrangement makes it easier to stow and handle the large beams. The outriggers are controlled from a midship A-frame or mast. The towing winch is forward of the superstructure, with the towing warps passed through deck bollards <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>out</b> to the towing blocks on the booms.|$|E

25|$|Like other {{right whale}} species, the North Pacific right whale feeds by {{skimming}} water continuously while swimming, {{in contrast to}} balaenopterid whales such as the blue and humpback whales which engulf prey in rapid lunges. Right whales do not have pleated throats. Instead they have very large heads and mouths {{that allows them to}} swim with their mouths open, the water with the copepods flowing in, then flowing sideways through the right whale's very long, very fine baleen trapping the copepods, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>out</b> over their large lower lips.|$|E
25|$|Several {{hundred million}} years ago, plants (probably {{resembling}} algae) and fungi started growing {{at the edges of}} the water, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>out</b> of it. The oldest fossils of land fungi and plants date to 480–460Ma, though molecular evidence suggests the fungi may have colonized the land as early as 1000Ma and the plants 700Ma. Initially remaining close to the water's edge, mutations and variations resulted in further colonization of this new environment. The timing of the first animals to leave the oceans is not precisely known: the oldest clear evidence is of arthropods on land around 450Ma, perhaps thriving and becoming better adapted due to the vast food source provided by the terrestrial plants. There is also unconfirmed evidence that arthropods may have appeared on land as early as 530 Ma.|$|E
25|$|During {{the years}} since B bankruptcy, highway {{congestion}} has increased significantly, resulting in growing demand for passenger and freight options. During this time frame, the MBTA has been slowly investing in some infrastructure changes in its rail operations. In 1995 a new North Station was opened. In 2001 it opened the Anderson Regional Transportation Center on the Boston & Lowell to centralize ridership and provide a superstation with convenient access to Interstates 93 and 95 (Route 128). In southern Maine, frustration with bus service drove the state to explore restarting passenger service, resulting in contracting with Amtrak to operate the Downeaster, which runs from North Station to Haverhill and up to Portland. Due to scheduling conflicts with the MBTA, the Downeaster runs up the Lowell Line to Wilmington <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>out</b> the old B Wildcat Branch to the Haverhill/Reading Line. This route allows the Downeaster to pass a commuter train on the Haverhill/Reading Line without schedule conflicts. The route is also historically significant {{because it is the}} same route that the original B used to Portland.|$|E

25|$|The natural {{boundaries}} of the fell are Bassenthwaite Lake to the east, Wythop Valley {{to the south and}} west, and the Vale of Embleton to the north. Sale Fell is a satellite of Lord's Seat, the highest of the hills north of Whinlatter. The connecting high ground runs south eastward above the shore of Bassenthwaite before turning inland to the summit of the parent fell. The connection is extremely tenuous, passing along a very narrow strip of land between Wythop Beck and Beck Wythop. These two streams run side by side down the slopes of Lord's Seat before diverging to surround Sale Fell on all sides. Wythop Beck is the main stream of the Wythop Valley, running west around Sale Fell <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>out</b> down the narrow wooded defile which stands between it and Ling Fell. Joining the Dubwath Beck it then flows eastward along the Vale of Embleton and into the northern end of Bassenthwaite. Beck Wythop by contrast cuts through the ridge of high ground running alongside Bassenthwaite, and drops directly into the lake.|$|E

[...] Although Wyatt Tee Walker was initially against the use of children in the demonstrations, he responded to criticism by saying, [...] "Negro children will get a better education in five days in jail than in five months in a segregated school." [...] The D Day campaign received front page coverage by The Washington Post and The New York Times.|$|E
500|$|In 1984, Maryland {{defeated}} the defending national champions, sixth-ranked Miami, {{in what was}} then the biggest comeback in college football history and judged by some as the most exciting. At half time, Maryland trailed Miami, 31–0. Back-up quarterback Frank Reich replaced Stan Gelbaugh and proceeded to throw four touchdown passes, and capitalizing on Miami errors, the Terrapins won, 42–40. The recovery from the 31-point halftime deficit stood as the greatest college football comeback for the next 22years, until the record was finally broken by Michigan State against Northwestern. Reich later repeated the feat in his professional career when he led the Buffalo Bills to overcome a 32-point deficit and set the NFL comeback record. That season, Maryland also defeated 17th-ranked West Virginia and 20th-ranked Clemson, and secured the ACC championship. In the postseason, they edged Tennessee, 28–27, in the [...] and finished 12th in the nation. Maryland entered the 1985 season with a number-one preseason rank, and set its all-time home attendance record in Byrd Stadium with an average of 49,385 over five games. However, they dropped to a ranking of 17th in Week 2, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>out</b> of the polls in Week 4 after a shutout by Michigan. Despite the early setbacks, the Terrapins finished undefeated in six conference games to take the ACC championship for the third consecutive year. Maryland defeated , 35–18, in the Cherry Bowl and earned a final ranking of 18th. In 1986, the Terrapins posted a mediocre 5–5–1 record.|$|E

500|$|Wonderland {{was well}} {{received}} by critics; Paul Callan, reviewing the album for the Daily Express, {{described it as}} [...] "a joy". He compared it to other Christmas albums, saying that [...] "oo many are tired, much-repeated carol selections." [...] He described Smith's [...] "control, tone and warmth" [...] as [...] "very moving". Andy Gill, reviewing Wonderland for The Independent, gave a less positive review. He said that the influence of Alice in Wonderland was often hard to perceive and that Cohen and Smith had [...] "sweetened the classical elements". However, he praised the arrangements of [...] "Adiemus", [...] "Barcarolle", [...] "Merry Christmas, Mr Lawrence" [...] and [...] "Blow The Wind Southerly", but noted that on tracks including [...] "Close To You", [...] "the lack of emotional weight is telling." [...] Overall, Gill gave Wonderland 3 out of 5. However, the album failed to perform as well as Faryl; it entered the British album charts at number 56 for the week ending 12 December before dropping to number 92 the following week <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>out</b> of the top 100. After Wonderland, Smith's contract with Universal ended, and she subsequently received less attention from the press. Smith described the break with the label as mainly her decision, as she needed to focus on her A levels, which would allow her to get to university, explaining {{in an interview that}} [...] "It wasn't like it ended horribly." ...|$|E
