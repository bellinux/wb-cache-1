40|$|AbstractThis {{study focused}} on the {{mechanism}} of <b>attracting</b> <b>funds</b> to finance projects {{in the field of}} highway infrastructure construction through Public–Private Partnership (PPP). The basis and principles for development of the financial strategy of a project company were defined in this paper. The proposed financial strategy was developed on the basis of diversification of sources of funds and financing instruments with regard to the stages of the project life cycle. The parameters for development of the financial strategy were defined to improve the mechanisms of attraction of the capital for the project and increase the capacity of the project company to pay debts. The proposed financial strategy can be taken as a basis for development of the financial strategy for any project implemented through PPP. The capital market is not stable; therefore, in addition, an algorithm was proposed for more precise selection of sources of financial resources...|$|E

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the motivational factors for participation in collaborative consumption across industries and if specific factors <b>attracts</b> <b>funding.</b> This will be done as an attempt to extend current research within sharing economy regarding what factors to consider when <b>attracting</b> <b>funding.</b> Method and Methodology - Utilizing a deductive approach, the research questions connect motivational factors for participation with funding of industries within the sharing economy. Secondary data containing 776 funding rounds were analysed through univariate and bivariate analyses and linked to 40 935 observations of motivational factors for participation. Findings - The findings entail how some motivational factors for participation in the sharing economy can be applicable to all investigated industries, while others are industry specific. The study thus suggest that the sharing economy cannot be viewed as one coherent industry and motivational factors should not be cross-sector generalized. Contribution - The study contributes with a theoretical implication in the way it bridges the existing gap by dividing the sharing economy into different industries and connect the specific motivational factors underlying the possibility to <b>attract</b> <b>funding.</b> Furthermore, a practical implication suggests that companies can use these findings as a guideline to attract consumers and ultimately funding...|$|R
40|$|National park {{management}} increasingly considers {{voluntary contributions}} from visitors as potentially important sources of private funding for species conservation. We investigate visitors {{willingness to pay}} (WTP) {{for the protection of}} two species differing in degree of endangerment and popularity (alpine ibex and rock partridge) in Austrias Hohe Tauern National Park. Our analysis reveals that visitors attitudes towards and preferences for nature conservation in general determine the WTP and not so much the species characteristics. The results suggest that conservation funding should be essentially public and only complemented by private funding because (i) potential (voluntary) contributions by visitors might not be sustainable in the long run, (ii) visitors WTP mirrors preferences for nature conservation in general rather than for specific species conservation programs, (iii) the collection of private contributions by a new system might be complicated, and (iv) many protected areas lack the resources and capacities for marketing and branding which are essential prerequisites for <b>attracting</b> <b>funds</b> in the first place...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{describes}} {{the steps of}} estimating the recreation value of a national park by combining two non-market valuation methods: the Travel Cost Method and the Contingent Valuation Method. The questionnaire was designed according to both methods by formulating specific questions. The survey was implemented in Piatra Craiului National Park {{during the summer of}} 2011, one of the most visited national parks from Romania. The recreation value in terms of consumer surplus per trip is derived from the Poisson model and in terms of willingness to pay per trip from the random effects probit model. It was found that tourists gain significant benefits from recreating in the park. The estimated recreation values are expressed in monetary units and provide justification for <b>attracting</b> <b>funds</b> for developing tourism opportunities in a sustainable way. Moreover, the findings show that tourists are aware {{of the value of the}} park and do appreciate the opportunities offered by the park administrations. However, the process of revealing the benefits people gain after visiting the park should receive more attention from the decision makers when developing the management plans...|$|E

The approach consists in three basic steps: A pre-coop involvement in a particular project, development of the research project followed by a mentor from industry during the working stage, and a post-coop period in which the final reports, and communications are generated. This approach has been very beneficial for all, <b>attracting</b> <b>funds</b> to the department and support for short courses and laboratories from industry, better learning for students, and so on. The success of this project has provided with insights of what could be used to start up similar approaches in other places. An analysis of the factors that have helped vis a vis the actual availability is taken into considerations when suggesting steps to set up a program like this one.
