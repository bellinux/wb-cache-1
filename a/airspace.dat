5|$|<b>Airspace</b> {{is shared}} by CAT, {{military}} and GA users. It is divided into controlled <b>airspace,</b> in which aircraft must always be {{under the control of}} an air traffic controller, and uncontrolled <b>airspace,</b> in which aircraft can operate autonomously. Although GA flights can under certain conditions enter controlled <b>airspace,</b> they operate mainly outside of it.|$|E
5|$|Airspace: in many European countries, {{the growth}} of civil {{aviation}} is {{reducing the amount of}} uncontrolled <b>airspace.</b> In the U.S. new security requirements, and {{the growth of}} controlled <b>airspace</b> around cities, has also had some impact on where to fly.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the onsite control tower, the airport is home to Melbourne Centre, an air traffic control facility {{that is responsible for}} the separation of aircraft in Australia's busiest flight information region, Melbourne FIR. Melbourne FIR monitors <b>airspace</b> over Victoria, Tasmania, southern New South Wales, most of South Australia, the southern half of Western Australia and <b>airspace</b> over the Indian and Southern Ocean. In total, the centre controls 6% of the world's <b>airspace.</b> The airport is also the home of the Canberra approach and Melbourne approach facilities, which provide control services to aircraft arriving and departing at those airports.|$|E
30|$|In healthy conditions, derecruitment {{occurred}} continuously {{along the}} decremental PEEP levels. When <b>airspaces</b> were fully inflated, they exhibited {{a more stable}} behavior, losing less volume. Reducing PEEP from 9 to 0 cmH 2 O, derecruitment was proportionally greater in the more inflated <b>airspaces,</b> which were predominantly located in the core regions. In ARDS, loss of gas volume between PEEP 12 and 6 cmH 2 O was characterized by an “on-off mechanism” of derecruitment, remaining stable {{the dimensions of the}} still open <b>airspaces.</b> This {{may be related to the}} higher critical closing pressures and lower compliance of ARDS lungs.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to this, some class B <b>airspaces</b> prohibit special VFR flights.|$|R
40|$|The uniform {{application}} across Europe of coordination and transfer procedures will provide increased efficiency and safety for operations at local and network level. Harmonisation of silent transfer of control spacing values, consistent application of procedures at interfaces between FABs, free route <b>airspaces</b> and fixed route <b>airspaces</b> is supported through a common approach towards ICAO provisions and European regulations governing coordination and transfer processes...|$|R
5|$|Increases in {{the number}} of CAT operations, and {{in the number}} of {{airports}} they operate from, has resulted in a corresponding increase in Class A controlled <b>airspace.</b> Between 1997 and 2006 this area grew in size from 13 per cent of all <b>airspace</b> to 22 per cent nationally, and from 24 per cent to 43 per cent in <b>airspace</b> above England and Wales, leading to a perception within the GA community of being squeezed out. There are particular problems for GA around large airports, where Class A controlled <b>airspace</b> extends to ground level. The concentration of commercial operations and high demand for GA in the South East of England have also resulted in extensive areas of Class A controlled <b>airspace</b> there, which serve to channel uncontrolled GA operations through high-collision-risk hot spots.|$|E
5|$|International {{airports}} {{have extensive}} operations in managing flight logistics, such as air traffic control. The latter service {{is provided by}} ground-based controllers who coordinate and direct aircraft {{on the ground and}} through controlled <b>airspace.</b> Air traffic control also provides advisory services to aircraft in non-controlled <b>airspace.</b>|$|E
5|$|Airports can be towered or non-towered, {{depending}} on air traffic density and available funds. Because of high capacity and busy <b>airspace,</b> many international airports have {{air traffic control}} located on site.|$|E

50|$|The {{civilian}} {{market has}} also seen a growth in cost of avionics. Flight control systems (fly-by-wire) and new navigation needs {{brought on by}} tighter <b>airspaces,</b> have pushed up development costs. The major change has been the recent boom in consumer flying. As more people begin to use planes as their primary method of transportation, more elaborate methods of controlling aircraft safely in these high restrictive <b>airspaces</b> have been invented.|$|R
50|$|By 2020, all {{aircraft}} {{operating in}} the US <b>airspaces</b> listed below {{will be required to}} carry equipment that produces an ADS-B Out broadcast.|$|R
5|$|Land {{is defined}} as the surface, subsoil, <b>airspace</b> and {{anything}} permanently attached to the land, such as houses. The rights of landowners over <b>airspace</b> are not unlimited; in Bernstein of Leigh v Skyviews & General Ltd, the action for trespass failed because the violation of <b>airspace</b> took place several hundred metres above the land. This was backed up by the Civil Aviation Act 1982, which provides that it is not trespass if the aircraft is flying at a reasonable height. An overhanging crane can constitute trespass, as in Woolerton v Costain, as can an advertising sign, as in Kelsen v Imperial Tobacco Co. Possession does not necessarily mean the ownership of land, but the right to eject or exclude others from it.|$|E
5|$|The Air Ministry was unsympathetic to Coastal Command and {{the lack}} of any {{suitable}} place for aerodromes made improvements difficult to implement. OTU airfields required a number of features not available in all locations. The main requirement was a quiet area so that OTU flights would not interfere with stations that were already operational. To prevent losses to enemy air attacks, it was also necessary to keep OTUs as far away from enemy <b>airspace</b> as possible, while the sensitive <b>airspace</b> over convoy routes and near Scapa Flow were also inappropriate places to launch OTUs.|$|E
5|$|The {{move was}} seen as an effort by the US {{military}} to prevent an international incident by not acknowledging that US pilots had violated Chinese <b>airspace.</b> Debate remains {{as to whether or not}} these <b>airspace</b> violations were a necessity, as US pilots were able to maintain air superiority despite being outnumbered in the war, and Chinese and Soviet pilots, who could have launched similar strikes on UN ships at sea and on targets in Japan did not do so. Still, many missions into Chinese <b>airspace</b> were authorized during the war. Informally, it was known that US pilots regularly violated the rule in a rush to down MiGs.|$|E

5|$|Although it {{is unknown}} when it was opened, Loring was host to a Conventional Enhanced Release Training bomb range, which was located {{adjacent}} to the runway. Loring {{was one of four}} Strategic Air Command bases with a range of this type, and it was used frequently. The base was also located next to Condor 1 and Condor 2 <b>airspace,</b> which allowed for low-level training. The routes and training opportunities within the restricted <b>airspace</b> allowed training to be accomplished. One disadvantage of the location of Loring was its distance from the Strategic Training Route Complex and bombing ranges in Nevada and Utah. The ranges out west were the only location where the B-52s were allowed to drop live munitions, although SAC training only required crews to drop live munitions twice a year on these ranges.|$|E
5|$|As a large country {{spanning}} {{over three}} timezones, Indonesia possesses a vast <b>airspace.</b> However, Indonesia {{is not a}} participant of the International Air Services Transit Agreement (IASTA), therefore both Indonesian <b>airspace</b> and airports are closed for foreign commercial airlines' freedoms of the air, unless there were bilateral transit agreements negotiated with other countries. Indonesia and Australia for example, signed a bilateral agreement relating to air service on 7 February 2013. According to this agreement, each nations grants to the other party the right to fly across its territory without landing, {{and the right to}} make stops in its territory for non-traffic purposes (1st and 2nd freedom), and the rights for designated airlines to operate services.|$|E
5|$|Based in Geilenkirchen, Germany, 18 E-3 AWACS were {{purchased}} – one lost in Greece, one retired from service. All of these aircraft are officially registered as aircraft of Luxembourg, a NATO member {{with no other}} air force.

5|$|During the Syrian Civil War, Turkish F-16s were {{tasked with}} <b>airspace</b> {{protection}} on the Syrian border. After the RF-4 downing in June 2012 Turkey changed its rules of engagements against Syrian aircraft, resulting in scrambles and downings of Syrian combat aircraft. On 16 September 2013, a Turkish Air Force F-16 shot down a Syrian Arab Air Force Mil Mi-17 helicopter in Latakia province near Turkish boder. On 23 March 2014, a Turkish Air Force F-16 shot down a Syrian Arab Air Force Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-23 when it allegedly entered Turkish air space during a ground attack mission against Al Qaeda-linked insurgents. On 16 May 2015, Two Turkish Air Force F-16s shot down a Syrian Mohajer 4 UAV firing two AIM-9 missiles after it trespassed into Turkish <b>airspace</b> for 5 minutes.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} months of the war, airmen and {{anti-aircraft}} soldiers saw only sporadic combat; it was on 10May 1940, when Germany commenced the drive into the west, that the Swiss army as a whole was mobilized a second time. At the onset of the campaign, German military aircraft first violated Swiss <b>airspace.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1960, the Soviet Union {{shot down}} a United States U-2 spy plane. The Soviets {{captured}} its pilot, Gary Powers, and tried him for committing espionage against the Soviet Union. At first, the United States believed that Powers could be freed by crafting an argument regarding international principles. To this end, Miskovsky {{and two other}} lawyers (Alexander W. Parker and Frank Rogers) wrote a brief stating that Power's U-2 plane did not violate Soviet <b>airspace</b> any more than Sputnik violated American <b>airspace.</b> However, the Soviet Union refused to allow foreigners to defend Powers. Powers was ultimately defended by a lawyer who acted as {{a spokesman for the}} Soviet government.|$|E
50|$|An {{aviation}} intersection called ANETO exists {{very close}} to the mountain itself, exactly on the border of France and Spain. For pilots crossing the Pyrenees this intersection marks the boundary between the Bordeaux and Barcelona <b>airspaces.</b>|$|R
30|$|In HC, N and A {{decreased}} with decreasing PEEP, {{which was}} more evident in CO. A/N remained stable down to PEEP 9 cmH 2 O and then decreased with PEEP. In ARDS, N and A decreased down to PEEP 6 cmH 2 O and then remained stable at subsequent lower PEEP levels. SP, PE and CO areas exhibited similar behaviors but with different magnitudes. In ARDS, between PEEP 12 and PEEP 6 cmH 2 O, A/N index behavior evidenced that <b>airspaces</b> dimensions in CO were stable, but decreased below PEEP 6 cmH 2 O. At each PEEP level, mean dimensions of <b>airspaces</b> were greater in CO than in SP regions.|$|R

5|$|In 1977, British Airways and Singapore Airlines {{shared a}} Concorde for flights between London and Singapore International Airport at Paya Lebar via Bahrain. The aircraft, BA's Concorde G-BOAD, was painted in Singapore Airlines livery {{on the port}} side and British Airways livery on the {{starboard}} side. The service was discontinued after three return flights because of noise complaints from the Malaysian government; it could only be reinstated on a new route bypassing Malaysian <b>airspace</b> in 1979. A dispute with India prevented Concorde from reaching supersonic speeds in Indian <b>airspace,</b> so the route was eventually declared not viable and discontinued in 1980.|$|E
5|$|In 1995the Swiss {{abandoned}} traditional {{doctrine and}} implemented a defensive plan that made control of Swiss <b>airspace</b> its highest and main priority. Modernization of the Swiss Air Force {{to achieve this}} mission was subject to popular referenda challenging its cost and practice.|$|E
5|$|In April 2010 <b>airspace</b> {{all over}} Europe was affected, with many flights cancelled-which was unprecedented-due to the {{presence}} of volcanic ash in the upper atmosphere from the eruption of the Icelandic volcano Eyjafjallajökull. On 15 April 2010 the Finnish Air Force halted training flights when damage was found from volcanic dust ingestion by the engines of one of its Boeing F-18 Hornet fighters. On 22 April 2010 UK RAF Typhoon training flights were also temporarily suspended after deposits of volcanic ash were found in a jet's engines. In June 2011 there were similar closures of <b>airspace</b> in Chile, Argentina, Brazil, Australia and New Zealand, following the eruption of Puyehue-Cordón Caulle, Chile.|$|E
50|$|With the {{accession}} {{of three}} new members, Hungary, Poland, and the Czech Republic to NATO in March 1999, Poland's and the Czech Republic's <b>airspaces</b> and air forces {{became part of}} the AIRCENT and have since contributed to AIRCENT’s task and mission.|$|R

40|$|AbstractTransgenic mice expressing platelet-derived {{growth factor}} A chain (PDGF-A) in the distal lung {{epithelium}} from the surfactant protein C (SPC) promoter were generated {{to investigate the}} role of this growth factor in lung development. Expression of the SPC-PDGFA transgene resulted in an enlarged, nonfunctional lung and perinatal lethality caused by failure to initiate ventilation. Histologic analysis of embryonic day (E) 16. 5 lungs revealed increased mesenchymal cells and acinar buds and decreased bronchioles and dilated <b>airspaces</b> in SPC-PDGFA transgenic mice. At E 18. 5, nontransgenic lungs exhibited lung morphology typical of the saccular stage of lung development, including dilated <b>airspaces,</b> thin respiratory epithelium and mesenchyme, and elastin fiber deposition in primary septa. In contrast, E 18. 5 transgenic lungs retained many features of the canalicular stage of lung development, including undilated <b>airspaces,</b> cuboidal respiratory epithelium, thickened mesenchyme, and lack of parenchymal elastin deposition. These results indicate that PDGF-A is a potent growth factor for mesenchymal cells in the developing lung and that the downregulation of PDGF-A expression that normally occurs in the lung during late gestation is required for transition from the canalicular to the saccular stage of lung development...|$|R
