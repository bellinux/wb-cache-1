50|$|<b>Adnominal</b> {{possession}} {{involves the}} introduction of an inflected possessive particle between the possessor and the possessed entity; this inflected possessive, formally categorised as a ‘ligature’, is cross-referenced with the number and person of the possessor. This ligature indicates a possessive relationship between a modifier noun and its head-noun. In Taba, <b>adnominal</b> possession is distinguished by reverse genitive ordering, in which the possessor noun precedes the noun referring to the possessed entity.|$|E

50|$|There are {{two types}} of <b>adnominal</b> modifiers, the prenominal and postnominal modifiers. These are words or clitics which are {{positioned}} before or after a noun or noun phrase and which modify its meaning or syntactic function in some manner.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>adnominal</b> form of consonant-base verbs {{ended in}} -o1, where Central Old Japanese has -u {{as in the}} {{conclusive}} form. A similar difference is preserved in Ryukyuan languages, suggesting that Central Old Japanese had innovated by merging these endings.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the first}} {{construction}} the possessive postmodifier {{agrees with the}} number of the possessor noun, establishing a semantic relationship that is distant or alienable, as the possessed noun exists independently of the possessor (<b>adnominal</b> possession).

5000|$|The three n-base verbs form a {{class of}} their own: sin- 'die', -in- 'depart' and the {{auxiliary}} -(i)n- expressing completion of an action. They are often described as a [...] "hybrid" [...] conjugation, because the <b>adnominal</b> and exclamatory forms follow a similar pattern to vowel-base verbs.|$|E
50|$|For example:Contrast {{this with}} the standard, unmarked form (3p):The {{distributive}} possessive pronoun (taan, ta, or ta-) refers to a (non-collective) plural number of human referents, often in reciprocal contexts.One more special possessive pronoun is liin, which marks plurality of the possessor NP, and only as an <b>adnominal</b> modifier.|$|E
5000|$|There are {{two ways}} of marking <b>adnominal</b> {{possession}} in Nafsan: {{through the use of}} a possessive pronoun (indirect possession), or directly on the noun (direct possession). Indirect possession is used for general possession, while direct possession is used for nouns that are closely associated items (e.g., body parts or products, kinship terms, etc.).|$|E
50|$|Engenni is {{a fairly}} {{isolating}} language, having little affixation. There is no plural form for words. It has definite articles, but no indefinite articles. There is a two-contrast with regards to demonstratives, while pronominal and <b>adnominal</b> demonstratives are identical (as in English). Verbs are marked for perfective/imperfective aspect, {{but there is no}} past tense.|$|E
5000|$|Verbal {{possession}} in Taba {{is generally}} indicated through the attaching of the causative prefix ha- to the <b>adnominal</b> possessive forms. The possessor then becomes actor of the clause, and the possessed entity becomes the undergoer.

50|$|Most {{discussions of}} adjuncts focus on {{adverbial}} adjuncts, that is, on adjuncts that modify verbs, verb phrases, or entire clauses like the adjuncts {{in the three}} examples just given. Adjuncts can appear in other domains, however; that is, they can modify most categories. An <b>adnominal</b> adjunct is one that modifies a noun: {{for a list of}} possible types of these, see Components of noun phrases. Adjuncts that modify adjectives and adverbs are occasionally called adadjectival and adadverbial.|$|E
5000|$|In word endings {{where the}} final {{consonant}} is ㄹ , where the South spells -ㄹ까 [...] and -ㄹ쏘냐 [...] {{to indicate the}} tensed consonants, in the North these are spelled -ㄹ가 ，-ㄹ소냐 [...] instead. These etymologically are formed by attaching to the <b>adnominal</b> form (관형사형 gwanhyeongjahyeong) that ends in ㄹ, and in the North, the tensed consonants are denoted with normal consonants. Also, the word ending -ㄹ게 [...] used to be spelt -ㄹ께 [...] in the South, but has since been changed in the Hangeul Matchumbeop of 1988, and is now spelt -ㄹ게 {{just like in the}} North.|$|E
50|$|Many health {{problems}} may occur from frequent drug use. Because drugs are chemicals and all have different chemical structures they {{will affect the}} body and the brain in many different ways. Drugs can cause heart attacks, seizures, <b>adnominal</b> pain, and even death. Many {{health problems}} may occur from extensive drug use. Drug users may also experience behavioral problems and experience paranoia, hallucinate, and even lose-self control. Drug use may also spread HIV with sharing of syringes. There was evidence that HIV infection in the UK was spread through transmission by the shared syringes of drug users. Hepatitis B can be also spread through sharing equipment, which carries the risk that the disease might be transmitted to the non-drug using population. Economic and social costs to society are also problems of drug use. These include costs to the health service, work related costs, state benefits, and the costs of community care.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{handles the}} German <b>adnominal</b> clauses that are {{introduced}} with “wie” and include personal pronouns. When the personal pronoun in the “wie” <b>adnominal</b> clause {{corresponds to the}} head noun, the clause functions like a relative clause. These “wie” <b>adnominal</b> clauses have both restrictive and non-restrictive uses. The restrictive “wie” <b>adnominal</b> clauses function like Japanese <b>adnominal</b> clauses with “yona”. The clause restricts the reference of the antecedent like the restrictive relative clause, on this occasion “wie” and “yona” broaden {{the range of the}} restriction to include a similar group. On the other hand, the non-restrictive “wie” <b>adnominal</b> clauses function adverbially, which is different from the relative clause. They state a simultaneous event with the event expressed by the main clause, or provide additional information concerning the antecedent...|$|E

Our computer-aided analysis shows that while de-wa-naiforms occur in <b>adnominal</b> clauses rather freely, de-wa-aru forms occur in <b>adnominal</b> clauses only when the following three conditions are entirely satisfied : (i) nouns modified by de-wa-aru forms are koto or no; (ii) predicates which take <b>adnominal</b> clauses containing de-wa-aru forms as their objects have such common meanings as [CERTAIN] and [KNOW]; (iii) such concessive expressions as shikashi, keredomo, ga co-occur.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} lexical-semantic {{properties of}} Heian Japanese verbs, adjectives and auxiliaries found in colloquial text, with special reference to their usages in <b>adnominal</b> clauses, quasi-nominal phrases (quasi-nominal construction with <b>adnominal</b> verbal ending) and final-attributives (sentences ending in <b>adnominal</b> form). The specific findings are as follows: (a) Verbs of motion/change are most frequent in <b>adnominal</b> clauses, while verbs of emotion/thought/perception are most frequent in final-attributives. The {{ratio of the}} two types found in quasi-nominal phrases is the same. (b) All adjective types (emotional, attributive and in-between types) are found in <b>adnominal</b> clauses and quasi-nominal phrases, while only emotional adjectives (often with negative connotation) appear in final-attributives. Comparison of the ratio of adjectives to verbs appearing in {{the three types of}} construction shows that the quasi-nominal phrase has intermediate characteristics between the other two constructions. (c) No particular correlations are found between the frequency and the lexical meanings of auxiliaries (conjectural or past) in <b>adnominal</b> clauses and quasi-nominal phrases, while emotion/thought auxiliaries, past/perfective auxiliaries, conjectural auxiliaries, negative auxiliaries, assertive auxiliaries are most frequent, in descending order, in final-attributives. But past auxiliary verb “ki”is more frequent than negative auxiliary verb“zu ”in both quasi-nominal phrases and final-attributives.

40|$|Two corpora {{of around}} 10, 000 words each in English and in French were {{manually}} labelled, {{and the frequency}} of each mode of determination was calculated for all common noun-based noun phrases (NPs), i. e. excluding proper nouns and pronouns. A comparison was then made between the frequency of each mode of determination in NPs without any sort of adjectival qualification, those associated with a single predicative adjective but without any sort of <b>adnominal</b> (attributive) qualification, and those containing either a single <b>adnominal</b> adjective, or other similar <b>adnominal</b> forms (e. g. participles or multiple modifiers). A distinction was made in French between NPs containing pre-nominal and post-nominal adjectives. A small number of NPs associated with more than one type of adjectival qualification simultaneously (e. g. adnominal+predicative) were excluded to facilitate the comparison between these two types of qualification. It was thus ascertained that the frequency of different modes of determination varies significantly according to the type of adjectival qualification. Although the definite articles are the dominant determiner in both languages in all circumstances, their frequency increases among NPs qualified by predicative adjectives, and decreases in French when an <b>adnominal</b> adjective is present, especially in pre-nominal position. Indefinite articles and null determiners are all but absent from NPs qualified predicatively. Indefinite articles display a strong affinity with <b>adnominal</b> qualification in both languages, however, given {{that more than half of}} NPs determined by an indefinite article also contain an <b>adnominal</b> modifier. ...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{assuming}} {{that there is}} an intermediate functional category called Agreement Phrase (AGRP) in DP, I argue that an <b>adnominal</b> modifier such as a pre-nominal adjective or relative clause (RC) is base-generated in Spec,AGRP. In particular, I distinguish between Restrictive <b>Adnominal</b> Modifiers (RAM) and Non-restrictive <b>Adnominal</b> Modifiers (NAM), and argue that the NAM in head-final languages moves overtly out of the scope of the determiner to Spec,DP, while the NAM in head-initial languages moves covertly in LF. Finally I claim that the movement of the NAM to Spec,DP is due to a NON-FOCUS feature of the determiner and the NAM in terms of the feature-checking theory (Chomsky 1995). ...|$|E

40|$|In Sibe, the {{perfective}} {{aspect of}} verbs may occur in three forms: -Xei, -Xeŋe, and -Xe. Although all of these three forms occur as predicates of main clauses, only -Xe may occur in <b>adnominal</b> clauses. This paper attempts to give an explanation for this syntactic peculiarity from the functional characteristics of -Xe in main clauses, and argues that, 1) -Xei and -Xeŋe have some function of knowledge management of the speaker and the hearer, whereas -Xe does not. 2) -Xei and -Xeŋe cannot occur in <b>adnominal</b> clause because knowledge management in discourse is only possible taking more-independent clauses (main clauses, complement clauses and nominal clauses) as a unit and not taking less-independent ones (<b>adnominal</b> clauses and adverbial clauses) as a unit...|$|E

40|$|This article {{examines}} whether the preposition 'de' in the predicate noun may be analyzed as {{a mark of}} the genitive in French. The genitive in French is identified {{on the basis of}} language internal arguments {{on the one hand and}} a comparison with Russian on the other hand. It is shown that only one type of prepositional predicates corresponds to a genitive in Russian. This type of PP stems from an <b>adnominal</b> modifier, which does not meet the internal criteria of the genitive. It is argued that its correspondence with a genitive in Russian is due to the intrinsic <b>adnominal</b> character of the genitive case. In contrast, <b>adnominal</b> complements become verbal when occurring in predicative position and 'de' has then an increased prepositional value...|$|E
40|$|The {{semantic}} {{function of}} the modifier together in <b>adnominal</b> position has generally been considered {{to be that of}} preventing a distributive reading of the predicate. On the basis of a new range of data, I will argue that this view is mistaken. The semantic function of <b>adnominal</b> together rather is that of inducing a cumulative measurement of the group that together is associated with. The measurement-based analysis of <b>adnominal</b> together that I propose can also, with some modifications, be extended to adverbial occurrences of together. Together is an expression that can act both as an <b>adnominal</b> modifier, as in (1 a), and as an adverbial one, as in (1 b) and (1 c), and in the two positions it exhibits rather different readings: ð 1 Þ a: John andMary together weigh 200 pounds. b: John andMary together earn more than 100, 000 dollars a year. ð 2 Þ a: John and Mary are writing a book together. b: John and Marysang together. c: John and Mary sat together. The function of together in <b>adnominal</b> position as in (1 a,b) has usually been taken to be that of an antidistributivity marker and in adverbial position as specifying collective or cooperative action (2 a,b) or spatiotemporal prox-imity (2 c). As always, the preferred analysis would be one that posits a single lexical meaning of together and derives the various readings from that meaning in conjunction with the syntactic and semantic context in which together occurs. The present account, which is trying to achieve that, takes as its point of departure a reevaluation of the apparent antidistributive reading dis-played by together in <b>adnominal</b> position. I will argue that the function of <b>adnominal</b> together is in fact not that of preventing a distributive reading of the predicate, but rather that of inducing a cumulative numerical I would like to thank Barry Smith, Kit Fine, and Bob Fiengo, among others, for stimulating discussions on the topic.
