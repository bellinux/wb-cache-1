5|$|Part of the <b>arm</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> 9th- or 10th-century stone cross was {{discovered}} when {{a house in}} the village—Styles House, near the River Piddle—was demolished. The cross might have been connected with a meeting place. The fragment was incorporated into the parish church's new chancel when it was rebuilt in 1911.|$|E
5|$|The {{foreground}} {{figure of}} the older man may be a reference to Ugolino from Dante's Inferno—a subject that Géricault had contemplated painting—and seems to borrow from a painting of Ugolini by Henry Fuseli (1741–1825) that Géricault may have known from prints. In Dante, Ugolino is guilty of cannibalism, {{which was one of}} the most sensational aspects of the days on the raft. Géricault seems to allude to this through the borrowing from Fuseli. An early study for The Raft of the Medusa in watercolour, now in the Louvre, is much more explicit, depicting a figure gnawing on the <b>arm</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> headless corpse.|$|E
5|$|The {{command of}} the German V Corps, trapped with the IX Army north of Forst, passed from the IV Panzer Army to the IX Army. The corps was still {{holding on to the}} Berlin-Cottbus highway front line. Field Marshal Ferdinand Schörner's Army Group Centre {{launched}} a counter-offensive aimed at breaking through to Berlin from the south and making a successful initial incursion (the Battle of Bautzen) in the 1st Ukrainian Front region, engaging the 2nd Polish Army and elements of the Red Army's 52nd Army and 5th Guards Army. When the old southern flank of the IV Panzer Army had some local successes counter-attacking north against the 1st Ukrainian Front, Hitler gave orders that showed his grasp of military reality was completely gone. He ordered the IX Army to hold Cottbus and set up a front facing west. Then they were to attack the Soviet columns advancing north. This would supposedly allow them to form a northern pincer that would meet the IV Panzer Army coming from the south and envelop the 1st Ukrainian Front before destroying it. They were to anticipate a southward attack by the III Panzer Army and be ready to be the southern <b>arm</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> pincer attack that would envelop 1st Belorussian Front, which would be destroyed by SS-General Felix Steiner's Army Detachment advancing from north of Berlin. Later in the day, when Steiner explained {{that he did not have}} the divisions to do this, Heinrici made it clear to Hitler's staff that unless the IX Army retreated immediately, it would be enveloped by the Soviets. He stressed that it was already too late for it to move north-west to Berlin and would have to retreat west. Heinrici went on to say that if Hitler did not allow it to move west, he would ask to be relieved of his command.|$|E
50|$|The {{doctrine}} of coverture {{carried over into}} British heraldry, in which there were established traditional methods of displaying the coat <b>of</b> <b>arms</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> unmarried woman, displaying the coat <b>of</b> <b>arms</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> widow, or displaying the combined coat <b>of</b> <b>arms</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> couple jointly, but no accepted method of displaying the coat <b>of</b> <b>arms</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> married woman separately as an individual.|$|R
25|$|<b>Arms</b> <b>of</b> such councils may {{feature the}} {{historical}} ecclesiastical <b>arms</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> local church, cathedral or diocese, {{such as the}} <b>arms</b> <b>of</b> Watford Borough Council which feature the <b>arms</b> <b>of</b> the Diocese of St. Albans. Similarly they can also feature the <b>arms</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> local patron Saint, as in the <b>arms</b> <b>of</b> St. Edmundsbury Borough Council which features the coat <b>of</b> <b>arms</b> <b>of</b> Saint Edmund. Another example {{is the use of}} the rose, the symbol of the Virgin Mary. Others are derived from the <b>arms</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> associated influential family or local organisation, or their creation is granted as an honour to an influential person.|$|R

25|$|A common {{explanation}} of the trough's formation {{is that it is}} an aulacogen, an abandoned <b>arm</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> three-armed radial rift system. The other two arms continued to spread during the break-up of Gondwana, as South America separated from Africa.|$|E

25|$|Levonorgestrel-releasing implant is {{implanted}} {{under the}} skin in the upper <b>arm</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> woman, by creating a small incision and inserting the capsules in a fanlike shape. Insertion usually takes 15 minutes and the capsules can sometimes be seen {{under the skin}}, although usually they look like small veins. They can also be felt under the skin. Once inserted, the contraceptive works within 24 hours and lasts up to five years.|$|E

25|$|The {{experimental}} apparatus {{consisted of}} a torsion balance {{with a pair of}} 2-inch 1.61-pound lead spheres suspended from the <b>arm</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> torsion balance and two much larger stationary lead balls (350 pounds). Cavendish intended to measure the force of gravitational attraction between the two. He noticed that Michell's apparatus would be sensitive to temperature differences and induced air currents so he made modifications by isolating the apparatus in a separate room with external controls and telescopes for making observations.|$|E
25|$|Bass became {{widely known}} in the film {{industry}} after creating the title sequence for Otto Preminger's The Man with the Golden Arm (1955). The subject of the film was a jazz musician's struggle to overcome his heroin addiction, a taboo subject in the mid-1950s. Bass decided to create an innovative title sequence to match the film's controversial subject. He chose the arm as the central image, {{as it is a}} strong image relating to heroin addiction. The titles featured an animated, white on black paper cut-out <b>arm</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> heroin addict. As he hoped, it caused quite a sensation.|$|E
25|$|When two mature microRNAs {{originate}} from opposite {{arms of the}} same pre-miRNA and are found in roughly similar amounts, they are denoted with a -3p or -5p suffix. (In the past, this distinction was also made with 's' (sense) and 'as' (antisense)). However, the mature microRNA found from one arm of the hairpin is usually much more abundant than that found from the other arm, in which case, an asterisk following the name indicates the mature species found at low levels from the opposite <b>arm</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> hairpin. For example, miR-124 and miR-124* share a pre-miRNA hairpin, but much more miR-124 {{is found in the}} cell.|$|E

25|$|This {{process was}} later {{performed}} on the human body (in {{the image on the}} left): the physician tied a tight ligature onto the upper <b>arm</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> person. This would cut off blood flow from the arteries and the veins. When this was done, the arm below the ligature was cool and pale, while above the ligature it was warm and swollen. The ligature was loosened slightly, which allowed blood from the arteries to come into the arm, since arteries are deeper in the flesh than the veins. When this was done, the opposite effect was seen in the lower arm. It was now warm and swollen. The veins were also more visible, since now they were full of blood.|$|E
25|$|Forrest {{kept up the}} {{pressure}} and on November 23 heavy skirmishing occurred from Henryville {{to the outskirts of}} Mount Pleasant. At Fouche Springs (near present-day Summertown) that evening, the Confederate cavalrymen raided one of Capron's encampments, throwing them into chaos and capturing over 50 prisoners. Forrest came close to becoming a casualty as he mistakenly rode into a small group of Federals. One of his staff officers, Maj. John P. Strange, deflected the <b>arm</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Union soldier who was aiming his pistol directly at Forrest's chest at close range and the bullet narrowly missed. The survivors from Capron's brigade fled toward Columbia. To the east, Forrest's divisions under Brig. Gens. Abraham Buford and William H. Jackson forced Hatch's division out of the Lawrenceburg area and drove them back toward Pulaski.|$|E
25|$|To the Lakota Native Americans, Tayamnicankhu (Orion’s Belt) is {{the spine}} of a bison. The great {{rectangle}} of Orion are the bison's ribs; the Pleiades star cluster in nearby Taurus is the bison’s head; and Sirius in Canis Major, known as Tayamnisinte, is its tail. Another Lakota myth mentions that {{the bottom half of}} Orion, the Constellation of the Hand, represented the <b>arm</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> chief that was ripped off by the Thunder People as a punishment from the gods for his selfishness. His daughter offered to marry the person who can retrieve his arm from the sky, so the young warrior Fallen Star (whose father was a star and whose mother was human) returned his arm and married his daughter, symbolizing harmony between the gods and humanity {{with the help of the}} younger generation. The index finger is represented by Rigel; the Orion Nebula is the thumb; the Belt of Orion is the wrist; and the star Beta Eridani is the pinky finger.|$|E

500|$|The British Army uniform has sixteen categories, {{ranging from}} {{ceremonial}} uniforms to combat dress to evening wear. No. 8 Dress, the day-to-day uniform, {{is known as}} [...] "Personal Clothing System – Combat Uniform" [...] (PCS-CU) and consists of a Multi-Terrain Pattern (MTP) windproof smock, a lightweight jacket and trousers with ancillary items such as thermals and waterproofs. The army has introduced tactical recognition flashes (TRFs); worn on the right <b>arm</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> combat uniform, the insignia denotes the wearer's regiment or corps.|$|E
500|$|A. fragilis is {{the type}} species and was named by Marsh in 1877. It is known from the remains of at least sixty individuals, all found in the Kimmeridgian–Tithonian Upper Jurassic-age Morrison Formation of the United States, spread across the states of Colorado, Montana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Utah, and Wyoming. Details of the humerus (upper <b>arm)</b> <b>of</b> <b>A.</b> fragilis {{have been used as}} {{diagnostic}} among Morrison theropods, but the discovery of [...] "A. jimmadseni" [...] indicates that this will no longer be the case at the species level.|$|E

500|$|Computed tomography, with radiocontrast in the venous phase (CT {{venography}} or CTV), has a detection {{rate that}} in some regards exceeds that of MRI. The test involves injection into a vein (usually in the <b>arm)</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> radioopaque substance, and time is allowed for the bloodstream to carry it to the cerebral veins - {{at which point the}} scan is performed. It has a sensitivity of 75-100% (it detects 75-100% of all clots present), and a specificity of 81-100% (it would be incorrectly positive in 0-19%). In the first two weeks, the [...] "empty delta sign" [...] may be observed (in later stages, this sign may disappear).|$|E
500|$|Saguaros, which {{flourish}} in both districts of the park, grow at an exceptionally slow rate. The first <b>arm</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> saguaro typically appears when the cactus is between 50 and 70 years old {{though it may}} be closer to 100 years in places where precipitation is very low. Saguaros may live as long as 200 years and are considered mature at about age 125. A mature saguaro may grow up to [...] tall and weigh up to [...] when fully hydrated. The total number of saguaros in the park is estimated at 1.8million, and 24 other species of cactus are abundant. The most common of these are the fishhook barrel, staghorn cholla, pinkflower hedgehog, Engelman's prickly pear, teddybear cholla, and jumping cholla.|$|E
