This was nearly {{a decade after the}} United States Supreme Court had ruled in Brown v. Board of Education (1954) that segregation of public schools was unconstitutional. The federal district court ordered that the three students be admitted to Murphy for the 1964 school year, leading to the desegregation of Mobile County's school system.|$|E

25|$|After the Supreme Court's {{decision}} in Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas in 1954 that segregation {{in public schools}} was unconstitutional, some students worked to integrate schools in the state. The Little Rock Nine brought Arkansas to national attention in 1957 when the Federal government had to intervene to protect <b>African-American</b> <b>students</b> trying to integrate {{a high school in}} the Arkansas capital. Governor Orval Faubus had ordered the Arkansas National Guard to aid segregationists in preventing nine <b>African-American</b> <b>students</b> from enrolling at Little Rock's Central High School. After attempting three times to contact Faubus, President Dwight D. Eisenhower sent 1000 troops from the active-duty 101st Airborne Division to escort and protect the <b>African-American</b> <b>students</b> as they entered school on September 25, 1957. In defiance of federal court orders to integrate, the governor and city of Little Rock decided to close the high schools {{for the remainder of the}} school year. By the fall of 1959, the Little Rock high schools were completely integrated.|$|E
