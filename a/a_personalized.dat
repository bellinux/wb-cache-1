5|$|Crosby {{was invited}} in 1892 {{to serve as}} {{head coach of the}} United States Naval Academy {{football}} program. He accepted the position, and, using unusually rigorous practicing strategies, led the team to a 5–2 record, culminating in an upset victory over rival Army in the Army–Navy Game. He received commendation for the victory, including a gift of <b>a</b> <b>personalized</b> trophy. Following the season's conclusion, Crosby returned to New York to continue his studies, but he was hospitalized after an illness he contracted while coaching worsened shortly after his arrival. He died from typhoid fever in late December, at the age of 24.|$|E
5|$|Farmer {{moved from}} trumpet to playing mostly flugelhorn {{from the early}} 1960s, utilising the latter instrument's more mellow sound and Farmer's ability {{to get what he}} wanted from it without having to use a mute. In 1989, he played a major part in {{creating}} a trumpet–flugelhorn hybrid, the flumpet, which was constructed for him by instrument maker David Monette. This instrument allowed him to play with more expression in a range of settings, from small groups to big bands. In 1997, Monette presented him with <b>a</b> <b>personalized</b> flumpet, with decorations symbolising important people and places in Farmer's life.|$|E

Hence this research also shows that solely adding gamification mechanisms such as challenges in <b>a</b> <b>personalizing</b> interface is not enough to significantly enhance the quality of the perceived experience...|$|R

5|$|The process upon being branded is {{a painful}} {{experience}} for the person as the body would either accept the seal or reject it. Once one's body accepts the seal, they can assume its First Level where the seal spreads from its point of application across the user's body, increasing their chakra supply and their physical abilities in the process. When the seal is deactivated, the user is left exhausted, having expended all their energy during its use. The Second Level of the Cursed Seal is achieved by allowing the seal to engulf the users entire body, ultimately causing the person to transform into <b>a</b> <b>personalized</b> parody of Sage Mode with various strengths and weakness. The means to achieve the Second Level is by being given a drug and entering a state of lifelessness.|$|E
5|$|From 1987 through 1994 {{the award}} was given {{out by a}} panel of science fiction experts led by Orson Scott Card. Beginning in 1995, the {{committee}} was replaced by a group of jurors, who vote on the nominations submitted for consideration. The initial jurors were James Gunn, Frederik Pohl, and Judith Merril. Merril was replaced on the jury by former winner Kij Johnson in 1997, one of Sturgeon's children—Noel Sturgeon in most years—was added to the panel in 1999, and George Zebrowski was added to the panel in 2005. Nominations are submitted by reviewers, fans, publishers, and editors, and are collated by the current Director of the Center for the Study of Science Fiction, Christopher McKitterick, into a list of finalists to be voted on by the jury. The maximum eligible length that a work may be is not formally defined by the center. The winner is selected by May of each year, and is presented at the Campbell Conference awards banquet in June at the University of Kansas in Lawrence, as part of the centerpiece of the conference along with the Campbell Award.
