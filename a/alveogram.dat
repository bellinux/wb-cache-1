40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the rheological properties of noodles containing garlic powder, which was added to noodle bases at 1, 3 and 5 % concentrations. The physical properties of the noodles with garlic powder were tested by a rapid viscoanalyzer (RVA), a farinogram, and an <b>alveogram.</b> The initial pasting temperature were increased with the increments in the ratio of garlic powder, whereas peak viscosity, breakdown decreased. The consistency of Farinogram was increased with the increments in the ratio of garlic powder but did not show a significant difference. The mechanical tolerance index value of noodles containing garlic powder were lower than that of the control. The Pmax and L value of the <b>alveogram</b> decreased with garlic powder increments...|$|E
40|$|Reducing agents like L-cysteine {{are used}} in bread baking of strong flours, with short gluten to reduce mixing andfermentation time. The {{aim of this study}} is to {{determine}} if L-cysteine may be an improving agent for the quality of breadobtained from high extraction flours with normal gluten. The tested high extraction flour was analyzed by determination of several quality indicators such as wet gluten content,gluten deformation index, moisture, ash, Falling Number index and <b>alveogram</b> parameters of dough. The resultsindicate that flour has a normal gluten network, is “good” for bread making and has a normal α-amylase activity. After its addition to dough, L-cysteine improves the physical properties of bread made with high extraction flour. Theobserved increase for bread volume was maximum 10 %, for porosity maximum 5, 75 % and for elasticity maximum 2, 58 %, comparing with reference bread. The proposed solution can be assimilated into pan bread making technology...|$|E
40|$|Two {{hundred and}} ninety F 9 {{recombinant}} inbred lines (RILs) {{derived from the}} bread wheat cultivar Gaocheng 8901 and the waxy wheat cultivar Nuomai 1 were used in determining the high-molecular-weight glutenin subunit (HMW-GS) and waxy protein subunit combinations and their effects on the dough quality and texture profile analysis (TPA) of cooked Chinese noodles. Seven alleles were detected at Glu- 1 loci. There were two alleles found {{at each of the}} Wx-A 1, Wx-B 1 and Wx-D 1 loci. Eight allelic combinations were observed for HMW-GS, LMW-GS and waxy proteins, respectively. Both the 1 / 7 + 8 / 5 + 10 and 1 / 7 + 8 / 5 + 12 combinations contributed to dough elasticity, and the 1 / 7 + 8 / 5 + 10 combination also provided better TPA characteristics. Compared to Wx protein, HMW-GS was more important on dough <b>alveogram</b> properties. LMW-GS significantly affected springiness and cohesiveness; HMW-GS mainly affected the hardness; Wx×LMW-GS significantly affected the springiness, cohesiveness and chewiness; HMW-GS×Wx×LMW-GS mainly influenced the springiness and chewiness. But HMW-GS×LMW-GS only affected the spinginess. These indicated the TPA of noodles was significantly affected by the interactions between glutenin and Wx proteins...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this work is to investigate the effect of enzyme xylanase on the technological behaviour of wheat flours, particularly in alveograms and bread making, using two flour qualities and two bread making methods. The enzyme used was xylanase from Bacillus subtilis which is sold for mainly for baking applications. Breads were made applying both the French and the pan bread methods. Experts scored the external and internal characteristics of breads. Increase in enzyme concentration produced a decrease in maximum pressure (P) and tensile strength/extensibility (P/L) but deformation energy (W) remained almost constant in the <b>alveogram.</b> This means that the water released by the hydrolysis of insoluble pentosans has reduced the tenacity of the dough. The higher the enzyme concentration, the lower the dough consistency during kneading. Besides, the greatest improvement of quality was produced when xylanase was added to low quality flour and when the French type bread making method was applied.

40|$|Given {{increasing}} {{dependence on}} imported wheat, {{studies have been}} carried out in Colombia regarding the use of composite wheat-cassava flour in bread-making. A project was carried out from 1986 - 1991 in which different cassava genotypes, harvest ages, substitution levels and bread acceptability were evaluated. However, these studies did not have any effect on the baking sector because a constant supply of high quality, high volume and reasonably-priced cassava flour was lacking. Based on these studies, this work was aimed at determining the influence of three industrial cassava market genotypes (CMC- 40, HMC- 1, MCOL- 1505), using four wheat-cassava flour composite substitution levels (0 %, 5 %, 10 %, 15 %) regarding the rheological and fermentative characteristics of dough in bread-making. Farinogram, <b>alveogram,</b> amylogram and falling number index analysis were analysed. Specific volume and acceptability of three types of bread (common, mold and hamburger) were evaluated. It was determined that composite flours had higher fiber and reduced sugar content than the wheat flour pattern, thereby increasing wa-ter absorption and available sugar content during fermentation. Dough development time for the composite flours was half the a-verage required for wheat flour and the tolerance index was higher; its stability became reduced due to increased substitution le-vels and its firmness increased due to a rise in water absorption. Falling number values came within an acceptable range (250 - 400 s). The specific volume of all bread having 5 % and 10 % substitution was higher than that for the pattern. The best general acceptability was assigned to common and mold type bread from all varieties and substitution levels...|$|E
