5|$|Rotavirus infections occur {{primarily}} during cool, dry seasons. The number <b>attributable</b> to {{food contamination}} is unknown.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} screenwriting began, Lewton {{claimed that the}} idea for the film was an {{original}} one <b>attributable</b> to himself. Leo Mittler did the treatment and Donald Henderson Clarke wrote the script, although Lewton significantly revised the screenplay and wrote many lines of dialogue himself.|$|E
5|$|Claims {{have been}} made of a sugar–Alzheimer's disease connection, but debate {{continues}} over whether cognitive decline is <b>attributable</b> to dietary fructose or to overall energy intake.|$|E
5|$|Several related medical {{conditions}} involve sebum—including acne, sebaceous cysts, hyperplasia, and sebaceous adenoma. These are usually <b>attributable</b> to overactive sebaceous glands, which produce excess sebum.|$|E
5|$|The complex geology {{and narrow}} seams made the coal {{extraction}} difficult; three underground explosions, in 1893, 1895 and 1908, were amongst the first <b>attributable</b> solely to airborne coal dust.|$|E
5|$|Verner's {{arguments}} {{together with}} the scarcity of artefacts <b>attributable</b> to Shepseskare have now convinced many Egyptologists, such as Darrell Baker and Erik Hornung, that Shepseskare's reign was indeed ephemeral.|$|E
5|$|A {{study from}} the University of California, Los Angeles {{estimated}} in 2007 that extending marriage rights to same-sex couples {{would result in a}} net gain of approximately $3.2 million each year to the state budget. The study drew on data from the U.S. Census Bureau and Maryland statistical reports. The gain is <b>attributable</b> to savings in expenditures on means-tested public benefit programs and an increase in sales and lodging tax revenue from weddings and wedding-related tourism.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 19th century, the Limousin region was characterised by the mediocrity of its animals. Texier-Olivier Louis, prefect of the Haute-Vienne, observed that Limousin cattle weighed 300 to 350kg and measured 1.5 metres at the withers. The defect was considered to be <b>attributable</b> to poor genetics, nutrition and breeding practices. In competitions, Limousin cattle were among the worst performers. The breed was considered to be a working breed, but poorly shaped and with poor milk.|$|E
5|$|Dengue can {{occasionally}} affect {{several other}} body systems, either in isolation or {{along with the}} classic dengue symptoms. A decreased level of consciousness occurs in 0.5–6% of severe cases, which is <b>attributable</b> either to inflammation of the brain by the virus or indirectly {{as a result of}} impairment of vital organs, for example, the liver.|$|E
5|$|Earned runs are runs {{that are}} {{directly}} <b>attributable</b> to a pitcher's efforts without a lapse by the defense. An unearned run does not adversely impact a pitcher's {{earned run average}} (ERA), and is only possible when an error (including catcher's interference) or a passed ball occurs earlier in the inning. Unearned runs are primarily discussed in rule 10.16 and often require a judgment call by the official scorer.|$|E
5|$|Excluding these, {{surprisingly}} few documents {{dating to}} Unas' reign have survived to this day, considering the 30-year length that later records give for his reign. Excavations at Abusir, the royal necropolis of the Fifth Dynasty, have produced only four dated inscriptions safely <b>attributable</b> to Unas. They explicitly mention his third, fourth, sixth and eighth {{years on the}} throne. Unas also left a rock inscription {{on the island of}} Elephantine, next to the First Cataract of the Nile in Nubia.|$|E
5|$|Extracts of the puffball {{have strong}} {{antitumor}} activity in mouse models <b>attributable</b> to protein-bound polysaccharides, the compounds calvatan, craniformin, and a tautomer of rubroflavin. Calvatan {{is thought to}} act by stimulating the immune response, rather than by killing cells. Craniformin, originally reported in 1997, is an azoformamide compound. Three sterol compounds have been identified from the fungus: ergosta-4,6,8(14), 22-tetraene-3-one, ergosta-7,22-diene-3-ol, and ergosterol peroxide.|$|E
5|$|Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport, near Dania Beach, Florida, is the city's main {{airport and}} is the {{fastest-growing}} major airport in the country. This is, in part, <b>attributable</b> to service by low-cost carriers such as Spirit Airlines, JetBlue Airways, Southwest Airlines and Virgin America, resulting in lower airfares than nearby Miami International Airport. Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood is an emerging international gateway for the Caribbean and Latin America. Miami International Airport and Palm Beach International Airport also serve the city.|$|E
5|$|Galveston is {{the home}} of several of the largest {{teaching}} hospitals in the state, located {{on the campus of the}} University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston. Prior to Hurricane Ike, the University employed more than 12,000 people. Its significant growth in the 1970s and 1980s was <b>attributable</b> to a uniquely qualified management and medical faculty including: Mr. John Thompson; Dr. William James McGanity, Dr. William Levin, Dr. David Daeschner and many more.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, Warren and David Himmelstein {{published}} {{a study on}} bankruptcy and medical bills, which found that half of all families filing for bankruptcy did so {{in the aftermath of}} a serious medical problem. They say that three-quarters of such families had medical insurance. This study was widely cited in policy debates, although some have challenged the study's methods and offered alternative interpretations of the data, suggesting that only seventeen percent of bankruptcies are directly <b>attributable</b> to medical expenses.|$|E
5|$|Normally shy or {{indifferent}} {{to the presence of}} divers, the Caribbean reef shark has been known to become aggressive in the presence of food and grows sufficiently large to be considered potentially dangerous. As of 2008, the International Shark Attack File lists 27 attacks <b>attributable</b> to this species, 4 of them unprovoked, and none fatal.|$|E
5|$|Occupational {{chemical}} {{exposure to}} benzene and other aromatic organic solvents is controversial {{as a cause}} of AML. Benzene and many of its derivatives are known to be carcinogenic in vitro. While some studies have suggested a link between occupational exposure to benzene and increased risk of AML, others have suggested the <b>attributable</b> risk, if any, is slight.|$|E
5|$|Ordinarily, spinner sharks do {{not pose}} a {{substantial}} danger to humans; they do not perceive large mammals as prey, as their small, narrow teeth are adapted for grasping rather than cutting. However, they can become excited {{by the presence of}} food, so caution is warranted if this species is encountered while spearfishing. As of 2008, the International Shark Attack File listed 16 unprovoked attacks and one provoked attack <b>attributable</b> to the spinner shark, none of them fatal.|$|E
5|$|Overall, the {{hurricane}} caused $26.5million in damages, with $11.5million to property and $15million to crops, with the storm's damage in Texas spread across twelve counties. This {{would make the}} storm the most costly of {{the hurricane}} season. Despite the hurricane's wide swath of damage and strong intensity, only eight people were killed. The low number of fatalities is <b>attributable</b> to the extensive evacuation procedures which underwent prior to the storm, as well as warnings provided by the Weather Bureau.|$|E
5|$|Qeshm Island {{is part of}} the Simply Folded Belt, {{the most}} seismically active part of the Zagros fold and thrust belt. Similar to most {{earthquakes}} in the area, the 2005 event resulted from reverse slip faulting. Since it lies in such a seismically active area, there is a high risk of destructive earthquakes in Iran; 1 in 3,000 deaths are <b>attributable</b> to earthquakes. One geophysicist has cited the lack of strict building codes as a serious concern.|$|E
5|$|September 25, 1939: The 1939 California {{tropical}} storm made landfall near Long Beach. Winds were near 80km/h (50mph) and rain was near 12inches (300mm). At sea, 48people were killed. On land, 45 {{were killed in}} flooding, although these deaths may be partially <b>attributable</b> to a nasty thunderstorm immediately preceding the {{tropical storm}}. This is the only known landfall in California by a tropical cyclone at tropical storm strength, during the twentieth century.|$|E
5|$|Ten of {{the twenty}} A-4Gs were lost during the type's service with the RAN. This gave the Skyhawk a poor safety record, {{but the high}} loss rate was at least {{partially}} <b>attributable</b> to the intrinsic dangers involved in operating from an aircraft carrier. Two pilots were killed in these accidents.|$|E
5|$|The Layer Pyramid (known locally in Arabic as el haram el midawwar, , meaning 'rubble-hill pyramid') is {{a ruined}} step pyramid {{dating to the}} 3rd Dynasty of Egypt (2686 BC to 2613 BC) and located in the {{necropolis}} of Zawyet El Aryan. Its ownership is uncertain and may be <b>attributable</b> to pharaoh Khaba. The pyramid architecture, however, {{is very similar to}} that of the Buried Pyramid of king Sekhemkhet and for this reason is firmly datable to the 3rd Dynasty.|$|E
5|$|The city grew rapidly, {{primarily}} <b>attributable</b> to {{its location}} along the east–west transcontinental railroad {{line in the}} United States. In the 1880s, the railroads purchased land in the west from the federal government, which was then sold to individuals to help finance the railroad projects. By the 1890s, Flagstaff found itself located along {{one of the busiest}} railroad corridors in the U.S., with 80–100 trains travelling through the city every day, destined for Chicago, Los Angeles, and elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|The fire {{resulted}} in 244people requiring medical aidmainly {{on the first}} day of the fire. From those 117 had symptoms <b>attributable</b> to the incident, of whom 38 were members of the public. The majority of those visiting hospitals were from the rescue services and attended for precautionary check ups. Most of them had no symptoms, except for 63 emergency workers who suffered respiratory complaints, of which half were sore throats.|$|E
5|$|The {{poisonous}} fruit bodies cause neurotoxic symptoms if ingested, {{an effect}} <b>attributable</b> to the compound polyporic acid, which {{is present in}} high concentrations. When an alkaline solution {{is placed on the}} fungus, the flesh turns violet. The fungus is used in mushroom dyeing to produce purple colors.|$|E
5|$|The region {{also plays}} an {{important}} role in defense contracting, with particular emphasis in the shipbuilding and ship repair businesses for the city of Norfolk. Major private shipyards located in Norfolk or the Hampton Roads area include: Huntington Ingalls Industries (formerly Northrop Grumman Newport News) in Newport News, BAE Systems Norfolk Ship Repair, General Dynamics NASSCO Norfolk, and Colonna's Shipyard Inc., while the US Navy's Norfolk Naval Shipyard is just across the Downtown Tunnel in Portsmouth. Most contracts fulfilled by these shipyards are issued by the Navy, though some private commercial repair also takes place. Over 35% of Gross Regional Product (which includes the entire Norfolk-Newport News-Virginia Beach MSA), is <b>attributable</b> to defense spending, and that 75% of all regional growth since 2001 is <b>attributable</b> to increases in defense spending.|$|E
5|$|Witchfinder General {{eventually}} {{developed into}} a cult film, partially <b>attributable</b> to Reeves's 1969 death from a drug overdose {{at the age of}} 25, only nine months after Witchfinders release. Over the years, several prominent critics have championed the film, including J. Hoberman, Danny Peary, Robin Wood, and Derek Malcolm. In 2005, the magazine Total Film named Witchfinder General the 15th-greatest horror film of all time.|$|E
5|$|Also <b>attributable</b> to Gasparo Cairano, {{and dated}} at this stage, is the {{singular}} St John the Baptist {{placed in the}} tympanum of the capitol of the eponymous Abbey in Parma. The work, undocumented and traditionally attributed by critics to Antonio Ferrari d'Agrate, was assigned in 2010 to the catalog {{of the works of}} Cairano due to obvious correlation with the mature art of the artist. This spread of Gasparo's artistic reach is significant and demonstrates that he could prove a success even outside of Brescia.|$|E
5|$|Because of its slow {{reproductive}} rate, the {{dusky shark}} is very vulnerable to human-caused population depletion. This species is highly valued by commercial fisheries for its fins, used in shark fin soup, {{and for its}} meat, skin, and liver oil. It is also esteemed by recreational fishers. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed this species as Near Threatened worldwide and Vulnerable off the eastern United States, where populations have dropped to 1520% of 1970s levels. The dusky shark is regarded as potentially dangerous to humans due to its large size, but there are few attacks <b>attributable</b> to it.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the 20th century, the {{intersection}} was handling 30,000 drivers a day, from increasingly developed Cornwall, Newburgh and New Windsor. NYSDOT expanded {{the intersection}} with middle-turn lanes and overhead signs on all approaches. Many drivers still felt it was a confusing intersection and that the confusion slowed traffic down as much as the many cars' stopping to enter and exit nearby businesses. In 2001 state officials said they had done everything possible to improve traffic flows through the Five Corners. Continuing congestion was <b>attributable</b> to insufficient or nonexistent planning.|$|E
5|$|Chadwick {{was himself}} {{a critic of}} Big Science in general, and Lawrence in particular, whose {{approach}} he considered careless and focused on technology {{at the expense of}} science. When Lawrence postulated the existence of a new and hitherto unknown particle that he claimed was a possible source of limitless energy at the Solvay Conference in 1933, Chadwick responded that the results were more likely <b>attributable</b> to contamination of the equipment. While Lawrence rechecked his results at Berkeley only to find that Chadwick was correct, Rutherford and Oliphant conducted an investigation at the Cavendish that found that deuterium fuses to form helium-3, thereby causing the effect that the Lawrence had observed. This was another major discovery, but the Oliphant-Rutherford particle accelerator was an expensive state-of-the-art piece of equipment.|$|E
5|$|Damage was {{eventually}} estimated at $100million, and many countries {{responded to the}} emergency with donations of blankets, tents, clothing, and food. Rescue teams were also dispatched to assist local volunteers in finding survivors trapped under the debris. The destruction around the earthquake's epicenter was, in places, almost total; this {{has been attributed to}} poor construction practices in rural areas, and imparted momentum to a growing movement for changes in building codes for earthquake-safe buildings. With 1 in 3,000 deaths in Iran <b>attributable</b> to earthquakes, a US geophysicist has suggested that a country-wide rebuilding program would be needed to address the ongoing public safety concerns.|$|E
5|$|Dzungariotherium orgosensis was {{described}} in 1973 based on fossilsmainly teethfrom Dzungaria in Xinjiang, northwest China. In 2017, a new species, P. huangheense, was named based on jaw elements from the Hanjiajing Formation in the Gansu Province of China; the name refers to the nearby Huanghe River. P. huangheense differs from P. bugtiense only in the anatomy of the rear portion of the jaw, {{as well as its}} larger size. A multitude of other species and genus namesmostly based on differences in size, snout shape, and front tooth arrangementhave been coined for various indricothere remains. Fossils <b>attributable</b> to Paraceratherium continue to be discovered across Eurasia, but the political situation in Pakistan has become too unstable for further excavations to occur there.|$|E
5|$|Following {{historical}} sources, Shepseskare was traditionally {{believed to}} have reigned for seven years, succeeding Neferirkare Kakai and preceding Neferefre on the throne, making him the fourth ruler of the dynasty. He is the most obscure ruler of this dynasty and the Egyptologist Miroslav Verner has strongly argued that Shepseskare's reign lasted {{only a few months}} at the most, after that of Neferefre. This conclusion is based upon the state and location of Shepseskare's unfinished pyramid in Abusir as well as the very small number of artefacts <b>attributable</b> to this king. Verner's arguments have now convinced several Egyptologists such as Darrell Baker and Erik Hornung.|$|E
5|$|Given its {{formidable}} {{size and}} dentition, the silky shark {{is regarded as}} potentially dangerous to humans. However, it only rarely comes into contact with people due to its oceanic habits. Its natural curiosity and boldness may lead it to repeatedly and closely approach divers, and it can become dangerously excited {{in the presence of}} food. The silky shark tends to be more aggressive if encountered on a reef than in open water. Cases of individual sharks persistently harassing divers and even forcing them out of the water have been reported. As of May 2009, the International Shark Attack File lists six attacks <b>attributable</b> to the silky shark, three of them unprovoked and none fatal.|$|E
