40|$|Even {{though all}} of the F 2 {{seedlings}} that had the genotype Hf-Mf- contained the same anthocyanin composition, {{they did not have}} the same color. The F 2 seedlings that were red (RHS 78 A) had more <b>acidic</b> <b>pHs</b> than those seedlings that were blue (RHS 89 C). The full range of pHs (5. 5 - 6. 3) found in the entire F 2 population was not found within this Hf-Mf- subpopulation (Figure 4). None of the Hf-Mf- seedlings ex-pressed the more <b>acidic</b> <b>pHs.</b> The most <b>acidic</b> <b>pHs</b> were only found in the hfhfMf-and hfhfmfmf subpopulations. This is ex-pected since the Hfl and Phi genes are closely linked on chromosome 1 (Wiering and deVlaming 1984). Our data suggests that the dominant Hfl allele is linked to the recessive phi allele. Flowers that con-tain cyanidin/peonidin should not possess a recessive phi allele. Several conclusions can be drawn from this study. 1. The inheritance of specific flower col-ors can be explained through the com-bined inheritance of anthocyanin pigmen-tation and vacuolar pH. 2. The inheritance of anthocyanin pig-mentation was controlled by multiple in-dependent genes (///and Mf) that followed simple Mendelian genetics. 3. The inheritance of vacuolar pH was more complex, being controlled by two in-dependent codominant genes (Phi and PhZ) and being influenced by the cellular environment. 4. Linkage of the various pH and antho-cyanin genes prevented the expression of {{all of the}} potential gene combinations. It was not possible to obtain seedlings ex-pressing cyanidin/peonidin at the least <b>acidic</b> <b>pHs</b> or delphinidin/malvidin at the more <b>acidic</b> <b>pHs...</b>|$|R

It also occurs on gravelly quartz sand derived from rock outcrops, such as on the rocky hillslopes of the Stirling Range. It is rarely found on gravelly lateritic soils. It is also one of the few Adenanthos species to grow well in moist environments; it will not tolerate seasonal waterlogging—that niche is filled by A.detmoldii—but thrives in damp soils not subject to waterlogging.|$|E

Closer to the mouth water earwort (Scapania undulata), feather moss and bulbous rush (Juncus bulbosus) are also found. Holt's mouse-tail moss (Isothecium holtii) is very common on the banks; the Shimna River {{is one of only}} three known sites for this species in Northern Ireland. It is also the only known location in Northern Ireland where Portuguese feather-moss (Platyhypnidium alopecuroides) is found.|$|E
5|$|In plant cells, vacuoles cover {{anywhere}} from 30% to 90% {{of the total}} cell volume. Most mature plant cells contain one large central vacuole encompassed by a membrane called the tonoplast. Vacuoles of plant cells act as storage compartments for the nutrients and waste of a cell. The solution that these molecules are stored in is called the cell sap. Pigments that color the cell are sometime located in the cell sap. Vacuoles can also {{increase the size of}} the cell, which elongates as water is added, and they control the turgor pressure (the osmotic pressure that keeps the cell wall from caving in). Like lysosomes of animal cells, vacuoles have an <b>acidic</b> <b>pH</b> and contain hydrolytic enzymes. The pH of vacuoles enables them to perform homeostatic procedures in the cell. For example, when the pH in the cells environment drops, the H+ ions surging into the cytosol can be transferred to a vacuole {{in order to keep the}} cytosol's pH constant.|$|E

5|$|The brain {{controls}} {{the rate of}} breathing, mainly by respiratory centres in the medulla and pons. The respiratory centres control respiration, by generating motor signals that are passed down the spinal cord, along the phrenic nerve to the diaphragm and other muscles of respiration. This is a mixed nerve that carries sensory information back to the centres. There are four respiratory centres, three with a more clearly defined function, and an apneustic centre with a less clear function. In the medulla a dorsal respiratory group causes the desire to breathe in and receives sensory information directly from the body. Also in the medulla, the ventral respiratory group influences breathing out during exertion. In the pons the pneumotaxic centre influences the duration of each breath, and the apneustic centre seems to have an influence on inhalation. The respiratory centres directly senses blood carbon dioxide and pH. Information about blood oxygen, carbon dioxide and pH levels are also sensed {{on the walls of}} arteries in the peripheral chemoreceptors of the aortic and carotid bodies. This information is passed via the vagus and glossopharyngeal nerves to the respiratory centres. High carbon dioxide, an <b>acidic</b> <b>pH,</b> or low oxygen stimulate the respiratory centres. The desire to breathe in is also affected by pulmonary stretch receptors in the lungs which, when activated, prevent the lungs from overinflating by transmitting information to the respiratory centres via the vagus nerve.|$|E

25|$|Chlorine dioxide is {{sometimes}} used for bleaching of wood pulp {{in combination with}} chlorine, but it is used alone in ECF (elemental chlorine-free) bleaching sequences. It is used at moderately <b>acidic</b> <b>pH</b> (3.5 to 6). The use of chlorine dioxide minimizes the amount of organochlorine compounds produced.

25|$|Cats on a {{vegan diet}} can develop {{abnormally}} alkaline (high pH) urine {{due to the}} more alkaline pH of plant-based proteins {{in comparison to the}} <b>acidic</b> <b>pH</b> of meat-based foods which cats have evolved to eat. When the urine pH becomes too alkaline, there is an increased risk of formation of struvite (also known as magnesium ammonium phosphate) bladder crystals and/or stones. Calcium oxalate stones can also occur, but these do not occur if the urine is too alkaline, but rather if it is too acidic. Such stones can create irritation and infection of the urinary tract and require veterinary treatment.|$|E
25|$|In {{the human}} {{digestive}} system, a bolus (a small rounded mass of chewed up food) enters the stomach through the oesophagus via the lower oesophageal sphincter. The stomach releases proteases (protein-digesting enzymes such as pepsin) and hydrochloric acid, which kills or inhibits bacteria {{and provides the}} <b>acidic</b> <b>pH</b> of 2 for the proteases to work. Food is churned by the stomach through muscular contractions of the wall called peristalsis – reducing {{the volume of the}} fundus, before looping around the fundus and the body of stomach as the boluses are converted into chyme (partially digested food). Chyme slowly passes through the pyloric sphincter and into the duodenum of the small intestine, where the extraction of nutrients begins. Depending on the quantity and contents of the meal, the stomach will digest the food into chyme within anywhere between forty minutes and a few hours. The average human stomach can comfortably hold about a litre of food.|$|E

25|$|Nebbiolo {{does not}} adapt {{particularly}} well to various vineyard soil types, preferring soils with {{high concentration of}} calcareous marl such as those found on the right bank of the Tanaro river around Alba where Barolo and Barbaresco are produced. The grape can thrive in sandy soils, such as those on the left bank of the Tanaro around the Roero district but the wines from this soil type tend not to be as perfumed - lacking in particular the classic tar aromas. The slightly <b>acidic</b> <b>pH</b> of the sandy Roero soils tend to produce early maturing wines. The lighter wines of Ghemme and Gattinara come from the acidic porphyry soils of the hills between Novara and Vercelli. In the lower Aosta Valley, the soil has {{a high concentration of}} granite while the soils of the Valtellina region of Lombardy are predominantly schist based. In addition to soil type, the drainage ability and concentration of magnesium and potassium can have an influencing effect on the type of Nebbiolo wine is produced.|$|E
25|$|Sanofi-Aventis {{developed}} glargine as a longer-lasting insulin analogue, {{and markets}} {{it under the}} trade name Lantus. It was created by modifying three amino acids. Two positively charged arginine molecules {{were added to the}} C-terminus of the B-chain, and they shift the isoelectric point from 5.4 to 6.7, making glargine more soluble at a slightly <b>acidic</b> <b>pH</b> and less soluble at a physiological pH. Replacing the acid-sensitive asparagine at position 21 in the A-chain by glycine is needed to avoid deamination and dimerization of the arginine residue. These three structural changes and formulation with zinc result in a prolonged action when compared with biosynthetic human insulin. When the pH 4.0 solution is injected, most of the material precipitates and is not bioavailable. A small amount is immediately available for use, and the remainder is sequestered in subcutaneous tissue. As the glargine is used, small amounts of the precipitated material will move into solution in the bloodstream, and the basal level of insulin will be maintained up to 24 hours. The onset of action of subcutaneous insulin glargine is somewhat slower than NPH human insulin. It is clear solution as there is no zinc in formula.|$|E
25|$|The {{physiological}} function of KLK3 is {{the dissolution of}} the coagulum, the sperm entrapping gel composed of semenogelins and fibronectin. Its proteolytic action is effective in liquefying the coagulum so that the sperm can be liberated. The activity of PSA is well regulated. In the prostate it is present as an inactive pro-form which is activated through the action of KLK2, another kallikrein-related peptidase. In the prostate, zinc ion concentrations are ten times higher than in other bodily fluids. Zinc ions have a strong inhibitory effect on the activity of PSA and on that of KLK2, so that PSA is totally inactive. Further regulation is achieved through pH variations. Although its activity is increased by higher pH, the inhibitory effect of zinc also increases. The pH of semen is slightly alkaline and the concentrations of zinc are high. On ejaculation, semen is exposed to the <b>acidic</b> <b>pH</b> of the vagina, due to the presence of lactic acid. In fertile couples, the final vaginal pH after coitus approaches the 6-7 levels, which coincides well with reduced zinc inhibition of PSA. At these pH levels, the reduced PSA activity is countered by a decrease in zinc inhibition. Thus, the coagulum is slowly liquefied, releasing the sperm in a well regulated manner.|$|E

25|$|The {{selection}} of a matrix {{is the first step}} when preparing samples for MALDI analysis. The primary goals of the matrix are to absorb the energy from a laser, thus transferring it to the analyte molecules, and to separate the analyte molecules from each other. A consideration that should be taken into account when choosing a matrix is what type of analyte ion is expected or desired. Knowing the acidity or basicity of the analyte molecule compared with the acidity or basicity of the matrix, for example, is valuable knowledge when choosing a matrix. The matrix should not compete with the analyte molecule, so the matrix should not want to form the same type of ion as the analyte. For example, if the desired analyte has a high amount of acidity, it would be logical to choose a matrix with a high amount of basicity to avoid competition and facilitate the formation of an ion. The pH of the matrix {{can also be used to}} select what sample you want to obtain spectra for. For example, in the case of proteins, a very <b>acidic</b> <b>pH</b> can show very little of the peptide components, but can show very good signal for those components that are larger. If the pH is increased towards a more basic pH, then smaller components become easier to see.|$|E
500|$|Acid rain {{is also a}} {{frequent}} risk produced by lightning. Distilled water has a neutral pH of 7. [...] “Clean” or unpolluted rain has a slightly <b>acidic</b> <b>pH</b> of about 5.2, because carbon dioxide and water in the air react together to form carbonic acid, a weak acid (pH 5.6 in distilled water), but unpolluted rain also contains other chemicals. Nitric oxide present during thunderstorm phenomena, caused by the oxidation of atmospheric nitrogen, can result {{in the production of}} acid rain, if nitric oxide forms compounds with the water molecules in precipitation, thus creating acid rain. Acid rain can damage infrastructures containing calcite or certain other solid chemical compounds. In ecosystems, acid rain can dissolve plant tissues of vegetations and increase acidification process in bodies of water and in soil, resulting in deaths of marine and terrestrial organisms.|$|E

40|$|The West Spur Clovis class {{rocks in}} Gusev Crater {{are some of}} the most altered rocks in Gusev Crater and likely contain a mixed sulfate and {{phyllosilicate}} mineralogy [1, 2]. The high S and Cl content of the Clovis rocks suggests that acidic vapors or fluids of H 2 SO 4 and HCl reacted with the Clovis parent rock to form Ca, Mg,- sulfates, iron-oxyhydroxides and secondary aluminosilicates (approx. 60 wt. %) of a poorly crystalline nature (e. g., allophane) [1].
