5|$|All ballots, {{absentee}} ballot envelopes, and voting machines were impounded under a court injunction sought by state Republicans. Under the court order, <b>absentee</b> <b>ballots</b> were counted in central locations rather than individual precincts. Of the 10,000 <b>absentee</b> <b>ballots</b> {{sent out to}} voters, 6,000 were returned. <b>Absentee</b> <b>ballots</b> mailed within the United States had to be received by April 7 to be counted. The deadline for overseas (including military) ballots was extended to April 13 after the United States Department of Justice sued the state to ensure {{they would have a}} reasonable chance of being counted. Counting of the <b>absentee</b> <b>ballots</b> due by April 7 began on April 8 under a New York State Supreme Court ruling sought by Murphy's campaign.|$|E

5|$|Rice {{worked with}} fellow {{military}} officer and state senator Steve Ward on several {{pieces of legislation}} during his first term in the legislature. Rice sponsored legislation to allow military personnel serving overseas to apply for <b>absentee</b> <b>ballots</b> electronically; Ward was the Senate sponsor. Following the 2007 session, Rice and Ward called for Colorado to divest state pension funds from companies doing business in Iran.|$|E
5000|$|States {{typically}} {{require that}} a voter fill out an application {{to receive an}} <b>absentee</b> <b>ballot.</b> Many states help facilitate this process by making <b>absentee</b> <b>ballot</b> applications available online for voters to print and send, and at least five states (Florida, Louisiana, Maryland, Minnesota and Utah) permit a voter to submit an application entirely online. Arizona has some counties that have online <b>absentee</b> <b>ballot</b> applications, and in Detroit, Michigan, voters can request an <b>absentee</b> <b>ballot</b> through a smartphone app.While all states offer some version of absentee voting, {{there is quite a}} lot of variation in states' procedures. For instance, some states offer [...] "no-excuse" [...] absentee voting, allowing any registered voter to request an absentee without requiring that the voter state a reason for his/her desire to vote absentee. Some states also allow a time period before the election for voters to appear at the elections office or other designated location in person to request, fill out and cast an <b>absentee</b> <b>ballot</b> in on stop. Still other states permit voters to vote absentee only under a limited set of circumstances.|$|R

5|$|The {{legality}} of about 600 <b>absentee</b> <b>ballots</b> were contested during the count, including Senator Gillibrand's ballot. By April 23, Murphy was ahead by 401 votes, and Tedisco conceded the following day. Murphy {{was sworn in}} on April 29. The official results came out in May and had Murphy winning the election with 80,833 votes (50.23%) against Tedisco's 80,107 votes (49.77%).|$|E
5|$|On January 6, 2009, Coleman's {{campaign}} {{filed an}} election contest, {{which led to}} a trial before a three-judge panel. The trial ended on April 7, when the panel ruled that 351 of 387 disputed <b>absentee</b> <b>ballots</b> were incorrectly rejected and ordered them counted. Counting those ballots raised Franken's lead to 312 votes. Coleman appealed to the Minnesota Supreme Court on April 20. On April 24, the Minnesota Supreme Court agreed to hear the case. Oral arguments were conducted on June 1.|$|E
5|$|The {{race was}} so close that one early vote count had the {{candidates}} tied at 77,225 votes each. <b>Absentee</b> <b>ballots</b> decided the election; ballots were accepted until April 13. While Tedisco had been ahead in early counts, by April 10 Murphy was leading, and by April 23 Murphy had a 401-vote advantage. Tedisco conceded the race the following day, and Murphy was sworn in on April 29. Democratic electoral successes in November 2008 and Murphy's clear support of the stimulus package were credited for his success.|$|E

5|$|In 1967, Morton Blackwell, then a field {{representative}} for the CRNC to Kentucky, developed many of the principles now used by the College Republicans. As the college organizer supporting Louie Nunn's campaign for Governor of Kentucky, Blackwell organized approximately 5,000 college student volunteers who dropped 93,000 pieces of literature, posted 20,000 flyers, mailed 15,000 hand-addressed and signed postcards to friends of known student supporters of Nunn, and processed over 8,000 <b>absentee</b> <b>ballots.</b> On election day, Nunn became the first Republican Governor of Kentucky in 20 years. The New York Times and Louie Nunn himself credited the efforts of Blackwell's volunteers.|$|E
5|$|In {{both the}} 2008 and 2006 United States House of Representatives elections, Kilroy was {{involved}} in close elections for Ohio's 15th congressional district. She lost in 2006 after an election that required the counting of <b>absentee</b> <b>ballots</b> and election recounts. However, after the incumbent retired, she won a similarly close election in 2008. In both cases, she was behind after the Election Day vote tabulations, but made up significant ground with belated absentee ballot voting results. The 2010 election race was widely followed in the mainstream press as a race that the Republicans were targeting.|$|E
5|$|Eric Sundwall, Chair of the New York Libertarian Party, was the Libertarian {{candidate}} for the seat. However, he {{was removed from the}} ballot on March 25, after 3,786 of the 6,730 signatures his campaign had collected were ruled invalid. Under state election law, independent congressional candidates must collect at least 3,500 valid signatures to be on the ballot. Two Saratoga County residents challenged over 6,000 of Sundwall's signatures; Sundwall blamed Tedisco for the effort to have him removed from the ballot. The vast majority of the rejected signatures were from voters who put down their mailing address instead of the municipality in which they physically lived. Votes for Sundwall on <b>absentee</b> <b>ballots,</b> which were mailed out before he was removed from the ballot, were voided. On March 27, Sundwall announced that he would vote for Murphy in the election and urged his supporters to join him.|$|E
50|$|Additionally, the FWAB {{should be}} {{accepted}} simultaneously as a voter registration application, <b>absentee</b> <b>ballot</b> request, and <b>absentee</b> <b>ballot.</b> This provision will allow this highly mobile population {{to participate in}} elections far in advance of a deployment, reassignment, or move. FVAP has recommended a new policy that the FWAB be the only write-in ballot used for Uniformed Services and overseas voters; the authorization and use of both a FWAB and a State Write-In <b>Absentee</b> <b>Ballot</b> introduces greater complexity and opportunity for error for Uniformed Services and overseas voters. Using the single FWAB will allow future technological solutions by FVAP to incorporate state and local races into online FWAB solutions, further extending this franchise opportunity.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Absentee</b> <b>balloting</b> {{started in}} Thailand {{first time in}} the 2000 general election. It is promulgated {{according}} to a provision in the 1997 constitution. The <b>absentee</b> <b>ballot</b> can be cast within Thailand and in foreign countries, where Thailand has diplomatic missions. Voters can cast the <b>absentee</b> <b>ballot</b> in 2 cases: (1) those who have their household registration in their constituency but will not be at their constituency on the election day, and wish to cast their vote in advance; and (2) those who physically reside in other locations out of their constituency at least 90 days prior to the election day, and {{will not be able to}} travel back to their constituency on the election day.|$|R

5|$|With 100 {{percent of}} precincts reporting, initial counts from the {{election}} had Murphy leading by about 60 votes out of over 150,000 cast. Columbia County's Board of Elections amended its tally the following day, reducing Murphy's lead to 25 votes. The lead alternated {{between the two}} candidates throughout early recanvassing; {{at one point the}} New York State Board of Elections had listed the election at a zero-vote margin, with each candidate having exactly 77,225 votes. By April 2, Tedisco was ahead by 12 votes. He resigned the position of Assembly Minority Leader on April 5 in preparation for a transition to Congress, and was replaced by Brian Kolb the following day. On April 7, Tedisco was ahead by 97 votes. The close tally meant that <b>absentee</b> <b>ballots</b> would decide the race.|$|E
5|$|The {{candidates}} {{appeared in}} televised debates {{during which they}} discussed various topics. One of them were the rules governing the voting of non-resident nationals, which had been changed by the National Electoral Commission during the campaign. Before the campaign, non-resident nationals who wanted to cast their votes as <b>absentee</b> <b>ballots</b> had been obliged to request voting materials, but the Commission had introduced a new system in which such materials were sent to all non-residents entered in the electoral register, whether they had asked for them or not. Opposition parties, representing the left-wing of Slovenian politics, disliked this move because the record of voters' addresses was not always reliable, and also because the rules had been changed after the campaign had already started. They particularly opposed the change because voters from abroad seemed to favor right-wing parties, {{so that in the}} event of a very close ballot, votes from non-residents could tip the scale in favour of Peterle.|$|E
5|$|The Croatian Parliament tasked the Croatian State Election Committee with {{referendum}} voting organization, ballot counting, {{and result}} publication. The committee scheduled the referendum vote for 22 January 2012 starting at 07:00 and lasting until 19:00, at regular polling stations in Croatia, in Croatian military units, in Croatian diplomatic missions abroad, on Croatian-flagged vessels and in prisons: 6,750polling stations in all. For the referendum, all polling stations were grouped {{in a single}} district. Voters traveling abroad were permitted {{to vote in the}} Croatian diplomatic missions as with Croatian presidential elections; however, the initial instructions by the Ministry of Public Administration did not allow voters within Croatia who were away from their place of residence to vote in the referendum, nor did it allow <b>absentee</b> <b>ballots.</b> GONG, the Croatian election supervision NGO, requested that the authorities correct this. One restriction was removed by 3 January, when voters were permitted to register to vote in Croatia away from their legal residence. Registration was possible until 7 January, in person, by fax, or by e-mail. When the registration process completed in early January 2012 ahead of the referendum, there were 4,504,686voters in the voter registry (the same one used in parliamentary and presidential elections).|$|E

50|$|In the United States, an <b>absentee</b> <b>ballot</b> is {{a ballot}} that the voter records and casts other than at a {{designated}} polling station on Election Day. Typically these ballots are mailed, though some states provide provisions for emailing ballots, faxing ballots, or delivering them in person to a designated location. Typically a voter must request an <b>absentee</b> <b>ballot</b> {{at least a}} week before the election occurs. Each State's Secretary of State or Director of Elections {{is in charge of the}} election process, including voter registration and <b>absentee</b> <b>ballot</b> requests.
