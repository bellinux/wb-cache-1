40|$|This thesis {{demonstrates}} stochastic modelling {{techniques for}} the quantitative {{evaluation of the}} effects of three different pharmacotherapy protocols of chronic moderate adult asthma on hospital services (emergency room use and hospitalizations). The therapies compared were: (1) inhaled beta 2 -agonist <b>agent</b> <b>and</b> inhaled cromolyn; (2) inhaled beta 2 -agonist <b>agent</b> <b>and</b> an inhaled conticosteroid agent; (3) inhaled beta 2 -agonist <b>agent</b> <b>and</b> sustained-release theophylline. The combined therapy of an inhaled beta 2 -agonist <b>agent</b> <b>and</b> an inhaled corticosteroid agent had the lowest cost-effectiveness ratio of the three treatments indicating it should be the therapy of choice when associated hospital costs are included. Even though the inhaled beta 2 -agonist <b>agent</b> <b>and</b> sustained-release theophylline protocol had the lowest maintenance medication costs, it also had the highest cost-effectiveness ratio, suggesting it is the least desirable therapy when associated hospital services are included in the costs.

Some of the chemicals will need to be transported along the highway between Damascus and Homs, which is still contested as of December 2013. Syria has requested the international community provide armored vehicles to assist in safe transport of the chemicals.
