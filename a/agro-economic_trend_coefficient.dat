40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} test for the correct {{specification}} of a dynamic time-series model that is taken to be stationary about a deterministic linear trend function {{with no more than}} a finite number of discontinuities in the vector of <b>trend</b> <b>coefficients.</b> The test avoids the consideration of explicit alternatives to the null of trend stability. The proposal also does not involve the de-tailed modelling of the data-generating process of the stochastic component, which is simply assumed to satisfy a certain strong invariance principle for stationary causal processes taking a general form. As such, the resulting in-ference procedure is effectively an omnibus specification test for segmented linear trend stationarity. The test is of Wald-type, and is based on an asymp-totically linear estimator of the vector of total-variation norms of the trend parameters whose influence function coincides with the efficient influence function. Simulations illustrate the utility of this procedure to detect discrete breaks or continuous variation in the trend parameter as well as alternatives where the <b>trend</b> <b>coefficients</b> change randomly each period.

40|$|A {{univariate}} {{autoregressive process}} of order p with deterministic mean function and a root close to {{or equal to}} one in absolute value is studied. We assume that if the absolute value of the largest root is one then the root is a real root. The approximate bias of {{the sum of the}} autoregressive coefficients is expressed {{as a function of the}} test for a unit root. The expression is used to modify the ordinary least squares estimator of the coefficients of the autoregression to obtain an estimator with finite sample bias that is of smaller order than that of the ordinary least squares estimator. The performance of the proposed estimator is evaluated through Monte Carlo simulation. Monte Carlo results are given for autoregressive processes with constant mean and autoregressive processes with a linear trend;The second problem studied is that of estimation and inference for the <b>trend</b> <b>coefficient</b> in a linear trend model with autoregressive errors. Different feasible generalized least squares estimators of the <b>trend</b> <b>coefficient</b> are compared via simulation. A test statistic for the hypothesis that the <b>trend</b> <b>coefficient</b> is zero is suggested.

The underlying statistics depends on the deviation of the local time estimator from the invariant density with parameter replaced by the maximum likelihood estimator.

40|$|Though {{the least}} squares {{technique}} has many advantages, its possible limitations as {{applied in the}} atmospheric sciences {{have not yet been}} fully explored in the literature. The assumption that the atmosphere responds either in phase or out of phase to the solar input is ubiquitous. However, our analysis found this assumption to be incorrect. If not properly addressed, the possible consequences are bias in the linear <b>trend</b> <b>coefficient</b> and attenuation of the solar response coefficient. Using USU Rayleigh lidar temperature data, we found a significant phase offset to the solar input in the temperatures that varies ± 5 years depending on altitude. In addition to introducing a phase offset into the linear regression model, we argue that separating what we identify as the solar-noise is to be preferred because (1) the solar-noise can contain important physical information, (2) its omission could lead to spurious conclusions about the significance of the solar-proxy coefficient, and (3) its omission could also bias the solar proxy coefficient. We also argue that the Mt. Pinatubo eruption caused a positive temperature perturbation in our early mesopause temperatures, exerting leverage on the linear <b>trend</b> <b>coefficient.</b> In the upper mesosphere, we found a linear cooling trend of greater than - 1. 5 K/year, which is possibly exaggerated because of leverage from the earlier temperatures and/or collinearity. In the middle mesosphere we found a cooling trend of - 1 K/year to near zero. We use the autocorrelation coefficient of the model residuals as a physical parameter. The autocorrelation can provide information about how strongly current temperatures are affected by prior temperatures or how quickly a physical process is occurring. The amplitudes and phases of the annual oscillation in our data compare favorably with those from the OHP and CEL French lidars, as well has the HALOE satellite instrument measurements.
