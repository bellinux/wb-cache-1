5|$|<b>Acetylsalicylic</b> <b>acid</b> is a weak acid, {{and very}} little of it is ionized in the stomach after oral administration. <b>Acetylsalicylic</b> <b>acid</b> is quickly absorbed through the cell {{membrane}} in the acidic conditions of the stomach. The increased pH and larger surface area of the small intestine causes aspirin to be absorbed more slowly there, as more of it is ionised. Owing {{to the formation of}} concretions, aspirin is absorbed much more slowly during overdose, and plasma concentrations can continue to rise for up to 24 hours after ingestion.|$|E
5|$|Aspirin, in {{the form}} of leaves from the willow tree, has been used for its health effects for at least 2,400 years. In 1853, chemist Charles Frédéric Gerhardt treated sodium {{salicylate}} with acetyl chloride to produce <b>acetylsalicylic</b> <b>acid</b> for the first time. In {{the second half of the}} nineteenth century, other chemists established the chemical structure and came up with more efficient methods to make it. In 1897, scientists at Bayer began studying <b>acetylsalicylic</b> <b>acid</b> as a less-irritating replacement for common salicylate medicines. By 1899, Bayer had named the drug Aspirin and was selling it around the world. The word Aspirin was Bayer's brand name; however, their rights to the trademark were lost or sold in many countries. Aspirin's popularity grew over the first half of the twentieth century leading to competition between many brands and formulations.|$|E
5|$|In 1853, chemist Charles Frédéric Gerhardt treated acetyl {{chloride}} with sodium salicylate to produce <b>acetylsalicylic</b> <b>acid</b> {{for the first}} time; {{in the second half}} of the nineteenth century, other academic chemists established the compound's chemical structure and devised more efficient methods of synthesis. In 1897, scientists at the drug and dye firm Bayer began investigating <b>acetylsalicylic</b> <b>acid</b> as a less-irritating replacement for standard common salicylate medicines, and identified a new way to synthesize it. By 1899, Bayer had dubbed this drug Aspirin and was selling it around the world. The word Aspirin was Bayer's brand name, rather than the generic name of the drug; however, Bayer's rights to the trademark were lost or sold in many countries. Aspirin's popularity grew over the first half of the twentieth century leading to fierce competition with the proliferation of aspirin brands and products.|$|E
5|$|Diuretics {{have been}} {{associated}} with attacks of gout. However, a low dose of hydrochlorothiazide does not seem to increase risk. Other medications that increase the risk include niacin, aspirin (<b>acetylsalicylic</b> <b>acid),</b> ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (except losartan), beta blockers, ritonavir, and pyrazinamide. The immunosuppressive drugs ciclosporin and tacrolimus are also associated with gout, the former more so when used in combination with hydrochlorothiazide.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{taking control}} of Bayer's overall {{management}} in 1890, Duisberg began to expand the company's drug research program. He created a pharmaceutical group for creating new drugs, headed by former university chemist Arthur Eichengrün, and a pharmacology group for testing the drugs, headed by Heinrich Dreser (beginning in 1897, after periods under Wilhelm Siebel and Hermann Hildebrandt). In 1894, the young chemist Felix Hoffmann joined the pharmaceutical group. Dreser, Eichengrün and Hoffmann would be the key figures {{in the development of}} <b>acetylsalicylic</b> <b>acid</b> as the drug Aspirin (though their respective roles {{have been the subject of}} some contention).|$|E
5|$|Aspirin, {{also known}} as <b>acetylsalicylic</b> <b>acid</b> (ASA), is a {{medication}} used to treat pain, fever, or inflammation. Specific inflammatory conditions in which aspirin is used include Kawasaki disease, pericarditis, and rheumatic fever. Aspirin given shortly {{after a heart attack}} decreases the risk of death. Aspirin is also used long-term to help prevent heart attacks, ischaemic strokes, and blood clots, in people at high risk. Aspirin may also decrease the risk of certain types of cancer, particularly colorectal cancer. For pain or fever, effects typically begin within 30 minutes. Aspirin is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) and works similar to other NSAIDs but also suppresses the normal functioning of platelets.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} aspirin (also known as <b>acetylsalicylic</b> <b>acid</b> or ASA) {{and the medical}} use of it and related {{substances}} stretches back to antiquity, though pure ASA has only been manufactured and marketed since 1899. Medicines made from willow and other salicylate-rich plants appear in clay tablets from ancient Sumer {{as well as the}} Ebers Papyrus from ancient Egypt. Hippocrates referred to their use of salicylic tea to reduce fevers around 400 BC, and were part of the pharmacopoeia of Western medicine in classical antiquity and the Middle Ages. Willow bark extract became recognized for its specific effects on fever, pain and inflammation in the mid-eighteenth century. By the nineteenth century pharmacists were experimenting with and prescribing a variety of chemicals related to salicylic acid, the active component of willow extract.|$|E
25|$|Salicylic acid {{was one of}} the {{original}} starting materials for making <b>acetylsalicylic</b> <b>acid</b> (aspirin) in 1897.|$|E
25|$|It {{can also}} be {{prepared}} by the hydrolysis of aspirin (<b>acetylsalicylic</b> <b>acid)</b> or methyl salicylate (oil of wintergreen) with a strong acid or base.|$|E
25|$|A {{symptomatic}} treatment includes rehydration and pain relief with {{drugs such as}} paracetamol (acetaminophen in the United States). <b>Acetylsalicylic</b> <b>acid</b> (aspirin) should not be given because of its anticoagulant effect, which can be devastating {{in the case of}} internal bleeding that can occur with yellow fever.|$|E
25|$|Codeine is {{not allowed}} without a medical prescription. Codeine is sold under the name Farmacod and its {{concentration}} does not exceed 15mg. There is a known combination of <b>acetylsalicylic</b> <b>acid,</b> paracetamol and codeine phosphate hemihydrate named Aspaco that is allowed without a medical prescription but its case is signed with an exclamation red symbol which means that driving won't be allowed during treatment. There are no sanctions whether the drug is given without a prescription.|$|E
25|$|Salicylic acid has {{the formula}} C6H4(OH)COOH, where the OH group is ortho to the {{carboxyl}} group. It {{is also known}} as 2-hydroxybenzoic acid. It is poorly soluble in water (2 g/L at 20°C). Aspirin (<b>acetylsalicylic</b> <b>acid</b> or ASA) can be prepared by the esterification of the phenolic hydroxyl group of salicylic acid with the acetyl group from acetic anhydride or acetyl chloride. Salicylic acid can also be prepared using the Kolbe-Schmitt reaction.|$|E
25|$|In Sweden {{preparations}} of codeine {{are sold}} by prescription only. It is sold as pure codeine pills of 25mg in bottles of 100 pills approved {{for treatment of}} pain and cough. In combination tablets and suppositories, most commonly Paracetamol, ibuprofen and <b>acetylsalicylic</b> <b>acid</b> for pain. It is also available as parenteral solution in combination with morphine, papaverin, methylscopolamine and noscapine, approved for treatment against pain in gastrointestinal tract and urogenital tract. Most commonly used against pain from stones.|$|E
25|$|As {{indicated}} by its organic chemistry, Ac2O is mainly used for acetylations leading to commercially significant materials. Its largest application {{is for the}} conversion of cellulose to cellulose acetate, which is a component of photographic film and other coated materials, and {{is used in the}} manufacture of cigarette filters. Similarly it is used in the production of aspirin (<b>acetylsalicylic</b> <b>acid),</b> which is prepared by the acetylation of salicylic acid. It is also used as a wood preservative via autoclave impregnation to make a longer-lasting timber.|$|E
25|$|The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the U.S. Surgeon General, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) {{recommend}} that aspirin and combination products containing aspirin {{not be given}} to children under 19 years of age during episodes of fever-causing illnesses. Hence, in the United States, it is advised that the opinion of a doctor or pharmacist should be obtained before anyone under 19 years of age is given any medication containing aspirin (also known on some medicine labels as acetylsalicylate, salicylate, <b>acetylsalicylic</b> <b>acid,</b> ASA, or salicylic acid).|$|E
25|$|Apart {{from the}} {{benefits}} of gas lighting and heating, the process for producing coal gas yielded {{a number of other}} substances which were subsequently successfully exploited. Among these were coke; ammonia; phenol (carbolic acid), a disinfectant and one of the components of bakelite, the first synthetic plastic invented in 1910; and coal tar, which contained a number of organic chemicals. Coal tar was subsequently used to produce the first synthetic dye, mauve, by William Henry Perkin in 1856 and in 1853 was found, by Charles Gerhardt to contain the chemical <b>acetylsalicylic</b> <b>acid,</b> now known as aspirin.|$|E
25|$|Salicylic acid (from Latin salix, willow tree) is a {{lipophilic}} monohydroxybenzoic acid, {{a type of}} phenolic acid, and a beta hydroxy acid (BHA). It has {{the formula}} C7H6O3. This colorless crystalline organic acid is widely used in organic synthesis and functions as a plant hormone. It {{is derived from the}} metabolism of salicin. In addition to serving as an important active metabolite of aspirin (<b>acetylsalicylic</b> <b>acid),</b> which acts in part as a prodrug to salicylic acid, it is probably best known for its use as a key ingredient in topical anti-acne products. The salts and esters of salicylic acid are known as salicylates.|$|E
25|$|Early {{long-term}} higher-dose {{therapy with}} AZT was initially associated with side effects that sometimes limited therapy, including anemia, neutropenia, hepatotoxicity, cardiomyopathy, and myopathy. All {{of these conditions}} were generally found to be reversible upon reduction of AZT dosages. They {{have been attributed to}} several possible causes, including transient depletion of mitochondrial DNA, sensitivity of the γ-DNA polymerase in some cell mitochondria, the depletion of thymidine triphosphate, oxidative stress, reduction of intracellular L-carnitine or apoptosis of the muscle cells. Anemia due to AZT was successfully treated using erythropoetin to stimulate red blood cell production. Drugs that inhibit hepatic glucuronidation, such as indomethacin, nordazepam, <b>acetylsalicylic</b> <b>acid</b> (aspirin) and trimethoprim decreased the elimination rate and increased the therapeutic strength of the medication. Today, side-effects are much less common with the use of lower doses of AZT.|$|E
500|$|In 1853, chemist Charles Frédéric Gerhardt treated acetyl {{chloride}} with sodium salicylate to produce <b>acetylsalicylic</b> <b>acid</b> {{for the first}} time; {{in the second half}} of the nineteenth century, other academic chemists established the compound's chemical structure and devised more efficient methods of synthesis.

500|$|In 1853, Charles Frédéric Gerhardt had {{published}} the first methods to prepare <b>acetylsalicylic</b> <b>acid.</b> [...] In {{the course of}} his work on the synthesis and properties of various acid anhydrides, he mixed acetyl chloride with a sodium salt of salicylic acid (sodium salicylate). A vigorous reaction ensued, and the resulting melt soon solidified. Since no structural theory existed at that time Gerhardt called the compound he obtained [...] "salicylic-acetic anhydride" [...] (wasserfreie Salicylsäure-Essigsäure). When Gerhardt tried to dissolve the solid in a diluted solution of sodium carbonate it immediately decomposed to sodium salts of salicylic and acetic acids. In 1859 an Austrian chemist, Hugo von Gilm, obtained analytically pure <b>acetylsalicylic</b> <b>acid</b> (which he called acetylierte Salicylsäure, acetylated salicylic acid) by a reaction of salicylic acid and acetyl chloride. In 1869 Schröder, Prinzhorn and Kraut repeated both Gerhardt's (from sodium salicylate) and von Gilm's (from salicylic acid) syntheses and concluded that both reactions gave the same compound—acetylsalicylic acid. (Prinzhorn is credited in the paper with conducting the experiments.) They were first to assign to it the correct structure with the acetyl group connected to the phenolic oxygen.|$|E
500|$|Due to {{allowing}} {{the use of}} [...] "Aspirin" [...] for years by other manufacturing chemists, despite the trademark-infringing nature of the use, and its own failure to use the name for its own product when it began selling direct, Bayer lost its trademark in the United States in 1918, affirmed by court appeal in 1921. Today, aspirin is a generic word in Australia, France, India, Ireland, New Zealand, Pakistan, Jamaica, Colombia, the Philippines, South Africa, Ghana, the United Kingdom and the United States. Aspirin, with a capital [...] "A", remains a registered trademark of Bayer in Germany, Canada, Mexico, and in over 80 other countries, where the trademark is owned by Bayer, using <b>acetylsalicylic</b> <b>acid</b> in all markets, but using different packaging and physical aspects for each.|$|E

2500|$|The {{treatment}} of mumps is supportive. Symptoms may be relieved by {{the application of}} intermittent ice or heat to the affected neck/testicular area and by acetaminophen for pain relief. [...] Warm saltwater gargles, soft foods, and extra fluids may also help relieve symptoms. <b>Acetylsalicylic</b> <b>acid</b> (aspirin) is not used to treat children due {{to the risk of}} Reye's syndrome.|$|E
2500|$|In Canada tablets {{containing}} 8mg of codeine {{combined with}} 15mg of caffeine and 300mg of paracetamol are sold as T1s (Tylenol Number 1) without a prescription. A similar tablet called an AC which contains 325mg of <b>acetylsalicylic</b> <b>acid</b> (Aspirin) instead of paracetamol {{is also available}} without a prescription. Both tablets are kept behind the counter and must be dispensed by a pharmacist who may limit quantities. [...] Names of many codeine and dihydrocodeine products in Canada tend to follow the narcotic content number system (Tylenol With Codeine No. 1, 2, 3, 4 [...] ) mentioned below in the section on the United States; {{it came to be}} in its current form with the Pure Food & Drug Act of 1906.|$|E
2500|$|Some of {{the oldest}} natural product based drugs are analgesics. The bark of the willow tree has been known from antiquity to have pain {{relieving}} properties. This is due to presence of the natural product salicin which in turn may be hydrolyzed into salicylic acid. [...] A synthetic derivative <b>acetylsalicylic</b> <b>acid</b> better known as aspirin is a widely used pain reliever. [...] Its mechanism of action is inhibition of the cyclooxygenase (COX) enzyme. Another notable example is opium is extracted from the latex from Papaver somniferous (a flowering poppy plant). The most potent narcotic component of opium is the alkaloid morphine which acts as an opioid receptor agonist. [...] A more recent example is the N-type calcium channel blocker ziconotide analgesic {{which is based on}} a cyclic peptide cone snail toxin (ω-conotoxin MVIIA) from the species Conus magus.|$|E
