Changes in melt pool size vs. distance or time are presented in quasi-nondimensional form, allowing results from simulations spanning the range of practical process parameters to be presented in compact form.

The friction and wear behavior of the specimens from room temperature (R. T.) to 800 degrees C was evaluated using a ball-on-disk tribometer and 3 D white light interference (WLI).

40|$|Todays {{demands on}} silicon nitride based {{materials}} for structural applications focus on microstructures rendering high strengths and reliability at reasonable costs. This work was mainly aimed at production of sialons for {{these types of}} applications by nitridation with subsequent sintering. For this purpose both the influence of different factors on sialon formation {{and the effect of}} additives in nitriding was studied, as well as different sintering methods. Y-alfa-sialons with x= 0. 1 to 0. 9 in the formula Yx(Sil 2 - 4. 5 x,Al 4. 5 x) (01. 5 x,N 16 - 1. 5 x) prepared from silicon nitride powders were sintered in different ways. The crystalline phase composition varied from alfa/beta sialon at x= 0. 2 to alfa sialon at x= 0. 4 and alfa sialon + polytypes at x= 0. 8. The highest alfa-sialon content and density was obtained for x= 0. 4 with an excess of yttria after sintering 1 h at 1750 °C and post HIPing 1 h at 1750 °C and 200 MPa. No glass encapsualtion was needed as closed porosity was obtained in the sintering step. Less residual glass was also present after this processing than when just HIPing. Sintering without pressure, however was not enough to densify the material. Sintering experiments by HT-XRD and in a conventional furnace of an x= 0. 4 alfa-sialon composition without excess yttria, showed that the amount of alfa-sialon formed was relatively insensitive to small changes in composition. Assuming that the formation mechanisms during the early stages of sintering (first 90 - 120 min) did not change with time and temperature, therefore made it possible to determine the kinetics of alfa-sialon formation. The activation energy was estimated as 330 kJ/mol. The effect of additives on nitridation was studied by adding silica or additives for sialon formation (AlN, Al 2 O 3, Y 2 O 3, CaO) to silicon. Formation of silicon oxynitride in the case of silica additions and sialon in the case of sialon additions was then observed after nitriding. The amounts of sialon formed depended on the liquid phase properties of the different compositions and the nitriding conditions. Fast nitridation resulted in more sialon formation. By nitriding with different schedules it was shown that this formation could be controlled and also that the nitridation could be speeded up when additives were present. Large amounts of additives made the pore size distribution insensitive to nitriding gas composition. The presence of hydrogen in the gas, however, did increase the amount of reaction at low temperatures and thereby influenced the phase composition. Densification of the materials nitrided with silica present was not possible by pressureless sintering and standard glass encapsulated HIPing. Most of the nitrided sialon compositions, on the other hand, sintered well by most sintering methods used at temperatures of 1850 °C, and resulted in homogeneous microstructures. Sinter HIPing rendered unusually elongated grains in the (alfa-sialon (x= 0. 4), while the beta-sialon (z= 2) had high grain aspect ratios for all sintering methods. HIPing at 1750 °C gave the highest densities in most cases but resulted in inhomogeneities in the alfa-sialon. These looked very similar to inhomogeneities obtained when AlN <b>additive</b> <b>powder</b> with larger grain sizes was used. This work shows that nitridation with subsequent sintering of sialon compositions is a very promising way of manufacturing high performance structural ceramics based on silicon nitride.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The modular system for deposition welding on inner surfaces of workpieces with a laser beam (1), comprises a supply for <b>powdered</b> <b>additive</b> material, a supply for protective gas and a coolant, and a coupling module (2), a laser beam guiding module (5) and a processing module (6), which are connectable with one another. A collimated laser beam is directed to an optical element (4) focusing {{the surface of the}} workpiece to be processed over the coupling module through the laser beam guiding module. A nozzle (7) with a discharge opening for the laser beam and the protective gas and a channel with a discharge opening for the <b>powdered</b> <b>additive</b> material are present at the processing module, where the channel is aligned to the nozzle at an angle, so that the <b>powdered</b> <b>additive</b> material impinges {{on the surface of the}} workpiece to be processed in a focal spot of the laser beam. The discharge openings of the channel for the <b>powdered</b> <b>additive</b> material are arranged to each other at equal angle distances. The beam guiding module and the processing module are connectable with an extension module. The connections for the supply of protective gas, <b>powdered</b> <b>additive</b> material and coolant are present at the coupling module, extension module and/or beam guiding module and channels for <b>powdered</b> <b>additive</b> material are guided through the beam guiding module and the processing module, where the protective gas is guided to the discharge opening of the nozzle and the <b>powdered</b> <b>additive</b> material is guided up to the channels of the nozzle. An element reflecting the laser beam is present in the processing module, where the laser beam is deflected on the surface of the workpiece with the element over the discharge opening of the nozzle. The protective gas is disposed between the discharge opening of the nozzle and the reflecting element within the processing module, and is held in a retaining element, which is detachably connected with the processing module, using two frame elements that are pivoted around a rotating axis. The element focusing the laser beam is incorporated in the beam guiding module and/or the extension module. A focal length of the focusing element is changeable. The laser beam is focused with the reflecting element arranged in the processing module. A connection and a channel through the beam guiding module and the extension module are arranged to each channel for the additive material present in the processing module and the nozzle. A supporting element is arranged at the beam guiding module and/or extension module, and is formed by a rotatably mounted bead, roller or wheel. Nozzles or parts of the nozzle, with which the channels for the additive material are inclined at different angles, are exchangeably fastened at the processing module. The system is movable with the processing module and/or the workpiece relative to each other in two axes. The protective gas is directly guided into the beam guiding module, extension module or the processing module above or below the element focusing the laser beam. The protective gas is guided at the reflecting element in the processing module and through the discharge opening for the laser beam. A two-dimensional cross-table is arranged at the coupling module for the adjustment of the laser beam. The coolant is guided into the processing module through the channel over the beam guiding module for cooling the reflecting element and/or the nozzle. The rear side of the reflecting element is indirectly cooled with the coolant. The coolant is guided for cooling the nozzle in an adapter element at the processing module. USE - Modular system for deposition welding on inner surfaces of workpieces with a laser beam. ADVANTAGE - The modular system ensures precise, safe and simple deposition welding on the inner surfaces of the workpieces with high quality, high flexibility and high efficiency...|$|R
40|$|Additive Manufacturing {{is one of}} {{the genuine}} hopes for the forth {{industrial}} revolution since digital data is controlling the whole layered production process. At the same time the geometric freedom and tool-free production assures a high degree of individualisation. But to be the driving force behind a new industrial revolution, a qualification of additive manufacturing processes is necessary so that the resulting products meet the required quality and safety standards in the different fields of application such as in handling technology or medical technology. This paper will discuss a conceptual approach for the development of an in-line quality control system in <b>Additive</b> Manufacturing <b>Powder</b> Bed Fusion processes using the example of the Selective Laser Sintering process...|$|R
