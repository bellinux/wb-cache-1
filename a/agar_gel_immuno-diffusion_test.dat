40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to describe the serological prevalence of maedi-visna in a sample of Ontario sheep flocks, and to identify management and demographic variables that were associated with seroprevalence for maedi-visna. A sample of 103 sheep flocks in Ontario was randomly selected from those flocks participating in the Red Meat Plan. The owners of these flocks were surveyed regarding management procedures on their farms, and blood samples were taken from a random sample of ewes in each flock. At least one ewe tested serologically positive, based on the <b>agar</b> <b>gel</b> <b>immuno-diffusion</b> <b>test,</b> in 69. 9 % of the farms. Positive serological reactions occurred in 20. 9 % of the 3880 sheep tested. Flock demographics and farm management variables were considered in a multiple regression model, and several factors were positively associated with higher maedi-visna seroprevalence rates. These included {{the average age of the}} flock, the number of years the owner had been sheep farming, the practice of using foster ewes, the practice of allowing lambs to have contact with other ewes that are lambing, and the average pasture acreage per ewe...|$|E

The present study was conducted to investigate the prevalence of this health problem in Kassala State during the period. To determine the prevalence of SP in this area of Sudan, both participatory epidemiological approaches and serological survey among sheep populations in the various localities of the state were employed. Questionnaire survey among sheep herders and veterinary records consultations in the state were carried out. Serologically, <b>Agar</b> <b>Gel</b> <b>Immuno-diffusion</b> <b>Test</b> (AGIDT) was used to detect antibody (Ab) levels in sera of non-vaccinated sheep. The questionnaire survey outcome showed that most of sheep owners have a good knowledge about SP as an enzootic disease in the state, with 80 % of the owners confirming the presence of the disease in their sheep herds. Fifteen outbreaks of SP were reported in the state for the last five years. Out of the 502 serum samples tested, 63. 55 % were positive for Abs against SP virus (SPV). High prevalence was recorded from Algash locality (69. 57 %, n= 115), followed by Kassala locality (66. 89 %, n= 151), Nahr Atbara locality (63. 79 %, n= 116) and Setiet locality (53. 33 %, n= 120). Risk factors analysis with respect to age groups and sex of sampled animals showed no statistical significance between disease prevalence and age or sex (χ²= 2. 3751, P-value= 0. 498 and χ²= 0. 2039, P-value= 0. 652, respectively. However, the high prevalence was observed in female animals (64. 05 %, n= 253) and the age group of less than one- year- old (65. 63 %, n= 233). In conclusion, our findings elucidated the prevalence of the disease in that endemic area, using participatory epidemiological approaches. It is recommended that strategic control programs should be designed and applied to address the health problem imposed by sheeppox among the sheep population in the Eastern states of Sudan...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was {{isolation}} and identification of bacteria associated with bovine mastitis and detection of their specific antibodies in milk and sera. A total of 50 samples of milk and sera was collected from cows with clinical and subclinical mastitis in two different farms in Khartoum State (Alsalama, Khartoum and Shambat, Khartoum North). The samples were collected between December 2009 and June 2010. The bacteria were isolated from 38 (76 %) of the milk samples, and the total number of isolates was 45 with 3 yeasts. Sixteen (36 %) bacterial isolates were obtained from cows with clinical mastitis, whereas 29 (64 %) bacterial isolates were obtained from cows with sub-clinical mastitis. Mixed infection was detected in 10 (20 %) of the milk samples. Both Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria were isolatedand identified to the species level, using cultural characteristics and biochemical tests. Most isolates (27) were Staphylococcus species all of them were coagulase positive (10 were Staph. aureus, 9 Staph. hyicusand 8 Staph. intermedius), other gram positive bacteria isolates were one isoloates of Streptococcus agalactiae, two of Enterococcus species (one was avium, two mundtiiand one was faecium), Listeria Ivanoviiwere two, Bacillus species three (two Bacillus licheniformisand one B. mycoides), and three strains of Corynebactrium psedotuberculosis. The gram negative bacterial isolates were three Enterobacteriaspecies (two Citrobacter freundiand one Klebsiella pneumoniae). And Pseudomonas aeruginosaconsistedof two strains. Agar double diffusion test was performed to detect antibodies specific to the causative agents of mastitis in milkimmunoglobulin fraction and serum collected from each cow against the whole-cell lysate (WCL) of the isolates. Only Bacillus mycoidesgave clear precipitation lines with both milk immunoglobulin fraction and serum. Other bacteria gave precipitation lines with serum antibodies alone. The resultsrevealed that the Gram positive bacteria, especially Staphylococcusspecies, were the common causative agent of bovine mastitis; the number ofcows with subclinical mastitis was higher than cows with clinical mastitis. The bacteriaassociated with bovine mastitis can induce local and systemic specific antibodies response as measured by <b>agar</b> <b>gel</b> <b>immuno-diffusion</b> <b>test...</b>|$|E

The objective {{of this study was}} to determine the prevalence of anti-Leptospira and anti-Brucella ovis antibodies in small ruminants sold at an animal fair in the Sertão region of the Pernambuco State, Northeastern Brazil, and to identify the possible risk factors associated with seropositivity. Serum samples were collected from 233 goats and 119 sheep, belonging to twelve different owners from November 2014 to June 2015. Diagnosis of Leptospira spp. infection was established using the microscopic agglutination test (MAT); for B. ovis infection, the <b>agar</b> <b>gel</b> <b>immuno-diffusion</b> (AGID) <b>test</b> was conducted. A total of 16 / 233 (6. 87 %; 95 % CI = 4. 27 % – 10. 83 %) goats and 16 / 119 (13. 45 %; 95 % CI = 8. 67 % – 21. 24 %) sheep were identified as seropositive for Leptospira spp. The most frequent serotype was Icterohaemorrhagiae. In goats, intensive management system (odds ratio = 15. 8; p < 0. 001) and consorted rearing of equines and goats (odds ratio = 7. 3; p = 0. 005) were identified as risk factors. There were no risk factors identified for sheep. Seven (5. 88 %; 95 % CI = 2. 88 % – 11. 65 %) sheep were seropositive for B. ovis, and the intensive management system was identified as the risk factor (odds ratio = 11. 5; p = 0. 005). This suggests that Leptospira spp. and B. ovis infections occur in small ruminants commercialized in the Sertão region of the Pernambuco State.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{determine}} the situation of sheeppox (SP) in Kassala State, Sudan. Three methods were adopted to achieve the fore-mentioned goal. These methods were questionnaire survey, collection of available data from veterinary services records and detection of antibodies against sheeppox virus (SPV) in the serum samples collected from different localities of the state using <b>agar</b> <b>gel</b> <b>immuno-diffusion</b> (AGID) <b>test.</b> The questionnaire survey outcomes showed that most of the sheep owners have a good knowledge about SP as an epizootic disease in the state. Moreover, 80 % of the owners confirmed the presence of the disease in their sheep flocks. Thus, the disease represents a real problem for the sheep owners in the state. From the previously reported outbreaks of SP, which obtained from the veterinary services records, the control of the disease can be achieved easily by means of vaccination which is possible in the state. In addition, the good infrastructure of the veterinary services in Kassala state may help and push the control program of the disease towards sunlight. Out of the 502 serum samples, collected from both sexes of sheep, four age groups (1 - 12, 13 - 24, 25 - 36, 37 - 48 months) and two production system settled and nomad, were tested using AGID test, 319 (63. 55 %) of them were positive by the test, whereas 183 (36. 45 %) were negative. High prevalence of antibodies against SPV was in samples from Algash locality (69. 57 %, n= 115) followed by Kassala locality (66. 89 %, n= 151), Nahr Atbara locality (63. 79 %, n= 116) and Setiet locality (53. 33 %, n= 120). Results of risk factors analysis with respect to age groups and sex of sampled animals revealed no statistical significance between disease prevalence and age and sex (χ²= 2. 3751, P-value= 0. 498) and (χ²= 0. 2039, P-value= 0. 652), respectively. However, the highest level of the prevalence was observed in females (64. 05 %, n= 253) and the age less than one year (65. 63 %, n= 233). VIII In conclusion, the findings obtained imply SP is widely distributed in Kassala state localities. It can also be concluded that AGID test is a reliable test to be applied for the detection of SP antibodies under Sudan condition. However, the need for further investigations using more advanced techniques is recommended...|$|R
40|$|A {{total of}} 256 sera {{collected}} from three species of domesticated equidae in four different Spanish provinces were examined 1 - 4 {{months after the}} administration of attenuated monovalent African horse sickness virus (AHSV) serotype 4 vaccine. Approximately 10 % of the sera were negative by ELISA, virus neutralization, <b>agar</b> <b>gel</b> <b>immuno-diffusion</b> and complement fixation tests. Similar negative reactions were recorded with sera from two ponies after experimental primary vaccination. The rapid rise in antibodies in sera from these two ponies, after a second dose of vaccine, suggested they {{would probably have been}} immune to challenge. It is therefore suggested that the apparent absence of antibodies against AHSV in some animals after primary vaccination may not necessarily indicate a total lack of protection...|$|R

Here, we surveyed the serotype prevalence of Chinese H. parasuis isolates using traditional serotyping (<b>gel</b> <b>immuno-diffusion</b> <b>test,</b> GID) and molecular serotyping (multiplex PCR, mPCR). We also investigated why discrepant results between these methods were obtained, and investigated mPCR failure through whole-genome sequencing. Of the 100 isolate tested, 73 (73 %) and 93 (93 %) were serotyped by the GID test and mPCR, respectively, with a concordance rate of 66 % (66 / 100). Additionally, mPCR {{reduced the number}} of NT isolates from 27 (27 %) for the GID testing, to seven (7 %). Eleven isolates were sequenced, including nine serotype-discrepant isolates from mPCR and GID typing (excluding strains that were NT by GID only) and two NT isolates from both methods, and their in silico serotypes were obtained from genome sequencing based on their capsule loci. The mPCR results were supported by the in silico serotyping of the seven serotype-discrepant isolates. The discrepant results and NT isolates determined by mPCR were attributed to deletions and unknown sequences in the serotype-specific region of each capsule locus. Compared with previous investigations, this study found a similar predominant serotype profile, but a different prevalence frequency for H. parasuis, and the five most prevalent serotypes or strain groups were serotypes 5, 4, NT, 7 and 13 for mPCR, and serotypes 5, NT, 4, 7 and 13 / 10 / 14 for GID.

Time courses of plasma level and <b>agar</b> <b>gel</b> amount were measured after topical application of 50 % ANP, 3 % LC, 1 % PXC and 1 % FP in hydroxypropylcellulose gel. Percutaneous absorption clearance of unionized from, CL*ab was proportional to true octanol/water distribution coefficient and the order of FP>PXC>LC>ANP, suggesting that permeation of the drug was determined mainly by its distribution from the formulation to the skin barrier. PXC, however, had a relatively low flux compared to the other three drugs, probably due to its high molecular weight and meltiong point. Migration clearance of unionized form from systemic cirsulation to the subcutaneous <b>agar</b> <b>gel,</b> CL*g was also influenced by the lipophilicity of drugs. On the other hand, fraction from the formulation to the systemic circulation was in the order of PXC>FP>ANP>LC. This fraction was much higher than the direct migration fraction from the formulation to the subcutaneous <b>agar</b> <b>gel.</b> Factors determining for these fractions are still unclear. A drug having a low lipophilicity and a low prorein binding, however, had a tendency to have a great targeting ability to the subcutaneous <b>agar</b> <b>gel.</b> In addition, most of the drug in the <b>agar</b> <b>gel</b> was contributed by the direct flow from formulation, not from the systemic circulation. The present in situ experimental method is a useful tool to evaluate skin disposition of drugs. Detailed understanding of the skin disposition of drugs from several formulations will enable the finding of a good drug and formulation candidates...|$|R

40|$|A {{sensitive}} specific {{enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay}} utilizing purified p 26 antigen {{was developed}} {{for the detection of}} antibodies to equine infectious anemia virus in naturally and experimentally infected horses. Generally, antibodies to the virus could be detected by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3 to 4 days earlier than by the standard <b>agar</b> <b>gel</b> immunodiffusion test, and they could be detected more reliably in horses with weak or equivocal <b>agar</b> <b>gel</b> immunodiffusion test reactions. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was also successfully applied to the detection of p 26 antigen in tissue culture fluids...|$|R
40|$|Specimens of the Ommastrephid squid Illex illecebrosus illecebrosus LeSueur were {{captured}} at two locations on the Avalon Peninsula {{of the island}} of Newfoundland, from July to October, 1966. A blood sample was obtained {{from each of the}} more than 400 specimens immediately upon capture. The blood samples were each centrifuged in the laboratory to remove cellular materials, and the plasma samples thereby obtained were stored at - 20 °C. Samples of this plasma were examined refractometrically for total protein content and subjected to electrophoretic analyses on a cellulose acetate medium. Antiserum to squid plasma was raised in a rabbit, and <b>immuno-diffusion</b> <b>tests</b> were carried out, also on cellulose acetate. The total protein values obtained ranged from 11. 30 to 14. 50 g/ 100 ml of plasma, the average being 12. 76 g/ 100 ml. The electrophoretic analyses revealed two closely associated protein components, at least one of which {{is believed to be the}} proteinaceous part of the respiratory pigment, hemocyanin. The <b>immuno-diffusion</b> <b>tests</b> indicated the presence in the blood plasma of the squid of at least one antigenic component, probably hemocyanin...|$|R
