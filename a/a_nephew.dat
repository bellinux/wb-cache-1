5|$|Alexander was <b>a</b> <b>nephew</b> of Roger, Bishop of Salisbury, {{probably}} {{the son of}} Roger's brother Humphrey. His mother's name, Ada, is known from the Lincoln Cathedral libri memoriales, or obituary books. Alexander's brother David was archdeacon of Buckingham in the diocese of Lincoln. Other relatives included Nigel, another nephew of Roger's; and Adelelm, later Treasurer of England, who was recorded as Roger's nephew but perhaps was his son. It is possible, although unproven, that Nigel was really Alexander's brother rather than his cousin. Roger's son Roger le Poer, who later became Chancellor of England, was also a cousin. Alexander's cousin Nigel had a son, Richard FitzNeal, who later became Treasurer of England and Bishop of London. Alexander also had <b>a</b> <b>nephew</b> William, who became an archdeacon, and a great-nephew named Robert de Alvers.|$|E

5|$|After Elliott Fitch Shepard's {{death in}} March 1893, Margaret donated the present church {{building}} and manse. The Spanish Renaissance-style church {{was designed by}} Augustus Haydel (<b>a</b> <b>nephew</b> of Stanford White) and August D. Shepard (<b>a</b> <b>nephew</b> of Elliott Shepard and of William Rutherford Mead). The two nephews later designed the 1899 Fabbri Mansion in Manhattan. The church's cornerstone was laid on October 13, 1893. During construction of the building's foundation, workers found quicksand, though Shepard was intent on constructing the church there and had the construction workers dig 30 feet into the ground to find firm ground for the foundation. European workers {{were brought to the}} site to aide in the building's construction. The Italian Renaissance Revival building was of limestone delivered from Indiana by railroad, requiring a special track laid at Scarborough to accommodate the delivery. The completed church was dedicated on May 11, 1895 in memory of Elliott Fitch Shepard. It was briefly known as Shepard Memorial Church. The dedication was attended by Cornelius Vanderbilt II, Frederick W. Vanderbilt, Chauncey Depew, William Sloane of W. & J. Sloane, William Seward Webb, H. Walter Webb, and James A. Burden II.|$|E

5|$|However, even {{following}} Romanum decet pontificem, {{only three}} of the eight Popes of the 18th century failed to make <b>a</b> <b>nephew</b> or brother cardinal. The College of Cardinals apparently preferred rule by nephews than by favorites, which they perceived as the alternative; for example, the College urged Pope Benedict XIII (1724–1730) to appoint a cardinal-nephew, who they hoped would replace Benedict XIII's notorious lieutenant Niccolò Coscia. Pope Gregory XIII (1572–1585) also had to be urged by key figures in the College to appoint his cardinal-nephew: Filippo Boncompagni.|$|E
