5|$|The energy {{provided}} by tidal flexing drives active geological processes within Europa's interior, {{just as they}} do to a far more obvious degree on its sister moon Io. Although Europa, like the Earth, may possess an internal energy source from radioactive decay, the energy generated by tidal flexing would be several orders of magnitude greater than any radiological source. Life on Europa could exist clustered around hydrothermal vents on the ocean floor, or below the ocean floor, where endoliths are known to inhabit on Earth. Alternatively, it could exist clinging to the lower surface of Europa's ice layer, much like algae and bacteria in Earth's polar regions, or float freely in Europa's ocean. If Europa's ocean is too cold, biological processes similar to those known on Earth could not take place. If it is too salty, only extreme halophiles could survive in that environment. In 2010, a model proposed by Richard Greenberg of the University of Arizona proposed that irradiation of ice on Europa's surface could saturate its crust with oxygen and peroxide, which could then be transported via tectonic processes into the interior ocean. Such a process could render Europa's ocean as oxygenated <b>as</b> <b>our</b> <b>own</b> within just 12 million years, allowing for the existence of complex, multicellular lifeforms.|$|E
25|$|Hume {{also points}} out {{there is still a}} {{possibility}} that the universe could have been created by random chance but still show evidence of design as the universe is eternal and would have an infinite amount of time to be able to form a universe so complex and ordered <b>as</b> <b>our</b> <b>own.</b> He called that the 'Epicurean hypothesis'. It argued that when the universe was first created, the universe was random and chaotic, but if the universe is eternal, over an unlimited period of time, natural forces could have naturally 'evolved' by random particles coming together over time into the incredibly ordered system we can observe today without the need of an intelligent designer as an explanation.|$|E
25|$|Lloyd George wanted Russia {{persuaded to}} make the maximum {{possible}} effort, a necessity again stressed at the second Chantilly Conference in December 1916. Wilson was sent as Senior Military Representative (Robertson had refused to go) on a British mission to Russia in January 1917 (delayed from November 1916), the object of which {{was to keep the}} Russians holding down at least the forces now opposite them, to boost Russian morale and see what equipment they needed with a view to coordinating attacks. The party of 50 included British (led by Milner and including a banker and two munitions experts), French (led by de Castelnau) and Italian delegations. The War Office briefing advised that Russia was close to revolution. Wilson met the Tsar but thought him “as devoid of character & purpose <b>as</b> <b>our</b> <b>own</b> poor miserable King”. Even senior Russian officials were talking openly of assassinating the Tsar or perhaps just the Tsarina. Wilson was impressed by Generals Ruzski and Danilov, although he may have been influenced too much by the views of Knox, who had been British military attaché since 1911. He toured Petrograd, Moscow (where he was concerned at the food shortages) and Riga, which he predicted the “Boches” would never capture (they would do so in late 1917), and thought that even if Tsar and Tsarina were assassinated – the Tsar was toppled a few weeks after he left – Russia would not make a separate peace. His official report (3 March) said that Russia would remain in the war and that they would solve their “administrative chaos”. However, many other observers at the time, e.g. the young Archibald Wavell in the Caucasus, felt that the advent of democracy in Russia would reinvigorate her war effort, so Wilson’s views were not entirely unusual.|$|E

500|$|Though {{at times}} Hazlitt delighted in actors' interpretations of Shakespearean characters, {{and he thought}} some of Shakespeare's plays eminently suited for the stage, he opens the chapter on Hamlet by proclaiming, [...] "We {{do not like to}} see our author's plays acted, and least of all, Hamlet". Here, more than {{anywhere}} else, he sides with Charles Lamb in believing Shakespeare's plays to suffer in stage presentation. Neither John Kemble nor his favourite actor Edmund Kean played the role of Hamlet to his satisfaction. [...] "Mr. Kean's Hamlet is as much too splenetic and rash as Mr. Kemble's is too deliberate and formal." [...] This, he felt, is a play to be read, and he noted that by his time it had already been so often read as to have become part of the common culture. [...] "This is that Hamlet the Dane, whom we read of in our youth". One might say, he observes, that Hamlet is just a character in a play: [...] "Hamlet is a name; his speeches and sayings but the idle coinage of the poet's brain." [...] Yet Shakespeare gives those sayings a reality {{in the mind of the}} reader, making them [...] "as real <b>as</b> <b>our</b> <b>own</b> thoughts." ...|$|E
500|$|Critical {{response}} to the first episode was not favourable; in The Independent, Nicholas Barber called it the most depressing TV programme he had ever seen. He wrote of the six main characters, [...] "Are we supposed to care about these people? The theory, I think, {{is that we should}} relate to them, because their lives are as prosaic <b>as</b> <b>our</b> <b>own,</b> and because Cold Feet is a portrait of urban life as it really is in the Nineties. This is another way of saying the writer hasn't bothered with research or imagination." [...] He criticised the conclusion of Episode 1 but praised the other five, which he had seen on preview tapes. On The Late Review, Germaine Greer and Tony Parsons singled out Nesbitt's acting; Greer called him [...] "especially awful" [...] and Parsons wished that he had plunged to his death from the scissor lift Adam appears on {{at the beginning of the}} episode. General reaction improved as the first year went on. At the conclusion of the first series, Andrew Billen compared it with Vanity Fair in the Evening Standard and was pleased that it offered a televisual outlet for the [...] "forgotten" [...] twentysomethings. Paul Hoggart for The Times wrote positively of the writing, directing, acting, and editing and looked forward to how Rachel's pregnancy plot would be resolved in the second series.|$|E

2500|$|To the Western powers, Japan's victory {{demonstrated}} {{the emergence of}} a new Asian regional power. With the Russian defeat, some scholars have argued that the war had set in motion a change in the global world order with the emergence of Japan as not only a regional power, but rather, the main Asian power. Rather more than the possibilities of diplomatic partnership were emerging, however. The Japanese success increased self-confidence among anti-colonial nationalists in colonised Asian countries – Vietnamese, Indonesians, Indians and Filipinos – and to those in declining countries like the Ottoman Empire and Persia in immediate danger of being absorbed by the Western powers. It also encouraged the Chinese who, despite having been at war with the Japanese only a decade before, still considered Westerners the greater threat. [...] "We regarded that Russian defeat by Japan as the defeat of the West by the East. We regarded the Japanese victory <b>as</b> <b>our</b> <b>own</b> victory," [...] declared Sun Yat-sen.

2500|$|So {{reads the}} {{pantomime}} scenario; {{what follows is}} Gautier's review of the piece:... the sight of this pantomime has filled our soul with melancholy. [...] What! [...] Pierrot, from whom of old one borrowed a pen—"to write a word"—and who loaned it so willingly, having {{not the least bit}} of interest in it himself, has been reduced by the misery of the times to making it run from morning to night over musty old documents! ... Pierrot! no longer daring to wear his white blouse and his wide trousers! [...] Pierrot in a black suit! [...] And what a black suit! threadbare, tight, curled at the cuffs with age, its seams blackened with ink: a perfect poem of respectable misery! [...] —When he sits down, what pitiful angles his knees make! [...] How pointed his elbows are! [...] What a black gaze is in that pale and flour-covered face! [...] This is what has become of the joyous Pierrot of the pantomime. [...] Pierrot has a profession; Pierrot is employed. [...] He has been made to realize that a century as serious <b>as</b> <b>our</b> <b>own</b> will not suffer the idle!Gautier's remark about Legrand's black suit says something else about the mime: that he was as comfortable in character costume (Deburau initiated the practice) as he was in the garb of Pierrot. [...] About this Gautier was ambivalent: the [...] "truthfulness" [...] of Legrand's acting was unprecedented, but how welcome it was for the spectator still enchanted by the fantasy of Deburau's stage was a valid question: [...] "By virtue of the verisimilitude of his acting," [...] writes Gautier, [...] " [...] turns the fantastic type into a human character whose white face comes as a surprise. [...] He often even abandons the linen blouse and trousers, retaining only the plaster mask, in order to represent beings that are more real." [...] The [...] "realism" [...] of Legrand's pantomime marked a dramatic—and, for some, a disturbing—turn in the fortunes of Pierrot.|$|E
2500|$|According to Martin Gardner, the [...] "other" [...] {{worlds of}} MWI have two {{different}} interpretations: real or unreal; {{he claims that}} Stephen Hawking and Steven Weinberg both favour the unreal interpretation. Gardner also claims that the nonreal interpretation is favoured {{by the majority of}} physicists, whereas the [...] "realist" [...] view is only supported by MWI experts such as Deutsch and Bryce DeWitt. Hawking has said that [...] "according to Feynman's idea", all the other histories are as [...] "equally real" [...] <b>as</b> <b>our</b> <b>own,</b> and Martin Gardner reports Hawking saying that MWI is [...] "trivially true". In a 1983 interview, Hawking also said he regarded the MWI as [...] "self-evidently correct" [...] but was dismissive towards questions about the interpretation of quantum mechanics, saying, [...] "When I hear of Schrödinger's cat, I reach for my gun." [...] In the same interview, he also said, [...] "But, look: All that one does, really, is to calculate conditional probabilities—in other words, the probability of A happening, given B. I think that that's all the many worlds interpretation is. Some people overlay it with a lot of mysticism about the wave function splitting into different parts. But all that you're calculating is conditional probabilities." [...] Elsewhere Hawking contrasted his attitude towards the [...] "reality" [...] of physical theories with that of his colleague Roger Penrose, saying, [...] "He's a Platonist and I'm a positivist. He's worried that Schrödinger's cat is in a quantum state, where it is half alive and half dead. He feels that can't correspond to reality. But that doesn't bother me. I don't demand that a theory correspond to reality because I don't know what it is. Reality is not a quality you can test with litmus paper. All I'm concerned with is that the theory should predict the results of measurements. Quantum theory does this very successfully." [...] For his own part, Penrose agrees with Hawking that QM applied to the universe implies MW, although he considers the current lack of a successful theory of quantum gravity negates the claimed universality of conventional QM.|$|E
