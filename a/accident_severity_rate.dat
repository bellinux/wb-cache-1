This company is suffering from lost time injury and accidents due to a lot of different accidents and several hazards associated with complicated location of the work environment. This work discusses the main parameters representing the risk and safety measures in this company, such as accident frequency, severity indictor (FSI), accident frequency rate (AFR) and <b>accident</b> <b>severity</b> <b>rate</b> (ASR), since 1998 to December 2014. The AFR, ASR and FSI have dropped from 5. 51, 679 and 0. 78 to 0. 18, 6. 5 and 0. 3, respectively. The decline in these factors may be considered satisfactory since 2004 due to commitment and implementing of new and different safety polices procedures and issues of international safety standards (OHSAS- 18001 2007) by the new leaderships of this company.

40|$|Abstract: An {{occupational}} injury surveillance study (record study {{of five years}} duration) was conducted involving the workers of a fertilizer producing industry in eastern India to assess whether the risk of occupational accidents in temporary piece rated workers was higher {{in comparison to the}} permanent time rated workers. At the same time, to collect the personal details of the workers who have worked in the industry in the study period, an interview was also conducted. Mean age of temporary piece rated workers and permanent time rated workers were (35. 9 ± 12. 5) and (35. 3 ± 11. 4) respectively. Distribution of other variables like nature of work, level of education, experience, habits were also very similar between the two worker groups. Accident incidence rate, accident frequency rate and <b>accident</b> <b>severity</b> <b>rate</b> were found to be significantly higher in temporary piece rated workers. This difference was more prominent in case of time-loss accidents than in no timeloss accidents. Relative risk has varied from 2. 3 to 18. 0 in case of time-loss accidents. In case of no time-loss accidents, it has varied from 1. 1 to 2. 6. When relative risk is considered after taking both types of accidents together, it has ranged from 1. 2 to 3. 5. This study concluded that the temporary piece rated workers are more vulnerable to occupational accidents...|$|E
40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 33 rd Annual Southern African Transport Conference 7 - 10 July 2014 "Leading Transport into the Future", CSIR International Convention Centre, Pretoria, South Africa. National and international literature and research generally indicate that traffic circles (roundabouts) {{have a much better}} safety record than stop controlled and signalised intersections, especially when the <b>severity</b> of <b>accidents</b> are taken into account. A comprehensive investigation was done in eThekwini to evaluate the safety of traffic circles. Thirteen traffic circles were evaluated from a safety point of view, and compared to the safety record of twenty one traffic signals and ten stop controlled intersections. The intersections were chosen to cover a wide range of traffic volumes, so that accident rates could be plotted against average daily traffic for all three intersection types. Both <b>accident</b> <b>rates</b> and <b>accident</b> <b>severity</b> <b>rates</b> were analysed. Contrary to what is found in the literature, results showed that many traffic circles had higher <b>accident</b> <b>rates</b> and <b>accident</b> <b>severity</b> <b>rates</b> than traffic signals for the same average daily traffic. For higher daily traffic volumes (above 20 000 vehicles per day), traffic circles were found to have an alarmingly high accident rate compared to what is found in the literature. Possible reasons for the high accident rate at high volume circles are given, and the applicability of the research to the rest of South Africa is noted.

40|$|There {{is little}} {{knowledge}} available regarding Australian forestry work safety and accident rates. Machine operators and forestry workers are vital {{parts of the}} forestry sector and their health and well-being can greatly impact on their work quality and efficiency. To increase our knowledge of forest workers’ safety this project aimed to analyse the frequency, type and root causes of work accidents which occurred within different forestry activities of five industry partners of Australian Forest Operations Research Alliance over the period from 2004 to 2014. A questionnaire was designed and distributed to the partners to collect the safety incident reports. Total number of work accidents was 470 {{for a period of}} 11 years (a rate of 43 accidents per year). Considering the estimated yearly production rates of the industry partners that participated in this project, the <b>accident</b> <b>severity</b> <b>rate</b> was 14. 40 accidents per million m 3 of harvested wood. The majority of accidents occurred in harvesting operations (37 %) and forest management (30. 2 %). Based on the results 8. 1 % of the accidents occurred during firefighting and 24. 3 % of work accidents occurred in other forestry activities. Main root causes of accidents for different types of activities were personal errors such as lack of personal protective equipment, operator error, poor body position and poor techniques applied. Work safety training could be delivered to forestry personnel to minimise accidents caused by personal errors. Back and shoulder (as upper parts of the body) received most injuries.

40|$|Introduction: Each year tens of {{millions}} of labors are victims of occupational incidents leading to the disablement or death of many of them. The present study has been conducted with the aim of predicting the performance monitoring indicators of incident after implementation of the integrated management system in order to reduce number of incidents, safety monitoring, and giving priority to safety programs in the organization policies.. Matherial and Methods: Using safety performance indicators, this descriptive-analytical study has been done in two stages in a combined cycle power plant on 254 incidents before the implementation (2004) and the years after the implementation of integrated management systems(a seven year period). The required data was gathered through checklist and interview with the injured workers. Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Chi Square, and Cubic regression tests were utilized for data analysis at significance level of 0. 05.. Results: Of the 1131 labors during a seven year period, 254 occupational incidents were recorded. The highest value of accident frequency rate was in 2004 (32. 65) while the highest <b>accident</b> <b>severity</b> <b>rate</b> was in the year 2008 (209). Moreover, the lowest frequency rate and severity rate were related to the year 2011 with value of 9. 75 and 29. 26, respectively. Regression graphs, between the observed values and the estimated values, showed that the coefficients of all the indicators, except for β 1 of ASR,are significant(P< 0. 05) as expected. This result implies the improvement in the safety performance and integrated management systems..

40|$|Background and Aim: Traffic {{accident}} {{is one of}} {{the main}} causes of mortality in Iran. The damage and injury caused by these accidents threatens human societies severely. Rural accidents are often more severe and show harsher consequences because the operational speed is higher on rural roads and highways. World statistics presented by World Health Organization (WHO) reveal that about 25 percent of all injuries in the world are caused by traffic accidents. Appropriate diagnoses and treatments of traffic black spots, prioritization, defining proper safety countermeasures and geometric design improvements are the main objectives of this study. Materials and Methods: In this study, geometric design parameters are verified in black spots to determine which deficiency is the main cause of safety problem. Sari – Kiasar corridor, which is a rural road, is selected as the case study. Results: Because of the fact that the general topography of Sari – Kiasar corridor is mountainous, the geometric design parameters are very diverse. Thus, after evaluation of geometric parameters, black spots are determined according to the types of <b>accidents,</b> <b>severity</b> of <b>accidents,</b> <b>rate</b> of accidents and the collision scenario. These items are then verified and studied in detail. Conclusion: Results of the assessment show that geometric parameters such as horizontal and vertical curves, poor pavement, poor shoulder quality and poor drainage are contributing factors in increasing accident risk.

30|$|Only a {{few studies}} {{concentrated}} on risk factors associated to <b>accident</b> <b>severity.</b> In Taiwan, <b>accident</b> <b>rates</b> were linked to bus operator characteristics independently for fatal, severe injury and minor injury accidents [11]. In Bangladesh, bus <b>accident</b> <b>severity</b> was modeled with an ordered probit with respect to risk factors such as weekday, time of day, traffic flow, traffic control, median availability, number of vehicles involved, and collision type [8]. In Florida, transit bus <b>accident</b> <b>severity</b> was modeled with a multinomial logit model with regard to traffic flow and road characteristics [12]. In Canada, injury in bus accidents was estimated {{with a series of}} binary logistic regressions in connection to traffic control and infrastructural factors [27]. In the U.S., bus <b>accident</b> <b>severity</b> was modeled with a generalized ordered logit in regard to risk factors such as drivers’ demographics and behavior, collision partners’ characteristics and behavior, infrastructural characteristics and environmental conditions [18].

30|$|The {{analysis}} {{of the number of}} <b>accidents</b> and <b>accident</b> <b>severity</b> between urban and rural areas may lead to some interesting observations. Using data from the Hellenic Statistical Authority (statistics.gr), processed by the National Technical University of Athens (NTUA) Road Safety Observatory [40] one can deduce that in 2010 in Greece more than three quarters of road accidents and 49  % of fatalities occurred inside built-up areas. However, <b>accident</b> <b>severity</b> is more than 4 times higher outside built-up areas [40]. This is not a new finding, as it has been described several times {{over the past two decades}} (e.g. [11, 13]). Theofilatos et al. [51] analyze the factors affecting <b>accident</b> <b>severity</b> inside and outside urban areas in Greece. Theofilatos et al. [51] conclude that factors affecting road <b>accident</b> <b>severity</b> only inside urban areas include young driver age, intersections and collision with fixed objects, while factors affecting only severity outside of urban areas include weather conditions and head-on and side collisions. Clark and Cushing [17] present an analysis and discussion of rural and urban traffic fatalities, correlating them with exposure and population density. The majority of the variation (91  %) in rural mortality rate was explained by rural vehicle kilometers traveled (VKT) per capita, population density and southern location. Urban mortality rate, on the other hand, was not affected by population density, but was higher in the south.|$|R
