5|$|Citing Hirabayashi, Chief Justice Stone {{wrote the}} opinion of the court, and {{determined}} that the curfew and exclusion orders were valid, even <b>as</b> <b>applied</b> <b>to</b> citizens of the United States. Stone’s opinion was three pages and did not contain any concurring opinions or dissents, while the Hirabayashi decision had thirty-four pages and two concurring opinions. In Yasui the court affirmed his conviction of the misdemeanor, but ordered re-sentencing since the lower court had determined that the curfew was not valid, and that Yasui had forfeited his citizenship. The Supreme Court remanded (returned) the case back to the district court to determine a sentence in light of these circumstances.|$|E
5|$|Taylor {{provides}} {{background on}} the development of the term brainwashing, from its use in 1950 by journalist Edward Hunter and its later usage <b>as</b> <b>applied</b> <b>to</b> the spheres of cults, marketing, influence, thought reform, torture, and reeducation. She references psychiatrist Robert Jay Lifton's work Thought Reform and the Psychology of Totalism as a resource throughout the book. Lifton based his research on interviews he conducted with prisoners of war who had been subjected to indoctrination and torture during the Korean War. Taylor argues that the term brainwashing is useful to when used to refer to a more coercive form of persuasion.|$|E

5|$|After {{discussing}} Supreme Court precedent, Heins {{recounts the}} jury verdict which decided against her client by ruling that Richardson's firing was not illegal. Heins describes the trial chronologically, including the evidentiary process and testimony by witnesses. The jury's decision is examined; {{it found that}} Richardson sincerely believed that her school's administration practiced employment discrimination, and her criticism was made in good faith. However, the jury also determined that the administration did not fire Richardson because of this criticism. Heins critiques the compromise decision, contending that it reflects the bias of individual jurors rather than {{an interpretation of the}} law <b>as</b> <b>applied</b> <b>to</b> Richardson's firing by the school's administration. In post-trial interviews, the jurors explained they felt that it was the duty of employees (such as Richardson) respect their superiors and Nesmith was one such superior in his capacity as {{dean of the school of}} theology.|$|E
5|$|Philosophy of {{chemistry}} is the philosophical {{study of the}} methodology {{and content of the}} science {{of chemistry}}. It is explored by philosophers, chemists, and philosopher-chemist teams. It includes research on general philosophy of science issues <b>as</b> <b>applied</b> <b>to</b> chemistry. For example, can all chemical phenomena be explained by quantum mechanics or is it not possible to reduce chemistry to physics? For another example, chemists have discussed the philosophy of how theories are confirmed in the context of confirming reaction mechanisms. Determining reaction mechanisms is difficult because they cannot be observed directly. Chemists can use a number of indirect measures as evidence to rule out certain mechanisms, but they are often unsure if the remaining mechanism is correct because there are many other possible mechanisms that they have not tested or even thought of. Philosophers have also sought to clarify the meaning of chemical concepts which do not refer to specific physical entities, such as chemical bonds.|$|E
5|$|The {{application}} of sociobiology to humans (discussed {{only in the}} first and last chapters of the book) was immediately controversial. Some researchers, led by Stephen Jay Gould and Richard Lewontin, contended that sociobiology embodied biological determinism. They argued that it would be used, as similar ideas had been in the past, to justify the status quo, entrench ruling elites, and legitimize authoritarian political programmes. They referred to social Darwinism and eugenics of the early 20th century, and other more recent developments, such as the IQ controversy of the early 1970s, as cautionary tales in the use of evolutionary principles <b>as</b> <b>applied</b> <b>to</b> human society. They believed that Wilson was committing the naturalistic fallacy, attempting to define moral principles using natural concepts. Academics opposed to Wilson's sociobiology, including Gould, Lewontin, Jon Beckwith, Ruth Hubbard, and Anthony Leeds created the Sociobiology Study Group of Science for the People to counter his ideas.|$|E
