5|$|Powderfinger {{were active}} in {{supporting}} causes or opposing actions taken in charitable, philanthropic, disaster, and political circumstances. In 1996, when Crowded House decided to break up, they organised a farewell concert as a charity event for the Sydney Children's Hospital on 24 November. They approached Powderfinger and fellow Australian acts Custard and You <b>Am</b> <b>I</b> <b>to</b> also appear {{on the steps of}} the Sydney Opera House. The charity event, which was recorded and later released as a live album titled Farewell to the World, was claimed to have the largest Australian live concert audience, with estimates of between 100,000 and 250,000 people. In the wake of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami, Powderfinger performed at the WaveAid fund-raising concert in Sydney in January 2005. The disaster killed more than 225,000 people from 11 countries in the area. The total profit from the funds raised from ticket sales and donations was A$2,300,000, however most of this money was spent in the administrative stream with little reaching those affected.|$|E
25|$|In her {{quest for}} sanctity, she {{believed}} that it was not necessary to accomplish heroic acts, or great deeds, in order to attain holiness and to express her love of God. She wrote,Love proves itself by deeds, so how <b>am</b> <b>I</b> <b>to</b> show my love? Great deeds are forbidden me. The only way I can prove my love is by scattering flowers and these flowers are every little sacrifice, every glance and word, and the doing of the least actions for love.|$|E
500|$|Sitti Nurbaya {{inspired}} numerous authors, including Nur Sutan Iskandar, who {{stated that}} he wrote Apa Dayaku Karena Aku Perempuan (What <b>Am</b> <b>I</b> <b>to</b> Do Because I Am a Girl, 1924) {{as a direct result}} of reading it; Iskandar later wrote Cinta yang Membawa Maut (Love that Brings Death, 1926), which deals with the same themes. The Sitti Nurbaya storyline has often been reused, to the point that Balfas has referred to similar plots as following [...] "the Sitti Nurbaya formula".|$|E

500|$|Gandhi {{spent the}} day of {{independence}} not celebrating {{the end of the}} British rule, but appealing for peace among his countrymen by fasting and spinning in Calcutta on 15 August 1947. The partition had gripped the Indian subcontinent with religious violence and the streets were filled with corpses. Some writers credit Gandhi's fasting and protests stopped the religious riots and communal violence. Others do not. Archibald Wavell, for example, upon learning of Gandhi's assassination, commented, [...] "I always thought he [...] had more of malevolence than benevolence in him, but who <b>am</b> <b>I</b> <b>to</b> judge, and how can an Englishman estimate a Hindu?" ...|$|E
500|$|Although Scott is antipathetic towards Richardson's final novel, not {{everyone}} {{was of the}} same opinion; Jane Austen was a devotee of the novel, {{which was part of}} her mental furniture to the point where she could claim to describe [...] "all that was ever said or done in the cedar parlour". She would for example casually compare a flower in a new cap she got to the white feather described by Harriet Byron as being in hers. Nevertheless, throughout her life she also subjected Grandison to much affectionate, even satirical mockery - adapting it into a dramatic lampoon (not published until 1980) around 1800. Her juvenalia also included a heroine who guyed Harriet Byron's frequent fainting, through being “in such a hurry to have a succession of fainting fits, that she had scarcely patience enough to recover from one before she fell into another”. As late as 1813, she would respond to a long letter from her sister Cassandra by exclaiming “Dear me!...Like Harriet Byron I ask, what <b>am</b> <b>I</b> <b>to</b> do with my Gratitude”.|$|E
500|$|According to Casting Crowns' {{lead singer}} Mark Hall, {{the idea for}} [...] "Who Am I" [...] came while he was driving home {{with his wife and}} {{children}} one night. Hall, who was having personal worship time during the drive, recounts that he wondered [...] "Who <b>am</b> <b>I</b> <b>to</b> think I can just call up to God whenever I want, from the middle of nowhere, and expect Him to hear me?" [...] Hall says [...] "immediately I started thinking I'm a new creation, I'm more than a conqueror... I'm [...] grass, that is rises up and is gone in a day". In an interview, he commented that [...] "me being a conqueror is true, {{but at the same time}} I need to understand that my life is a vapor, and me being able to even pray to [...] is because of what he's done for me". [...] "Who Am I" [...] was produced by Mark A. Miller and Steven Curtis Chapman. It was recorded at Glow In The Dark Studio in Decatur, Georgia and Zoo Studio in Franklin, Tennessee, and it was engineered by Matt Goldman and Sam Hewitt.|$|E

2500|$|The Old Testament {{is often}} {{interpreted}} to condemn homosexuality and homosexual acts, and the Catholic Church traditionally rejected same-sex behavior and considered it against nature.

Ismail's burial was postponed until his arrival. Upon arrival, finding that his instructions for Ismail's funeral had not been followed, Razak reportedly exclaimed to Ismail's widow, [...] "Who <b>am</b> <b>I</b> <b>to</b> trust now?" [...] Razak was particularly upset that the lying in state had been held in the National Mosque instead of the Houses of Parliament, as he had intended that non-Muslim Malaysians be able to view the lying in state without discomfort.|$|E

2500|$|He {{acknowledged}} {{the existence of}} a [...] "gay lobby" [...] within the Vatican in remarks during a meeting held in private with Catholic religious from Latin America. He was reported to have promised to see what could be done to address the issue. [...] In July 2013, he responded directly to journalists' questions. He notably drew a distinction between the problem of lobbying and the sexual orientation of people: [...] "If a person is gay and seeks God and has good will, who <b>am</b> <b>I</b> <b>to</b> judge?" [...] "The problem", he said, [...] "is not having this orientation. We must be brothers. The problem is lobbying by this orientation, or lobbies of greedy people, political lobbies, Masonic lobbies, so many lobbies. This is the worse problem." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Bukhari, Muhammad's wife Aisha {{described}} {{that the}} first Quranic revelation occurred when angel Gabriel visited Muhammad {{and asked him to}} recite. Muhammad responded ma ana bīqāre'u, which could be translated into a number of ways: 'I do not read' or 'what <b>am</b> <b>I</b> <b>to</b> read/recite?' or 'I will not read/recite'. Gabriel pressed him [...] "until all the strength went out of me; thereupon he released me and said: ‘Read!’" [...] This was repeated three times and upon the third, Gabriel released him and said, [...] "Read {{in the name of the}} Sustainer who created humankind from a clot! Read! And your Sustainer is the most Beautiful." [...] After this Muhammad continued sporadically over a period of twenty-three years to have revelations, until shortly before his death in 11/632.|$|E

[...] He was at her bedside to the end, which came August 6, when Wilson despairingly said [...] "Oh my God, what <b>am</b> <b>I</b> <b>to</b> do." [...] Wilson later wrote accurately of his mourning and depression, [...] "Of course you know what has happened to me…God has stricken me almost beyond what I can bear". Six months of depression followed for him, though mourning continued.
