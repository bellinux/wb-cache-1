40|$|Marc~z, i 948 Summary. [...] Model {{tests have}} been made to {{investigate}} the functioning of an air interchange system for removing from a return-circuit wind tunnel a high proportion of the exhaust products from propulsive units under test. The tests were planned to assist the design of an engine <b>altitude</b> <b>tunnel.</b> With changing circumstances the priority of this tunnel has been reduced, but the tests were continued to give general information on the extraction of engine exhaust products from this type of wind tunnel. The tests were made on a partial model of a tunnel, which had an air interchange exhaust collector designed to remove 15 per cent of the tunnel mass flow. This was installed on the tunnel axis at the downstream end of the working section. Tests were also made on 10 per cent and 5 per cent collector entries designed to be interchange. able with the 15 per cent entry. The main results obtained were as follows: [...] 1. The flow in the working-section was satisfactory, and was not affected by substituting the 5 per cent or 10 per cent collector for the 15 per cent collector, nor was it affected by changes made to the interchange ratio with a given collector. 2. The flow of the main tunnel air round the collectors and in the annular diffuser downstream of the collectors was satisfactory. The losses at the collectors were of the order expected, but were appreciable, and woul...|$|E
