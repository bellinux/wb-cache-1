5|$|Claims that Stroheim's {{original}} cut was {{a completely}} unabridged version of McTeague are not accurate. Stroheim's 300-page script was <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>long</b> as the original novel, but he rethought the entire story and invented new scenes, as well as extensively elaborating existing ones. In the Norris novel, McTeague's back story in Placer County and relationships with his father, mother and Potter were remembered as a flashback and took two paragraphs. In Stroheim's original Greed, this sequence took up the first hour of the film and was not a flashback. Stroheim also modernized the novel's time span to between 1908 and 1923, a quarter-century later than the novel.|$|E
5|$|The {{pectoral}} fins {{are long}} and narrow. The first dorsal fin is large and high, with a rounded apex, and originating just behind the pectoral fin bases. The pelvic fins are {{much smaller than the}} first dorsal fin. The second dorsal and anal fins are smaller still, and placed about even with each other on narrow bases that allow pivoting from side to side. The sides of the caudal peduncle are expanded into prominent lateral keels. A second, shorter pair of keels are present below the main keels. The caudal fin is large and crescent-shaped, with the lower lobe <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>long</b> as the upper; there are both dorsal and ventral depressions (precaudal pits) at the caudal fin base, and a deep ventral notch near the tip of the upper caudal fin lobe. The skin is soft and covered by tiny, flattened dermal denticles (scales), lending a velvety texture. Each denticle has three horizontal ridges that lead to teeth on the posterior margin.|$|E

Furthermore, the costs of pipeline building make the whole enterprise capital intensive, requiring both money and engineering expertise, and large enough markets to make the business profitable.|$|E

25|$|The {{field of}} island {{restoration}} is usually credited with having been started in New Zealand in the 1960s, but other smaller projects, {{such as the}} restoration of Nonsuch Island in Bermuda (which began in 1962) {{have been going on}} for <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>long.</b> Nevertheless, the program undertaken by the Department of Conservation (DOC) {{is one of the largest}} in the world. It began on Cuvier Island, where ecologists removed stock, goats, feral cats and finally, in 1993, Pacific rats. The success of the project resulted in similar projects around New Zealand. The advantages to the DOC were considerable; in addition to protecting species endemic to smaller islands, like the magenta petrel, islands near the mainland, once restored, could act as habitat for species of birds that were unable to survive on the mainland. Species like the takahe, where the remaining wild population was at considerable risk from feral cats and dogs, could be moved to these islands to safeguard the species.|$|E
25|$|Renbourn {{left the}} band {{to pursue a}} {{long-term}} ambition of studying classical music, taking up a place at Dartington College of Arts. There then followed a series of replacement personnel. Mike Piggott replaced Renbourn in 1982, and subsequently Nigel Portman Smith replaced Thomson and Gerry Conway (who had worked with Fotheringay, Cat Stevens, Jethro Tull, Richard Thompson and John Martyn) replaced Cox (in 1986 and 1987 respectively); leaving McShee and Jansch as the only remaining members from the original line-up. In 1989 Rod Clements of Lindisfarne fame replaced Piggott before he left and Peter Kirtley {{assumed the role of}} guitarist in the following year. The incarnation consisting of Jansch, McShee, Portman Smith, Kirtley and Conway survived <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>long</b> as the original Pentangle and recorded three albums: Think of Tomorrow, One More Road and Live 1994.

500|$|When {{writing a}} new script, Rucka tries {{to follow the}} world-building model used by William Gibson in Neuromancer and provide {{information}} about the environment through context instead of exposition. His biggest struggle is delivering details while maintaining a proper narrative pace. He sometimes self-censors [...] "exceptionally dark" [...] material {{because he does not}} want to make Lark draw it. After Lark receives a new script, the collaboration between them is [...] "immediate and constant". Lark questions Rucka about characterization and the direction of the story, resulting in rewrites and a better final product. Rucka says Lark intuitively knows what is happening in the story even when it isn't clearly scripted. Rucka and Lark have an ongoing conversation about how to show the injustice in the way Forever is treated without being complicit in it themselves. For example, medics must remove Forever's clothes to treat her wounds. Lark wanted to avoid sexualizing the images, but also avoid being [...] "coy" [...] by simply blocking parts of her body with another character's arm. The script gives Lark no direction for aspects like architecture, clothing, or vehicle design. Designing these technical details involves research into prototype technology and takes <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>long</b> as drawing the actual pages for the comics. The time required to create the sets is the primary reason Lark sometimes falls behind schedule.|$|E
500|$|The concert {{itself was}} {{received}} enthusiastically by the Osaka audience. [...] "I {{had no idea}} what [...] were going to do", Henderson recalled. [...] "They gave us a standing ovation that was <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>long</b> as the concert." [...] Upon returning from Japan, Davis fell ill again and was hospitalized for three months. He held a few more shows and studio sessions with the band, but his health worsened; their last show on September 5, 1975, in Central Park ended abruptly when Davis left the stage and began to cry in pain. He retired soon after—citing physical, spiritual, and creative exhaustion—and lived as a recluse for the next several years, often struggling with bouts of depression and further medical treatment. Agharta was reassessed positively by critics during this period, and in 1980 Davis returned to recording music. He abandoned the direction he had pursued in the 1970s, instead playing a style of fusion far more melodic and accessible to audiences, until his death in 1991. The day after he died, Prague's Wenceslas Square saw the opening of the AghaRTA Jazz Centrum, a small jazz club named after the album, hosting nightly performances and an annual festival played by local and international acts. In January of that year, Agharta was reissued in the U.S. by Columbia on CD, featuring a remaster Tingen deemed inferior to the original LP in sound and mix quality. Sony later remastered it again as part of their Davis reissue campaign and Master Sound series in Japan, with improved sound using Super Bit Mapping. This remaster was made available in the U.S. {{for the first time in}} 2009, when Agharta was one of 52 albums re-issued in mini-LP replica sleeves as a part of , a box set released by Sony Legacy.|$|E
