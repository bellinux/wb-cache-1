5|$|As {{described}} previously, {{the molecules}} that underlie LTP {{can be classified}} as mediators or modulators. A mediator of LTP is <b>a</b> <b>molecule,</b> such as the NMDA receptor or calcium, whose presence and activity is necessary for generating LTP under nearly all conditions. By contrast, a modulator is <b>a</b> <b>molecule</b> that can alter LTP but is not essential for its generation or expression.|$|E
5|$|Sucrose {{is found}} in the stems of {{sugarcane}} and roots of sugar beet. It also occurs naturally alongside fructose and glucose in other plants, in particular fruits and some roots such as carrots. The different proportions of sugars found in these foods determines the range of sweetness experienced when eating them. <b>A</b> <b>molecule</b> of sucrose is formed by the combination of <b>a</b> <b>molecule</b> of glucose with <b>a</b> <b>molecule</b> of fructose. After being eaten, sucrose is split into its constituent parts during digestion by a number of enzymes known as sucrases.|$|E

40|$|LPS {{molecules}} of marine bacteria show distinct structures from terrestrial bacteria, {{due to the}} different environment that marine bacteria live in. Because of these different structures, lipid <b>A</b> <b>molecules</b> from marine bacteria are most often poor stimulators of the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR 4) pathway. Due to their low stimulatory potential, these lipid <b>A</b> <b>molecules</b> {{could be used to}} antagonize TLR 4 signaling in sepsis patients, where this immune response is amplified and unregulated. Antagonizing lipid <b>A</b> <b>molecules</b> might be used for future therapies against sepsis, therapies that currently do not exist. In this review, the structural differences of terrestrial and marine lipid <b>A</b> <b>molecules</b> are described. Furthermore, the consequences of structural differences on immune recognition will be discussed, thereby relating the antagonizing potential of marine lipid <b>A</b> <b>molecules</b> to their structure. Finally, since clinical trials built on antagonizing lipid <b>A</b> <b>molecules</b> have proven unsuccessful, we propose to focus on different aspects of the TLR 4 signaling pathway when searching for new potential drugs. Furthermore, we put forward the notion that bacteria probably already produce inhibitors of TLR 4 signaling, making these bacterial products interesting molecules to investigate for future sepsis therapies...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe primary {{electron}} donor of photosystem (PS) II in the chlorophyll (Chl) d-dominated cyanobacterium Acaryochloris marina {{was confirmed by}} delayed fluorescence (DF) and further proved by pigment contents of cells grown under several light intensities. The DF was found only in the Chl a region, identical to Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, and disappeared following heat treatment. Pigment analyses indicated {{that at least two}} Chl <b>a</b> <b>molecules</b> were present per each two pheophytin <b>a</b> <b>molecules,</b> and these Chl <b>a</b> <b>molecules</b> are assigned to PD 1 and PD 2. These findings clearly indicate that Chl a is required for water oxidation in PS II...|$|R
5|$|Lactose, maltose, and sucrose are all {{compound}} sugars, disaccharides, {{with the}} general formula C12H22O11. They are formed by the combination of two monosaccharide molecules with the exclusion of <b>a</b> <b>molecule</b> of water.|$|E
5|$|These {{sections}} are subdivided {{by other}} {{features such as}} the substrate, products, and chemical mechanism. An enzyme is fully specified by four numerical designations. For example, hexokinase (EC 2.7.1.1) is a transferase (EC 2) that adds a phosphate group (EC 2.7) to a hexose sugar, <b>a</b> <b>molecule</b> containing an alcohol group (EC 2.7.1).|$|E
5|$|A {{chelating}} agent is <b>a</b> <b>molecule</b> {{with at least}} two negatively charged groups that allow it to form complexes with metal ions with multiple positive charges, such as lead. The chelate that is thus formed is nontoxic and can be excreted in the urine, initially at up to 50 times the normal rate. The {{chelating agent}}s used for treatment of lead poisoning are edetate disodium calcium (CaNa2EDTA), dimercaprol (BAL), which are injected, and succimer and d-penicillamine, which are administered orally.|$|E
50|$|The Vibration {{theory of}} smell proposes that <b>a</b> <b>molecule's</b> smell {{character}} {{is due to}} its vibrational frequency in the infrared range. This controversial theory is {{an alternative to the}} more widely accepted shape theory of olfaction, which proposes that <b>a</b> <b>molecule's</b> smell character is due to its molecular size, molecular shape and functional groups.|$|R

5|$|An enzyme {{inhibitor}} is <b>a</b> <b>molecule</b> that binds to an enzyme and decreases its activity. Since blocking an enzyme's activity can kill a pathogen or correct a metabolic imbalance, many drugs are {{enzyme inhibitor}}s. They {{are also used}} in pesticides. Not all molecules that bind to enzymes are inhibitors; enzyme activators bind to enzymes and increase their enzymatic activity, while enzyme substrates bind and are converted to products in the normal catalytic cycle of the enzyme.|$|E
5|$|Another way to view {{surface tension}} is {{in terms of}} energy. <b>A</b> <b>molecule</b> in contact with a {{neighbor}} is in a lower state of energy than if it were alone (not in contact with a neighbor). The interior molecules have as many neighbors as they can possibly have, but the boundary molecules are missing neighbors (compared to interior molecules) and therefore have a higher energy. For the liquid to minimize its energy state, the number of higher energy boundary molecules must be minimized. The minimized number of boundary molecules results in a minimal surface area.|$|E
5|$|Dopamine (DA, a {{contraction}} of 3,4-dihydroxyphenethylamine) is an organic chemical of the catecholamine and phenethylamine families that plays several {{important roles in}} the brain and body. It is an amine synthesized by removing a carboxyl group from <b>a</b> <b>molecule</b> of its precursor chemical L-DOPA, which is synthesized {{in the brain and}} kidneys. Dopamine is also synthesized in plants and most animals.|$|E

50|$|Absorption {{of light}} by {{photosynthetic}} pigments converts photons into chemical energy. Light energy radiating onto the chloroplast strikes the pigments in the thylakoid membrane and excites their electrons. Since the chlorophyll <b>a</b> <b>molecules</b> only capture certain wavelengths, organisms may use accessory pigments {{to capture a}} wider range of light energy shown as the yellow circles. It then transfers captured light from one pigment to the next as resonance energy, passing energy one pigment to the other until reaching the special chlorophyll <b>a</b> <b>molecules</b> in the reaction center. These special chlorophyll <b>a</b> <b>molecules</b> are located in both photosystem II and photosystem I. They are known as P680 for Photosystem II and P700 for Photosystem I. P680 and P700 are the primary electron donors to the electron transport chain.|$|R

5|$|Even if <b>a</b> <b>molecule</b> {{does not}} form a {{permanent}} dipole, {{it can still}} be influenced by an electric field. In some cases, the field produces slight re-arrangement of electrons and protons in molecules such that an induced electric dipole results. While {{not as strong as}} permanent dipoles, orientation with the external field still occurs.|$|E
5|$|Interstellar {{molecules}} {{are formed}} by chemical reactions within very sparse interstellar or circumstellar {{clouds of dust}} and gas. Usually this occurs when <b>a</b> <b>molecule</b> becomes ionized, often {{as the result of}} an interaction with a cosmic ray. This positively charged molecule then draws in a nearby reactant by electrostatic attraction of the neutral molecule's electrons. Molecules can also be generated by reactions between neutral atoms and molecules, although this process is generally slower. The dust plays a critical role of shielding the molecules from the ionizing effect of ultraviolet radiation emitted by stars.|$|E
5|$|Maltose {{is formed}} during the {{germination}} of certain grains, {{the most notable}} being barley, which is converted into malt, {{the source of the}} sugar's name. <b>A</b> <b>molecule</b> of maltose is formed by the combination of two molecules of glucose. It is less sweet than glucose, fructose or sucrose. It is formed in the body during the digestion of starch by the enzyme amylase and is itself broken down during digestion by the enzyme maltase.|$|E

5|$|Melatonin is a {{powerful}} antioxidant. Melatonin easily crosses cell membranes and the blood–brain barrier. Unlike other antioxidants, melatonin does not undergo redox cycling, which {{is the ability of}} <b>a</b> <b>molecule</b> to undergo repeated reduction and oxidation. Redox cycling may allow other antioxidants (such as vitamin C) to act as pro-oxidants and promote free radical formation. Melatonin, once oxidized, cannot be reduced to its former state because it forms several stable end-products upon reacting with free radicals. Therefore, it has been referred to as a terminal (or suicidal) antioxidant.|$|E
5|$|Not {{only are}} groups useful {{to assess the}} {{implications}} of symmetries in molecules, but surprisingly they also predict that molecules sometimes can change symmetry. The Jahn-Teller effect is a distortion of <b>a</b> <b>molecule</b> of high symmetry when it adopts a particular ground state of lower symmetry from a set of possible ground states {{that are related to}} each other by the symmetry operations of the molecule.|$|E
5|$|The {{ability of}} the {{director}} to align along an external field {{is caused by the}} electric nature of the molecules. Permanent electric dipoles result when one end of <b>a</b> <b>molecule</b> has a net positive charge while the other end has a net negative charge. When an external electric field is applied to the liquid crystal, the dipole molecules tend to orient themselves along the direction of the field.|$|E
50|$|The Shape {{theory of}} smell proposes that <b>a</b> <b>molecule's</b> smell {{character}} {{is due to}} its molecular shape, molecular size and functional groups.

5|$|The enzymes of the {{citric acid}} cycle {{are located in}} the {{mitochondrial}} matrix, with the exception of succinate dehydrogenase, which is bound to the inner mitochondrial membrane as part of Complex II. The citric acid cycle oxidizes the acetyl-CoA to carbon dioxide, and, in the process, produces reduced cofactors (three molecules of NADH and one molecule of FADH2) that are a source of electrons for the electron transport chain, and <b>a</b> <b>molecule</b> of GTP (that is readily converted to an ATP).|$|E
5|$|The form of sEH in the {{intracellular}} {{environment is}} a homodimer with two distinct activities {{in two separate}} structural domains of each monomer: the C-terminal epoxide hydrolase activity (soluble epoxide hydrolase: EC 3.3.2.10) and the N-terminal phosphatase activity (lipid-phosphate phosphatase: EC 3.1.3.76). sEH converts epoxides, or three membered cyclic ethers, to their corresponding diols through the addition of <b>a</b> <b>molecule</b> of water. The resulting diols are more water-soluble than the parent epoxides, and so are more readily excreted by the organism.|$|E
40|$|AbstractRhodopseudomonas palustris {{belongs to}} the group of purple {{bacteria}} that have the ability to produce LH 2 complexes with unusual absorption spectra when they are grown at low-light intensity. This ability is often related to the presence of multiple genes encoding the antenna apoproteins. Here we report, {{for the first time to}} our knowledge, direct evidence that individual low-light LH 2 complexes have a heterogeneous αβ-apoprotein composition that modulates the site energies of Bchl <b>a</b> <b>molecules,</b> producing absorption bands at 800, 820, and 850 nm. The arrangement of the Bchl <b>a</b> <b>molecules</b> in the “tightly coupled ring” can be modeled by nine αβ-Bchls dimers, such that the Bchls bound to six αβ-pairs have B 820 -like site energies and the remaining Bchl <b>a</b> <b>molecules</b> have B 850 -like site energies. Furthermore, the experimental data can only be satisfactorily modeled when these six αβ-pairs with B 820 Bchl <b>a</b> <b>molecules</b> are distributed such that the symmetry of the assembly is reduced to C 3. It is also clear from the measured single-molecule spectra that the energies of the electronically excited states in the mixed B 820 / 850 ring are mainly influenced by diagonal disorder...|$|R
