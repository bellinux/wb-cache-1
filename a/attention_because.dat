U.S. officials said that NORAD scrambled fighter aircraft over numerous American and Canadian cities for Combat Air Patrol, and that U.S. President George W.

5|$|Riya's {{on-screen}} performances {{have established}} {{her as a}} bold youth icon in India. Since entering the film industry, she has gained attention for wearing a bikini in Shaadi No. 1 and sharing on-screen kisses with co-stars Ashmit Patel in Silsiilay and Sharman Joshi in Style, respectively. Such performances garnered negative <b>attention</b> <b>because</b> of the relatively conservative outlook of Indian cinema {{at that time and}} her own statements about such practices. In 2008, Riya Sen was also linked to author Salman Rushdie. Before becoming a film star, she had a reputation for partying, which started at the age of fifteen.

5|$|The Washington Redskins name {{controversy}} {{involves the}} name and logo of the Washington Redskins, a National Football League (NFL) franchise in the Washington metropolitan area. Native American individuals, tribes and organizations have been questioning the use of {{the name and}} image for decades. According to the American Psychological Association as of 2010, over 115 professional organizations representing civil rights, educational, athletic, and scientific experts have published resolutions or policies that state that the use of Native American names and/or symbols by non-native sports teams is a harmful form of ethnic stereotyping that promotes misunderstanding and prejudice, contributing to other problems faced by Native Americans. The Washington, D.C., team is only one example of the larger controversy, but it receives more public <b>attention</b> <b>because</b> modern dictionaries define the name as derogatory or insulting and because the team represents the nation's capital.|$|E
5|$|The {{teaser trailer}} was {{released}} on selected screens accompanying Meet Joe Black on November 13, 1998, and media reported that people were paying full admission at theaters to see the trailer. To keep fans from leaving before the movie was over, some theaters played the teaser an additional time after the film finished. A second trailer {{was released on}} March 12, 1999, with the film Wing Commander. Again, many fans paid full theater admission to watch the new trailer. A bootlegged version of the preview was leaked to the Internet the same day. The next morning, the trailer was released on the film's official website and shortly afterwards the servers became overloaded.
