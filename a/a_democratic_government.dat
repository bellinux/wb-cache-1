5|$|The Philippines has <b>a</b> <b>democratic</b> <b>government</b> in {{the form}} of a {{constitutional}} republic with a presidential system. It is governed as a unitary state with the exception of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM), which is largely free from the national government. There have been attempts to change the government to a federal, unicameral, or parliamentary government since the Ramos administration.|$|E
5|$|Bonaparte {{restored}} Lafayette's citizenship on 1 March 1800, and he {{was able}} to recover some of his properties. The ruler offered to make Lafayette minister to the United States, but was met with a firm refusal, as Lafayette would not have anything to do with Napoleon's government. In 1802, Lafayette was part of the tiny minority that voted no in the referendum that made Bonaparte consul for life. Bonaparte offered to appoint Lafayette to the Senate and to bestow the Legion of Honor upon him, but Lafayette declined, though he stated he would gladly have taken the honors from <b>a</b> <b>democratic</b> <b>government.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Arévalo {{government}} also floated {{the idea of}} a Central American Federation, as being the only way that <b>a</b> <b>democratic</b> <b>government</b> could survive in the region. He approached several leaders of democratic Central American countries, but was rejected by all except Castañeda Castro, the president of El Salvador. The two leaders began talks to build a union, and set up several commissions to look into the issue. In late 1945 they announced the formation of the union, but the formalization of the process got delayed by internal troubles in both countries, and in 1948 the Castro government was toppled in a military coup led by Óscar Osorio.|$|E

5|$|In ancient Athens, the Athenian {{democracy}} was restored on three separate occasions following the initial {{conquest of the}} city by Antipater in 322 BC. However, when it fell repeatedly under Macedonian rule it was governed by a Macedonian-imposed oligarchy composed of the wealthiest members of the city-state, their membership determined by {{the value of their}} property. Yet other city-states were handled quite differently and were allowed a greater degree of autonomy. After Philip II conquered Amphipolis in 357 BC, the city was allowed to retain its democracy, including its constitution, popular assembly, city council (boule), and yearly elections for new officials, but a Macedonian garrison was housed within the city walls along with a Macedonian royal commissioner (epistates) to monitor the city's political affairs. However, Philippi, the city founded by Philip II, was the only other city in the Macedonian commonwealth that had <b>a</b> <b>democratic</b> <b>government</b> with popular assemblies, since the assembly (ecclesia) of Thessaloniki seems to have had only a passive function in practice. Some cities also maintained their own municipal revenues, although evidence is lacking as to whether this was derived from local taxation or grants from the royal court. The Macedonian king and central government otherwise sustained strict control over the finances administered by other cities, especially in regards to the revenues generated by temples and cultic priesthoods.|$|E

25|$|Democracy {{in modern}} times has almost always faced {{opposition}} from the previously existing government, and many times it has faced opposition from social elites.

25|$|Like many German war veterans, Stieve was {{dissatisfied}} with the Weimar Republic and its attempt at <b>a</b> <b>democratic</b> <b>government.</b> He was also a German nationalist, supporting a drive to replace words of non-German origin in the German language, such as April and Mai for those months, with words of German origin. These political beliefs led him into many right-wing political and paramilitary organizations of the time, forerunners of the Nazi Party.|$|E
25|$|Coincidentally, when Aung San Suu Kyi {{returned}} to Burma in 1988, the long-time military leader of Burma {{and head of}} the ruling party, General Ne Win, stepped down. Mass demonstrations for democracy followed that event on 8 August 1988 (8–8–88, a day seen as auspicious), which were violently suppressed in what {{came to be known as}} the 8888 Uprising. On 26 August 1988, she addressed half a million people at a mass rally in front of the Shwedagon Pagoda in the capital, calling for <b>a</b> <b>democratic</b> <b>government.</b> However, in September, a new military junta took power.|$|E
25|$|The Mongolians divided {{themselves}} into three groups: Danzan, Losol, and Dendev left for Omsk; Bodoo and Dogsom returned to Urga, {{where they were}} to enlarge the party's membership and form an army; Sükhbaatar and Choibalsan proceeded to Irkutsk {{to serve as a}} communication link between the others. Before separating, the group drafted a new appeal with a more revolutionary message: The Mongolian nobility would be divested of its hereditary power, to be replaced by <b>a</b> <b>democratic</b> <b>government</b> headed by the Bogd Khaan as a limited monarch. The document also contained a request for immediate military assistance.|$|E

25|$|On 11 October 2002, President Bush's {{senior adviser}} on the Middle East, Zalmay Khalilzad, {{released}} U.S. government plans {{to establish an}} American-led military administration in Iraq, as in post-war Germany and Japan, which could last for several years {{after the fall of}} Saddam. In the run-up to the invasion, the U.S. promised a speedy transition to <b>a</b> <b>democratic</b> <b>government,</b> as well as the creation of an Iraqi constitution, and the active role of Iraqis in the establishment of an interim authority and new government.

25|$|Aeschylus {{continued}} {{his emphasis on}} the polis with The Suppliants in 463 BC (Hiketides), which pays tribute to the democratic undercurrents running through Athens {{in advance of the}} establishment of <b>a</b> <b>democratic</b> <b>government</b> in 461. In the play, the Danaids, the fifty daughters of Danaus, founder of Argos, flee a forced marriage to their cousins in Egypt. They turn to King Pelasgus of Argos for protection, but Pelasgus refuses until the people of Argos weigh in on the decision, a distinctly democratic move {{on the part of the}} king. The people decide that the Danaids deserve protection, and they are allowed within the walls of Argos despite Egyptian protests.|$|E
25|$|During {{the period}} between the two world wars, {{democracy}} thrived in Czechoslovakia. Of all the new states established in central Europe after 1918, only Czechoslovakia preserved <b>a</b> <b>democratic</b> <b>government</b> until the war broke out. The persistence of democracy suggests that Czechoslovakia was better prepared to maintain democracy than were {{other countries in the}} region. Thus, despite regional disparities, its level of development was much higher than that of neighboring states. The population was generally literate, and contained fewer alienated groups. The influence of these conditions was augmented by the political values of Czechoslovakia's leaders and the policies they adopted. Under Tomas Masaryk, Czech and Slovak politicians promoted progressive social and economic conditions that served to defuse discontent.|$|E
