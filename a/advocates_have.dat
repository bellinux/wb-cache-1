5|$|Since the mid-1990s, {{gun control}} <b>advocates</b> <b>have</b> voiced {{concern over the}} {{perceived}} loophole in legislation, and campaigned to require background checks and record-keeping for all gun sales. Contrarily, gun rights <b>advocates</b> <b>have</b> stated {{that there is no}} loophole, that current laws provide a single, uniform set of rules for commercial gun sellers regardless of the place of sale, and that no part of the United States Constitution empowers the federal government to regulate non-commercial, intrastate transfers of legal firearms types between private citizens.|$|E
5|$|Several {{anti-noise}} {{and electric}} car <b>advocates</b> <b>have</b> opposed {{the introduction of}} artificial sounds as warning for pedestrians, as {{they argue that the}} proposed system will only increase noise pollution. They also opposed U.S. pending legislation that would require generated warning sounds with no off switch for the driver.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} 1874, Smetana {{had become}} {{completely}} deaf but, freed from his theatre duties and the related controversies, he began a period of sustained composition that continued for almost {{the rest of his}} life. His contributions to Czech music were increasingly recognised and honoured, but a mental collapse early in 1884 led to his incarceration in an asylum and subsequent death. Smetana's reputation as the founding father of Czech music has endured in his native country, where <b>advocates</b> <b>have</b> raised his status above that of his contemporaries and successors. However, relatively few of Smetana's works are in the international repertory, and most foreign commentators tend to regard Antonín Dvořák as a more significant Czech composer.|$|E

5|$|Since the Links' deployment, {{there have}} been several {{concerns}} about the kiosks' features. Privacy <b>advocates</b> <b>have</b> stated that the data of LinkNYC users can be collected and used to track users' movements throughout the city. There are also concerns with cybercriminals possibly hijacking the Links, or renaming their personal wireless networks to the same name as LinkNYC's network, in order to steal LinkNYC users' data. In addition, prior to September 2016, the tablets of the Links could be used to browse the Internet. In summer 2016, concerns arose about the Link tablets' browsers being used for illicit purposes; despite the implementation of content filters on the kiosks, the illicit activities continued, and the browsers were disabled.|$|E
5|$|O'Shaughnessy Dam {{has been}} {{controversial}} since its original construction both for its environmental impact and {{violations of the}} Raker Act {{by the city of}} San Francisco. Although the Raker Act explicitly stated that power and water from the Hetch Hetchy Project could be used only for public purposes, San Francisco has sold Hetch Hetchy power to Pacific Gas & Electric (PG) since 1925. Dam removal <b>advocates</b> <b>have</b> stated that San Francisco's utilization of Yosemite National Park for water and power is unfair because of the damage to tourism and the local environment caused by the dam and reservoir. By draining the reservoir, removing the dam and restoring the valley to its original state, visitors to the park would once again be able to enjoy the natural beauty of Hetch Hetchy – once compared to that of Yosemite Valley. There are other rivers and reservoirs available for San Francisco to replace the water supply, such as the city's currently unused share of water in Lake Don Pedro, the biggest reservoir on the Tuolumne River.|$|E
5|$|Also in 1994, United States Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt first {{proposed}} {{the removal of}} several Pacific Northwest dams because of their impact on salmon spawning. The Northwest Power Planning Council approved a plan that provided more water for fish and less for electricity, irrigation, and transportation. Environmental <b>advocates</b> <b>have</b> called {{for the removal of}} certain dams in the Columbia system in the years since. Of the 227major dams in the Columbia River drainage basin, the four Washington dams on the lower Snake River are often identified for removal, for example in an ongoing lawsuit concerning a Bush administration plan for salmon recovery. These dams and reservoirs limit the recovery of upriver salmon runs to Idaho's Salmon and Clearwater rivers. Historically, the Snake produced over 1.5million spring and summer Chinook salmon, a number that has dwindled to several thousand in recent years. Idaho Power Company's Hells Canyon dams have no fish ladders (and do not pass juvenile salmon downstream), and thus allow no steelhead or salmon to migrate above Hells Canyon. In 2007, the destruction of the Marmot Dam on the Sandy River was the first dam removal in the system. Other Columbia Basin dams that have been removed include Condit Dam on Washington's White Salmon River, and the Milltown Dam on the Clark Fork in Montana.|$|E
