5|$|Campbell died in 1971 {{at the age}} of 61 in Mountainside, New Jersey. At {{the time}} of his sudden death after 34 years <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>helm</b> <b>of</b> Analog, Campbell's quirky {{personality}} and eccentric editorial demands had alienated a number of his most illustrious writers {{to the point that they}} no longer submitted works to him.|$|E

5|$|If Wilde's period <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>helm</b> <b>of</b> the {{magazine}} was a mixed success from an organizational point of view, one can also argue that it {{played a pivotal role}} in his development as a writer and facilitated his ascent to fame. Whilst Wilde the journalist supplied articles under the guidance of his editors, Wilde the editor is forced to learn to manipulate the literary marketplace on his own terms.|$|E

5|$|During the 1950s, Tung was a {{high-ranking}} official in Nhu's Cần Lao, a secret political apparatus which maintained the Ngô family's grip on power, extorting money from wealthy businessmen. In 1960, Tung was promoted {{directly to the}} rank of colonel and became the commander of the special forces. His period <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>helm</b> <b>of</b> South Vietnam's elite troops was noted mostly for his work in repressing dissidents, rather than fighting the Viet Cong insurgents. His best-known attack was the raid on Xá Lợi pagoda on 21 August 1963, in which hundreds died or disappeared.|$|E
5|$|Hector Macdonald Laws (Hec) Waller, DSO and Bar (4 April 1900– 1 March 1942) was {{a senior}} officer in the Royal Australian Navy (RAN). His career spanned almost thirty years, {{including}} service in both world wars. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>helm</b> <b>of</b> HMAS Stuart in the Mediterranean from 1939 to 1941, he won recognition as a skilful ship's captain and flotilla commander. He then transferred to the South West Pacific as captain of the light cruiser HMAS Perth, and went down with his ship against heavy odds during the Battle of Sunda Strait in early 1942.|$|E
2500|$|This was {{the first}} World Series in 22 years to have two {{previous}} World Series-winning managers facing each other, but <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>helms</b> <b>of</b> new teams. As previously mentioned, Leyland previously won the 1997 World Series with the Florida Marlins, and La Russa won the 1989 World Series with the Oakland Athletics.

60|$|The crew {{looked on}} in moody silence. They knew {{that their lives}} were imperilled, but they {{felt that they had}} no resource.

Towards morning, he steered out from among the {{dangerous}} coral reefs and ran south, straight before the wind.|$|R
40|$|This work {{tries to}} {{describe}} graphically {{the consolidation of}} a social myth in the unsettled Mediterranean of the 16 th century, through a personage: the Spanish convert to Islam Hassan Aga (Azan Aga), the Sardinian renegade who succeeded Hayreddin Barbarrosa <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>helms</b> <b>of</b> Algiers from 1533 till his death ten years later. This {{was a period of}} intense activity, with the climax that came with the expedition of Charles to Algiers in 1541, whose spectacular defeat can be considered as the principal nucleus of the myth of this popular personage who as a Sardinian slave came to defeat the Emperor. A myth of social ascension with maquiavelical profiles of a new prince of the frontiers. </p...|$|R
5|$|In 2000, McMullen {{sold the}} team to Puck Holdings, an {{affiliate}} of YankeeNets, for $176million. The owners wanted to program Devils games on what eventually became the YES Network and move {{the team to}} a new arena in Newark. Neither of these proposals became reality under Puck Holdings' ownership. For {{the start of the}} next season, Lamoriello was appointed CEO of both the Devils and the New Jersey Nets National Basketball Association team. He remained <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>helm</b> <b>of</b> the basketball team until it was sold with the intention of moving it to Brooklyn in 2004.|$|E
5|$|Later {{the same}} month, Barcelona won the UEFA Super Cup after {{defeating}} Porto 2–0 thanks to goals from Lionel Messi and Cesc Fàbregas. This extended the club's overall number of official trophies to 74, surpassing Real Madrid's {{total amount of}} official trophies. The Super Cup victory also marked another impressive achievement as Pep Guardiola won his 12th trophy out of 15 possible in only three years <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>helm</b> <b>of</b> the club, becoming the all-time record holder of most titles won as a coach at Barcelona.|$|E
5|$|Marcello Lippi {{took over}} as Juventus manager {{at the start of}} the 1994–95 campaign. His first season <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>helm</b> <b>of</b> the club was a {{successful}} one, as Juventus recorded their first Serie A championship title since the mid-1980s, as well as the Coppa Italia. The crop of players during this period featured Ciro Ferrara, Roberto Baggio, Gianluca Vialli and a young Alessandro Del Piero. Lippi led Juventus to their first Supercoppa Italiana and the Champions League the following season, beating Ajax on penalties after a 1–1 draw in which Fabrizio Ravanelli scored for Juventus.|$|E
25|$|Elefante {{was hired}} by Pamplin Records in 1998, working with Dino to {{generate}} artist development.

50|$|Notwithstanding {{his victory}} {{in the house of}} {{assembly}} election, events took a different dimension in 2009 when a court of appeal nullified his election on the ground that a logo of one of the political parties in the election was excluded from the ballot papers, in gross violation of the electoral laws. The Court of Appeal ordered for a fresh election and <b>at</b> <b>the</b> end of the exercise, a candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, a party <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>helms</b> <b>of</b> affairs in <b>the</b> state <b>at</b> that time, was declared winner of the new election. Owing to his wide popularity, political acceptability and followership in the whole of Ejigbo, Salaam was said to have been curried by the ruling party, but he was said to have remained resolute to the ideals of his political party.|$|R
5|$|The Crimson Tide {{scored on}} its next two {{possessions}} as well, and McCarron completed touchdown passes to running backs Kenyan Drake and Jalston Fowler. With the lead at 35–0 {{late in the}} second quarter, Alabama played its reserves {{for much of the}} remainder of the game. After the Crimson Tide defense forced another punt from the Panthers, McCarron was replaced by backup quarterback Blake Sims. On his first possession <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>helm</b> <b>of</b> Alabama's offense, Sims led the team to the Georgia State one-yard line, but a pair of false starts forced Alabama to settle for a field goal that increased the lead to 38–0 at halftime.|$|E
5|$|Tommy Amaker {{inherited}} {{a team that}} imposed sanctions on itself after his first year <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>helm</b> <b>of</b> the program. Nonetheless, he coached the team to the postseason three times including both an NIT championship in 2004 and a runner-up finish in 2006. During the 2005–06, when the team compiled a 22–11 overall (8–8, Big Ten) record, he led them to their first national ranking in eight years {{when they reached the}} #20 position. Despite his successes, the team never won a Big Ten Championship and never made the NCAA tournament, which led to his firing after six seasons.|$|E
5|$|Although Blažević {{continued}} his tenure {{in spite of}} failure to qualify for Euro 2000, he resigned in October 2000 following draws against Belgium and Scotland {{in the first two}} games of the 2002 World Cup qualifiers. His successor <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>helm</b> <b>of</b> the national team was Mirko Jozić, who previously led the Yugoslavia under-20 team to a World Cup triumph in 1987. Despite the retirement of many Golden Generation players, Croatia went unbeaten during the rest of the qualifiers. They opened their 2002 World Cup campaign with a narrow loss to Mexico before producing a surprise 2–1 victory over Euro 2000 finalists Italy in the next fixture, giving life to hopes of passing through to the knockout stage. However, they lost their final group fixture to Ecuador and were eliminated. Jozić then resigned, and was replaced in July 2002 by Croatian-Austrian Otto Barić, the team's first manager born outside the Balkans.|$|E
5000|$|Coach Schmidt's {{departure}} {{after the}} 1934 SWC championship season {{was followed by}} a 16-year draught for TCU basketball. Legendary TCU football coach Dutch Meyer fared far better leading the Frogs' football team, where he claimed two national championships, in 1935 and 1938, and three SWC football titles over his 19 year football-coaching tenure, than he did in his three seasons <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>helms</b> <b>of</b> TCU basketball. Meyer's basketball record from 1934 through 1937 totaled on 10-37 (5-31 SWC). [...] Meyer was replaced by former TCU basketball and football player Mike Brumbelow, who managed only two SWC wins over the following four seasons, with an overall record of 22-64 (2-46 SWC). Brumbelow was quickly replaced by Hub McQuillan, who led the Frogs to middle-of-the-league finishes in the first 5 of his 7 years as head coach of TCU basketball.|$|R

5|$|Beadles {{left the}} club in April 1929 due to a {{persistent}} knee injury, scoring a hat-trick in his final ever game in the Football League, a 6–2 victory over Hartlepool United on 27 April 1929. During his time with Southport, Beadles scored 61 goals in 92 league matches. Following his departure from Southport, he was appointed player-coach at Irish side Dundalk, making his debut on 25 August 1929 in a match against Shamrock Rovers. In his one season <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>helm</b> <b>of</b> the club, he {{led them to the}} semi-final of the FAI Cup, losing 2–1 to Brideville, a sixth-placed finish in the League of Ireland and handed first-team opportunities to Joey Donnelly and Tommy Godwin. However, he retired from football {{at the end of the}} season after persistent injuries and his family being unable to settle in Ireland.|$|E
5|$|Despite his successes, al-Mu'tadid's reign was {{ultimately}} {{too short to}} effect a lasting reversal of the Caliphate's fortunes, and the revival that he spearheaded was too dependent {{on the presence of}} capable personalities <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>helm</b> <b>of</b> the state. The brief reign of his less able son and heir, al-Muktafi, still saw some major gains, notably the annexation of the Tulunid domains, but his later successors lacked his energy, and new enemies appeared {{in the form of the}} Qarmatians. In addition, the factionalism within the bureaucracy, that had become apparent during the later years of al-Mu'tadid's reign, would debilitate the Abbasid government for decades to come, eventually leading to the subjugation of the Caliphate to a series of military strongmen and culminating in the conquest of Baghdad by the Buyids in 946.|$|E
5|$|In 1987, Stein {{coached the}} Rockledge High School {{baseball}} team, leading them a district title with a 17–11 record. Stein {{was hired as}} {{the manager of the}} Class A-Short Season Little Falls Mets of the New York–Penn League in 1988. Little Falls were minor league affiliates of the New York Mets. In his first professional season as a manager, Stein led Little Falls to a 39–36 record. Stein commented that when he became a manager it was difficult to learn pitching after all the years of being a position player. In 1989, the New York Mets fired Butch Hobson, the manager of the Class-A Columbia Mets, and promoted Stein to that position. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>helm</b> <b>of</b> Colombia that year, Stein led them to a 73–67 record. He also served as a player-coach with the Orlando Juice of the Senior Professional Baseball Association in 1989.|$|E

5|$|In {{the wake}} of the British victory at Second Battle of El Alamein in November 1942, and other {{military}} reverses, the Propaganda Ministry directed the media to emphasise Rommel's invincibility. The charade was maintained until the spring of 1943, even as the German situation in Africa became increasingly precarious. In May 1943, to ensure that the inevitable defeat in Africa would not be associated with Rommel's name, Goebbels had the Supreme High Command announce that Rommel was on a two-month leave for health reasons. Instead, the campaign was presented by Berndt, who resumed his role in the Propaganda Ministry, as a ruse to tie down the British Empire while Germany was turning Europe into an impenetrable fortress, with Rommel <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>helm</b> <b>of</b> this success. After the radio program ran in May 1943, Rommel sent Berndt a case of cigars as a sign of his gratitude.|$|E
5|$|Selke {{retired in}} 1964 and was succeeded by Sam Pollock. Often named the best general manager in NHL history, Pollock led the Canadiens to nine Stanley Cup championships in his 14 years <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>helm</b> <b>of</b> the team. One of his key tactics was trading aging stars to {{expansion}} teams for draft picks, {{which led to}} the team drafting future Hall of Famers Guy Lafleur, Larry Robinson and Ken Dryden. The Canadiens won consecutive titles in 1965 and 1966, and entered the 1967 Stanley Cup Final against Toronto as a heavy favourite. The City of Montreal was so confident in the Canadiens that they had already built a space for the Stanley Cup on the Expo 67 site, but the Canadiens fell to the Maple Leafs, in the last NHL finals of the Original Six era.|$|E
5|$|In January 2011, Gannon was one {{of three}} {{candidates}} reported to have impressed in interviews for the vacant Port Vale job, making him one of the favourites for the position. However, Paul Simpson's dismissal at Stockport County led to hopes of a return to the club for some County fans. Therefore, he was installed as the bookies favourite to become the next Port Vale manager, and also the bookie's favourite for the Stockport job. Gannon was confirmed as the manager of Port Vale on 6 January 2011, succeeding Micky Adams <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>helm</b> <b>of</b> the promotion chasing club, signing a contract that lasted until summer 2012. Saying that finishing outside of the top seven would be a failure, the Cheshire-based manager's first task after 'burying the hatchet' with Gareth Owen was to look for a new striker. Two weeks into his reign club captain Tommy Fraser left the club by mutual consent, as signs of what would be an unhappy relationship between club and manager quickly came to the surface. Gannon then brought in Romaine Sawyers and Kayleden Brown on loan from West Bromwich Albion, Jay O'Shea on loan from Birmingham City, Exodus Geohaghon on loan from Peterborough United, and striker Tom Pope on loan from Rotherham United.|$|E

50|$|Austin Peay {{head coach}} James Donnelly {{was hired as}} MTSU's head coach in 1979. Under his leadership, the MTSU {{football}} program compiled a record of 133-80-1.

Of his 20 seasons <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>helm,</b> 15 <b>of</b> them were winning seasons (including 12 in a row) and four of them were seasons of at least 10 wins.

5000|$|In 1919/20 Luque {{became a}} playing manager for Almendares {{and led the}} team to a {{championship}} {{in his first season}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>helm,</b> <b>the</b> first <b>of</b> seven championships as a manager. He contributed on the pitching mound with a 10-4 record, leading the league in wins. In 1922/23 he moved to Habana (where Miguel Angel González was manager) and again led the league in wins with an 11-9 record. The next season, he took over <b>the</b> <b>helm</b> as Habana's manager and went 7-2 as a pitcher. Later in the decade, Luque's Major League team, the Cincinnati Reds, did not allow him to play winter baseball in Cuba. Luque sometimes evaded the ban by playing under assumed names.|$|R
