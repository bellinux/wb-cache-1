40|$|<b>Arteflene</b> is a {{synthetic}} endoperoxide antimalarial. Its peroxide bridge undergoes iron(II) -mediated reduction in vitro which yields a carbon-centered cyclohexyl radical and {{a mixture of}} cis- and trans-alpha,beta-unsaturated ketones (enones). The enones are biliary metabolites in rats and therefore surrogate markers of bioactivation. <b>Arteflene</b> {{is reported to be}} more cytotoxic to primary rat hepatocytes than some non-endoperoxide antimalarials. Hepatic metabolism of <b>arteflene</b> was investigated in recirculating isolated perfused rat livers, and the drug's metabolism and cytotoxicity were compared using hepatocytes from male rats. Both preparations metabolized [C- 14]arteflene to cis- and trans-[C- 14]enone, 8 -hydroxyarteflene glucuronide and an unassigned isomeric glucuronide. During a 2 h liver perfusion, the cis- and trans-enones recovered in bile represented 8. 1 +/- 3. 4 and 11. 3 +/- 4. 6 % (mean +/- S. D., N = 6), respectively, of the [C- 14]arteflene (52 muM) added to the perfusate. After a 3 h incubation of [C- 14]arteflene (10 muM) with hepatocytes in suspension, the cis- and trans-enones comprised, respectively, 14. 8 +/- 7. 1 and 2. 1 +/- 1. 0 % (N = 4) of the recovered radioactivity; the corresponding data for cultured hepatocytes being 18. 6 +/- 6. 9 and 3. 3 +/- 2. 2 %. <b>Arteflene</b> was significantly (P 50 muM for 24 h. Cellular glutathione was depleted under these conditions. Therefore <b>arteflene</b> was acutely cytotoxic, though only at relatively high concentrations, when it was metabolized via a pathway which generates carbon-centered radicals.

40|$|The {{in vitro}} {{potentiation}} of artemisinin by synthetic manganese porphyrin complexes has been recently reported (F. Benoit-Vical, A. Robert, and B. Meunier, Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 43 : 2555 – 2558, 1999). Since {{the activity of}} artemisinin and synthetic antimalarial endoperoxides is related to their interaction with heme (S. R. Meshnick, A. Thomas, A. Ranz, C. M. Xu, and H. Z. Pan, Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 49 : 181 – 190, 1991), an improvement of their efficiency may be expected {{in the presence of}} a synthetic metalloporphyrin having the same activating role as endogenous heme. With the aim to boost the activity of antimalarial endoperoxide drugs, we were thus led to evaluate the in vitro and in vivo potentiation of natural and synthetic drugs of this family by a nontoxic and cheap metalloporphyrin. The potentiation of artemisinin, β-artemether, and <b>arteflene</b> (Ro 42 - 1611) by synthetic heme models is reported. In vitro studies on the chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium falciparum FcB 1 -Columbia strain indicate a synergistic effect of the manganese complex of meso-tetrakis(4 -sulfonatophenylporphyrin) (Mn-TPPS) on the activity of artemisinin or β-artemether, whereas this heme model has no influence on the activity of <b>arteflene.</b> A significant synergistic effect on rodent malaria was also observed in vivo between artemisinin and Mn-TPPS using Plasmodium vinckei petteri strain...|$|E

40|$|The endoperoxides are a {{new class}} of {{antimalarial}} agents, of which artemisinin (qinghaosu) is the prototype. We have previously shown that artemisinin is capable of alkylating proteins in model reactions. In the present study, we showed that when Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes are treated with a radiolabeled antimalarial endoperoxide, either arteether, dihydroartemisinin, or Ro 42 - 1611 (<b>arteflene),</b> the radioactivity is largely coverted into a form which can be extracted with sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). Autoradiograms of SDS-polyacrylamide gels showed that six malarial proteins are radioactively labeled by the three endoperoxides. This labeling occurs at physiological concentrations of drug and is not stage nor strain specific. The labeled proteins were not the most abundant proteins seen on Coomassie-stained gels. No proteins were labeled when uninfected erythrocytes were treated with these drugs, nor when infected erythrocytes were treated with the inactive analog deoxyarteether. Thus, the antimalarial endoperoxides appear to react with specific malarial proteins...|$|E
