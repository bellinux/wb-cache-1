5|$|In March 1975, Rowland {{was raised}} to <b>air</b> <b>marshal</b> and took over from <b>Air</b> <b>Marshal</b> Charles Read as CAS, {{becoming}} the first appointee to the position who had joined the RAAF after the commencement of World WarII. He {{was also the first}} engineering officer to lead the RAAF, and was selected over a more senior air vice marshal through the personal influence of the Defence Secretary, Sir Arthur Tange. The CAS was nevertheless required {{to be a member of}} the Air Force's aircrew stream so Rowland, still a qualified pilot, had to transfer from the Technical Branch to the General Duties Branch. Soon afterwards, the stipulation for the CAS to be a member of the General Duties Branch was removed.|$|E
5|$|Read's post-war {{commands}} {{included the}} Australian First Tactical Air Force, No. 24 (Commonwealth) Squadron RAF, Central Flying School and No. 82 (Bomber) Wing. He {{was awarded the}} Air Force Cross in 1960. Following staff roles, Read took charge of RAAF Base Point Cook and the RAAF Academy in the mid-1960s, and later RAAF Base Richmond. In 1970 {{he was promoted to}} air vice marshal and became Deputy Chief of the Air Staff. He succeeded <b>Air</b> <b>Marshal</b> Sir Colin Hannah as CAS in March 1972, when the latter cut short his term as head of the Air Force to become Governor of Queensland. <b>Air</b> <b>Marshal</b> Read retired from the military in March 1975 and was knighted the following year.|$|E
50|$|There were {{issues with}} Federal <b>Air</b> <b>Marshals</b> and early VIPR deployments. TSA field {{officials}} said the initial exercises put their safety at risk. TSA required Federal <b>Air</b> <b>Marshals</b> to wear raid jackets or shirts identifying them as <b>air</b> <b>marshals,</b> which potentially compromised their anonymity. In response to this concern, TSA changed the policy; Federal <b>Air</b> <b>Marshals</b> now attend VIPR exercises in civilian clothes or jackets that simply identify them as DHS officials. Some transit security officials reported that Federal <b>Air</b> <b>Marshals</b> were unfamiliar with local laws, local police procedures, the range of behavior encountered on public transportation, and the parameters of their authority as federal law enforcement officers. In 2011 Amtrak temporarily banned VIPR teams from its property after screenings at the Savannah, Georgia station that Amtrak police chief John O'Conner called illegal and violations of Amtrak policy.|$|R
50|$|A small {{force of}} Federal <b>Air</b> <b>Marshals</b> were {{retained}} at the FAA starting in 1974. The personnel trained under {{this program was}} limited to 10-12 persons.

5|$|The Zimbabwe Defence Forces {{were set}} up by unifying three insurrectionist forces – the Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army (ZANLA), the Zimbabwe People's Revolutionary Army (ZIPRA), and the Rhodesian Security Forces (RSF) – after the Second Chimurenga and Zimbabwean {{independence}} in 1980. The integration period saw the formation of The Zimbabwe National Army (ZNA) and Air Force of Zimbabwe (AFZ) as separate entities {{under the command of}} Rtd General Solomon Mujuru and <b>Air</b> <b>Marshal</b> Norman Walsh who retired in 1982, and was replaced by <b>Air</b> <b>Marshal</b> Azim Daudpota who handed over command to the late Rtd Air Chief Marshal Josiah Tungamirai in 1985.|$|E
5|$|Appointed AOC Coastal Command {{with the}} acting rank of <b>air</b> <b>marshal</b> on 5 February 1943, Slessor had at his {{disposal}} sixty squadrons, two of which were equipped with B-24 Liberator heavy bombers. He was credited with doing much to turn the tide of the Battle of the Atlantic in the Allies' favour by employing his thinly stretched long-range bomber force against the U-boat threat, in close cooperation with naval forces. Promoted temporary <b>air</b> <b>marshal</b> on 1 June 1943, he was advanced to Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in the 1943 Birthday Honours. Slessor became Commander-in-Chief RAF Mediterranean and Middle East in January 1944, and deputy to Lieutenant General Ira Eaker as Commander-in-Chief Mediterranean Allied Air Forces. In this role he conducted operations in the Italian Campaign and Yugoslavia, establishing the Balkan Air Force in the latter theatre. Slessor joined the Air Council as Air Member for Personnel on 5 April 1945. His rank of <b>air</b> <b>marshal</b> became substantive on 6 June. He was awarded the Grand Cross of the Greek Order of the Phoenix on 6 September 1946. His war service also earned him appointment as a Commander of the Belgian Order of Leopold on 27 August 1948, and a Knight Grand Cross of the Norwegian Order of St. Olav on 6 March 1953.|$|E
5|$|From April to June 1966, the 2/9 Marines {{were caught}} in crossfire of the Buddhist Uprising, when much of the forces of I Corps rebelled against Prime Minister and <b>Air</b> <b>Marshal</b> Nguyen Cao Ky, {{the head of the}} ruling junta, who had {{dismissed}} their commander, General Nguyen Chanh Thi.|$|E

5|$|The Federal {{government}} retired <b>Air</b> <b>Marshal</b> Jones in 1952 {{and replaced}} him with <b>Air</b> <b>Marshal</b> Donald Hardman, RAF, who proceeded to re-organise the RAAF command-and-control system along functional lines, establishing Home (operational), Training, and Maintenance Commands in October 1953. The first was re-formed from Eastern Area Command {{as it was}} considered the RAAF's de facto operational organisation. The second was re-formed from Southern Area Command, {{as it was the}} hub of training services, controlling those in New South Wales and Queensland as well as Victoria and South Australia. The third and last functional command was formed from the extant Maintenance Group headquarters in Melbourne. The transition to a functional system was completed in February 1954, when the three new commands assumed control of operations, training and maintenance from Western, North-Western, and North-Eastern Areas.|$|E
5|$|Against {{his wishes}} Braham was rested from {{operations}} and posted from No 141 Squadron on 1 October 1943 {{to attend a}} staff officer course at Camberley. Braham resisted the move {{as much as he}} could. He complained directly to <b>Air</b> <b>Marshal</b> Roderick Hill, commanding Fighter Command at that time. Hill refused to countenance Braham's request and denied his plea for one last operation. Within days Braham was posted to No. 9 Group RAF.|$|E

50|$|The officer {{appointed}} {{to command the}} Royal Thai Air Force has been promoted {{to the rank of}} <b>air</b> chief <b>marshal</b> (พลอากาศเอก, Phon Akat Ek) since c. 1950. From 1950 to 2012 there have been 18 Royal Thai Air Force commanders who have held the rank. The present commander is <b>Air</b> Chief <b>Marshal</b> Prachin Chantong who is supported by the Deputy Commander-in-Chief (currently <b>Air</b> Chief <b>Marshal</b> Kanaphan Sanguansat) and the Assistant Commander-in-Chief (currently <b>Air</b> Chief <b>Marshal</b> M.L. Suthirat Kasemsan). In the event that an air force officer is {{appointed to}} the position of Chief of Defence Forces (formerly Supreme Commander), then he has always held the rank of <b>air</b> chief <b>marshal.</b> The last <b>air</b> chief <b>marshal</b> to be appointed Supreme Commander was <b>Air</b> Chief <b>Marshal</b> Voranat Aphichari who retired in 1994.|$|R
5|$|<b>Air</b> <b>Marshal</b> David Evans, AC, DSO, AFC (born Selwyn David Evans on 3June 1925) is {{a retired}} senior {{commander}} of the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF), and a writer and consultant on defence matters. He served as Chief of the Air Staff from 1982 until 1985. Since leaving the RAAF he has published two military treatises, A Fatal Rivalry: Australia's Defence at Risk and War: A Matter of Principles, {{as well as an}} autobiography.|$|E
5|$|An inquiry {{was held}} into {{widening}} the section from the Archway intersection to the Hornsey Lane Bridge to a three lane dual carriageway in 1969 and work started in 1971. It was {{originally intended to}} widen a further section of the road, but severe disruption led to the first inquiry being abandoned in 1978, and a second inquiry in 1984, chaired by <b>Air</b> <b>Marshal</b> Sir Michael Giddings, was also abandoned. The traffic flow was projected to increase to 180,000 cars a day by 1981, but by 1986 the actual flow was only 30,000 a day.|$|E
5|$|Newham {{completed}} {{his tenure as}} CAS on 3July 1987 and was succeeded by <b>Air</b> <b>Marshal</b> Ray Funnell. Retiring from the Air Force, he became Director of Helitech Industries. On 23July 1998, he was among those present when the Korean Ambassador to Australia awarded his government's Presidential Unit Citation to No.77 Squadron. Newham was one of ten surviving veterans of the squadron belatedly presented with the US Air Medal in Canberra on 27June 2011, for meritorious service in the Korean War.|$|E

5|$|Six {{days after}} {{large-scale}} fighting in Đồng Xoài had concluded {{there was another}} change of government in Saigon. South Vietnamese <b>Air</b> <b>Marshal</b> Nguyễn Cao Kỳ was appointed prime minister and executive chairman of the government by the military junta, and General Nguyễn Văn Thiệu became a figurehead president. Unlike previous leaders, Air-Marshal Kỳ and General Thiệu {{were more interested in}} fighting the Communists, and they intended to stop the Buddhist factions from interfering with their decision-making processes. However, due to <b>Air</b> <b>Marshal</b> Kỳ's lack of experience in civil government, the Americans were not entirely pleased with the formation of a new government with him as the leader. In contrast, General Thiệu's appointment to the office of president was considered to be a positive development by the American Embassy and military command, because he possessed the political skills required by Saigon’s political establishment. Nonetheless, Kỳ's ascension to the position of prime minister had effectively ended the cycle of military coups which had plagued Saigon since the downfall of Ngô Đình Diệm.|$|E
5|$|The Allied {{order of}} battle {{involved}} all the major commands in the area at the time. The Supreme Allied Air Force Command was the Mediterranean Air Command (MAD) under Air Chief Marshal Arthur Tedder. Below the supreme command were the sector organisations, the Northwest African Air Forces (NAAF) commanded by Carl Spaatz. Directly subordinated to Spaatz was the Northwest African Strategic Air Force (NASAF) under James H. Doolittle. The second command was the operational/tactical force, the Northwest African Tactical Air Force (NATAF) under <b>Air</b> <b>Marshal</b> Arthur Coningham.|$|E
5|$|The Operations Research Section (ORS) {{was also}} set up {{in light of the}} success of such {{programs}} in Fighter and Bomber Commands. Many scientists were appointed to the ORS Coastal Command. Some acted as advisors to <b>Air</b> <b>Marshal</b> Bowhill. Four sections were set up; planned flying and maintenance, ASO, A/S, and weather and navigation. Resources were spread evenly. However, A/S received more attention. The rest did not receive close attention until 1943, when the U-boats had been contained and a certain degree of ascendancy achieved.|$|E

Among other questions, they were attempting to find out what training Abdulmutallab received, who else (if anyone) was in the training program, were others preparing to launch similar attacks, was the attack part of a larger plot, was it a test run, and who assisted him.|$|E
5|$|<b>Air</b> <b>Marshal</b> Murdoch led the RAAF {{through the}} {{build-up}} of Australia's {{commitment to the}} Vietnam War beginning in the mid-1960s. He clashed with the Chief of the General Staff (CGS), Lieutenant General Sir John Wilton, over the latter's recommendation in mid-1965 to deploy two UH-1 Iroquois helicopters to Vietnam. Wilton believed that both services would benefit from gaining familiarisation with air/ground operations in the region before large-scale commitment of Australian forces. Murdoch dismissed the idea on resourcing grounds, {{despite the fact that}} two-thirds of the RAAF's UH-1 complement had been purchased {{for the express purpose of}} army cooperation.|$|E
5|$|<b>Air</b> <b>Marshal</b> Philip Joubert de la Ferté, {{commander-in-chief}} of RAF Coastal Command agreed {{this was}} the probable route. He expected the Germans to make an attempt anytime after the 10 February. Unfortunately, the Air Ministry and the three RAF commands, RAF Coastal Command, RAF Bomber Command and RAF Fighter Command, believed the Germans would use the darkness for the longest and most dangerous {{part of the journey}} through the straits and would leave in daylight. The far from adequate forces at their disposal, they believed, would be best used at night. Most of RAF Bomber Command was ordered to stand down accordingly. Such an order made it totally unprepared to strike in daylight hours on 12 February.|$|E
