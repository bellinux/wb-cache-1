5|$|<b>Apomorphine,</b> a non-orally {{administered}} dopamine agonist, {{may be used}} {{to reduce}} off periods and dyskinesia in late PD. It is administered by intermittent injections or continuous subcutaneous infusions. Since secondary effects such as confusion and hallucinations are common, individuals receiving <b>apomorphine</b> treatment should be closely monitored. Two dopamine agonists that are administered through skin patches (lisuride and rotigotine) and are useful for people in the initial stages and possibly to control off states in those in the advanced state.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} stage {{the aim is to}} reduce PD {{symptoms}} while controlling fluctuations in the effect of the medication. Sudden withdrawals from medication or overuse have to be managed. When oral medications are not enough to control symptoms, surgery, deep brain stimulation, subcutaneous waking day <b>apomorphine</b> infusion and enteral dopa pumps can be of use. The third stage presents many challenging problems requiring a variety of treatments for psychiatric symptoms, orthostatic hypotension, bladder dysfunction, etc. In the final stages of the disease, palliative care is provided to improve quality of life.|$|E
5|$|Nausea and {{vomiting}} are largely determined by {{activity in the}} area postrema in the medulla of the brainstem, in a region known as the chemoreceptor trigger zone. This area contains a large population of type D2 dopamine receptors. Consequently, drugs that activate D2 receptors have a high potential to cause nausea. This group includes some medications that are administered for Parkinson's disease, {{as well as other}} dopamine agonists such as <b>apomorphine.</b> In some cases, D2-receptor antagonists such as metoclopramide are useful as anti-nausea drugs.|$|E
5|$|Several {{dopamine}} agonists {{that bind}} to dopamine receptors {{in the brain}} have similar effects to levodopa. These were initially used as a complementary therapy to levodopa for individuals experiencing levodopa complications (on-off fluctuations and dyskinesias); they are now mainly used on their own as first therapy for the motor symptoms of PD with the aim of delaying the initiation of levodopa therapy and so delaying the onset of levodopa's complications. Dopamine agonists include bromocriptine, pergolide, pramipexole, ropinirole, piribedil, cabergoline, <b>apomorphine</b> and lisuride.|$|E
5|$|One area of {{clinical}} research {{is focused on}} treating the underlying disease pathology. Reduction of beta-amyloid levels is a common target of compounds (such as <b>apomorphine)</b> under investigation. Immunotherapy or vaccination for the amyloid protein is one treatment modality under study. Unlike preventative vaccination, the putative therapy {{would be used to}} treat people already diagnosed. It is based upon the concept of training the immune system to recognise, attack, and reverse deposition of amyloid, thereby altering the course of the disease. An example of such a vaccine under investigation was ACC-001, although the trials were suspended in 2008. Another similar agent is bapineuzumab, an antibody designed as identical to the naturally induced anti-amyloid antibody. However, immunotherapeutic agents have been found to cause some concerning adverse drug reactions, such as amyloid-related imaging abnormalities. Other approaches are neuroprotective agents, such as AL-108, and metal-protein interaction attenuation agents, such as PBT2. A TNFÎ± receptor-blocking fusion protein, etanercept has showed encouraging results.|$|E
25|$|<b>Apomorphine</b> is {{colourless}} as {{a liquid}} but stains green, therefore {{care must be}} taken to avoid splashes. <b>Apomorphine</b> does not remain stable for more than 24 hours in a plastic container, so syringes are discarded if not used within 24 hours.|$|E
25|$|<b>Apomorphine</b> has a {{vital part}} in Agatha Christie's detective story Sad Cypress.|$|E
25|$|<b>Apomorphine</b> is {{the drug}} of choice for {{inducing}} vomiting in dogs. It is used after ingestion of various toxins or foreign bodies.|$|E
25|$|Brain regions used in lesion {{models of}} {{schizophrenia}} include the prefrontal cortex, the hippocampal formation, and the thalamus. In rat models, lesions of the prefrontal cortex have produced increased and protracted response to stress {{and a lower}} prepulse inhibition of startle when treated with <b>apomorphine.</b>|$|E
25|$|Many {{individuals}} and groups, especially those within the mainstream medical profession, attempted {{to analyze the}} Keeley Cure for its ingredients and reports varied widely as to their identity. Strychnine, alcohol, <b>apomorphine,</b> willow bark, ammonia, and atropine were among the many suggested chemicals.|$|E
25|$|He {{goes on to}} {{lament the}} fact that as of his writing, little to no {{research}} has been done on <b>apomorphine</b> or variations of the drug to study its effects on curing addiction, and perhaps the possibility of retaining the positive effects while removing the side effect of vomiting.|$|E
25|$|After {{the main}} {{material}} follow three appendices in the British edition, the first explaining the title (as mentioned above) and two accounts of Burroughs' own {{drug abuse and}} treatment using <b>apomorphine.</b> Here Burroughs clearly states that he considers drug abuse a metabolic disease and writes about how he finally escaped it.|$|E
25|$|First {{used as a}} {{treatment}} for Parkinson's disease as early as 1951, its clinical use was first reported in 1970 by Cotzias et al., although its emetic properties and short half-life made oral use impractical. A later study found that combining the drug with the antiemetic domperidone improved results significantly. The commercialization of <b>apomorphine</b> for Parkinson's disease followed its successful use in patients with refractory motor fluctuations using intermittent rescue injections and continuous infusions.|$|E
25|$|Dopamine {{agonists}} in {{the brain}} have a similar effect to levodopa since they bind to dopaminergic postsynaptic receptors. Dopamine agonists were initially used for patients experiencing on-off fluctuations and dyskinesias as a complementary therapy to levodopa, but they are now mainly used on their own as an initial therapy for motor symptoms {{with the aim of}} delaying motor complications. When used in late PD, they are useful at reducing the off periods. Dopamine agonists include bromocriptine, pergolide, pramipexole, ropinirole, piribedil, cabergoline, <b>apomorphine,</b> and lisuride.|$|E
25|$|The structure-activity {{relationship}} of morphine {{has been extensively}} studied. As {{a result of the}} extensive study and use of this molecule, more than 250 morphine derivatives (also counting codeine and related drugs) have been developed since {{the last quarter of the}} 19th century. These drugs range from 25% the analgesic strength of codeine (or slightly more than 2% of the strength of morphine) to several thousand times the strength of morphine, to powerful opioid antagonists, including naloxone (Narcan), naltrexone (Trexan), diprenorphine (M5050, the reversing agent for the Immobilon dart) and nalorphine (Nalline). Some opioid agonist-antagonists, partial agonists, and inverse agonists are also derived from morphine. The receptor-activation profile of the semi-synthetic morphine derivatives varies widely and some, like <b>apomorphine</b> are devoid of narcotic effects.|$|E
25|$|The on-off {{phenomenon}} {{is an almost}} invariable consequence of sustained levodopa treatment in patients with Parkinson's disease. Phases of immobility and incapacity associated with depression alternate with jubilant thaws. Both pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic factors are involved in its pathogenesis, but evidence is presented to indicate the importance of levodopa handling has been underestimated and progressive reduction in the storage capacity of surviving nigrostriatal dopamine terminals is not a critical factor. Redistribution of levodopa dosage which may mean smaller, more frequent doses, or larger less frequent increments, may be helpful in controlling oscillations in some patients. Dietary protein restriction {{and the use of}} selegiline hydrochloride and bromocriptine may also temporarily improve motor fluctuations. New approaches to management include the use of subcutaneous <b>apomorphine,</b> controlled-release preparations of levodopa with a peripheral dopa decarboxylase inhibitor and the continuous intraduodenal administration of levodopa.|$|E
500|$|His {{concerns}} about social control and language led Burroughs to write {{at length about}} Scientology. He had been interested in [...] Scientology since the early 1960s, having been introduced to the concepts of its founder L. Ron Hubbard by artist Brion Gysin. Burroughs's early [...] novels emphasized the power of Scientology to combat a controlling society. For example, in both The Ticket That Exploded (1962) and Nova Express (1964), Scientology, along with the cut-up technique, silence, and <b>apomorphine</b> (which he believed was an extremely effective treatment for heroin addiction), allows the characters to resist social control. These works reflected Burroughs's initial belief that Scientology could be an instrument of liberation from social control, much as he used his own cut-up style of writing. He sought to use cut-ups [...] "to expose the arbitrary nature and manipulative power of all linguistic systems," [...] and connected cut-ups to the theories of the self expounded by Hubbard's Dianetics. [...] As religious studies scholar John Lardas explains, [...] "the cut-up method was the evangelical counterpart of Scientology {{in that it was}} intended to alter a reader's consciousness".|$|E
500|$|His wife, Jennifer, {{left him}} in October 1987 after he punched {{her in the face}} and kicked her down the stairs of the family home; this ended a {{difficult}} 15-year marriage blighted by frequent infidelity on his part. They had two children: Cara (born July 1976) and Dale (born January 1981). Former Liverpool teammate Ray Clemence recalled how Kennedy [...] "worked hard and played hard". Other teammates Steve Heighway and Phil Thompson noted that Kennedy was a [...] "quiet man", though [...] "women were always chasing after him" [...] and [...] "off the pitch he needed to be handled quite gently, and everything had to be organised just right otherwise there would be trouble". Completing a bad end to 1987, his licence at the Melton Constable was revoked. His prescribed L-DOPA medication also became less effective and he became increasingly isolated. His condition improved when he began injections of <b>apomorphine.</b> He was reliant on the Professional Footballers' Association to pay his medical expenses, and his divorce as well as business and tax problems wiped out his savings. A testimonial game was held between Arsenal and Liverpool in April 1991. A charity appeal was also set up to help pay his living costs. In late 1992 he began suffering from extreme paranoia, mostly due to the side effects of his medication, but regained his mental faculties following a short stay in hospital.|$|E
2500|$|Therapeutic use in Parkinson's {{disease is}} {{effective}} {{because of the}} drug's strong dopaminergic action. When administered subcutaneously, <b>apomorphine</b> {{is the most effective}} dopamine agonist. Within 3â20 minutes of injection <b>apomorphine</b> demonstrates a magnitude of effect (ability to convert the patient with Parkinson's disease to the [...] "on" [...] state) [...] that is comparable to L-DOPA. A single subcutaneous injection lasts for up to 90 minutes. While <b>apomorphine</b> can be used in combination with L-DOPA, the intention is usually to reduce the L-DOPA dosing, as by this stage the patient with Parkinson's disease will probably be experiencing a great deal of dopa-induced dyskinesias and [...] "off" [...] periods. Following a successful <b>apomorphine</b> challenge, training of patient and caregiver, and careful dose titration, the patient can be maintained in the [...] "on" [...] state by the use of an <b>apomorphine</b> pump as an effective monotherapy.|$|E
2500|$|Several {{techniques}} {{exist for}} the creation of <b>apomorphine</b> from morphine. [...] In the past, morphine has been combined with hydrochloric acid (HCl) at high temperatures, around 150Â°C, to achieve a low yield of <b>apomorphine</b> which can range anywhere from 0.6% to 46%.|$|E
2500|$|Historically, <b>apomorphine</b> {{has been}} tried {{for a variety of}} uses {{including}} psychiatric treatment of homosexuality in the early 20th century, and more recently in treating erectile dysfunction. Currently, <b>apomorphine</b> is used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. It is a potent emetic (i.e., it induces vomiting) and should not be administered without an antiemetic such as domperidone. [...] The emetic properties of <b>apomorphine</b> are exploited in veterinary medicine to induce therapeutic emesis in canines that have recently ingested toxic or foreign substances.|$|E
2500|$|The {{protective}} effects of <b>apomorphine</b> {{were tested in}} mouse models with mutations in genes related to AD, such as the amyloid precursor protein (APP) gene, which is implicated in amyloid molecule build-up. [...] <b>Apomorphine</b> was seen to significantly improve memory function through the increased successful completion of the Morris Water Maze. [...] The levels of the aberrant proteins that lead to neuronal disruption were also tested in the brains of mice. [...] Treatment was seen to decrease the intraneuronal levels of the more aggressive AÎ²42 molecule {{when compared to the}} control mice. [...] This result is consistent with the finding that another protein linked to AD, tau protein, was seen to decrease with <b>apomorphine</b> treatment. [...] <b>Apomorphine</b> was shown to promote AÎ² degradation and inhibit formation through its anti-oxidative properties. Moderate doses were shown to provide the improvements while overuse provided no benefits and may even cause toxicity.|$|E
2500|$|Burroughs left Paris for London in 1960 {{to visit}} Dr. Dent, a {{well-known}} English medical doctor who spearheaded a reputedly painless heroin withdrawal treatment using the drug <b>apomorphine.</b> Dent's <b>apomorphine</b> cure {{was also used}} to treat alcoholism, although it was held by several people who undertook it {{to be no more}} than straightforward aversion therapy. Burroughs however was convinced. Following his first cure, he wrote a detailed appreciation of <b>apomorphine</b> and other cures, which he submitted to The British Journal of Addiction (Vol. 53, 1956) under the title [...] "Letter From A Master Addict To Dangerous Drugs"; this letter is appended to many editions of Naked Lunch.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Apomorphine,</b> {{which is}} a {{dopamine}} agonist not orally administered, {{may be used to}} reduce off periods and dyskinesia in late PD. Since secondary effects such as confusion and hallucinations are not rare, patients under <b>apomorphine</b> treatment should be closely monitored. <b>Apomorphine</b> can be administered by subcutaneous injection using a small pump which is carried by the patient. A low dose is automatically administered throughout the day, reducing the fluctuations of motor symptoms by providing a steady dose of dopaminergic stimulation. After an initial [...] "apomorphine challenge" [...] in hospital to test its effectiveness and brief patient and primary caregiver (often a spouse or partner), the latter of whom takes over maintenance of the pump. The injection site must be changed daily and rotated around the body to avoid the formation of nodules. <b>Apomorphine</b> is also available in a more acute dose as an autoinjector pen for emergency doses such as after a fall or first thing in the morning. Nausea and vomiting are common, and may require domperidone (an antiemetic).|$|E
2500|$|<b>Apomorphine</b> (brand names Apokyn, Ixense, Spontane, Uprima) {{is a type}} of aporphine having {{activity}} as a non-selective dopamine agonist which activates both D2-like and, to an order of magnitude lesser extent, D1-like receptors. It also acts as an antagonist of 5-HT2 and Î±-adrenergic receptors with high affinity. The compound is historically a morphine decomposition product by boiling with concentrated acid, hence the -morphine suffix. <b>Apomorphine</b> does not actually contain morphine or its skeleton, nor does it bind to opioid receptors. The apo- prefix relates to it being a morphine derivative (" [...] from morphine").|$|E
2500|$|<b>Apomorphine</b> is {{reported}} to be an inhibitor of amyloid beta protein (AÎ²) fiber formation and a potential therapeutic for Alzheimer's disease (AD) under the amyloid hypothesis. [...] <b>Apomorphine</b> and its small molecule relatives are found to promote oligomerization of the AÎ²40 group of molecules, but inhibit the more advanced fibril formation from occurring. [...] The mechanism of protection offered by the small molecules is thought to be due to the autoxidation that occurs at the hydroxyl groups. [...] Once this functional group was altered, the inhibitory effect could be seen to decrease, reducing either the indirect or direct interference of the fibril formation.|$|E
2500|$|In his Deposition: Testimony Concerning a Sickness in the {{introduction}} to later editions of Naked Lunch, William S. Burroughs wrote that <b>apomorphine</b> treatment was the only effective cure to opioid addiction he has encountered: ...|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{his claims}} {{throughout}} his life, Burroughs never really cured his addiction and {{was back to}} using opiates within years of his <b>apomorphine</b> [...] "cure". [...] However, he insisted on apomorphineâs effectiveness in several works and interviews.|$|E
2500|$|The 1965 Tuli Kupferberg song [...] "Hallucination Horrors" [...] {{recommends}} <b>apomorphine</b> {{at the end}} of each verse, as a {{cure for}} hallucinations brought on by a humorous variety of intoxicants; the song was recorded by The Fugs and appears on the album Virgin Fugs.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Apomorphine</b> {{possesses}} {{affinity for}} the following receptors: Database |work=Psychoactive Drug Screening Program (PDSP) |author1=Roth, BL |author2=Driscol, J |url=http://pdsp.med.unc.edu/pdsp.php |publisher=University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and the United States National Institute of Mental Health |accessdate=1 July 2014 |date=12 January 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131108013656/http://pdsp.med.unc.edu/pdsp.php |archivedate=8 November 2013 |df= }} ...|$|E
2500|$|<b>Apomorphine</b> {{was under}} {{development}} {{as a treatment for}} erectile dysfunction by TAP Pharmaceuticals under the brand name Uprima. [...] In 2000, TAP withdrew its new drug application after an FDA review panel raised questions about the drug's safety, due to many clinical trial subjects fainting after taking the drug.|$|E
2500|$|It {{was also}} used as a private {{treatment}} of heroin addiction, a purpose {{for which it was}} championed by the author William S. Burroughs. Burroughs and others claimed that it was a [...] "metabolic regulator" [...] with a restorative dimension to a damaged or dysfunctional dopaminergic system. There is more than enough anecdotal evidence to suggest that this offers a plausible route to an abstinence based model; however, no clinical trials have ever tested this hypothesis. A recent study indicates that <b>apomorphine</b> might be a suitable marker for assessing central dopamine system alterations associated with chronic heroin consumption. There is, however, no clinical evidence that <b>apomorphine</b> is an effective and safe treatment regimen for opiate addiction. [...] Early studies involved aversion therapy in alcoholism and anxiety, and modern reports are anecdotal, although some practitioners claimed to be using non-aversive methods.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Apomorphine</b> behaves as {{a partial}} agonist at D2S (IA [...] = 79%), D2L (IA= 53%), D3 (IA [...] = 82%), and D4 (IA = 45%), {{and as an}} {{antagonist}} at 5-HT1B, 5-HT1D, 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, 5-HT2C, Î±1-adrenergic, and Î±2-adrenergic. Though its efficacies at D1 and D5 are unclear, it is known {{to act as an}} agonist at these sites.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Apomorphine</b> is an agonist, or activator, of both D1 and D2 type {{dopamine}} receptors with {{a preference}} toward the D2 group. [...] The {{members of the}} D2 subfamily, consisting of D2, D3, and D4 receptors, are involved with inhibitory neurotransmission. [...] Inhibition is achieved through a signaling pathway in which the activated receptor, a G proteinâcoupled receptor, inhibits the enzyme adenylate cyclase, therefore decreasing the levels of the signaling molecule cyclic AMP.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Apomorphine</b> {{was used}} with some notable {{success as a}} {{treatment}} for alcohol and morphine addiction. At first this was part of a Pavlov style [...] "conditioned-reflex" [...] treatment, later continued with emetine by practitioners such as Voegtlin in the US, but gradually this was replaced by a recognition by various practitioners in Europe that the drug was having other effects. However, this form of treatment fell out of favour, and was over by the 1980s.|$|E
2500|$|The D4 {{receptor}} {{in particular}} is an important target in the signaling pathway, and is connected to several neurological disorders. [...] Shortage or excess of dopamine can prevent proper function and signaling of these receptors leading to disease states. [...] It is classically thought that an excess of dopamine stimulation {{is a factor in}} schizophrenia, but it appears this relationship is pathway dependent and just one of several contributing factors. [...] <b>Apomorphine</b> is useful in diseases where dopamine levels are lower than normal, such as Parkinsonâs disease, and can help to restore proper motor behavior by increasing the inhibitory signaling.|$|E
