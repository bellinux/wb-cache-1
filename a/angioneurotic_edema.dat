40|$|Absence of {{inhibition}} of C'I esterase from plasma {{of persons with}} hereditary <b>angioneurotic</b> <b>edema</b> (1) has been ascribed to at least two inherited abnormalities of biosynthesis of a specific alpha globulin which inhibits C'I esterase (2). These defects have permitted studies of the activation of the first component of complement (C'I) and of the action of C'I esterase in unfraefionated serum and plasma. In the absence of serum {{inhibition of}} C' 1 esterase, C'I tends to be converted to Cq esterase (3). This tendency to spontaneous activation of C'I esterase in plasma from persons with hereditary <b>angioneurotic</b> <b>edema</b> is notably increased during the bouts of swelling which these individuals sustain (3, 4). Such variations in activation of C'I esterase cannot be due merely {{to the lack of}} normal serum inhibition, for this deficiency is lifelong, and the bouts of edema and associated enhanced activation of C'I esterase are sporadic.

40|$|When {{purified}} human C′ 1 esterase {{is injected}} intradermally in man, increased vascular permeability results.

40|$|Activation of {{the human}} plasma kallikrein enzyme system results in the {{production}} of pharmacologically potent polypeptides known as kinins. These substances, in nanogram quantities, produce vasodilation, incite pain, increase vascular permeability, stimulate leukotaxis, and act on uterine and intestinal smooth muscle (1). The role of the kallikrein system in human disease is becoming more apparent (1 - 3). The plasma of patients with hereditary <b>angioneurotic</b> <b>edema</b> {{has been found to be}} deficient in C 1 inactivator ~ (5, 6) an a 2 -neuraminoglycoprotein which in purified systems inhibits kallikrein, C 1 esterase, PF/dil and plasmin (5, 7 - 9). In patients lacking this inhibitor, C 1 activation has been demonstrated in vivo during attacks of angioedema (10, 11). The evidence for activation of the kaUikrein system under similar circumstances is less convincing than that obtained for the complement system. As a consequence, it has been suggested that there may be other physiologically important inhibitors of plasma kallikrein (12). In the present study, examination of the kinetics of kaolin-induced activation of plasma kallikrein esterolytic activity (13 - 15) in normal plasma and in plasma from patients with hereditary <b>angioneurotic</b> <b>edema</b> has indicated that a protein other than Ci inactivator is a major plasma inhibitor of kallikrein.

40|$|Activation of plasma kallikrein {{arginine}} esterase {{activity by}} kaolin resulted in peak activity at 1 min of incubation and a 50 % reduction in activity at 5 min in normal plasma, and 30 % {{reduction in the}} plasma of patients with hereditary <b>angioneurotic</b> <b>edema</b> who lacked the C 1 inactivator. The peak esterolytic activity was inhibited by soybean trypsin inhibitor whereas the 5 min activity was resistant to this inhibitor. Acid treatment of normal and hereditary <b>angioneurotic</b> <b>edema</b> plasma destroyed the factor responsible for the fall in esterase activity at 5 min and the factor which rendered the esterase resistant to soybean trypsin inhibitor. Purified α 2 -macroglobulin inhibited approximately 50 % of the TAMe esterase activity of purified plasma kallikrein without changing its activity toward basic amino acid esters. The interaction between the α 2 -macroglobulin and kallikrein resulted in alterations in the gel filtration chromatographic pattern of the TAMe esterase and biologic activity of kallikrein, indicating that kallikrein was bound to the α 2 -macroglobulin. The TAMe esterase activity of this complex, isolated by column chromatography, was resistant to C 1 inactivator and SBTI. Studies of incubation mixtures of kallikrein, α 2 -macroglobulin and C 1 inactivator suggested that these inhibitors compete for the enzyme, and that the α 2 -macroglobulin partially protects the esterase activity of kallikrein from C 1 inactivator. The α 2 -macroglobulin isolated from kaolin-activated plasma possessed 240 times the esterolytic activity of the α 2 -macroglobulin purified from plasma treated with inhibitors of kallikrein and of its activation. The α 2 -macroglobulin blocked the uterine-containing activity and vascular permeability-inducing effects of plasma kallikrein. These {{studies suggest that the}} α 2 -macroglobulin is a major plasma inhibitor of kallikrein and provide a new example of an interrelationship between the coagulation, fibrinolytic, and kallikrein enzyme systems...|$|E
40|$|The {{function}} {{and several of}} the structural features of the C 1 inactivator protein isolated from the plasma of a mother and daughter with the variant form of hereditary <b>angioneurotic</b> <b>edema</b> have been examined. These abnormal inhibitors shared immunologic identity with the normal C 1 inactivator protein; however, they were inactive in inhibiting the functional activity of C 1 s. Analysis of the abnormal inhibitors by sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) acrylamide gel electrophoresis suggested that each consisted of a single polypeptide chain, the mobility of which was slower than that of the normal C 1 inactivator. The apparent molecular weight of the patients' inhibitors was 109, 000 daltons as contrasted to 105, 000 daltons, that of the normal C 1 inactivator. The abnormal inhibitors failed to form a complex with C 1 s or plasmin as analyzed by SDS-acrylamide gels. The large proteolytic derivatives resulting from the plasmin- and trypsin-induced degradation of the abnormal inhibitors were approximately 3, 000 daltons heavier than the corresponding products derived from normal C 1 inactivator. Thus, the structural abnormality identified appeared to be a property of the core molecule. Treatment of the inhibitors with neuraminidase failed to demonstrate a difference between the normal and patient-derived C 1 inactivator molecule. Neither were major differences found between the amino acid composition of the defective and normal inhibitors; however, the acidic amino acids tended to be higher in the patients' inhibitors, and the phenylalanine content lower. Thus, these studies have identified both structural and functional abnormalities in the C 1 inactivator protein isolated from two related patients with hereditary <b>angioneurotic</b> <b>edema.</b> Examination of the interaction between endopeptidases and the inhibitors has further delineated the abnormal structural features...|$|E
