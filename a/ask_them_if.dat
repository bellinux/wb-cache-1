500|$|Wilson {{was absent}} from WWE {{television}} {{for quite some}} time after this, leading to rumors and false reports that she had been released from WWE. In actuality, she had taken a leave of absence to tend to some [...] "personal issues". Wilson was surprised by the rumors after some media personnel offered to help her find work. WWE issued a statement on their website, in which Wilson also commented, denouncing the rumors. In the statement she joked she had to [...] "call the WWE office and <b>ask</b> <b>them</b> <b>if</b> they forgot to fire me".|$|E
500|$|When {{those plans}} fell through, McLaren, Rhodes {{and the band}} began looking locally for a new member to assume the lead vocal duties. As {{described}} by Matlock, [...] "Everyone had long hair then, even the milkman, so {{what we used to}} do was if someone had short hair we would stop them in the street and <b>ask</b> <b>them</b> <b>if</b> they fancied themselves as a singer." [...] Among those they approached was Midge Ure, who was involved with his own band, Slik. Kevin Rowland—who would co-found Dexys Midnight Runners three years later—auditioned, but apart from Matlock, no one was impressed. With the search going nowhere, McLaren made several calls to Richard Hell, who turned down the invitation.|$|E
500|$|Before penning [...] "The Thriving Cult of Greed and Power", Behar {{had written}} a 1986 article in Forbes magazine, [...] "The Prophet and Profits of Scientology", which {{reported}} on the Church of Scientology's business dealings and L. Ron Hubbard's financial success. Behar wrote that during research for [...] "The Thriving Cult of Greed and Power", he and a Time contributing editor were themselves investigated by ten attorneys and six private investigators affiliated with the Church of Scientology. According to Behar, investigators contacted his friends and previous coworkers to <b>ask</b> <b>them</b> <b>if</b> he {{had a history of}} tax or drug problems, and obtained a copy of his personal credit report that had been obtained illegally from a national credit bureau. Behar conducted 150 interviews {{in the course of his}} research for the article.|$|E

25|$|The Rabbis {{taught in}} a Baraita that {{if a child is}} {{intelligent}} enough to ask the four questions, the child <b>asks</b> <b>them.</b> <b>If</b> the child is not intelligent enough, the wife <b>asks</b> <b>them.</b> <b>If</b> the wife does not ask the questions, the leader of the seder <b>asks</b> <b>them.</b> And even two scholars who know the laws of Passover must ask one another (if no one else can ask).|$|R

500|$|Instead, {{the work}} of {{assembling}} the C5 was given to The Hoover Company {{in the spring of}} 1983. The Welsh Development Agency (WDA) approached Hoover to <b>ask</b> <b>them</b> <b>if</b> they would be interested becoming the principal subcontractor for Sinclair, [...] "who are working on an electric car, and as a by-product of the research have designed an electrically assisted bicycle. They are looking for a subcontractor to whom they can entrust the assembly." [...] The proposal suited all sides. The WDA was keen to support the Hoover washing machine factory at Merthyr Tydfil, situated in the economically depressed South Wales Valleys. Hoover was enticed by Sinclair's projections of sales of 200,000 units a year, increasing to 500,000. Sinclair saw Hoover's plant and expertise as a good match for their fabrication techniques. A contract was signed within a few months.|$|E
2500|$|If a {{government}} loses a [...] "non-confidence" [...] motion traditionally the Prime Minister {{will ask the}} Governor General to call an election. The Governor General when approached by the Prime Minister who has lost {{a vote of confidence}} will traditionally call an election. However it is not assured as some assume. The Governor General also has the right to call the leader of the party they think would be most {{likely to be able to}} form government and <b>ask</b> <b>them</b> <b>if</b> they can form the government. This happened in 1926 and is referred to as the King-Byng Affair.|$|E
2500|$|In Mobile Infantry basic training, Career Sgt. Zim trains the recruits. Rico {{is later}} {{promoted}} to squad leader and befriends Ace Levy. He later receives a Dear John letter from Carmen, as she desires a {{career with the}} fleet and now serves under Rico's high-school sports rival, Zander Barcalow. Following a live-fire training incident that kills one of Rico's squad members and causes another to quit out of guilt, Rico is demoted and flogged. He resigns and calls his parents to <b>ask</b> <b>them</b> <b>if</b> he can return home, but the call is cut off when an asteroid, reported to be launched by the Arachnids, obliterates Buenos Aires, killing them and millions of others. Rico rescinds his resignation.|$|E

6000|$|... "Peter {{thought a}} great deal about this, and when he went back to Moscow, which was then the capital, he inquired and found that there were some people from Holland there. He <b>asked</b> <b>them</b> <b>if</b> they knew how to build ships. Some of them said they did. Then he <b>asked</b> <b>them</b> <b>if</b> they could not build him some small vessels, just like the Dutch ships of war. They said they could. So he made a bargain with them, and they built him several.|$|R
2500|$|Ragnar Bøe Elgsaas {{admitted}} having 'advanced' membership {{fees for}} {{people he had}} not asked {{if they wanted to}} be members. Each December, the board would phone people to <b>ask</b> <b>them</b> <b>if</b> they wanted to renew their membership. If they said yes, they would receive a giro in the mail. Elgsaas gave himself away, when stating [...] "if this was not the case, we would 'advance' for the member". Elgsaas later denied stating this. Of the 700 people who had been incorrectly registered as members, Elgsaas estimated that they had phoned about half of them. They used several rules of thumb to consider who wanted to be members, without actually asking them, including those who applied for membership during the year, those who had formerly had positions, those who had been to information meetings, and those whom they knew personally. He also confirmed it was impossible to recollect the NOK 30 that was advanced, because the information of who had confirmed was automatically deleted from the computer system.|$|E
2500|$|Boelcke {{shot down}} 10 Royal Flying Corps {{aircraft}} {{in his first}} month with Jasta 2, September 1916. He would fly a solo mission {{in the morning and}} return to his [...] "cubs", who would ask if he had scored again. He would <b>ask</b> <b>them</b> <b>if</b> his chin was black with burnt cordite from his machine guns' breech. If it was, he had fired his gun and scored. However, in contrast to his freebooting style, his pilots always flew in disciplined formations in practice, and he repeatedly drilled them in his tactics. Among them were his famed combat rules, called [...] "Boelcke's Dicta", which were the first systematic analysis of air combat and continued to be applicable through World War II. Despite his run of personal successes, Boelcke's attitude is best expressed thus, in his own words: [...] "Everything depends on sticking together when the Staffel goes into battle. It does not matter who actually scores the victory as long as the Staffel wins." [...] He not only preached this doctrine to his own [...] "cubs"; he proselytized throughout the Luftstreitkräfte. He wrote upon his ideas, sketched them out and delivered them in person to other aerodromes.|$|E

40|$|The {{author of}} this article {{mentions}} how some Maltese readers and writers find the Maltese language problematic; a puzzle which may appear too random and difficult to piece together and so they condemn and question {{the use of the}} language. The author goes on to debate this argument by <b>asking</b> <b>them</b> <b>if</b> they ever took a moment to understand the Maltese language. He <b>asks</b> <b>them</b> <b>if</b> they ever read a verse by Dun Karm, or a few words by Professor Temi Zammit insisting that if they did they would not certainly not see the Maltese language as a chaotic language. peer-reviewe...|$|R

60|$|Another {{good way}} we {{discovered}} of irritating the aristocratic type of steam launch, was to mistake {{them for a}} beanfeast, and <b>ask</b> <b>them</b> <b>if</b> they were Messrs. Cubit’s lot or the Bermondsey Good Templars, and could they lend us a saucepan.|$|E
