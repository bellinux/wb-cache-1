News of its closing upon Guinan's retirement in early 2007 led to efforts that postponed that for a year.

500|$|Bayliss (Kyle Secor) and Pembleton (Andre Braugher) {{prepare to}} {{interview}} Risley Tucker (Moses Gunn), an elderly arabber. Bayliss is convinced Tucker murdered [...] 11-year-old Adena Watson, but Pembleton is less confident. Since {{they have already}} interviewed Tucker multiple times, the court will not allow him to be bothered anymore {{if he does not}} confess after this interview, and the detectives have only 12 hours to elicit a confession before Tucker walks free. Pembleton starts off acting friendly while Bayliss, who has taken the Watson case very personally, is more aggressive. Adena used to work for Tucker, taking care of his horse. Pembleton brings up Tucker's alcoholism, but Tucker said he gave up drinking because he used to black out, insisting he hasn't had <b>a</b> <b>drink</b> <b>in</b> 16 months. Tucker also insists he hadn't seen Adena for three days before she died, but Bayliss shows him she had soot on her skirt that matched soot from Tucker's barn, indicating she was there the day she was killed.|$|E

It continues with Beyoncé, sitting alone at an arranged table for dinner, waiting for her love interest to come home.

Afterwards, she dresses in a red leather trench coat with a gold choker and goes outside to look for her man. She is seen on a street surrounded by various fans taking pictures of her. The scenes also transition to the singer being at a party in a bar, chatting with people, holding <b>a</b> <b>drink</b> <b>in</b> her hands and straddling a pinball machine.
