5|$|That {{first night}} of my {{imprisonment}} was the longest night I have ever passed in my life; {{it seemed as though}} the dawn of day would never come. I found in my bag a small Book of Common Prayer according to the ritual of the Episcopal Church. It was a great comfort to me, and before retiring to rest Mrs. Clark <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> few minutes in the devotions appropriate to the evening. Here, perhaps, I may say, that although I had been a regular attendant on the Presbyterian worship since my childhood, a constant contributor to all the missionary societies, and had helped to build their churches and ornament the walls, giving my time and my musical ability freely to make their meetings attractive to my people, yet none of these pious church members or clergymen remembered me in my prison. To this (Christian ?) conduct I contrast that of the Anglican bishop, Rt. Rev. Alfred Willis, who visited me {{from time to time in}} my house, and in whose church I have since been confirmed as a communicant. But he was not allowed to see me at the palace.|$|E
500|$|In {{response}} {{to some of}} these criticisms, Coto stated that he personally considered the two-part story [...] "" [...] and [...] "Terra Prime" [...] that preceded [...] "These Are the Voyages..." [...] the actual finale of the Enterprise storyline. Berman said [...] "I've read a lot of the criticisms and I understand how some people feel, but [...] <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> lot of time coming up with the idea and a somewhat, I would say, unique ending to a series, especially when you’re ending it prematurely. [...] You never like to disappoint people, but I think it's nonsense {{to say that it was}} more a Next Generation episode than an Enterprise episode. The only elements of [...] that were present were there as a sounding board to allow us to look at a mission that took place six years after [...] "Terra Prime"." ...|$|E
2500|$|During her {{reign as}} Miss America Williams was criticized in some venues for winning. She later stated that [...] "there {{were a lot}} of people that did not want me to be {{representative}} of the United States and Miss America. And not just white people alone. There {{were a lot of}} people who had issues [...] I was too light. My eyes were the wrong color. My hair wasn't the right texture and getting criticism for being who I was." [...] She was also the target of persistent racist hate mail and death threats (which she documented in her memoir, You Have No Idea). Thirty years later, when Miss America 2014 Nina Davuluri (who was also a former Miss New York and Miss Syracuse) became the target of a racist social media backlash, Williams recounted the similarities with her own experiences, stating that she [...] "wrote a book about everything that I went through, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> lot of time talking about the death threats, the FBI, the sharpshooters ... it was a graver situation and more dangerous years ago—the change that was happening and the uproar because of the color of my skin." ...|$|E

60|$|Her musical voice, {{thoughtful}} {{eyes and}} quick intelligence, re-asserted their charm, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>spent</b> <b>an</b> {{hour or more}} in her company talking of old friends. It was not necessary to talk down to her. She was essentially urban in tone while other of the girls who had once impressed me with their beauty had taken on the airs of village matrons and did not interest me. If they retained aspirations they concealed the fact. Their husbands and children entirely occupied their minds.|$|R
50|$|The {{day before}} {{yesterday}} I suddenly turned down the guys, when they invited me to <b>a</b> party <b>and</b> instead <b>I</b> <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> whole evening conversing with your mother, being polite.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is true," [...] said Psmith, [...] "that Comrade Downing <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> very {{pleasant}} half-hour together inspecting boots, {{but how does}} he drag you into it?" ...|$|E
60|$|Sergeant Corney <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> long hour {{persuading the}} lad of his folly, for after the powwow {{had come to}} such an abrupt end there was no {{question}} whatsoever but that Thayendanega would kill or make prisoner of every white man who crossed his path.|$|E
6000|$|... 'No {{sooner had}} I made it than I began to {{cultivate}} my powers of small talk. I felt that my only chance {{was to be}} ready with appropriate subjects at the smallest notice, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> considerable part of my last year at Oxford in studying the best masters.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Really, my boy, I cannot say. There was an {{unpleasant}} little affair {{last night at}} the Waldorf, in which I was not personally concerned, but suffered, nevertheless. An officious deputy caused my arrest <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>spent</b> <b>an</b> unpleasant night in jail. There being nothing in the way of evidence against me I was released this morning, <b>and</b> now <b>I</b> find a detective shadowing me. What can it all mean, I wonder? These stupid blunders are very annoying to the plain citizen, who, however innocent, feels himself the victim of a conspiracy." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> agreed, <b>and</b> {{as one of}} the men {{had brought}} two or three saws and axes in a wagon we set about it. The men from Carrington, however, were not very {{proficient}} at the work and {{a good deal of the}} chopping fell to me. The bush was rather thick, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>spent</b> <b>an</b> hour in tolerably arduous labor before our base line was clear. Then I sat down on a slender fallen birch while Lyle and the rest went back to the wagon for some provisions they had brought. It was evident that we could not get home for supper.|$|R
40|$|When {{the first}} joint {{workshop}} on cultural research between the University of Western Sydney’s Centre for Cultural Research (CCR) and the Department of Cultural Studies at Hong Kong’s Lingnan University (LU) began in July 2002, I {{had to admit}} to a little uncertainty in opening the proceedings. It was a novel experience for me to speak in Sydney {{as a member of}} <b>a</b> foreign delegation, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>spent</b> <b>an</b> anxious moment wondering how to pitch my remarks: should I be telling old friends from UWS about what we do at Lingnan, or introducing new friends from Hong Kong to the Sydney—no, the Parramatta-based environment where we would spend the next few days?</span...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, now, in {{the whole}} world I've only had to do with one place that was a {{volcanic}} vent of blue clay. That was the great De Beers Diamond Mine of Kimberley--what? So you see I got diamonds into my head. I rigged up a contraption to hold off those stinking beasts, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> happy day there with a spud. This is what I got." ...|$|E
6000|$|This amiable remark of {{the fair}} Zenobia {{confirmed}} me in what I {{had already begun to}} suspect, that Hollingsworth, like many other illustrious prophets, reformers, and philanthropists, was likely to make at least two proselytes among the women to one among the men. Zenobia and Priscilla! These, I believe (unless my unworthy self might be reckoned for a third), were the only disciples of his mission; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> great deal of time, uselessly, in trying to conjecture what Hollingsworth meant to do with them--and they with him! ...|$|E
60|$|The {{wedding was}} set {{for the end of}} September. I {{continued}} to go every week to Elkington, and in August, Maude <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> fortnight at the sea. There could be no doubt as to my mother's happiness, as to her approval of Maude; they loved each other from the beginning. I can picture them now, sitting together with their sewing on the porch of the cottage at Mattapoisett. Out on the bay little white-caps danced in the sunlight, sail-boats tacked hither and thither, the strong cape breeze, laden with invigorating salt, stirred Maude's hair, and occasionally played havoc with my papers.|$|E
2500|$|I {{have never}} seen {{anything}} like it before or since, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> have <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> lot of time where the night sky could be seen well. [...] This suggests that the phenomenon involves a comparatively rare set of conditions or circumstances to produce it, but nothing like the odds of an interstellar visitation.|$|R
5000|$|CNET {{wrote that}} {{high-resolution}} music 96 kHz and 192 kHz/24 FLAC sounded remarkable. [...] "Bass definition firmed up, <b>and</b> after <b>I</b> <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> few hours with the X3 the iPod sounded rather bland and boring." [...] The sound on X3 was [...] "more complete and realistic" [...] {{than that of}} iPod and [...] "it's a much better sounding player iPod classic".|$|R
60|$|RAINA (affectedly). I {{tell you}} {{these things to}} shew {{you that you are}} not in the house of ignorant country folk who would kill you the moment they saw your Servian uniform, but among civilized people. We go to Bucharest every year for the opera season; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> have <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> whole month in Vienna.|$|R
60|$|It was September {{when the}} {{millstones}} arrived, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> joyous morning of final bargaining with Mr. Myron Scarlett. This Mr. Scarlett was from Connecticut, {{had been a}} quartermaster in the army, and at much risk brought ploughs and hardware, and scissors and buttons, and broadcloth and corduroy, across the Alleghanies, and down the Ohio in flatboats. These he sold at great profit. We had no money, not even the worthless scrip that Congress issued; but a beaver skin was worth eighteen shillings, a bearskin ten, and a fox or a deer or a wildcat less. Half the village watched the barter. The rest lounged sullenly about the land court.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Quack <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> very {{comfortable}} winter {{way down in}} the sunny Southland," [...] said she with a far-away look. [...] "It was very warm and nice down there, {{and there were a}} great many other Ducks spending the winter with us. The place where we were was far from the homes of men, and it was only once in a long while that we had to watch out for terrible guns. Of course, we had to have our wits with us all the time, because there are Hawks and Owls and Minks down there just as there are up here, but any Duck who can't keep out of their way deserves to furnish one of them a dinner.|$|E
60|$|Herne {{was playing}} an {{unlimited}} engagement at the Broadway theater <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> {{good deal of}} time behind the scenes with him. His house on Convent Avenue was a handsome mansion and on a Sunday, I often dined there, and when we all got going the walls resounded with argument. Jim was a great wag and a delightful story teller, but he was in deadly earnest as a reformer, and always ready to speak on The Single Tax. He took his art very seriously also, {{and was one of the}} best stage directors of his day. Some of his dramatic methods were so far in advance of his time that they puzzled or disgusted many of his patrons, but without doubt he profoundly influenced the art of the American stage. Men like William Gillette and Clyde Fitch quite frankly acknowledged their indebtedness to him.|$|E
2500|$|In March 2003, Danish {{newspaper}} B.T. {{published an}} article based on accusations that the EBU television director Bjørn Erichsen made in reference to LTV suffering from organisational chaos which {{could result in the}} removal of Latvia's hosting duties since they were running behind schedule. The general director of LTV, Uldis-Ivars Grava, replied, saying: [...] "A few weeks ago, the EBU's legal director, Werner Rumphorst, was in Riga, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>spent</b> <b>an</b> entire day with him and with the former general director of the Danish broadcaster DR, Bjørn Erichsen. We talked about co-operation and about programme exchanges, and neither of them said a single word that would indicate any doubts, lack of trust or accusation." [...] Ingrida Smite, head of press for the Eurovision Song Contest 2003, reaffirmed that the contest would take place in Riga despite reports to the contrary.|$|R
60|$|Then {{there was}} the Indian {{position}} on {{the hill to the}} east. We managed to climb a low hill so as to look into this position. Jed <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>spent</b> half <b>an</b> hour trying to count them, and concluded, with much guessing, that there must be {{at least a couple of}} hundred. Also, we saw white men with them and doing a great deal of talking.|$|R
6000|$|... "There's nothing succeeds like simplicity," [...] Denis declared. [...] "I gambled upon it that no {{one would}} think of searching the {{curtains}} of the music hall box in which Gant <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>spent</b> apparently <b>a</b> jovial evening. No one did--until it was too late. Then I felt perfectly certain that both you and Brightman would believe I was trying to get hold of Richard Beverley. The poor fellow thought so himself for some time." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{first summer}} Mr. Irving and Miss Lavendar--Diana and I could never call her {{anything}} else, {{even after she}} was married--were at Echo Lodge after their marriage, both Diana <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> {{great deal of time}} with them. We became acquainted with many of the Grafton people whom we had not known before, and among others, the family of Mr. Mack Leith. We often went up to the Leiths in the evening to play croquet. Millie and Margaret Leith were very nice girls, and the boys were nice, too. Indeed, we liked every one in the family, except poor old Miss Emily Leith. We tried hard enough to like her, because she seemed to like Diana and me very much, and always wanted to sit with us and talk to us, when we would much rather have been somewhere else. We often felt a good deal of impatience at these times, but I am very glad to think now that we never showed it.|$|E

His {{pictures}} and books and images were all over (my friend) Dulany Winkler's house, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> lot of time there. I just wanted to reach out and touch him. Eventually I was able to." ...|$|E
5000|$|As Palin {{explained}} to Time Out: [...] "Eric <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> day listening to Heath's speeches; {{at a certain}} point I went to sleep...I feel the record hasn't done justice to the boredom and inanity of those party political speeches. If it is funny, thank Mr Heath for that. It's all him..." ...|$|E
6000|$|... --I'm {{going to}} show you a little trick, Mr Dedalus said. I'll leave you all where Jesus left the jews. Look, there's all I have. I got two shillings from Jack Power <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>spent</b> twopence for <b>a</b> shave for the funeral.|$|R
5000|$|In 2005, {{she landed}} {{a role in}} Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo, which she {{described}} as that it [...] "may {{as well have been}} the most brutal Lars von Trier film.

[...] She called the experience [...] "regrettable from start to finish" [...] and a [...] "hideous, hideous moment and a great lapse of judgement on my part." ...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{examines}} how socioeconomic and socioecologic changes in rural Japan {{have affected the}} embedded antifragility of rural satoyama communities. These communities have traditionally had {{a high degree of}} self-sufficiency and been detached from input systems based on synthetic agrichemicals <b>and</b> debt. <b>I</b> <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> month in the Hida region of Japan, where I interviewed villagers in a small mountain village, representatives from the local municipality and observed the conditions for satoyama in the area. Theories from neoclassical and institutional economics, political ecology and the concept of antifragiliy from the works of Nassim Nicholas Taleb was used to analyze my data...|$|R

40|$|The {{production}} of self {{is a complex}} process of discovery. In my thesis, I draw from the idea that landscapes have meaning for different people. I use images of the two places that have defined me as a scholar and an artist: California and Guatemala. In my work, I am interested in place {{as a function of}} memory; to me, thinking back to iconic images <b>and</b> where <b>I</b> <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> lot of time is more important than representing places as they "actually" are.
