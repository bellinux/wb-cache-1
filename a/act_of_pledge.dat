Initially, the act displaced lower-income families and fostered segregation. In the aftermath of the civil rights movement, Congress invoked the act to extend home-ownership opportunities to lower-income families and racial minorities. Despite early failures, federal initiatives, together with a maturing mortgage market and a favor-able economic climate, have increased homeownership rates. These gains notwith-standing, affordability and lagging homeownership rates for minorities pose critical challenges that must be met in the new millennium...|$|R

The following year, in 1535, Henry VIII ordered a survey of the finances of the church, entitled the Valor Ecclesiasticus.

Layton visited Keynsham Abbey in August, 1535. Four years later, on 28 January 1539, John Tregonwell and William Petre, Henry VIII's privy councilor and Secretary of State were sent to the abbey as [...] "visitors.".

While the Thai government openly welcomed Americans and denounced China, the prime minister of Thailand secretly sent the two children of his principal adviser, Sang Phathanothai, to China as a goodwill offering and to be brought up there by Premier Zhou Enlai; thus replaying the <b>act</b> <b>of</b> making human <b>pledge</b> practiced in China throughout history.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the issue of {{creation}} and realization <b>of</b> a <b>pledge</b> in the current legislation. The thesis is structured as follows: introduction, three main chapters which constitute the body of the thesis, and conclusion. The first chapter called general introduction deals with the concept <b>of</b> a <b>pledge,</b> in particular its main principles and functions. It further introduces the parties to a relationship established by a pledge and the institute <b>of</b> future <b>pledge</b> together with its practical applications. The second chapter called creation <b>of</b> a <b>pledge</b> provides the overview of individual titles based on which and modes in which a pledge may be created. The chapter describes creation <b>of</b> <b>pledge</b> by (i) an agreement (ii) a decision of a public authority; or (iii) a statute. This chapter further focuses on pledge creation modes as listed in the Civil Code and the Insolvency Act. The chapter also pays special attention to the creation <b>of</b> a <b>pledge</b> by registration in the public registers, the issue of public registers and the effects of material publicity principle. The chapter separately deals with the creation <b>of</b> a <b>pledge</b> over securities and receivables. Finally it also covers the creation <b>of</b> a <b>pledge</b> in the insolvency proceedings.

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} law <b>of</b> <b>pledging</b> as {{presented}} in the early Irish laws and draws connections to its relations within the overall system of security. At the centre of my research stands the question what pledges Irish law recognised and how their application was determined, so as to provide a paradigm for the law <b>of</b> <b>pledging</b> in its entirety. A pledge is usually a movable, material object of symbolic and economic worth that is given to another person as a security deposit for an outstanding obligation. The main findings of this thesis are a first paradigm of the law <b>of</b> <b>pledging</b> and a methodological and contextual categorisation of all types <b>of</b> <b>pledges</b> that opens doors for future research into property law. The combined discussion <b>of</b> <b>pledges,</b> hostages and sureties offers the reader insight into a triple method of security and its differences. Moreover, the close relationship between given pledges and distrained pledges is unravelled for the first time. Of further note is the comparative investigation into pledging. Therein, the reader is presented with how pledges are used in Welsh, Salic, Lombard, Visigothic, and Burgundian law. The objective is to offer the reader a view into the possibilities <b>of</b> <b>pledging</b> {{and to provide a}} framework against which the Irish evidence can be probed, which reveals how sophisticated and attentive to detail the Irish laws were. Finally, a translation of the primary source text Bretha im &# 7710;uillemu Gell (Judgements concerning Pledge-interests) is made available to the reader in the Appendix. </p...|$|R

Much previous research focused on countries where single‐party governments {{are the norm}} (the United Kingdom, Canada and Greece), and the presidential system of the United States with separation of powers. The present research draws on evidence from existing studies <b>of</b> <b>pledge</b> enactment in Ireland and the Netherlands. In addition, it adds new evidence on election pledges and their enactment {{in the most recent}} Irish government: the majority centre‐right coalition of Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats, 2002 – 2007. By adding this new evidence, we are able to make stronger inferences on the impact of coalition governance on the types <b>of</b> <b>pledges</b> made and rates <b>of</b> <b>pledge</b> enactment. We also study the impact of prominent mechanisms of coalition governance – government agreements and ministerial portfolio allocations – on the likelihood <b>of</b> <b>pledge</b> enactment. In addition, in an effort to move beyond existing research, we present evidence {{on the extent to which}} election pledges are featured in media reports during the election campaign...|$|R

50|$|As {{time went}} on, however, the main {{provisions}} <b>of</b> the <b>act</b> <b>of</b> 1800 {{were found to}} be very irksome, and the Pawnbrokers National Association and the Pawnbrokers Defence Association worked hard to obtain a liberal revision of the law. It was argued that the usury laws had been abolished for the whole of the community except only for the pawnbroker who advanced less than £10. The limitations <b>of</b> the <b>act</b> <b>of</b> 1800 interfered so considerably with the pawnbrokers' profits that, it was argued, they could not afford to lend money on bulky articles needing extensive storage room. In 1870 the House of Commons appointed a Select Committee on Pawnbrokers, and it was stated in evidence before that body that in the previous year 207,780,000 <b>pledges</b> were lodged, <b>of</b> which between thirty and forty millions were lodged in London. The average value <b>of</b> <b>pledges</b> appeared to be about 4s., and it was claimed that the proportion of articles pawned dishonestly was found to be only 1 in 14,000.

This study provides the first comparative analysis that addresses this question with common definitions <b>of</b> <b>pledges</b> and fulfillment.

We find high levels <b>of</b> <b>pledge</b> fulfillment for most parties that enter the government executive, and substantially lower levels for parties that do not. The findings challenge the common view of parties as promise breakers. The degree to which governing parties share power affects pledge fulfillment, with parties in single-party executives, both with and without legislative majorities, having the highest fulfillment rates. Within coalition governments, the likelihood <b>of</b> <b>pledge</b> fulfillment depends on whether the party receives the chief executive post and whether another governing party made a similar pledge, {{but not on the}} ideological range of the coalition...|$|R
