25|$|The {{method is}} a {{continuous}} process {{that begins with}} observations about the natural world. People are naturally inquisitive, so they often come up with questions about things they see or hear, and they often develop ideas or hypotheses about why things <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> they are. The best hypotheses lead to predictions that can be tested in various ways. The strongest tests of hypotheses come from carefully controlled experiments that gather empirical data. Depending on how well additional tests match the predictions, the original hypothesis may require refinement, alteration, expansion or even rejection. If a particular hypothesis becomes very well supported, a general theory may be developed.|$|E
25|$|Extension × intension = information. Two {{traditional}} {{approaches to}} sign relation, necessary though insufficient, <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> of extension (a sign's objects, also called breadth, denotation, or application) {{and the way}} of intension (the objects' characteristics, qualities, attributes referenced by the sign, also called depth, comprehension, significance, or connotation). Peirce adds a third, the way of information, including change of information, to integrate the other two approaches into a unified whole. For example, because of the equation above, if a term's total amount of information stays the same, then the more that the term 'intends' or signifies about objects, the fewer are the objects to which the term 'extends' or applies.|$|E
25|$|When Peggy awakes, {{she finds}} herself back {{in the spring of}} 1960, her senior year of high school, after she passed out after {{donating}} blood in the school gym (where the reunion was). She finds all of her friends that she just left to also be their teenage selves, not just her. Still in shock, she allows herself to be taken home while she sees her surroundings <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> they were 25 years before. After a rough first night, she decides to have fun with the experience and behave as if everything is normal. However, when given the chance to break up with Charlie, she thinks it might be best since she knows how it will end.|$|E
50|$|Political theorists Corinne McLaughlin and Gordon Davidson {{identified}} {{what they}} felt was a defining passage in one Alliance document:Politics <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> we live our lives.

500|$|A second album, We <b>Are</b> <b>the</b> <b>Way</b> Forward, was {{recorded}} over an eight-day period and released by Out On a Limb in 2005. It received three from five {{stars in a}} review by RTÉ's Harry Guerin who said: [...] "you'll get what you paid for from their stomp and swing". Phil Udell's Hot Press review gave the album 4.5 out of five stars, saying it [...] "gives you that much sought after visceral thrill" [...] and that the duo [...] "wrote it, recorded it, fucked off.

500|$|Makeba {{said that}} she did not perform {{political}} music, but music about her personal life in South Africa, which included describing the pain she felt living under apartheid. She once stated [...] "people say I sing politics, but what I sing is not politics, it is the truth", an example of the mixing of personal and political issues for musicians living during apartheid. When she first entered the US, she avoided discussing apartheid explicitly, partly out of concern for her family still in South Africa. Nonetheless, she is known for using her voice to convey the political message of opposition to apartheid, performing widely and frequently for civil rights and anti-apartheid organisations. Even songs that did not carry an explicitly political message were seen as subversive, due to their being banned in South Africa. Makeba saw her music as a tool of activism, saying [...] "In our struggle, songs are not simply entertainment for us. They <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> we communicate." ...|$|E

This <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> to {{convince}} <b>the</b> world that you <b>are</b> Christ's, and <b>the</b> subjects of one Lord; whereas the contrary makes them doubt it (John 13:34,35, 17:23). 2. This <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> to increase love; that grace so much desired by some, and so little enjoyed by others (2 Cor 7:15). 3. This <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> to savour and taste the Spirit of God in each other's experience; for which {{if you find}} it in truth you cannot but bless, if you <b>be</b> saints, <b>the</b> name of our Lord Jesus Christ (1 Thess 1:2-4). 4. This <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> to increase knowledge, or to see more in the word of God: for that may be known by two; that is not seen by one (Isa 52:8). 5. This <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> to remove secret jealousies and murmurings one against the other: yea this <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> to prevent much sin, and greatly to frustrate that design of hell (Prov 6:16-19). 6.

This <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> to make antichrist shake, totter, and tremble (Isa 11:13,14). 8. This <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> to leave Babylon as an habitation for devils only; and to make it a hold for foul spirits, and a cage only for every unclean and hateful bird. 9. This <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> to hasten <b>the</b> work of Christ's kingdom in the world; and to forward his coming to the eternal judgment. 10.

2500|$|At between {{about the}} ages of four and seven, {{children}} tend to become very curious and ask many questions, beginning the use of primitive reasoning. There is an emergence {{in the interest of}} reasoning and wanting to know why things <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> they are. Piaget called it the [...] "intuitive substage" [...] because children realize they have a vast amount of knowledge, but they are unaware of how they acquired it. Centration, conservation, irreversibility, class inclusion, and transitive inference are all characteristics of preoperative thought.|$|E
2500|$|Shining Time Station {{received}} critical acclaim. In {{a review}} for Entertainment Weekly, Ken Tucker states that, {{compared to the}} faster paced Where in the World Is Carmen Sandiego?, [...] "'Shining Time Station' wants to slow things down. It's an old-fashioned show that creates a gentle, lulling atmosphere to convince children that life is fun and that trains <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> to travel." [...] It was a ratings success as well. In its first season, the show averaged a 0.9 Nielsen rating, translating to about 1.2 million viewers on average. At the peak of its popularity, the show brought in up to 7.5 million viewers per week.|$|E
2500|$|A leading {{advocate}} of austerity during the eurozone crisis— Schäuble in 2014 pushed through a national budget of 299 billion euros that allowed Germany {{not to take}} on any new debt {{for the first time}} since 1969. In the first half of 2016, he recorded a 18.5 billion euros budget surplus. He has been described variously as the [...] "personification of fiscal discipline" [...] and [...] "Europe's foremost ayatollah of austerity"—Schäuble's reputation for tough control of spending has been helped by Germany's rapid recovery from recession but he has repeatedly rebuffed calls from government supporters for vote-winning tax cuts. Throughout his tenure, he stood by his position that structural reforms such as overhauling labor markets in Europe <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> out of a low-growth spiral. In 2013, for example, Schäuble and Vítor Gaspar, his counterpart in Portugal, announced a plan to use the German state development bank KfW to help set up a financial institution to assist Portuguese under age 25 in getting jobs or job training.|$|E

2500|$|Another {{powerful}} argument hooks discusses is one {{in which}} she describes how starting from a very young age, boys and girls are constantly being knocked down and told to fit into the tiny boxes of characteristics that are expected of them. Hooks points out that the boy is denied his right to show, or even have, any true feelings. To further explain, she uses men in the American culture as an example, and describes how they have been socialized to mistrust the value and power of love. While the girl is taught {{that the most important thing}} she can do is change herself and her own feelings, with the hopes of attracting and pleasing everyone else. These unfair expectations lead boys and girls to grow up into men and women who are convinced that lies <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> to go, and no one should be showing their truest feelings to each other. This leads to the paradox hooks points out because in order to have a functional, and healthy loving relationship, honesty is a natural requirement. In bell hooks's own words, [...] "Lies may make people feel better, but they do not help them to know love" [...] (hooks). Another central argument in hooks's All About Love is the way in which it is almost impossible for women to find happiness in what she sees as a brutal culture where men are taught to worry more about sexual satisfaction and performance than actually loving someone. This reality pointed out by hooks, paired with the fact that women focus so strongly on obtaining themselves a partner, leads to most relationships being completely one sided. In this case, the men are emotionally satisfied, and the women are left without any true happiness. Hooks points out that despite these evident problems in modern-day love culture, love can be revived, and this is what she is arguing throughout her book.|$|E
