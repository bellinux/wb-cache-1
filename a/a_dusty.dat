5|$|Prior to her infestation, Kerrigan is {{described}} as being a graceful and deadly woman, exceedingly agile and athletic, possessing jade-green eyes and brilliant red hair usually worn as a ponytail. The novel Queen of Blades describes her facial features as being too strong to be classified as beautiful, but instead as striking and completely fitting for her personality. Kerrigan is rarely seen out of her armor, a form-fitting hostile environment suit specifically designed for Ghost operatives and equipped with a personal cloaking device, but when off-duty, she {{is described}} as wearing a soft work shirt, worn cotton pants with <b>a</b> <b>dusty</b> leather jacket, and high leather boots. Even then, it is uncommon for Kerrigan to be unarmed: she is always equipped {{with at least a}} combat knife.|$|E
5|$|Three {{practice}} sessions were held before the Sunday race—two on Friday, {{and a third}} on Saturday. The Friday morning and afternoon sessions each lasted 90minutes. The third session was held on Saturday morning and lasted an hour. The Ferraris outpaced the other teams in the first session on <b>a</b> <b>dusty</b> track surrounded by the sand dune desert of Sakhir. Massa's time of 1:32.233 was quicker than Räikkönen's, who was slowed down by an early excursion across the sand, requiring a pit stop. Nico Rosberg of Williams, Hamilton, McLaren driver Heikki Kovalainen, Williams driver Kazuki Nakajima and Kubica rounded out the top seven. In the second session, Hamilton lost control {{of his car and}} slid sideways into a wall. Hamilton emerged unharmed from the collision, but his McLaren suffered significant damage. Except for the crash, the second session ended like the first: once again, Massa led Räikkönen to Ferrari 1–2, ahead of Kovalainen, Hamilton and Kubica. The third session was again held on <b>a</b> <b>dusty</b> track, where Rosberg was quickest with a time of 1:32.521. Massa took second, ahead of Red Bull driver Mark Webber, Toyota driver Jarno Trulli, David Coulthard of Red Bull, Nakajima and Kubica. Räikkönen was ninth quickest, and Hamilton 18th.|$|E
5|$|Until {{late in the}} 20th century, the {{temperature}} of Eta Carinae {{was assumed to be}} over 30,000K {{because of the presence of}} high excitation spectral lines, but other aspects of the spectrum suggested much lower temperatures and complex models were created to account for this. It is now known that the Eta Carinae system consists of at least two stars, both with strong stellar winds and a shocked colliding wind (wind-wind collision or WWC) zone, embedded within <b>a</b> <b>dusty</b> nebula that reprocesses 90% of the electromagnetic radiation into the mid and far infrared. All of these features have different temperatures.|$|E

5|$|Three {{practice}} sessions were held before the Sunday race—two on Friday, {{and a third}} on Saturday. The Friday morning and afternoon sessions each lasted 90 minutes. The third session was held on Saturday morning and lasted an hour. The Friday morning practice session was held on <b>a</b> <b>dusty</b> track scattered with debris and several drivers spun off the track. Hamilton set the fastest {{time of the first}} session, at 1 minute and 28.653 seconds; his late lap was almost one second quicker than teammate Button. The two Mercedes drivers ended third and fourth quickest; Michael Schumacher ahead of Rosberg. Vettel and Webber set the fifth and eighth fastest times respectively for Red Bull; they were separated by the Renault cars of Kubica and Vitaly Petrov. Alonso and Adrian Sutil rounded out the session's top ten drivers. The session was disrupted with two minutes remaining when Sutil ran wide at turn eight, which caused him to spin backwards and crash into the barriers, breaking his front wing and both front tyres. The session was prematurely ended due to the limited time running.|$|E
5|$|Taonere Banda was {{the first}} Malawian Paralympic athlete to compete at the quadrennial event. She {{qualified}} for the games by using a wildcard because the country {{did not have any}} athletes who met the qualification standards. Banda spent the 60 days in the buildup to Rio training for the event, but amenities in Malawi were imperfect and she trained on <b>a</b> <b>dusty,</b> uneven running track without standard defined lanes. She stated that it had been her childhood ambition to represent Malawi at a major international sporting event and this was her sole opportunity to prove her athletic abilities in her event, the 1500 metres (T13). Banda was drawn in the first heat on 8 September. She attacked the first lap aggressively taking up a commanding lead, but her initial speed saw her tire in the latter stages and she lost the lead in the last 600 metres of the race to finish fourth. Banda was later disqualified when she was observed to leave her lane during the heat. Nevertheless, she said that when she returned to Malawi, she would encourage people with disabilities to work hard and participate in sporting events.|$|E
5|$|The second-brightest star, the yellow-white {{subgiant star}} Alpha Trianguli (3.41m) with a close dimmer companion, {{is also known}} as Caput Trianguli or Ras al Muthallath, and is at the apex of the {{triangle}}. It lies around 7 degrees north-northwest of Alpha Arietis. Making up the triangle is Gamma Trianguli, a white main sequence star of spectral type A1Vnn of apparent magnitude 4.00 about 112 light-years from Earth. It is around double the size of and around 33 times as luminous as the sun and rotates rapidly. Like Beta, it is surrounded by <b>a</b> <b>dusty</b> debris disk, which has a radius 80 times the distance of the Earth from the Sun. Lying near Gamma and forming an optical triple system with it are Delta and 7 Trianguli. Delta is a spectroscopic binary system composed of two yellow main sequence stars of similar dimensions to the Sun that lies 35 light-years from Earth. The two stars orbit each other every ten days and are a mere 0.1 AU apart. This system is the closest in the constellation to the Earth. Only of magnitude 5.25, 7 Trianguli is much further away at around 280 light-years distant from Earth.|$|E
