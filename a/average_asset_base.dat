The model includes proxies for the banking regulatory CAMELS rating variables including: the equity capital to total asset ratio, net charge-offs to loans, salaries to <b>average</b> <b>assets,</b> return on <b>average</b> <b>assets,</b> the liquidity ratio and the one year GAP ratio. The discriminant model is tested using data for 2006, 2007 and 2008. This includes periods of high performance as well as deteriorating industry conditions associated with the current financial crisis. The model’s classification accuracy ranges from approximately 88 % to 96 % for both original and cross-validation datasets...|$|R
40|$|PRELIMINARY DRAFT [...] Please do not quote {{without the}} author’s permission. ABSTRACT: The {{asymptotic}} single risk factor (ASRF) {{approach is a}} simplified framework for determining regulatory capital charges for credit risk and has {{become an integral part}} of how credit risk capital requirements are to be determined under the second Basel Accord. Within this approach, a key regulatory parameter is the <b>average</b> <b>asset</b> correlation. In this paper, we examine the empirical relationship between the <b>average</b> <b>asset</b> correlation, firm probability of default and firm asset size measured by the book value of assets by imposing the ASRF approach within the KMV methodology for determining credit risk capital requirements. Using data from year-end 2000, credit portfolios consisting of U. S., Japanese and European firms are analyzed. The empirical results suggest that <b>average</b> <b>asset</b> correlation is a decreasing function of probability of default and an increasing function of asset size. When compared with the <b>average</b> <b>asset</b> correlations proposed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in November 2001, the empirical <b>average</b> <b>asset</b> correlations further suggest that accounting for firm asset size, especially for larger firms, may be important. In conclusion, the empirical results suggest that a variety of factors may impact <b>average</b> <b>asset</b> correlations within an ASRF framework, and these factors ma...|$|R

40|$|The {{credit risk}} capital {{requirements}} within the current Basel II Accord {{are based on}} the asymptotic single risk factor (ASRF) approach. The asset correlation parameter, defined as an obligor's sensitivity to the ASRF, is a key driver within this approach, and its average values for different types of obligors are to be set by regulators. Specifically, for commercial real estate (CRE) lending, the <b>average</b> <b>asset</b> correlations are to be determined using formulas for either income-producing real estate or high-volatility commercial real estate. In this paper, the value of this parameter was empirically examined using portfolios of U. S. publicly traded real estate investment trusts (REITs) as a proxy for CRE lending more generally. CRE lending as a whole was found to have the same calibrated <b>average</b> <b>asset</b> correlation as corporate lending, providing support for the recent U. S. regulatory decision to treat these two lending categories similarly for regulatory capital purposes. However, the calibrated values for CRE categories, such as multifamily residential or office lending, varied in important ways. The comparison of calibrated and regulatory values of the <b>average</b> <b>asset</b> correlations for these categories suggest that the current regulatory formulas generate parameter values that may be too high in most cases. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} I compute the welfare {{cost of the}} Great Moderation, using a {{consumption}} <b>based</b> <b>asset</b> pricing model. The Great Moderation is modeled {{according to the data}} properties of the stationary component of consumption, which displays a reduction of the volatility at high frequencies, and an unchanged volatility at medium frequencies. The theoretical model, calibrated to match the <b>average</b> <b>asset</b> pricing variables in the data, relies on the evolution of the habit stock, which depends on the lower frequencies of consumption. These two features generate a modest welfare gain of the Great Moderation (0. 6 percent). I show that this result depends mainly on the medium frequency properties of consumption.
