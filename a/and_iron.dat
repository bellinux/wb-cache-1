5|$|Although {{far less}} common than other metallo{{proteins}} (e.g. those of zinc <b>and</b> <b>iron),</b> cobaltoproteins are known aside from B12.

Another non-corrin cobalt enzyme is nitrile hydratase, an enzyme in bacteria that metabolize nitriles.|$|E
5|$|Although zinc is an {{essential}} requirement for good health, excess zinc can be harmful. Excessive absorption of zinc suppresses copper <b>and</b> <b>iron</b> absorption.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to assess the association of markers in the calpastatin and mu-calpain loci with iron in beef cattle muscle. The population consisted of 259 cross-bred steers from Beefmaster, Brangus, Bonsmara, Romosinuano, Hereford and Angus sires. Total <b>iron</b> <b>and</b> heme <b>iron</b> concentrations were measured. Markers in the calpastatin (referred to as CAST) and mu-calpain (referred to asCAPN 4751) genes were used to assess their association with iron levels. The mean and standard error for <b>iron</b> <b>and</b> heme <b>iron</b> content in the population was 35. 6 ± 1. 3 μg and 27. 1 ± 1. 4 μg respectively. Significant associations (P 3 ̆c 0. 01) of markers were observed for both <b>iron</b> <b>and</b> heme <b>iron</b> content. For CAST, animals with the CC genotype had higher levels of <b>iron</b> <b>and</b> heme <b>iron</b> in longissimus dorsi muscle. ForCAPN 4751, individuals with the TT genotype had higher concentrations of <b>iron</b> <b>and</b> heme <b>iron</b> than did animals with the CC and CT genotypes.
