5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1909, Alice, wanting her sons to have an English education, {{accompanied}} them to England and enrolled them in Dunstable Grammar School in Bedfordshire, where Cooper was educated from 1910 to 1912. At Dunstable, Cooper studied Latin and French, and took several courses in English history. While he managed {{to adapt to the}} discipline of an English school and learned the requisite social graces, he never <b>adjusted</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rigid class structure and formal Eton collars he was forced to wear. After completing confirmation classes, Cooper was baptized into the Anglican Church on December 3, 1911, at the Church of All Saints in Houghton Regis. Cooper's mother accompanied her sons back to the United States in August 1912, and Cooper resumed his education at Johnson Grammar School in Helena.|$|E

Society has <b>adjusted</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> avian conquest, though with minor bird-related cultural changes—for example, while some holidays such as Christmas and Tanabata are celebrated much {{as they are in}} the present day, a major event in the game is Legumentine's Day, an amalgamation of the traditions of Valentine's Day and Setsubun. In a more grim case, the terms war dove and war hawk have been re-purposed as labels for two opposing political factions divided over the ongoing mutual hostility between birds and the human minority: the altruistic Dove Party, who advocate for cooperation and peace between the two groups, and the militant Hawk Party, whose goal is to exterminate humanity altogether. By the time Hatoful Boyfriends narrative begins, the Dove Party, the Hawk Party, and their respective schools of thought dominate much of the world's politics.|$|E

5|$|The {{pattern of}} {{intermarriage}} continued, as many KMT soldiers married aboriginal {{women who were}} from poorer areas and could be easily bought as wives.

In a 1994 study, it was found that 71% of the families surveyed would object to their daughter marrying an aboriginal man. For much of the KMT era the government definition of aboriginal identity had been 100% aboriginal parentage, leaving any intermarriage resulting in a non-aboriginal child. Later the policy was <b>adjusted</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ethnic status of the father determining the status of the child.|$|E
