5|$|In the United States, heating, {{ventilation}} <b>and</b> <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> (HVAC) systems {{account for}} 30% (4.65EJ/yr) {{of the energy}} used in commercial buildings and nearly 50% (10.1EJ/yr) of the energy used in residential buildings. Solar heating, cooling and ventilation technologies {{can be used to}} offset a portion of this energy.|$|E

The campus would receive a new roof, new electrical wiring, new heating <b>and</b> <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> units, improved security features, improvements to parking lots, new paint, a refurbished science lab and new equipment.|$|E
5|$|The {{turbines}} {{were designed}} to operate at 12,500 rpm and were paired with a generator set with a 10:1 reduction gearing. A twin-armature DC generator was used to power the traction motors, while a three-phase, 220-volt AC generator provided auxiliary functions such as powering the traction motor blowers and providing head-end power; the latter, which was used to provide lighting, heating, <b>and</b> <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> to passenger cars, was incredibly unusual in 1939 and would not become standard until the 1970s.|$|E

5|$|A cube-shaped {{concrete}} {{building was}} constructed {{on the top}} of the hill, next to the dome. This was intended to be used as the bomb-proof outlet for a ventilation <b>and</b> <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> shaft. It was an essential component of a facility where dangerous and explosive gases were expected to be used in large quantities on a daily basis. It was never finished, and the Allies found when they captured the site that the ventilation shaft had not been fully excavated. The building survived the bombing intact and is still prominently visible today.|$|E
5|$|At some U.S. {{international}} airports, such as O'Hare International Airport in Chicago, some {{seating and}} waiting areas are {{located away from}} the terminal building, with passengers being shuttled to terminals. These areas may {{be referred to as}} ground transportation centers or intermodal centers. Amenities at ground transportation centers typically include restrooms and seating, and may also provide ticket counters, food and beverage sales and retail goods such as magazines. Some ground transportation centers have heating <b>and</b> <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> and covered boarding areas (to protect passengers from the elements).|$|E
5|$|Thirty-five {{years after}} its opening, Baden-Powell House was {{refurbished}} in a six-month Â£2million programme, providing all modern amenities such as private facilities for all rooms, double glazing, <b>and</b> <b>air</b> <b>conditioning,</b> as well as enhancing conference facilities for large and small events. Upon completion of the programme, the house was opened {{by the president of}} The Scout Association, Prince Edward, Duke of Kent on 5 June 1997. In 2002 a Starbucks coffee (discontinued before 2015) and sandwich bar was opened, as well as an outdoor roof garden adjacent to the meeting conference rooms on the second floor.|$|E

5|$|Eventually the Maceos, with Quinn, {{opened the}} Hollywood Dinner Club, {{at the time}} the most elegant night club on the Gulf Coast. The club {{featured}} crystal chandeliers, a massive dance floor, <b>and</b> <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> (a new technology at the time; the Hollywood was the first club in the nation to use it). Because of Sam's smooth personality he became the face of the nightclub. Guy Lombardo performed for the club's opening, and Sam attracted a steady stream of celebrity performers thereafter. The club hosted one of the nation's first remote radio broadcasts, and featured Ben Bernie's orchestra (one of the nation's most famous performing groups), which was introduced by a young Walter Cronkite. The club, the first venue in the nation to offer high-class gaming, dining, and entertainment, and air-conditioning under one roof, was unique at the time.|$|E
5|$|The trains {{were put}} back into service on 13 July. The trains were only allowed {{to operate at}} {{conventional}} speeds and {{had to go through}} a weekly inspection. At the same time, NSB removed the surcharge on the Signatur services. NSB stated that they were considering revocation the purchase of the four trains which were still to be delivered. In addition to problems with axles, there were also issues with the braking <b>and</b> <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> systems. In mid-August, the tilting mechanism was disabled on all the trains because of a fault in a bearing in the connection between the bogie and the body which allowed for a movement of several millimetres (at least 0.1 in). In late August, problems occurred with the braking system causing the trains to automatically brake even when not receiving such signals from the automatic train stop system.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the 1970s {{construction}} continued, {{starting with}} the Mathematical Sciences Building, followed by the Offenhauer Towers in 1971 and Industrial Education & Technology Building in 1972. The Business Building and the Industrial Arts Building opened in 1973 and University Hall received renovations in 1974 that included new seating, an improved sound system, <b>and</b> <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> in the auditorium. In 1979, the Student Recreation Center and the Moore Musical Arts Center opened. In 1970, the Board of Trustees ended an alcoholic beverage ban on campus. The Cardinal Room, an on-campus eatery, began serving beer. A growing trend in the late 1960s and early 1970s was the development of large apartment complexes adjacent to campus. By the 1970s approximately 4,000 students lived in private, off-campus housing. On campus, Darrow Hall became the first co-ed dorm in 1972 with men and women inhabiting alternating floors.|$|E
