5|$|While {{his injury}} {{and the end}} of his {{professional}} career were a source of frustration, Parseghian soon got the chance to try coaching instead. Woody Hayes, the head coach back at Miami, contacted him <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>job</b> as coach of the freshman team. He was recommended for the position by athletic director John Brickels, who had been an assistant coach with the Browns in 1948. Parseghian led the freshmen to a 4–0 record in the 1950 season, and was chosen the following year as Hayes's successor when Hayes departed to become head coach at Ohio State University.|$|E
5|$|Schyman {{graduated}} from the University of Southern California in 1978 {{with a degree in}} music composition. He intended to compose music for film and television, {{going so far as to}} present two student film scores at his senior recital, which was an unconventional move at the time. Upon graduation, through one of his friend's father, the actor Dennis Weaver, he was invited to watch a recording session for the music of a television show Weaver was working in. There, he met a ghost composer for the show, who in turn told him <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>job</b> composing for Lutheran television which he applied for and was hired. He also met the composers Pete Carpenter and Mike Post, the titled composers for the show Weaver had been acting in. They were working on four to five shows each week, and brought him on board as a ghost composer to help them create music for several shows, such as Magnum, P.I. and The Greatest American Hero, for which he is credited for starting in 1980.|$|E

Information obtained from job analyses are used for many purposes, including the creation of job-relevant selection procedures, performance appraisals and the criteria they require, and the development of training programs.|$|E
