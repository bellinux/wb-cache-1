5|$|The {{noble gases}} (historically also the inert gases) {{make up a}} group of {{chemical}} elements with similar properties; under standard conditions, they are all odorless, colorless, monatomic gases with very low chemical reactivity. The six noble gases that occur naturally are helium (He), neon (Ne), argon (Ar), krypton (Kr), xenon (Xe), and the radioactive radon (Rn). Oganesson (Og) is variously predicted to be a noble gas <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>or</b> to break the trend due to relativistic effects; its chemistry {{has not yet been}} investigated.|$|E
5|$|Although the Convertibility {{plan had}} {{positive}} consequences {{in the short}} term, it caused problems that surfaced later. Large numbers of employees of privatized state enterprises were fired, and unemployment grew to over 10%. Big compensation payments prevented an immediate public reaction. The free trade, and the expensive costs in dollars, forced private companies {{to reduce the number}} of workers <b>as</b> <b>well,</b> <b>or</b> risk bankruptcy. Unions were unable to resist the changes. People with low incomes, such as retirees and state workers, suffered under tax increases while their wages remained frozen. The provinces of Santiago del Estero, Jujuy and San Juan had their first violent riots. To compensate for these problems, the government started a number of social welfare programs, and restored protectionist policies over some sectors of the economy. It was difficult for Argentine companies to export, and easy imports damaged most national producers. The national budget soon slid into deficit.|$|E

Liquefaction risk at the Pegasus Town site was identified in 2005, so the developers spent approximately $20 million on soil compaction, and the ground there held firm during the quake.|$|E

25|$|Emmel and Perry (2004) {{believed}} {{there to be}} shifts in the relative abundances of the three Orthalicus taxa in the Keys. In the past, Orthalicus floridensis {{was the most common}} and widespread of the three, whereas subsequent to 2000, Emmel and Perry (2004) considered the Orthalicus floridensis to be the rarest. This situation results partly from the translocations that bolstered Orthalicus reses reses distribution and allowed them to avoid extinction, but probably also reflects actual declines in Orthalicus floridensis populations over time. Orthalicus reses reses now occur in sympatry with their congeners in several locations. The observations of Emmel and Perry (2004) suggested that translocated Orthalicus reses reses, all of which are outside the historic range, perform <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>or</b> better than congeners in those places where they overlap.|$|E

25|$|The {{house and}} gardens {{are open to}} {{visitors}} by guided tour {{in the summer and}} by appointment at other times. Guided tours focus upon the historical context of the house, the ancient mythological and religious origins of the Greek Revival, connections with Freemasonry, the Agricultural Revolution, the Picturesque movement, and issues of interpretation of the Borghese Vase and the Parthenon Frieze. A musical instrument collection including pianos, harpsichords, two pipe organs and a modified five-manual Makin electronic are used for an annual programme of concerts. The latter served at St Columb's Cathedral, Derry for 12 years (whilst its predecessor was being repaired after the Troubles), and is used in particular to promote the music of the French symphonic writers such as Vierne and Widor. Its expansion from three to five manuals, with more than 150 stops, makes it one of the largest such instruments in Europe with more than 25,000 possible stop combinations. The other keyboards are tuned to an unequal temperament, such <b>as</b> <b>Well</b> <b>or</b> Meantone, which composers of the Classical and Romantic era relied upon to choose the key in which to write their compositions.|$|E
500|$|Bell was Michigan's {{starting}} {{running back}} in the same years in which Archie Griffin won consecutive Heisman Trophies for Ohio State. [...] In head-to-head meetings in 1974 and 1975, Bell played <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>or</b> better than Griffin. [...] In 1974, each carried the ball 25times, and Bell ended up with 108yards compared with 111yards for Griffin although Ohio State won the game 12–10. [...] In 1975, Bell outgained Griffin 124yards to 46yards. [...] Bell averaged 132.9yards per game in 1975 to lead Griffin and the Big Ten Conference in conference game rushing. Even so, Griffin won the Heisman Trophy, and Bell finished eighth in the 1975 Heisman Trophy voting.|$|E

500|$|Getting It {{received}} mixed, {{but generally}} positive, reviews. [...] One positive evaluation came from psychiatrist James Charney, in a 1976 review for Library Journal. [...] Charney calls the book [...] "the only useful {{critical look at}} this essential issue", referring to the est training. [...] He notes in particular that Fenwick's [...] "analysis of {{the function of the}} group, the restrictive rules, and the enforced discomfort is convincing". In a 1977 review in Library Journal Edith Crockett and Ellis Mount highly recommended the book, commenting that [...] "A plethora of newspaper and magazine reports, along with books written by graduates... have attempted to explain the phenomenon of this self-help program, but none has done it <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>or</b> as objectively as this writer." [...] Kirkus Reviews noted the precedent set by the analytical nature of the book, writing [...] "Finally. Here's someone who is willing to disclose the details of Erhard Seminars Training, and then go on to analyze them from a psychological point of view." [...] Zane Berzins, writing for The New York Times Book Review in 1977, describes Fenwick's work as a [...] "calm and professionally informed view". [...] Berzins describes the book as a [...] "brave attempt" [...] at an analysis of est's appeal, and concludes that [...] "It's hardly an incendiary exposé, but Fenwick's open-minded scrutiny should deglamourize the est movement." ...|$|E
500|$|Alternatives to such metaphysical and idealist {{opinions}} about conscience arose from realist and materialist perspectives {{such as those}} of Charles Darwin. Darwin suggested that [...] "any animal whatever, endowed with well-marked social instincts, the parental and filial affections being here included, would inevitably acquire a moral sense or conscience, as soon as its intellectual powers had become <b>as</b> <b>well,</b> <b>or</b> as nearly as well developed, as in man." [...] Émile Durkheim held that the soul and conscience were particular forms of an impersonal principle diffused in the relevant group and communicated by totemic ceremonies. AJ Ayer was a more recent realist who held that the existence of conscience was an empirical question to be answered by sociological research into the moral habits of a given person or group of people, and what causes them to have precisely those habits and feelings. Such an inquiry, he believed, fell wholly within the scope of the existing social sciences. George Edward Moore bridged the idealistic and sociological views of 'critical' and 'traditional' conscience in stating that the idea of abstract 'rightness' and the various degrees of the specific emotion excited by it are what constitute, for many persons, the specifically 'moral sentiment' or conscience. For others, however, an action seems to be properly termed 'internally right', merely because they have previously regarded it as right, the idea of 'rightness' being present in some way to his or her mind, but not necessarily among his or her deliberately constructed motives.|$|E
