5|$|With {{the failure}} of his attempt to conquer Naxos, Aristagoras found himself in dire straits; {{he was unable to}} repay Artaphernes, and had, moreover, alienated himself from the Persian royal family. He fully {{expected}} to be stripped of his position by Artaphernes. In <b>a</b> <b>desperate</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> save himself, Aristagoras chose to incite his own subjects, the Milesians, to revolt against their Persian masters, thereby beginning the Ionian Revolt.|$|E
5|$|Antony's fleet {{sailed through}} {{the bay of}} Actium on the western coast of Greece in <b>a</b> <b>desperate</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> break free of the naval blockade. It was there that Antony's fleet faced the much larger fleet of smaller, more maneuverable ships under commanders Agrippa and Gaius Sosius {{in the battle of}} Actium on 2 September 31BC. Antony and his {{remaining}} forces were spared only due to a last-ditch effort by Cleopatra's fleet that had been waiting nearby.|$|E
5|$|At 16:29, the Japanese dive bombers {{began their}} attacks. Although several {{attempted}} {{to set up}} to attack the Saratoga, they quickly shifted back to the nearer carrier, Enterprise. Thus, Enterprise {{was the target of}} almost the entire Japanese air attack. Several Wildcats followed the Vals into their attack dives, despite the intense anti-aircraft artillery fire from Enterprise and her screening warships, in <b>a</b> <b>desperate</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> disrupt their attacks.

5|$|In <b>a</b> <b>desperate</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> {{improve the}} {{situation}} and hamper British operations, a number of experienced night fighter commanders and pilots suggested restarting intruder operations over England. In 1940–41, German night fighters, lacking airborne radar sets and a means to locate them over Germany, had flown to British bomber bases and attempted to destroy RAF bombers as they returned from their missions. Adolf Hitler had ordered a cessation of these activities for propaganda and practical reasons but these operations had met with reasonable success in 1941 and it was felt they may do so again.|$|E
5|$|Morgan {{considered}} attacking Camp Morton, the prisoner-of-war camp in Indianapolis, to free {{more than}} 5,000 Confederate {{prisoners of war}} imprisoned there, but decided against it. Instead, his raiders turned abruptly east and began moving towards Ohio. With Indiana's militia in pursuit, Morgan's men continued to raid and pillage their way toward the Indiana-Ohio border, crossing into Ohio on July 13. By the time Morgan left Indiana, his raid had become <b>a</b> <b>desperate</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> escape to the South. He was captured on July 26 in Ohio.|$|E
5|$|Nickell finally {{consented to}} a {{polygraph}} examination in November 1986. She failed it and investigators narrowed their focus to her even further; however, concrete evidence proving that Nickell had ever purchased or used cyanide was lacking, and despite their relative certainty that Stella Nickell had orchestrated the poisonings as either an elaborate cover-up for an insurance-motivated {{murder of her}} husband, or as <b>a</b> <b>desperate</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> force her husband's death to be ruled an accident, to increase her insurance payout, {{they were unable to}} build a strong enough case to support an arrest.|$|E

5|$|During 1944, {{the balance}} of naval power in the Pacific decisively turned against Japan, and by early 1945, its fleet was much {{depleted}} and badly hobbled by critical fuel shortages in the home islands. In <b>a</b> <b>desperate</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> slow the Allied advance, Yamato was dispatched on a one-way mission to Okinawa in April 1945, with orders to beach herself and fight until destroyed protecting the island. The task force was spotted south of Kyushu by US submarines and aircraft, and on 7 April 1945 she was sunk by American carrier-based bombers and torpedo bombers {{with the loss of}} most of her crew.|$|E
5|$|In <b>a</b> <b>desperate</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> prevent armed {{battle and}} to avert the {{resulting}} political crisis, U.S. President Andrew Jackson consulted his Attorney General, Benjamin Butler, for his legal {{opinion on the}} border dispute. At the time, Ohio was a growing political power in the Union, with nineteen U.S. representatives and two senators. In contrast, Michigan, still being a territory, had only a single non-voting delegate. Ohio was a crucial swing state in presidential elections, {{and it would have}} been devastating to the fledgling Democratic Party to lose Ohio's electoral votes. Therefore, Jackson calculated that his party's best interest would be served by keeping the Toledo Strip a part of Ohio.|$|E

Padilla received 57 shallow slashes from a dagger which did not put his life in danger, but he could have died from blood loss. Padilla blamed Flores for the stabbing and for an earlier attack {{in which he was}} allegedly beaten by men who warned him against criticizing the church leader. A church spokesman denied that the church or Flores had any involvement in the attack and suggested that Padilla may have orchestrated the attack in <b>a</b> <b>desperate</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> authenticate his previous charges against the church.|$|E

5|$|In the oil platform, Chris and Piers head underground, {{managing}} to free Jake and Sherry from captivity before preventing a large-scale attack by a gigantic bioweapon called Haos from the location. Heavily wounded, and in <b>a</b> <b>desperate</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> save Chris, Piers injects {{himself with a}} sample of the C-virus to help turn the tide of the battle, temporarily defeating Haos before evacuating.

After Chris' pod is launched, Haos makes one last attempt to kill Chris but is killed himself by a powerful lightning charge from Piers, which ensures Chris' escape and the destruction of the Neo-Umbrella base. At the same time, Jake and Sherry escape the facility pursued relentlessly by Ustanak, eventually {{managing to}} kill him as they ride a rocket-powered lift back to the surface.|$|E
5|$|On 21 May 1809, Napoleon {{crossed the}} Danube {{not far from}} Vienna and {{attacked}} Archduke Charles's Austrian army, situated on the northern bank of the river, in {{what became known as}} the Battle of Aspern-Essling. The French were nonetheless critically outnumbered and it soon became obvious that they would have a hard time just holding out. Nansouty could only get one of his brigades, Saint-Germain's 3rd and 12th cuirassiers, across the Danube for the action on 21 May. He found the heroic cuirassiers of General Jean-Louis-Brigitte Espagne charging, as they had done all day long, in <b>a</b> <b>desperate</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> stop Austrian attacks on the thin French battle line. Espagne had just been killed in action and his exhausted and depleted squadrons needed to be relieved. Nansouty at once brought forward Saint-Germain's squadrons and charged the enemy infantry, allowing the army to maintain itself on the position.|$|E
5|$|The {{expedition}} sailed in {{the spring}} of 499 BC but quickly descended into a debacle The force laid siege to the Naxians for four months, but eventually the Persians and Aristagoras both ran out of money. The force therefore sailed despondently back to the mainland. Aristagoras found himself in dire straits and fully expected to be stripped of his position by Artaphernes. In <b>a</b> <b>desperate</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> save himself, Aristagoras chose to incite his own subjects, the Milesians, to revolt against their Persian masters, thereby beginning the Ionian Revolt. Although Herodotus presents the revolt as a consequence of Aristagoras's personal motives, it is clear that Ionia must have been ripe for rebellion anyway, the primary grievance being the tyrants installed by the Persians. Aristagoras's actions have thus been likened to tossing a flame into a kindling box; they incited rebellion across Ionia (and Aeolis and Doris), and tyrannies were everywhere abolished, and democracies established in their place.|$|E
50|$|Even in the 19th century, anticolonial {{movements}} {{had developed}} claims about national traditions {{and values that}} were set against those of Europe. In some cases, as China, where local ideology was even more exclusionist than the Eurocentric one, Westernisation did not overwhelm longstanding Chinese attitudes to its own cultural centrality, but some would state that idea itself is <b>a</b> rather <b>desperate</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> cast Europe in a good light by comparison.|$|R

5|$|The {{story begins}} {{in the village of}} Etene, {{focusing}} on the protagonist, an orphan living with their sibling. The peace is shattered when Nelgel, the Lord of Hell, attacks the village. The protagonist's soul is transported to a shrine and placed within the body of a member of the five non-human tribes, while their sister is transported to the past to protect her from Nelgel. Under the guidance of a sage, the protagonist travels Astoltia searching for sacred emblems with which to reach Nelgel's lair. After collecting six out of ten emblems, the sage attempts to form a bridge to Nelgel's laier. This fails, and he decides to separate the protagonist's soul from their body in <b>a</b> <b>desperate</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> try another method.

5|$|The treaty {{recognised}} Scotland as {{an independent}} kingdom. It stipulated that Robert was to pay 40,000 marks to the English, and that Edward {{should be allowed to}} choose a wife from his own family for Robert's heir. Implied in the text, however, was an alliance between Robert and Harclay to use force against Edward, if necessary, to implement the terms of the treaty. It seems unlikely that Harclay expected royal clemency for his actions. More likely he contemplated a defection to the side of Robert the Bruce; rumour had it he even planned marrying one of Bruce's daughters. It is nevertheless likely that his action grew out of genuine concern with the northern situation, and was <b>a</b> <b>desperate</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> make the best out of a difficult situation.|$|E

A week later, he is seen visiting Lucrecia's crystalline tomb in the Crystal Cave.

5|$|Amid this {{environment}} of intense internal pressure {{for the band}} to break through to widespread popularity, the band relocated to Marietta, Georgia in late 1992 to begin work on their second album, with Butch Vig returning as producer. The decision to record {{so far away from}} their hometown was motivated partly by the band's desire to avoid friends and distractions during the recording, but largely as <b>a</b> <b>desperate</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> cut Chamberlin off from his known drug connections. The recording environment for Siamese Dream was quickly marred by discord within the band. As was the case with Gish, Corgan and Vig decided that Corgan should play nearly all of the guitar and bass parts on the album, contributing to an air of resentment. The contemporary music press began to portray Corgan as a tyrant. Corgan's depression, meanwhile, had deepened {{to the point where he}} contemplated suicide, and he compensated by practically living in the studio. Meanwhile, Chamberlin quickly managed to find new connections and was often absent without any contact for days at a time. In all, it took over four months to complete the record, with the budget exceeding $250,000.|$|E
5|$|By {{the morning}} of 16 January, the seas were still rough, whilst hunger and panic had taken over on the wreck. When a large raft {{carrying}} the wounded, two women and six children was launched during a lull in the weather, over 120 unwounded men scrambled to board it. This severely overloaded the craft and within minutes a large wave struck the heavy raft and capsized it, drowning all aboard. By the evening, the remaining survivors, without food or fresh water, began to succumb to exposure, {{and at least one}} officer drowned in <b>a</b> <b>desperate</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> swim to shore. Throughout the night, the survivors gathered on the less exposed parts of the hull, and, in the hope of staving off death by dehydration, drank sea water, urine, or vinegar from a small barrel that had floated up from the hold. The morning of 17January finally saw a reduction in the storm and the arrival of a small French naval brig, the Arrogante. This ship could not come close without the risk of grounding but sent her boats to the wreck in the hope of rescuing survivors. The brig was joined later in the day by the cutter Aiguille.|$|E

Orville, a senile old man, erroneously believes Chad is Eve's long-lost son with Crane Industries CEO Julian Crane and claims to have evidence proving this connection.
