They provided a DC-2 aircraft for the exterior shots while a true to scale mock up was provided for the interior scenes. In the famous Good Ship Lollipop scene, members of the University of Southern California football team served as extras. In the second flying scene where Temple's character sneaks aboard the plane and they were forced to bail out of it, both Temple and Dunn were strapped into a harness hoisted up into the studio rafters. They were supposed to drift down {{with the aid of a}} wind machine. In the first take, someone inadvertently opened an <b>airproof</b> door just as they landed, creating a vacuum that sucked out the parachute and dragged them both across the studio floor. Marilyn Granas served as a stand-in for Temple as she had for her previous movies. She would later be replaced by Mary Lou Isleib who would remain as Temple's stand-in for the rest of her tenure at 20th Century Fox.|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to {{determine}} the reasons for dormancy of Gelemen clover seeds existing in Campus area of the University of Ondokuz Mayis located in Kurupelit area of Samsun, Turkey and the ways of overcoming these reasons. The study was conducted under laboratory conditions. To got over dormancy, various chemicial matters such as Gibberellic acid (GA), KNO 3 and H 2 SO 4 were used. The other methods used to break dormancy were to sandpaper the seed for a known period, to keep the seeds in <b>airproof</b> plastic bag, to rub the seeds with sand, precooling, preheating, leaving the seeds for olding and application of hot water. According to the results, applications of various chemical matters had a limited effect on breaking dormancy. While germination rate was 7. 75 % in seeds without any application, this rate rose {{to a level of}} 16 % in seeds applied to various chemical matters. In this study, the highest germination rate was obtained from the application of sandpaper. Application of rubbing with sand followed this application with a germination rate of 61. 25 %. Leaving the seed to get old naturally, keeping the seeds in a <b>airproof</b> plastic bag, precooling, preheating and application of hot water had no effect on germination rate...|$|E
40|$|To {{learn the}} <b>airproof</b> {{capacity}} of filter cakes as opening chambers under air pressure, {{a series of}} tests were carried out. The variations of discharged water with air pressure and time were observed, and the relationship between <b>airproof</b> capacity of filter cakes and surrounding air pressure was analysed. The test results indicated that there were three stages as compressed air acting on filter cakes: completely not infiltration, a very small amount of infiltration, and penetration leakage. The certain air pressure {{between the first and second}} stages was called the airproofing value of filter cake. And a capillary bundle model was used to explain the mechanism of air tightness of filter cakes. In Nanjing Yangtze River Tunnel, a 5 [*]cm thickness filter cake was formed in gravel sand, and its airproofing value was a little lower than 0. 12 [*]MPa. The air pressure used as opening chamber should be equal to the summation of water pressure in sand and airproofing value of filter cake. While the air pressure is larger than the summation, the filter cake would be gas permeable. The slurry formulation and airproofing value of filter cakes obtained in the tests were applied successfully in Nanjing Yangtze River Tunnel...|$|E
40|$|The {{non-destructive}} inspection of large concrete walls {{is still an}} unsolved problem. One possible technique is to use driven wheels for the propulsion and a vacuum system for the adhesion. The seals for the vacuum chambers are slipping over the rough surface, therefore it is not guaranteed that the chambers are always <b>airproof.</b> Especially over concrete walls a special seal construction must be found to make the adhesion more safe. On the other side the propulsion system {{must be able to}} produce enough force for carrying and accelerating the robot to a suitable velocity. This paper will present the climbing robot Cromsci which uses the described techniques. The propulsion system consists of three omni directional driven wheels which are <b>airproof</b> and completely rotatable and has been presented in earlier papers before. For adhesion a vacuum system of seven controllable vacuum chambers and one reservoir chamber is used. This system including chambers and seals will be discussed in more detail. The rough and sharp-edged surface of concrete walls cause strong requirements to the sealing concerning leak tightness and attrition. Therefore, each sealing must be flexible to allow a good adaption to the ground but also let the robot slip when the wheels are turning...|$|E

40|$|The {{non-destructive}} inspection of large concrete walls with autonomous systems {{is still an}} unsolved problem. One of the main difficulties {{is to develop a}} very flexible platform, which is able to move and inspect horizontal and vertical surfaces safely, fast and cost-efficient. This report will present the climbing robot Cromsci which is designed for the described task. The propulsion system consists of three omnidirectional driven wheels which are <b>airproof</b> and completely rotatable for a maximum of maneuverability. To detect critical situations each wheel is equipped with a load cell which can measure occuring forces and torques and allow force-balancing. The adhesion is done by a vacuum system of seven controllable vacuum chambers and one large reservoir chamber. Pressure sensors and valves are integrated for controlling which allows fast reaction on changing conditions. The rough and sharp-edged surface of concrete walls causes strong requirements concerning leak tightness and attrition to the sealing between vacuum chambers and walls. Therefore, each sealing must be flexible to allow a good adaption to the ground but also let the robot slip when it is moving...|$|E
30|$|The super-high speed high {{temperature}} superconductor (HTS) maglev evacuated tube transport (ETT) is a promising transport mode for the future. As {{a key component}} of the HTS maglev vehicle, the permanent magnet guideways (PMGs) with different geometrical configurations and iron yoke widths are analyzed by finite element method (FEM). The levitation force of a single onboard HTS maglev device over the designed PMG at different field cooling heights (FCH) is measured by magnetic levitation measurement system. Based on the designed PMG and experimental results, a preliminary scheme of subterranean super-high speed HTS maglev ETT is described in this paper. The HTS maglev ETT is mainly composed of an evacuated tube, HTS maglev vehicle, PMG, propulsion system, station, emergency rescue system, etc. In addition, a subterranean tube that consists of foundation tube and vacuum <b>airproof</b> layer is introduced. In order to convert the stress caused by the air pressure difference between inside and outside of the vehicle, a multi-circular vehicle body is designed. The vehicle is driven by a linear motor propulsion system under the control of a ground controlling system. The scheme of long-distance super-high speed passenger transportation is accomplished by the connection of different vehicles.|$|E

Evacuated Tube Transportation (ETT) will be {{the fastest}} traffic mode on earth in the future, {{possible}} over 6000 km/h, and low energy consumption, no air pollution, no noise and relatively safe. Different from pipelines for transporting oil, gas and water, the tube of ETT will bear the maglev vehicles running in it, {{and it should be}} with reliable <b>airproof</b> ability for keeping required vacuum in the tube. Itâ€™s significant to seriously select the proper materials for creating tube wall and design reasonable tube wall structure. In this paper two materials to be used most possibly, steel and concrete, are considered. In addition, some types of tube wall structure are analyzed.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{evaluation}} of different simulation approaches to kitchen ventilation modelling. Multi-zone, CFD and zonal approach are discussed. The investigation moves its steps from the analysis of a controlled ventilation system intended for individual and collective housing. The question of natural ventilation being able of ensuring ventilation rates consistent with acceptable indoor air quality is dealt with. Buildings have become increasingly <b>airproof</b> and natural ventilation, as it will be presented, may result inadequate. It follows that ensuring a proper airflow by mechanical means is necessary to provide occupants with good IAQ. The analyzed ventilation system supplies the main rooms (living rooms and dining rooms) with fresh air. Air sweeps through the occupied space and eventually is extracted by means of grilles located in the technical rooms such as kitchens and bathrooms, i. e. the rooms that are the most polluted {{as a result of}} every day life. The objective is to develop a design model suitable for long term, whole year, analysis that is able to offer advantages over multi-zone models without the issues associated with CFD modelling. Different flow scenarios have been tested. Well mixed and zonal modelling results have been compared to CFD predicted pollutant distribution which has been used as reference solution. CFD simulations have been validated by means of literature available experimental data. Sensitivity analysis has been performed to determine the impact of various modelling parameters on the accuracy of the simulation. In particular, the influence of capturing local effects, such as the plume rising from the cooking range, is presented...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{demand for}} {{temporary}} buildings has increased {{during the last}} few years. The main reason for this increase is the need for temporary housing. Â This thesis contains the development of a construction solution that locks, joins and seals sandwich panels together in temporary buildings. This solution also explains how to mount, de-mount and re-mount the buildings and was developed in cooperation with the commissioning company Swetech Design AB. Â  The project has been limited to just the horizontal joints of Swetech Design ABÂ´s sandwich panels. Â The panels which the construction solution is going to be applied on have the dimensions of 2703 mm in height, 2297 mm in width and a thickness of 206 mm. The core consists of cellular plastic that is laminated with a material that consists of fiberglass and polyester. Â  The pre-study consisted of literature studies of various types of joints, the important properties needed in order to make an <b>airproof</b> construction and the various building requirements for temporary residents. The pre-study also consisted of a visit to the module building company Mobile Composite Solutions (MCS) which helped in acquiring knowledge of mounting big units and the manufacturing technique RTM. Even inventories in different branches were made, to get knowledge around the different possibilities and variations of locking, sealing and joining parts. Â  After the completion of the pre-study a requirements specification and two function analysis where made that put demands and requirements on the concept solution and expressed the concept in terms of functions instead of solutions. The requirements specification and the function analysis became the base of the idea generating phase. This phase resulted in partial solutions and complete solutions which were then combined together to establish different concepts. Through elimination methods, screening tools and discussions together with the commissioning company a final concept was chosen. The concept is built on a tension joint in combination with a sealing profile and a locking device made of an angle steel, bolt and nut which can join and seal the sandwich panels. Â  The concept has been visualized in the form of sketches, CAD-model, a physical model on a cut-out between two sandwich panels in scale 1 : 1, basic drawings and a component list. A proposal for continued work has also been presented in order to assure that the construction meets all the requirements listed in the requirements specification and {{to make it possible for}} the commissioning company to implement the concept...|$|E
