5|$|Cannery Row {{is set in}} Monterey, California, before World War II. In Sweet Thursday, Doc {{returns from}} the war to find Cannery Row almost deserted {{and many of his}} {{colorful}} friends gone. Even his close friend Dora, who ran the Bear Flag Restaurant, a whorehouse, has died, and her sister Fauna has taken her place as madam. A former social worker, Fauna teaches the girls how to set a table properly, hopeful they will marry wealthy men. Doc's friends Mack (Mac in Pipe Dream) and Hazel (both men) are still around. They decide Doc's discontent is due to loneliness, and try to get him together with Suzy, a prostitute who has just arrived in Monterey. The two have a brief romance; disgusted by her life as <b>a</b> <b>hooker,</b> Suzy leaves the bawdy house and moves into an abandoned boiler. She decides she cannot stay with Doc, but tells her friends that if Doc fell ill, she would care for him. The accommodating Hazel promptly breaks Doc's arm as he sleeps, bringing the two lovers back together. At the end, Doc and Suzy go off to La Jolla to collect marine specimens together.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Chris has a pimple on {{his face}} which he names “Doug.” Lois worries about Chris, as Doug tells Chris to make some mischief. He goes to the Swansons' house and sets a bag of feces on fire on their porch, and writes “That’s enough, John Mayer” in spraypaint {{on the wall of}} the Quahog Mini-Mart. Lois sees Chris sneaking back into his room and is going to punish him but Chris tells her that Doug said he does not have to listen to her. This outrages Lois, {{deciding}} to go to Goldman's Pharmacy the next day and get some astringent to get rid of Doug. However, the next day, as Peter and Lois head to Goldman’s, they realize there has been a break-in, and someone has destroyed Mort’s entire stock of acne medication. That night, when Brooke comes over for dinner to meet Brian’s family, Doug tells Chris to lift up Brooke’s shirt, while Stewie asks how long Brooke has been <b>a</b> <b>hooker.</b> He does this, shocking and offending the family. Joe comes in, saying he has proof that it was Chris who vandalized, broke into Goldman’s Pharmacy and stole Mort's acne medication. Chris decides he no longer wants to listen to Doug after he made his mom cry, but Doug says he could make Chris punch himself, or even worse, shoot him in the brain. Chris finally winds up at the dermatology clinic, and a struggle ensues as Doug tries to shoot him in the brain, but Chris manages to overpower him and use cortisone on Doug, finally taking him out.|$|E

25|$|Ziegler's {{presence}} allows Kubrick {{to change}} {{the mechanics of the}} story in a few ways. In the film, Bill first meets his piano-playing friend at Ziegler's party, and then while wandering around town, seeks him out at the Sonata Café. In the novella, the café encounter with Nightingale is a delightful coincidence. Similarly, the dead woman whom Bill suspects of being the woman at the party who saved him is a baroness that he was acquainted with earlier, not <b>a</b> <b>hooker</b> at Ziegler's party.|$|E

25|$|The {{lyrics and}} storyline {{of the musical}} are based on Mary Main's biography, , which drew heavily upon the {{accounts}} of anti-Perónist Argentines. Shortly after the musical appeared, Nicholas Fraser and Marysa Navarro published a more neutral account of Eva Perón's life, Evita: The Real Lives of Eva Perón, in which they claim that many of Main's assertions (which had influenced Rice's lyrics) were false, such as the suggestion that Eva had first gone to Buenos Aires as the mistress of a married musician, Agustín Magaldi. Instead, they wrote, Eva's mother Doña Juana had taken her there when she aspired to become a radio actress. Some critics also suggested that Rice's lyrics disparaged Evita's achievements unnecessarily, particularly her charity work. According to Navarro and Fraser, was based {{for the most part}} on the earliest and seamiest versions of Evita's life, something happened to the tale in its retelling and the Evita who emerged each evening, dressed first as a teenager, then <b>a</b> <b>hooker,</b> and finally, in tulle and silver foil, as First Lady, was far from being unsympathetic.|$|E

A drugged-up JR, unaware that his bone marrow has been stolen, insists to his family and Babe that he was drugged and he knows Richie did this to him.

She goes on a mission to find out what other stuff Richie has done to JR or anyone else.

Trina decides to tell the truth about Richie and her part in framing JR when Richie stole his bone marrow. JR promises Trina some money to get out of prostituting and go somewhere Richie is not due to fear that Richie will kill her since she told JR what Richie did.

500|$|According to {{film critic}} Roger Ebert, Susie adheres to the Hollywood {{tradition}} of being depicted as <b>a</b> <b>hooker</b> {{with a heart}} of gold, while her tough demeanor {{is little more than}} an act. Matt Brunson of Creative Loafing described Susie as a [...] "tough-talking, street-smart" [...] character who is [...] "always ready with a quip (or a sharp counter to a quip)." [...] Writing for The Daily Beast, Elizabeth Kaye identified Susie as [...] "a woman who must battle to keep her emotions from showing". Film Quarterlys Steve Vineberg wrote that the character boasts [...] "a cannily concealed underlayer of childlike dreaminess," [...] comparing her appearance and wardrobe to that of singer Ricky Lee Jones. Wounded by life, Susie wears an [...] "armor" [...] that is both impenetrable yet makes others want to experience more of the character. Kaye felt that the role was especially poignant for Pfeiffer, who in real life had still been recovering from an affair with actor John Malkovich {{at the same time she}} was filming The Fabulous Baker Boys.

500|$|Andrew Barr {{was born}} in Wellington, New Zealand, on 10December 1915; he had a twin brother, Jack. The family moved to Australia when the boys were six. Growing up in Melbourne, Andrew {{attended}} Kew Public School and played Australian rules football. He was also the Victorian Schoolboys' 100 yards athletics champion three years in succession, from 1926 to 1928. In 1931, aged fifteen, he began his association with the Lord Somers Camp and Power House social and sporting organisations located at Western Port. After leaving school, Barr studied construction at Swinburne Technical College, but later took a diploma course in accountancy and made it his profession. He started playing rugby union in 1935 through {{a friend in the}} Power House club. Weighing [...] and just under [...] tall, Barr gained selection for Victoria as <b>a</b> <b>hooker</b> the following year. In 1939, he was chosen to play in the United Kingdom with the Australian national team, the Wallabies. The tour was cancelled less than a day after the team arrived in the UK on 2September, due to the outbreak of World WarII. Keen to serve as a fighter pilot, Barr initially tried to enlist in the Royal Air Force, but withdrew his application when told that it was unlikely he would fly anytime in the near future, and that he could expect only administrative duties in the interim.|$|E
500|$|For {{his role}} as Charley [...] "the Gent", the brother of Marlon Brando's {{character}} in Elia Kazan's On the Waterfront (1954), Steiger was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. Film writer Leo Braudy wrote that the [...] "incessantly repeated images of its taxicab confrontation between Brando and Rod Steiger have made the film iconic". The taxicab scene took eleven hours to shoot and was heavily scripted, despite Brando fuelling the popular myth in his autobiography that the scene was improvised. Brando stated that seven takes were needed because Steiger could not stop crying, which Steiger found to be unfair and inaccurate. Though Steiger retained great respect for Brando as an actor, he disliked {{him as a person}} and frequently complained during the production of Brando's [...] "predilection for leaving the set" [...] immediately after shooting his scenes. Steiger later remarked: [...] "We didn't {{get to know each other}} at all. He always flew solo and I haven't seen him since the film. I do resent him saying he's just <b>a</b> <b>hooker,</b> and that actors are whores". Steiger also responded unfavorably when he learned that Kazan had been awarded an honorary Oscar by the Academy in 1999. In a 1999 interview with BBC News, Steiger said he probably would not have done On the Waterfront if he had known at the time that Kazan provided the House Un-American Activities Committee with names of performers suspected of being Communists.|$|E
500|$|In 1995, the McNair and {{the band}} parted ways, with neither party giving a {{definitive}} rationale. Hopper explained [...] "We {{had a hard time}} recording Hot Boxing, because our drummer had {{a lot of things in}} the way... Nobody wants to hurt anyone, or to cut them out, but it was just like four adults getting a divorce, and their child is the band." [...] She has alternately explained that the split was due to the [...] "alternative lifestyles" [...] of McNair and the rest of the group and that McNair's musicianship was not as competent as the other members. The remaining trio recruited session drummer Josh Freese and engineers Sandy Solomon and Bernie Zwass to record a cover of Tom Waits' [...] "Christmas Card from <b>a</b> <b>Hooker</b> in Minneapolis" [...] at Plus Four Recordings Studios, in Sherman Oaks, California in June 1995 for the compilation album [...] Freese joined the group in November–December of that year in Los Angeles, California to record Rubbing Doesn't Help. Mould was unavailable, so the band relocated to Los Angeles and worked with producer Geza X at his home studio in attempt to make a more [...] "eclectic" [...] album that would represent the diversity of their songwriting. After hearing some demos, the band decided to hire him to produce the actual album and moved to Los Angeles for recording. The album produced the singles [...] "Open the Door" [...] and [...] "This Family" [...] (the former also had a music video), as well as the EP Fire All Your Guns at Once.

500|$|The episode {{contains}} {{a number of}} other cultural references. When Peter and Lois enter their motel room and find <b>a</b> <b>hooker</b> on the bed, Peter warns Lois to stay perfectly still, as the prostitute's vision is based on movement. This is a reference to a scene in the movie Jurassic Park (1993) in which Dr. Grant gives this warning in reference to a Tyrannosaurus Rex. Pinocchio appears in a cutaway gag, in which Gepetto bends over and deliberately sets Pinocchio up to tell a lie in an attempt to emulate anal sex. This was based on a joke MacFarlane's mother had told her friends when he was a child. Lois yells out George Clooney's name when she and Peter are having sex. The 1950s sitcom The Honeymooners is also referenced when a fictional episode of the sitcom is shown in which Ralph Kramden, the show's main character, hits his wife, Alice, something he would only threaten to do on the show. Meg watches an episode of the CBS sitcom Two and a Half Men, which shows three men in a living room, one of whom is cut in half at the waist and screaming in agony, the other two standing over him and screaming in horror. Fictional army soldier Flint of [...] appears briefly after Chris is caught drinking vodka, and educates the children on drinking and informs them that [...] "...knowing is half the battle". Flint's voice was provided by Bill Ratner, the actor who had voiced the character in the G.I. Joe television series. According to Seth Green, who voices Chris, the reason the Family Guy cast members did not voice Flint themselves is because if you have the original actor providing the voice [...] "you take it with a little bit more gravitas".|$|E
