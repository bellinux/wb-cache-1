Ma Tuyen was a Chinese merchant and friend who {{was reported to be}} Nhu's main contact with the Chinese syndicates which controlled the opium trade. The brothers sought asylum from the embassy of the Republic of China, but were turned down and stayed in Ma Tuyen's house as they appealed to ARVN loyalists and attempted to negotiate with the coup leaders.

5|$|As Wing Commander Kellett {{was taking}} off, Schumacher was dismissing <b>any</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> the British would attempt a bombing raid in clear weather. On {{the island of}} Wangerooge, Leutnant Hermann Diehl of Regiment 3, battery LN-Vers was demonstrating the Freya set to a visiting naval officer. Diehl was using Falck's 2./ZG 76 to test the set. After some demonstration, he swung the set north, {{pointing}} to the Heliogoland Bight. As soon {{as he did so}} he picked up an echo. He telephoned Schumacher's Geschwader at Jever. They were told that the naval radar reported nothing, and that it was ridiculous to think the British would attack in such clear skies. Diehl spoke to von Bülow-Bothkamp. No one wanted to know. Some 20 minutes later, naval Freyas also picked up the formation, but still no fighters were scrambled. German radar was just as efficient as its British counterpart, the problem lay in communication. The British married their radar to an efficient fighter control system. The Luftwaffe and Kriegsmarine had poor communication and their areas of responsibility overlapped, creating confusion over who was responsible. Added to this was the German disbelief that RAF Bomber Command would expose itself on a day when conditions favoured the fighter. Only when observers on the ground confirmed that the formation existed were fighters scrambled. The observers described a formation of 44 British aircraft, twice its actual strength.|$|E

[...] The critical and commercial disappointment of that album was swiftly followed by the success of the Traveling Wilburys. Dylan co-founded the band with George Harrison, Jeff Lynne, Roy Orbison, and Tom Petty, and in late 1988 their multi-platinum Traveling Wilburys Vol. 1 reached three on the US album chart, featuring songs that were described as Dylan's most accessible compositions in years. Despite Orbison's death in December 1988, the remaining four recorded a second album in May 1990 with the title Traveling Wilburys Vol. 3.|$|E
500|$|The Giants {{made the}} {{decision}} to hire a General Manager {{for the first time in}} team history following the 1978 season. [...] However, disagreements during the search caused severe friction and discord between Wellington and Tim Mara. At one point they had tried to hire Jan Van Duser, a league executive, but he declined the offer due to the ownership squabbles. Finally, the Maras asked NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle to step in with a recommendation. Rozelle discussed the hiring with former Giants Frank Gifford and Tom Scott, who recommended hiring George Young, who worked in personnel for the Miami Dolphins and had been an assistant coach for the Baltimore Colts. They had already recommended Young to Wellington and his son John who both liked the choice. But felt if Rozelle presented the recommendation as his own idea Wellington and Tim would be more likely to accept the pick, as relations were so bad that <b>any</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> came from one side was immediately rejected by the other. [...] Rozelle recommended Young, he was hired, and was instrumental in turning around the fortunes of the franchise. [...] "Oh, there is no question he helped save the franchise," [...] John Mara said. [...] "It looked like a no-win situation. He came in and overhauled everything we did in a more professional way." [...] Despite the hiring and subsequent success, the rift between the Maras lasted for several years and, at one point a partition had to be put between the two in the owner's box.|$|E

500|$|On 1 December, Benfica won {{its first}} league match {{in their new}} stadium, beating Rio Ave by 2–0. After the match, Camacho defended his team to the press by saying [...] "Eusébio's team is gone." [...] A week later, the team {{defeated}} Paços de Ferreira away, with João Pereira scoring two goals. Because Porto had lost points, Benfica were now only six points {{from the top of}} the league. On the 13th, Benfica won their fifth match in a row, beating Braga at home. After the game, Camacho angrily refuted <b>any</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> Benfica did not play accordingly to expectations: [...] "A poor performance? That's not what I saw. In football there are two teams. Everyone knows that, against Benfica, all teams give their best, and we suffer that in the first half, because Braga played like every other team here. It is like the story of the bottle, for the optimist it is half full; for the pessimist, it is half empty." [...] On the same day, they were drawn with Rosenborg in the upcoming round of the UEFA Cup. The following Wednesday, Benfica progressed through the fifth round of the Portuguese Cup, with Luisão scoring a single goal in an away win against Académica. The final game of the month came on the 21st, with a 3–0 win to Estrela da Amadora. Two goals within the first ten minutes allowed the team to comfortably manage the remaining time. Camacho later said that Benfica could have scored six or seven goals. This was the team's seventh win in a row, the longest streak of consecutive wins in Camacho's time at Benfica.|$|E

[...] And then, while Lynch shot the home movie that James takes of Donna and Laura, he realized that Lee had something special. [...] "She did do another scene—the video with Donna on the picnic—and it was that scene that did it."

Domitian was at the harshest part of his rule, and almost no one had the courage to speak <b>any</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> was unlike his, but Quintilian did. He spoke as an orator in the tradition of Cicero, such as had not been seen since the beginning of the reign of Augustus.

2500|$|In Gaelic poetry Scone's {{association}} with kings and king-making gave it various poetic epithets, for instance, Scoine sciath-airde, [...] "Scone of the High Shields", and , [...] "Scone of the Noisy Shields".

Scone was therefore the closest thing the Kingdom of Scotland had in its earliest years to a [...] "capital". In either 1163 or 1164 King Malcolm IV described Scone Abbey as , [...] "in the principal seat of our kingdom". By this point, however, {{the rule of the}} King of the Scots was not confined to the Kingdom of Scotland, which then only referred to Scotland north of the river Forth. The king also ruled in Lothian, Strathclyde and the Honour of Huntingdon, and spent much of his time in these localities too. Moreover, the king was itinerant and had little permanent bureaucracy, so that <b>any</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> Scone was a [...] "capital" [...] in the way the word is used today can make very little sense in this period.

[...] Although the work is commonly attributed to Cranmer, its detailed origins are obscure [...] A group of bishops and divines met first at Chertsey and then at Windsor in 1548, drawn from both conservatives and reformers, agreed only [...] "the service of the church {{ought to be in}} the mother tongue" [...] Cranmer collected the material from many sources; even the opening of Preface (above) was borrowed [...] He borrowed much from German sources, particularly from work commissioned by Hermann von Wied, Archbishop of Cologne; and also from Osiander (to whom he was related by marriage) [...] The Church Order of Brandenberg and Nuremberg was partly the work of the latter. Many phrases are characteristic of the German reformer Martin Bucer, or of the Italian Peter Martyr, (who was staying with Cranmer {{at the time of the}} finalising of drafts), or of his chaplain, Thomas Becon.
