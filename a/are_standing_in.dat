Sarah Jane declines {{a second}} chance of {{travelling}} in the TARDIS, having finally decided {{to move on with}} her life and stop waiting for the Doctor. Mickey says he would like to join the TARDIS crew, a suggestion of which Sarah Jane approves. She then asks Rose to stay with the Doctor, and to find her one day if she needs to. Sarah Jane then gets a chance to part properly with the Doctor, who leaves her with a brand new K9 as a parting gift.|$|E
5|$|The {{stadium is}} the third largest used by a Swedish {{football}} club, behind AIK's Friends Arena and Djurgårdens IF's and Hammarby IF's Tele2 Arena, both located in Stockholm. In league matches, the stadium has a capacity of 24,000, of which 18,000 are seated, and 6,000 <b>are</b> <b>standing.</b> <b>In</b> European matches, the 6,000 standing places are converted to 3,000 seats, making the stadium a 21,000-capacity all-seater. Swedbank Stadion opened in April 2009, and replaced Malmö Stadion, where Malmö FF had been based since 1958. The new ground was originally budgeted to cost 398million kronor, but ultimately cost 695million kronor (€79.7). It is a UEFA category 4-rated stadium, and is thus able to host all UEFA club competition matches, except for finals. The ground's record attendance, 24,148, was set in an Allsvenskan match between Malmö FF and Mjällby AIF on 7 November 2010: in this match, Malmö FF won 2–0 and clinched that year's national championship.|$|E

25|$|Law 21: No ball. A ball {{can be a}} no {{ball for}} several reasons: if the bowler bowls from the wrong place; or if he {{straightens}} his elbow during the delivery; or if the bowling is dangerous; or if the ball bounces more than once or rolls along the ground before reaching the batsman; or if the fielders <b>are</b> <b>standing</b> <b>in</b> illegal places. A no ball adds one run to the batting team's score, in addition to any other runs which are scored off it, and the batsman can't be dismissed off a no ball except by being run out, hitting the ball twice, or obstructing the field.|$|E
500|$|The video {{opens with}} a scene of group member Amelle Berrabah, who is {{spread out on the}} floor and {{surrounded}} by multiple men. Berrabah, Buchanan and other group member Heidi Range join together and walk on a bridge, which is constructed by the men's bodies. Later, Buchanan straddles onto two men who pretend to be a motorbike. Berrabah and Range then drive a car made from the men's bodies. During the milk bar scene, the trio are surrounded by men who are used as tables and lamps. Another scene shows Berrabah and Range in a car constructed by the men. At the end of the video, Range uses a microphone to yell at the men who <b>are</b> <b>standing</b> <b>in</b> a line.|$|E

500|$|The {{album is}} named after the {{nickname}} Dumont's seventh grade teacher had for Disneyland, which is in Anaheim, California, where the band members grew up. It is a pun on the popular nickname for Disneyland—"The Magic Kingdom". The album photography and portraits were taken by photographer fine artist Daniel Arsenault. Gwen is featured in the foreground {{while the rest of}} the band members <b>are</b> <b>standing</b> <b>in</b> an orange grove in the background. Gwen pushed for Eric to be included on the album cover—a source of tension for the band—reasoning that although he had left the band, he had still contributed substantially to the album. Eric is seen near the back of the picture, looking away from the camera. The pictures on the cover and in the liner notes were taken on city streets in their native Orange County (namely Anaheim and City of Orange) and in orange groves. The red dress Gwen wears on the cover was loaned to the Hard Rock Cafe and was later displayed at the Fullerton Museum Center in an exhibit titled [...] "The Orange Groove: Orange County's Rock n' Roll History". The dress, appraised as high as US$5,000, was stolen from the exhibit in January 2005.|$|E

[...] To carry out a task the player would enter a text command such as take apple or attack dragon. [...] Movement around the game environment is generally accomplished by entering the direction (or an abbreviation of it) in which the player wishes to move, for example typing north or just n would cause the player to exit the current area via the path to the north.|$|E

2500|$|Jean-Bertrand Aristide was {{initially}} {{denied access to}} Haiti by Haitian immigration authorities, despite issuing appeals for entrance to his supporters and international observers. The world's most prominent governments did not overtly oppose such appeals, nor did they support them; an unnamed analyst [...] "close to the Haitian government" [...] quoted in several media sources including The New York Times {{is reported to have}} said: [...] "Aristide could have 15 passports and he's still not {{going to come back to}} Haiti France and the United States <b>are</b> <b>standing</b> <b>in</b> the way." [...] However, Aristide finally returned to Haiti on 18 March 2011, days before the 2011 presidential election.|$|E
2500|$|Margaret Koster's new suggestion, {{discussed}} above and below, that the portrait is a memorial one, {{of a wife}} already dead {{for a year or}} so, would displace these theories. [...] Art historian Maximiliaan Martens has suggested that the painting was meant as a gift for the Arnolfini family in Italy. It had the purpose of showing the prosperity and wealth of the couple depicted. [...] He feels this might explain oddities in the painting, for example why the couple <b>are</b> <b>standing</b> <b>in</b> typical winter clothing while a cherry tree is in fruit outside, and why the phrase [...] "Johannes de eyck fuit hic 1434" [...] is featured so large in the centre of the painting. [...] Herman Colenbrander has proposed that the painting may depict an old German custom of a husband promising a gift to his bride on the morning after their wedding night. He has also suggested that the painting may have been a present from the artist to his friend.|$|E
2500|$|The {{southeast}} panel {{illustrates the}} opening ritual when the principal participant is elaborately dressed {{and is being}} handed a bundle of spears. This {{is part of an}} initial activity before the game itself starts. Overlooking this scene is the death deity who rises from a vat of liquid, perhaps pulque. The glyphs above the deity identify it with the planet Venus. [...] Next is the southwest panel in which a different ceremonial preparation is depicted. The principal participant is supine on a kind of a sofa. Two musicians are playing a turtle shell drum and clay rattles. A figure dressed as an eagle dances in front while a skeletal deity flies above and the death deity rises from liquid. The northwest panel shows the beginning of the ballgame. Two participants <b>are</b> <b>standing</b> <b>in</b> the center of the court with speech scrolls emerging from their mouths. One holds a large knife in his left hand and gestures with his right. Between them are intertwined slashes, the symbol of the ballgame and a ball. At their waists are the protective and ritual accoutrements which are very similar to the stone yokes, palmas and hachas common in elite burials. Behind the players are two figures, one with a deer head, who are watching from the court walls as well as the death deity again above. The northeast panel indicates that the game has been played and one of the participants is about to be sacrificed by having his head cut off. The three figures are all dressed in the garments and symbols of the ballgame. The center figure has his arms held back by the one on the left. The figure on the right holds a large knife which is at the center figure’s neck. [...] There are scrolls indicating speech from the sacrifice as well as a depiction of the skeletal god.|$|E
