5|$|Although Australia was {{remote from}} the main battlefronts, there was {{considerable}} Axis naval activity in <b>Australian</b> waters during the Second World War. A total of 54 German and Japanese warships and submarines entered <b>Australian</b> waters between 1940 and 1945 and attacked ships, ports and other targets. Among the best-known attacks are the sinking of HMAS Sydney by a German raider in November 1941, the bombing of Darwin by Japanese naval aircraft in February 1942, and the Japanese midget submarine attack on Sydney Harbour in May 1942. In addition, many Allied merchant ships were damaged or sunk off the <b>Australian</b> coast by submarines and mines. Japanese submarines also shelled several <b>Australian</b> ports and submarine-based aircraft flew over several <b>Australian</b> capital cities.|$|E

50|$|Although the {{countries}} of origin of Arab <b>Australians</b> are all primarily Islamic (>70%), emigrants to Australia from these states belonged to various religious orders not proportional to their home countries religious demographics. Most Egypt-born and Lebanon-born <b>Australians</b> were Christian Copts (84%) and Maronites (55%), respectively. The majority of Arab <b>Australians</b> are overwhelmingly Lebanese, and collectively, Christian Arab <b>Australians</b> (including Lebanese Christian <b>Australians</b> together with other Christian Arab <b>Australians)</b> comprise a majority of Arab <b>Australians.</b> The proportion of Muslims was highest among immigrants from Somalia (97% of Somali <b>Australians</b> are Muslim) and Jordan (40% of Jordanian <b>Australians</b> are Muslim), followed by Syria (34% of Syrian <b>Australians</b> are Muslim) and Iraq (31% of Iraqi <b>Australians</b> are Muslim).|$|R

5|$|Australia has {{maintained}} military forces since federation {{as a nation}} in January 1901. Shortly after Federation, the <b>Australian</b> Government established the <b>Australian</b> Army and Commonwealth Naval Force by amalgamating the forces each of the states had maintained. In 1911, the Government established the Royal <b>Australian</b> Navy, which absorbed the Commonwealth Naval Force. The Army established the <b>Australian</b> Flying Corps in 1912 although this separated to form the Royal <b>Australian</b> Air Force in 1921. The services were not linked by a single chain of command, as they each reported to their own separate Minister and had separate administrative arrangements. The three services saw action around the world during World War I and World War II, and took part in conflicts in Asia during the Cold War.|$|E

50|$|Several of {{the clubs}} {{currently}} {{playing in the}} league were formed as the soccer arm of cultural associations of recently migrated <b>Australians,</b> with certain teams having associations with particularly nationalities e.g. Swan Italian Club (now Swan United), Bayswater Inter (now Bayswater City) and Perth Italia (now Perth SC) with Italian <b>Australians,</b> Morley Windmills with Dutch <b>Australians,</b> Floreat Athena with Greek <b>Australians,</b> Benfica United (now Fremantle Spirit) with Portuguese <b>Australians,</b> Inglewood Kiev (now Inglewood United) with Ukrainian <b>Australians,</b> North Perth Croatia (now Western Knights) and Spearwood Dalmatinac (now part of Cockburn City) with Croatian <b>Australians,</b> Shamrock Rovers with Irish <b>Australians,</b> Dianella White Eagles with Serbian <b>Australians</b> and Stirling Macedonia (now Stirling Lions) with Macedonian <b>Australians.</b> In 1994 clubs were forced by the sport's governing body to remove all references to ethnicities from their names, which resulted in several name changes. It is only recently that clubs have begun to be based geographically, with Mandurah City and ECU Joondalup recently established clubs.|$|R

5|$|Australians {{took part}} in all of Bomber Command's major offensives and {{suffered}} heavy losses during raids on German cities and targets in France. The <b>Australian</b> contribution to major raids was often substantial, and the <b>Australian</b> squadrons typically provided about 10percent of the main bomber force {{during the winter of}} 1943–44, including during the Battle of Berlin. Overall, the <b>Australian</b> squadrons in Bomber Command dropped 6percent of the total weight of bombs dropped by the command during the war. <b>Australian</b> aircrew in Bomber Command had one of the highest casualty rates of any part of the <b>Australian</b> military during World WarII. Although only two percent of Australians enlisted in the military served with Bomber Command, they incurred almost 20percent of all <b>Australian</b> deaths in combat; 3,486were killed and hundreds more were taken prisoner.|$|E

5|$|Following {{several weeks}} of air attacks and a short naval bombardment, {{soldiers}} of the <b>Australian</b> 24th Brigade were landed on Labuan from American and <b>Australian</b> ships on 10 June. The Australians quickly captured the island's harbour and main airfield. The greatly outnumbered Japanese garrison was mainly concentrated in a fortified position {{in the interior of}} Labuan, and offered little resistance to the landing. The initial <b>Australian</b> attempts to penetrate the Japanese position {{in the days after the}} invasion were not successful, and the area was subjected to a heavy bombardment. A Japanese raiding force also attempted to attack Allied positions on 21 June, but was defeated. Later that day, <b>Australian</b> forces assaulted the Japanese position. In the following days, <b>Australian</b> patrols killed or captured the remaining Japanese troops on the island. A total of 389 Japanese personnel were killed on Labuan and 11 were captured. <b>Australian</b> casualties included 34 killed.|$|E

Fuller was the only woman painter to be represented. A critic writing in The West <b>Australian</b> observed:The work... is essentially <b>Australian</b> in almost every detail. Standing in a sunlit <b>Australian</b> paddock, a lithesome <b>Australian</b> blonde holds her summer hat on against the rude caresses of an <b>Australian</b> breeze—a subject simple but grand in its simplicity... Next to its suggestion of breezy sunshine and the incidental portrayal of willowy grace the picture is to be admired for its colour scheme... The details of the picture disclose untiring care.|$|E

40|$|As a group, Indigenous <b>Australians</b> {{experience}} poorer {{health outcomes}} than other <b>Australians,</b> {{including in the}} area of sexual health. Indigenous <b>Australians</b> have substantially higher rates of STIs, BBVs and teen pregnancy than non-Indigenous <b>Australians,</b> particularly for chlamydia, gonorrhoea, infectious syphilis, hepatitis B and hepatitis C. Efforts to reduce these high rates are compounded by the historical and social context of Indigenous <b>Australians.</b> Although many <b>Australians</b> may experience elements of shame and embarrassment when they access health services for STIs and BBVs, for many Indigenous <b>Australians</b> there also exists a mistrust of ‘mainstream’ (non-Indigenous specific) health services as a result of past injustices and racially differentiated treatment (Arabena 2006). Historically, Indigenous <b>Australians</b> diagnosed with an STI were segregated and placed into privately run hospitals (‘lock hospitals’) that were in poor condition (Hunter 1998) ...|$|R

40|$|This study {{explored}} {{why and how}} Indigenous and non-Indigenous <b>Australians</b> {{remember the}} past. Indigenous <b>Australians</b> traditionally share a strong oral tradition in which customs, personal and cultural histories, and other narratives are passed across groups and between generations by word of mouth. Drawing on this tradition, in which inherent value is placed on sharing knowledge and maintaining connectedness with others, we hypothesised that Indigenous <b>Australians</b> {{would be more likely}} than non-Indigenous <b>Australians</b> to report reminiscing to fulfil social functions (but not self or directive functions). Furthermore, we hypothesised that Indigenous <b>Australians</b> would recall personal past experiences more elaborately than would non-Indigenous <b>Australians.</b> In Study 1, 33 Indigenous <b>Australians</b> and 76 non-Indigenous <b>Australians</b> completed Webster's Reminiscence Functions Scale. As predicted, Indigenous participants reported higher scores on subscales related to social functions than did non-Indigenous Australians: particularly “Teach/Inform” and “Intimacy Maintenance”. They also scored higher on the “Identity” subscale. In Study 2, 15 Indigenous and 14 non-Indigenous <b>Australians</b> shared three memories from the distant and recent past. While Indigenous and non-Indigenous narratives did not differ in either emotion or elaboration, Indigenous <b>Australians</b> provided more memory context and detail by including a greater proportion of semantic memory content. Taken together, these findings suggest differences in both why and how <b>Australians</b> remember. 16 page(s...|$|R
