5000|$|Like other municipalities, Seattle {{initially}} <b>adopted</b> <b>a</b> <b>nuisance</b> abatement {{strategy of}} attempting {{to shut down the}} most problematic motels under pretexts such as public health and fire safety violations or using taxation laws. In 2009, the city went further by <b>adopting</b> <b>a</b> [...] "Chronic <b>Nuisance</b> Properties" [...] ordinance penalising owners of businesses whose clientele had brought crime into a neighbourhood (as measured by the number of calls for service to police per 90-day or one-year period for an establishment) or allowing the city to revoke business licences and shut down a business entirely. There was no requirement that the owner actually be implicated in any alleged crimes; failure to keep criminal elements out of a tenement house, motel or other business constituted <b>a</b> <b>nuisance</b> for which the owner would be civically liable.|$|R
40|$|Nebraska Livestock Nuisance Law Until 1976 the Nebraska Supreme Court {{had ruled}} that animal feeding {{operations}} (AFOs) located {{in rural areas}} did not legally constitute <b>a</b> <b>nuisance</b> unless the AFO were improperly operated. However, in 1976 the Nebraska Supreme Court ruled that a rural AFO may constitute <b>a</b> <b>nuisance</b> even if properly operated. This decision made AFO operators liable {{for the first time}} in Nebraska if their AFO constituted <b>a</b> <b>nuisance.</b> In 1977 the Nebraska Unicameral <b>adopted</b> <b>an</b> amendment to the Nebraska Environmental Policy Act defining when AFOs would legally constitute <b>a</b> <b>nuisance.</b> Basically, the statute said that an AFO was not <b>a</b> <b>nuisance</b> (1) if the AFO was there first, (2) if the AFO complied with all state and local regulations, and (3) if best management practices to minimize dust, odors and other nuisance factors were used in the AFO. In 1982 the Unicameral adopted the Nebraska Right to Farm Act, which gave farmers broader protection against nuisance lawsuits...|$|R

5000|$|By contrast, <b>a</b> <b>nuisance</b> per se is [...] "an activity, or an act, structure, instrument, or {{occupation}} {{which is}} <b>a</b> <b>nuisance</b> {{at all times}} and under any circumstances, regardless of location or surroundings." [...] Liability for <b>a</b> <b>nuisance</b> per se is absolute, and injury to the public is presumed; if its existence is alleged and established by proof, it is also established {{as a matter of}} law.

50|$|Most <b>nuisance</b> claims allege <b>a</b> <b>nuisance</b> in fact, for {{the simple}} reason that not many actions or {{structures}} have been deemed to be nuisances per se. In general, if an act, or use of property, is lawful, or authorized by competent authority, it cannot be <b>a</b> <b>nuisance</b> per se. Rather, the act in question must either be declared by public statute, or by case law, to be <b>a</b> <b>nuisance</b> per se. There are few state or federal statutes or case law declaring actions or structures to be <b>a</b> <b>nuisance</b> in and of themselves. Few activities or structures, in and of themselves and under any and all circumstances, are a nuisance; which is how courts determine whether or not an action or structure is <b>a</b> <b>nuisance</b> per se.|$|R
5000|$|There are {{two classes}} of {{nuisance}} under the American law: <b>a</b> <b>nuisance</b> in fact, or [...] "nuisance per accidens", and <b>a</b> <b>nuisance</b> per se.

An alleged nuisance in fact {{is an issue of}} fact to be determined by the jury, who will decide whether the thing (or act) in question created <b>a</b> <b>nuisance,</b> by examining its location and surroundings, the manner of its conduct, and other circumstances. [...] A determination that something is <b>a</b> <b>nuisance</b> in fact also requires proof of the act and its consequences.|$|R
