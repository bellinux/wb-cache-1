5|$|Chapter 5 of the Varaha Upanishad is {{dedicated}} to Yoga, as a discussion between Ribhu and his student Nidagha. There are three types of Yoga, states the text, and these are Laya (soft), Mantra (mystic), and Hatha (middle), recommending Hatha Yoga as foremost of three. It discusses various aspects of Yoga, ranging from recommending that healthy food should be eaten in temperate quantities, in small portions, several times a day, to recommending that Yoga should not be performed when one is not feeling well or is very hungry. The goal of Yoga, states Varaha, is manifold, including the gain of body strength and suppleness, acquisition of knowledge of one's own body and its auras, meditation, <b>and</b> <b>Self</b> (soul) knowledge.|$|E
5|$|Early on 10 June {{another group}} of thirty-one men arrived at the 9th Parachute Battalion position. These and other stragglers, who had arrived through the night, brought the {{battalion}} strength to around 270 men. At 11:00 the Germans attacked 'A' Company again, {{but this time the}} attack was ill-coordinated and was easily repelled. Shortly afterwards the battalion killed around fifty Germans, who had started digging defences {{in full view of the}} British position. Then 'A' Company ambushed a German patrol, causing several casualties. That afternoon a strong force of Germans occupied the Château and used it as a base to start an infantry <b>and</b> <b>self</b> propelled gun assault on the British battalion. With no mortar ammunition left, the British had to use their PIATs and machine-guns to stop the attack.|$|E

5|$|By day four, 20September, {{the brigade}} still holding {{out at the}} bridge had been split into two groups during the night by the Germans who had managed to {{infiltrate}} close enough to separate them into positions east and west of the bridge road. Any movement was subjected to machine-gun and sniper fire and they were under almost constant mortar and artillery attack. Added to this were probes by tanks <b>and</b> <b>self</b> propelled guns, which approached the defenders' buildings and opened fire at point blank range. The brigade, out of anti-tank ammunition, could do nothing to stop them in the east, but the 6pounders in the west still proved an effective deterrent. During the day, Lieutenant John Grayburn of the 2nd Battalion was killed and later posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross for his bravery during the fighting at the bridge. That morning, communications with 1st Airborne Division were established and Frost, on asking for reinforcements and supplies, was informed that the division was surrounded at Oosterbeek and the brigade was on their own. Frost was later wounded and command of the brigade assumed by Major Frederick Gough of the reconnaissance squadron. By midday the brigade position was untenable and the last defenders were withdrawn into {{what had been the}} Headquarters Company, 2nd Battalion's position. By nightfall they were still holding out, and in the darkness some men tried unsuccessfully to break out. At dawn on day five, {{what was left of the}} brigade was forced to surrender.|$|E
5|$|In {{his first}} cabinet decision, Modi {{set up a}} team to {{investigate}} black money. On 9 November 2016, the government demonetised ₹500 and ₹1000 banknotes, with the stated intention of curbing corruption, black money, the use of counterfeit currency, and terrorism. The move led to widespread protests throughout the country, including one by opposition parties, which stalled the winter session of parliament. In the days following the demonetisation, banks across the country faced severe cash shortages, which had detrimental effects {{on a number of}} small businesses, on agriculture, and on transportation. People seeking to exchange their notes had lengthy waits, and several deaths were linked to the rush to exchange cash. Following Modi's announcement, the Indian stock indices BSE SENSEX and NIFTY 50 declined steeply. There has been a steep increase in digital payments and transactions in the country since the day demonetization was announced. Post the demonetisation, the quantum of income tax returns filed for individuals jumped by 25% indicating the widened tax net. Further, the advance tax collections rose by 42% <b>and</b> <b>Self</b> assessment tax collections rose by 34.25%.|$|E

Phenomenological interviews with Greek women are used to elicit consumption experiences linked to positive and negative aspects of the self. The interrelationships between desired <b>and</b> undesired <b>selves</b> in consumption were characterised by two patterns (first, conflicting, and second, compatible desired <b>and</b> undesired <b>selves)</b> that could be linked to consumers' different strategies. Examining these strategies, we extend previous work on the strategies that consumers use to handle identity issues. Finally, we evaluate this theory building derived from the Greek empirical data within the context of US-generated theory about individuals' ways of dealing with self-coherence issues through symbolic consumption; we identify consumers' sense of baffled <b>self</b> <b>and</b> ambivalence in the emotions surrounding consumption...|$|R

Mahone and Michael decide it is time to bring the Company down and save everyone; they decide to go after Lincoln first. They set up a trap for Christina, but the police arrive; one of Christina's guards is killed in an {{explosion}} set up by Michael and meant for Christina. Later Michael gives Scylla to Mahone without the hard drive and has him save Lincoln, while Michael goes after Sara. Mahone has a bomb in Scylla which is large enough to kill Christina and her man, Downey. Christina has Mahone put in the same room Lincoln is in, moving Lincoln {{to the other side of}} the room. When the bomb fails to detonate and Christina realizes there is something wrong with Scylla, she calls on Mahone to check the device and threatens to kill him if he cannot activate it. He sets it manually. After a struggle with Christina and Downey, Mahone runs to the room where Lincoln is; the bomb detonates, killing Downey, but Christina survives. Michael and Sara come to pick up Lincoln and Mahone and head to another location, where Scylla's hard drive is. The remaining team then heads to a hospital for supplies to treat Lincoln's gunshot wound. Sara and Mahone go into the hospital, and Mahone is arrested by Federal agents. He is later freed and exonerated when Michael delivers Scylla to Kellerman. In the series' epilogue (set four years later), Mahone, Lincoln, Sucre, Michael's child and Sara visit Michael’s grave at a beach.|$|E

40|$|The {{purposes}} of this study were (1) to investigate the relationship of the self concept to the concept of the occupational self (ideal occupant of the teaching role) as held by religious women high school teachers and lay women high school teachers, and. the effects of this self perception upon occupational change using of the Index of Adjustment and Values by R. E. Bills, and (2) to determine from the 15 personality variables of the Edwards Personal Preference Schedule the specific personality needs of teachers and the measure to which they agree or disagree with the general adult female population sample included in the manual. The research was planned to examine 15 hypotheses. The writer collected two tests and a questionnaire from each subject. These devices were administered at the early phase of the study. After the results had been divided into specific units, three analytical processes were used to evaluate the subjects' answers: (1) t test of significance, (2) analysis of variance and (3) one-way multivariate analysis of variance. There were 100 high school teachers involved in the study, 50 religious women and 50 lay women. The subjects ranged in age from 25 to 55 years. Each group of teachers included 25 subjects (25 - 35) and 25 subjects (3655). The length of tenure for religious women was from 2 years to 28 years, while tenure for lay women extended from 6 months to 20 years. Statistical processing of the data on the first 12 hypotheses consisted of the use of the t test of significance with repeated variables. Interactions were computed between (1) self concept, ideal self-concept <b>and</b> occupational <b>self</b> concept for all 100 teachers, (2) religious teachers and lay teachers on <b>self,</b> ideal <b>self</b> <b>and</b> occupational <b>self,</b> (3) <b>self,</b> ideal <b>self</b> <b>and</b> occupational <b>self</b> for religious teachers only <b>and</b> (4) <b>self,</b> ideal <b>self</b> <b>and</b> occupational <b>self</b> for lay teachers only. Calculation of these analyses led to significant or non-significant t's. Further processing of the data involved hypothesis 13 and consisted of the use of the analysis of variance and the one-way multivariate analysis of variance. Interactions were computed between the 50 religious women and the 50 lay women on all 15 variables of the EPPS. Calculation of this analysis led to the F ratio. Processing of data on hypotheses 14 and 15 consisted of the use of the t test on the compared variables. Interaction of the religious women and the lay women with the general adult female population sample was evaluated with a significant or non-significant t resulting. Review of all this data led to the following conclusions:The 100 teachers felt a discrepancy between their: (1) <b>self</b> concept <b>and</b> ideal <b>self</b> concept, (2) <b>self</b> concept <b>and</b> occupational <b>self</b> concept <b>and</b> (3) ideal <b>self</b> concept <b>and</b> occupational <b>self</b> concept. The religious teachers and the lay teachers felt similarly about their concept of <b>self</b> <b>and</b> their concept of the ideal occupant of the teaching role but felt a discrepancy in their views of the ideal self. Religious women felt dissimilarly about their views of <b>self</b> <b>and</b> ideal <b>self,</b> <b>self</b> <b>and</b> occupational <b>self</b> <b>and</b> ideal <b>self</b> <b>and</b> occupational <b>self.</b> Although lay teachers felt a discrepancy between <b>self</b> <b>and</b> ideal <b>self</b> <b>and</b> ideal <b>and</b> occupational <b>self,</b> their views of <b>self</b> <b>and</b> occupational <b>self</b> were similar. Religious women and lay women teachers had a similar need for achievement, deference, order, exhibition, autonomy, intraception, dominance, abasement, endurance and aggression. Religious women had a greater need than lay teachers for affiliation, succorance and nurturance. Lay teachers ahd a greater need for change and heterosexuality. When compared with the general adult female population sample, religious women teachers had a greater need for affiliation, succorance, intraception and dominance. When compared with this same group, lay teachers had a greater need for exhibition, intraception, dominance and heterosexuality. Teachers, as a group, had a greater need for achievement, exhibition, endurance, and aggression; the general adult female population (a sample contained in the EPPS manual) scored highest in deference, order, abasement, nurturance and endurance.

It takes as a case study Apart of and A Part From in which muscle and sense memory – touch, smell, taste, sound and sight – were the points of departure for a contemporary performance piece on migration and identity. This was a practice-as-research project aimed to better understand the artist’s body (myself) in improvisation with memory fragments. Working from a non-verbal frame the writing experience began as actions in space, then new memories in my body, to maps on paper, to key word and some staging patterns, to systematic capturing of the textual, rhythmic and spatial structures in the emerging 30 -minute performance. Various objects were incorporated to give aesthetic coherence of the piece.
