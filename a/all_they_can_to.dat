25|$|The Roman general Messala and {{his troops}} {{have come to}} track down the British king Arvire and bring him captive to the Emperor Claudius in Rome. Princes Irvin and Vellinus enter and tell the Romans their search is in vain: in his hiding place on Mona, Arvire can never be caught. Messala replies that Arvire might be taken by cunning and asks the princes to help him: their mother, Queen Élfrida, has already become an ally of Rome. Vellinus agrees to betray Arvire, {{although}} Irvin is outraged at his brother's behaviour. The brothers leave as the Druids arrive to perform their sacred ritual. Modred, the Chief Druid, says they must do <b>all</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>to</b> protect Arvire from the Romans. Arvire enters, accompanied by his daughter Évélina. Arvire is in despair: after his defeat in battle, the Romans captured his wife. Some of the Druids bring in Irvin and Vellinus, whom they have found lurking nearby. Vellinus says they have come with news from their mother, the Queen of Lenox, who now wants to aid Arvire against the Romans. They must bring Arvire back with them to lead the army. Vellinus even claims that he himself has fought the Romans and freed Arvire's wife. Arvire is delighted and eagerly leaves with Vellinus.|$|E

[...] Others dubbed Bryan a [...] "Popocrat". [...] On September 27, The New York Times published a letter by an [...] "eminent alienist" [...] who, based on an analysis of the candidate's speeches, concluded that Bryan was mad. [...] The paper editorialized on the same page that even if the Democratic candidate was not insane, he was at least [...] "of unsound mind". [...] For the most part, Bryan ignored the attacks, and made light of them in his account of the 1896 campaign. [...] Republican newspapers and spokesmen claimed that Bryan's campaign was expensively financed by the silver interests. [...] This was not the case: the mining industry was seeing poor times, and had little money to donate to Bryan.

2500|$|A {{variation}} on the horizontal stack offense is called a feature, German, or isolation (or “iso” for short). In this offensive strategy three of the cutters line up deeper than usual (this can vary from 5 yards farther downfield to at the endzone) while the remaining cutter lines up closer to the handlers. This closest cutter {{is known as the}} [...] "feature," [...] or [...] "German." [...] The idea behind this strategy is that it opens up space for the feature to cut, {{and at the same time}} it allows handlers to focus all of their attention on only one cutter. This maximizes the ability for give-and-go strategies between the feature and the handlers. It is also an excellent strategy if one cutter is superior to other cutters, or if he is guarded by someone slower than him. While the main focus is on the handlers and the feature, the remaining three cutters can be used if the feature cannot get open, if there is an open deep look, or for a continuation throw from the feature itself. Typically, however, these three remaining cutters do <b>all</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>to</b> get out of the feature's way.|$|E
