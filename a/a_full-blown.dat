5|$|Overnight on 25–26 June, {{tensions}} flared at the factory, {{leading to}} <b>a</b> <b>full-blown</b> ethnic brawl between Uyghurs and Han. As {{a result of}} the fighting, 2 Uyghurs died and 118 people were injured, 16 of them seriously. Of the injured, 79 were Uyghurs and 39 were Hans. 400 police and 50 anti-riot vehicles were mobilised.|$|E
5|$|The Ateneo de Manila University {{left the}} league in 1978 after the {{championship}} series against San Beda College where the final game was held behind closed doors. In September 1980, De La Salle University withdrew from the league after an August 17 game against Colegio de San Juan Letran turned into <b>a</b> <b>full-blown</b> riot {{which led to the}} game being called off. The league ordered the game to be replayed behind closed doors but the then-FIBA recognized basketball association, the Basketball Association of the Philippines, ordered the league to cancel the rest of the season.|$|E
5|$|An {{alternative}} is to test respondents at the researcher's facility with opening statements or <b>a</b> <b>full-blown</b> mock trial instead of reading a case summary over the telephone. The higher cost of a mock trial allows for a more realistic portrayal of the real trial and (researchers hope) more accurate data. It also provides a better opportunity to question the subjects, {{before and after the}} trial simulation. On the other hand, telephone surveys provide a larger and more representative sample of the jury pool. Diamond indicates that since both methods have advantages, SJS practitioners commonly rely on both in the same case.|$|E

In 1939 a British version The Dark Eyes of London was made, {{directed}} by Walter Summers, which turned Wallace's crime story into <b>a</b> more <b>full-blown</b> horror film.

5|$|However, {{there is}} no {{contemporary}} Byzantine account of the Tabuk expedition, {{and many of the}} details come from much later Muslim sources. It has been argued that there is in one Byzantine source possibly referencing the Battle of Mu´tah traditionally dated 629, but this is not certain. The first engagements may have started as conflicts with the Arab client states of the Byzantine and Sassanid empires: the Ghassanids and the Lakhmids of Al-Hirah. In any case, Muslim Arabs after 634 certainly pursued <b>a</b> <b>full-blown</b> invasion of both empires, resulting in the conquest of the Levant, Egypt and Persia for Islam. The most successful generals were Khalid ibn al-Walid and 'Amr ibn al-'As.|$|E
5|$|Though Arts and Crafts is {{specifically}} {{regarded as a}} movement within architecture, as opposed to <b>a</b> <b>full-blown</b> style, there are elements that are considered typical to buildings designed in the style. Examples include, dark, heavy woodwork and very simple ornamentation. The Oregon Public Library contains functional elements associated with that movement. Dark woodwork is found throughout the building, first in the stairwell to the gallery and its balusters and newel posts {{and then in the}} four-panel wooden interior door. The ceilings are coffered and have exposed wooden beams. Also located in the interior is a large 1909 wooden floor clock, a built-in storage cabinet, and two wooden fuse boxes that all evoke the Arts and Crafts movement.|$|E
5|$|Upon completion, {{the team}} felt that Alien Crossfire was somewhere between an {{expansion}} and <b>a</b> <b>full-blown</b> sequel. In {{the months leading}} {{to the release of}} Alien Crossfire, multimedia producer Michael Ely wrote the 9episodes of Centauri: Arrival, introducing the Alien Crossfire factions. The game initially had a single production run. Electronic Arts bundled Alpha Centauri and Alien Crossfire in the Alpha Centauri Planetary Pack in 2000 and included both games in The Laptop Collection in 2003. In 2000, both Alpha Centauri and Alien Crossfire were ported to Classic Mac OS by Aspyr Media and to Linux by Loki Software.|$|E

Variety wrote: [...] "Observation and narrative are so skillfully intertwined that every detail gestates <b>a</b> potential <b>full-blown</b> story and every story point teems with cultural contradictions.

5000|$|A teaser campaign, {{also known}} as a pre-launch campaign, is an {{advertising}} campaign which typically consists of a series of small, cryptic, challenging advertisements that anticipate <b>a</b> larger, <b>full-blown</b> campaign for <b>a</b> product launch or otherwise important event. These advertisements are called [...] "teasers" [...] or [...] "teaser ads". A teaser trailer for an upcoming film, television program, video game or similar, is usually released long in advance of the product, so as to [...] "tease" [...] the audience.|$|R
5|$|The riots {{took place}} {{several days after}} a violent {{incident}} in Shaoguan, Guangdong, where many migrant workers are employed {{as part of a}} programme to alleviate labour shortages. According to state media, a disgruntled former worker disseminated rumours in late June that two Han women had been raped by six Uyghur men. Official sources later said they found no evidence to support the rape allegation. Overnight on 25–26 June, tensions at the Guangdong factory led to <b>a</b> <b>full-blown</b> ethnic brawl between Uyghurs and Hans, during which two Uyghur co-workers were killed. Exiled Uyghur leaders alleged the death toll was much higher. While the official Xinhua News Agency reported that the person responsible for spreading the rumours had been arrested, Uyghurs alleged that the authorities had failed to protect the Uyghur workers, or to arrest any of the Han people involved in the killings. They organised a street protest in Ürümqi on 5 July to voice their discontent and to demand a full government investigation.|$|E
5|$|Woodlea's {{exterior}} {{was designed}} in an Italian Renaissance Revival style. The house {{is said to}} have been modeled after Kimberley Hall in Kimberley, Norfolk. Its classical devices of 18th-century English architecture include urns, pediments, columns, and balusters. The house also is <b>a</b> <b>full-blown</b> expression of the American Renaissance. Woodlea incorporates characteristics of the Beaux-Arts style of architecture– the exterior dictates the use of the interior, with family and guest rooms on the third floor. At the north end of the house, situated farthest from the main entrance, and of a size larger than most houses, is the service wing, which contains the servant quarters. Compared to the rest of the house, this wing has lower ceilings, smaller windows, and less exterior trim. In the early 1900s, the wing was clad in ivy.|$|E
5|$|When Harith {{arrived at}} Marw in early July 745, however, the {{situation}} had changed: Yazid was dead, <b>a</b> <b>full-blown</b> civil war had erupted in Syria, and Nasr ibn Sayyar, although still occupying the position of governor, lacked authority. Although he recognized Marwan II (r. 744–750), most of his own followers did not accept Marwan as Caliph. Harith was quick {{to distance himself from}} Nasr: he refused the offer of a district governorship, and distributed the gifts he received among his supporters. Harith vocally denounced Marwan II, and was soon joined by 3,000 of his fellow Tamimis, while his secretary, Jahm ibn Safwan, drummed up further support. Within a short time, he had become a graver threat to Nasr than al-Kirmani. After attempts to negotiate an agreement proved fruitless, Nasr attacked Harith's forces in March 746, and scored a first victory over them, in which Jahm ibn Safwan fell. At this point, al-Kirmani joined forces with Harith, and together they forced Nasr to abandon Marw and withdraw to Naysabur. The two allies entered the capital of Khurasan, but within days fell out and began fighting each other. In these clashes, Harith was killed, leaving al-Kirmani the master of the city. The conflict between Nasr and al-Kirmani continued, but was soon overtaken by events: exploiting the conditions of civil war, the Abbasids under Abu Muslim launched their own anti-Umayyad revolt in Khurasan. Nasr ibn Sayyar tried to conclude an alliance with al-Kirmani, but failed when the latter was murdered by one of Harith's sons in revenge. Abu Muslim managed to exploit the situation to his advantage, and in early 748, his men entered Marw, {{the first step in a}} war that would lead to the fall of the Umayyad dynasty and its replacement with the Abbasids two years later.|$|E

And then, as though she had caught his respectful but ardent regard, she melted away, leaving the fragrant emblems on the window-sill.|$|R

40|$|It is {{recognized}} that providing programmers with languages that {{are close to}} problem domain can increase productivity significantly. Creating <b>a</b> new <b>full-blown</b> language can be too expensive, therefore domain specific languages (DSL-s) are usually combined with a general purpose language (GPL). Generative programming {{has been shown to}} be useful for this kind of language extensions. This report focuses on technologies behind MetaBorg, a complete gen-erative programming solution proposed by Eelco Visser and his team. It provides means for combining syntaxes and semantics of a base GPL and DSL-s. Using the definition of combined language it creates tools for translating programs written in new language back to the base language. ...|$|R

This joint model takes an acoustic speech file as input and calculates the activation flows of candidate words {{on the basis of}} the degree of fit of the candidate words with the input. Experiments showed that SpeM outperforms Shortlist on the recognition of ‘real-life’ input.
