5000|$|The {{number of}} atoms in {{different}} ionization states <b>is</b> <b>determined</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Saha equation. This distribution <b>is</b> <b>determined</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> atomic ionization energy, {{and the local}} temperature.|$|R
5|$|The NBA Finals is the {{championship}} {{series of the}} National Basketball Association (NBA). The entrants <b>are</b> <b>determined</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> victors of the Eastern and Western conferences, who engage in a best-of-seven game series to determine the league champion. The winners of the Finals are awarded the Larry O'Brien Championship Trophy, which replaced the Walter A. Brown Trophy in 1983.|$|E
5|$|The {{multiple}} {{side chains}} of amino acids can also undergo chemical reactions. The types of these reactions <b>are</b> <b>determined</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> groups on these side chains and are, therefore, different {{between the various}} types of amino acid.|$|E
5|$|The troop {{program and}} {{activities}} <b>are</b> <b>determined</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> senior patrol {{leader and the}} patrol leaders council under the oversight of the Scoutmaster. Troops generally hold meetings weekly, although they can be irregular during the summer. Troop meeting activities may vary from training in Scout skills to planning camping trips or playing games.|$|E

5|$|An air-cuticle {{multilayer}} in {{the scales}} creates optical interference. Each scale contains cuticle layers with randomly located blocks of cuticle that {{hold them in}} place and maintain an air gap between them. The layers and air gaps are narrower than the wavelength of visible light. The structure varies from one layer at the proximal end of each scale, to about six layers at the distal end. This multilayer structure strongly reflects certain wavelengths of light, which <b>are</b> <b>determined</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> thicknesses of the layers and the angle at which the light hits the scale.|$|E
5|$|Paterson's worms are {{a family}} of {{cellular}} automata devised in 1971 by Mike Paterson and John Horton Conway to model the behaviour and feeding patterns of certain prehistoric worms. In the model, a worm moves between points on a triangular grid along line segments, representing food. Its turnings <b>are</b> <b>determined</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> configuration of eaten and uneaten line segments adjacent to {{the point at which}} the worm currently is. Despite being governed by simple rules the behaviour of the worms can be extremely complex, and the ultimate fate of one variant is still unknown.|$|E
5|$|Relations between Grand Lodges <b>are</b> <b>determined</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> {{concept of}} Recognition. Each Grand Lodge {{maintains}} {{a list of}} other Grand Lodges that it recognises. When two Grand Lodges recognise and are in Masonic communication with each other, {{they are said to}} be , and the brethren of each may visit each other's Lodges and interact Masonically. When two Grand Lodges are not in amity, inter-visitation is not allowed. There are many reasons why one Grand Lodge will withhold or withdraw recognition from another, but the two most common are Exclusive Jurisdiction and Regularity.|$|E

50|$|Child support <b>is</b> <b>determined</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> {{federal or}} provincial Child Support Guidelines. The basic ("table") {{amount of support}} <b>is</b> <b>determined</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> payer's income {{and the number of}} {{children}} in need of support.|$|R
5|$|For the {{purposes}} of constitutional venue, {{the boundaries of the}} states are questions of law to <b>be</b> <b>determined</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> judge, but the location of the crime is a question of fact to <b>be</b> <b>determined</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> jury.|$|R
5|$|The {{aerodynamics}} of a {{wind turbine}} are not straightforward. The air flow at the blades {{is not the}} same as the airflow far away from the turbine. The very nature of the way in which energy is extracted from the air also causes air to be deflected by the turbine. In addition the aerodynamics of a wind turbine at the rotor surface exhibit phenomena that are rarely seen in other aerodynamic fields. The shape and dimensions of the blades of the wind turbine <b>are</b> <b>determined</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> aerodynamic performance required to efficiently extract energy from the wind, and by the strength required to resist the forces on the blade.|$|E
5|$|The game {{features}} four scenarios {{including the}} prologue. The actions during the prologue determine {{who will be}} the central character in the story, either Jennifer Simpson or Helen Maxwell. The scenarios and player characters that follow <b>are</b> <b>determined</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> player's actions. There are five different endings per heroine depending on how the scenarios progress. After each scenario is a save screen and an intermission mode that allows the player to explore without the threat of Scissorman. During the intermission, the player can have conversations with various characters. The next scenario will begin after the required conditions of the intermission are met.|$|E
5|$|The {{growth rate}} hypothesis, {{also known as}} the {{resource}} availability hypothesis, states that defense strategies <b>are</b> <b>determined</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> inherent growth rate of the plant, which is in turn determined by the resources available to the plant. A major assumption is that available resources are the limiting factor in determining the maximum growth rate of a plant species. This model predicts that the level of defense investment will increase as the potential of growth decreases. Additionally, plants in resource-poor areas, with inherently slow-growth rates, tend to have long-lived leaves and twigs, and the loss of plant appendages may result in a loss of scarce and valuable nutrients.|$|E
30|$|Microbial biomass C (MBC) <b>was</b> <b>determined</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> {{chloroform}} fumigation-extraction method (Vance et al. 1987). Dehydrogenase activity <b>was</b> <b>determined</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> {{reduction of}} 2, 3, 5 -triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) to triphenylformazan (TPF) following <b>the</b> method proposed <b>by</b> Tabatabai (1982).|$|R
50|$|The round {{winner for}} each round <b>was</b> <b>determined</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> {{aggregation}} of championship points awarded in that round.

5|$|The laws of {{the game}} <b>are</b> <b>determined</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> International Football Association Board (IFAB). The board was formed in 1886 after a meeting in Manchester of The Football Association, the Scottish Football Association, the Football Association of Wales, and the Irish Football Association. FIFA, the {{international}} football body, was formed in Paris in 1904 and declared that they would adhere to Laws of the Game of the Football Association. The growing popularity of the international game led to the admittance of FIFA representatives to the International Football Association Board in 1913. The board consists of four representatives from FIFA and one representative {{from each of the}} four British associations.|$|E
5|$|Worldwide {{rates of}} either HSV-1 and/or HSV-2 are between 60 and 95% in adults. HSV-1 {{is more common}} than HSV-2, with rates of both {{increasing}} as people age. HSV-1 rates are between 70% and 80% in populations of low socioeconomic status and 40% to 60% in populations of improved socioeconomic status. An estimated 536 million people or 16% of the population worldwide were infected with HSV-2 as of 2003 with greater rates among women and in those in the developing world. Rates of infection <b>are</b> <b>determined</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> presence of antibodies against either viral species.|$|E
5|$|A batsman can be out lbw even if {{the ball}} did not hit his leg: for example, a batsman struck on the head could be lbw. However, he cannot be lbw if the ball pitches on the leg side of the stumps ("outside leg stump"), {{even if the}} ball would have {{otherwise}} hit the wickets. Similarly, a batsman who has attempted {{to hit the ball}} with his bat cannot be lbw if the ball strikes him outside the line of off stump. However, some shots in cricket, such as the switch hit or reverse sweep, involve the batsman switching between a right- and left-handed stance; this affects the location of the off and leg side, which <b>are</b> <b>determined</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> stance. The law explicitly states that the off side is determined by the batsman's position when the bowler commences his run-up.|$|E
30|$|Triacylglycerol (TG) and Total Cholesterol (Chol) <b>were</b> <b>determined</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> {{method of}} Neetu and Neelima, (2013) [10]. HDL – Cholesterol (HDL) <b>was</b> <b>determined</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> method of Leticia, (2014) [11]. LDL – Cholesterol (LDL) was <b>by</b> <b>the</b> {{equation}} of Friedwald [12]. (LDL-cholesterol (mg/dl)[*]=[*]Total Cholesterol –TG/ 5 – HDL-cholesterol). Glucose <b>was</b> <b>determined</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> methods of Basul et al. [13] and Renjie et al. [14]. Total Protein (TP) <b>was</b> <b>determined</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> method of Dipali et al. [15], (Biuret method). Albumin (ALB) was by dye binding method [16].

5|$|A {{person with}} MS can have almost any {{neurological}} symptom or sign, with autonomic, visual, motor, and sensory problems {{being the most}} common. The specific symptoms <b>are</b> <b>determined</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> locations of the lesions within the nervous system, and may include loss of sensitivity or changes in sensation such as tingling, pins and needles or numbness, muscle weakness, blurred vision, very pronounced reflexes, muscle spasms, or difficulty in moving; difficulties with coordination and balance (ataxia); problems with speech or swallowing, visual problems (nystagmus, optic neuritis or double vision), feeling tired, acute or chronic pain, and bladder and bowel difficulties, among others. Difficulties thinking and emotional problems such as depression or unstable mood are also common. Uhthoff's phenomenon, a worsening of symptoms due to exposure to higher than usual temperatures, and Lhermitte's sign, an electrical sensation that runs down the back when bending the neck, are particularly characteristic of MS. The main measure of disability and severity is the expanded disability status scale (EDSS), with other measures such as the multiple sclerosis functional composite being increasingly used in research.|$|E
5|$|Hit points (HP) are {{a measure}} of a character's {{vitality}} and health and <b>are</b> <b>determined</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> class, level and constitution of each character. They can be temporarily lost when a character sustains wounds in combat or otherwise comes to harm, and loss of HP {{is the most common}} way for a character to die in the game. Death can also result from the loss of key ability scores or character levels. When a PC dies, it is often possible for the dead character to be resurrected through magic, although some penalties may be imposed as a result. If resurrection is not possible or not desired, the player may instead create a new PC to resume playing the game.|$|E
5|$|In the {{standard}} periodic table, the elements {{are listed in}} order of increasing atomic number Z (the number of protons in the nucleus of an atom). A new row (period) is started when a new electron shell has its first electron. Columns (groups) <b>are</b> <b>determined</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> electron configuration of the atom; elements with {{the same number of}} electrons in a particular subshell fall into the same columns (e.g. oxygen and selenium are in the same column because they both have four electrons in the outermost p-subshell). Elements with similar chemical properties generally fall into the same group in the periodic table, although in the f-block, and to some respect in the d-block, the elements in the same period tend to have similar properties, as well. Thus, it is relatively easy to predict the chemical properties of an element if one knows the properties of the elements around it.|$|E
50|$|The {{pitch of}} a note <b>is</b> <b>determined</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> {{frequency}} of vibrations. For a vibrating string, <b>the</b> frequency <b>is</b> <b>determined</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> string's length, mass, and tension. Piano strings are wrapped around tuning pins, which are turned {{to adjust the}} tension of the strings.|$|R
30|$|Curb parking has adverse {{influences}} on operation safety of dynamic traffic. Among them, motor vehicle safety <b>is</b> <b>determined</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> severity of traffic conflict caused by curb parking. Non-motor vehicle safety <b>is</b> <b>determined</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> remaining lane width at the parking zone. The safety of crossing pedestrians <b>is</b> <b>determined</b> <b>by</b> whether <b>the</b> {{stopping sight distance}} of the driver is satisfied or not. The safety setting distance from parking zone to pedestrian crosswalk should <b>be</b> <b>determined</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> average travel speed of main traffic flow to a large extent.
