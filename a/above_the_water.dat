5|$|In 1870, a Flat-Earth proponent named John Hampden {{offered a}} £500 wager (equivalent to about £ in present-day terms) in a {{magazine}} advertisement to anyone who could demonstrate a convex curvature in {{a body of water}} such as a river, canal, or lake. Wallace, intrigued by the challenge and short of money at the time, designed an experiment in which he set up two objects along a six-mile (10km) stretch of canal. Both objects were at the same height <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>water,</b> and he mounted a telescope on a bridge at the same height <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> as well. When seen through the telescope, one object appeared higher than the other, showing the curvature of the earth.|$|E
5|$|Anhingas, {{also known}} as darters or snakebirds, are cormorant-like water birds with long necks and long, {{straight}} beaks. They are fish eaters, diving for long periods, and often swim with only their neck <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>water,</b> looking rather like a water snake.|$|E

5|$|Certain species form {{communities}} called microatolls, {{which are}} colonies whose top {{is dead and}} mostly <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> line, but whose perimeter is mostly submerged and alive. Average tide level limits their height. By analyzing the various growth morphologies, microatolls offer a low resolution record of sea level change. Fossilized microatolls can also be dated using Radiocarbon dating. Such methods can help to reconstruct Holocene sea levels.|$|E
5|$|Hippopotamuses {{appear to}} {{communicate}} vocally, through grunts and bellows, {{and they may}} practice echolocation, but {{the purpose of these}} vocalizations is currently unknown. Hippos have the unique ability to hold their heads partially <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> and send out a cry that travels through both water and air; individuals respond above and under water. Hippos will also express threat and alarm with exhalations.|$|E
5|$|Its {{distribution}} is now restricted to Uruguay and nearby Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, but it previously ranged northward into Minas Gerais, Brazil, and southward into eastern Argentina. The Argentine form {{may have been}} distinct from the living form from Brazil and Uruguay. L.molitor is a large rodent, with the head and body length averaging , characterized by a long tail, large hindfeet, and long and dense fur. It builds nests <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>water,</b> supported by reeds, {{and it is not}} currently threatened.|$|E

5|$|Storm petrels use {{a variety}} of {{techniques}} to aid flight. Most species will occasionally feed by surface pattering, holding and moving their feet on the water's surface while holding steady <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>water.</b> They remain stationary by hovering with rapid fluttering or by using the wind to anchor themselves in place. This method of feeding flight is more commonly used by Oceanitidae storm petrels however. Northern storm petrels also use dynamic soaring, gliding across wave fronts gaining energy from the vertical wind gradient.|$|E
5|$|The {{periscopes}} {{also had}} problems with their optics: periscope users reported difficulty in refocusing after changing magnification, duplication of images, and bands across the field of vision. These problems were attributed to RAN demands that the optical view be the first exposed when a periscope was raised <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>water,</b> instead of placing the infrared sensor and single-pulse radar at the head as on other submarines, requiring the optical path to be routed around these components. The periscopes were gradually improved, and were no longer a problem {{by the time the}} fast track submarines entered service.|$|E
5|$|Warrior {{was heavily}} {{damaged by the}} German shells, which caused large fires and heavy flooding, {{although}} the engine room crew - of whom only three survived - kept the engines running for long enough {{to allow her to}} withdraw to the west. She was taken in tow by the seaplane tender HMS Engadine who took off her surviving crew of 743. She was abandoned in a rising sea at 8:25a.m. on 1 June when her upper deck was only 4feet (1.2m) <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>water,</b> and subsequently foundered.|$|E

5|$|While the {{superstructure}} {{and two of}} {{the four}} main gun turrets were removed, the barbette of one of the turrets remains visible <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>water.</b> Since her sinking, oil still leaks from the hull, with more than 2.3 quarts (2.18l) escaping into the harbor per day. The Navy, in conjunction with the National Park Service, has recently overseen a comprehensive computerized mapping of the hull, being careful to honor its role as a war grave. The Navy is considering non-intrusive means of abating the continued leakage of oil to avoid the further environmental degradation of the harbor.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{watertight}} bulkheads extended well <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> line, {{they were}} not sealed at the top. If too many compartments were flooded, the ship's bow would settle deeper in the water, and water would spill from one compartment to the next in sequence, rather like water spilling {{across the top of}} an ice cube tray. This was what happened to Titanic, which had suffered damage to the forepeak tank, the three forward holds and No.6 boiler room, a total of five compartments. Titanic was only designed to float with any two compartments flooded, but it could remain afloat with certain combinations of three or even four compartments (the first four) open to the ocean. With five compartments, the tops of the bulkheads would be submerged and the ship would continue to flood.|$|E
5|$|At 2:42 PM on April 11, 1945, off {{the coast}} of Kikaijima Island, a Japanese fighter pilot in an A6M5c Zero {{launched}} a kamikaze attack on the USS Missouri. Bill Obitz, a Seaman at the time, recalled that the attacking plane approached at an extreme angle and estimated that it was 20 feet (6 m) <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>water.</b> Although struck by intense antiaircraft fire, the plane survived and struck the ship's starboard side at frame 169 below the main deck. While the impact of one of the plane's wings started a fire at 5-inch mount number 3, its 500-pound bomb did not detonate, so the damage was minimal. There were no American casualties, but the Japanese pilot died. Parts of the plane's wreckage and {{the top half of the}} pilot's body landed on board the Missouri. The plane's wing was turned over to the crew to be cut up for souvenirs.|$|E

5|$|Behavior {{is known}} {{mainly from the}} marsh rice rat and O.couesi, with some {{scattered}} data from the other species. Oryzomys are semiaquatic, spending {{much time in the}} water, and otherwise mainly live on the ground; both the marsh rice rat and O.couesi are known to be excellent swimmers and will flee into the water when disturbed. Both are also active during the night and build nests of interwoven vegetation, which may be suspended <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>water.</b> Breeding may occur throughout the year in both species, but is known to be seasonally variable in the marsh rice rat. In both, gestation takes about 21 to 28days and litter size is usually one to seven, averaging three to five. Young marsh rice rats and O.couesi become reproductively active when about 50days old.|$|E
5|$|Egg-laying {{takes two}} {{different}} forms {{depending on the}} species. The female in some families has a sharp-edged ovipositor with which she slits open a stem or leaf of a plant {{on or near the}} water, so she can push her eggs inside. In other families such as clubtails (Gomphidae), cruisers (Macromiidae), emeralds (Corduliidae), and skimmers (Libellulidae), the female lays eggs by tapping {{the surface of the water}} repeatedly with her abdomen, by shaking the eggs out of her abdomen as she flies along, or by placing the eggs on vegetation. In a few species, the eggs are laid on emergent plants <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>water,</b> and development is delayed until these have withered and become immersed.|$|E
5|$|Fitzgerald had {{no system}} {{to monitor the}} {{presence}} or amount of water in her cargo hold, {{even though there was}} always some present. The intensity of the November 10 storm would have made it difficult, if not impossible, to access the hatches from the spar deck. The USCG Marine Board found that flooding of the hold could not have been assessed until the water {{reached the top of the}} taconite cargo. The NTSB investigation concluded that it would have been impossible to pump water from the hold when it was filled with bulk cargo. The Marine Board noted that because Fitzgerald lacked a draft-reading system, the crew had no way to determine whether the vessel had lost freeboard (the level of a ship's deck <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>water).</b>|$|E
