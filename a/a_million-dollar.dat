5|$|A {{recurring}} plot {{element is}} {{the depiction of}} Kyle as insecure about Jewish traditions and beliefs. Already regarding God as cruel for allowing him to suffer from a life-threatening hemorrhoid while Cartman enjoys <b>a</b> <b>million-dollar</b> inheritance, Kyle became further appalled after being read the story of Job.
