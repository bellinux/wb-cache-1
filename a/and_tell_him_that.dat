You wouldn't have guessed it, I did it when Mother was either out or asleep, and no one saw me do it. For the guns, I disassembled them and discarded them in different places. When I am found, which has already been done, please give this typewriter to Craig , <b>and</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> I hope that his child is a boy, it will (help) him in his work.

25|$|Season 5 follows two {{timeline}}s. The first timeline {{takes place}} on the island where the survivors who were left behind erratically jump forward and backward through time. In one of these time periods, John speaks with Richard Alpert, one of the Others, who says that to save the island, he must bring everyone back. John goes to the same underground station Ben went to. After moving the wheel himself, John is transported to the Sahara in 2007, as the time shifts on the island stop and the survivors are stranded with the Dharma Initiative in 1974. In 2007, John contacts the Oceanic Six, but {{no one wants to}} return. The last one of the Oceanic Six he finds is a depressed Jack. John tells Jack his father is alive on the island. This seriously affects Jack, and he begins taking flights, hoping to crash on the island again. Ben finds John and kills him. After John's death, the Oceanic Six are told to board the Ajira Airways Flight 316 to return to the island and in order to go back, they have to take John Locke's body in the plane. They take the flight, but some land in 1977, in which they meet with the other survivors who are now part of the Dharma Initiative, and others land in 2007. The survivors in 1977 are told by Daniel Faraday that if they detonate a nuclear bomb at the hatch's construction site, the electromagnetic energy below it will be negated, and, thus, the hatch would never be built and, thus, their future could be changed. In 2007, John Locke apparently comes back to life. He instructs Richard Alpert to speak with a time-traveling John <b>and</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> he must bring everyone back to the island. After this, he goes to speak with Jacob. The season finale reveals that John Locke is still dead and another entity has taken over his form just to make Ben kill Jacob. In 1977, Juliet detonates the fission core taken from the hydrogen bomb.|$|E

500|$|The {{book also}} {{explains}} {{the philosophy of}} social determinism held by those Dalrymple interviewed, and how the welfare state and the socialist tenets within it help feed this mindset. However, Dalrymple never directly accuses socialism and the welfare state in his essays, instead focusing on the beliefs and reasons for why the patients and inmates take the destructive actions that they did. This is expressed with determinism in {{that they believe that}} their actions must be based on their childhoods or the failure of society in the past to help them. Those patients that Dalrymple speaks with [...] "seem surprised <b>and</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> he's the first person they've ever talked to who suggests that they can change their lives for the better," [...] further emphasising the mindset in which their society has placed them.|$|E
500|$|The Lone Gunmen come to Mulder's {{apartment}} in disguise <b>and</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> they cannot find Scully.

[...] Meanwhile, Scully wakes up in a cabin in Pennsylvania in pajamas instead of her clothes, and accuses The Smoking Man of drugging her. He claims she was merely exhausted {{and he was trying}} to make her comfortable. [...] She attempts to leave but decides to continue when The Smoking Man tells her she's free to go and that the choice of whether to accept his help or not is hers. Mulder and The Lone Gunmen go to Skinner to figure out why Scully was communicating with Cobra. They find that an anonymous person has hacked into Scully's computer and has been sending Cobra messages calling for a meeting. The group believe that it is the work of The Smoking Man, but Skinner still does not know how {{to get a hold of}} him. At dinner, The Smoking Man tells Scully that the cure he possesses is not just the cure for cancer, but for all human disease, and that it is extraterrestrial. The Smoking Man goes outside and tells the man who has been following them that Cobra has not shown. Scully finds a note under her dessert plate saying to meet at Calico Cove at dawn. She goes alone and is stopped by Cobra, who gives her a disc before being shot and killed by a sniper. The sniper also attempts to kill Scully, but is killed by The Smoking Man.|$|E
500|$|Pierce married Gloria McCreadie, who he {{had dated}} since high school, on October 22, 1949, {{and they have}} three children, William Reed (born July 6, 1953), Patricia [...] "Patti" [...] Crowley (born October 4, 1955) and Robert Walter (born July 16, 1958). Pierce told one {{interviewer}} of his wife, [...] "She's not only a loyal fan, but a smart one, {{and there was the}} day I had to go to Marty Marion – he was the White Sox manager then – <b>and</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> he'd better change our bunt sign because Gloria had stolen it, so very likely the opposition would be stealing it too." [...] Although he had by then been traded to the Giants, following the 1962 season they relocated from Birmingham, Michigan to the southwest Chicago suburb of Evergreen Park. (For several years while he was with the White Sox, they had also maintained a summer residence in the south side's landmark Flamingo-on-the-Lake Apartments, where teammate Jim Rivera and his family also lived.) He remained a member of the White Sox community relations department into his late 80s, making frequent public appearances in the Chicago area. In addition, beginning in 1993 he headed the not-for-profit Chicago Baseball Cancer Charities, a cause he began supporting after Nellie Fox's death in 1975 at age 47. On June 29, 2013, the White Sox gave out souvenir statuettes of Pierce to fans at that day's game against the Cleveland Indians, and he threw out the ceremonial first pitch. Pierce died in Palos Heights, Illinois on July 31, 2015 at the age of 88 from gallbladder cancer. Pierce was a 33rd Degree Mason of Evergreen Park Lodge; his funeral was held at Evergreen Park Presbyterian Church, and he was entombed in Chapel Hill Gardens South Cemetery in Alsip.|$|E

2500|$|Stovall {{remembers the}} events of 1942, when having {{recently}} arrived and been thrown into action, the 918th had gained the reputation of a [...] "hard luck group" [...] suffering from poor morale. One reason is the strategy of daylight precision bombing of German targets and the corresponding losses to anti-aircraft fire and enemy aircraft. The commander, Colonel Keith Davenport (Gary Merrill), has become too close to his men to instil discipline. When he is ordered to fly a mission at low altitude to increase accuracy, Davenport rushes to headquarters and confronts his friend, Brigadier General Frank Savage (Gregory Peck) the Assistant Chief of Staff for Operations. His behavior prompts Savage to go to General Pritchard, the commanding general of VIII Bomber Command (Millard Mitchell) <b>and</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> he feels Davenport may not be fit to command. Following a disastrous mission in which the 918th loses seven bombers, General Pritchard relieves Davenport of command and the 918th is given to Savage.|$|E

2500|$|Spain and Britain were {{rivals in}} Europe, {{and since the}} two {{countries}} had both founded empires in the New World, their rivalry continued there as well. In 1733 a British vessel, the Rebecca, commanded by Captain Robert Jenkins, was seized in the Caribbean by the Spanish coast guard. [...] Suspecting that the British had been trading illegally with Spanish colonies (which was forbidden by both Spain and Britain), the Spanish searched the ship. A fight broke out between the Spanish and British sailors. In the skirmish, Jenkins had his ear cut off by a Spanish officer, who {{picked it up and}} said [...] "Take this to your king <b>and</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> if he were here I would serve him in the same manner!" [...] When Jenkins reported the incident to British authorities, they used it as a pretext to declare war on Spain in 1739. The war was called the War of Jenkins Ear.|$|E

2500|$|When Alfie Moon (Shane Richie), {{landlord}} of The Queen Victoria pub, {{decides to}} start a pub football team, he struggles {{to get people to}} sign up. His wife Kat Moon (Jessie Wallace) takes over as manager and flirts to get people to sign up. After the first match, they host a party and Kat flirts with her chef Ray Dixon (Chucky Venn), former lover Michael Moon (Steve John Shepherd) and brothers Max (Jake Wood), Jack (Scott Maslen) and Derek Branning (Jamie Foreman), sharing a close moment with each of them. While in the kitchen alone, an unseen person enters and he and Kat have sex. She feels guilty the next day and tries to ignore his calls and text messages. She finally responds to a phone call and meets him to ask him to leave her alone. However, as he walks away she changes her mind and they continue the affair. She then fears Alfie will find out so tries to end the affair again. Her lover sends her a mobile phone to contact him on, but she bins it. However, when a romantic evening with Alfie goes wrong, she retrieves the phone and contacts her lover. She later receives a key to a nearby flat, and when Alfie pays more attention to the organisation of the football team, Kat heads to the flat to meet her lover, who is waiting. The affair continues with Alfie clueless. Kat hears that a fight has broken out between members of the football team, and fears that the truth has come out. However, it has not. The fight spills over into The Queen Victoria, and later, Kat tends to her lover's wounds. Alfie catches them but is none the wiser. The mystery man later leaves Kat a bandage with [...] "I love you" [...] written on in lipstick. Kat hides it in with some laundry. Alfie then asks Kat to move out following an outbreak of bed bugs in the pub. She does not want to go as she does not want to continue her affair, but she cannot resist. Alfie later finds the bandage, but assumes it is from Kat and sends her a message in the pub's window saying [...] "I love you 2". Kat later ignores her lover's messages, and he tells her that he has got the message—that she is no longer interested. She throws away the key, but it is found by Jean Slater (Gillian Wright), who leaves it on the bar, thinking it belongs to a punter. Kat then takes it and later meets her lover at the flat. Kat ends up staying the night and gets her friend Kim Fox (Tameka Empson) to cover for her the next day. Kat receives flowers from her lover, and tells Alfie they are from her father, Charlie Slater (Derek Martin). Kat angrily telephones her lover, telling him she will always contact him. Alfie then grows suspicious, as Charlie would not send roses to Kat, and asks her to be honest with him. Kat then admits to having an affair. Alfie demands to know the details but Kat refuses to tell him who her lover is. Alfie ejects Kat from their home, where she meets Michael, to whom she discloses the affair. He urges Kat to fix her relationship, so she goes back to Alfie and says she will do anything to make it right. He gets her to phone her lover <b>and</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> the affair is over for good. After this, she smashes her phone and the couple go away on a [...] "make or break" [...] holiday.|$|E
