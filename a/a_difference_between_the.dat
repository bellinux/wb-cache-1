5|$|It {{should be}} noted that the {{relative}} atomic mass of the electron Ar(e) is measured relative to the mass of a carbon-12 atom (divided by 12). When the Avogadro constant is set in the new SI, atomic masses might be measured in dalton (by fixing the Avogadro constant), instead of atomic mass units (by fixing the mass of carbon-12), thus resulting in <b>a</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> values of the relative atomic mass and the atomic mass in units of dalton.|$|E

5|$|The sparsely haired tail {{is about}} as long as the head and body. It is dark brown above and lighter below. In contrast, the tail of H.megacephalus has little to no {{difference}} in color between the upper and lower surface. In 2006, Weksler and colleagues noted tail coloration as <b>a</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> two species of Transandinomys (bicolored in T.talamancae and unicolored in T.bolivaris), but in their 1998 study, Musser and colleagues could not find differences in tail coloration between their Panamanian samples of the two species.|$|E

25|$|The {{frontiers of}} the empire were {{sometimes}} well known and therefore easy to mark, such as the dykes constructed between the royal demesne of the King of France and the Duchy of Normandy.

25|$|A Cochrane review came to {{the result}} that endometrial injury {{performed}} in the month prior to ovarian induction appeared to increase both the live birth rate and clinical pregnancy rate in IVF compared with no endometrial injury.

Evidence suggested that endometrial injury on the day of oocyte retrieval was associated with a lower live birth or ongoing pregnancy rate.|$|E
25|$|Studies {{have also}} shown <b>a</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> sexes on who touches when.

Patterson indicated that men fulfilling this social role would touch more and after initial touch in casual relationships and as the relationship became more intimate during serious dating or marriage relationships, women would touch more. American culture still dictates that men ‘make the first move’ {{in the context of a}} dating relationship.|$|E
25|$|Huntington {{had begun}} long {{negotiations}} with Harriman about consolidating the Los Angeles electric railways beginning in 1907.

25|$|A {{systematic}} error or bias occurs {{when there is}} <b>a</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> true value (in the population) and the observed value (in the study) from any cause other than sampling variability. An example of {{systematic error}} is if, unknown to you, the pulse oximeter you are using is set incorrectly and adds two points to the true value each time a measurement is taken. The measuring device could be precise but not accurate. Because the error happens in every instance, it is systematic. Conclusions you draw based on that data will still be incorrect. But the error can be reproduced in the future (e.g., by using the same mis-set instrument).|$|E
25|$|Because antineutrinos and neutrinos are neutral particles, it is {{possible}} that they are the same particle. Particles that have this property are known as Majorana particles, after the Italian physicist Ettore Majorana who first proposed the concept. For the case of neutrinos this theory has gained popularity as it can be used, in combination with the seesaw mechanism, to explain why neutrino masses are so small compared to those of the other elementary particles, such as electrons or quarks. Majorana neutrinos have the property that the neutrino and antineutrino could be distinguished only by chirality; what experiments observe as <b>a</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> neutrino and antineutrino could simply be due to one particle with two possible chiralities.|$|E
25|$|Ramsey in {{his article}} disagrees with Keynes's {{approach}} as for him there is <b>a</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> notions of probability in physics and in logic. For Ramsey probability {{is not related to}} a disembodied body of knowledge but is related to the knowledge that each individual possesses alone. Thus personal beliefs that are formulated by this individual knowledge govern probabilities, leading to the notions of subjective probability and Bayesian probability. Consequently, subjective probabilities can be inferred by observing actions that reflect individuals' personal beliefs. Ramsey argued that the degree of probability that an individual attaches to a particular outcome can be measured by finding what odds the individual would accept when betting on that outcome.|$|E

25|$|There is {{a genetic}} {{difference}} between domestic and wild populations. There is also such <b>a</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> domestication traits that researchers believe {{to have been}} essential at {{the early stages of}} domestication, and the improvement traits that have appeared since the split between wild and domestic populations. Domestication traits are generally fixed within all domesticates, and were selected during the initial episode of domestication of that animal or plant, whereas improvement traits are present only in a proportion of domesticates, though they may be fixed in individual breeds or regional populations. The dog was the first domesticant and was established across Eurasia {{before the end of the}} Late Pleistocene era, well before cultivation and before the domestication of other animals.|$|E
25|$|Hauerwas {{believes}} that there is <b>a</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> concept of death and the criteria for death. The concept of death “involves a philosophical judgment of a significant change {{that has happened in}} a person” and therefore “is a correlative of what one takes to be the necessary condition of human life, e.g., … the potential for consciousness”. The criteria of death, however, are “those empirical measurements that can be made to determine whether a person is dead, such as cessation of respiration or a flat EEG”. Thus, brain death is a criterion of death that may serve “as a symbol of when it is time to die”. A person must not delay death so long that it is no longer possible to die a good death.|$|E
25|$|There is <b>a</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> form of Anglo-Cornish {{spoken in}} west Cornwall and {{that found in}} areas further east. In the eastern areas, the form of English that the {{formerly}} Cornish-speaking population learnt was the general south-western dialect, picked up primarily through relatively local trade and other communications {{over a long period}} of time. In contrast, in western areas, the language was learned from English as used by the clergy and landed classes, some of whom had been educated at the English universities of Oxford and Cambridge. English was learned relatively late across the western half of Cornwall (see map above) and this was a more Modern English style of language, since the standard form itself was undergoing changes. Particularly in the west, the Cornish language substrate left characteristic markers in the Anglo-Cornish dialect.|$|E
