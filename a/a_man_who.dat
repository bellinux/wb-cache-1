5|$|Chard {{claims to}} be the birthplace of powered flight, as it was here in 1848 that the Victorian {{aeronautical}} pioneer John Stringfellow (1799–1883) first demonstrated that engine-powered flight was possible through his work on the Aerial Steam Carriage. James Gillingham (1839–1924) from Chard pioneered the development of articulated artificial limbs when he produced a prosthesis for <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> lost his arm in a cannon accident in 1863.

5|$|Contrary to {{the view}} here popularized by Cassius Dio, however, Nerva had in fact little choice with regard to his successor.

The only {{candidate}} with sufficient military experience, consular ancestry, and connections was Trajan. Likewise, Edward Gibbon's assertion that Nerva hereby established a tradition of succession through adoption among the Five Good Emperors has found little support among modern historians.|$|E

5|$|Her is a 2013 American comedy-drama film written, directed, and {{produced}} by Spike Jonze. The film's musical score was composed by Arcade Fire, with the cinematography provided by Hoyte van Hoytema. It marks Jonze's solo screenwriting debut. The film follows Theodore Twombly (Joaquin Phoenix), <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> develops {{a relationship with}} Samantha (Scarlett Johansson), a female voice produced by an intelligent computer operating system. The film also stars Amy Adams, Rooney Mara, and Olivia Wilde.|$|E

5|$|If {{the account}} of Gilli in the {{aftermath}} of Clontarf has been constructed for dramatic effect, the passage may not be evidence of his floruit beyond this point in history. In fact, it is possible that he is identical to Gilla Ciaráin mac Glún Iairn (died 1014), <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> was amongst those slain at the battle. The Annals of Ulster, which records the latter's fall, styles him rígdamna Gall ("heir-designate of the Foreigners"), revealing that Gilla Ciaráin was indeed a prominent man. Sitriuc is known to have had an elder brother named Glún Iairn, <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> had reigned as King of Dublin until his death in 989. If Gilla Ciaráin was a son of this king, his apparent tender age {{at the time of his}} father's death could account for Sitriuc's accession to the kingship. Furthermore, the aforesaid title accorded to Gilla Ciaráin appears to indicate that he was regarded as his uncle's royal heir. If Gilli and Gilla Ciaráin are indeed identical, his pre-eminent status in the Norse-Gaelic world would help to explain his marital alliance with Sigurðr.|$|E
