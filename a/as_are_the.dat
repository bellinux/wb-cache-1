5|$|Above is the Great Chamber, an {{impressive}} {{room with a}} barrel ceiling with geometrical plaster decoration featuring John Lyte's arms and those of his wife, Edith Horsey. This ceiling is a rare survival. The wall above the bed displays the royal coat of arms and Tudor roses, signifying Lyte's loyalty to King Henry VIII (whose government Lyte represented in Somerset). The panelling is 17th century, <b>as</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> great four poster bed and the tapestries on the walls. Some of the original oak panelling of the room {{may have been used}} {{in the construction of the}} canopy of the bed.|$|E
5|$|Among Seattle's {{prominent}} annual {{fairs and}} festivals are the 24-day Seattle International Film Festival, Northwest Folklife over the Memorial Day weekend, numerous Seafair events throughout July and August (ranging from a Bon Odori celebration to the Seafair Cup hydroplane races), the Bite of Seattle, {{one of the}} largest Gay Pride festivals in the United States, and the art and music festival Bumbershoot, which programs music as well as other art and entertainment over the Labor Day weekend. All are typically attended by 100,000people annually, <b>as</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> Seattle Hempfest and two separate Independence Day celebrations.|$|E
5|$|Birds {{are often}} {{important}} to island ecology. Birds have frequently reached islands that mammals have not; on those islands, birds may fulfil ecological roles typically played by larger animals. For example, in New Zealand the moas were important browsers, <b>as</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> kereru and kokako today. Today the plants of New Zealand retain the defensive adaptations evolved {{to protect them}} from the extinct moa. Nesting seabirds may also affect the ecology of islands and surrounding seas, principally through the concentration of large quantities of guano, which may enrich the local soil and the surrounding seas.|$|E

50|$|Historically {{the titles}} of Tennō in Japanese have never {{included}} territorial designations <b>as</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> case with many European monarchs.

5|$|By mid-1813, Scott's health {{had begun}} to fail rapidly. He died on October 22, 1813, and was buried {{on the grounds of}} Canewood. At the time of his death, {{he was one of the}} last {{surviving}} generals of the Revolutionary War. His remains were re-interred at Frankfort Cemetery in 1854. Scott County, Kentucky, and Scott County, Indiana, are named in his honor, <b>as</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> cities of Scottsville, Kentucky, and Scottsville, Virginia.|$|E
5|$|Due to its {{location}} in the Pacific Ring of Fire, Seattle is in a major earthquake zone. On February 28, 2001, the magnitude 6.8 Nisqually earthquake did significant architectural damage, especially in the Pioneer Square area (built on reclaimed land, <b>as</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> Industrial District {{and part of the}} city center), but caused only one fatality.|$|E
5|$|High-quality fruits {{come from}} the Loire Valley and central France, {{including}} cherries grown for the liqueur Guignolet and the 'Belle Angevine' pears. The strawberries and melons are also of high quality. Fish are seen in the cuisine, often served with a beurre blanc sauce, as well as wild game, lamb, calves, Charolais cattle, Géline fowl, and high-quality goat cheeses. Young vegetables are used often in the cuisine, <b>as</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> specialty mushrooms of the region, champignons de Paris. Vinegars from Orléans are a specialty ingredient used as well.|$|E

5|$|In 2015, {{twenty-three years}} after he was {{inducted}} into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as one of the Beatles, Starr became the last Beatle to be inducted for a solo career. During the 50th Grammy Awards, Starr, George Martin and his son Giles accepted the Best Compilation Soundtrack award for Love. On 9 November 2008, Starr accepted a Diamond Award on behalf of the Beatles during the 2008 World Music Awards ceremony in Monaco. On 8 February 2010, he was honoured with the 2,401st star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame by the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce. It is located at 1750 North Vine Street, in front of the Capitol Records building, <b>as</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> stars for Lennon, McCartney and Harrison.|$|E
5|$|In Canada, {{every citizen}} {{has the right}} to {{petition}} the Crown for a grant of arms. Canadians who have been appointed to the Order of Canada are automatically entitled to receive an award of arms including the ribbon of the Order, or should they already be armigerous, to encircle their extant arms with the ribbon. Amongst others, all members of the Privy Council are entitled to supporters in their arms, <b>as</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> Speakers of the House of Commons and the Senate, Companions of the Order of Canada, Commanders of the Orders of Military Merit, Merit of the Police Forces, and of the Royal Victorian Order.|$|E
5|$|In autumn and winter, the {{extensive}} flood plain of the Shannon Callows supports {{a large number}} of waders, swans, wildfowl and other bird life. The most obvious of all Shannon birds is the mute swan. Also seen are the coot, moorhen and little grebe (or dabchick). The kingfisher is widespread <b>as</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> meadow pipit and pied wagtail. The area has one of the largest concentrations of breeding waders in Ireland including lapwing, redshank, sandpiper and godwit.|$|E

5|$|In {{terms of}} sales volume, most of today's beer {{is based on}} the pale lager brewed in 1842 in the town of Pilsen in the present-day Czech Republic. The modern pale lager is light in colour with a {{noticeable}} carbonation (fizzy bubbles) and a typical alcohol by volume content of around 5%. The Pilsner Urquell, Bitburger, and Heineken brands of beer are typical examples of pale lager, <b>as</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> American brands Budweiser, Coors, and Miller.|$|E
5|$|Like the Crown Estate, {{the land}} and assets of the Duchy of Lancaster, a {{property}} portfolio valued at £383million in 2011, are held in trust. The revenues of the Duchy form part of the Privy Purse, and are used for expenses not borne by the parliamentary grants. The Duchy of Cornwall is a similar estate held in trust to meet the expenses of the monarch's eldest son. The Royal Collection, which includes artworks and the Crown Jewels, is not owned by the Sovereign personally and is held in trust, <b>as</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> occupied palaces in the United Kingdom such as Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle.|$|E
5|$|M.challengeri is {{considered}} {{to have the most}} primitive morphology of any species of Metanephrops, having even fewer novelties than the oldest known fossil species, M.rossensis. Its rostrum is longer than that of other species in the thomsoni species group, and the ridge along the midline of the carapace only has two small spines. Unlike some other species of Metanephrops, the carapace is smooth, <b>as</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> abdominal tergae, and the chelipeds are covered in fine granules.|$|E

5|$|Modern cottage gardens include countless {{regional}} and personal variations and embrace plant materials, such as ornamental grasses or native plants {{not seen in}} the rural gardens of cottagers. Traditional roses, with their full fragrance and lush foliage, {{continue to be a}} cottage-garden mainstay — along with modern disease-resistant varieties that retain traditional attributes. Informal climbing plants, whether traditional or modern hybrids, are also common, <b>as</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> self-sowing annuals and freely spreading perennials favoured in traditional cottagers' gardens.|$|E

5|$|Much of the {{architecture}} of the town is undistinguished but {{there are a number of}} listed buildings, many of them in the more outlying areas but some are scattered throughout the town. The listed churches are the Anglican churches of St Luke's, Farnworth (and its adjacent bridewell), and St Mary's, West Bank, the Roman Catholic churches of St Michael's, St Marie's and St Bede's, and the two chapels in the cemetery. The railway stations of Widnes and Hough Green are listed, <b>as</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> former town hall and the former power house of the transporter bridge.|$|E
