She calls Dr. Marvin Monroe's radio call-in therapy {{show and the}} doctor urges her to confront Homer, who hears the call on a radio at work, feels bad and wonders how {{to change the way}} Marge feels about him. He goes to Moe's Tavern after work and, on Moe's advice, brings home a single rose and <b>a</b> <b>box</b> <b>of</b> <b>chocolates.</b> Marge's mood immediately softens, and Homer invites her to a dinner at a fancy restaurant, dancing, and spend a night at a motel.|$|E

The bribe was US$100 and <b>a</b> <b>box</b> <b>of</b> <b>chocolates,</b> and Collins became the first American pornography director to film in Budapest. The film starred Collins' wife Tianna, and features public sex scenes in front of the city's main tourist attractions.|$|E

500|$|At the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, Homer is {{disturbed}} that Mr. Burns {{can never}} remember his name, even after {{working for him}} for ten years. He takes a suggestion from Marge and sends Mr. Burns <b>a</b> <b>box</b> <b>of</b> <b>chocolates</b> with a family picture underneath the candy; however, Mr. Burns and Smithers {{are not interested in}} the one candy covering Homer's face and discard the box.

Although delighted, he was upset that Beryl went without official recognition, and said [...] "if somethin' was comin' our way, ah'd {{like it to be}} somethin' Beryl could have shared". Later that year the Formbys toured South Africa shortly before formal racial apartheid was introduced. While there they refused to play racially-segregated venues. When Formby was cheered by a black audience after embracing a small black girl who had presented his wife with <b>a</b> <b>box</b> <b>of</b> <b>chocolates,</b> National Party leader Daniel François Malan (who later introduced apartheid) phoned to complain.

5000|$|A {{movie theater}} projectionist and janitor (Buster Keaton) {{is in love}} with a {{beautiful}} girl (Kathryn McGuire). However, he has a rival, the [...] "local sheik" [...] (Ward Crane). Neither has much money. The projectionist buys <b>a</b> $1 <b>box</b> <b>of</b> <b>chocolates,</b> all he can afford, and changes the price to $4 before giving it and a ring to her.

When the father notices his watch is missing, the sheik slips the pawn ticket into the projectionist's pocket unnoticed. The projectionist, studying to be a detective, offers to solve the crime, but when the pawn ticket is found in his pocket, he is banished from the girl's home.|$|R
60|$|I glanced {{into the}} coupe {{which we were}} just passing. It seemed curious that even as the wish left his lips I should find myself looking into the dark eyes of the girl whose face had been so often in my {{thoughts}} {{during the last few}} days! Opposite her was the gray-bearded man Delora, already apparently immersed in a novel. Every seat in the compartment was laden with their small belongings,--dressing-bags, pillows, a large jewel-case, books, papers, flowers, and <b>a</b> <b>box</b> <b>of</b> <b>chocolates.</b> I turned to Louis.|$|E
60|$|Ruth and he were picnicking, vulgar and unashamed, {{among the}} dunes {{at the end}} of the long board-walk, like the beer-drinking, pickle-eating parties of {{fishermen}} and the family groups with red table-cloths, grape-basket lunches, and colored Sunday supplements. Ruth declared that she preferred them to the elegant loungers who were showing off new motor-coats on the board-walk. But Carl and she had withdrawn a bit from the crowds, and in the dunes had made a nest, with a book and a magazine and <b>a</b> <b>box</b> <b>of</b> <b>chocolates</b> and Carl's collapsible lunch-kit.|$|E
60|$|Having {{walked up}} and down the main street, and {{procured}} <b>a</b> <b>box</b> <b>of</b> <b>chocolates</b> and a few other things, the two Rovers wandered off {{in the direction of the}} railroad station. A train had just come in, and they watched the passengers alight and then others get aboard. They were particularly interested in the discomfiture of a fat traveling salesman who came puffing up on the platform, a suitcase in each hand, just in time to see the train depart. The fat man was very angry, but this availed him nothing.|$|E

60|$|Miss Pillenger was a wary {{spinster}} of austere views, uncertain age, and a deep-rooted {{suspicion of}} men--a suspicion which, {{to do an}} abused sex justice, they had done nothing to foster. Men had always been almost coldly correct in their dealings with Miss Pillenger. In her twenty years of experience as a typist and secretary she had never had to refuse with scorn and indignation so much as <b>a</b> <b>box</b> <b>of</b> <b>chocolates</b> from any of her employers. Nevertheless, she continued to be icily on her guard. The clenched fist of her dignity was always drawn back, ready to swing on the first male who dared to step {{beyond the bounds of}} professional civility.|$|E
6000|$|... “Mr. Penricarde,” said Mrs. Mullet, sinking {{her voice}} to what she {{imagined}} to be an impressive whisper, though it rather resembled a hoarse, excited squeak, “Mr. Penricarde has just begun to pay attentions to Jessie. Slight at first, but now unmistakable. I was a fool not to have seen it sooner. Yesterday, at the Rectory garden party, he asked her what her favourite flowers were, {{and she told him}} carnations, and to-day a whole stack of carnations has arrived, clove and malmaison and lovely dark red ones, regular exhibition blooms, and <b>a</b> <b>box</b> <b>of</b> <b>chocolates</b> that he must have got on purpose from London. And he’s asked her to go round the links with him to-morrow. And now, just at this critical moment, Toby has sold him that animal. It’s a calamity!” ...|$|E
60|$|Two {{days later}} he ransacked the best sweet shop in the {{neighbouring}} market town for <b>a</b> <b>box</b> <b>of</b> <b>chocolates</b> that by its size and contents should fitly atone for the dismal deed done under the oak tree in the meadow. The two first specimens that were shown him he hastily rejected; one had a group of chickens pictured on its lid, the other bore {{the portrait of a}} tabby kitten. A third sample was more simply bedecked with a spray of painted poppies, and Octavian hailed the flowers of forgetfulness as a happy omen. He felt distinctly more at ease with his surroundings when the imposing package had been sent across to the grey house, and a message returned to say that it had been duly given to the children. The next morning he sauntered with purposeful steps past the long blank wall {{on his way to the}} chicken-run and piggery that stood at the bottom of the meadow. The three children were perched at their accustomed look-out, and their range of sight did not seem to concern itself with Octavian’s presence. As he became depressingly aware of the aloofness of their gaze he also noted a strange variegation in the herbage at his feet; the greensward for a considerable space around was strewn and speckled with a chocolate-coloured hail, enlivened here and there with gay tinsel-like wrappings or the glistening mauve of crystallised violets. It was as though the fairy paradise of a greedyminded child had taken shape and substance in the vegetation of the meadow. Octavian’s bloodmoney had been flung back at him in scorn.|$|E
40|$|In a {{previous}} experiment {{the null hypothesis}} of no difference between real and hypothetical willingness to pay for <b>a</b> <b>box</b> <b>of</b> <b>chocolate</b> could not be rejected. In this study we carry out a second experiment {{to see if we}} can confirm that finding. The experimental subjects are randomly divided into two groups. One group receives an open-ended hypothetical willingness to pay question and another group participates in a second-price auction with real payments. The mean willingness to pay is SEK 133. 33 (STD 78. 78) in the hypothetical payment group and SEK 81. 62 (STD 62. 99) in the real payment group, and the hypothesis of no difference in the mean willingness to pay between the groups can be rejected on the 10 % level. In contrast to the first experiment the study thus gives some support for the notion that hypothetical willingness to pay questions overestimates real willingness to pay. ...|$|R
6000|$|Tony {{took out}} {{and played with}} a cigar. “She was pretty, and you know I was always a trifle soft. Now and then I stopped as I passed, and talked to her. I don’t think she disliked it. Well, I don’t {{remember}} exactly how it came about, but I made her a trifling wager, and, of course, I lost it; while some fiend put it into my head to send her a little brooch, with a note, instead of the forfeit agreed on—I think it was <b>a</b> <b>box</b> <b>of</b> <b>chocolate.</b> I was away {{for a week or}} two, and when I came back she told me she didn’t think she ought to take anything of that kind from me. There was nobody about the lodge—at least so I fancied—and I insisted upon putting the condemned thing on. I think I told you she was pretty.” ...|$|R
50|$|Amortentia {{is a love}} potion {{that does}} not create actual love, but gives the drinker a {{powerful}} obsession and infatuation with the giver of the potion. It is usually either forced upon someone or covertly given. As {{a rule of thumb}} the longer a love potion awaits consumption, the stronger the effects will be, as seen in Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince when Ron Weasley mistakenly eats <b>a</b> <b>box</b> <b>of</b> <b>Chocolate</b> Cauldrons spiked with the intense love potion intended for Harry previously bought from Weasley's Wizard Wheezes. The potion's aroma is unique to each person who consumes it, as it smells like whatever attracts each individual, e.g. Hermione Granger says that she smells spearmint toothpaste, freshly cut grass and a piece of fresh parchment. It can also be identified by its characteristic spirals of steam and its mother-of-pearl sheen, as noted by Hermione. Unless constantly administered, its effects eventually wear off.|$|R
