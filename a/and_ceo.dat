40|$|Abstract: This {{paper is}} {{intended}} to meet a critical need expressed by community hospital administrative and medical leaders: to provide a briefing resource to call trustees <b>and</b> <b>CEOs</b> to action in patient safety. We seek to answer key questions regarding patient safety and the emerging Pay-For-Performance movement. To illustrate the terrific opportunities for trustees <b>and</b> <b>CEOs</b> to lead, we chart the early course of the Leapfrog NQF Safe Practices Program. We sort some of the truth from the myth. We then describe how trustees <b>and</b> <b>CEOs</b> can turn the common adoption barriers of awareness, accountability, ability, and action into accelerators of patient safety in their organizations. Leadership is truly the critical ingredient to rapid safety practice adoption. As such, trustees <b>and</b> <b>CEOs</b> {{have a duty to}} serve their communities as fully engaged leaders. Key Words: patient safety, pay-for-performance, business case, trustees, innovation adoption, barrier...|$|R

Extraverted CFOs {{are more likely to}} be promoted to <b>CEO,</b> <b>and</b> extraverts tend to be first-time CFOs <b>and</b> <b>CEOs</b> at a younger age. Extraverted CEOs also serve on more outside boards and hold directorships at larger firms. Our findings suggest that boards perceive extraversion as a valuable managerial trait. However, we find no evidence that executive extraversion impacts firm performance...|$|R
