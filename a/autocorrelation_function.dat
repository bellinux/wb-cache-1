25|$|The Fourier {{transform}} is {{used for}} the spectral analysis of time-series. The subject of statistical signal processing does not, however, usually apply the Fourier transformation to the signal itself. Even if a real signal is indeed transient, it has been found in practice advisable to model a signal by a function (or, alternatively, a stochastic process) which is stationary in the sense that its characteristic properties are constant over all time. The Fourier transform of such a function does not exist in the usual sense, and it has been found more useful for the analysis of signals to instead take the Fourier transform of its <b>autocorrelation</b> <b>function.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{structural}} {{relaxation of}} a viscoelastic gel {{has been identified}} as primary mechanism responsible for densification and associated pore evolution in both colloidal and polymeric silica gels. Experiments in the viscoelastic properties of such skeletal networks on various time scales require a force varying with a period (or frequency) appropriate to the relaxation time of the phenomenon investigated, and inversely proportional to the distance over which such relaxation occurs. High frequencies associated with ultrasonic waves have been used extensively in the handling of polymer solutions, liquids and gels and the determination of their viscoelastic properties. Static measurements of the shear modulus have been made, as well as dynamic measurements of the speed of propagation of shear waves, which yields the dynamic modulus of rigidity. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) techniques have been utilized in order to monitor the dynamics of density fluctuations through the behavior of the <b>autocorrelation</b> <b>function</b> near the point of gelation.|$|E

40|$|This thesis aims at {{investigating}} {{different forms}} of residuals from a general time series model with conditional mean and conditional variance fitted by the Gaussian quasi-maximum likelihood method. We investigated the limiting distributions of autocorrelation and partial <b>autocorrelation</b> <b>functions</b> under {{different forms of}} residuals. Based on them we devised some individual portmanteau tests and two mixed portmanteau tests. We started by exploring the asymptotic normalities of the residual <b>autocorrelation</b> <b>functions,</b> the squared residual <b>autocorrelation</b> <b>functions</b> and absolute residual <b>autocorrelation</b> <b>functions</b> from the fitted time series model. This leads to three individual portmanteau tests. Then we generalized them to their counterparts of partial <b>autocorrelation</b> <b>functions,</b> and this results in another three individual portmanteau tests. We carried out simulations studies to compare the six individual portmanteau tests and find that some tests are sensitive to mis-specification in the conditional mean while other tests are effective to detect mis-specification in the conditional variance. However, for {{the case that the}} mis-specifications happen in both conditional mean and variance, none of these individual portmanteau tests present remarkable power. Based on this, we continued to investigate the joint limiting distributions of the residual <b>autocorrelation</b> <b>functions</b> and absolute residual <b>autocorrelation</b> <b>functions</b> of the fitted model since the former one is powerful to identify mis-specification in the conditional mean and the latter one works well when the conditional variance is mis-specified. This leads to two mixed portmanteau tests for diagnostic checking of the fitted model. Simulation studies are carried out to check the asymptotic theory and to assess the performance of the mixed portmanteau tests. It shows that the mixed portmanteau tests have the power to detect mis-specification in the conditional mean and conditional variance respectively while it is feasible to detect both of them. published_or_final_versionStatistics and Actuarial ScienceMasterMaster of Philosoph...|$|R

Besides a nearly periodic motion, mode-mode interactions with very irregular (also chaotic) behaviour and spreading of the wavepacket may also occur. Near a conical intersection this will be accompanied/complemented by nonradiative transitions (termed internal conversion) to other APESs occurring on the same ultrafast time scale.|$|E
