5|$|While RAD {{is likely}} to occur {{following}} neglectful and abusive childcare, {{there should be no}} automatic diagnosis on this basis alone as children can form stable attachments and social relationships despite marked abuse and neglect. Abuse can occur alongside the required factors but on its own does not explain attachment disorder. Experiences of abuse are associated with the development of disorganised attachment, in which the child prefers a familiar caregiver, but responds to that person in an unpredictable and somewhat bizarre way. Within official classifications, attachment disorganization is a risk factor but not in itself <b>an</b> <b>attachment</b> disorder. Further although attachment disorders tend to occur in the context of some institutions, repeated changes of primary caregiver or extremely neglectful identifiable primary caregivers who show persistent disregard for the child's basic attachment needs, not all children raised in these conditions develop <b>an</b> <b>attachment</b> disorder.|$|E

5|$|The gingiva ("gums") is the mucosal {{tissue that}} {{overlays}} the jaws.

40|$|Two {{cellular}} receptors for adenovirus, coxsackievirus-adenovirus receptor (CAR) {{and major}} histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) α 2, have recently been identified. In the absence of CAR, MHC-I α 2 has been suggested to serve as <b>a</b> cellular <b>attachment</b> protein for subgenus C adenoviruses, while members from all subgenera except subgenus B {{have been shown to}} interact with CAR. We have found that adenovirus type 37 (<b>Ad</b> 37) <b>attachment</b> to CAR-expressing CHO cells was no better than that to CHO cells lacking CAR expression, suggesting that CAR is not used by <b>Ad</b> 37 during <b>attachment.</b> Instead, we have identified sialic acid as a third adenovirus receptor moiety. First, <b>Ad</b> 37 <b>attachment</b> to both CAR-expresing CHO cells and MHC-I α 2 -expressing Daudi cells was sensitive to neuraminidase treatment, which eliminates sialic acid on the cell surface. Second, <b>Ad</b> 37 <b>attachment</b> to sialic acid-expressing Pro- 5 cells was more than 10 -fold stronger than that to the Pro- 5 subline Lec 2, which is deficient in sialic acid expression. Third, neuraminidase treatment of A 549 cells caused a 60 % decrease in Ad 37 replication in a fluorescent-focus assay. Moreover, the receptor sialoconjugate is most probably a glycoprotein rather than a ganglioside, since <b>Ad</b> 37 <b>attachment</b> to sialic acid-expressing Pro- 5 cells was sensitive to protease treatment. <b>Ad</b> 37 <b>attachment</b> to Pro- 5 cells occurs via α(2 → 3) -linked sialic acid saccharides rather than α(2 → 6) -linked ones, since (i) α(2 → 3) -specific but not α(2 → 6) -specific lectins blocked <b>Ad</b> 37 <b>attachment</b> to Pro- 5 cells and (ii) pretreatment of Pro- 5 cells with α(2 → 3) -specific neuraminidase resulted in decreased Ad 37 binding.

40|$|Abstract Background Systemic {{adenoviral}} (Ad) vector {{administration is}} associated with thrombocytopenia. Recently, Ad interaction with mouse platelets emerged as a key player determining liver uptake and platelet clearance. However, whether Ad can activate platelets is controversial. Thus, in vitro analysis of <b>Ad</b> <b>attachment</b> to platelets is of interest. Methods We developed a direct flow cytometry assay to specifically detect Ad particles adherent to human platelets. The method was pre-validated in nucleated cells. Blocking assays were employed to specifically inhibit <b>Ad</b> <b>attachment</b> to platelets. Platelet activation was analyzed using annexin v flow cytometry. Results We found in vitro that Ad binding to human platelets is synergistically enhanced by the combination of platelet activation by thrombin and MnCl 2 supplementation. Of note, Ad binding could activate human platelets. Platelets bound Ad displaying an RGD ligand in the fiber knob more efficiently than unmodified Ad. In contrast to a previous report, CAR expression was not detected on human platelets. Integrins appear to mediate Ad binding to platelets, at least partially. Finally, αIIbβ 3 -deficient platelets from a patient with Glanzmann thrombasthenia could bind Ad 5 -fold more efficiently than normal platelets. Conclusion The flow cytometry methodology developed herein allows the quantitative measurement of <b>Ad</b> <b>attachment</b> to platelets and may provide a useful in vitro approach to investigate Ad interaction with platelets. </p...|$|R
5|$|Attachment {{disorders}} tend {{to occur}} in a definable set of contexts such as within some types of institutions, {{in the presence of}} repeated changes of primary caregiver or of extremely neglectful identifiable primary caregivers who show persistent disregard for the child's basic attachment needs, but not all children raised in these conditions develop <b>an</b> <b>attachment</b> disorder. Studies undertaken on children from Eastern European orphanages from the mid-1990s showed significantly higher levels of both forms of RAD and of insecure patterns of attachment in the institutionalized children, regardless of how long they had been there. It would appear that children in institutions like these are unable to form selective attachments to their caregivers. The difference between the institutionalized children and the control group had lessened in the follow-up study three years later, although the institutionalized children continued to show significantly higher levels of indiscriminate friendliness. However, even among children raised in the most deprived institutional conditions the majority did not show symptoms of this disorder.|$|E
5|$|Numerous {{parasite}}s {{are known}} for this species, and both juveniles and adults often carry heavy parasite loads.

Some of these parasites use the velvet belly's prey as intermediate hosts and are acquired via ingestion, while others use the shark itself as an intermediate host. The barnacle Anelasma squalicola, an external parasite, attaches to the shark's dorsal spine socket and penetrates deeply into the muscle, in the process often providing <b>an</b> <b>attachment</b> site for a second (and rarely a third) barnacle.

Aiwa also released the CSD-GM1, a combination Genesis/Sega CD unit built into a boombox.|$|E
40|$|This study {{examined}} the relationship between adult attachment and emotional and social loneliness among participants. The possibly mediating role of friendship quality and the moderating role of sex are also examined. Loneliness is related to different clinically relevant problems, examination of the predictors of loneliness is therefore of great importance. In trains on different trajectories of the Dutch Railways (Nederlandse Spoorwegen) participants filled in questionnaires. The results show that participants with <b>an</b> insecure <b>attachment</b> style report more total loneliness in comparison to participants with <b>a</b> secure <b>attachment</b> style. Participants with <b>an</b> anxious <b>attachment</b> style report more total loneliness than participants with <b>an</b> avoidant <b>attachment</b> style. Furthermore only here {{there appears to be a}} difference between social and emotional loneliness, participants with <b>an</b> avoidant <b>attachment</b> style report higher levels of social loneliness and participants with <b>an</b> anxious <b>attachment</b> style report more emotional loneliness. Friendship quality showed to be a partial mediator of the relationship between attachment and total loneliness. Insecure attachment is related to worse friendship quality and a good friendship quality is related to less reported total loneliness. The expected moderating role of sex is not found. It can be concluded that this study contributes to understanding the relationship between attachment, friendship and loneliness. Furthermore, this study is innovative by the distinction made between social and emotional loneliness...|$|R

5|$|Aetosaurs were herbivores, likely {{feeding on}} ferns and seed ferns that were {{common in the}} Triassic. The upturned shape of their snout {{suggests}} that aetosaurs may have dug up roots and tubers. Aetosaurs have several anatomical features {{that may have been}} adaptations to digging, including a short radius relative to the humerus (seen in many other digging tetrapods) and a large deltopectoral crest on the humerus that served as <b>an</b> <b>attachment</b> for muscles. Aetosaurs also have large hind feet, or pes, with large claws that were likely used for skratch-digging. One aetosaur, Typothorax, has an entepicondyle on the humerus, which is the origin of forearm pronator and manual flexor muscles often used in digging. Moreover, it has a large olecranon process on the ulna which projects backward past the elbow, giving a large area for the insertion of the triceps muscle. While many studies have suggested that aetosaurs had a fossorial or burrowing lifestyle, aetosaurs have few of the characteristics that fossorial animals have as adaptations to digging. Therefore, it is likely that aetosaurs were able to dig to some extent, possibly rooting for food, but were unable to burrow.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there are}} {{a wide range of}} {{attachment}} difficulties within the styles which may result in emotional disturbance and increase the risk of later psychopathologies, particularly the disorganized style, none of the styles constitute a disorder in themselves and none equate to criteria for RAD as such. A disorder in the clinical sense is a condition requiring treatment, as opposed to risk factors for subsequent disorders. Reactive attachment disorder denotes a lack of typical attachment behaviors rather than <b>an</b> <b>attachment</b> style, however problematic that style may be, in that there is an unusual lack of discrimination between familiar and unfamiliar people in both forms of the disorder. Such discrimination does exist as a feature of the social behavior of children with atypical attachment styles. Both DSM-IV and ICD-10 depict the disorder in terms of socially aberrant behavior in general rather than focusing more specifically on attachment behaviors as such. DSM-IV emphasizes a failure to initiate or respond to social interactions across a range of relationships and ICD-10 similarly focuses on contradictory or ambivalent social responses that extend across social situations. The relationship between patterns of attachment in the Strange Situation and RAD is not yet clear.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} {{the second}} day, the Seimas adopted a four-{{paragraph}} resolution. The first paragraph declared that the Tsarist government was Lithuania's most dangerous enemy.

40|$|Over 50 % {{of marriages}} in the United States end in divorce. Researchers have {{attempted}} to identify factors that help marriages endure by studying personality, attachment styles, and gender. However, few researchers have examined how dyadic interactions of personality types and attachment types influence marital satisfaction. The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine the effects of enneagram personality types on marital satisfaction within 3 groups of attachment types: couples who (a) both demonstrate <b>a</b> secure <b>attachment</b> style, (b) contain one member who demonstrates <b>an</b> insecure <b>attachment</b> style and the other who demonstrates <b>a</b> secure <b>attachment</b> style, and (c) both demonstrate <b>an</b> insecure <b>attachment</b> style. Grounded in attachment theory, interpersonal theory, and the enneagram, complementary personality types should relate to greater global marital satisfaction, independent from attachment style. This cross-sectional study used the Riso-Hudson Enneagram Type Indicator, the Satisfaction With Married Life Scale, and the Revised Adult Attachment Scale to collect data from 324 married couples. A factorial ANOVA indicated that couples having one or both partners who exhibit <b>a</b> secure <b>attachment</b> style have significantly greater global marital satisfaction scores than if both partners have <b>an</b> insecure <b>attachment</b> style. Furthermore, there were no statistically significant differences in global marital satisfaction scores among couples who exhibit any enneagram personality type. Additionally, the interaction effect of enneagram personality types and attachment types were not statistically significant for global marital satisfaction.
