They were not to have sex after Tuesday night during the season.|$|E

5|$|Expansion {{sets are}} {{currently}} released in a two-set block, {{starting with a}} large set and ending with a smaller one three months later. Prior to 2016, expansion sets were released in a three-set block (again, beginning with a larger set followed by two smaller sets). These sets consist almost exclusively of newly designed cards. Contrasting with the wide-ranging Core Set, each expansion is focused around a subset of mechanics <b>and</b> <b>ties</b> into a set storyline. Expansions also dedicate several cards {{to a handful of}} particular, often newly introduced, game mechanics.|$|E

5|$|Having {{been the}} franchise's {{starting}} quarterback for 13 seasons (longer {{than any other}} Vikings player), Fran Tarkenton holds {{the record for the}} most starts in a Vikings jersey, and those for the most wins <b>and</b> <b>ties.</b> He is also the franchise's leading passer in terms of numbers of attempts, completions, total yards gained and passing touchdowns, although Brett Favre has the best pass completion percentage. However, Tarkenton has also thrown the most interceptions. The record for the longest completed pass by a Vikings starting quarterback is held by Gus Frerotte, who threw a 99-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Bernard Berrian in a home game against the Chicago Bears in the 2008 season.|$|E
5|$|In 1924–25, {{after the}} Metropolitans folded {{and the rest}} of the PCHA merged with the WCHL, Holmes joined the Victoria Cougars. In his first season with the Cougars, Holmes posted a 16–12 regular season record, with three shutouts and a 2.25goals-against average. In the WCHL playoffs, Holmes was undefeated in four games. He had two wins <b>and</b> <b>ties</b> each, with one shutout and a 1.75goals-against average. In the Stanley Cup final, Holmes posted a 3–1 record with a 2.00goals-against average against the Montreal Canadiens. It was the last time a non-NHL team won the Stanley Cup. It was Holmes' fourth and last Stanley Cup victory.|$|E
5|$|Because he was {{developed}} to be Naruto's opposite, Kishimoto remarked that Sasuke was the most memorable character for him to design. Kishimoto has remarked that Sasuke's character was also influenced by Hiei from Yoshihiro Togashi's series YuYu Hakusho, stating that he referenced Hiei when designing the character character and his Sharingan ability. He also considered Sasuke his most challenging character to create, because his design gave Kishimoto a number of problems. He lacked a proper idea of what Sasuke's face should look like, and his initial drafts of Sasuke appeared too old or mature for a character {{the same age as}} Naruto. Original designs of Sasuke had a number of necklaces <b>and</b> <b>ties</b> around his arms and legs a result of Kishimoto's habit of giving characters as much ornamentation as possible. Realizing he could not draw such a complex character on a weekly basis, Kishimoto simplified the design to be a basic contrast of Naruto's costume.|$|E

Released by his colleagues on New Year's Eve, Tracy interrogates Mumbles and {{arrives at a}} shootout outside Big Boy's club where his men are killed {{by the police and}} Tracy. Abandoning his crew, Big Boy flees to a drawbridge <b>and</b> <b>ties</b> Tess to the gears before he is confronted by Tracy. Their fight is halted when the Blank appears and holds both men at gunpoint, offering to share the city with Tracy after Big Boy is dead. Big Boy takes advantage of a distraction and opens fire before Tracy sends him falling to his death in the bridge gears. Mortally wounded, the Blank is revealed to be Breathless Mahoney, who kisses Tracy before dying. All charges against Tracy are dropped.|$|E
5|$|Colonization and {{expansion}} {{of the kingdom of}} Nri was achieved by sending mbùríchi, or converts, to other settlements. Allegiance to the eze Nri was obtained not by military force but through ritual oath. Religious authority was vested in the local king, <b>and</b> <b>ties</b> were maintained by traveling mbùríchi. By the 14th century, Nri influence extended well beyond the nuclear northern Igbo region to Igbo settlements on {{the west bank of the}} Niger and communities affected by the Benin Empire. There is strong evidence to indicate Nri influence well beyond the Igbo region to Benin and Southern Igala areas like Idah. At its height, the kingdom of Nri had influence over roughly a third of Igboland and beyond. It reached its furthest extent between 1100 and 1400.|$|E
5|$|On Day 12—October 3, 2004—Sayid finds a {{peculiar}} cable {{running out of}} the ocean and into the jungle. While following it, he is caught in a trap. Sayid is suspended upside down, held by a rope, and recites the Shahadah. A mysterious French woman (Mira Furlan) cuts him down <b>and</b> <b>ties</b> him to a bed in a bunker. She asks where Alex is, but when Sayid says he does not know, she uses batteries and a cable to shock him. Sayid tells his torturer about the plane crash and the French transmission the survivors heard when they first crashed on the island. The torturer then identifies herself as Danielle Rousseau, the woman who sent out the transmission. Danielle finds a picture of a woman among Sayid's possessions, and Sayid identifies the subject as Nadia.|$|E
40|$|Background: Laparoscopic suturing <b>and</b> <b>tying</b> {{constitute}} advanced {{minimally invasive}} surgery skills. Developing proficiency in the standard methods with needle drivers is often an arduous process. Recent advances in laparoscopic instrumentations has allowed for easier methods of suturing <b>and</b> <b>tying.</b> This study investigated {{the hypothesis that the}} use of a specialized suturing device <b>and</b> a specialized <b>tying</b> device allows inexperienced medical students to suture <b>and</b> <b>tie</b> laparoscopically. Methods: Preclinical medical students who had not received any training in open or laparoscopic surgery were included in this investigation. Each student was given a 5 -minute demonstration of a specialized suturing device <b>and</b> a specialized <b>tying</b> device. The medical students were not allowed to deploy either device before actual use. After the demonstration, each student was given the device to use in a porcine model. Times were recorded and a subjective grade was given for each student. Results: Twenty medical students were involved in this study. All medical students were able to complete the task of suturing <b>and</b> <b>tying.</b> The average time to suture was 104. 6 seconds and the average time to tying was 31. 2 seconds. The average subjective performance grade was 90 (out of 100). Conclusion: Specialized devices are easy to learn and use for laparoscopic suturing <b>and</b> <b>tying</b> with minimal instruction even for inexperienced medical students. Even surgeons who are not well versed in laparoscopic surgery should be able to suture <b>and</b> <b>tie</b> with certain laparoscopic instruments...|$|R
