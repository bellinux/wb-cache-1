40|$|Purpose – Based on {{organizational}} support theory, {{the aim of}} {{this paper}} is to examine the associations among perceived organizational support, successful <b>aging</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> workplace, job satisfaction, and the intentions to stay in organization among older workers. Design/methodology/approach – In total, 242 employees, aged over 45 years, were recruited to participate in a study from May to September 2009. Findings – Correlation showed that perceived organizational support and all five dimensions of successful <b>aging</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> workplace, (i. e. adaptability and health, positive relationship, occupational growth, personal security, and continued focus on goals), were significantly related to the intentions to stay <b>in</b> <b>the</b> organization. Structural equation modeling showed that perceived organizational support was positively related to successful <b>aging</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> workplace, and the latter is related to the intentions to stay, both directly and via the mediation of job satisfaction. Research limitations/implications – All data were self-reported and collected at one time point. Thus, common method variance may be an issue and causal inferences are not warranted. Practical implications – Successful <b>aging</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> workplace was significantly related to older workers 2 ̆ 7 intentions to stay. Managers may provide a wide range of organizational support and enhance successful <b>aging</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> workplace for older workers. Originality/value – This is the first study to empirically test the relations between successful <b>aging</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> workplace and intentions to stay among older workers.
