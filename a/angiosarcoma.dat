The patients formed two distinct groups; 14 females treated for breast cancer with radical mastectomy and radiotherapy 1949 – 1988 developed <b>angiosarcomas</b> in edematous arms (Stewart–Treves syndrome) after median 11  years, and 17 females treated by segmental resection, anti-hormonal treatment and radiotherapy 1980 – 2005 developed <b>angiosarcomas</b> in the irradiated field on the thoracic wall after median 7. 3  years. The clinical presentations were heterogeneous and included hematoma-like lesions, multiple bluish-reddish nodules, and asymptomatic lumps. The overall 5 -year survival was 16 %.

2500|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, the {{carcinogenicity}} of vinyl chloride (usually called {{vinyl chloride monomer}} or VCM) was linked to cancers in workers in the polyvinyl chloride industry. Specifically workers in polymerization section of a B.F. Goodrich plant near Louisville, Kentucky, were diagnosed with liver <b>angiosarcoma</b> also known as hemangiosarcoma, a rare disease. Since that time, studies of PVC workers in Australia, Italy, Germany, and the UK have all associated certain types of occupational cancers with exposure to vinyl chloride, {{and it has become}} accepted that VCM is a carcinogen. [...] Technology for removal of VCM from products has become stringent, commensurate with the associated regulations.|$|E
2500|$|The {{hepatotoxicity}} of {{vinyl chloride}} {{has long been}} established since the 1930s when the PVC industry was just in its infant stages. In the very first study {{about the dangers of}} vinyl chloride, published by Patty in 1930, it was disclosed that exposure of test animals to just a single short-term high dose of vinyl chloride caused liver damage. In 1949, a Russian publication discussed the finding that vinyl chloride caused liver injury among workers. In 1954, B.F. Goodrich Chemical stated that vinyl chloride caused liver injury upon short-term exposures. [...] Almost nothing was known about its long-term effects. They also recommended long-term animal toxicology studies. The study noted that if a chemical did justify the cost of testing, and its ill-effects on workers and the public were known, the chemical should not be made. In 1963, research paid for in part by Allied Chemical found liver damage in test animals from exposures below 500 parts per million (ppm). Also in 1963, a Romanian researcher published findings of liver disease in vinyl chloride workers. In 1968, Mutchler and Kramer, two Dow researchers, reported their finding that exposures as low as 300 ppm caused liver damage in vinyl chloride workers thus confirming earlier animal data in humans. In a 1969 presentation given in Japan, P. L. Viola, a European researcher working for the European vinyl chloride industry, indicated, [...] "every monomer used in V.C. manufacture is hazardous....various changes were found in bone and liver. Particularly, much more attention should be drawn to liver changes. The findings in rats at the concentration of 4 to 10 ppm are shown in pictures." [...] In light of the finding of liver damage in rats from just 4–10 ppm of vinyl chloride exposure, Viola added that he [...] "should like some precautions to be taken in the manufacturing plants polymerizing vinyl chloride, such as a reduction of the threshold limit value of monomer …" [...] In 1970, Viola, reported that test animals exposed to 30,000 ppm of vinyl chloride developed cancerous tumors. Viola began his research looking for the cause of liver and bone injuries found in vinyl chloride workers. Viola's findings in 1970 were a [...] "red flag" [...] to B.F. Goodrich and the industry. In 1972, Maltoni, another Italian researcher for the European vinyl chloride industry, found liver tumors (including <b>angiosarcoma)</b> from vinyl chloride exposures as low as 250 ppm for four hours a day.|$|E
40|$|<b>Angiosarcomas</b> {{apparently}} {{derive from}} blood vessel endothelial cells; however, occasionally their histological features suggest mixed origin from blood and lymphatic endothelia. In {{the absence of}} specific positive markers for lymphatic endothelia the precise distinction between these components has not been possible. Here we provide evidence by light and electron microscopic immunohistochemistry that podoplanin, a ∼ 38 -kd membrane glycoprotein of podocytes, is specifically expressed in the endothelium of lymphatic capillaries, {{but not in the}} blood vasculature. In normal skin and kidney, podoplanin colocalized with vascular endothelial growth factor receptor- 3, the only other lymphatic marker presently available. Complementary immunostaining of blood vessels was obtained with established endothelial markers (CD 31, CD 34, factor VIII-related antigen, and Ulex europaeus I lectin) as well as podocalyxin, another podocytic protein that is also localized in endothelia of blood vessels. Podoplanin specifically immunolabeled endothelia of benign tumorous lesions of undisputed lymphatic origin (lymphangiomas, hygromas) and was detected there as a 38 -kd protein by immunoblotting. As paradigms of malignant vascular tumors, poorly differentiated (G 3) common <b>angiosarcomas</b> (n = 8), epitheloid <b>angiosarcomas</b> (n = 3), and intestinal Kaposi’s sarcomas (n = 5) were examined for their podoplanin content in relation to conventional endothelial markers. The relative number of tumor cells expressing podoplanin was estimated and, although the number of cases in this preliminary study was limited to 16, an apparent spectrum of podoplanin expression emerged that can be divided into a low-expression group in which 0 – 10 % of tumor cells contained podoplanin, a moderate-expression group with 30 – 60 % and a high-expression group with 70 – 100 %. Ten of eleven <b>angiosarcomas</b> and all Kaposi’s sarcomas showed mixed expression of both lymphatic and blood vascular endothelial phenotypes. By double labeling, most podoplanin-positive tumor cells coexpressed endothelial markers of blood vessels, whereas few tumor cells were positive for individual markers only. From these results we conclude that (1) podoplanin is a selective marker of lymphatic endothelium; (2) G 3 <b>angiosarcomas</b> display a quantitative spectrum of podoplanin-expressing tumor cells; (3) in most <b>angiosarcomas,</b> a varying subset of tumor cells coexpresses podoplanin and endothelial markers of blood vessels; and (4) all endothelial cells of Kaposi’s sarcomas expressed the lymphatic marker podoplanin...|$|R

Recurrent genetic alterations were identified only in secondary {{but not in}} primary AS. The most frequent recurrent alterations were high level amplifications on chromosome 8 q 24. 21 (50 %), followed by 10 p 12. 33 (33 %) and 5 q 35. 3 (11 %). Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis in 28 primary and 33 secondary <b>angiosarcomas</b> (31 tumors secondary to irradiation, 2 tumors secondary to chronic lymphedema) confirmed high level amplification of MYC on chromosome 8 q 24. 21 as a recurrent genetic alteration found exclusively in 55 % of AS secondary to irradiation or chronic lymphedema, but not in primary AS. Amplification of MYC did not predispose to high grade morphology or increased cell turnover. In conclusion, despite their identical morphology, secondary AS are genetically different from primary AS and are characterized by a high frequency of high level amplifications of MYC.

40|$|Ring-necked {{pheasant}} virus, an {{avian leukosis}} virus, when injected into 10 -day old chick embryos, caused <b>angiosarcomas</b> {{in the lungs}} of infected chickens within a short time. <b>Angiosarcomas</b> appeared as localized foci of proliferating cells in the lungs as early as 2 weeks posthatch, and by 6 weeks, the lungs of the infected chickens were frequently filled with tumor cells.

Chickens with lung tumors were cyanotic, had breathing difficulty, and had packed cell volumes in excess of 50 %. Other changes not necessarily correlated with lung tumor mass were stunting, lymphoid organ involution, and profuse diarrhea. Ring-necked pheasant virus has a genome RNA of 8. 2 kb. This observation, together with its replication and disease induction after repeated plaque purification, suggests that ring-necked pheasant virus is a replication-competent avian retrovirus.
