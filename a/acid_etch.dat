These composite resins were appealing, in that they were capable of having an extremely smooth surface when finished. These microfilled composite resins also showed a better clinical colour stability and higher resistance to wear than conventional composites, which favoured their aesthetic appearance as well as clinical effectiveness. However, further research showed a progressive weakness in the material over time, leading to micro-cracks and step-like material loss around the composite margin. In 1981, microfilled composites were improved remarkably with regard to marginal retention and adaptation.

40|$|This study {{compares the}} {{morphology}} and the irreversible enamel abrasion {{of the conventional}} acid-etch technique with the combination of sandblasting and the acid-etch technique. In addition the resulting tensile bond strength was investigated. For {{the first part of}} this study 50 extracted human molar teeth were randomly divided into the following 5 groups: (1) 30 sec <b>acid</b> <b>etched</b> with 37 % phosphoric acid, (2) 5 sec sandblasted with 110 µm aluminium oxide + <b>acid</b> <b>etched,</b> (3) 10 sec sandblasted + <b>acid</b> <b>etched,</b> (4) 5 sec sandblasted + <b>acid</b> <b>etched</b> + bracket + debonding, (5) 10 sec sandblasted + <b>acid</b> <b>etched</b> + bracket + debonding. After the preparation of slices the correspondent enamel loss was measured microscopically using the computer programm “Discus”: (1) 7, 10 µm ± 1, 25 µm, (2) 43, 22 µm ± 17, 66 µm, (3) 96, 32 µm ± 36, 57 µm, (4) 121, 17 µm ± 14, 94 µm, (5) 184, 31 µm ± 36, 17 µm. The sandblasting followed by acid etching groups had significantly higher enamel abrasion values when compared to the acid etching group. Only between group 3 and 4 no significantly higher enamel loss could be determine. In the second part of this study a Zwick testing machine was used to determine tensile bond strengths between the enamel and the fixed brackets after a 24 h immersion in water at a crosshead speed of 1 mm/sec. The 2 groups were as follows: (A) 30 sec <b>acid</b> <b>etched,</b> (B) 5 sec sandblasted + <b>acid</b> <b>etched.</b> The results showed that the bond strength of group A was 3, 9 MPa ± 1, 12 MPa and the group that was sandblasted followed by <b>acid</b> <b>etched</b> was 4, 49 MPa ± 1, 26 MPa. The statistical analysis documented that the pre-treatment with aluminium oxide does not effect significantly higher tensile bond strength. The occurrence of bond failures in the 2 groups primarily at the bracket-adhesive interface was responsible for that result whereby the exact registration of the maximum tensile bond strength between the enamel and the adhesive was not possible with this experimental setup. Considering the enamel abrasion caused by 5 sec sandblasting of 43 µm rather 121 µm after bracketdebonding, the sandblasting technique does not cause an improved clinical result due to the established bond failures at the bracket base. The sandblasting for 10 sec is just due to the very high irreversible enamel abrasion about 180 µm to estimate as censorious...|$|R

50|$|Parts {{cleaning}} {{is essential}} to many industrial processes, {{as a prelude to}} surface finishing or to protect sensitive components. Electroplating is particularly sensitive to part cleanliness, since molecular layers of oil can prevent adhesion of the coating. ASTM B322 is a standard guide for cleaning metals prior to electroplating. Cleaning processes include solvent cleaning, hot alkaline detergent cleaning, electrocleaning, and <b>acid</b> <b>etch.</b> The most common industrial test for cleanliness is the waterbreak test, in which the surface is thoroughly rinsed and held vertical. Hydrophobic contaminants such as oils cause the water to bead and break up, allowing the water to drain rapidly. Perfectly clean metal surfaces are hydrophilic and will retain an unbroken sheet of water that does not bead up or drain off. ASTM F22 describes a version of this test. This test does not detect hydrophilic contaminants, but the electroplating process can displace these easily since the solutions are water-based. Surfactants such as soap reduce the sensitivity of the test, so these must be thoroughly rinsed off.|$|E

Occlusal surfaces of extracted human molars were either <b>acid</b> <b>etched</b> (n = 30), or successively lased and <b>acid</b> <b>etched</b> (n = 30). Ten teeth from each group were either air-dried, water-contaminated, or saliva-contaminated prior to sealing with UltraSeal XT® hydro™.

Significant differences in microleakage were evaluated using the Mann–Whitney U test with Bonferroni adjustment (p = 0. 05). Laser pre-conditioning significantly reduced dye penetration irrespective of whether the enamel surface was moist or dry. Microleakageof water-contaminated <b>acid</b> <b>etched</b> teeth was significantly greater than that of their air-dried or saliva-contaminated counterparts. SEM analysis demonstrated good adaptation in all groups with the exception of water-contaminated <b>acid</b> <b>etched</b> teeth which exhibited relatively wide gaps.

5000|$|The most {{desirable}} finish surface for a composite resin {{can be provided}} by aluminum oxide disks. Classically, Class III composite preparations were required to have retention points placed entirely in dentin. A syringe was used for placing composite resin because the possibility of trapping air in a restoration was minimized. Modern techniques vary, but conventional wisdom states that {{because there have been}} great increases in bonding strength due to the use of dentin primers in the late 1990s, physical retention is not needed except for the most extreme of cases. Primers allow the dentin's collagen fibers to be [...] "sandwiched" [...] into the resin, resulting in a superior physical and chemical bond of the filling to the tooth. Indeed, composite usage was highly controversial in the dental field until primer technology was standardized in the mid to late 1990s. The enamel margin of a composite resin preparation should be beveled in order to improve aesthetics and expose the ends of the enamel rods for acid attack. The correct technique of enamel etching prior to placement of a composite resin restoration includes etching with 30%-50% phosphoric acid and rinsing thoroughly with water and drying with air only. In preparing a cavity for restoration with composite resin combined with an <b>acid</b> <b>etch</b> technique, all enamel cavosurface angles should be obtuse angles. Contraindications for composite include varnish and zinc oxide-eugenol. Composite resins for Class II restorations were not indicated because of excessive occlusal wear in the 1980s and early 1990s. Modern bonding techniques and the increasing unpopularity of amalgam filling material have made composites more attractive for Class II restorations. Opinions vary, but composite is regarded as having adequate longevity and wear characteristics to be used for permanent Class II restorations. Whether composite materials last as long or has the leakage and sensitivity properties when compared to Class II amalgam restorations was described as a matter of debate in 2008.|$|E
40|$|Background: A {{prolonged}} life of fissure sealant {{has always}} been the target for preventing caries in vulnerable newly erupted teeth. The use of preparatory techniques including bur introduction to the fissures is considered among such improving steps. The aim of this investigation was to compare the microleakage level of fissure sealants prepared by a fissurotomy bur or pumice prophylaxis prior to acid etching. Materials and Methods: Ninety freshly extracted healthy maxillary premolar teeth were randomly selected for this investigation. Teeth were then divided into three fissure sealant preparatory groups of A: Fissurotomy bur + acid etch; B: Pumice prophylaxis + <b>acid</b> <b>etch</b> and C: <b>Acid</b> <b>etch</b> alone. Sealant was applied to the occlusal fissures of all specimens using a plastic instrument. This was to avoid any air trap under the sealant. Sample teeth were first thermocycled (1000 cycles, 20 s dwell time) and then coated with two layers of nail varnish leaving 2 mm around the sealant. This was then followed by immersion in basic fuchsin 3 %. Processed teeth were sectioned longitudinally and examined under a stereomicroscope for microleakage assessment using a score of 0 - 3. Collected data was then subjected to Kruskall-Wallis Analysis of Variance and Mann-Whitney U-test. P < 0. 05 was considered as significant. Results: Teeth in fissurotomy bur and pumice prophylaxis groups had significantly reduced level of microleakage than those in <b>acid</b> <b>etch</b> alone (P = 0. 005 and P = 0. 003, respectively). Conclusion: Use of fissurotomy bur and pumice prophylaxis accompanied with acid etching appears to have a more successful reduction of microleakage than <b>acid</b> <b>etch</b> alone...|$|E

40|$|Anodization of {{titanium}} and its alloys, under controlled conditions, {{generates a}} nanotubular architecture {{on the material}} surface.

Upon comparing these results with those obtained on <b>acid</b> <b>etched</b> and polished surfaces of the same alloy, we observed a signiﬁcant increase in adhesion and proliferation of cells on anodized surfaces as compared to <b>acid</b> <b>etched</b> or polished surface.

Results UltraSeal XT® hydro&# 8482; is an acrylate-based sealant that achieved a degree of conversion of 50. 6 ± 2. 2 % and a Vickers microhardness of 24. 2 ± 1. 5 under standard light curing (1, 000 mWcm- 2 for 20 s). Fluoride ion release is negligible within a 14 -day period. SEM and EDX analyses indicated that the sealant comprises irregular submicron and nano-sized silicon-, barium-, and aluminium-bearing filler phases embedded in a ductile matrix. Laser preconditioning was found to significantly reduce microleakage (Mann-Whitney U test, p< 0. 001). The lased teeth presented enhanced surface roughness on a 50 to 100 &# 956;m scale that caused the segregation and concentration of the filler particles at the enamel-sealant interface.

40|$|Abstract: This review {{describes}} {{the relationship between}} dentin collagen hybrid bond layer degradation and the Matrix Metalloproteinases (MMPs) after their release by <b>acid</b> <b>etch</b> and rinse adhesives and self etching bonding adhesives that can reduce the bond stability over time. MMP- 2, MMP- 8 and MMP- 9 are indicated as the active proteases that breakdown the collagen fibrils in the hybrid bond layer. Phosphoric acid in the <b>acid</b> <b>etch</b> and rinse bonding process and acid primers in the self etch process are implicated in the release of these proteases and their activation by several non-collagen proteins also released from dentin by the etching. MMPs are released in saliva by salivary glands, by cells in the gingival crevices to crevicular fluid and by pulpal odontoblasts cells to the dentinal fluids. These sources may affect the hybrid layer also. Evidence of the bond strength deterioration over time {{and the ability of}} Chlorhexidine to prevent bond deterioration by inhibiting MMP action are discussed. Dentin Bonding procedure utilizing Chlorhexidine for different application times and concentrations are being developed. The application of 2 % Chlorhexidine to the phosphoric <b>acid</b> <b>etch</b> surface after rinsing off the acid is the only procedure that has been clinically tested {{for a longer period of}} time and shown to prevent bond strength degradation so far.

30|$|Although bonding {{to tooth}} tissues {{has long been}} of {{particular}} interest in dentistry, {{the introduction of the}} <b>acid</b> <b>etch</b> method by Buonocore was revolutionary [1]. This technique enabled through the inherent enamel’s anatomy the utilization of adhesive penetration in terms of resin tags [2] in order to increase retention of the bonded material to the tooth. Therefore, the <b>acid</b> <b>etch</b> technique has found numerous applications in almost all aspects of contemporary dentistry, including operative dentistry [3], prosthodontics [4], pediatric dentistry [5], and orthodontics [6]. Although this technique has been widely adopted in all these dental fields, it is not free of complications and adverse consequences. Acid conditioning of dental enamel causes superficial tissue loss that ranges between 20 and 50  μm [7], while a possible removal of the bonded material or the bonded attachment (de-bonding) is associated with additional loss of dental tissue [7], enamel tear-outs [8], or enamel cracks [8].|$|E

Results showed that Sn 3 F 3 PO 4 forms more rapidly on etched surfaces as compared with nonetched controls. The ob-served accelerated rate was attributed to in-creased reaction surface provided by prior <b>acid</b> <b>etch</b> plus a rougher surface conducive to crystal nidus formation. Sn 3 F 3 PO 4 has been demonstrated as the ma-jor product formed subsequent to prolonged interaction of SnF 2 solution and dental min-eral. 1 - 6 However, little is known of the fac-tors that may inhibit or accelerate Sn 3 F 3 PO 4 formation.
