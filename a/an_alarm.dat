5|$|At 6:35pm, as {{many workers}} in the city were {{finishing}} their shifts, the alarm was sounded to gather the troops of the 5th and 6th Regiments. This {{was the first time}} such <b>an</b> <b>alarm</b> had been used in the city, and it caused a great deal of excitement, and attracted yet more citizens into the streets to witness events.|$|E

5|$|In {{terms of}} spill prevention, the {{pipeline}} was designed with one-way valves (so oil moving ahead could not leak {{out of a}} hole behind a certain point), computer-aided leak detection, and other features. The pipeline {{was designed to be}} pressurized, so any leak would be instantly detected by a loss of pressure at one of the pump stations, which could sound <b>an</b> <b>alarm</b> and halt the flow of oil quickly.|$|E
5|$|The {{replacement}} 'T' on {{the north}} face of Tech Tower was stolen on May 28, 2001 by three students, two of whom were found guilty of numerous conduct code violations by the Undergraduate Judiciary Cabinet and subsequently suspended. The students had successfully removed the 'T' from its mount but {{were caught in the}} act by authorities when the removal triggered <b>an</b> <b>alarm.</b> In October 2005, a replica of the 'T' was stolen from the Student Services Building and returned two days later.|$|E
5|$|The tower cab {{coordinator}} on duty at {{the time}} of the accident stated that he saw a fireball emanating from the crash site following the accident. Upon seeing the flames, he sounded <b>an</b> <b>alarm,</b> alerting the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey Police, who responded. An investigation revealed that there were technical issues with an emergency telephone at LaGuardia, however it was found that these issues did not hinder the emergency response.|$|E

5|$|Tornado {{warnings}} were {{in effect}} {{at the time}} and issued on average about 30 minutes before the tornado hit, but few people were alerted as many were asleep as the tornado hit in the overnight hours. The local NOAA Weather Radio transmitter was experiencing technical difficulties at the time, causing some weather radios to not sound <b>an</b> <b>alarm.</b> Damages were estimated at around $85 million.|$|E
5|$|Vocal {{communication}} among variegated fairywrens is used primarily for communication between birds {{in a social}} group and for advertising and defending a territory. The basic song type is a high-pitched reel {{of a large number}} of short elements (10–20 per second); this lasts 1–4 seconds. The reel of the variegated fairywren is the softest of all malurids. Birds maintain contact with each other by tsst or seeee calls, while a short, sharp tsit serves as <b>an</b> <b>alarm</b> call.|$|E
5|$|Calculations {{show that}} the tank would have begun to {{overflow}} at about 05:20. There is evidence suggesting that a high-level switch, which should have detected that the tank was full and shut off the supply, failed to operate. The switch failure should have triggered <b>an</b> <b>alarm,</b> but it too appears to have failed. Forty-one minutes later, an estimated 300tonnes of petrol would have spilled {{down the side of}} the tank through the roof vents onto the ground inside a bund walla semi-enclosed compound surrounding several tanks.|$|E

5|$|Lowe speculated in his 1927 paper that, in {{the absence}} of {{mammalian}} predators on the island, the brown skua would be the Inaccessible Island rail's only predator. A study of the diet of brown skuas on Inaccessible Island confirmed this, but found that although skuas do eat adults of this species, the rail and other landbirds formed {{only a small part of}} the diet of that seabird, especially compared to their abundance on the island. They noted that the landbirds alarm-called when brown skuas were seen. After hearing another rail make <b>an</b> <b>alarm</b> call, adult Inaccessible Island rails become alert, while chicks fall silent. Adults are rarely preyed upon, but the mortality of chicks is high and predation by Tristan thrushes is a major cause.|$|E
5|$|Many rodent species, {{particularly}} those that are diurnal and social, have {{a wide range of}} alarm calls that are emitted when they perceive threats. There are both direct and indirect benefits of doing this. A potential predator may stop when it knows it has been detected, or <b>an</b> <b>alarm</b> call can allow conspecifics or related individuals to take evasive action. Several species, for example prairie dogs, have complex anti-predator alarm call systems. These species may have different calls for different predators (e.g. aerial predators or ground-based predators) and each call contains information {{about the nature of the}} precise threat. The urgency of the threat is also conveyed by the acoustic properties of the call.|$|E
5|$|One night {{towards the}} end of 1942, Gröning and his comrades in their SS barracks on the {{outskirts}} of Birkenau were awakened by <b>an</b> <b>alarm.</b> They were told that a number of Jews who were being taken to the gas chambers had escaped and hidden in the woods. They were ordered to take pistols and search the woods. When his group arrived at the extermination area of the camp they saw a farmhouse, in front of which were SS men and the bodies of seven or eight prisoners who had been caught and shot. The SS men told Gröning and his comrades that they could go home but they decided to hang around {{in the shadows of the}} woods.|$|E

5|$|The bombing had {{destroyed}} the north {{wing of the}} school. During the search, rescuers found an additional 500pounds (230kg) of dynamite which had failed to detonate in the south wing. The search was halted to allow the Michigan State Police to disarm the devices, and they found <b>an</b> <b>alarm</b> clock timed to go off at 8:45a.m. Investigators speculated that the initial explosion may have caused a short circuit in {{the second set of}} bombs, preventing them from detonating. They searched the building and then returned to the recovery work.|$|E
5|$|The {{fire station}} {{contained}} flats for 32 firemen {{and their families}} and 6 single firemen. Facilities included a laundry, gym, billiards room and children's play-areas. The complex contained stables for the horses that pulled the fire appliances, and a blacksmith's workshop. There were electric bells and lights to alert firemen to <b>an</b> <b>alarm,</b> poles to expedite the firemen's response, suspended harnesses to allow the horses to be harnessed quickly, and electric doors. The fire station was also designed with foresight; the appliance bays were made wide enough to take motorised fire appliances. The station's first motorised fire appliance arrived in 1911, five years after it opened.|$|E

To fund the mission, 100,000 pounds sterling in gold was deposited in an account at the Deutsche Bank in Constantinople. The expedition was also provided with gold and other gifts for the Emir, including jewelled watches, gold fountain pens, ornamental rifles, binoculars, cameras, cinema projectors, and <b>an</b> <b>alarm</b> clock.|$|E
5|$|This species' call is a distinctive, plaintive cooOOoo-woo-woo-woooo, {{uttered by}} males to attract females, {{and may be}} mistaken for the call of an owl at first. (Close up, a grating or throat-rattling sound may be heard {{preceding}} the first coo.) Other sounds include a nest call (cooOOoo) by paired males to attract their mates to the nest sites, a greeting call (a soft ork) by males upon rejoining their mates, and <b>an</b> <b>alarm</b> call (a short roo-oo) by either male or female when threatened. In flight, the wings make a fluttery whistling sound {{that is hard to}} hear. The wing whistle is much louder and more noticeable upon take-off and landing.|$|E
5|$|Back in Azerbaijan, Bond {{discloses}} to M that Elektra {{may not be}} {{as innocent}} as she seems. <b>An</b> <b>alarm</b> sounds while he is handing M the locator card as proof of the theft, which reveals that the stolen bomb from Kazakhstan is attached to an inspection rig heading towards the oil terminal. Bond and Jones enter the pipeline to deactivate the bomb, and Jones discovers that half of the plutonium is missing. They both jump clear of the rig, a large section of pipeline is destroyed, and they are presumed killed. Back at the command centre, Elektra reveals she and Renard are conspirators and that she killed her father as revenge for using her as bait for Renard. She abducts M, whom she resents for advising her father not to pay the ransom money, and imprisons her in the Maiden's Tower.|$|E
