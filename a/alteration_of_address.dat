40|$|The cult of relics {{connects the}} many stories of {{transfers}} and dismemberment of holy bodies, that characterize {{many of the}} Medieval and Late Medieval hagiographic and religious literature. It {{is an integral part}} of the “myth of origins” of many foundations, not only those of single religious buildings, but also of entire civilian settlements, which could be either urban areas, or monasteries and castles. The desire, the need and the practice of finding and procuring relics of the holy bodies triggered the phenomena <b>of</b> <b>alteration</b> <b>of</b> worship, <b>addressed</b> to the sacred and saving remains, such as trade, falsification, misuse, theft and even robbery of relics. The hagiographic tradition, that records the saints and martyrs of the first centuries of Christianity and the Late Middle Ages, includes the region of Lucania, where it is possible to trace the evolution of various cults and to identify the role of promoters of Christianity. This area is also linked to a later tradition concerning the story of the martyr Laverio, who lived in the age of Constantine. He was martyred in Grumentum and buried there, in a church which he built and dedicated on the site of the martyrdom. In the events described of his life, we trace the story of a cult that was rather widespread in the region, as can be recognized in the place-names and in religious traditions, shared by Grumentum, Acerenza, Potenza, Tricarico, Venosa, Tito, Viggiano, Missanello, Ripacandida and also the Medieval Satrianum, where some of the relics of the Saint have been transferred. The present paper aims to describe the relation between the hagiographic story of this transfer of relics and the physiognomy of the fortified site of the Medieval Satrianum, discovered by a recent archaeological research...|$|R

An important factor in applying these strategies is a computer model for roadway noise, that is capable <b>of</b> <b>addressing</b> local topography, meteorology, traffic operations, and hypothetical mitigation. Costs of building-in mitigation can be modest, provided these solutions are sought in the planning stage of a roadway project.|$|R

However, {{it is not}} clear effect of oxidative stress on pharmacokinetics. Organic anion transporting polypeptides (human: OATPs, rodent: Oatps) are important for uptake of endogenous and exogenous compounds into hepatocytes. Thus, <b>alteration</b> <b>of</b> OATPs/Oatps expression level may affect pharmacokinetics of various drugs. In this study, we investigated the <b>alteration</b> <b>of</b> OATPs/Oatps expression levels and function by oxidative stress, and the effect <b>of</b> <b>alteration</b> <b>of</b> those on pharmacokinetics of a typical OATPs/Oatps substrate pravastatin. OATPs/Oatps expression levels and function were altered by H 2 O 2 -induced oxidative stress in in vitro experiments. The <b>alteration</b> <b>of</b> Oatps expression by oxidative stress also occurred in in vivo experiments. Oatp 1 a 1, Oatp 1 a 4 and Oatp 1 b 2 expression in the liver were decreased in rats fed powdery diet containing 2 % inosine, which induces oxidative stress through activation of xanthine oxidase, for 1 day. The decrease in Oatps expression levels by oxidative stress caused the suppression of pravastatin uptake to the liver, and resulted in high plasma concentration of pravastatin and low biliary excretion. In conclusion, oxidative stress induces <b>alteration</b> <b>of</b> OATPs/Oatps expression and function in hepatocytes, resulting in <b>alteration</b> <b>of</b> pharmacokinetics of their substrates.

40|$|The {{guidelines}} <b>of</b> the <b>alteration</b> <b>of</b> evil, a {{theorical study}} {{based on the}} rule of Islamic Jurisprudence, "there is no harm nor inflicting harmful". This is a Thesis submitted for the Master Programme of Islamic Thought and Islamic Jurisprudence Department, at the University of Muhammadiyah Surakarta. Prepared by: Tamim Aziz, supervised by Dr. Muhammad Muinudinillah Basri. and Dr. Mochammad Ichsan. In 2012 AD - 1433 H. The notion of this qualitative and librarical research is basically urged by the realitiy of da'wah {{which has been in}} need of certain guidelines dealing with the <b>alteration</b> <b>of</b> evil under the rule of Islamic Juris prudence, "there is no harm nor inflicting harmful. " Among the reasons of the critical need of this study is the emergence of the undesirable phenomenon in the arena of da'wah, that is hasty enthusiasm in the way <b>of</b> the <b>alteration</b> <b>of</b> evil; neglecting the negative results of the actions and and losses. The study then raises two important questions as follows: (1) What does the rule "there is no harm nor inflicting harmful" mean? And What does the guidelines <b>of</b> the <b>alteration</b> <b>of</b> evil mean as well as their relationship between each other? (2) What kinds of guidelines could be derived from the rule "there is no harm nor inflicting harmful" for the purpose <b>of</b> the <b>alteration</b> <b>of</b> evil? After intensive studies in each of the two fields of the Islamic jurisprudences, pertaining to the rule "there is no harm nor inflicting harmful", and making the comparison between the two subjects as well as looking at their relationships between each other, finally the study came up with a set of the rules related to the <b>alteration</b> <b>of</b> the evil. These rules are: firstly - the general rule in the <b>alteration</b> <b>of</b> evil, which is keeping and making the interests come true, and refuting and neglecting the harms. Secondly – the rules that are derived from the rule of keeping and making the interests come true and refuting and neglecting the harms lead to some important results: (1) the correct perception of the concept of evil, and the Islamic jurisprudence related to the <b>alteration</b> <b>of</b> evil. (2) identification and verification before proceeding the <b>alteration</b> <b>of</b> evil. (3) starting from the worst of the evil. (4) calling to goodness and preventing from badness before denying and <b>alteration</b> <b>of</b> evil (5) choosing lesser of two evils. (6) the <b>alteration</b> <b>of</b> evil should not entail greater evil. These rules presumably could light up the path of da'i in the field of da'wah and direct their genuine concern on the <b>alteration</b> <b>of</b> evil toward the correct way for the sake of refuting the harm and keeping the interest. ...|$|R
