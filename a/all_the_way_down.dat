5|$|Males having short, cut hair {{are in many}} {{cultures}} viewed as being under society's control, such as while in the military or prison or as punishment for a crime. Although recently in The United States {{it has become more}} socially acceptable and more common for men to have hair reaching <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> to their upper back. Long, thick hair has been a sign of wealth, power or prominence throughout time and history.|$|E
5|$|The Premier League sells its {{television}} {{rights on}} a collective basis. This {{is in contrast}} to some other European Leagues, including La Liga, in which each club sells its rights individually, leading to a much higher share of the total income going to the top few clubs. The money is divided into three parts: half is divided equally between the clubs; one quarter is awarded on a merit basis based on final league position, the top club getting twenty times as much as the bottom club, and equal steps <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> the table; the final quarter is paid out as facilities fees for games that are shown on television, with the top clubs generally receiving the largest shares of this. The income from overseas rights is divided equally between the twenty clubs.|$|E

25|$|The {{formulae}} {{from the}} previous section are only applicable if the laws of gravity are approximately valid <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> to the Planck scale. In particular, for black holes with masses below the Planck mass (~), they result in impossible lifetimes below the Planck time (~). This is normally seen as {{an indication that the}} Planck mass is the lower limit on the mass of a black hole.|$|E
25|$|In Vienna, Boltzmann taught {{physics and}} also lectured on {{philosophy}}. Boltzmann's lectures on natural philosophy were very popular and received considerable attention. His first lecture {{was an enormous}} success. Even though the largest lecture hall had been chosen for it, the people stood <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> the staircase. Because of the great successes of Boltzmann's philosophical lectures, the Emperor invited him for a reception at the Palace.|$|E

He was called up to the Dodgers in September, but did not get into any games that year. For the 1957 season, Spooner was demoted <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> back <b>down</b> to A-ball: in 13 games (9 starts) he was 2-4.|$|R
50|$|The LCD {{moves into}} {{a variety of}} angles; it tilts {{horizontally}} and vertically and also rotates to a certain extent while staying aligned with the lens axis. It still can not be turned <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> up, <b>down</b> or to the side to be seen {{from the front of the}} camera for self-portraits. This type of articulating screen is called cross-tilt screen, flexible-tilt screen or flex-tilt screen.|$|R
25|$|Perceived {{failure or}} {{insufficient}} {{devotion to the}} Emperor would attract punishment, frequently of the physical kind. In the military, officers would assault and beat men under their command, who would pass the beating on to lower ranks, <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>down.</b> In POW camps, this meant prisoners received the worst beatings of all, partly {{in the belief that}} such punishments were merely the proper technique to deal with disobedience.|$|E
25|$|Roman Ghirshman {{took over}} {{direction}} of the French efforts in 1946, {{after the end of}} the war. Together with his wife Tania Ghirshman, he continued there until 1967. The Ghirshmans concentrated on excavating a single part of the site, the hectare sized Ville Royale, taking it <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> to bare earth. The pottery found at the various levels enabled a stratigraphy to be developed for Susa.|$|E

It started as a politically oriented talk show, a longer version of Springer's commentaries. Guests included Oliver North and Jesse Jackson, and topics included homelessness and gun politics.|$|E
25|$|On the South Col, climbers {{enter the}} death zone. Climbers making summit bids {{typically}} can endure {{no more than}} two or three days at this altitude. That's one reason why clear weather and low winds are critical factors in deciding whether to make a summit attempt. If weather does not cooperate within these short few days, climbers are forced to descend, many <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> back <b>down</b> to Base Camp.|$|R

25|$|Almost all {{production}} in Alsace is of AOC wine, {{since there is}} no Vin de pays region which covers Alsace. Thus, the only alternative to producing AOC wine is to declassify it <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> to Vin de table, which generally means that neither grape varieties, region of origin or vintage may be identified. However, this solution is mostly avoided since edelzwicker and gentil may be blended from several varieties, i.e. varieties that exceed the AOC rules in the concerned season.|$|E
25|$|Summits and views: The {{highest point}} on Watermillock Common is Swineside Knott (1,814 feet/553m), a rounded grassy mound {{but with some}} rocks protruding, {{especially}} on its steep eastern side.

25|$|The Body: Neapolitan jackets {{tend to be}} shorter in the back; in Neapolitan dialect, {{they say}} the jacket “zompa arrèto,” which roughly {{translates}} as “it jumps in the back”. This characteristic allows for the jacket to “slide” gracefully along the body. The vents on the sides are quite deep in Neapolitan jackets – up to 12 inches. The darts in the front go <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>down,</b> to help the fabric follow {{the shape of the}} body and create elegant quarters.|$|E
50|$|As {{with most}} major winter storms in the American South, a {{low-pressure}} system formed near the western Gulf of Mexico, in this case, over Mexico on January 27, and eventually moved eastward. The {{breakdown of the}} normal polar vortex around the North Pole allowed an outbreak of frigid Arctic air to penetrate well into the South. The cold wave traveled much further south than normal, such that when the precipitation arrived from the Gulf Coast winter storm, freezing temperatures were occurring <b>all</b> of <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> to <b>the</b> coast.|$|R

25|$|The {{university}} can {{be considered}} {{the birthplace of the}} computer, with mathematician Charles Babbage having designed the world's first computing system as early as the mid-1800s. Alan Turing went on to devise what is essentially the basis for modern computing and Maurice Wilkes later created the first programmable computer. The webcam was also invented at Cambridge University, as a means for scientists to avoid interrupting their research and going <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> to the laboratory dining room only to be disappointed by an empty coffee pot.|$|E
25|$|Tourism is {{a growing}} {{industry}} in Pakistan. With more and more foreign investment and funding, Pakistan was able to build its major road and air networks to cater mass movements of cargo and inter-city travel. Roads are being developed by several consultants from the Northern Areas <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> to the Port of Karachi. However, till this date, {{the government has not}} be able to take the tourism market seriously in Pakistan. The country is home to diverse tourist attractions which have not been funded or protected due to the government giving the tourism market a low priority.|$|E
25|$|The {{fate of the}} {{immediate}} environment of the church has been a subject of dispute between city planners since 1813. Scotsman William Hastie proposed clearing the space around {{all sides of the}} church and <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> to the Moskva River: the official commission led by Fyodor Rostopchin and Mikhail Tsitsianov agreed to clear only the space between the church and Lobnoye Mesto. Hastie's plan could have radically transformed the city, but he lost to the opposition, whose plans were finally endorsed by Alexander I in December 1817 (specific decision on clearing the rubble around the church was issued in 1816).|$|E

50|$|There {{is a major}} {{cosmetic}} flaw {{with the}} third generation Explorer and second generation Mountaineer.

I wasn't very prepared so I just went in, to see what happened. Two weeks later I had a phone call saying I had the job. Crazy." [...] Smith received the call while he was in hospital, following a workplace accident which left his nose swollen and infected. This led to Smith almost turning down the role. Smith's first scenes as Andrew were broadcast in December 2009. His role was initially supposed to last for six weeks. In 2011, it was announced that Smith had signed a new contract to stay with Neighbours for another two years.|$|R
25|$|For the hajj, {{the annual}} pilgrimage to Mecca, Muslim men wear the ihram, a simple, {{seamless}} garment made of white, terry clothlike cotton. One piece is wound skirt-like around {{the lower half}} of the body; the other is thrown loosely over one shoulder. The Qahtani sheep herders in the Southern Asir provence wear ankle-length skirt-like kilts. In Yemen standard dress is a calf-length, wraparound skirt, the futah. The Palestinians of the Eastern Mediterranean traditionally wear the qumbaz, an ankle-length unisex garment, which opens <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> the front with the right side brought over the left, under the arm, and then fastened.|$|E
25|$|The first European {{settlers}} {{arrived in}} what became Lycoming County after the Province of Pennsylvania purchased {{the land from}} the Iroquois in the 1768 Treaty of Fort Stanwix. Small scale sawmills along tributaries of the West Branch Susquehanna River were built prior to the American Revolution, and provided enough lumber to build the houses and barns of Williamsport and the surrounding area. Even more timber was made into rafts and floated <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> the Susquehanna River, into Chesapeake Bay and on to Baltimore, where the massive and straight timbers were turned into masts for the famous Baltimore Clippers and other sailing vessels of the 18th century.|$|E

5000|$|Some of the {{diagonal}} roads were never completed.

The original east-west roads are numbered starting with 1 at the state line (now called Russell Road), although there are now new east-west roads which bear names. The city used to extend <b>all</b> of <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> to <b>the</b> lakefront until the state bought it to preserve the beach. Because most of the houses on the lakefront were owned by wealthy citizens, most of them were moved to places around what is now Sheridan Road.|$|R
25|$|On Stage 15 Schleck was race {{leader and}} {{pressing}} the pace over the day's final climb of Port de Bales when {{he threw his}} chain.
