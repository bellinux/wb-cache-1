5|$|On the {{macroeconomic}} scale, Lars-Hendrik Röller and Leonard Waverman {{suggested a}} causal link between good telecommunication infrastructure and economic growth.

5|$|In 1957, Pennsylvania law {{required}} that school students read Bible verses {{to start the}} day. The Abington School District added another requirement that the students read the Lord's Prayer. Several Unitarians in Abington, a suburb of Philadelphia, objected and held a protest against it. One of them, Ellery Schempp, contacted the American Civil Liberties Union about the issue. The ACLU and Schempp's parents believed the school prayer law violated the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. The ACLU's lawyers saw Sawyer as the best choice to <b>argue</b> <b>it,</b> given his skill as a litigator and his success in the Deutch case. Sawyer agreed and filed suit in federal district court.|$|E

25|$|The UNRWA {{definition}} is meant solely to determine eligibility for UNRWA assistance. However, some <b>argue</b> <b>it</b> serves {{to perpetuate the}} conflict.

25|$|The {{effect of}} {{saturated}} fat on risk of disease is controversial. Many reviews recommend a diet low in saturated fat and <b>argue</b> <b>it</b> will lower risks of cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, or death. However, other reviews have challenged those arguments or advocated for examining the proportion of saturated to unsaturated fat in the diet.|$|E
25|$|Empiricists {{argue all}} {{knowledge}} come from our senses but if senses are only relevant to our proximal world, {{how do people}} know the distal world? They <b>argue</b> <b>it</b> is through learning and that prior experience {{plays a crucial role}} in shaping our perceptual world. Association is a key function which here refers to linking one sensory experience to another.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the major}} {{benefits}} provided by COFDM is in rendering radio broadcasts relatively immune to multipath distortion and signal fading due to atmospheric conditions or passing aircraft. Proponents of COFDM <b>argue</b> <b>it</b> resists multipath far better than 8VSB. Early 8VSB DTV (digital television) receivers often had difficulty receiving a signal. Also, COFDM allows single-frequency networks, which is not possible with 8VSB.|$|E

This debate is ongoing and research is continuing in an effort to discover the real cause of alcoholic polyneuropathy.|$|E
25|$|In 469, Anagastes, {{the son of}} Arnegisclus who was slain by Attila, brought Dengzich's {{head and}} paraded it through the streets before {{mounting}} it on {{a stake in the}} Hippodrome. Some Historians, like John Man, accept this date {{as the end of the}} Hunnic Empire. However others, such as Kim, <b>argue</b> <b>it</b> continued under Ernak who absorbed the incoming Oghur speakers. These people were similar to the Huns and Attila's empire continued as the Kutrigur and Utigur Hunno-Bulgars. This conclusion is still subject to some controversy.|$|E
25|$|The Ketuvim is {{the last}} of the three {{portions}} of the Tanakh to have been accepted as Biblical canon, it is said that the people of Israel were adding what would become the Ketuvim to their holy literature shortly after the canonization of the prophets.

25|$|In addition, the European Parliament has {{consistently}} opposed {{the lifting of}} the arms embargo to the PRC. Though its agreement is not necessary for lifting the ban, many <b>argue</b> <b>it</b> reflects the will of the European people better as it is the only directly elected European body. The arms embargo has limited China's options from where it may seek military hardware. Among the sources that were sought included the former Soviet bloc that it had a strained relationship with {{as a result of the}} Sino-Soviet split. Other willing suppliers have previously included Israel and South Africa, but American pressure has restricted this co-operation.|$|E
25|$|The Ethiopian Church was {{administratively}} {{part of the}} Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria {{from the}} first half of the 4th century until 1959, when it was granted its own Patriarch by the Coptic Orthodox Pope of Alexandria and Patriarch of All Africa, Cyril VI.

Ethiopia is the second country only after Armenia to have officially proclaimed Christianity as state religion (in 333 AD) though some <b>argue</b> <b>it</b> may even be the first; due to biblical references.|$|E
25|$|Supporters of {{the bombings}} {{generally}} assert that they caused the Japanese surrender, preventing massive casualties {{on both sides}} in the planned invasion of Japan: Kyūshū was to be invaded in October 1945 and Honshū five months later. It was thought Japan would not surrender unless there was an overwhelming demonstration of destructive capability. Those who oppose the bombings <b>argue</b> <b>it</b> was militarily unnecessary, inherently immoral, a war crime, or a form of state terrorism. Critics believe a naval blockade and conventional bombings would have forced Japan to surrender unconditionally. Some critics believe Japan was more motivated to surrender by the Soviet Union's invasion of Manchuria and other Japanese-held areas.|$|E
