McConnell defended his contributors, saying that the right to free speech included the right to donate money. Beshear charged that Republicans, including McConnell, had voted to cut Medicare; McConnell responded that Republicans had not cut Medicare, but had put forward <b>a</b> <b>plan</b> to curb its growth, <b>a</b> <b>plan</b> that didn't differ significantly, McConnell said, from the one proposed by Democratic President Bill Clinton.|$|E

40|$|Current debate centres on the {{inhibitory}} {{and conflict}} {{interpretations of the}} N 2 and P 3 components of the event-related potential (ERP). We examined behavioural responses and ERPs in a cued-Go/NoGo task. Participants were required to inhibit <b>a</b> <b>planned</b> response (NoGo target after Go cue), change <b>a</b> <b>planned</b> response to <b>a</b> different one (Invalid cueing), and activate an unexpected response (Go target after NoGo cue). Responses were slower when participants had to change <b>a</b> <b>planned</b> response, and execute an unplanned response. N 2 was more negative whenever the presented target required a different response to what was expected based on the cue. In contrast, P 3 was increased when participants had to change or inhibit <b>a</b> <b>planned</b> response, but not when executing a response where none was planned. N 2 results {{lend support to the}} conflict account, while P 3 reflects cancellation of <b>a</b> <b>planned</b> response.
