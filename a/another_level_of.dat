5|$|Due to {{the rapid}} pace of operations, deployment, and redeployment, {{coordination}} of artillery units and their fires became a worrisome quandary during the operations. This was made even more problematic by the confusion generated {{by the lack of}} adequate communications systems between the rapidly advancing units. The joint nature of the operation added <b>another</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> complexity to the already overstretched communications network. Regardless, due to the ability of U.S. logisticians to innovate and improvise, supplies of food, water, ammunition, and spare parts arrived at their destinations without any shortages hampering combat operations and the communications system, although complicated, functioned well enough during the short duration of U.S. operations.|$|E
5|$|Super Mario 64 {{is set in}} Princess Peach's Castle, which {{consists}} of three floors, a basement, a moat, and a courtyard. The area outside the castle is an introductory {{area in which the}} player can experiment, testing his or her player skills. Scattered throughout the castle are entrances to courses via secret walls and paintings. Super Mario 64 begins with a letter from Princess Peach inviting Mario to come to her castle for a cake she has baked for him. However, when he arrives, Mario discovers that Bowser has invaded the castle and imprisoned the princess and her servants within it using the power of the castle's 120 Power Stars. Many of the castle's paintings are portals to other worlds, in which Bowser's minions keep watch over the stars. Mario explores the castle for these portals to enter the worlds and recover the stars. He gains access to more rooms as he recovers more Power Stars, and eventually traverses three different obstacle courses, each leading to its own battle with Bowser. Defeating Bowser the first two times earns Mario a key for opening <b>another</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> the castle. After Mario defeats Bowser in the final battle, Peach is released from the stained-glass window above the castle's entrance. Peach rewards Mario by kissing him on the nose and baking the cake that she had promised him.|$|E

25|$|In invertebrates, {{just as in}} Drosophila, {{the binding}} of Hedgehog to PTCH leads to {{internalisation}} and sequestration of the ligand.

In contrast to Drosophila, vertebrates possess <b>another</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> hedgehog regulation through LDA mediated by Hh-interacting protein 1 (HHIP1). HHIP1 also sequesters hedgehog ligands, but unlike PTCH, it {{has no effect on}} the activity of SMO.|$|E

25|$|As such, {{the play}} is one of Fielding's Scriblerian plays, and the {{commentary}} in the print edition adds <b>another</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> satire that originates in the Scriblerus model of Alexander Pope, Jonathan Swift, et al. H. Scriblerus Secundus prefaces the play with claims that Scriblerus spent ten years working on an edition and that the play comes from the Elizabethan time period and {{may or may not}} have been the work of Shakespeare. Additionally, Scriblerus abuses classical sources through mistranslations and misreadings, botches contemporary and traditional critical theory, and is a satirical representation of criticism in general in the tradition of A Tale of a Tub and The Dunciad Variorum. Regardless of the humorous elements, the notes do reveal Fielding's vast classical education.|$|E
25|$|The {{development}} of the ram sometime before the 8th century BC {{changed the nature of}} naval warfare, which had until then been a matter of boarding and hand-to-hand fighting. With a heavy projection {{at the foot of the}} bow, sheathed with metal, usually bronze, a ship could incapacitate an enemy ship by punching a hole in its planking. The relative speed and nimbleness of ships became important, since a slower ship could be outmaneuvered and disabled by a faster one. The earliest designs had only one row of rowers that sat in undecked hulls, rowing against tholes, or oarports, that were placed directly along the railings. The practical upper limit for wooden constructions fast and maneuverable enough for warfare was around 25-30 oars per side. By adding <b>another</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> oars, a development that occurred no later than c. 750 BC, the galley could be made shorter with as many rowers, while making them strong enough to be effective ramming weapons.|$|E
25|$|Continuous network {{models of}} GRNs are an {{extension}} of the boolean networks described above. Nodes still represent genes and connections between them regulatory influences on gene expression. Genes in biological systems display a continuous range of activity levels and {{it has been argued that}} using a continuous representation captures several properties of gene regulatory networks not present in the Boolean model. Formally most of these approaches are similar to an artificial neural network, as inputs to a node are summed up and the result serves as input to a sigmoid function, e.g., but proteins do often control gene expression in a synergistic, i.e. non-linear, way. However, there is now a continuous network model that allows grouping of inputs to a node thus realizing <b>another</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> regulation. This model is formally closer to a higher order recurrent neural network. The same model has also been used to mimic the evolution of cellular differentiation and even multicellular morphogenesis.|$|E

25|$|In 1964, Mills {{decided to}} speak about his inner experiences, but only if asked to do so. He made this {{agreement}} after he received the same message from two different sources: “You must learn to speak the Word again.” Then, people began seeking him out - sometimes arriving unexpectedly on his doorstep - asking about their deepest questions and concerns. Mills found himself speaking spontaneously to these seekers. When their number became too large to speak with individually, Mills began giving lectures. He defined his spontaneous speaking, which he called Unfoldment, as “an impromptu performance under the impelling of divine ideas. It is a projection from another dimension or plane of consciousness, causing those prepared to hear to awaken to the higher or greater possibilities of living {{beyond the limits of}} three dimensions and translating {{what seems to be the}} ordinary into <b>another</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> consideration.” He also often spoke in poetry, offering some 3,000 extemporaneous poems during his lifetime.|$|E
25|$|The {{line between}} hatamoto and gokenin, {{especially}} amongst hatamoto of lower rank, was not rigid, {{and the title}} of hatamoto {{had more to do}} with rank rather than income rating. In the context of an army, it could be compared to the position of an officer. Throughout the Edo period, hatamoto held the distinction that if they possessed high enough rank, they had the right to personal audience with the shogun (these hatamoto were known as ome-mie ijō). All hatamoto can be divided into two categories, the kuramaitori, who took their incomes straight from Tokugawa granaries, and the jikatatori, who held land scattered throughout Japan. <b>Another</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> status distinction amongst the hatamoto was the class of kōtai-yoriai, men who were heads of hatamoto families and held provincial fiefs, and had alternate attendance (sankin-kōtai) duties like the daimyōs. However, as kōtai-yoriai were men of very high income in terms of the spectrum of hatamoto stipends, not all jikatatori hatamoto had the duty of alternate attendance. The dividing line between the upper hatamoto and the fudai daimyōs—the domain lords who were also vassals of the Tokugawa house—was 10,000 koku.|$|E

These are typically made of two family groups, which may be closely related due to previously being part of the same family group which split after becoming too large for the available resources. During the dry season, elephant families may cluster together and form <b>another</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> social organisation known as the clan.

500|$|The {{narrative}} of the School Rumble anime is designed to mirror that of the manga, which results in multiple short story segments with no significant connection. Shown {{from the perspective of}} its characters—notably Tenma and Harima as they attempt similar ploys to get their crush to notice their affection—the anime uses absurdist humor which often combines elements of popular culture to explore the love-triangle, with jokes that work on multiple levels. One such example, highlighted by Lisa Marie, reviewer for Anime Today, is the bike chase scene in episode1 of season one. She notes that while anyone can appreciate the chase's inherent humor, those familiar with Initial D will find <b>another</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> appreciation that nevertheless does not interfere with viewers who do not catch the deeper reference.
