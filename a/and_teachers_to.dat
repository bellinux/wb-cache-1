25|$|In {{response}} to such concerns the Ministry of Education has recently discussed a greater focus on creative and critical thinking, and on learning for lifelong skills rather than simply teaching students to excel in examinations.

As a result, the new Synod grew quickly during the 19th century, reaching 687,000 members by its fiftieth anniversary in 1897.|$|E

25|$|Modernism and {{liberalism}} do {{not constitute}} rigorous and well-defined schools of theology, but are rather an inclination by some writers <b>and</b> <b>teachers</b> <b>to</b> integrate Christian thought {{into the spirit of}} the Age of Enlightenment. New understandings of history and the natural sciences of the day led directly to new approaches to theology. Its opposition to the fundamentalist teaching resulted in religious debates, such as the Fundamentalist–Modernist Controversy within the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America in the 1920s.|$|E

25|$|Opinion within Ethiopia {{turned against}} Haile Selassie I {{owing to the}} {{worldwide}} oil crisis of 1973. This oil crisis caused {{a sharp increase in}} gasoline prices starting on 13 February 1974; food shortages; uncertainty regarding the succession; border wars; and discontent in the middle class created through modernization. The high gasoline prices motivated the taxi drivers <b>and</b> <b>teachers</b> <b>to</b> go on strike on 18 February 1974, and students and workers in Addis Ababa began demonstrating against the government on 20 February 1974. The feudal oligarchial cabinet of Akilou Habte Wolde was toppled, and a new government was formed with Endelkachew Makonnen serving as Prime Minister.|$|E

To compensate {{for the lack of}} opportunities for the Turkish Cypriot students <b>and</b> <b>teachers</b> <b>to</b> benefit from mobility offered by the Erasmus programme, the European Commission has, under the Aid Regulation, set up a community scholarship scheme for the Turkish Cypriot community. This scheme enables undergraduate students <b>and</b> <b>teachers</b> <b>to</b> spend one year abroad at an EU university/higher education institution.

The state then established free, co-educational high schools and primary schools in provincial towns in 1786.
