5|$|<b>Atypical</b> colourations in red foxes usually {{represent}} stages toward full melanism, {{and mostly}} occur in cold regions.|$|E
5|$|<b>Atypical</b> {{development}} of fearfulness, with a constitutional tendency either to excessive or inadequate fear reactions, {{might be necessary}} before an infant is vulnerable {{to the effects of}} poor attachment experiences.|$|E
5|$|Certain {{medications}} {{may cause}} weight gain or changes in body composition; these include insulin, sulfonylureas, thiazolidinediones, <b>atypical</b> antipsychotics, antidepressants, steroids, certain anticonvulsants (phenytoin and valproate), pizotifen, and {{some forms of}} hormonal contraception.|$|E
5|$|Development of an endometrial {{hyperplasia}} (overgrowth of endometrial cells) is {{a significant}} risk factor because hyperplasias can and often do develop into adenocarcinoma, though cancer can develop without {{the presence of a}} hyperplasia. Within ten years, 8–30% of <b>atypical</b> endometrial hyperplasias develop into cancer, whereas 1–3% of non-atypical hyperplasias do so. An <b>atypical</b> hyperplasia is one with visible abnormalities in the nuclei. Pre-cancerous endometrial hyperplasias are also referred to as endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia. Mutations in the KRAS gene can cause endometrial hyperplasia and therefore Type I endometrial cancer. Endometrial hyperplasia typically occurs after the age of 40. Endometrial glandular dysplasia occurs with an overexpression of p53, and develops into a serous carcinoma.|$|E
5|$|One {{study has}} {{reported}} {{a connection between}} a specific genetic marker and disorganized attachment (not RAD) associated with problems of parenting. Another author has compared <b>atypical</b> social behavior in genetic conditions such as Williams syndrome with behaviors symptomatic of RAD.|$|E
5|$|Rhodium {{belongs to}} group 9 of the {{periodic}} table, but {{the configuration of}} electrons in the outermost shells is <b>atypical</b> for the group. This anomaly is also observed in the neighboring elements, niobium (41), ruthenium (44), and palladium (46).|$|E
5|$|The Mongols looted {{the city}} when it fell, but <b>atypical</b> to most sieges {{in the time}} period, they {{permitted}} trade. The richest residents of the city sold their luxury belongings to Mongol soldiers for critically needed food supplies.|$|E
5|$|The summit {{station of}} Mount Washington has an alpine climate or tundra climate (Köppen ET), {{although}} it receives an extremely high amount of precipitation, <b>atypical</b> for most regions with such cold weather. Lower elevations have a subarctic climate (Köppen Dfc).|$|E
5|$|There {{are four}} {{described}} {{species in the}} Amylostereaceae: A.chailletii (the type), A.areolatum, A.ferreum and A.laevigatum. The species were initially considered part of Stereum until mycologist Jacques Boidin found <b>atypical</b> microscopic differences between them. Forty years after his extensive researches from 1958, Boidin reclassified Amylostereum into its own family.|$|E
5|$|When {{thinking}} about including character goods with the volume releases, Sugawara {{came up with}} the <b>atypical</b> idea of releasing a deluxe and normal edition of the manga after contemplating the inconsistency of novels getting both a soft-cover and hard-cover release, but manga only received one version. Because it was a new concept, the group experienced several mishaps such as accidentally placing a vertically flipped illustration on the first deluxe edition. The group also decided to use another <b>atypical</b> practice of keeping catchphrases that appeared in the magazine identical to the ones that appear on the frontispieces of the deluxe editions.|$|E
5|$|Although {{individuals}} with Asperger syndrome acquire language skills without significant general delay and their speech typically lacks significant abnormalities, language acquisition and use is often <b>atypical.</b> Abnormalities include verbosity, abrupt transitions, literal interpretations and miscomprehension of nuance, use of metaphor meaningful {{only to the}} speaker, auditory perception deficits, unusually pedantic, formal or idiosyncratic speech, and oddities in loudness, pitch, intonation, prosody, and rhythm. Echolalia has also been observed in {{individuals with}} AS.|$|E
5|$|<b>Atypical</b> {{antipsychotics}} are modestly {{useful in}} reducing aggression and psychosis {{in people with}} Alzheimer's disease, but their advantages are offset by serious adverse effects, such as stroke, movement difficulties or cognitive decline. When used in the long-term, they {{have been shown to}} associate with increased mortality. Stopping antipsychotic use in this group of people appears to be safe.|$|E
5|$|Definitive {{criteria}} include histopathologic {{evidence of}} endometritis, thickened filled Fallopian tubes, or laparoscopic findings. Gram stain/smear becomes definitive {{in the identification}} of rare, <b>atypical</b> and possibly more serious organisms. Two thirds of patients with laparoscopic evidence of previous PID were not aware they had PID, but even asymptomatic PID can cause serious harm.|$|E
5|$|His vocal {{style has}} varied from a screaming, yowling {{delivery}} as lead vocalist of the Pixies {{to a more}} measured and melodic style in his solo career. His cryptic lyrics mostly explore unconventional subjects, such as surrealism, incest and biblical violence, along with science fiction and surf culture. His use of <b>atypical</b> meter signatures, loud–quiet dynamics and distinct preference for live-to-two-track recording in {{his career as a}} solo artist give him a distinct style within alternative rock.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, Schmid guided Los Angeles to {{the playoffs}} but lost in the semifinals to the Kansas City Wizards. The team also played in that year's CONCACAF Champions' Cup, a {{competition}} consisting of the best clubs from North America, Central America, and the Caribbean. The Galaxy defeated the Honduran champion Olimpia 3–2 to win the Cup. Schmid was forced to play an <b>atypical</b> squad since the final was held during the MLS off-season while adjustments to the following season's lineup were being made.|$|E
5|$|In boxing, judo, taekwondo and wrestling, two bronze medals {{were awarded}} in each weight class. In baseball, <b>atypical</b> {{rainfall}} {{during the games}} forced the Rio de Janeiro Organizing Committee for the Pan American Games to rearrange the schedule, and the competition for the bronze medal never took place. Mexico had to leave on the previously assigned date without playing for the third position. Therefore, the technical delegate ruled that Mexico and Nicaragua were each to be awarded a bronze medal.|$|E
5|$|In {{regards to}} {{pathogenic}} care, or {{the type of}} care in which these behaviors are present, a new criterion for Disinhibited Social Engagement Disorder now includes chronically harsh punishment or other types of severely inept caregiving. Relating to pathogenic care for both proposed disorders, a new criterion is rearing in <b>atypical</b> environments such as institutions with high child/caregiver ratios that cut down on opportunities to form attachments with a caregiver.|$|E
5|$|Inverse {{psoriasis}} (also {{known as}} flexural psoriasis) appears as smooth, inflamed patches of skin. The patches frequently affect skin folds, particularly around the genitals (between the thigh and groin), the armpits, {{in the skin}} folds of an overweight abdomen (known as panniculus), between the buttocks in the intergluteal cleft, and under the breasts in the inframammary fold. Heat, trauma, and infection are thought {{to play a role}} in the development of this <b>atypical</b> form of psoriasis.|$|E
5|$|Many riders used normal {{road race}} bikes for this stage, as {{the course is}} highly <b>atypical</b> for a time trial, with roads that were not flat and straight. Most of those riders altered their road race bikes with the {{aerodynamic}} handlebars of a time trial bike, but some, including race leader Danilo Di Luca, did not. The climbs in the stage increased the overall chances for strong climbers who are relatively weak time trialists, such as Damiano Cunego and Gilberto Simoni.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{and thus}} <b>atypical</b> of the sculptures {{in the park}} is the bronze statue of the artist Heinrich Zille, which was created in 196465 by Heinrich Drake for an {{exhibition}} in the Treptower Park and afterwards moved to Köllnischer Park. It is listed as a landmark by the City of Berlin.|$|E
5|$|More {{schools for}} the deaf were founded after ASD, and {{knowledge}} of ASL spread to these schools. In addition, the rise of Deaf community organizations bolstered the continued use of ASL. Societies such as the National Association of the Deaf and the National Fraternal Society of the Deaf held national conventions that attracted signers from across the country. This all contributed to ASL's wide use over a large geographical area, <b>atypical</b> of a sign language.|$|E
5|$|Moult {{is poorly}} recorded, the only records coming from Sakhalin and Himachal Pradesh. In Sakhalin, moult occurs in August and September, between the {{breeding}} season and migration. In Himachal Pradesh, aviculturalist G. A. Perreau observed captive and wild birds {{and reported that}} they were yellow from December to spring and whitish during the remainder of the year, a pattern which may be <b>atypical.</b>|$|E
5|$|Myocardial {{infarction}} (MI), {{commonly known}} as a heart attack, occurs when blood flow decreases or stops to {{a part of the}} heart, causing damage to the heart muscle. The most common symptom is chest pain or discomfort which may travel into the shoulder, arm, back, neck, or jaw. Often it occurs in the center or left side of the chest and lasts {{for more than a few}} minutes. The discomfort may occasionally feel like heartburn. Other symptoms may include shortness of breath, nausea, feeling faint, a cold sweat, or feeling tired. About 30% of people have <b>atypical</b> symptoms. Women more often have <b>atypical</b> symptoms than men. Among those over 75 years old, about 5% have had an MI with little or no history of symptoms. An MI may cause heart failure, an irregular heartbeat, cardiogenic shock, or cardiac arrest.|$|E
5|$|Numerous {{studies have}} shown higher rates of same sex {{attraction}} in intersex people, with a recent Australian study of people born with <b>atypical</b> sex characteristics finding that 52% of respondents were non-heterosexual, thus research on intersex subjects {{has been used to}} explore means of preventing homosexuality. As an experience of being born with sex characteristics that do not fit social norms, intersex can be distinguished from transgender, while some intersex people are both intersex and transgender.|$|E
5|$|Psychiatric {{symptoms}} can {{be treated}} with medications {{similar to those used}} in the general population. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and mirtazapine have been recommended for depression, while <b>atypical</b> antipsychotic drugs are recommended for psychosis and behavioral problems. Specialist neuropsychiatric input is recommended as people may require long-term treatment with multiple medications in combination.|$|E
5|$|Public {{schools in}} San Diego are {{operated}} by independent school districts. The {{majority of the}} public schools in the city are served by the San Diego Unified School District, the second-largest school district in California, which includes 11 K-8 schools, 107 elementary schools, 24 middle schools, 13 <b>atypical</b> and alternative schools, 28 high schools, and 45 charter schools.|$|E
5|$|Since 2012, Federal Cartridge Company {{produces}} a 5.7×28mm round under their American Eagle brand. Designated the AE5728A, this cartridge uses a 40-grain total metal jacket (TMJ) projectile, that is <b>atypical</b> {{in that it}} does not use a copper plated bullet; sectioned pictures show a very thick full copper jacket. The AE5728A casings are of FN manufacture, and the muzzle velocity is slightly lower than that of the SS197SR.|$|E
5|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} at Skyline Studios in New York City. Skyline {{was only a}} few blocks away from the Public Access Synthesizer Studio, where the band had recorded their previous albums. Alan Bezozi and John Flansburgh worked together to create <b>atypical</b> drum tracks, including one that samples the sound of Flansburgh's kitchen sink and refrigerator being struck with a drum stick. An Alesis SR-16 drum machine was used to program the drums.|$|E
5|$|The {{cruciform}} abbey {{is built}} of Bath stone, {{which gives the}} exterior its yellow colour. It is an <b>atypical</b> example of the Perpendicular form of Gothic architecture, with low aisles and nave arcades and a tall clerestory. The walls and roofs are supported by buttresses and surmounted by battlements, pinnacles and pierced parapets, {{many of which were}} added by George Manners during his 1830's restorations.|$|E
5|$|The genus, though, is very {{variable}} {{in terms of}} habitat. Individual sundew species have adapted {{to a wide variety}} of environments, including <b>atypical</b> habitats, such as rainforests, deserts (D. burmannii and D. indica), and even highly shaded environments (Queensland sundews). The temperate species, which form hibernacula in the winter, are examples of such adaptation to habitats; in general, sundews tend to inhabit warm climates, and are only moderately frost-resistant.|$|E
5|$|The {{mainstay}} of treatment is antipsychotic medication, along with counselling, {{job training and}} social rehabilitation. It is unclear whether typical or <b>atypical</b> antipsychotics are better. In {{those who do not}} improve with other antipsychotics clozapine may be tried. In more serious situations where there is risk to self or others involuntary hospitalization may be necessary, although hospital stays are now shorter and less frequent than they once were.|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} side effect {{is an increase}} in risk for epileptic seizures, which caused the drug to be withdrawn from the market for some time and then caused the recommended dosage to be reduced. In comparison to many other antidepressants, it does not cause as much weight gain, sexual dysfunction, or sleepiness. Bupropion acts as an norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor (NDRI). It is an <b>atypical</b> antidepressant, different from most commonly prescribed antidepressants such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).|$|E
5|$|The most {{widespread}} form of Lucian work song is the chanté siay, which {{accompanies the}} sawing of wood. The vocals are {{performed by a}} lead singer and two responding singers, accompanied by a ka and tibwa duo. Both instruments are played in an <b>atypical</b> manner. The ka drum is played on the ground rather than upright, and the tibwa percussion sticks are struck against a bamboo or wooden stick rather than the rim of a drum.|$|E
5|$|The {{shoreline}} of Harveys Lake {{is entirely}} {{surrounded by a}} paved road, which is <b>atypical</b> for a lake shoreline. Homes and cottages are situated on the road opposite the lake, and significant development {{has occurred in the}} vicinity of the lake. A ditch and outlet drainage structure made of concrete at Wardens Place drains into the lake; its purpose is to control small-scale local road flooding.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} lesser known {{details about the}} Wreck that are easily missed when it rambles down Techwood Drive. Specific {{physical}} details and the actual person behind the wheel are often missed or overlooked. The Wreck is financially maintained through Ramblin' Reck Club appearances and fundraisers. There is no official source of funding from the Institute, Athletic Association, or Alumni Association. This gives the Wreck a unique level of independence that is <b>atypical</b> amongst college mascots.|$|E
5|$|American Sign Language (ASL) is {{a natural}} {{language}} {{that serves as the}} predominant sign language of Deaf communities in the United States and most of Anglophone Canada. Besides North America, dialects of ASL and ASL-based creoles are used in many countries around the world, including much of West Africa and parts of Southeast Asia. ASL is also widely learned as a second language, serving as a lingua franca. ASL is most closely related to French Sign Language (LSF). It has been proposed that ASL is a creole language of LSF, although ASL shows features <b>atypical</b> of creole languages, such as agglutinative morphology.|$|E
