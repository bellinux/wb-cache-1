40|$|The fungal genome is a {{dynamically}} changing structure. By its remodelling, the organism {{can respond to}} the environmental changes and develop itself. The genome expansion is often accompanied by transition to parasitic or mutualistic way of life. The genome expansion {{can be caused by}} the multiplication of some chromosomes (<b>aneuploidisation),</b> the whole genome duplication (polyploidisation) or the spreading of repetitive sequences. The impact of genome size to the ecology and life strategy of the organisms is more and more studied in recent years. In mycology, nevertheless, it escapes sufficient attention. The flow cytometry (FCM) is a modern and progressively developing method that enables to determine the genome size and estimate CG/AT base ratio. The combination of FCM with knowledge of the fungal ecology and forces that form the genome enable to discover a general trends of the evolutionary processes. My study summarises knowledge about the processes leading to changes in the size/structure of the fungal genome, the correlations with genome size and presents the principle of flow cytometry and its application in mycology...|$|E
40|$|Heterozygous {{loss of the}} TP 53 gene on {{chromosome}} arm 17 p in colorectal carcinomas {{was strongly}} associated with DNA aneuploidy (P or = 1. 1 and or = 1. 3 had a significantly higher frequency of TP 53 gene loss (85 %) (P < 0. 0001 and P < 0. 0001, respectively). There was a significant association between loss of the TP 53 gene and histological grade (P < 0. 01), and there tended to be an association between loss of the TP 53 gene and degree of cellular atypia (P < 0. 05), with TP 53 gene loss being most frequent in moderately differentiated carcinomas, and in carcinomas with severe cellular atypia, respectively. The proportion of tumours with loss of the TP 53 gene increased significantly towards the distal part of the large bowel (P < 0. 0001). These results indicate that different genetic mechanisms {{may be involved in}} the carcinogenesis in colon and rectum carcinomas, and in the two subsets of DNA aneuploid carcinomas. Furthermore, the data may suggest a role for the TP 53 gene in the <b>aneuploidisation</b> process, possibly as a 'target' for a whole chromosome loss...|$|E
