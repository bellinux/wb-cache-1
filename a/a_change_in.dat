50|$|Analogous to the lambda is the {{modified}} duration, {{which is the}} percentage <b>change</b> <b>in</b> the market price of the bond(s) for <b>a</b> unit <b>change</b> <b>in</b> the yield (i.e. it is equivalent to DV01 divided by the market price). Unlike the lambda, which is an elasticity (<b>a</b> percentage <b>change</b> <b>in</b> output for <b>a</b> percentage <b>change</b> <b>in</b> input), {{the modified}} duration is instead <b>a</b> semi-elasticity—a percentage <b>change</b> <b>in</b> output for <b>a</b> unit <b>change</b> <b>in</b> input.|$|R
50|$|Formally, {{modified}} duration is a semi-elasticity, the percent <b>change</b> <b>in</b> price for <b>a</b> unit <b>change</b> <b>in</b> yield, {{rather than an}} elasticity, which is <b>a</b> percentage <b>change</b> <b>in</b> output for <b>a</b> percentage <b>change</b> <b>in</b> input.

5|$|Several other {{significant}} events occurred around 42 Ma, including cessation of metamorphism of the Leech River Schists (resulting from the Metchosin/Crescent Formation being thrust under Vancouver Island) {{and the end}} of strike-slip motion on the Straight Creek Fault; these may reflect the last movement of Siletzia relative to North America. On a broader scale, there was <b>a</b> <b>change</b> <b>in</b> absolute direction of the Pacific plate (marked {{by the end of the}} bend in the Hawaiian-Emperor seamount chain), and <b>a</b> <b>change</b> <b>in</b> the convergence of the Kula plate with the North American plate.|$|E

The bill was eventually defeated in the Senate on June 28, 2007, when a cloture motion failed on a 46–53 vote.

5|$|Blood free {{thyroxine}} and TSH {{levels are}} monitored {{to help determine}} whether the dose is adequate. This is done 4–8 weeks {{after the start of}} treatment or <b>a</b> <b>change</b> <b>in</b> levothyroxine dose. Once the adequate replacement dose has been established, the tests can be repeated after 6 and then 12 months, unless there is <b>a</b> <b>change</b> <b>in</b> symptoms. In people with central/secondary hypothyroidism, TSH is not a reliable marker of hormone replacement and decisions are based mainly on the free T4 level. Levothyroxine is best taken 30–60 minutes before breakfast, or four hours after food, as certain substances such as food and calcium can inhibit the absorption of levothyroxine. There is no direct way of increasing thyroid hormone secretion by the thyroid gland.|$|E

Organisms in which a particular chromosome, or chromosome segment, is under- or overrepresented {{are said to be}} aneuploid (from the Greek words meaning [...] "not", [...] "good", and [...] "fold").

5|$|Cluster {{diffusion}} involves {{motion of}} atomic clusters {{ranging in size}} from dimers to islands containing hundreds of atoms.
