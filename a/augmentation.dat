40|$|Abstract Augmented reality (AR) is {{the concept}} of {{inserting}} virtual objects into real scenes. Often, <b>augmentations</b> are aligned with rigid planar objects in the scene. However, a more difficult task is to align non-rigid <b>augmentations</b> with flexible objects like cloth. To address this problem, we present a method to perform real-time flexible <b>augmentations</b> on cloth. Our method involves sparse cloth-tracking in video images using a new vision-based marker system with temporal coherence. We include an image-based method to automatically acquire real world illumination and shadows from the input frame. Non-rigid <b>augmentations</b> are achieved by rendering a textured 2 D mesh aligned with the cloth surface, and combining the illumination result. The ability to perform realistic <b>augmentations</b> on cloth leads to applications in fashion, advertising, home decor and entertainment. We demonstrate our cloth <b>augmentations</b> with an application to interactively design T-shirts by demonstrating different virtual logos on a physical shirt in real-time...|$|R

50|$|One of {{the main}} focuses of Project: Snowblinds {{gameplay}} is Nathan Frost's nano-technology <b>augmentations.</b> Although most of Frost's <b>augmentations</b> are inactive {{at the beginning of}} the game, they become activated as the game progresses, granting Frost additional powers.|$|R
5|$|Players {{are further}} {{encouraged}} to customize their characters through nano-augmentations—cybernetic devices that grant characters superhuman powers. While the game contains eighteen different nano-augmentations, the player can install {{a maximum of}} nine, as each must be used on a certain part of the body: one in the arms, legs, eyes, and head; two underneath the skin; and three in the torso. This forces the player to choose carefully between the benefits offered by each <b>augmentation.</b> For example, the arm <b>augmentation</b> requires the player to decide between boosting their character's skill in hand-to-hand combat or his ability to lift heavy objects.|$|E

5|$|<b>Augmentation</b> {{involves}} the supplemental release of natural enemies {{that occur in}} a particular area, boosting the naturally occurring populations there. In inoculative release, small numbers of the control agents are released at intervals {{to allow them to}} reproduce, in the hope of setting up longer-term control, and thus keeping the pest down to a low level, constituting prevention rather than cure. In inundative release, in contrast, large numbers are released in the hope of rapidly reducing a damaging pest population, correcting a problem that has already arisen. <b>Augmentation</b> can be effective, but is not guaranteed to work, and depends on the precise details of the interactions between each pest and control agent.|$|E

50|$|It {{was common}} for Portuguese monarchs to grant <b>augmentations</b> of honour to the {{achievements}} of arms as a reward or recognition to their bearers. The most common of these <b>augmentations</b> was the inclusion of elements of the arms of Portugal, {{that could be the}} escutcheon of Portugal ancient (arms of Portugal without the bordure), quinas (escutcheons azur charged with five plates) or castles or in gules field. Occasionally, some <b>augmentations</b> were done with the inclusion of elements of the arms of other kingdoms in whose royal houses the Portuguese Monarchs had ancestors. In the late 19th century, some <b>augmentations</b> were done by the marshaling of the full and un-defaced arms of Portugal with the original arms of the bearers, which was a clear infraction of the heraldic rules that limit the use of those arms to the Monarch.|$|R

5|$|There {{are three}} basic {{strategies}} for biological pest control: classical (importation), where a natural enemy of a pest is {{introduced in the}} hope of achieving control; inductive (<b>augmentation),</b> in which a large population of natural enemies are administered for quick pest control; and inoculative (conservation), in which measures are taken to maintain natural enemies through regular reestablishment.|$|E

5|$|Two prototypes {{were lost}} in accidents, both {{of which had been}} {{primarily}} caused by poor piloting decisions and errors leading to two ground collision incidents; a third Tornado prototype was seriously damaged by an incident involving pilot-induced pitch oscillation. During the type's development, aircraft designers of the era were beginning to incorporate features such as more sophisticated stability <b>augmentation</b> systems and autopilots. Aircraft such as the Tornado and the General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon made use of these new technologies. Failure testing of the Tornado's triplex analogue command and stability <b>augmentation</b> system (CSAS) was conducted on a series of realistic flight control rigs; the variable-sweep wings in combination with varying, and frequently very heavy, payloads complicated the clearance process.|$|E
5|$|An st-{{planar graph}} is a {{connected}} planar graph {{together with a}} bipolar orientation of that graph, an orientation that makes it acyclic with a single source and a single sink, {{both of which are}} required {{to be on the same}} face as each other. Such a graph may be made into a strongly connected graph by adding one more edge, from the sink back to the source, through the outer face. The dual of this augmented planar graph is itself the <b>augmentation</b> of another st-planar graph.|$|E

However, in 1961 Lucien Stiernon demonstrated that the two persons are in fact the same, with pansebastohypertatos being merely a rhetorical <b>augmentation</b> of the proper title.|$|E
