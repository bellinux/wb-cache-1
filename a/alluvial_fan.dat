5|$|A lack of {{preparation}} for the disaster contributed to the high death toll. Armero had been built on an <b>alluvial</b> <b>fan</b> that had been overrun by historic mudflows; authorities had ignored a hazard-zone map that showed the potential damage to the town from lahars. Residents stayed inside their dwellings to avoid the falling ash, as local officials had instructed them to do, not thinking {{that they might be}} buried by the mudflows.|$|E
5|$|Built {{on top of}} an <b>alluvial</b> <b>fan</b> {{that had}} been host to {{historic}} lahars, the town was previously destroyed by a volcanic eruption in 1595 and by mudflows in 1845. In the 1595 eruption, three distinct Plinian eruptions produced lahars that claimed the lives of 636people. During the 1845 event, 1,000people were killed by earthquake-generated mudflows near the Magdalena River.|$|E

40|$|Several {{types of}} contact karst are {{found within the}} Slovenian karst, but the most common is the ponor type, which appears between flysch and limestone. The most {{extensive}} contact of this type is in western Slovenia, {{in the area of}} Matarsko podolje, where a variety of typical contact karst depression features can be found. Relict <b>alluvial</b> <b>fans</b> on contact karst are the result of the gradual denudation of alluvial cover from flysch and chemical denudation of carbonate bedrock in the area of <b>alluvial</b> <b>fans.</b> Geomorphologic features and processes on <b>alluvial</b> <b>fans,</b> and the influences of <b>alluvial</b> <b>fans</b> on the development of local karst have been investigated in detail...|$|R
40|$|Moore and Howard [1] {{reported}} {{the discovery of}} large <b>alluvial</b> <b>fans</b> in craters on Mars. Their initial survey from 0 - 30 S found that these fans clustered in three distinct regions and occurred at around the + 1 km MOLA defined Mars datum. However, due to incomplete image coverage, Moore and Howard [1]could not conduct a comprehensive survey. They also recognized, though did not quantitatively address, gravity scaling issues. Here, we briefly discuss the identification of <b>alluvial</b> <b>fans</b> on Mars, then consider the general equations governing the deposition of <b>alluvial</b> <b>fans</b> and hypothesize a method for learning about grain size in <b>alluvial</b> <b>fans</b> on Mars...|$|R

In the quadrangle of Freeland, the surficial geology near Little Wapwallopen Creek mainly features Wisconsinan Till, Wisconsinan Ice-Contact Stratified Drift, and alluvium. The surficial geology near the creek in the Wilkes-Barre West quadrangle mainly consists of Wisconsinan Till, with some scattered areas of bedrock and alluvium.|$|E
5|$|Since {{settlement}} it {{has repeatedly}} flooded, sometimes with disastrous consequences. Adelaide's western suburbs were especially {{prone to flooding}} due to their location on the river's <b>alluvial</b> <b>fan.</b> As development of Adelaide progressed the amount of rainfall required for flooding decreased and consequent damage increased. Increased stormwater runoff, modification of the river's banks and other changes all served to exacerbate the problem. Work done by various groups to minimise flooding was often counter productive {{with the creation of}} levees, moving and widening channels and other works simply shifting the flooding elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of February 19, 1845, a large {{earthquake}} resulted in a substantial mudflow. This mudflow flowed down {{the valley of the}} Lagunillas River for approximately , spilling out of the river channel and killing much of the local population. After reaching an <b>alluvial</b> <b>fan,</b> the mudflow split into two branches. The larger portion of it joined the Lagunillas River and flowed into the nearby Magdalena River, while the smaller portion was diverted by hills in front of Lagunillas Canyon, turned 90degrees to the north until it reached the Sabandija River, and then flowed east with the Sabandija River, until it rejoined the other branch of the mudflow at the junction of the Sabandija and the Magdalena. It is estimated that 1000people were killed in the mudflows.|$|E

40|$|The Playa El Fresnal {{area is a}} tilted terrane {{characteristic}} of an extensional basin. It is a half graben/tilted-block system with a playa-lake on the basin floor flanked by piedmonts covered by <b>alluvial</b> <b>fans.</b> Structural heterogeneities within normal fault zones influenced the geomorphic expression of the uplifted footwall blocks of associated volcanism, and the downdropped hanging wall. The footwall area is the main sediment source, but the hanging wall-derived sediments are more extensive. The ancient <b>alluvial</b> <b>fans</b> are in the distal part, whereas the hanging-wall sediments {{are located in the}} apex area. A geomorphic analysis of the relative topographic position of the <b>alluvial</b> <b>fans,</b> degree of dissection of the original surfaces, general sedimentology (facies description), and stream channel network type, highlights the importance of climatic change in interpreting alluvial-fan surfaces. Three generations of <b>alluvial</b> <b>fans</b> were identified on the footwall and hanging wall slopes. They were formed during the late Quaternary climatic shift, consistent with the main climatic changes recorded in the paleolake stratigraphy of northern Mexico and the American Southwest. These <b>alluvial</b> <b>fans</b> consist mainly of debris-flow deposits from flash floods, probably triggered by a change from relatively moist to arid conditions. They contrast with the typically lower-flow-regime of thick-bedded, cross-bedded, and lenticular channel facies, and associated floodplain sequences of rivers...|$|R
5|$|From {{its origin}} to Birdwood the river follows rolling, {{relatively}} level country before entering a hilly section {{that continues to}} Gumeracha. The river then follows sedimentary rock strata before entering a gorge after Cudlee Creek. It flows through the gorge to Athelstone, passing over the Eden Fault Zone of the Adelaide Hills face and associated escarpment. After the scarp it flows over sedimentary rocks of varying resistance to erosion, {{which has led to}} interspersed narrows and broad basins. From the base of the Adelaide Hills to Adelaide's central business district it runs in a shallow valley with a terraced floor, then down the slope of its own <b>alluvial</b> <b>fan.</b> The structure of this fan shows that the river formerly entered Gulf St Vincent via the Port River. Over time the Torrens deposited sediment, choking its own outflow; becoming locked behind coastal sand dunes and forming the swampy areas of the Cowandilla Plains and the reedbeds.|$|E
5|$|In {{its lower}} reaches, the {{surficial}} geology {{in the vicinity}} of Shickshinny Creek consists of urban land highly disrupted by cut and fill, alluvium, alluvial terrace, fill, Wisconsinan Ice-Contact Stratified Drift containing stratified sand and gravel, Wisconsinan Ice-Contact Delta containing sand and gravel, Wisconsinan Bouldery Till (a glaicial or resedimented till containing boulders, and bedrock consisting of sandstone and shale. The bedrock mainly occurs on the mountains {{in this part of the}} watershed. In the middle reaches of the creek, the surficial geology mainly features bedrock consisting of sandstone and shale, alluvium, and a glacial or resedimented till known as Wisconsinan Till. Some Wisconsinan Outwash and alluvial terrace is also present near Koonsville. Some patches of Wisconsinan Bouldery Till and wetlands are also present. In its upper reaches, the creek is almost entirely dominated by Wisconsinan Till, bedrock, and some lakes. However, there is a patch of <b>alluvial</b> <b>fan</b> immediately north of Shickshinny Lake and some Wisconsinan Bouldery Till and Wisconsinan Outwash not far from the creek's source.|$|E

25|$|<b>Alluvial</b> <b>fan</b> deltas in {{this region}} have shallow slopes. They are poorly {{channelized}} because sediment is being added to them from upstream (infilling the channels) at a rate {{equal to or greater}} than the rate at which it can be removed.|$|E
25|$|The {{next section}} of line to Randa is shaped {{primarily}} by the landslide of 1991, which buried 250 metres of the then existing line and necessitated extensive new line construction. Behind Herbriggen, the line initially follows {{the course of the}} Vispa {{in the middle of the}} valley. Shortly before the <b>alluvial</b> <b>fan,</b> however, the line curves sharply to the left and runs together with the valley road at the extreme edge of the valley floor, in order to avoid the area of land threatened by possible further landslides. South of the <b>alluvial</b> <b>fan,</b> the formation descends at a gradient of 120% and returns to the original route along the Vispa. The entire bypass section is equipped with racks. Since 1991, this has also been the only location where a rack is required for trains heading towards Zermatt.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to these debris flows, flash floods carrying extremely high sediment loads were very dangerous. Together the flash floods and debris flows destroyed hundreds of houses, bridges, and other structures. They incised new channels to depths of several meters into every <b>alluvial</b> <b>fan</b> delta on the Vargas state coastline, and they blanketed these fans with sediment.|$|E

The fans are of different sizes, types, shapes   andstages, {{laid down by}} rivers, permanent streams and valleys. The composition of  the sediments of the fans differs widely depending on {{the source of the}} sediments, the depositional area, size and type of the fan. Some of the <b>alluvial</b> <b>fans</b> have typical fan forms; others are hardly recognized, especially in the field; in nature; and more specifically when the fan areas are occupied as agricultural fields and/ or are very large with very gentle gradient that hinder their occurrences. Majority of the studied <b>alluvial</b> <b>fans</b> in the studied area are not presented on geological maps. This is attributed {{to the fact that they}} are not presented on the base geological maps because they are unrecognizable in the field, mainly because they have lost their fan shapes. Others; however, are presented even on the geological map of Iraq at scale of 1 : 1000000. In this study, the main <b>alluvial</b> <b>fans</b> are presented and described with the reason and form of their deposition. Accordingly, different types of <b>alluvial</b> <b>fans</b> are presented and described including their coverage areas, types, number of stages, shape and constituents.

Very large <b>alluvial</b> <b>fans</b> merged to form continuous alluvial slopes called bajadas along the Panamint Range. The faster uplift along the Black Mountains formed much smaller <b>alluvial</b> <b>fans</b> because older fans are buried under playa sediments before they can grow too large. Slot canyons are often found at the mouths of the streams that feed the fans, and the slot canyons in turn are topped by V-shaped gorges. This forms what looks like a wineglass shape to some people, thus giving them their names, [...] "wineglass canyons".|$|R
