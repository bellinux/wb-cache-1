But sparrows splashed in the pools of sunshine; in a lull the darky's voice came again, chanting passionately, [...] "In de spring, spring, spring!" [...] and Carl clamored: [...] "I've {{got to get}} out to-day. Terrible glad it's a half-holiday. Wonder if I dare telephone to Ruth?" ...|$|E

50|$|The Bagheera won the ADAC Silberne Zitrone ("Silver Lemon") {{award in}} 1975 for the poorest quality {{car at the}} time. Complaints ranged from a leaky body that allowed rain to enter the cabin to {{mechanical}} failures. Few Bagheeras survive today, and the cause is usually extensive corrosion of the <b>steel</b> <b>chassis.</b> While the polyester body panels do not rust, the problem {{was caused by the}} underlying <b>steel</b> <b>chassis</b> having almost no corrosion protection. Matra learned from this and fully galvanized the chassis of the Bagheera's successor, the Matra Murena.|$|R
