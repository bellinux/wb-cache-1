He wrote highly of {{her role in the}} arc saying, [...] "Without Meredith, and without one of Pompeo's strongest performances in her long time on the show, [...] "How to Save a Life" [...] would have run the risk of coming across as a baldly manipulative death episod". He noted that although it might not be the [...] "ideal Emmy-submission episode" [...] for Pompeo, because of {{the amount of time that}} she spent on screen, it was among the best work she's ever done on the show." [...] Robert Bianco of USA Today thought of the episode as [...] "a showcase for Pompeo", agreeing that although she didn't play a prominent part until the later half of the episode, but some memorable and well-played scenes: [...] "from her angry response to the doctor who tries to tell her what her choices are, to her resignation when she realizes she has to comfort and motivate the young doctor whose mistakes cost Derek his life." [...] Alexandria Ingham Guardian Liberty Voice was also impressed with Pompeo’s [...] "range of emotions", which she described similarly, as going through many stages, including anger, resignation compassion.|$|E
2500|$|Astrophysicist Martin Rees has {{suggested}} that Dawkins' attack on mainstream religion is unhelpful. Regarding Rees' claim in his book Our Cosmic Habitat that [...] "such questions lie beyond science; however, they are the province of philosophers and theologians", Dawkins asks [...] "what expertise can theologians bring to deep cosmological questions that scientists cannot?" [...] Elsewhere, Dawkins has written that [...] "there's <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world between a belief that one is prepared to defend by quoting evidence and logic, and a belief that is supported by nothing more than tradition, authority or revelation." ...|$|E
2500|$|Half-Life 2 {{begins as}} the G-Man speaks to Gordon in a dreamlike scene, after keeping him [...] "in stasis far from Earth, thought, and time itself" [...] {{for nearly two}} decades, during {{which he did not}} {{physically}} age. He comments that [...] "the right man in the wrong place can make <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world." [...] Gordon is then [...] "point inserted" [...] into a train bound for City 17, to the (mild) surprise of the other passengers.

2500|$|In his seminal {{critical}} study {{about homosexuality}} in the movies, The Celluloid Closet, film historian Vito Russo wrote: [...] "Desert Hearts {{is a love}} story that recreates with perceptiveness and tenderness what {{it might have been}} like for two women of different generations and backgrounds to fall in love in the Fifties....Deitch's refusal to feature the straight world's reaction to lesbianism as the focus of her film made <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> way the relationship between the women was perceived by audiences." [...] He remarked about Vincent Canby's review of the film: [...] "In the New York Times, Vincent Canby complained that we are not given enough information about the quality of Vivian's broken marriage, asking if perhaps her lesbianism was a hysterical reaction to her divorce. This is the point at which many heterosexual critics disqualify themselves from perceptively reviewing gay films." ...|$|E
