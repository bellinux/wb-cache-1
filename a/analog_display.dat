A number of the <b>analogs</b> <b>displayed</b> inhibitory activity against both mycobacterial species in minimal media. Several of the molecules displayed potent levels of inhibition against Mtb with MIC values equal to or below those obtained with the anti-tuberculosis drugs D-cycloserine and isoniazid.

We have compared cytotoxicity of FMdC towards a human promyeolocytic leukemia line HL- 60 and a human colorectal carcinoma line COLO- 205. Despite dCK activity being by far the highest in cells of lymphoid origin, the effects of FMdC were detectable at the lowest drug concentration only in a solid tumor cell line, and at higher concentrations they were qualitatively similar in the two tumor lines (increased cell protein content, cell cycle block and apoptosis). Apparently, low dCK activity in solid tumor cells sufficiently activates FMdC to yield cytotoxic effects, while high dCK activity in leukemia cells does not increase its cytotoxicity.

50|$|<b>Analog</b> <b>display</b> of {{the time}} is nearly {{universal}} in watches sold as jewelry or collectibles, and in these watches, the range of different styles of hands, numbers, {{and other aspects of}} the analog dial is very broad. In watches sold for timekeeping, <b>analog</b> <b>display</b> remains very popular, as many people find it easier to read than digital display; but in timekeeping watches the emphasis is on clarity and accurate reading {{of the time}} under all conditions (clearly marked digits, easily visible hands, large watch faces, etc.). They are specifically designed for the left wrist with the stem (the knob used for changing the time) {{on the right side of}} the watch; this makes it easy to change the time without removing the watch from the wrist. This is the case if one is right-handed and the watch is worn on the left wrist (as is traditionally done). If one is left-handed and wears the watch on the right wrist, one has to remove the watch from the wrist to reset the time or to wind the watch.|$|E

This service became known in some markets as call waiting ID, or (when it was combined with call-disposition options), Call Waiting Deluxe; it is technically referred to as <b>Analog</b> <b>Display</b> Services Interface.

50|$|<b>Analog</b> <b>Display</b> Services Interface (ADSI) is a {{telephony}} {{technology that}} is used in {{plain old telephone service}} (POTS) or computer-based private branch exchange (PBX) telephone service. It works in conjunction with a screen-based telephone ("screenphone") or other compatible customer-premises equipment (CPE) to provide the user with softkey access to telephone company or internal PBX custom calling features. It is an analog service because it uses analog frequency-shift keying (FSK) technology to interact with an LCD screen via short, low-baud rate, downloads to refresh and re-program softkeys in real-time.|$|E

5000|$|The first {{hints of}} glass cockpits {{emerged in the}} 1970s when {{flight-worthy}} cathode ray tube (CRT) screens began to replace electromechanical displays, gauges and instruments. A [...] "glass" [...] cockpit refers {{to the use of}} computer monitors instead of gauges and other <b>analog</b> <b>displays.</b> Aircraft were getting progressively more displays, dials and information dashboards that eventually competed for space and pilot attention. In the 1970s, the average aircraft had more than 100 cockpit instruments and controls.|$|R
50|$|<b>Analog</b> <b>display</b> devices {{reproduce}} each {{frame in}} the same way, effectively doubling the frame rate as far as perceptible overall flicker is concerned. When the image capture device acquires the fields one at a time, rather than dividing up a complete frame after it is captured, the frame rate for motion is effectively doubled as well, resulting in smoother, more lifelike reproduction (although with halved detail) of rapidly moving parts of the image when viewed on an interlaced CRT display, but the display of such a signal on a progressive scan device is problematic.|$|E
50|$|Electronic movements, {{also known}} as quartz movements, have few or no moving parts, except a quartz crystal which is made to vibrate by the {{piezoelectric}} effect. A varying electric voltage {{is applied to the}} crystal, which responds by changing its shape so, in combination with some electronic components, it functions as an oscillator. It resonates at a specific highly stable frequency, which is used to accurately pace a timekeeping mechanism. Most quartz movements are primarily electronic but are geared to drive mechanical hands {{on the face of the}} watch to provide a traditional <b>analog</b> <b>display</b> of the time, a feature most consumers still prefer.|$|E
5000|$|Firstly, due to {{phosphor}} persistence, {{even though}} only one [...] "pixel" [...] is being drawn {{at a time}} (recall that on an <b>analog</b> <b>display,</b> [...] "pixel" [...] is ill-defined, as there are no fixed horizontal divisions; rather, there is a [...] "flying spot"), {{by the time the}} whole screen has been painted, the initial pixel is still relatively illuminated. Its brightness will have dropped some, which can cause a perception of flicker. This is one reason for the use of interlacing - since only every other line is drawn in a single field of broadcast video, the bright newly-drawn lines interlaced with the somewhat dimmed older drawn lines create relatively more even illumination.|$|E

5000|$|Often an MFD {{will be used}} {{in concert}} with a primary flight display, and forms a {{component}} of a glass cockpit. MFDs are part of the digital era of modern planes or helicopter. The first MFD were introduced by air forces in the late 1960s and early 1970s; an early example is the F-111D (first ordered in 1967, delivered from 1970-73). The advantage of an MFD over <b>analog</b> <b>display</b> is that an MFD does not consume much space in the cockpit, as data can be presented in multiple pages, rather than always being present at once. For example the cockpit of RAH-66 [...] "Comanche" [...] does not have analog dials or gauges at all. All information is displayed on the MFD pages. The possible MFD pages could differ for every plane, complementing their abilities (in combat).|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} design {{did not have}} an exposure control in the viewfinder. The camera had to be taken away from the eye view, to observe the needle on the light meter. (This in fact wasn't a real disadvantage, because to focus the user also had to take the camera to the same position. In normal lighting conditions, the exposure settings of a manual camera really only have to be changed after ten minutes or so, or when changing location. Nevertheless, an exposure control display in the viewfinder was considered very early at Rollei, but an <b>analog</b> <b>display</b> was discarded for limited space reasons, and light emitting diodes were not available at the time.) So not until summer of 1979 were the Rollei 35 TE and Rollei 35 SE released to the market. As the electronic exposure meter needed more power, a larger battery, of type PX-27 with 5.6 volts, was placed where the former instrument movement was mounted, The electronic circuit was built into the former battery compartment. Unlike the Rollei 35 LED theshutter position and aperture control settings were transferred, without any electrical contact wear and tear, using a differential gear turning a variable density filter in front of the CdS light sensor. The release button activated the light meter, when slightly depressed. Three LEDs in the viewfinder indicate the correct exposure. This system worked perfectly, yet earlier models are more in demand today.|$|E

No other information on similar SS 14 -based radiopeptides is available.|$|R
