5|$|The {{mechanism}} of prion replication {{has implications for}} designing drugs. Since the incubation period of prion diseases is so long, an effective drug {{does not need to}} eliminate all prions, but simply needs to slow down the rate of exponential growth. Models predict that {{the most effective way to}} achieve this, using <b>a</b> <b>drug</b> with the lowest possible dose, is to find <b>a</b> <b>drug</b> that binds to fibril ends and blocks them from growing any further.|$|E

5|$|Icos {{is famous}} for tadalafil (Cialis), <b>a</b> <b>drug</b> used to treat erectile dysfunction. This drug was {{discovered}} by GlaxoSmithKline, developed by Icos, and manufactured and marketed in partnership with Eli Lilly.

Cialis was the only drug developed by the company to be approved. LeukArrest, <b>a</b> <b>drug</b> to treat shock, and Pafase, developed for sepsis, were both tested in phaseIII clinical trials, but testing was discontinued after unpromising results during the trials. Eli Lilly acquired Icos in January 2007, and most of Icos's workers were laid off soon after. CMC Biologics, a Danish contract manufacturer, bought the remnants of Icos and retained the remaining employees.|$|E
