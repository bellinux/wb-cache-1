25|$|Biosynthesis of this 31-membered macrocycle {{begins as}} the loading domain is primed with the starter unit, 4,5-dihydroxocyclohex-1-ene-carboxylic acid, which {{is derived from}} the shikimate pathway. Note that the {{cyclohexane}} ring of the starting unit is reduced during the transfer to module 1. The starting unit is then modified by a series of Claisen condensations with malonyl or methylmalonyl substrates, which are attached to an <b>acyl</b> <b>carrier</b> <b>protein</b> (ACP) and extend the polyketide by two carbons each. After each successive condensation, the growing polyketide is further modified according to enzymatic domains that are present to reduce and dehydrate it, thereby introducing the diversity of functionalities observed in rapamycin (figure 1). Once the linear polyketide is complete, L-pipecolic acid, which is synthesized by a lysine cycloamidase from an L-lysine, is added to the terminal end of the polyketide by an NRPS. Then, the NSPS cyclizes the polyketide, giving prerapamycin, the first enzyme-free product. The macrocyclic core is then customized by a series of post-PKS enzymes through methylations by MTases and oxidations by P-450s to yield rapamycin.|$|E
2500|$|When {{found in}} foods, most {{pantothenic}} acid {{is in the}} form of CoA or <b>acyl</b> <b>carrier</b> <b>protein</b> (ACP). [...] For the intestinal cells to absorb this vitamin, it must be converted into free pantothenic acid. [...] Within the lumen of the intestine, CoA and ACP are hydrolyzed into 4'-phosphopantetheine.

Phosphopantetheine fulfills two demands in these biosynthetic pathways. First, the intermediates remain covalently linked to the synthases (or synthetases) in an energy-rich linkage. Second, the flexibility and length of the phosphopantetheine chain (approximately 2 nm) allows the covalently tethered intermediates {{to have access to}} spatially distinct enzyme-active sites.

The flexible nature of the Ppant arm and the transient nature of ACP−enzyme interactions impose a major obstacle to obtaining structural information relevant to understanding polyketide and fatty acid biosynthesis.

40|$|SummaryProtein {{interactions}} between <b>acyl</b> <b>carrier</b> <b>proteins</b> (ACPs) and trans-acting acyltransferase domains (trans-ATs) {{are critical for}} regioselective extender unit installation by many polyketide synthases, yet little is known regarding the specificity of these interactions, particularly for trans-ATs with unusual extender unit specificities. Currently, the best-studied trans-AT with nonmalonyl specificity is KirCII from kirromycin biosynthesis. Here, we developed an assay to probe ACP interactions based on leveraging the extender unit promiscuity of KirCII. The assay allows us to identify residues on the ACP surface that contribute to specific recognition by KirCII. This information proved sufficient to modify a noncognate ACP from a different biosynthetic system to be a substrate for KirCII. The findings form a foundation for further understanding the specificity of trans-AT:ACP protein interactions and for engineering modular polyketide synthases to produce analogs...|$|R
40|$|<b>Acyl</b> <b>carrier</b> <b>proteins</b> (ACPs) play a {{fundamental}} role in directing intermediates among the enzyme active sites of fatty acid and polyketide synthases (PKSs).

The reciprocal transfer from S. coelicolor FAS ACP to a PKS ACP was not observed. Several mutations in both act ACP and S. coelicolor FAS ACP could be classified by their participation in either donation or acceptance of this malonyl group. These mutations indicated that self-malonylation and malonyl transfer could be completely decoupled, implying that they were separate processes and that a FAS ACP could be converted from a non-malonyl-transferring protein to one with malonyl transferase activity...|$|R
