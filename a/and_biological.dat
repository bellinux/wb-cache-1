5|$|Although {{commonly}} {{included in}} botany curricula and textbooks, fungi are {{more closely related}} to animals than to plants and are placed with the animals in the monophyletic group of opisthokonts.

These current phylogenetic analyses often overturn classifications based on older and sometimes less discriminative methods based on morphological features <b>and</b> <b>biological</b> species concepts obtained from experimental matings.|$|E
5|$|Based {{on fossil}} <b>and</b> <b>biological</b> evidence, most {{scientists}} accept that birds are a specialised subgroup of theropod dinosaurs, and more specifically, they {{are members of}} Maniraptora, a group of theropods which includes dromaeosaurs and oviraptorids, among others. As scientists have discovered more theropods closely related to birds, the previously clear distinction between non-birds and birds has become blurred. Recent discoveries in the Liaoning Province of northeast China, which demonstrate many small theropod feathered dinosaurs, contribute to this ambiguity.|$|E
40|$|Plaque type psoriasis, {{the focus}} of this thesis, {{is by far the most}} common {{clinical}} form of psoriasis with 80 % of psoriasis patients suffering from it. Plaque type psoriasis, also known as psoriasis vulgaris, can occur everywhere on the skin and is characterized by well-defined, indurated erythematous scaly plaques. It mostly occurs at preferred body sites (elbows, knees, scalp, lumbosacral region, umbillicus). This thesis focuses on the treatment of plaque type psoriasis with methotrexate <b>and</b> <b>biologicals.</b> The goal is to optimize existing treatments. In the first part we focus on the safety <b>and</b> effectiveness of <b>biological</b> <b>and</b> methotrexate treatment of psoriasis in a daily practice setting.

5|$|Biological {{control is}} first {{recorded}} around 300 AD in China, when colonies of weaver ants, Oecophylla smaragdina, were intentionally placed in citrus plantations to control beetles and caterpillars. Also in China, ducks {{were used in}} paddy fields to consume pests, as illustrated in ancient cave art. In 1762, an Indian mynah was brought to Mauritius to control locusts, and about the same time, citrus trees in Burma were connected by bamboos to allow ants to pass between them and help control caterpillars. In the 1880s, ladybirds were used in citrus plantations in California to control scale insects, and other biological control experiments followed. The introduction of DDT, a cheap and effective compound, put an effective stop to biological control experiments. By the 1960s, problems of resistance to chemicals and damage to the environment began to emerge, <b>and</b> <b>biological</b> control had a renaissance. Chemical pest control is still the predominant type of pest control today, although {{a renewed interest in}} traditional <b>and</b> <b>biological</b> pest control developed {{towards the end of the}} 20th century and continues to this day.|$|E
