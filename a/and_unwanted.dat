25|$|Sex {{education}} programs in the United States teach students about sexual health as well as ways to avoid sexually transmitted diseases <b>and</b> <b>unwanted</b> teenage pregnancy. The three main types of programs are abstinence-only, abstinence-plus, and comprehensive sex education.

Sex education has many benefits as it educates students about the human anatomy and teaches the importance of having healthy relationships. Adequate sex {{education programs in}} public schools greatly benefit students and have the potential to reduce the high percentages of sexually transmitted diseases <b>and</b> <b>unwanted</b> pregnancies in America.|$|E

25|$|Environmental {{and social}} factors are also {{thought to have}} a {{significant}} influence on the onset of NPD.

The child typically comes to believe they have some personality defect that makes them unvalued <b>and</b> <b>unwanted.</b> Overindulgent, permissive parenting as well as insensitive, over-controlling parenting, are believed to be contributing factors.|$|E
25|$|In 1944, Burroughs began {{living with}} Joan Vollmer Adams in an {{apartment}} they shared with Jack Kerouac and Edie Parker, Kerouac's first wife. Vollmer Adams {{was married to a}} G.I. with whom she had a young daughter, Julie Adams. Burroughs and Kerouac got into trouble with the law for failing to report a murder involving Lucien Carr, who had killed David Kammerer in a confrontation over Kammerer's incessant <b>and</b> <b>unwanted</b> advances. This incident inspired Burroughs and Kerouac to collaborate on a novel titled And the Hippos Were Boiled in Their Tanks, completed in 1945. The two fledgling authors were unable to get it published, but the manuscript was eventually published in November 2008 by Grove Press and Penguin Books.|$|E
25|$|Lever drags {{work through}} cam action to {{increase}} or decrease pressure on the drag washers located on the spool itself. Most lever drags offer preset drag positions for strike (reduced drag to avoid tearing the hook out of the fish), full (used once the hook is set) and freespool (see above). Lever drags are simpler and faster to adjust during the fight. And, since they use the spool for the washer stack rather than the drive gear, the washers can be larger, offering more resistance and smoother action. The disadvantage is that in freespool, there can be residual <b>and</b> <b>unwanted</b> resistance since the drag mechanism may not be {{completely out of the}} picture without resorting to more complex mechanics.|$|E
