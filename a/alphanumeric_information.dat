50|$|The {{invention}} of the Intel 8080 microprocessor chip in April 1974 made practical {{the development of the}} (relatively) affordable mass-market microcomputer. In the USA this first appeared in early 1975 {{in the form of an}} unassembled kit, the Altair 8800; shortly afterward pre-assembled Altairs were offered. The sudden popularity of desktop computers happened because the 8080 CPU could represent and manipulate 256 discrete values in its 8-bit registers. Thus the 7-bit ASCII standard for the representation of alphanumeric data became feasible for the first time in a machine much smaller and less expensive than the furniture-size minicomputers, with their processors that occupied entire circuit boards. This new class of computer was practical for serious work because it could input, process, and output <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>information.</b> It also enabled sophisticated programs such as database managers and BASIC interpreters to become available to a larger market consisting of people possessing lesser technical skills.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — The {{current study}} aimed at {{determining}} risk areas for {{the insertion of}} infectious agents by means of geoprocessing techniques. The {{study was conducted in}} the cities of Paço do Lumiar, Raposa, São José de Ribamar and São Luís, which are part of the Microregion of Urban Agglomeration in the State of Maranhão. In order to determine these risk areas, a geographic database was developed from the collection, storage and processing of data, using <b>alphanumeric</b> data (<b>information</b> from the questionnaire and data obtained from the State protection agency) and geographic data (georeferenced maps obtained from the protection agency and field research data from a GPS device). With this work, it was possible to identify and map risk areas by the determination of 35 points and 181 livestock properties at higher epidemiological risk. The identification, rating and mapping of these areas will help implementing a more efficient epidemiological surveillance system and show the importance of using geoprocessing in epidemiology...|$|R

5000|$|Prior to the mid-20th century, {{individuals}} {{searching for}} published literature {{had to rely}} on printed bibliographic indexes. [...] "During the early 1960s computers were used to digitize text for the first time; the purpose was to reduce the cost and time required to publish two American abstracting journals, the Index Medicus of the National Library of Medicine and the Scientific and Technical Aerospace Reports of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). By the late 1960s such bodies of digitized <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>information,</b> known as bibliographic and numeric databases, constituted a new type of information resource". [...] "Online interactive retrieval became commercially viable in the early 1970s over private telecommunications networks. The first services offered a few databases of indexes and abstracts of scholarly literature. These databases contained bibliographic descriptions of journal articles that were searchable by keywords in author and title, and sometimes by journal name or subject heading. The user interfaces were crude, the access was expensive, and searching was done by librarians on behalf of 'end users'".|$|E

40|$|The {{supply chain}} {{literature}} still largely focuses on asset, <b>alphanumeric</b> data and <b>information</b> (in {{the form of}} documents and files) elements of exchange between supply chain partners, {{despite the fact that}} increased integration and collaboration clearly require development of more complex elements of expertise and knowledge. In this respect, this paper recognizes the knowledge management (KM) literature as a potential source of new insights to add conceptual depth and understanding to managing 21 st century supply chains. Specific KM theories and constructs are identified as potentially contributing to theory and practice in supply chain contexts. An overall framework for supply chain knowledge management is developed, along with literature-based definitions of supply chain knowledge transfer, competence and maturity constructs. The "knowledge lens" theory building approach is applied to import these perspectives into supply chain domains, with efforts to maintain conceptual consistency across the two literature streams.

40|$|International audienceIntroducing {{spatial data}} into multidimensional models {{leads to the}} concept of Spatial OLAP (SOLAP). Existing SOLAP models do not {{completely}} integrate the semantic component of geographic <b>information</b> (<b>alphanumeric</b> attributes and relationships) or the flexibility of spatial analysis into multidimensional analysis. In this paper, the authors propose the GeoCube model and its associated operators to overcome these limitations. GeoCube enriches the SOLAP concepts of spatial measure and spatial dimension and take into account the semantic component of geographic information. The authors define geographic measures and dimensions as geographic and/or complex objects belonging to hierarchy schemas. GeoCube’s algebra extends SOLAP operators with five new operators, i. e., Classify, Specialize, Permute, OLAP-Buffer and OLAP-Overlay. In addition to classical drill-and-slice OLAP operators, GeoCube provides two operators for navigating the hierarchy of the measures, and two spatial analysis operators that dynamically modify the structure of the geographic hypercube. Finally, to exploit the symmetrical representation of dimensions and measures, GeoCube provides an operator capable of permuting dimension and measure. In this paper, GeoCube is presented using environmental data on the pollution of the Venetian Lagoon...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{present the}} {{underlying}} vision, the approach, {{the current status}} and the gained experiences {{in the attempt to}} establish a personal and electronic health record (PEHR) system in the Rhine-Neckar Region. First, an electronic health record (EHR) shall be implemented, which is in a second step expanded by a personal health record (PHR) in order to form a PEHR. Integration between the PEHR and the source systems is achieved with international standards (HL 7, DICOM, IHE) and existing technologies. Non-image <b>information</b> (<b>alphanumeric</b> data, e. g. reports, lab results) is replicated; image information is replicated and then referenced after 3 months for capacity reasons. The approach to use off-the-shelf technologies and existing international standards proved successful but current HIS/EPR systems need to improve their support. Major issues could be indentified for the management of access rights and data privacy when using only EHR approaches. PHR is superior for as well ethical as technical reasons.

40|$|This licentiate thesis {{concerns}} advanced {{digital product}} catalogues, {{with the main}} focus on product presentation. A computer based digital product catalogue opens new possibilities for advanced product presentation and integration into the existing compute environment. Several new possibilities for product presentation become available. By use of photorealistic rendering techniques, images showing every different product design or combination can be displayed. The mechanical behavior of a product or an assembling instruction {{can be viewed as}} an animated sequence for achieving an even higher degree of understanding. The digital catalogue can interface with CAD systems for direct transfer of graphic- and <b>alphanumeric</b> product <b>information.</b> The main aim of this work is to evaluate ideas concerning product presentation {{for the next generation of}} digital product catalogues. Attention is also paid to program interaction and techniques for easier creation of computer-generated renderings. The ideas are exemplified through the development of two prototype systems. The functionality and interface layout of the developed prototype systems are studied by interviews and practical tests with presumptive users. The first system exemplifies an advanced digital product catalogue managing building components. It is capable of displaying photorealistic renderings showing all available products and product combinations as well as animated sequences. The second system demonstrates a digital product catalogue handling furniture. The digital catalogue makes it possible to display synthetic images of all available frame-fabric combinations. The persons interviewed have a positive attitude to the current digital product catalogues. The study performed shows some important matters for future development of digital product catalogues. A standardized and general format for managing product information would simplify the digital product catalogue issue. Furthermore, it is of great interest that an advanced digital product catalogue be capable of displaying images of all different products and product designs. If the product catalogue-managing program includes a photorealistic-rendering engine it is only necessary to distribute the geometry and surface definitions of the products included. This reduces the storage space needed significantly. The trend towards faster and less expensive computers is advantageous to this kind of systems...|$|R

Moreover, I wanted to shape the relationship between the Spanish History and Cadastral History along this professional project. On the other hand, we have to pay special attention to the vital importance of land administration in the current society. The Cadastre has served as an important State's instrument of tax management in Spain since eighteenth century. Nowadays, its significance not only lies on this point, in fact, the Cadastre is used as an historical source about agriculture and livestock in Spain, as well as the properties' distribution. We, as historians, must attend to the special relevance of the latest outstanding aspects. So, throughout this practise report, I have tried to remark these aspects. Over the 120 hours of my practical activities, I have carried out several tasks related to the cadastral management as it has included in the sixth section of this work.
