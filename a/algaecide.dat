25|$|Due to its low {{solubility}} in water (8ppm at neutral pH), zinc pyrithione is suitable for use in outdoor paints and other products that provide protection against mildew and algae. It is an effective <b>algaecide.</b> It is chemically incompatible with paints relying on metal carboxylate curing agents.

There {{is a need for}} natural and cheap alternatives to synthetic <b>algaecides.</b> In the present study, we investigated the potential of aqueous crude extract of Azadirachta indica to inhibit the growth of Scenedesmus quadricauda. Phytochemical screening of the extract revealed the presence of groups of bioactive compounds that are capable of inhibiting microalgal growth. Chlorophyll a concentration, dry weight production and cell density of microalga decreased with increasing crude extract concentration. After three days of exposure, the 1000 mg/L extract concentration resulted in complete growth inhibition and cell lysis. Furthermore, the ability of S. quadricauda to form multi-celled coenobial structures was compromised in a concentration dependent manner. In general, catalase and peroxidase activities of the microalga were upregulated with increasing extract concentration.

25|$|Besides {{treating}} the circulating cooling water in large industrial cooling tower systems to minimize scaling and fouling, the water should be filtered to remove particulates, and also be dosed with biocides and <b>algaecides</b> to prevent growths that could {{interfere with the}} continuous flow of the water. Under certain conditions, a biofilm of micro-organisms such as bacteria, fungi and algae can grow very rapidly in the cooling water, and can reduce the heat transfer efficiency of the cooling tower. Biofilm can be reduced or prevented by using chlorine or other chemicals. A normal industrial practice is to use two biocides, such as oxidizing and non-oxidizing types to complement each other's strengths and weaknesses, and to ensure a broader spectrum of attack. In most cases, a continual low level oxidizing biocide is used, then alternating to a periodic shock dose of non-oxidizing biocides.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Cyanobacteria (“blue-green algae”) from {{marine and}} {{freshwater}} habitats {{are known to}} produce a diverse array of toxic or otherwise bioactive metabolites. However, the functional role {{of the vast majority}} of these compounds, particularly in terms of the physiology and ecology of the cyanobacteria that produce them, remains largely unknown. A limited number of studies have suggested that some of the compounds may have ecological roles as allelochemicals, specifically including compounds that may inhibit competing sympatric macrophytes, algae and microbes. These allelochemicals may also play a role in defense against potential predators and grazers, particularly aquatic invertebrates and their larvae. This review will discuss the existing evidence for the allelochemical roles of cyanobacterial toxins, as well as the potential for development and application of these compounds as <b>algaecides,</b> herbicides and insecticides, and specifically present relevant results from investigations into toxins of cyanobacteria from the Florida Everglades and associated waterways...|$|R

The EU banned the use of organotin compounds in 2003, while concerns over the toxicity of these compounds to marine life and damage to the reproduction and growth of some marine species (some reports describe biological effects to marine life at a concentration of 1 nanogram per liter) have led to a worldwide ban by the International Maritime Organization.

40|$|The {{management}} and control of cyanobacteria in water supply storage facilities and of cyanotoxins in drinking water may be approached {{at a number of}} points and levels in the hierarchy of the total supply system. A detailed assessment of water supply systems with respect to the potential impact of blooms and cyanotoxins on water quality and public health has been presented in Chapter 6. The first preference for control is the prevention of eutrophication, which is discussed in Chapter 8. The next level of management response is reservoir and water body management which can include some engineering techniques to alter hydrophysical conditions in the water body in order to reduce cyanobacterial growth (section 8. 5). The more immediate and short-term control techniques which can be used in the management of raw water abstraction include the avoidance of contamination by positioning of offtakes, selection of intake depth, offtake by bank filtration, and the use of barriers to restrict scum movement. Another intervention technique is chemical treatment with algicides. <b>Algaecides</b> have been, and will continue to be, used as emergency measures for the control of cyanobacteria, and their role in management strategies needs to be assessed fro...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Annona glabra L. is a semi-deciduous {{tree that}} {{contains}} several active substances, including secondary metabolites, with antifungal activity. Phytopathogenic {{strains of the}} genus Pythium cause billion dollar losses {{all over the world}} on natural and crop species. Searching for eco-friendly <b>algaecides</b> and fungicides, we analyzed the effects of acetone extracts of A. glabra leaves on the algae Rhaphidocelis subcapitata (Korshikov) and on the oomycete Pythium aphanidermatum (Edson). We evaluated ten extract concentrations for each organism - 0 to 400 mg L- 1 for algae and 0 - 1000 µg disc 1 for oomycete. The results showed no effect on algae up to 75 mg L- 1, but a significant inhibitory effect at 125 mg L- 1 and above, which reduced the growth rate and the final biomass of the algae. Extract concentrations above 200 mg L- 1 were completely inhibitory. The half maximal inhibitory concentration for 72 and 96 h of exposure to our crude extracts are comparable to those obtained with commercial fungicides and herbicides used in aquatic ecosystems. The P. aphanidermatum inhibition concentrations have effects comparable to fungicides as Cycloheximide and Bifonazole. Some substances isolated from the extracts are described as antifungals, which could explain part of anti-oomycete activity.

40|$|Cyanobacteria blooms are {{a risk to}} {{environmental}} health and public safety due to the potent toxins certain cyanobacteria can produce. These nuisance organisms can be removed from water bodies by biomass flocculation and sedimentation. Here, we studied the efficacy of combinations of a low dose coagulant (poly-aluminium chloride-PAC-or chitosan) with different ballast compounds (red soil, bauxite, gravel, aluminium modified zeolite and lanthanum modified bentonite) to remove cyanobacterial biomass from water collected in Funil Reservoir (Brazil). We tested the effect of different cyanobacterial biomass concentrations on removal efficiency. We also examined if zeta potential was altered by treatments. Addition of low doses of PAC and chitosan (1 - 8 mg Al L- 1) to the cyanobacterial suspensions caused flock formation, but did not settle the cyanobacteria. When those low dose coagulants were combined with ballast, effective settling in a dose-dependent way up to 99. 7 % removal of the flocks could be achieved without any effect on the zeta potential and thus without potential membrane damage.

40|$|In some {{bacterial}} {{species and}} photosynthetic cohorts, including algae, the enzyme l,l-diaminopimelate aminotransferase (DapL) (E. C. 2. 6. 1. 83) {{is involved in}} the anabolism of the essential amino acid L-lysine. DapL catalyzes the conversion of tetrahydrodipicolinate (THDPA) to l,l-diaminopimelate (l,l-DAP), in one step bypassing the DapD, DapC and DapE enzymatic reactions present in the acyl DAP pathways. Here we present an in vivo and in vitro characterization of the DapL ortholog from the alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (Cr-DapL). The in vivo analysis illustrated that the enzyme is able to functionally complement the E. coli dap auxotrophs and was essential for plant development in Arabidopsis. In vitro, the enzyme was able to inter-convert THDPA and l,l-DAP, showing strong substrate specificity. Cr-DapL was dimeric in both solution and when crystallized. The structure of Cr-DapL was solved in its apo form, showing an overall architecture of a α/β protein with each monomer in the dimer adopting a pyridoxal phosphate-dependent transferase-like fold in a V-shaped conformation. The active site comprises residues from both monomers in the dimer and shows some rearrangement when compared to the apo-DapL structure from Arabidopsis. Since animals do not possess the enzymatic machinery necessary for the de novo synthesis of the amino acid l-lysine, enzymes involved in this pathway are attractive targets for the development of antibiotics, herbicides and <b>algaecides...</b>|$|R
