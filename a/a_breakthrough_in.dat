5|$|At {{the time}} of the letter, the {{estimated}} material necessary for a fission chain reaction was several tons.

5|$|After {{struggling}} for <b>a</b> <b>breakthrough</b> <b>in</b> film, Chastain had six releases in 2011, getting wide recognition for her roles {{in several of}} them. The first of these roles was as the wife of Michael Shannon's character in Jeff Nichols' Take Shelter. The drama {{tells the story of}} a troubled father who tries to protect his family from an impending storm. It was screened at the 2011 Sundance Film Festival, and the critic Tim Robey of The Daily Telegraph noted how much Chastain's supporting part aided the narrative. She received an Independent Spirit Award for Best Supporting Female nomination for the film.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal {{began the}} match the {{brighter}} {{of the two}} teams, dominating in possession {{and the number of}} chances created. Tottenham created their best chance to score in the first half, but struggled to find <b>a</b> <b>breakthrough</b> <b>in</b> the second half, hardly troubling the Arsenal defence. With neither team able to score after 90 minutes, the match ended in a draw, meaning each team held the trophy for six months each.|$|E

5|$|In 2016 <b>a</b> <b>breakthrough</b> <b>in</b> {{creating}} a strong light aluminium steel alloy {{which might be}} suitable in applications such as aircraft was announced by researchers at Pohang University of Science and Technology. Adding small amounts of nickel was found to result in precipitation as nano particles of brittle B2 intermetallic compounds which had previously resulted in weakness. The result was a cheap strong light steel alloy—nearly as strong as titanium at 10% of the cost—which is slated for trial production at industrial scale by POSCO, a Korean steelmaker.|$|E
5|$|Manchester United, {{the holders}} of the FA Cup, began their defence of the trophy {{with a home}} tie against non-league Exeter City. United had made several first team changes and {{struggled}} to find <b>a</b> <b>breakthrough</b> <b>in</b> the tie. Even with the second half introductions of Paul Scholes and Cristiano Ronaldo, the visitors held on for a goalless draw. The match was replayed at Exeter's home ground, St James Park on 19 January 2005. Ronaldo scored the opening goal of the match in the ninth minute and Wayne Rooney added a second, three minutes from normal time.|$|E
5|$|Stansfield's first {{club was}} Evesham Colts under-10s. He played at county level for Worcestershire, Leicestershire and Devon. When his family settled back in Devon he joined Twyford Spartans, scoring 84 goals in 54 matches. He played in Tiverton Town's youth {{team as a}} left back before {{reverting}} to being a striker at his first senior club, non-League side Cullompton Rangers. He later moved to Elmore, where he attracted trials from Exeter City, Wolverhampton Wanderers and Torquay United, {{all of which were}} unsuccessful. His siblings joined the Royal Air Force and he thought of joining them, but continued searching for <b>a</b> <b>breakthrough</b> <b>in</b> professional football.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} day, 13 May, the French were {{undone by}} their poor tactical deployment. They strung their armour {{out in a}} thin line between Hannut and Huy, leaving no defence in depth, which {{was the point of}} sending the French armour to the Gembloux gap in the first place. This left Hoepner with a chance to mass against one of the French Light Divisions (the 3e DLM) and achieve <b>a</b> <b>breakthrough</b> <b>in</b> that sector. Moreover, with no reserves behind the front, the French denied themselves the chance of a counterattack. The victory saw the Panzer Corps out-manoeuvre the 2e DLM on its left flank. The Belgian III Corps, retreating from Liege, offered to support the French front held by the 3e DLM. This offer was rejected.|$|E
5|$|Disappointed in {{his failure}} to make <b>a</b> <b>breakthrough</b> <b>in</b> the NBA, Parker turned to Europe to resurrect his {{basketball}} career, intending {{to return to the}} NBA after a good season with a European club. Eventually he moved to Israel in the 2000–01 season, where he was signed by the Israeli EuroLeague powerhouse Maccabi Tel Aviv. Initially, Parker and his wife were intimidated by the occasional bomb attacks in the city, but they soon settled in and Parker was able to focus on his basketball career. Within his first season with his new club, he became one of their most pivotal players. Parker was signed to fill the void left by Doron Sheffer's retirement at the shooting guard position, but ended up featuring as a both scorer and play-maker for Maccabi. He immediately brought to the team his ability to score, rebound, block shots, and even entertain the crowds with slam dunks. In Parker's inaugural season, Maccabi won the Israeli domestic championship and the Israeli National Cup, as well as the FIBA SuproLeague Cup. He continued his fine form for the club in the 2001–02 season, averaging 16.4 points per game and 5.2 rebounds per game as Maccabi again won both domestic titles, and even reached the Euroleague 2001–02 Final Four.|$|E
5|$|The first {{prototype}} pylon {{was developed}} by Martin Jehart of Bellutti Protection Systems, an Austrian engineering firm specializing in the manufacturing of technical materials and tarpaulin. They initially used a latex balloon for crash tests and aerodynamic studies and after many tests and research settled {{on the use of}} a combination of different materials, the crucial component being spinnaker ripstop nylon, an extremely lightweight and flexible material used for making sails for boats. This would prove to be <b>a</b> <b>breakthrough</b> <b>in</b> the development of the Air Gates producing a pylon that would rip instantaneously when hit by a plane. Over 70 tests of the pylon were carried out on the ground using a car with a wing strapped on the roof before they were ready to undergo tests with a real plane. Eight different cars were used in these tests as well as a trailer and truck. Hungarian pilot, Péter Besenyei worked closely with the team and attempted the first deliberate pylon hit in early 2003 with positive results. The first Air Gates, which were cylindrical, were finally ready to be used at the very first Red Bull Air Races held in Austria and Hungary later that year.|$|E

5|$|Though the German {{advance in}} the south was slower than planned, it was faster than the Soviets expected. On 9 July, the first German units reached the Psel River. The next day, the first German {{infantry}} crossed the river. Despite the deep defensive system and minefields, German tank losses remained lower than the Soviet's. At this point, Hoth turned the II SS Panzer Corps away from Oboyan to attack toward the northeast {{in the direction of}} Prokhorovka. The main concern of Manstein and Hausser was the inability of Army Detachment Kempf to advance and protect the eastern flank of the II SS Panzer Corps. On 11 July, Army Detachment Kempf finally achieved <b>a</b> <b>breakthrough.</b> <b>In</b> a surprise night attack, the 6th Panzer Division seized a bridge across the Donets. Once across, Breith made every effort to push troops and vehicles across the river for an advance on Prokhorovka from the south. A linkup with the II SS Panzer Corps would result with the Soviet 69th Army becoming encircled.|$|E
