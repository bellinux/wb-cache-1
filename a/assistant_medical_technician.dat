The pressure to reduce both health and education budgets has led to school nurse staff and programs being eliminated. A 2012 questionnaire by the National Association of School Nurse Consultants (NASSNC) found that 55 % of the state school nurses consultants who responded reported that some school nursing positions have been dissolved or replaced with unlicensed staff, <b>medical</b> <b>assistants,</b> emergency <b>medical</b> <b>technicians,</b> certified nursing <b>assistants</b> or volunteers. Therefore the school is without a school nurse to attend to the health needs of students or to supervise unlicensed personnel staffing health rooms. Additionally, the questionnaire found that 68 % of respondents reported that school nurses and others have provided medication administration training to unlicensed staff in districts where there are no school nurses to provide services (NASSNC, 2012). The NASN and NASSNC strongly oppose a decrease in school nurses as student health needs are increasing. Every child should have access to a school nurse.

The concordance of triage level between emergency <b>medical</b> <b>technicians</b> and triage nurses increases the accuracy and reduce of delivery time of patients, however the results of some studies demonstrated the poor triage of patients. This study was conducted aimed to determine the overall concordance of triage level between emergency <b>medical</b> <b>technicians,</b> triage nurses and instructor. Materials and Method: In this descriptive study, one instructor, 5 triage nurses and 30 emergency <b>medical</b> <b>technicians</b> participated through census in Iranshahr in 2014. Data collection tools were the demographic information form and “Emergency Severity Index" triage form. 78 patients were triaged separately by emergency <b>medical</b> <b>technicians,</b> triage nurses and instructor (as criteria). The overall concordance was assessed by kappa coefficient using SPSS 16.
