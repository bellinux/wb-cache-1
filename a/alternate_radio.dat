Amedeo Nobile was the first to visit the Norwegian ship Hobby to try to get Norwegian help for a search. Word also reached Amundsen in Oslo, who immediately volunteered to start on a search mission. When the Norwegian government officially approached the Italian government proposing Amundsen as expedition leader, they were rebuffed and Lieutenant Hjalmar Riiser-Larsen was appointed instead. Almost every Arctic explorer of note offered assistance or money for the search, including the American Lincoln Ellsworth.|$|E

[...] An <b>alternate</b> <b>radio</b> edit of the song without the lyric exists, with the following explanation by the artist: [...] "To the radio community: The enclosed CD contains two versions of [...] "LA Song" [...] the first single from my new album, Screamin' for My Supper. The original version of the song includes a line where, {{in the midst of}} a dark period in my life, I talk about having a gun. I wrote this song before the recent tragic shootings that have so shaken this country. In light of these horrible events, and especially out of respect for those who have been deeply affected by them, I have chosen to record an alternate version with a new lyric which remains true to the essence of the song. Ultimately [...] "LA Song" [...] is about emerging from depression and self-doubt to the realization that who you are isn't about where you are or what's around you but that [...] "THE GOOD LIFE LIES WITHIN." [...] I don't want one particular lyric to prevent the song's positive message from reaching as many listeners as possible. As an Artist, I have the responsibility to not compromise my work. As a radio programmer, you have the responsibility to decide what's most appropriate for your audience. Thanks for listening! Love, Beth" [...] Despite this, some radio stations, such as Cities 97, play the song with the original lyric.|$|E

40|$|The primary design {{goal for}} this project is to interwork WLAN with UMTS and {{visualizing}} in 3 D network, {{so that it can}} be utilized as an <b>alternate</b> <b>radio</b> access network for defense system. Simulations and modeling have become a very important part of the process when designing communication networks. Only a real network, with real hardware will provide real results. General Dynamics C 4 Systems has been working collaboratively multiple routing protocol interaction. 3 D Network Visualizer (3 DNV) functionality lets you create three-dimensional animations based on topology information, node relationships, performance statistics, and terrain data. The OPNET Modeler is one of the most powerful simulation tools regarding communications. It is especially useful on R&D (research and development) areas for developers of communication devices and protocols. The network model must have a terrain database specified. The nodes to be animated must be mapped to specific shapes (called entities in 3 DNV) using a 3 DNV mapping library. Furthermore, a 3 D visualization of the entire network has been developed, representing both real and simulated nodes, including effects on their communications.

40|$|Recent {{research}} supports the eventual convergence of wireless LAN (WLAN) and cellular systems {{in order to}} achieve the IMT- 2000 (3 G) requirement for 2 Mbps indoor capacities. The WLAN access point can be enhanced to either incorporate or supplant the transmission and packet data capabilities in the cellular network. This research used OPNET ™ to design, implement, and test a network system level simulation environment to allow investigators to study the issues and trade-offs for interworking the infrastructure-based WLAN technologies into 3 G mobile subscriber cellular systems. The specific contribution of this research was to augment the current OPNET ™ model library by creating an enhanced user equipment node (UW) and an enhanced WLAN access point node (UWLAN_AP). The UW was augmented with the capability to selectively gain network access through either a UMTS Node-B or through a 3 G-aware WLAN access point. The UWLAN_AP was made 3 G-aware by augmenting it with the capability to process UMTS control messages in order to build an access control table to support UMTS authentication and access control. Together, the UW and UWLAN_AP create a simulation framework for interworking the WLAN technology into UMTS as an <b>alternate</b> <b>radio</b> access network for supporting “hot spots. ” This research is the foundation to allow investigators to identify signaling and data transfer mechanisms that leverage the capabilities of WLAN while supporting cellular service provisioning and accountability requirements for current and future systems. ii...|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: To create {{qualitative}} maps of cerebral {{blood flow}} (CBF) with the EPISTAR (echo-planar imaging and signal targeting with <b>alternating</b> <b>radio</b> frequency) technique. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The EPISTAR technique was performed in a pig model of hypercapnia and then tested in 26 volunteers by using various paradigms for cortical activation. Echo-planar images were acquired with and without use of a radio-frequency inversion pulse applied to inflowing arterial spins. A qualitative map of CBF was then created by subtracting the image obtained without the radio-frequency pulse from that obtained with the radio-frequency pulse. RESULTS: Progressively more distal portions of the tagged vessels were seen as the inflow time was lengthened until cortical enhancement was seen for inflow times of approximately 1 second or longer. Signal intensity increases from rest to sensorimotor activation ranged from 13 % to 193 %. CBF changes in the motor strip, primary visual cortex, and the motor area for eye movements were well localized to the cortical gray matter ribbon. CONCLUSION: The EPISTAR technique is a rapid, noninvasive means for creating qualitative maps of CBF...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—The high {{popularity}} of {{wireless sensor networks}} has led to novel applications with diverse, and sometimes demanding, data communication requirements, for example, streaming cam-era images in surveillance applications. In response bulk-data transfer protocols were proposed that provide low latency and high throughput communication over multiple hops. However, due to typical hardware platforms only providing a single radio, which implies that forwarding nodes need to serialize send and receive actions, the maximum end-to-end throughput is limited to 1 / 2 the radio capacity. To bridge this performance gap we present FastForward, a connection-oriented multi-hop bulk-data transfer protocol optimized for dual-radio platforms; data packets are sent across a path of <b>alternating</b> <b>radio</b> and frequency channels to exploit parallel transfers and avoid intra-path interference. We implemented FastForward in TinyOS to run on the Opal platform equipped with two IEEE 802. 15. 4 radios. In this paper we show that, with some minor tweaking of the original protocol stack to streamline internal access to the SPI bus, FastForward is capable of operating both radios in parallel so packets can be forwarded at full speed. We have evaluated FastForward on a 12 -node testbed in an office environment. The sustained throughput peaks around 23. 7 kBps, or 76 % of the radio capacity while the best single-radio protocol flattens out at 19 %. When introducing artificial packet loss the built-in link-level acknowledgements ensure that FastForward manages to deliver packets with high yield (close to 100 %) at the sink across 11 hops.

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the therapeutic mechanism of treating SMMC- 7721 liver cancer cells with magnetic fluid hyperthermia (MFH) using Fe 2 O 3 nanoparticles. Hepatocarcinoma SMMC- 7721 cells cultured in vitro were treated with ferrofluid containing Fe 2 O 3 nanoparticles and irradiated with an <b>alternating</b> <b>radio</b> frequency magnetic field. The influence of the treatment on the cells was examined by inverted microscopy, MTT and flow cytometry. To study the therapeutic mechanism of the Fe 2 O 3 MFH, Hsp 70, Bax, Bcl- 2 and p 53 were detected by immunocytochemistry and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). It was shown that Fe 2 O 3 MFH could cause cellular necrosis, induce cellular apoptosis, and significantly inhibit cellular growth, all of which appeared {{to be dependent on}} the concentration of the Fe 2 O 3 nanoparticles. Immunocytochemistry results showed that MFH could induce high expression of Hsp 70 and Bax, decrease the expression of mutant p 53, and had little effect on Bcl- 2. RT-PCR indicated that Hsp 70 expression was high in the early stage of MFH (< 24 h) and became low or absent after 24 h of MFH treatment. It can be concluded that Fe 2 O 3 MFH significantly inhibited the proliferation of in vitro cultured liver cancer cells (SMMC- 7721), induced cell apoptosis and arrested the cell cycle at the G 2 /M phase. Fe 2 O 3 MFH can induce high Hsp 70 expression at an early stage, enhance the expression of Bax, and decrease the expression of mutant p 53, which promotes the apoptosis of tumor cells...|$|R
