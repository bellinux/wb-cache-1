500|$|Finally, the minor, {{slightly}} bluish dots, {{flanking the}} <b>anthelion,</b> may be perfectly depicted 120° parhelia. These halos {{are produced by}} the same horizontally oriented ice crystals that produce sun dogs and the parhelic circle.

500|$|The {{white spot}} on the lower left part of the parhelic circle, {{opposite}} to the sun, should be an <b>anthelion,</b> a bright halo always located at the antisolar point. [...] Most scientists are convinced anthelia are caused by the convergence of several halo arcs (of which are no traces in the painting) and thus should not be regarded as an independent halo. [...] Other researchers believe column-shaped crystals could generate the phenomenon which could explain the constellation in the painting.|$|E
50|$|While the <b>anthelion</b> area {{is usually}} sparse on haloes, {{in a complex}} display it {{features}} various rare optic phenomena: Flanking the <b>anthelion</b> on the parhelic circle are two 120° parhelia (and two Liljequist parhelia) caused by plate crystals. The Tricker and diffuse arcs are produced in singly oriented column crystals and form an Ankh-like shape passing through the <b>anthelion.</b> Wegener arcs occasionally crosses the sky to converge in the <b>anthelion.</b>|$|E
50|$|How <b>anthelions</b> {{are formed}} is disputed. Walter Tape, among others, has argued {{they are not}} {{separate}} haloes, but simply where various haloes caused by horizontally oriented column-shaped ice crystals coincide on the parhelic circle to create a bright spot. If this theory is correct, anthelia should only appear together with these other haloes.|$|R
50|$|In {{the middle}} of 2008, <b>Anthelion</b> joined a {{compilation}} project of their record company, Ultimate Music. This compilation album included two songs from <b>Anthelion.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In 2003, bassist Edward joined <b>Anthelion,</b> {{replacing}} Jin, {{and along}} with new guitarist Chaos, <b>Anthelion</b> performed at the Spring Scream Festival [...] in Kenting, Taiwan, which was held in April of that year.|$|E
5000|$|In 2002, {{when the}} members of <b>Anthelion</b> were only 19 years old, they were {{for the first time}} invited to perform at a large music festival - Formoz Festival [...] - in Taiwan. In this year, <b>Anthelion</b> also {{performed}} at the Metal Immortal (金屬永生) concert in Taiwan, which was headlined by Dark Funeral. Following this, <b>Anthelion</b> were the opening act for ChthoniC's Relentless for 7 Years concert (冥誕七年演唱會).|$|E
5000|$|On 26 March 2004, <b>Anthelion</b> {{released}} {{their first}} independent EP Bloodstained <b>Anthelion</b> and toured Taiwan for one year, the last gig {{of the tour}} being at INVALI Festival [...] in 2005. Gradually, the band began {{to build up a}} fan base.|$|E
50|$|Meanwhile, <b>Anthelion</b> {{started using}} their {{self-built}} studio.|$|E

50|$|<b>Anthelion</b> are a Taiwanese symphonic {{black metal}} band. The current members are Code, Zeist, Troy and Siniz.|$|E
50|$|In the {{beginning}} of 2008, <b>Anthelion</b> were invited to perform at festivals in Bangkok, Thailand and Singapore.|$|E
50|$|In January 2009, <b>Anthelion</b> {{went back}} to the studio to prepare for the {{recording}} of their second album; however, bassist Ken decided to leave the band due to personal reasons. While searching for a new bassist, Anthelion's remaining members became busy living their own lives and doing other jobs, effectively alienating themselves from band affairs. <b>Anthelion</b> were facing their 'low tide', and the birth of the new album couldn't be foreseen.|$|E
5000|$|At {{the end of}} 2011, {{five years}} after their initial studio album, <b>Anthelion</b> started {{producing}} their second.Code: [...] "Every time we try to compose and make music, it's like we're challenging ourselves. Others would usually have different opinions about our stuff, yet our music is usually made {{in this kind of}} environment which is full of discussion and conflict. I think this kind of challenge is like searching for the 'Dao' of Anthelion; it can't be represented by any single existence. We had many conflicts and difficulties to conquer while producing this album, and you can imagine that if the 'Dao' is for a large group, it wouldn't just satisfy the thinking of the minority. But, doing things this way is what makes us determined. As long as you can digest and ponder over the lyrics and melodies, you will eventually find the song's soul deep at the bottom. That is surely the real <b>Anthelion.</b> Obsidian Plume will not be merely symbolic perfection for <b>Anthelion,</b> but you will see the real <b>Anthelion</b> through this album".|$|E
50|$|In June 2011, <b>Anthelion</b> began a ten-gig tour {{spanning}} from Hong Kong to Inner Mongolia, {{more than}} 3,000 kilometres across China.|$|E
50|$|At {{the end of}} 2009, Siniz was {{announced}} as the new bassist for <b>Anthelion.</b> This eliminated the low tide and drew the members together again.|$|E
5000|$|In March 2007, {{after putting}} {{a stop to}} all plans for one month, Troy and Zeist decided to ask Code to return to <b>Anthelion.</b> During the {{negotiations}} between band members, they {{received a letter from}} Studio Fredman confirming the exact schedule for recording, making them feel more determined to restart their recording plans. Luckily, they found their new bassist Ken at the same time. The new <b>Anthelion,</b> with four members, travelled to Studio Fredman in June, where Fredrik Nordstrom [...] recorded the album Bloodshed Rebefallen.|$|E
50|$|On 13 August 2010, <b>Anthelion</b> {{released}} the EP Manjusaka. In comparison to their older material, which {{tended to be}} impetuous, loud and violent, Manjusaka is gently dark and melancholic.|$|E
50|$|Cantelo {{began her}} three-year-old {{season in the}} Cheshire Oaks at Chester Racecourse in May. She won the race, a {{recognised}} trial for the Epsom Oaks by six lengths from <b>Anthelion.</b>|$|E
50|$|At {{the end of}} 2007, <b>Anthelion</b> started touring other {{countries}} in Asia, including the Kantou and Kansai regions in Japan (Tokyo, Nagoya, Osaka, Kyoto, and Kobe for six gigs in five cities).|$|E
50|$|In {{the spring}} of 2010, <b>Anthelion</b> {{commenced}} recording their new songs and resolved to write music more magniloquent than Bloodshed Rebefallen as they wanted to demonstrate a different atmosphere within their new material.|$|E
50|$|In February 2007, Chaos, Edward {{and main}} {{composer}} Code decided to depart the band, leaving the remaining members Troy and Zeist confused {{about the future}} of <b>Anthelion,</b> eventually forcing them to announce their disbandment.|$|E
5000|$|An <b>anthelion</b> (plural anthelia, {{from late}} Greek ανθηλιος, [...] "opposite the sun") {{is a rare}} optical {{phenomenon}} appearing on the parhelic circle opposite to the sun as a faint white halo, not unlike a sundog.|$|E
50|$|At {{the end of}} 2008, <b>Anthelion</b> {{performed}} at Ultimate Metal Festival, organised by Ultimate Music, which included more than ten bands from seven countries performing in Taiwan. This was also the end of Anthelion's Asian tour.|$|E
50|$|<b>Anthelion</b> {{was founded}} by members Code, Zeist, Troy and Jin in Keelung, Taiwan in 2001. Three months later, they {{released}} their first demo containing three songs pertaining to the band's original melodic, black metal inspired sound.|$|E
50|$|A Liljequist parhelion {{is a rare}} halo, {{an optical}} {{phenomenon}} {{in the form of}} a brightened spot on the parhelic circle approximately 150-160° from the sun; i.e., between the position of the 120° parhelion and the <b>anthelion.</b>|$|E
50|$|Finally, the minor, {{slightly}} bluish dots, {{flanking the}} <b>anthelion,</b> may be perfectly depicted 120° parhelia. These halos {{are produced by}} the same horizontally oriented ice crystals that produce sun dogs and the parhelic circle. They result from multiple interior reflections of sun rays entering the hexagonal top face and leaving through the bottom face.|$|E
50|$|In 2005 <b>Anthelion</b> {{were invited}} to be guests on the popular Taiwanese talk show Kang Xi Lai Le, and {{although}} this created the opportunity {{for them to be}} exposed to a wider audience, the reckoning of some people that black metal should be something dark and serious created mixed opinions about the appearance among fans.|$|E
50|$|Miskimon {{was part}} of a {{movement}} in San Francisco to establish an alternative book publishing outlet for West Coast authors in the 1970s with publication of his first novel, A Wind Is Rising, in 1976 by <b>Anthelion</b> Press of San Francisco. It {{is the story of a}} small community on the California coast that galvanizes to defeat a huge commercial development proposed by out-of-state interests.|$|E
5000|$|... {{where the}} {{refractive}} index [...] {{to use for}} the angle [...] of total internal reflection is Bravais' index for inclined rays, i.e. [...] for a solar elevation [...] For ice at zero solar elevation this angle is [...] The dispersion of ice causes a variation of this angle, leading to a blueish/cyan coloring close to this azimuthal coordinate. The halo ends towards the <b>anthelion</b> at an angle ...|$|E
50|$|As well as {{the true}} sun, two mock suns (parhelia) and an <b>anthelion</b> were seen, with halos at 22° and 46°, and topped with an upper tangent arc and a {{circumzenithal}} arc, respectively. Of particular interest to modern scientists were the mention of three further mock suns, one {{at the intersection of}} the 22° halo and the upper tangent arc, and two others at 90* to the sun, also at the intersections of an immense but incomplete halo.|$|E
50|$|The {{white spot}} on the lower left part of the parhelic circle, {{opposite}} to the sun, should be an <b>anthelion,</b> a bright halo always located at the antisolar point. Most scientists are convinced anthelia are caused by the convergence of several halo arcs (of which are no traces in the painting) and thus should not be regarded as an independent halo. Other researchers believe column-shaped crystals could generate the phenomenon which could explain the constellation in the painting.|$|E
50|$|The anthelic {{point is}} often used as a synonym for the antisolar point, but the two should be differentiated.While the antisolar point is {{directly}} opposite the sun, always below the horizon {{when the sun is}} up, the anthelic point is opposite but at the same elevation as the sun, and is therefore located on the parhelic circle. There are several halo phenomena that are centered on or converge on the anthelic point, such as the <b>anthelion,</b> Wegener arcs, Tricker arcs and the parhelic circle itself.|$|E
