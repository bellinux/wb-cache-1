5|$|A further four {{conversions}} to push-pull capability appeared between 1960–62. This was {{the result}} of short-framed M7s having long frames substituted during overhaul in order to create room for the <b>air</b> <b>compressor.</b>|$|E
5|$|Compressor diving is a {{rudimentary}} method of surface-supplied diving {{used in some}} tropical regions such as the Philippines and the Caribbean. The divers swim with a half mask and fins and are supplied with air from an industrial low-pressure <b>air</b> <b>compressor</b> on the boat through plastic tubes. There is no reduction valve; the diver holds the hose end in his mouth with no demand valve or mouthpiece and allows excess air to spill out between the lips.|$|E
5|$|The pulley {{system was}} {{eventually}} deemed unsafe due to instances of sagging and delayed reaction. As a result, it was replaced on 36engines by a safer {{compressed air system}} between 1930 and 1937. This system had seen previous successful use on the LBSCR. Because the <b>air</b> <b>compressor</b> required extra space for installation, these conversions were confined to the long-framed members of the class.|$|E

5|$|Breathing {{air supply}} can come {{directly}} from a high-pressure breathing <b>air</b> <b>compressor,</b> from a high-pressure storage system, or from a combined storage system with compressor. Direct charging is energy intensive, and the charge rate will be limited by the available power source and capacity of the compressor. A large-volume bank of high-pressure storage cylinders allows faster charging or simultaneous charging of multiple cylinders, and allows for provision of more economical high-pressure air by recharging the storage banks from a low-power compressor, or using lower cost off-peak electrical power.|$|E
25|$|Stations {{typically}} have an <b>air</b> <b>compressor</b> (some {{with a built-in}} or provided handheld tire-pressure gauge) to inflate tires and a hose to add water to vehicle radiators. Some <b>air</b> <b>compressor</b> machines are free of charge, while others charge a small fee to use (typically 50 cents to a dollar in North America). In many U.S. states, state law requires that paying customers must be provided with free <b>air</b> <b>compressor</b> service. In most cases, a token provided by the attendant is used in lieu of coins.|$|E
