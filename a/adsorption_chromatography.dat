2500|$|Liquid {{chromatography}} is {{a method}} of physical separation in which the components of a liquid mixture are distributed between two immiscible phases, i.e., stationary and mobile. The practice of LC {{can be divided into}} five categories, i.e., <b>adsorption</b> <b>chromatography,</b> partition chromatography, ion-exchange chromatography, size-exclusion chromatography, and affinity chromatography. Among these, the most widely used variant is the reverse-phase (RP) mode of the partition chromatography technique, which makes use of a non-polar (hydrophobic) stationary phase and a polar mobile phase. [...] In common applications, the mobile phase is a mixture of water and other polar solvents (e.g., methanol, isopropanol, and acetonitrile), and the stationary matrix is prepared by attaching long-chain alkyl groups (e.g., n-octadecyl or C18) to the surface of [...] irregularly or spherically shaped 5 μm diameter silica particles.|$|E
