Duplicates also had to be made, for Maya Stojan and Wen's two stunt doubles. She explained that she [...] "decided to do a wrap dress so that [...] could easily dance. It already had a slit sort of built into it, so that gave her freedom of movement. [...] goal is always {{to make sure that}} the actors are comfortable in their costumes, that they can move freely and do their stunts, and that nothing is too restrictive. And that they also look amazing at the same time." [...] The dress also [...] "needed long sleeves so that [...] could have pads on underneath the dress for when she was fighting. <b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>of</b> <b>course</b> she's got the crazy fight where she's fighting herself...she needed serious freedom of movement in that dress, so we built panels that had stretch, and put them in several areas on her arms and her sides, so that it moved with her as she punched...herself." ...|$|E

She then made the necessary pronunciation corrections on the album. In an interview with MTV, Madonna recalled the recording of the album, and said her business partner Guy Oseary was a helpful friend, and that after she and Orbit played him the tracks, he, to their dismay, said nothing and left the studio. [...] "He really hates those icy strings. Right when I think the track's done, he sort of pushes us another step further. 'Maybe we should try this', or 'I really don't want to hear that'. <b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> later on, it creeps in my brain, and I'm like, 'maybe I should have done a background vocal on that'. And then she comes in and happily does it, right?", Madonna said. Orbit also recalled during an interview with Q magazine that Madonna recorded [...] "Swim" [...] the day her friend and fashion designer Gianni Versace was killed in Miami, Florida. He also commented that this is probably why the track has an emotional impact.|$|E

500|$|The shipwrecks continued, nonetheless, {{with one}} of the most {{profitable}} of all being the 1931 wreck of the 6,000-ton Danish freighter Pennsylvania on the neighbouring island of Swona. The vessel was plundered by the inhabitants of Stroma, Swona and South Ronaldsay. Much of her cargo of slot machines, spark plugs, clothing, tobacco, watches and car parts was looted and concealed in haystacks, oatfields, lochs and caves. David Stogdon, a lifeboatman, recalled seeing what the islanders did with their illicit salvage: [...] "Every house was stuffed with wreck ... clocks, telescopes, binnacles... I seem to remember enormous dining-room tables in small cottages. <b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>of</b> <b>course</b> from time to time they'd have cargo parts of lorries or something like that which could be put together to make a lorry and taken ashore on two or three fishing boats in calm weather. They'd land it quietly somewhere, drive it along and sell it." [...] Customs officers, policemen, coastguards and Receivers of Wreck were not generally welcome – the island had no police force – and the islanders let it be understood that unfortunate things could happen to the boats of unwanted visitors: [...] "Police boats could go missing, develop an unexpected leak or spontaneously combust." [...] The area still presents hazards to passing ships; in January 1993, the Danish coaster Bettina Danica ran aground off the southern end of Stroma. The wreck was broken apart by the action of the sea in 1997 and only her stern section is still visible.|$|E
500|$|Diamond Rio {{released}} its twenty-third official chart single, [...] "Stuff", in May 2000. The song was {{originally intended to}} be the title track to their sixth studio album, {{which would have been}} released on August 22 of the same year, but according to Truman, [...] "Certain radio stations, for some reason, didn't want to play 'Stuff'." [...] As a result, [...] "Stuff" [...] was withdrawn after peaking at number 36 on the country charts, and the album was delayed until February 2001. Following this song's failure, the band released [...] "One More Day" [...] later in 2000. The song was written by Steven Dale Jones and Bobby Tomberlin, the same two writers who wrote [...] "She Misses Him on Sunday the Most". [...] "One More Day" [...] went on to spend two non-consecutive weeks at No.1 on the country charts, with the album, by this point re-titled One More Day, having its release date moved up to February 6, 2001. The song also peaked at No.29 on the Billboard Hot 100, in addition to reaching top 10 on the Adult Contemporary charts (the band's first appearance on that chart). Regarding the song's popularity among fans who have used the song to cope with personal losses, Prout said, [...] "Actually, 'One More Day' was recorded as a love song. Then one of Oklahoma State's basketball team's plane went down, then in early 2001 we lost Dale [...] in Daytona, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> 9/11 came after that. And every event of that year, the song took on a different meaning to different people... We hear quite often in e-mails and people talking to us in shows. If you're asking how it makes us feel? Pretty darn special... to know that you had that impact on someone's life and helped in a tough time of healing and hope." ...|$|E

[...] It is noteworthy that Devereux Emmet, the designer of Mohawk Golf Club, was the first golfer of note to be shown Mr. Knight's new aluminum putter while he was visiting Mohawk. [...] Emmet asked to take the putter with him back to his home course, Garden City Golf Club, where he proposed to [...] "play with it, show it at Garden City and at Myopia and will then send it back to you". It is reported that [...] "A day or two later Mr. Knight received a telegram from Mr. W. J. Travis ordering a putter like Mr. Emmet's, and one was hurriedly made and forwarded". Later, a second putter was sent to Travis which was declared [...] "the best putter I have ever used." [...] Travis used this putter to finish second in the U.S. Open Championship held at Garden City Golf Club. [...] "Within a week thereafter, Mr. Knight received over one hundred letters from prominent golfers asking for a putter like Mr. Travis's". [...] Knight was not prepared for such a response and was particularly concerned about what to call it. [...] It is reported that he was [...] "anxious to call it the 'Travis' putter'." [...] He arranged a meeting with Mr. Emmet and Mr. Travis. [...] Emmet had consistently referred to it as the [...] "Schenectady Putter" [...] and Travis agreed that Schenectady would be [...] "a more suitable and lasting name for the putter than his own, in which view Mr. Knight rather reluctantly concurred." [...] After his initial success with the Schenectady Putter in 1902, Travis used the putter to win the 1903 U.S. Amateur <b>and</b> <b>then,</b> <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> the 1904 British Amateur.
