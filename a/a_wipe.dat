25|$|The Artois Hound {{does not}} require a large amount of grooming. The Artois' smooth {{short-haired}} coat is easy to look after. Owners will simply want to make sure the coat is brushed on a consistent basis. These dogs should only be given baths when they need it. <b>A</b> <b>wipe</b> down with a damp towel should suffice for the bathing aspect, (although you should bathe it with mild soap only if or when necessary; you should also dry shampoo it occasionally), however a rubber, wire, or hard bristled brush would work best for the brushing aspect.The shedding patterns of these dogs are not known. Be sure to check the ears carefully for signs of infection. The nails of the D'Artois should also be trimmed, (particularly to avoid nail-born infections).|$|E
2500|$|The pax was {{an object}} {{used in the}} Middle Ages and Renaissance for the Kiss of Peace in the Catholic Mass. [...] Direct kissing among the celebrants and {{congregation}} was replaced by each in turn kissing the pax, which was carried around to those present. [...] The form of the pax was variable but normally included a flat surface to be kissed. [...] Often the pax was held out with a long handle attached, {{and it seems to}} have been given <b>a</b> <b>wipe</b> with a cloth between each person. Some paxes are very elaborate and expensive objects, and most survivals fall into this class, but the great majority were probably very simple wood or brass pieces. It was usual to include an image, usually of or including the Virgin Mary or Jesus Christ.|$|E

50|$|Ziba's {{designers}} {{determined that}} the traditional T-shape of a squeegee was not the most efficient for <b>a</b> <b>wiping</b> motion in <b>a</b> confined area such as a shower stall. After researching the way window washers and filling-station attendants would put their hands close to the blade and rarely use the handle, Ziba designed a plastic squeegee without a traditional handle; instead, it had a tubular rubber grip running parallel to curved twin blades, which moves across glass or mirrors with <b>a</b> <b>wiping</b> motion to reduce strain to the hand and wrist. The dual blades leave a surface cleaner than a single blade squeegee.|$|R

50|$|Lead burning is {{not used}} as part of {{plumbing}} work for installed pipework. Lead piping has long been considered obsolete, owing to the health aspects.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{a strategy}} {{by which a}} robotic hand can use the physical properties of a fabric to pinch the fabric. Pinching may be accomplished by using <b>a</b> <b>wiping</b> motion, during which the movement and deformation of a deformable object occur simultaneously. The wiping motion differs from the displacement of a deformable object. During the wiping motion, there is contact, but no relative movement, between the manipulator and the object, whereas, during displacement, there is both contact and relative movement between the object and the floor. This paper first describes wiping motion and distinguishes wiping slide from wiping deformation by displacement of the internal points of <b>an</b> object. <b>Wiping</b> motion is also shown to be an extended scheme of pushing and sliding of rigid objects. Our strategy for pinching a fabric is accomplished with <b>a</b> combination of <b>wiping</b> deformation and residual deformation of the fabric under unloaded conditions. Using this strategy, a single-armed robotic hand can pinch both surfaces of the fabric without handover motion...|$|R
