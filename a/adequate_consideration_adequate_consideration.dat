40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine how the number of {{cultural}} remains, the area of the final felling site and the forest owner’s knowledge, attitude and behavior related to the consideration taken to cultural environments. The study was built upon results from the HK-inventory as well as qualitative interviews with seven forest owners.   The results indicated that the risk of negative impact increased when two or more cultural remains were located at the felling site. Felling sites where two or more cultural remains had been affected and where at least one of these remains was affected negatively, were also larger than those sites where <b>adequate</b> <b>consideration</b> had been taken. Furthermore, the forest owner’s knowledge and attitude could have an effect on his or her behavior in regards to cultural consideration.   Larger felling sites that affect two or more cultural remains should be extra monitored before and during felling procedures to ensure <b>adequate</b> <b>consideration</b> towards cultural environments located at the site. Forest owners can probably have an influence on consideration but need more knowledge about different types of cultural environments and how to act to achieve <b>adequate</b> <b>consideration</b> towards cultural environments in general...|$|R
50|$|Directors {{have a duty}} not {{to waste}} {{corporate}} assets by overpaying for property or employment services. Thus the definition of waste is an exchange so one-sided that no business person of ordinary, sound judgment could conclude the corporation has received <b>adequate</b> <b>consideration.</b> This is difficult to prove {{in a court of}} law.|$|R

40|$|This article {{discusses}} {{the appropriateness of}} western bioethics in the African setting. It focuses on the decision-making process regarding participation in health research as a contested boundary in international bioethics discourse. An ethnomethodological approach is used to explain African ethics, and African ethic {{is applied to the}} decision-making process in the African community. An HIV/AIDS surveillance project is used as a case study to explore the concept of communitarianism. The article argues that what exists in Africa is communal or social autonomy as opposed to individual autonomy in the West. As a result, applying the western concept of autonomy to research involving human subjects in the African context without <b>adequate</b> <b>consideration</b> for the important role of the community is inappropriate. It concludes that lack of <b>adequate</b> <b>consideration</b> for community participation in health research involving human subjects in Africa will prevent proper management and lack truly informed consent...|$|R

40|$|Effectivo {{action in}} {{educational}} development {{is dependent upon}} an <b>adequate</b> <b>consideration</b> of requisite variety. An <b>adequate</b> <b>consideration</b> of requisite variety includes a delineation of the information field appropriate for the decisionmaking system. An interaction of the information domain with each state of development,. state-set, and whole would enhance decidability. The evaluation of an educational system qua organization requires the delineation, procurement, and provision of information for tho reduction of uncertainty in decisionmaking. The theoretical basis for the evaluation model derives from a self-organizing meta-structure of ontogenetic pragmatics. The self-organizing meta-structure includes a supra-ordinate stabilization of syntax and semantics. Two subordinate stabilizations of completability-consistency and controllability-observability are embedded, in the self-organizing stabilization. The ontogenetic pragmatics include a stabilization of syntal elements and synergistic relationships in the pragmatic functions of the organization. The pragmatic functions may include policymaking, needs assessment, planning, program development, program implementation, program evaluation, management information system resource management, and environmental relations. The purpose of the evaluation is to facilitate the improvement of gel:eral systems decisions in educational development. (Author...|$|R
30|$|However, it is {{currently}} not clear whether and how transport logistics hubs are considered in transport demand models. Do models in application integrate these hubs adequately and, if not, what are the remaining challenges for an <b>adequate</b> <b>consideration</b> then? Thus, the scholarly contribution of the paper is to show how these special types of hubs (transport logistics hubs) are currently integrated in freight transport demand models in application and to discuss remaining gaps and challenges.|$|R

It will be <b>adequate</b> <b>consideration</b> where what is given is more than could have been expected from performance of the existing duty, where in fact something extra is added to what the claimant is already bound to do. The extra element is the consideration for the new promise. This principle will apply where public duty is exceeded as seen in this case.|$|R

40|$|Illinois {{courts have}} long dealt with whether {{restrictive}} covenants, specifically non-compete clauses, {{can and should}} be enforced when they involve employees of businesses. Many aspects of restrictive covenants have been litigated, but a recent Illinois Appellate Court case analyzed the issue of what is <b>adequate</b> <b>consideration</b> in order to enforce a restrictive covenant against a former employee. The First District in Fifield v. Premier Dealer Services, Inc., affirmed a bright-line, two-year rule for deciding how long an employee must work for an employer before a re-strictive covenant can be enforced. The two-year rule protects employees because an employer cannot require them to sign a non-compete and then terminate their employment the next day. However, the two-year rule does not adequately take into account the employer’s standpoint because an employee could voluntarily resign one day short of two years of employment and the restrictive covenant would be void. This note analyzes the bright-line, two-year rule in Illinois for <b>adequate</b> <b>consideration</b> and shows its development over time; it looks to how other states have tried to solve this very problem; and it discusses how the problem in Illinois could be fixed either through legislative or judicial change...|$|R

In the troubles of 1797 and 1798 he enrolled himself as a private in the Belfast Merchants' Infantry, sent his family to Whitehaven, and continued to preach; {{many of the more}} liberal Presbyterians had been in favour of the Irish Rebellion of 1798.

50|$|A {{study done}} at the University of Oregon found that prototypical averages {{are more likely to}} be {{forgotten}} than many specific examples. Relying only on prototypes does not allow for <b>adequate</b> <b>consideration</b> while relying only on examples can be inefficient. Exemplar theory is more flexible than prototype theory but less economical, a combination of the two balances the flexibility with the efficiency. Experience with various examples averages into an ever changing, more accurate prototype - it is not that exemplar theory and prototype theory compete against each other but that they work together, in tandem.|$|R
50|$|Following {{the debate}} and {{consideration}} of the Bill and any Stage 3 amendments, the Parliament may opt to send the Bill back to Stage 2 for further consideration. However, if it is felt that <b>adequate</b> <b>consideration</b> has already been had, the Parliament will vote on whether to pass the Bill. If the Bill does not receive a majority in-favour votes, or if the vote is invalid, the Bill fails and does not proceed. The vote is considered invalid when an electronic vote is taken and fewer {{than a quarter of}} (129 total) MSPs vote.|$|R

It is imposed on the estate, not the beneficiary. Some states impose an inheritance tax on recipients of bequests. Gift taxes are levied on the giver (donor) of property where the property is transferred for less than <b>adequate</b> <b>consideration.</b> An additional generation-skipping transfer (GST) tax is imposed by the federal and some state governments on transfers to grandchildren (or their descendants).|$|R

The conventional Risk Management Process (RMP) manages risks from a single party perspective, which does not give <b>adequate</b> <b>consideration</b> to the needs of others. The objective of multi-party risk management is to assist decision-makers in managing risk systematically and most efficiently in a multi-party environment. Multi-party Risk Management Processes (MRMP) consist of risk identification, structuring, analysis and developing responses from all party perspectives. The MRMP has been applied to a cement plant construction project in Thailand to demonstrate its effectiveness...|$|R
40|$|Fire {{accidents}} in underground transportation systems, e. g., tunnels and underground stations, can cause many fatalities. It is therefore important in fire safety design to give <b>adequate</b> <b>consideration</b> to all aspects related to evacuation. The paper provides {{a review of}} two previously reported fire accidents based on a theoretical framework, namely four accepted human behaviour theories. These theories provide qualitative guidance on human behaviour {{in the event of}} fire in underground transportation systems, and it is therefore argued {{that they need to be}} considered in the fire safety design of these facilities...|$|R
40|$|This paper reviews {{existing}} literatures on {{the analysis}} of performance appraisal (PA) paying special attention to those which try {{to take into account}} the “social context” of appraisal systems and processes. The special place of political action within these processes is underlined and the different levels at which politics need to be considered in research are outlined. Research on politics is considered and shown to lack an <b>adequate</b> <b>consideration</b> of the social relations involved in the reciprocal interactions between PA tools and processes and users interpretation and manipulation of them.

This question proves {{to be determined by}} a complex constellation of historical, philosophical, theological and political issues. In an attempt to give a systematic analysis and evaluation of these issues a brief historical description of the relationship between theology and university is given and the basic characteristics of a university and theology identified.

40|$|The {{consideration}} of minority opinions when making team decisions {{is an important}} factor that contributes to team effectiveness. A multilevel model of minority opinion influence in decision-making teams is developed to address the conditions that relate to <b>adequate</b> <b>consideration</b> of minority opinions. Using a sample of 57 teams working on a simulated airport security-screening task, we demonstrate that team learning goal orientation influences the confidence of minority opinion holders and team discussion. Team discussion, in turn, relates to minority influence, greater decision quality, and team satisfaction. Implications for managing decision-making teams in organizations are discussed...|$|R
