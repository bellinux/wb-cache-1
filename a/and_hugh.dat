5|$|Countershading, like counter-illumination, {{has rarely}} been applied in {{practice}} for military camouflage, though not because military authorities were unaware of it. Both Abbott Thayer in the First World War <b>and</b> <b>Hugh</b> Cott in the Second World War proposed countershading to their countries' armed forces. They each demonstrated the effectiveness of countershading, without succeeding in persuading their armed forces to adopt the technique, though they influenced military adoption of camouflage in general.|$|E
5000|$|Further {{evidence}} supporting the knowledge gap hypothesis came from Star <b>and</b> <b>Hughes</b> (1950) [...] analysis {{of efforts to}} inform Cincinnati adults about the United Nations. Like Gray and Munroe (1929) [...] and Lazarsfeld (1940) [...] before them, Star <b>and</b> <b>Hughes</b> found that while the campaign was successful in reaching better-educated people, those with less education virtually ignored the campaign. Additionally, after realizing that the highly educated people reached by the campaign also {{tended to be more}} interested in the topic, Star <b>and</b> <b>Hughes</b> suggested that knowledge, education, and interest may be interdependent.|$|R

5|$|In August 1834, George Mackenzie died of cholera. With his supervising lawyer dead, Macdonald {{remained}} at the cousin's law office in Hallowell (today Picton, Ontario). In 1835, Macdonald returned to Kingston, and even though not yet of age nor qualified, began his practice as a lawyer, hoping to gain his former employer's clients. Macdonald's parents and sisters also returned to Kingston, <b>and</b> <b>Hugh</b> Macdonald became a bank clerk.|$|E
5|$|It {{was while}} Roger was Theobald's clerk {{that he made}} lasting friendships with Gilbert Foliot <b>and</b> <b>Hugh</b> de Puiset. Roger {{attended}} the Council of Reims in 1148 with Theobald, John of Salisbury, and possibly Thomas Becket. This council condemned some of Gilbert de la Porrée's teachings, and consecrated Foliot as Bishop of Hereford. While it was later recalled that Roger and Becket did not get along, {{there is no evidence}} of hatred between the two before the Becket crisis happened.|$|E

5|$|Jocelin <b>and</b> <b>Hugh</b> were {{in exile}} {{together}} in Bordeaux in 1212, {{but they both}} returned to England in May 1213, {{along with the other}} English bishops.

In 1215, Jocelin sided with Stephen Langton and the barons, and Magna Charta lists Jocelin as one of the king's councillors.|$|E
5|$|The Seventh Victim is a 1943 American horror {{film noir}} {{directed}} by Mark Robson and starring Tom Conway, Jean Brooks, Isabel Jewell, Kim Hunter, <b>and</b> <b>Hugh</b> Beaumont.

It marks Robson's directorial debut and was Hunter's first onscreen role.|$|E

He was introduced by his father to the television producer Matthew Robinson, who mentored Hooper and gave him his first television directing work. For Robinson, Hooper directed episodes of the short-lived Tyne Tees Television soap opera Quayside in 1997, four episodes of the Children's BBC television series Byker Grove in the same year, and his first episodes of the BBC One soap opera EastEnders in 1998.|$|E

5|$|Among the crusaders in the Crusade of 1101 were Stephen II, Count of Blois <b>and</b> <b>Hugh</b> of Vermandois, both of {{whom had}} {{returned}} home before reaching Jerusalem. This crusade was almost annihilated in Asia Minor by the Seljuqs, but the survivors helped to reinforce the kingdom upon their arrival in Jerusalem. In the following years, assistance was also provided by Italian merchants who established themselves in Syrian ports, and from the religious and military orders of the Knights Templar and the Knights Hospitaller, which were created during Baldwin I's reign.|$|E
5|$|As the {{political}} conflict escalated into full-scale rebellion in 1321–22, Edmund {{played an important}} role in its suppression. The opposition stemmed from resentment against the king's new favourites, Hugh Despenser the Younger <b>and</b> <b>Hugh</b> Despenser the Elder. When Bartholomew Badlesmere, steward of the royal household, defected to the opposition, Edward made his youngest brother Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports in place of Badlesmere on 16 June. In the parliament of July 1321, Edmund briefly sided with the opposition when he agreed to exile the Despensers, but later claimed this had been done under duress, and in November sat on the council that annulled the exile.|$|E
5|$|At 21:00, the British moved out. No one {{except the}} commanders {{knew of the}} plan. Clinton led a crack brigade of light {{infantry}} with fixed bayonets in front, followed by Cornwallis who had eight battalions and 14 artillery pieces. Cornwallis was followed by Howe <b>and</b> <b>Hugh</b> Percy with six battalions, more artillery, and baggage. The column consisted of 10,000 men who stretched out over two miles. Three Loyalist farmers led the column toward the Jamaica Pass. The British had left their campfires burning to deceive the Americans into thinking that nothing was happening. The column headed northeast until it reached what later became the village of New Lots, when it headed directly north toward the heights.|$|E

5|$|During the 1893season, Stivetts {{involved}} {{himself in}} a dispute between two catholic players, Tommy Tucker <b>and</b> <b>Hugh</b> Duffy, and their manager Frank Selee. The resulting rift occasionally caused strife among team members. Factions formed, with Duffy, Tucker, and Tommy McCarthy on one side; Herman Long, Bobby Lowe, and Stivetts on the other. These disagreements, in part, led to an incident in a Louisville, Kentucky hotel dining room between Stivetts and McCarthy. In response to something Stivetts had said, McCarthy retaliated by punching him once {{in the face and}} then calmly left the restaurant.|$|E
5|$|Edward's {{authority}} {{collapsed in}} England where, in the King's absence, Isabella's faction {{took over the}} administration {{with the support of}} the Church. Her forces surrounded Bristol, where Hugh Despenser the Elder had taken shelter; he surrendered and was promptly executed. Edward <b>and</b> <b>Hugh</b> the Younger fled their castle around 2 November, leaving behind jewellery, considerable supplies and at least £13,000 in cash, possibly once again hoping to reach Ireland, but on 16 November they were betrayed and captured by a search party north of Caerphilly. Edward was escorted first to Monmouth Castle, and from there back into England, where he was held at Henry of Lancaster's fortress at Kenilworth. The King's final remaining forces, by now besieged in Caerphilly Castle, surrendered after five months in April 1327.|$|E
