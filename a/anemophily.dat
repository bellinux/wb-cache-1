5|$|Wind {{dispersal}} of seeds, or anemochory, {{is one of}} the more primitive means of dispersal. Wind dispersal can take on one of two primary forms: seeds can float on the breeze or alternatively, they can flutter to the ground. The classic examples of these dispersal mechanisms include dandelions (Taraxacum spp., Asteraceae), which have a feathery pappus attached to their seeds and can be dispersed long distances, and maples (Acer (genus) spp., Sapindaceae), which have winged seeds and flutter to the ground. An important constraint on wind dispersal is the need for abundant seed production to maximize the likelihood of a seed landing in a site suitable for germination. There are also strong evolutionary constraints on this dispersal mechanism. For instance, species in the Asteraceae on islands tended to have reduced dispersal capabilities (i.e., larger seed mass and smaller pappus) relative to the same species on the mainland. Reliance upon wind dispersal is common among many weedy or ruderal species. Unusual mechanisms of wind dispersal include tumbleweeds. A related process to anemochory is <b>anemophily,</b> which is the process where pollen is distributed by wind. Large families of plants are pollinated in this manner, which is favored when individuals of the dominant plant species are spaced closely together.|$|E

50|$|D. viscosa is a shrub {{growing to}} 1 - 3 m tall, rarely a small tree to 9 m tall. The leaves are {{variable}} in shape: generally obovate {{but some of}} them are lanceolate, often sessile, 4 - 7.5 cm long and 1 - 1.5 cm broad, alternate in arrangement, and secrete a resinous substance. Many specimens have a pointed or rounded apex. Leaf base is extended. Leaf texture is leathery, tough, but also pliable. Midribs are medium becoming less visible close to the apex. Secondary veins are thin, generally indistinct; Veins: often 6 to 10 pairs, indifferently opposite, subopposite, and alternate, camptodrome. Venation branches from the midrib at different angles, which may vary from 12° to 70°. The basal veins are very ascending in some plants: the angle of divergence may be close to 45°. The basal secondary venation branches from a point near the base of the main vein and becomes parallel with the leaf margin, with the distance of 1 millimeter to 2 millimeters from the edges. Margins are usually toothed or undulating. The remaining secondary veins lay at regular intervals with flowers usually growing at the branches’ ends. The flowers are yellow to orange-red and produced in panicles about 2.5 cm in length. The flowers may be only male or female ones, and one plant bears either male or female flowers. However, sometimes they are observed to bear flowers of both sexes. The pollen is transported by <b>anemophily.</b> It is believed that D. viscosa flowers lack petals during evolution to increase exposure to the wind. The fruit is a capsule 1.5 cm broad, red ripening brown, with two to four wings.|$|E
40|$|Caesalpinia crista L., commanly {{known as}} Gray Nicker, is an {{oligohaline}} mangrove associate confined to landward marginal {{areas of the}} Coringa Mangrove Forest, Andhra Pradesh, India. The flowering occurs during the wet season from June to November. The flowers are hermaphroditic, self-compatible and exhibit a mixed breeding system. The floral characteristics that constitute melittophilous pollination syndrome include diurnal anthesis, slight fragrance, zygomorphy, yellow petals, with a flag petal displaying a conspicuous nectar guide, {{and the presence of}} nectar with a high sugar concentration. Extra-floral nectar along the rachis is an additional attractant and is easily perceivable by bees. The plant is pollinated almost exclusively by bees, especially carpenter bees. The floral characteristics such as free petals, fully exposed stamens with dry and powdery pollen grains and hairy stigma facilitate <b>anemophily</b> which is effective due to high winds during the rainy season. The prolific growth and near synchronous flowering at population level contribute to pollen availability in huge quantities and enable <b>anemophily</b> as an effective mode of pollination. The functionality of melittophily and <b>anemophily</b> together constitutes ambophily. Hand-pollination experiments indicated that the plant is principally out-crossing. The natural fruit set does not exceed 10 %; this lowest percentage could be partly due to flower-feeding by the beetle, Mylabris phalerata. The fruits are indehiscent, 1 -seeded, which are buoyant and are not dispersed far away from the parental sites. The viable seeds produce new plants in the vicinity of parental plants during the rainy season. This plant builds up its population as small patches or in pure stands and hence is important in building landward mangrove cover...|$|E

Due to the stochastic and complex nature of <b>anemophily,</b> modelling the dispersal {{patterns of the}} pollen and seeds of wind pollinated plants {{is not an easy}} task. The majority of the existing dispersal models are varied and have many conflicting predictions of pollen dispersal distances and concentrations from a source.

The main objective {{of this study was to}} measure ambient pollen concentrations of various tree and shrub species at both short and long distances from the source. A secondary objective was to measure the parameters involved in the dispersal process of anemophilous pollen and subsequently use these parameters and the empirical data collected to test the accuracy of three analytical mechanistic models of pollen and seed dispersal. The applications of such models are extensive; besides being of use to the allergy-suffering population, present-day issues such as climate change, pollen contamination in GMO crops, and landscape fragmentation raise concerns about whether plants will be able to adapt, disperse, and reproduce effectively in such rapidly changing environments...|$|E

40|$|Rhizophora mangle is {{considered}} as a self-compatible mangrove, and is pollinated by wind and insects. However, there is no information about fruit production by autogamy and agamospermy and on the foraging behavior of its flower visitors. Hence, the present study analyzed the pollination and reproductive systems of R. mangle in a mangrove community in northern Pernambuco, Brazil. Floral morphology, sequence of anthesis, and behavior of flower visitors were described; the proportion of flowers that resulted in mature propagules was also recorded. Autogamy, agamospermy, and wind pollination tests were performed, and a new <b>anemophily</b> index is proposed. The flowers of R. mangle are hermaphrodite, protandric, and have high P/O rate. Flies were observed on flowers only during the male phase, probably feeding on mites that consume pollen. Rhizophora mangle is not agamospermic and its fruit production rate by spontaneous self-pollination is low (2. 56 %) compared to wind pollination (19. 44 %). The <b>anemophily</b> index was high 0. 98, and thus it was {{considered as a}} good indicator. Only 13. 79 % of the flowers formed mature propagules.

40|$|During the {{monitoring}} of populations of Anemone sylvestris L. (Ranunculaceae), a protected species in Poland, {{we found that}} the seed set is impaired. The flower is considered an adaptation that has coevolved to achieve effective pollination and successful fertilization. Therefore we have focused on the morphological and anatomical characteristics of the flowers of A. sylvestris L. as a prelude {{to the study of the}} species’ pollination biology and plant breeding system. The large size of the flower (50. 6 ± 16. 4 mm in dimensions) and its bowl shape fulfil both the biotic pollination syndrome and the aerodynamic requirements for pollen dispersal and capture. The opening and closing of the perianth provide a shelter for beetles. The odourless perianth, absence of nectar, scarcity of pollen (approximately 200 000 pollen grains per flower) and its traits – small size (axis P = 18. 52 ± 1. 0 μm; E = 16. 59 ± 0. 9 μm), lack of balsam on the exine surface, starch accumulation in more than 95 % of pollen grains correspond to the specialization in <b>anemophily.</b> The stigma is papillous, the dense hairs are situated between single carpels indicating adaptation to capturing dry pollen and specialization in the wind pollination syndrome.

40|$|Leucadendron is a {{moderately}} large genus of Proteaccae almost entirely {{restricted to the}} Cape Floristic Region of southern Africa. The genus is unusual in being dioecious and sexually dimorphic. ITS sequence data were obtained from 62 of the 96 currently recognized taxa (85 species and 11 subspecies). Phylogenetic analyses were conducted under Maximum Likelihood and parsimony and resolved nine groups of species {{with varying degrees of}} bootstrap support, but relationships between these groups are largely unsupported. The phylogeny conflicts with the current taxonomic arrangement, which is based mainly on fruit morphology. The two sections of the genus, Alatosperma and Leucadendron, and several subsections within these sections, are resolved as non-monophyletic. This means that taxonomically important characters (such as fruit shape) have evolved multiple times, as the species with nutlike fruit (resolved into two of the nine groups) appear to have evolved independently from ancestors with winged fruit.

Here, we analyze five plastid DNA regions of the endangered Juniperus brevifolia, which is endemic to the Azores archipelago. Methodology/Principal Findings: The phylogeny of the section Juniperus and the phylogeographic analyses of J. brevifolia based on the coalescence theory of allele (plastid) diversity suggest that: (1) a single introduction event likely occurred from Europe; (2) genetic diversification and inter-island dispersal postdated {{the emergence of the}} oldest island (Santa Maria, 8. 12 Ma); (3) the genetic differentiation found in populations on the islands with higher age and smaller distance to the continent is significantly higher than that on the younger, more remote ones; (4) the high number of haplotypes observed (16), and the widespread distribution of the most frequent and ancestral ones across the archipelago, are indicating early diversification, demographic expansion, and recurrent dispersal. In contrast, restriction of six of the seven derived haplotypes to single islands is construed as reflecting significant isolation time prior to colonization. Conclusions/Significance: Our phylogeographic reconstruction points to the sequence of island emergence as the key factor to explain the distribution of plastid DNA variation.

Scarabaeid beetle by causing flower damage and bruchid beetle by using buds, flowers and fruits for breeding greatly affect fruit set rate and thus the success of sexual reproduction in this plant species is also affected. Seeds are non-dormant, the embryo is chlorophyllous while the fruits are on the plant. Healthy seeds germinate as soon as they reach the forest floor but their establishment is seemingly affected by resource constraints due to the rocky habitat.

The flowers are nectariferous and the nectar has hexose-rich sugars, some essential and non-essential amino acids. Trigona bee and Rhynchium wasp were the exclusive foragers, though their foraging activity does not promote cross-pollination. The male flower number, the pollen output, the pollen characteristics and the placement of anthers on the top of androphore conform to <b>anemophily.</b> The natural fruit set does not exceed 5 %. The fruit is 5 -follicled with one or two seeds. The low fruit set is compensated by the production of more 2 -seeded follicles. Fruit characteristics such as wing-like follicles, membranous follicle sheath and being very light weight characterize anemochory. Seeds with a hard coat do not germinate readily during the rainy season and their germination depends on the soil chemicals and nutrient environment. The soil is deficient in nitrogen, potassium and phosphorous. Partly burned seeds due to natural or human-caused fires germinate quickly in water saturated soil. The study suggests that seed germination and seedling growth rates are regulated by intrinsic and extrinsic factors along with natural and anthropogenic fires. We recommend that seedlings should be raised in nurseries and then transferred to natural habitats to build up the population...|$|E
40|$|Wind pollinated (anemophilous) {{angiosperm}} lineages {{have often}} converged independently on floral traits; the syndrome of traits presumably reflecting adaptation to more efficient pollen transport by wind and capture by receptive surfaces. One often-cited trait differentiating anemophiles from zoophiles is the cohesion of pollen grains into clumps, with greater clumping expected among the latter. Further, the {{mechanism by which}} grains are released remains underexplored. This thesis examines (1) whether pollen clumping can be used diagnostically to determine the vector, and (2) the hypothesis that resonance vibration of stamens in wind gusts is a mechanism of pollen release. Pollen clumping was studied intraspecifically in the wind pollinated Plantago lanceolata and interspecifically across 23 anemophilous and zoophilous species. Mean clump size {{was found to be}} well-distinguished species by vector, and the lognormal distribution was a reasonable characterization of clump size {{for the majority of the}} species examined. The stamens of P. lanceolata were manipulated in the laboratory and observed in the field to characterize their dynamic response to vibration. Stamens had elastic properties corresponding to modeling as underdamped cantilever beams and to theoretical ranges predicted to initiate resonance vibration in wind gusts. Pollen was released in multiple discrete bursts from resonating stamens with successively greater energy requirements. In the field, pollen release was observed from a resonating stamen. Understanding the function of stamen properties is crucial for developing an evolutionary theory of <b>anemophily</b> and modeling the wind pollination process. This study demonstrates that anemophilous stamens have distinct, quantifiable physical properties differentiating from stamens evolved for other mating systems...|$|E
40|$|The alpine {{regions are}} {{regarded}} as one of the most extreme land environments due mainly to of harsh environmental conditions. However, these regions have very distinctive and diverse alpine plants, and the reproductive strategies of these species are an area of concern for many researchers. In this paper, we summarize previous research on reproductive strategies of alpine plants, including resource allocation, the responses of the flower morphology to abiotic factors, animal pollination and the adaptive mechanism of alpine plants, fruits and seeds, and clonal reproduction. For example, some special floral structures adapt to low temperature and inadequate water in the alpine belt by flower heliotropism, floral closure, pubescence and semi-translucent bracts. Additionally, harsh and stochastic climate conditions lead to a paucity of pollinators. Selfing mechanisms such as delayed selfing, autonomous selfing, and clonal reproduction and abiotic pollination (<b>anemophily)</b> adaptions to the lack of pollinators. As for insect pollinated plants, resource allocations of reproduction structure have increased, with enlarged “advertisement” investments. These advertisements can increase pollination rates through bigger floral displays or elongation of flower longevity. Additionally, plant species possessing a generalized floral structure and the ability to flower in different seasons can also improve the probability of reproduction success. Furthermore, dry fruits and a persistent seed bank aid in alpine plant seed dispersal and germination. Combined with our previous research, we highlight foursubjects for future study: (1) selection on the flower morphology of alpine plants by abiotic factors; (2) seasonal variation and reproductive strategy; (3) the interaction of pollinators and plants at the community level; and (4) response of alpine ecosystems to global warming...|$|E
40|$|Biological {{traits that}} are {{advantageous}} under specific ecological conditions should {{be present in}} {{a large proportion of}} the species within an ecosystem, where those specific conditions prevail. As climatic conditions change, the frequency of certain traits in plant communities is expected to change with increasing altitude. We examined patterns of change for 13 traits in 120 exhaustive inventories of plants along five altitudinal transects (520 - 3100 m a. s. l.) in grasslands and in forests in western Switzerland. The traits selected for study represented the occupation of space, photosynthesis, reproduction and dispersal. For each plot, the mean trait values or the proportions of the trait states were weighted by species cover and examined in relation to the first axis of a PCA based on local climatic conditions. With increasing altitude in grasslands, we observed a decrease in <b>anemophily</b> and an increase in entomophily complemented by possible selfing; a decrease in diaspores with appendages adapted to ectozoochory, linked to a decrease in achenes and an increase in capsules. In lowlands, pollination and dispersal are ensured by wind and animals. However, with increasing altitude, insects are mostly responsible for pollination, and wind becomes the main natural dispersal vector. Some traits showed a particularly marked change in the alpine belt (e. g., the increase of capsules and the decrease of achenes), confirming that this belt concentrates particularly stressful conditions to plant growth and reproduction (e. g. cold, short growing season) that constrain plants to a limited number of strategies. One adaptation to this stress is to limit investment in dispersal by producing capsules with numerous, tiny seeds that have appendages limited to narrow wings. Forests displayed many of the trends observed in grasslands but with a reduced variability that is likely due to a shorter altitudinal gradient...|$|E
