40|$|The {{remarkable}} gapless and linear {{band structure}} of graphene opens up new carrier relaxation channels bridging the valence and the conduction band. These Auger scattering processes change {{the number of}} charge carriers and can {{give rise to a}} significant multiplication of optically excited carriers in graphene. This is an ultrafast many-particle phenomenon that is of great interest both for fundamental many-particle physics as well as technological applications. Here, we review the research on carrier multiplication in graphene and Landau-quantized graphene including theoretical modeling and experimental demonstration.

40|$|We {{review the}} origin of anomaly-induced {{dynamics}} in theories of d = 2 gravity from a BRST viewpoint and show how quantum canonical transformations {{may be used to}} solve the resulting Liouville or Toda models for the anomalous modes. Two-dimensional worldsheet gravity models coupled to non-critical matter systems provide a very useful workshop for investigating the way in which induced dynamics can arise from anomalies. In this article, we shall first review the way in which such anomalous dynamics can arise within the context of BRST quantization. Then we shall present a technique for solving the resulting anomalous quantum system by canonical transformations, implemented by intertwining operators. We shall use these techniques to find the wavefunctions for the minisuperspace limits of Liouville and Toda d = 2 gravities.

The particular name came from the use of three connected circles in the coat of arms of the aristocratic Borromeo family in Italy. weakly-bound three-body systems with two-neutron halos such as 22 C, the core can be treated as a point-like structureless particle, when considering that most of its microscopic structure (with many neutrons and protons close together) are not affecting the general universal properties of the three-body bound system. The effect of themicroscopic structure of the core in the halo properties are parameterized by the values of few number of observables, as the two- and three-body energies, which can be considered as inputs in effective models, as the renormalized zero range (RZR) approach proposed in [11].

After the experimental discovery of the two-neutron halo in 11 Li, it has been reported several other nuclear systems with neutron halos and far from the stability line.

40|$|The SAF 1760 is a Hi-Speed Universal Serial Bus (USB) host {{controller}} with {{a generic}} processor interface. It integrates one Enhanced Host Controller Interface (EHCI), one Transaction Translator (TT) and three transceivers. The host controller {{portion of the}} SAF 1760 and the three transceivers comply to Ref. 1 “Universal Serial Bus Specification Rev. 2. 0 ”. The EHCI portion of the SAF 1760 is <b>adapted</b> <b>from</b> <b>Ref.</b> 2 “Enhanced Host Controller Interface Specification for Universal Serial Bus Rev. 1. 0 ”. The integrated high-performance Hi-Speed USB transceivers enable the SAF 1760 to handle all Hi-Speed USB transfer speed modes: high-speed (480 Mbit/s), full-speed (12 Mbit/s) and low-speed (1. 5 Mbit/s). The three downstream ports allow simultaneous connection of three devices at different speeds (high-speed, full-speed and low-speed). The generic processor interface allows the SAF 1760 {{to be connected to}} various processors as a memory-mapped resource. The SAF 1760 is a slave host: it does not require bus-mastering capabilities of the host system bus. The interface can be configured, ensuring compatibility with a variety of processors. Data transfer can be performed on 16 bits or 32 bits, using Programmed Input/Output (PIO) or Direct Memory Access (DMA) with major control signals configurable as active LOW or active HIGH. Integration of the TT allows connection to full-speed and low-speed devices, without the need of integrating Open Host Controller Interface (OHCI) or Universal Host Controller Interface (UHCI). Instead of dealing with two sets of software drivers, EHCI and OHCI or UHCI, you need to deal with only one set, EHCI, that dramatically reduces software complexity and IC cost. 2.
