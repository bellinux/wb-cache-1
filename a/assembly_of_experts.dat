25|$|The <b>Assembly</b> <b>of</b> <b>Experts</b> elects and dismisses (to date, never did) the Supreme Leader on {{the basis}} of {{qualifications}} and popular esteem. To date, the <b>Assembly</b> <b>of</b> <b>Experts</b> has not challenged any of the Supreme Leader's decisions. The current head of the judicial system, Sadeq Larijani, appointed by the longtime Supreme Leader, said that it is illegal for the <b>Assembly</b> <b>of</b> <b>Experts</b> to supervise the Supreme Leader. Due to Khamenei's very longtime unchallenged rule, many believe the <b>Assembly</b> <b>of</b> <b>Experts</b> has become a ceremonial body without any real power. There have been instances when the current Supreme Leader publicly criticized members of the <b>Assembly</b> <b>of</b> <b>Experts,</b> resulting in their arrest and dismissal. For example, Khamenei publicly called then-member of the <b>Assembly</b> <b>of</b> <b>Experts</b> Ahmad Azari Qomi a traitor, resulting in Qomi's arrest and eventual dismissal from the <b>Assembly</b> <b>of</b> <b>Experts.</b> Another instance is when Khamenei indirectly called Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani a traitor for a statement he made, resulting Rafsanjani to retract it.|$|E

5000|$|Shortly before Imam Khomeini's death {{a change}} {{was made in}} the {{constitution}} allowing a lower ranking Shia cleric to become Supreme Leader. Khomeini had a falling out with his successor Hussein-Ali Montazeri who disapproved of human rights abuses by the Islamic Republic such as the mass execution of political prisoners in late summer and early autumn 1988. Montazeri was demoted as a marja and Khomeini chose a new successor, a relatively low-ranking member of the clergy, Ali Khamene'i. However Article 109 stipulated that the leader be `a source of imitation` (Marja-e taqlid).

40|$|The EXPERT mission aims at {{collecting}} precise in-flight data during atmospheric re-entry. For {{this purpose}} a vehicle was envisaged {{that is designed}} especially for that. Almost twenty payloads are on board <b>of</b> the <b>EXPERT</b> capsule which has {{the shape of a}} cone with a blunt nose. Four non-moveable flaps are located {{at the end of the}} capsule. The nose of the vehicle is made from a ceramic matrix (CMC) composite material. In the nose four exciting experiments are situated. Payload 1 is a Flush Air Data System that measures the pressure and the heat flux in five positions on the nose. Payload 2 collects temperature date on the inside of the ceramic nose at six locations via pyrometric measurements. Payload 10 is a spectrometer that investigates the chemical properties of the boundary layer around the nose via an optical window in the nose. Palyoad 11 is an experiment that deals with the catalycity of materials in the region of the interface of the nose to the adjacent metallic Thermal Protection System (TPS) of the capsule.

40|$|This study {{deals with}} the rise and decline {{of the system of}} unelected {{representative}} bodies that accompanied post-war democracy in the Netherlands. After World War II, the number of these unelected representative bodies grew spectacularly, but from the seventies onwards, it started to decrease. How can we account for this remarkable political change? In traditional historiography, this change is associated with the pillarisation of Dutch society, the institutionalisation of corporatist arrangements, the emergence of new social movements or the deep-rooted practice of consensus building. As these accounts turn out to be problematic, this study focuses on the democratic character of unelected representative bodies. Chapter 1 introduces a framework for analysing the democratic character of these bodies, based on the criteria of a democratic political order as identified by R. A. Dahl. The framework encompasses the constitution of the domains represented by unelected bodies; the recruitment of their members; the tasks they fulfilled; and their internal decision-making process. Chapter 2 presents the cases used to analyse how the democratic character of the system of unelected representative bodies developed. These cases are the Sociaal-Economische Raad (1950), the Landbouwschap (1954 - 1995), the Nationale Raad voor Maatschappelijk Werk (1946 - 1989) and the Raad voor de Kunst (1955 - 1995). Chapter 3 shows that the represented domains were either constituted from above by the state or from below by interest groups. The involvement of interest groups led to the exclusion of rivals and, later on, to petrifaction, with the composition of unelected bodies remaining the same despite fundamental social changes. Chapter 4 highlights a similar pattern as the members delegated by interest groups managed to exclude a large number of newcomers. This resulted in a fierce critique of the involvement of interest groups in member recruitment and led to a new generation of unelected councils composed <b>of</b> independent <b>experts.</b> Chapter 5 illustrates that most bodies turned to interest articulation, consultation and advisory tasks instead of governing the domains they represented – one of their initial tasks. Meanwhile, as chapter 6 shows, the internal decision-making process acquired a more democratic character because both its openness to the public and opportunities for participation increased. However, conflicts of interest intensified. There were two categories of unelected representative bodies, as the concluding Chapter 7 makes clear. One category remained largely unaffected by social pressures and was influenced mainly by internal processes aiming to consolidate the position of insiders. The other category transformed in accordance with political initiative or administrative changes. These bodies were the first to be abolished or transformed into <b>assemblies</b> <b>of</b> <b>experts,</b> intensively controlled by the state. A dialectics of loss of control and interference explains why the state delegated public responsibility first but withdrew it later, causing the system to decline. A dialectics of expertise and social support explains why its composition changed. By recruiting members from interest groups, the government tried to enhance social support for political decisions. The introduction <b>of</b> <b>experts</b> helped to overcome the shortcomings these members exposed but weakened links with societ...|$|R
25|$|Initially, {{the idea}} of {{leadership}} council was proposed by some members of <b>Assembly</b> <b>of</b> <b>experts.</b> Various lists were proposed and Khamenei was named in all of them. For instance, a council of three members, Ali Meshkini, Mousavi Ardebili and Khamenei, was proposed to lead Iran. According to Rafsanjani, he and Khamenei were against the proposal while Ayatollah Haeri Shirazi and Ayatollah Ebrahim Amini {{were in favor of}} it. Supporters of the council proposal believed that having a council would produce a higher degree of unity in society and more positive characteristics would be found in a council, while the opposers believed that an individual leader was more efficient according to the past experiences in case of Judiciary council.|$|E
25|$|Today, as Supreme Leader, Khamenei is {{the head}} of state of Iran and the {{commander-in-chief}} of its armed forces. For this reason, he is considered the most powerful political authority in the country. As Supreme Leader, Khamenei can issue decrees and make the final decisions on the main policies of the government in many fields such as economy, the environment, foreign policy, national planning in Iran. According to Karim Sadjadpour, Khamenei has either direct or indirect control over the executive, legislative and judicial branches of government, as well as the military and media. All candidates to the <b>Assembly</b> <b>of</b> <b>Experts,</b> the President and the Majlis (Parliament), are vetted by the Guardian Council, whose members are selected directly or indirectly by the Supreme Leader of Iran.
