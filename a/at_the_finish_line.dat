5|$|The {{final stage}} of the race was a flat stage that {{finished}} in Madrid. It was won in a sprint by Degenkolb. During the stage, Valverde took advantage of a puncture for Rodríguez and won the intermediate sprint {{to give him the}} points jersey. Although Aru lost a little time in a split in the peloton <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>finish</b> <b>line,</b> the rest of the standings were unchanged. Aru therefore won the race, his first Grand Tour victory.|$|E
5|$|Kenya {{competed in}} the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan. The country's {{participation}} at the Games marked its Winter Olympics debut, although it had {{competed in the}} Summer Olympics since 1956. The delegation consisted of a single cross-country skier, Philip Boit. He had been trained {{as part of a}} scheme created by American sportswear company Nike, Inc. Although Boit did not win a medal, his efforts received worldwide attention after gold medallist Bjorn Daehlie of Norway waited for him <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>finish</b> <b>line</b> as Boit completed the race in difficult conditions in last place.|$|E
5|$|Danilo Di Luca made {{it clear}} that he was aiming for the time bonuses {{available}} in this stage, both <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>finish</b> <b>line</b> and the intermediate sprint. As such, his team worked to bring the morning's breakaway back well before the end of the stage. Just as he had in the mountains, race leader Denis Menchov stayed right with Di Luca, and the two of them contested the intermediate sprint, with Di Luca's team trying to give him a successful leadout. They mistimed it, however, and Menchov was able to come around Di Luca and beat him to the line (Di Luca's teammate and accomplished sprinter Alessandro Petacchi managed to beat Menchov in the sprint to limit Di Luca's losses). Both Menchov and Di Luca got time bonuses, but Menchov got 4 for second in the sprint and Di Luca 2 for third, padding Menchov's lead in the overall classification.|$|E

5|$|Duque took a high placing at the Gran Premio dell'Insubria-Lugano, {{finishing}} {{just off}} the podium in fourth place, coming home in a group that trailed two leading riders. At Kuurne–Brussels–Kuurne, a race which included most of the sport's top teams, Petit finished ninth in a field sprint finish {{at the front of}} the race. Ista narrowly missed out on a victory at Le Samyn in early March. The race's top finishers came across the finish line scattered, in groups of eight or fewer. Ista finished second, alone, 8 seconds back of solo winner Dominic Klemme. Two weeks later, Keukeilere finished fourth in a sprint at Nokere Koerse. Gallopin finished on the podium at Cholet-Pays de Loire. 's Thomas Voeckler won the race with a late attack, with the peloton coming so close to catching him <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>finish</b> <b>line</b> that there was no time gap. Gallopin was first from the peloton for second overall. Vogondy rode to fourth place at the Route Adélie de Vitré, just missing the podium after figuring into a winning breakaway.|$|E
5|$|Menchov was fifth after Alpe di Siusi, but rose {{to second}} before stage 12, the {{very long and}} hilly {{individual}} time trial in Cinque Terre. There, he claimed a convincing victory; only Levi Leipheimer finished within a minute of Menchov's winning time. Di Luca was nearly two minutes slower than him, finished sixth on the stage, and fell to second overall, with Menchov assuming the race lead. Di Luca tried repeatedly to shed Menchov during the remaining mountain stages {{to make up the}} time difference, which was never more than a minute. The two riders were involved in sprints for time bonuses <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>finish</b> <b>line</b> in stages 16 and 17, as well as an intermediate sprint in stage 20. Menchov was consistently quicker than Di Luca in these sprints. With his superior time-trial skills providing the difference in the final stage, the Russian was able to emerge as Giro champion, despite a dramatic fall in the final kilometre before the finish line.|$|E

50|$|The 1948 Swiss Grand Prix was a Grand Prix motor race held at Circuit Bremgarten, near Bern, on 4 July 1948. Despite racing {{for nearly}} two hours, <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>finishing</b> <b>line</b> Frenchman Jean-Pierre Wimille was only 0.2 seconds behind the race winner, the Italian driver Carlo Felice Trossi. Trossi's compatriot Luigi Villoresi {{finished}} over {{two and a half}} minutes behind the pair, in third place. Pre-World War II star driver Achille Varzi was killed when he crashed during practice, and the wealthy Swiss privateer Christian Kautz died in an accident during the race.|$|R
25|$|There {{is still}} some {{speculation}} and controversy around the Olympics 10,000 metres race. Alberto Cova has confessed the use of blood transfusion in his career and therefore Mike McLeod, originally third <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>finish</b> <b>line,</b> claims he should be awarded the gold medal. However, Vainio considers himself to be the second best runner in the 10,000 metres race {{until the end of}} his life.|$|E
25|$|Weidlinger competed at the Cinque Mulini {{cross country}} race in early 2008 and managed to finish in sixth place. He set two new {{national}} records in May that year: first, he ran 27:36.46 in the 10,000m at the Payton Jordan Cardinal Invitational in Palo Alto, California, taking second behind Craig Mottram. He then set a 10km Austrian record at the Great Manchester Run: his winning time of 28:10 was just enough to hold off Serhiy Lebid and Mustafa Mohamed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>finish</b> <b>line.</b> Weidlinger won the Group A 5000m {{for a second time}} at the 2008 European Cup. He competed in the 10,000m at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing and finished 27th in a time of 28:14.38. This made him the fifth best performing European in the event. On September 1, 2008 he won the Nike Human Race 10K race with a time of 29:25 while running in Munich, Germany.|$|E
25|$|On {{the last}} ascent of the day, the Tre Cime di Lavaredo, Di Luca made {{up much of}} the ground he had in deficit to Mazzoleni on the road, conceding a minute and 24 seconds to him <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>finish</b> <b>line.</b> Gilberto Simoni, Damiano Cunego, and Andy Schleck {{finished}} just behind him. In {{the front of the}} race, Riccò attacked as the Lavaredo climb began and quickly got a 15 second gap. The only rider to bridge to him was his teammate Piepoli. Piepoli, having taken the lead outright in the mountains classification, allowed Riccò the stage win. Their team leader Simoni reflected after the stage that he thought their early break was foolhardy, and that he had not followed because he was focused only on the overall and not stages, but that he was happy that the team took the Giro's marquee stage.|$|E
5000|$|Among {{the many}} {{illustrations}} of the fable, {{that by the}} French caricaturist Jean Grandville is novel in portraying the tortoise as running upright. This is also how he {{is shown in the}} Walt Disney cartoon version of [...] "The Tortoise and the Hare" [...] (1935). Another departure from the ordinary in Grandville's etching is the choice of a mole (complete with dark glasses) rather than, as usual, a fox as <b>the</b> judge <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>finishing</b> <b>line.</b> Auguste Delierre makes the judge a monkey in the 1883 edition of La Fontaine's fables that he illustrated.

50|$|The {{athletic}} events saw {{the introduction}} of an automatic timing system developed by R. Carlstedt. It involved attaching electromagnets to chronometers in a system which attached a control lamp to the starting gun for each race. This resulted in the firing of the gun starting a timer which was then stopped by one of <b>the</b> judges <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>finishing</b> <b>line.</b> <b>The</b> final of the men's 100 metres {{was expected to be}} a mostly American affair, and it ended up with six athletes, only one of whom was not from the United States. It suffered from seven false starts before the athletes finally got away, with Ralph Craig winning the gold medal by 60 cm in front of second place Alvah Meyer.|$|R
25|$|The Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race is {{an annual}} long-{{distance}} sled dog race run in early March from Settler's Bay to Nome, {{which takes place}} entirely in the US state of Alaska. Mushers {{and a team of}} 16 dogs, of which at least 5 must be on the towline <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>finish</b> <b>line,</b> cover the distance in 8–15 days or more. The Iditarod began in 1973 as an event to test the best sled dog mushers and teams but evolved into today's highly competitive race. Then a record, the second fastest winning time was recorded in 2016 by Dallas Seavey with a time of 8 days, 11 hours, 20 minutes, and 16 seconds. As of 2012, Dallas Seavey was also the youngest musher to win the race at the age of 25. In 2017, at the age of 57, Dallas's father, Mitch Seavey, is the oldest and fastest person ever to win the race, crossing the line in Nome in 8 days, 3 hours, 40 minutes and 13 seconds. Dallas finished second, two hours and 44 minutes behind.|$|E
