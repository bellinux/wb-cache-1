5|$|Several {{chemical}} compounds with potential biological activities {{are found in}} sundews, including flavonoids (kaempferol, myricetin, quercetin and hyperoside), quinones (plumbagin, hydroplumbagin glucoside and rossoliside (7–methyl–hydrojuglone–4–glucoside)), and other constituents such as carotenoids, plant acids (e.g. butyric acid, citric acid, formic acid, gallic acid, malic acid, propionic acid), resin, tannins and <b>ascorbic</b> <b>acid</b> (vitamin C).|$|E
5|$|In 1930, Paul Karrer elucidated {{the correct}} {{structure}} for beta-carotene, the main precursor of vitamin A, and identified other carotenoids. Karrer and Norman Haworth confirmed Albert Szent-Györgyi's discovery of <b>ascorbic</b> <b>acid</b> and {{made significant contributions}} to the chemistry of flavins, which led to the identification of lactoflavin. For their investigations on carotenoids, flavins and vitamins A and B2, they both received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1937.|$|E
5|$|Alcohols do not {{normally}} behave as acids in water, but {{the presence of}} a double bond adjacent to the OH group can substantially decrease the pKa by the mechanism of keto–enol tautomerism. <b>Ascorbic</b> <b>acid</b> is an example of this effect. The diketone 2,4-pentanedione (acetylacetone) is also a weak acid because of the keto–enol equilibrium. In aromatic compounds, such as phenol, which have an OH substituent, conjugation with the aromatic ring as a whole greatly increases the stability of the deprotonated form.|$|E

Electrodeposition of tyramine and simultaneous entrapment of GO/SBCD were performed in 50 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7 containing 0. 1 M tyramine, 1750 units GO, and 10 mM SBCD. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) imaging revealed the presence of semicircular nanofibers with a height of 40 nm and an averaged length of 795 nm throughout the electropolymerized film surface. The combined film of poly(tyramine) and SBCD served as an excellent matrix polymer for the GO immobilization with high stability, selectivity, and reproducibility. Sensitive and selective detection of H 2 ̆ 082 O 2 ̆ 082 was realized at + 0. 4 V vs 3 M Ag/AgCl, since the poly(tyramine) /SBCD film was capable of preventing the passage of electroactive uric and <b>ascorbic</b> <b>acids</b> to the electrode. The glucose biosensor exhibited a remarkably selective response to glucose with a detection limit of 10 3 ̆bcM, linearity up to 110 mM, and a response time of 2 s. Glutaraldehyde cross-linking of the film with entrapped GO completely eliminated electroactive interference caused by uric and <b>ascorbic</b> <b>acids.</b> Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|R
40|$|The {{implication}} of organic acids in Cd and Ni translocation was {{studied in the}} halophyte species Sesuvium portulacastrum. Citric, fumaric, malic and <b>ascorbic</b> <b>acids</b> were separated and quantified by HPLC technique in shoots, roots and xylem saps of plants grown on nutrient solutions added with 50 µM Cd, 100 µM Ni and the combination of 50 µM Cd + 100 µM Ni. Results showed that Cd had no significant impact on biomass production while Ni and the combination of both metals drastically affected plant development. Cadmium and Ni concentrations in tissues and xylem sap were higher in plants individually exposed to heavy metal application than in those subjected to the combined treatment Cd + Ni, suggesting a possible competition between these metals for absorption. Both metals applied separately or in combination induced an increase in citrate concentration in shoots and xylem sap but a decrease of this concentration in the roots. However a minor relationship was observed between metal application and fumaric, malic and <b>ascorbic</b> <b>acids.</b> Both observations suggest the {{implication of}} citric acid in Cd, Ni translocation and shoot accumulation in S. portulacastrum. The relatively high accumulation of citric acid in xylem sap and shoot of S. portulacastrum could be involved in metal chelation and thus contributes to heavy metal tolerance in this species...|$|R

The macronutrient composition of 100 grams of dried bolete includes 17.9 grams of protein, 72.8 grams of carbohydrates, and 0.4 grams of fat. By weight, fresh fruit bodies are about 92% water. The predominant sugar is trehalose (4.7 grams/100 grams dry weight; all following values assume this mass), with lesser amounts of mannitol (1.3 grams).

5|$|Nonpolar {{antioxidants}} such as eugenol—a {{major component}} of oil of cloves—have toxicity limits that can be exceeded with the misuse of undiluted essential oils. Toxicity associated with high doses of water-soluble antioxidants such as <b>ascorbic</b> <b>acid</b> are less of a concern, as these compounds can be excreted rapidly in urine. More seriously, very high doses of some antioxidants may have harmful long-term effects. The beta-carotene and Retinol Efficacy Trial (CARET) study of lung cancer patients found that smokers given supplements containing beta-carotene and vitamin A had increased rates of lung cancer. Subsequent studies confirmed these adverse effects.|$|E
5|$|A vitamin is {{an organic}} {{compound}} and an essential nutrient that an organism requires in limited amounts. An organic chemical compound (or related set of compounds) {{is called a}} vitamin when the organism cannot synthesize the compound in sufficient quantities, {{and it must be}} obtained through the diet; thus, the term vitamin is conditional upon the circumstances and the particular organism. For example, <b>ascorbic</b> <b>acid</b> (one form of vitamin C) is a vitamin for humans, but not for most other animals. Vitamin D is essential only for people who do not have adequate skin exposure to sunlight, as ultraviolet light promotes synthesis in skin cells. Supplementation is important for the treatment of certain health problems, but there is little evidence of nutritional benefit when used by otherwise healthy people.|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} arsenic {{remediation}} {{tests were conducted}} using a washing method with biodegradable organic acids, including oxalic, citric and <b>ascorbic</b> <b>acids.</b> Approximately 80 % of the arsenic in one sample was removed under {{the effect of the}} <b>ascorbic</b> and oxalic <b>acid</b> combination, which was roughly twice higher than the effectiveness of the <b>ascorbic</b> and citric <b>acid</b> combination under the same conditions. The soils treated using biodegradable acids had low remaining concentrations of arsenic that are primarily contained in the crystalline iron oxides and organic matter fractions. The close correlation between extracted arsenic and extracted iron/aluminum suggested that arsenic was removed via the dissolution of Fe/Al oxides in soils. The fractionation of arsenic in four contaminated soils was investigated using a modified sequential extraction method. Regarding fractionation, we found that most of the soil contained high proportions of arsenic (As) in exchangeable fractions with phosphorus, amorphous oxides, and crystalline iron oxides, while a small amount of the arsenic fraction was organic matter-bound. This study indicated that biodegradable organic acids can be considered as a means for arsenic-contaminated soil remediation...|$|R
40|$|Soil {{salinity}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} severe factors limiting growth and physiological response in cowpea plants. In this study, the low concentrations of NaCl (25 mM) increased plant growth, photosynthetic pigments content, total soluble protein content, nucleic acids contents (DNA and RNA), lipid peroxidation, non enzymatic antioxidants (anthocyanin, <b>ascorbic</b> <b>acids</b> and α-tocopherol), number of legumes per plant, number of seeds per legume, number of seeds per plants, legume length, fresh and dry weight of legumes and weight of 1000 seeds and total soluble proteins and carbohydrate contents in harvested seeds as compared to control. On the other hand, the high concentrations of NaCl (50, 100 and 200 mM) caused reduction in plant growth, photosynthetic pigments content, total soluble protein content, nucleic acids contents (DNA and RNA), all yield attributes and harvested seeds components but increased lipid peroxidation and non enzymatic antioxidants (anthocyanin, <b>ascorbic</b> <b>acids</b> and α-tocopherol). Electrophoretic studies of proteins showed three types of modifications are observed in the protein patterns of cowpea seeds, some protein bands were disappeared, other proteins were selectively increased and synthesis of new set of protein was induced. Some of these responses were observed under gamma rays and salinity treatments, while others were induced by either gamma rays or salinity.

5|$|Antioxidants {{are used}} as food {{additives}} to help guard against food deterioration. Exposure to oxygen and sunlight are the two main factors in the oxidation of food, so food is preserved by keeping {{in the dark and}} sealing it in containers or even coating it in wax, as with cucumbers. However, as oxygen is also important for plant respiration, storing plant materials in anaerobic conditions produces unpleasant flavors and unappealing colors. Consequently, packaging of fresh fruits and vegetables contains an ~8% oxygen atmosphere. Antioxidants are an especially important class of preservatives as, unlike bacterial or fungal spoilage, oxidation reactions still occur relatively rapidly in frozen or refrigerated food. These preservatives include natural antioxidants such as <b>ascorbic</b> <b>acid</b> (AA, E300) and tocopherols (E306), as well as synthetic antioxidants such as propyl gallate (PG, E310), tertiary butylhydroquinone (TBHQ), butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA, E320) and butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT, E321).|$|E
25|$|<b>Ascorbic</b> <b>acid</b> and its sodium, potassium, {{and calcium}} salts are {{commonly}} used as antioxidant food additives. These compounds are water-soluble and, thus, cannot protect fats from oxidation: For this purpose, the fat-soluble esters of <b>ascorbic</b> <b>acid</b> with long-chain fatty acids (ascorbyl palmitate or ascorbyl stearate) {{can be used as}} food antioxidants. Eighty percent of the world's supply of <b>ascorbic</b> <b>acid</b> is produced in China.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ascorbic</b> <b>acid</b> is classed as a reductone. The {{ascorbate}} anion is stabilized by electron delocalization, {{as shown}} above {{in terms of}} resonance between two canonical forms.

40|$|A chain-like {{assembly}} of rhodium nanoparticles (5 – 7 nm mean diameter) has been synthesized from rhodium chloride {{with the help}} of polydentate molecules like tartaric and <b>ascorbic</b> <b>acids</b> (1 : 3 in mM scale) as capping agents at room temperature. Subsequent characterization using transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy reveals a unique inter-connected network like features, while their electrochemical behavior using cyclic voltammetry and current–time transient suggests potential applications as electrocatalysts in fuel cells. A significant negative shift in the onset potential as well as higher anodic peak current density for formic acid oxidation on Rh- tartaric acid (Rh-TA) as compared to that of bulk Rh metal confirms their higher electrocatalytic activity. Interestingly, the enhancement factor (R) with respect to that of bulk metallic Rh towards formic acid oxidation ranges up to 2000...|$|R
