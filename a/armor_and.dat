40|$|Recommended design KD are {{associated}} to implicit global safety factors to Initiation of Damage (IDa) and Initiation of Destruction (IDe). Zero-damage criterion is valid for double-layer armors of massive CAUs, but single-layer armors require a lower-than-zero damage criterion. A simple methodology is proposed to calculate design KD for Cubipod <b>armors</b> <b>and</b> to obtain reasonable explicit global safety factors to IDe and IDa {{when compared to}} benchmark CAUs. The stringent SF(IDe 5 %) is the lowest for double-layer trunk armors, higher for double-layer roundhead <b>armors</b> <b>and</b> the highest for single-layer trunk armors. Single-layer roundhead armors were not analyzed...|$|R
