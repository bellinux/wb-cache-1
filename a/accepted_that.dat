5000|$|Henry E. Kyburg, Jr.'s lottery paradox [...] {{arises from}} {{considering}} a fair 1000-ticket lottery that has exactly one winning ticket. If {{this much is}} known about the execution of the lottery it is therefore rational to <b>accept</b> <b>that</b> some ticket will win. Suppose that an event is very likely only if the probability of it occurring is greater than 0.99. On these grounds it is presumed rational to <b>accept</b> the proposition <b>that</b> ticket 1 of the lottery will not win. Since the lottery is fair, it is rational to <b>accept</b> <b>that</b> ticket 2 will not win either—indeed, it is rational to accept for any individual ticket i of the lottery that ticket i will not win. However, <b>accepting</b> <b>that</b> ticket 1 will not win, <b>accepting</b> <b>that</b> ticket 2 will not win, and so on until <b>accepting</b> <b>that</b> ticket 1000 will not win entails that it is rational to <b>accept</b> <b>that</b> no ticket will win, which entails that it is rational to accept the contradictory proposition that one ticket wins and no ticket wins.|$|R

5|$|According to Herodotus, the Allies {{spent the}} evening heatedly debating their course of action. The Peloponnesians were {{in favour of}} evacuating, {{and at this point}} Themistocles {{attempted}} his ruse with Xerxes. It was only when Aristides, the exiled Athenian general arrived that night, followed by some deserters from the Persians, with news of the deployment of the Persian fleet, that the Peloponnesians <b>accepted</b> <b>that</b> they could not escape, and so would fight.|$|E

50|$|Thirdly, despite <b>accepting</b> <b>that</b> {{modern humans}} had emerged by evolution, many anthropologists {{believed}} that the genus Homo had split from the great apes as long as 30 million years ago and so felt uneasy about <b>accepting</b> <b>that</b> humans had a small-brained, ape-like ancestor, like Australopithecus africanus, only two million years ago.|$|R

5|$|As {{there is}} no {{definitive}} date of when Dyer turned professional and many fights in the early 20th century were poorly recorded, the boxing record associated with Dyer is incomplete. His total bouts and results presently stand, as listed by Boxrec, as 72 fights, of which 44 were wins (14 by knockout), 20 loses (4 by knockout), 6 draws and 2 'no contests'. It is <b>accepted</b> <b>that</b> this list is incomplete and more bouts could be added in future, or changed.|$|E

He {{did not identify}} a type specimen, but the one specimen in his collection has since been formally declared the lectotype for the species. He also did not explicitly give an etymology for the specific epithet, but it is <b>accepted</b> <b>that</b> the name derives from the Latin verticillatus ("whorled"), {{in reference to the}} whorled leaf arrangement.|$|E
5|$|Brundage {{took the}} {{position}} that as the Germans had reported nondiscrimination to the IOC, and the IOC had <b>accepted</b> <b>that</b> report, US Olympic authorities were bound by that determination. Nevertheless, it became increasingly apparent that with the Nazi actions, no Jew was likely to secure {{a place on the}} German team. Brundage stated on this issue that as only 12Jews had ever represented Germany in the Olympics, it would hardly be surprising if none did in 1936.|$|E

5|$|Children {{have always}} played games. It is <b>accepted</b> <b>that</b> {{as well as}} being entertaining, playing games helps children's development. One of the most famous visual {{accounts}} of children's games is a painting by Pieter Bruegel the Elder called Children's Games, painted in 1560. It depicts children playing a range of games that presumably were typical of the time. Many of these games, such as marbles, hide-and-seek, blowing soap bubbles and piggyback riding continue to be played.|$|E
5|$|In 1880, Carrier-Belleuse– now art {{director}} of the Sèvres national porcelain factory– offered Rodin a part-time position as a designer. The offer was in part a gesture of reconciliation, and Rodin <b>accepted.</b> <b>That</b> part of Rodin which appreciated 18th-century tastes was aroused, and he immersed himself in designs for vases and table ornaments that brought the factory renown across Europe.|$|E
5|$|In {{between the}} birth of James and Reuben, Morris became {{severely}} ill. During his illness, a man named Gad Farnam moved into the Morris's home to care for him day and night. The two families became very close and Gad's daughter Rhoda, only five {{years old at the}} time of the illness, later became Morris's second wife. It was at this point in Morris's life that he <b>accepted</b> <b>that</b> he would never realize his early dream of becoming a minister.|$|E

5|$|It {{is widely}} <b>accepted</b> <b>that</b> no single English word {{is a true}} rhyme for orange, though there are half rhymes such as hinge, lozenge, syringe, flange, Stonehenge, or porridge. Although this {{property}} {{is not unique to}} the word—one study of 5,411 one-syllable English words found 80 words with no rhymes—the lack of rhyme for orange has garnered significant attention, and inspired many humorous verses.|$|E
5|$|On 21 June 1958, the Parliamentary Assembly {{recommended}} to the Council that the Assembly should have its {{seat in the}} same place where the other organisations are based, although it <b>accepted</b> <b>that</b> plenary sessions could be held elsewhere.

5|$|Quisling {{spent the}} last months of the war trying to prevent Norwegian deaths in the {{showdown}} that was developing between German and Allied forces in Norway. The regime worked for the safe repatriation of Norwegians held in German prisoner-of-war camps. Privately, Quisling had long <b>accepted</b> <b>that</b> National Socialism would be defeated. Hitler's suicide on 30 April 1945 left him free to pursue publicly his chosen end-game, a naïve offer of a transition to a power-sharing government with the government-in-exile.|$|E

5|$|That same year, in {{the general}} {{elections}} held in November, Romero Barceló lost his gubernatorial seat against former governor and opposing party rival Rafael Hernández Colón (PPD). It is widely <b>accepted</b> <b>that</b> Romero Barceló lost the elections because of this case, since his public opinion rating had deteriorated substantially during late 1984 as the investigations progressed, and since his political rivals used his defense of the officers {{as an indication of}} a possible conspiracy.|$|E
5|$|The ACLU's {{support of}} the NLRB was a major {{development}} for the ACLU, because it {{marked the first time}} it <b>accepted</b> <b>that</b> a government agency could be responsible for upholding civil liberties.
