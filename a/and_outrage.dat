5|$|In January 2005, Pinker defended Lawrence Summers, {{president}} of Harvard University, whose comments about a gender gap {{in mathematics and}} science angered much of the faculty. Pinker noted that Summers's remarks, properly understood, were hypotheses about overlapping statistical distributions of men's and women's talents and tastes, and that in a university such hypotheses {{ought to be the}} subject of empirical testing rather than dogma <b>and</b> <b>outrage.</b> Edge.org ran a debate between Pinker and Elizabeth Spelke on gender and science.|$|E
5|$|Crowds {{of people}} {{gathered}} in New York {{to witness the}} historic arrival, {{with tens of thousands}} of people crowding Battery Park in Manhattan to have a good view of the Statue of Liberty, where the aircraft was scheduled to touch down. Rumors circulated that L'Oiseau Blanc had been sighted along its route, in Newfoundland, or over Long Island. In France, some newspapers even reported that Nungesser and Coli had arrived safely in New York, evoking a wave of French patriotism. L'Oiseau Blanc had been carrying a sizable load of fuel, , which would have given them approximately 42 hours of flight time. After this time had passed, with no word as to the aircraft's fate, it was realized that the aircraft had been lost. In France, the public was scandalized by the newspapers such as La Presse which had printed false reports about the aircraft's arrival, <b>and</b> <b>outrage</b> was generated against the companies involved, with demonstrations in the streets.|$|E

5|$|In November 1861, the , {{commanded}} by Union Captain Charles Wilkes, intercepted the British mail ship RMS Trent and removed two Confederate diplomats, James Mason and John Slidell. They {{were held in}} Boston amid jubilation in the North <b>and</b> <b>outrage</b> in Britain. The British minister in Washington, Lord Lyons, demanded their release, as the U.S. {{had no right to}} stop a British-flagged ship traveling between neutral ports. The British drew up war plans to attack New York and sent reinforcements to Canada. Seward worked to defuse the situation. He persuaded Lyons to postpone delivering an ultimatum, and told Lincoln that the prisoners would have to be released. Lincoln did let them go, reluctantly, on technical grounds. Relations between the U.S. and Britain soon improved; in April 1862, Seward and Lyons signed a treaty they had negotiated allowing each nation to inspect the other's ships for contraband slaves. In November 1862, with America's image in Britain improved by the issuance of the preliminary Emancipation Proclamation, the British cabinet decided against recognition of the Confederacy as a nation.|$|E
5|$|The Native Americans' victory {{celebrations}} were short-lived. Public shock <b>and</b> <b>outrage</b> at Custer's {{death and}} defeat, and the government's {{knowledge about the}} remaining Sioux, led them to assign thousands more soldiers to the area. Over the next year, the new American military forces pursued the Lakota, forcing many of the Native Americans to surrender. Sitting Bull refused to surrender and in May 1877 led his band {{across the border into}} the North-West Territories, Canada. He remained in exile for four years near Wood Mountain, refusing a pardon and the chance to return. When crossing the border into Canadian territory, Sitting Bull was met by the Mounties of the region. During this meeting, James Morrow Walsh, commander of the North-West Mounted Police, explained to Sitting Bull that the Lakota were now on British soil and must obey British law. Walsh emphasized that he enforced the law equally and that every person in the territory had a right to justice. Walsh became an advocate for Sitting Bull and the two became good friends for the remainder of their lives.|$|E

Additionally, several new wireless regulations were passed around the world in an effort to learn from the many missteps in wireless communications—which could have saved many more passengers.|$|E
25|$|With the {{emergence}} of ISIL and its capture of large areas of Iraq and Syria, a number of crises resulted that sparked international attention.
