50|$|Holyhead's main {{industry}} was aluminium-based until September 2009, with Rio Tinto Group's Anglesey Aluminium subsidiary operating a massive aluminium smelter {{on the outskirts}} of the town. A large jetty in the harbour received ships from Jamaica and Australia, and their cargoes of alumina were transported on a cable belt rope driven conveyor belt that runs underneath the town to the plant. The jetty is now used by Orthios to dock cruise ships visiting from all over the world. The jetty is wide enough for coaches to travel down to collect and deliver passengers to the town and on local tours. The plant relied for its electricity supply on the island's nuclear power station at Wylfa, near Cemaes Bay. However, Wylfa is reaching the end of its life and has permission to generate only into 2012, and the ending of a low-cost electricity supply contract in 2009 impacted on the financial viability of the smelting plant. Continuing operations involve the remelting of <b>aluminium</b> <b>scrap</b> for re-use. The site is subject to proposals by a development company called Orthios.|$|E

In this perspective this paper analyse several procedures, all digital imaging based, autonomously developed, applied and tested for the characterisation of <b>aluminium</b> <b>scraps</b> resulting from the demolition of cars. Such products present different characteristics according to their composition (aluminium alloys) and their previous utilisation (different car components). These differences are enhanced by comminution process and, in some cases, strongly influences the characteristics of the resulting “particles”. In this paper the possibilities offered by the adoption of imag-ing approach to set up classification-recognition procedures, starting from the evalua-tion of aluminium scarps pictorial characteristics, are analysed and critically evalu-ated.

40|$|A {{computational}} {{fluid dynamics}} (CFD) based process model of a rotary furnace for <b>aluminium</b> <b>scrap</b> melting was developed and integrated with user-developed sub-models. The model consists of a gas region with turbulent flow and combustion, radiative heat transfer in {{the upper part of}} the furnace, a solid region of the furnace lining, and a solid-liquid region of salt and metal in the lower part of the furnace. The solid-liquid region, where scrap melting and burn-off reactions take place, was regarded as a conducting solid.

50|$|Aluminium {{recycling}} {{is the process}} by which <b>scrap</b> <b>aluminium</b> can be reused in products after its initial production. The process involves simply re-melting the metal, which is far less expensive and energy-intensive than creating new aluminium through the electrolysis of aluminium oxide (23), which must first be mined from bauxite ore and then refined using the Bayer process. Recycling <b>scrap</b> <b>aluminium</b> requires only 5% of the energy used to make new aluminium. For this reason, approximately 31% of all aluminium produced in the United States comes from recycled scrap. Used beverage containers are the largest component of processed aluminum scrap, and most of it is manufactured back into aluminium cans.|$|R

40|$|Processing {{of waste}} {{created in the}} <b>aluminium</b> <b>scrap</b> {{recycling}} companies {{is one of the}} most challenging tasks due to its toxic nature. As aluminium recycling waste continues to accumulate, it is becoming a major problem for the environment. Useful utilisation of given waste is much more attractive and appropriate alternative than depositing it on the waste sites that is practicing all over the world. The main task of the present research is to investigate the possibility of non-waste utilization of aluminium recycling waste and reprocessing it into environmental friendly material. In the present studies, lightweight expanded clay aggregate were produced from natural plastic clay and aluminium waste coming from <b>aluminium</b> <b>scrap</b> recycling factories. Due to results obtained from chemical and mineralogical investigations of given waste, heat treatment in the temperature range from 1150 oC to 1280 oC was selected as appropriated method in order to eliminate impurities of residues, like ammonia. The phenomenon of gasses emission during the heat treatment of waste is used as initiator for creation of extra porous structure of sintered ceramic bodies. The effect of raw material composition, previous treatment of aluminium recycling waste and sintering temperatures on the aggregates properties were evaluate.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to review, and draw {{attention}} to, issues raised by the recycling of wrought aluminium from motor cars, even though the time horizon for significant arisings of such <b>aluminium</b> <b>scrap</b> is in the order of 20 years from now. Recycling of specific grades of wrought aluminium will be viable only when a means of positively identifying different types of scrap is available. A solution must be reliable, rapid, and low-cost; probably used in conjunction with a vehicle shredder. Such a system of identification will eliminate the need for costly hand-dismantling and segregation. Simple segregation of cast and wrought alloy will, however, be essential when wrought aluminium from car bodies dominates the scrap arisings. Such segregation will produce two high-value scrap products. The first of which will be similar to the A 380 casting alloy specification, maintaining the current supply of this scrap, and the second will be a composite of wrought alloys. These issues are relevant to the <b>aluminium</b> <b>scrap</b> industry, which will have to accommodate future changes in the composition of the scrap it receives, and the motor industry, which may adopt in-house recycling of wrought alloy in order to offset the high! purchase cost of aluminium...|$|E

40|$|A 356 {{is one of}} {{the widely}} used {{aluminium}} casting alloy that has been used in both sand and die casting processes. Large amounts of scrap metal can be generated from the runner systems and feeders. In addition, chips are generated in the machined parts. The surface area with regard to weight of chips is so high that it makes these scraps difficult to melt. Although there are several techniques evolved to remedy this problem, yet the problem lies in the quality of the recycled raw material. Since recycling of these scrap is quite important due to the advantages like energy saving and cost reduction in the final product, in this work, the recycling efficiency and casting quality were investigated. Three types of charges were prepared for casting: % 100 primary ingot, % 100 <b>scrap</b> <b>aluminium</b> and fifty-fifty <b>scrap</b> <b>aluminium</b> and primary ingot mixture were used. Melt quality was determined by calculating bifilm index by using reduced pressure test. Tensile test samples were produced by casting both from sand and die moulds. Relationship between bifilm index and tensile strength were determined as an indication of correlation of melt quality. It was found that untreated chips decrease the casting quality significantly. Therefore, prior to charging the chips into the furnace for melting, a series of cleaning processes has to be used in order to achieve good quality products...|$|R
