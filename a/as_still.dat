5|$|Almost {{forty years}} after the {{construction}} of Bletchley railway station, the 1884/5 Ordnance Survey shows Bletchley <b>as</b> <b>still</b> just a small village around the C of E church at Bletchley Park, and a hamlet near the Methodist chapel and Shoulder of Mutton public house at the junction of Shenley Road/Newton Road with Buckingham Road. (These districts are known today as Old Bletchley and Far Bletchley). The major settlement of the time is Fenny Stratford.|$|E
5|$|D'Abetot's widow Adeliza granted her dower {{lands in}} the county of Worcestershire to Beauchamp, which was {{confirmed}} by King Henry sometime between 1123 and 1129, although the document cannot be dated more precisely than that. In 1130, at Michaelmas, Henry allowed Beauchamp to not pay geld on his lands in Berkshire, and he is mentioned in the 1130 Pipe Roll <b>as</b> <b>still</b> living.|$|E

5|$|The {{alphabet}} {{was designed}} to be able to write all of the vowels used in the Received Pronunciation <b>as</b> <b>still</b> spoken in 19th century Utah. The vowel inventory has also been attributed to the fact that unlike other American pioneers, the Mormon pioneers were from New England as opposed to the American South. As such, many of the vowels in the Deseret alphabet have since merged in the modern era: they are no longer distinguished in many dialects of English.|$|E

5|$|To provide {{realistic}} bodies while {{preventing the}} corpses from moving, {{after a lengthy}} casting process the crew chose extras who could lie <b>as</b> <b>still</b> as possible. For the bath house owner Tsuyako Yamashita, this was not possible owing {{to the need to}} see her alive first, and a search for a body double was unfruitful. Ultimately, the crew used digital effects to transplant a still image of the actor during the character's funeral scene, allowing for a realistic effect.|$|E
5|$|S. Sivasekaram's 1980 Tamil poem Ahalikai {{examines}} the stone motif in Ahalya's tale: she marries {{a husband who}} is no more interested in her than a stone and briefly encounters joy with Indra, only to end up cursed to become a lifeless stone. The poet asks if it was better for Ahalya to remain physically a stone and retain her dignity rather than return to a stony marriage. Uyir Maga ("Life-woman") by the Tamil poet Na. Pichamurthy (1900–76) presents Ahalya as an allegorical representation of life, with Gautama as the mind and Indra pleasure. The Marxist critic Kovai Gnani, in his poem Kallihai, represents Ahalya as the oppressed class and Rama as an ideal future without exploitation. Gautama and Indra represent feudalism and capitalism. The character of Ahalya played by Kamala Kotnis in the 1949 movie Sati Ahalya ("chaste Ahalya") was described <b>as</b> <b>still</b> relevant by contemporary film critics due to its portrayal of the predicament of a stained woman.|$|E
5|$|The Mostyns' {{principal}} residence was Mostyn Hall in Flintshire and so {{the family}} rented out Plas Mawr to various tenants during the 18th and 19th centuries. In the 18th century the gatehouse {{was used as a}} courthouse and the main house as cheap housing. In the 19th century, parts of the house were converted into a school and space for other small businesses, as well <b>as</b> <b>still</b> being used for domestic accommodation: in 1881, the house had 25 residents. Minor changes were made to Plas Mawr in the process, such as the installation of partition walls to subdivide the larger rooms, but it remained largely intact. The Mostyns offered the house for sale in 1870, as part of a package of land including Bodysgallen Hall, but there were no offers.|$|E

This was the effect of the decision in the case of Fellows v. Blacksmith. The time for the surrender of the possession, according to their consent given in the treaty, had not expired when these taxes were levied. The period within which the removal was to take place, under the treaty of 1838, was five years from the time it went into effect. It was not proclaimed till 1840, and under that of 1842 the time did not expire till 1846. The taxation of the lands was premature and illegal.|$|E
