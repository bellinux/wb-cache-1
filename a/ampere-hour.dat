25|$|Meters which {{measured}} {{the amount of}} charge (coulombs) used, known as <b>ampere-hour</b> meters, {{were used in the}} early days of electrification. These were dependent upon the supply voltage remaining constant for accurate measurement of energy usage, which was not a likely circumstance with most supplies.

2500|$|In 1894 Oliver Shallenberger of the Westinghouse Electric Corporation {{applied the}} {{induction}} principle previously used [...] only in AC <b>ampere-hour</b> meters {{to produce a}} watt-hour meter of the modern electromechanical form, using an induction disk whose rotational speed was made proportional to the power in the circuit. The Bláthy meter was similar to Shallenberger and Thomson meter {{in that they are}} two-phase motor meter. Although the induction meter would only work on alternating current, it eliminated the delicate and troublesome commutator of the Thomson design. Shallenberger fell ill and was unable to refine his initial large and heavy design, although he did also develop a polyphase version.|$|E

2500|$|Electric {{charge is}} the {{physical}} property of matter that causes it {{to experience a}} force when placed in an electromagnetic field. There {{are two types of}} electric charges: positive and negative (commonly carried by protons and electrons respectively). Like charges repel and unlike attract. An absence of net charge is referred to as [...] An object is negatively charged if it has an excess of electrons, and is otherwise positively charged or uncharged. The SI derived unit of electric charge is the coulomb (C). In electrical engineering, it is also common to use the <b>ampere-hour</b> (Ah), and, in chemistry, it is common to use the elementary charge (e) as a unit. The symbol Q often denotes charge. Early knowledge of how charged substances interact is now called classical electrodynamics, and is still accurate for problems that don't require consideration of quantum effects.|$|E

Power was stored in a nine <b>ampere-hour,</b> 22-cell rechargeable super nickel-cadmium battery.|$|E
50|$|The {{energy content}} of a battery is usually {{expressed}} indirectly by its capacity in ampere-hours; to convert <b>ampere-hour</b> (A⋅h) to watt hours (W⋅h), the <b>ampere-hour</b> value must be multiplied by the voltage of the power source. This value is approximate, since the battery voltage is not constant during its discharge, and because higher discharge rates reduce {{the total amount of}} energy that the battery can provide. In the case of devices that output a different voltage than the battery, it is the battery voltage (typically 3.7 V for Li-ion) that must be used to calculate rather than the device output (for example, usually 5.0 V for USB portable chargers). This results in a 500 mA USB device running for about 3.7 hours on a 2500 mAh battery, not five hours.|$|E
50|$|Individual {{batteries}} are usually arranged into large battery packs of various voltage and <b>ampere-hour</b> capacity products {{to give the}} required energy capacity.

50|$|Some solar {{cars have}} complex data {{acquisition}} systems that monitor the whole electrical system, while basic cars show battery voltage and motor current.

Less capacity can be removed at higher discharge rates to the same termination voltage, which was 0. 50 volts for the weakest (lowest voltage) cell. The general trend of efficiencies increases as the charge rate increases as noted in results of the table included in the handout package. The data also indicate the efficiency increases as the discharge rate decreases.
