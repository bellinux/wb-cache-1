The experimental results verify the algorithm and the theoretical results by use of system identification techniques...|$|R

Derived from the Lavochkin La-150, the 152 used several different engines, but the program was canceled as other fighters with more powerful engines and swept wings showed more promise.|$|E

5|$|According to Melman, Abu Nidal had {{recommended}} Hindawi to Syrian intelligence.

It was sent to London in a diplomatic bag and given to Hindawi. According to Seale, it was widely believed that the attack {{was in response to}} Israel having forced down <b>a</b> <b>jet,</b> two months earlier, carrying Syrian officials to Damascus, which Israel had supposed was carrying senior Palestinians.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of its}} 1996 Pepsi Stuff {{marketing}} campaign, Pepsi ran {{an advertisement}} promising a Harrier jet to anyone who collected 7,000,000 Pepsi Points, a gag that backfired when a participant attempted {{to take advantage of}} the ability to buy additional points for 10 cents each to claim <b>a</b> <b>jet</b> for US$700,000. When Pepsi turned him down, a lawsuit ensued, in which the judge ruled that any reasonable person would conclude that the advertisement was a joke.|$|E
5|$|Contrails are a manmade type of cirrus cloud {{formed when}} water vapor from the exhaust of <b>a</b> <b>jet</b> engine {{condenses}} on particles, which come {{from either the}} surrounding air or the exhaust itself, and freezes, leaving behind a visible trail. The exhaust can also trigger the formation of cirrus by providing ice nuclei {{when there is an}} insufficient naturally-occurring supply in the atmosphere. One of the environmental impacts of aviation is that persistent contrails can form into large mats of cirrus, and increased air traffic has been implicated as one possible cause of the increasing frequency and amount of cirrus in Earth's atmosphere.|$|E

5|$|During the off-season, the Thrashers {{franchise}} {{was bought}} and relocated by True North Sports and Entertainment, becoming the Winnipeg Jets. Kane was enjoying a successful {{first season as}} <b>a</b> <b>Jet,</b> leading his team in scoring with 18 goals and 31 points by mid-January 2012. During that month, however, he was sidelined with a concussion that was reported on January 21. Later in the season, he recorded a four-point game (two goals and two assists) in a 7–0 win against the Florida Panthers on March 1, 2012. On September 15, 2012, Kane signed a six-year, $31.5 million contract extension with the Jets.|$|E
5|$|Hulk Hogan's visibly damaged eye was {{explained}} in the storyline {{as the result of}} Ted DiBiase hiring a group of men to attack Hogan before the match. In reality, the cause of injury has been open to debate. One theory is that Randy Savage punched Hogan because he believed that his ex-wife Elizabeth Hulette had an affair with Hogan while Savage and Hulette were married (the couple divorced in September 1992). WWF officials claimed that the injury was the result of <b>a</b> <b>Jet</b> Ski accident.|$|E
5|$|In 1944, Republic Aviation's chief designer, Alexander Kartveli, {{began working}} on a turbojet-powered {{replacement}} for the P-47 Thunderbolt piston-engined fighter. The initial attempts to redesign the P-47 to accommodate <b>a</b> <b>jet</b> engine proved futile due to the large cross-section of the early centrifugal compressor turbojets. Instead, Kartveli and his team designed a new aircraft with a streamlined fuselage largely occupied by an axial compressor turbojet engine and fuel stored in rather thick unswept wings.|$|E

5|$|In March 1945, Galland {{returned}} to operational flying and {{was permitted to}} form <b>a</b> <b>jet</b> fighter unit which he called Jagdverband 44.

Later, he {{returned to}} Germany and managed his own business. Galland also became friends with many former enemies, such as RAF aces Robert Stanford Tuck and Douglas Bader. Adolf Galland died on 9 February 1996.|$|E
5|$|In September 1944, Nowotny {{was made}} {{commander}} of a specialist unit dubbed Kommando Nowotny, flying the newly developed Messerschmitt Me 262 out of airfields near Osnabrück. The unit {{not only had}} to contend with the enemy, but also with working through the 'teething' phase of the Me 262and developing the tactics appropriate for <b>a</b> <b>jet</b> unit. On 7 October, Nowotny downed a B-24 Liberator bomber, his first aerial victory on the Western Front.|$|E
5|$|In late January 1951, the Air Force told Davis {{it wanted}} to rotate {{him back to the}} United States. By this point, Davis held every record for <b>a</b> <b>jet</b> pilot, {{including}} most victories in all types of aircraft, most MiGs destroyed and most victories over propeller-driven aircraft. Other pilots indicated they wanted him to stay in Korea, considering him to be an able and effective leader. However, the Air Force determined it had no capable replacement who could command Davis' squadron.|$|E

5|$|Obsidian is an action-adventure {{computer}} {{game for the}} Amstrad CPC personal computer published by Artic Computing in 1986. The game is set on the titular space station located within the centre of an asteroid, which {{is out of control}} and drifting towards a black hole. The player must guide an astronaut with <b>a</b> <b>jet</b> pack around the station and re-activate its engine shields to prevent the Obsidian's destruction. This involves collecting items and using them to solve puzzles, while avoiding the Obsidian's reactivated security systems.|$|E
5|$|Obsidian is an action-adventure {{presented}} in two dimensions, spread across approximately 50 game screens. Locations contrast between spaceship interior and rock surfaces. Players control <b>a</b> <b>jet</b> pack wearing astronaut who must deactivate the five engines of the titular spacestation Obsidian, {{which is located}} in the hollow centre carved out of an asteroid. Objects are stored in gravity boxes on the station's ceilings, only one object can be held at a time. These are used to solve the game's puzzles and allow the player to continue further into the game. Each object's purpose must be discovered as they are not labelled.|$|E
5|$|Pilotwings 64 is a 3D amateur flight {{simulator}} {{that puts the}} player in control of one of six pilots {{as they try to}} earn pilot licenses through various forms of aviation.

The game also puts focus on allowing the player to freely explore its detailed 3D environments, most notably a miniature representation of the United States.|$|E
