5|$|The final victim, {{killed on}} 31 October 1828, was Margaret Docherty, a middle-aged Irish woman. Burke lured {{her into the}} Broggan lodging house by {{claiming}} {{that his mother was}} also a Docherty from the same area of Ireland, and the pair began drinking. At one point Burke left Docherty in the company of Helen McDougal while he went out, ostensibly to buy more whisky, but actually to get Hare. Two other lodgers—Ann and James Gray—were <b>an</b> <b>inconvenience</b> to the men, so they paid them to stay at Hare's lodging for the night, claiming Docherty was a relative. The drinking continued into the evening, by which time Margaret Hare had joined in. At around 9:00pm the Grays returned briefly to collect some clothing for their children, and saw Burke, Hare, their wives and Docherty all drunk, singing and dancing. Although Burke and Hare came to blows {{at some point in the}} evening, they subsequently murdered Docherty, and put her body in a pile of straw at the end of the bed.|$|E
5|$|With iOS 10.2.1, Apple made {{improvements}} to reduce occurrences of unexpected shutdowns {{that a small}} number of users were experiencing with their iPhone. iOS 10.2.1 already has over 50% of active iOS devices upgraded and the diagnostic data we've received from upgraders shows that for this small percentage of users experiencing the issue, we're seeing a more than 80% reduction in iPhone 6s and over 70% reduction on iPhone 6 of devices unexpectedly shutting down. We also added the ability for the phone to restart without needing to connect to power, if a user still encounters an unexpected shutdown. It {{is important to note that}} these unexpected shutdowns are not a safety issue, but we understand it can be <b>an</b> <b>inconvenience</b> and wanted to fix the issue as quickly as possible. If a customer has any issues with their device they can contact AppleCare.|$|E

50|$|The GWR and the LSWR {{lines were}} of course on {{different}} track gauges, and a transfer shed was built between the routes; it was {{provided with a}} siding for each gauge, and goods were unloaded from one wagon and transferred to another for onward transit. This was <b>a</b> considerable <b>inconvenience.</b> <b>A</b> covered footbridge was provided between the two passenger stations, as passengers required to change trains.|$|R

25|$|The city grew as the {{population}} did, coming up against the lake's waters. As {{the depth of the}} lake water fluctuated, Mexico City was subject to periodic flooding. A major labor draft, the desagüe, compelled thousands of Indians over the colonial period to work on infrastructure to prevent flooding. Floods were not only <b>an</b> <b>inconvenience</b> but also a health hazard, since during flood periods human waste polluted the city's streets. By draining the area, the mosquito population dropped as did the frequency of the diseases they spread. However, draining the wetlands also changed the habitat for fish and birds and the areas accessible for Indian cultivation close to the capital.|$|E
25|$|In 1898, the Holmenkollen Line {{was opened}} {{as a light}} rail between Majorstuen to Holmenkollen. The {{terminus}} at Majorstuen was <b>an</b> <b>inconvenience</b> for passengers as most people were bound for the city center and had to change to the street trams. For the operator Holmenkolbanen, there were two ways to solve the issue. They could sign trackage rights with Kristiania Elektriske Sporvei to use the Briskeby Line to reach the city center. Alternatively, a tunnel could be built to an underground station in the city center. Applications for a tunnel {{were sent to the}} municipality in 1901. However, disagreements as to whether the tunnel was to be considered a railway or tramway halted progress; the city considered the line a tramway while the company considered it to be a railway.|$|E
25|$|The {{initial cost}} of an {{incandescent}} bulb is small compared {{to the cost of}} the energy it uses over its lifetime. Incandescent bulbs have a shorter life than most other lighting, an important factor if replacement is inconvenient or expensive. Some types of lamp, including incandescent and fluorescent, emit less light as they age; this may be <b>an</b> <b>inconvenience,</b> or may reduce effective lifetime due to lamp replacement before total failure. A comparison of incandescent lamp operating cost with other light sources must include illumination requirements, cost of the lamp and labor cost to replace lamps (taking into account effective lamp lifetime), cost of electricity used, effect of lamp operation on heating and air conditioning systems. When used for lighting in houses and commercial buildings, the energy lost to heat can significantly increase the energy required by a building's air conditioning system. During the heating season heat produced by the bulbs is not wasted, although in most cases it is more cost effective to obtain heat from the heating system. Regardless, {{over the course of a}} year a more efficient lighting system saves energy in nearly all climates.|$|E

25|$|A {{full face}} mask is lighter and more {{comfortable}} for swimming than a helmet or band mask, and usually provides an improved field of vision, {{but it is not}} as secure, and does not provide the same level of protection as the heavier and more sturdily constructed equipment. The two types of equipment have different ranges of application. Most {{full face mask}}s are adaptable for use with scuba or surface supply. The full face mask does not usually have a bailout block fitted, and this is usually attached to the diver's harness, with a single hose to supply the mask from main or bailout gas which is selected at the block. The strap arrangement for full face masks is usually quite secure, but not as secure as a bandmask or helmet, and it is possible for it to be dislodged in the water. However it is also quite practicable for a trained diver to replace and clear a full face mask under water without assistance, so this is more <b>an</b> <b>inconvenience</b> than a disaster unless the diver is rendered unconscious at the same time.|$|E
500|$|Although Gizmodo {{concluded}} {{it to be}} [...] "our favorite MacBook to date," [...] {{they did}} claim, at this time, its display was inferior to that found on the MacBook Pro and MacBook Air, alleging a smaller viewing angle, washed-out colors, and dimmer backlighting. Similarly, AppleInsider and Engadget concluded it [...] "may well be Apple's best MacBook to date" [...] and [...] "these are terrific choices—not only from an industrial design standpoint, but in specs as well" [...] respectively, while also drawing attention to a lower quality display {{as compared with the}} MacBook Pro and MacBook Air. Charlie Sorrel of Wired News reached a similar conclusion about the MacBook display, citing its poor contrast and lack of vertical angle in comparison with the MacBook Pro and even the older white MacBook. Peter Cohen wrote an article discussing the loss of the FireWire port for Macworld, saying [...] "The absence of FireWire ports is certainly <b>an</b> <b>inconvenience</b> for some users. But it shouldn’t be considered a deal-breaker for most of us, anyway." ...|$|E
500|$|As Harner {{did for the}} Northcott role, Amy Ryan auditioned via {{tape for}} the role of Carol Dexter. She cited the filming of a fight scene during which Eastwood showed her [...] "how to throw a movie punch" [...] as her {{favorite}} moment of the production. Michael Kelly portrays Detective Lester Ybarra, who is a composite of several people from the historical record. Kelly was chosen based on a taped audition; he worked around scheduling conflicts with the television series Generation Kill, which he was filming in Africa at the same time. Geoff Pierson plays Sammy Hahn, a defense attorney known for taking high-profile cases. He represents Collins and in doing so plants the seeds for overturning [...] "Code 12" [...] internments, used by police to jail or commit those deemed difficult or <b>an</b> <b>inconvenience.</b> Code 12 was often used to commit women without due process. Colm Feore portrays Chief of Police James E. Davis, whose backstory was changed from that of his historical counterpart. Reed Birney plays Mayor George E. Cryer; Denis O'Hare plays composite character Doctor Jonathan Steele; Gattlin Griffith plays Walter Collins; and Devon Conti plays his supplanter, Arthur Hutchins. Eddie Alderson plays Northcott's nephew and accomplice, Sanford Clark.|$|E

2500|$|In 1902, {{there were}} protests when the Louisiana {{legislature}} mandated that public transportation must enforce racial segregation. [...] At first this was objected to by both {{white and black}} riders as <b>an</b> <b>inconvenience,</b> and by the streetcar companies on grounds of both added expense and the difficulties of determining the racial background of some New Orleanians.|$|E
2500|$|The devil first {{appeared}} on the crest in 1940 because of the popular belief that the players [...] "played like devils" [...] on the field. During Gabriel Ochoa Uribe's twelve years with the institution, the devil was always <b>an</b> <b>inconvenience</b> for him so it was removed for religious reasons. For this reason, the crest only carried the number of stars or titles obtained by the club.|$|E
2500|$|Before the {{invention}} of audio delay technology, music employing a delayed echo had to be recorded in a naturally reverberant space, often <b>an</b> <b>inconvenience</b> for musicians and engineers. The popularity of an easy-to-implement real-time echo effect led {{to the production of}} systems offering an all-in-one effects unit that could be adjusted to produce echoes of any interval or amplitude. The presence of multiple [...] "taps" [...] (playback heads) made it possible to have delays at varying rhythmic intervals; this allowed musicians an additional means of expression over natural periodic echoes.|$|E
50|$|This {{progress}} was clearly inadequate, for {{the line was}} still a 3 ft 6in gauge plateway, and transshipment at Lydney to the main line railway was <b>an</b> expensive <b>inconvenience,</b> while other branch lines were operating, or being planned, offering direct interchange.|$|R

2500|$|In {{the first}} decade of postage stamps' {{existence}} (depending on the country), stamps were issued without perforations. Scissors or other cutting mechanisms were required to separate a desired number of stamps from a full sheet. If cutting tools were not used, individual stamps were torn off. [...] This is evidenced by the ragged edges of surviving examples. Mechanically separating stamps from a sheet proved <b>an</b> <b>inconvenience</b> for postal clerks and businesses, both dealing with large numbers of individual stamps on a daily basis. By 1850, methods such as rouletting wheels were being devised in efforts of making stamp separation more convenient, and less time consuming.|$|E
2500|$|Prentiss and McCabe {{often find}} {{themselves}} working on behalf of two rival clients, {{one of whom is}} often the shadier side of the Labour Government, often called their [...] "Downing Street Retainer". This is usually something of <b>an</b> <b>inconvenience</b> as Prentiss is met by Archie Hilditch (Tony Gardner, Alex Lowe), a faceless member of the Government, in a deserted location (such as Frank Dobson's campaign headquarters), and told he needs to ruin the popularity of the organisation that he has spent half the programme building up. For example, in one episode they're employed by the government to increase the popularity of the European Union, while also being employed by the Eurosceptic newspaper The Sun to increase sales. It is probably a good thing in the end, as the firm relies on these payments since neither Prentiss nor McCabe seems to want to do any real work.|$|E
