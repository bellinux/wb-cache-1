40|$|All {{turbofan}} engines work on {{the same}} principle. A large fan {{at the front of}} the engine draws air in. A portion of the air enters the compressor, but a greater portion passes on the outside of the engine this is called bypass air. The air that enters the compressor then passes through several stages of rotating fan blades that compress the air more, and then it passes into the combustor. In the combustor, fuel is injected into the airstream, and the fuel-air mixture is ignited. The hot gasses produced expand rapidly to the rear, and the engine reacts by moving forward. If there is a flaw in the system, such as an unexpected obstruction, the fan blade can break, spin off, and harm other engine components. <b>Fan</b> <b>casings,</b> therefore, need to be strong enough to contain errant blades and damage-tolerant to withstand the punishment of a loose blade-turned-projectile. NASA has spearheaded research into improving jet engine <b>fan</b> <b>casings,</b> ultimately discovering a cost-effective approach to manufacturing damage-tolerant fan cases that also boast significant weight reduction. In an aircraft, weight reduction translates directly into fuel burn savings, increased payload, and greater aircraft range.

50|$|The {{centrifugal}} fan uses the centrifugal power supplied from {{the rotation of}} impellers to increase the kinetic energy of air/gases. When the impellers rotate, the gas particles near the impellers are thrown-off from the impellers, then moves into the <b>fan</b> <b>casing.</b> As a result, the kinetic energy of gas is measured as pressure because of the system resistance offered by the casing and duct. The gas is then guided to the exit via outlet ducts. After the gas is thrown-off, the gas pressure in the middle region of the impellers decreases. The gas from the impeller eye rushes in to normalize this. This cycle repeats and therefore the gas can be continuously transferred.|$|R

40|$|Three {{effective}} inlet cleanup {{methods are}} described. A flared reverse cone inlet {{is used to}} eliminate wakes from the <b>fan</b> <b>casings</b> and/or probe supports.

40|$|This study {{describes}} {{the assessment of}} a novel methodology that the authors recently proposed for the early detection of stall in low-speed axial-flow fans. Because aerodynamic stall is a major potential cause of mechanical failure in axial fans, effective stall-warning techniques have had wide application for many years.

40|$|International audienceReducing the {{clearances}} between rotating {{and fixed}} parts {{is an important}} factor in increasing the performances of turbomachines. The physical counterpart however is an evolution in possible rotor-stator contacts capable of causing unstable dynamic behavior. A proper prediction of the rotor-stator contact occurrences and associated induced phenomena, has therefore become of a great interest for aero-engine mechanical engineers. Most numerical simulations involving rotor-stator contact can be divided into two types of physical behavior. The first focuses on contact induced blade/casing interactions, in only taking into account the blades and casing flexibility. The second type of behavior takes into account the shaft dynamic while neglecting blade flexibility. Future designs of aircraft engines will however raise the need to combine these two types of models. Since, the structural components are more flexible, the dynamic coupling between engine modules is increased. This paper proposes a study based on a structure representative of the whole aircraft engine, including the contacts that may arise between the fan-blade tips and <b>fan</b> <b>casing.</b> We have introduced a fully-coupled phenomenological model with flexible blades, shaft and casing. Furthermore, this model includes an elastic link between shaft and casing to simulate the fan frame behavior. We begin by explaining the linear results, which highlight the dynamic couplings between these various model components. During a second step, this paper presents the nonlinear results obtained by introducing a contact law. These results demonstrate the influence of the whole engine dynamic on contact-related behavior with special focus on the system dynamic stability...|$|R
40|$|Aircraft {{propulsion}} {{will continue}} to rely on gas turbine technology for the next decades to come. Thus, to achieve environmental agreements, ensure engine safety and retain economic competitiveness, ongoing development with a multidisciplinary design approach is indispensable. In the present study the multi criteria analysis of the fan, a decisive component in modern aero engines, is examined. In particular {{the interaction of the}} fan blades with the <b>fan</b> <b>casing</b> is analyzed and an appropriate design approach including automatic optimization is used. As one part of the disciplines conjunction an automated aeroacoustic approach is realized. The aerodynamic and acoustic fitness functions and constraints are based on Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulations of the fan stage. A fast analytical prediction tool for fan noise, PropNoise, which has been under development since recent years and already validated on several test cases, is used. Preliminary {{studies have shown that the}} flow in the rotor tip region is a major contributor to the broadband noise emission. Based on this, the optimization process focuses on the variation of the casing contour around the fan blades. The impact of the modified flow field in the rotor tip region concerning the aeroelastic behavior is also investigated. As aeroelastic evaluation requires a high level of know-how and is very time consuming, it is linked to the optimization process chain by a discrete evaluation of selected members. This allows a simultaneous adjustment of the design in case of aeroelastic issues. Furthermore, the impact of the fan modifications regarding the overall engine performance is evaluated. Off-design cycle calculations allow incorporating such detailed studies in a global engine optimization...|$|R
40|$|Detailed flow {{behavior}} in a modern transonic fan with a composite sweep is investigated in this paper. Both unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (URANS) and Large Eddy Simulation (LES) methods are applied to investigate the flow field over a wide operating range. The calculated flow fields are compared with the data from an array of high-frequency response pressure transducers embedded in the <b>fan</b> <b>casing.</b> The current study shows that a relatively fine computational grid is required to resolve the flow field adequately and to calculate the pressure rise across the fan correctly. The calculated flow field shows detailed flow structure near the fan rotor tip region. Due {{to the introduction of}} composite sweep toward the rotor tip, the flow structure at the rotor tip is much more stable compared to that of the conventional blade design. The passage shock stays very close to the leading edge at the rotor tip even at the throttle limit. On the other hand, the passage shock becomes stronger and detaches earlier from the blade passage at the radius where the blade sweep is in the opposite direction. The interaction between the tip clearance vortex and the passage shock becomes intense as the fan operates toward the stall limit, and tip clearance vortex breakdown occurs at near-stall operation. URANS calculates the time-averaged flow field fairly well. Details of measured RMS static pressure are not calculated with sufficient accuracy with URANS. On the other hand, LES calculates details of the measured unsteady flow features in the current transonic fan with composite sweep fairly well and reveals the flow mechanism behind the measured unsteady flow field...|$|R
40|$|Stall-induced {{vibration}} places fundamental {{limitations on}} industrial fan performance and remains a persistent {{problem in the}} development of industrial fans and compressors. In this paper, we present an experimental programme that utilised two strategies to study rotating stall recovery patterns in an industrial fan. The experimental facility incorporated a fan with both variable pitch in motion blades and a variable speed drive. The facility enabled us first, to study the evolution of unsteady pressure signals on the <b>fan</b> <b>casing</b> whilst varying <b>fan</b> blade pitch and then to examine varying fan rotational speed. Consequently, we were able to recover a fan from stall either by varying blade pitch at constant speed, or by varying speed at constant blade pitch. We also studied the physical flow phenomena associated with stall recovery by cross-correlating signals from circumferentially offset high frequency response pressure transducers and then analysed the cross-spectra. This enabled us to gain insight into the transient fluid flow behaviour associated with stall recovery in the studied industrial fan class. The transient fluid flow behaviour associated with stall recovery by varying blade pitch was indicative of both a mild and progressive transition. In contrast, stall recovery by varying fan speed occurred more suddenly. In comparison with the variable pitch transition, the variable speed transition was more indicative of recovery from mild surge. From this we may conclude that stall recovery via variable speed resulted in significantly higher unsteady mechanical stress induced in fan rotating components than recovery via variable pitch. Higher bending stresses in the fan blades are more likely to result in mechanical failure, and therefore we may conclude that the studied fan is more ‘stall tolerant’ when one operates it as a variable pitch fan rather than as a variable speed fan...|$|R
