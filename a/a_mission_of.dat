5|$|When World War I began, Macmillan {{looked for}} peace {{activism}} {{on the part}} of NUWSS. Instead, she found a majority of British women were in favour of helping the men win the war.

5|$|A {{number of}} {{unsuccessful}} searches {{were carried out}} in Cabo Rojo by an urban militia led by Captain Carlos de Espada, and additional searches were made in San Germán. On May 23, 1824, the Mayagüez military commander prepared two vessels {{and sent them to}} Pedernales in response to reported sightings of Cofresí. Rivas and the military captain of Mayagüez, Cayetano Castillo y Picado, boarded a ship commanded by Sergeant Sebastián Bausá. Sailor Pedro Alacán, best known as the grandfather of Ramón Emeterio Betances and a neighbor of Cofresí, was captain of the second schooner. The expedition failed, only finding a military deserter named Manuel Fernández de Córdova. Also known as Manuel Navarro, Fernández was connected to Cofresí through Lucas Branstan (a merchant from Trieste who was involved in Bonne Sophie incident). In the meantime, the pirates fled toward southern Puerto Rico. Poorly supplied after his hasty retreat, Cofresí docked at Jobos Bay on June 2, 1824; about a dozen pirates invaded the hacienda of Francisco Antonio Ortiz, stealing his cattle. The group then broke into a second estate, owned by Jacinto Texidor, stole plantains and resupplied their ship. It is now believed that Juan José Mateu gave the pirates refuge in one of his haciendas, near Jobos Bay. The next day the news reached Guayama mayor Francisco Brenes, who quickly contacted the military and requested operations by land and sea. He was told that there were not enough weapons in the municipality for <b>a</b> <b>mission</b> <b>of</b> that scale. Brenes then requested supplies from Patillas, which rushed him twenty guns.|$|E

Walternate promises that Peter will face the same pain and suffering he has faced since crossing to the prime universe on <b>a</b> <b>mission</b> <b>of</b> mercy, one piece at a time.

5|$|In {{addition}} to the unrest in Sicily, a wave of rioting spread through Italy in August 1893, triggered by {{the killing of a}} number of migrant workers in the salt pans of Aigues Mortes in southern France escalated into a more generalized working-class revolt supported by anarchists and violent riots in Rome and Naples. Italy seemed to be slipping to a revolution. By the time Crispi returned to power in December 1893, Italy appeared to many to be on the brink of collapse. Crispi promised important measures of land reform for the near future. He was not blind to the misery and the need for social reform. Before 1891 he had been the patron of the Sicilian working-class and many of their associations had been named after him. Colajanni, the chief architect of Giolitti’s fall by exposing the Banca Romana scandal, was first offered the Ministry of Agriculture, which he refused, then sent to Sicily on <b>a</b> <b>mission</b> <b>of</b> appeasement.|$|E
5|$|In early 1945 Gjems-Onstad {{took part}} in blowing up railway tracks on the {{stretches}} around Støren Station, but the group had a limited supply of explosives, and the practical effects of the bombings could thus not cause as much effect as wanted. They could for instance not go through with blowing up the railway bridge near Hovin, which they sought as their main target. He was transferred back to Stockholm in March 1945, and Durham was dissolved. He reacted with shock that London had {{decided that it was}} too dangerous for him to return to Trondheim. He was uneasy about being set on the sideline, and headed <b>a</b> <b>mission</b> <b>of</b> four men from Stockholm to Namsvatnet {{at the end of the}} month to receive British sabotage supplies.
