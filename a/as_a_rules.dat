50|$|Lacey {{also served}} <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>rules</b> official, {{and in that}} {{capacity}} {{was involved in a}} controversial ruling during the final round of the 1958 Masters Tournament. He allowed Arnold Palmer, who was in strong contention, to play two balls when Palmer's tee shot plugged in wet turf on the 12th hole. Palmer's original attempt from the plugged lie gave him a double bogey, while he made a par with his second ball after taking a free drop, which he had had to argue with Lacey to obtain. Palmer's actual score on the hole would be decided after further discussion. Bobby Jones ruled half an hour later that Palmer's par would count, and Palmer went on to win, ahead of a bitter Ken Venturi, who as Palmer's playing partner lost his composure when Palmer received the favourable ruling. The incident has been debated heavily in golf circles ever since.|$|E

He began a column on FoxSports.com and started to provide commentary during Fox Sports football telecasts. During Week 1 of the 2010 NFL season, Pereira correctly predicted that referee Gene Steratore would rule {{what appeared to be a}} game-winning catch by Calvin Johnson as incomplete. [...] "That was my first real time of being put on the spot", Pereira would later say. [...] "I was worried to death that the referee was going to say it's a touchdown and I'd be out of a job in one week... It validated my role as to being able to go on and explain things so people could understand why a decision was made on the field. Then at that point on, I got more air time." [...] Pereira is also a frequent guest on KNBR during football season.|$|E
50|$|Following the bankruptcy, WEG was {{merged with}} French company Yeti, a {{subsidiary}} of Humanoids Publishing. Most of WEG's earlier licenses were terminated at this point, but the reconstituted company acquired another one from DC Comics. This license resulted in a new Legend System game, the DC Universe Roleplaying Game, which released a few titles from 1999 until 2001. As Humanoids Publishing was {{the publisher of the}} Metabarons graphic novels, they utilized the D6 System to release an RPG based upon that setting. Ron Fricke and former WEG publisher Scott Palter's Psibertroopers, the first licensed third party D6 System product, also saw release during this period. Humanoids began the process of releasing PDF format versions of many of the earlier WEG titles, converting some to the D6 System in the process. Humanoids released a PDF version of the Shatterzone Universe Guide containing an early version of D6 Space Opera. An initial PDF version of D6 Adventure was released <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>rules</b> lead in for the eventual re-release of Bloodshadows.|$|E
50|$|First and {{foremost}} Porter was known <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>rules</b> expert. For {{most of his}} 18 years as executive secretary of the Federation, Porter was the only executive employee and {{spent much of his}} time editing the various sport rule books and speaking to various groups about rules. One particular goal of Porter and the Federation was to forge a joint rule code with the NCAA in football, like the one that had long been in effect in basketball. With Porter as editor, the Federation had written its own football code in 1932 after the NCAA rebuffed the Federation's request for representation on the national rules committee. Efforts to resolve differences with the NCAA failed again in 1936, but in 1947 the parties seemed ready to make another attempt. After {{more than a year of}} often acrimonious discussions, the two groups agreed to final language in the summer of 1948, only to have the NCAA pull out of the project after the NFHS had already gone to print with its edition of the joint code.|$|E

40|$|Clinical {{guidelines}} form {{an important}} component of improving the quality of care and patient outcomes. We are exploring approaches to encode high-quality evidence-based text guidelines as computer implementable specifications. An architecture that includes components such <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>rules</b> engine that executes declarative if-then rules, an OWL-based classification engine that performs classification and subsumption inferences on an object oriented information model/ontology and a data repository storing patient data is presented. Some design choices and trade-offs we explore in this paper are: (a) Decomposition of a clinical guideline into decisions, actions, patient state transitions and definitions; (b) Use of an ontology engine for definition management; (c) Use of a rules engine for guideline management; and (d) Representation of definitions as OWL-axioms or if-then rules based on the expressiveness of these formalisms; and (e) Issues of ongoing maintenance and consistency checking as definitions and clinical guidelines change over time. We discuss how our architecture makes the creation and maintenance of implementable specifications a more tractable process...|$|E

The problem of the recognition of verb discontinuous constituents in Czech is also approached and obtained statistical data are presented. 1 Introduction For various applications in the field of natural language processing it is necessary to have rules capable to recognize and analyze reliably the verb groups in texts. The previous attempts to build the rules describing Czech verb constituents have been based rather on the introspective approach, which can hardly cover all the relevant cases occurring in the corpus texts. # This research has been partially supported by the Czech Ministry of Educat [...] ...|$|E
