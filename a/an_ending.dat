5|$|In a {{scene in}} the episode, Homer and Bart exit the Magic Palace's gift shop, only {{to end up in}} another gift shop. The scene was based on an {{experience}} of the episode's show runner Mike Scully, who, in order to exit the Lance Burton Theatre after a magic show, had to pass through a gift shop. The ending scene of the episode went through several changes and was as a result completed late in the episode's production. The writers had conceived the courtroom scene, but they were stuck {{trying to come up with}} <b>an</b> <b>ending</b> after Skinner had been shot. They eventually decided that the trial was a scam staged by the townspeople, and Simpsons writer George Meyer pitched the surfing scene that closed the episode.|$|E

5|$|In {{producing}} the series, Maiellaro crudely designed the characters as a cost-cutting measure; {{the series is}} animated by Radical Axis. He intended for the series to lack continuity starting from the pilot, but established a serial format after starting the second episode. He had constructed <b>an</b> <b>ending</b> for the series {{as well as a}} detailed map of characters; however, the series finale concluded differently from planned. Maiellaro cast people around his office for the characters, starring himself as the protagonist and Nine Pound Hammer vocalist Scott Luallen as the voice of Roostre; the band also performs the opening theme.|$|E

5|$|At first, {{the game}} was titled Parasite, and {{was meant to be}} {{unrelated}} to the Infinity series, but when development began in May 2003, it was codenamed Project Infinity 3. In September of the same year, they added the subtitle The Age of Infinity. Development was troubled by creative differences between Nakazawa and Uchikoshi; Nakazawa was unhappy with Uchikoshi's idea for the game's ending, and had a different ending in mind, which they were having disagreements over. They also did not have the time to write everything that they had wanted, so they ended up with <b>an</b> <b>ending</b> that Uchikoshi described as only being half-finished. At the time of the game's release, a sequel was planned, which would have included a conclusion to the game's story. In 2013, Uchikoshi looked back on the game, saying that while {{he would have liked to}} rewrite some portions of the scenario that he felt were boring or that did not advance the story much, he would not have changed or added anything in terms of the content of the game; he felt that his ending was still in the story, and still felt happy with it.|$|E
