Attrition wear between occlusal teeth causes large damage to dental enamel. Previous research indicated that attrition wear was reduced in acidic environment; however, the wear mechanism was not clear yet. Understanding the wear mechanism {{may be helpful to}} prevent attrition wear thus is of great importance. The third molars extracted from dentist, after appropriate sterilizing, were used in this research. Attrition wear of dental enamel in citric acid, lactic acid and acetic acid and the influence of these acids were investigated. FIB/FESEM was firstly applied to observe the subsurface of dental enamel after attrition wear with <b>acids.</b> <b>Cracks</b> were found developing along the inter-rod under the surface due to dissolution function of acids. Hydroxyapatite near inter-rod region was found easier to be influenced by acids in this research. Through the nano-indentation test, the hardness and Young&# 146;s modulus of surface enamel was found quickly reduced in acidic environment. Comparing the results with the data from previous research, the wear mechanism of attrition in acidic environment was thought to be different with the wear mechanism in distilled water. The wear mechanism of attrition in acidic environment in acidic environment was majorly dominated by ploughing off the top softened layer, leading to a considerably smooth surface, thus reducing the wear rate...|$|R

As pre-treatments, the chemical precipitation with different reagents (lime, alum and iron chloride salts), the <b>acid</b> <b>cracking</b> (AC) with salt addition and the granular activated carbon (GAC) adsorption were selected. The best removal efficiencies in terms of COD, total polyphenols (TP), lipids and total suspended solids (TSS) were determined.

The objectives of this research were to study an effect of biobased-catalyst which is used as supporting catalyst in simultaneous ozonolysis and transesterification for biodiesel synthesis and to study the effect of two steps process in biodiesel synthesis. The bio-based catalyst used in this process was empty palm bunch ash which was used as supporting catalyst for KOH. Two steps reaction were designed, {{the first step was}} run in a reactor at 30 °C with a continuous supply of ozone gas for 3 hours to cleave the unsaturated fatty acids at the double bonds. The second step was a follow up process after the first step without a supply of ozone gas, the temperature was increased up to 60 °C and the reaction continue for two hours. The second step aimed to convert saturated fatty acid which was not yet fully converted at the first step. Results of this study showed that 1. 5 % of KOH gave better performance in producing short chain methyl esters compared to 1 % of KOH in the first step process at various percent weight of ash. The highest short chain methyl esters and long chain methyl esters produced in the first step process were 85. 722 mg/liter and 655. 286 mg/liter respectively, which was used 17. 3 weight % ash and 1. 5 weight % KOH. Short chain methyl esters were produced as a result of unsaturated fatty <b>acid</b> <b>cracked</b> by ozonolysis. It is confirmed that a simultaneous ozonolysis and transesterification occurred in the first step process. In conclusion, the presence of bio-based catalyst as supporting catalyst for KOH to produce higher total methyl esters has been effective. The second step process in this experiment was not effective since the effect of reaction time can enhance the hydrolysis of esters as a reverse reaction of transesterification, resulted in loss of esters...|$|R

Preparation of such a membrane is technically very difficult due to the limitations that the {{high temperature}} places on materials selection. We have prepared high temperature membranes as thin film composites of a porous Blackglas{trademark} support and a carbon molecular sieve selective film. Porous Blackglail{trademark} supports have been prepared by pyrolysis of a formed mixture of Blackglas{trademark} B-staged precursor and short Carbon fibers. Such supports have the necessary smoothness for use as a membrane support, good mechanical properties, and an appropriate pore size distribution. These supports can be made either in flat sheet form or in a tubular configuration. A carbon molecular sieve layer can be added to the support by repeated coating/pyrolysis with a dilute solution of precursor polymer. The preferred precursors are polyimide or polyamic <b>acid.</b> <b>Crack</b> formation is observed after the first pyrolyses, but these cracks are repaired during later pyrolyses. The final membrane thickness is only 2. 5 {mu}m.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (p. 99 - 102). Increasingly stringent {{legislation has}} been applied to transportation fuels to minimise or eliminate aromatics and sulphur compounds in diesel fuel. This has led to manufacturers determining alternative production methods to comply to legislation. Part of the current diesel fuel is being produced by hydrocracking heavier fractions derived from crude oil. These hydrocracking processes utilise bi-functional catalysts which have a metal (hydrogenating/dehydrogenating) function and an <b>acid</b> (<b>cracking)</b> function. The most common of these hydrocracking catalysts are combinations of either noble metals and acid zeolites, such as Pt/ HY, or combined sulphides of group VIA and VIIIA metals on amorphous acidic supports, such as CoMo/SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3. For good quality diesel, the fuel should have a high cetane number and the aromatics and sulphur content should also be kept to a. minimum (e. g. EU legislation: sulphur content must be below 10 ppm (wt) by 2008). Fischer-Tropsch wax is made up predominantly of long-chain linear paraffins with exceptionally low aromatics and heteroatom content (sulphur and nitrogen-containing compounds) and therefore a good source for very 'clean', good quality diesel. The objective of this study was therefore to investigate the suitability of a conventional bi-functional hydrocracking catalyst namely, CoMo/SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3 in unsulphided form for the hydrocracking of Fischer-Tropsch wax using n-tetradecane as a model compound. The purpose of using the catalyst in unsulphided form was not to introduce any sulphur to the already sulphur-free feedstock...|$|E
40|$|The olive-oil {{extraction}} {{industry is}} an economically important activity for many {{countries of the}} Mediterranean Sea area, with Spain, Greece and Italy being the major producers. This activity, however, may represent a serious environmental problem due to the discharge of highly polluted effluents, usually referred to as 'olive mill wastewaters' (OMWs). They are characterized by high values of chemical oxygen demand (COD) (80 - 300 g/L), lipids, total polyphenols (TPP), tannins and other substances difficult to degrade. An adequate treatment before discharging is therefore required to reduce the pollutant load. The aim of the present paper was to evaluate performances of a biological process in a sequencing batch reactor (SBR) fed with pre-treated OMWs. Pretreatment consisted of a combined <b>acid</b> <b>cracking</b> (AC) and granular activated carbon (GAC) adsorption process. The efficiency of the system was {{compared with that of}} an identical SBR fed with the raw wastewater only diluted. Combined AC and GAC adsorption was chosen to be used prior to the following biological process due to its capability of providing high removal efficiencies of COD and TPP and also appreciable improvement of biodegradability. Comparing results obtained with different influents showed that best performances of the SBR were obtained by feeding it with raw diluted OMWs (dOMWs) and at the lowest dilution ratio (1 : 25) : in this case, the removal efficiencies were 90 and 76 %, as average, for COD and TPP, respectively. Feeding the SBR with either the pre-treated or the raw dOMWs at 1 : 50 gave very similar values of COD reduction (74 %); however, an improvement of the TPP removal was observed in the former case...|$|E

Due to depletion of fossil fuel, environmental issues, and rising of petrol price, biopetrol can be the alternative fuel to the fossil fuel. Catalytic cracking method is conducted in this research due to the low yields from thermal cracking method. Futhermore, Malaysia is plenty with palm oil which palmitic acid is dominated in palm oil composition. In recent years, {{there have been several}} other studies on the production of hydrocarbons from palm oil mainly bio-gasoline (biopetrol) which have been carried out using cracking catalysts. Zeolites have shown excellent performance as solid <b>acid</b> <b>cracking</b> catalysts due to their higher selectivity. Many researcher have studied that catalytic cracking method will produce much higher yields than thermal cracking method. Through catalytic cracking process, palmitic acid is catalytic cracked with 4 different amount of catalyst – 1 g, 5 g, 10 g, and 20 g. The distillated product is diluted with 4 different dilution mixture solution – 1 %, 5 %, 10 %, and 20 %. All the product samples are analyzed with Gas Chromatographer (GC). The isooctane concentrations are increased when the amount of catalysts are increased, but not obviously. The lowest percentage concentration of isooctane obtained is 9. 1822 % and the highest percentage concentration of isooctane obtained is 20. 7210 %. These yields are much higher than the yields produced from thermal cracking method which is 3 % to 5 %. It showed that the catalytic cracking method will produce much higher yields for biopetrol synthesized compared to thermal cracking method.

The condensate was obtained by condensing the vapor phase evolved on heating the clay and the extract {{was derived from the}} clay by prolonged water extraction. Both condensate and extract were colloidal systems, which were separated into solid and liquid fractions by distillation. Reactions carried out in a dynamic system established that the solid components acted as true acid catalysts, whereas the liquid fractions were inactive under the experimental conditions adopted. The catalytic activity per weight of the condensate exceeded that of either the parent clay or the extract. The present results confirm that colloidal size catalysts of high activity can be generated from clays. Such materials, mobilized and transported alone or with formation fluids, may act as catalysts in places removed in space and time from their source. This finding refutes objections previously raised to the operation of bulk clays as catalysts for reactions with particulate organics and supports the concept hat acid catalysts derived from clays may participate in organic geochemical reactions in an aqueous medium...|$|R

Our objective was to describe the clinical and cytogenetic findings from a sample of patients with the phenotype of OAVS. DESIGN AND SETTING: Cross-sectional study in a referral hospital in southern Brazil. METHODS: The sample consisted of 23 patients who presented clinical findings in at least two of these four areas: orocraniofacial, ocular, auricular and vertebral. The patients underwent a clinical protocol and cytogenetic evaluation through high-resolution karyotyping, fluorescence in situ hybridization for 5 p and 22 q 11 microdeletions and investigation of chromosomal instability for Fanconi anemia. RESULTS: Cytogenetic abnormalities were observed in three cases (13 %) and consisted of: 47,XX,+mar; mos 47,XX,+mar/ 46,XX; and 46,XX,t(6; 10) (q 13; q 24).

While a model Ga/HZSM- 5 catalyst prepd. by CVD of Ga(CH 3) 3 contg. mainly charge-compensating Ga cations displays high selectivity to dehydrogenated products (olefins, toluene and coke), catalysts with a lower Ga/Al ratio display improved activity with a product mixt. resulting from contributions of Ga sites (dehydrogenation, aromatization, olefin cracking) and of Bronsted <b>acid</b> sites (protolytic <b>cracking,</b> olefin cracking). The synergy between Ga dehydrogenation sites and Bronsted acid sites is proposed to improve the dehydrogenation rate: the high acidity of the zeolitic proton facilitates hydrogen recombination and concomitant removal of product olefin from the Ga active sites. Ion-exchanged Ga/HZSM- 5 catalyst which combines a difficult to reduce gallium oxide phase and high Bronsted acidity has the highest activity with relatively weak coke formation...|$|R
40|$|Biopetrol {{is defined}} as fuel which has the same {{characteristics}} with commercial petrol {{in terms of its}} molecular formula. The objectives of this research are to analyze isooctane obtained from palmitic acid and to improve the concentration of biopetrol obtained from palmitic <b>acid</b> using catalytic <b>cracking.</b> This process is used to produce isooctane from palmitic acid. Heat is supplied using hot plate at palmitic acid’s melting point within a range of 63 oC – 64 oC, to melt the solid palmitic acid. Later, the granular copper is mix with palmitic acid after it turns to liquid. The heating is continuous at isooctane’s boiling point of 98 oC by using heating mantel 250 ml to form new arrangements of carbon compounds including isooctane. The heating is constantly at the same temperature and the samples were collected at the different mass of catalyst which in 20 g, 10 g, 5 g and 1 g. The isooctane obtained is around 0. 065206 %- 0. 066561 % in palmitic acid with granular copper. After back calculation, the highest concentration of the desired isooctane is 8. 379 % at 5 g copper catalyst with 1 % sample + 99 % solvent. This research also shows an improvement in concentration of biopetrol (isooctane) compare to the previous research by using thermal cracking. -Author...|$|R
40|$|The {{pyrolysis}} of {{the crude}} glycerol from a biodiesel production plant was investigated by thermogravimetry coupled with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The main gaseous products are discussed, and the thermogravimetric kinetics derived. There were four distinct phases in the pyrolysis {{process of the}} crude glycerol. The presence of water and methanol in the crude glycerol and responsible for the first decomposition phase, were shown to catalyse glycerol decomposition (second phase). Unlike the pure compound, crude glycerol decomposition below 500 K leaves behind a large mass fraction of pyrolysis residues (ca. 15 %), which eventually partially eliminate in two phases upon reaching significantly higher temperatures (700 and 970 K, respectively). An improved iterative Coats-Redfern method {{was used to evaluate}} non-isothermal kinetic parameters in each phase. The latter were then utilised to model the decomposition behaviour in non-isothermal conditions. The power law model (first order) predicted accurately the main (second) and third phases in the pyrolysis of the crude glycerol. Differences of 10 - 30 kJ/mol in activation energies between crude and pure glycerol in their main decomposition phase corroborated the catalytic effect of water and methanol in the crude pyrolysis. The 3 -D diffusion model more accurately reproduced the fourth (last) phase, whereas the short initial decomposition phase was poorly simulated despite correlation coefficients ca. 0. 95 - 0. 96. The kinetics of the 3 rd and 4 th decomposition phases, attributed to fatty <b>acid</b> methyl esters <b>cracking</b> and pyrolysis tarry residues, were sensitive to the heating rate...|$|R
40|$|Kinetic {{studies of}} propane and n -butane {{aromatization}} were performed over H-ZSM- 5 at 500 Deg at the conversions between 1 % and 88 %. Based {{on the results}} obtained, a kinetic model for aromatization of both alkanes was developed. The model contains 38 rate consts., two adsorption consts., and 38 reaction steps to describe transformation of 13 components involved in these two reactions. Anal. of the exptl. and kinetic modeling data has confirmed that propane and n-butane transformation over H-ZSM- 5 occurs via two routes: (i) protolytic cracking (PC) of C-C and C-H bonds in alkane mols. and (ii) hydrogen transfer (HT) between the feed alkane and product alkenes adsorbed on <b>acid</b> sites. <b>Cracking</b> of C-C bonds is favored over cracking of C-H bonds for both alkanes; and the n -butane reactivity in the PC steps is 5 times {{higher than that of}} propane. The contribution of the HT route into propane and n-butane transformations was estd. quant. {{for the first time and}} was shown to increase with alkane conversion, being always higher for the n-butane reaction (e. g., at conversion of 10 %, this contribution was around 10 % and 25 % for propane and n-butane reactions, resp.). As a result, an increase in the reaction rate was obsd. at low n-butane conversions, demonstrating for the first time the autocatalytic character of this reaction. However, in agreement with the lower contribution of the HT steps in conversion of propane, the autocatalysis was not obsd. in the propane reaction. Light alkenes formed in the initial reaction steps give rise to fast alkene oligomerization/cracking steps that control alkene distribution during alkane aromatization. The rate consts. of the alkene oligomerization/cracking steps are. apprx. 10 times higher than those of the aromatization steps, which, in turn, are. apprx. 1000 times higher than the sum of the rate consts. of the propane PC steps. Direct comparison of the aroms. formation in propane and n -butane reactions shows that the aroms. concn., when detd. at the same conversions of two alkanes, is always higher for propane reaction. This finding is explained by the difference in the propane and n -butane reactivity, and allows us to predict higher aroms. concn. /selectivity in conversion of ethane as compared to reaction of propane.

40|$|The {{conversion}} of light alkanes to high value aroms. proceeds {{with a high}} selectivity over bifunctional, gallium (Ga) contg. zeolite catalysts. It is generally agreed that Ga sites are involved in dehydrogenation reaction steps and that the zeolite <b>acid</b> sites catalyze <b>cracking,</b> oligomerization, and cyclization reactions. However, understanding of the precise roles of the acid and Ga sites in the reaction mechanisms is significantly hampered since the no. of these sites in working catalysts is not known. This paper describes a kinetic approach to evaluation of the acid and Ga active sites in working Ga contg. TON zeolite catalysts that relies on the anal. of the rates of formation of the primary products of a n-butane aromatization reaction. Our {{results show that the}} rate of ethane formation at low n-butane conversions {{can be used as a}} quant. est. of acidity in working bifunctional zeolite catalysts and demonstrate, for the first time, a significant decrease in the no. of Bronsted acid sites in the Ga contg. catalysts under reaction conditions: around 47 and 79 % for the catalysts with Ga loading of 1. 5 and 2. 5 wt. %, resp. We conclude that the redn. in acidity is assocd. with the formation of catalytically active Ga+ ions and obtain ests. for the no. and steady-state turnover activity of the acid and Ga active sites in n-butane transformation. We anticipate that our work will facilitate understanding of the precise roles of the acid and Ga sites in the mechanisms of alkane aromatization and, as a far-reaching implication, will prompt wider use of detailed kinetic studies for the evaluation of active sites in working catalysts.

40|$|The {{ability to}} control {{nanoscale}} features precisely is increasingly being exploited to develop and improve monofunctional catalysts(1 - 4). Striking effects might also be expected {{in the case of}} bifunctional catalysts, which are important in the hydrocracking of fossil and renewable hydrocarbon sources to provide high-quality diesel fuel(5 - 7). Such bifunctional hydrocracking catalysts contain metal sites and acid sites, and for more than 50 years the so-called intimacy criterion(8) has dictated the maximum distance between the two types of site, beyond which catalytic activity decreases. A lack of synthesis and material-characterization methods with nanometre precision has long prevented in-depth exploration of the intimacy criterion, which has often been interpreted simply as 'the closer the better' for positioning metal and acid sites(8 - 11). Here we show for a bifunctional catalyst-comprising an intimate mixture of zeolite Y and alumina binder, and with platinum metal controllably deposited on either the zeolite or the binder-that closest proximity between metal and zeolite acid sites can be detrimental. Specifically, the selectivity when cracking large hydrocarbon feedstock molecules for high-quality diesel production is optimized with the catalyst that contains platinum on the binder, that is, with a nanoscale rather than closest intimacy of the metal and <b>acid</b> sites. Thus, <b>cracking</b> of the large and complex hydrocarbon molecules that are typically derived from alternative sources, such as gas-to-liquid technology, vegetable oil or algal oil(6, 7), should benefit especially from bifunctional catalysts that avoid locating platinum on the zeolite (the traditionally assumed optimal location). More generally, we anticipate that the ability demonstrated here to spatially organize different active sites at the nanoscale will benefit the further development and optimization of the emerging generation of multifunctional catalysts(12 - 15) ...|$|R
40|$|Coal tar {{can be used}} as an {{alternative}} raw material for the production of liquid fuels, such as: gasoline and diesel through hydrogenation and cracking process. Hydrogenation and cracking process requires a catalyst which has metal components for hydrogenation reaction and <b>acid</b> components for <b>cracking</b> reaction. In this study, the Co/Zeolite Y and Co-Mo/Zeolite Y catalysts were prepared by impregnation and ion exchange methods. Characterizations of the catalysts were carried out by X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) and gravimetric acidity. The catalysts were tested for coal tar conversion to liquid fuel under various temperatures, amount of catalyst and hydrogen flow rates in a fixed bed flow reaction system. Liquid fuels products were analyzed by gas chromatography (GC). The XRD Spectra indicated that the addition of Co and Mo metals did not affect catalysts structure, however it alters the percentage of crystallinity. The addition of Co metal using impregnation method caused reduction in crystallinity, while the addition of Mo caused improvement of crystallinity. The Co-Mo/Zeolite Y catalyst with highest crystallinity was obtained by loading using ion exchange method. The addition of Co and Mo metals caused increasing acidity. However, the increasing composition of Co and Mo loaded on Zeolite Y catalyst decreased the yield of liquid fuels from coal tar. It can be concluded that the yields of liquid fuels and the composition of gasoline fractions from hydrocracking of coal tar were highly dependent on acidity of the catalyst.
