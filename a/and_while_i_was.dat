Even the word Sarah he could not pronounce at first, but had to spell it, and I would pronounce it for him.|$|E
500|$|In Sherrybaby, Gyllenhaal {{played a}} young drug-addicted thief {{trying to put}} her life in order after prison so she can {{reconcile}} with her daughter. During promotion of the film, she noted of her portrayal of the character: [...] "I think she's in such dire straights [...] that all she has are these kind of naive, fierce hope. <b>And</b> <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> playing the part I was looking for pleasure and hope in everything, even in these really bleak things. And {{so it was really}} mostly after I finished the movie that I felt pain." [...] Her performance in the film was well received: David Germain of the Associated Press wrote, [...] "Gyllenhaal humanizes her so deeply and richly... that Sherry elicits sympathy even in her darkest and weakest moments", and Dennis Harvey of Variety called her performance [...] "naturalistic". For her work, Gyllenhaal earned her second Golden Globe Best Actress nomination and won the Best Actress category award at the 2006 Stockholm International Film Festival.|$|E

6000|$|... "Now, my dear friend," [...] said I, [...] "take my advice, <b>and</b> <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> gone, keep up a stout heart; never despair, and {{all will}} be well." ...|$|R
2500|$|When {{the ship}} sank, I {{was stuck in}} a whirlpool, {{wrenched}} and whirled till I thought my legs would be pulled off. [...] I saw a body alongside me. [...] It was Will Thomas, my assistant. [...] I tried to revive him when a broken hatch cover came up and struck the lad on the head, crushing it. [...] My life preserver came off <b>and</b> <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> floundering in the water, another hatch cover came up. [...] I grabbed the ring and pulled myself up on it. [...] I saw a foot sticking up from beneath it, and pulling it, {{found it to be}} Thomas McKernan, the son of the chief engineer. [...] I pulled him up and he revived after a while. [...] The lake was covered with wreckage and all around in the fog could be heard cries of [...] "Help" [...] but it was three quarters of an hour before the yawls of the Scott had been loosened and put in the water.|$|E

6000|$|... "You {{will step}} inside?" [...] <b>I</b> asked awkwardly, <b>and</b> <b>while</b> <b>I</b> spoke <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{wondering}} {{how long it}} would be before the earl's excitement broke out.|$|R

6000|$|... "But I sha'n't {{make any}} mistake," [...] said Ella, confidently, [...] "and so you won't {{have to be}} whipped on my account; <b>and</b> <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> on the horse you can't be whipped, for he couldn't do it without {{whipping}} me, so you see you won't get only half as much." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "At {{any rate}} we will try, you <b>and</b> <b>I.</b> <b>While</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> visiting the Kennedys, {{you can be}} finding out people who were at Limerick during the siege, and gather all they can {{remember}} about the Kennedys there." ...|$|R

60|$|A.

6000|$|The men's {{eyes met}} for a moment, and Stimson smiled curiously. [...] "There is," [...] he said, [...] "still a warrant out for him.
