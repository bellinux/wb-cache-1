5|$|The {{three major}} {{components}} of peat are humic acid, humins, and fulvic acid. Of these, humins give {{the most reliable}} date as they are insoluble in alkali <b>and</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> to contain contaminants from the sample's environment.

5|$|A 2016 study led by Harvard University health {{economics}} professor Benjamin Sommers found that residents of Kentucky and Arkansas, which both accepted the Medicaid expansion, {{were more likely}} to receive health care services <b>and</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> to incur emergency room costs or have trouble paying their medical bills than before the expansion. Residents of Texas, which did not accept the Medicaid expansion, did not see a similar improvement during the same period. Kentucky opted for increased managed care, while Arkansas subsidized private insurance. The new Arkansas and Kentucky governors have proposed reducing or modifying their programs. Between 2013 and 2015, the uninsured rate dropped from 42% to 14% in Arkansas and from 40% to 9% in Kentucky, compared with 39% to 32% in Texas. Specific improvements included additional primary and preventive care, fewer emergency departments visits, reported higher quality care, improved health, improved drug affordability, reduced out-of-pocket spending and increased outpatient visits, increased diabetes screening, glucose testing among diabetes patients and regular care for chronic conditions.|$|E

50|$|Preventive {{effects on}} alcohol use and {{cigarette}} use were first {{observed in the}} spring of Grade 8, 2.67 years after intervention programs were implemented. Grade 8 youth from CTC communities were 32% <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> to initiate alcohol use, <b>and</b> 33% <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> to initiate cigarette smoking than Grade 8 youth from control communities (Hawkins et al., 2009). Preventive effects were again sustained through Grade 10 when CTC panel youth were 29% <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> to initiate alcohol use <b>and</b> 28% <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> to initiate cigarette smoking than panel youth from control communities.|$|R

5|$|Day 3 outlooks {{refer to}} the day after tomorrow, and include the same {{products}} (categorical outline, text description, and probability graph) as the Day 2 outlook. As of June 2012, the SPC forecasts general thunderstorm risk areas. Higher probability forecasts are less <b>and</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> as the forecast period increases due to lessening forecast ability farther in advance. Day 3 moderate risks are quite rare; these have been issued only fourteen times since the product became operational (most recently for May 9, 2015). Day 3 high risks are never issued and the operational standards do not allow for such. This is most likely because it would require both a very high degree of certainty (60%) for an event which was still at least 48 hours away and a reasonable level of confidence that said severe thunderstorm outbreak would include significant severe weather (EF2+ tornadoes, hurricane-force winds, and/or egg-sized hail).|$|E

40|$|This paper {{shows that}} local {{institutional}} investors are effective monitors of corporate behavior. Firms with high local ownership have better internal governance {{and are more}} profitable. These firms are also <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> to manage their earnings aggressively or backdate options <b>and</b> are <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> to be targets of class action lawsuits. Further, managers of such firms exhibit a lower propensity to engage in “empire building” <b>and</b> are <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> to “lead the quiet life”. Examining the local monitoring mechanisms, we find that local institutions {{are more likely to}} introduce shareholder proposals, increase CEO turnover, and reduce excess CEO pay...|$|R

25|$|Although {{structurally}} {{similar to}} chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), tetrafluoromethane does not deplete the ozone layer.

25|$|Anatomical {{terminology}} uses many unique terms, suffixes, and prefixes {{deriving from}} Ancient Greek and Latin.

Once the antlers are shed, stags tend to form bachelor groups which allow them to cooperatively work together. Herds tend to have one or more members watching for potential danger, while the remaining members eat and rest.|$|E

30|$|Labor supply {{may be a}} {{function}} of body weight via the effect of body weight on two outcomes related to marriage markets. First, the literature reviewed in the previous section suggests that high-BMI people will be <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> to be married <b>and</b> they are <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> to be married to higher income spouses than people who are low-BMI. In heterosexual marriage markets, individuals with higher body weight may be less in demand on the part of members of the other sex <b>and</b> thus <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> to become part of a couple.|$|R
25|$|Undocumented {{immigrants}} in mixed status families tend {{to work in}} jobs that do not provide employee based health insurance and/or employed in occupations that pay off the books. Moreover, we can also expect that poor noncitizen children whose parents lack job-based coverage have lower rates of participation than poor citizen children of U.S. citizens. The lack of insurance for citizen children in mixed-status families means that these children {{are less likely to}} receive timely care for acute conditions, <b>and</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> to have their chronic conditions diagnosed and appropriately managed.|$|E

It is usually a flat woven webbing made of nylon, cotton, or Dacron. In the natural horsemanship tradition, the longe line is usually made of round cotton rope, and is often much shorter, as short as 15 or 20 feet. In general, cotton longe lines {{are less likely to}} burn the trainer's hands than nylon, but nylon is more durable <b>and</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> to break.|$|E
25|$|Compared to children, {{adolescents}} {{are more likely}} to question others' assertions, <b>and</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> to accept facts as absolute truths. Through experience outside the family circle, they learn that rules they were taught as absolute are in fact relativistic. They begin to differentiate between rules instituted out of common sense—not touching a hot stove—and those that are based on culturally-relative standards (codes of etiquette, not dating until a certain age), a delineation that younger children do not make. This can lead to a period of questioning authority in all domains.|$|E
