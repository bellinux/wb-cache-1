The updraft can now enhance the vorticity (by as much a several orders of magnitude) through stretching. Additionally, since both new updrafts are now located off the hodograph, a streamwise vorticity component (quantifiable as Storm Relative Helicity...SRH) is able to be ingested into the storm (with the anticylonic split ingesting negative SRH and the right split ingesting positive SRH).

40|$|A {{blocking}} pattern which formed over eastern North America {{following the}} landfall of Hurricane Juan during November 1985 was investigated. It is hypothesize that latent heat {{released in the}} Hurricane's rainfall was {{either directly or indirectly}} responsible for the large observed 500 mb height rises over eastern Canada during the formation of this block. This idea is evaluated with a diagnostic model for the height tendency field which includes latent heat release as a forcing function. The total column heating is calculated using satellite-derived precipitation estimates. These estimates are qualitatively congruent with observations, but overestimate light rainfall and underestimate heavy rainfall. The calculations reveal that the direct contribution of the heating to the 500 mb height tendency field is small relative to the quasigeostrophic forcing. However, maxima in heating coincide with regions where <b>anticyclonic</b> potential <b>vorticity</b> is generated. Once such region is just upstream of the location of large 500 mb height rises in the incipient block. An indirect role is proposed for the heating in this case.

40|$|An {{important}} {{problem in}} large-scale atmospheric dynamics is understanding {{the evolution of}} these blocking systems. Inspection {{of a large number}} of cases of 500 mb cyclonic and anticyclonic blocking vortices during recent winter seasons reveals that the occurrence of these systems is preceded by high amplitude (but not necessarily stationary) planetary waves at 500 mb and by intense synoptic-scale surface cyclone activity. A possible relationship between the cyclones and planetary waves during block evolution is thus hypothesized. Detailed diagnostic study of blocking cases during January 1977, February 1978 and November 1980 discloses that the development of 500 mb anticyclonic blocking vortices is preceded in time by the intense surface cyclogenesis between 500 mb planetary scale troughs and ridges, whereas blocking cyclonic vortices form following cyclogenesis near the axes of 500 mb troughs. A positive feedback between the cyclone and planetary waves is thus implied. The 500 mb height changes accompanying the above processes were analyzed in terms of quasi-geostrophic potential <b>vorticity.</b> During <b>anticyclonic</b> vortex development, there are spatially and temporally persistent calculated quasi-geostrophic height rises due to <b>anticyclonic</b> potential <b>vorticity</b> advections occurring near the cyclone track.

40|$|I Encuentro de la Oceanografía Física Española (EOF), 13 - 15 de octubre 2010, BarcelonaThe {{eastern region}} of the North Atlantic {{subtropical}} gyre is an upwelling favorable region characterized by an intense quasi‐permanent southward flowing coastal jet that is fed by the eastern branch of the Canary Current and provides the eastern boundary condition for the interior flow. This boundary drainage was numerically specified for a very simple one‐layer quasigeostrophic model through modified eastern boundary conditions, specifically by allowing a meridional band of nearconstant potential vorticity (PV) near the coast. The existence of such a constant PV meridional band implies the generation of negative relative vorticity at the eastern boundary, as if induced by the horizontal shear associated to the system of coastal currents, and allows the interior water to exit the numerical domain at the eastern boundary in reasonable agreement with observations.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{recently}} shown that when an inviscid outflow empties into the ocean, a steady alongshore current (in the Kelvin wave sense) cannot be established. This {{is due to}} the impossibility of balancing the alongshore momentum flux. To offset this momentum-flux deficit the outflow balloons near its source, forming an anticyclonic bulge. Using 1 -layer analytical and numerical models, the authors show that, on an f plane, the Coriolis force associated with the offshore movement of the growing bulge (which pushes itself away from the wall) compensates for the momentum flux of the longshore current downstream. With the aid of the slowly varying approximation, an inviscid nonlinear analytical solution is constructed. Numerical simulations with the Bleck and Boudra model are also performed. It is found that an outflow with an intense <b>anticyclonic</b> <b>vorticity</b> (i. e., a zero potential vorticity outflow with a relative vorticity of 2 f) produces a steep gyre that balloons (i. e., its radius increases with time) quickly at the rate of 8 g 9 Q/ 3 p f 2 R 3 (where g 9 is the reduced gravity, Q is the outflow’s discharge, f the Coriolis parameter, and R is the instantaneous bulge radius).

Near-inertial band current variance comprises 10 – 20 % of the total observed current variance, and has episodic peak speeds exceeding 30 cm/s. Near-inertial current variability during CMO {{is characterized by a}} first baroclinic mode vertical structure with one zero-crossing between 15 and 50 m. The zero-crossing is shallower during periods of stronger stratification. Laterally, near-inertial variability is coherent over the extent of the CMO moored array, and cross-shelf decorrelation scales for near-inertial currents are about 100 km, approximately the entire shelf width. The magnitude of near-surface near-inertial variability is stronger in the summer and weaker in the winter, following the seasonal variation in stratification and opposite the seasonal cycle in wind stress variance. During CMO, near-surface near-inertial kinetic energy is inversely related to surface mixed layer depth. Near-inertial variance decreases onshore, matching approximately the cross-shelf decrease in near-inertial energy predicted by a two-dimensional, linear, flat-bottom, twolayer, coastal wall model. In this model, the nullifying effects of a baroclinic wave emanating from the coastal wall play a dominant role in controlling the onshore decrease.

Especially, cloud motion vectors (CMVs) and water vapour wind vectors (WVWVs) obtained from METEOSAT- 5 are used in objective analysis (OI Scheme) of the wind field at 850 and 200 hPa for monitoring dynamical changes in respect of vorticity, convergence and divergence associated with complete life cycle of tropical cyclone. This computation was made using improved CMVs and WVWVs obtained from regression relationship developed between satellite-derived winds of METEOSAT- 5 and radiosonde winds of Minicoy and Port Blair island stations over the Indian region.

Analytical and numerical methods {{are used to}} quantify {{the impact of this}} coupling on the vertical circulation, spindown of geostrophic flows, and the formation of a shelfbreak jet. Over a stratified. slope, linear spindown of a geostrophic along-isobath flow induces cross-isobath Ekman flows. Ekman advection of buoyancy weakens the vertical circulation and slows spindown. Upslope (downslope) Ekman flows tend to inject (remove) potential vorticity into (from) the ocean. Momentum advection and nonlinear buoyancy advection are examined in setting asymmetries in the vertical circulation and the vertical relative vorticity field. During nonlinear homogeneous spindown over a flat bottom, momentum advection weakens Ekman pumping and strengthens Ekman suction, while cyclonic vorticity decays faster than <b>anticyclonic</b> <b>vorticity.</b> During nonlinear stratified spindown over a slope, nonlinear advection of buoyancy enhances the asymmetry in Ekman pumping and suction, whereas <b>anticyclonic</b> <b>vorticity</b> can decay faster than cyclonic vorticity outside of the boundary layers.

Short, finite-height vortices that extend only one scale height above and below the midplane are also unstable, but for a different reason: we have isolated an antisymmetric (with respect to the midplane) eigenmode that grows with an e-folding time of only a few orbital periods; the nonlinear evolution of this instability leads to the destruction of the vortex. Serendipitously, we observe the formation of 3 D vortices that are centered not in the midplane, but at one to three scale heights above and below.

By definition, a TC must have sustained winds greater than 33 m/s {{to be classified}} at least as a weak hurricane (category I), according to the Saffir-Simpson scale. Sea Surface Temperatures (SSTs) warmer than 26. 5 oC and Environmental Vertical Wind Shear (EVWS, defined as {{the magnitude of the}} difference between the 200 and 850 hPa vector winds) lower than 8 m/s offer the ideal conditions for TC development, given that the large scale humidity and the cyclonic vorticity are sufficiently high as usually found in easterly waves (Gray, 1968; Davis and Bosart, 2003). The term TT for Tropical Transition (Hart, 2003; Davis and Bosart, 2003), as opposed to ET for Extratropical Transition (Hart, 2003; Jones et al., 2003), refers to an initial Extratropical Cyclone (EC) changing into a TC. Not a single South Atlantic hurricane case had ever been documented before March 2004, although {{it has been suggested that}} at least two very rare cases of weak TCs below the hurricane strength may have occurred in the satellite era (Silva Dias et al., 2004). Here, we show that the Catarina event, which was named after Saint Catarina State in Brazil (where landfall occurred), initiated off the Brazilian coast around the 20 th of March 2004 as an EC, underwent Tropical Transition three days later and reached a category I hurricane strength under an unprecedented combination of low wind shear and strong mid-to-high latitude blocking.

40|$|A {{planetary}} and synoptic-scale {{analysis of}} a relatively rare continental blocking event that occurred over North America {{during the spring of}} 1980 are undertaken {{to determine whether or not}} this event was different from its counterparts which occur over oceanic regions. The planetary-scale analysis demonstrates that, during the spring season, a ridge was located further inland over the North American continent and amplified with respect to climatology. The position of this ridge may have been linked to a broad region of colder-than-normal SSTs found over the north central Pacific during the spring season and much of the previous winter. Simple "Sutcliffe-type" and thermodynamic analyses of the accompanying lower tropospheric warm anomaly associated with the ridging shows that lower tropospheric temperature advection and subsidence associated with <b>anticyclonic</b> <b>vorticity</b> advection by the time mean thermal wind produced much of the anomalous warmth. A simple synoptic-scale analysis was performed using both the Zwack-Okossi (ZO) equation and potential vorticity (PV) thinking approaches. These complementary analyses demonstrated that synoptic-scale cyclones were instrumental in the formation and maintenance (and/or intensification) of this blocking event. The PV analysis demonstrated that low-PV air was swept poleward and then was advected over the blocking region sustaining the broad region of low potential vorticity associated with the block over North America. The ZO analysis showed that the advection of <b>anticyclonic</b> <b>vorticity</b> was the most important mechanism forcing geopotential height rises at 500 hPa over the block center. The region of low PV and ZO height rises could be associated with the anticyclonic shear side of an upstream jet maximum typically found in association with developing and/or intensifying blocking event. Thus, negative PV advection correlated significantly with calculated ZO height rises.

40|$|The South Pacific Convergence Zone (SPCZ) and South Atlantic Convergence Zone (SACZ) are {{diagonal}} {{bands of}} precipitation that extend from the equator southeastward into the Southern Hemisphere over the western Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, respectively. With mean precipitation rates over 5 mm day− 1, {{they are a}} major component of the tropical and global climate in austral summer. However, their basic formation mechanism is not fully understood. Here, a conceptual framework for the diagonal convergence zones is developed, based on calculations of the vorticity budget from reanalysis and Rossby wave theory. Wave trains propagate eastward along the Southern Hemisphere subtropical jet, with initially quasi-circular vorticity centres. In the zonally sheared environment on the equatorward flank of the jet, these vorticity centres become elongated and develop a northwest-southeast tilt. Ray tracing diagnostics in a non-divergent, barotropic Rossby wave framework then explain the observed equatorward propagation of these diagonal vorticity structures toward the westerly ducts over the equatorial Pacific and Atlantic. The baroclinic component of these circulations leads to destabilisation and ascent ahead of the cyclonic vorticity anomaly in the wave, triggering deep convection because of the high sea surface temperatures in this region. Latent heat release then forces additional ascent and strong upper-tropospheric divergence, with an associated <b>anticyclonic</b> <b>vorticity</b> tendency. A vorticity budget shows that this cancels out the advective cyclonic vorticity tendency in the wave train over the SPCZ, and dissipates the wave within a day. The mean SPCZ is consequently comprised of the sum of these pulses of diagonal bands of precipitation. Similar mechanisms also operate in the SACZ. However, the vorticity anomalies in the wave trains are stronger, and the precipitation and negative feedback from the divergence and <b>anticyclonic</b> <b>vorticity</b> tendency are weaker, resulting in continued propagation of the wave and a more diffuse diagonal convergence zone...|$|E

40|$|We {{examine the}} eastern Pacific Ocean Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) both in its mean state and {{transient}} phases using a combined diagnostic, theoretical and numerical modeling approach. We {{note that the}} ITCZ is perpetually in a transient state with strong variability occurring on 4 - 8 day time scales. Transients, about half the amplitude of the mean ITCZ, propagate northwards from the near-equatorial southern hemisphere eventually increasing the convection {{in the vicinity of}} the mean ITCZ convection. It is argued that the mean ITCZ is continually inertially unstable with incursions of <b>anticyclonic</b> <b>vorticity</b> advected across the equator resulting in the creation of a divergence-convergence doublet. The low-level convergence generates convection and vortex tube stretching which generates cyclonic vorticity counteracting the northward advection of <b>anticyclonic</b> <b>vorticity.</b> During a cycle, the heating in the mid-troposphere near 10 °N oscillated between 6 and 12 K/day at the inertial frequency of the latitude of the mean convection. The shallow meridional circulation, noted in the mean field in other studies, appears to be a result of the transient nature of the ITCZ. It is hypothesized that westward propagating equatorial waves result from the inertial oscillation of the ITCZ. To test that the waves are formed in situ in the eastern Pacific and not remnants of waves propagating from the Atlantic or promoted by the Central and South American orography, several numerical experiments are undertaken using a high-resolution regional model spanning the western Atlantic Ocean and the eastern Pacific. In the control case, the model is initialized at all boundaries with full high-frequency observations. In two additional experiments, these transients are filtered out, and a third experiment is run with the topography over a large part of Central and South America removed. In all experiments, westward propagating waves are formed in the region of high CEPG suggesting that the hypothesis of in situ development may be correct. Ph. D. Committee Chair: Peter J.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the diagnosis of}} an extratropical cyclone that developed explosively from 18 to 19 January 1979 over the North Atlantic Ocean. The diagnosis applies data obtained from the Goddard Laboratory for Atmospheres FGGE SOP- 1 level III-b global analyses on a 4 ° latitude by 5 ° longitude grid to the extended height tendency and the Zwack-Okossi development equations. The cyclone developed initially in response to cyclonic vorticity advection downstream from an upper air trough, warm air advection in a strongly baroclinic region, and latent heat release in the cyclone domain. As development continued, thermal advection and latent heat release increased their role in forcing height falls in the cyclone domain, while the influence of vorticity advection decreased. Finally, development ceased when <b>anticyclonic</b> <b>vorticity</b> advection below 700 mb and adiabatic cooling in the ascending air combined to neutralize the influence of warm air advection and latent heat release...|$|E
40|$|Publicación online disponible en: [URL] {{flow pattern}} of the North Atlantic Subtropical Gyre (NASG) is {{simulated}} using a highly idealised one-layer quasi-geostrophic wind-driven model. The novel feature of the model is the specification of the eastern boundary conditions. This is an upwelling favourable region with a quasi-permanent southward flowing coastal jet, which is fed by the eastern branch of the Canary Current. The corresponding boundary conditions are non-zero normal flux and constant potential vorticity, the latter being consistent with the generation of <b>anticyclonic</b> <b>vorticity</b> by the coastal jet. We examine {{the sensitivity of the}} model to the eastern boundary conditions and compare the results with recent observations for the region.

40|$|Temperatures {{and thermal}} winds over the Great Red Spot (GRS) {{are derived from}} Voyager IRIS data for {{atmospheric}} pressures between 3 and 500 mbar. A cold tropopause implies a decrease in <b>anticyclonic</b> <b>vorticity</b> with height above 500 mbar through the lower stratosphere. Observations at 5 microns indicate {{that there is little}} emission from the GRS itself, although there is enhanced emission from a ring around it. The behavior of the tropopause and 5 micron temperatures are considered to be results of circulation which rises within the GRS and subsides in the area around it. Results are discussed in the context of several theoretical models of the GRS, and latent heat release as an energy source is considered. Dynamical scalings based on an axisymmetric frictionally controlled vortex indicate that the large-scale dynamics of the GRS are linear, as opposed to those of a tropical cyclone which are nonlinear...|$|E
40|$|The {{historical}} context and potential causes {{and structure of}} the 1992 / 93 drought in KwaZulu-Natal are analysed using NCEP reanalysis data. The analysis indicates that increased westerly winds with surface marine lows and continental highs prevailed over Southern Africa. Anomalous divergence and subsidence occur over the eastern subcontinent, coupled with reduced tropical moist inflows. Mid-latitude confluence, <b>anticyclonic</b> <b>vorticity</b> and upper level convergence suppressed convection over KwaZulu/Natal. The precipitable water field reflects a SE-NW orientated stationary wave-train pattern over Southern Africa with KwaZulu-Natal anti-phase with the Zambezi valley. A meridional overturning cell is seen as a driving mechanism behind the 1992 / 93 drought over South Africa. The velocity potential shows a dipole between the Zambezi and the SW Indian Ocean, and it appears that the kinematic structure was more important than the thermodynamic. Impacts include a reduction in crop yield and streamflows, and a slowing of economic activity. Keywords...|$|E

40|$|Baroclinic {{evolution}} of coastal currents {{associated with a}} surface front over variable topography is investigated numerically, employing a two-layer frontal-geostrophic model. In the frontal-geostrophic dynamical limit the frontal layer velocity is geostrophic to leading order; however the advective terms from the momentum equation are accounted for in the leading-order balance, and the mass conservation equation includes both the temporal and advective contributions. In this study, special focus {{is placed on the}} role of topography and the development of coherent vortex features. Perturbed axisymmetric currents in an annular domain are seen to develop typical breaking-wave instabilities at the outside edge. In general, the topography is found to be a destabilizing influence; however very steep topography is shown to inhibit cross-front motions, and thus delay subsequent vortex shedding. In simulations involving a continuous source of buoyant fluid, the ambient layer exhibits a marked increase in <b>anticyclonic</b> <b>vorticity,</b> which prevents eddy pinch-off. The results are compared with previous laboratory experiments involving surface currents, and implications for the stability of fronts at a shelf break are discussed. 1...|$|E
