5|$|The outdoor {{scene in}} which Xander sees Buffy in the sandbox was {{intentionally}} overexposed, intensifying the foreground and blowing out the background, making the sky look white; flash frames were also used in the shot of Buffy in the desert. Whedon allowed some shots to last far longer than is common in a television episode; this cinematic technique allowed the images to take on meaning. Highly stylized lighting is used throughout Xander's dream. In the university hallway the scene is lit with green and orange gels, while the almost shot-for-shot re-creation of the Apocalypse Now section is lit with carefully controlled spotlights which allow the background to fall out to black. Whedon cites The Limey as an inspiration for the unnaturally colored university sequence, and had the scene from Apocalypse Now playing on tape during filming to ensure as close a match as possible for that sequence. When Xander is driving the ice cream truck with Anya, the backgrounds outside the car intentionally look fake, to {{give a sense of}} stillness where there should be motion. Whedon originally wanted to use rear-screen projection for the driving scene, but had to utilize greenscreen instead, as rear-screen projection would be difficult to set up on their stages. Some special effects shots came about by accident; in his commentary Whedon explains that when Buffy smeared the mud all over her face, it looked <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> giving herself a facial. He therefore dissolved the shot into a negative image, creating intense colors that made the shot more interesting.|$|E
25|$|Around 190, when Sun Jian {{raised an}} army {{to join the}} {{campaign}} against Dong Zhuo, he relocated his family from Changsha Commandery (長沙郡; covering present-day Changsha and parts of Hunan) to Shu County. In Shu County, Zhou Yu met and befriended Sun Jian's eldest son, Sun Ce, who {{was about the same}} age as he. Zhou Yu offered to let Sun Ce and his family stay with him, and he paid respects to Sun Ce's mother Lady Wu <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> his real mother. Zhou Yu and Sun Ce became very close friends.|$|E
25|$|That September, {{she lost}} in the final of a $25,000 tournament to compatriot Zheng Jie, before {{returning}} to the WTA circuit, thanks to a wildcard entry into qualifying at the Beijing. There, she defeated Antonella Serra Zanetti, Marta Domachowska, and Nicole Pratt before losing in the deciding-set tie-break after a very close second-round main-draw tussle against newly crowned US Open Champion Svetlana Kuznetsova, during which she held match points against Kuznetsova. The Russian afterwards praised her Chinese opponent, stating that she had felt <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> up against a top-5 player.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> had to <b>be</b> in the picture, and so <b>she</b> came in <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>she</b> <b>were</b> {{the central}} figure, <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>she</b> <b>were</b> the quintessential England. There <b>she</b> <b>was,</b> the type, the blood, the likeness, of {{no end of}} Massachusetts families, the very same stuff indeed, and yet <b>she</b> <b>was</b> different....|$|R

5000|$|It {{is unclear}} when or by whom Hayes {{was called the}} [...] "First Lady of the Theatre". Her friend, actress Katharine Cornell, also held that title, and each thought the other {{deserved}} it. One critic said that Cornell played every queen <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>she</b> <b>were</b> a woman, whereas Hayes played every woman <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>she</b> <b>were</b> a queen.|$|R
25|$|In 190, when Sun Jian {{raised an}} army {{to join the}} {{campaign}} against Dong Zhuo, he relocated his family from Changsha Commandery (長沙郡; covering present-day Changsha and parts of Hunan) to Shu County (舒縣), Lujiang Commandery (廬江郡), which is in present-day Shucheng County, Anhui. In Shu, Sun Ce met and befriended Zhou Yu, who {{was about the same}} age as him. Zhou Yu offered to let Sun Ce and his family stay with him and he paid respects to Lady Wu <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> his real mother. Zhou Yu and Sun Ce became very close friends.|$|E
25|$|When {{the second}} superhero Civil War began, Pietro came to ask Wanda for help, but Wanda refused, because she and Pietro {{disagreed}} on which side was right - Pietro not liking {{the idea of}} profiling people {{based on what they}} might do and Wanda feeling that thinking about the future would have prevented many of their more dangerous mistakes in the past - past precedent made Wanda feel that introducing her powers to a conflict of this nature could be more dangerous than the existing situation, and she resented Pietro still trying to tell her what to do <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> a child, bluntly informing him that his refusal to learn from his mistakes marked him as a sociopath. He has also been revealed to have fallen under the telepathic control of the Red Skull, acting as a 'sleeper agent' in the Avengers as part of the Skull's current campaign.|$|E
500|$|The {{lyrics of}} [...] "Teardrops on My Guitar" [...] speak of heartbreak and are direct, {{referring}} to the subject by his first name, Drew. The song describes fancying someone who already interested in someone else and, therefore, maintaining the sentiments a secret. To him, Swift acted <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> happy about his relationship, while crying and lamenting at home. Dave Heaton of PopMatters interpreted the lines [...] "And there she goes, so perfectly / The kind of flawless I wish I could be" [...] to address Swift's ideal of perfection and her attempting to meet it, but not succeeding, a predominant theme on Fearless.|$|E

500|$|Her {{version of}} [...] "Stop Crying Your Heart Out" [...] {{garnered}} mostly negative reviews from music critics. Aside from comparisons to her previous singles [...] "Bleeding Love" [...] and her cover of Snow Patrol's [...] "Run", reviewers felt <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> too emotive {{and did not}} reflect {{the simplicity of the}} original. Although the arrangement of the song was criticised, Lewis's vocal performance was highly praised. The song peaked at number 29 on the UK Singles Chart, number 11 on the UK R Chart and number 31 on the Irish Singles Chart. Lewis has performed the song live on the BBC Radio 2 show Live Sessions with Ken Bruce, MTV Unplugged and on the sixth series finale of The X Factor.|$|E
500|$|... "Until It Beats No More" [...] {{was used}} as an {{introduction}} to Lopez's performance at the American Music Awards on November 20, 2011. She wore a golden gown, with the words: [...] "Love... It's a journey and I still have questions" [...] appearing in a screen behind her. Lopez began to break down, appearing <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> about to cry. She then paused, looked up and shed most of her clothes for a performance of [...] "Papi". Critics noted the [...] "fake breakdown" [...] to be poking fun at her breakdown during her performance of the song at the Mohegan Sun casino a month earlier. The performance was compared to Britney Spears's music video for [...] "Toxic" [...] and Lopez's performance during the 2001 American Music Awards.|$|E
500|$|Adele, who {{had just}} {{released}} her second album 21, admitted that initially she was a [...] "little hesitant" [...] about agreeing to write a Bond theme song. On meeting with the Skyfall film crew, the singer had told Skyfall director Sam Mendes that she felt <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> not the person {{that they were looking}} for because [...] "my songs are personal, I write from the heart". Mendes simply replied [...] "just write a personal song", telling her to use Carly Simon's [...] "Nobody Does It Better" [...] from The Spy Who Loved Me as an inspiration. Adele left the meeting with the script of Skyfall and, upon reading it, decided that it was a [...] "" [...] as she [...] "fell in love" [...] with the film's plot. Producer Paul Epworth, who had worked with Adele on 21, was brought in to help her write the song. Adele stated that she enjoyed working to a brief and set of guidelines, even though it was something she had never done before.|$|E

500|$|Nixon's {{approach}} ultimately {{impressed the}} studio and her recording was kept, which took the singer only thirty-two minutes to complete. However, she approached it <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> performing the entire score. Although Nixon performs only one verse in the song, her musical contribution to [...] "Honor to Us All" [...] marked the singer's return to film roles following her lengthy hiatus. Mulan was also Nixon's first Disney film in 10 years; she had previously performed in the musical film Mary Poppins (1964). Nixon was eventually joined by Broadway performers Beth Fowler and Lea Salonga, although the three singers never recorded together. The studio enjoyed Nixon's performance {{so much that they}} ultimately decided to recast the actress who had been providing Grandmother Fa's speaking voice at the time with someone who sounded more like her, replacing her with voice actress June Foray. Disney had been considered hiring actresses Lauren Bacall and June Havoc to record [...] "Honor to Us All" [...] prior to Nixon's. The songwriters first based [...] "Honor to Us All" [...] on a rough cut they had seen of the scene; the animators eventually synced the animated characters with the singers' voices.|$|E
500|$|Songwriter Stephen Schwartz had {{originally}} been slated to write both the music and lyrics for Mulan until he ultimately left the project to write songs for rival studio DreamWorks' animated film The Prince of Egypt (1998) instead after Disney executives forced him {{to choose between the}} two. Schwartz had completed only two songs for Mulan before his resignation, one of which was entitled [...] "China Doll" [...] which, according to Schwartz, [...] "more or less corresponds to the scene in the film in which Mulan goes to the Matchmaker". Schwartz was eventually replaced with composer Matthew Wilder and lyricist David Zippel, who wrote [...] "Honor to Us All" [...] with which to replace Schwartz's [...] "China Doll". Disney cast American singer and actress Marni Nixon, one of Hollywood's most prolific playback singers, as the singing voice of Grandmother Fa, Mulan's paternal grandmother. Nixon received the sheet music for [...] "Honor to Us All" [...] to review prior to auditioning for the role. The filmmakers then showed Nixon a drawing of the character, by whose comedic appearance the singer was immediately [...] "enchanted", telling herself [...] "you've just got to give her a voice... or, in this case, an unvoice." [...] Improvising her performance, Nixon decided to make the character sound <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> merely attempting to sing as opposed to actually singing, keeping in mind that the elderly character is toothless. Nixon also made no effort to sound like the actress who had been cast as Grandmother Fa's speaking voice at the time, determining that the two performers sound nothing alike upon listening to the actress' recording. Nixon had almost reconsidered auditioning for the role upon realizing how different she sounded from Grandmother Fa's speaking voice actress.|$|E
500|$|Ashman {{first met}} American actress and singer Jodi Benson {{while he was}} {{directing}} her in Smile. After the production closed prematurely, Ashman invited Smiles entire female cast to audition for The Little Mermaid using [...] "Part of Your World", {{although he did not}} tell them the name of the project they were auditioning for. Ashman mailed a copy of his demo of [...] "Part of Your World" [...] to Benson, to which she listened in preparation for her audition. Benson then recorded a brief sample of the song on a reel-to-reel tape, which she mailed to Disney. All audition tapes were left unidentified so that the candidates would remain anonymous to Musker and Clements, delighting Ashman when the directors ultimately selected Benson's tape to be the voice of Ariel. Her first voice acting role, for which she had to be carefully trained on properly projecting into the studio microphone, Benson found the process of recording [...] "Part of Your World" [...] somewhat difficult after Ashman instructed her to approach it <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> reciting a monologue as opposed to singing a song, although she found Ashman telling her exactly how he wanted her to perform its lyrics helpful with benefiting her entire performance. Ashman remained in the recording booth with Benson during the entire recording process, advising her on performing the song with intensity as opposed to belting it and whispering lines to her as she sang them. It was rare for a filmmaker to direct a performer from within the booth, requiring Ashman to move carefully to prevent his gestures from being recorded by the microphone. Initially struggling to capture Ariel's [...] "tomboyish-ness and yearning", Benson requested that the studio's lights be dimmed to simulate the feeling of being underwater. Menken and Ashman deliberately selected segments from Benson's recording session that [...] "are not perfectly sung" [...] to include in the final version, ranging from unsustained, incorrect notes lacking in vibrato to spoken words, because the songwriters wanted her performance to sound as [...] "real" [...] as possible.|$|E

2500|$|The {{original}} trio {{decided to}} call themselves Bethlehem Steel. In explaining why, Ryskalczyk stated [...] "It's {{a good way to}} stay connected to the industrial cities from which they all hail originally." [...] Additionally, paying tribute to her hometown prevented Ryskalczyk from feeling <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> abandoning her past.|$|E
2500|$|Ronstadt has {{remarked that}} she felt <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> [...] "artificially {{encouraged}} to kinda cop a really tough attitude (and be tough) because rock and roll is kind of tough (business)," [...] which she felt wasn't worn quite authentically. Female rock artists like her and Janis Joplin, whom she described as lovely, shy, and very literate in real life and {{the antithesis of the}} [...] "red hot mamma" [...] she was artificially encouraged to project, went through an identity crisis.|$|E
2500|$|Carr {{was also}} {{interviewed by the}} press after her return from Grimsby {{during the first week}} of the search for the girls. She showed a {{reporter}} a thank-you card given to her by Wells on the last day of the school year. Carr said: [...] "She was just lovely, really lovely" [...] and urged the missing girls to [...] "just come home". The police immediately noticed that Carr was referring to Wells in the past tense (<b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> no longer alive), although she had not been reported dead and police were still treating their disappearance as a missing persons case rather than a possible murder investigation.|$|E

2500|$|Most of the {{marriage}} ceremony and rites are performed true to Chinese custom. In fact, [...] "the bride was always treated <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> alive and participating in the proceedings" [...] from being fed at the wedding feast in the morning, to being invited {{in and out of}} the cab, to being told of her arrival at the groom's house. One observable difference in a ghost marriage is that the ancestral tablet of the deceased is placed inside the effigy, so that [...] "the bride's dummy [...] animated with the ghost that [...] to be married", and then placed with the groom's family's tablets at the end of {{the marriage}} festivities.|$|E
2500|$|The main {{character}} of NOW. Practitioner of the [...] "Sashinmu" [...] (사신무) killing style. He has distinct silver colored hair. He was the adopted grandson of North Star, and holds himself responsible for North Star's death. He {{seems to be}} developing a crush on Rin. Bi-Ryu is a rather simple young man, unable {{to catch up with}} the times on his own. This is shown when he and Ah-Rin prepare to embark on their quest. She asks if he is all packed, and if so, where are his things. He casts a finger to Cho-Ryung in response. He also had casually walked in on Yhun Ah-Rin and Cho Ryung in a bath, Bi Ryu asked directions and left <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> not naked, Cho Ryung seems to have the same casualness. However, he is merciless in combat, referring to himself as a Sa-Shin, a death god. He has been shown to descend into a ferocious killing rage during battle, with Ah-Rin being the only one able to return him to normal.|$|E
