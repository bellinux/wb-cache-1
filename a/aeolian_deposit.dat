Underneath the aeolian sand surface, seven main phases of occupation {{have been identified}} in the 2.5-3 meter deep Blombos Cave stratigraphic sequence; three in the Later Stone Age (L1-L3) and four in the Middle Stone Age (M1, Upper M2, Lower M2 and M3). These phases are further divided into finer lenses and sub-lenses, most of them less than 10 cm thick. The Later Stone Age and Middle Stone Age levels are separated by a 5-50 cm thick, sterile unit named ‘Hiatus’ or ‘DUN’. The Hiatus consists of yellow Aeolian sand that blew into the cave at about 68,000-70,000 years BP, and shows little disturbance from the overlying Later Stone Age units.|$|E

40|$|<b>Aeolian</b> <b>deposits</b> in the North American Great Plains are {{important}} sources of Holocene palaeoenvironmental records. Although there are extensive studies on loess and dune {{records in the}} region, {{little is known about}} records in <b>aeolian</b> cliff-top <b>deposits.</b> These are common on table (mesa) edges in the White River Badlands. These sediments typically have loam and sandy-loam textures with dominantly very fine sand, 0. 5 – 1 % organic carbon and 0. 5 – 5 % CaCO 3. Some of these <b>aeolian</b> <b>deposits</b> are atypically coarse and contain granules and fine pebbles. Buried soils within these deposits are weakly developed with A-C and A-AC-C profiles. Beneath these are buried soils with varying degrees of pedogenic development formed in fluvial, <b>aeolian</b> or colluvial <b>deposits.</b> Thickness and number of buried soils vary. However, late-Holocene soils from several localities have ages of approximately 1300, 2500 and 3700 14 C yrs BP. The 1300 14 C yr BP soil is cumulic, with a thicker and lighter A horizon. Soils beneath the cliff-top deposits are early-Holocene (typically 7900 but as old as 10000 14 C yrs BP) at higher elevation (approx. 950 m) tables, and late-Holocene (2900 14 C yrs BP) at lower (approx. 830 m) tables. These age estimates are based on total organic matter 14 C ages from the top 5 cm of buried soils, and agreement is good between an infrared stimulated luminescence age and bracketing 14 C ages.

40|$|Grain size is {{the most}} {{important}} characteristics of aeolian sediments. Mean grain size, grain size distribution, standard deviation and skewness are the parameters reflecting sedimentation environments and are used to elucidate mechanisms of deposition and determining the provenance of <b>aeolian</b> <b>deposits</b> (Zhu et al., 2014). Loess and sand dunes are the two main <b>aeolian</b> <b>deposits</b> that are different regarding to their grain size distribution. Sand dunes occur in all climate conditions, but active sand dunes are commonly exist in desert environments, especially in mid-latitudes of northern hemisphere. Desert loesses occur in Africa and Middle east and nearly almost all are adjacent downwind to sand seas (Crouvi et al., 2010). There is a continuous transition of sand dunes to loess deposits in Srakhs area, northeastern Iran.

The Lake Chiemsee （ 47 ° 54 ＇N, 12 ° 30 ＇E; 520 m above sea level） located in the piedmont of Alps,covers about 80 kin 2. After collected by piston cores, the samples had experienced the magnetotactic bacteria culture in laboratory, then were air-dried and divided into four parts （various depths） which were named Bio-tesl, Bio-lcs 2, Bio-lcs 3, Bio-lcs 4. The results of the experiments show that the main magnetic minerals in the samples are magnetite, and a few pyrite simultaneously exist. Compared with other samples, the sample cultured at 1 - 2 cm depth displays some different properties in magnetic susceptibility （Z）, percentage frequency magnetic susceptibility （ Zfd%, anhysteretic remanent magnetization （ ARM ）, saturation magnetization （M） and eoercivity（ H o）, likely indicating higher concentration of magnetosomes produced by more magnetotactie bacteria in such certain depth. The results of low-temperature saturation remanence show clear Verwey transition, suggesting presence of multi-domain （MD） magnetite in the samples. That coarse size is out range of reported magnetosomes. That was also detected by particle size measurements showing a few peaks for the distribution curves. Of which,two main peaks are all larger than that of single domain SD/MD boundary. That likely indicates that lake Chiemsee sediments may be a mixture sources, together with <b>aeolian</b> <b>deposit</b> down to the lake.

The L 1 and L 2 are well-developed surfaces in the area, while the L 3 is subdivided from L 2 or alluvial plain and is locally distributed. In addition, the longitudinal profiles of the L 2 surfaces are steeper than those of the L 1 surfaces. Thus, the development of the L 1 and L 2 surfaces may be closely related to the global climate change.

40|$|During {{the course}} of this three-year project, we have studied <b>aeolian</b> <b>deposits</b> at 70 sites within sixteen areas in south-central Sweden. Inland dunes have been the focus, but some sites with coversand and coastal dunes have also been investigated. We have mapped dune morphology, mainly by LiDAR-based remote sensing, studied the {{internal}} sediment architecture by ground-penetrating radar profiling and in sediment exposures, documented the sedimentology of the deposits with field and laboratory methods as well as determined the age of the deposits with luminescence and radiocarbon dating. In this scientific report to the Geological Survey of Sweden, who funded the project, we present a summary of the project and its results. The largest and best developed dune fields are found at glacifluvial deposits in Värmland and Dalarna, while in areas south thereof there are mainly scattered dunes or coversand deposits. A range of dune types has been observed, but transverse dunes seem to be dominating and the majority of these are oriented roughly NE-SW. The bulk of the <b>aeolian</b> <b>deposits</b> were formed shortly after the local deglaciation and, once stabilised, do not appear to have been significantly reworked during the Holocene. Most Mid- and Late-Holocene <b>aeolian</b> <b>deposits</b> consist of coversand, apart from in coastal areas where e. g. young foredunes are found. Our results thus largely confirm the hypothesis of previous investigators but we do add a significant amount of new information. We provide, for the first time for most of our study areas, numerical ages for the <b>aeolian</b> <b>deposits</b> and thus provide the timing and duration of sand-drift events in south-central Sweden. The ages, in combination with detailed geomorphological mapping, allow us to distinguish phases of dune-field development, which are likely due to changes in wind patterns and vegetation cover, and also to correlate Swedish <b>aeolian</b> <b>deposits</b> to regional storminess periods. Based on sedimentological information we are able to reconstruct dominating depositional processes, transport paths and sediment sources. Additional outcomes of the project are e. g. methodological developments (LiDAR mapping, luminescence dating) and pilot studies of potential relevance for applied geology (coastal development) ...|$|R

The best candidate for the oxychlorine compounds in Rocknest is a hydrated calcium perchlorate (Ca(ClO 4) 2 *nH 2 O), based on the temperature release of O 2 that correlates {{with the release of}} the chlorinated hydrocarbons measured by SAM, although other chlorine-bearing phases are being considered. Laboratory analog experiments suggest that the reaction of Martian chlorine from perchlorate decomposition with terrestrial organic carbon from MTBSTFA during pyrolysis can explain the presence of three chloromethanes and a chloromethylpropene detected by SAM. Chlorobenzene may be attributed to reactions of Martian chlorine released during pyrolysis with terrestrial benzene or toluene derived from 2, 6 -diphenylphenylene oxide (Tenax) on the SAM hydrocarbon trap. At this time we do not have definitive evidence to support a nonterrestrial carbon source for these chlorinated hydrocarbons, nor do we exclude the possibility that future SAM analyses will reveal the presence of organic compounds native to the Martian regolith...|$|E

The networks of ice wedges have created areas with well-developed polygonal terrains in the lowest fluvial terraces in this valley. We have examined the sedimentological characteristics of {{the northern and southern}} banks of the Advent river for palaeoenvironmental purposes. The base of two sedimentary sections reported radiocarbon dates of 3. 3 and 3. 9 ka BP, respectively. The northern site is constituted by three very different lithostratigraphical units, which suggests that their formation should be related to different environmental and climate conditions. By contrast, the southern section shows a rather homogeneous composition, with no significant variations in grain size and organic matter content. In both cases the uppermost sediments are constituted by a thick <b>aeolian</b> <b>deposit.</b> According to our data, warmer climate conditions may have prevailed during the mid Holocene until 3. 3 ka BP with widespread peat formation in the valley bottom. Subsequently, a period with alternating soil formation and aeolian sedimentation took place from 3 to 2. 5 ka BP, probably due to increasing climatic severity. During the last millennium a long-term cooling trend has favoured aeolian deposition in the lowest part of Adventdalen. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|E

Apart from primary quartz, the remainder of the material is composed of feldspars, carbonates, heavy minerals, clay minerals and volcanic glass shards. As a result of their genesis and constitution, loess deposits form remarkably open structures with the interstitial clay-sized particles congregating at the quartz particle contacts. This open structure is maintained by a process of bonding, the strength of which increases with time. In general, loess deposits have a similar grain size distribution, mineral composition, open texture, low degree of saturation and bonding of grains which is not resistant to water. Although this bonding can maintain a relatively open structure underneath considerable thickness of overburden, it is metastable and the structure will collapse under conditions of additional loading and or wetting (Derbyshire et al). It is this metastability that results in the most widespread and costly problem of the engineering geology of loess: hydroconsolidation and subsidence...|$|E

Palaeodose estimates based on Ti centers are presented both for grains containing a mixture of Ti-Li and Ti-H centers (group 1), and grains containing only the Li compensated type of Ti centers (group 2). The results are obtained using the regenerative dose method after thermal zeroing. The separate Ti-Li and Ti-H palaeodoses from group I show severe over- and underestimates of the expected burial dose, respectively.

40|$|Abstract: Sand {{collected}} from <b>aeolian</b> <b>deposit</b> is expensive due to unwanted cost of transportation from natural sources. Large scale exploitation of natural sand creates environmental impact on society. River sand is {{most commonly used}} fine aggregate in concrete but due to acute shortage in many areas, availability, cost & environmental impact are the major concern (Ahmed et. al., 1989). To overcome from this crisis, partial replacement of sand with quarry dust can be an economic alternative. In developing countries like India, quarry dust has been rampantly used in different construction purposes but replacement technology has emerged as an innovative development to civil engineering material. Design mix of M 20 grade concrete with replacement of 0 %, 20 %, 30 %, 40 %, and 50 % of quarry dust organized as M 1, M 2, M 3, M 4 and M 5 respectively have been considered for laboratory analysis viz. slump test, compaction factor test, compressive strength (cube, cylindrical sample), split tensile strength, flexural strength, modulus of elasticity, water absorption of hardened concrete.

The {{sequence of}} nine <b>aeolian</b> <b>deposits,</b> including eight palaeosols and capped by the contemporary soil, provides evidence of environmental changes which have occurred during the Holocene in the cold Fuegian steppe, beginning as early as the Late Glacial-Early Holocene transition. A chronostratigraphy is provided by guanaco (Lama guanicoe) and Canidae bones embedded within palaeosols and organic matter content, radiocarbon dated from 9951 ± 59 BP (11, 304 cal BP) at the base of the sequence to 434 ± 43 BP (471 cal BP) near the top. A tephra layer between Palaeosols 4 and 5 is interpreted from its geochemical fingerprint as the product of one of the mid-Holocene eruptions of Mt. Burney, located in the Southern Patagonian Andes. It is suggested that the accumulation of the aeolian sediments occurred throughout most of the Holocene, as a result of both local acquisition of fine particles derived from the weathering and erosion of the basal Neogene marine sediments, and deflation from the intermittently dry lake bed, as well as deposition of material transported by wind from more distant sources.
