5000|$|Depending on the jurisdiction, {{even after}} {{eviction}} the landlord may still bring suit against a tenant for [...] "holdover rent" [...] (i.e., rent {{for the period}} between {{the date of the}} lawsuit and the date of <b>actual</b> <b>eviction)</b> and other items such as unpaid utilities or property damage.|$|E
40|$|The {{official}} narrative presents Ahmedabad as {{a pioneer}} in urban transformation in India. This paper questions whether these claims engage with {{the experiences of the}} urban poor in Ahmedabad by examining processes around the Sabarmati Riverfront Development Project. Highlighted here are the roles played by the architectural consultancy, city administrators and political managers, as well as community groups, civil society and academic institutions. The efficiency of the administration showed an active anti-poor stance in the court proceedings and in the violence of <b>actual</b> <b>evictions</b> and post-eviction suffering. The evidence presented here also shows how “world-class ” urban planning has facilitated yet another blatant instance of “accumulation by dispossession” via the flow of the Sabarmati...|$|R
40|$|The {{transfer}} {{under the}} Public Bodies Act {{of the functions}} of British Waterways (BW) to a charity will mean that a charity will exercise statutory enforcement powers including the power to seize and destroy boats that are people's homes without payment of compensation. Enforcement powers of this nature will therefore be exercised by a body that {{will no longer be}} subject to any public scrutiny and thus will be unaccountable. This will reduce the already minimal rights and avenues for redress available to boat dwellers and will put thousands of people at increased risk of homelessness. Boat dwellers have no legal protection for their homes and most moorings have no security of tenure. BW carries out routine and systematic harassment, threats of homelessness and <b>actual</b> <b>evictions</b> directed against the adults and children who live on boats on its canals and rivers. This harassment is sanctioned by the Directors of BW but has no sound basis in law. If the landlord of a house treated their tenants in the same way they would be convicted of a criminal offence...|$|R
50|$|Willie was {{expelled}} from the Big Brother house on Day 14 after head butting Joe, who had made comments in retaliation to comments made by Willie. Moments before the incident with Joe, Willie told everyone {{that he would do}} anything to get himself removed before the <b>actual</b> live <b>eviction</b> that week. Willie proceeded to throw food at Janelle and call other female HouseGuests explicit names, before ending his rampage with the headbutt incident. He was immediately called into the Diary Room and expelled from the game. Minutes later the remaining HouseGuests were informed by producer Allison Grodner that Willie had been permanently removed from the game and the game would continue as normal.|$|R
5000|$|... "We {{appreciate}} {{the county of}} Los Angeles giving the Yes on S campaign some last-minute critical media attention, on our key issue: that developers of luxury towers evict poor and working-class Angelenos every day," [...] Stewart responded. A leader of one tenant group, the Eviction Defense Network, agreed, calling the tactic [...] "forceful". Stewart further speculated that the sheriff might have been acting {{at the behest of}} opponents of Measure S, since they had used the same political consulting firm. Later the CPLA refused to retract the mailer, calling it protected political speech, and expressing doubt that anyone could seriously have assumed it was an <b>actual</b> <b>eviction</b> notice.|$|E
5000|$|In late February the CPLA {{sent out}} another {{controversial}} mailer. This one {{appeared to be}} an eviction notice, using the same format as real ones, although there was small print identifying it as a paid political advertisement and the line with the purported case number was filled in with [...] "This could be you or a loved one!" [...] Tenants' organizations received calls from worried members who thought they were real, leading the head of one such group to call the CPLA [...] "outrageous and irresponsible". The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, whose name was on the mailer, wrote to CPLA demanding they cease and desist from using their name, or at least follow up and tell recipients the mailer was not an <b>actual</b> <b>eviction</b> notice.|$|E
25|$|The {{bulk of the}} 103,957 acres {{the company}} owned in the {{district}} were undeveloped, and local people wanted access to this land. After the company introduced restrictions {{on the size of}} the gardens that tenants could plant for their own use on company land in 1945, many of them refused to pay any rent. Some 1,250 tenants were threatened with eviction and, although the government limited the <b>actual</b> <b>evictions</b> to 120, those spared eviction still felt resentment towards the company. There was a further crisis in 1952 and 1953 when a collapse in world tea prices put the British Central Africa Company into a financial deficit. Its local General Manager tried to make good the loss of income by increasing tenants’ rents. Until 1952, the maximum rent permitted by the 1928 Natives on Private Estates Ordinance was 20 shillings or £1 but in that year the 1952 Africans on Private Estates Ordinance proposed an increase in the maximum to 52 shillings and sixpence (£2.625) from July 1953. Although most other estate companies agreed not to charge this maximum, the British Central Africa Company demanded the 52 shillings and sixpence maximum from December 1952. A number of tenants resisted the increase, and the company issued eviction notices, which the government was legally obliged to enforce, but was reluctant to do. In June 1953, the company agreed not to enforce either the evictions or the rent increase. However, its tenants had begun to clear land on undeveloped parts of the company's estates and start cultivation. Many local people refused to pay taxes or attend courts, and riots broke out in Cholo in August 1953, leading to eleven dead and seventy-two injured. Following these riots, Governor Colby urged that another 300,000 acres, including much British Central Africa Company land, should be acquired through voluntary purchase, but the Colonial Office did not support this, so little happened. In 1963, the company still retained a 3,500 acre tea plantation and two tea factories.|$|R
40|$|This article {{examines}} the transformations in form and function of rituals in the squatting movement in Amsterdam. Upon roaring early years, rituals emerged around the search for houses to squat, the <b>actual</b> squatting and <b>evictions.</b> These rituals were recognized and used by squatters {{as well as other}} parties and they have contributed to the reduction of violence. Meanwhile, squatting in the Netherlands was prohibited and the question arises if, in this new situation, form and function of rituals have changed too. The findings shed some light on the broader link between rituals and resistance...|$|R
