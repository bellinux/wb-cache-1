Escape for him seemed impossible. It seemed absurd to hope {{that he would not be}} hit; I only hoped that he would be hit just a little, in the arm, the shoulder, or the leg.|$|E

It seemed like an age before I could get the ball {{in my hands and}} then, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> over to first, it seemed like the longest throw I ever had to make. The first baseman was the tallest in the league, but I threw the ball far over his head.|$|E
2500|$|<b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked,</b> thrones {{were set}} in place, and the Ancient of Days took his seat. His {{clothing}} was as white as snow; the hair of his head was white like wool. His throne was flaming with fire, and its wheels were all ablaze. A river of fire was flowing, coming out from before him. Thousands upon thousands attended him; ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him. The court was seated, and the books were opened. Daniel 7:9, 10 (NIV) ...|$|E

2500|$|Now <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> at {{the living}} creatures, I saw a wheel {{on the earth}} beside the living creatures, {{one for each of}} the four of them. As for the {{appearance}} of the wheels and their construction: their appearance was like the gleaming of beryl. And the four had the same likeness, their appearance and construction being as it were a wheel within a wheel. When they went, they went in any of their four directions without turning as they went. And their rims were tall and awesome, and the rims of all four were full of eyes all around. Book of Ezekiel Chapter 1:15-18, Bible, English Standard Version ...|$|E
2500|$|... "On the {{afternoon}} of October 19, 1899, I climbed a tall cherry tree and, armed with a saw which I still have, and a hatchet, started to trim the dead limbs from the cherry tree. It {{was one of the}} quiet, colorful afternoons of sheer beauty which we have in October in New England, and <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> towards the fields at the east, I imagined how wonderful it would be to make some device which had even the possibility of ascending to Mars. I was a different boy when I descended the tree from when I ascended for existence at last seemed very purposive." [...] (Written later, in an autobiographical sketch) ...|$|E
2500|$|British occultist Aleister Crowley {{reported}} witnessing what {{he referred}} to as [...] "globular electricity" [...] during a thunderstorm on Lake Pasquaney in New Hampshire in 1916. [...] He was sheltered in a small cottage when he [...] "noticed, with what I can only describe as calm amazement, that a dazzling globe of electric fire, apparently between six and twelve inches (15–30cm) in diameter, was stationary about six inches below {{and to the right}} of my right knee. <b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> at it, it exploded with a sharp report quite impossible to confuse with the continuous turmoil of the lightning, thunder and hail, or that of the lashed water and smashed wood which was creating a pandemonium outside the cottage. I felt a very slight shock {{in the middle of my}} right hand, which was closer to the globe than any other part of my body." ...|$|E

2500|$|Nakasone {{describes}} his early childhood and youth as a happy one, and {{himself as a}} [...] "quiet, easy-going child" [...] nicknamed [...] "Yat-chan". He attended a local primary school in Takasaki and was a poor student until the fourth grade, after which he excelled and {{was at the top}} of his class. He entered Shizuoka High School in 1935, where he excelled in history and literature and learned to speak fluent French. In the autumn of 1938, Nakasone entered Tokyo Imperial University. During World War II, he was a commissioned officer and paymaster in the Imperial Japanese Navy. He later wrote of his return to Tokyo in August 1945 after Japan's surrender: [...] "I stood vacantly amid the ruins of Tokyo, after discarding my officer's short sword and removing the epaulettes of my uniform. <b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> around me I swore to resurrect my homeland from the ashes of defeat". Nakasone is the only postwar Prime Minister to have seen active service.|$|E

But there was something to this character that had a little whisker of playfulness in there, like a cat or something." [...] After creating the theme, Callery expanded it, adding a [...] "fun" [...] rhythmic quality, and eventually fully orchestrating it to include a piano, which he played himself, as well as instruments such as the acoustic bass, and additional sound design. Regarding the electric guitar's entrance, Callery pointed out that it got [...] "bigger there because <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> at the graphics, the lights got a little more strobe-y.
