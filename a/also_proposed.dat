5|$|Another {{model of}} the {{evolution}} of this genus, <b>also</b> <b>proposed</b> by Casier in 1960, is that the direct ancestor of the Carcharocles is the shark Otodus obliquus, which lived from 60 mya to 13 mya during the Paleocene and Miocene epochs. In this model, O. obliquus evolved into O. aksuaticus, which evolved into C. auriculatus, and then into C. angustidens, and then into C. chubutensis, and then finally into C. megalodon. The evolution of this lineage is characterized by the increase of serrations, the widening of the crown, the development of a more triangular shape, and the disappearance of the lateral cusps. The genus Otodus is ultimately derived from Cretolamna, a shark from the Cretaceous period.|$|E
