40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to compare and {{evaluate}} the welfare of cows kept on two conventional and two organic farms using Animal Needs Index (<b>ANI)</b> <b>system.</b> The system is rapid and easy to use. Its most important advantage is that it provides a final score and thus allows one to rate the evaluated object on a scale reflecting the level of welfare on the respective farm and thus compare farms with different ways of housing. The system showed a very good welfare level on two of four evaluated farms, both with free housing of cows, one organic and one conventional...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{purpose of}} the present study was to assess the animal welfare in a dairy cow farm in tether system, from Cluj county. The {{evaluation}} has been made on the basis of the Austrian <b>ANI</b> <b>system</b> and the Guide for inspection note completion with regard to animal protection and welfare elaborated by ANSVSA, Romania. The parameters needed for the assessment have been determined by methods specific to veterinary hygiene. The results obtained through both assessment systems show a poor welfare of the dairy cows from the studied farm, getting a final score of 19 points in ANL system and 2. 8 points according to the ANSVSA guide...|$|E
40|$|An anaerobic, nonsporulating, gram-positive {{bacterium}} was isolated from blood and bile pus cultures of a 70 -year-old man with bacteremic acute cholecystitis. The API 20 A system {{showed that it}} was 70 % Actinomyces naeslundii and 30 % Bifidobacterium species, whereas the Vitek <b>ANI</b> <b>system</b> and the ATB ID 32 A Expression system showed that it was "unidentified. " The 16 S rRNA gene of the strain was amplified and sequenced. There were 3 base differences between the nucleotide sequence of the isolate and that of Lactobacillus salivarius subsp. salivarius or L. salivarius subsp. salicinius, indicating that the isolate was a strain of L. salivarius. The patient responded to cholecystectomy and a 2 -week course of antibiotic treatment. Identification of the organism {{in the present study}} was important because the duration of antibiotic therapy would have been entirely different depending on the organism. If the bacterium had been identified as Actinomyces, penicillin for 6 months would have been the regimen of choice. However, it was Lactobacillus, and a 2 -week course of antibiotic was sufficient. published_or_final_versio...|$|E

The system also provides automatic call routing, which means citizens are automatically routed to the 911 center with {{jurisdiction over the}} cell tower the call is routed through.|$|R
40|$|In the Siberian hamster, Phodopus sungorus, short-day photoperiods {{induce the}} winter phenotype, which in males {{includes}} {{a decrease in}} the production of androgens and changes in physiology to inhibit reproduction. Motoneurones of the spinal nucleus of the bulbocavernosus (SNB) and their target muscles, the bulbocavernosus and the levator <b>ani,</b> a neuromuscular <b>system</b> involved in male copulation, also display seasonal plasticity in P. sungorus. It is not known whether the plasticity seen in the SNB system of gonadally intact hamsters is due to the effects of photoperiod per se, or to the photoperiod-induced changes in androgen production. To answer this question, we castrated adult male hamsters from long days and then implanted them with capsules containing either testosterone or blanks. Half of the hamsters from each hormone condition were moved into short photoperiod (8 : 16 h light/dark cycle) while the rest were maintained under long-day conditions (15 : 9 h light/dark cycle). After 15 weeks, many measures of the SNB system, such as somata size and weight of target muscles, responded only to androgen, not to photoperiod. However, there were effects of photoperiod on the neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) that were independent of androgen status. For example, the number of synaptic zones per NMJ and the area of the NMJs were significantl...|$|R
40|$|Traditional ways of {{identification}} of anaerobic Gram-positive non-sporulating bacilli by {{isolation of the}} organism and studying it phenotypically by elucidation of its morphologic and biochemical characteristics and metabolic end products {{are associated with a}} need for special equipment and expertise, and strains that are "unidentified" because of ambiguous biochemical profiles. In this study, an anaerobic Gram-positive non-sporulating bacterium was isolated from the intrauterine contraceptive device of a 36 -year old woman with pyosalpinx. The Vitek <b>system</b> (<b>ANI)</b> showed that it was 99 % Propionibacterium granulosum; whereas the API system (20 A) showed that it was 78 % Actinomyces meyeri/odontolyticus. The 16 S ribosomal RNA gene of the strain was amplified and sequenced. There was 0 base difference between the isolate and A. odontolyticus (GenBank Accession no. AJ 234047), indicating the isolate most closely resembled a strain of A. odontolyticus. Identification of the organism in this study was important because the duration of antibiotic therapy would be entirely different. In the present case, identification of the bacterium as A. odontolyticus inferred that the patient suffered from an intermediate form of pelvic actinomycosis. A prolonged course of antibiotics would be more desirable, as the relapse rate of actinomycosis after a short course of antibiotics is high. Â© 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} some novel {{mechanical and}} electronic design {{aspects of a}} high frequency Ambient Noise Imaging (<b>ANI)</b> <b>system</b> being built at the Acoustic Research Laboratory of the National University of Singapore. Modularity in construction of the array permits upgrading and servicing of the array at sensor module level. A neoprene acoustic window without any coupling medium is used on ceramic faces in place of conventional potting. This greatly simplifies the design and maintenance of the array. Test results showed that sensors with dry-coupled neoprene perform as well as ones with conventional polyurethane-based encapsulation. A hierarchical noise reduction strategy is employed in the array design to reduce performance degradation due to rear-propagating noise and structural noise transmission. The whole array has been engineered so as to keep the cabling to a minimum. Different units, called modules, of the array can be simply plugged in or taken out {{without the need for}} soldering or using interconnecting cables. The mechanical design of the array has been optimised using FEM analysis. Signal acquisition and conditioning electronics are placed well close to the sensors to give a compact module design and it provides a digital output. Another novel part of the design is the use of 54 Pentium processors networked in two loop topologies employing the Fibre Channel protocol for the wet-end processing. Each of the loops carries 0. 8 Gbit/S of data. Results of the sensitivity and beam pattern measurements carried out on a prototype array, a scaled down version of the main array, are also presented.

40|$|The {{class of}} {{acoustic}} imaging techniques known as Ambient Noise Imaging started with Acoustic Daylight, {{which has since}} been joined {{over the past decade}} by several other independent algorithms. To date, the algorithms described in the literature have generally been statistical approaches, treating the insonification by sources of opportunity as a random variable. In warm shallow waters, where snapping shrimp abound, there is the possibility of considering each locally-generated snap to be a deterministic source, and to beamform and search for scattering from possible targets in a coherent manner, using the direct received snap as a matched filter. Depending on the snapping shrimp density (number of snaps per square metre per second), there is usually a substantial gap in time between each locally-generated snap and the next (following a Poisson distribution in time), during which coherent matched filtering can be applied to search for scattered replicas of the snap. Within a range of 100 - 200 m, depending on the snap density, it is estimated that this method can produce more accurate and high-dynamic range images compared to statistical techniques, comparable to a multi-static active system. While the range is very short compared to most sonar <b>systems,</b> <b>ANI</b> is completely covert and can image completely silent targets. In shallow water, where the threat is often from smaller, very quiet vehicles and divers, this could be a useful tool in the shallow-water ASW armoury. Furthermore, using snapping shrimp implies a diversity of source locations and orientations to possible targets that potentially provides more information than conventional multi-static active systems, while remaining completely covert...|$|R
