5|$|The late 1960s {{and early}} 1970s saw several {{countries}} experimenting with gas turbine trains.

5|$|The {{onset of}} the Second World War {{demonstrated}} that the League had failed in its primary purpose, the prevention of another world war.

5|$|General sejm was {{the highest}} organ of {{collective}} and consensus-based state power. The Sejm's supreme court, presided over by the king, decided the most serious of legal cases.

5|$|In 1908, Zermelo {{published}} his axiom system for set theory. He had two motivations {{for developing the}} axiom system: eliminating the paradoxes and securing his proof of the well-ordering theorem. Zermelo had proved this theorem in 1904 using the axiom of choice, but his proof was criticized for <b>a</b> <b>variety</b> <b>of</b> <b>reasons.</b> His response to the criticism included his axiom system and a new proof of the well-ordering theorem. His axioms support this new proof, and they eliminate the paradoxes by restricting the formation of sets.|$|E
5|$|The ABJM theory {{appearing}} in {{this version of}} the correspondence is also interesting for <b>a</b> <b>variety</b> <b>of</b> <b>reasons.</b> Introduced by Aharony, Bergman, Jafferis, and Maldacena, it is closely related to another quantum field theory called Chernâ€“Simons theory. The latter theory was popularized by Witten in the late 1980s because of its applications to knot theory. In addition, the ABJM theory serves as a semi-realistic simplified model for solving problems that arise in condensed matter physics.|$|E

5|$|The Uniforms of the Confederate States {{military}} forces were the uniforms {{used by the}} Confederate Army and Navy during the American Civil War, from 1861 to 1865.

5|$|The {{solar power}} source is via {{photovoltaic}} modules that convert light directly to electricity. However, this differs from, {{and should not be}} confused with concentrated solar power, the other large-scale solar generation technology, which uses heat to drive a variety of conventional generator systems. Both approaches have their own advantages and disadvantages, but to date, for <b>a</b> <b>variety</b> <b>of</b> <b>reasons,</b> photovoltaic technology has seen much wider use in the field. , PV systems outnumber concentrators by about 40 to 1.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{discovery}} of many hundreds of Iron Age sites in Scotland {{there is still a}} great deal that remains to be explained {{about the nature of the}} Celtic life in the early Christian era. Unfortunately radiocarbon dating for this period is problematic and chronological sequences are poorly understood. For <b>a</b> <b>variety</b> <b>of</b> <b>reasons</b> much of the archaeological work to date in Scotland has concentrated on the islands of the west and north and both excavations and analysis of societal structures on the mainland are more limited in scope.|$|E
40|$|According to the {{principle}} that â€˜oughtâ€™ implies â€˜canâ€™, it is never the case {{that you ought to}} do something you cannot do. While many accept this principle in some form, it also has its share of critics, and thus it seems desirable if an argument can be offered in its support. The aim {{of this paper is to}} examine a particular way in which {{the principle}} has been defended, namely, by appeal to considerations of fairness. In a nutshell, the idea (due to David Copp) is that moral requirements we cannot comply with would be unfair, and there cannot be unfair moral requirements. I discuss several ways of spelling out the argument, and argue that all are unsatisfactory for <b>a</b> <b>variety</b> <b>of</b> <b>reason...</b>|$|R

5|$|During {{trials of}} the first submarines, the {{propulsion}} system {{was found to be}} prone to failure for <b>a</b> <b>variety</b> <b>of</b> <b>reasons.</b> Most failures were attributed to the fifteen-tank diesel fuel system: the tanks were designed to fill with salt water as they were emptied to maintain neutral buoyancy, but water would regularly enter the engines due to a combination of poor design, gravity separation of the fuel and water being insufficient, and operator error resulting from poor training. Problems were also caused by bacterial contamination of the diesel fuel, which, along with the salt water, would cause the fuel pumps to rust and other components to seize. The fuel-related issues were solved by installing coalescers, improving training and operational procedures, and adding biocides to the fuel.|$|E
5|$|On 28 June 1914 the Bosnian-Serb Gavrilo Princip assassinated {{the heir}} to the throne of Austria-Hungary, Archduke Franz Ferdinand, in the name of Serbian nationalism.

Things that might affect the degree of finish achieved on a particular giornata include the heat and humidity of the day and the length of daylight hours.
