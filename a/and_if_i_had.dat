Hulse went on to describe a sing-song which [...] "ended up with 'Auld lang syne' which we all, English, Scots, Irish, Prussians, Württenbergers, etc, joined in. It was absolutely astounding, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> seen it on a cinematograph film I should have sworn that it was faked!" ...|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Jay Kogen and Wallace Wolodarsky and {{directed}} by David Silverman. Professor Frink makes his debut in this episode and star of the 1950s TV comedy The Honeymooners, Audrey Meadows, guest stars as Beatrice [...] "Bea" [...] Simmons, Grampa's new girlfriend. It features cultural references to films such as Tom Jones <b>and</b> <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>Had</b> a Million, and the Star Wars and Batman film franchises. Since airing, the episode has received mixed reviews from television critics. It acquired a Nielsen rating of 12.3, and was the highest-rated show on the Fox network the week it aired.|$|E
500|$|Throughout {{his tenure}} in Australia, Lansbury sent letters home, {{revealing}} {{the truth about}} conditions facing immigrants. To a friend [...] he wrote in March 1885: [...] "Mechanics are not wanted. Farm labourers are not wanted... Hundreds {{of men and women}} are not able to get work... The streets are foul day and night, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> a sister I would shoot her dead rather than see her brought out to this little hell on earth". In May 1885, having received from Isaac Brine sufficient funds for a passage home, the Lansbury family left Australia for good.|$|E

500|$|Actress Jennifer Aniston made a guest {{appearance}} on [...] "All Mixed Up". Speculations of her appearance initially surfaced a year {{prior to the}} confirmation, and upon hearing of it, Cougar Town co-creator Bill Lawrence initially supported such allegations. Lawrence stated that he announced that Aniston would appear on the television series, but had not contacted her or her representatives. Eventually, Lawrence averted away from his claims and stated that [...] "nothing's happened yet". He continued in his interview with E! Online: [...] "I'd kill to get Jennifer on the show, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> any inclination it was happening, I would be telling everybody 'cause I don't really give a sh-t. I would love it to happen and the second it did I would tell everybody in the world, but nothing's happened." ...|$|E
500|$|While {{making his}} way there he ran into the French fleet on 9 June, the French having sailed from Toulon some days earlier and headed east along the coast. Despite {{pressing}} on sail Speedy was overrun and captured. Eyre was taken aboard one of the French ships, and later transferred to the flagship of the fleet's commander, Rear-Admiral Pierre Martin. Martin {{asked him if he}} had heard of the decree from the National Convention which declared that 'no quarter should be given to either the English or the Hanoverians'. Eyre replied that they had not, on which he was told by Martin that [...] "...I must tell you that it is now un guerre à mort <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> been the first to come alongside of you, I should have instantly sent you to the bottom." [...] At this point the main British fleet was seen approaching, and Eyre was hurried back to the first ship he had been brought onto, and the French hurried into Gourjean roads, taking Speedy and the captured British crew with them.|$|E
500|$|In 1755, Governor Arthur Dobbs {{ordered the}} {{construction}} of a fortified log structure for the protection of settlers in Rowan County from various Native American threats, including assaults from Cherokee, Catawba, Shawnee, and Delaware raiding parties. [...] Dobbs stated in a letter on August 24, 1755, to the Board of Trade that the fort was needed [...] "to assist the back settlers and be a retreat to them as it was beyond the well settled Country, only straggling settlements behind them, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> placed [...] beyond the Settlements without a fortification they might be exposed, and be no retreat for the Settlers, and the Indians might pass them and murder the Inhabitants, and retire before they durst go to give them notice". [...] The new frontier settlements required regular protection, as the settlers in the area attributed many crimes and forms of harassment to denizens of nearby Catawba and Cherokee towns. [...] Furthermore, Governor Dobbs was concerned for his own investments, as he owned more than [...] of land on the Rocky River, approximately [...] south of the Fourth Creek Meeting House.|$|E

500|$|Mullen and The Edge both {{agreed that}} playing the Sarajevo concert {{had been the}} {{highlight}} of their careers; Mullen said, [...] "here's no doubt that that is an experience I will never forget {{for the rest of}} my life. <b>And</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to spend 20 years in the band just to play that show, [...] I think it would have been worthwhile." [...] Bono described it as [...] "one of the toughest and one of the sweetest nights of my life", saying of the audience, [...] "I think they wanted, more than anything, a return to normalcy. That's what these people want, it's what they deserve." [...] He also speculated that the loss of his voice had [...] "allowed room for Sarajevo to take the gig away from us. They could see that things could go horribly wrong, they'd gone to a lot of trouble to come here, and they were just going to make it happen. And they did." [...] After the completion of the PopMart Tour, he said, [...] "it was amazing and confounding to discover that on our most 'pop' of tours some of the best shows were in political hotspots like Santiago, Sarajevo, Tel Aviv [...] anywhere music meant more than entertainment". Following the concert, President Izetbegović presented Bono with an honorary Bosnian passport, in recognition of his humanitarian efforts during the war.|$|E
500|$|The European leg of {{the tour}} {{featured}} two highlights. The group's 20 September 1997 show in Reggio Emilia was attended by over 150,000 people, setting a world record for the largest paying audience for a one-act show. U2 also performed in Sarajevo on 23 September, making them the first major group to stage a concert there following the Bosnian War. Mullen described the show as [...] "an experience I will never forget {{for the rest of}} my life, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to spend 20 years in the band just to play that show, and have done that, I think it would have been worthwhile." [...] Bono called the show [...] "one of the toughest and one of the sweetest nights of my life". The tour concluded in March 1998 with gross revenues of US$171.7million and 3.9million tickets sold. The following month, U2 appeared on the 200th episode of the animated sitcom The Simpsons, in which Homer Simpson disrupts the band on stage during a PopMart concert. In November 1998, U2 released their first compilation album, The Best of 1980–1990, which featured a re-recording of a 1987 B-side, [...] "Sweetest Thing", as its single. The album attained the highest first-week sales in the US of any greatest hits record, while [...] "Sweetest Thing" [...] topped the singles charts in Ireland and Canada.|$|E
500|$|After {{the trial}} Le Mesurier kept a low profile, after {{unsuccessful}} attempts to sell [...] "the real story" [...] to national newspapers. In June 1981, {{in a series}} of articles printed in the News of the World, Holmes reasserted his allegation that Thorpe had asked him to kill Scott: [...] "The incitement charge which Jeremy faced was true, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> gone into the witness box I'd have had to tell the truth." [...] Holmes, who died in 1990, had previously admitted his participation in a conspiracy to [...] "frighten" [...] Scott, though not to kill him. Bessell's account of the affair was published in America in 1980. He died in 1985; his final years were devoted to a campaign to stop the erosion of the San Diego beaches in California. Newton, like Le Mesurier, attempted to cash in on the case, but failed to find a newspaper willing to print his story. Scott's last recorded comments on the affair, immediately after the trial verdict, were that he was unsurprised by the outcome, but was upset by the aspersions on his character made by the judge from the safety of the bench. [...] In December 2014, Scott, then aged 74, was reported to have recently relocated from Devon to Ireland, although John Preston, in his 2016 account, places him [...] "in a village on Dartmoor... with seventy hens, three horses, a cat, a parrot, a canary, and five dogs".|$|E

2500|$|Although {{prolific}} {{during his}} short career, and {{now one of}} the most studied and admired British poets, his reputation rests on a small body of work, centred on the Odes, and only in the creative outpouring of the last years of his short life was he able to express the inner intensity for which he has been lauded since his death. Keats was convinced that he had made no mark in his lifetime. Aware that he was dying, he wrote to Fanny Brawne in February 1820, [...] "I have left no immortal work behind me – nothing to make my friends proud of my memory – but I have lov'd the principle of beauty in all things, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> had time I would have made myself remember'd.

2500|$|Asked by Samuel French, Inc. if {{he could}} name the playwright who had most {{influenced}} him, Heinze said, [...] "If I were darker, it would be Orton. If I were more laconic, it would be Pinter. If I were more lyrically erudite, it would be Stoppard. If I had ten additional brains, it would be Shakespeare. Hm. Everyone seems to be English. [...] If I were more Irish, it would be Beckett. (<b>And</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> more savoir faire, it would be Molière.)" [...] He added, [...] "I think all my sources of inspiration are unconventional. It's the feeling of something unconventional that {{makes me want to}} write the play. At least for a full-length play that’s true. I think I wouldn't want to invest the time if I didn’t have that feeling." ...|$|E
2500|$|Frank Zappa, who {{had been}} {{interested}} in film since high school, decided to develop a film vehicle for the Mothers of Invention, entitled Uncle Meat. The proposed film would combine elements of science fiction and road stories inspired by the band's sexual escapades. Subsequently, Zappa began working on a project called No Commercial Potential, which eventually became the albums We're Only in It for the Money, Lumpy Gravy, Cruising with Ruben & the Jets and Uncle Meat. Zappa stated, [...] "It's all one album.

2500|$|Since the 1970s, Clapton {{considered}} himself a [...] "car enthusiast" [...] and often stated {{his passion for}} the Ferrari brand.

In 2010, he explained that for him [...] "Ferrari has always been the number one car" [...] to own and drive, and that he always supported Ferrari on the road and in Formula One motor racing. In 2012, Ferrari honoured Clapton with the one-off special project car, the Ferrari SP12 EC. In 2014, Clapton explained that Ferrari is still his favourite car brand. Among the other vehicles Clapton owns or has owned during his life are a vintage Mini Cooper Radford which was a gift from George Harrison.|$|E
