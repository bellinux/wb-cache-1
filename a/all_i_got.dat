Homer says that, since taking Focusyn, Bart has gone [...] "from Goofus to Gallant", {{a reference to}} the characters Goofus and Gallant from the children's magazine Highlights. When Lou sketches Bart based on Homer and Marge's description he ends up drawing Dennis from the comic strip Dennis the Menace.

500|$|During the Verizon Ladies First Tour {{which also}} {{featured}} Alicia Keys, Missy Elliott and Tamia, Beyoncé performed [...] "Me, Myself and I" [...] in New York City {{to an audience}} of over 20,000. Before singing, she told the audience {{that she was going to}} sing about [...] "a relationship horror story". She pulled a pair of red panties out of her purse, saying that these were not hers but belonged to her cheating boyfriend's mistress. During the performance, Beyoncé held out the microphone for the audience's response, which was [...] "is <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> in the end".

500|$|In 1983, Gunn {{travelled}} {{with the}} Scotland Under-19s to Mexico for the 1983 FIFA World Youth Championship. Gunn played {{in all four}} of Scotland's matches {{and it was a}} formative experience, as he faced a variety of challenges in the tournament. The adidas ball in use [...] "really zipped through the air", which encouraged long-range shots at the high altitude. In the first match, against South Korea, an element of the 26,000 crowd [...] "clearly didn't like us at <b>all</b> ... <b>I</b> <b>got</b> absolutely pelted with coins ... and rotten fruit". The final insult was when he was hit {{on the back of the}} neck by a rancid-smelling plastic bag containing rotten fish. [...] Gunn found it [...] "intimidation ... a nightmare" [...] but adopted the strategy of patrolling the edge of his area to stay out of range and had [...] "one of the best games of my life": he kept a clean sheet as Scotland won 2–0. Scotland's coach and future manager of the full international team Andy Roxburgh told Gunn [...] "it was the best performance he'd ever seen from a Scottish goalkeeper, at any level." [...] The final group match, which Scotland needed to win in order to progress, was against the home side, Mexico. The official attendance at the Azteca Stadium was 86,582, although Gunn believes the true figure was over 100,000. Once more, Gunn was targeted with a variety of missiles, including a bottle of Johnnie Walker, but as Scotland held on to their early 1–0 lead, the fans became disillusioned with their own team and switched to sending a [...] "hail of bottles and coins" [...] on the Mexican players. Scotland lost 1–0 in the quarter final against Poland.|$|E

2500|$|On June 12, it was {{reported}} that Red Sox closer Jonathan Papelbon had made comments about the incident stating that in his opinion, it was [...] "a bunch of bull what [...] did. <b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> to say is what comes around goes around, man. Payback's a bitch, I'll tell you what", and that [...] "this thing isn't all settled and done." [...] Papelbon also said that things would be different at Tropicana Field the next time the Red Sox were there, as opposed to the last time in which the Red Sox were swept by the Rays {{for the first time in}} franchise history. In that series from June 30 to July 2, the Rays swept the Red Sox at home for the second time in the season, and Papelbon never pitched in the series.|$|E
2500|$|In 1994, Khan had {{admitted}} that, during Test matches, he [...] "occasionally scratched {{the side of}} the ball and lifted the seam." [...] He had also added, [...] "Only once did I use an object. When Sussex were playing Hampshire in 1981 the ball was not deviating at <b>all.</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> the 12th man to bring out a bottle top and it started to move around a lot." [...] In 1996, Khan successfully defended himself in a libel action brought forth by former English captain and all-rounder Ian Botham and batsman Allan Lamb over comments they alleged were made by Khan in two articles about the above-mentioned ball-tampering and another article published in an Indian magazine, India Today. They claimed that, in the latter publication, Khan had called the two cricketers [...] "racist, ill-educated and lacking in class." [...] Khan protested that he had been misquoted, saying that he was defending himself after having admitted that he tampered with a ball in a county match 18 years ago. Khan won the libel case, which the judge labelled a [...] "complete exercise in futility", with a 10–2 majority decision by the jury.|$|E
