500|$|Lichtenstein {{altered the}} {{composition}} {{to make the}} image more compelling, by making the exploding plane more prominent compared to the attacking plane than in the original. The smoke trail of the missile becomes a horizontal line. The flames of the explosion dominate the right panel, but the pilot and the airplane in the left panel are the narrative focus. They exemplify Lichtenstein's painstaking detailing of physical features such as the aircraft's cockpit. The other element of the narrative content is a text balloon that contains the following text: [...] "I pressed the fire control... and <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> <b>me</b> rockets blazed through the sky..." [...] This is among the text {{believed to have been}} written by All-American Men of War editor Robert Kanigher. The yellow word [...] "WHAAM!", altered from the red in the original comic-book panel and white in the pencil sketch, links the yellow of the explosion below it with the textbox to the left and the flames of the missile below the attacking plane.|$|E
500|$|In September 2005, Žigić {{signed a}} one-year {{extension}} to his contract, {{which had been}} due to expire {{at the end of}} the season. He helped his team progress through the qualifying rounds of the UEFA Cup, and according to Reuters' correspondent, [...] "capped a brilliant individual performance with two goals" [...] as well as providing the cross for Milan Purović as Red Star beat Roma 3–1 in the third match of the group stage. His first goal, a header, appeared to have been scored from an offside position, but for the second, in the 86th minute, he dispossessed Philippe Mexès, evaded two more opponents, and bent the ball into the top corner from [...] with his weaker left foot.

500|$|Speculation ignited that Ponting was an {{outsider}} {{to be selected}} for the Australian squad on their 1993 tour to England. Of the speculation, Ponting said [...] "At {{the start of the}} season I was wondering whether or not I'd play Shield cricket this year and all of a sudden there's talk in the papers that I'm a chance go on an Australian tour of England. I think it's way out of reach — there are blokes like [...] Jamie Siddons who have scored 20 or 30 first-class centuries who are <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> <b>me.</b> Nevertheless, Shipperd thought Ponting could handle the experience: [...] "A lot of attention affects different people in different ways, but Ricky is such a well-rounded young fella that it hasn't changed him. I've told him to enjoy the all the attention and if he just keeps on being himself I'm sure he'll cope well with all the success that I imagine he will achieve." [...] The selectors eventually chose Western Australian batsman Damien Martyn for the tour, with Ponting selected in the Academy squad captained by Justin Langer, which toured India and Sri Lanka for seven games in August and September in 1993. Australian success was limited, with only a few wins. No batsman scored a century, but Ponting reached 99 not out in a one-day game in Colombo. He finished the tour second highest in the run-scorers behind Langer.|$|E

The other runners were Star Cutter (Premio Vittorio di Capua), Fair Judgment (Pacemaker International Stakes), Efisio (Emilio Turati), Hadeer (Hungerford Stakes) and Lauries Warrior (Diomed Stakes).

[...] I ran as fast as I could diagonally across the field, realizing that I was hotly pursued. [...] At last I was tackled on what I afterwards learned was about the six-yard line.

Before the race Dettori had requested some [...] "lucky white tape" [...] for his stirrup: the tape had previously been used to repair Willie Carson's saddle before his win on Nashwan and had been applied to Dettori's stirrup when he won on Authorized in 2007.

2500|$|His {{most celebrated}} image is arguably Whaam! (1963, Tate Modern, London), {{one of the}} {{earliest}} known examples of pop art, adapted from a comic-book panel drawn by Irv Novick in a 1962 issue of DC Comics' All-American Men of War. The painting depicts a fighter aircraft firing a rocket into an enemy plane, with a red-and-yellow explosion. The cartoon style is heightened by the use of the [...] onomatopoeic [...] lettering [...] "Whaam!" [...] and the boxed caption [...] "I pressed the fire control... and <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> <b>me</b> rockets blazed through the sky..." [...] This diptych is large in scale, measuring 1.7 x 4.0 m (5ft 7 in x 13ft 4 in). Whaam follows the comic strip-based themes of some of his previous paintings and is part of a body of war-themed work created between 1962 and 1964. It is one of his two notable large war-themed paintings. It was purchased by the Tate Gallery in 1966, after being exhibited at the Leo Castelli Gallery in 1963, and (now at the Tate Modern) has remained in their collection ever since.|$|E

Hamilton said his objective for the Monza weekend was to regain some of the lost ground in the Drivers' Championship and would not cede the challenge until the season-closing round in Abu Dhabi: [...] "It's as big as it's been all season so I've {{got a lot of work}} <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> <b>me</b> but anything can happen in this sport."

He also added that the two-year term under Chappell was [...] "easily the worst and darkest phase" [...] that he could remember. Harbhajan said, [...] "Chappell destroyed Indian cricket {{to such an extent that}} it required at least 3 years to again get back on track. The worst part was some players in that team, who sucked upto the coach and would supply selective misinformation creating bigger rifts". He also talked about the email leak, [...] "Sourav was batting out there in the middle and this man was typing a critical e-mail against Sourav, sitting right there in that dressing room. He had no interest in the proceedings of the match. There were seven guys that he wanted to get rid of. Sourav was his primary target followed by myself, Virender Sehwag, Ashish Nehra, Zaheer Khan and Yuvraj Singh". Laxman was also critical of Chappell in saying that Chappell took Indian cricket [...] "backwards" [...] during his coaching tenure. Laxman also recalled an incident from 2006, [...] "This happened in 2006 at the Wankhede Stadium when India played versus England. Yuvraj Singh was picked <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> <b>me.</b> We were going to the West Indies for a four-Test series after that and he asked me if I would open. I mentioned in 2000 I had decided I would not open anymore after it didn't work for me in the first four years. I was consistent in the middle order since 2000. Chappell asked me my age and said - Don't you think 31 is too young an age to sit at home? I was astonished to hear this. I had a very good run under him.

General Scott described the journey; [...] "We reached Bluff on March 10 and learned that the Indians had gone to the Navajo Mountains, 125 miles southwest of Bluff. We stayed a day in Bluff and then went on to Mexican Hat. Some friendly Navajos met me at Mexican Hat and went <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> <b>me</b> to tell Poke's [...] band of my coming.

Mr. Jenkins, Indian agent at Navajo Springs, Mr. Creel, Colonel Michie, and my orderly accompanied me to Mexican Hat. None of us had a gun. Jim Boy, a friendly Paiute, was sent out to tell the Paiutes that I wanted to see them. Some of them came near where I was camped, but it wasn't until the third day that anyone dared to come to the camp. Posey and four other Indians then came in. We talked a little through a Navajo interpreter. It was in the evening, and I just asked them how they were. I told them I did not feel very well {{and did not want to}} talk to them until the next day. They helped us kill a beef and we gave them a good meal, the first they'd had in weeks. We also gave them some blankets. Posey and his men didn't have any weapons, but I have reason to suspect that they had hidden them nearby. The next day, Poke and Hatch [...] and about 25 others came to see me. I asked them to tell me their troubles. I said that I didn't think they would like to have their children chased by soldiers and cowboys all over the mountains and killed and that I wanted to help them. I didn't try to push the matter with them, but asked them what they wanted to do. After they had talked among themselves, they said they would do anything I wanted them to do." ...|$|E
