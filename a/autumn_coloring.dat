60|$|Lois and her {{companion}} {{stopped on the}} summit of the hill to look at the rolling background of woods, brilliant still with their <b>autumn</b> <b>coloring.</b> The west wind had blown her hair into disorder, but it had blown also the color back into her cheeks. Her eyes were bright, and her laughter infectious. Her companion stooped down and passed his arm through hers, looking into her face admiringly.|$|E
60|$|The {{rain that}} pelted sharply into the puddle before the station at Granada was {{snow on the}} Sierra, and the snow that fell farther and farther down the mountainsides {{resolved}} itself over the Vega into a fog as white and almost as cold. Half-way across the storied and fabled plain the rain stopped and the fog lifted, and then we saw by day, as we had already seen by night, how the Vega was plentifully dotted with white cottages amid breadths of wheat-land where the peasants were plowing. Here and there were fields of Indian corn, and in a certain place {{there was a small}} vineyard; in one of the middle distances there spread a forest of Lombardy poplars, yellow as gold, and there was abundance of this <b>autumn</b> <b>coloring</b> in the landscape, which grew lonelier as we began to mount from the level. Olives, of course, abounded, and there were oak woods and clumps of wild cherry trees. The towns were far from the stations, which we reached at the rate of perhaps two miles an hour as we approached the top of the hills; and we might have got out and walked without fear of being left behind by our train, which made long stops, as if to get its breath for another climb. Before this the sole companion of our journey, whom we decided to be a landed proprietor coming out in his riding-gear to inspect his possessions, had left us, but at the first station after our descent began other passengers got in, with a captain of Civil Guards among them, very loquacious and very courteous, and much deferred to by the rest of us. At Bobadilla, where again we had tea with hot goat's milk in it, we changed cars, and from that on we had the company of a Rock-Scorpion pair whose name was beautifully Italian and whose speech was beautifully English, as the speech of those born at Gibraltar should rightfully be.|$|E
40|$|Land surface {{phenology}} (LSP) {{and ground}} phenology (GP) are both important {{sources of information}} for monitoring terrestrial ecosystem responses to climate changes. Each measures different vegetation phenological stages and has different sources of uncertainties, which make comparison in absolute terms challenging, and therefore, there has been limited attempts to evaluate the complementary nature of both measures. However, both LSP and GP are climate driven and therefore should exhibit similar interannual variation. LSP obtained from the whole time series of Medium-Resolution Imaging Spectrometer data was compared to thousands of deciduous tree ground phenology records of the Pan European Phenology network (PEP 725). Correlations observed between the interannual time series of the satellite sensor estimates of phenology and PEP 725 records revealed a close agreement (especially for Betula Pendula and Fagus Sylvatica species). In particular, 90 % of the statistically significant correlations between LSP and GP were positive (mean R 2 = 0. 77). A large spatiotemporal correlation was observed between the dates of the start of season (end of season) from space and leaf unfolding (<b>autumn</b> <b>coloring)</b> at the ground (pseudo R 2 of 0. 70 (0. 71)) {{through the application of}} nonlinear multivariate models, providing, for the first time, the ability to predict accurately the date of leaf unfolding (<b>autumn</b> <b>coloring)</b> across Europe (root-mean-square error of 5. 97 days (6. 75 days) over 365 days) ...|$|E
40|$|Climate change {{affects the}} {{phenology}} of many species. As temperature and precipitation {{are thought to}} control <b>autumn</b> <b>color</b> change in temperate deciduous trees, {{it is possible that}} climate change might also affect the phenology of <b>autumn</b> <b>colors.</b> Using long-term data for eight tree species in a New England hardwood forest, we show that the timing and cumulative amount of <b>autumn</b> <b>color</b> are correlated with variation in temperature and precipitation at specific times of the year. A phenological model driven by accumulated cold degree-days and photoperiod reproduces most of the interspecific and interannual variability in the timing of <b>autumn</b> <b>colors.</b> We use this process-oriented model to predict changes in the phenology of <b>autumn</b> <b>colors</b> to 2099, showing that, while responses vary among species, climate change under standard IPCC projections will lead to an overall increase in the amount of <b>autumn</b> <b>colors</b> for most species...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: We {{evaluated}} {{the use of}} the Green-Red Vegetation Index (GRVI) as a phenological indicator based on multiyear stand-level observations of spectral reflectance and phenology at several representative ecosystems in Japan. The results showed the relationships between GRVI values and the seasonal change of vegetation and ground surface with high temporal resolution. We found that GRVI has the following advantages as a phenological indicator: (1) “GRVI = 0 ” can be a site-independent single threshold for detection of the early phase of leaf green-up and the middle phase of <b>autumn</b> <b>coloring,</b> and (2) GRVI can show a distinct response to subtle disturbance and the difference of ecosystem types...|$|E

40|$|According to the {{coevolution}} hypothesis the red {{autumn leaves}} of certain tree species are a warning signal towards insects that {{lay their eggs}} on the trees. A recent study has shown that red leaves are common in wild varieties of apple (Malus pumila) but not in cultivated varieties. This suggests that <b>autumn</b> <b>colors</b> have been lost during domestication due to relaxed selection against insects. The few varieties with red leaves have small fruits, similar to their wild ancestors, which shows {{that they have been}} under less effective artificial selection. As expected by the coevolution hypothesis these red varieties are very susceptible to an insect-borne disease, fire blight. Here I report further data on the loss of <b>autumn</b> <b>colors</b> under domestication. Since red leaf color is correlated with red fruit flesh color, if red fruit flesh has more astringent taste it is possible that loss of <b>autumn</b> <b>colors</b> is not only due to relaxed selection against insect, but also to direct artificial selection against astringent taste. However even varieties with yellow flesh turn out to have astringent taste. Moreover, while red fruit flesh is common in cultivated varieties with red leaves, it is very rare in wild varieties. It is unclear, therefore, whether loss of <b>autumn</b> <b>color</b> under domestication was a byproduct of artificial selection against red fruit flesh...|$|R
50|$|The {{coevolution}} {{theory of}} <b>autumn</b> <b>colors</b> was proposed by W. D. Hamilton in 2001 {{as an example}} of evolutionary signalling theory. With biological signals such as red leaves, it is argued that because they are costly to produce, they are usually honest, so signal the true quality of the signaller with low-quality individuals being unable to fake them and cheat. <b>Autumn</b> <b>colors</b> would be a signal if they are costly to produce, or be impossible to fake (for example if autumn pigments were produced by the same biochemical pathway that produces the chemical defenses against the insects).|$|R
