A committee of the <b>appellees</b> was appointed to draft the new agreement. The agreement was completed after meetings at which representatives of all of the <b>appellees</b> attended.

500|$|I {{am sorry}} to say that {{difficulties}} have been started likely to occasion much trouble and perhaps ultimate defeat. it seems the <b>Appellee</b> [...] has the option of waging Battle and of challenging the Appellor [...] in single combat which if not accepted by the Appellor the suit is lost and, if accepted, and the <b>Appellee</b> can hold out from sun rise to sun set, then he wins the contest and claims his discharge, otherwise his election subjects him not only to a good threshing but also the pain of death into the bargain. It is rumoured here that is the plea intended {{to be set up}} by the Def. and unless we can devise any means by arguement to induce the Court not to allow it, I am very apprehensive our poor little Knight {{will never be able to}} contend the Battle with his brutish opponent.|$|E

50|$|It {{remained}} only {{to consider}} whether the sum allowed <b>appellees</b> was too great. We think it was. The decree gave them an amount equal to ten percent upon the aggregate principle and interest of the bonds and coupons filed in the cause, excluding those in respect of which there was, between <b>appellees</b> and complainants and others, special contracts for compensation. It is shown that <b>appellees</b> had with the complainants contracts for small retainers and five percent upon the sums realized by the suit. We perceive no reason for this discrimination against creditors who were not parties except by filing their claims after decree. One-half the sum allowed was, under all the circumstances, sufficient.|$|R

50|$|Appellant minor argued {{trial court}} error in {{sustaining}} the demurrer of <b>appellees,</b> doctor and hospital, to her malpractice suit against them, because issues existed {{as to whether}} they had a duty to recognize a case of battered child syndrome that was to be reported to authorities, and whether their conduct proximately caused appellant's injuries. The court agreed, noting first that appellant was returned to parental custody after having been treated for injuries not appearing to be accidental, and that she then was traumatically abused. Because it was unclear whether treating physicians should have recognized the syndrome for treatment purposes, appellant was entitled to prove by expert testimony the standard of care against which <b>appellees</b> were to be held. And as <b>appellees</b> could not escape liability if it was foreseeable that appellant would suffer further injury, appellant was entitled to prove that appellees' conduct proximately caused her injuries, even if the parent's intervening act was the actual cause. Finally, appellant was entitled to show that <b>appellees</b> failed to exercise due care in not reporting her injuries to authorities who would have shielded her from further harm.|$|R

50|$|The {{funds were}} being {{distributed}} to redress the breach of a tribal land treaty and <b>appellee</b> alleged that its exclusion violated its equal protection {{rights under the}} Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. The district court rendered judgment in favor of <b>appellee</b> and enjoined further distributions. The appellate court affirmed and appellants sought review. The Court reversed, ruling that Congress' omission of <b>appellee</b> from the distribution did not offend due process and was tied rationally to the fulfillment of Congress' unique obligation toward the Indians. <b>Appellee</b> was not a recognized tribal entity; it was simply individual Indians with no vested rights in any tribal property. The statute distributed tribal, not individually owned, property. <b>Appellee</b> had previously been excluded from a distribution of tribal assets. Congress deliberately limited the distribution under the statute to avoid problems that might attend a wider distribution.|$|E
5000|$|A {{member of}} <b>appellee</b> Popular Democratic Party (hereafter [...] "appellee") {{who was elected}} in the November, 1980, general {{election}} to the Puerto Rico House of Representatives from District 31, died in 1981. The Governor of Puerto Rico subsequently called for a [...] "by-election" [...] — open to all qualified voters in District 31 — to fill the vacancy. <b>Appellee</b> then filed suit in the Superior Court of Puerto Rico, alleging that the Puerto Rico statutes under which the Governor purported to act authorized only candidates and electors affiliated with <b>appellee</b> {{to participate in the}} by-election. Appellants, qualified electors in District 31 who are not affiliated with <b>appellee,</b> intervened as defendants. The court entered judgment for <b>appellee.</b> The Puerto Rico Supreme Court modified the Superior Court's judgment, holding, inter alia, that the pertinent statute, as properly construed, requires a by-election only if the party of the legislator vacating the seat fails to designate a replacement within 60 days after the vacancy occurs, and that, if the party selects a single candidate within such period, that candidate is declared [...] "automatically elected to fill the vacancy." [...] The court rejected appellants' contention that this procedure violated the Federal Constitution. While the case was pending before the Puerto Rico Supreme Court, <b>appellee</b> held a primary election in which only its members were permitted to participate, and which resulted in the selection of a person who, pursuant to the Supreme Court's mandate, was sworn in as the new representative from District 31.|$|E
