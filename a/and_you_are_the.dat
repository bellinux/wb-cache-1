500|$|The Doctor and Amy {{take the}} TARDIS to the Cabinet War Rooms during The Blitz of the Second World War, {{one month after}} Winston Churchill {{requested}} the Doctor's help in the war effort. As the Doctor arrived late, Churchill turned to the scientific advances of Professor Edwin Bracewell, including robotic devices called [...] "Ironsides", which are recognised immediately by the Doctor as his archenemies the Daleks. The Doctor tries to understand their purpose in being on Earth at this time, but they continue to act as Bracewell's inventions, ready to serve Britain's war efforts. Angrily, the Doctor attacks the devices, shouting, [...] "I am the Doctor <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> Daleks!". Unbeknown to the Doctor and the humans, a Dalek ship is in orbit near the moon; upon hearing the Doctor's [...] "testimony", the Dalek aboard uses it to activate a [...] "Progenator Device" [...] and alerts its comrades on Earth. The Daleks reveal their intent and turn hostile, killing several guards and exposing Bracewell as an android before transmatting to their ship. The Doctor follows in the TARDIS, leaving Amy behind for her protection.|$|E
2500|$|When {{the war had}} {{finished}} and Sumich returned to Croatia he found a [...] "flourishing faith". [...] "They had broken free from communism and the church was free". [...] "Everyone had rosaries in their pockets." [...] Sumich found himself [...] "practising as a Catholic {{for the first time}} in my life, as distinct from just going to Sunday Mass. He wanted to know more about the Faith, because I'd just forgotten everything". His mother sent him a Catechism of the Catholic Church, which he [...] "sat down on a beach and read" [...] over one summer. [...] "It all made sense". He started going to frequent Confession and [...] "finding a sense of shame which probably hadn't existed before". At age 34, Sumich set aside a year, praying intensely, including the 15 prayers of St Bridget of Sweden and the Rosary. At this time, he was the coach of the Croatian rugby team. [...] "We would be playing at the Hong Kong Sevens and my rosary [...] would be in my pocket and I would finger it". [...] Sumich liked to challenge his players. [...] "I would say to them, 'strong moral life, strong character on the rugby field; weak moral life, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> first one to chuck the towel in when the going gets tough' [...] ". Returning to New Zealand, Sumich found local liturgies very different from what he had become used to in Croatia. But, in Auckland, he was introduced to the [...] "awe-inspiring" [...] Tridentine Mass celebrated by Denzil Meuli at Titirangi. Sumich [...] "felt God's call and sought an order using this rite". He was accepted by the Priestly Fraternity of Saint Peter and went to their formation house, [...] the International Seminary of St. Peter in Wigratzbad-Opfenbach, Bavaria, but he did most of his studies in Denton, Nebraska at Our Lady of Guadalupe Seminary [...] where he was ordained deacon in [...] March 2008.|$|E

2500|$|In [...] "The Beast Below" [...] (2010), a Dalek shadow {{can be seen}} during Prime Minister Winston Churchill's {{telephone}} conversation with the Eleventh Doctor. In [...] "Victory of the Daleks" [...] (2010), it is revealed that a Dalek ship survived its previous encounter with the Doctor, and fell back through time to 1941. The ship appears to be badly damaged, with only three surviving Daleks on board, [...] "at the end of [...] rope". The surviving Daleks discovered that a Progenitor, a small capsule containing pure Dalek DNA, had also fallen back though time. The Daleks retrieved it, planning {{to create a new}} race of Daleks, but were unable to activate the capsule, as it couldn't recognise these Daleks and, according to the Eleventh Doctor, saw them as [...] "impure". To solve this problem, they set a trap for the Doctor. This trap consists of building an android who believes himself to be human working undercover for the war cause. He claims to have invented the Daleks, calling them [...] "Ironsides". With Dalek blueprints and multiple Daleks painted in British Army Khaki, Winston Churchill uses them as war weapons, although they are mostly seen to be carrying around files and asking staff, [...] "Would you care for some tea?" [...] The Eleventh Doctor is surprised as these khaki Daleks appear to have forgotten their own purpose. This is all part of their plan, however: he proclaims, [...] "I am the Doctor, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> Daleks!" [...] which the Daleks back on the ship use as a testimony to activate the progenitor. The five New Paradigm Daleks that appear then exterminate their predecessors with no resistance, as they were deemed inferior. Each Dalek is a different colour and each represents a specific place in Dalek Hierarchy — Drone, Scientist, Strategist, Eternal and Supreme. The Daleks activate a time corridor, and escape into the future, delaying the Doctor by threatening to destroy Earth. Amy Pond doesn't recognise the Daleks when she first meets them, despite the Daleks' invasion of Earth and the planets appearing in Earth's sky, which the Doctor says is not possible. In [...] "Flesh and Stone" [...] (2010), the Eleventh Doctor theorises that the cracks in the universe caused the events to be unwritten.|$|E
