5|$|When a tooth is lost, dentures, bridges, or {{implants}} {{may be used}} as replacements. Dentures <b>are</b> <b>usually</b> <b>the</b> least costly whereas implants <b>are</b> <b>usually</b> <b>the</b> most expensive. Dentures may replace complete arches of {{the mouth}} or only a partial number of teeth. Bridges replace smaller spaces of missing teeth and use adjacent teeth to support the restoration. Dental implants may be used to replace a single tooth or a series of teeth. Though implants are the most expensive treatment option, they are often the most desirable restoration because of their aesthetics and function. To improve the function of dentures, implants {{may be used as}} support.|$|E
5|$|Cemeteries, {{including}} those of war dead, are targets for vandalism. The gravestones, cemeteries and buildings of the Commission are no exception. The Commission believes that graffiti and damage to stonework <b>are</b> <b>usually</b> <b>the</b> work of young people, noting the number of incidents increases when schoolchildren are on school holidays. Metal theft is also a problem: determined thieves target the bronze swords from the Cross of Sacrifice, which are now replaced with replicas made of fibreglass.|$|E
5|$|Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae <b>are</b> <b>usually</b> <b>the</b> {{main cause}} of PID. Data suggest that PID is often polymicrobial. Isolated anaerobes and facultative {{microorganisms}} have been obtained from the upper genital tract. N. gonorrhoeae has been isolated from fallopian tubes, facultative and anaerobic organisms were recovered from endometrial tissues.|$|E
50|$|Identification {{of genes}} <b>is</b> <b>usually</b> <b>the</b> {{first step in}} {{understanding}} a genome of a species; mapping of <b>the</b> gene <b>is</b> <b>usually</b> <b>the</b> first step of identification of the gene. Gene mapping <b>is</b> <b>usually</b> <b>the</b> starting point of many important downstream studies.|$|R

5|$|Fossils of organisms' bodies <b>are</b> <b>usually</b> <b>the</b> most {{informative}} type of evidence. The {{most common}} types are wood, bones, and shells. Fossilisation {{is a rare}} event, and most fossils are destroyed by erosion or metamorphism {{before they can be}} observed. Hence the fossil record is very incomplete, increasingly so further back in time. Despite this, it is often adequate to illustrate the broader patterns of life's history. There are also biases in the fossil record: different environments are more favorable to the preservation of different types of organism or parts of organisms. Further, only the parts of organisms that were already mineralised are usually preserved, such as the shells of molluscs. Since most animal species are soft-bodied, they decay before they can become fossilised. As a result, although there are 30-plus phyla of living animals, two-thirds have never been found as fossils.|$|E
5|$|Neutrophils and macrophages are phagocytes {{that travel}} {{throughout}} the body in pursuit of invading pathogens. Neutrophils are normally found in the bloodstream and are the most abundant type of phagocyte, normally representing 50% to 60% of the total circulating leukocytes. During the acute phase of inflammation, particularly {{as a result of}} bacterial infection, neutrophils migrate toward the site of inflammation in a process called chemotaxis, and <b>are</b> <b>usually</b> <b>the</b> first cells to arrive at the scene of infection. Macrophages are versatile cells that reside within tissues and: (i) produce a wide array of chemicals including enzymes, complement proteins, and cytokines, while they can also (ii) act as scavengers that rid the body of worn-out cells and other debris, and as antigen-presenting cells that activate the adaptive immune system.|$|E
5|$|Rice is {{the basic}} {{ingredient}} in ceremonial dishes, and {{is a very important}} element of Palestinian meals. Rice dishes <b>are</b> <b>usually</b> <b>the</b> main dish of Palestinian dinner, because they consist of a variety of ingredients commonly found within the Palestinian land. Rice is usually not served alone or as a side dish (see ruz ma lahma below), but rather it is incorporated within a larger dish or tabeekh (dish), that would include soups, vegetables, and meat (chicken or lamb). Meat is almost always present in Palestinian dishes.|$|E
50|$|The safeties are {{the last}} line of defense (farthest from the line of scrimmage) and <b>usually</b> help <b>the</b> corners with deep-pass coverage. The strong safety (SS) <b>is</b> <b>usually</b> <b>the</b> larger and {{stronger}} of the two, providing extra protection against run plays by standing closer to the line of scrimmage, <b>usually</b> on <b>the</b> strong (tight end) side of the field. The free safety (FS) <b>is</b> <b>usually</b> <b>the</b> smaller and faster of <b>the</b> two, and <b>is</b> <b>usually</b> <b>the</b> deepest player on the defense, providing help on long pass plays.|$|R
50|$|Platform 1 is only mainly {{used for}} {{westbound}} services to Cardiff Central during peak times. Platform 2 <b>is</b> <b>usually</b> <b>the</b> stopping point for all westbound services to Cardiff Central. Platform 3 <b>is</b> <b>usually</b> <b>the</b> stopping point for eastbound services to London Paddington and Nottingham. Platform 4 <b>is</b> <b>usually</b> <b>the</b> stopping point for eastbound services to Manchester Piccadilly, Holyhead, Portsmouth Harbour, Taunton and Cheltenham Spa and {{will also be}} used by trains to Ebbw Vale following the full re-opening of the Ebbw Valley Railway.|$|R

5|$|Symptoms of Huntington's disease most {{commonly}} become noticeable {{between the ages}} of 35 and 44years, but they can begin at any age from infancy to old age. In the early stages, there are subtle changes in personality, cognition, and physical skills. The physical symptoms <b>are</b> <b>usually</b> <b>the</b> first to be noticed, as cognitive and behavioral symptoms are generally not severe enough to be recognized on their own at the earlier stages. Almost everyone with Huntington's disease eventually exhibits similar physical symptoms, but the onset, progression and extent of cognitive and behavioral symptoms vary significantly between individuals.|$|E
5|$|Wiress {{is killed}} in a sneak attack by the Careers (tributes from the richer districts 1, 2 and 4, who train all their lives for the Games and <b>are</b> <b>usually</b> <b>the</b> winners), but the Careers suffer more losses, leaving them outnumbered. Katniss learns of Beetee's plan to harness {{lightning}} in order to electrocute Brutus and Enobaria, the two surviving Careers from District 2. Their enemies interfere with their plan, so Katniss instead uses her bow and arrow to direct the lightning into the force field, destroying the arena. She is knocked unconscious.|$|E
5|$|A part-savoury, part-sweet pasty (similar to the Bedfordshire clanger) was {{eaten by}} miners in the 19th century, in the copper mines on Parys Mountain, Anglesey. The {{technician}} {{who did the}} research and discovered the recipe claimed that the recipe was probably taken to Anglesey by Cornish miners travelling to the area looking for work. No two-course pasties are commercially produced in Cornwall today, but <b>are</b> <b>usually</b> <b>the</b> product of amateur cooks. They are, however, commercially available in the British supermarket chain Morrisons (under the name 'Tin Miner Pasty'). Other traditional fillings have included {{a wide variety of}} locally available meats including pork, bacon, egg, rabbit, chicken, mackerel and sweet fillings such as dates, apples, jam and sweetened rice - leading to the oft-quoted joke that 'the Devil hisself was afeared to cross over into Cornwall for fear that ee'd end up in a pasty'.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to {{referring to the}} class {{of all types of}} brackets, the unqualified word bracket is most commonly used to refer to a specific type of bracket: in modern American usage this <b>is</b> <b>usually</b> <b>the</b> square bracket and in modern British usage this <b>is</b> <b>usually</b> <b>the</b> round bracket.|$|R

5|$|Once a droplet has frozen, {{it grows}} in the {{supersaturated}} environment, which is one where air is saturated with respect to ice when the temperature is below the freezing point. The droplet then grows by deposition of water molecules in the air (vapor) onto the ice crystal surface where they are collected. Because water droplets {{are so much more}} numerous than the ice crystals due to their sheer abundance, the crystals are able to grow to hundreds of micrometers or millimeters in size {{at the expense of the}} water droplets. This process is known as the Wegener–Bergeron–Findeisen process. The corresponding depletion of water vapor causes the droplets to evaporate, meaning that the ice crystals grow at the droplets' expense. These large crystals are an efficient source of precipitation, since they fall through the atmosphere due to their mass, and may collide and stick together in clusters, or aggregates. These aggregates <b>are</b> <b>usually</b> <b>the</b> type of ice particle that falls to the ground. Guinness World Records lists the world's largest (aggregate) snowflakes as those of January 1887 at Fort Keogh, Montana; allegedly one measured 15inches (38cm) wide. Although this report by a farmer is doubtful, aggregates of three or four inches width have been observed. Single crystals the size of a dime (17.91mm in diameter) have been observed. Snowflakes encapsulated in rime form balls known as graupel.|$|E

Although the ice is clear, scattering of light by the crystal facets and hollows/imperfections mean that the crystals often appear white in color due to diffuse reflection of the whole spectrum of light by the small ice particles.|$|E
5|$|The emperor penguin's diet {{consists}} {{mainly of}} fish, crustaceans and cephalopods, although its composition varies from population to population. Fish <b>are</b> <b>usually</b> <b>the</b> most important food source, and the Antarctic silverfish (Pleuragramma antarcticum) {{makes up the}} bulk of the bird's diet. Other prey commonly recorded include other fish of the family Nototheniidae, the glacial squid (Psychroteuthis glacialis), and the hooked squid species Kondakovia longimana, as well as Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba). The emperor penguin searches for prey in the open water of the Southern Ocean, in either ice-free areas of open water or tidal cracks in pack ice. One of its feeding strategies is to dive to around , where it can easily spot sympagic fish like the bald notothen (Pagothenia borchgrevinki) swimming against the bottom surface of the sea-ice; it swims up {{to the bottom of the}} ice and catches the fish. It then dives again and repeats the sequence about half a dozen times before surfacing to breathe.|$|E

25|$|Medical {{treatments}} often {{focus on}} alleviating symptoms. However measures which focus on decreasing underlying atherosclerosis—as opposed to simply treating symptoms—are more effective. Non-pharmaceutical means <b>are</b> <b>usually</b> <b>the</b> first method of treatment, such as stopping smoking and practicing regular exercise. If these methods do not work, medicines <b>are</b> <b>usually</b> <b>the</b> {{next step in}} treating cardiovascular diseases, and, with improvements, have increasingly become the most effective method over the long term.|$|E
