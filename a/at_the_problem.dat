The federal parliament had notably amended the Constitution in order to create legal possibilities to condemn the party.

5|$|Even Born was {{surprised}} to discover that Paul Dirac had been thinking along the same lines as Heisenberg. Soon Wolfgang Pauli used the matrix method to calculate the energy values of the hydrogen atom, and found that they agreed with the Bohr model. Another important contribution was made by Erwin Schrödinger, who looked <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> using wave mechanics. This {{had a great deal of}} appeal to many at the time, as it offered the possibility of returning to deterministic classical physics. Born would have none of this, as it ran counter to facts determined by experiment. He formulated the now-standard interpretation of the probability density function for ψ*ψ in the Schrödinger equation, which he published in July 1926.|$|E
5|$|In 1943, Urey {{brought in}} Hugh S. Taylor from Princeton University to look <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> of a usable barrier. Libby made {{progress}} on understanding {{the chemistry of}} uranium hexafluoride, leading to {{ideas on how to}} prevent corrosion and plugging. Chemical researchers at the SAM Laboratories studied fluorocarbons, which resisted corrosion, and could be used as lubricants and coolants in the gaseous diffusion plant. Despite this progress, the K-25 Project was in serious trouble without a suitable barrier, and by August 1943 it was facing cancellation. On 13 August Groves informed the Military Policy Committee, the senior committee that steered the Manhattan Project, that gaseous diffusion enrichment in excess of 50 percent was probably infeasible, and that the gaseous diffusion plant would be limited to producing product with a lower enrichment that could be fed into the calutrons of the Y-12 electromagnetic plant. Urey therefore began preparations to mass-produce the Norris-Adler barrier, despite its problems.|$|E

25|$|The {{development}} of more sophisticated SAMs such as the MIM-104 Patriot and the US Navy's Aegis combat system {{put pressure on the}} Soviets to develop better ARMs in turn. Zvezda came <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> from a different angle to Raduga, having a background in lightweight air-to-air missiles. However, in the mid-1970s they had developed the successful Kh-25 family of short-range air-to-surface missiles, including the Kh-25MP (AS-12 'Kegler') for anti-radar use. Zvezda started work on a long-range ARM and the first launch of the Kh-31 was in 1982. It entered service in 1988 and was first displayed in public in 1991, the Kh-31P at Dubai and the Kh-31A at Minsk.|$|E

25|$|In 1994, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) {{adopted a}} Code of Conduct on Politico-Military Aspects of Security that {{underlined}} the democratic {{control of the}} security sector as essential to stability. While the Code served as a starting point, a framework of security sector reform (SSR) activities further emerged in 1999 after development actors observed from examples in South Africa, Indonesia and countries in Eastern Europe that national security and its components were considered crucial in a state recovering from conflict or an authoritarian regime. Similarly, {{the increasing number of}} civil wars led development actors to begin to look <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> of insecurity from the perspective of good governance and human security. The conclusion was that the security sector should adhere to the same rules of good governance as any other public service to curb conflict and violence.|$|E
25|$|However, {{the theory}} that The Contention may be an early draft does not {{necessarily}} imply {{that it could not}} also represent a bad quarto. Traditionally, most critics (such as Alexander, Doran, McKerrow and Urkowitz) have looked <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> as an either-or situation; The Contention is either a reported text or an early draft, but recently there has been some argument that it may be both. For example, this is the theory supported by Roger Warren in his Oxford Shakespeare edition of the play. It is also the theory advanced by Randall Martin in his Oxford Shakespeare edition of 3 Henry VI. The crux of the argument is that both the evidence for the bad quarto theory and the evidence for the early draft theory are so compelling that neither is able to completely refute the other. As such, if the play contains evidence of being both a reported text and an early draft, it must be both; i.e. The Contention represents a reported text of an early draft of 2 Henry VI. Shakespeare wrote an early version of the play, which was staged. Shortly after that staging, some of the actors constructed a bad quarto from it and had it published. In the meantime, Shakespeare had rewritten the play into the form found in the First Folio. Warren argues that this is the only theory which can account for the strong evidence for both reporting and revision, and it is a theory which is gaining increased support in the late twentieth/early twenty-first century.|$|E
500|$|This {{reveals that}} there is a {{struggle}} between the acceptance of imaginative experience that exists only within {{a small part of the}} mind. This struggle, according to Walter Evert, has [...] "no relevance to the world of external action and perhaps no truth to offer even the visionary dreamer himself." [...] However Anthony Hecht looks <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> in a different way and believes that there must be a connection between the external and internal worlds for the narrator to even face the problem. Regardless, the narrator never states that this worship of Psyche or embracing the imagination would aid mankind, but the poem does rejoice in exercising the imagination.|$|E

500|$|Over {{the next}} few months, Parsons' {{division}} designed the gun-type plutonium weapon, codenamed Thin Man. It was assumed that a uranium-235 weapon would be similar in nature. Hirschfelder's group considered various designs, and evaluated different propellants. The ordnance test area, which became known as [...] "Anchor Ranch", was established on a nearby ranch, where Parsons conducted test firings with a 3-inch anti-aircraft gun. Work on implosion lagged by comparison, {{but this was not}} initially a major concern, because it was expected that the gun-type would work with both uranium and plutonium. However, Oppenheimer, Groves and Parsons lobbied Purnell and Tolman to get John von Neumann to have a look <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem.</b> Von Neumann suggested the use of shaped charges to initiate implosion.|$|E

An extra dollar earned always means more money available for expenditure.|$|E

Because the industrialized countries have contributed {{more than two-thirds of the}} stock of human-induced GHGs in the atmosphere, this approach suggests that they should bear the largest share of the costs.

This is because efficiency requires incentives to be forward-looking, and not retrospective (Goldemberg et al., 1996, p.29). The question of historical responsibility is a matter of ethics. Munasinghe et al. (1996, p.167) suggested that developed countries could address the issue by making side-payments to developing countries.|$|E

2500|$|Concerns by the Commander-in-Chief of the Forces, Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington, over France and the {{expansion}} of their harbour at Cherbourg resulted in a commission in 1842 to look <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem.</b> A recommendation to build harbours at St Catherine's in Jersey and in Alderney was approved in 1845, to be called [...] "Harbours of Refuge" [...] to avoid upsetting the French. A massive breakwater to enclose between 67 acres and 150 acres in Braye bay, dependant upon the date of the plan between 1845 and 1859. The idea of building just a harbour would provide the enemy with a good facility that once taken could not be recovered. It required fortifications to defend the harbour. Following the construction of the railway line from the quarry to the harbour and the importation of two engines, the northern breakwater was begun. Given the misleading title of a harbour of refuge so as not to provoke the French, it was constructed by Jackson and Bean between 1847 and September 1864 when it had reached 1,500m (4,900ft) when works were abandoned.|$|E

I would like to suggest, that patronage, together with other practices that the age itself reveals to us, may be the avenue most likely to lead us into a fruitful social history of the Scientific Revolution, a movement to which the present generation of scholars has devoted itself extensively. In our investigations, it appears to me, we have allowed ourselves to be dominated excessively by concepts derived in the nineteenth century which are more applicable to that century and our own than to ... Efforts to impose them on the 17th century have appeared forced and largely barren, and I want to propose, not as a new dogmatism, but as a topic for discussion, the possibility that we need to come <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> from a different angle, using seventeenth-century categories instead of nineteenth-century ones.

2500|$|If {{the above}} theory is true, {{the next stage}} of {{development}} ought to be triple algebra and if [...] truly represents a line in a given plane, it ought to be possible to find a third term which added to the above would represent a line in space. Argand and some others guessed that it was [...] although this contradicts the truth established by Euler that [...] De Morgan and many others worked hard <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem,</b> but nothing came of it until the problem was taken up by Hamilton. We now see the reason clearly: The symbol of double algebra denotes not a length and a direction; but a multiplier and an angle. In it the angles are confined to one plane. Hence the next stage will be a quadruple algebra, when the axis of the plane is made variable. And this gives the answer to the first question; double algebra is nothing but analytical plane trigonometry, and this is why it {{has been found to be}} the natural analysis for alternating currents. But De Morgan never got this far. He died with the belief that “double algebra must remain as the full development of the conceptions of arithmetic, so far as those symbols are concerned which arithmetic immediately suggests”.|$|E
