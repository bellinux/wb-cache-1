40|$|International audienceWith the {{increase}} of the transmission bit rate on optical fibers, {{it is now possible}} to transmit a radio base band signal over long distances. A very promising technology called Digital Radio Over Fiber (DRoF) uses this principle and allows centralization of resource management in the base station architecture. This architecture consists of three components: <b>a</b> <b>Base</b> <b>Band</b> <b>Unit</b> (BBU), a Remote Radio Head (RRH) and the interface between them such as CPRI (Common Public Radio Interface). In this paper, we propose to use the DRoF technology to virtualize current residential gateways making them less complex and allowing centralization of resource management. We show that the propagation delay can be a serious issue with Wi-Fi as we increase the distance between terminals and the access point...|$|E
30|$|The C-RAN {{has four}} “C” characteristics, i.e., clean, {{centralized}} processing, collaborative radio, and real-time cloud radio access network. C-RAN {{is viewed as}} an architecture evolution based on distributed base stations (BSs). The C-RAN architecture breaks down the traditional BS into <b>a</b> <b>base</b> <b>band</b> <b>unit</b> (BBU) and Remote Radio Units (RRUs). The BBU is a digital unit that implements the MAC, PHY, and antenna array system functionality. The BBU is often located in a remote site such as a central office (CO) and thus the energy, real estate, and security costs are minimized. The RRU can be mounted either outdoor or indoor such as on poles, sides of buildings, or anywhere power and a broadband connection exist, making installation less costly and easier. The RRU is typically connected to the BBU using fibers. C-RAN adopts CoMP technology to reduce interference, lower power consumption, and improve spectral efficiency in [4] and [5].|$|E
40|$|Part 6 : Circuit DesignInternational audienceSmart {{phones are}} growing rapidly {{with the support}} of Over the Top (OTT) service and {{multimedia}} streaming service as well as existing Internet service. In the conventional Distributed-RAN (D-RAN) structure, <b>a</b> <b>Base</b> <b>Band</b> <b>Unit</b> (BBU) and a Remote Radio Head (RRH) are configured at one cell site. However, C-RAN, which is a new RAN structure, is composed of separated base stations in which BBU and RRH are separated. RRH is left in cell sites where radio signals are transmitted and received, and BBUs are collected and managed in different places. When the bandwidth of the LTE signal is 20  MHz and the 2  ×  2 Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) antenna is used, the CPRI requires 2. 5 Gbps transmission. Since {{there is a limit to}} handle mobile traffic that is continuously increasing with the current transmission rate, several techniques for compressing IQ data before transmission have been proposed. In this paper, we apply the compression technique to remove unnecessary parts in the Most Significant Byte (MSB) of a basic frame after applying the existing Up/Down sampling and Non-linear Quantization. We measured the error vector magnitude (EVM) to measure the compression rate and the quality of the signal after compression to confirm the compression performance. Also, it was confirmed whether the experimental results satisfied the compression requirement of Open Radio Interface (ORI) ...|$|E

30|$|As of this writing, {{only a few}} {{simulation}} studies, including {{reports from}} the 3 GPP TSG RAN WG 1 meetings, have been published, claiming the practical implementation of the model [15, 16]. In [17], we have introduced the implementation and validation of the 3 GPP 3 D channel model in open source simulation tools, considering only the desired signal channels, while the interfering channels are modeled by Rayleigh fading. In this contribution, we extend our approach considering also the interfering links to fade according to the 3 GPP 3 D channel model. We provide a complete guideline for the practical implementation of the model. The MATLAB source code is openly available for download on our webpage under an academic, non commercial use license [18]. It is provided as a stand-alone package that is directly applicable for system level simulation tools and can straightforwardly be ported to link level. We strongly believe that open access is a key prerequisite for reproducible simulation studies. Moreover, we have made an iteration of the model openly available, with over 100 beta testers and an active online forum. We {{see it as the}} only way to ensure the quality of implementation. In this paper, we focus on downlink. According to [14], the channel can be applied for both up- and downlink. For this reason, the notions transmitter and receiver interchangeably refer to the antenna elements of the eNodeB sectors and the UEs, respectively. In practice, eNodeB sectors and UEs will be equipped with antenna arrays, each consisting of one or more antenna elements (conf. Fig. 2). Note that an eNodeB comprises <b>a</b> <b>base</b> <b>band</b> processing <b>unit</b> and can serve multiple sectors or cells.|$|R
40|$|With the {{proliferation}} of new mobile devices and applications, the demand for ubiquitous wireless services has increased dramatically in recent years. The explosive growth in the wireless traffic requires the wireless networks to be scalable {{so that they can}} be efficiently extended to meet the wireless communication demands. In a wireless network, the interference power typically grows with the number of devices without necessary coordination among them. On the other hand, large scale coordination is always difficult due to the low-bandwidth and high-latency interfaces between access points (APs) in traditional wireless networks. To address this challenge, cloud radio access network (C-RAN) has been proposed, where <b>a</b> pool of <b>base</b> <b>band</b> <b>units</b> (BBUs) are connected to the distributed remote radio heads (RRHs) via high bandwidth and low latency links (i. e., the front-haul) and are responsible for all the baseband processing. But the insufficient front-haul link capacity may limit the scale of C-RAN and prevent it from fully utilizing the benefits made possible by the centralized baseband processing. As a result, the front-haul link capacity becomes a bottleneck in the scalability of C-RAN. In this dissertation, we explore the scalable C-RAN in the effort of tackling this challenge. In the first aspect of this dissertation, we investigate the scalability issues in the existing wireless networks and propose a novel time-reversal (TR) based scalable wireless network in which the interference power is naturally mitigated by the focusing effects of TR communications without coordination among APs or terminal devices (TDs). Due to this nice feature, it is shown that the system can be easily extended to serve more TDs. Motivated by the nice properties of TR communications in providing scalable wireless networking solutions, in the second aspect of this dissertation, we apply the TR based communications to the C-RAN and discover the TR tunneling effects which alleviate the traffic load in the front-haul links caused by the increment of TDs. We further design waveforming schemes to optimize the downlink and uplink transmissions in the TR based C-RAN, which are shown to improve the downlink and uplink transmission accuracies. Consequently, the traffic load in the front-haul links is further alleviated by the reducing re-transmissions caused by transmission errors. Moreover, inspired by the TR-based C-RAN, we propose the compressive quantization scheme which applies to the uplink of multi-antenna C-RAN so that more antennas can be utilized with the limited front-haul capacity, which provide rich spatial diversity such that the massive TDs can be served more efficiently...|$|R

In Virtualized Radio Access Networks (VRANs), some functions from <b>a</b> <b>Base</b> Station (BS), such as those which make up the <b>Base</b> <b>Band</b> <b>Unit</b> (BBU), may be implemented in a shared infrastructure located at either a data center or distributed in network nodes.

These two problems constitute what we refer to as the VRAN Placement and Assignment Problem (VRAN-PAP). In this paper, we start by formally defining the VRAN-PAP before formulating it as a Binary Integer Linear Program (BILP) whose objective is to minimize the server and front haul link setup costs as well as the latency (or distance) between each RRH and its assigned BBU.
