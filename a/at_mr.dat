5|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} in a span of two years <b>at</b> <b>Mr.</b> Dan's Studio in Buckeye, Arizona and the old town hall of Govan, Scotland. It {{has been described as}} a concept album loosely based around a night of partying and the morning effects after. The album has more of a dance-oriented sound, featuring styles of dance-punk, new wave, and electropop, marking a departure from the band's post-punk sound, which was featured on their past two albums.|$|E
5|$|Later that evening, Jiminy and {{his parents}} {{convince}} a couple {{to give up some}} goods in exchange for a tonic that will supposedly make them immune to a plague. He soon discovers that his father switched Rumpelstiltskin's tonic with the one they sold, and finds that the couple have been turned into dolls. Even worse, he then discovers that the couple were the parents of the young boy he spoke to earlier. Having realized what he has done, Jiminy makes a wish and receives an answer from The Blue Fairy, who shows up to give him his one true wish: becoming a cricket. Jiminy is also told that {{he has a chance to}} help someone in the future, starting with the young boy, who would grow up to be Gepetto. As for the cursed dolls, they end up as a collection <b>at</b> <b>Mr.</b> Gold's (Carlyle) pawn shop.|$|E
5|$|Mr. Burns falls {{ill with}} hypohemia (a fictional {{condition}} in which the body naturally runs out of blood, though it is akin to a real condition called hypovolemia) and needs a blood transfusion. His blood type, double O negative, is very rare, however, {{and none of the}} employees at Springfield Nuclear Power Plant have it. Homer discovers that Bart has double O negative blood and urges his son to donate, promising that he will be handsomely rewarded. Bart reluctantly agrees and his blood donation saves Mr. Burns' life. Mr. Burns is rejuvenated by the blood and he sends the Simpson family a thank you card. Enraged <b>at</b> <b>Mr.</b> Burns' paltry gesture, Homer writes an insulting reply, but Marge convinces him at the last minute not to send it. The next morning, Homer discovers that the letter is gone as Bart has mailed it.|$|E
60|$|The {{bell was}} {{answered}} by Louisa--Louisa looked hard <b>at</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Lecount. The luncheon {{was brought up}} by the house-maid--the house-maid looked hard <b>at</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Lecount. When luncheon was over, the table was cleared by the cook--the cook looked hard <b>at</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Lecount.

5|$|The Simpson {{family are}} {{employed}} as caretakers <b>at</b> <b>Mr.</b> Burns' mansion. Mr. Burns cuts the cable television wire and steals the beer, thinking this will ensure hard {{work from the}} family. While there, Groundskeeper Willie discovers that Bart {{has the power to}} read his thoughts and says that if Homer goes insane, he should use this to call him. The deprivation of his two favorite things causes Homer to go insane and a ghostly Moe informs Homer he must kill his family {{in order to get a}} beer. Marge confronts Homer and locks him in the pantry until he has calmed down.|$|E
5|$|The {{economy of}} Springfield is in decline, so Mayor Quimby listens to {{suggestions}} from citizens {{on how to}} improve it. Principal Skinner states that legalized gambling has helped rejuvenate run-down economies, and that it can work for Springfield as well. Everybody, even Marge, likes the idea. Mr. Burns and Mayor Quimby work together to build a casino, where Homer gets a job as a blackjack dealer. The casino is designed by Mr. Burns himself, as the proposals he received were not to his liking. While Marge waits for Homer's shift to end at the casino, she finds a quarter on the floor and uses it to play a slot machine. She wins and almost immediately becomes addicted to gambling. Meanwhile, since Bart is too young to gamble <b>at</b> <b>Mr.</b> Burns' Casino, he starts his own casino for his friends to play in his treehouse, and intercepts Robert Goulet to perform there. Mr. Burns also grows even richer, but in the process becomes a Howard Hughes-type hermit, developing a profound fear of microscopic germs, urinates in jars, and wears tissue boxes instead of shoes.|$|E
