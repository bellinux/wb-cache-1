5|$|The {{centrifuge}} process {{was regarded as}} the only promising separation method in April 1942. Jesse Beams had developed such a process <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>University</b> <b>of</b> <b>Virginia</b> during the 1930s, but had encountered technical difficulties. The process required high rotational speeds, but at certain speeds harmonic vibrations developed that threatened to tear the machinery apart. It was therefore necessary to accelerate quickly through these speeds. In 1941 he began working with uranium hexafluoride, the only known gaseous compound of uranium, {{and was able to}} separate uranium-235. At Columbia, Urey had Karl Cohen investigate the process, and he produced a body of mathematical theory making it possible to design a centrifugal separation unit, which Westinghouse undertook to construct.|$|E
5|$|The {{success of}} the National Intercollegiate Band led to districts {{creating}} their own bands.

The convention was hosted by the Beta Chi chapter <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>University</b> <b>of</b> <b>Virginia,</b> and the convention and concert were co-sponsored by the Universities of Rutgers, Maryland, and Pittsburgh.

5|$|A {{native of}} Ohio, Gottesman studied {{psychology}} for his {{undergraduate and graduate}} degrees, became {{a faculty member at}} various universities, and spent most of his career <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>University</b> <b>of</b> <b>Virginia</b> and the University of Minnesota. He is known for researching schizophrenia in identical twins to document the contributions of genetics and the family, social, cultural, and economic environment to the onset, progress, and inter-generational transmission of the disorder. Gottesman has worked with researchers to analyze hospital records and conduct follow-up interviews of twins where one or both were schizophrenic. He has also researched the effects of genetics and the environment on human violence and variations in human intelligence. Gottesman and co-researcher James Shields introduced the word epigenetics—the control of genes by biochemical signals modified by the environment {{from other parts of the}} genome—to the field of psychiatric genetics.|$|E
5|$|Gottesman {{began his}} career at Harvard University as a social {{relations}} and psychology lecturer. This non-tenure-track position ended after three years. Then he worked with researcher James Shields at the Maudsley–Bethlem hospital complex in London, using its twin registry to analyze traits of identical and fraternal twins at the lab of Eliot Slater, whom Gottesman met in Rome at the Second International Congress on Human Genetics in 1961. After {{his return to the}} University of Minnesota in 1966, Gottesman created a program on behavioral genetics, the first in the U.S. In 1972–1973 he received a Guggenheim fellowship to work with K.O. Christiansen in Denmark. In 1980 he left to join the Washington University School of Medicine, then moved to the University of Virginia in 1985, where he started the clinical psychology training program. Gottesman continued vising London and collaborating with Shields, with whom he co-wrote a series of books.After spending 16 years <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>University</b> <b>of</b> <b>Virginia,</b> Gottesman retired from an active role after 41 years of research, but continues research part-time in psychology and psychiatry.|$|E
