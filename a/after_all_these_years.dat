It's amazing that <b>after</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>years</b> people still don't understand it. Mission accomplished.|$|E
25|$|On February 19, 1977, Wonder was {{nominated}} for seven Grammy Awards, including Album of the Year, an award that he had already won twice, in 1974 and 1975, for Innervisions and Fulfillingness’ First Finale. Since 1973, Stevie’s presence at the Grammy ceremonies had been consistent – he attended most of the ceremonies and also used to perform on stage. But in 1976, he did not attend as he was not nominated for any awards (as he had not released any new material during the past year). Paul Simon, who received the Grammy for Album of the Year in that occasion (for Still Crazy <b>After</b> <b>All</b> <b>These</b> <b>Years)</b> jokingly thanked Stevie “for not releasing an album” that year. A year after, Wonder {{was nominated}} for Songs in the Key of Life in that same category, and was widely favored by many critics to take the award. The other nominees were Breezin’ by George Benson, Chicago X by Chicago, Silk Degrees by Boz Scaggs, and the other favorite, Peter Frampton’s Frampton Comes Alive!, which was also a huge critical and commercial success. Wonder was again absent from the ceremony, as he had developed an interest in visiting Africa. In February he traveled to Nigeria for two weeks, primarily to explore his musical heritage, as he put it. A satellite hook-up was arranged so that Stevie could be awarded his Grammys from across the sea. Bette Midler announced the results during the ceremony, and the audience was only able to see Wonder at a phone smiling and giving thanks. The video signal was poor and the audio inaudible. Andy Williams went on to make a public blunder when he asked the blind-since-birth Wonder, “Stevie, can you see us?” In all, Wonder won four out of seven nominations at the Grammys: Album of the Year, Best Male Pop Vocal Performance, Best Male R Vocal Performance and Producer of the Year.|$|E

We won't bring additional spectacle to the show. Unnecessary scandals, with Madonna it's guaranteed.|$|E
500|$|In {{the final}} Test, Bradman scored another century and England lost the match and series, {{although}} Wyatt played a substantial innings, and Wisden conceded Chapman {{could have made}} little difference except as a fielder. The two men remained friends {{during and after the}} controversy. In comparing circumstances of Chapman's appointment with those of his replacement by Wyatt, Gibson writes: [...] "In 1926, England won: in 1930, England lost. That is why the echoes took so long to die down and why the selectors remained villains." [...] He concludes that, even though Wyatt did relatively well, [...] "It does seem, <b>after</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>years,</b> an odd decision to have taken." [...] In the series, Chapman scored 259 runs at 43.16. In all first-class cricket, he passed four figures for the final time, reaching 1,027 runs at an average of 29.34.|$|E

Garfunkel sang the Simon & Garfunkel classic [...] "Bridge Over Troubled Water" [...] and [...] "April Come She Will", and [...] "A Heart in New York", a song written by Gallagher and Lyle that appeared on his album Scissors Cut, which had been released the previous month.

500|$|The design {{attracted}} {{comments from}} {{those interested in}} coins. Frank Duffield, editor of the ANA's journal The Numismatist, noted in the October 1936 issue that the coin had been awaited with anticipation by hobbyists because of an announcement that it would bear the likeness of Foster, but [...] "when it finally appeared many expressions of approval of the designs were heard and a few criticisms... Foster deserved a better bust than the one the artist has given us...the toy four-string lyre [...] holds in her hand is not {{in keeping with the}} times or the occasion... <b>After</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>years,</b> Music deserved something better." [...] Coin dealer B. Max Mehl, in his monograph on commemorative coins published in 1937, agreed with the criticism of the reverse, [...] "apparently this lyre must have been bought at a 5¢ and 10¢ store as it seems to be only a toy".|$|E
500|$|Public {{reaction}} varied. Some women {{admired her}} strength and poise in private matters {{that were made}} public, some sympathized with her {{as a victim of}} her husband's insensitive behavior, others criticized her as being an enabler to her husband's indiscretions, while still others accused her of cynically staying in a failed marriage as a way of keeping or even fostering her own political influence. Her public approval ratings {{in the wake of the}} revelations shot upward to around 70percent, the highest they had ever been. In her 2003 memoir, she would attribute her decision to stay married to [...] "a love that has persisted for decades" [...] and add: [...] "No one understands me better and no one can make me laugh the way Bill does.

500|$|They planned their setlist at the Connaught Hotel in London, {{followed}} by {{three days of}} rehearsals at Black Island Studios. The sessions were problematic, with minor disagreements over the style and pace of the songs they were practising; the running order decided {{on the eve of}} the event. At the beginning of their performance of [...] "Wish You Were Here", Waters told the audience: [...] " [...] quite emotional, standing up here with these three guys <b>after</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>years,</b> standing to be counted with the rest of you... we're doing this for everyone who's not here, and particularly of course for Syd." [...] At the end, Gilmour thanked the audience and started to walk off the stage. Waters then called him back, and the band shared a group hug. Images of that hug were a favourite among Sunday newspapers after Live 8. Waters commented on their almost twenty years of animosity: [...] "I don't think any of us came out of the years from 1985 with any credit... It was a bad, negative time, and I regret my part in that negativity." ...|$|E

5000|$|Another German {{review of}} the album was by The-Pit, where author Alexander Müller wrote [...] "A sneak peek {{regarding}} unremitting enthusiasm is what the excellent pre-single [...] "Perfect Stranger" [...] represents. The song is a gorgeous summary and light-footed driving rock number. With beautiful classical guitar hooks and inserts, the voice of Robert Zander sounds <b>after</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> many <b>years</b> in rock business still as fresh and lubricated convinced at a high level, without ever being melodramatic." ...|$|R
500|$|In {{his first}} sermon as {{associate}} rabbi, Danziger said [...] "we {{can afford to}} look Jewish <b>after</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>years</b> and... out of self-respect alone, we cannot afford not to". As senior rabbi he slowly brought more traditional observances back to Temple Israel, moving {{it away from the}} radicalism of [...] "Classical Reform" [...] Judaism. These observances included the chanting of Torah blessings, a Torah procession through the sanctuary aisles, fasting on Yom Kippur, circumcising baby boys, and saying the kaddish for the deceased. In 1979, he gradually replaced the old Union Prayer Book with the new Gates of Prayer prayer book, and later began wearing a tallit while on the bimah. The changes were not uncontroversial, and the latter prompted one member to resign in protest. Though more traditional than his more recent predecessors, he was willing to perform intermarriages, but also counseled the couples as to the meaning of making a Jewish home. Danziger was involved in the Central Conference of American Rabbis and eventually became its president.|$|E
500|$|In the 1970s, the duo reunited several times. Their first reunion was {{a benefit}} concert for presidential {{candidate}} George McGovern at New York's Madison Square Garden in June 1972. In 1975, they reconciled once more when they visited a recording session with John Lennon and Harry Nilsson. For {{the rest of}} the year, they attempted to make the reunion work, but their collaboration only yielded one song, [...] "My Little Town", that was featured on Simon's Still Crazy <b>After</b> <b>All</b> <b>These</b> <b>Years</b> and Garfunkel's Breakaway. It peaked at number nine on the Hot 100. In 1975, Garfunkel joined Simon for a medley of three songs on the television series Saturday Night Live which Simon was guest hosting. In 1977, Garfunkel joined Simon for a brief performance of their old songs on Simon's television special The Paul Simon Special, and later that year they recorded a cover of Sam Cooke's [...] "(What a) Wonderful World" [...] along with James Taylor. Old tensions finally appeared to dissipate upon Garfunkel's return to New York in 1978, when the duo began interacting more often. On May 1, 1978, Simon joined Garfunkel for a concert held at Carnegie Hall to benefit the hearing disabled.|$|E
500|$|Wired writer Nate Ralph {{found that}} [...] "Bloody Fun Day might not feature a deep or even logical narrative, but it's got style in spades, bolstered by simple, fun game mechanics." [...] He {{added that the}} {{increased}} amount of turns needed to hatch eggs [...] "can lead to some delightfully irritating close shaves." [...] IndieGames.com writer Michael Rose agreed, stating [...] "The game mechanics work really well and it's a very nice concept." [...] Anthony Carboni, a former co-host of Attack of the Show! and current presenter of online video game review show Bytejacker, was also positive. In his review he said [...] "It's {{a lot of fun}} and easy to pick up, but as levels progress things do get pretty intense." [...] Zenko stated the game embodied three virtues; [...] "simple, hot and deep". These virtues were required in games published by Electronic Arts, which had been outlined to Zenko in a letter from Electronic Arts' founder Trip Hawkins after Zenko had written to Hawkins as a teenager. During play Zenko's reaper almost died {{due to a lack of}} red souls, but he managed to reverse the situation and fill the life bar; [...] "even <b>after</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>years</b> of gaming, that rush still does its neurochemical work".|$|E

5000|$|The album's lyrical content {{frequently}} focuses upon {{life as a}} touring {{musician and}} the nature of songwriting, with Kozelek stating, [...] "When you're a touring musician, you're always turning over new rocks and there's always a certain level of tension in your life. The music business, and the travel that comes with it, is stressful, challenging, redundant, exhausting, exciting, and often very depressing. <b>After</b> <b>all</b> of <b>these</b> <b>years,</b> I'm still trying to cope with aspects of it." ...|$|R
60|$|He wrote {{word that}} he was now quite well and strong again, and that he hoped to be in England in {{a year at the}} farthest; but he promised to give me at any rate a couple of months notice, and said that he should expect to have {{everything}} ready to be married a week after he landed; for that <b>after</b> waiting <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>years</b> he did not see any reason why he should be kept without me a single day, after he returned, longer than necessary.|$|R
500|$|The anime {{series has}} been {{compared}} with a similar series that involved gender swapping—Rumiko Takahashi's Ranma ½. In a review at T.H.E.M. Anime Reviews, the reviewer wrote, [...] " [...] rather aggravating to watch at times, but {{seems to have no}} problem raising smiles whenever it wants to, either. The characters, as they are, bring much of the believability of the show, despite the alien elements. It's very much down to earth and pleasant to look at, if nothing else. The rather soft and detailed art style does help, of course, as does the generally great animation quality." [...] The conclusion of the anime was positively reviewed by Erica Friedman, who is the president of Yuricon, an anime convention geared towards fans of yuri anime and manga, and ALC Publishing, a publishing house dedicated to yuri. Friedman described the anime's conclusion as [...] "so normal - so much like a thing that might have actually happened in real life...that it kind of just went under the radar. So - <b>after</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>years</b> of watching crappy unresolved restart endings we FINALLY get a real ending and it's a yuri ending where the girl remains a girl and get the girl and...thud. Nothing." [...] The anime was given an overall score of 7/10 by Friedman.|$|E
500|$|Reviews of FireRed and LeafGreen {{were mostly}} positive, and the games {{currently}} hold an aggregate score of 81percent on Metacritic. Craig Harris of IGN gave the games an [...] "Outstanding" [...] 9.0/10 rating and praised {{the creators of}} the games for creating a game that [...] "works extremely well for the handheld market. It doesn't have quite the same variety as Ruby/Sapphire, but it's still incredibly satisfying." [...] Harris was less positive about the games' graphics, which he thought were [...] "limited" [...] and [...] "basic". GameSpot's Greg Kasavin, who gave the games 8.4 out of 10, commented that [...] "though Pokémon could probably use a few new twists <b>after</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>years,</b> FireRed and LeafGreen are great role-playing games on their own merits, filled with lots more content and more challenges than last year's Ruby and Sapphire, and offering up plenty of addictive gameplay {{that can be a}} lot of fun for players of all ages." [...] Unlike Harris, Kasavin praised the games' graphics for their [...] "colorful good looks and the endearing character designs that the series is known for." [...] Game Informer rated the games a [...] "Very Good" [...] 8/10 for being [...] "a lot of fun", yet they saw the graphics as [...] "utterly unremarkable" [...] when compared to other handheld games.|$|E
500|$|Pitchfork writer Stuart Berman {{stated that}} [...] "The Hungry Saws {{temperate}} approach {{feels like the}} work of a band who are grateful for a new lease on life, but not sure exactly what to do with it," [...] noting how [...] "the record turns increasingly more restrained, as it reconciles the band's well-established soul affinities with a more pastoral presentation" [...] while praising its [...] "beautifully rendered" [...] ballads. In his review for PopMatters, Michael Keefe opined that while [...] "all of The Hungry Saw finds Tindersticks trekking through fairly familiar territory...they find new diversions along the way." [...] Writing for Record Collector, Jake Kennedy said that [...] "The Hungry Saw marks a wonderful coming of age for Tindersticks...this is the sound of pure rejuvenation." [...] In a less complementary review, Shannon Zimmerman of Spin found that [...] "the first half of Tindersticks' latest is a can't-miss proposition" [...] but that [...] "the disc's second half descends into a morass of half-finished, melancholic curios that mostly go nowhere slowly." [...] Uncut critic Sam Richards was similarly unimpressed, offering that [...] "Tindersticks have returned refreshed, but some of the old dissolute glamour is gone." [...] This opinion was not shared by Tiny Mix Tapes, whose reviewing writer said that [...] "ultimately, it’s another Tindersticks record, and they’re still good <b>after</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>years.</b> It’s not an incredibly remarkable record, but when a band is this consistent for this long, it’s hard to fault it." ...|$|E
50|$|A {{major theme}} {{in the book is}} people's hopes and dreams as sources of the {{motivation}} they need to succeed. Hope is each character's central motive for action.

500|$|Opeth {{returned}} home in 2004 to start writing new material for its eighth album, {{and by the}} end of the year, they had finished writing it. Opeth's European label, Music for Nations, closed its doors in 2005, and after negotiations with various labels, the band signed with Roadrunner Records. Åkerfeldt said the primary reason for signing with Roadrunner was the label's wide distribution, ensuring the album would be available at larger-chain retailers. When news leaked that the band was signed to Roadrunner, who predominantly worked with trend-oriented rock and metal, some fans accused the band of selling out. [...] "To be honest," [...] Åkerfeldt said, [...] "that's such an insult after 15years as a band and 8records. I can't believe we haven't earned each and every Opeth fan's credibility <b>after</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>years.</b> I mean, our songs are 10minutes long!" [...] The band rehearsed for three weeks before entering the studio, the first time the band rehearsed since the 1998 album, My Arms, Your Hearse. During rehearsal, keyboardist Wiberg joined Opeth as a full-time member. Opeth recorded at Fascination Street Studios in Örebro, Sweden, from March 18 to June 1, 2005, and released the resulting Ghost Reveries on August 30, 2005, to critical acclaim and commercial success. The album debuted at number64 in the US, and number nine in Sweden, higher than any previous Opeth release. Keith Bergman of Blabbermouth.net gave the album ten out of ten, one of only 21albums to achieve a perfect rating from the site. Rod Smith of Decibel magazine called Ghost Reveries [...] "achingly beautiful, sometimes unabashedly brutal, often a combination of both".|$|E
500|$|In 1976 Hordern {{joined the}} RSC in Stratford-upon-Avon, where he {{appeared}} as Prospero for Trevor Nunn in The Tempest, an engagement which the actor {{found to be}} unpleasant because of his poor relationship with the show's director, Clifford Williams. After that came a short run of Love's Labour's Lost in which he played Don Adriano de Armado opposite Alan Rickman and Zoë Wanamaker. Hordern was the oldest member {{of the company and}} found it difficult to adjust to the behaviour and attitudes of some of the younger and less experienced actors. He found it different from the 1950s: non-intimate, characterless, and lacking in morale because management preferred discipline rather than offering guidance and assistance to their young actors. Writing in his 1993 biography, Hordern wrote: [...] "Being at Stratford again <b>after</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>years</b> was rather like being on a battleship or an aircraft carrier that doesn't often come into harbour. You are at sea for long periods and away from the rest of your service and if the captain of your ship is a good one then the ship is happy; if not, then the commission you serve is very unhappy because you are a long way from land. At Stratford that season I was a long way from land." [...] Later, in 1976, Hordern portrayed the kingly father of the Prince (played by Richard Chamberlain) in the musical film adaptation of Cinderella, The Slipper and the Rose, and returned to the role of George in Stoppard's Jumpers at the Lyttelton Theatre. The theatre critic Kenneth Hurren [...] "enjoyed it immoderately" [...] and thought the revival revealed a [...] "tidier play than it look". Hordern compared it to the 1972 version by saying: [...] "It is unquestionably a busy little number, and my first impression of the piece, back in 1972, was that it had more decoration than substance, and that the decoration was more chaotic than coherent." ...|$|E
