40|$|Background/purpose: Little {{is known}} about the force-transmission {{characteristics}} and patterns of telescopic-retained removable partial dentures (RPDs) as related to their type and rigidity (rigid and/or resilient) and the number of <b>abutting</b> teeth supporting the telescopic dentures. In this study, we compared the strain around the <b>abutting</b> teeth and edentulous ridges supporting telescopic-retained RPDs with different designs using a strain gauge technique. Materials and methods: A maxillary model including four <b>abutting</b> teeth (# 14, 13, 23, and 24) was constructed and is referred to as Case 1. In total, four RPD frameworks (two resilient and two rigid) were fabricated for Case 1 with a conventional telescope retainer and attachment-retained telescopic retainer (ARTR) groups. A vertical static load of 280 N was applied, and strain values obtained from the strain gauges were recorded. RPDs were modified according to the following cases—Case 2 included teeth 14, 13, and 23; Case 3 included teeth 14 and 13; and Case 4 included teeth 13 and 23 —and measurements were repeated. A randomized block analysis of the variance test was conducted using a general linear model procedure with statistical software. Multiple comparisons between groups were performed using Tukey’s honest significant difference test (α= 0. 05). Results: RPDs with an ARTR produced more strain distal to the <b>abutting</b> teeth than RPDs with a conventional telescope retainer. Both retainer types with a rigid design produced more strain distal to the <b>abutting</b> teeth than did retainers with a resilient design. RPDs supported by four, three, and two unilateral <b>abutting</b> teeth produced similar strain patterns. RPDs supported by two bilateral <b>abutting</b> teeth produced the highest strain distal to the <b>abutting</b> teeth, but {{there was no significant difference}} between the strains produced by RPDs supported by either two unilateral or bilateral <b>abutting</b> teeth. The highest strain values were obtained from strain gauges distal to the “terminal” <b>abutting</b> teeth. Directions of the principal strain were in a vertical direction for gauges located distal to the terminal <b>abutting</b> teeth. More strain was produced on the posterior edentulous ridges. Conclusion: RPDs with an ARTR and both retainer types with a rigid design produced more strain distal to the <b>abutting</b> teeth. Using more than two <b>abutting</b> teeth did not improve the strain patterns of the tested RPDs. More strain was produced on the posterior edentulous ridges...|$|R

40|$|A normal-fault network from Milne Point, Alaska, is {{investigated}} {{focusing on}} characterizing geometry, displacement, strain, and different fault interactions. The network, constrained from three-dimensional seismic reflection data, comprises {{two generations of}} faults: Cenozoic north-northeast–trending faults and Jurassic west-northwest–trending faults, which highly compartmentalize Upper Triassic to Lower Cretaceous reservoirs. The west-northwest–trending faults are influenced by a similarly oriented underlying structural grain. This influence is characterized by increases in throw on several faults, strain localization, reorientation of faults {{and an increase in}} linkage maturity. Reconstructing fault plane geometries and mapping spatial variations in throw identified key characteristic features in their interactions and reactivation of pre-existing structures. Faults are divided into isolated, <b>abutting,</b> and splaying faults. Isolated faults exhibit a range of displacement profiles depending on the degree of restriction at fault tips. Fault splays accommodate step-like decreases in throw along larger main faults with a throw maximum at the intersection with the main fault. Throw profiles of <b>abutting</b> faults are divided into two groups: early stage <b>abutting</b> faults with throw minima at both the isolated and <b>abutting</b> tips, and developed <b>abutting</b> faults with throw maxima near the <b>abutting</b> tip. Developed <b>abutting</b> faults accumulate throw after initial abutment, locally reactivating and transferring throw onto the pre-existing fault. Two <b>abutting</b> faults can link kinematically by reactivating a segment of the pre-existing fault forming a trailing fault. The motion sense of the trailing fault can be synthetic or antithetic to the reactivated pre-existing fault, producing increases or decreases in the throw of the pre-existing fault, respectivel...|$|R

5|$|The kvitelach {{placed in}} the Western Wall differ from the kvitelach given in Hasidic courts, as they contain prayers, {{requests}} or messages written directly to God. These prayer notes are folded and wedged into the cracks and crevices of the Wall.

The Royal Stoa, an exceptionally large basilica complex which served various commercial and legal functions, looked down on the intersection from atop the Temple platform. Although the Stoa stood on the Temple esplanade, it was constructed upon an expansion added by Herod. It was therefore evidently not considered sacred by some at the time, allowing it {{to be used for}} mundane activities. The heavy public traffic to and from this edifice accounts for the width of the stepped street, which approximates that of a modern four-lane highway.|$|E
5|$|Hebron Church is {{surrounded}} {{on three sides}} by a graveyard, consisting of about 700 granite, marble, slate and wooden headstones laid in semi-regular rows running northeast to southeast. The graveyard also <b>abuts</b> the northeastern elevation of the community building. Its interments date from about 1806 to the present; early headstones have deteriorated beyond recognition, and may be older than 1806. Slaves and other people of color are interred in a small area of the graveyard's southeastern section, with simpler markers than the cemetery's other headstones. Although its headstones are generally rectangular granite stones and large obelisks, the graveyard's earliest headstones were simple wooden boards. Several gravestones are ornately carved, including one modeled on a tree stump. The graveyard is active, with the most recent burials at the property's northern end. Dr. William Blum, Sr., an electrochemist at the National Bureau of Standards who invented a chrome plating technique used in banknote printing, is interred at the cemetery.|$|E
5|$|St Mary le Strand was {{designed}} by James Gibbs and completed in 1717, to replace a previous church demolished {{to make way for}} Somerset House. It was the first building to be designed by Gibbs, who was influenced by Wren and Michelangelo. The column on top of the church was originally designed to support a statue of Queen Anne, but was replaced with a spire following Anne's death in 1714. It survived the Blitz but was in poor shape until John Betjeman led a campaign to restore it in the 1970s. Essex Street Chapel, the birthplace of British Unitarianism, <b>abuts</b> onto the Strand.

5|$|The parish of Selborne lies in {{the extreme}} eastern corner of the county of Hampshire, {{bordering}} on the county of Sussex, and {{not far from the}} county of Surrey; is about fifty miles south-west of London, in latitude fifty-one, and near mid-way between the towns of Alton and Petersfield. Being very large and extensive, it <b>abuts</b> on twelve parishes, two of which are in Sussex—viz, Trotton and Rogate.... The soils of this district are almost as various and diversified as the views and aspects. The high part of the south-west consists of a vast hill of chalk, rising three hundred feet above the village, and is divided into a sheep-down, the high wood and a long hanging wood, called The Hanger. The covert of this eminence is altogether beech, the most lovely of all forest trees, whether we consider its smooth rind or bark, its glossy foliage, or graceful pendulous boughs. The down, or sheepwalk, is a pleasing park-like spot, of about one mile by half that space, jutting out on the verge of the hill-country, where it begins to break down into the plains, and commanding a very engaging view, being an assemblage of hill, dale, wood-lands, heath, and water. The prospect is bounded to the south-east and east by the vast range of mountains called the Sussex Downs, by Guild-down near Guildford, and by the Downs round Dorking, and Ryegate in Surrey, to the north-east, which altogether, with the country beyond Alton and Farnham, form a noble and extensive outline.|$|E
