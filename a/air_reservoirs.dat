25|$|With all the {{locomotives}} shut down, the {{air compressor}} no longer supplied {{air to the}} air brake system. As air leaked from the brake system, the main <b>air</b> <b>reservoirs</b> were slowly depleted, gradually reducing {{the effectiveness of the}} locomotive air brakes. At 00:56, the air pressure had dropped to a point at which the combination of locomotive air brakes and hand brakes could no longer hold the train, and it began to roll downhill toward Lac-Mégantic, just over seven miles away. A witness recalled watching the train moving slowly toward Lac-Mégantic without the locomotive lights on. The track was not equipped with signals to alert the rail traffic controller to the presence of a runaway train.|$|E

5000|$|The Westinghouse {{air brake}} system. In this system, <b>air</b> <b>reservoirs</b> are {{provided}} on every vehicle and the locomotive charges the train pipe {{with a positive}} air pressure, which releases the vehicle brakes and charges the <b>air</b> <b>reservoirs</b> on the vehicles. If the driver applies the brakes, his brake valve releases air from the train pipe, and triple valves at each vehicle detect the pressure loss and admit air from the <b>air</b> <b>reservoirs</b> to brake cylinders, applying the brakes. The Westinghouse system uses smaller <b>air</b> <b>reservoirs</b> and brake cylinders than the corresponding vacuum equipment, because a moderately high air pressure can be used. However, an air compressor is required to generate the compressed air and in the earlier days of railways, this required a large reciprocating steam air compressor, and this was regarded by many engineers as highly undesirable.|$|E

If a turbine is used, the turbine pushes air through the ventilator, with a flow valve adjusting pressure to meet patient-specific parameters.
