The electroluminescence quantum efficiencies of OLEDs based on the fluorescent conjugated polymer poly(9, 9 -dioctyl- 9 H -fluorene- 2, 7 -diyl) 1. 08 have been improved through the design, synthesis and application of new phosphorescent conjugated polymers. A study of simple blends of phosphorescent dopants with the polymer 1. 08 showed that the red-phosphorescent dopant 2. 15 is better suited for observing phosphorescent emission in a blend with the polymer 1. 08 than are green- or orange-phosphorescent dopants. (Fig 8453 A) The problem of phase separation in the simple blends was solved by tethering the red-phosphorescent dopants to the polyfluorene chains, to give the new phosphorescent conjugated copolymer 3. 30. The maximum electroluminescence efficiencies in OLEDs of the copolymer 3. 30, are greater {{than those of the}} corresponding fluorescent conjugated polymer, and typically an order of magnitude greater than those of the corresponding simple blends.

Mahony et al. produced an encouraging type II silica-gelatin hybrid with tailorable properties but without calcium content. This work focuses on investigating methods for including calcium into that material. Calcium chloride and various monobasic calcium phosphate compositions were investigated via SBF analysis followed by SEM, EDX, FTIR, XRD and BCA assay analysis. It was found that while an increasing fraction of monobasic calcium phosphate increased the rate of calcium phosphate deposition in SBF trials the synthesis route (especially drying) proves unreliable. Although some suggestion that incorporation of calcium into the silica network occurred was found, no clear evidence thereof could be determined.

30|$|The Miller-Urey (Miller and Urey 1959) (MU) {{experiment}} {{showed that}} amino acids can form from certain plausible early Earth prebiotic components and a sparking exergy source. However, the greater {{importance of the}} MU experiment might lie elsewhere. The MU experiment generated a small-scale natural experimentation model involving both exploration search and chemical information <b>addition</b> through <b>polymerisation.</b> Chemical information <b>addition</b> generated high-molecular-weight tholins {{at the bottom of}} the experimental flask. These tholins represent the point of experimental exhaustion. Prolonged experimentation did not influence the outcome, as heavy molecules excluded themselves from further experiments by accumulating away from the exergy source. In this case, reduced diffusion of chemical information through over-polymerisation exhausted the experimentation process. Unrestricted polymerisation is a problem requiring further consideration, as overcoming this obstacle on early Earth might have been a decisive pathway for further chemical evolution into individual entities rather than a giant polymerised rubbery blob, which could have formed instead. For evolution to produce several cooperating or competing agents, there must be a naturally present condition that limits polymer overgrowth (Walker et al. 2012). The MU experiment showed another profound property of nature: nature can conduct inventive experimentation, a form of natural selection, without heredity and/or self-replication. Experiments are conducted in parallel with the direct production of experimental chemicals without the need to replicate these materials from a template. In the MU experiment, a sparking source induced gaseous components to excite, ionise, and subsequently decay. Excited and ionised components primarily relaxed and recombined, but while in an excited state, some components bond to other neighbouring molecules. The end-results only showed chemical products with decay times long enough to survive until a human observer evaluated them.|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} the {{synthesis}} of new functional isocyanide polymers and their properties, both fundamentally and in applications, are described. Polyisocyanides prepared from amino acids form very stiff, beta-sheet helical polymers with a well-defined architecture due {{to the presence of}} a hydrogen-bonding chain parallel to the covalent polymer backbone. This unique hydrogen bonding array was used to gain a more profound understanding of the polymer architecture; by using femtosecond vibrational pump-probe spectroscopy, it was implied that vibrational energy can, in principle, be transported though these molecules. The well-defined architectures also make the polymers attractive scaffolds for the arrangement of chromophores over large distances. In this way, perylenes and porphyrins, two widely studied chromophores employed in organic electronics, were incorporated into the polymer and their architecture and function were studied. In <b>addition,</b> the surface-initiated <b>polymerisation</b> of two isocyanide monomers in a controlled manner is described. So-called polymer brushes up to 200 nm in length could be easily obtained within a time span of three hours of polymerisation.

Various spectroscopic {{properties of}} the r-BODIPY in different common solvents were determined. It was shown that g- and r-BODIPY in the ground state can form homo- as well as hetero dimers. We demonstrate that the ganglioside GM 1 in lipid bilayers of 1, 2 -dioleoyl-sn-glycero- 3 -phosphocholine (DOPC) exhibits a non-uniform lateral distribution, which is an argument in favour of self-aggregation of GM 1 being an intrinsic property of the GM 1. This was concluded from energy transfer/migration studies of BODIPY-labelled gangliosides. An algorithm is presented that quantitatively accounts for donor–donor energy migration (DDEM) among fluorophore-labelled proteins forming regular non-covalent polymers. The DDEM algorithm is based on Monte Carlo (MC) and Brownian dynamics (BD) simulations and applies to the calculation of fluorescence depolarisation data, such as the fluorescence anisotropy. Thereby local orientations, as well as reorienting motions of the fluorescent groups are considered in the absence and presence of DDEM among them. A new method, in which a genetic algorithm (GA) was combined with BD and MC simulations, was developed to analyse fluorescence depolarisation data collected by the time-correlated single photon counting technique. It was applied to study g-BODIPY-labelled filamentous actin (F-actin). The technique registered the local order and reorienting motions of the fluorophores, which were covalently coupled to cysteine 374 (C 374) in actin and interacted by means of electronic energy migration within the polymer. Analyses of F-actin samples composed of different fractions of labelled actin molecules revealed the known helical organiszation of F-actin, and demonstrated the usefulness of this technique for structure determination of complex protein polymers. The distance from the filament axis to the fluorophore {{was found to be}} considerably less than expected from the proposed position of C 374 at a high filament radius. In <b>addition,</b> <b>polymerisation</b> experiments with BODIPY-actin suggest a 25 -fold more efficient signal for filament formation than pyrene-actin...|$|E
40|$|Diabetes {{is one of}} {{the leading}} causes of death and {{disability}} in the world. Even though insulin was discovered in 1920, an intense research on diabetes has been conducted during the last five decades and this is because of the market size. The huge demand is creating the need for the development of new approaches. This project involved the research aimed at better understanding and improvements in performance of glucose biosensors. In general, high surface area electrodes are desired as the high surface area provides more active sites for electrochemical reactions, and hence higher kinetic rate capability. Therefore, the determination of the active electrochemical surface area of the electrode is very important. A study has been conducted to determine the real electrochemical surface area of the Pelikan screen printed electrodes (SPEs) and a method has been optimised and established by Pelikan for the evaluation of their SPEs. Another very important issue that most of the current blood glucose monitoring tests are facing is the haematocrit effect, since the haematocrit differences observed in the blood samples can significantly affect glucose measurements. Therefore a study has been conducted in order to observe the absorption of the blood samples into the working electrode paste according to the haematocrit level. The second part of the study included the characterisation of the novel conjugated polymer made of N-(N, N’ diethyldicarbamoyl ethyl amido ethyl) aniline (NDDEAEA), the optimization of the conditions for the electrochemical polymerization, their application in grafting and finally the development of NDDEAEA based glucose biosensor. The new conducting polymer, acted as a matrix for the biosensor fabrication in this study, possesses macroiniferter properties and is capable of initiation free radical initiated <b>addition</b> <b>polymerisation</b> after formation of the polyaniline (PANI) material while preserving or even enhancing some of the PANI’s electrochemical properties. This material can potentially be used in the construction of novel Pelikan electrodes with enhanced integration functionalities, e. g. grafting non adhesive polymer coatings to assure that the poor performance in sensors as a result of impact of blood components can be mitigated. The final study included the development and optimisation of the reaction conditions for grafting a hyperbranched polymer onto the surface of the multi walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT), using the A 3 and B 2 approach (described below).

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to {{investigate}} the versatility of Cu(0) -mediated reversible deactivation radical polymerisation (RDRP) in aqueous media {{in order to facilitate}} the synthesis of multiblock copolymers consisting of various acrylamides.

As a result, complex microstructures (such as hexablocks) can be achieved in a quantitative manner in a matter of few hours, which consists the fastest synthesis of such material up to date. However, the loss of the halide chain end will be shown to be the main limitation of the in situ chain extensions and block copolymerisations of acrylamides in water. In order to assess the effect {{of the nature of the}} monomer to the loss of the end group fidelity, a further investigation into the monomer nature and the lifetime of the ω-Br chain end will be conducted further highlighting the importance to monomer structure and sequence in poly(acrylamide) s multiblocks in order to maximise the retention of the bromine chain end. At the second part of this thesis, a mechanistic investigation of Cu(0) -mediated polymerisation in organic and aqueous media will also be presented. The role of the Cu(0) on the polymerisation kinetics and will be extensively investigated differentiating Cu(0) -wire from the in situ generated Cu(0) particles. The extent of disproportionation and comproportionation reactions in aqueous, organic and aqueous/organic mixtures will be also evaluated and the effect of the monomer on these reactions will also be shown demonstrating a completely different behaviour between organic and aqueous media. Finally, a direct comparison between Cu(0) and Cu(I) mediated polymerisation under exactly the same reaction conditions will be attempted indicating different active species depending on the conditions employed. Nevertheless and regardless the mechanism, the ideal polymerisation protocol that allows access to the preparation of high ordered materials will be shown. Very fast polymerisation rates (achieving quantitative conversion within 10 min), high end group fidelity even at full monomer conversion and good control over the molecular weight distribution will highlight Cu(0) -mediated polymerisation as a versatile tool for the synthesis of a wide range of materials...|$|R
40|$|Waxes {{have many}} {{potential}} uses but large-scale application is hampered by their virtual insolubility. By grafting the wax with a polyethylene glycol segment {{to form an}} alcohol ethoxylate, the solubility of the wax in commercial solvents is significantly increased. Alcohol ethoxylates are produced by the <b>polymerisation</b> <b>addition</b> of ethylene oxide onto an oxidised wax. Current methods of alcohol ethoxylate production from alcohols lead to wide ethylene oxide addition distribution and large quantities of residual alcohol. The objective {{of this study is}} to provide a method for narrowing the ethylene oxide distribution and to reduce the residual alcohol content. It is proposed to concentrate the alcohol ethoxylate in a post-production separation process using supercritical fluid extraction. The system is modelled to contain three pseudo-components: an alkane, an alcohol and an alcohol ethoxylate. Propane is selected as the supercritical solvent of choice due to the large solubility difference between the alkane and polyethylene glycol. Lower molecular weight alkane phase equilibrium data with propane is abundant but extrapolation to higher molecular weights requires further investigation as it may be complicated by molecular folding. Molecular folding occurs in crystalline polyethylene and high molecular weight normal alkanes but information regarding molecular folding in solution is inconclusive. A model is proposed for molecular folding of normal alkanes in supercritical solution. A high molecular weight alkane mixture is synthesised and phase equilibrium measurement with propane are conducted. A lower molecular weight alkane mixture is used to prove the application of the principle of congruency to high-pressure phase equilibria. In the high wax mass fraction region the measurements are between the no-folding and once-folded relationship, indicating the possibility of partial molecular folding. In the mixture critical and low wax mass fraction region the measurements are similar to the non-folding relationship. Molecular folding in solution is thus dependent on the solution concentration. No phase equilibria measurements exist for propane with either high molecular weight alcohols or alcohol ethoxylates. Measurements of propane with an alcohol mixture show total solubility below 140 barA for temperatures up to 408 K. Measurements of propane with an alcohol ethoxylate at temperatures between 378 and 408 K shows that for an alcohol ethoxylate mass fraction between 0. 025 and 0. 5 pressures greater than 275 barA are required for solubilisation. When comparing the solubility of the three pseudo-components, the alkane is the most soluble followed by the alcohol. The alcohol ethoxylate is the least soluble. A counter-current supercritical extraction process is proposed for the concentration of the alcohol ethoxylate. Pilot plant tests were conducted and the proposed set-up shows good separation. An estimate of the energy requirements shows that heating and cooling constitute the majority of the energy required but with the use of heat integration it can be reduced by approximately 33 %. This work thus shows that the proposed process is both technically and economically viable. Although this work has provided a method for concentrating the alcohol ethoxylate, the process has not been optimised yet and future work includes the fine-tuning of this process...|$|R

The particular interest in this work was to design, synthesise and evaluate in situ forming drug eluting hydrogels, which {{have the potential to}} ameliorate the healing of cardiovascular diseases. With this aim the anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressant drugs rapamycin (Ra) and dexamethasone (Dex) were made water soluble by conjugation with polyethylene glycol (PEG). Ra was attached pendant from the terminal of PEGs while Dex was incorporated into dendritic structures grown from PEGs. These conjugates were further crosslinked into hydrogels by either conjugate or thiol-ene addition. The gel degradation was tuned to take between 5 and 27 days by using gel building block combinations that induced either 2 or 4 hydrolytically labile bonds per crosslink or by varying the number of crosslinking sites of the building blocks. The use of thiol-ene addition prolonged the degradation time nearly seven folded compared to conjugate addition as a more stable crosslink was formed. Two different formulations for gelling via conjugate addition were used (acrylate-thiol or vinyl sulphone-thiol) to deliver Ra, which was carried by either a 4 - or 2 -armed PEG. The elution kinetic for the respective gel formulation was of zero order during 15 and 19 days of gel degradation. In addition, Ra was PEGylated via esters, with a distance of either one or two carbons to a nearby thio-ether functionality. The difference in ester conjugation resulted in a slight but significant change in drug-PEG conjugate stability, which was mirrored by the increased time to reach the half amount of total drug elution; from 9. 3 to 10. 2 days and from 5. 1 to 9. 7 days for the two gel formulations, respectively. Dexamethasone was incorporated via an ester into dendrons of first and second generation pending from 2 - and 4 -armed PEGs at loadings of 2, 4 or 6 Dex molecules per carrier molecule. The resulting elution kinetic was of zero order during degradation periods of 5 - 27 days. Released Dex still possessed biological activity as determined by an in vitro cell assay. The novelties in this thesis are: (A) slow release of rapamycin obtained by covalent incorporation into hydrogels, (B) the use of unique PEG-based dendrimers to incorporate dexamethasone into a hydrogel and (C) zero order sustained release of dexamethasone at physiological pH.

Dessutom, Ra PEGylerades via estrar med ett avstånd på antingen ett eller två kol till en närliggande tioeter.

Nyheterna i den här avhandlingen består av: (A) kontrollerad utsöndring av rapamycin uppnådd genom kovalent inbindning till hydrogeler, (B) användandet av unika PEGbaserade dendrimerer för kovalent inbindning av dexametason till hydrogeler och (C) nollte ordningens utsöndring av dexametason vid fysiologiskt pH.
