25|$|I {{just want}} to say that when I was 16 or 17 years old, I went to see Buddy Holly play at Duluth National Guard Armory and I was three feet away from him… and he looked at me. And I just have some kind of feeling that he was – I don’t know how or why – but I know he was with us <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> were making this record in some kind of way.|$|E
500|$|I was {{the only}} one who asked for a rise, and Gilbert was furious with me. [...] <b>All</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> were rehearsing [...] he never spoke to me, and only {{acknowledged}} my existence by sometimes saying sneeringly: 'Make way for the High-Salaried Artiste!' ...Passing storms like this did occasionally ruffle the course of our friendship, but on the whole it flowed on deep and strong.|$|E
500|$|Screenwriters Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman, who {{had worked}} on the two {{previous}} Transformers films, declined to return for the third film, with Kurtzman declaring that [...] "the franchise is so wonderful that it deserves to be fresh, <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time.</b> <b>We</b> just felt like we'd given it a lot and didn't have an insight for where {{to go with it}} next". Revenge of the Fallens co-writer Ehren Kruger became the sole screenwriter for Dark of the Moon. Kruger had frequent meetings with Industrial Light & Magic's (ILM) visual effects producers, who suggested plot points such as the scenes in Chernobyl.|$|E

5000|$|<b>All</b> <b>the</b> <b>Times</b> <b>We</b> Had is <b>the</b> first {{full-length}} album {{released by}} the band Ivan & Alyosha. The group had released three EPs prior {{to the release of}} the album. The album was released on February 26, 2013. [...] It was released by Missing Piece Records under license to Dualtone Records. <b>All</b> <b>the</b> <b>Times</b> <b>We</b> Had follows <b>the</b> release of The Cabin Sessions (EP) in 2012, which was released as a special preview to the album.|$|R

500|$|Rick Ross {{stated that}} the song {{was one of his}} {{favorites}} featured on Mastermind. He said, [...] "'Sanctified' was most definitely one of the favorites. It's because how much time—Just watching Kanye put into this because it actually started as a sample. We did the sample maybe 10 different ways and then we ultimately went with a beautiful lady out of Miami, Ms. Betty Wright. She blessed us. So, just hearing that chorus. Just hearing the way it came out. <b>All</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> put in it. It most definitely was dope." [...] Then after Ross' sixth studio album Mastermind was released for free streaming on iTunes, the full version of [...] "Sanctified" [...] was released.|$|E
2500|$|The {{best thing}} for us was the freedom {{we had to make}} it. We had <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> wanted on it. With Kevin being in Melbourne we’d take a week here and there and we could work and shape the songs more with that freedom and time ... there were periods where, for example, Kevin {{was the only one in}} the studio with the rest of us all working or doing whatever.|$|E
2500|$|Pat {{insisted that}} we quit writing [...] "stupid girl songs", and start writing {{about things that}} really matter — like food and fishing. So he and I wrote [...] "Weinerschnitzel", [...] "All", and [...] "No, All!" [...] {{in a fit of}} Allular frustration. The songs were only seconds long, but that was <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> needed to make the point. We {{temporarily}} put aside all of our so-called [...] "girl songs" [...] and recorded the Fat EP. This is the only record we ever made without a single love song on it.|$|E
500|$|In addition, it {{has been}} claimed that the re-planning delayed the tram's completion. One of the {{designers}} of the tram noted that [...] "if <b>we</b> added up <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>times</b> <b>we</b> went back {{to try to save}} money, we probably lost a year. Maybe we saved $2 million, but what did we lose? If we had an extra year, that would have meant a lot." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But," [...] replied Mary, [...] "you may dream {{several hours}} in the night, so as to {{remember}} good long dreams in the morning, and yet perhaps you might have been, for some time, perfectly sound asleep, {{so as not to}} have any dreams in your mind at all. Some persons think <b>we</b> dream <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> when <b>we</b> are asleep, and others think <b>we</b> don't dream <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time.</b> Now <b>we</b> might contrive some experiments to decide the question." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course not; but travelin' <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> when <b>we</b> mighter got on {{the cars}} {{in the first place}} is more'n I bargained for." ...|$|R
2500|$|Luther {{recalled}} his first speech on sobriety. “My relations, {{you all know}} that I am {{to take care of}} you while going across the big water to another country, and <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> are to stay there. [...] I have heard that when anyone joins this show, about the first thing he thinks of is getting drunk. [...] I understand that regulations of the Buffalo Bill show require that no Indian shall be given any liquor. [...] You all know that I do not drink, and I am going to keep you all from it. [...] Don’t think because you may be closely related to me I will shield you, for I will not. [...] I will report to Colonel Cody immediately anyone I find drinking.” ...|$|E
2500|$|In a {{documentary}} short that profiled Hank, his mother related how doctors {{had told her}} that Hank's liver was damaged, and that she didn't know how long he had to live, and that she [...] "didn't know what to do." [...] Hank had been in rehab before, as well as court-mandated detox, and it had never worked. [...] Once Hank was even kicked out of Alcoholics Anonymous because he brought into the meeting a bottle of Mad Dog 20-20 and started drinking it five seconds after the meeting started. [...] Regarding trying to get Hank help for his alcoholism, Howard Stern explained, [...] "People always asked me if we {{tried to get him to}} stop drinking, and I said <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> did..." [...] Stern also related that there were employees of the show who tried to get Hank into programs.|$|E
2500|$|Clayton's bass guitar {{was heavily}} processed, {{to the point}} that it sounded like a {{keyboard}} bass (an instrument utilized on [...] "Mofo"). The Edge wanted to steer away from the image he had since the 1980s as having an echo-heavy guitar sound. As a result, he was enthusiastic about experimenting with his guitar's sound, hence the distorted guitar sounds on the album, achieved with a variety of effects pedals, synthesisers and knob twiddling. Bono was very determined to avoid the vocal style present on previous (especially 1980s) albums, characterized by pathos, rich timbre, a sometimes theatrical quality and his use of falsetto singing: instead he opted for a rougher, more nervous and less timbre-laden style. The production team made his voice sound more intimate, as up-front and raw as possible. As Flood explained, [...] "You get his emotional involvement with the songs through the lyrics and the way he reacts to the music—without him having to go to 11 <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time...</b> <b>We</b> only used extreme effects on his voice during the recording, for him to get himself into a different place, and then, gradually, we pulled most effects out." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "All right!" [...] sang out Stillman. [...] "Come, everybody, {{and look}} at this! It was right under our noses <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> and <b>we</b> didn't see it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “That is what I was {{thinking}} <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> that <b>we</b> were walking last night,” Joyce said. “We can’t keep on tramping and living on cocoa-nuts for ever.” ...|$|R
5000|$|Simone said it [...] "sounds fresh {{because we}} are {{exploring}} new things. We get tired of doing <b>the</b> same thing <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> so <b>we</b> search for other things to do." ...|$|R
2500|$|Speaking to the Aldershot and North Hants Conservative Association on 4 February 1983, Powell {{blamed the}} United Nations for the Falklands War by the General Assembly {{resolution}} of December 1967 that stated [...] "its {{gratitude for the}} continuous efforts made by the Government of Argentina to facilitate the process of decolonisation" [...] and further called on Britain and Argentina to negotiate. Powell said that [...] "it {{would be difficult to}} imagine a more cynically wicked or criminally absurd or insultingly provocative action". As 102 had voted for this resolution, with only Britain voting against it (with 32 abstentions), he claimed it was not surprising that Argentina had continually threatened Britain until this threatening turned into aggression: [...] "It is with the United Nations that the guilt lies for the breach of the peace and the bloodshed". The UN knew that no international forum had ruled against British possession of the Falklands but had voted its gratitude to Argentina who wanted to annexe the Islands from their rightful owners. It was therefore [...] "disgraceful" [...] for Britain to belong to such a body that engaged in [...] "pure spite for spite's sake against the United Kingdom": [...] "We were, and are, the victims of our own insincerity. For over thirty years we have sanctimoniously and dishonestly pretended respect, if not awe, for an organisation which <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> knew was a monstrous and farcical humbug.... The moral is to cease to engage in humbug, which almost all have happily and self-righteously engaged in for a generation".|$|E
6000|$|... 'No!' {{declared}} Bob, {{shaking the}} bush for emphasis, 'I'll protest that I {{did not think}} of anybody but you <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> were dropping down channel, <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> were off Cadiz, all the time through battles and bombardments. I seemed to see you in the smoke, and, thinks I, if I go to Davy's locker, what will she do?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I am sure, Lucy, {{that was}} more your fault than mine,' said Harriet; 'I could not be {{watching}} him <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> were at that place.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "After we {{get them}} to the shore, what then?" [...] {{questioned}} his brother. [...] "We can't keep them in <b>the</b> boat <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> that <b>we</b> are exploring the other islands." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "It's {{important}} that {{even those who}} consider ourselves very skeptical and think that we walk around employing our critical capacities <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> nonetheless, <b>we</b> can <b>all</b> get fooled." [...] Penny Lane ...|$|R
6000|$|... "As one sees," [...] he answered, [...] "here we are fortunate. Here we are always, always busy. We turn {{people away}} <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> because <b>we</b> prefer to serve well our old customers." ...|$|R
60|$|It rained with {{inflexible}} pertinacity during <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> were at York; and {{the next}} day it rained still, when we took the cars for Castle Howard station.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Poor Helen! I {{shall be}} in dread of an {{outbreak}} <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> are here,' said Violet; 'but she {{means to be}} good, and every one cannot be like Johnnie.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Anyway, {{all this}} tomfoolery {{is a great}} waste of time," [...] {{continued}} the lady, glancing {{up and down the}} jury disparagingly. [...] "Talk--talk--talk! When <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> know perfectly well----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "First" [...] said he, [...] "always keep {{in sight}} of me. For this purpose, watch me <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> when <b>we</b> are stepping, and keep before, rather than behind, when we are walking.|$|R
6000|$|... "But, madame," [...] she exclaimed, [...] "I have remembered! The name Strangewey--you see it there--it was in {{our minds}} <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> that <b>we</b> had seen or heard of it quite lately. Don't you remember--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This {{will be a}} {{good place}} for uncle George and me to have our breakfast," [...] said Rollo to himself, [...] "and we can see <b>the</b> Jungfrau <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> while <b>we</b> are eating it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hard to tell. Two {{or three}} thousand, mebbe. There's almost no ketchin' them, an' they regrowin' <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>We</b> ain't had no luck this spring. The bunch in corral we got last year." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “This is delightful!” she exclaimed, as they sped on swiftly. “I {{used to go}} sailing now {{and then}} at Toronto, but <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> have lived here I’ve never been on the water.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I cannot help {{wondering}} why that poor monkey kept so still <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> were talking. One {{would think that}} it should have been frightened away just as we came under the tree." ...|$|E
60|$|And <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> as <b>we</b> came nearer and nearer, {{our hearts}} sank more and more, as we {{wondered}} in what state we should find our dear brother, {{and whether we}} should find him at all.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Her? Why, {{he knows}} {{that it is a}} lady <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> and <b>we</b> were only just now doubting whether the sex of the writer could be really what it seems. Shame, Ladywell!' said his friend Neigh.|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{how about}} paying for it?" [...] George said. [...] "I am afraid he will expect {{a great deal}} of money, for it has been away <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> and <b>we</b> have only got six shillings between us." ...|$|R
