50|$|AGI: The ASRock Graphics Interface (AGI) is a {{proprietary}} {{variant of the}} <b>Accelerated</b> <b>Graphics</b> <b>Port</b> (<b>AGP)</b> standard. Its purpose is to provide AGP-support for ASRock motherboards that use chipsets lacking native AGP support. However, it is not fully compatible with AGP, and several video card chipsets are known not to be supported.|$|E

5000|$|Intel gave only a {{qualified}} welcome to PCI-X, stressing {{that the next}} generation bus {{would have to be}} a [...] "fundamentally new architecture". According to Cary Snyder, a senior analyst with the Microprocessor Report, [...] "PCI-X took two years to take off" [...] because of a [...] "falling-out between the PCI SIG and a key Intel interconnect designer who spearheaded development on the <b>Accelerated</b> <b>Graphics</b> <b>Port</b> caused Intel to pull out of the initial PCI-X effort".|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{spectacular}} {{advancement in}} microelectronics {{resulted in the}} creation of new system level design languages, such as SystemC, which put fourth new design and verification challenges. In this paper, we present an approach verifying SystemC designs using model check-ing and assertion based verification. Such verification is enabled through two transformations from SystemC to AsmL (the Abstract State Ma-chines Language) and vice-versa. The soundness of these transforma-tions, proved using abstract interpretation, guarantees the correctness of the model checking results and the validity of the generated assertion monitors (to be checked by simulation). We illustrate our approach on the SystemC/AsmL modeling and verification of the widely used Accel-erated <b>Graphics</b> <b>Port</b> (<b>AGP)</b> standard. The verified AGP model can be either refined to implement an AGP core or used to validate existent compatible device. ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{company also}} formed a {{partnership}} with Intel and Chips and Technologies to introduce similar technology as an add-in card for PC's, a project known as [...] "Auburn". This project became a showcase for the <b>Accelerated</b> <b>Graphics</b> <b>Port</b> system being introduced by Intel, which led to several design decisions that hampered the resulting products. Released in 1998 as the Intel740, the system lasted {{less than a year}} in the market before being sold off under the StarFighter and Lightspeed brandnames.|$|R
50|$|The Radeon 7500 {{launched}} {{in the second half}} of 2001 alongside the Radeon 8500 (R200). It used an <b>Accelerated</b> <b>Graphics</b> <b>Port</b> (<b>AGP)</b> 4x interface. Around the time that the Radeon 8500 and 7500 were announced, rival Nvidia released its GeForce 3 Ti500 and Ti200, the 8500 and Ti500 are direct competitors but the 7500 and Ti200 are not.|$|E
50|$|The {{graphics}} address remapping table (GART), sometimes {{known as}} the graphics translation table (GTT), is an I/O memory management unit (IOMMU) used by <b>Accelerated</b> <b>Graphics</b> <b>Port</b> (<b>AGP)</b> and PCI Express (PCIe) graphics cards. The GART allows the graphics card direct memory access (DMA) to the host system memory, through which buffers of textures, polygon meshes and other data are loaded.|$|E
50|$|The Advanced Graphics Riser is a {{variation}} of the <b>Accelerated</b> <b>Graphics</b> <b>Port</b> (<b>AGP)</b> used in some PCIe motherboards made by MSI to offer a limited backwards compatibility with AGP. It is, effectively, a modified PCIe slot allowing for performance comparable to an AGP 4x/8x slot, but with limited support of AGP cards. The manufacturer has published a non-exhaustive compatibility list of cards and chipsets that work with the modified slot.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. When {{multiple}} applications use the legacy Video Graphics Array (VGA) interface {{to communicate with}} different graphics devices attached to the same machine, problems inherited by the old Industry Standard Architecture (ISA) system happen. If the accesses to these graphics devices are not correctly controlled, an access made using that interface might be decoded by the wrong graphics card. Since the Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) and the Ac-celerated <b>Graphics</b> <b>Port</b> (<b>AGP)</b> standards are compatible with ISA, this problem remains in most modern devices. This paper presents a solution independent of the application to this problem. It consists of a conceptual architecture, which defines an arbiter that manages all the VGA accesses and an user space inter-face used by the applications. An implementation using the Linux Kernel and the X server is also presented. The results of the experiments {{show that there is}} no significant performance loss. 1...|$|R

50|$|Front-side buses usually {{connect the}} CPU {{and the rest}} of the {{hardware}} via a chipset, which Intel implemented as a northbridge and a southbridge. Other buses like the Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI), <b>Accelerated</b> <b>Graphics</b> <b>Port</b> (<b>AGP),</b> and memory buses all connect to the chipset in order for data to flow between the connected devices. These secondary system buses usually run at speeds derived from the front-side bus clock, but are not necessarily synchronized to it.|$|E
50|$|OpenVMS {{contains}} a {{graphical user interface}} (GUI), a feature that was not available on the original VAX-11/VMS system. Prior {{to the introduction of}} DEC VAXstation systems in the 1980s, the operating system was used and managed from text-based terminals, such as the VT100, which provide serial data communications and screen-oriented display features. Versions of VMS running on DEC Alpha workstations in the 1990s supported OpenGL and <b>Accelerated</b> <b>Graphics</b> <b>Port</b> (<b>AGP)</b> graphics adapters.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Accelerated</b> <b>Graphics</b> <b>Port</b> (<b>AGP)</b> is a {{high-speed}} point-to-point channel for attaching a video card {{to a computer}} system, primarily {{to assist in the}} acceleration of 3D computer graphics. It was originally designed as a successor to PCI-type connections for video cards. Since 2004, AGP has been progressively phased out in favor of PCI Express (PCIe); by mid-2008, PCI Express cards dominated the market and only a few AGP models were available.|$|E

50|$|The GPUs of {{the most}} {{powerful}} class typically interface with the motherboard by means of an expansion slot such as PCI Express (PCIe) or <b>Accelerated</b> <b>Graphics</b> <b>Port</b> (<b>AGP)</b> and can usually be replaced or upgraded with relative ease, assuming the motherboard is capable of supporting the upgrade. A few graphics cards still use Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) slots, but their bandwidth is so limited that they are generally used only when a PCIe or AGP slot is not available.|$|E
50|$|ATI made {{a number}} of changes over the 3D RAGE II: a new {{triangle}} setup engine, perspective correction improvements, fog support and transparency implementations, specular lighting support, and enhanced video playback and DVD support. The 3D Rage Pro chip was designed for Intel's <b>Accelerated</b> <b>Graphics</b> <b>Port</b> (<b>AGP),</b> taking advantage of execute-mode texturing, command pipelining, sideband addressing, and full 2×-mode protocols. Initial versions relied on standard graphics memory configurations: up to 8 MiB of SGRAM or 16 MB of WRAM, depending on the model.|$|E
50|$|Windows 98, in general, {{provides}} improved—and {{a broader}} range of—support for IDE and SCSI drives and drive controllers, floppy drive controllers and all other classes of hardware than Windows 95. There is integrated <b>Accelerated</b> <b>Graphics</b> <b>Port</b> (<b>AGP)</b> support (although the USB Supplement to Windows 95 OSR2 and later releases of Windows 95 did have AGP support). Windows 98 has built-in DVD support and UDF 1.02 read support. The Still imaging architecture (STI) with TWAIN support was introduced for scanners and cameras and Image Color Management 2.0 for devices to perform color space transformations. Multiple monitor support allows using up to 8 multiple monitors and/or multiple graphics adapters on a single PC. Windows 98 shipped with DirectX 5.2 which notably included DirectShow. Windows 98 Second Edition shipped with DirectX 6.1.|$|E

50|$|PCI slots {{were the}} first {{physically}} incompatible expansion ports to directly squeeze ISA off the motherboard. At first, motherboards were largely ISA, including a few PCI slots. By the mid-1990s, the two slot types were roughly balanced, and ISA slots soon were in the minority of consumer systems. Microsoft's PC 99 specification recommended that ISA slots be removed entirely, though the system architecture still required ISA {{to be present in}} some vestigial way internally to handle the floppy drive, serial ports, etc., which was why the software compatible LPC bus was created. ISA slots remained for a few more years, and towards {{the turn of the century}} it was common to see systems with an <b>Accelerated</b> <b>Graphics</b> <b>Port</b> (<b>AGP)</b> sitting near the central processing unit, an array of PCI slots, and one or two ISA slots near the end. In late 2008, even floppy disk drives and serial ports were disappearing, and the extinction of vestigial ISA (by then the LPC bus) from chipsets was on the horizon.|$|E

50|$|Despite {{using the}} same {{graphics}} options as the DECstation at introduction, later options for the DEC 3000 AXP were designed exclusively for the platform. These options were Digital's ZLX-E1/E2/E3, ZLX-L1/L2 and ZLX-M1/M2 series of PixelVision architecture-based 2D/3D <b>accelerated</b> <b>graphics</b> and Kubota's high-end 3D <b>accelerated</b> <b>graphics</b> subsystem, the Denali. The Denali is an external enclosure that contains up to six geometry engines and multiple memory modules. It was capable of advanced (for the time) 3D graphics, such as interactive volume rendering.
