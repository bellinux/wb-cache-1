5|$|In the quarter-finals, {{they faced}} Atlético Madrid, and drew 1–1 on the night, but lost 1–2 on {{aggregate}} after losing 1–0 {{in the first}} leg.

Despite the loss, Leicester remained unbeaten <b>at</b> <b>home</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 2016–17 Champions League campaign.|$|E
5|$|United faced Liverpool <b>at</b> <b>home</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{following}} round, {{where the}} visitors {{took the lead}} from a Michael Owen header inside three minutes. In spite of creating plenty of goalscoring chances, the team failed to equalise until the 86th minute, when Yorke scored off a Beckham free kick. In the second minute of stoppage time, Ole Gunnar Solskjær hit a shot that sent Liverpool goalkeeper David James {{the wrong way to}} give United the win.|$|E
5|$|Ahead of Martin Foyle's second {{start to}} a season as York manager, six signings were {{made before the}} summer {{transfer}} window closed. With York 15th in the table 10 matches into the season Foyle resigned, and was succeeded by Tamworth's Gary Mills in October 2010. Under his guidance, York enjoyed an unbeaten run <b>at</b> <b>home</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> league that lasted until April 2011, when they were beaten by Mills' former team. York's push for a play-off place was ended {{late in the season}} and they finished eighth in the table. They reached the third round of the 2010–11 FA Cup, being beaten 2–0 away by Bolton Wanderers, and were knocked out {{in the first round of}} the 2010–11 FA Trophy after losing 1–0 at home to Boston United.|$|E

Arsenal came away from Old Trafford with a point against league leaders Manchester United on 19 October 1991. After a midweek European football match, Arsenal beat Notts County by two goals, a result which moved them fourth in the table.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal faced {{cup holders}} Liverpool <b>at</b> <b>home</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{following}} round. A solitary goal scored by Bergkamp in the 27th minute saw the home side progress in a match layered with controversy: Martin Keown, Bergkamp and Liverpool's Jamie Carragher were all sent {{off in the}} space of ten minutes, the latter for hurling back a coin at the crowd. Against Gillingham in the fifth round, Arsenal twice had their lead cancelled out, before Tony Adams scored the winning goal of the match.|$|E

5|$|Despite his father's {{wishes that}} DeLee become a rabbi, DeLee {{attended}} Chicago Medical College. Of particular influence on DeLee was obstetrics professor W. W. Jaggard. He graduated in 1891. Author Charlotte Borst noted {{that most women}} delivered <b>at</b> <b>home</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1870s through 1890s; medical students at Northwestern only witnessed deliveries at that time if they could bribe women into having their babies at the hospital's amphitheatre.

5|$|From mid-June {{to the end}} of September 1918 Cotillo {{traveled}} around Italy, meeting officials and politicians, giving interviews to the press and addressing large crowds. His efforts in Italy were reported by the press and Italian language newspapers <b>at</b> <b>home</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> U.S.. When he returned to New York, Cotillo had risen from a largely unknown local politician to achieve public stature and become a leader of the Italian community. Based on this experience he wrote the book “Italy During the World War”, published in 1922.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, 25 {{years after}} the end of their relationship, Joyce Maynard {{auctioned}} a series of letters Salinger had written her. Maynard's memoir of her life and her relationship with Salinger, <b>At</b> <b>Home</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> World: A Memoir, was published the same year. Among other topics, the book described how Maynard's mother had consulted with her on how to appeal to the aging author (who was dressing like a child), and described Joyce's relationship with him at length. In the ensuing controversy over both the memoir and the letters, Maynard claimed that she was forced to auction the letters for financial reasons; she would have preferred to donate them to the Beinecke Library. Software developer Peter Norton bought the letters for US$156,500 and announced his intention to return them to Salinger.|$|E
5|$|Playing <b>at</b> <b>home</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Inter-Colonial Tournament, Trinidad {{once again}} {{defeated}} British Guiana in February 1925 and St Hill opened the batting to score 13 and 29.

As winners of the competition, Trinidad qualified for the final without playing another team in October 1925; British Guiana defeated Barbados but lost in the final. St Hill, remaining at number three, scored 100 in the first innings, but was dismissed for a duck in the second as Trinidad gained a narrow victory by two wickets.|$|E

Having only been above the relegation zone on goal difference come the start of 2014, the team went on a 17-match unbeaten run from February onwards. This saw York reach the play-offs with a seventh-place finish in the 2013–14 League Two table. York were beaten 1–0 on aggregate by Fleetwood Town in the play-off semi-final, the decisive goal being scored by former York player Matty Blair <b>at</b> <b>home</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first leg.|$|E
