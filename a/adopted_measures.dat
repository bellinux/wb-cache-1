5|$|In many respects, Ranavalona's {{rule was}} a {{continuation}} of precedent established under Radama I. Both monarchs encouraged {{the introduction of new}} technologies and forms of knowledge from abroad, supported the establishment of an industrialized economy, and <b>adopted</b> <b>measures</b> to professionalize the army. Both viewed foreigners with ambivalence, establishing close personal relationships and drawing upon their expertise while enforcing restrictions on their activities to avert destabilizing changes to existing cultural and political systems. In addition, both contributed to the further development of a complex political bureaucracy that enabled the Merina court to govern remote provinces across an island larger than the Netherlands, Belgium and France combined.|$|E

25|$|The Constitution's other {{innovation}} was {{allowing the}} governor to veto laws passed by the legislature. That proved problematic in the following decades, since the first legislature after adoption of the Constitution <b>adopted</b> <b>measures</b> reaffirming Virginia's prewar debt, at those interest rates (much higher than postwar) and other favorable terms. Moreover, Virginia was much poorer after the war, and tax revenues were insufficient to fund that debt. Legislation refinancing that debt would be vetoed by conservative governors {{several times in the}} next decade.|$|E
25|$|An {{economic}} depression {{that began in}} 1972 was exacerbated by capital flight, plummeting private investment, and withdrawal of bank deposits in response to Allende's socialist program. Production fell and unemployment rose. Allende <b>adopted</b> <b>measures</b> including price freezes, wage increases, and tax reforms, to increase consumer spending and redistribute income downward. Joint public-private public works projects helped reduce unemployment. Much of the banking sector was nationalized. Many enterprises within the copper, coal, iron, nitrate, and steel industries were expropriated, nationalized, or subjected to state intervention. Industrial output increased sharply and unemployment fell during the Allende administration's first year.|$|E
25|$|The 1964 coup {{dealt with}} the {{political}} obstacles by forcefully restraining opposition to the military agenda of change. With the objective of transforming Brazil into a modern capitalist economy and a military power, the regime implemented a series of reforms aimed at reducing inflation, at removing some of the distortions of import substitution industrialization, and at modernizing capital markets. The regime gradually introduced incentives to direct investment, domestic and foreign, and tackled balance of payments problems by reforming and simplifying the foreign-exchange system. In addition, the regime introduced a mechanism of periodic devaluations of the cruzeiro, taking into account inflation. Finally, the military government <b>adopted</b> <b>measures</b> to attract foreign capital and to promote exports. It took steps to expand public investment to improve the country's infrastructure and later to develop state-owned basic industries.|$|E

A declaration {{was presented to the}} Presidium condemning the media as co-conspirators against the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact in their support of Dubcek’s liberalization measures. Finally, on 2 April 1969, the government <b>adopted</b> <b>measures</b> [...] "to secure peace and order" [...] through even stricter censorship, forcing the people of Czechoslovakia to wait until the thawing of Eastern Europe for the return of a free media.|$|E
500|$|The Ministers {{are fully}} aware of the need to fight {{actively}} against terrorism. As regards the regulation of the possession of firearms, it is necessary to focus the <b>adopted</b> <b>measures</b> primarily on illegal firearms, not legally-held firearms. Illegal firearms represent a serious threat. Within the European Union, it is necessary to prevent infiltration of illegal firearms from the risk areas. It should be taken into account that bans on possession of certain types of firearms that are not, in fact, abused for terrorist acts can lead to negative consequences, especially to a transition of these firearms into the illegal sphere. The V4 states have profound historical experience with such implications.|$|E
500|$|When Oliver Cromwell {{consolidated}} {{his control}} over England {{in the early}} 1650s, he began a crackdown on religious communities that dissented from his religious views. This notably included Baptists and Quakers, and these groups began their own migration to the North American colonies to escape persecution. Those that first arrived in Boston in 1656 were promptly deported by Endecott's deputy, Richard Bellingham, while Endecott was in Salem. More Quakers arrived while Endecott was resident in Boston, and he had them imprisoned pending trial and deportation. He met several times with the Quaker, Mary Prince, after receiving an [...] "outrageous letter" [...] from her. The meetings were apparently fruitless, and she and the other Quakers were deported. Following these acts, {{the members of the}} New England Confederation all <b>adopted</b> <b>measures</b> for the prompt removal of Quakers from their jurisdictions.|$|E

After the 1994 elections, Moldovan Parliament <b>adopted</b> <b>measures</b> that distanced Moldova from Romania. The new Moldovan Constitution also provided for autonomy for Transnistria and Gagauzia.

If released, they could be rearrested without charge at any time. [...] Bryce explained that the law was necessary to protect the people of Taranaki and because he feared the two chiefs might be acquitted by a jury or, if they were convicted, receive a lenient sentence.

Haraszthy was elected as president of the Board. [...] While he was president, the Board established an office in San Francisco, created a wine library (later transferred to the University of California), <b>adopted</b> <b>measures</b> to control the phylloxera, held conventions of vineyardists and winemakers {{in different parts of the}} state, recommended legislation for the adoption of the California Legislature and Congress (including pure wine laws), and worked with Eugene W. Hilgard, the first professor of agriculture at the University of California in Berkeley, to promote good viticultural practices. Haraszthy continued to serve as president of the state board until 1888.|$|E
2500|$|The People's Republic of China {{emphasizes}} state sovereignty, {{which at}} times {{conflicts with the}} international norms or standards of human rights. [...] However, its concept of human rights has developed radically over the years. From 1949 to the late 1970s, the CPC focused on promoting {{the rights of the}} masses: collective rights rather than individual human rights. Deng Xiaoping went as far to say that the right of a nation, or sovereignty (guoquan) is more important than human rights (renquan), and right of subsistence (shengcun quan) is more fundamental than political freedom. However, from the beginning of economic reforms in 1978 to the 1989 Tiananmen incident and democratic movement, the CPC raised concerns for human rights in their domestic and international policies. In 1991, China officially accepted the idea that human rights were compatible with Chinese socialism, and in 1993 the state created the China Society for Human Rights Studies, which has represented Chinese positions on human rights in international forums, conferences, and media. China went on to sign two treaties – the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights(ICCPR) in 1997 and 1998, respectively. The ICESCR was ratified by the National People's Congress in 2001, but as of 2016, the ICCPR has not yet been ratified. , the PRC had signed more than 20 international treaties on human rights. However, in practice China still does not follow these standards. China has <b>adopted</b> <b>measures</b> that would uphold certain human rights policies within their socialist environment. The government still questions the international human rights norm, and emphasizes sovereignty over human rights. [...] The PRC is concerned that Western states may be using the concepts of human rights and democracy to justify power politics.|$|E
60|$|The garden {{referred}} to was not large or of great importance, {{but it was}} a favourite hobby of the Highlander, and, at the time, was in full bloom, luxuriant with fruit, flower, and vegetable. To save it from destruction at such a time, McKay would have given almost anything, and have gone almost any lengths. On this occasion, not knowing what to do, yet impelled by his eagerness to do something, he <b>adopted</b> <b>measures</b> that he had heard of as being used in other lands. He ordered a trench to be cut and filled with water {{on the side of his}} garden nearest the approaching plague, which might--if thoroughly carried out--have been of some use against wingless grasshoppers but could be of no use whatever against a flying foe. It would have taken an army of men to carry out such an order promptly, and his men perceived this; but the master was so energetic, so violent in throwing off his coat and working with his own hand at pick and shovel, that they were irresistibly infected with his enthusiasm, and set to work.|$|E

60|$|But besides this son, born thus a {{few months}} after Alexander's death, there was a brother of Alexander, or, rather, a half-brother, whose claims to the {{succession}} seemed to be more direct, for he was living at the time that Alexander died. The name of his brother was Aridæus. He was imbecile in intellect, and wholly insignificant as a political personage, except so far as he was by birth the next heir to Alexander in the Macedonian line. He was not the son of Olympias, but of another mother, and his imbecility was caused, it was said, by an attempt of Olympias to poison him in his youth. She was prompted to do this by her rage and jealousy against his mother, for whose sake Philip had abandoned her. The poison had ruined the poor child's intellect, though it had failed to destroy his life. Alexander, when he succeeded to the throne, <b>adopted</b> <b>measures</b> to protect Aridæus from any future attempt which his mother might make to destroy him, and for this, as well as perhaps for other reasons, took Aridæus with him on his Asiatic campaign. Aridæus and Roxana were both at Babylon when Alexander died.|$|E
