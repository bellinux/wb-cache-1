40|$|The {{response}} of a sensitive indicator species {{to the effects}} of catchment liming was assessed in a lake severely impacted by atmospheric emissions from a metal smelter in Sudbury, Canada. The lake chemistry recovered following the closure of the local smelter and major reductions (approximately 95 %) in acid and metal emissions from other area smelters, leading to recolonization of the lake with fish and other biota. However, the littoral macrobenthos community remain severely impoverished. The catchment liming sustained improved stream water quality for 20 years after the initial <b>aerial</b> <b>treatment</b> and created a littoral zone hot spot for the recolonization of Hyalella azteca. Colonization at delta sites of untreated catchment drainage areas, in the same lake, were low and highly variable, and these sites appeared to be impacted from soil erosion and episodic release of acid and metals. This study demonstrated the need to both reduce air pollutants and to conduct land reclamation in severely damaged watersheds, before lake ecosystems themselves can be fully recovered. </p...|$|E

Torpedograss was controlled for more than one year in some areas following a single <b>aerial</b> <b>treatment</b> using 0. 56, 0. 84, or 1. 12 kg acid equivalents (ae) imazapyr/ha. Combining imazapyr and fluridone did not increase the level of torpedograss control. In areas where plant biomass was reduced by fire prior to being treated with 0. 84 or 1. 12 kg ae imazapyr/ha, torpedograss was controlled {{for more than two years}} and native plant species, including duck potato (Sagittaria lancifolia L.) and pickerelweed (Pontederia cordata L.) became the dominant vegetation in less than one year. Although torpedograss was controlled in some areas, little or no long-term control was observed at 16 of the 26 treatment locations.

30|$|Adult SMs are yellowish-brown {{or light}} grey to dark brown or almost black. Females are {{approximately}} 40  mm long and males are 30  mm long (EPPO [2005]). The moths fly and lay eggs {{from the end}} of June to the beginning of August (Baranchikov et al. [1997]). One female lies on average 200 – 300 eggs on needles, with a maximum of 800 eggs (EPPO [2005]). Egg development takes about two weeks. The hairy larvae are 50 – 80  mm long and they overwinter under forest litter. At the end of April, larvae return to the crowns feeding intensively. The life cycle takes 1 – 3 years, usually 2  years, and an outbreak lasts for 2 – 3 years (Rozhkov [1963]; Baranchikov et al. [1997]; EPPO [2005]). Tree mortality is high because wood borers and bark beetles attack the weakened trees, and dead forests are predisposed to forest fires (EPPO [2005]). The SM has numerous natural enemies including egg, pupal and larval parasitoids, bacteria, viruses, fungi and insects (Orlinski [2000]). As many as 10 %– 60 % of eggs, 10 %– 99 % of larvae and 70 % of pupae are killed, the highest values pertaining to the end of outbreaks (Boldaruev [1969]; EPPO [2005]). <b>Aerial</b> <b>treatments</b> with chemical and bacterial products have been used during outbreaks in Russia (EPPO [2005]).|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{nutrient}} availability and litter quality on litter decomposition were measured in two oligotrophic phosphorus (P) -limited Florida Everglades esturies, United States. The two estuaries differ, {{in that one}} (Shark River estuary) is directly connected to the Gulf of Mexico and receives marine P, while the other (Taylor Slough estuary) does not receive marine P because Florida Bay separates it from the Gulf of Mexico. Decomposition of three macrophytes. Cladium jamaicense, Eleochaaris spp., andJuncus roemerianus, was studied using a litter bag technique over 18 mo. Litter was exposed to three treatments: soil surface+macroinvertebrates (=macro), soil surface without macroinvertebrates (=wet), and above the soil and water (=aerial). The third treatment replicated the decomposition of standing dead leaves. Decomposition rates showed that litter exposed to the wet and macro treatments decomposed significantly faster than the <b>aerial</b> <b>treatment,</b> where atmospheric deposition was {{the only source of}} nutrients. Macroinvertebrates had no influence on litter decompostion rates. C. jamaicense decomposed faster at sites, with higher P, andEleocharis spp. decomposed significantly faster at sites with higher nitrogen (N). Initial tissue C:N and C:P molar ratios revealed that the nutrient quality of litter of bothEleocharis spp. andJ. roemerianus was higher thanC. jamaicense, but onlyEleocharis spp. decomposed faster thanC. jamaicense. C. jamaicense litter tended to immobilize P, whileEleocharis spp. litter showed net remineralization of N and P.

Recent research also suggests the potential for health effects from lower-level, subacute manganese exposure, including decreased neuromuscular function, decreased cognitive function, and poorer performance on neurobehavioral tests. The purpose of our study was to evaluate the potential for low-level exposure to organic manganese among agricultural workers in Idaho and the potential for such exposure to result in adverse health effects. Two commonly used pesticides containing manganese are Maneb and Mancozeb, both of which are fungicides used to treat late blight and leaf spot.

40|$|Northern bobwhites (Colinus virginianus) {{have been}} declining {{throughout}} their range since the 1960 s. The {{decline in the}} Gulf Prairies and Marshes Ecoregion (GPM) has primarily {{been the result of}} habitat loss and fragmentation. With the population already reduced, additional causes of quail decline become important issues. In 1957, red imported fire ants (RIFA, Solenopsis invicta) began to invade the GPM. RIFA can potentially affect bobwhites by direct predation of pipping chicks, reduced survival of young chicks, and competition for food. Eastern cottontails are another important species that could be impacted by RIFA. Previous work has documented RIFA predation of altricial young born in pen-raised cottontail nests. The Attwater Prairie Chicken National Wildlife Refuge in Colorado County, Texas received large-scale <b>aerial</b> <b>treatment</b> of RIFA with Extinguish Plus? insecticide as a management action for the endangered Attwater?s prairie-chicken (Tympanuchus cupido attwateri). This presented me with an opportunity to evaluate the effects of RIFA treatment on: (1) bobwhite nest success and brood survival, (2) bobwhite abundance and density, (3) bobwhite movements and ranges, and (4) cottontail numbers. An additional objective was to (5) contribute reference data for bobwhite in the GPM to address this region?s lack of data. To investigate these objectives bobwhites were radio-collared and tracked, RIFA were sampled, and cottontails were surveyed in both the treated and non-treated areas. Treatment with Extinguish Plus? successfully reduced the abundance of RIFA in iii the treated area from 2014 ? 2017. However, I found that flooding can negate the effectiveness of the treatment when the treated area is surrounded by adjacent non-treated areas. Bobwhite densities were 76. 6 % higher (P = 0. 042) in the treated area compared to the non-treated area. There was no difference between bobwhite consecutive movements (P = 0. 275) or seasonal ranges (P = 0. 783) in the treated and non-treated area. However, there was a difference (P = < 0. 001) by category. Nesting season females without a brood had larger movements (P = < 0. 001) than nesting season females with a brood and larger movements (P = 0. 002) than pre-nesting females.

The maximum expression of many rapidly (+) -ABA-induced genes occurred prior to peak hormone accumulation, suggesting negative feedback regulation that may be mediated by the induction of genes encoding PP 2 C-type protein phosphatases. For most rapidly (+) -ABA-induced genes, expression was delayed in ABA analog treatments although analogs accumulated to higher levels than did (+) -ABA. For each analog, some genes exhibited a hypersensitive response to the analog and some genes were less sensitive to the analog than to (+) -ABA. Variations in the sensitivity of {{gene expression}} to (+) -ABA and analogs reflect the different structural requirements {{of two or more}} classes of hormone receptors.

Delivered by helicopter, aerial hydromulch has not been rigorously field tested in wildland settings. Concerns have been raised over its ability to reduce watershed erosion along with its potential for negative effects on postfire ecosystem recovery. Since 2007 we have compared sediment fluxes and vegetation regrowth on plots treated with aerial hydromulch versus untreated controls for three wildfires in southern California.

40|$|In {{a series}} of radish plants, with very thin {{hypocotyl}} and with a normal storage organ, the rates of photosynthesis, photorespiration and dark respiration did not differ. Therefore, the conclusion may be advanced, that translocation to the swollen hypocotyl is not determinated by the photosynthetic productivity, but rather the by storage capacity. To check it this is connected with an unbalanced hormonal content, plants were treated with lanoline paste, with IAA, GA 3, zeatin and all three in mixture or with injections of GA 3 -water solution into the swollen hypocotyl. In young radish plants, with high {{rate of growth of}} <b>aerial</b> parts, <b>treatment</b> with the above mentioned substances stimulated 14 CO 2 -assimilation and increased retention of assimilates in 14 C-donors, probably owing to retardation of their senescence. It increased the competition for photosynthates between shoot and storage organ. In older plants, in the stage of accumulation of nutrients in the swollen hypocotyl, IAA +GA 3 +zeatin did not affect 14 CO 2 -assimilation, but in plants treated with growth regulators separately, assimilation decreased; IAA and GA 3 stimulated transport and accumulation of labelled substances in the swollen hypocotyl. On the basis of experimental data the conclusion may be advanced that responsiveness of the particular organs and processes to growth regulators depends on the stage of plant development.

These methods were: 1) imazapic herbicide application (140 g ai ∙ ha‐ 1, 210 g ai ∙ ha‐ 1, and no application [control]), 2) vegetation manipulation treatments (50 % sagebrush overstory thinning, 100 % sagebrush overstory thinning, sagebrush overstory and/or vegetative thatch burning, and no manipulation [control]), and 3) alternative seeding <b>treatments</b> (<b>aerial</b> seeding with raking, aerial seeding with activated carbon [AC] addition, aerial seeding with sucrose addition, and regular <b>aerial</b> seeding [control]). <b>Treatments</b> were arranged in 3 ‐way factorial designs, which allowed main effects and interactions between treatments to be assessed. Responses were followed for two growing seasons following treatment. Main effects of treatments and their interactions on cheatgrass metrics are described in Chapter 2. Herbicide reduced cheatgrass weights and tiller and spikelet numbers in 2009, but these variables were greater than in no‐herbicide plots in 2010. Burning decreased cheatgrass densities but increased weights and tiller and spikelet numbers in both years. One hundred percent sagebrush thinning resulted in greater cheatgrass weights and tiller and spikelet numbers in both years and greater densities in 2010. Sucrose addition decreased cheatgrass weights and tiller and spikelet numbers in 2009, but increased these variables in 2010. An interaction between AC and herbicide treatment was observed, with AC potentially sequestering and lessening the negative effect of herbicide on cheatgrass. Aerial seeding with raking and 50 % sagebrush thinning treatments were not found to significantly affect cheatgrass either year. The effects of treatments (herbicide, 50 % sagebrush thinning, aerial seeding on snow, and aerial seeding with raking treatments omitted) on soil nutrient availabilities are described in Chapter 3.

Economics of alternative vegetation management treatments were analyzed in this thesis {{on the basis of}} two journal papers. Six research sites established and managed by Vegetation Management Alternatives Program of Ontario were the sources of data. In the first paper, differences in stem quality, and volume and value of fibre produced by planted white spruce [Picea glauca (Moench) Voss] 16 years after vegetation management treatments in northwestern Ontario were examined. Forest Vegetation Simulator (FVSOntario) was used to pro-ject the total and merchantable volume to age 70 and BUCK- 2 was used to opti-mize the resulting product mix. Projected value was based on 2009 prices for hog fuel and SPF (spruce-pine-fir) eastern green lumber prices. At 16 years post-treat-ment, gross total volumes in herbicide-treated and mechanically cut plots were significantly higher (120 - 165 % and 94 - 98 %, respectively) than that in control plots (14. 73 m 3 ha- 1). Based on height, diameter, and taper criteria, observed tree quality did not differ among treatments. The projected value of the fibre produced was 36 to 53 % higher in herbicide-treated plots and 24 to 37 % higher in mechanically cut plots than in control plots ($ 18, 486. 76 ha- 1).

Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 56 - 61). x, 61 leaves, bound ill. 29 cmIn Hawaii, fountain grass (Pennisetum setaceum) is an aggressive, fire prone invader that out-competes native {{flora and}} forms monotypic stands with {{large amounts of}} dead mass that fuels fires. Wildfires eliminate native dry forest species and contribute to further spread of alien grasses, creating a grass/fire cycle. The presence of a fountain grass seed bank can increase {{the possibility of the}} reestablishment of this alien grass. Meanwhile, restoration efforts can benefit from the presence of native seeds in the seed bank. The goals of this study were: 1. to test the basic germination requirements of P. setaceum 2. to determine the seed bank composition in a degraded dry forest site, 3. to test the effectiveness of prescribed fire and large-scale <b>aerial</b> herbicide <b>treatment</b> in removing/suppressing fountain grass seed banks. Laboratory germination trials showed that P. setaceum does not require light for germination and seedlings can emerge from at least 5 cm soil depths. However, awns on the dispersal unit imply fountain grass may form predominantly surface layer seed banks. The soil seed bank at the study site is dominated by non-native species. Of the 23 species germinated from the seed bank, 3 native species and 20 alien species emerged; 3 of the alien species are grasses, 14 are herbaceous weeds, and 3 are woody species. Pennisetum setaceum forms a patchy seed bank with a maximum density of 2040 seeds/m 2. Field and lab tests show that fire and heat, respectively, are effective in killing fountain grass seeds. However, the heterogeneity of lava fields on which fountain grass occurs may provide refugia for seeds during fire events. While not statistically significant, some trends are evident in the data. The P. setaceum seed bank is reduced after the passage of fire, and input of seeds into the seed bank is suppressed by herbicide treatment. The sampling methodology employed is not robust enough to show differences in the seed bank after treatment. Smaller sub plots within the research site may be more appropriate to show treatment effects. Given the paucity of native species present in the seed bank, native seed augmentation will be necessary for restoration...|$|R

The formal test of whether these effects can be reversed has been limited so far to measuring differences between small fenced and unfenced plots, in which deer density is either zero or present. We are investigating whether effects of reducing deer density that are predicted from plot-scale results are observed at an operational scale of approximately 4, 000 ha in four forests (block-scale), using an adaptive management framework. In scaling up we face spatial heterogeneity in application of the <b>treatment</b> (<b>aerial</b> and ground shooting) that means deer density is a response variable rather than the independent variable. Additionally, the plant sampling needed to detect differences between treated and untreated blocks is not obvious, so we reviewed the range of effects measured at plot scale to provide starting points for predictions. The four forests differ in deer species and plant communities, raising {{the question of whether}} they are replicates or cases. Designs that minimise confounding effects of other mammals carried little conviction with some stakeholders. These four early challenges show that testing predictions at a management scale is not equivalent to a scaled-up experiment and may not measure up to the epistemological standard of repeatability. On the credit side, managers value the development of site-specific models and the opportunity for constructive debate in the future based on better knowledge of each site...|$|R

Saltcedar density was used to determine the effectiveness of treatments. All treatments with the exception of Treatment 2 resulted in significant saltcedar mortality compared to the control (Treatment 1). Treatment 6 was determined to be the best treatment for control of saltcedar in this study. Treatment 6 provided the highest mortality of all treatments (93. 8 ? 2. 2 %) and lowest variability. Herbicide treatment showed no significant effect on vegetation cover. Vegetation changes that occurred were due to drought conditions. No effect on soil salinity was found following treatment of saltcedar. Average electrical conductivity of the saturated paste extract (mmhos/cm) increased from pre-treatment to one and two years post-treatment periods for 0 to 5 cm depth, but cannot be attributed to control of saltcedar. Water quality was characterized by current and historical electrical conductivity (EC) data. Electrical conductivity from Red Bluff to Girvin doubled in concentration for current and historical data. A trend toward decreasing EC in the Pecos River appears to be occurring. However, at this time the decrease cannot be attributed to control of saltcedar. Water quantity was characterized by historical release and delivery data from the Red Bluff Power Control District. Losses occurring during release and delivery from Red Bluff to irrigation districts are influenced by evaporation by riparian vegetation and from the river and accuracy of release and delivery. Water levels and delivery appear to be influenced by seasonal release from Red Bluff and by the level of a shallow water table underneath the river. The highest average percent loss (67 %) occurs during the first month of release for the average delivery year. This indicates that during the irrigation off-season the water table drops and during the first month of release, recharge occurs. Average percent loss decreases to 39 % during the growing season, indicating that the water table is recharged. Late season average percent loss increases to 43 % following low releases that allow the water table to retreat...|$|R
40|$|While {{locust control}} is {{necessary}} to avoid {{the high cost of}} locust damage to agriculture, land managers are increasingly seeking to minimize the environmental impact of pesticide spray treatments used. The comparative impacts of different locust control treatments on non-target arid zone fauna are rarely studied in the field, leading to uncertainty as to which treatments represent the lowest hazard to the sprayed ecosystems. A phenyl pyrazole pesticide, fipronil, and a fungal biopesticide, Metarhizium acridum (Green Guard®) were applied aerially in either a barrier or blanket ULV treatment at replicated sites which mimicked the techniques employed for locust control operations in Australia. Effects of the two pesticide treatments were compared in the absence of dense locust populations. We measured the abundance and community composition of non-target arid-zone arthropods at control and treatment sites before and after pesticide applications using a large field-based pitfall trapping experiment. Arthropod community composition was not significantly affected over time by either locust control treatment. However, significant short-term times × treatment interactions were found for 6 of 11 most common taxa at family or higher taxonomic level (collembolans, acarians, coleopterans, psocopterans, gryllids, and dipterans). We also compared unsprayed and sprayed areas within fipronil and Metarhizium treatment sites, and found 2 of the 10 most common ant species (Formicidae: Rhytidoponera mayri and Iridomyrmex purpureus) showed significant time × treatment interactions for fipronil but none for Metarhizium, indicating that ants were more severely affected by fipronil within sites than between the three treatments. One year post-treatment, significant time × treatment interactions persisted for only two taxa (dipterans and blattodeans) at Metarhizium treatments, indicating full recovery of most taxa. The suppression of the ant R. mayri in fipronil sprayed areas within treatment sites persisted after one year, while I. purpureus had fully recovered. Relative arthropod abundance and community assemblage changed over time in control and treatment sites, probably reflecting changes in patterns of local rainfall over the study period. Most of the statistically significant treatment effects recorded for different taxa in our study were not long lasting, suggesting that the two locust control methods studied represent a relatively low and transient hazard to most arthropod taxa. The pronounced temporal variation in arthropod abundance across all sites indicated that climate and environmental factors are likely to be stronger drivers of arid zone arthropod abundance and community structure than single aerial applications of low-dose <b>aerial</b> pesticide <b>treatments</b> used to control locusts in arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. 11 page(s...|$|R

This study firstly used remotely sensed data to evaluate glyphosate efficacy on weeds applied with conventional and emerging aerial spray nozzles. A weedy field {{was set up in}} three blocks and four <b>aerial</b> spray technology <b>treatments</b> were tested. Spectral reflectance measurements were taken using ground-based sensors from all the plots at 1, 8, and 17 days after treatment. The results indicated that the differences among the treatments could be detected with spectral data. This study could provide applicators with guidance equipment configurations that can result in herbicide savings and optimized applications in other crops. The main focus of this research was to apply sensor fusion technology to ground-based and airborne imagery data. Experimental plots cropped with cotton and soybean plants were set up with different nitrogen application rates. The multispectral imagery was acquired by an airborne imaging system over crop field; at the same period, leaf chlorophyll content and spectral reflectance measurements were gathered with chlorophyll meter and spectroradiometer at canopy level on the ground, respectively. Statistical analyses were applied on the data from individual sensor for discrimination with respect to the nitrogen treatment levels. Multisensor data fusion was performed at data level. The results showed that the data fusion of airborne imagery with ground-based data were capable of improving the performance of remote sensing data on detection of crop nitrogen status. The method may be extended to other types of data, and data fusion can be performed at feature or decision level...|$|R
