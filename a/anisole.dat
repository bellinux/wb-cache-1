40|$|The {{substituent}} {{effects on}} O-H and O-CH 3 bond dissociation energies {{for a series}} of 18 para-substituted phenols (p-XC(6) H(4) OH) and 11 para-substituted <b>anisoles</b> have been studied using the density functional method {{in order to understand the}} origin of these effects. The calculated substituent effects agree well with experimental measurements for phenols but are substantially larger than the reported values for <b>anisoles.</b> Both ground-state effect and radical effect contribute significantly to the overall substituent effect. An electron-donating group causes a destabilization in phenols or <b>anisoles</b> (ground-state effect) but a stabilization in the phenoxy radicals (radical effect), resulting in reduced O-R bond dissociation energy. An electron-withdrawing group has the opposite effect. In most cases, the radical effect is more important than the ground-state effect. There is a good correlation between the calculated radical effects and calculated variations in charge and spin density on the phenoxy oxygen. This supports the concept that both polar and spin delocalization effects influence the stability of the phenoxy radical. While almost every para-substituent causes a stabilization of the phenoxy radical by spin delocalization, electron-donating groups stabilize and electron-withdrawing groups destabilize the phenoxy radical by the polar effect...|$|R

25|$|The {{solution}} of metal in ammonia provides electrons which are {{taken up by}} the aromatic ring to form the corresponding radical anion B in the first step of the reaction. This is followed by protonation by the alcohol to form a cyclohexadienyl radical C. Next, a second electron is transferred to the radical to form a cyclohexadienyl carbanion D. In the last step a second proton leads the cyclohexadienyl carbanion to the unconjugated cyclohexadienyl product. These steps are outlined below for the case of <b>anisole.</b>|$|E
40|$|A novel {{method for}} regioselective {{oxidation}} of phenols and <b>anisoles</b> {{has been developed}} in which dioxiranes, generated in situ from ketones and Oxone, oxidize phenol derivatives in an intramolecular fashion.

In a homogeneous solvent system of CH 3 CN and H 2 O, oxidation of phenol derivatives 1 - 10 afforded spiro 2 -hydroxydienones in 24 - 55 % yields regardless {{of the presence of}} other substituents (ortho Me, meta Me or Br) on the aryl ring and the length of the linker.

40|$|The {{catalytic}} conversion of suspended LignoBoost Kraft lignin {{was performed in}} near-critical water using ZrO 2 /K 2 CO 3 as the catalytic system and phenol as the co-solvent and char suppressing agent. The reaction temperature was varied from 290 to 370 degrees C {{and its effect on}} the process was investigated in a continuous flow (1 kg/h). The yields of water-soluble organics (WSO), bio-oil and char (dry lignin basis) were in the ranges of 5 - 11 %, 69 - 87 % and 16 - 22 %, respectively. The bio-oil, being partially deoxygenated, exhibited higher carbon content and heat value, but lower sulphur content than lignin. The main 1 -ring aromatics (in WSO and diethylether-soluble bio-oil) were <b>anisoles,</b> alkylphenols, catechols and guaiacols. The results show that increasing temperature increases the yield of 1 -ring aromatics remarkably, while it increases the formation of char moderately. An increase in the yields of <b>anisoles,</b> alkylphenols and catechols, together with a decrease in the yield of guaiacols, was also observed...|$|R
25|$|Then in 1990 and 1993 {{a method}} was finally devised to {{experimentally}} assess whether the <b>anisole</b> and toluene radical anion protonated ortho or meta. The esoteric method {{began with the}} premise that the isotope selectivity in protonation in a protium–deuterium medium would be greater for the radical anion, of the first protonation step, than for the carbanion of the penultimate step. The reasoning was that carbanions are much more basic than the corresponding radical anions and thus will react more exothermically and less selectively in protonation. Experimentally it was determined that less deuterium at the ortho site than meta resulted (1:7) for a variety of methoxylated aromatics. This is a consequence of the greater selectivity of the radical anion protonation. Computations (e.g. ROHF/6-31g) of the electron densities concurred with the experimental observations. Also, it was ascertained that frontier orbital densities did not, and these had been used in some previous reports.|$|E

40|$|Studies of the {{kinetics}} of ion-molecule reactions {{associated with}} isobutane chemical-ionization mass spectrometry {{have shown that}} many of these reactions proceed via the formation of a collision complex which undergoes either unimolecular decomposition to reactants, or collision-induced decomposition to products. Rate constants for the formation of collision complexes between isobutane reactant ions and various ketones, nitriles, alcohols, and <b>anisoles</b> were obtained. Comparisons between these rate constants and collision frequencies calculated from the Average-Dipole-Orientation theory showed that, in general, the reactions proceeded with efficiencies less than unity. The lifetimes of most of the collision complexes were found to lie in the range 1 - 10 Psec. The relative efficiencies with which several compounds effected the collision-induced decomposition of the complex suggested that the third-body efficiencies were determined by the collision duration. Charge - transfer reactions between the isobutane reactant ions and <b>anisoles</b> occur by a direct mechanism. The magnitude of the rate constants for the formation of collision complexes were related to the structures of the compounds under study. For the reactions of certain reactant ions with the <b>anisoles</b> and halohydrins the rate constants were correlated with the appropriate substituent constants. It was suggested that differences between the mechanism proposed herein and that proposed by Field for the reaction between C 4 Hg+ and benzyl acetate were due to differences in sample-pressure ranges.

The results {{obtained from the}} experimental approach revealed that the trend for the inhibitory potentials of the three <b>anisoles</b> is HMBA> MBDAC> MBA.

It is {{observed that the}} SBF/RER ratio is significantly influenced by {{the position of the}} substituent on the aromatic ring. As a rule, phenols and <b>anisoles</b> substituted by an alkyl group in meta position lead to more abundant methylene- 2, 4 -cyclohexadiene cations (RER fragmentation) than their ortho and para homologues. This 'meta effect' is explained on the basis of energetic and kinetic of the two reaction channels. Quantum chemistry computations have been used to provide estimate of the thermochemistry associated with these two fragmentation routes. G 3 B 3 calculation shows that a hydroxy or a methoxy group in the meta position destabilises the SBF and stabilises the RER product ions. Modelling of the SBF/RER intensities ratio has been performed assuming two single reaction rates for both fragmentation processes and computing them within the statistical RRKM formalism in the case of ortho, meta and para butyl phenols. It is clearly demonstrated that, combining thermochemistry and kinetics, the inequality (SBF/RER) (meta) <[*](SBF/RER) (ortho) <[*](SBF/RER) (para) holds for the butyl phenols series.

The reactions with the substituted <b>anisoles</b> require not only multiple C[BOND]H bond activation but also cleavage of the Me[BOND]OAr bond and the reversible formation of a C[BOND]C bond (as revealed by 13 C labeling studies). Equilibria between the two tautomeric structures of these complexes were achieved by prolonged heating at temperatures between 100 and 140 [*]°C, with interconversion of isomeric complexes requiring inversion of the metal configuration, {{as well as the}} expected migratory insertion and hydrogen-elimination reactions. This proposal is supported by a detailed computational exploration of the mechanism at the quantum mechanics (QM) level in the real system. For all compounds investigated, the equilibria favor the alkylidene structure over the olefinic isomer by a factor of between approximately 1 and 25.
