Identifying the loci of advantageous genes is a key step in breeding crops that are optimized for greater yield, cost-efficiency, quality, and disease resistance. For example, one genome wide association study conducted on 517 rice landraces revealed 80 loci associated with several categories of <b>agronomic</b> <b>performance,</b> such as grain weight, amylose content, and drought tolerance. Many of the loci were previously uncharacterized. Not only is this methodology powerful, it is also quick. Previous methods of identifying loci associated with <b>agronomic</b> <b>performance</b> required several generations of carefully monitored breeding of parent strains, a time consuming effort that is unnecessary for comparative genomic studies.|$|E
40|$|Glyphosate is {{the most}} widely used {{herbicide}} for its low cost and high efficiency. However, it is rarely applied directly in rice field due to its toxicity to rice. Therefore, glyphosate-tolerant rice can greatly decrease the cost of rice production and provide a more effective weed management strategy. Although several approaches to develop transgenic rice with glyphosate tolerance have been reported, the <b>agronomic</b> <b>performances</b> of these plants have not been well evaluated, and the feasibility of commercial production has not been confirmed yet. Here, a novel glyphosate-tolerant gene cloned from the bacterium Isoptericola variabilis was identified, codon optimized (designated as I. variabilis-EPSPS*), and transferred into Zhonghua 11, a widely used japonica rice cultivar. After systematic analysis of the transgene integration via PCR, Southern blot and flanking sequence isolation, three transgenic lines with only one intact I. variabilis-EPSPS* expression cassette integrated into intergenic regions were identified. Seed test results showed that the glyphosate tolerance of the transgenic rice was about 240 times that of wild type on plant medium. The glyphosate tolerance of transgenic rice lines was further evaluated based on comprehensive <b>agronomic</b> <b>performances</b> in the field with T 3 and T 5 generations in a two-year assay, which showed that they were rarely affected by glyphosate even when the dosage was 8400 g ha- 1. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of the development of glyphosate-tolerant rice lines based on a comprehensive analysis of <b>agronomic</b> <b>performances</b> in the field. Taken together, the results suggest that the selected glyphosate-tolerant rice lines are highly tolerant to glyphosate and have the possibility of commercial release. I. variabilis-EPSPS* also can be a promising candidate gene in other species for developing glyphosate-tolerant crops...|$|R

40|$|Protein {{quality of}} {{standard}} maize kernels is poor, {{due to the}} low levels of two essential aminoacids - lysine and tryptophan. The opaque 2 mutation which increases lysine and tryptophan content also confers an undesirable phenotype leading to low yields, soft and chalky kernels that renders seeds susceptible to storage pest and ear rots. Quality protein maize (QPM) is the maize with increased levels of these amino acids and good <b>agronomic</b> <b>performances.</b> At the Maize Research Institute, a program on creating QPM germplasm developed for conditions of temperate climatic zone is in progress. The {{aim of this study}} was to test quality traits of F 2 kernels derived from the crosses between 24 QPM inbred lines with three standard inbred lines and two opaque 2 lines. Most of the analyzed 108 genotypes had tryptophan content under the threshold of 0. 075 set for QPM (83. 5 %). However, 50 % had elevated tryptophan content in the range from 0. 065 to 0. 074. High tryptophan content was found in 16. 5 % of the analyzed genotypes, the highest being 0. 088. Only one genotype had quality index over 0. 80 (threshold for QPM). Biochemical analysis identified genotypes with good protein quality which will be further tested for <b>agronomic</b> <b>performances</b> in order to potentially be considered as QPM hybrids. ...|$|R

This concern contrasts with the reason why these sterile plants were developed, which was to prevent the transfer of genes to the environment by preventing any plants that are bred with or that receive these genes from reproducing.

40|$|In {{the past}} decades {{genetics}} was studied intensively {{leading to the}} knowledge that DNA is the molecule behind genetic inheritance and starting from the new millennium next-generation sequencing methods {{made it possible to}} sample this DNA with an ever decreasing cost. Animal and plant breeders have always made use of genetic information to predict <b>agronomic</b> <b>performance</b> of new breeds. While this genetic information previously was gathered from the pedigree of the population under study, genomic information of the DNA makes it possible to also deduce correlations between individuals that do not share any known ancestors leading to so-called genomic prediction of <b>agronomic</b> <b>performance.</b> Nowadays, the number of informative samples that can be taken from a genome ranges from one thousand to one million. Using all this information in a breeding context where <b>agronomic</b> <b>performance</b> is predicted and optimized for different environmental conditions is not a straightforward task. Moreover, the number of individuals for which this information is available keeps on growing and thus sophisticated computational methods are required for analyzing these large scale genomic data sets.

Following a 3 -year experiment in Grignon, a specific experiment was set up in 2013, to investigate more in detail the effect of nitrogen fertilization and sowing dates, found in previous years to have an impact on the control of STB with species mixtures. Treatments were: wheat (250 pl. m- 2) sown at 2 dates (S 1 : 15 / 10 / 2013, S 2 : 15 / 11 / 2013) and fertilized at 2 rates (N 1 pea-wheat balance rate: 60 kg N ha- 1, N 2 wheat balance rate: 190 kg N ha- 1, three applications), and pea-wheat mixture (125 pl m- 2 wheat; 40 pl m- 2 pea) sown at 2 dates (S 1, S 2) and fertilized at 3 rates (N 0 : 0 kg N ha- 1, N 1, N 2). Diseased surfaces and senescence surface were assessed weekly from April 23 th to July 23 th. Meteorological data and crop relative humidity, biomass and nitrogen nutrition index (NNI) at flowering, and biomass and yields at harvest, were also assessed. Due to high rain during the epidemic season, the disease pressure was high, leading to high infection for all wheat and pea-wheat treatments. The nitrogen fertilization increased the disease severity for wheat and pea-wheat treatments, whereas the S 2 sowing date led to a slight increase compared to S 1. Pea-wheat mixture led to a slight decrease in the disease severity compared to wheat. On the one hand, the barrier effect occurs due to the pea (non-host of the STB) but on the other hand, the observed increase of the relative humidity in pea-wheat mixture compared to wheat may favor the infection and sporulation of the disease. Concerning <b>agronomic</b> <b>performances,</b> the NNI was higher in pea-wheat compared to wheat, and the mean wheat yield in mixture (57 q ha- 1) was higher than half-mean yield of the sole wheat (73 q ha- 1), confirming the interest of pea-wheat mixtures in terms of nitrogen nutrition and yield.
