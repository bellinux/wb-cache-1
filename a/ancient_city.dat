The game is set across several locations on the fictional Mount Olympus, including the Tomb of Ares, the <b>ancient</b> <b>city</b> of Olympia, the Path of Eos, the Labyrinth, several areas of the Palace of the Gods, such as the Forum and Hera's Gardens, and the Underworld and Tartarus.|$|E
5|$|Coventry is an <b>ancient</b> <b>city</b> and a {{metropolitan}} borough in the West Midlands of England. The city's history {{dates back to}} at least the 11thcentury (CE), and by the 14thcentury, it was a thriving centre of commerce. Like several of the other monuments in the city, Coventry's city walls were erected {{towards the end of}} the 14th and the beginning of the 15thcenturies, though city walls served little defensive purpose by that time and were largely a status symbol.|$|E

5|$|Olga Tufnell (26 January 1905 – 11 April 1985) was a British {{archaeologist}} who assisted on {{the excavation}} of the <b>ancient</b> <b>city</b> of Lachish in the 1930s.

Olga then went on to join James Leslie Starkey in the expedition to find Lachish in 1929 and remained part of the team for the following seasons.|$|E

The Polonnaruwa Vatadage, which occupies most of the south western area of it, is a prominent structure among them. It is the best preserved example of a Vatadage in the country, and is somewhat similar in design to those belonging to the Anuradhapura period, especially Thuparamaya and Lankaramaya.|$|E
5|$|The <b>ancient</b> <b>city</b> of Sarapion is {{believed}} to have been the predecessor state of Mogadishu. It is mentioned in the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea, a Greek travel document dating from the first century AD, as one of a series of commercial ports on the Somali littoral. According to the Periplus, maritime trade already connected peoples in the Mogadishu area with other communities along the Indian Ocean coast.|$|E
5|$|The {{residents}} of the <b>ancient</b> <b>city</b> of Jeitun, which dates to 6000 BC, kept sheep and goats as their primary livestock. There have also been numerous identifications of Nomadic pastoralism in archaeological sites, identified by a prevalence of sheep and goat bones, a lack of grain or grain-processing equipment, very limited architecture showing a set of characteristic traits, a location outside the region's zone of agriculture, and ethnographic analogy to modern nomadic pastoral peoples.|$|E

5|$|A further {{elaboration}} on {{this story}} is possibly found in a chronicle of Wincenty Kadłubek written some three centuries later. The chronicler, inadvertently or intentionally mixing different historic eras, talks of a past Polish war with the army of Alexander the Great. The countless enemy soldiers thrust their way into Poland, and the king himself, having previously subjugated the Pannonians, entered through Moravia {{as if it were}} a back door. He victoriously unfolded the wings of his forces and conquered the Kraków area lands and Silesia, in the process leveling Kraków's <b>ancient</b> <b>city</b> walls. The evidence of a dozen or more gords attacked and destroyed in southern Lesser Poland at the end of 9th century lends some archeological credence to this fanciful version of events.|$|E

5|$|In 1932, Starkey secured {{funding from}} Charles Marston and Henry Wellcome {{to start an}} {{expedition}} apart from the Petries, which Olga joined. The Wellcome-Marston expedition was {{to focus on the}} excavation of the <b>ancient</b> <b>city</b> of Lachish, a stronghold mentioned in the Bible. Over the next six years, the team made some important finds, including the Lachish letters, but the work was interrupted by the murder of Starkey, while he was en route to the opening of the Rockefeller Museum in Jerusalem. The remaining team finished during the 1938/9 season, then closed the site. Olga wrote the final report.|$|E
5|$|In {{the post-war}} years, {{the city walls}} shaped the route of Canterbury's modern ring road system, {{protecting}} the inner core of the <b>ancient</b> <b>city,</b> despite proposals under the Holden Plan of 1945 for a radical reshaping of the city's road network. During the 1950s, a stretch of Canterbury's walls were reconstructed, including two circular towers, {{as part of the}} redevelopment of the St George district. In the early 1980s, the volume of traffic around the West Gate was causing damage to the structure of the building. The remaining walls and West Gate are protected under UK law as scheduled monuments and as a Grade I listed building.|$|E
