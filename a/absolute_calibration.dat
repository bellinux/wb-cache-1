The MODIS instrument has high calibration accuracy and can track its own radiometric changes due to the inclusion of an onboard calibration system for the VIS/NIR spectral region MCST. The following method utilizes the high accuracy of MODIS to absolutely calibrate AVHRRs via simultaneous nadir overpasses (SNOs) of both MODIS/AVHRR and AVHRR/AVHRR satellite pairs as well as MODIS-characterized surface reflectances for a Libyan Desert target and Dome-C in Antarctica et al., 2010. Ultimately, each individual calibration event available (MODIS/AVHRR SNO, Dome C, Libyan Desert, or AVHRR/AVHRR SNO) is used to provide a calibration slope time series for a given AVHRR sensor.

50|$|The camera {{consisted}} of a catadioptric lens which focused on a mechanically cooled (to a temperature of 70 K) Amber InSb CCD focal-plane array with a bandpass of 1100 - 2800 nm and a six-position filter wheel. The filter center wavelengths (and bandpass widths (FWHM)) were: 1100 nm (60 nm), 1250 nm (60 nm), 1500 nm (60 nm), 2000 nm (60 nm), 2600 nm (60 nm), and 2780 nm (120 nm). The aperture was 29 mm with a focal length of 96 mm. The field of view was 5.6 &times; 5.6 degrees, giving a cross-track width of about 40 km at a nominal 400 km lunar altitude. The Moon had complete mapping coverage during the two-month lunar phase of the mission. The image array is 256 &times; 256 pixels, and pixel resolution varied from 150 - 500 m during a single orbit mapping run at the Moon. (At Geographos the pixel resolution would have been 40 m at closest approach, giving an image size about 10 &times; 10 km.) The camera took twelve images in each 1.3 s image burst, which occurred 75 times over the 80 minute mapping span during each five hour lunar orbit. The dynamic range was 15,000. The signal-to-noise ratio varied from 11 - 97 depending on the surface albedo and phase angle, with a relative calibration of 1% and an <b>absolute</b> <b>calibration</b> of 30%.

40|$|As {{the core}} and {{foundation}} of quantitative remote sensing, the precision of on-orbit radiometric calibration of spaceborne sensor directly determines the quality of quantitative remote sensing production. However, the available radiometric calibration methods {{have been unable to}} achieve the <b>absolute</b> radiometric <b>calibration</b> of each camera and the relative radiometric correction among cameras simultaneously for multi-camera mosaic imaging sensor. Therefore,taking wide field of view(WFV) multispectral sensor equipped with GF- 1 satellite as example,this research proposes an innovative on-orbit radiometric calibration method based on the modified radiometric block adjustment. First,the radiometric control points of each WFV camera are extracted using the traditional cross calibration method.

At last,the integrate adjustment method is used to calculate the calibration coefficients of each WFV camera and the parameters of radiometric constraint equation considering the coupling relationship between the relative radiometric correction and the <b>absolute</b> radiometric <b>calibration.</b> The experimental results show the relative errors of the <b>absolute</b> radiometric <b>calibration</b> coefficients in each band are all less 9. 34 %.

The CCD was a frame transfer device which allowed three gain states (150, 350, and 1000 electrons/bit). Integration times varied from 1 - 40 ms depending on gain state, solar illumination angle, and filter.
