500|$|Meat Loaf {{says that}} he does not enjoy {{recording}} in studios. He compares the process to [...] "going to the dentist and having root canal everyday". Whereas you really have to be flat for people to notice it in a live show, in a studio, every [...] "nuance is under a microscope... and I'm a perfectionist who knows that there's no such thing as perfection but I try to get <b>as</b> <b>close</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> can." ...|$|E
500|$|The animators and {{character}} designers {{had a lot}} of discussion about what Frank Grimes should look like. He was originally designed as a [...] "burly ex-marine guy with a crew cut", but would later be modeled after Michael Douglas in the movie Falling Down and director Jim Reardon's college roommate. Hank Azaria provided the voice of Frank Grimes, even though such a role would normally have been performed by a guest star. The producers decided Azaria was more suitable because the role involved a great deal of frustration and required extensive knowledge of the show. Azaria felt that the role should instead go to William H. Macy. According to Azaria, [...] "I based the character on William Macy. I can't really copy him vocally, but I tried to get <b>as</b> <b>close</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> could and copy his rhythms and the way he has that sort of seething passion underneath that total calm exterior." [...] The producers worked a lot with Azaria to help him perfect the role, and gave him more guidance than they normally would. Azaria felt that it was the role he worked hardest on, adding [...] "I think it's the one we did the most takes on, the most emotional, it felt like the one I worked on the hardest from a performance point of view, in preparation and in execution." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{search of}} a record-tying third {{consecutive}} Open Championship, Woods fell out of contention with a second-round 75, and never mounted a charge over the weekend. Although his putting was solid (he sank a 90-footer in the first round), his iron play held him back. [...] "I wasn't hitting the ball <b>as</b> <b>close</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> needed to all week," [...] he said, after he finished tied for twelfth, five strokes off the pace.|$|E
2500|$|Then-Chief Justice Rehnquist said White [...] "came <b>as</b> <b>close</b> <b>as</b> anyone <b>I</b> {{have known}} to meriting Matthew Arnold's {{description}} of Sophocles: 'He saw life steadily {{and he saw}} it whole.' All of us who served with him will miss him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Lord, sister," [...] {{answered}} the younger Miss Ilderton, [...] "what could I do with so frightful a monster? I kept my eyes shut, after once glancing at him; and, I protest, I thought I saw him still, though <b>I</b> winked <b>as</b> <b>close</b> <b>as</b> ever <b>I</b> could." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have seen}} {{enough of the}} one," [...] said Mr. Fay, [...] "and shall see enough of the other if I live to be <b>as</b> near its <b>close</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> am to its birth." ...|$|R
2500|$|People with anxious-preoccupied {{attachment}} type tend {{to agree}} with the following statements: [...] "I want to be completely emotionally intimate with others, but I often find that others are reluctant to get <b>as</b> <b>close</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> would like", and [...] "I am uncomfortable being without close relationships, but I sometimes worry that others don't value me as much as I value them." [...] People with this style of attachment seek high levels of intimacy, approval, and responsiveness from their attachment figure. They sometimes value intimacy {{to such an extent that}} they become overly dependent on the attachment figure. Compared to securely attached people, people who are anxious or preoccupied with attachment tend to have less positive views about themselves. They may feel a sense of anxiousness that only recedes when in contact with the attachment figure. They often doubt their worth as a person and blame themselves for the attachment figure's lack of responsiveness. People who are anxious or preoccupied with attachment may exhibit high levels of emotional expressiveness, emotional dysregulation (ED), worry, and impulsiveness in their relationships.|$|E

6000|$|... "The very {{words you}} said, Nancy Taylor. <b>I</b> was <b>as</b> <b>close</b> to you <b>as</b> <b>I</b> am now, and I heard them. You may have said hut instead of cabin, but in {{substance}} it's the same. And {{you were looking}} pale, too." ...|$|R
60|$|And now I {{began to}} feel that I was {{neglecting}} my business, that since I had been so foolhardy as to come ashore with these desperadoes, the least I could do was to overhear them at their councils, and that my plain and obvious duty was to draw <b>as</b> <b>close</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> could manage, under the favourable ambush of the crouching trees.|$|E
6000|$|... "I mean to run <b>as</b> <b>close</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> can {{round the}} end of the island, and then make for the place where they must have {{embarked}} on the mainland.

6000|$|... "It {{must have}} been a relief to Leslie. But she never said anything. From the day of her {{marriage}} she was just what she is now--cold and proud, and keeping everyone but me at a distance. I won't BE kept at a distance, believe ME! I've just stuck to Leslie <b>as</b> <b>close</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> knew how in spite of everything." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, never mind, mum!" [...] {{said the}} little man. [...] "He mightn't like it, perhaps. There's a small order {{just come in}} for barking dogs; and I should wish to go <b>as</b> <b>close</b> to Natur' <b>as</b> <b>I</b> could for sixpence. That's all. Never mind, mum." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah! tout va au mieux!" [...] was my answer, and Mdlle. Reuter {{ceased to}} {{question}} me; but her eye--not large, not brilliant, not melting, or kindling, but astute, penetrating, practical, showed {{she was even}} with me; it let out a momentary gleam, which said plainly, [...] "Be <b>as</b> <b>close</b> <b>as</b> you like, <b>I</b> am not dependent on your candour; what you would conceal I already know." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Yes, sir!" [...] {{said the}} {{stripling}} with emphasis. [...] "Lew Lucas {{is a hot}} sketch. He used {{to live on the}} next street to me," [...] he added as clinching evidence of his hero's prowess. [...] "I've seen his old mother <b>as</b> <b>close</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> am to you. Say, I seen her a hundred times. Is any stiff of a Bugs Butler going to lick a fellow like that?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But," [...] said I, {{standing}} before {{her in the}} lovely light amid the dwelling dewdrops, [...] "really and truly, Mrs Bowater, it is only going back to its own again. What you call a miggle-maggle is what these things were made to be. They are growing up now by themselves; {{and if you could}} look <b>as</b> <b>close</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> can, you'd see they breathe only what each can spare. They are just racing along to live as wildly as they possibly can. It's the tameness," [...] I expostulated, flinging back my hood, [...] "that would be shocking to me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "However, {{there he}} was, {{with his head}} inside the door, on the girl's {{shoulder}} as likely as not--officer of the watch! The helmsman, on giving his evidence afterwards, said that he shouted several times that the binnacle lamp had gone out. It didn't matter to him, because his orders were to 'sail her close.' 'I thought it funny,' he said, 'that the ship should keep on falling off in squalls, but I luffed her up every time <b>as</b> <b>close</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> was able.

5000|$|Island Records {{was founded}} in Jamaica on 4 July 1959 by Chris Blackwell, Graeme Goodall and Leslie Kong, and {{partially}} financed by Stanley Borden from RKO. Its name {{was inspired by the}} Harry Belafonte song [...] "Island in the Sun". Blackwell explained in 2009: “I loved music so much, I just wanted to get into it, or be <b>as</b> <b>close</b> to it <b>as</b> <b>I</b> could.” ...|$|R
60|$|Much {{discussion}} followed this: Meepo {{urged me}} to go on to Yakla, and leave these bad people; and the Soubah and Dingpun, who had exceeded their orders in laying hands on me, both wished me away. My course was, however, clear as to the propriety of keeping <b>as</b> <b>close</b> to Campbell <b>as</b> <b>I</b> was allowed, so they reluctantly agreed to take me with him to the Durbar.|$|R
5000|$|She {{then worked}} at Publishers Weekly, before {{the demands on}} working on Bolaño's books became full-time. [...] "My reason for going into {{publishing}} {{in the first place}} was that I had decided in college that I would never be a fiction writer, but I knew <b>I</b> wanted to be <b>as</b> <b>close</b> to books <b>as</b> <b>I</b> could. Publishing was one way, and translating {{turned out to be a}} better way for me." ...|$|R

60|$|One day, while lying {{still in}} the {{underbrush}} watching a wood mouse, Killooleet, a fine male bird and a perfect singer, came and sang on a branch just over my head, not noticing me. Then I discovered {{that there is a}} trill, a tiny grace note or yodel, {{at the end of his}} second note. I listened carefully to other singers, <b>as</b> <b>close</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> could get, and found that it is always there, and is the one difficult part of the song. You must be very close to the bird to appreciate the beauty of this little yodel; for ten feet away it sounds like a faint cluck interrupting the flow of the third note; and a little farther away you cannot hear it at all.|$|E
6000|$|... "I shall {{stand in}} <b>as</b> <b>close</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> dare {{and then put}} her round. I shall {{presently}} find means to smuggle {{you out of here}} into the sail-locker, which communicates with the lobby. But there is an opening, a sort of square for hauling the sails out, which gives straight on the quarter-deck and which is never closed in fine weather, so as to give air to the sails. ' When the ship's way is deadened in stays and all the hands are aft at the main-braces you shall have a clear road to slip out and get overboard through the open quarter-deck port. I've had them both fastened up. Use a rope's end to lower yourself into the water so as to avoid a splash--you know. It could be heard and cause some beastly complication." ...|$|E
40|$|Australia’s three native bamboo species – Bambusa arnhemica, Mullerochloa moreheadiana and Neololeba atra – are {{restricted}} to northern Australia. The most parsimonious explanation for the occurrence of bamboo in Australia is {{that there have been}} at least three founder events from Asia, but other possibilities exist including an Australian radiation involving Neololeba and Mullerochloa. Bambusa arnhemica may be allied to the Asian B. blumeana which occurs <b>as</b> <b>close</b> <b>as</b> Timor. <b>I</b> summarise historical evidence and biogeographic patterns for B. arnhemica, and describe the flowering wave phenomenon in the species, evidence which collectively suggests that B. arnhemica is neither very ancient nor very recent in origin. Current studies of the population genetics of B. arnhemica, and of the relationship between Australian and Asian bamboos, may yield fascinating further biogeographic insights...|$|R
60|$|The {{curtains}} {{of his bed}} were drawn aside, I tell you, by a hand. Not the curtains at his feet, nor the curtains at his back, but those to which his face was addressed. The {{curtains of}} his bed were drawn aside; and Scrooge, starting up into a half-recumbent attitude, found himself {{face to face with}} the unearthly visitor who drew them: <b>as</b> <b>close</b> to it <b>as</b> <b>I</b> am now to you, and I am standing in the spirit at your elbow.|$|R
5000|$|... "The {{interesting}} thing about that is - I've never met Sean", said Lazenby. [...] "I don't know him at all. Once, years ago, he came to pick up someone who was staying at my house and I saw him through the door. That's all. But I always admired him. I tried to copy him when I played Bond because, after all, I wasn't an actor so I thought my best chance would be to try and be <b>as</b> <b>close</b> to Connery <b>as</b> <b>I</b> could." ...|$|R
60|$|Now for {{the manner}} of the support. You must all know well the look of the machicolated {{parapets}} in mediæval castles. You know they are carried on rows of small projecting buttresses constructed so that, though the uppermost stone, far-projecting, would break easily under any shock, it is supported by the next below, and so on, down to the wall. Now in this figure I am obliged to separate the feathers by white spaces, to show you them distinctly. In reality they are set as close to each other as can be, but putting them <b>as</b> <b>close</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> can, you get a or b, Fig. 5, for the rough section of the wing, thick towards the bird's head, and curved like a sickle, so that in striking down it catches the air, like a reaping-hook, and in rising up, it throws off the air like a pent-house.|$|E
6000|$|... "About that," [...] Nat said. [...] "It {{was lucky}} they spoke {{when we were}} coming along. I expect they had been {{watching}} for some nights, and hadn't much idea anyone would come, or else they wouldn't have spoken. As it was, it was easy enough to pass them, on such a dark night. Of course, they were looking outside, and I just kept along <b>as</b> <b>close</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> could to the bushes, only just giving a light stroke, now and then, to take her along. Being inside them, I got a sight of 'em some distance away, but I knew they couldn't see us, sharp as their eyes are. The only chance was their hearing, and, as there was no noise for them to hear, I felt safe enough after I had once caught sight of 'em, and saw they were lying out {{at the edge of}} the shadow.|$|E
60|$|I {{was at a}} loss what to do, for I durst {{not return}} to the same landing-place, but stood to the north, and was forced to paddle, for the wind, though very gentle, was against me, blowing north-west. As I was looking about for a secure landing-place, I saw a sail to the north-north-east, which {{appearing}} every minute more visible, I was in some doubt whether I should wait for them or not; but at last my detestation of the Yahoo race prevailed: and turning my canoe, I sailed and paddled together to the south, and got into the same creek whence I set out in the morning, choosing rather to trust myself among these barbarians, than live with European Yahoos. I drew up my canoe <b>as</b> <b>close</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> could to the shore, and hid myself behind a stone by the little brook, which, as I have already said, was excellent water.|$|E
5000|$|Chief United States District Judge Joseph Anderson {{once wrote}} [...] "to say that Matthew Perry was {{good in the}} {{courtroom}} is like saying Mickey Mantle knew how to swing a bat [...] [...] [...] Aristotle taught that lawyers and judges should be the very personification of justice.

5000|$|Phil Harris - Himself. A skirt-chasing, arrogant, hip-talking bandleader who {{constantly}} put Jack down (in {{a mostly}} friendly way, of course).
