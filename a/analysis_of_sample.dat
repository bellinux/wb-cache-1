5000|$|A gender-diverse team is {{more likely}} to produce {{products}} that meet the needs of men and women. When women are underrepresented, many technical decisions are based on the experiences, opinions, and judgments of only men, which can result in products that meet the needs of only men. In addition, a review of research on gender-diverse teams reveals that gender-diverse teams are more productive, more creative, and more able to stay on schedule and within budget, compared to homogenous teams, while other research review suggests that the results are mixed, with many studies showing no result, non-linear results or even negative results of gender diversity on team performances. [...] Research conducted by McKinsey & Company showed that companies with women in top management were more financially successful, in contrast <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> <b>sample</b> major US companies showed no effect of inclusion of women (or minority members) on financial performance, these varied results give no conclusive evidence of the benefits of diversity.|$|E
50|$|EDS {{can be used}} to {{determine}} which chemical elements are present in a sample, and {{can be used to}} estimate their relative abundance. The accuracy of this quantitative <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> <b>sample</b> composition is affected by various factors. Many elements will have overlapping X-ray emission peaks (e.g., Ti Kβ and V Kα, Mn Kβ and Fe Kα). The accuracy of the measured composition is also affected {{by the nature of the}} sample. X-rays are generated by any atom in the sample that is sufficiently excited by the incoming beam. These X-rays are emitted in all directions (isotropically), and so they may not all escape the sample. The likelihood of an X-ray escaping the specimen, and thus being available to detect and measure, depends on the energy of the X-ray and the composition, amount, and density of material it has to pass through to reach the detector. Because of this X-ray absorption effect and similar effects, accurate estimation of the sample composition from the measured X-ray emission spectrum requires the application of quantitative correction procedures, which are sometimes referred to as matrix corrections.|$|E
