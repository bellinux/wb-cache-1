5000|$|In the 1960s, {{the theory}} behind plasma {{cosmology}} was introduced by Alfvén, a plasma expert who won the 1970 Nobel Prize in Physics {{for his work on}} magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). In 1971, Oskar Klein, a Swedish theoretical physicist, extended the earlier proposals and developed the Alfvén-Klein model of the universe, or [...] "metagalaxy", an earlier term used to refer to the empirically accessible part of the universe, rather than the entire universe including parts beyond our particle horizon. In this Alfvén-Klein cosmology, sometimes called Klein-Alfvén cosmology, the universe is made up of equal amounts of matter and antimatter with the boundaries between the regions of matter and antimatter being delineated by cosmic electromagnetic fields formed by double layers, thin regions comprising two parallel layers with opposite electrical charge. Interaction between these boundary regions would generate radiation, and this would form the plasma. Alfvén introduced the term <b>ambiplasma</b> for a plasma made up of matter and antimatter and the double layers are thus formed of <b>ambiplasma.</b> According to Alfvén, such an <b>ambiplasma</b> would be relatively long-lived as the component particles and antiparticles would be too hot and too low-density to annihilate each other rapidly. The double layers will act to repel clouds of opposite type, but combine clouds of the same type, creating ever-larger regions of matter and antimatter. The idea of <b>ambiplasma</b> was developed further into the forms of heavy <b>ambiplasma</b> (protons-antiprotons) and light <b>ambiplasma</b> (electrons-positrons).|$|E
50|$|Other examples, on {{the other}} hand, remain a {{scientific}} dead-end; the existence of interstellar <b>ambiplasma,</b> the possibly fairly recent (<10 000 years) extinction of the woolly mammoth and the so-called science of cymatics.|$|E
5000|$|In 1993, {{theoretical}} cosmologist Jim Peebles criticized Alfvén-Klein cosmology, {{writing that}} [...] "there {{is no way}} that the results can be consistent with the isotropy of the cosmic microwave background radiation and X-ray backgrounds". [...] In his book he also showed that Alfvén's models do not predict Hubble's law, the abundance of light elements, or the existence of the cosmic microwave background. A further difficulty with the <b>ambiplasma</b> model is that matter-antimatter annihilation results in the production of high energy photons, which are not observed in the amounts predicted. While {{it is possible that the}} local [...] "matter-dominated" [...] cell is simply larger than the observable universe, this proposition does not lend itself to observational tests.|$|E
40|$|Plasma {{phenomena}} are {{studied in}} the laboratory, in the magnetospheres, and in more distant astrophysical regions. The basic properties of plasmas {{are likely to be}} the same everywhere but the transfer of knowledge between the regions requires laws of scaling by a factor of up-to 1027 (= ratio between Hubble distance 1028 cm and laboratory dimensions, say 10 cm). Plasma phenomena are complicated and can be understood only {{with the help of a}} very sophisticated diagnostics. Up to recently, diagnostics in the laboratory was best developed and space plasma physics must be based on a flow of knowledge from the laboratory. However, in situ measurements in the magnetospheres (including the heliosphere = the solar magnetosphere) has now reached such a sophistication that in some respects magnetospheric plasma physics is ahead of laboratory plasma physics. Hence the exploration of astrophysical regions (defined as those regions not yet accessable to in situ measurements) must be based on a transfer of knowledge not only from laboratory physics but also from magnetospheric physics. Further, a transfer of knowledge from the magnetospheres to the laboratory may rejuvenate fusion research. Magnetospheric research has demonstrated that there are plasma regions of two different kinds : - passive plasma regions, which can be described by classical hydrodynamic theory. They transmit waves and high energy charged particles but if the field-aligned currents exceed a certain value they are transferred into. - active plasma regions. These carry field-aligned currents which give them a filamentary or sheet structure with thickness down to a few cyclotron radii (ionic or even electronic). They transmit energy from one region to another and produce electric double layers which accelerate particles to high energies. Active regions cannot be described by hydromagnetic theories. Boundary conditions are essential and may be introduced by circuit theory. (Erroneous treatment of boundary conditions is often fatal in magnetic merging theories.) Transfer of knowledge from the laboratory and the magnetospheres is now starting a revolution in astrophysics. For example the theory of formation of the solar system can be based on extrapolation of what is known from magnetospheric and laboratory plasma physics. However, there are two kinds of astrophysically important plasmas which cannot yet be {{studied in the}} laboratory or in the magnetospheres : dusty plasmas, of importance in interstellar clouds, and <b>ambiplasmas</b> (consisting of both matter and antimatter), of importance in the cosmological discussion...|$|R
5000|$|Alfvén-Klein {{cosmology}} {{was proposed}} {{in part to}} explain the observed baryon asymmetry in the universe, starting from an initial condition of exact symmetry between matter and antimatter. According to Alfvén and Klein, <b>ambiplasma</b> would naturally form pockets of matter and pockets of antimatter that would expand outwards as annihilation between matter and antimatter occurred in the double layer at the boundaries. They concluded that we must just happen to {{live in one of}} the pockets that was mostly baryons rather than antibaryons, explaining the baryon asymmetry. The pockets, or bubbles, of matter or antimatter would expand because of annihilations at the boundaries, which Alfvén considered as a possible explanation for the observed expansion of the universe, which would be merely a local phase of a much larger history. Alfvén postulated that the universe has always existed [...] due to causality arguments and the rejection of ex nihilo models, such as the Big Bang, as a stealth form of creationism. The exploding double layer was also suggested by Alfvén as a possible mechanism for the generation of cosmic rays, X-ray bursts and gamma-ray bursts.|$|E
40|$|It {{is shown}} {{that the idea of}} a photon rocket through the {{complete}} annihilation of matter with antimatter, first proposed by Sänger, is not a utopian scheme as it is widely believed. Its feasibility appears to be possible by the radiative collapse of a relativistic high current pinch discharge in a hydrogen-antihydrogen <b>ambiplasma</b> down to a radius determined by Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle. Through this collapse to ultrahigh densities the proton-antiproton pairs {{in the center of the}} pinch can become the upper GeV laser level for the transition into a coherent gamma ray beam by proton-antiproton annihilation, with the magnetic field of the collapsed pinch discharge absorbing the recoil momentum of the beam and transmitting it to the spacecraft. The gamma ray laser beam is launched as a photon avalanche from one end of the pinch discharge channel. The idea of the photon rocket was first proposed by Sänger [1], but at that time considered to be utopian. Sänger showed if matter could be completely converted into photons, and if a mirror can deflect the photons into one direction, then a rocket driven by the recoil from these photons could reach relativistic velocities where the relativistic time dilation and length contraction must be taken into account, makin...|$|E
30|$|Electron–positron–ion (e–p–i) plasma as a {{particular}} case of <b>ambiplasma</b> is a quasineutral space plasma containing electrons, positrons, protons, and antiprotons [1]. In the presence of additional positron component in an ordinary electron–ion plasma, the population of ions {{as well as the}} restoring force on electron fluid reduces, henceforth it can be predict that the basic features of electrostatic structures affect considerably in an e–p–i plasma. Study of propagation of localized structures in e–p–i plasma has important aspects for researches due to existence of such kind of plasma in the inner regions of the accretion disks surrounding black holes [2], in the early universe [3, 4], in pulsar magnetospheres [5], in the active galactic nuclei [6, 7], in the polar regions of neutron stars [8], at the center of our galaxy [9], and in the plasmas in intense laser fields [10, 11]. Such three-component e–p–i plasmas can also be found in the laboratory plasma; for instance, during the propagation of a short relativistic strong laser pulse in matter, photo production of pairs due to the photon scattering by nuclei can lead to the formation of e–p–i plasmas [10, 11]. Collisions of runaway electrons with plasma ions or thermal electrons in tokamaks (which have also been observed in the Joint European Torus [12] and JT- 60 U [13]) can lead to production of protons. Therefore, according to the mentioned reasons during the last few decades the propagation properties of electrostatic structures in e–p–i plasma have been attracted {{a great deal of attention}} [14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24].|$|E
