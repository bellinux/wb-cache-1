5|$|The {{definition}} of a transition metal, <b>as</b> <b>given</b> <b>by</b> IUPAC, is an element whose atom has an incomplete d sub-shell, or which can give rise to cations with an incomplete d sub-shell. By this definition all of the elements in groups 3–11 are transition metals. The IUPAC definition therefore excludes group 12, comprising zinc, cadmium and mercury, from the transition metals category.|$|E
5|$|The {{definition}} of the kelvin will undergo a fundamental change if the proposal is accepted. Rather than using the triple point of water to fix the temperature scale the proposal recommends that the energy equivalent <b>as</b> <b>given</b> <b>by</b> Boltzmann's equation be used.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{commentators}} of Thucydides, {{with other}} modern historians and writers, take varying stances {{on the issue}} of how much of the speeches of Pericles, <b>as</b> <b>given</b> <b>by</b> this historian, do actually represent Pericles' own words and how much of them is free literary creation or paraphrase by Thucydides. Since Pericles never wrote down or distributed his orations, no historians are able to answer this with certainty; Thucydides recreated three of them from memory and, thereby, it cannot be ascertained that he did not add his own notions and thoughts.|$|E

5|$|A book {{published}} in November 2011, Seal Target Geronimo, by Chuck Pfarrer, a former SEAL, contradicted the account <b>as</b> <b>given</b> <b>by</b> U.S. government sources. According to Pfarrer, neither helicopter crashed {{at the beginning}} of the raid. Instead, the SEALs jumped onto the roof from the hovering Razor 1 helicopter and entered a third-floor hallway from the roof terrace. Osama's third wife, Khairah, was in the hallway, headed towards the SEALs. She was blinded by a strobe light and pushed to the floor as the SEALs went past her. Osama bin Laden stuck his head out of a bedroom door, saw the SEALs, and slammed the door closed. At the same time, Osama's son Khalid bin Laden ran up the stairs to the third floor and was killed with two shots.|$|E

Three youths – Gavrilo Princip, Trifko Grabež, and Nedeljko Čabrinović – Bosnian Serb subjects of Austria-Hungary, living in Belgrade, testified at the Sarajevo trial that {{at about the same time}} (a little after Easter), they were eager to carry out an assassination and approached a fellow Bosnian Serb and former guerrilla fighter known to be well connected and with access to arms, Milan Ciganović, and through him Major Tankosić and reached an agreement to transport arms to Sarajevo and participate in the assassination.|$|E

25|$|As {{claims of}} {{consistency}} are usually unprovable, they remain {{a matter of}} belief or non-rigorous kinds of justifications.

25|$|The Anglicisms can {{be divided}} to four types: direct phonetic imitation, lexical and {{grammatical}} calques, and contamination of orthography. Official language (<b>as</b> <b>given</b> <b>by</b> the Language Planning Office) deprecates Anglicisms, {{and for the most}} part, native constructions are sufficient even in spoken language.

25|$|The Nazi regime instituted laws {{discriminating against}} Jews, {{declared}} a race by the Nazis, and thus needed a working definition {{of who is}} a Jew as to its law-defined race system. These definitions almost completely categorised persons through the religions followed by each individual's ancestors, according to membership registries.

Such modern authors contrast the views of early Reformers who rejected contraception with modern Christians who accept it, and point to primarily feminist, secular, or Satanic influences as causative to the change.|$|E
25|$|A related type is {{the power}} film capacitor. The {{materials}} and construction techniques used for large power film capacitors mostly {{are similar to those}} of ordinary film capacitors. However, capacitors with high to very high power ratings for applications in power systems and electrical installations are often classified separately, for historical reasons. The standardization of ordinary film capacitors is oriented on electrical and mechanical parameters. The standardization of power capacitors by contrast emphasizes the safety of personnel and equipment, <b>as</b> <b>given</b> <b>by</b> the local regulating authority.|$|E
25|$|The primary {{method by}} which purportedly {{meaningful}} messages have been extracted is the Equidistant Letter Sequence (ELS). To obtain an ELS from a text, choose a starting point (in principle, any letter) and a skip number, also freely and possibly negative. Then, beginning at the starting point, select letters from the text at equal spacing <b>as</b> <b>given</b> <b>by</b> the skip number. For example, the bold letters in this sentence form an ELS. With a skip of −4 (that is, reading backwards every fourth letter), and ignoring the spaces and punctuation, the word safest is spelled out.|$|E
