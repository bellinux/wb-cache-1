During the heavy winter snowfall of 2009–2010 the college's sports facilities were utilised by the Hereford United team for training after the bad weather conditions made using their own grounds at Edgar Street difficult.|$|E

500|$|From {{the premiere}} of the {{original}} Jeopardy! {{until the end of}} the first season of the current syndicated series, contestants were allowed to ring-in as soon as the clue was revealed. Since September 1985, contestants are required to wait until the clue is read before ringing-in. To accommodate the rule change, lights were added to the game board (unseen by home viewers) to signify when it is permissible for contestants to signal; attempting to signal before the light goes on locks the contestant out for half of a second. The change was made to allow the home audience to play along with the show more easily and to keep an extremely fast contestant from potentially dominating the game. In pre-1985 episodes, a buzzer would sound when a contestant signaled; according to Trebek, the buzzer was eliminated because it was [...] "distracting to the viewers" [...] and sometimes presented a problem when contestants rang in while Trebek was still reading the clue. Contestants who <b>are</b> <b>visually</b> <b>impaired</b> or blind are given a card with the category names printed in Braille before each round begins, and an audible tone is played after the clue has been read aloud.|$|E

2500|$|Magee v. McDonald's is a United States {{federal lawsuit}} begun in May 2016 in the Illinois Northern District Court, case number 1:16-cv-05652, in which Scott McGee of Metairie, Louisiana is {{pursuing}} action against McDonald's {{due to the}} company being unwilling to serve people who <b>are</b> <b>visually</b> <b>impaired</b> via the drive thru lane. [...] Because the drive thru lane is sometimes the only method of ordering food once the dining room is closed, this creates {{a situation in which}} people who are legally blind, and unable to operate a motor vehicle can not order food from the restaurant while other people are able to do so.|$|E
2500|$|The contestants {{must first}} play a {{preliminary}} round, called [...] "Fastest Finger First" [...] (or, in the U.S. version, simply [...] "Fastest Finger"), {{where they are}} all given a question and four answers from the host and are asked to put those four answers into a particular order; in the first series of the British version and in pre-2003 episodes of the Australian version, the round instead required the contestants to answer one multiple-choice question correctly as quickly as possible. The contestant who does so correctly and in the fastest time goes on to play the main game for the maximum possible prize (often a million units of the local currency). In the event that two or more contestants are tied for the fastest time, those contestants play another question to break the tie. If no one gets the question right, that question is discarded and another question is played in the same manner. If any contestants <b>are</b> <b>visually</b> <b>impaired,</b> the host reads the question and four choices all at once, then repeats the choices after the music begins.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{describes}} a semi-autonomous wheelchair enabled with “HelpStar ” {{that provides a}} user who <b>is</b> <b>visually</b> <b>impaired</b> with mobility independence. Our “HelpStar ” enabled semi-autonomous wheelchair functions more like a personal assistant, allowing much greater user independence. When the user finds themself in an unforeseen circumstance, the “HelpStar ” feature can be activated to allow a remote operator to use Virtual Reality technologies to provide helpful navigational instructions or to send commands directly to the wheelchair. This paper demonstrates the successful integration of assistive technologies that allow a person who <b>is</b> <b>visually</b> <b>impaired</b> and using a wheelchair to navigate through everyday environments...|$|R
