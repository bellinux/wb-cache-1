Regardless of the increasing demand for such skills by employers, witnessed at present is {{a drop in the}} mathematics <b>and</b> statistics <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> university entrants. This paper uses a British university as a case study and exploits the induction week to collect primary data on the mathematical <b>and</b> statistical <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> entrants into two degree programmes.

5|$|More {{schools for}} the deaf were founded after ASD, <b>and</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> ASL spread to these schools. In addition, the rise of Deaf {{community}} organizations bolstered the continued use of ASL.

This all contributed to ASL's wide use over a large geographical area, atypical of a sign language.|$|E

40|$|While digital rectal examination, prostate-specific antigen, and transrectal {{ultrasound}} {{have been}} identified as effective means of early detection of prostate cancer, African American men tend to underuse these services as compared to white men. Using a nonrandom sample of 108 African American men, the authors conducted an exploratory investigation of the effects of education, income, age, and health insurance coverage on actual <b>and</b> perceived <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> prostate cancer. The extent to which the use of prostate cancer screening services may be attributed to actual <b>and</b> perceived <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> prostate cancer was also explored. Respondents demonstrated a poor <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> prostate cancer <b>and</b> less than 40 % reported having had prostate cancer screening as part of their annual physical examination. The results of the study also revealed that (a) there was a moderately strong correlation between actual <b>and</b> perceived <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> prostate cancer, (b) use of prostate cancer screening service was positively associated with actual <b>and</b> perceived <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> the disease, (c) actual <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> prostate cancer was negatively correlated with education, age, and income, and (d) actual <b>and</b> perceived <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> prostate cancer were both correlated with having health insurance coverage...|$|R

5|$|Although no {{explanation}} {{is provided in}} the biographies of the Ridwan family, it is evident they chose Gaza as their home and the place for their castle. Ridwan Pasha's son Ahmad Pasha succeeded him and governed Gaza for thirty years, sometimes incorporating the sanjaks of Nablus and Jerusalem. He became Governor of Damascus Eyalet in 1601 after bribing several viziers and bureaucrats in Istanbul and died in 1607. Next in line was Hasan Pasha ibn Ahmad who became known 'Arab Hasan ("Hasan the Bedouin") because by then, the Ridwans were identified with the control <b>and</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> the Bedouin. He successfully led his pro-Ottoman Bedouin troops against {{the army of the}} rebel Fakhr ad-Din in a series of battles. He was later appointed Governor of Tripoli in Lebanon, but he was deposed in 1644. 'Arab Hasan had many wives and concubines and 85 children. He led the Ridwans successfully militarily, however, he burdened the dynasty with heavy debt.|$|E
5|$|Archeological {{evidence}} for {{agriculture in the}} Sangam age has been retrieved from sites such as Mangudi, Kodumanal and Perur, which have yielded charred remains of seeds of crops like rice, millets including pearl millets, pulses and cotton. It has been deduced that agriculture most likely involved dry farming, with additional irrigation for cotton and rice; mixed cropping {{seems to have been}} undertaken to replenish the nitrogen in the soil—this also suggests a spread of labour <b>and</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> different sowing and harvesting techniques. The presence of cotton seeds indicates the production of a crop aimed at craft production, which is also attested by finds of cotton and spindle whorls at Kodumanal. Remains of structures that resemble an artificial water reservoir have been located at different sites. In Arikamedu, a few terracotta ring-wells were found {{at the bottom of the}} reservoir; it has been suggested that the ring wells were to assure the supply of water during the dry season.|$|E
