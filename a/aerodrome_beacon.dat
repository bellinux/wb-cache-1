2500|$|In {{the spring}} of 1931 the Imperial Oil Causeway Garage was opened at 812 Wharf Street. The Art Deco {{building}} featured a [...] tower that {{was used as an}} illuminated <b>aerodrome</b> <b>beacon</b> for aviators to put into Victoria Harbour at night. The light was used until World War II when it was turned off. The garage was used until 1974 then it was acquired by the province in 1975 and lastly by the British Columbia Provincial Capital Commission in 1978. The building currently serves as a visitor's information centre and houses other retail outlets.|$|E
2500|$|By March1957, the {{improvements}} {{were seen as}} a high priority, {{but all of the}} bids from the seven companies interested in carrying out the work exceeded the estimate. The Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) was notified, with the city council suggesting that the contract should be awarded to Wenatchee's Regan Electric, who bid $17,672. In addition to the lighting, [...] of electric cables were to be installed, and the work was to be completed within 120 days of signing the contract. A tour sponsored by the Wenatchee Chamber of Commerce was provided to enable aviators to see {{the improvements}} being made. The work, which included an <b>aerodrome</b> <b>beacon,</b> was not completed until 1958, and a dedication program was planned for May1958, jointly organised by two flying clubs and the city council. All of these improvements ultimately cost $18,000.|$|E
50|$|An <b>aerodrome</b> <b>beacon</b> or {{rotating}} beacon is a beacon installed {{at an airport}} or aerodrome to indicate its location to aircraft pilots at night.|$|E
5000|$|Lamp changers {{in current}} use may have two, four, or six lamps and use either a {{spring-loaded}} mechanism or {{an electric motor}} to change lamps when required. They are used in <b>aerodrome</b> <b>beacons</b> and marine navigational aids.|$|R
50|$|Also called rotary {{electrical}} interfaces, rotating electrical connectors, collectors, swivels, or electrical rotary joints, these rings are {{commonly found in}} slip ring motors, electrical generators for alternating current (AC) systems and alternators and in packaging machinery, cable reels, and wind turbines. They {{can be used on}} any rotating object to transfer power, control circuits, or analog or digital signals including data such as those found on <b>aerodrome</b> <b>beacons,</b> rotating tanks, power shovels, radio telescopes or heliostats.|$|R
50|$|An aerobeacon {{is a light}} {{assembly}} {{used to create a}} fixed or flashing signal visible over long distances. It consists of a high intensity electric lamp mounted with a focusing device in a cylindrical housing, which usually is rotated on a vertical axis with an electric motor. The sweep of the narrow beam thus produced gives the flashing effect. Aerobeacons were originally developed for aviation use, most familiarly as <b>aerodrome</b> <b>beacons,</b> but they also saw extensive use in lighthouses. They were far cheaper to manufacture and maintain than classic glass Fresnel lenses, and more rugged; and they could be mounted exposed to the weather. Historic models include the DCB-24, which used a single parabolic reflector; the DCB-224, a double-beamed version of the DCB-24; and the DCB-36, which used a system of plastic Fresnel lenses. Manufacturers included Carlisle & Finch and the Crouse-Hinds Company. They are still in widespread use.|$|R
5000|$|An <b>aerodrome</b> <b>beacon</b> {{is mounted}} {{on top of a}} towering structure, often a control tower, above other {{buildings}} of the airport. It produces flashes similar to that of a lighthouse.|$|E
50|$|Pondicherry Airport has one asphalt runway, {{oriented}} 07/25, 1500 m {{long and}} 30 m wide. It has a 100 by 150 m apron and its new terminal building can handle 300 passengers during peak hours. Navigational aids at Pondicherry include an <b>Aerodrome</b> <b>beacon.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Radiofar, {{actually}} a sub-neighborhood of Surƒçin, is a settlement near the Belgrade's Nikola Tesla Airport, 10 km west of downtown Belgrade. It {{is located in}} the vicinity the Belgrade-Zagreb highway, close to the airport's control tower. This is how the settlement got its name ('radiofar' = <b>aerodrome</b> <b>beacon).</b>|$|E
5000|$|Latur Airport has one asphalt runway, {{oriented}} 05/23, 2300 metres {{long and}} 30 metres wide. Its 100 by 70 metre apron provides parking space for 1 ATR and 1 Business Jet at a time, while its terminal building can handle 60 passengers during peak hours.Navigational aids at Latur include PAPI lights and an <b>Aerodrome</b> <b>beacon</b> ...|$|E
5000|$|Tuticorin Airport has one asphalt runway, {{oriented}} 10/28, 1351 metres {{long and}} 30 metres wide. Its 100 by 60 metre apron provides parking space for 2 ATR 72 or similar aircraft at a time, while its terminal building can handle 72 passengers during peak hours. Navigational aids at Tuticorin include PAPI lights and an <b>Aerodrome</b> <b>beacon</b> ...|$|E
50|$|In {{the spring}} of 1931 the Imperial Oil Causeway Garage was opened at 812 Wharf Street. The Art Deco {{building}} featured a 24.4 m tower that {{was used as an}} illuminated <b>aerodrome</b> <b>beacon</b> for aviators to put into Victoria Harbour at night. The light was used until World War II when it was turned off. The garage was used until 1974 then it was acquired by the province in 1975 and lastly by the British Columbia Provincial Capital Commission in 1978. The building currently serves as a visitor's information centre and houses other retail outlets.|$|E
50|$|Pilot-controlled {{lighting}} (PCL), {{also known}} as aircraft radio control of aerodrome lighting (ARCAL) or pilot-activated lighting (PAL), is a system which allows aircraft pilots to control the lighting of an airport or airfield's approach lights, edge lights, and taxiways via radio. At some airfields, the <b>aerodrome</b> <b>beacon</b> may also be ARCAL controlled. ARCAL is most common at non-towered or little-used airfields where it is neither economical to light the runways all night, nor to provide staff to turn the runway lighting on and off. It enables pilots to control the lighting only when required, saving electricity and reducing light pollution.|$|E
50|$|At {{the same}} time Betty announces she wishes to go to Hollywood, with her Aunt Maude. When their vehicle runs out of petrol near Indian Springs, Arizona, the girls decide to steal petrol from an <b>aerodrome</b> <b>beacon</b> but are caught by Jerry who tows their car to Doc's house. As Jerry is a local Federal Aviation Administration official, he has the {{authority}} to arrest the girls until Judge Gildersleeve comes. The girls hear tales of his imaginary severe sentences. Jerry telegraphs George Lambert about what they have done and asks his permission to teach the haughty Betty a lesson. The girls have to do housework but Maude later overhears the boys' scheme and wins them over by saying it is a great idea, as Betty spoiled since childhood, needs a comeuppance.|$|E
50|$|After being {{considered}} for upgrading in December 1956, the Omak City Council thought that the boundary lighting of what would become known as Omak Airport required improvements, and estimated that the cost would be around $16,000.By March 1957, the improvements were seen as a high priority, {{but all of the}} bids from the seven companies interested in carrying out the work exceeded the estimate. The Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) was notified, with the city council suggesting that the contract should be awarded to Wenatchee's Regan Electric, who bid $17,672. In addition to the lighting, 14000 ft of electric cables were to be installed, and the work was to be completed within 120 days of signing the contract. A tour sponsored by the Wenatchee Chamber of Commerce was provided to enable aviators to see the improvements being made. The work, which included an <b>aerodrome</b> <b>beacon,</b> was not completed until 1958, and a dedication program was planned for May 1958, jointly organised by two flying clubs and the city council. All of these improvements ultimately cost $18,000.The city council approved an ordinance which made an extra $1,000 available towards their share of the cost, which amounted to 48.28 percent of the total; the remaining 52 percent was paid for by the CAA.|$|E
