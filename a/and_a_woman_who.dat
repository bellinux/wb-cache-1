25|$|Originally this commandment forbade male Israelites {{from having}} sexual {{intercourse}} with {{the wife of}} another Israelite; the prohibition did not extend to their own slaves.

This concept of adultery stems from the economic aspect of Israelite marriage whereby the husband has an exclusive right to his wife, whereas the wife, as the husband's possession, {{did not have an}} exclusive right to her husband.|$|E

25|$|Fiction {{literature}} {{also has}} an increased role in shaping people's attitude towards same-sex marriages. An original idea appears in Rafael Grugman dystopian fiction book Nontraditional Love (2008). He describes an inverted world in which mixed-sex marriages are forbidden. In this world intimacy between the opposite sexes is rejected, world history and the classics of world literature have been falsified {{in order to support}} the ideology of the homosexual world (in this world same-sex love is a traditional love). At the heart of the novel is a love story between a man <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> unfortunately were born as heterosexuals in a homosexual world and they forced to hide their feelings and their sexual orientation. For a homosexual society love between man and women is a non-traditional love. The author paints a grotesque situation, but underlying this story is the idea that society should be tolerant and accepting and respect the right of every person to be themselves. It is unusual approach that supports human rights of all people and same-sex marriages.|$|E
25|$|In 1894–95 Gilman {{served as}} editor of the {{magazine}} The Impress, a literary weekly that was published by the Pacific Coast Women's Press Association (formerly the Bulletin). For the twenty weeks the magazine was printed, she was consumed in the satisfying accomplishment of contributing its poems, editorials, and other articles. The short-lived paper's printing came to an end {{as a result of a}} social bias against her lifestyle which included being an unconventional mother <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> had divorced a man. After a four-month-long lecture tour that ended in April 1897, Gilman began to think more deeply about sexual relationships and economics in American life, eventually completing the first draft of Women and Economics (1898). This book discussed the role of women in the home, arguing for changes in the practices of child-raising and housekeeping to alleviate pressures from women and potentially allow them to expand their work to the public sphere. The book was published in the following year, and propelled Gilman into the international spotlight. In 1903, she addressed the International Congress of Women in Berlin, and, the next year, toured in England, the Netherlands, Germany, Austria, and Hungary.|$|E
