5|$|The {{pathogenicity}} of prions and proteins with prion-like domains {{arises from}} their self-templating ability {{and the resulting}} exponential growth of <b>amyloid</b> fibrils. The presence of <b>amyloid</b> fibrils in patients with degenerative diseases has been well documented. These <b>amyloid</b> fibrils are seen {{as the result of}} pathogenic proteins that self-propagate and form highly stable, non-functional aggregates. While this does not necessarily imply a causal relationship between <b>amyloid</b> and degenerative diseases, the toxicity of certain <b>amyloid</b> forms and the overproduction of <b>amyloid</b> in familial cases of degenerative disorders supports the idea that <b>amyloid</b> formation is generally toxic.|$|E
5|$|In 1991, the <b>amyloid</b> {{hypothesis}} {{postulated that}} extracellular <b>amyloid</b> beta (Aβ) deposits are the fundamental {{cause of the}} disease. Support for this postulate comes from {{the location of the}} gene for the <b>amyloid</b> precursor protein (APP) on chromosome 21, together with the fact that people with trisomy 21 (Down Syndrome) who have an extra gene copy almost universally exhibit at least the earliest symptoms of AD by 40years of age. Also, a specific isoform of apolipoprotein, APOE4, is a major genetic risk factor for AD. While apolipoproteins enhance the breakdown of beta <b>amyloid,</b> some isoforms are not very effective at this task (such as APOE4), leading to excess <b>amyloid</b> buildup in the brain. Further evidence comes from the finding that transgenic mice that express a mutant form of the human APP gene develop fibrillar <b>amyloid</b> plaques and Alzheimer's-like brain pathology with spatial learning deficits.|$|E

40|$|AbstractMany {{proteins}} exhibit propensities to form fibrillar aggregates called <b>amyloids</b> {{that are}} rich in β-sheet structures. Abnormal accumulation of <b>amyloids</b> {{in the brain and}} spinal cords is well known as a major pathological change in neurodegenerative diseases; therefore, <b>amyloids</b> have long been considered as disease culprits formed via protein misfolding and should be avoided in healthy cells. Recently, however, increasing numbers of proteins have been identified that require formation of fibrillar states for exertion of their physiological functions, and the critical roles of such functional <b>amyloids</b> include a molecular switch for environmental adaptation, a structural template for catalysis, and a regulator of intracellular signaling. Protein <b>amyloids</b> will, therefore, be more prevailed in our physiologies than we have expected so far. Here, we have reviewed recent studies on such regulatory roles of protein fibrillar aggregates in various physiologies and further discussed possible relations of functional to pathological <b>amyloids...</b>|$|R

5|$|Alzheimer's {{disease has}} been {{identified}} as a protein misfolding disease (proteopathy), caused by plaque accumulation of abnormally folded <b>amyloid</b> beta protein, and tau protein in the brain. Plaques are made up of small peptides, 39–43amino acids in length, called <b>amyloid</b> beta (Aβ). Aβ is a fragment from the larger <b>amyloid</b> precursor protein (APP). APP is a transmembrane protein that penetrates through the neuron's membrane. APP is critical to neuron growth, survival, and post-injury repair. In Alzheimer's disease, gamma secretase and beta secretase act together in a proteolytic process which causes APP to be divided into smaller fragments. One of these fragments gives rise to fibrils of <b>amyloid</b> beta, which then form clumps that deposit outside neurons in dense formations known as senile plaques.|$|E
5|$|Amylostereaceae {{species were}} {{for a long}} time {{classified}} in the genus Stereum, based primary on the layered structure of the fruit body and the similar physiological activity. Mycologist Jacques Boidin separated Amylosterum from Stereum in 1958, justifying this decision by explaining that microscopic differences such as <b>amyloid</b> spores and encrusted cystidia were sufficiently distinct to warrant recognition as a new genus. Although the type species of the genus (today called A.chailletii) was initially named Trichocarpus ambiguus, the name Trichocarpus had already been used for a genus in the flowering plant family Malvaceae. Boidin thus chose the genus name Amylostereum, referring to the <b>amyloid</b> spores.|$|E
5|$|In a 2003 {{review of}} the literature, Rowan et al. {{proposed}} one model for how LTP might be affected in AD. AD appears to result, at least in part, from misprocessing of <b>amyloid</b> precursor protein (APP). The result of this abnormal processing is the accumulation of fragments of this protein, called <b>amyloid</b> β (Aβ). Aβ exists in both soluble and fibrillar forms. Misprocessing of APP results in the accumulation of soluble Aβ that, according to Rowan's hypothesis, impairs hippocampal LTP and {{may lead to the}} cognitive decline seen early in AD.|$|E

40|$|Prions are {{infectious}} {{proteins that}} encipher biological information within their conformations; variations in these conformations dictate different prion strains.

In mice, the most stable <b>amyloids</b> produced the most stable prion strains that exhibited the longest incubation times, whereas more labile <b>amyloids</b> generated less stable strains and shorter incubation times. The direct relationship between stability and incubation time of prion strains suggests that labile prions are more fit, in that they accumulate more rapidly and thus kill the host faster. Although incubation times can be changed by altering the PrP expression level, PrP sequence, prion dose, or route of inoculation, we report here the ability to modify the incubation time predictably in mice by modulating the prion conformation...|$|R
40|$|Huntington’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, Prions Disease are few {{among many}} {{diseases}} caused {{due to the}} aggregation of misfolded proteins, which eventually leads {{to the formation of}} <b>amyloids.</b> <b>Amyloids</b> contain a large amount of â – sheets which make it highly stable in the body environment, thus making its lysis difficult. It is reported that the misfolded proteins form amorphous aggregates first which contain less number of â – sheets. These aggregates would further form <b>amyloids</b> as the number â – sheets increase. Inhibiting the formation of aggregates can be regarded as a therapeutic approach in the treatment of above mentioned diseases. In the present investigation, two existing protocols for the formation of amorphous aggregates of lysozyme (Lys) were studied and a novel protocol for the same was proposed. This novel protocol showed high amounts of aggregate formation of lysozyme under laboratory conditions, as observed under Thioflavin T (ThT) assay. However, there was no formation of <b>amyloids,</b> as was observed under Congo Red assay. The effect of DMSO and Glycerol was investigated on the formation of Lysozyme aggregate. The results of these assays indicated that there was significant decrease in the amount of aggregation of lysozyme in solution.

40|$|Research into <b>amyloids</b> was {{initially}} motivated by pathogenic <b>amyloids</b> in-volved in disease {{states such as}} Alzheimer’s; however, new research implicates small oliogmeric species and not the mature fibers.

40|$|Protein {{aggregates}} {{are associated}} with a variety of debilitating human diseases, but they can have functional roles as well. Both pathological and nonpathological protein aggregates display tremendous diversity, with substantial differences in aggregate size, morphology, and structure. Among the different aggregation types, <b>amyloids</b> are particularly remarkable, because of their high degree of order and their ability to form self-perpetuating conformational states. <b>Amyloids</b> form the structural basis for a group of proteins called prions, which have the ability to generate new phenotypes by a simple switch in protein conformation that does not involve changes in the sequence of the DNA. Although protein aggregates are notoriously difficult to study, recent technological developments and, in particular, the use of yeast prions as model systems, have been very instrumental in understanding fundamental aspects of aggregation. Here, we provide a range of biochemical, cell biological and yeast genetic methods that are currently used in our laboratory to study protein aggregation and the formation of <b>amyloids</b> and prions...|$|R
40|$|Alzheimer's {{disease is}} a {{progressive}} neurodegenerative disorder affecting millions of people. It {{is characterized by the}} slow deposition of cerebral amyloid-β peptides in the brain and by dysregulations in neuronal Ca(2 +) homeostasis. Numerous experimental studies have revealed the existence of a feed-forward loop wherein amyloids-β disturb neuronal Ca(2 +) levels, which in turn affect the production of <b>amyloids.</b> Here, we formalize this positive loop in a minimal, qualitative model and show that it exhibits bistability. Thus, a stable steady state characterized by low levels of Ca(2 +) and <b>amyloids,</b> corresponding to a healthy situation, coexists with another 'pathological state' where the levels of both compounds are high. The onset of the disease corresponds to the switch from the lower steady state to the higher one induced by a large-enough perturbation in either the metabolism of <b>amyloids</b> or the homeostasis of intracellular Ca(2 +). Numerical simulations of the model reproduce a variety of experimental observations about the disease, as its irreversible character, the threshold-like transition to a severe pathology after the slow accumulation of symptoms, the effect of presenilins, the so-called 'prion-like' autocatalytic behaviour of <b>amyloids</b> and the inherent random character of the apparition of the disease that is well known for the sporadic form. The model thus provides a conceptual framework that could be useful when developing therapeutic protocols to slow down the progression of Alzheimer's disease.

30|$|The {{spread in}} the SPI {{measurements}} is also comparable to earlier work. The reason for this spread, besides the previously mentioned errors, has been related to heterogeneity in the internal packing of <b>amyloids</b> [1, 16, 38].|$|R
5|$|One area of {{clinical}} research {{is focused on}} treating the underlying disease pathology. Reduction of beta-amyloid levels is a common target of compounds (such as apomorphine) under investigation. Immunotherapy or vaccination for the <b>amyloid</b> protein is one treatment modality under study. Unlike preventative vaccination, the putative therapy {{would be used to}} treat people already diagnosed. It is based upon the concept of training the immune system to recognise, attack, and reverse deposition of <b>amyloid,</b> thereby altering the course of the disease. An example of such a vaccine under investigation was ACC-001, although the trials were suspended in 2008. Another similar agent is bapineuzumab, an antibody designed as identical to the naturally induced anti-amyloid antibody. However, immunotherapeutic agents have been found to cause some concerning adverse drug reactions, such as amyloid-related imaging abnormalities. Other approaches are neuroprotective agents, such as AL-108, and metal-protein interaction attenuation agents, such as PBT2. A TNFα receptor-blocking fusion protein, etanercept has showed encouraging results.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{revealed}} the propensity of elastin-based biopolymers to form amyloid-like fibers when dissolved in water. These {{are of interest}} when considered as "ancestral units" of elastin in which they represent the simplest sequences in the hydrophobic regions of the general type XxxGlyGlyZzzGly (Xxx, Zzz = Val, Leu). We normally refer to these biopolymers based on elastin or related to elastin units as "elastin-like polypeptides". The requirement of water {{for the formation of}} <b>amyloids</b> seems quite interesting and deserves investigation, the water representing the natural transport medium in human cells. As a matter of fact, the "natural" supramolecular organization of elastin {{is in the form of}} beaded-string-like filaments and not in the form of <b>amyloids</b> whose "in vivo" deposition is associated with some important human diseases. Our work is directed, therefore, to understanding the mechanism by which such hydrophobic sequences form <b>amyloids</b> and any conditions by which they might regress to a non-amyloid filament. The elastin-like sequence here under investigation is the ValGlyGly ValGly pentapeptide that has been previously analyzed both in its monomer and polymer form. In particular, we have focused our investigation on the apparent stability of <b>amyloids</b> formed from poly(ValGlyGlyValGly), and we have observed these fibers evolving to a hydrogel after prolonged aging in water. We will show how atomic force microscopy can be combined with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy to gain an insight into the spontaneous organization of an elastin-like polypeptide driven by interfacial interactions.
