Kanye West, who financed the video, conceived ideas for the clip after seeing an Adidas advertisement in BlackBook magazine. He stated, [...] "I don't like gettin' ideas from direct shit ... I like to pull ideas from <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>over</b> here. Sometimes my vision can't be explained in words, 'cause I couldn't have even told you in words how I envisioned that video ending up." [...] Chike recalled {{the making of the}} clip, saying, [...] "one day Coodie calls me out the blue about a concept he and Kanye had for a video revolving around Polaroid snapshots. I was leaving work at 7 PM only to come back at 10 PM, work all night then go home at 7 AM". Coodie stated that [...] "If we would have wrote a treatment" [...] for the video, [...] "they would have shot that down. They had to see it to understand. Otherwise they'd have said, 'No, Kanye should be rapping at a party, with lots of girls poolside'". It was awarded the Video of the Year at the 2004 Source Hip Hop Awards.|$|E

A chestnut with a wide blaze going <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>over</b> {{his nose}} and lips, Kubinec’s white markings weren't considered acceptable in the Tersk breeding program. According to Dr. O.A. Balakshin of the All Russian Research Institute of Horse Breeding, “Too many horses now have white markings on their head and legs. This is undesirable and should be eliminated by selection.”. Kubinec was sold in 1991 and began making his mark in European show rings.

50|$|Two {{basically}} different superstructures (fiberglass {{top of the}} cabin) {{were available}} on the 35-41 foot Holiday Mansion models.

In this configuration engine access was gained by an engine lid that doubled as a berth support. The superstructure was also pushed out to even with the gunnels. This eliminated the walk around deck, but allowed more room for the aft stateroom and galley.|$|R

50|$|The Standard ERAM is a {{two-stage}} missile with {{a booster}} stage {{and a second}} stage. It is similar in appearance to the RIM-156A Standard missile. The radar seeker is an enlarged version adapted from the AIM-120C AMRAAM seeker (13.5 in versus 7 in). The missile may be employed {{in a number of}} modes: inertial guided to target with terminal acquisition using active radar seeker, semi-active radar homing <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way,</b> or an <b>over</b> <b>the</b> horizon shot with Cooperative Engagement Capability. The missile is also capable of terminal ballistic missile defense as a supplement to the Standard Missile 3 (RIM-161).

5000|$|It {{turned out}} that William Page, who the C&O knew to be a bright man but of {{apparently}} limited financial means, had the secret backing of millionaire industrialist Henry Huttleston Rogers (1840-1909).

40|$|Abstract This paper {{examines}} {{the physics of}} observed non-Gaussian sea surface temperature (SST) anomaly variability in the Gulf Stream system in a recently developed stochastic framework. It is first shown from a new high-resolution observational data set that the Gulf Stream system is very clearly visible as a band of negative skewness <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> from Florida, <b>over</b> Cape Hatteras, to the central North Atlantic. To get an idea about the detailed non-Gaussian variability along the Gulf Stream, probability density functions are calculated at several locations. One important observational result {{of this study is}} that the non-Gaussian tails of SST variability in the Gulf Stream system follow a power-law distribution. The study then shows that the observed non-Gaussianity is consistent with stochastic advection of SST anomalies in an idealized zonal current. In addition, stochastic advection is compatible with the observed northward eddy heat flux in the Gulf Stream, providing a new dynamical view at the heat balance in strong currents...|$|R
50|$|The Cardinals notched the {{scoreboard}} {{in the third}} inning when Matt Carpenter lined a double into right field after an eleven pitch battle with Kershaw. Carlos Beltrán scored Carpenter from second with a line drive single again to right field and advanced to second. Kershaw struck out Matt Holliday but yielded another single to Yadier Molina which scored Beltran from second to make it 2-0 Cardinals. David Freese singled to center field to move Molina to second and Kershaw, already having an uncharacteristic night, walked Matt Adams to load the bases for Shane Robinson. Robinson drove in two runs with a single to right fielder Yasiel Puig, extending the Cardinals' lead to 4-0. Puig committed a throwing error by tossing the ball on a misstep and slinging it <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> to backstop <b>over</b> <b>the</b> head of catcher A.J. Ellis. Kershaw ended the inning by intentionally walking Pete Kozma and striking out Michael Wacha.|$|R
