5|$|Still, Finley & Figg {{remains in}} bad shape. The Krayoxx affair has left them deep in debt {{instead of the}} {{expected}} big profit, their office building – the firm's sole asset – heavily mortgaged and the two partners ailing, in bad shape physically and mentally. Meanwhile, David manages to complete his lead poisoning product liability case, finding that the destructive toys were imported from China by a subsidiary of Sonesta Games, the third-largest toy producer in the U.S. Unlike the Krayoxx case, this provides David with an <b>air-tight</b> case. A jury seeing the poor child, completely disabled as a direct provable result of using the toy, would be certain to grant a high sum in compensations. Knowing this, the Sonesta CEO and his senior executives hasten to meet with David, seeming to show genuine remorse, aside from being aware of the grave damage which the publicity around such a case could cause their corporation. They readily agree to give David's clients, the child's Burmese immigrant parents $5 million in out-of-court compensation, provided that the case remain secret. David insists, however, that $1.5 million in legal fees would not {{come out of his}} clients' compensation but be paid separately by Sonesta; knowing himself to have the upper hand, Zinc is a tough negotiator and the Sonesta directors {{have no choice but to}} agree to pay a total of $6.5 million. In parting, a Sonesta executive discreetly slips Zinc an unmarked envelope with information on lead poisoning caused by the products of Sonesta's competitors.|$|E

25|$|Using an <b>air-tight</b> stove {{initially}} requires {{leaving the}} damper and air vents open until {{a bed of}} coals has been formed. After that, the damper is closed and the air vent regulated {{to slow down the}} burning of the wood. A properly loaded and controlled <b>air-tight</b> stove will burn safely for eight hours or more without further attention.|$|E

25|$|Armies {{may also}} require males to {{maintain}} clean-shaven faces as facial hair can prevent an <b>air-tight</b> seal between {{the face and}} breathing or safety equipment, such as a pilot's oxygen mask, a diver's mask, or a soldier's gas mask.|$|E
25|$|Storage {{life for}} all teas can be {{extended}} by using desiccant or oxygen-absorbing packets, vacuum sealing, or refrigeration in <b>air-tight</b> containers (except green tea, where discrete use of refrigeration or freezing is recommended and temperature variation kept to a minimum).|$|E
25|$|When the diver exhales, one-way valves (made from a {{flexible}} <b>air-tight</b> material) flex outwards {{under the pressure}} of the exhalation, letting gas escape from the chamber. They close, making a seal, when the exhalation stops and the pressure inside the chamber reduces to ambient pressure.|$|E
25|$|A {{lifting bag}} is {{an item of}} diving {{equipment}} consisting of a robust and <b>air-tight</b> bag with straps, {{which is used to}} lift heavy objects underwater by means of the bag's buoyancy. The heavy object can either be moved horizontally underwater by the diver or sent unaccompanied to the surface.|$|E
25|$|To remain {{fresh and}} prevent mold, tea {{needs to be}} stored away from heat, light, air, and moisture. Tea must be kept at room {{temperature}} in an <b>air-tight</b> container. Black tea in a bag within a sealed opaque canister may keep for two years. Green tea deteriorates more rapidly, usually {{in less than a}} year. Tightly rolled gunpowder tea leaves keep longer than the more open-leafed Chun Mee tea.|$|E
25|$|Fresh feces {{consist of}} about 80% {{water and the}} {{majority}} of this water will evaporate away if it is allowed to do so by the feces not being enclosed in <b>air-tight</b> containers or vaults. The water content of dried feces after six months of drying is usually less than 25%. Depending on the degree of drying and the intended reuse application an additional post-treatment step, such as composting, might be necessary for reuse of excreta in agriculture.|$|E
25|$|The Moore House {{achieves}} net-zero energy usage with {{passive solar}} design, ‘tuned’ heat reflective windows, super-insulated and <b>air-tight</b> construction, natural daylighting, solar thermal panels for {{hot water and}} space heating, a photovoltaic (PV) system that generates more carbon-free electricity than the house requires, and an energy-recovery ventilator (ERV) for fresh air. The green building strategies used by Thomas Doerr of Doerr Architecture and Ecofutures Building on the Moore House earned it a verified home energy rating system (HERS) score of −3.|$|E
25|$|Incandescent {{light bulbs}} consist of an <b>air-tight</b> glass {{enclosure}} (the envelope, or bulb) with a filament of tungsten wire inside the bulb, through which an electric current is passed. Contact wires and a base with two (or more) conductors provide electrical {{connections to the}} filament. Incandescent light bulbs usually contain a stem or glass mount anchored to the bulb's base that allows the electrical contacts to run through the envelope without air or gas leaks. Small wires embedded in the stem in turn support the filament and its lead wires.|$|E
25|$|When saffron is dried {{after its}} harvest, the heat, {{combined}} with enzymatic action, splits picrocrocin to yield D–glucose {{and a free}} safranal molecule. Safranal, a volatile oil, gives saffron much of its distinctive aroma. Safranal is less bitter than picrocrocin and may comprise up to 70% of dry saffron's volatile fraction in some samples. A second molecule underlying saffron's aroma is 2-hydroxy-4,4,6-trimethyl-2,5-cyclohexadien-1-one, which produces a scent described as saffron, dried hay-like. Chemists find {{this is the most}} powerful contributor to saffron's fragrance, despite its presence in a lesser quantity than safranal. Dry saffron is highly sensitive to fluctuating pH levels, and rapidly breaks down chemically in the presence of light and oxidising agents. It must, therefore, be stored away in <b>air-tight</b> containers to minimise contact with atmospheric oxygen. Saffron is somewhat more resistant to heat.|$|E
25|$|Locust Trace AgriScience Center, an agricultural-based {{vocational}} school serving Fayette County Public Schools and surrounding districts, features a Net Zero Academic Building engineered by CMTA Consulting Engineers and designed by Tate Hill Jacobs Architects. The facility, located in Lexington, Kentucky, {{also has a}} greenhouse, riding arena with stalls, and a barn. To reach Net Zero in the Academic Building the project utilizes an <b>air-tight</b> envelope, expanded indoor temperature setpoints in specified areas to more closely model real-world conditions, a solar thermal system, and geothermal water source heat pumps. The school has further reduced its site impact by minimizing municipal water use {{through the use of}} a dual system consisting of a standard leach field system and a constructed wetlands system and using pervious surfaces to collect, drain, and use rainwater for crop irrigation and animal watering.|$|E
25|$|The person {{using the}} iron lung is placed {{into the central}} chamber, a {{cylindrical}} steel drum. An opening allowing {{the head and neck}} to remain outside is then sealed off, forming an <b>air-tight</b> compartment enclosing the rest of the person's body from the neck down. Pumps that control airflow periodically decrease and increase the air pressure within the chamber, and particularly, on the chest. When the pressure is below that within the lungs, the lungs expand and atmospheric pressure pushes air from outside the chamber in via the person's nose and airways to keep the lungs filled; when the pressure goes above that within the lungs, the reverse occurs, and air is expelled. In this manner, the iron lung mimics the physiological action of breathing: by periodically altering intrathoracic pressure, it causes air to flow {{in and out of the}} lungs. The iron lung is a form of non-invasive therapy.|$|E
25|$|This IFV variant is {{essentially}} a Fahd 240, fitted with a dual-weapon turret that has a 12.7mm machine gun and a 7.62mm machine gun. The addition of a turret requires a third crewman, the gunner, {{but it does not}} affect the Fahd 240's passenger capacity. The turret is the French BTM-208 turret, produced under license from the French SAMM company. It is <b>air-tight,</b> and provides NBC protection. It incorporates and aiming telescopic periscope, forward–observation, rotating mirror periscope in co-axial alignment with weapons, and five or six bullet-proof glass ports insuring all-round vision and ballistic protection. 200 rounds are provided for the 7.62mm machine gun, and another 100 for the 12.7mm machine gun. Elevation limits are -8 and +45, the turret provides 360 degrees of traversion for the weapons. The vehicle has a rotating seat, and an armored hatch for the turret. The machine guns can be fired by means of a foot pedal, freeing the gunner's hands. A central console groups control switches and warning lights governing weapon selection. The addition of a turret increases the vehicle height to 2.85 meters.|$|E
25|$|Following the Fall of the Roman Empire, {{appreciation}} for aged wine was virtually non-existent. Most of the wines produced in northern Europe were light bodied, pale {{in color and}} with low alcohol. These wines {{did not have much}} aging potential and barely lasted a few months before they rapidly deteriorated into vinegar. The older a wine got the cheaper its price became as merchants eagerly sought to rid themselves of aging wine. By the 16th century, sweeter and more alcoholic wines (like Malmsey and Sack) were being made in the Mediterranean and gaining attention for their aging ability. Similarly, Riesling from Germany with its combination of acidity and sugar were also demonstrating their ability to age. In the 17th century, two innovations occurred that radically changed the wine industry's view on aging. One was the development of the cork and bottle which allowed producers to package and store wine in a virtually <b>air-tight</b> environment. The second was the growing popularity of fortifying wines such as Port, Madeira and Sherries. The added alcohol was found to act as a preservative, allowing wines to survive long sea voyages to England, The Americas and the East Indies. The English, in particular, were growing in their appreciation of aged wines like Port and Claret from Bordeaux. Demand for matured wines had a pronounced effect on the wine trade. For producers, the cost and space of storing barrels or bottles of wine was prohibitive so a merchant class evolved with warehouses and the finances to facilitate aging wines {{for a longer period of}} time. In regions like Bordeaux, Oporto and Burgundy, this situation dramatically increased the balance of power towards the merchant classes.|$|E
500|$|The {{first batch}} of canned slugs to be {{irradiated}} was received on December 20, 1943, allowing the first plutonium {{to be produced}} in early 1944.

To unload them, they were pushed {{all the way through}} to the far (west) end, where they fell onto a neoprene slab and fell down a chute into a [...] pool of water that acted as a radiation shield. Following weeks of underwater storage to allow for decay in radioactivity, the slugs were delivered to the chemical separation building.|$|E
2500|$|Most modern <b>air-tight</b> stoves {{feature a}} damper at the stove's outlet {{that can be}} closed to force the exhaust through an after burner {{at the top of}} the stove, a heated chamber in which the {{combustion}} process continues. Some <b>air-tight</b> stoves feature a catalytic converter, a platinum grid placed at the stove outlet to burn remaining fuel that has not been combusted. (Gases burn at a much lower temperature in the presence of platinum.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Due to {{concerns}} about air pollution, {{efforts have been}} made to improve the stove design over the years. Pellet stoves, for example, are a type of clean-burning stove, and <b>air-tight</b> stoves are another type that combust the wood more completely and therefore reduce the amount of the resulted combustion by-products.|$|E
2500|$|In 1998, Chester [...] "Buck" [...] Weimer of Pueblo, Colorado, {{received}} a patent {{for the first}} undergarment that contained a replaceable charcoal filter.

2500|$|During normal operation, the {{containment}} is <b>air-tight</b> and access is only through marine style airlocks. High air temperature and {{radiation from the}} core limit the time, measured in minutes, people can spend inside containment while the plant is operating at full power. In {{the event of a}} worst-case emergency, called a [...] "design basis accident" [...] in NRC regulations, {{the containment}} is designed to seal off and contain a meltdown. Redundant systems are installed to prevent a meltdown, but as a matter of policy, one is assumed to occur and thus the requirement for a containment building. For design purposes, the reactor vessel's piping is assumed to be breached, causing a [...] "LOCA" [...] (loss Of coolant accident) where the water in the reactor vessel is released to the atmosphere inside the containment and flashes into steam. The resulting pressure increase inside the containment, which is designed to withstand the pressure, triggers containment sprays ("dousing sprays") to turn on to condense the steam and thus reduce the pressure. A SCRAM ("neutronic trip") initiates very shortly after the break occurs. The safety systems close non-essential lines into the <b>air-tight</b> containment by shutting the isolation valves. Emergency Core Cooling Systems are quickly turned on to cool the fuel and prevent it from melting. The exact sequence of events depends on the reactor design.|$|E
2500|$|Most town [...] "gashouses" [...] {{located in}} the eastern US in the late 19th and early 20th centuries were simple {{by-product}} coke ovens that heated bituminous coal in <b>air-tight</b> chambers. The gas driven off from the coal was collected and distributed through networks of pipes to residences and other buildings where it was used for cooking and lighting. (Gas heating did not come into widespread use until {{the last half of}} the 20th century.) The coal tar (or asphalt) that collected in the bottoms of the gashouse ovens was often used for roofing and other waterproofing purposes, and when mixed with sand and gravel was used for paving streets.|$|E

2500|$|The Chełmno {{extermination}} camp (Kulmhof) was built as the first-ever, following Hitler's launch of Operation Barbarossa. It was {{a pilot project}} {{for the development of}} other extermination sites. The experiments with exhaust gases were finalized by murdering 1,500 Poles at Soldau. The killing method at Chełmno grew out of the 'euthanasia' program in which busloads of unsuspecting hospital patients were gassed in <b>air-tight</b> shower rooms at Bernburg, Hadamar and Sonnenstein. The killing grounds at Chełmno, [...] from Łódź, consisted of a vacated manorial estate similar to Sonnenstein, used for undressing (with a truck-loading ramp in the back), as well as a large forest clearing [...] northwest of Chełmno, used for the mass burial as well as open-pit cremation of corpses introduced some time later.|$|E
2500|$|Cucumeropsis mannii is {{reported}} to be pest and disease free. [...] Primary issues include the fungus Macrophomina phaseolina which attacks the roots and lower stems of the crop causing damping-off disease. The fruit fly species Dacus punctifrons may also attack the fruit of this plant. The fruit generally rots due to the existence of larvae. Halticus tibialis is a flea hopper similar to an aphid and may also cause problems for egusi-itoo crops, often killing the leaves of the plant by sucking out sap. After harvesting many beetle species including the red flour beetle and the cigarette beetle may feed on seeds which are not properly stored in <b>air-tight</b> containers [...] Cucumeropsis mannii provides ground cover, effectively suppressing weeds. Intercropping with sorghum, cassava, coffee, cotton, maize, or banana crops can reduce weedings during the growing season from 2-3 to just one. This has significant positive effects on the female farmer who spends the majority of her time weeding.|$|E
2500|$|Respirometry {{depends on}} a [...] "what goes in must come out" [...] principle. Consider a closed system first. Imagine that we place a mouse into an <b>air-tight</b> {{container}}. The air sealed in the container initially contains the same composition and proportions of gases that {{were present in the}} room: 20.95% O2, 0.04% CO2, water vapor (the exact amount {{depends on a}}ir temperature, see dew point), 78% (approximately) N2, 0.93% argon and a variety of trace gases making up the rest (see Earth's atmosphere). As time passes, the mouse in the chamber produces CO2 and water vapor, but extracts O2 from the air in proportion to its metabolic demands. Therefore, as long as we know the volume of the system, the difference between the concentrations of O2 and CO2 at the start when we sealed the mouse into the chamber (the baseline or reference conditions) compared to the amounts present after the mouse has breathed the air at a later time must be the amounts of CO2/O2 produced/consumed by the mouse. Nitrogen and argon are inert gasses and therefore their fractional amounts are unchanged by the respiration of the mouse. In a closed system, the environment will eventually become hypoxic.|$|E
