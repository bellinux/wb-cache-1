5|$|After several missions, {{including}} a major {{one in the}} Land of Waves, Kakashi allows Team 7 to take a ninja exam, enabling them to advance to a higher rank <b>and</b> <b>take</b> <b>on</b> more difficult missions. During the exams, Orochimaru, a wanted criminal, invades Konoha and kills the Third Hokage for revenge. Jiraiya, {{one of the three}} legendary ninjas, declines the title of Fifth Hokage and searches with Naruto for Tsunade whom he chooses to become Fifth Hokage instead.|$|E
5|$|Age, {{cognitive}} growth, {{and continued}} social experience advance {{the development and}} complexity of the internal working model. Attachment-related behaviours lose some characteristics typical of the infant-toddler period <b>and</b> <b>take</b> <b>on</b> age-related tendencies. The preschool period involves the use of negotiation and bargaining. For example, four-year-olds are not distressed by separation if they and their caregiver have already negotiated a shared plan for the separation and reunion.|$|E
5|$|At age {{fourteen}} he met Symeon the Studite (also called Symeon the Pious), a holy monk of the Monastery of Stoudios in Constantinople. That meeting {{convinced the}} younger Symeon to forgo higher education <b>and</b> <b>take</b> <b>on</b> Symeon the Studite as his spiritual father. At {{that time he}} began studying the life of prayer and asceticism under his guidance, {{with the desire to}} immediately enter the monastery. Symeon the Studite asked the young Symeon to wait before becoming a monk, so he spent the years until age twenty-seven serving in the household of a patrician, though according to some sources he served the emperor instead.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the game, the entire map is obscured until explored by the player. The map consists of a landlocked sea with several islands, wreckage, sea creatures, enemy ships, ports, and whirlpools. The player can sometimes encounter message bottles that clear away fog of war on the map to reveal hidden ports.Sea creatures and enemy ships appear randomly and challenge the player for gold or commodities in a card minigame. Ports are trading and safe zones where the player can sell commodities, buy upgrades for the ship, <b>and</b> <b>take</b> <b>on</b> sidequests. Whirlpools teleport the player's ship to a random location on the map.|$|E

5|$|In 2016, Cyan Worlds {{released}} the Kickstarter-backed Obduction. While Obduction is not narratively linked to Myst, {{the game was}} considered by Rand Miller to be a spiritual successor to the Myst series, borrowing several of its themes and puzzle-design approaches, as well as incorporating full-motion video in homage to Myst. Robyn, who had left Cyan before this point, collaborated to help score the game <b>and</b> <b>take</b> <b>on</b> the role {{of one of the}} in-game characters.|$|E

5|$|Sculptural figuration was {{to become}} a {{hallmark}} of van der Weyden's mature work, and is best typified by the Madrid Descent, where the mourning figures are shaped <b>and</b> <b>take</b> <b>on</b> poses more usually seen in sculpture. Erwin Panofsky identified this work and The Madonna Standing as van der Weyden's earliest extant work; they are also his smallest panels. Panofsky dated both panels as 1432–34, and believed them to be early works based on stylistic reasons, their near miniature scale, and because of the evident influences of both Campin and van Eyck.|$|E
5|$|The convoy {{arrived at}} Addu Atoll {{on the evening}} of 9 February, and {{anchored}} there to refuel <b>and</b> <b>take</b> <b>on</b> supplies. This atoll served as a secret supply base for Allied vessels in the Indian Ocean, and the Australian soldiers were not told where they were while the refuelling took place. The troops were also not permitted to go ashore, but regarded the sight of the tropical atoll as a welcome change from the arid Middle East. After the ships were refuelled, the convoy sailed on the afternoon of 10 February.|$|E
5|$|Tengku Amir Hamzah (28 February 1911– 20 March 1946) was an Indonesian {{poet and}} National Hero of Indonesia. Born into a Malay aristocratic {{family in the}} Sultanate of Langkat in North Sumatra, he was educated in both Sumatra and Java. While {{attending}} senior high school in Surakarta around 1930, the youth became involved with the nationalist movement {{and fell in love}} with a Javanese schoolmate, Ilik Sundari. Even after Amir continued his studies in legal school in Batavia (now Jakarta) the two remained close, only separating in 1937 when Amir was recalled to Sumatra to marry the sultan's daughter <b>and</b> <b>take</b> <b>on</b> responsibilities of the court. Though unhappy with his marriage, he fulfilled his courtly duties. After Indonesia proclaimed its independence in 1945, he served as the government's representative in Langkat. The following year he was killed in a socialist revolution led by the Communist Party of Indonesia and buried in a mass grave.|$|E

5|$|The large convoys of East Indiamen {{were among}} the {{principal}} targets for any French raider. These huge ships sailed from Britain with general cargo, or often military stores and troops, to India or other ports in the Indian Ocean, South East Asia, or China. There they would sell their cargoes <b>and</b> <b>take</b> <b>on</b> spices, tea, silk and other luxury goods before making the return journey to Britain. A round trip took over a year and an East Indiaman sailing to Britain would routinely carry {{hundreds of thousands of}} pounds worth of trade goods; one large convoy that sailed from Canton in January 1804 was worth over £8 million. East Indiamen were well-protected, armed with up to 30guns, and generally travelled in large convoys in which the ships could provide one another with mutual protection. Such convoys often had a Royal Navy escort, usually including a ship of the line.|$|E
5|$|A large robotic craft arrives {{searching for}} Finn. When Finn (voiced by Jeremy Shada) finally {{encounters}} it, Jake (voiced by John DiMaggio) destroys {{it with his}} fist. Princess Bubblegum (voiced by Hynden Walch) examines the wreckage and discovers its location of origin; this engenders in Finn a desire to discover the craft's creators. Finn thus resolves to travel across the sea from whence the craft came, but before leaving, he tells Fern (voiced by Hayden Ezzy) to stay and look after Ooo for him. Princess Bubblegum, Marceline (voiced by Olivia Olson) and Fern see Finn, Jake and Susan Strong (voiced by Jackie Buscarino) off on their voyage. Initially, the journey is easy and uneventful, but soon, Finn, Jake, and Susan encounter a sea dragon named Whipple (voiced by Josh Fadem), who {{turns out to be}} rather annoying. BMO (voiced by Niki Yang), who unbeknownst to the others was stowing away on their boat, angrily tells Whipple off, which causes the sea dragon to summon a storm and destroys their boat. This predicament forces Jake to use his magical powers <b>and</b> <b>take</b> <b>on</b> the shape of a boat for the rest to ride. Unfortunately, {{below the surface of the}} water, a species of jellyfish latches onto him, which causes Jake to begin hallucinating. Eventually, after much struggle, Finn and Susan are able to remove them, which causes the hallucinations to end. At this point, Jake complains about wanting to return home, but Finn reveals how important this trip is to him. Whipple overhears Finn's lament and begins to feel sorry for his actions; he then uses his powers to blow the group over the dangerous waters.|$|E
