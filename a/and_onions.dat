40|$|Background: Detection of {{specific}} IgE antibodies against food materials indicates allergic sensitization. Some very widely consumed foods {{materials such as}} garlic <b>and</b> <b>onion</b> have rarely been investigated for their allergenic potential. Objectives: To assess the presence of garlic <b>and</b> <b>onion</b> specific IgE antibodies in patients investigated for food allergy. Methods: Radioallergosorbent test (RAST) results of 108 patients with clinical suspicion of food allergy who were specifically screened for garlic <b>and</b> <b>onion</b> specific IgE antibodies along with other food allergens were analyzed retrospectively at King Khalid University Hosptial between January 2008 and April 2009. This group of patients included 73 males and 35 females with mean age 27 + 13. 2 years. Estimation of garlic <b>and</b> <b>onion</b> specific IgE antibodies was performed by radioallergosorbent test (RAST) using Pharmacia ImmunoCAP 250 analyzer. Results: Out of the 108 patients 15 (13. 8 %) had garlic <b>and</b> <b>onion</b> specific IgE antibodies in their sera. Garlic specific IgE antibodies with the RAST scores between one to four were present in 14 <b>and</b> <b>onion</b> specific IgE were detected in 13 patients. For garlic specific IgEs majority of patients (08) had RAST score of one (0. 35 - 0. 69 kU/L) <b>and</b> for <b>onion</b> specific IgE antibodies seven patients had RAST score of two (0. 70 - 3. 49 kU/L). Among these patients 12 (80 %) {{were found to have}} coexisting specific IgE antibodies against garlic <b>and</b> <b>onion.</b> Conclusion: The presence of garlic <b>and</b> <b>onion</b> specific IgE antibodies in a sizeable number of patients indicate sensitizatio...|$|R
5|$|Faisalabadi cuisine is {{very much}} Punjabi cuisine, with {{influences}} from the realms of the Mughal and Colonial empires. Key ingredients include rice or roti (flatbread) served with a vegetable or non-vegetable curry, a salad consisting of spiced tomatoes <b>and</b> <b>onions,</b> and yogurt. This is usually accompanied {{by a variety of}} South Asian sweets such as jaggery, gajar ka halwa, gulab jamun, and jalebi. Tandoori barbecue specialties consist of a variety of naan bread served with tandoori chicken, chicken tikka or lamb shishkebab served with a mint chutney.|$|E
5|$|From {{the early}} 1860s whaling {{declined}} rapidly {{with the increasing}} use of petroleum, the onset of the Californian goldrush, and the American Civil War â€“ with unfortunate consequences for the island. To explore alternative means of income Thompson, in 1867, purchased the Sylph which was the first local vessel to trade with Sydney (mainly pigs <b>and</b> <b>onions).</b> It anchored in deep water at what is now Sylph's Hole off Old Settlement Beach, but was eventually tragically lost at sea in 1873 which added to the woes of the island at this time.|$|E
5|$|Historically, Deir Ghassaneh {{depended}} {{primarily on}} olive cultivation, {{and until the}} present day most of Bani Zeid's cultivable land is covered by olive orchards. The cultivation of other fruit trees is significantly lower, with almonds being a distant second at 240 dunams. Other crops grown include grains which cover 135 dunams <b>and</b> <b>onions,</b> dry legumes and fodder to a lesser degree. Only 1% of the town's residents own livestock {{and according to the}} Palestinian Ministry of Agriculture, there were 1,880 goats, 268 sheep, 12 cows and 281 beehives in Bani Zeid in 2009. Agriculture currently accounts for 10% of labor in the town.|$|E

40|$|Relationship between {{phytotoxin}} {{production and}} pathogenicity in Burkholderia spp. was investigated. Tropolone productive strains of B. plantarii and B. vandii were pathogenic to rice seedlings, gladiolus leaves <b>and</b> <b>onion</b> bulbs. Similarly, toxoflavin productivity correlated with pathogenicity of bacterial isolates to all plants used i. e. rice seedlings, dendrobium, cymbidium, gladiolus leaves, potato tubers <b>and</b> <b>onion</b> bulbs in B. glumae and B. gladioli. Treatment {{of these plants}} with tropolone caused damages on rice seedlings <b>and</b> <b>onion</b> bulbs, whereas no damage was observed on gladiolus leaves. Toxoflavin treatment gave damages on rice seedlings, leaves of orchidaceous plants, gladiolus <b>and</b> <b>onion</b> bulbs, but no distinct damage was shown on potato tuber. Some unknown factor(s) other than phytotoxin will also be associated with virulence in Burkholderia spp...|$|R
40|$|This work {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the phytotoxic potential of the aerial and underground parts of Senna occidentalis and S. obtusifolia on the germination and initial growth of lettuce <b>and</b> <b>onion.</b> Four concentrations were used of each ethanol extract (0, 250, 500 and 1000 mg L - 1), with four replications of 50 seeds. From the investigated species, the aerial part of S. occidentalis interfered in <b>onion</b> germination <b>and</b> the aerial part of S. obtusifolia interfered in the germinations of lettuce <b>and</b> <b>onion.</b> The ethanol extract from the aerial and underground parts of the studied species inhibited the root growth of lettuce <b>and</b> <b>onion.</b> The hypocotyl/coleoptile growth in lettuce <b>and</b> <b>onion</b> was inhibited by the extract of S. obtusifolia aerial part and the underground part of S. occidentalis and S. obtusifolia. The results obtained {{make it possible to}} infer that the studied species contain substances that influence the germination and growth of the target seedlings.

5|$|Storage can be {{short-term}} or long-term. Most {{vegetables are}} perishable and short-term storage {{for a few}} days provides flexibility in marketing. During storage, leafy vegetables lose moisture, and the vitamin C in them degrades rapidly. A few products such as potatoes <b>and</b> <b>onions</b> have better keeping qualities and can be sold when higher prices may be available, and by extending the marketing season, a greater total volume of crop can be sold. If refrigerated storage is not available, the priority for most crops is to store high-quality produce, to maintain a high humidity level, and to keep the produce in the shade.|$|E
5|$|A grilled Italian sausage {{sandwich}} {{was sold}} in 1992 and was served with onions and peppers or parmigiana style with mozzarella cheese and marinara sauce. As part of the company's BK Dinner Baskets promotion in 1993, the chain introduced a grilled meatloaf sandwich with ketchup <b>and</b> <b>onions</b> in the United States. In 2013, Burger King sold a bratwurst sandwich in a regional limited time offering in the US states of Wisconsin and Illinois. The sandwich featured a bratwurst manufactured by Johnsonville Foods, raw onion and yellow mustard. Despite being discontinued, versions of the steak sandwich have been re-released several times since the 1970s. The BK Dinner baskets featured a steak sandwich, and in 2003 Burger King New Zealand introduced the Big Bloke Steak Sandwich which was almost identical to the 1979 sandwich.|$|E
5|$|Another failed product, {{this time}} under Grand Metropolitan's {{successor}} Diageo, was the BK Back Porch Grillers line of burgers that featured a spiced and flavored patty {{served on a}} bakery-style roll. There were two varieties: The Regular served with mayonnaise, whole leaf iceberg lettuce, tomato and grilled onions, and the Bacon Cheddar, with bacon and smoked cheddar cheese. There was one LTO variety, the Black Stack Griller, made with Black Strap Barbecue sauce (a strong molasses-flavored sauce), Swiss cheese, bacon, <b>and</b> <b>onions,</b> to promote Men in Black II. The Griller patty was flavored so {{that it had a}} taste similar to a hamburger that had been grilled over a charcoal-fired grill.|$|E

5|$|The Northern Celestial Masters {{followed}} certain regular, communal rites. One {{of these}} communal rites involved formal banquets. These feasts could {{last as long}} as seven days. In order to purify themselves for feasts, members had to abstain from eating meat, garlic, green onions, ginger, leeks <b>and</b> <b>onions.</b> A banquet consisted of three courses â€“ wine, rice and a vegetarian meal. Ritual activity during feasts and other activities usually involved a series of bows and prostrations as well as the burning of incense. Banquets were also held when someone died. During these banquets, attendees would perform rituals aimed at remitting the sins of the deceased.|$|E
5|$|Wounds {{were treated}} by bandaging with raw meat, white linen, sutures, nets, pads, and swabs soaked with honey to prevent infection, while opium thyme and {{belladona}} {{were used to}} relieve pain. The earliest records of burn treatment describe burn dressings that use the milk from mothers of male babies. Prayers {{were made to the}} goddess Isis. Moldy bread, honey and copper salts were also used to prevent infection from dirt in burns. Garlic <b>and</b> <b>onions</b> were used regularly to promote good health and were thought to relieve asthma symptoms. Ancient Egyptian surgeons stitched wounds, set broken bones, and amputated diseased limbs, but they recognized that some injuries were so serious that they could only make the patient comfortable until death occurred.|$|E

Abdah thought that slavery was wrong and agreed to {{transport}} Bok to the town of Ed-Da'Ein {{in the back of his}} truck amongst his cargo of grain <b>and</b> <b>onions.</b> Bok stayed with Abdah, his wife and two sons for two months while Abdah tried to find a way to take Bok to Khartoum, the capital city of Sudan. When he could not find a friend to provide passage to Khartoum, Abdah bought a bus ticket to Khartoum for Bok. Francis Bok arrived in Khartoum with no money, no place to go, and did not know where to turn. Fortunately for Francis, another stranger helped him find his way to his fellow Dinka tribespeople in Khartoum in the Jabarona settlement.|$|E
