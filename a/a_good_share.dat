25|$|The Qundeil variety {{has been}} {{introduced}} to Dar al-Manasir from the regions of Mahas and Sukut north of Dongola during the past decades. Like the Bur and Bireir varieties their produce {{in the region of}} the Fourth Cataract is limited by the fact that <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>share</b> of their fruits fall off prematurely.|$|E
25|$|The Bur {{cultivar}} {{exists only}} {{in the region of}} the Fourth Cataract. Bur palm trees, along with the Bireir and Qundeil varieties are only producing a limited quantity of harvest because <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>share</b> of their fruits is falling off the trees prematurely during the early stages of growth. Due to this unfavourable characteristic the number of cultivated Bur trees remains limited.|$|E
25|$|The {{breakthrough}} {{was started}} by Ivan Yefremov's utopian novel Andromeda Nebula (1957). He was soon followed by brothers Arkady and Boris Strugatsky, who explored darker themes and social satire in their Noon Universe novels, such as Hard to be a God (1964) and Prisoners of Power (1969), {{as well as in}} their science fantasy trilogy Monday Begins on Saturday (1964). <b>A</b> <b>good</b> <b>share</b> of Soviet science fiction was aimed at children. Probably the best known was Kir Bulychov, who created Alisa Selezneva (1965-2003), a children's space adventure series about a teenage girl from the future.|$|E

500|$|Peale {{departed}} from New York for Le Havre on May 8, 1833, arriving in Paris {{late in the}} month. [...] At this time, it was only certain that Peale would visit Paris—a visit to England, with instruction at local mints and refineries, was still under discussion. Peale had been instructed to learn [...] "parting," [...] a newly developed method for separating gold and silver. This process, also dubbed refining, is necessary because nuggets that contain gold also contain some silver, and the latter metal must be removed before the gold can be alloyed with copper for coining. [...] The older method of removing silver involved the use of nitric and sulphuric acids, and was dangerous and expensive. Director Moore also instructed Peale to gain the method of assaying silver by the [...] "humid process" [...] (titration), and to learn everything he could of coining technology {{and how it was}} powered by steam. Moore warned, [...] "a very material object of your mission is to be regarded as unaccomplished, until you have become familiar with everything requisite for directing the formation of an establishment de novo ... and until you shall have acquired <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>share</b> of adroitness in the actual manipulations... Whatever can be added to our information in regard to the treatment of the precious metals, and Mint processes and machinery is within the scope of your inquiries." [...] Moore asked that, if Peale had any time remaining, to look into other technologies that might be useful to the United States, such as the gas illumination of cities.|$|E

40|$|Two {{alternative}} {{schemes to}} distribute the energy flux over larger surfaces are proposed and tested at Tore Supra. (i) <b>A</b> <b>good</b> <b>sharing</b> of the energy flux to the pump limiter and the ergodic divertor (ED) is achieved at a reduced stochasticity, (ii) The operation at highest densities with the plasma leaning on the high field side is characterised by the same screening properties and achievable densities as for the standard operation. The results indicate that an efficient heat reduction and screening of impurities can be reached under ED operation, These experiments have partly been carried out {{in order to test}} special aspects of the dynamic ED (DED) at TEXTOR.

The IS curriculum is particularly strong in the emphasis of application in teaching programming.

While we can easily gather <b>a</b> <b>good</b> collection of many examples, we need <b>a</b> <b>good</b> search tool {{to find the right}} one. Our need in each teach-ing situation can be very specific. We need to leverage <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>sharing</b> facility to foster collabo-ration. Good teachers who use the system may also want to contribute to the system.

3000|$|Each person {{possesses}} an inviolability {{founded on}} justice {{that even the}} welfare of {{society as a whole}} cannot override.

40|$|Frequent {{revision}} of firms' actions facilitates to sustain tacit collusion.

Particularly noteworthy is the fact that, in a large class of environments, a firm's deviation can be deterred by no more than one punisher, implying that at most two firms need to invest in frequent revision in order to sustain collusion. ...|$|R
