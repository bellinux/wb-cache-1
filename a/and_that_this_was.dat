5|$|In 2010, Cinema Retro {{magazine}} {{hosted a}} screening of the film at Ettington Park. Richard Johnson was a special guest at the event and participated in a Q prior to the screening. Johnson {{said that he had}} never actually stepped foot in the hall during filming, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> the first occasion he had actually been inside the premises. The movie was mentioned in Dan Simmons' 2002 novel A Winter Haunting.|$|E
5|$|In March 2015 {{the team}} {{confirmed}} that Riis {{had been removed}} from active duty due to differences between Riis and Tinkov. Media reports had initially indicated that Riis had been suspended when he did not appear at the 2015 Milan–San Remo as planned, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> due to a disappointing start to the season for the team. His departure from the team was officially announced on 29 March.|$|E
5|$|In {{the preface}} of The Archaeology of Ritual and Magic, Merrifield {{noted that the}} book's bias was to the {{archaeology}} of London, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> particularly evident in its use of illustrations.|$|E

50|$|Aristotle's {{assumption}} that man <b>is</b> as-he-happens-to-be <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> distinct from man-as-he-should-be. The Enlightenment, {{on the other}} hand, offers no metaphysical framework whatsoever in place of teleology.|$|R
5|$|When Josepha Petrick began {{painting}} for Mbantua Gallery in central Australia, she indicated {{that her name}} was Josepha rather than Josie, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> how she henceforth wished to be known; however Mbantua's biography is the only source that has used that version of her name.|$|E
5|$|Amésqueta was {{extremely}} {{suspicious of the}} small canoes being supplied, knowing that the Itza had 30-man canoes; he was also aware that tricking enemies into small canoes was a favoured tactic among the lowland Maya to separate and kill Spanish intruders. He suspected that AjK'ixaw had betrayed them <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> precisely {{what had happened to}} Díaz and his men. As nightfall approached, low on rations, in a vulnerable location and with no sign of Díaz and his men, Amésqueta retreated from the lakeshore and his men took up positions on a small hill nearby. In {{the early hours of the}} morning he ordered a retreat by moonlight, using just a few torches. They arrived back at Chakal on 25 March and from there retreated to San Pedro Mártir on 9 April, beset by worsening conditions, a hurricane, sickness and rumours of enemies. The battered expedition set up a base camp nine leagues (approximately 23.4miles or 37.7km) north of Mopan.|$|E
5|$|French naturalist Lucien Quélet {{transferred}} the species to the now-obsolete genus Dictyopus in 1886, {{which resulted in}} the synonym Dictyopus torosus. Boletus xanthocyaneus, first described by Henri Romagnesi in 1948 as Boletus purpureus var. xanthocyaneus and classified as a species in 1976, was considered by Italian mycologist Carlo Luciano Alessio to be synonymous with B. torosus. Others, however, regard this fungus a distinct species. In 2013 Italian mycologists Valerio Bertolini and Giampaolo Simonini observed that the brevity of the original species description meant that some subsequent papers used B.torosus for specimens that aligned more closely with descriptions of Boletus rhodopurpureus or B.luteocupreus (both now placed in the genus Imperator). They did note that Swiss and French authors had adhered to a more detailed description by Quélet, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> the only description faithful to the original description with a grey cap and yellow pores that slowly turn red. They concluded the original description must have been based on specimens growing near the French-Swiss border and hence selected a neotype specimen from this region.|$|E

50|$|A {{variety is}} algebraically {{hyperbolic}} if the special set is empty. Lang conjectured that a variety X is Mordellic if {{and only if}} X <b>is</b> algebraically hyperbolic <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> turn equivalent to X being pseudo-canonical.|$|R
25|$|Controversial {{statements}} about human races {{can be found}} in the book. Gardner believes that William S. Sadler, who wrote some eugenicist works, had a hand in editing or writing the book, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> how the ideas were included.|$|R
5|$|In 1921, Frank Schofield, a Canadian {{veterinary}} pathologist, {{determined that}} the cattle were ingesting moldy silage made from sweet clover, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> functioning as a potent anticoagulant. Only spoiled hay made from sweet clover (grown in northern states of the USA and in Canada {{since the turn of}} the century) produced the disease. Schofield separated good clover stalks and damaged clover stalks from the same hay mow, and fed each to a different rabbit. The rabbit that had ingested the good stalks remained well, but the rabbit that had ingested the damaged stalks died from a haemorrhagic illness. A duplicate experiment with a different sample of clover hay produced the same result. In 1929, North Dakota veterinarian Dr L.M. Roderick demonstrated that the condition was due to a lack of functioning prothrombin.|$|E

Later that month it was announced that Riis' contract had been terminated with the agreement of both parties. Subsequently the team revealed its new management structure, with Riis' former duties being carried out by new general manager Stefano Feltrin and Steven de Jongh, who was promoted to the role of head sport director.|$|E
5|$|In {{the later}} {{part of the}} 18th and through the 19th century, {{criticism}} centred on debates over the moral message of the play. Actor and playwright David Garrick's 1748 adaptation excluded Rosaline: Romeo abandoning her for Juliet was seen as fickle and reckless. Critics such as Charles Dibdin argued that Rosaline had been purposely included in the play to show how reckless the hero was <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> {{the reason for his}} tragic end. Others argued that Friar Laurence might be Shakespeare's spokesman in his warnings against undue haste. With the advent of the 20th century, these moral arguments were disputed by critics such as Richard Green Moulton: he argued that accident, and not some character flaw, led to the lovers' deaths.|$|E

50|$|Bakker (2006) observes <b>that</b> <b>this</b> model does contain contradictions {{relating}} to the ordering of preverbs <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> likely due to the multiple functions of some preverbs. That is, identical forms with distinct meanings can occur at different positions in the verb complex.|$|R
5|$|The first California Diamond Jubilee half dollar struck {{was given}} to the Memorial Museum in Golden Gate Park, San Francisco. The die used for the initial strikings was {{specially}} treated to produce a frosted or cameo effect, which wore down after the first approximately 75 strikings, according to Swiatek in his later volume on commemoratives. Numismatist Kevin Flynn suggests that the first 100 pieces exhibit these special surfaces, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> done at Rossi's request for presentation to VIPs. One piece is known without a mint mark; this was most likely a trial piece, prepared and owned by Mint Chief Engraver John R. Sinnock and later sold from his estate.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{released}} on the web gaming portal Kongregate in 2013. In December 2013, the game received funding from Mediafonds, a Dutch organisation. During the 2015 GaymerX in San Jose, California, the video game was demoed. About {{three years after the}} release of the original prototype, the full game, which was developed and published by Sassybot, a three-man indie game studio in the Netherlands, {{was released on}} 3 May 2016 for Microsoft Windows and 1 June 2016 for Xbox One, with the PlayStation 4 version released 26 September 2017. The developers tested and demoed the game during the 2016 Game Developers Conference and said that they experienced people crying while playing the game at their booth <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> the reaction for which they had hoped.|$|E
5|$|While Walter and Agent Astrid Farnsworth (Jasika Nicole) {{ensure that}} the witness is safe at the hospital, Olivia takes Peter back to the lab. Peter, {{suffering}} from a headache, takes an aspirin and drinks out of what he believes to be an ordinary bottle of milk from the fridge. In reality, the milk contains a serum developed by Walter {{in order to help}} him recover his full mental function. However, the serum was incorrectly prepared, which causes Peter to begin convulsing. Over the phone, Walter directs Olivia to inject Peter with the correct compounds in order to save his life. Walter realizes that the serum would have killed him if he had consumed it, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> another step in the Observer's plot. Later that evening, September meets with another Observer, and identifies the fact that Walter was able to let Peter go, despite believing that he may not survive, and that when the time comes, they can expect Walter to do it again.|$|E
50|$|Critics {{maintain}} that the father must prove the mother to be an unfit parent before he is awarded primary custody, while the mother need not prove the father unfit {{in order to win}} custody herself, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> contrary to the equal protection clause.|$|R
