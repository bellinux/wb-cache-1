The recent appearance of Ostreopsis spp. in the Mediterranean Sea as well as the uncontrolled diffusion of Palythoa corals, widely used as aquarium decorative elements, pose serious concerns for human health. The concomitant detection of putative PLTX and of PLTX analogues poses new problems regarding the toxicological potential of PLTXs, already known for their high toxicity since the 1970 s. In general, adverse effects in humans can occur through different exposureroutes: ingestion, dermal, inhalational, or ocular exposure. Among them, oral exposure after ingestion of contaminated seafood is the most dangerous one for human health, although it seems to be limited to tropical and subtropical regions. On the contrary, in temperate areas, such as the Mediterranean Sea, human intoxications are frequently associated with inhalational exposure to aerosolized seawater during Ostreopsis blooms. In vivo toxicity studies indicate that the toxicity of PLTX by oral route is lower than that after parenteral injection, but the European Food Safety Authority suggested an <b>admissible</b> <b>limit</b> of 30 μg PLTX/kg shellfish meat.

An {{assessment of}} physical wear rate of buildings and structures and their elements is carried out in the former republics of the USSR mainly in accordance with external physical signs (deflections, cracks, layer separations, etc.) but wear percentage is often calculated on the basis of replacement cost in comparison with the initial one even without taking into account inflation which did not officially exist in the USSR.
