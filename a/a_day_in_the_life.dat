500|$|Until 1934, nudity {{involving}} [...] "civilized" [...] women, {{which was}} understood to mean white women, was generally banned, but permitted with [...] "uncivilized" [...] women, which was understood to mean non-white women.

Typical {{of the film is}} the first scene where the two girls take a bath in the river while Dickason narrators, talking breathlessly about how the two girls [...] "bathe their shamelessly nude bronze bodies".

500|$|... "Friday" [...] {{uses the}} 50s {{progression}}, an I-VI-IV-V chord progression that many popular songs have used such as [...] "Heart and Soul" [...] and [...] "Unchained Melody". It is {{performed in the}} key of B major at a tempo of 112 beats per minute. According to Randy Lewis of Los Angeles Times, the familiar structure contributes to the song's catchiness, making it what others have called an earworm. The song also sees Black on a harmony track. In a review for Rolling Stone, writer Matthew Perpetua described the vocals as having [...] "a peculiar tonality that inadvertently highlights the absurdity of boilerplate pop lyrics," [...] adding that the tone in the refrain [...] "sounds unlike anything else in pop music." [...] He noted the sound as being not entirely agreeable to listen to, but stated that Black ultimately ends up [...] "sounding like a distinct singer with an alluring sort of anti-charisma." [...] The lyrics of the song speak about [...] "hanging out with friends and having fun." [...] Paul Asay of Plugged In noted that lyrics reflect the happenings of <b>a</b> <b>day,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>life</b> of a teenager like Black, like eating breakfast and going to school.

500|$|Lyrically [...] "I Don't Give A" [...] {{describes}} <b>a</b> <b>day</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>life</b> of Madonna, {{with the}} singer working through her schedule.

[...] During the bridge, the lyrics presumably talks about a marriage which did not work out for unknown reasons, [...] "I tried to be a good girl/ I tried to be your wife/ I diminished myself/ And I swallowed my light." [...] Many critics agreed that the song has pretty direct lyrics that seem to take aim at her ex-husband, film director Guy Ritchie. However, when asked if Ritchie was indeed the subject of the song, Madonna's representative Liz Rosenberg added that [...] " [...] has not explained the lyrics and if they are about someone specifically ... I appreciate that people will speculate." [...] The song ends with Minaj uttering the final line, [...] "There's only one queen and that's Madonna. Bitch!" ...|$|E
