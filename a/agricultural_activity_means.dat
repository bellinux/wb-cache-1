Bedrock type, weathering rate and terrestrial vegetation are factors known to influence dissolved Si fluxes at the landscape scale, however the combined effect of these factors, along with anthropogenic influences on Si concentration and seasonal Si cycling is yet unknown. Using the provincial water quality monitoring network dataset (PWQMN) provided by the Ontario Ministry of Environment (Canada), Satellite data from The Ontario Land Cover Database (OMNR), we tested several factors that may influence dissolved silica (DSi) concentration and the annual DSi concentration range (as a proxy for seasonal cycling) for 79 river and stream monitoring stations within 53 distinct sub-watersheds in Ontario, Canada, for the years 2005 to 2011 in single and multivariate analyses. Our results indicate that the annual average DSi concentration is not affected by land-use type. The annual range in DSi, however, is positively influenced by the percent of land under agriculture, and negatively influenced by the amount of land covered by forests. Because average DSi is not affected by land-use, increased N and P loads associated with <b>agricultural</b> <b>activity</b> <b>mean</b> lowered Si:N and Si:P ratios in river water. Increased annual DSi range implies changes to both the timing and the quantity of Si delivered to downstream coastal environments, which may have implications for seasonal diatom production and carbon sequestration...|$|R

40|$|Polish {{legislation}} lacks one {{broad and}} comprehensive definition of <b>agricultural</b> <b>activity.</b> Legal regulations concerning farm tourism in Poland are dispersed in different legislation acts. Therefore {{it is worthwhile}} taking a closer view {{on the notion of}} farm tourism as an <b>agricultural</b> <b>activity,</b> or activity related to agriculture as defined in Italian law. The main deliberations are focused on the analysis of the criteria that connect farm tourism with <b>agricultural</b> <b>activity</b> as set out in Act 96 / 2006 on farm tourism. Those criteria are variable, detailed and they precisely determine the boundaries within which farm tourism may be conducted. In the concluding remarks, de lege ferenda on the notion of farm tourism in Polish law have been presented. The author points to the necessity (formulated already in the literature) of inserting into Polish legislation of the notion of <b>agricultural</b> <b>activity.</b> This should be performed in a systematic and coherent way, and the notion should include non only the traditional production activities but various related activities, such as farm tourism, as well.
