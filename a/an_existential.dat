5|$|Although well received, the series' {{ratings were}} not {{high enough to}} warrant a third series. After its {{cancellation}} in September 1997, Davies had <b>an</b> <b>existential</b> crisis after almost dying from an accidental overdose; the experience persuaded him to detoxify and {{make a name for}} himself by producing a series that celebrated his homosexuality.|$|E
5|$|Charles Smithson – {{the main}} male character. Though {{born into a}} family {{with close ties to}} nobility, Smithson does not possess a title but has a sizable income and {{considerable}} education. Early in the novel he is described both as a casual naturalist and a Darwinist. Though trying to become an enlightened and forward-thinking individual, the narrator often emphasises, through commentary on Smithson's actions and situation, that his identity is strongly rooted in the traditional social system. Moreover, conflicting identification with social forces, such as science and religion, lead Smithson to <b>an</b> <b>existential</b> crisis.|$|E

5|$|For the Brazilian Empire, expansionist {{plans on}} the part of powerful, republican Argentina {{represented}} <b>an</b> <b>existential</b> threat. It also signified a threat to Brazilian hegemony across its southern borders. A successful Argentine bid to incorporate Paraguay and Uruguay into a reconstituted Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata (and control of the Platine river network consequently passing into entirely hostile hands) would have threatened to cut communication between the Brazilian province of Mato Grosso and Rio de Janeiro. With river transportation denied, the alternative land routes would require months of travel instead of days. Nor was Brazil keen to share a direct border with Argentina, fearing an increased vulnerability to an invasion by Rosas.|$|E
5|$|Mahayana, writing elsewhere, sees Karman as {{undergoing}} <b>an</b> <b>existential</b> {{quest to}} establish his identity, seemingly finding an answer in the PKI but ultimately becoming trapped by them. Mahayana indicates that a religious message is evident beginning with the novel's opening, in which Tohari provides a four-line quote from an old Javanese text regarding faith and becoming more explicit later on. He finds Karman's dealing with the raftsman Kastagethek while escaping from the government the most explicit expression of Tohari's intent; unlike Karman, Kastagethek is a devout yet simple man who is happy in his poverty, leading Karman to question his own views before ultimately finding his identity in Islam. Mahayana thus argued that Kubah was meant as dawah, or Islamic preaching, with its message that humans should recognise their status as creatures of God conveyed through characters' dialogue and actions.|$|E
5|$|When Turkey {{decided to}} join in the war {{on the side of the}} Central Powers (Germany, Austria-Hungary and Italy), the Ottoman Sultan, Mehmed V. Reshad (1844–1918) {{declared}} a jihad against the Allied Powers (Britain, France and Russia) and issued a fatwa calling on Muslims all around the world to throw their lot with the Caliphate. This move had a huge impact on Muslims throughout the world as the Ottoman Sultan was revered as the Caliph of Islam and long considered by Indian Muslims as the final bulwark of Muslim power following the collapse of the Moghul empire in India. Overnight, Muslims serving under the British Army, such as the sepoys, faced <b>an</b> <b>existential</b> dilemma and their loyalty being torn between their ummah (community, brotherhood) and their British colonial superiors.|$|E

50|$|Rahner's {{particular}} {{interpretation of}} the mode in which grace makes itself present is that grace is a permanent modification of human nature in <b>a</b> supernatural <b>existential</b> (<b>a</b> phrase borrowed from Heidegger). Grace is perceived in light of Christianity as a constitutive element of human existence. For this reason, Rahner denies {{the possibility of a}} state of pure nature (natura pura, human existence without being-involved with grace), which according to him is a counterfactual.|$|R

25|$|Undun is <b>an</b> <b>existential</b> concept album {{about the}} fictional {{character}} Redford Stevens, who {{is named after}} a Sufjan Stevens song. Its reverse-chronological narrative discusses his short, tragic life set in urban poverty. Expanding on the indie influence of the band's How I Got Over (2010), the album's music is characterized by snare-driven beats, neo soul elements, keyboard soundscapes, strings, choral arrangements, and tight dynamics.|$|E

Therefore, on the level of open formulas, independence logic is strictly stronger in expressive power than dependence logic. However, on the level of sentences these logics are equivalent.|$|E

25|$|However, unlike {{transcendental}} Thomism, the metaphysics of Lublin Thomism places {{priority on}} existence (as opposed to essence), making it <b>an</b> <b>existential</b> Thomism that demonstrates consonance with the Thomism of Étienne Gilson. It {{should be noted}} that the phenomenological concerns of the Lublin school are not metaphysical in nature as this would constitute idealism. Rather, they are considerations which are brought into relation with central positions of the school, such as when dealing with modern science, its epistemological value, and its relation to metaphysics.|$|E
25|$|Christine Hayes {{contrasts}} the Book of Esther with apocalyptic writings, the Book of Daniel in particular: both Esther and Daniel depict <b>an</b> <b>existential</b> {{threat to}} the Jewish people, but while Daniel commends the Jews to wait faithfully for God to resolve the crisis, in Esther the crisis is resolved entirely through human action and national solidarity. God, in fact, is not mentioned, Esther is portrayed as assimilated to Persian culture, and Jewish identity {{in the book is}} an ethnic category rather than a religious one.|$|E
25|$|He {{is thought}} to have coined the term, Sunday neurosis.

This arises from <b>an</b> <b>existential</b> vacuum, or feeling of meaninglessness, which is a common phenomenon and is characterised by the subjective state of boredom, apathy, and emptiness. One feels cynical, lacks direction, and questions the point of most of life's activities. (see noogenic neurosis).|$|E
