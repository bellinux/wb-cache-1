5|$|Compared to {{the nurse}} shark, the tawny nurse shark has a more placid {{disposition}} and will often allow divers to touch <b>and</b> <b>play</b> <b>with</b> it. However, it should be accorded respect due to its powerful jaws and sharp teeth. This species is caught by commercial fisheries across most of its range for meat, fins, liver oil, leather, and fishmeal. It is also esteemed as a game fish off Queensland, Australia, and {{is known for its}} habit of spitting water in the faces of its captors. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed the tawny nurse shark as Vulnerable, with subpopulations in several areas already diminished or extirpated.|$|E
5|$|Encounters with tawny nurse sharks {{underwater}} {{indicate a}} more docile demeanor than the similar nurse shark; usually divers {{are able to}} approach the sharks closely and even touch <b>and</b> <b>play</b> <b>with</b> them without incident. However, this species has been infrequently provoked into biting, and merits respect due to its strength, small but sharp teeth, and extremely powerful jaws. Tawny nurse sharks are favored attractions for ecotourist divers off Thailand, the Solomon Islands, and elsewhere. This species also adapts well to captivity and is displayed in public aquaria in Europe, the United States, Okinawa, and Singapore, where they may become tame enough to be hand-fed.|$|E
5|$|In a California forest, a {{group of}} alien botanists land in a spacecraft, {{collecting}} flora samples. When government agents appear on the scene, the aliens flee in their spaceship, leaving {{one of their own}} behind in their haste. At a suburban home, a ten-year-old boy named Elliott is spending time with his brother, Michael, and his friends. As he returns from picking up a pizza, he discovers that something is hiding in their tool shed. The alien promptly flees upon being discovered. Despite his family's disbelief, Elliott leaves Reese's Pieces candy to lure the alien to his house. Before going to sleep, Elliott realizes it is imitating his movements. He feigns illness the next morning to stay home from school <b>and</b> <b>play</b> <b>with</b> it. Later that day, Michael and their five-year-old sister, Gertie, meet it. They decide to keep it hidden from their mother, Mary. When they ask it about its origin, it levitates several balls to represent its solar system and then demonstrates its powers by reviving dead chrysanthemums.|$|E

5|$|Jay Farrar, {{along with}} his {{brothers}} Wade and Dade, played in an early 1980s garage band named The Plebes. Hailing from Belleville, Illinois, The Plebes sought to enter a battle-of-the-bands competition but needed another high school student as a member to perform. They invited Jeff Tweedy, a high school friend of Jay Farrar, to join the band <b>and</b> <b>play</b> <b>with</b> them for the show. Despite a lack of skill with his instrument, Tweedy {{played an important role}} in the band by booking early gigs. While The Plebes had been playing music in a rockabilly style, Tweedy wanted to play punk rock like the music that he originally heard the group perform. This caused tensions between Tweedy and Dade Farrar, who left the band two months after Tweedy joined.|$|E
5|$|Trevor Linden's grandfather, Nick van der Linden, {{emigrated to}} Canada from the Netherlands in 1929. He ran a {{construction}} company until his son Lane, Trevor's father, replaced him in 1979. Trevor {{was born in}} Medicine Hat, Alberta to Lane and Edna Linden. Linden was a skilled athlete; despite hockey being his top priority, he also participated in baseball, golf, volleyball, basketball, and speed skating. An excellent student in school, he was offered a scholarship to Princeton University to play for their hockey team; instead, Linden chose to stay in Medicine Hat <b>and</b> <b>play</b> <b>with</b> the local major junior team, the Medicine Hat Tigers of the WHL. Linden grew up watching the Tigers and idolized Lanny McDonald, who played in Medicine Hat before he joined the NHL.|$|E
5|$|Andrei is {{once again}} at the Andronikov Monastery as famine and war grip the country. He no longer paints and never speaks, and keeps Durochka with him as a fellow {{companion}} in silence. Several refugees discuss the problems in their respective home towns, and one man talks in a broken voice of his escape from Vladimir. He is recognised by a younger monk as the long absent Kirill. He has suffered during his {{time away from the}} monastery and begs the father superior to allow him to return. His wish is granted but he is instructed to copy out the holy scriptures fifteen times in penance. A group of Tatars stops at the monastery while travelling through the region, much to the concern of Andrei and Kirill who experienced their brutality first hand. Durochka is too simple minded to remember what the Tatars did and is fascinated by one of the soldier's shining breastplate. The group taunt <b>and</b> <b>play</b> <b>with</b> her, but the soldier takes a liking to her, putting his horned helmet on her head and dressing her as a bride, finally deciding to take her away with him as his eighth, and only Russian, wife. Andrei attempts to stop her from leaving, but she is determined and rides away with the Tatars. Kirill talks to Andrei {{for the first time since}} they both left the monastery, and he assures him that Durochka won't be in any danger, as harming a holy fool is considered bad luck, and she will be let go. Andrei continues his menial work of carrying large hot stones from a fire with tongs to heat water for the monastery, but drops the stone in the snow.|$|E

5|$|Due to the 1994–95 NHL lockout, Anderson went to Europe to play hockey. He {{played with}} the Augsburger Panther of the Deutsche Eishockey Liga in Germany and the Lukko Rauma of the SM-liiga in Finland, {{as well as the}} Canadian National Team. After the {{lock-out}} was resolved, Anderson {{signed as a free agent}} with the St. Louis Blues and played 42 regular season and playoff games combined. At the end of the season, Anderson did not re-sign with the Blues. After playing part of the next season with Augsburger and the National Team again, Anderson signed with the Canucks as a free agent. His reasons for joining the team were because of former Oiler teammate Esa Tikkanen already playing there, and a desire to finish his career in his hometown. However, Anderson never played for the Canucks as the Oilers picked him up on re-entry waivers. Anderson expressed his disappointment at these turn of events, as he wanted to play in Vancouver instead. He spent 17 games with the Oilers, before being put on waivers that same season. The Blues claimed him, and he spent his last days in the NHL with them. The 1996–97 season saw Anderson return to Europe <b>and</b> <b>play</b> <b>with</b> HC La Chaux-de-Fonds of the National League A in Switzerland and with Bolzano HC of the Alpenliga in Italy.|$|E

25|$|In 2014 and 2015 Super League clubs {{were unhappy}} with the Dual {{registration}} system and wanted to form a Under 23 reserve leagues between the Under 19s and 1st team.

25|$|In aggregations, Indian rhinos {{are often}} friendly. They will often greet {{each other by}} waving or bobbing their heads, {{mounting}} flanks, nuzzling noses, or licking. Rhinos will playfully spar, run around, <b>and</b> <b>play</b> <b>with</b> twigs in their mouths. Adult males are the primary instigators in fights. Fights between dominant males {{are the most common}} cause of rhino mortality, and males are also very aggressive toward females during courtship. Males will chase females over long distances and even attack them face-to-face. Unlike African rhinos, the Indian rhino fights with its incisors, rather than its horns.|$|E

25|$|They were regulars on NBC's Monitor, {{often on}} {{stand-by}} {{to go on}} the air at short notice if the program's planned segments developed problems, and they were also heard in a surprising variety of formats and timeslots, from a 15-minute series in mid-afternoon to their hour-long show aired weeknights just before midnight in 1954-55. During that same period, they did an audience participation game show, Pick <b>and</b> <b>Play</b> <b>with</b> Bob and Ray, which was short-lived. It came at a time when network pages filled seats for radio-TV shows by giving tickets to anyone in the street, and on Pick and Play the two comics were occasionally booed by audience members unfamiliar with the Bob and Ray comedy style.|$|E
25|$|The {{impetus for}} the treaty, {{like that of the}} 1997 Ottawa Treaty to limit landmines, has been concern over the severe damage and risks to civilians from {{explosive}} weapons during and long after attacks. A varying proportion of submunitions dispersed by cluster bombs fail to explode on impact and can lie unexploded for years until disturbed. The sometimes brightly colored munitions are not camouflaged, but have been compared to toys or Easter eggs, attracting children at play. Human rights activists claim that one in four casualties resulting from submunitions that fail to explode on impact are children who often pick up <b>and</b> <b>play</b> <b>with</b> the explosive canisters well after the conflict has ended. The 2006 Lebanon War provided momentum for the campaign to ban cluster bombs. The United Nations estimated that up to 40% of Israeli cluster bomblets failed to explode on impact. Norway organized the independent Oslo process after discussions at the traditional disarmament forum in Geneva fell through in November 2006.|$|E
25|$|Despite his obvious {{moments of}} {{whimsical}} charm and offbeat humour, {{accompanied by his}} manic grin, the Fourth Doctor is more aloof and somber than his previous incarnations. He can become intensely brooding, serious and even callous. He also displays a darker edge to his personality, and in The Invasion of Time he seems to cruelly taunt <b>and</b> <b>play</b> <b>with</b> the Time Lords after his emergency inauguration as President. He also has a strong moral code, as when he faces the dilemma of whether to destroy the Daleks in (Genesis of the Daleks), stating that if he did, he would be no better himself than the Daleks. He is truly appalled at {{the actions of the}} Pirate Captain in The Pirate Planet and refuses to listen to Professor Tryst's attempts to justify drug-running to fund his scientific work (Nightmare of Eden), simply telling him to go away.|$|E
