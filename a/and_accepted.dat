40|$|About the {{expression}} of giving <b>and</b> <b>accepting</b> in Japanese, the differences between honorific and unhonorific expression of giving <b>and</b> <b>accepting</b> verbs {{are very difficult to}} Chinese learners. It's said about {{the expression}} of giving <b>and</b> <b>accepting,</b> that there are seven giving <b>and</b> <b>accepting</b> verbs <b>and</b> these verbs have a complicated system like honorific and unhonorific expression, inside and outside expression in Japanese, but Chinese is very easy and just has one verb without any systems by okutukeiitirou. In fact, because there are honorific and unhonorific expression in Japanese, there is a direction of {{up and down in the}} relationship between giving <b>and</b> <b>accepting.</b> On the other hand, in Chinese, the verb for giving <b>and</b> <b>accepting</b> doesn't have a difference between honorific and unhonorific expressions, so maybe there is no direction up and down just from the verb. In this paper, comparison of Japanese and Chinese about the direction of up and down in the relationship between giving <b>and</b> <b>accepting</b> will be looked at with a focus on the verbs of giving <b>and</b> <b>accepting</b> in Japanese...|$|R
