500|$|Stossel {{intended}} to go work at Seattle Magazine, {{but it had}} gone out of business by the time he graduated. His contacts there, however, got him a job at KGW-TV in Portland, Oregon, where Stossel began as a newsroom gofer, working his way up to researcher and then writer. After a few years, the news director told Stossel to go on the air and read what he wrote. Stossel, who confesses to having been frightened of being on the air, has expressed embarrassment at watching videos of his early performances. Nonetheless, Stossel says his fear spurred him to improve, examining broadcasts of David Brinkley and Jack Perkins to imitate them. Stossel also struggled with a stuttering problem he had harbored since childhood. After a few years of on-air reporting, Stossel was hired by WCBS-TV in New York City, by Ed Joyce, the same news director who hired <b>Arnold</b> <b>Diaz,</b> Linda Ellerbee, Dave Marash, Joel Siegel and Lynn Sherr. Stossel was disappointed at CBS, feeling that the journalism was of a lower quality than in Portland, and disliking the lesser quantity of time devoted to research there. Stossel cites union work rules that discouraged the extra work that Stossel felt allowed employees to be creative, which he says represented his [...] "first real introduction to the deals made by special interests". Stossel also [...] "hated" [...] Joyce, who he felt was [...] "cold and critical", though Stossel credits Joyce with allowing him the freedom to pursue his own story ideas, and with recommending the Hollins Communications Research Institute in Roanoke, Virginia, that largely cured Stossel's stuttering problem.|$|E

Vieira, Pinkston and Guida later {{moved to the}} CBS network. Vieira later moved to NBC where she co-hosted the morning show Today until leaving and being replaced with Ann Curry.|$|E
2500|$|In January 2011, Stack {{was criticized}} {{in one of}} <b>Arnold</b> <b>Díaz's</b> [...] "Shame Shame Shame" [...] {{segments}} for WNYW Fox 5 for allowing the use of city-owned vehicles by his ex-wife, Katia Stack. Katia {{is the director of}} The Union City Day Care Program, a private organization with a $6 million budget, and was assigned by Mayor Stack a car owned by the Union City Police Department, as well as free gas and insurance. The Day Care Program also has at least one other public vehicle. In addition, Díaz reported that the day care center itself does not pay any rent for the city building in which it is housed. Stack stated that his administration did nothing wrong, and that the center's housing and vehicle status was initiated before he became mayor in 2000, but according to Díaz, WNYW did not receive requested documentation of this fact. Díaz states that the car Katia Stack had been using had been returned to the police department parking lot after their investigation began, and that she reimbursed the city for the cost of gas and insurance.|$|R
50|$|<b>Arnold</b> <b>Diaz</b> (born July 4, 1949 in Brooklyn, New York) is an American {{television}} consumer watchdog journalist, of Puerto Rican descent, who {{is currently}} employed by WPIX-TV in New York. Diaz is famous for his Shame on You series of reports which he did on WCBS-TV for over twenty years. Diaz also worked for ABC News and WNYW in similar capacities, with the latter taking a page from WCBS and naming the segment Shame Shame Shame. He focuses most of his reports on exposing wrongdoings and incompetence by private industry and government agencies. His reports have led to jail time {{for a number of}} scam artists.|$|E
5000|$|After Doctor's arrival, WCBS {{placed a}} revived {{emphasis}} on hard news, {{while attempting to}} revive some elements of its glory days. For instance, in 2003 <b>Arnold</b> <b>Diaz</b> rejoined the station to revive [...] "Shame on You", an Emmy Award-winning series of investigative segments. He had worked at the station from 1973 to 1995, leaving to serve a similar investigative role at ABC News. In December 2005, Diaz once again departed, this time leaving for WNYW. Another segment was [...] "Eat at Your Own Risk", which highlighted unsafe conditions at New York-area restaurants. Ironically, the cafeteria at the CBS Broadcast Center was cited for violations by the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. Violations included the presence of rats and roaches, as well as food temperature issues.|$|E
50|$|On September 12, 2011, WPIX {{restored}} {{an early}} evening newscast to its weeknight schedule with {{the debut of}} an hour-long 5 p.m. broadcast, which was originally aimed at {{women between the ages}} of 18 and 49. On December 19, 2012, Jodi Applegate left WPIX, to prepare for the birth of her child through a gestational surrogate. Morning anchor Tamsen Fadal was later named her replacement; the station later restored a two-anchor format with the hiring of WNBC sports anchor Scott Stanford as Fadal's co-anchor on the 5pm and 10pm newscasts in September 2013. In March 2014, WPIX hired consumer reporter <b>Arnold</b> <b>Diaz</b> (who was fired by WNYW two months earlier due to the shutdown of its consumer investigative unit) to head up a new four-person investigative unit. On April 5, 2014, WPIX moved its weekend early evening newscast one hour earlier, from 6 to 5 p.m.|$|E
