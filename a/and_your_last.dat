60|$|I {{must say}} you tax me very unfairly {{with being a}} bad correspondent. I wrote you twice since we parted, <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>last</b> letter was only your second. Besides, I have nothing to tell you. There is really nothing to {{interest}} you.|$|E

She says the officers are great, and gay, and of soft speech; but they make me shudder, for their business is to kill their fellow-creatures.

6000|$|... "It {{is because}} I have {{understood}} you, Sir, that I go. I have deserved your anger, and have submitted without a murmur {{to all that}} it could inflict. If you see in my conduct towards you no mitigation of my offence; if you cannot view the shame and wrong inflicted on me, with such grief as may have some pity mixed with it--I have, I think, the right to ask that your contempt may be silent, <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>last</b> words to me, not words of insult." ...|$|E

I am the {{administrator}} of the justice of the Republic. The life of yourself and your family is in my hands: yonder man, who follows me, is the executor of the law; he has rid the nation of hundreds of wretches like yourself. A single word from me, and your doom is sealed without hope, <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>last</b> hour is come. Ho! Gregoire!" [...] shouted he; [...] "is all ready?" ...|$|E

You had more courage, even, than I, because you ran a risk I never did. But here you are, free, with the whole world before you, <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>last</b> danger disappearing with the {{knowledge}} that I am ready to be your friend and am sensible about everything that has happened. This ought to be an immense relief to you, Philip. You ought to be the happiest man on earth. And there you sit, looking like a death's-head! Look at me for a moment like a human being, can't you? Drink some more wine. There must be some strength, some manhood about you somewhere, or you couldn't have done what you have done." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{came here}} six years ago, a broken, ruined, and disgraced man. I had no {{ambition}} but to hide myself from all {{who had known}} me, from that brother whose wife I had stolen, and whose home I had broken up--from you--you, Julie! you <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>last</b> lover--from the recollection of your double treachery!" [...] He had raised his voice here, but was checked by the unflinching eye and cautionary gesture of the woman before him. [...] "When you abandoned me in St. Louis, I {{had no choice but}} death or a second exile. I could not return to Switzerland, I could not live in the sickening shadow of my crime and its bitter punishment. I came here. My education, my knowledge of the language stood me in good stead. I might have been a rich man, I might have been an influential one, but I only used my opportunities for the bare necessaries of life and the means to forget my trouble in dissipation. I became a drudge by day, a gambler by night. I was always a gentleman. Men thought me crazy, an enthusiast, but they learned to respect me. Traitor as I was in a larger trust, no one doubted my honour or dared to question my integrity. But bah! what is this to you? You!" ...|$|E
60|$|I can {{remember}} her all through her beautiful life {{for she was}} but a girl when she married, and little more when I can first recall her busy fingers and her gentle voice. I see her as a lovely woman with kind, dove's eyes, somewhat short of stature it is true, but carrying herself very bravely. In my memories of those days she is clad always in some purple shimmering stuff, with a white kerchief round her long white neck, and I see her fingers turning and darting as she works at her knitting. I see her again in her middle years, sweet and loving, planning, contriving, achieving, with the few shillings a day of a lieutenant's pay on which to support the cottage at Friar's Oak, and to keep a fair face to the world. And now, if I do but step into the parlour, I can see her once more, with over eighty years of saintly life behind her, silver-haired, placid-faced, with her dainty ribboned cap, her gold-rimmed glasses, and her woolly shawl with the blue border. I loved her young and I love her old, and when she goes she will take something with her which {{nothing in the world}} can ever make good to me again. You may have many friends, you who read this, and you may chance to marry more than once, but your mother is your first <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>last.</b> Cherish her, then, whilst you may, for the day will come when every hasty deed or heedless word will come back with its sting to hive in your own heart.|$|E

6000|$|... "Another {{advantage}} of being a good shot--I mean a really good shot--is that, if you get forced into an affair, and are desirous of giving a lesson, but no more, to an opponent, you have it in your power to wing him; whereas, if you are only a tolerably good shot, you can't pick <b>your</b> spot, <b>and</b> may--to <b>your</b> <b>lasting</b> regret--kill him.|$|R
6000|$|She went on, eagerly: [...] "I {{wish you}} could come to believe. Your sister said <b>your</b> mother <b>and</b> <b>your</b> uncle spoke <b>last</b> night. Why can't you accept the faith?" ...|$|R

"There is no {{ritual that}} I fear, {{so long as}} it be that it is for <b>your</b> good, <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>lasting</b> {{happiness}}. <b>And</b> if the end of it be that I may call you mine, there is no horror in life or death that I shall not gladly face.

It is but a poor word to express what I long for! I shall shirk nothing which may come to me from this or any other world, {{so long as it}} is to make you mine!"
