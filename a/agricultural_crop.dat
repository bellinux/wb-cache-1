40|$|Beneficial insects {{can provide}} {{valuable}} ecosystem {{services such as}} pest control and pollination for <b>agricultural</b> <b>crops,</b> but <b>agricultural</b> <b>crops</b> often provide limited food and refuge resources necessary to these beneficial insects.

25|$|Agriculture, while of {{shrinking}} {{importance to}} the economy {{over the past four}} decades, offers part-time employment to a sizeable portion of the populace. Rice is the main <b>agricultural</b> <b>crop,</b> followed by areca, cashew and coconut. Fishing employs about 40,000 people, though recent official figures indicate a decline of the importance of this sector and also a fall in catch, due perhaps, to traditional fishing giving way to large-scale mechanised trawling.|$|E
25|$|While the Carthaginians and Phoenicians {{were the}} first to {{introduce}} viticulture to Spain, Rome's influential wine technology and the development of road networks brought new economic opportunities to the region, elevating grapes from a private <b>agricultural</b> <b>crop</b> to an important component of a viable commercial enterprise. Spanish wine was in Bordeaux before the region produced its own. French historian Roger Dion has suggested that the balisca vine (common in Spain's northern provinces, particularly Rioja) was brought from Rioja to plant the first Roman vineyards of Bordeaux.|$|E
25|$|Vitamin E was co-discovered by UA Agricultural Chemistry Professor Barnett Sure (1920–51). Sure, {{along with}} fellow {{professor}} Marinus C. Kik (1927–67) made major advances in nutrition science during their long tenures at the University of Arkansas. Sure co-discovered vitamin E, and extended {{knowledge of how}} vitamin E, amino acids and B-vitamins function on reproduction and lactation. Kik developed the process for parboiling rice (a major <b>agricultural</b> <b>crop</b> in the state) to increase retention of vitamins and shorten cooking time. He documented benefits of adding fish and chicken to rice and grain diets to provide adequate protein for a growing world population. Sure and Kik were Agricultural Experiment Station scientists and professors in the UA Department of Agricultural Chemistry, which merged in 1964 with Home Economics, now the School of Human Environmental Sciences.|$|E

30|$|Insurance {{companies}} will provide cover for anything {{if they can}} make a profit from it. However, unlike residential real estate, timber stands grow in volume and vary in value. Also, their rotation length is much longer than that of <b>agricultural</b> <b>crops.</b> Consequently, the valuation of standing timber must take tree growth rates and market conditions into consideration, which might be more complicated than valuing residential real estates or <b>agricultural</b> <b>crops.</b> Further, forests vary in age and species composition and occupy larger areas than buildings and <b>agricultural</b> <b>crops.</b> This makes it harder to value them and to assess the risks associated with various natural disasters. Finally, insurance companies need to have models derived from disaggregated and reliable data that allow them to estimate the probability of occurrence of various disasters and these are lacking of forestry. All these factors mean that the transaction costs of providing insurance cover for standing timber are higher than those for buildings or <b>agricultural</b> <b>crops.</b> All else being equal, the insurance premiums for standing timber would be consequently higher than those set for real estate or <b>agricultural</b> <b>crops.</b> Also, as timber takes many years to grow, the structural or sector-specific risk in forests could be higher than for <b>agricultural</b> <b>crops,</b> although the amount of accumulative risk in a rotation may be comparable.|$|R
