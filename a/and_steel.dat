5|$|However, despite Ohio's large {{presence}} in the iron <b>and</b> <b>steel</b> market, employment rates have declined in Ohio, generally attributed to weakening national economy. Between 1998 and 2005, the number of Ohio iron <b>and</b> <b>steel</b> industry workers decreased from 52,700 to 34,000. The Ohio Department of Development predicts the decreases will continue in coming years. The average annual salary for iron <b>and</b> <b>steel</b> industry workers in Ohio was $59,686, compared the national industry average of $53,352.|$|E

5|$|Among the ECSC's {{greatest}} achievements {{are those}} on welfare issues. Some mines, for example, were clearly unsustainable without government subsidies. Some miners had extremely poor housing. Over 15 years it financed 112,500 flats for workers, paying US$1,770 per flat, enabling workers {{to buy a}} home they could not have otherwise afforded. The ECSC also paid half the occupational redeployment costs of those workers who have lost their jobs as coal <b>and</b> <b>steel</b> facilities began to close down. Combined with regional redevelopment aid the ECSC spent $150million creating 100,000 jobs, a third of which were for unemployed coal <b>and</b> <b>steel</b> workers. The welfare guarantees invented by the ECSC were extended to workers outside the coal <b>and</b> <b>steel</b> sector by some of its members.|$|E
