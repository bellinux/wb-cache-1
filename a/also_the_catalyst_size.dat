40|$|Considerable {{progress}} has been achieved in understanding three-phase reactors {{from the point of}} view of kinetic theory. In a paper in press for publication in Chemical Engineering Science (Wu and Gidaspow, 1999) we have obtained a complete numerical solution of bubble column reactors. In view of the complexity of the simulation a better understanding of the processes using simplified analytical solutions is required. Such analytical solutions are presented in the attached paper, Large Scale Oscillations or Gravity Waves in Risers and Bubbling Beds. This paper presents analytical solutions for bubbling frequencies and standing wave flow patterns. The flow patterns in operating slurry bubble column reactors are not optimum. They involve upflow in the center and downflow at the walls. It may be possible to control flow patterns by proper redistribution of heat exchangers in slurry bubble column reactors. We <b>also</b> believe that <b>the</b> <b>catalyst</b> <b>size</b> in operating slurry bubble column reactors is not optimum. To obtain an optimum size we are following up on the observation of George Cody of Exxon who reported a maximum granular temperature (random particle kinetic energy) for a particle size of 90 microns. The attached paper, Turbulence of Particles in a CFB and Slurry Bubble Columns Using Kinetic Theory, supports George Cody's observations. However, our explanation for the existence of the maximum in granular temperature differs from that proposed by George Cody. Further computer simulations and experiments involving measurements of granular temperature are needed to obtain a sound theoretical explanation for the possible existence of an optimum <b>catalyst</b> <b>size...</b>|$|R

The technique {{is based on}} the combined flow and radiation (such as microwave, thermal or UV) induced co-assembly of <b>the</b> support and <b>catalyst</b> precursors forming nano-reactors, followed by <b>catalyst</b> precursor decomposition. <b>The</b> transformation from the precursor to supported catalyst oxide state can be controlled from a few seconds to several minutes. The resulting nano-structured micro-porous silica supported catalyst system has a surface area approaching 300 m 2 /g and X-ray Diffraction (XRD) -based <b>catalyst</b> <b>size</b> controlled in <b>the</b> range of 1 – 10 nm in which <b>the</b> <b>catalyst</b> structure appears as lamellar sheets sandwiched between <b>the</b> <b>catalyst</b> support. These catalyst characteristics are dependent primarily on the processing history as well as <b>the</b> <b>catalyst</b> (Fe, Co and Ni studied) when the catalyst/support molar ratio is typically 0. 1 – 2. In addition, Ca, Mn and Cu were used as co-catalysts with Fe and Co in the evaluation of <b>the</b> mechanism of <b>catalyst</b> generation. Based on extensive XRD, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) studies, the micro- and nano-structure of <b>the</b> <b>catalyst</b> system were evaluated. It was found that <b>the</b> <b>catalyst</b> and silica support form extensive 0. 6 – 2 nm thick lamellar sheets of 10 – 100 nm planar dimensions. In these lamellae, the alternate silica support and catalyst layer appear {{in the form of a}} bar-code structure. When these lamellae structures pack, they form the walls of a micro-porous catalyst system which typically has a density of 0. 2 g/cm 3. A tentative mechanism of catalyst nano-structure formation is provided based on the rheology and fluid mechanics of the catalyst/support precursor fluid as well as co-assembly nano-reactor formation during processing. In order to achieve these structures and characteristics, catalyst support must be in the form of silane coated silica nano-particles dispersed in water which <b>also</b> contains <b>the</b> <b>catalyst</b> precursor nitrate salt. This support-catalyst precursor fluid must have a sufficiently low viscosity but high elastic modulus (high extensional viscosity) to form films and bubbles when exposed to processing energy sources such as microwave, thermal, ultra-sound or UV-radiation or their combination. The micro-to-nano structures of <b>the</b> <b>catalyst</b> system are essentially formed at an early stage of energy input. It is shown that the primary particles of silica are transformed to a proto-silica particle state and form lamellar structures with <b>the</b> <b>catalyst</b> precursor.

30|$|Since {{the first}} report by Iijima in 1991 [1], carbon {{nanotubes}} (CNTs) have attracted tremendous attentions both for fundamental research and potential applications in many fields [2, 3, 4]. Especially, the single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) are much more interesting for scientists due to their unique one-dimensional structure, mechanical, and electrical properties [5]. SWNTs consist of a single graphite sheet seamlessly rolled into cylindrical tube. They can be grown by several methods including arc discharge [6], laser ablation [7], and chemical vapor deposition (CVD) [8]. Among these methods, CVD is the most promising method for low-cost and large-scale production of highly pure nanotubes. SWNTs can be grown in high temperature using carbon-containing molecules such as methane, ethane, or carbon monoxide [9] as carbon sources {{with the help of}} catalytic particles, usually metal nanoparticles (NPs) such as Fe, Co, Ni, and their alloys. In most cases, only SWNTs with different chiralities can be generated, this is not beneficial for their applications particularly for electronic devices application because the electrical properties of the SWNTs depend not only on their structure (chirality) [10, 11] but also on their diameter [12]. Therefore, how to take effective control of the chirality and diameter is still a goal of current research [13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25]. Basically, the diameter of SWNTs depends on <b>the</b> <b>size</b> of <b>the</b> <b>catalyst.</b> <b>The</b> <b>catalyst</b> can be pre-obtained by either chemical method (nanoparticles in solution) or physical methods (such as arc plasma or sputtering deposition or thermal treatment of thin film of catalyst on substrate). How to prepare uniform <b>catalyst</b> <b>size</b> is <b>the</b> key for controlling the diameter of SWNTs. In the past decades, many efforts have been put on to control <b>the</b> <b>catalyst</b> <b>size</b> for <b>the</b> control of the SWNTs diameter. For example, Dai and Pfefferle got uniform diameter SWNTs using polyamidoamine dendrimer [26] or MCM- 41 [27] as catalyst carriers, respectively. Hyon et al. reported one way to control the diameter of the SWNTs by Langmuir–Blodgett film [28]. Jie used identical metal-containing molecular nanoclusters as <b>catalysts</b> and investigated <b>the</b> relationship between the diameter of SWNTs and carbon feeding [29, 30]. Size-separated ferritin-based Fe catalyst [31], inorganic oxides nanoparticles with high melting point such as SiO 2, TiO 2, Al 2 O 3 are also used as catalysts for growing SWNTs [32, 33, 34]. Arc plasma deposition [35] or floating catalyst method [36] are applied to control the size and density of <b>the</b> <b>catalysts</b> for growing either vertically aligned SWNT forest or narrowing the SWNT diameter distribution. Although significant progress has been made, to develop a facile technology to control accurately the diameters of SWNTs and to understand the relationship between the diameters of SWNTs and <b>the</b> <b>catalyst</b> <b>size</b> still remains as a challenge. It is believed that uniform NPs individually dispersed on the substrate before CNTs growth at high temperature is one of the keys for controlling the diameters of <b>the</b> SWNTs. However, <b>catalyst</b> NPs particularly metal NPs tend to aggregate at high temperature. In this article, we report a facile approach to control the diameter of SWNTs by improving the dispersion of the Fe/Mo NPs on silicon wafers with different surface properties by chemical modification with 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 3 -hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS).|$|R

With dif-ferent authors conducting experiments still to validate the kinetic expressions for the shift reaction, continuous research on different composition and new catalysts are also reported periodically. Moreover <b>the</b> commercial <b>catalyst</b> manufacturers seldom provide information on <b>the</b> <b>catalyst.</b> This makes <b>the</b> task of designers diffi-cult to model the shift reaction. This review provides a consolidated listing of the various important kinetic expressions published for both the high temperature and the low temperature water gas shift reaction along with the details of <b>the</b> <b>catalysts</b> and <b>the</b> operating conditions at which they have been validated...|$|R
