The AOX-deficient strain displays {{a doubling of}} the cell volume and biomass without any <b>alteration</b> <b>of</b> the <b>generation</b> time, a significantly higher ROS production, no change in total respiration rate, and a slight decrease of the photosynthesis efficiency. In order to identify the molecular adaptation underlying these phenotypical effects, we carried out a comparative proteomic study {{at the level of}} the mitochondrial and cellular soluble proteomes. Our results indicate a strong up-regulation of the ROS scavenging systems and important modifications of proteins involved in the primary metabolism, namely an increase of enzymes involved in anabolic pathways and a concomitant general down-regulation of enzymes of the main catabolic pathways.

Here, we propose a temporal sequence of events in the HCV-infected cell whereby the primary <b>alteration</b> consists <b>of</b> a release of Ca(2 +) from the endoplasmic reticulum, followed by uptake into mitochondria. This causes successive mitochondrial <b>alterations</b> comprising <b>generation</b> <b>of</b> reactive oxygen and nitrogen species and impairment of the oxidative phosphorylation.

5000|$|C. venosum is at {{no threat}} of {{worldwide}} extinction, but extreme events like large-scale wildfires can reduce population sizes and exacerbate {{the effect of}} anthropogenic disturbances. Due to its heavy reliance on D. antartica the species has a limited dispersion rate which can be halted by dry landscapes acting as geological boundaries.Like other ferns, C. venosum undergoes <b>alteration</b> <b>of</b> <b>generations</b> which consists of two sexual stages - the diploid sporophyte and the haploid gametophyte. The sporophyte stage of C. venosum consists of adult ferns which release a numerous amount of spores. These spores then settle on the trunks of D. antartica in a moist and sheltered habitat. Spores germinate {{within a few days}} and form a one cell layer thick, heart-shaped prothallus. In ferns, the time required for the prothallus to sexually mature may require several months to several years of development. The male antheridia matures and releases its gametes earlier than the female archegonia in an effort to avoid self fertilisation. The prothallus can reproduce asexally through the release of gemmae which on germination produce rhizoids, filaments and antheridia or more gemmae. The prothallus can also reproduce itself vegetatively by regeneration. Once established, C. venosum spreads to surrounding substrate through its extensively creeping rhizomes.|$|E
40|$|Gene and genome duplications {{provide a}} {{playground}} for various selective pressures and {{contribute significantly to}} genome complexity. It is assumed that the genomes of all major eukaryotic lineages possess duplicated regions that result from gene and genome duplication. There {{is evidence that the}} model plant Arabidopsis has been subjected to at least three whole genome duplication events over the last 150 - 200 million years. As a result, many cellular processes are governed by redundantly acting gene families. Plants pass through two distinct life phases with a haploid gametophytic alternating with a diploid sporophytic generation. This ontogenetic difference in gene copy number has important implications for the outcome of deleterious mutations, which are masked by the second gene copy in diploid systems but expressed in a dominant fashion in haploid organisms. As a consequence, maintaining the activity of duplicated genes might be particularly advantageous during the haploid gametophytic generation. Here, we describe the distinctive features associated with the <b>alteration</b> <b>of</b> <b>generations</b> and discuss how activity profiles of duplicated genes might get modulated in a life-phase dependent fashion to adjust redundancy levels in haploid and diploid tissues...|$|E
40|$|Mitochondrial {{alteration}} {{has been}} long proposed {{to play a}} major role in tumorigenesis. Recently, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations have been found in a variety of cancer cells. In this study, we examined the contribution of mtDNA mutation and mitochondrial dysfunction in tumorigenesis first using human cell lines carrying a frame-shift at NADH dehydrogenase (respiratory complex I) subunit 5 gene (ND 5); the same homoplasmic mutation was also identified in a human colorectal cancer cell line earlier. With increasing mutant ND 5 mtDNA content, respiratory function including oxygen consumption and ATP generation through oxidative phosphorylation declined progressively, while lactate production and dependence on glucose increased. Interestingly, the reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and apoptosis exhibited antagonistic pleiotropy associated with mitochondrial defects. Furthermore, the anchorage-dependence phenotype and tumor-forming capacity of cells carrying wild-type and mutant mtDNA were tested by growth assay in soft agar and subcutaneous implantation of the cells in nude mice. Surprisingly, the cell line carrying the heteroplasmic ND 5 mtDNA mutation showed significantly enhanced tumor growth, while cells with homoplasmic form of the same mutation inhibited tumor formation. Similar results were obtained from the analysis of a series of mouse cell lines carrying a nonsense mutation at ND 5 gene. Our results indicate that the mtDNA mutations might play an important role in the early stage of cancer development, possibly through <b>alteration</b> <b>of</b> ROS <b>generation</b> and apoptosis...|$|R
40|$|Energy {{analysis}} {{is an important}} tool to improve energy efficiency of a thermodynamic system. The conventional method of energy {{analysis is}} based on the first law of thermodynamics, which focuses on conservation of energy. The limitation of this analysis {{is that it does not}} take into account properties of the system environment, or degradation of the energy quality through dissipative processes. Exergy analysis is very effective in this regard, as it deals with the usable energy with reference to environment. It {{is based on the}} second law of thermodynamics. The main purpose of exergy analysis is to identify where and how much exergy is destroyed. This destruction of exergy in a process is proportional to the entropy generation in it, which accounts for the inefficiencies due to irreversibility. This research conducts exergy analysis in one unit of a coal-fired power plant in Central Queensland, Australia. The exergy analysis identifies where and how much exergy is destroyed in the system and its components. Based on the analysis, it assesses different options to improve the efficiency of the system. It shows that only a small amount of useful energy can be recovered through a heat recovery system. Substantial improvement to the thermodynamic cycle is possible, but it requires considerable <b>alteration</b> <b>of</b> the power <b>generation</b> system...|$|R

40|$|Methamphetamine (METH) {{is a drug}} {{of abuse}} with {{neurotoxic}} and vascular effects that may be mediated by reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, potential sources <b>of</b> METH-induced <b>generation</b> <b>of</b> ROS are not fully understood. This study {{is focused on the}} role of NAD(P) H oxidase (NOX) in METH-induced dysfunction of brain endothelial cells. Treatment with METH induced a time-dependent increase in phosphorylation of NOX subunit p 47, followed by its binding with gp 91 and p 22, and the formation of an active NOX com-plex. An increase in NOX activity was associated with elevated production <b>of</b> ROS, <b>alterations</b> <b>of</b> occludin levels and increased transendothelial migration of monocytes. Inhibition of NOX by NSC 23766 attenuated METH-induced ROS generation, changes in occludin protein levels and monocyte migration. Because an active NOX complex is localized to caveolae, we next evaluated the role of caveolae in METH-mediated toxicity to brain endothelial cells. Treatment with METH induced phosphorylation of ERK 1 / 2 and caveolin- 1 protein. Inhibition of ERK 1 / 2 activity or caveolin- 1 silencing protected against METH-induced <b>alterations</b> <b>of</b> occludin levels. These findings indicate an important role of NOX and functional caveolae in METH-induced oxidative stress in brain endothelial cells that contribute to the subsequent <b>alterations</b> <b>of</b> occludin levels and transendothelial migration of inflammatory cells...|$|R
40|$|Intracellular {{glutathione}} influences collagen generation by mesangial cells. The cellular redox {{state is}} altered {{in a number}} of pathological conditions, including various forms of glomerular injury and diabetes. For example, glucose, via the pentose phosphate pathway generates NADPH, which maintains glutathione (GSH) (part of a major intracellular reducing system) in its reduced state. GSH in turn influences the activity of transcription factors on gene expression. We therefore examined whether changes in cellular GSH influence total collagen synthesis and mRNA levels for collagen I, collagen IV and TGF-β in SV- 40 transformed mouse mesangial cells (MC) maintained in either 5 or 25 mM glucose media. Total intracellular GSH was increased by N-acetylcysteine (NAC; 10 mM) or decreased with the GSH synthesis inhibitor buthionine sulfoximine (BSO; 0. 2 mM) in MC. NAC increased 3 H-proline incorporation into collagenase-sensitive protein while BSO decreased it under both glucose conditions. The presence of BSO did not reverse the increased collagen synthesis seen in the NAC stimulated cells. Northern blot analysis showed increased mRNA levels for collagen I, collagen IV and TGF-β in cells grown in high glucose (25 mM). NAC increased the mRNA for all three compounds while BSO alone had no effect on these mRNA levels. However, BSO reversed the increased mRNA levels for collagen I, IV and TGF-β seen in the presence of NAC. These findings suggest that the cellular redox state may influence gene transcription in MC, and may have implications in explaining injury-associated <b>alterations</b> <b>of</b> mesangial matrix <b>generation...</b>|$|R

Organic anion transporting polypeptides (human: OATPs, rodent: Oatps) are important for uptake of endogenous and exogenous compounds into hepatocytes.

In this study, we investigated the <b>alteration</b> <b>of</b> OATPs/Oatps expression levels and function by oxidative stress, and the effect <b>of</b> <b>alteration</b> <b>of</b> those on pharmacokinetics of a typical OATPs/Oatps substrate pravastatin. OATPs/Oatps expression levels and function were altered by H 2 O 2 -induced oxidative stress in in vitro experiments. The <b>alteration</b> <b>of</b> Oatps expression by oxidative stress also occurred in in vivo experiments. Oatp 1 a 1, Oatp 1 a 4 and Oatp 1 b 2 expression in the liver were decreased in rats fed powdery diet containing 2 % inosine, which induces oxidative stress through activation of xanthine oxidase, for 1 day. The decrease in Oatps expression levels by oxidative stress caused the suppression of pravastatin uptake to the liver, and resulted in high plasma concentration of pravastatin and low biliary excretion. In conclusion, oxidative stress induces <b>alteration</b> <b>of</b> OATPs/Oatps expression and function in hepatocytes, resulting in <b>alteration</b> <b>of</b> pharmacokinetics of their substrates.
