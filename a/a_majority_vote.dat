5|$|The National Assembly makes legislation. The body {{consists}} of 180 {{members who are}} elected for five-year terms and meet three times per year. Laws are passed on <b>a</b> <b>majority</b> <b>vote.</b> Rarely has the assembly changed or blocked legislation proposed by the president.|$|E

5|$|Like other U.S. states, the {{structure}} of the government of South Dakota follows the same separation of powers as the federal government, with executive, legislative, and judicial branches. The structure of the state government is laid out in the Constitution of South Dakota, the highest law in the state. The constitution may be amended by <b>a</b> <b>majority</b> <b>vote</b> of both houses of the legislature, or by voter initiative.|$|E

50|$|Municipal {{government}} is always {{elected by the}} citizens, mostly in <b>a</b> <b>majority</b> <b>voting</b> with some exceptions. Those municipal councils have about five to nine members. Loosely one can say, the smaller the town, the lesser party members are in the council. The leader of the council is mostly also voted by the citizens in <b>a</b> <b>majority</b> <b>voting.</b>|$|R

5|$|The 1799 {{constitution}} contained, for {{the first}} time, {{the power of the}} governor to veto legislation; this power was substantially similar to, and probably based upon, that found in the 1792 New Hampshire Constitution and the 1798 Georgia Constitution. The governor's veto can be overridden by <b>a</b> <b>majority</b> <b>vote</b> of both houses of the legislature. The 1891 constitution empowered the governor with a line-item veto, but its use was forbidden on constitutional amendments and laws related to the classification of property for tax purposes.|$|E
5|$|The Croatian {{constitution}} and legislation provides for regular {{elections for the}} office of the President of the Republic, parliamentary, county prefects, county assemblies, city and municipal mayors and city and municipal councils. The President of the Republic is elected to a five-year term by a direct vote of all citizens of Croatia. <b>A</b> <b>majority</b> <b>vote</b> is required to win. A runoff election round is held in cases where no candidate secures the majority {{in the first round of}} voting. The presidential elections are regulated by the {{constitution and}} dedicated legislation; the latter defines technical details, appeals and similar issues.|$|E
5|$|The Nobel Committee then {{prepares a}} report {{reflecting}} {{the advice of}} experts in the relevant fields. This, along with the list of preliminary candidates, is submitted to the prize-awarding institutions. The institutions meet to choose the laureate or laureates in each field by <b>a</b> <b>majority</b> <b>vote.</b> Their decision, which cannot be appealed, is announced immediately after the vote. A maximum of three laureates and two different works may be selected per award. Except for the Peace Prize, which can be awarded to institutions, the awards can only be given to individuals.|$|E

5|$|The {{constitution}} did {{not specify}} whether a plurality or <b>a</b> <b>majority</b> <b>vote</b> was required to elect the governor, but the electors, following a common practice of other states, decided to hold a second vote between Logan and Garrard {{in order to achieve}} a majority. Most of Todd's electors supported Garrard on the second vote, giving him a majority. In a letter dated May 17, 1796, Kentucky Secretary of State James Brown certified Garrard's election, and Governor Shelby sent him a letter of congratulations on his election on May 27.|$|E
5|$|When the General Assembly {{votes on}} {{important}} questions, {{a two-thirds majority}} of those present and voting is required. Examples of important questions include recommendations on peace and security; election of members to organs; admission, suspension, and expulsion of members; and budgetary matters. All other questions are decided by <b>a</b> <b>majority</b> <b>vote.</b> Each member country has one vote. Apart from approval of budgetary matters, resolutions are not binding on the members. The Assembly may make recommendations on any matters {{within the scope of}} the UN, except matters of peace and security that are under consideration by the Security Council.|$|E
5|$|Woods {{decided the}} jury for the Broadway run would employ some jury service {{rules of the}} New York courts. One such rule was the payment of jurors three dollars per day for their participation, which meant the {{selected}} audience members profited by at least 25 cents after subtracting the ticket price. Another was that only men could serve on a jury, although Woods made exceptions, for example at the performance Keller attended. He later loosened the rule to allow women jurors at matinee performances twice a week. Unlike a normal criminal trial, verdicts required only <b>a</b> <b>majority</b> <b>vote</b> rather than unanimity.|$|E

5|$|In Eastern Europe, socialist governments fell to {{capitalist}} reformers between 1989 and 1991 {{and many}} Western observers expected {{the same in}} Cuba. Increasingly isolated, Cuba improved relations with Manuel Noriega's right-wing government in Panama – despite Castro's personal hatred of Noriega – but it was overthrown in a U.S. invasion in December 1989. In February 1990, Castro's allies in Nicaragua, President Daniel Ortega and the Sandinistas, were defeated by the U.S.-funded National Opposition Union in an election. With {{the collapse of the}} Soviet bloc, the U.S. secured <b>a</b> <b>majority</b> <b>vote</b> for a resolution condemning Cuba's human rights violations at the United Nations Human Rights Commission in Geneva, Switzerland. Cuba asserted that this was a manifestation of U.S. hegemony, and refused to allow an investigative delegation to enter the country.|$|E
5|$|Justices are {{appointed}} to {{a term that}} could potentially last for ten years. Once a new justice is chosen, he may serve {{for two years before}} being subjected to a retention election held during the first statewide election following the completion of the justice's second year in office. The justice is listed on the ballot with the option to be retained or to be rejected from the Court. If retained, the justice may serve the remainder of his ten-year term. When a term is completed, the justice must be reappointed with the same process originally used to appoint him to remain on the Court. <b>A</b> <b>majority</b> <b>vote</b> of both houses of the Indiana General Assembly may impeach a justice for misconduct. It is mandatory for a justice to retire at age seventy-five, even if their term is incomplete.|$|E
5|$|On August 27, 2013, Hickenlooper {{asked the}} Colorado Supreme Court to clarify if a voter had {{to vote for}} recall in order {{to vote for a}} {{replacement}} candidate. At the same time, Libertarian Jan Brooks turned in petitions to be on the ballot against Morse while Democrat Richard Anglund announced his write-in candidacy against Giron. On August 28, the Supreme Court ruled that a voter did not have to vote to recall in order to vote for a replacement, but that the Senators could only be recalled by <b>a</b> <b>majority</b> <b>vote.</b> Secretary of State Gessler announced that Brooks did not have sufficient signatures to qualify for the ballot, leaving only Republican opponents on the ballot.|$|E

5|$|Stalwarts, led by Grant's old {{political}} ally, Roscoe Conkling, saw the ex-president's renewed popularity {{as a way}} {{for their}} faction to regain power, and sought to find ways to nominate him for the presidency in 1880. Opponents called it a violation of the unofficial two-term rule that had been the norm since George Washington. Grant said nothing publicly, but he wanted the job and encouraged his men. Washburne urged him to run; Grant demurred, saying he would be happy for the Republicans to win with another candidate, though he preferred James G. Blaine to John Sherman. Even so, Conkling and John A. Logan began to organize delegates in Grant's favor. When the convention convened in Chicago in June, there were more delegates pledged to Grant than to any other candidate, but he was still short of <b>a</b> <b>majority</b> <b>vote</b> to capture the nomination.|$|E
5|$|The National Assembly makes legislation. The body {{consists}} of 155 members elected for four-year terms who meet {{three times per}} year. The Assembly holds regular sessions twice a year, starting in March and October, and can hold special sessions when called by the prime minister. Deputies elect a National Assembly president every two years. The president must sign or reject newly passed laws within 15 days. The National Assembly must approve the prime minister's plan of government and may force the prime minister to resign through <b>a</b> <b>majority</b> <b>vote</b> of no confidence. However, if the National Assembly rejects the executive branch's programme twice in one year, the president may disband the Assembly and call for new legislative elections. In practice, the president exercises considerable influence over the National Assembly through his party, the Patriotic Salvation Movement (MPS), which holds a large majority.|$|E
5|$|The Nobel laureates are {{selected}} by the Nobel Committee for Physics, a Nobel Committee that consists of five members elected by The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. In the first stage that begins in September, around 3,000 people – selected university professors, Nobel Laureates in Physics and Chemistry, etc. – are sent confidential forms to nominate candidates. The completed nomination forms arrive at the Nobel Committee no later than 31 January of the following year. These nominees are scrutinized and discussed by experts who narrow it to approximately fifteen names. The committee submits a report with recommendations on the final candidates into the Academy, where, in the Physics Class, it is further discussed. The Academy then makes the final selection of the Laureates in Physics through <b>a</b> <b>majority</b> <b>vote.</b>|$|E

50|$|If <b>a</b> <b>majority</b> <b>voted</b> 'yes', the Assembly {{would then}} {{able to make}} laws, known as Acts of the Assembly, on all matters in the subject areas, without needing the UK Parliament's agreement. If <b>a</b> <b>majority</b> <b>voted</b> 'no', the {{arrangements}} {{at the time of}} the referendum would have continued - that is, in each devolved area, the Assembly would be able to make its own laws on some matters, but not others. To make laws on any of these other matters, the Assembly would have had to ask the UK Parliament to transfer the powers to it.|$|R
5|$|The Organic Laws were {{drafted by}} a {{legislative}} committee on May 16, 1843 and June 28, 1843, before being adopted on July 5. Although not a formal constitution, the document outlined {{the laws of}} the government. Two years later, on July 2, 1845, a new set of Organic Laws was drafted to revise and clarify the previous version; this newer version was adopted by <b>a</b> <b>majority</b> <b>vote</b> of the people on July 26, 1845. This constitution-like document divided the government into three departments: a judiciary branch, an executive branch, and a legislature. The definition of the executive branch had previously been modified, in late 1844, from a three-person committee to a single governor; this change took effect in 1845.|$|E
5|$|The Sabor {{meets in}} public {{sessions}} in two periods; the first from 15 January to 30 June, {{and the second}} from 15 September to 15 December. Extra sessions can be called by the President of the Republic, {{by the president of}} the parliament or by the government. The powers of the legislature include enactment and amendment of the constitution, enactment of laws, adoption of the state budget, declarations of war and peace, alteration of the country's boundaries, calling and conducting referenda and elections, appointments and relief of office, supervising the work of the Government of Croatia and other holders of public powers responsible to the Sabor, and granting amnesty. Decisions are made based on <b>a</b> <b>majority</b> <b>vote</b> if more than half of the Chamber is present, except in cases of constitutional issues.|$|E
5|$|The king is {{the head}} of state and {{commander-in-chief}} of the army. He can declare war and peace, ratify laws and treaties, convene and close legislative sessions, call and postpone elections, dismiss the government and dissolve the parliament. The appointed government can also be dismissed through <b>a</b> <b>majority</b> <b>vote</b> of no confidence by the elected House of Representatives. After a bill is proposed by the government, it must be approved by the House of Representatives then the Senate, and becomes law after being ratified by the king. A royal veto on legislation can be overridden by a two-thirds vote in both houses. The parliament also has the right of interpellation.|$|E
50|$|The 2005 Western Australian retail {{trading hours}} {{referendum}} {{was held in}} Western Australia on 20 February 2005. The referendum failed, with <b>a</b> <b>majority</b> <b>voting</b> against both extended weeknight retail trading and Sunday retail trading.|$|R
