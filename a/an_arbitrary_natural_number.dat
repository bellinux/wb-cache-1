50|$|The {{notion of}} computability of a {{function}} can be relativized to <b>an</b> <b>arbitrary</b> set of <b>natural</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>A.</b> A function f is defined to be computable in A (equivalently A-computable or computable relative to A) when it satisfies {{the definition of}} a computable function with modifications allowing access to A as an oracle. As with the concept of a computable function relative computability can be given equivalent definitions in many different models of computation. This is commonly accomplished by supplementing the model of computation with an additional primitive operation which asks whether a given integer is a member of A. We can also talk about f being computable in g by identifying g with its graph.|$|R

The aim of the present paper {{is to show that}} there are very close relations between polyadic arithmetics and the classic theory of commutative Banach algebras. Namely, let A be the algebra consisting of all complex periodic functions on Z with the uniform norm. Then the polyadic topological ring can be defined as the ring of all characters A → C with convolution operations and the Gelfand topology.

40|$|We {{tentatively}} propose two {{guiding principles}} {{for the construction}} of theories of physics, which should be satisfied by a possible future theory of quantum gravity. These principles are inspired by those that led Einstein to his theory of general relativity, viz. his principle of general covariance and his equivalence principle, {{as well as by the}} two mysterious dogmas of Bohr’s interpretation of quantum mechanics, i. e. his doctrine of classical concepts and his principle of complementarity. An appropriate mathematical language for combining these ideas is topos theory, a framework earlier proposed for physics by Isham and collaborators. Our principle of general tovariance states that any mathematical structure appearing in the laws of physics must be definable in <b>an</b> <b>arbitrary</b> topos (with <b>natural</b> <b>numbers</b> object) and must be preserved under so-called geometric morphisms. This principle identifies geometric logic as the mathematical language of physics and restricts the constructions and theorems to those valid in intuitionism: neither Aristotle’s principle of the excluded third nor Zermelo’s Axiom of Choice may be invoked. Subsequently, our equivalence principle states that any algebra of observables (initially defined in the topos Sets) is empirically equivalent to a commutative one in some other topos...|$|R

We also investigate the possible relative positions of the limit cycles for this differential system, which is the second main problem studying in this work. In particular, we construct differential systems with n given limit cycles and one limit cycle whose position depends on the position of the previous n limit cycles.
