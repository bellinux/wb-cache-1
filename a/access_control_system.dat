Recent work on risk-based <b>access</b> <b>control</b> <b>systems</b> has shown promise at resolving the inadequacies of traditional <b>access</b> <b>control</b> <b>systems,</b> and promise to increase information sharing and security. We consider some of the core open problems in risk-based <b>access</b> <b>control</b> <b>systems,</b> namely where and how much risk to take. We propose the use of market mechanisms to determine an organization’s risk tolerance and allocation. We show that with the correct incentives, an employee will make optimal choices for the organization. We also comment on how the market {{can be used to}} ensure employees behave honestly and detect those who are malicious. Through simulations, we empirically show the advantage of risk-based <b>access</b> <b>control</b> <b>systems</b> and market mechanisms at increasing information sharing and security...|$|R

25|$|In 1998, the MTR and KCR {{started using}} the Octopus <b>Access</b> <b>Control</b> <b>System</b> {{as the main}} payment method for travel on its network, {{replacing}} the Common Stored Value Tickets.

The system was originally proposed and introduced by the MTR. It has been extended to different services such as minibuses, franchised buses, supermarkets, and fast food restaurants. It {{has the potential to be}} further developed in other fields of services. The older, traditional magnetic ticketing system is also still in use for single journeys.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Delegation is a {{mechanism}} {{that allows a}} user A to act on another user B’s behalf by making B’s access rights available to A. It is well recognized as an important mechanism to provide resiliency and flexibility in <b>access</b> <b>control</b> <b>systems,</b> and has gained popularity in the research community. However, most existing literature focuses on modeling and managing delegations. Little {{work has been done}} on understanding the impact of delegation on the security of existing <b>access</b> <b>control</b> <b>systems.</b> In particular, no formal notion of security with respect to delegation has been proposed. Many existing <b>access</b> <b>control</b> <b>systems</b> are designed without having delegation in mind. Simply incorporating a delegation module into those systems may cause security breaches. This paper focuses on the security aspect of delegation in <b>access</b> <b>control</b> <b>systems.</b> We first give examples on how colluding users may abuse the delegation sup-port of <b>access</b> <b>control</b> <b>systems</b> to circumvent security policies, such as separation of duty. As a major contribution, we propose a formal notion of security with respect to delegation in <b>access</b> <b>control</b> <b>systems.</b> After that, we discuss potential mechanisms to enforce security. In particular, we design a novel source-based en-forcement mechanism for workflow authorization systems so as to achieve both security and efficiency. ...|$|R
