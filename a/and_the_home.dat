5|$|After Duquesne lost to Saint Bonaventure, the Bonnies {{also lost}} their final regular season game to Xavier, which left {{the two teams}} in a tie for the eighth seed <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>home</b> tournament game that went with it. The two teams had played each other twice during the season, with each team taking one victory, so the second tiebreaker came down to who had scored the best victory. Duquesne's best win came against Charlotte, while Saint Bonaventure's was against Rhode Island. Unfortunately, those two teams were also in a tie. So for Duquesne to get their home game, Charlotte had to win their final home game, and Rhode Island had to lose. Both teams lost, so the tie {{remained}} and Rhode Island won out due to their head-to-head records. Thus Duquesne would head {{back out on the}} road against the Bonnies.|$|E

5|$|After {{serving in}} World War II, Loxton was demobilised and {{rose through the}} cricketing ranks to make his {{first-class}} debut in 1946–47. He was an all rounder—a right-handed middle-order batsman and a right-arm fast bowler. During the 1947–48 Australian season, India toured Australia for five Tests, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>home</b> team dominated, taking an unassailable 3–0 series lead after the first four matches. The Australian selectors then {{decided to use the}} Fifth Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground to give opportunities to players on the fringes of the national team to show their capabilities ahead of the 1948 tour of England. Loxton was one of several debutants, and he seized his chance. He scored 80 and took three wickets as an all rounder in the Australian victory, and was rewarded with inclusion in the 17-man touring party.|$|E

5|$|Born in Ramelton, Ireland, Gallaher {{migrated}} to New Zealand {{with his family}} as a small child. After moving to Auckland, in 1895 he joined Ponsonby RFC and was selected for his province in 1896. In 1901–02 he served with the New Zealand Contingent in the Anglo-Boer War. He first appeared on the New Zealand national team for their unbeaten tour of Australia in 1903, and played in New Zealand's first ever test match, against Australia in Sydney. The Originals Gallaher captained during 1905–06 helped to cement rugby as New Zealand's national sport, but he was relentlessly pilloried by the British press {{for his role as}} wing-forward. The use of a wing-forward, which critics felt was a tactic to deliberately obstruct opponents, contributed to decades of strain between the rugby authorities of New Zealand <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Home</b> Nations; the International Rugby Football Board (IRFB) effectively outlawed the position in 1931.|$|E
5|$|Film of {{the concert}} was {{produced}} for television broadcast <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>home</b> video market.

Simon himself financed the US$750,000 cost of the staging and the video recording. It is unknown how much HBO paid for the television and video rights of the recording; US$1 million according to some sources, over US$3 million according to others. The film includes the two songs that had not appeared on the album, and with an 87-minute duration, is 12 minutes longer than the album.|$|E
5|$|Given these shortcomings, any modern {{weapons that}} were {{available}} were allocated to the British Army, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Home</b> Guard was forced to supplement the meagre amount of outdated weapons and ammunition they had with ad hoc weapons. One such weapon was the Northover Projector, the invention of Major Robert Harry Northover. Northover, {{an officer in the}} Home Guard, designed it to be an easily manufactured and cheap anti-tank weapon, costing just under £10 to produce, excluding the required tripod. The Major wrote directly to the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, with his design and arranged for Churchill to attend a demonstration of the Northover Projector. The Prime Minister approved of the weapon and gave it his personal endorsement, ordering in October 1940 that the weapon be mass-produced {{on a scale of one}} for every Home Guard platoon.|$|E

5|$|Reviewing {{the quality}} of Meessen's photography, Boom and Wachilin write that his Javanese {{pictures}} are among his best, whereas those from other islands are of more variable quality. They note considerable detail in his cityscapes. He chose buildings to photograph that were popular with other photographers, including the Governor General's Palace <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>home</b> of Raden Saleh. Many of his studio portraits appear to be purely commercial, leading Boom and Wachlin {{to suggest that they}} were meant to fund Meessen's landscape photography. Some of his images, particularly the portraits, were hand-tinted.|$|E
5|$|Season 4 {{kicks off}} with Eric Taylor {{struggling}} as the East Dillon High coach.

The East Dillon Lions and Odessa Bronchos both wear red uniforms and are considered underdogs to the Panthers. Additionally, Odessa High and East Dillon are both underfunded and considered inferior compared to their rival school, and serve a predominately poor minority community. Additionally, the school district boundaries between East and West Dillon were intentionally drawn to ensure the majority of talented players would be zoned for West Dillon; the districts between Permian and Odessa High were drawn in a similar manner.|$|E
