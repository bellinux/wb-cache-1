5|$|When the <b>allele</b> <b>frequency</b> is very small, drift {{can also}} {{overpower}} selection even in large populations. For example, while disadvantageous mutations are usually eliminated quickly in large populations, new advantageous mutations {{are almost as}} vulnerable to loss through genetic drift as are neutral mutations. Not until the <b>allele</b> <b>frequency</b> for the advantageous mutation reaches a certain threshold will genetic drift have no effect.|$|E

40|$|Hardy-Weinberg disequilibrium (HWD) {{measures}} have been proposed using dense markers to fine map a quantitative trait locus (QTL) to regions < ∼ 1 cM. Earlier HWD measures may introduce bias in the fine mapping because they are dependent on marker <b>allele</b> <b>frequencies</b> across loci. Hence, HWD indices that do not depend on marker <b>allele</b> <b>frequencies</b> are desired for fine mapping. Based on our earlier work, here we present four new HWD indices that do not depend on marker <b>allele</b> <b>frequencies.</b> Two are for use when marker <b>allele</b> <b>frequencies</b> in a study population are known, and two are for use when marker <b>allele</b> <b>frequencies</b> in a study population are not known and are only known in the extreme samples. The new measures are {{a function of the}} genetic distance between the marker locus and a QTL. Through simulations, we investigated and compared the fine mapping performance of the new HWD measures with that of the earlier ones. Our results show that when marker <b>allele</b> <b>frequencies</b> vary across loci, the new measures presented here are more robust and powerful. Copyright © 2003 S.

5|$|The {{most common}} {{approach}} of GWA studies is the case-control setup, which compares two {{large groups of}} individuals, one healthy control group and one case group affected by a disease. All individuals in each group are genotyped {{for the majority of}} common known SNPs. The exact number of SNPs depends on the genotyping technology, but are typically one million or more. For each of these SNPs it is then investigated if the <b>allele</b> <b>frequency</b> is significantly altered between the case and the control group. In such setups, the fundamental unit for reporting effect sizes is the odds ratio. The odds ratio is the ratio of two odds, which in the context of GWA studies are the odds of disease for individuals having a specific allele and the odds of disease for individuals who do not have that same allele. When the <b>allele</b> <b>frequency</b> in the case group is much higher than in the control group, the odds ratio is higher than 1, and vice versa for lower <b>allele</b> <b>frequency.</b> Additionally, a P-value for the significance of the odds ratio is typically calculated using a simple chi-squared test. Finding odds ratios that are significantly different from 1 is the objective of the GWA study because this shows that a SNP is associated with disease.|$|E
5|$|However, {{adaptation}} {{to climate change}} has been demonstrated in many cases. These are usually due to a shift in coral and zooxanthellae genotypes. These shifts in <b>allele</b> <b>frequency</b> have progressed toward more tolerant types of zooxanthellae. Scientists found that a certain scleractinian zooxanthella is becoming more common where sea temperature is high. Symbionts able to tolerate warmer water seem to photosynthesise more slowly, implying an evolutionary trade-off.|$|E

The numbers of red and blue marbles picked each generation fluctuates; sometimes more red and sometimes more blue.

50|$|In 1908, G. H. Hardy and Wilhelm Weinberg modeled an {{idealised}} {{population to}} demonstrate that {{in the absence of}} selection, migration, random genetic drift, <b>allele</b> <b>frequencies</b> stay constant over time, and that in the presence of random mating, genotype frequencies are related to <b>allele</b> <b>frequencies</b> according to a binomial square principle called the Hardy-Weinberg law.|$|R
5|$|Genetic drift (also {{known as}} allelic drift or the Sewall Wright effect after {{biologist}} Sewall Wright) {{is the change}} in the frequency of an existing gene variant (allele) in a population due to random sampling of organisms. The alleles in the offspring are a sample of those in the parents, and chance has a role in determining whether a given individual survives and reproduces. A population's <b>allele</b> <b>frequency</b> is the fraction of the copies of one gene that share a particular form. Genetic drift may cause gene variants to disappear completely and thereby reduce genetic variation.|$|E
5|$|The {{mechanisms}} of genetic drift can be illustrated with a simplified example. Consider {{a very large}} colony of bacteria isolated in a drop of solution. The bacteria are genetically identical except for a single gene with two alleles labeled A and B. A and B are neutral alleles meaning {{that they do not}} affect the bacteria's ability to survive and reproduce; all bacteria in this colony are equally likely to survive and reproduce. Suppose that half the bacteria have allele A and the other half have allele B. Thus A and B each have <b>allele</b> <b>frequency</b> 1/2.|$|E
5|$|Since {{these first}} {{landmark}} GWA studies, {{there have been}} two general trends. One has been towards larger and larger sample sizes. At the end of 2011, the largest sample sizes were in the range of 200,000 individuals. The reason is the drive towards reliably detecting risk-SNPs that have smaller odds ratios and lower <b>allele</b> <b>frequency.</b> Another trend has been towards the use of more narrowly defined phenotypes, such as blood lipids, proinsulin or similar biomarkers. These are called intermediate phenotypes, and their analyses may be of value to functional research into biomarkers. A variation of GWAS uses participants that are first-degree relatives of people with a disease. This type of study has been named genome-wide association study by proxy (GWAX).|$|E
40|$|The {{breeding}} {{structure of}} natural populations {{is a consequence}} of mating patterns in subpopulations and the amount of gene flow among subpopulations. This dissertation is a study of seasonal changes in the breeding structure of natural populations of the house fly, Musca domestica L;Allozyme frequencies were estimated at nine enzymatic loci in flies collected for two years at six farms. Allozymes were resolved by vertical polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Allelic and genotypic frequencies were studied in four adult age groups. Farms differed in the quality of breeding resources they offered reproducing flies, presenting the possibility of local adaptation;No consistent departures from random mating were detected. No consistent linkage disequilibrium was observed. <b>Allele</b> <b>frequencies</b> were homogeneous among sexes and age groups. Mating patterns in subpopulations were entirely random and did not influence population breeding structure;Allele frequencies at farms were initially divergent, converged in midsummer, and then progressively diverged in each of two years. In spring, <b>allele</b> <b>frequencies</b> were heterogeneous among farms due to genetic drift during winter. This differentiation diminished rapidly in June and flies were panmictic until November. However, <b>allele</b> <b>frequencies</b> in young flies (0 - 3 days old) became divergent in mid-August when fly populations were large. Variation in <b>allele</b> <b>frequencies</b> in young flies at adjacent farms accounted for {{a large proportion of the}} variance in <b>allele</b> <b>frequencies</b> among all farms. These observations were consistent with the hypothesis that <b>allele</b> <b>frequencies</b> in young flies reflected the habitat in which they matured as larvae;The population biology and genetics of house flies surviving indoors during winter was studied in three swine farrowing sheds. Adult age structure was monitored and compared with the age structure normally found among flies in summer. A larger proportion of flies were gravid during winter. The other age structure indices were homogeneous with those found among summer flies. There were major shifts in <b>allele</b> <b>frequencies</b> associated with the founding of indoor populations in autumn and the founding of outdoor populations in spring. During winter, <b>allele</b> <b>frequencies</b> were temporally homogeneous...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{breakthroughs}} in molecular technology, most significantly the {{polymerase chain reaction}} (PCR) and in situ hybridization, have allowed the detection of genetic variation in bacterial communities without prior cultivation. These methods often produce data {{in the form of}} the presence or absence of alleles or genotypes, however, rather than counts of alleles. Using relative <b>allele</b> <b>frequencies</b> from presence-absence data as estimates of population <b>allele</b> <b>frequencies</b> tends to underestimate the frequencies of common alleles and overestimate those of rare ones, potentially biasing the results of a test of neutrality in favor of balancing selection. In this study, a maximum-likelihood estimator (MLE) of bacterial <b>allele</b> <b>frequencies</b> designed for use with presence-absence data is derived using an explicit stochastic model of the host infection (or bacterial sampling) process. The performance of the MLE is evaluated using computer simulation and a method is presented for evaluating the fit of estimated <b>allele</b> <b>frequencies</b> to the neutral infinite alleles model (IAM). The methods are applied to estimate <b>allele</b> <b>frequencies</b> at two outer surface protein loci (ospA and ospC) of the Lyme disease spirochete, Borrelia burgdorferi, infecting local populations of deer ticks (Ixodes scapularis) and to test the fit to a neutral IAM...|$|R

5|$|The first GWA study, {{conducted}} in 2005, compared 96 patients with age-related macular degeneration (ARMD) with 50 healthy controls. It identified two SNPs with significantly altered <b>allele</b> <b>frequency</b> {{between the two}} groups. These SNPs were located in the gene encoding complement factor H, which was an unexpected finding in the research of ARMD. The findings from these first GWA studies have subsequently prompted further functional research towards therapeutical manipulation of the complement system in ARMD. Another landmark publication {{in the history of}} GWA studies was the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium (WTCCC) study, the largest GWA study ever conducted {{at the time of its}} publication in 2007. The WTCCC included 14,000 cases of seven common diseases (~2,000 individuals for each of coronary heart disease, type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, bipolar disorder, and hypertension) and 3,000 shared controls. This study was successful in uncovering many new disease genes underlying these diseases.|$|E
5|$|The law {{of large}} numbers predicts that when the {{absolute}} number of copies of the allele is small (e.g., in small populations), the magnitude of drift on allele frequencies per generation is larger. The magnitude of drift {{is large enough to}} overwhelm selection at any <b>allele</b> <b>frequency</b> when the selection coefficient is less than 1 divided by the effective population size. Non-adaptive evolution resulting from the product of mutation and genetic drift is therefore considered to be a consequential mechanism of evolutionary change primarily within small, isolated populations. The mathematics of genetic drift depend on the effective population size, {{but it is not clear}} how this is related to the actual number of individuals in a population. Genetic linkage to other genes that are under selection can reduce the effective population size experienced by a neutral allele. With a higher recombination rate, linkage decreases and with it this local effect on effective population size. This effect is visible in molecular data as a correlation between local recombination rate and genetic diversity, and negative correlation between gene density and diversity at noncoding DNA regions. Stochasticity associated with linkage to other genes that are under selection is not the same as sampling error, and is sometimes known as genetic draft in order to distinguish it from genetic drift.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The <b>allele</b> <b>frequencies</b> of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) {{are needed}} to select an optimal subset of common SNPs for use in {{association}} studies. Sequence-based methods for finding SNPs with <b>allele</b> <b>frequencies</b> may need to handle thousands of sequences from the same genome location (sequences of deep coverage). Results We describe a computational method for finding common SNPs with <b>allele</b> <b>frequencies</b> in single-pass sequences of deep coverage. The method enhances a widely used program named PolyBayes in several aspects. We present results from our method and PolyBayes on eighteen data sets of human expressed sequence tags (ESTs) with deep coverage.

Conclusion The new method is able to handle single-pass sequences of deep coverage efficiently.

40|$|We {{developed}} an empirical Bayes procedure to estimate genetic distances between populations using <b>allele</b> <b>frequencies.</b> This procedure {{makes it possible}} to describe the skewness of the genetic distance while taking full account of the uncertainty of the sample <b>allele</b> <b>frequencies.</b> Dirichlet priors of the <b>allele</b> <b>frequencies</b> are specified, and the posterior distributions of the various composite parameters are obtained by Monte Carlo simulation. To avoid overdependence on subjective priors, we adopt a hierarchical model and estimate hyperparameters by maximizing the joint marginal-likelihood function. Taking advantage of the empirical Bayesian procedure, we extend the method to estimate the effective population size using temporal changes in <b>allele</b> <b>frequencies.</b> The method is applied to data sets on red sea bream, herring, northern pike, and ayu broodstock. It is shown that overdispersion overestimates the genetic distance and underestimates the effective population size, if it is not taken into account during the analysis. The joint marginal-likelihood function also estimates the rate of gene flow into island populations...|$|R
40|$|Using {{properties}} of moment stationarity we develop exact expressions for {{the mean and}} covariance of <b>allele</b> <b>frequencies</b> at a single locus {{for a set of}} populations subject to drift, mutation, and migration. Some general results can be obtained even for arbitrary mutation and migration matrices, for example: (1) Under quite general conditions, the mean vector depends only on mutation rates, not on migration rates or the number of populations. (2) <b>Allele</b> <b>frequencies</b> covary among all pairs of populations connected by migration. As a result, the drift, mutation, migration process is not ergodic when any finite number of populations is exchanging genes. in addition, we provide closed form expressions for the mean and covariance of <b>allele</b> <b>frequencies</b> in Wright 2 ̆ 7 s finite-island model of migration under several simple models of mutation, and we show that the correlation in <b>allele</b> <b>frequencies</b> among populations can be very large for realistic rates of mutation unless an enormous number of populations are exchanging genes.
