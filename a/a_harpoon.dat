5|$|Gil Grissom has a {{more than}} passing {{similarity}} to Sherlock Holmes. Like Holmes, Grissom is dispassionate with a fierce devotion to logic and little regard for societal norms of behavior; Grissom once smashed mustard jars {{in a grocery store}} to illustrate a theory ("I-15 Murders"), much as Holmes once practiced spearing a pig in a butchers to determine how strong a man would have to be to transfix a man with <b>a</b> <b>harpoon.</b>|$|E
5|$|When an Iowa class {{battleship}} fired <b>a</b> <b>Harpoon</b> Missile, {{a booster}} propelled the missile {{away from the}} ship; after approximately , the booster dropped away. After the booster was discarded a turbojet engine ignited and propelled the missile to the target. The stabilizing and actuator fins, which helped to guide the missile to its target, were stored folded in the canister and sprang into position after launching. These fins directed the missile to the target through inputs from the AN/SWG-1 Harpoon Fire Control System.|$|E

5|$|Mala and the Eskimos go {{bowhead whale}} hunting in wooden boats and with {{harpoons}} {{provided by the}} white men, and an actual whale hunt and carcass slaughtering is depicted on film. After the successful hunt, two drunken white men kidnap Aba (and prevent Mala from rescuing her) and force her to get drunk. The ship captain rapes Aba, who escapes at dawn. The Captain's Mate, hunting seals with a rifle, mistakes Aba (passed out on the ice) for an animal and kills her. Mala kills the ship captain with <b>a</b> <b>harpoon</b> (mistakenly believing the captain shot his wife). He flees back to his village with his children.|$|E
5|$|After regrouping, Carter, Susan and Preacher go to a {{decompression}} {{chamber and}} swim to the surface. Carter {{realizes that the}} sharks made them flood the facility so they could escape through the weaker mesh fences at the surface. In an effort to distract the last shark from escaping to the open sea, Susan cuts herself and dives into the water. Although she manages to distract the shark, she is unable {{to get out of}} the water. Carter dives in, but is too late to save her from being devoured. While Carter is grabbing hold of the shark's dorsal fin, Preacher shoots the shark with <b>a</b> <b>harpoon,</b> but the spear also goes through Carter's thigh. As the shark breaks through the fence, Carter orders Preacher to connect the trailing wire to a battery, sending an electric current through the wire and to an explosive charge in the harpoon, killing the shark. In the end, Carter managed to free himself in time, and joins Preacher to see a workers' boat en-route on the horizon.|$|E
5|$|Discovering that Vanessa is {{actually}} Ursula in disguise, Scuttle informs Ariel of Ursula's plan to marry Eric while Sebastian informs Triton about Ursula's actions. Assisted by her friends, Ariel stops Eric's wedding to Ursula, destroying the nautilus shell around Ursula's neck and restoring Ariel's voice. Realizing that Ariel is {{the girl who}} saved his life, Eric rushes to kiss her, but the sun sets, and Ariel transforms back into a mermaid before Ursula kidnaps her. Triton furiously confronts Ursula and demands Ariel's release, but the deal is inviolable. Ursula tricks Triton into taking Ariel's place as Ursula's prisoner, giving up his trident. Ariel is released as Triton {{is transformed into a}} polyp. Ursula steps forward as the new queen, but before she can use the trident, Eric intervenes with <b>a</b> <b>harpoon.</b> Ursula attempts to attack Eric, but inadvertently kills Flotsam and Jetsam in the process.

50|$|There {{were many}} others whose ideas predated Foyn's method. In 1867, a Danish {{fireworks}} manufacturer, Gaetano Amici, patented <b>a</b> cannon fired <b>harpoon.</b> An Englishman, George Welch, patented <b>a</b> grenade <b>harpoon,</b> also in 1867, {{very similar to}} Foyn's invention. In 1856, Phillip Rechten, of Bremen, Germany, together with the gunsmith Cordes, produced a double-barreled whale gun (and later claimed credit for Foyn's success) with <b>a</b> separate <b>harpoon</b> and bomb-lance. Another Norwegian, Jacob Nicolai Walsøe experimented with an explosive tipped projectile design. A third Norwegian, Arent Christian Dahl, also experimented with explosive harpoons from 1857-1860.|$|R
5|$|Meanwhile, Bond disguises {{himself as}} one of Largo's henchmen, and uncovers Largo's plan to destroy Miami Beach. Bond is {{discovered}} by Largo, but rescued by Leiter, who orders the United States Coast Guard to parachute to the area via US Air Force transport aircraft. After an underwater battle, the henchmen surrender. Largo escapes to his ship, which h{{as one of}} the bombs on board. As it begins to leave, Bond gets on underwater. The ship is pursued by Royal Navy and U.S. Coast Guard vessels, but Largo jettisons the rear of the ship, revealing the front as a hydrofoil as it escapes. Bond fights Largo on board, and he is about to shoot Bond when Domino, freed by Largo's nuclear physicist Ladislav Kutze, shoots Largo with <b>a</b> <b>harpoon</b> gun. Bond, Domino, and Kutze jump overboard, and the boat runs aground and explodes. A sky hook-equipped CIA B-17 aircraft then rescues Bond and Domino.|$|E
5|$|To defeat enemies, {{the player}} {{can use a}} variety of weapons, {{including}} dual pistols, dual Uzis, a Desert Eagle, a shotgun, an MP5 submachine gun, a grenade launcher, a rocket launcher, and <b>a</b> <b>harpoon</b> gun for underwater use. The dual pistols have infinite ammunition and are Lara's default weapons, while the other weapons have finite ammunition and must be found in the levels. At one point in the game, Lara will be stripped of all her weapons, leaving the player defenceless and forced to use stealth, before recovering her pistols later. Lara has a certain amount of health that decreases if she falls from a great height or when she is attacked by enemies. If Lara's health is fully depleted, the player must start the game again from a previous save point. Saving the player's progress on the PlayStation version of the game requires a memory card and consumes a Save Crystal from Lara's inventory. These can be found throughout each level and do not require the player to save the game at the pick-up spot.|$|E
