In the case of environmental or aircraft noise, distance need not be quoted as it is the level at the point of measurement that is needed, but when measuring refrigerators and similar appliances the distance should be stated; where not stated it is usually one metre (1 m).

Horrendous though the resulting curve generally appears to be (in comparison to other equipment), it provides a basis for experimentation with absorbent panels. Driving both speakers is recommended, as this stimulates low-frequency room ‘modes’ in a representative fashion. This means the microphone must be positioned precisely equidistant from the two speakers if ‘comb-filter’ effects (alternate peaks and dips in the measured room response at that point) are to be avoided. Positioning is best done by moving the mic {{from side to side}} for maximum response on a 1 kHz tone, then a 3 kHz tone, then a 10 kHz tone. While the very best modern speakers can produce a frequency response flat to ±1 dB from 40 Hz to 20 kHz in <b>anechoic</b> <b>conditions,</b> measurements at 2 m in a real listening room are generally considered good if they are within ±12 dB.|$|E

40|$|A {{well-known}} {{problem for}} reproductions of binaural recordings and simulations using HRTFs {{other than those}} of the actual listener is decreased localization performance and increased front-back confusion. Previous studies have indicated that moving the sound source can reduce these problems. The objective {{of this study was to}} measure how a unidirectional sound source movement along an orbit in the horizontal plane (achieved by reproducing sounds with a loudspeaker and turning a recording artificial head with a velocity of 5 °/s) affects front-back confusion and localization errors. Two factors were studied: 1. Movement (static or rotation). 2. Acoustic environment (anechoic or reverberant). Male speech and recurring 840 Hz sinusoidal tones with a Gaussian envelope were used as stimuli. Listening tests showed that the front-back confusion rate and the rate of incorrectly perceiving that the sound is coming straight from the side were significantly lower (95 % confidence level) in the reverberant condition compared to the <b>anechoic</b> <b>condition.</b> The front-back confusion rate was lower for the moving auditory scene compared to the static auditory scene, both in <b>anechoic</b> and reverberant <b>conditions,</b> but these differences were not significant. To conclude, there is reason to add room reflections to 3 D sound synthesis in order to enhance localization performance in auditory displays.

Few studies have examined the condition of near-field sources and distance perception. The current study concerns localization and pointing accuracy by examining source positions in the peripersonal space, specifically those associated with a typical tabletop surface. Accuracy is studied with respect to the reporting hand (dominant or secondary) for auditory sources. Results show no effect on the reporting hand with azimuthal errors increasing equally for the most extreme source positions. Distance errors show a consistent compression towards the center of the reporting area. A second evaluation is carried out comparing auditory and visual stimuli to examine any bias in reporting protocol or biomechanical difficulties. No common bias error was observed between auditory and visual stimuli indicating that reporting errors were not due to biomechanical limitations in the pointing task. A final evaluation compares real auditory sources and <b>anechoic</b> <b>condition</b> virtual sources created using binaural rendering. Results showed increased azimuthal errors, with virtual source positions being consistently overestimated to more lateral positions, while no significant distance perception was observed, indicating a deficiency in the binaural rendering condition relative to the real stimuli situation.

40|$|Listeners can {{selectively}} {{attend to}} a desired target by directing attention to known target source features, such as location or pitch. Reverberation, however, reduces {{the reliability of the}} cues that allow a target source to be segregated and selected from a sound mixture. Given this, it is likely that reverberant energy interferes with selective auditory attention. Anecdotal reports suggest that the ability to focus spatial auditory attention degrades even with early aging, yet {{there is little evidence that}} middle-aged listeners have behavioral deficits on tasks requiring selective auditory attention. The current study was designed to look for individual differences in selective attention ability and to see if any such differences correlate with age. Normal-hearing adults, ranging in age from 18 to 55  years, were asked to report a stream of digits located directly ahead in a simulated rectangular room. Simultaneous, competing masker digit streams were simulated at locations 15 ° left and right of center. The level of reverberation was varied to alter task difficulty by interfering with localization cues (increasing localization blur). Overall, performance was best in the <b>anechoic</b> <b>condition</b> and worst in the high-reverberation condition. Listeners nearly always reported a digit from one of the three competing streams, showing that reverberation did not render the digits unintelligible. Importantly, inter-subject differences were extremely large. These differences, however, were not significantly correlated with age, memory span, or hearing status. These results show that listeners with audiometrically normal pure tone thresholds differ in their ability to selectively attend {{to a desired}} source, a task important in everyday communication. Further work is necessary to determine if these differences arise from differences in peripheral auditory function or in more central function...|$|R

The third-order total variation diminishing (TVD) Runge-Kutta scheme {{is used for}} time integration. The <b>anechoic</b> boundary <b>conditions</b> in a 2 -D computa-tional domain are modeled by setting the incoming fluxes (in the PCF) to zero at {{the boundaries of the}} rectangular (square) domain and also by simultaneously using the sponge layer to damp the incoming fluxes. This ensures a reasonable suppression of the contaminant reflected waves from the boundaries. An initial monopole condition of the acoustic pressure field modeled by a Gaussian pulse is considered as a test case which initiates an acoustic wave that propagates and expands in time. The numerical simulations are carried for sufficient time duration to ensure that the wave completely propagates out of the computational domain, wherein only the acoustic pressure at the boundaries is stored after each step of time-integration. The results are presented as forward time-evolution of acoustic pressure field at different time instants. These stored acoustic pressure time-histories are reversed in time and used as input data during the implementation of Time-Reversal (TR) simulations of the 2 -D LEE to compute the backward time-evolution of the acoustic field variables, whereby the same numerical solver is used. The acoustic pressure field predicted by the TR procedure at final time-instant of simulation is found to be in excellent agreement with the initial conditions considered during the forward problem. This suggests the potential use of proposed numerical scheme (based on the PCF) with only the time-reversed acoustic pressure history as the input inflow boundary conditions during TR simulations, in localizing an acoustic source in a 2 -D domain.

40|$|A {{simulation}} {{model for a}} multi-cylinder automotive compressor has been developed. The equations for the compression cycle based on the {{first law of thermodynamics}} are derived to calculate the instantaneous pressure in the cylinder. During the suction process, the dynamic motion of an automotive valve between a stop and seat are approximated as one-dimensional in the transverse direction and a linear beam model is used to describe these motions. Also the mass flow rate equation through the valve port is derived assuming one-dimensional compressible flow in a squared-edge orifice. ^ After it is demonstrated that the {{simulation model}} predicts the thermodynamic processes and the valve dynamics well, it is used to analyze gas pulsations in the suction manifold. A complicated real suction manifold connected to an anechoic pipe is modeled as a simplified annular cavity with an area change. Then linear acoustic plane wave theory and a four pole parameter formulation are used to derive and solve the governing inhomogeneous equation for the forced pressure responses in the manifold. Along with the resultant mathematical models, a characteristic cylinder method is used {{in order to reduce the}} computational time. The method is proven to be reliable in predicting gas pulsations. ^ Because the assumption of the <b>anechoic</b> <b>condition</b> of the suction line is restricted to academic type experiments, the simulation procedure for predicting gas pulsations in the suction manifold connected to a finite inlet pipe is described. Then several parametric studies are performed including changes of the inlet and the discharge locations and the addition of an area change. The inclusions of the suction mufflers are also considered to examine the influence on gas pulsations. The four pole parameters for mufflers and the suction line with temperature variation are formulated and then used as fundamental tools to investigate the temperature effects on the gas pulsations. The valve opening time and clearance volume of the piston are also changed in order to understand the effects of variability from valve-to-valve as are the effects of changes in the characteristics and phases of the mass flow rate through the suction valves. ...|$|R
