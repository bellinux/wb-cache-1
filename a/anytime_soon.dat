25|$|In June 2015, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe {{began to}} {{formally}} demonetise the Zimbabwean dollar, to officially value the fiat currency at zero, {{in order to}} complete a switch to the US dollar {{by the end of}} September 2015. The Zimbabwean government stated that it would credit 5 US dollars to domestic bank accounts, with balances of up to 175 quadrillion Zimbabwean dollars, and that it would exchange Zimbabwean dollars for US dollars at a rate of 1 USD to 35 quadrillion Zimbabwean dollars to accounts with balances above 175 quadrillion Zimbabwean dollars. This move was meant to stabilise the economy and establish a credible nominal anchor under low inflation conditions. The exercise brought closure to the outstanding issue on the Zimbabwe dollar, further confirming the government's position that the local unit will not return <b>anytime</b> <b>soon.</b> The Government has maintained that the return of the Zimbabwe dollar would only be considered when key economic fundamentals, such productivity in key sectors, have been achieved.|$|E

Other locations include the Tribeca section of lower Manhattan, the aircraft carrier Intrepid, the Kingsbridge Armory in the Bronx, and St. Patrick's Cathedral. Weeds were imported from Florida and were strewn across locations to make the city look like it had been overgrown with them. The closure of major streets was controversial with New Yorkers.

Baby Dragon looks every bit as real as the series’ dogs"). HitFix said it [...] "Wrapped up its terrific first season...it was damned entertaining along the way--with the finale as possibly the most entertaining so far--and we know that at least one more season is coming.

500|$|In 2006, Hed PE {{signed with}} Suburban Noize Records, {{recording}} their fifth studio album, Back 2 Base X. The album {{was intended as}} a return to the basics of rock music, and did not rely as heavily on studio enhancement as previous releases. The album was released on June 6, 2006, the same day as The Best of (həd) Planet Earth, a compilation album produced by Jive Records without the band's authorization or consent. Back 2 Base X peaked at No.12 on the Independent Albums chart, and at No.154 on the Billboard 200. Allmusic's Rob Theakston wrote that [...] "Back 2 Base X suffers from the same problems as Amerika: it tries to be conceptual in thought à la Tool and vicious in its political commentary à la Fugazi or System of a Down, but somehow falls short by sounding like an angry stoner on a soapbox.

500|$|Musically, [...] "Yasss Bish" [...] {{has been}} {{described}} as a [...] "bouncy drill anthem" [...] with a trap beat. It features a stripped back hip hop production that encompasses intense Roland TR-808 drum hits, a [...] "sinister, echo-y" [...] vocal loop, [...] "eerie" [...] shimmering synthesizers, foreboding snares, and the sound of church bells ringing in an ominous tone. Minaj's vocals in [...] "Yasss Bish" [...] have been described as [...] "melodic" [...] with a [...] "fierce" [...] message, while her rapping has been compared to the works of Southern hip hop group Migos. Several critics including Kyle Harvey of The Grio and Emma Goddard of Bustle noted the change in sound to be the beginning of a new image for Minaj. Harvey said the song continued her goal of shedding her image of a pop act, while Goddard said: [...] "Although this song is definitely NSFW and it's completely improbable that we'll hear British sisters Sophia Grace and Rosie rapping her song <b>anytime</b> <b>soon,</b> Minaj has come back strong with a new image." ...|$|E
500|$|MuuMuse's Bradley Stern {{described}} the video as [...] "an eye-popping 7-minute deep dive into astonishing new levels of self-importance and certifiable insanity." [...] The video was also noted as Gaga's most ambitious project since those for her previous singles [...] "Bad Romance" [...] and [...] "Telephone". Kevin Rutherford from Billboard said that Gaga [...] "has no problem attaching art to music" [...] and that [...] "she's not {{showing signs of}} stopping <b>anytime</b> <b>soon</b> with her new music video." [...] Isaiah Thomas from El Espectador noted that the video was a response by Gaga against accusations of [...] "selling out" [...] to the corporate world. Especially {{the ending of the}} video justified this with Gaga murdering the corporate heads who supposedly destroyed her freedom {{in the beginning of the}} video. Dharmic X from Complex {{described the}} release as [...] "vibrant" [...] and [...] "leftfield", as is expected from a release by Gaga. Samantha Grossman from Time expected the video to be full of the strange imagery and the extravagant costumes, making it [...] "bizarre".|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reaction}} to the book was positive, particularly regarding the depth the book added to the Halo universe. Reviewer Eric Qualls commented that [...] " [...] interesting to read {{and give you a}} much greater understanding" [...] to the universe. Qualls made a positive comparison to Robert A. Heinlein's Starship Troopers regarding the manner of story telling. GameCritics' Brad Gallaway also praised the back-story the book adds {{and the quality of the}} story. Fellow reviewer Gene Park noted the descriptions in the book went beyond what was presented in the game calling them [...] "vibrant and rousing." [...] He also complimented the characters presented in the novel saying they all [...] "fit nicely into the Halo universe" [...] but some times there were too many characters to remember. Sal Accardo of 3D Action Planet said of the book; [...] " [...] isn’t going to win any Pulitzers <b>anytime</b> <b>soon.</b> It’s well written, and a solid page-turner, but it’s still basically an action movie presented in book form" [...] but praised the gritty presentation of the Spartans. Don D'Ammasa of the Science Fiction Chronicle called the book [...] "competently written", but stated the plot was [...] "simpleminded".|$|E
500|$|The {{lyrics of}} the song {{describe}} a [...] "tortured romantic scenario" [...] of a newly formed couple's relationship, which, according to McCall, is enhanced by the piano and guitar arrangements. Kelley and Scott alternate on lead vocals. It speaks of the couple who prefer not to take their romantic relationship further <b>anytime</b> <b>soon,</b> want to take things slow, and are satisfied with [...] "just a goodnight kiss". McCall {{also noted that the}} lyrics portray how the female character's lines, sung by Scott, attempt to fight back her lustful feelings, and precariously sighs the line [...] "I don't want to mess this thing up." [...] Scott told Billboard that [...] "there is so much excitement {{at the beginning of a}} new relationship ... all the butterflies and that optimistic feeling that this person could be 'the one'. This song is about one of those times when your brain kicks in and tells your heart 'good things are worth waiting for.'" [...] Sarah Rodman of The Boston Globe wrote that the song's production is [...] "emblematic of the album's midtempo complacency." [...] Melinda Newman of HitFix noted that the strings [...] "give a nice lift at the end." ...|$|E
500|$|The ban expired {{the week}} ending 30 May 2008, with the {{conviction}} of Goussis {{for the murder of}} Lewis Moran, paving the way for Nine to begin screening episodes; however, Andrew Rule, who co-wrote the book on which the series is based, says Underbelly will not be seen in Victoria <b>anytime</b> <b>soon,</b> saying [...] "the problem now will be that Tony Mokbel is back in Australia and ready to stand trial on very serious charges. That will effectively prevent the series being screened in Victoria until that trial is held... That could be some time. I'm not sure about several , but it might be two years." [...] However, Underbelly was legally shown in Victoria in September 2008, after a court ruled that the network could air the first five episodes. Supreme Court Justice Peter Vickery gave the network permission to air the specially edited episodes, but said screening the sixth episode could prejudice the upcoming trials of an accused criminal. The edited versions had whole scenes cut out, and Tony Mokbel's face was pixelated. Reactions from viewers were not favourable, mainly because most had already seen the entire series.|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} well {{received}} by critics who praised the collaboration between Rowland and Guetta. Robert Copsey of Digital Spy said [...] "It {{looks as though}} they're going to be ruling the airwaves all over again... After she lulls us into {{a false sense of}} security ("I feel like the DJ is bodyguard / You see the way he keeps me safe? / With the treble and the bass?"), the track plunges into a pounding electro-house chorus that quite literally orders us to the dance floor... The result isn't quite as fresh and inventive as some of Guetta's recent output – Kelis' [...] 'Acapella', for example – but it goes a long way towards recapturing some of last summer's magic." [...] The site's other reviewer, Nick Levine, agreed saying that the song [...] "thumps as persuasively as Muhammad Ali circa 1967." [...] Robert Daw of Idolator said [...] "if you think Ms. Kelly is taking the go-go boots off <b>anytime</b> <b>soon,</b> then you'd best go lean against the wall, flower. Rowland's Guetta-produced new single 'Commander' is pure strobe-light adrenaline rush... will appear on Kelly's as-yet-untitled third solo album... we're predicting a full on Rowland Renaissance!". With Alex Catarinella of Paper saying [...] "she belts out soaring vocals, is further proof that she's no longer the cute teenage girl sharing a chorus." ...|$|E
500|$|... "There's Got to Be a Morning After Pill" [...] {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from television critics. Eric Goldman of IGN awarded the episode an 8.5 out of 10, indicating {{that it was}} [...] "great." [...] He {{thought that it was}} indicative of an overall upward trend in the quality of Veronica Mars and praised the episode's balance between the case-of-the-week and the Dean O'Dell story arc. [...] "Like last week's episode, 'There's Got to Be a Morning After Pill' benefited from integrating already established characters into a mystery of the week." [...] He was positive towards the mystery of the week in general, stating that it made him realize {{that it was possible to}} make good episodes with only a stand-alone mystery. However, he was critical of the development of Veronica and Logan's relationship, particularly Logan's new character traits. [...] "Let's just hope they don't get back together again next week, or <b>anytime</b> <b>soon,</b> because this horse has been beaten to death as it is." [...] Kelly West of Cinema Blend was positive towards the episode, calling it [...] "jam-packed with drama". However, she stated that she would have enjoyed the episode more if Mac, Piz, Wallace, or Parker had made an appearance. Reviewer Alan Sepinwall enjoyed the pairing of Bonnie and her father, played by Chris Ellis.|$|E
500|$|Although Sharon {{also moved}} on, marrying Jack Abbott (Peter Bergman), Nick and Sharon remain in love. They kiss while Nick, {{suffering}} from amnesia, believes {{they are still}} married; Phyllis is jealous of Sharon, insulting her {{in an article in}} her magazine Restless Style. In January 2009, Nick and Sharon reunite in a sexual affair at the Abbott cabin, an event much anticipated by viewers. According to Case, Sharon wanted Nick more than anyone at the time but only if he left Phyllis; Morrow told TV Guide that although the reunion was [...] "messy", viewers wanted this for a long time. After another one-night stand Sharon becomes pregnant, briefly lying that Jack is the baby's father when Summer becomes ill and Phyllis needs Nick. Nick soon finds out, but their daughter Faith is kidnapped at birth by Nick's brother (Adam) and given to Ashley (Jack's sister). Sharon, believing Faith has died, seduces a guilty Adam. Faith is eventually reunited with her parents, and Adam's crimes are revealed. Nick and Sharon are briefly engaged that November, but they break up when she sleeps with Adam and their relationship becomes bitter. Although Case and Morrow believe the couple belong together, they are apart for several years; during which they both believed a reunion wouldn't happen <b>anytime</b> <b>soon.</b> In late 2013, the characters begin to grow closer again despite the fact that Sharon secretly switched the paternity test results of Nick's daughter Summer; Case stated in an interview that Sharon is in [...] "constant turmoil" [...] regarding her secret, and Morrow stated that he believed a reunion was a possibility given Nick's vulnerability, saying: [...] "They've worked things out before—and they could work things out again. There is always a possibility for Nick and Sharon to get back together!"

500|$|The {{producers}} and writers initially formed a general {{plan for the}} show {{through the end of}} a third season, after reading the screenplays for upcoming MCU films. In May 2016, Chloe Bennet likened {{the end of the third}} season to [...] "the end of the first book of S.H.I.E.L.D. ... the end of something bigger and the beginning of a whole new tone for the show." [...] She elaborated that [...] "the storylines that we started at the beginning of season 1 really wrapped up at the end of season 3. We've had some major losses of people who have been with us on the show since season 1. From the table read to the first day on set, there's definitely a new energy of the show" [...] moving forward. The series was moved to the later timeslot of 10 pm for the fourth season. Jed Whedon said the writers hoped to [...] "skew a little darker because of" [...] this change, with Loeb adding that [...] "It absolutely offers opportunities. I don't know that it changes things all that dramatically [...] I mean, at the end of the day, Marvel is always going to make shows that run somewhere between PG-13 and PG-16. We're not going to be making Deadpool <b>anytime</b> <b>soon</b> on [...]" [...] Marvel [...] "had a long talk with ABC about what can we get away with, so to speak" [...] in the new timeslot, which led to the inclusion of Ghost Rider in the season over one of Marvel's Netflix series, because Marvel felt [...] "that this character was right to tell [...] stories right now" [...] and having him on S.H.I.E.L.D. aided that because [...] "it was so unexpected". Loeb hoped that the combination of the later timeslot and the introduction of Ghost Rider would lead to some viewers who had stopped watching the series over the previous seasons giving it another chance.|$|E
500|$|After {{the release}} of the first season of Luke Cage, The Atlantics David Sims wrote on the pacing issue of Marvel's Netflix series, a common {{complaint}} to that point, stating, [...] "After two seasons of Daredevil, one of Jessica Jones, and now one of Luke Cage, the Netflix model feels fundamentally flawed, encouraging the kind of molasses-slow plotting comic books are designed to eschew. The problem isn’t that these shows are bad, necessarily... But they all take far too long to get going, by which point many viewers will have already tuned out." [...] He felt one of the problems was the fact that Netflix does not rely on viewers tuning into a particular series as broadcast series do each week, but rather subscribers who, if they lose interest, [...] "can take as long as they want to catch up... as long as they keep paying their subscription fee every month." [...] The Netflix series are also afforded the opportunity to explore elements in more detail, with Sims noting [...] "A lot of this detail [...] good, {{but it could have been}} considerably compressed—none of the Marvel Netflix series, so far, would have lost much by being squeezed into 10 episodes, or even 8. If Netflix shaved the 60-minute running time down quite a bit, it would likely inspire more economical—and better—storytelling from its shows." [...] Sims concluded by saying, [...] "What’s most frustrating of all is that Netflix isn’t getting rid of this approach <b>anytime</b> <b>soon.</b> Daredevil season three, Jessica Jones season two, Iron Fist, and The Punisher are all on their way, and each will follow the same 13-episode structure... The only respite may come in the form of The Defenders, a planned crossover series... over the course of just eight episodes. Who knows? The show might even surprise viewers and explain its villain’s motivations within the first hour. Until then, fans will be stuck needlessly giving over entire days to these series, while others are deterred from watching at all." [...] In her review for the first season of Iron Fist, Allison Keene of Collider.com spoke more on the pacing of Marvel's Netflix series, stating, [...] "By focusing so intently on making these series... much more grounded in a gritty real world than what we typically expect from a superhero show (like DC's candy-colored [...] on The CW), the problem is that they miss out on the key element: this [...] be fantastical entertainment." [...] With The Defenders, Jeff Jansen of Entertainment Weekly felt many improvements were made to the general complaints the previous seasons received. He said, [...] "The Defenders is far from perfect. But it’s an enjoyable superhero adventure distinguished by improvements and innovations that I hope Marvel will carry forward. Shorter seasons. More team-ups. Fewer shows. Start the consolidation by letting go of Iron Fist. If Danny Rand must persist, add him to the other shows and let the stronger players carry him." ...|$|E

2500|$|While {{there have}} been no {{proposals}} to restore Amtrak service to Nashville, {{there have been}} repeated calls from residents.

Ramsay in very strong language argued to Eisenhower that the Allies could only invade Germany if Antwerp was opened, and {{that as long as the}} three Canadian divisions fighting in the Scheldt had shortages of ammunition and artillery shells because Montgomery made the Arnhem salient his first priority, then Antwerp would not be opened <b>anytime</b> <b>soon.</b> Even Brooke wrote in his diary: [...] "I feel that Monty's strategy for once is at fault. Instead of carrying out the advance to Arnhem he ought to have made certain of Antwerp". Prompted by Ramsay, Eisenhower sent Montgomery later on 9 October 1944, a cable that emphasizing the [...] "supreme importance of Antwerp", stating that [...] "the Canadian Army will not, repeat not, be able to attack until November unless immediately supplied with adequate ammunition", and finally warning that the Allied advance into Germany would totally stop by mid-November unless Antwerp was opened in October. Montgomery replied by accusing Ramsay of making [...] "wild statements" [...] unsupported by the facts, he denied that the Canadians were having to ration ammunition, and claimed that he would soon take the Ruhr, making the Scheldt campaign a sideshow. Montgomery further issued a memo entitled [...] "Notes on Command in Western Europe" [...] demanding that he once again be made Land Forces Commander, which led to an exasperated Eisenhower telling Montgomery that the question was not the command arrangement, but rather his ability and willingness to obey orders, and that he either obey orders to clear the mouth of the Scheldt at once, or he would be sacked.|$|E
