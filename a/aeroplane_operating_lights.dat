40|$|This {{thesis is}} focused on {{measuring}} the quality of <b>lighting</b> in <b>operating</b> rooms. <b>Operating</b> <b>lights</b> are very demanding in terms of quality requirements for each parameter, so {{it is important to}} specify exactly these parameters and check them regurarly. To measure the quality of the light source, was used a special kit from Maquet. Measurement procedure was not as accurate as it was for <b>operating</b> <b>lighting</b> need, therefore, this work includes a proposal to improve the measurement of quality <b>lighting</b> in <b>operating</b> theaters. In cooperation with University Hospital Brno Bohunice University Hospital Motol and the company Maquet measured nine <b>operating</b> <b>lights,</b> each light were compared in terms of parameters such as maximum light intensity, light distribution in the surgical field. In each category were selected several lighting, which reached the best results. The various parameters were compared with values declared by the manufacturer...|$|R
