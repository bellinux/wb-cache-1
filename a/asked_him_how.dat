5|$|Mitchell’s father (also named Colin) {{came from}} an Argyllshire fishing family. Mitchell (Snr) worked in a solicitor's office and for the MacBrayne ferry company before serving in the 10th Battalion Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders in World War I. Mitchell (Snr) {{achieved}} the rank of captain (commissioned ‘in the field’) and was awarded the Military Cross at the Second Battle of Ypres but when the young Colin <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>how</b> he would only say, 'Oh, shooting rabbits'. He was badly gassed in 1918. After the war, {{he worked in the}} City of London and married a Glaswegian woman (née Gilmour) whose father worked as a manager for the LMS Railway company. The couple took up residence in the South London suburb of Purley where they had two children – Colin and Henrietta. The family lived in a modest semi-detached house and Colin would attend services at the local Presbyterian Church wearing a kilt.|$|E

Ganesha told him of his encounter with Narada and of the Brahmin's counsel. Parvati, satisfied with this response, pronounced her son the winner and, from that moment on, he was acclaimed with the name of Ganapati (conductor of the celestial armies) and Vinayaka (lord of all beings).|$|E
25|$|Lewis had {{originally}} intended only {{to write the}} one Narnia novel, The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. However, when Roger Lancelyn Green <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>how</b> a lamp post came to be standing {{in the midst of}} Narnian woodland, Lewis was intrigued enough by the question to attempt to find an answer by writing The Magician's Nephew, which features a younger version of Professor Kirke from the first novel.|$|E

25|$|In The Caves of Steel and its sequels (the {{first of}} which is The Naked Sun), Asimov paints a grim {{situation}} of an Earth dealing with an extremely large population, and of luxury-seeking Spacers who limit birth to permit great wealth and privacy. Asimov, who {{described himself as a}} claustrophile, mentioned that a reader <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>how</b> he could have imagined such an existence with no sunlight, and related that it had not struck him until then that living perpetually indoors might be construed as unpleasant.|$|E
25|$|Israeli emigrants {{working in}} low status {{immigrant}} occupations that the diaspora Jewish population tends {{not to engage}} in or has long-ago abandoned such as taxi driving, auto repair, security guards, mall cart sales and other tasks. Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir told of a waiter who once came over to her at a New York luncheon and whispered in Hebrew that there was ham in the dish she had been served. When she <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>how</b> he knew Hebrew, he told her he was an Israeli. And what work had he done in Israel, she asked. He had been a waiter, he responded.|$|E
25|$|Yerida skyrocketed in the mid-1980s, {{due to a}} {{combination}} {{of the effects of the}} 1982 Lebanon War, exposure of Israeli tourists to other cultures and new opportunities in other Western countries, and an economic crisis brought on by the 1983 Israel bank stock crisis. In 1984 and 1985, more Jews emigrated from than immigrated to Israel. At the time, the Israeli government became alarmed over the large amount of emigration, and politicians and government entities often cited statistics claiming that hundreds of thousands of Israelis were living abroad. However, these statistics may not have been accurate; around this time, Pini Herman, a demographer, interviewed an Israeli government statistician in charge of compiling data on yordim. According to Herman, the data showed that since 1948, fewer than 400,000 Israelis had moved abroad and never returned. When he <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>how</b> other government entities regularly claimed much higher figures, the statistician said that his bureau was never actually consulted.|$|E

500|$|Early in 1928 Sibelius {{made one}} of his regular visits to Berlin, to imbibe the city's musical life and to compose. He sent {{positive}} work-in-progress reports to Aino: the symphony, he said, will be [...] "wonderful". Back home in Ainola in September, he told his sister that he was [...] "writing a new work, which {{will be sent to}} America. It will still need time. But it will turn out well." [...] In December 1928, however, when his Danish publisher Wilhelm Hansen <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>how</b> the work was developing, Sibelius was less forthcoming; the symphony existed, he said, only in his head. Thereafter Sibelius's reports of the symphony's progress became equivocal, sometimes contradictory, and difficult to follow.|$|E

500|$|Hinton was {{not always}} respectful of {{military}} authority. Shortly after the New Zealanders arrived in Egypt, he was commanding a squad practising on a rifle range when visited by the division's commander, Major General Bernard Freyberg, who <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>how</b> the men were shooting. [...] "How would {{you expect them to}} bloody well shoot?", replied Hinton, [...] "not enough bloody rations, stinking heat and sand". [...] Freyberg asked him to repeat the comment, which he did word for word. Freyberg took note of Hinton's name and instructed him to carry on. There was a subsequent increase in rations, while Hinton was advised by his company commander on how best to speak to senior officers.|$|E
500|$|Waugh's Catholicism was fundamental: [...] "The Church... is {{the normal}} state of man from which men have disastrously exiled themselves." [...] He {{believed}} that the Catholic Church was the last, great defence against the encroachment of the Dark Age being ushered in by the welfare state and the spreading of working class culture. Strictly observant, Waugh admitted to Diana Cooper that his most difficult task was how to square the obligations of his faith with his indifference to his fellow men. When Nancy Mitford <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>how</b> he reconciled his often objectionable conduct with being a Christian, Waugh replied that [...] "were he not a Christian he {{would be even more}} horrible".|$|E
500|$|Despite {{the fact}} that Ragtime was his first film in 20 years, Cagney was {{immediately}} at ease: Flubbed lines and miscues were committed by his co-stars, often simply through sheer awe. Howard Rollins, who received a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination for his performance, said, [...] "I was frightened to meet Mr. Cagney. I <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>how</b> to die {{in front of the}} camera. He said 'Just die!' It worked. Who would know more about dying than him?" [...] Cagney also repeated the advice he had given to Pamela Tiffin, Joan Leslie, and Lemmon. As filming progressed, Cagney's sciatica worsened, but he finished the nine-week filming, and reportedly stayed on the set after completing his scenes to help the other actors with their dialogue.|$|E

During summer {{vacation}} when Hoffman was 10 years old, he joined Glenn while he was playing in Pawtucket. His oldest brother, Greg, was 14 years Hoffman's senior and a mentor to his two younger brothers. [...] After Hoffman's first Little League game, Greg <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>how</b> he did. Hoffman responded, [...] "I went 2-for-4, double, RBI." [...] to which Greg replied, [...] "That'll be the last (blanking) time {{you tell me how}} you did.

[...] " [...] was the guide while Greg was the drill instructor", said Hoffman.|$|E
500|$|Cobain {{originally}} {{wanted to}} name the album I Hate Myself and I Want to Die, a phrase that had originated in his journals in mid-1992. [...] At the time, the singer used the phrase as a response whenever someone <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>how</b> he was doing. [...] Cobain intended the album title as a joke; he stated he was [...] "tired of taking this band so seriously and everyone else taking it so seriously". [...] Novoselic convinced Cobain to change the title due to fear that it could potentially result in a lawsuit. [...] The band then considered using Verse Chorus Verse—a title taken from its song [...] "Verse Chorus Verse", and an earlier working title of [...] "Sappy"—before eventually settling on In Utero. [...] The final title was taken from a poem written by Courtney Love.|$|E
500|$|The {{first year}} Lightning Bar stood as a {{breeding}} stallion his stud fee, the amount charged to breed a mare to him, was $250 (approximately $ as of [...] ) but only nine mares were bred to him. The next year, he bred 11mares, but in 1956, he bred 102 mares at $500 (approximately $ as of [...] ) each. One of Pollard's attempts to advertise his stallion involved letting {{one of his}} ranch hands take the horse to a local jackpot roping. Pollard assumed that the hand would just ride Lightning Bar around and show him off, but he later discovered that more was involved. Pollard said later that [...] "I should have been suspicious when he (the ranch hand) returned with Lightning Bar that afternoon, with a sheepish grin on his face. I <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>how</b> the horse was received and he said 'The stud did good and I won the jackpot!' After congratulating him, I asked which rope horse he had used.

500|$|Recording {{sessions}} for the group's self-titled debut took place from September to December 1991. The album {{was released on}} March 31, 1992, on compact disc, vinyl, and audio cassette. Ice-T states that Body Count was intentionally different from his solo hip hop albums in that [...] "An Ice T album has intelligence, and at times it has ignorance. Sometimes it has anger, sometimes it has questions. But Body Count was intended to reflect straight anger. It {{was supposed to be}} the voice of the angry brother, without answers. [...] If you took a kid and you put him in jail with a microphone and <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>how</b> he feels, you'd get Body Count: 'Fuck that. Fuck school. Fuck the police.' You wouldn't get intelligence or compassion. You'd get raw anger." [...] From the album, [...] "There Goes The Neighborhood" [...] was released as a single, while [...] "Body Count's in the House" [...] was featured in the film Universal Soldier.|$|E
500|$|Ann Frewen died in May 1880. The inquest {{into her}} death {{was held at}} the nearby Bull and Butcher public house, presided over by the county coroner, Frederick Charsley. Part of the inquest's remit was to {{consider}} the matter of Ellen's subsequent care. Thomas Frewen was reported as being [...] "quite evasive" [...] when the coroner <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>how</b> Ellen was fed, and although Hayman testified to reaffirm his stance that Ellen's illness was genuine, Reverend Studholme was less certain. However, he could not offer any evidence to this effect, even though he had made several unannounced visits to Ellen's home. Charsley concluded that Thomas could not look after Ellen, as his job left him absent from their home all day, and that {{the other members of the}} household would be too busy with its upkeep. Therefore, he turned Ellen's care over to her married sisters, Elizabeth Stacey and Grace Blackall, both of whom lived in Turville. The cause of Ann's death was found to be oedema of the heart, from which she had been suffering for many years.|$|E
500|$|Before he {{shot his}} own head-smashing scene, {{he spoke to}} Gaspar Noé and <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>how</b> he had done a similar scene in his film Irréversible (2002). Crossing the line from romance to violence, the scene begins with the Driver and Irene kissing tenderly. What they share is really a goodbye kiss, as he then becomes a [...] "werewolf," [...] violently stomping the hit man's head in. Subsequently, Irene sees the Driver in a new light. Of this scene Refn said: Every movie {{has to have a}} hearta place where it defines itselfand in every movie I've made there's always a scene that does that. On Drive, {{it was hard for me}} to wrap my head around it. I {{realized}} I needed to show in one situation that driver is the hopelessly romantic knight, but he's also completely psychotic and is willing to use any kind of violence to protect innocence. But that scene was never written. As I was going along, it just kind of popped up. In March 2012, Interiors, an online journal that is concerned with the relationship between architecture and film, released an issue that discussed how space is used in this scene. The issue highlights Refn's use of constricted space and his way of creating a balance between romance and violence.|$|E
