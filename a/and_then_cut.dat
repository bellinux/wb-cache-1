5|$|Sindhu {{was given}} the ever-full bowl of amrita (elixir of life) as a boon from the Sun-god. The demon was warned that he could drink from the bowl {{as long as it}} was intact. So to protect the bowl, he {{swallowed}} it. Sindhu terrorized the three worlds, so the gods asked Gunesha for help. Gunesha defeated Sindhu's army, cut his general Kamalasura into three pieces <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>cut</b> open Sindhu's body, emptying the amrita bowl and thus killing the demon. The creator-god Brahma is described as having built the Morgaon shrine, and marrying Siddhi and Buddhi to Ganesha. At the end of this incarnation, Gunesha returned to his celestial abode, giving his peacock mount to his younger brother Skanda, with whom the peacock mount is generally associated.|$|E
5|$|The {{stranding}} of the Northern bottlenose whale mainly {{happens in}} two {{villages in the}} northern part of Suðuroy: Hvalba and Sandvík. It is believed that it happens because of a navigation problem of the whale, because there are isthmuses on these places, where the distance between the east and west coasts are short, around one kilometer or so. And for some reason it seems like the bottlenose whale want to take a short cut through what it thinks is a sound, and too late it discovers, that is on shallow ground and is unable to turn around again. It happened on 30 August 2012, when two Northern bottlenose whales swam ashore to the gorge Sigmundsgjógv in Sandvík. Two men who were working on the harbour noticed these whales, and some time later they had either died by themselves or were killed by the locals <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>cut</b> up for food for the people of Sandvík and Hvalba (Hvalba municipality).|$|E

25|$|The German Baltic Sea Division {{landed in}} Hanko on 3 April.

Another German unit, Detachment Brandenstein, landed 75 kilometres east of Helsinki in Loviisa 12 April. The original plan for Detachment Brandenstein was {{to attack the}} Red stronghold of Kotka <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>cut</b> the Saint Petersburg railway in Kouvola. For some reason, the Germans finally decided to enter north to Lahti, instead of Kotka in the east.|$|E
25|$|However, the 49ers {{countered with}} a 50-yard, 9-play drive that took 4:41 off the clock, and {{included}} Montana's 22-yard pass to receiver Mike Wilson and seven consecutive running plays. Wilson's reception was a play Walsh {{specifically designed for}} the Super Bowl that capitalized on the Bengals doing a long-run coverage on Wilson anytime he ran a pass route over 20 yards; Wilson simply ran 25 yards straight out <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>cut</b> back to receive Montana's precision pass. Wersching ended the drive with a 40-yard field goal to give San Francisco a 23–14 lead with just 5 minutes left.|$|E

25|$|In Bargello quilting, long {{strips of}} fabric are sewn {{together}} along their long sides. Then {{the first and}} last strip are sewn together, forming a loop. The loop is laid flat on a table, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>cut</b> vertically (in the opposite direction from how the strips were sewn together) to make many narrow loops. The quilter then opens the loops by pulling out the stitching between two pieces of fabric, making a long, flat strip. Finally, all the strips are sewn together. By opening the loops in between different pieces of fabric (for instance, {{between the first and second}} piece on one loop, then the second and third piece on the next loop), the artist can make the colors of the quilt appear to shift and wave. Slicing the loops very narrowly makes the waving and movement appear sharp and fast; cutting wide loops creates more gentle movement in the quilt.|$|E
25|$|The cloth badge was {{introduced}} for Eagle Scouts attending the 2nd World Scout Jamboree in Denmark in 1924 with a design {{based on the}} hat pin. The Eagle Scout merit badge was sewn onto {{the top of the}} merit badge sash that was also created for the jamboree. The design is quite similar to the current badge. As with other patches of the time, the rank badges were embroidered onto rolls of fabric <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>cut.</b> The edges were folded under before sewing the badge onto the sash. Initially produced on tan cloth, it was later switched to olive for the Boy Scout uniform and white and blue to match the various Sea Scout uniforms. In 1933, BSA was removed from all of the Eagle Scout insignia, including the badge. The text Eagle Scout and Boy Scouts of America was added to the border, and Be Prepared was added to the scroll. These badges were embroidered with silk thread, switching to cotton in 1940.|$|E
25|$|Fascism {{operated}} from a Social Darwinist view {{of human}} relations. Their aim was to promote superior individuals and weed out the weak. In terms of economic practice, this meant promoting the interests of successful businessmen while destroying trade unions and other organizations of the working class. Fascist governments declared the trade union movement illegal, {{and replaced it with}} labor organizations under the direct control of the government, which ensured that workers could not undertake any effective economic action. Membership in these labor organizations was compulsory, their leaders were appointed by the ruling party rather than elected by the members, and they were presented as a new type of unions which would serve to harmonize the interests of workers and businesses. However, in practice, they primarily served the interests of major business owners, who were able to lobby the ruling party to appoint the leaders they desired. In order to maintain and increase the profits of industry, fascist states eliminated the possibility of mass protest <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>cut</b> wages either directly or indirectly. Strikes were strictly banned, and prison sentences could be given to employees who stopped working as a group.|$|E
50|$|When the {{metamorphosis}} is complete, {{the adult}} moth regurgitates a fluid {{to soften the}} tough cocoon <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>cuts</b> a hole using sharp hooks {{on the base of}} each forewing.

25|$|After a Patriots punt {{began the}} second half, the Jets started their next {{possession}} {{from their own}} 23-yard line. Three offensive penalties later, with the Jets at 2nd-and-25, defensive back Brandon Meriweather earned his first career interception on an errant Favre pass, giving the Patriots the ball at the Jets' 31-yard line. Despite a Kris Jenkins sack of Cassel to begin the drive, the Patriots moved into the red zone on a 22-yard completion to running back Kevin Faulk on a 3rd-and-9 play. Three plays later, Morris ran it in from the Jets' 1-yard-line for a touchdown, extending the Patriots' lead to 13–3. On an ensuing Jets punt, a 24-yard Faulk return set up the Patriots' next drive at the Jets' 39-yard line; nine plays later, a 28-yard Gostkowski field goal gave the Patriots a 16–3 lead and ended the third-quarter scoring. Beginning from their own 20-yard line for the sixth time in the game, the Jets drove into the Patriots' red zone <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>cut</b> the Patriots' lead to 16–10 on a 2-yard touchdown catch by wide receiver Chansi Stuckey. The Patriots' next drive went for 71 yards and ended on a 27-yard Gostkowski field goal to build the Patriots' lead to 19–10. This would be the final score, as the Jets' next drive, which included a 20-yard sack of Favre by Adalius Thomas, went three-and-out and the Patriots held the ball for the final 3:45 in the game. The win brought the Patriots' record to 2–0 and kept the team tied for {{first place in the}} AFC East. Gostkowski finished the day 4-for-4 on field goals and earned five touchbacks on six kickoffs.|$|E

500|$|Sketches were filmed {{en masse}} <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>cut</b> into episodes by the {{producers}} based on creative rather than chronological or other educational considerations, {{in the manner}} of a more traditional sketch-comedy series.

Many are recognisable parodies of other popular media or celebrities, in formats ranging from spoof commercials to mock TV shows, newscasts, magazines, video games and film trailers. Notable parody inspirations included Masterchef, Wife Swap, Come Dine with Me and The Apprentice.
