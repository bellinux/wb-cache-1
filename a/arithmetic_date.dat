40|$|We {{show that}} Gödel's {{negative}} results concerning <b>arithmetic,</b> which <b>date</b> {{back to the}} 1930 s, and the ancient "sand pile" paradox (known also as "sorites paradox") pose the questions {{of the use of}} fuzzy sets and of the effect of a measuring device on the experiment. The consideration of these facts led, in thermodynamics, to a new one-parameter family of ideal gases. In turn, this leads to a new approach to probability theory (including the new notion of independent events). As applied to economics, this gives the correction, based on Friedman's rule, to Irving Fisher's "Main Law of Economics" and enables us to consider the theory of debt crisis.

25|$|The ancient Chinese had {{advanced}} <b>arithmetic</b> studies <b>dating</b> from the Shang Dynasty and continuing through the Tang Dynasty, from basic numbers to advanced algebra. The ancient Chinese used a positional notation {{similar to that}} of the Greeks. Since they also lacked a symbol for zero, they had one set of symbols for the unit's place, and a second set for the ten's place. For the hundred's place they then reused the symbols for the unit's place, and so on. Their symbols were based on the ancient counting rods. It is a complicated question to determine exactly when the Chinese started calculating with positional representation, but it was definitely before 400BC. The ancient Chinese were the first to meaningfully discover, understand, and apply negative numbers as explained in the Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art (Jiuzhang Suanshu), which was written by Liu Hui.|$|R
25|$|Calendrical {{calculations}} {{are made}} consistent and straightforward for <b>arithmetic</b> operations if <b>dates</b> are first converted to an ordinal {{number of days}} relative to an agreed-upon epoch, {{in this case the}} Revised Julian epoch, which was the same as the Gregorian epoch.

To find a past or future date, convert a given date to an ordinal day count, subtract or add the desired number of days, then convert the result to a Revised Julian date.|$|R
40|$|AbstractLogarithmic {{number system}} can be highly {{considered}} {{as an alternative to}} floating-point, specifically for applications that require a wide dynamic range of numbers for their <b>arithmetic</b> operations. To <b>date,</b> its implementation is still restricted by complexity of performing addition and subtraction functions as a result of using large lookup tables. In this paper, a method is revealed to substantially reduce these tables by means of using second order co-transformation procedure. The results predominantly show that the proposed technique offers significantly better speed, area and accuracy than current state-of-the-art logarithmic number system...|$|R
40|$|Calendrical savants {{can name}} the weekdays for dates from {{different}} years with remarkable speed and accuracy. Whether calculation {{rather than just}} memory is involved is disputed. Grounds for doubting whether they can calculate are reviewed and criteria for attributing date calculation skills to them are discussed. At least some calendrical savants possess date calculation skills. A behavioural characteristic observed in many calendrical savants is increased response time for questions about more remote years. This may be because more remote years require more calculation or because closer years are more practised. An experiment is reported that used {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} to attempt to discriminate between these explanations. Only two savants could be scanned and excessive head movement corrupted one savant's mental arithmetic data. Nevertheless, there was increased parietal activation during both mental <b>arithmetic</b> and <b>date</b> questions and this region showed increased activity with more remote dates. These results suggest that the calendrical skills observed in savants result from intensive practice with calculations used in solving mental arithmetic problems. The mystery is not how they solve these problems, but why...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND Calendar time, age and {{duration}} are chronological objects. They represent an instant or a time period. Age {{and duration}} are usually expressed in units with varying lengths. The {{number of days}} {{in a month or}} a year depends on the position on the calendar. The units are also not homogeneous and the structure influences measurement. One solution, common in demography, is to use units that are large enough for the results not to be seriously affected by differences in length and structure. Another approach is to take the idiosyncrasy of calendars into account and to work directly with calendar dates. The technology that enables logical and <b>arithmetic</b> operations on <b>dates</b> is available. OBJECTIVE To illustrate logical and <b>arithmetic</b> operations on <b>dates</b> and conversions between time measurements. METHODS Software packages include utilities to process dates. I use existing and a few new utilities in R to illustrate operations on dates and conversions between calendar dates and elapsed time since a reference moment or a reference event. Three demographic applications are presented. The first is the impact of preferences for dates and days on demographic indicators. The second is event history analysis with time-varying covariates. The third is microsimulation of life histories in continuous time. CONCLUSIONS The technology exists to perform operations directly on dates, enabling more precise calculations of duration and elapsed time in demographic analysis. It eliminates the need for (a) approximations and (b) transformations of dates, such as Century Month Code, that are convenient for computing durations but are a barrier to interpretation. Operations on dates, such as the computation of age, should consider time units of varying length...|$|R

This study was done to make use and determine the effectiveness of Child Literature activity in develop the children's parents reading book habituation which are educated their child in Duzce University Preschool. This is thinking of the mother and father's candidates will be effect of their habituation attitude about reading book positive direction through child literature. In this study, this is wanted to practice the Child Literature activities by children's parents at home ambiance along the 12 weeks and on verge of 30 min. twice a week and addition to this are wanted to each child parents to practice at school 30 min. per a week of a subject about Child Literature activities which was selected by parents. The horizon of research was composed by 3 - 4 - 5 age of girl and boy students which arestudied at Düzce University Kindergarten at 2012 - 2013 academicyear. The Scale of Attitude About Reading Book which validity and reliability was made by Gömleksiz was apply and checked {{of the differences between}} before activities first test and last test points as semi-empirical (one-group pretest-posttest design). At the end of the along the 12 weeks. The <b>dates</b> <b>arithmetic</b> average and Standard diversion were given and the (paired test) t-test was used to statistic analyses. When the diagnosis was being analyzed, there was an modicum changing about parent's total points of the habituation of reading book attitude scale was increased an amount of points betwixt first test and last test but this increasing don’t marked being significantly. To be in process of education of activities alt dimensions are observed as statistical which was found that the most increased sub dimension of efficacy among the sub dimensions of requirement, effectiveness, avidity, affection, habituation and benefits. According the results of this study, this was seen appear perform to Child Literary Activities which are practiced by parents are an efficiency assistance factor which was educated being efficiency of parent's habituation of reading book but this supporting factor is able to not enough to developing parent's habituation of reading book being solitary.
