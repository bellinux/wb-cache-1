5|$|Double Fine {{demonstrated}} an in-progress {{version of the}} remastered game at the 2014 IndieCade event in October 2014; new features included higher-resolution textures and improved resolution for the character models as well as having real-time lighting models, {{and the ability to}} switch back and forth between this presentation and the original graphics <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>touch</b> of a control. The remastered game runs in 4:3 aspect ratio but has an option to stretch this to a 16:9 ratio rather than render in a native 16:9 ratio. The remaster includes improvements to the control scheme developed by Pfaff's patch and other alternate control schemes in addition to the original tank-like controls, including analogue controls for console versions and point-and-click controls for computer versions. The game's soundtrack was fully orchestrated through performances of the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra (who also performed the soundtrack for Double Fine's Broken Age). The remastered version also includes developer commentary, which can be activated via the options menu and listened to at various points in the game. The PlayStation version also features cloud saving between the PS4 and Vita versions.|$|E

Due to the bulky tank rear cargo space was considerably reduced. Drivers could choose whether their car should run on petrol or CNG <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>touch</b> of a button. On Bi-Fuel models the temperature gauge in the instrument cluster {{was replaced by a}} level gauge for the gas tank. Several options, such as a trip computer and sports suspension, were not available for Bi-Fuel models.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1990s Tyco Toys created {{a line of}} action figures called The Incredible Crash Dummies based on the {{characters}} from the NHTSA television advertisements. They were intended to fall apart <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>touch</b> of a button on their abdomens. Vehicles which could be crashed into walls and broken were also produced. Dummies and vehicles were easily reassembled. They prompted a one-hour television special, The Adventures of the Incredible Crash Dummies. Unique for its time, the cartoon was produced entirely using 3D computer animation techniques. A comic book series and a video game for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System and Game Boy were produced.|$|E

25|$|The {{advent of}} {{incandescent}} gas lighting in factories, homes {{and in the}} streets, replacing oil lamps and candles with steady clear light, almost matching daylight in its colour, turned night into day for many—making night shift work possible in industries where light was all important—in spinning, weaving and making up garments etc. The social significance of this change is difficult for generations brought up with lighting after dark available <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>touch</b> of a switch to appreciate. Not only was industrial production accelerated, but streets were made safe, social intercourse facilitated and reading and writing made more widespread. Gas works were built in almost every town, main streets were brightly illuminated and gas was piped in the streets {{to the majority of}} urban households. The invention of the gas meter and the pre-payment meter in the late 1880s {{played an important role in}} selling town gas to domestic and commercial customers.|$|E
500|$|The GTS has usually used a more {{powerful}} engine and robust drivetrain than other HSV models, however the E-Series 1 GTS shared the 6.0L LS2 V8 engine with 412bhp (307kW) of power and 405lb·ft (550 N·m) of torque, with the cheaper Clubsport and the luxury Senator. The major difference between the E-Series GTS and other HSV models in the range is the Magnetic Ride Control (MRC, or [...] "MagneRide"). MRC utilises magnetorheological dampers to improve the car's handling and dynamics. In the GTS, the MRC can be switched between Performance and Track response modes <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>touch</b> of a button. MRC is not available on the Clubsport; it is standard equipment of the Senator, but switches between [...] "Luxury" [...] and [...] "Performance", there is no [...] "Track" [...] mode like the GTS has.|$|E
500|$|Now {{established}} as a successful film director, Donen continued his solo career at MGM with Fearless Fagan in 1952. Based on a true story, the film stars Carleton Carpenter as a GI who brings his tame lion {{with him when he}} joins the army. In 1953 Donen made the musical Give a Girl a Break. The film stars Debbie Reynolds, Marge Champion and Helen Wood as three aspiring dancers competing for the lead in a new Broadway musical. Bob Fosse, Gower Champion and Kurt Kasznar also appear, with music by Lane and Ira Gershwin. The most famous scene is the [...] "Give a Girl a Break" [...] dance between Reynolds and Fosse, which was choreographed backwards and then played in reverse to create the illusion that the two are surrounded by hundreds of balloons that instantly appear <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>touch</b> of their fingers. Shooting the film became a bitter experience for Donen due to a major on-set fight over the film's choreography between Fosse and Gower Champion. The fight split the cast and crew with Reynolds and Marge taking Gower's side and Donen taking Fosse's side. The film was not well reviewed upon release, but its reputation has grown over the years.|$|E

2500|$|On 12 March 2009, the [...] "Boost Specials" [...] pack was released. It {{featured}} two cars: the Carson Extreme Hotrod and the Montgomery Hawker Mech.

The vehicle dynamics system were rewired so that the Carson performs more realistically than any other car in the game.

2500|$|The {{later years}} of this {{generation}} of Toronado saw new features mostly confined to minor styling tweaks to the grille and trim, although in 1977, the XS and XSR models debuted. Both featured a three-sided, hot wire [...] "bent-glass" [...] rear window and, on the XSR, electric t-tops which slid inwards <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>touch</b> of a button. However, as built in prototype form, the XSR had no means of channeling water away from the retractable sections, and water would inevitably leak into the cabin. No workable {{solution to the problem}} was found, and as such, the XSR model was scrapped. The XS, which did enter production, was offered with GM's more reliable (and no doubt more leak-resistant) Astroroof sliding sunroof instead. Air conditioning was standard.|$|E
2500|$|The {{final report}} of the TSB states: [...] "During the flare, the {{aircraft}} entered a heavy shower area, and the crew's forward visibility was significantly reduced {{as they entered the}} downpour."

The only real change in the engine area was the switch from a vacuum advanced to an electronic advanced distributor, yet that did not increase the power. Toyota switched to a 4.10:1 rear gear ratio for the P-type and a 3.73:1 for the L-type. As for the optional automatic transmission, they replaced the A43DL 4-speed with a newly designed A43DE 4-speed.

[...] Luke Lewis of NME referred to the song as [...] "a comet-trail of sadness and exhilaration that's easily the equal of Robyn's breakthrough hit, 'With Every Heartbeat'." [...] The Guardians Michael Hann stated that song's [...] "pulsing synths and electronic percussion manage to sound both jackbooted and ineffably melancholy." [...] Jer Fairall wrote for PopMatters that [...] "he aggressive stun-gun rhythm of 'Dancing on My Own' can't hide a classic drama-played-out-on-the-dancefloor scenario inherited from standard bearers like ABBA's 'Dancing Queen' and Madonna's 'Into the Groove', nor is it cold enough not to melt <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>touch</b> of Robyn's warm, yearning vocals or the song's shimmering keyboard chime." [...] Matthew Horton of BBC Music described [...] "Dancing on My Own" [...] – along with [...] "Fembot" [...] and [...] "Cry When You Get Older" [...] – as [...] "scorchingly catchy, and laced with Robyn's familiar cordial of sparkling hook mixed with unutterable poignancy." ...|$|E
