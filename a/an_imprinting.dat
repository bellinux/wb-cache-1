25|$|At {{the same}} time as the {{generation}} of the gynogenetic and androgenetic embryos discussed above, mouse embryos were also being generated that contained only small regions that were derived from either a paternal or maternal source. The generation of a series of such uniparental disomies, which together span the entire genome, allowed the creation of <b>an</b> <b>imprinting</b> map. Those regions which when inherited from a single parent result in a discernible phenotype contain imprinted gene(s). Further research showed that within these regions there were often numerous imprinted genes. Around 80% of imprinted genes are found in clusters such as these, called imprinted domains, suggesting a level of co-ordinated control. More recently, genome-wide screens to identify imprinted genes have used differential expression of mRNAs from control fetuses and parthenogenetic or androgenetic fetuses hybridized to expression arrays, allele-specific gene expression using SNP genotyping arrays, transcriptome sequencing, and in silico prediction pipelines.|$|E

5000|$|KCNQ1 {{overlapping}} transcript 1, {{also known}} as KCNQ1OT1, is a long non-coding RNA gene found in the KCNQ1 locus. This locus consists of 8-10 protein-coding genes, specifically expressed from the maternal allele (including the KCNQ1 gene), and the paternally expressed non-coding RNA gene KCNQ1OT1. [...] KCNQ1OT1 and KCNQ1 are imprinted genes and are part of <b>an</b> <b>imprinting</b> control region (ICR). Mitsuya identified that KCNQ1OT1 is an antisense transcript of KCNQ1.

5000|$|The Honored Matres are {{characterized}} by their extremely violent tendencies {{and their ability to}} imprint a man sexually, amplifying his orgasmic response to such an ecstatic height that the victim of <b>an</b> <b>imprinting</b> becomes [...] "addicted" [...] to his imprinter, thereby becoming a willing slave of the Honored Matre who [...] "marks" [...] him. Both of these qualities are presumably evolutions of the unbridled sexual energies of the Siaynoq communion once enjoyed by the Fish Speakers with the God Emperor Leto II Atreides. The sexual imprinting practiced by the Honored Matres also hints at their roots in the original Bene Gesserit, who possessed similar, though significantly less potent, abilities.|$|E

50|$|Nymph's {{original}} {{mission was}} to retrieve Ikaros and return her to Synapse, however, she is physically weaker than her and fails in the mission after awakening Ikaros's Uranus Queen ability, and is consequently heavily punished and abused. After spending time with Tomoki and his friends, she begins to like humans, and soon develops feelings for Tomoki, albeit in an aloof fashion. Nymph eventually betrays Synapse: in the manga she tries to surprise attack the Harpies, while in the anime she sides with Ikaros. In both cases, her wings are consequently ripped off by the Harpies, but Tomoki and friends manage to free her from her link to her master. The wings regenerate when she accepts Tomoki as her new master. After the regrowth, Nymph needs to go through <b>an</b> <b>Imprinting</b> process required for her master; she eventually asks Tomoki, but he refuses and states that he wants her to live freely.|$|E

50|$|This gene encodes {{a highly}} basic protein {{localized}} to the nucleus. The evolutionarily constrained {{open reading frame}} is found on a bicistronic transcript which has a downstream ORF encoding the small nuclear ribonucleoprotein polypeptide N. The upstream coding region utilizes the first three exons of the transcript, a region that {{has been identified as}} <b>an</b> <b>imprinting</b> center. Multiple transcription initiation sites have been identified and extensive alternative splicing occurs in the 5' untranslated region but the full-length nature of these transcripts has not been determined. An alternate exon has been identified that substitutes for exon 4 and leads to a truncated, monocistronic transcript. Alternative splicing or deletion caused by a translocation event in the 5' untranslated region or coding region of this gene leads to Angelman syndrome or Prader-Willi syndrome due to parental imprint switch failure. The function of this protein is not yet known.|$|E

50|$|Almost all {{the genes}} at the Kcnq1 loci are maternally inherited, except the paternally {{expressed}} antisense ncRNA Kcnqot1. Transgenic mice with truncated Kcnq1ot fail to silence the adjacent genes, suggesting that Kcnqot1 {{is crucial to}} the imprinting of genes on the paternal chromosome. It appears that Kcnqot1 is able to direct the trimethylation of lysine 9 (H3K9me3) and 27 of histone 3 (H3K27me3) to <b>an</b> <b>imprinting</b> centre that overlaps the Kcnqot1 promoter and actually resides within a Kcnq1 sense exon. Similar to HOTAIR (see above), Eed-Ezh2 Polycomb complexes are recruited to the Kcnq1 loci paternal chromosome, possibly by Kcnqot1, where they may mediate gene silencing through repressive histone methylation. A differentially methylated imprinting centre also overlaps the promoter of a long antisense ncRNA Air that is responsible for the silencing of neighbouring genes at the Igf2r locus on the paternal chromosome. The presence of allele-specific histone methylation at the Igf2r locus suggests Air also mediates silencing via chromatin modification.|$|E
50|$|PWS is {{frequently}} {{found to be}} the reason for secondary obesity due to early onset hyperphagia - the abnormal increase in appetite for consumption of food.There are known three molecular causes of Prader-Willi syndrome development. One of them consists in micro-deletions of the chromosome region 15q11-q13. 70% of patients present a 5-7-Mb de novo deletion in the proximal region of the paternal chromosome 15. The second frequent genetic abnormality (~ 25-30% of cases) is maternal uniparental disomy of chromosome 15. The mechanism is due to maternal meiotic non-disjunction followed by mitotic loss of the paternal chromosome 15 after fertilization. The third cause for PWS is the disruption of the imprinting process on the paternally inherited chromosome 15 (epigenetic phenomena). This disruption is present in approximately 2-5% of affected individuals. Less than 20% of individuals with <b>an</b> <b>imprinting</b> defect are found to have a very small deletion in the PWS imprinting centre region, located at the 5′ end of the SNRPN gene.|$|E

30|$|On the contrary, in R 2 P NIL, {{a roller}} press {{mechanism}} {{is used to}} provide the imprinting force onto a rigid surface as shown previously in Figure  3. Since a roller press mechanism is utilized in roller-based NIL, the actual contact area during imprinting is only a line along the roller {{in contact with the}} substrate rather than the entire stamp area in P 2 P NIL. This very much reduces the required imprinting force in the NIL process [32, 33], which may go as low as 200  N to achieve <b>an</b> <b>imprinting</b> pressure of approximately 1  bar for <b>an</b> <b>imprinting</b> width of 300  mm [6]. Additionally, due to the line contact, the roller-based NIL process has the advantage of reduced issues regarding trapped air bubbles, thickness variation, and dust pollutants, which also greatly improve its replication uniformity [34, 35].|$|E

40|$|Ducklings (5 to 28 days old) {{were trained}} to peck a pole on fixed-ratio, fixed-interval, and {{multiple}} schedules using brief presentation of <b>an</b> <b>imprinting</b> stimulus as the response-contingent event. Other ducklings {{of the same age}} were trained similarly except that reinforcement consisted of access to water. With water reinforcement the typical fixed-ratio (“break-run”), fixed-interval (“scallop”), and multiple schedule response patterns were readily established and consistently maintained. With the imprinting stimulus these schedule effects were inconsistent in some subjects and virtually nonexistent in others, despite extended training. Schedule control with the imprinting stimulus was not improved by the use of a reinforcement signaling procedure which enhances responding reinforced by electrical brain stimulation on intermittent schedules. However, the overall rates of responding and the extinction functions generated after reinforcement with water versus the imprinting stimulus were comparable. These findings imply that control by temporal and discriminative stimuli may be relatively weak when a young organism's behavior is reinforced by presentation of <b>an</b> <b>imprinting</b> stimulus...|$|E
40|$|Some {{genes that}} affect {{development}} and behavior in mammals {{are known to}} be imprinted; and ⩾ 1 % of all mammalian genes are imprinted. Hence, incorporating <b>an</b> <b>imprinting</b> parameter into linkage analysis may increase the power to detect linkage for these traits. Here we propose theoretical justifications for a recently developed model for testing of linkage, in the presence of genetic imprinting, between a quantitative-trait locus and a polymorphic marker; this is achieved in the variance-components framework. We also incorporate sex-specific recombination fractions into this model. We discuss the effects that imprinting and nonimprinting have on the power of the usual variance-components method and on the variance-components method that incorporates <b>an</b> <b>imprinting</b> parameter. We provide noncentrality parameters {{that can be used to}} determine the sample size necessary to attain a specified power for a given significance level, which is useful in the planning of a linkage study.

40|$|The {{characteristics}} of memory {{for the position}} of <b>an</b> <b>imprinting</b> object were investigated in junglefowl chicks (Gallus gallus spadiceus). Subjects were exposed individually and continuously to <b>an</b> <b>imprinting</b> object located {{in one of the}} two back quadrants of their home cage ('training quadrant'). Positioning of chicks in a test cage was studied from 7 to 11 days after hatching. In experiment 1 chicks preferred the training quadrant over the other back quadrant when tested in an empty cage, but not when two identical training objects were present, one in each back quadrant. In tests with one training object present, chicks showed more shrill calling when the object was in a novel position than when it was in the training position, but only during the first minute of a 5 -min test. The strength of position preferences was independent of the effectiveness of the training object as <b>an</b> <b>imprinting</b> stimulus. In experiment 2 a, chicks switched the position preference in an empty cage from the training quadrant to the other back quadrant after 2 h of exposure to the training object in that back quadrant of the home cage. In experiment 2 b however, chicks still preferred the original training shape to a novel shape, after 2 h of exposure to an object with that novel shape. These results show that position memory in filial behaviour is less stable than memory for the physical properties of the imprinting object, and that position responses occur when chicks are motivated to seek contact with the object...|$|E
