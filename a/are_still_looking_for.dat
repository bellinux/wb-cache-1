60|$|I {{do not see}} the Press Congress {{getting through}} such matters as these in a session of weeks or months. The idea the Germans betrayed at Brest, that things were going {{to be done in the}} Versailles fashion by great moustached heroes {{frowning}} and drawing lines with a large black soldierly thumbnail across maps, is--old-fashioned. They have made their eastern treaties, it is true, in this mode, but they <b>are</b> <b>still</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> some really responsible government to keep them now that they are made. From first to last clearly the main peace negotiations are going to follow unprecedented courses. This preliminary discussion of war aims by means of great public speeches, that has been getting more and more explicit now for many months, is quite unprecedented. Apparently all the broad preliminaries are to be stated and accepted in the sight of all mankind before even an armistice occurs on the main, the western front. The German diplomatists hate this process. So do a lot of ours. So do some of the diplomatic Frenchmen. The German junkers are dodging and lying, they are fighting desperately to keep back everything they possibly can for the bargaining and bullying and table-banging of the council chamber, but that way there is no peace. And when at last Germany says snip sufficiently to the Allies' snap, and the Peace Congress begins, it will almost certainly be as unprecedented as its prelude. Before it meets, the broad lines of the settlement will have been drawn plainly with the approval of the mass of mankind.|$|E
