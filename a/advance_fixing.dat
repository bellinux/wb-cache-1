30|$|While {{breeding}} {{for high}} Zn rice, special {{attention should be}} given to the amount of anti-nutrients as they significantly influence Zn bioavailability. Phytate is the major anti-nutrient inhibiting the quantity of Zn absorbed. In rice, Zn is preferentially stored together with phytate, which is a strong chelator of divalent cations (Bohn et al. 2008; Hambidge et al. 2010; Petry et al. 2012). Hence, selections should be made for low phytate content. The use of high Zn donors with low phytate, selection of segregating lines and <b>advanced</b> <b>fixed</b> lines with low phytate, and integrating phytate phenotyping along with grain Zn in the breeding program will help in developing high Zn lines with low phytate content. Recently by mutation breeding, several mutants with low phytate content have been developed and are good resources as low-phytate donors in breeding programs (Liu et al. 2007).|$|R

The existing four lane highway will split into three different roadways: two one-lane exits and one two-lane throughway.

5000|$|While {{determinism}} usually {{refers to}} a naturalistically explainable causality of events, predeterminism seems by definition to suggest a person or a [...] "someone" [...] who is controlling or planning the causality of events before they occur and who then perhaps resides beyond the natural, causal universe. This creates a definitional conflict because predeterminism, by this understanding, logically leads to {{a belief in the}} existence of a conscious being who must determine all actions and events in advance and who, possessing such seeming omnipotence, almost certainly operates outside of the laws of nature. This conscious entity is probably, then, a being who is omnipotent as well as presumably supernatural and omniscient. The definitional confusion here is that there is already a name for this very concept: predestination. Predestination asserts that a supremely powerful being has, in <b>advance,</b> <b>fixed</b> all events and outcomes in the universe; it is a famous doctrine of the Calvinists in Christian theology.|$|R

40|$|Previous {{concepts}} of time flow mechanisms are inadequate for categorizing or describing the algorithms for time flow which may prove most efficient {{for a particular}} systems application. The work of Kiviat [6] provides a more meaningful categorization. The patrolling repairman problem serves {{as an example of}} the ambiguity and inconsistency in the use of fixed time and next-event classification. Three algorithms for time flow in the patrolling model are offered. Theoretical development is provided for the two more sophisticated algorithms [...] the variable increment (VIA) and the minimum increment comparison (MICA). Comparison of execution times for the three algorithms shows the constant increment (CI) to be generally more efficient. The concept of a continuum of algorithms for representing the passage of time is <b>advanced.</b> <b>Fixed</b> time methods with Δ t considered a "clock tick" define one end of the continuum, and next-event methods utilizing strictly the push down/pop up stack approach define the other. Between these two extremes lie other algorithms possessing characteristics of both but which may prove more advantageous for any specific application of discrete system simulation. ...|$|R

To the reverie, rather than the investigation, to the dream, rather than the deliberation, of the architect, we recommend it, as a branch of art in which instinct will do more than precept, and inspiration than technicality. The correspondence of our villa architecture with our natural scenery may be determined with far greater accuracy, and will require careful investigation.|$|R
40|$|When target-defining {{features}} are specified in advance, attentional target selection in visual search {{is controlled by}} preparatory top-down task sets. We used ERP measures to study voluntary target selection {{in the absence of}} such feature-specific task sets, and to compare it to selection that is guided by advance knowledge about target features. Visual search arrays contained two different color singleton digits, and participants had to select one of these as target and report its parity. Target color was either known in <b>advance</b> (<b>fixed</b> color task) or had to be selected anew on each trial (free color-choice task). ERP correlates of spatially selective attentional target selection (N 2 pc) and working memory processing (SPCN) demonstrated rapid target selection and efficient exclusion of color singleton distractors from focal attention and working memory in the fixed color task. In the free color-choice task, spatially selective processing also emerged rapidly, but selection efficiency was reduced, with nontarget singleton digits capturing attention and gaining access to working memory. Results demonstrate the benefits of top-down task sets: Feature-specific advance preparation accelerates target selection, rapidly resolves attentional competition, and prevents irrelevant events from attracting attention and entering working memory...|$|R

50|$|The DS-Xtreme {{flash card}} is a one-card {{solution}} with 4 Gib (512 MiB)—or a newer 16 Gib model (2 GiB)—of internal flash memory, with no option to add external memory. The DS-Xtreme hardware supports generic USB mass-storage specifications, {{functioning as a}} drag and drop USB drive with no additional drivers needed. It has two color-adjustable LEDs. After connecting the DS-Xtreme to a PC via the included USB cable, files may {{be transferred to the}} DS-Xtreme memory and immediately used on the DS. The DS-Xtreme is not fully compatible; many games which will load will have errors in a number of areas, particularly download play and Nintendo Wi-Fi connection. These problems were corrected by installing the newest version of the firmware (as with any flashcart); however, support has been discontinue and many games require patching (or other <b>advanced</b> <b>fixes)</b> to operate. It is highly homebrew-compatible, and does not require extra fixes (due to the auto-patching software included). As of 2009, the price of the 16 Gib models has dropped to around $50; however, its developers abandoned the project in 2007. DS-Scene.net gave the 4 GiB DS-Xtreme a rating of 91 percent in its review.|$|R
