5|$|Christian Analytic philosopher Alvin Plantinga criticized Malcolm's and Hartshorne's arguments, {{and offered}} an alternative. He argued that, if Malcolm does prove the {{necessary}} {{existence of the}} greatest possible being, it follows that there is <b>a</b> <b>being</b> which exists in all worlds whose greatness in some worlds is not surpassed. It does not, he argued, demonstrate that such <b>a</b> <b>being</b> has unsurpassed greatness in this world.|$|E
5|$|In his {{development}} of the ontological argument, Leibniz attempted to demonstrate the coherence of a supremely perfect being. C. D. Broad countered that if two characteristics necessary for God's perfection are incompatible with a third, {{the notion of a}} supremely perfect being becomes incoherent. The ontological argument assumes the definition of God purported by classical theism: that God is omnipotent, omniscient, and morally perfect. Kenneth Einar Himma claimed that omniscience and omnipotence may be incompatible: if God is omnipotent, then {{he should be able to}} create <b>a</b> <b>being</b> with free will; if he is omniscient, then he should know exactly what such <b>a</b> <b>being</b> will do (which may technically render them without free will). This analysis would render the ontological argument incoherent, as the characteristics required of a maximally great being cannot coexist in one being, thus such <b>a</b> <b>being</b> could not exist.|$|E

5|$|A vampire is <b>a</b> <b>being</b> from {{folklore}} that subsists {{by feeding}} {{on the life}} essence (generally {{in the form of}} blood) of the living. In European folklore, vampires were undead beings that often visited loved ones and caused mischief or deaths in the neighbourhoods they inhabited when they were alive. They wore shrouds and were often described as bloated and of ruddy or dark countenance, markedly different from today's gaunt, pale vampire which dates from the early 19th century.|$|E
5|$|Between battles, {{characters}} can {{be managed}} at a Base. In this location, skills can be assigned, weapons can be traded, purchased, and forged, and bonus experience points earned in battle can be given to characters. There is also a Support system accessible through the Base where player characters can talk {{with each other and}} improve their relationships. These conversations improve affinity between characters and grant stat boots in battle. Supports are ranked from C to A, with <b>A</b> <b>being</b> the highest rank and granting the best bonuses.|$|E

5|$|Married people, however, {{are advised}} not to worship Dhumavati. It {{is said that}} her worship creates a feeling of wanting {{solitude}} and distaste of worldly things, which is considered as highest characteristics of a spiritual quest. Thus, Dhumavati's worship is appropriate for world renouncers who roam as lone wanderers and widows who parallel the life of world renouncers. Dhumavati is also described <b>a</b> <b>being</b> partial to single persons and especially partial to widows. Widows are considered the only beings who can withstand her power.|$|E
25|$|Essence is {{a measure}} of <b>a</b> living <b>being's</b> lifeforce. All humans and metahumans start with a value of six (although critters may start with a higher or lower Essence). It powers magic, and as essence fades, so does magical aptitude. Cyberware, bioware, nanotech implants, extreme cases of {{substance}} addiction, and other major changes to <b>a</b> <b>being's</b> body can damage its essence as well. Generally, if <b>a</b> <b>being's</b> essence ever reaches zero, it dies. Cybermancy allows metahumans to survive with an essence rating of zero or less.|$|R

5|$|Scholarly {{theories}} {{have been proposed}} about Hel's potential connections to figures appearing in the 11th century Old English Gospel of Nicodemus and Old Norse Bartholomeus saga postola, {{that she may have}} been considered a goddess with potential Indo-European parallels in Bhavani, Kali, and Mahakali or that Hel may have become <b>a</b> <b>being</b> only as a late personification of the location of the same name.|$|E
5|$|The frailty of the {{argument}} is that it implies that God, <b>a</b> <b>being</b> which does not suffer from transworld depravity by the assumption of omnibenevolence, is unable to recreate a transworld-depravity-free being, which is seemingly contradictory to the assumption of omnipotence.|$|E

5|$|The myth's {{religious}} importance {{extended beyond}} the funerary sphere. Mortuary offerings, in which {{family members or}} hired priests presented food to the deceased, were logically linked with the mythological offering of the Eye of Horus to Osiris. By analogy, this episode of the myth was eventually equated with other interactions between a human and <b>a</b> <b>being</b> in the divine realm. In temple offering rituals, the officiating priest took {{on the role of}} Horus, the gifts to the deity became the Eye of Horus, and whichever deity received these gifts was momentarily equated with Osiris.|$|E
5|$|Theoretically, {{all life}} forms {{are said to}} deserve full {{protection}} {{from all kinds of}} injury, but Jains recognise a hierarchy of life. Mobile beings are given higher protection than immobile ones. For the mobile beings, they distinguish between one-sensed, two-sensed, three-sensed, four-sensed and five-sensed ones; a one-sensed animal has touch as its only sensory modality. The more senses <b>a</b> <b>being</b> has, the more they care about non-injuring it. Among the five-sensed beings, the precept of non-injury and non-violence to the rational ones (humans) is strongest in Jain Ahimsa.|$|E
5|$|This {{contains}} {{the notion of}} <b>a</b> <b>being</b> that cannot be conceived not to exist. He argued that if something can be conceived not to exist, then something greater can be conceived. Consequently, a thing than which nothing greater can be conceived cannot be conceived not to exist and so it must exist. This {{can be read as}} a restatement of the argument in Chapter 2, although Norman Malcolm believed it to be a different, stronger argument.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: "Who {{or what is}} God?, " asks John Hick. A theist might answer: God is an {{infinite}} person, or at least <b>an</b> infinite personal <b>being.</b> Hick disagrees: "God cannot be both a person and infinite. " Moreover, he says, the distinction between <b>being</b> <b>a</b> person and <b>being</b> <b>a</b> personal <b>being</b> "is <b>a</b> distinction without a difference. " Thus, God cannot be <b>an</b> infinite personal <b>being</b> either. In this essay, I assess Hick's reasons for drawing these conclusions...|$|R
