40|$|This article {{examines}} discernable patterns of real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth co-movements across 29 countries, using consistent time series data (1912 - 2008). Of these countries, only 12 {{are found to}} form three statistically significant groupings (i. e. G 6 -six Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) European countries, G 4 -four Anglo-Saxon countries, and G 2 -two major Asian countries). One may then conclude that, inter alia, geographical proximity, cultural ties, {{and the level of}} socio-economic and financial ties among countries determine the global systematic co-movements of growth rates. Our results indicate that any recession in the US initially engulfs other Anglo-Saxon countries as well as G 6 and G 2 countries, before exerting its <b>adverse</b> <b>knock-on</b> <b>effects</b> {{to the rest of the}} world. A Multivariate Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity (MGARCH) model is also used to examine the transmission of GDP growth across these three groups and their corresponding volatility spillovers. We find significant bi-directional cross-mean spillovers between the G 4 and G 6 blocs. In terms of cross-volatility spillovers, the estimated persistence varies from a maximum 0. 959 (G 4 -G 6) to a minimum of 0. 832 (G 2 -G 4) ...|$|R
40|$|Using factor {{analysis}} this paper examines discernable patterns of real GDP growth co-movements across 97 countries, using consistent time series {{data for the}} period 1961 - 2008. Of these countries only 21 are found to form three statistically significant groupings, where membership count exceeds more than two. Ten major OECD European countries plus Japan and Hong Kong form the first well-defined common bloc of countries (G 12). The second bloc, consisting of six major Asian countries (G 6), have GDP growth rates that exhibit a very high degree of correlation, based on their robust factor loadings. The last group of counties collectively witnessed a very substantial degree of cross-country growth co-movements constituted four (G 4) Anglo-Saxon countries. We conclude that, inter alia, geographical proximity, cultural ties {{and the level of}} socio-economic and financial ties among countries determine the global systematic co-movements of growth rates. This paper also identifies {{the extent to which the}} GDP growth rates in the remaining 76 countries are intertwined with that of the above three groups of countries. We conclude that the recent US recession is expected to initially engulf other Anglo-Saxon countries as well as G 12 and G 6 countries, before exerting its <b>adverse</b> <b>knock-on</b> <b>effects</b> to the rest of the world...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: A {{growing number}} of studies are {{focusing}} attention on the new bank resolution framework and, particularly, on its side effects. This paper intends {{to contribute to the}} limited literature by examining the first application of the BRRD in Italy, in 2015, to four small to medium-sized failing banks. It assesses empirically the (in) stability of bank creditors and depositors in stress situations. It analyses a unique proprietary database of the Italian Deposit Guarantee Scheme. It finds that the resolved banks incurred a significant loss of total funding since the start of their Special Administration procedure. When resolution is impending, creditors and depositors take flight dramatically. The run-off is stronger for uninsured deposits than for insured deposits. It also reveals that the deposits of some banks that are solvent but which send public signals of weakness (capital shortfall) seem to become “infected” and behave in a similar fashion. The results would seem to confirm that market discipline in fact does work. However, they also support the argument that resolution works best when the crisis is not systemic. In the presence of a systemic crisis the funding outflows can reasonably reach large proportions. They can weaken market confidence and affect other bank creditors with all the <b>adverse</b> <b>knock-on</b> <b>effects</b> on financial stability. If the bail-in logic can be counterproductive in those very situations for which it was conceived, it could imply that the risk of having to resort to bail-out is still very high...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the last}} several years a number of {{independent}} empirical studies have shown that organizational performance is related to a portfolio of management techniques, clearly demonstrating that there is no single "silver bullet. " In fact, these studies indicate that performance is positively correlated with the number of techniques employed and the depth of their implementation. Operational outcomes in areas like product quality, on-time delivery and productivity, as well as market measures like margins and export sales are both positively related to the implementation of a variety of techniques. This paper explores the relationship between the use of effective inventory management practices (as reflected in inventory turnover) and the implementation of other manufacturing practices. The hypothesis is that effective inventory management practices have a positive <b>knock-on</b> <b>effect</b> on the implementation of other practices. Since organizational performance is related to the implementation of multiple practices, the <b>knock-on</b> <b>effect</b> should {{have a positive effect on}} performance as well. The results show that inventory turnover is significantly related to the implementation of other techniques and weakly related to an index of overall company performance. This suggests a positive <b>knock-on</b> <b>effect,</b> but that it takes more than inventory management to achieve high levels of performance. Having established the knock-on relationship adds more evidence to the notion that management excellence in one area begets management excellence in others. (C) 2004 Elsevier B. V.
