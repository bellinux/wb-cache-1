25|$|Meanwhile, {{breakthroughs}} in molecular, cell, evolutionary, and developmental biology generated <b>a</b> <b>cornucopia</b> <b>of</b> data-based theory relevant to cognition. Categorical assignments were problematic. For example, {{the decision to}} append cognitive to a body of biological research on neurons, e.g. the cognitive biology of neuroscience, is separate from the decision to put such body of research in a category named cognitive sciences. No less difficult a decision needs be made—between the computational and constructivist approach to cognition, and the concomitant issue of simulated v. embodied cognitive models—before appending biology to a body of cognitive research, e.g. the cognitive science of artificial life.|$|E

25|$|Some {{versions}} of the flag also feature the coat of arms on the left hand side, over {{the intersection of the}} three stripes. The coat of arms was approved in the 1970s by the Municipal Assembly. It features a red band crossing the shield diagonally, from left to right. Over the red band lies a golden citrus, which is believed {{to be one of the}} reasons for the town's name, and <b>a</b> <b>cornucopia</b> <b>of</b> fruits, which alludes to Cidra's role as one of the major producers of fruits of the island. The upper field is either white or silver, and features two symbols: a black scapular representing the Virgin, and a black bishop hat referencing San Juan Nepomuceno, bishop and martyr. The lower field is mostly blue and features a brown pigeon flying over a mountain range, representing the location of the town in the Central Mountain Range, and a set of silver water waves. The whole seal is capped by a three-tower crown, which is usually seen in municipal seals in the island.|$|E

It's a representation of how television, like any art form, can have multiple meanings, which evolve over time." [...] However, the reviewer knew that Apollo {{was not going to be}} a fraud given the cast members' support of the organization. The reviewer also praised Hansen's reaction to his father's return.

2500|$|After the {{establishment}} of Communist Chinese People's Republic of China, [...] "(...) the People's Liberation Army (PLA) invaded the country in 1950. In March 1959, an uprising centered on the capital, Lhasa, prompted a massive crackdown, during which the Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso (b. 1935), fled into exile." [...] Such markets and consumerism {{came to an abrupt}} end after the arrival of Chinese government troops and administrative cadres in 1950. [...] Food rations and poorly stocked government stores replaced the old markets, until the 1990s when commerce in international wares once more returned to Lhasa, and arcades and malls with <b>a</b> <b>cornucopia</b> <b>of</b> goods sprang up.|$|E
2500|$|Michael Fitzgerald, a {{professor}} of child and adolescent psychiatry, published <b>a</b> <b>cornucopia</b> <b>of</b> pathographies of outstanding historical personalities, mostly disclosing that they had Asperger syndrome, {{which is on the}} autism spectrum. In his 2004 published anthology Autism and creativity, he classified Hitler as an [...] "autistic psychopath". Autistic psychopathy is a term that the Austrian physician Hans Asperger had coined in 1944 in order to label the clinical picture that was later named after him: Asperger syndrome, which {{has nothing to do with}} psychopathy in the sense of an antisocial personality disorder. Fitzgerald appraised many of Hitler’s publicly known traits as autistic, particularly his various obsessions, his lifeless gaze, his social awkwardness, his lack of personal friendships, and his tendency toward monologue-like speeches, which, according to Fitzgerald, resulted from an inability to have real conversations.|$|E
2500|$|One {{good example}} of {{his work as a}} flower painter is his Offering to Flora, a visual poem that {{parallels}} the lyric verse of his time, in which he united his skills as portraitist and flower painter to produce {{one of the most beautiful}} paintings of the allegory of spring. The large canvas, painted in 1627, shows the goddess of the flowers seated besides <b>a</b> <b>cornucopia</b> <b>of</b> spring flowers. The painting adopts a Flemish compositional; type and reveals an interest in the play of light on iridescent fabrics that probably derived in the style of [...] Juan Bautista Maino. The offering to Flora and the pair of paintings: the still life with Flowers and a Dog, and Still-Life with a Puppy, formed part of the interior decoration of Jean de Croy's palace in Madrid. Jean de Croy, conde de Solre and Diego Mexia, marqués de Leganés, were Van der Hamen's greatest patrons.|$|E
