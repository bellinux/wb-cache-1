500|$|Peng made regular {{inspection}} {{tours of}} the Chinese provinces after becoming Defense Minister in 1953. In a tour on Guangzhou in April 1958, he openly criticized Mao, saying [...] "The Chairman talks <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>about</b> more, faster, better, and more economical results. That is annoying. What does he want with chanting these liturgies all the time?" [...] On an inspection tour through Gansu in October 1958, Peng observed {{many of the problems}} associated with the Great Leap Forward. Mature crops were left to die in the field because all of the young men had been drafted to operate primitive backyard furnaces. When Peng asked an old peasant why no one was collecting the harvest, he received the answer: [...] "unless the centre sends down a great comrade, one cannot stand up against this storm." [...] On the same tour Peng heard complaints that household utensils were being melted down for [...] "steel", and that houses and orchards were cut and torn down in order to provide fuel for the backyard furnaces. In a subsequent tour through his native province of Hunan, later in 1958, Peng observed the same problems associated everywhere with the Great Leap Forward: serious food shortages; hungry children and babies; elders who expressed bitterness and anger; and arrogant, boasting Party cadres who administered local economic reforms. During his inspection tours through China in the fall of 1958, Peng composed a poem that summarized his attitude towards the Great Leap Forward: ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{had just}} made my {{eleventh}} attempt {{to get out of}} that ravine," [...] the girl went on, [...] "with George talking <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>about</b> the recent excavations in Egypt, when suddenly--you know what it is when something seems to snap----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They {{make me feel}} as if I {{were part}} of {{something}} heavy sitting on something else, and <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> talking <b>about</b> how to make things lighter for the thing it's sitting on." ...|$|R
5000|$|... {{the share}} of IIT in total {{international}} trade is growing <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> at <b>about</b> 4-5% a year. Thus, more and more, countries are importing {{the same kinds of}} products they are also exporting.|$|R
60|$|She {{walked for}} {{a mile or}} more recklessly, close veiled, with swift level footsteps, though her brain was in a whirl and a horrible faintness <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> hovered <b>about</b> her. Then she called a hansom and drove home.|$|R
60|$|Dominey seemed {{suddenly}} to become {{possessed of a}} strange desire to thrust the whole subject away. He dismissed the old man kindly but a little abruptly, accompanying him to the corridor {{which led to the}} servants' quarters and talking <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>about</b> the pheasants. When he returned, he found that his guest had emptied his second glass of brandy and was surreptitiously mopping his forehead.|$|E
6000|$|... "Very disagreeable if our {{marriage}} {{is to be}} put off by it. I {{think it will be}} so much nicer making love somewhere on the Rhine than having snatches of it here, and talking <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>about</b> wills and tenements and settlements." [...] As he said this, with his arm round her waist and his face quite close to hers,--shewing thereby that he was not altogether averse even to his present privileges,--she forgave him.|$|E
6000|$|... 'It is, it is!' Selah answered, vehemently. 'I {{wish you}} could only see the way father goes on at me <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>about</b> chapel, and so on, Mr. Wal--Herbert, I mean. You wouldn't wonder, {{if you were to}} hear him, at my being anxious for the time to come when you can leave Oxford and we can get comfortably married. What between the {{drudgery}} of the shop and the drudgery of the chapel my life's positively getting almost worn out of me.' ...|$|E
60|$|The little dancing girl obeyed his invitation. She sat by Estermen's side, but {{she cast}} a longing glance at Falkenberg. Their glasses were filled. Estermen drank quickly, <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> looking <b>about</b> {{him with the}} furtive air of a whipped dog.|$|R
60|$|She turned away. Her {{lips were}} moving <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time.</b> She walked <b>about</b> a dozen steps, {{and then she}} returned.|$|R

Her infomercial [...] "Making Love Work" [...] won an award as Best Infomercial of 1994.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Sabin {{motioned to}} his coachman, and they crossed Broadway. His {{companion}} {{led him into}} a tall building, talking noisily <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>about</b> the pals whom he had just left. An elevator transported them to the twelfth floor {{in little more than}} as many seconds, and Mr. Skinner ushered his visitor into a somewhat bare-looking office, smelling strongly of stale tobacco smoke. Mr. Skinner at once lit a cigar, and seating himself before his desk, folded his arms and leaned over towards Mr. Sabin.|$|E
6000|$|The lads came gayly {{back and}} went at their sports {{again with a}} will, {{chattering}} <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>about</b> Tom's stupendous plan and admiring the genius of it. After a dainty egg and fish dinner, Tom {{said he wanted to}} learn to smoke, now. Joe caught at the idea and {{said he would like to}} try, too. So Huck made pipes and filled them. These novices had never smoked anything before but cigars made of grape-vine, and they [...] "bit" [...] the tongue, and were not considered manly anyway.|$|E
6000|$|... “Some kind of sickness,” {{says the}} captain. “It appears {{it took him}} sudden. Seems he {{got up in the}} night, and filled up on Pain-Killer and Kennedy’s Discovery. No go: he was booked beyond Kennedy. Then he had tried to open a case of gin. No go again: not strong enough. Then he must have turned to and run out on the verandah, and capsized over the rail. When they found him, the next day, he was clean crazy—carried on <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>about</b> {{somebody}} watering his copra. Poor John!” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You are mistaken there," [...] he said. [...] "I {{came here}} {{to find out what}} sort of a girl you are; my counsels must depend on my discoveries. But there is one thing I want to ask you; you are <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> talking <b>about</b> three young men. Now, there are four of them here." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I suppose {{our story}} would sound pretty fair {{if it was}} put into a book; but whoever wrote it couldn't be <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> telling <b>about</b> how hungry and tired we were, how the {{mosquitoes}} and flies nearly ate us up, how thoroughly we were frightened the greater portion of <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> nor how disagreeable {{it is to be}} where there's precious little chance for a fellow to keep clean." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes. There is a {{mortgage}} {{on it and}} we're to be sold out very soon--so the lawyers told us. Mother has {{tried so hard to}} make the farm pay but she couldn't. I could if I was bigger--I know I could. If they would only wait a few years! But there is no use hoping for that. Mother cries <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>about</b> it. She has lived at the Cove farm for over thirty years and she says she can't live away from it now. Elsie--that's my sister--and I do all we can to cheer her up, but we can't do much. Oh, if I was only a man!" ...|$|E
60|$|The {{singing in}} the drawing-room that evening, far {{superior}} as it was, with Henrietta, Beatrice, Frederick, and even Aunt Mary's beautiful voice, was not equal in enjoyment to that. Was it because Beatrice was teasing Fred <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>about</b> his defection? The church singers {{came up to the}} Hall, and the drawing-room door was set open for the party to listen to them; grandpapa and Uncle Geoffrey went out to have a talk with them, and so passed the space till tea-time; {{to say nothing of the}} many little troops of young small voices outside the windows, to whom Mrs. Langford's plum buns, and Mr. Geoffrey's sixpences, were a very enjoyable part of the Christmas festivities.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't be hard {{upon the}} gentleman, sir," [...] said {{the person in}} {{attendance}} on the works of art, with {{a twinkle in his}} eye as he looked at me; [...] "he may chance to be an artist himself. If so, sir, he will have a fellow-feeling with me, sir, when I"--he adapted his action to his words as he went on, and gave a smart slap of his hands between each touch, working himself <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>about</b> and about the composition--"when I lighten the bloom of my grapes--shade off the orange in my rainbow--dot the i of my Britons--throw a yellow light into my cow-cum-ber--insinuate another morsel of fat into my shoulder of mutton--dart another zigzag flash of lightning at my ship in distress!" ...|$|E
60|$|Francis {{did as he}} was bidden. The {{girl was}} a {{well-known}} member of the chorus of one of the principal musical comedies, and she seemed to be thoroughly enjoying both the dance and her partner. The latter appeared to be of a somewhat ordinary type, sallow, with rather puffy cheeks, and eyes almost unnaturally dark. He danced vigorously and he talked <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time.</b> Something <b>about</b> him was vaguely familiar to Francis, but he failed to place him.|$|R
50|$|The song {{is a love}} duet, {{with the}} singers expressing their heartache at {{not being able to}} be with each other <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time.</b> Ilus sings <b>about</b> giving Linna a necklace, from which he is able to hear her voice even if she is away.|$|R
60|$|During <b>the</b> next weeks, <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> {{she went}} <b>about</b> {{in the same}} dark richness, her eyes dilated and shining like {{the eyes of a}} wild animal, a curious half-smile which seemed to be gibing at the civic pretence of <b>all</b> <b>the</b> human life about her.|$|R
60|$|Rollo ought, now, when {{he found}} {{that he must be}} {{disappointed}} about his ride, to have immediately banished it from his mind altogether, and turned his thoughts to other pleasures; but like all ill-humored people, he would keep thinking and talking, <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> <b>about</b> the thing which caused his ill-humor. So he sat in a large back entry, where he and Lucy were, looking out at the door, and saying a great many ill-natured things about the weather, and his father's giving up the ride just for a little sprinkling of rain that would not last half an hour. He said it was a shame, too, for it to rain that day, just because he was going to ride.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Thornbury {{went with}} them to the gate, {{trailing}} very slowly and gracefully across the grass and the gravel, and talking <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>about</b> flowers and birds. She told them that she had taken up the study of botany since her daughter married, and it was wonderful what a number of flowers there were which she had never seen, although she had lived in the country all her life and she was now seventy-two. It was a good thing to have some occupation which was quite independent of other people, she said, when one got old. But the odd thing was that one never felt old. She always felt that she was twenty-five, not a day more or a day less, but, of course, one couldn't expect other people to agree to that.|$|E
60|$|During {{all this}} time the people of England were patiently waiting for Richard's return, and {{wondering}} {{what had become of}} him. They knew that he had sailed from Palestine in October, and various were the conjectures as to his fate. Some thought that he had been shipwrecked; others, that he had fallen {{into the hands of the}} Moors; but all was uncertainty, for no tidings had been heard of him since he sailed from Acre. Berengaria had arrived safely at Messina, and after remaining there a little time she proceeded on her journey, under the care of Stephen, as far as Rome, very anxious <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>about</b> her husband. Here she stopped, not daring to go any farther. She felt safe in Rome, under the protection of the Pope.|$|E
5000|$|I don't {{know whether}} you've {{been on a}} {{motorcycle}} (if your parents don't know, please do not nod now), but I must say this: if I didn't have wings, and if motorcycles weren't, essentially, extremely cool death traps, I would want to ride on one <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time.</b> It's <b>about</b> <b>the</b> closest thing to flying there is. The wind whipping through your hair, the sense of freedom, the bugs slamming into your face -- it's flying, but on the ground, burning gasoline and {{making a lot of}} noise. What's not to love? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "When the {{men came}} up the little one was perhaps rested, for {{it was able to}} turn round with its dam, no matter how quick she moved, so as to keep always in front of her belly. The five dogs were <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> frisking <b>about</b> her actively, tormenting her like so many gad-flies. Indeed they made it {{difficult}} to take an aim at her without killing them. But Hans, lying on his elbow, took a quiet aim, and shot her through the head. She dropped and rolled over dead, without moving a muscle.|$|R
5000|$|The Goode family {{struggles with}} the modern social and {{environmental}} responsibilities of being liberals, and the paradoxes that arise for a working-class family when trying to be politically correct <b>all</b> of <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>about</b> everything. Situations in the first episode included shopping at a natural foods store without having brought reusable bags, how to refer to ethnic groups, analyzing conservative beliefs they typically despise, and raising modern teenagers. The pilot satirized both stereotypical [...] "liberal" [...] and [...] "conservative" [...] mindsets, including the ongoing derangement of the family's [...] "vegan" [...] dog (who has taken to eating neighborhood pets).|$|R
6000|$|... "No, ma'am. The squire {{was hard}} for a bit. Master Herbert's {{marriage}} was a sad disappointment to him. He had {{made up his mind}} {{he was going to do}} so well, and to cut such a figure in the world; but he would have come round. Lord bless you, he only meant to hold out for a bit. When he was ill at Athens, he was talking <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>about</b> forgiving his son, and I could see how hard it had been to him to keep separated from him. On the voyage home he fidgeted ever so at the delay, and I knew that the first thing he did, when he got back, would be to write to Master Herbert and tell him to bring his wife down to the Hall. There's not a hard corner in the squire's heart.|$|E
6000|$|It was half-way {{through the}} morning, {{and he had}} not breakfasted; the slight litter of other breakfasts stood about {{on the table to}} remind him of his hunger; and adding a poached egg to his order, he {{proceeded}} musingly to shake some white sugar into his coffee, thinking <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>about</b> Flambeau. He remembered how Flambeau had escaped, once by a pair of nail scissors, and once by a house on fire; once by having to pay for an unstamped letter, and once by getting people to look through a telescope at a comet that might destroy the world. He thought his detective brain as good as the criminal's, which was true. But he fully realised the disadvantage. [...] "The criminal is the creative artist; the detective only the critic," [...] he said with a sour smile, and lifted his coffee cup to his lips slowly, and put it down very quickly. He had put salt in it.|$|E
60|$|My {{companion}} explained {{quite frankly}} to the doorkeeper {{that it did}} not matter what he said, {{she was not going to}} take any notice of him. He did not look a talkative man at any time, and, maybe, this announcement further discouraged him. In any case, he made no attempt to answer. All he did was to stand in the centre of the doorway with a far-away look in his eyes. The doorway was some four feet wide: he was about three feet six across, and weighed about twenty stone. As I explained, I was busy buying a programme, and when I returned my friend had her hat in her hand, and was digging pins into it: I think she was trying to make believe it was the heart of the doorkeeper. She did not want to listen to the opera, she wanted to talk <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>about</b> that doorkeeper, but the people round us would not even let her do that.|$|E
