50|$|After {{the breakup}} of the USSR, the problem of {{homelessness}} sharpened dramatically, partially because of the legal vacuum of the early 1990s with some laws contradicting each other and partially because of a high rate of frauds in the realty market. In 1991 articles 198 and 209 of Russian criminal code which instituted a criminal penalty for not having permanent residence were abolished. Because most flats had been privatized and many people sold their last shelter without successfully buying another, there was a sharp increase of homeless. Renting apartments from a private owner became widespread (which usually only gives temporary registration and the <b>apartment</b> <b>owner</b> could evict the lessee after the contract is over, or if the rent was unpaid). In Moscow, the first overnight shelter for homeless was opened in 1992. In the late 1990s certain amendments in law were implemented to reduce the rise in homelessness, such as the prohibition of selling last flat with registered children.|$|E
