5|$|Allocations {{will be made}} to firms who {{undertake}} {{activities that}} are deemed to be both 'trade-exposed' and 'emissions-intensive'. Moderately emissions intensive <b>activities</b> <b>will</b> receive allocations equal to 60% of the industry average for the financial years ending 2007, 2008 and 2009. Highly emissions intensive industries will receive allocations equal to 90% of the industry average for this period. Allocation per unit of output will decrease by 1.3% per year from 2013 (on an exponential basis rather than a summation basis).|$|E
5|$|During the {{transition}} period participants in energy, fossil fuels and industry will only need to surrender one NZU for two tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions. Free allocation of units to energy-intensive and trade-exposed <b>activities</b> <b>will</b> also be halved. Secondly, participants may pay a fixed price of NZ$25 instead of buying and surrendering units. This measure means that firms will face a cost of no higher than NZ$12.50 per tonne of emissions. There is a restriction {{on the sale of}} units oversea during this transition period, except for forest removal credits.|$|E

5|$|L.A. Noire is a neo-noir detective action-adventure {{video game}} {{developed}} by Team Bondi {{and published by}} Rockstar Games. It was released on 17 May 2011 for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, and on 8 November 2011 for Microsoft Windows; a re-release for Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One is scheduled for 14 November 2017. L.A. Noire is set in Los Angeles in 1947 and challenges the player, controlling a Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) officer, to solve a range of cases across five divisions. Players must investigate crime scenes for clues, follow up leads, and interrogate suspects, and the player's success at these <b>activities</b> <b>will</b> impact how much of each case's story is revealed.|$|E
5|$|Carre's and St. George's Academy {{operate the}} Sleaford Joint Sixth Form, which shares a common {{timetable}} {{between the two}} sites and allows for students to choose {{from a wide range}} of options at A-Level. Students may choose to apply to be based at either school, where their pastoral and tutorial <b>activities</b> <b>will</b> take place. The Sixth Form, including Carre's, is co-educational. The majority of students take four A-levels subjects in year 12, with most choosing to focus on three in year 13. The Joint Sixth Form allows students to choose from a range of 65 optional vocational or academic subjects including: art and photography (separate A-Level or BTEC options), applied Science, biology, bricklaying, business (A-Level or BTEC), childcare, carpentry, chemistry, computing or ICT (A-Level or BTEC), drama or performing arts (A-Level or BTEC), electronics, engineering, English (language and/or literature), film or media studies, French, German, geography, government and politics, health and social care, history, hospitality and catering, law, mathematics and further mathematics, music (A-Level or BTEC), philosophy and ethics, psychology, physical education or sport (A-Level or BTEC), physics, product Design, public Services, light vehicle maintenance, Spanish, sociology, travel and tourism, and work skills. In addition, students may participate in General Studies at A-Level, and a range of extra-curricular activities, including the Duke of Edinburgh Award scheme.|$|E

25|$|Another common tool {{of program}} design {{that can be}} {{employed}} is the logic model. Logic models are a graphical depiction of the logical relationships between the resources, activities, outputs and outcomes of a program.

25|$|Because dogs often bark {{excessively}} due to stress, boredom, or frustration, changing {{aspects of}} an animal's environment {{to make them}} more content is a suitable way to quiet them down, rather than forcibly silencing a distressed animal. Spending more time with an animal, such as playing, walking, and other bonding <b>activities,</b> <b>will</b> keep them occupied and make them feel more at ease. If the animal is stressed, it is best to remove the object that is causing them discomfort.|$|E

In the preparatory stage, the members of the Work Subgroups may request the participation of representatives from the private sector of each member state.

25|$|The Bill {{provides}} us with a framework to establish objectives with a biophysical bottom line that must not be compromised. Provided that those objectives are met, what people get up to is their affair. As such, the Bill provides a more liberal regime for developers. On the other hand, <b>activities</b> <b>will</b> have to be compatible with hard environmental standards and society will set those standards. Clause 4 sets out the biophysical bottom line. Clauses 5 and 6 set out further specific matters that expand on the issues. The Bill has a clear and rigorous procedure for the setting of environmental standards – and the debate will be concentrating on just where we set those standards.|$|E
25|$|Deterrence: Theories of {{deterrence}} claim that by sentencing criminals to extremely harsh penalties, {{other people who}} might be considering criminal <b>activities</b> <b>will</b> be so terrified of the consequences that they will choose not to commit crimes out of fear. In reality, most studies show that high incarceration rates either increase crime, have no noticeable effect, or only decrease it by a very small amount. Prisons act as training grounds for criminal activity, form criminal social networks, expose prisoners to further abuse (both from staff and other prisoners), foster anti-social sentiments towards society (law enforcement and corrections personnel in particular), fragment communities, and leave prisoners with criminal records that make it difficult to find legal employment after release. All of these things can result in a higher likelihood of reoffending upon release.|$|E

25|$|PERT and CPM {{are very}} similar in their {{approach}} but still present some differences.

PERT, on the other hand, allows for stochastic activity times; the times at which each <b>activity</b> <b>will</b> be carried out are uncertain or varied. Because of this core difference, CPM and PERT are used in different contexts. These mathematical techniques quickly spread into many private enterprises.|$|R
