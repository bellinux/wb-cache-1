Aaron had {{to be brought to}} the hospital for surgery. He was hospitalized for well over three weeks. For four months the other three members of Fahrenheit had to attend overseas album promotions and functions without Aaron. The Taiwanese media then composed rumors saying that Aaron was a disadvantage to the group and that he was dragging the group behind, which would cause disbandment. More rumors surfaced saying that HIM was planning to dispose of Aaron so Fahrenheit could become a group of three instead of four, therefore complementing more with the prefabricated trio S.H.E. However, Fahrenheit stepped out and confirmed that Aaron is still in the group despite his inconvenient condition. To prevent more rumors from happening, as soon as Aaron was available he appeared more often in the future promotions with the other members, clearly seen using crutches.|$|R
