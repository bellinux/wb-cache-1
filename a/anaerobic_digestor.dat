Accordingly, from 1981 to 1984 under WRC sponsorship, the Johannesburg City Council (JCC) undertook a pilot plant study into the performance of the autothermal thermophilic aerobic reactor oxygenated with pure oxygen. As a consequence of the encouraging results obtained in this study (Trim and McGlashan, 1984; Trim, 1984), in 1987 the WRC and Milnerton Municipality supported a frill scale evaluation of dual digestion (45 ma pure oxygen oxygenated aerobic reactor and 600 ma <b>anaerobic</b> <b>digestor)</b> at Milnerton's Potsdam Wastewater Treatment Works, with scientific and academic input by the Division of Water Technology of the CSIR and the Department of Civil Engineering, of UCT.

In the perspective of developing a biotechnological process for the degradation of low-molecular weight (MW) aromatic compounds occurring in the effluents of <b>anaerobic</b> <b>digestors</b> treating OMWs, the capability of this bacterial co-culture of biodegrading a synthetic mix of the above mentioned compounds and the aromatic compounds of an anaerobic OMW-treatment plant effluent in the physiological state of immobilised cells was investigated. Two aerobic fixed-bed biofilm reactors were developed by immobilising the co-culture cells on Manville silica beads and on polyurethane foam cubes. Both supports were found to give rise to a microbiologically stable and biologically active biofilm. The two biofilm reactors were found to be similarly capable of rapidly and completely biodegrading the components of a synthetic mix of nine monocyclic aromatic acids typically present in OMWs and the low-MW aromatic compounds occurring in the anaerobic effluent in batch conditions. However, in the same conditions, the silica bead-packed reactor was found to be more effective in the removal of high-MW phenolic compounds from the anaerobic effluent with respect to the polyurethane cube-packed reactor.

In the first batch the solid fraction (SF) of a previous reactor is recycled in the new system, in the second only the liquid fraction (LF) is recycled while in the third none was used and the system was started only with water (W). Results show that the use of the LF is a better choice in terms of volumetric methane production, whereas using SF is more useful to improve the kinetics of the process and the VS degradation.

Thermophilic (50 degrees C) and mesophilic (35 degrees C) <b>anaerobic</b> <b>digestors,</b> with poultry manure as the substrate, were inoculated with the oocysts. The oocysts were damaged during anaerobic digestion, as determined by morphological change and loss {{of their ability to}} sporulate. The recovered oocysts were tested for their infectivity in young chicks, as measured by body weight gain, mortality, and cecal lesions. Oocysts lost all their infectivity during thermophilic digestion, while oocysts subjected to mesophilic digestion remained moderately infective in comparison with untreated oocysts, which produced severe coccidiosis, high mortality, and low body weight gain in chicks. Oocysts were inactivated at 50 degrees C when they were suspended in digestor fluid or saline. Inactivation at 35 degrees C was significantly stronger in the digestor fluid than in the saline, which implied that factors other than temperature were involved in the lethal effect of anaerobic digestion on protozoan oocysts.

30|$|The {{terrestrial}} {{system is}} known for the plentiful production of cellulose biopolymers. The occurrence of cellulose in decaying microorganisms takes place in sundry environments (soil, aquatic, compost, <b>anaerobic</b> <b>digestors</b> and also the carbon cycle) (Leschine 1995). Several microorganisms (bacteria and fungi) {{were reported to have}} cellulose-degrading activity, and such cellulose degrading microbes exist in nature with non-cellulolytic microorganisms. Biodegradation of cellulose proceeds under aerobic (form CO 2 and H 2 O) as well as anaerobic (form CO 2, CH 4 and H 2 O) conditions (Perez et al. 2002; Nwachkwu et al. 2010). Cellulose is composed of β- 1, 4 glycosidic linkages between d-glucose subunits. It is found in different forms such as crystalline and amorphous (cellulose chains are non-organized and less resistant to enzymatic degradation) (Perez et al. 2002). Cellulases are the enzymes responsible for the breakdown of β- 1, 4 glycosidic bonding of cellulose. These cellulases are classified as endoglucanases (EGs or endo- 1, 4 -b- glucanases) and cellobiohydrolases (CBHs or exo- 1, 4 -b-glucanases) that hydrolyze internal bonding {{and the end of the}} chains, respectively. Cellobiose molecules generated from cellulose by the endoglucanases and cellobiohydrolases are hydrolyzed by β-glucosidases and releases two units of glucose. CBHs act on crystalline cellulose effectively. Breakdown of cellulose makes carbon available to microorganisms. Pseudomonas, Streptomyces and Cellulomonas are reported for cellulase activity (Perez et al. 2002; Leschine 1995; Souza 2013; Kameshwar and Qin 2016). Fungal degradation of cellulose was reported with members of Basidiomycetes and Chytridiomycetes (Souza 2013). Fungi are also reported to have cellulase activity, including Phanerochaete chrysosporium and Trichoderma reesei. Anaerobic biodegradation of cellulose is very complex compared to aerobic degradation (Leschine 1995; Souza 2013; Kameshwar and Qin 2016). Larroque et al. (2012) studied CBM 1 (carbohydrate-binding module) containing proteins from fungi and Oomycetes (Phytophthora parasitica). In the case of Oomycetes, CBM 1 is involved in plant immunity by adhesion to polysaccharide (cellulose) substrates, while CBM 1 of fungi is reported for cellulose degradation.|$|R
30|$|Total {{production}} of the well known mexican spirit called Tequila was around 242.4 million liters in 2014 (CRT 2015 b). With seasonal variations in the past decades, Tequila production {{in the last ten}} years has nearly doubled (CNIT 2015). Thus, this economic activity is very important for a mexican region comprising 181 municipalities that retain the protected apellation of origin for this representative beverage (CRT 2015 a). Being a spirit, Tequila production generates distillery wastewater (i.e. vinasse) in the order of 7 – 12  L of vinasse per liter of tequila produced and it is characterised for having a brownish color, high content of organic matter, low pH and high dissolved and suspended solids concentration (Méndez-Acosta et al. 2010; Buitrón et al. 2014 b; López-López et al. 2010). Therefore, an estimate of Tequila vinasses production in 2014 was around 2, 424 million liters and it is considered that only a small fraction of this received treatment before discharging it to water bodies and soil. Few tequila producers have invested in acquiring wastewater treatment plants and installed facilities for reducing the environmental impact of these effluents, being the anaerobic digestion (AD) process the most successful core technology for removing high levels of organic matter together with the {{production of}} bioenergy in the form of biogas (Buitrón et al. 2014 b). However, it is acknowledged that the AD process is characterized by a delicate syntrophic interaction and dependence between Bacteria and Archaea, which can be upset by changes in some operational parameters and environmental conditions such as pH, substrate concentration, organic loading rate, toxic and/or inhibitory compounds present in complex effluents such as vinasses (Chen et al. 2008; Pant and Adholeya 2007; Silva et al. 2013; Mendez-Acosta et al. 2011). A common phenomenon that occurs in <b>anaerobic</b> <b>digestors</b> treating tequila vinasses is known as acidification of the system (Ilangovan et al. 2000). This undesirable phenomenon for anaerobic digestion operators has received little attention so far, but it could be considered as an opportunity for hydrogen production and volatile fatty acids (VFA) recovery rather than being an avoidable and unwanted process condition in terms of organic matter reduction with biogas production.|$|R

We also chose to test whether alkane- and arenesulfonates could serve as electron sinks in respiratory metabolism. We generated 60 anoxic enrichment cultures in mineral salts medium which included several potential electron donors and a single organic sulfonate as an electron sink, and we used material from <b>anaerobic</b> <b>digestors</b> in communal sewage works as inocula. None of the four aromatic sulfonates, the three unsubstituted alkanesulfonates, or the N-sulfonate tested gave positive enrichment cultures requiring both the electron donor and electron sink for growth. Nine cultures utilizing the natural products taurine, cysteate, or isethionate were considered positive for growth, and all formed sulfide. Two clearly different pure cultures were examined. Putative Desulfovibrio sp. strain RZACYSA, with lactate as the electron donor, utilized sulfate, aminomethanesulfonate, taurine, isethionate, and cysteate, converting the latter to ammonia, acetate, and sulfide. Strain RZATAU was identified by 16 S rDNA analysis as Bilophila wadsworthia. In the presence of, e. g., formate as the electron donor, it utilized, e. g., cysteate and isethionate and converted taurine quantitatively to cell material and products identified as ammonia, acetate, and sulfide. Sulfite and thiosulfate, but not sulfate, were utilized as electron sinks, as was nitrate, when lactate was provided as the electron donor and carbon source. A growth requirement for 1, 4 -naphthoquinone indicates a menaquinone electron carrier, {{and the presence of}} cytochrome c supports the presence of an electron transport chain. Pyruvate-dependent disappearance of taurine from cell extracts, as well as formation of alanine and release of ammonia and acetate, was detected. We suspected that sulfite is an intermediate, and we detected desulfoviridin (sulfite reductase).

At 55 degrees C a start-up culture, in which waste {{was the only}} source of bacteria, was generated within 8 days and readily adapted to 60 degrees C, where efficiency of methanogenesis was greater. Increasing the temperature from 60 to 65 degrees C tended to drastically lower efficiency. When feed concentrations of volatile solids (VS, organic matter) were increased in steps of 2 % after holding for 1 months at a given concentration, the maximum concentrations for efficient fermentation were 8. 2, 10. 0, 11. 6, and 11. 6 % for the retention times (RT) of 3, 6, 9, and 12 days, respectively. The VS destructions for these and lower feed concentrations were 31 to 37, 36 to 40, 47 to 49 and 51 to 53 % for the 3 -, 6 -, 9 -, and 12 -day RT digestors, respectively, and the corresponding methane production rates were about 0. 16, 0. 18, 0. 20, and 0. 22 liters/day per g of VS in the feed. Gas contained 52 to 57 % methane. At the above RT and feed concentrations, alkalinity rose to 5, 000 to 7, 700 mg of CaCo 3 per liter (pH to 7. 5 to 7. 8), NH 3 plus NH 4 + to 64 to 90 mM, and total volatile acids to 850 to 2, 050 mg/liter as acetate. The 3 -day RT digestor was quite stable up to 8. 2 % feed VS and at this feed concentration produced methane at the very high rate of 4. 5 liters/day per liter of digestor. Increasing the percentage of feed VS beyond those values indicated above resulted in greatly decreased organic matter destruction and methane production, variable decrease in pH, and increased alkalinity, ammonia, and total volatile acid concentrations, with propionate being the first to accumulate in large amounts.

In labelling studies with 14 CO 2, cell lipids (including approx. 50 % PHB) of acetone-grown cells became labelled 7 times as high as those of 3 -hydroxy-butyrate-grown cells. Enzyme studies indicated that acetone was degraded via acetoacetyl-CoA, and that acetone was channeled into the intermediary metabolism after condensation with carbon dioxide to a C 4 -com-pound, possibly free acetoacetate. Acetoacetyl-CoA is cleaved by a thiolase reaction to acetyl-CoA which is completely oxidized through the carbon monoxide de-hydrogenase pathway. Strain KMRActS was deposited with the Deutsche Sammlung yon Mikroorganismen, Braunschweig, under the number DSM 5651...|$|E
40|$|Enrichment {{cultures}} {{were prepared}} under strictly anoxic conditions in medium representing fresh water and containing an organosulfonate as electron donor and carbon source, and nitrate as electron acceptor. The inoculum {{was from the}} <b>anaerobic</b> <b>digestor</b> of two communal sewage works. The natural organosulfonates 2 -aminoethanesulf onate (taurine), ~~- 2 -amino- 3 -sulfopropionate (cysteate) and 2 -hydroxyethanesulf onate (isethionate) al l gave positive enrichments, whereas unsubstituted alkanesulfonates, such as methanesulfonate and arenesulfonates, gave no enrichment. Two representative enrichments were used to obtain pure cultures, and strains NKNTAU (utilizing taurine) and NKNIS (utilizing isethionate) were isolated. Strain NKNTAU was examined in detail. Out of 18 tested organosulfonates, it utilized only one, taurine, and {{was identified as a}} novel AIcaligenes sp., a facultatively anaerobic bacterium. Carbon from taurine was converted to cell material and carbon dioxide. The amino group was released as ammonium ion and the sulfonate moiety was recovered as sulfate. Nitrate was reduced to nitrogen gas...|$|E
40|$|A {{strictly}} anaerobic, homoacetogenic, Gram-positive, non spore-forming bacterium, designated strain SR 12 T (T = type strain), {{was isolated}} from an <b>anaerobic</b> methanogenic <b>digestor</b> fed with olive mill wastewater. Yeast extract {{was required for}} growth but {{could also be used}} as sole carbon and energy source. Strain SR 12 T utilized a few carbohydrates (glucose, fructose and sucrose), organic compounds (lactate, crotonate, formate and betaine), alcohols (methanol), the methoxyl group of some methoxylated aromatic compounds, and H 2 +CO 2. The end-products of carbohydrate fermentation were acetate, formate, butyrate, H 2 and CO 2. End-products from lactate and methoxylated aromatic compounds were acetate and butyrate. Strain SR 12 T was non-motile, formed aggregates, had a G+C content of 55 mol% and grew optimally at 35 °C and pH 7. 2 on a medium containing glucose. Phylogenetically, strain SR 12 T was related to #Eubacterium barkeri$, #E. callanderi$, and #E. limosum$ and #E. barkeri$ as the closest relative (similarity of 98 %) with which it bears little phenotypic similarity or DNA homology (60 %). On the basis of its phenotypic, genotypic, and phylogenetic characteristics, we propose to designate strain SR 12 T as #Eubacterium aggregans$ sp. nov. The type strain is SR 12 T (=DSM 12183).

40|$|A PCR-based {{method and}} a reverse {{transcriptase}} PCR (RT-PCR) -based method were {{developed for the}} detection of pathogenic bacteria in organic waste, using Salmonella spp., Listeria monocytogenes, Yersinia enterocolitica, and Staphylococcus aureus as model organisms. In seeded organic waste samples, detection limits of less than 10 cells per g of organic waste were achieved after one-step enrichment of bacteria, isolation, and purification of DNA or RNA before PCR or RT-PCR amplification. To test the reproducibility and reliability of the newly developed methods, 46 unseeded samples were collected from diverse aerobic (composting) facilities and <b>anaerobic</b> <b>digestors</b> and analyzed by both culture-based classical and newly developed PCR-based procedures. No false-positive but some false-negative results were generated by the PCR- or RT-PCR-based methods after one-step enrichment when compared to the classical detection methods. The results indicated that the level of activity of the tested bacteria in unseeded samples was very low compared to that of freshly inoculated cells, preventing samples from reaching the cell density required for PCR-based detection after one-step enrichment. However, for Salmonella spp., a distinct PCR product could be obtained for all 22 nonamended samples that tested positive for Salmonella spp. by the classical detection procedure when a selective two-step enrichment (20 h in peptone water at 37 °C and 24 h in Rappaport Vassiliadis medium at 43 °C) was performed prior to nucleic acid extraction and PCR. Hence, the classical procedure was shortened, since cell plating and further differentiation of isolated colonies can be omitted, substituted for by highly sensitive and reliable detection based on nucleic acid extraction and PCR. Similarly, 2 of the 22 samples in which Salmonella spp. were detected also tested positive for Listeria monocytogenes according to a two-step enrichment procedure followed by PCR, compared to 3 samples that tested positive when classical isolation procedures were followed. The study shows that selective two-step enrichment is useful when very low numbers of bacterial pathogens must be detected in organic waste materials, such as biosolids. There were no false-positive results derived from DNA of dead cells in the waste sample, suggesting that {{it is not necessary to}} perform RT-PCR analyses when PCR is combined with selective enrichment. Large numbers of added nontarget bacteria did not affect detection of Salmonella spp., L. monocytogenes, and Y. enterocolitica but increased the detection limit of Staphylococcus aureus from < 10 to 104 CFU/g of organic waste. Overall, the detection methods developed using seeded organic waste samples from one waste treatment facility (WTF) needed to be modified for satisfactory detection of pathogens in samples from other WTFs, emphasizing the need for extensive field testing of laboratory-derived PCR protocols. A survey of 13 WTFs in Germany revealed that all facilities complied with the German Biowaste Ordinance, which mandates that the end product after anaerobic digestion or aerobic composting be free of Salmonella. In addition, all biosolids were free of L. monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, and Y. enterocolitica, as evidenced by both classical and PCR-based detection methods...|$|R
40|$|A new genus {{and species}} of a nonmotile gram-negative rod, Syntrophobacter wolinii, is the first {{bacterium}} described which degrades propionate only in coculture with an H 2 -using organism {{and in the absence}} of light or exogenous electron acceptors such as O 2, sulfate, or nitrate. It was isolated from methanogenic enrichments from an <b>anaerobic</b> municipal sewage <b>digestor,</b> using <b>anaerobic</b> roll tubes containing a medium with propionate as the energy source in association with an H 2 -using, sulfate-reducing Desulfovibrio sp. which cannot utilize fatty acids other than formate. S. wolinii produced acetate and, presumably, CO 2 and H 2 (or formate) from propionate. In media without sulfate and with Methanospirillum hungatei, a methanogen that uses only H 2 -CO 2 or formate as an energy source, acetate, methane, and, presumably, CO 2 were produced from propionate and only small amounts of Desulfovibrio sp. were present. Isolation in coculture with the methanogen was not successful. S. wolinii does not use other saturated fatty acids as energy sources...|$|R
