25|$|Mainly {{known for}} his writings, Vitruvius was himself an architect. In Roman times {{architecture}} was a broader subject than at present including the modern fields of architecture, construction management, construction engineering, chemical engineering, civil engineering, materials engineering, mechanical engineering, military engineering and urban planning; architectural engineers consider him the first of their discipline, a specialization previously known as technical architecture. Frontinus mentions him {{in connection with the}} standard sizes of pipes. He is often credited as father of <b>architectural</b> <b>acoustics</b> for describing the technique of echeas placement in theaters. The only building, however, that we know Vitruvius to have worked on is one he tells us about, a basilica completed in 19 BC. It was built at Fanum Fortunae, now the modern town of Fano. The Basilica di Fano (to give the building its Italian name) has disappeared so completely that its very site is a matter of conjecture, although various {{attempts have been made to}} visualise it. The early Christian practice of converting Roman basilicae (public buildings) into cathedrals implies the basilica may be incorporated into the cathedral located in Fano.|$|E

40|$|This work {{investigates the}} {{acoustic}} {{characteristics of the}} double elliptical vault, which overlooks the Grand Staircase of the Royal Palace of Caserta (Italy). The Royal Palace was built by the architect Luigi Vanvitelli in the Seventeenth Century {{and it is the}} largest royal building in Italy. The double elliptical vault presents a great scenography effect. Inside the vault, on the planking level, musicians used to play for the king and his guests when the royal procession, going up the grand staircase, entered the royal apartments, creating astonishment among the guests who heard the music without understanding from where it was coming. Since the musicians were inside the vault, the long reverberation made the listeners perceive the vault to be enveloped by the music. To investigate this effect, the acoustic characteristics of the double vault were measured, putting the sound source on the planking level of the vault, while the microphones were put along the staircase and in the vestibule towards the royal apartments. Finally, the spatial distribution of several acoustic parameters is evaluated also using <b>architectural</b> <b>acoustic</b> simulations...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} how urban design techniques {{can be used}} for path mitigation of transit noise. Noise problems from rail transit systems persist despite the existence of at-source noise reduction techniques for rail transit systems and substantial research on <b>architectural</b> <b>acoustic</b> solutions. Conventional planning literature suggests separating noise sources from residential parcels, a theory now seen as inadequate in dense urban environments. Because noise remains a problem, new techniques should be explored to find alternative means of reducing environmental noise. By using computer software to model the promulgation of environmental noise from rail transit, the effectiveness of eight urban design techniques were examined. In addition to the preliminary modeling of the eight techniques, four neighborhoods were modeled to examine how noise promulgates through real environments. Additional urban design elements were then added to the model to determine how these urban design techniques can mitigate noise. This thesis concludes that urban design techniques can be used to mitigate transit noise; however, noise should not be the only consideration when designing the urban environment. Furthermore, the thesis makes recommendations regarding land use policy and transit system management...|$|R
40|$|Static {{directivity}} {{patterns of}} musical instruments have been mapped somewhat extensively, but {{little research has}} been done in analyzing the directivity patterns of musical instruments over time as they play. Directivity patterns can be affected by variables such as instrument, frequency, dynamics, and style. This thesis proposes a set of quantification methods of time varying directivity, all derived from the maximum Directivity Index analyzed at consecutive short-duration time windows comprising the musical excerpt. The instrumental recordings used in this paper are taken in an anechoic chamber using either a 5, 13, or 32 multichannel setup. From the values of maximum Directivity Index evaluated using the windowing technique, quantifiers including Average Maximum Directivity Index, Average Change in Maximum Directivity Index, Location Change Ratio, Dominance Ratio, and Dominating Location are calculated. In addition to establishing time varying directivity metrics, this thesis looks at how factors such as instrument family, orchestral excerpt, and number of microphone channels used in data acquisition affect the values of the proposed metrics. The importance of understanding time varying directivity patterns of musical instruments as well as <b>architectural</b> <b>acoustic</b> applications connected to this research are also discussed.

40|$|Recording {{rooms are}} {{generally}} required very small acoustic echoes and noiseness from exterior spaces. However, human beings recognize what they utter partly through acoustic echoes when they speak. In {{order to examine}} the feasibility of {{the achievement of the}} two opposite elements in a recording room, small acoustic echoes for accurate recordings and moderate echoes for natural utterances, this article set up a simplified anechoic room up to a room in <b>Architectural</b> <b>Acoustic</b> Lab. and assessed its performance. The reverberation time and the distance decay loss of sound pressure level were used as the evaluation indicators. The result showed that the reverberation time was longer than that of anechoic room, so that the speaker can utter more naturally in the recording room. However, the reverberation time was also short enough for blocking the influence of echoes. The effect of distance decay loss of the sound pressure level on the recordings was ignorable when the microphone was placed within 1. 0 meter long from the speaker 2 ̆ 7 s mouth. These results suggest that a recording room with the 2 opposite elements, small acoustic echoes for accurate recordings and moderate echoes for natural utterances, is realistic...|$|R

40|$|The {{recording}} studio, a {{site that}} music makers use to represent and produce sonic culture, {{is not merely a}} musical place. Recording studios are social, electronic, <b>architectural,</b> <b>acoustic,</b> and creative technologies of representation. Throughout recording processes, music industries seek to mystify the functional status of the studio among consumers of pop music. This encourages alienation between consumers and producers of popular music, rendering the agency of music business interests invisible, inaudible, and transparent. Roben Jones's Memphis Boys: The Story of American Studios, John Hartley Fox's King of the Queen City: The Story of King Records, and Andy Bradley and Roger Wood's House of Hits: The Story of Houston's Gold Star/Sugarhill Recording Studios present music scholarship with three recording studios that significantly contributed to American popular music. These works successfully document the local and national contexts in which these studios produced, as well as many accounts of individuals {{who were involved in the}} studios and specific recording sessions; however, these are books in which the representation of recording studios weighs heavily on celebrations of illustrious music makers and the popular music they produce. Jones and Fox are not as careful in attending to the diverse artistic and technological agencies of architects, carpenters, acousticians, engineers, musicians, producers, and business people in the history of the recording studios as are Bradley and Wood. Works such as these perpetuate readers' misunderstanding of the complexities involved in recording studio labor and inhibit scholarly analyses of popular music production. Representations of recording studio life comprise a small category of scholarship on popular music...|$|R
