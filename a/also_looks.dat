5|$|Author Hiromu Arakawa {{integrated}} several {{social problems}} into the plot, {{such as the}} way Edward and Alphonse live as brothers {{after the death of}} their mother, Trisha. She <b>also</b> <b>looks</b> at how the brothers help {{people all over the country}} to gain an understanding of the meaning of family. When describing the character's personality, Arakawa comments that after his father's departure from home and his mother's death, Edward tried to replace the role of the man for the Elric family. As a result, Van Hohenheim's reappearance caused a shocking and terrified reaction in the character. Arakawa has noted that Edward is one of her favorite characters from the series, although she denied having the same personality as him when one of her assistants mentioned it.|$|E

When a wine is well balanced, the wine is said to have achieved a harmonious fusion.|$|E
25|$|Empire and Communications {{examines}} {{the impact of}} media such as stone, clay, papyrus and the alphabet on the empires of Egypt and Babylonia. It <b>also</b> <b>looks</b> at the oral tradition in ancient Greece; the written tradition and the Roman Empire; the influence of parchment and paper in medieval Europe {{and the effects of}} paper and the printing press in modern times.|$|E

She cares fiercely for Esther’s future, wants her {{to have a life}} outside of the yard and not end up like Mavis, and practices tough love on Esther and Charlie as a result. She <b>also</b> <b>looks</b> after Rosa as if she was family, and even offers to help her take care of her child when it is born.|$|E
25|$|The novel Song of Solomon follows Milkman’s {{life from}} his birth to his leap towards his friend Guitar. Toni Morrison conjoins and mixes in her novel present and past from the {{perspectives}} of different personages. The narrator not only observes the situations, taking place in the novel, but <b>also</b> <b>looks</b> into the inner life of the novel personages. Thus, the reader learns about background of the characters, the feelings and relations with each other, with black and white community and knows more about events of the novel, than any other character.|$|E

25|$|True Stories of CSI: The Real Crimes Behind the Best Episodes of the Popular TV Show (published August 2009) – Katherine Ramsland {{follows the}} {{evidence}} and revisits {{some of the most}} absorbing episodes of the phenomenally popular C.S.I. television franchise, and explores the real-life crimes that inspired them. She <b>also</b> <b>looks</b> into the authenticity of the forensic investigations recreated for the dramatizations, and the painstaking real-life forensic process employed in every one of the actual cases—from notorious mass-murderer Richard Speck, through the massacre of Buddhist monks in an Arizona Temple, to a baffling case of apparent spontaneous combustion.|$|E
25|$|Current {{research}} <b>also</b> <b>looks</b> at DES in {{the third}} generation. These are the grandchildren of women who were given DES during pregnancy and whose mother or father was therefore exposed to DES in utero. Studies of the third generation are important because DES might be associated with epigenetic changes, which involve changes to the way genes behave (not involving the DNA itself) that may be heritable {{from one generation to}} another. If epigenetic changes occur and are heritable, studies of the DES-exposed third generation have implications for the influence of environmental endocrine disruptors on human health and evolution.|$|E
25|$|In philosophy, Leibniz is most {{noted for}} his optimism, i.e. his {{conclusion}} that our Universe is, in a restricted sense, {{the best possible}} one that God could have created, an idea that was often lampooned by others such as Voltaire. Leibniz, along with René Descartes and Baruch Spinoza, {{was one of the}} three great 17th-century advocates of rationalism. The work of Leibniz anticipated modern logic and analytic philosophy, but his philosophy <b>also</b> <b>looks</b> back to the scholastic tradition, in which conclusions are produced by applying reason to first principles or prior definitions rather than to empirical evidence.|$|E

Charlie tries and fails to explain what bigotry is to the lizard after Leslie speaks badly of fish. Leslie thinks they are dirty and too numerous. He <b>also</b> <b>looks</b> down on humans {{because they do not}} lay eggs. Yet Leslie also has some empathy for the humans. Leslie knows that he and Sarah must look odd to Charlie and Nancy. He also understands that Charlie is being difficult when Nancy mentions that her husband thinks they are dead and that this situation is some sort of hallucination.|$|E
25|$|Pretext for Mass Murder by {{historian}} John Roosa is a {{work that}} traces a historical path through the 1965 incidents, painting a scenario of explanations for what preceded, caused and followed the political coup. It focuses on several aspects of the coup such as the incoherence of facts and the incompetence of coup organizers to provide four main interpretations of the coup:(1) the movement as an attempted coup d’etat by the PKI, (2) the movement as a mutiny of junior officers, (3) the movement as an alliance of army officers and the PKI, and (4) the movement as a frame-up of the PKI. It <b>also</b> <b>looks</b> at material previously left unexplored in traditional discussions of the incident to give a reconstruction of the chaos that surrounds {{this period of time}} in Indonesian history.|$|E
25|$|In Mixed Feelings, Cvetkovich {{primarily}} {{explores the}} politics of affect in relation to Victorian sensationalism in the 1860s and 1870s. While she focuses mostly on traditional Victorian sensation novels such as Mary Elizabeth Braddon's Lady Audley's Secret, Wilkie Collins's The Woman in White, and Ellen Wood's East Lynne, she <b>also</b> <b>looks</b> at works that are not typically read as Victorian sensationalism. One chapter looks at George Eliot's Daniel Deronda, where she reads Gwendolen's “dramatic interiority” {{in relation to the}} affective power of sensation novels. Another reads Karl Marx's Capital as a sensationalist narrative; while most of the works Cvetkovich studies sensationalize the figure of the middle-class woman, Capital sensationalizes the male worker's body. Although Mixed Feelings focuses primarily on Victorian sensationalism, the book also contains discussions of AIDS activism and {{the politics of}} affect in relation to ACT UP.|$|E

25|$|Sheldon Nahmod of Chicago-Kent College of Law shares Wells's criticism. He {{points to}} one case in {{particular}} where the Court seemed {{to recognize the}} theory that constitutional violations should always be grounds for liability regardless of whatever other issues exist. In Carey v. Phipus, decided a year after Mt. Healthy, the Court held that two students challenging their suspensions were entitled to prove that their due process rights were violated as they alleged even if the suspensions themselves {{turned out to have}} been factually justified. While not a constitutional claim, he <b>also</b> <b>looks</b> to 1995's McKennon v. Nashville Banner Publishing Co., a case under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, where an age discrimination verdict against a private employer was upheld even though the respondent had concededly met the Mt. Healthy burden with evidence of her wrongdoing because that evidence was discovered subsequent to the employee's termination.|$|E
500|$|The American philosopher Ken Wilber {{has called}} Sri Aurobindo [...] "India's {{greatest}} modern philosopher sage" [...] and has integrated {{some of his}} ideas into his philosophical vision.

500|$|Lyrically, The Altar and the Door {{deals with}} Christian themes. [...] "Slow Fade" [...] deals with how moments of {{compromise}} and mistakes {{can lead to}} a [...] "downward spiritual spiral"; it urges listeners to make the right choices. [...] "East to West" [...] is about forgiveness and the skepticism with which humans accept it. [...] "What This World Needs" [...] calls the Christian church out for making Jesus' message confusing by adding things to it; it <b>also</b> <b>looks</b> at the current state of society. [...] "Prayer for a Friend" [...] is a [...] "simple" [...] song of intercession.|$|E
