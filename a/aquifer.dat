5|$|About 92% of Bahrain is desert with {{periodic}} droughts {{and dust}} storms, the main natural hazards for Bahrainis. Environmental issues facing Bahrain include desertification {{resulting from the}} degradation of limited arable land, coastal degradation (damage to coastlines, coral reefs, and sea vegetation) resulting from oil spills and other discharges from large tankers, oil refineries, distribution stations, and illegal land reclamation at places such as Tubli Bay. The agricultural and domestic sectors' over-utilisation of the Dammam <b>Aquifer,</b> the principal <b>aquifer</b> in Bahrain, has led to its salinisation by adjacent brackish and saline water bodies. A hydrochemical study identified {{the locations of the}} sources of <b>aquifer</b> salinisation and delineated their areas of influence. The investigation indicates that the <b>aquifer</b> water quality is significantly modified as groundwater flows from the northwestern parts of Bahrain, where the <b>aquifer</b> receives its water by lateral underflow from eastern Saudi Arabia, to the southern and southeastern parts. Four types of salinisation of the <b>aquifer</b> are identified: brackish-water up-flow from the underlying brackish-water zones in north-central, western, and eastern regions; seawater intrusion in the eastern region; intrusion of sabkha water in the southwestern region; and irrigation return flow in a local area in the western region. Four alternatives for the management of groundwater quality that are available to the water authorities in Bahrain are discussed and their priority areas are proposed, based on the type and extent of each salinisation source, in addition to groundwater use in that area.|$|E
5|$|All of Florida's {{abundant}} {{fresh water}} {{is the result of}} precipitation that returns to the atmosphere in a process called evapotranspiration that involves evaporation and transpiration of moisture from plants. As rains fall, most of the water is directed to lakes, streams, and rivers. However, a significant amount of fresh water is held underground but close to the surface in aquifers. A surficial <b>aquifer</b> consisting mostly of clay, shells, and sand is over a confining layer of denser materials. Wells are drilled in the surficial <b>aquifer,</b> which supplies better quality water in areas where the deepest <b>aquifer</b> has a high mineral content. Occasionally the confining layer is fractured to allow breaches of water to percolate down to recharge the layer below. The Floridan <b>Aquifer,</b> underneath the confining layer, underlies the entire state and portions of Georgia, Alabama, and South Carolina. It is particularly accessible {{in the northern part of}} Florida, serving as the fresh water source of metropolitan areas from St. Petersburg north to Jacksonville and Tallahassee.|$|E
25|$|Because {{of their}} high {{porosity}} and permeability, sand and gravel <b>aquifers</b> have higher hydraulic conductivity than clay or unfractured granite <b>aquifers.</b> Sand or gravel <b>aquifers</b> would thus be easier to extract water from (e.g., using a pumping well) because {{of their high}} transmissivity, compared to clay or unfractured bedrock <b>aquifers.</b>|$|R

5|$|Much of {{the return}} flows do not issue {{directly}} back into the Snake River, but rather feed the Snake River <b>Aquifer</b> underneath the Snake River Plain. Water diverted from the river for irrigation, after absorbing any surface pollutants, re-enters the ground and feeds the <b>aquifer.</b> Although the <b>aquifer</b> has maintained its level, {{it has become increasingly}} laced with contaminants. Water in the <b>aquifer</b> eventually travels to {{the west side of the}} Snake River Plain and re-enters the river as springs. Throughout much of the Snake River Plain and Hells Canyon, excessive sediment is also a recurring problem. In December 2007, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a permit requiring owners of fish farms along the Snake River to reduce their phosphorus discharge by 40%. Pollutant levels in Hells Canyon upstream of the Salmon River confluence, including that of water temperature, dissolved nutrients, and sediment, are required to meet certain levels.|$|E
5|$|Several of {{the larger}} Death Valley springs derive their water from a {{regional}} <b>aquifer,</b> which extends as far east as southern Nevada and Utah. Much {{of the water in}} this <b>aquifer</b> has been there for many thousands of years, since the Pleistocene ice ages, when the climate was cooler and wetter. Today's drier climate does not provide enough precipitation to recharge the <b>aquifer</b> at the rate at which water is being withdrawn.|$|E
5|$|A {{geothermal}} heat pump can extract enough heat from shallow ground {{anywhere in the}} world to provide home heating, but industrial applications need the higher temperatures of deep resources. The thermal efficiency and profitability of electricity generation is particularly sensitive to temperature. The most demanding applications receive the greatest benefit from a high natural heat flux, ideally from using a hot spring. The next best option is to drill a well into a hot <b>aquifer.</b> If no adequate <b>aquifer</b> is available, an artificial one may be built by injecting water to hydraulically fracture the bedrock. This last approach is called hot dry rock geothermal energy in Europe, or enhanced geothermal systems in North America. Much greater potential may be available from this approach than from conventional tapping of natural aquifers.|$|E
25|$|<b>Aquifers</b> are {{critically}} important in human habitation and agriculture. Deep <b>aquifers</b> in arid areas {{have long been}} water sources for irrigation (see Ogallala below). Many villages and even large cities draw their water supply from wells in <b>aquifers.</b>|$|R

50|$|Surficial <b>aquifers</b> are shallow <b>aquifers</b> {{typically}} {{less than}} 50 ft thick, but larger surficial <b>aquifers</b> of about 60 ft have been mapped.

The <b>aquifers</b> are replenished by streams and from precipitation and can vary in volume considerably as the water table fluctuates. Being shallow,they are liable to contamination by fuel spills, industrial discharge, landfills, and saltwater. Parts of southeastern United States are dependent on surficial <b>aquifers</b> for their water supplies.|$|R

5|$|The {{population}} of Gaza depends on groundwater {{as the only}} source for drinking, agricultural use, and domestic supply. The nearest stream is Wadi Ghazza to the south, sourced from Abu Middein along the coastline. It bears {{a small amount of}} water during the winter and virtually no water during the summer. Most of its water supply is diverted into Israel. The Gaza <b>Aquifer</b> along the coast is the main <b>aquifer</b> in the Gaza Strip and it consists mostly of Pleistocene sandstones. Like most of the Gaza Strip, Gaza is covered by quaternary soil; clay minerals in the soil absorb many organic and inorganic chemicals which has partially alleviated the extent of groundwater contamination.|$|E
5|$|The river {{flows through}} the South Downs National Park, and is a {{designated}} Site of Nature Conservation Importance, in recognition of its value for wildlife.

The quality of the water is generally good, and the river is measured at four gauging stations, three on the main channel, and one of the River Lod, just before its junction with the Rother. Water from the underlying Lower Greensand <b>aquifer</b> and the adjacent chalk <b>aquifer</b> helps to maintain the flows during the summer months, despite the fact that large volumes are abstracted from both the aquifers and the river for the public water supply.|$|E
