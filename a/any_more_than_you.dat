500|$|The Word for World is Forest {{shares the}} theme of dreaming with the later Le Guin novel The Lathe of Heaven. Suzanne Reid stated that the novel {{examines}} the source and effect of dreams. The Athsheans teach themselves to consciously and actively control their dreams. This allows them to access their subconscious {{in a way that}} the Terrans are not able. The Athsheans follow a polycyclic sleep pattern with a period of 120 minutes, which makes it impossible for them to adapt to the Terran eight-hour work day. Their dreaming is not restricted to times when they are asleep, with adept dreamers being able to dream while wide awake as well. [...] The visions they see while dreaming direct and shape their waking behavior, which Selver describes as [...] "balanc your sanity... on the double support, the fine balance, of reason and dream; once you have learned that, you cannot unlearn it <b>any</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>you</b> can unlearn to think." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{news of his}} mother's death reaches Luke, the Captain, anticipating that Luke might {{attempt to}} escape in order to attend his mother's funeral, has him locked in the prison {{punishment}} box. After being released from the box, receiving word that his mother's burial is completed and being told to forget about her, Luke is determined to escape. Under {{the cover of a}} Fourth of July celebration, he makes his initial escape attempt. He is later recaptured by local police and returned to the chain gang, but not before one of the bloodhounds sent after him dies from strain caused by struggling through barbed-wire fences. After his capture and return, the Captain has Luke fitted with leg-irons and delivers a warning speech to the other inmates, explaining, [...] "What we've got here is failure to communicate. Some men you just can't reach. So you get what we had here last week, which is the way he wants it. Well, he gets it. I don't like it <b>any</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>you</b> men." ...|$|E

500|$|Kelefa Sanneh wrote a lukewarm {{review of}} the album in The New York Times, believing that Jay-Z's {{reluctance}} to indulge in the gangsta rap lyricism of his past resulted in wavering, equivocal songs such as [...] "No Hook" [...] and [...] "Say Hello". [...] "Once, words just seemed to flow out of him, as if he couldn't help himself", Sanneh wrote. [...] "Now it's clearer than ever that he's choosing them carefully." [...] Louis Pattison of NME was more critical and called it a regression from the [...] "slightly bloated" [...] Kingdom Come, lamenting the shortage of [...] "don't-give-a-fuck attitude" [...] highlighted on [...] "Success" [...] in favor of less effective raps exploiting Jay-Z's entrepreneurial personage. In MSN Music, Robert Christgau cited [...] "Say Hello" [...] and [...] "Blue Magic" [...] as highlights while humorously using sampled film dialogue from the latter track to frame his lukewarm opinion of the album: [...] "Jay-Z, that's a brand name, like Pepsi, that's a brand name – he stands behind it, he guarantees it, even if you don't know him <b>any</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>you</b> know the chairman of Universal Music".|$|E

2500|$|Whilst Clarkson {{states such}} views in his columns {{and in public}} appearances, his public persona does not {{necessarily}} represent his personal views, as he acknowledged whilst interviewing Alastair Campbell saying [...] "I don't believe what I write, <b>any</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>you</b> [...] believe what you say".|$|E

2500|$|The state's $22 {{million budget}} surplus {{disappeared}} during Craig's term, {{in large part}} though due to the Korean War bonus paid out to soldiers to enlist that the assembly authorized over Craig's veto. Craig was quoted as saying, [...] "you can't put a bonus on patriotism <b>any</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>you</b> can on motherhood." [...] The bonus cost the state $7.6 million. The rest of the surplus was spent on school consolidation as one room schoolhouses were phased out and students bused to larger centralized facilities.|$|E
2500|$|In 2005, {{he voted}} for the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act. The act's purpose was to prevent {{firearms}} manufacturers and dealers from being held liable for negligence when crimes have been committed with their products. In 2015, Sanders defended his vote, saying: [...] "If somebody has a gun and it falls {{into the hands of}} a murderer and the murderer kills somebody with a gun, do you hold the gun manufacturer responsible? Not <b>any</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>you</b> would hold a hammer company responsible if somebody beats somebody over the head with a hammer." ...|$|E
2500|$|Paul Ford cites several {{scholars}} who have weighed in against this view, and continues, [...] "most scholars disagree with this decision {{and find it}} the least faithful to Lewis's deepest intentions". Scholars and readers who appreciate the original order believe that Lewis was simply being gracious to his youthful correspondent {{and that he could}} have changed the books' order in his lifetime had he so desired. They maintain that much of the magic of Narnia comes from the way the world is gradually presented in The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe – that the mysterious wardrobe, as a narrative device, is a much better introduction to Narnia than The Magician's Nephew, where the word [...] "Narnia" [...] appears in the first paragraph as something already familiar to the reader. Moreover, they say, {{it is clear from the}} texts themselves that The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe was intended to be read first. When Aslan is first mentioned in The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, for example, the narrator says that [...] "None of the children knew who Aslan was, <b>any</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>you</b> do"— which is nonsensical if one has already read The Magician's Nephew. Other similar textual examples are also cited.|$|E
