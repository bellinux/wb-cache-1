5|$|Jaz Rignall (USgamer) {{noted that}} the 2015 Lara Croft Go <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{influenced}} by Monument Valley.|$|E
5|$|On the {{day they}} set out, Australian airmen {{reported}} that the garrisons at El Arish and Maghara Hills, in {{the centre of the}} Sinai, <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> withdrawn.|$|E
5|$|Afterwards, as Travers {{recovered}} in hospital, the second survivor Des McAlea gave the police {{a description of}} McDowell as the gunman with a moustache and wearing dark glasses who <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{the leader of the}} patrol.|$|E
50|$|Dancie's {{work does}} not <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> reprinted after 1623, {{nor does he}} <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{referenced}} in any future text.|$|R
50|$|Internally {{ceilings}} {{are lined}} with v-jointed boards but walls <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> re-lined when refurbishments have taken place. Some internal walls <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> removed.|$|R
50|$|Compounding <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> a {{much more}} {{productive}} process at an earlier stage of the language. It now has very limited productivity, and in many cases, it <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> completely lexicalized it it occurs.|$|R
5|$|As First Lady, {{she became}} influential. She stirred {{controversy}} after {{an assassination attempt}} against her occurred on 7 December 1972, when an assailant tried to stab her with a bolo knife but was shot by the police.The motive <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> her role in her husband's presidency but human rights dissidents believed it was staged by the government.|$|E
5|$|From early childhood, Johnson {{suffered}} from poor eyesight, especially {{in his left}} eye, which interfered with his education. There were somewhat contradictory reports about his eyesight from his contemporaries. He <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> near-sighted, yet he did not use eyeglasses. His eyesight became worse with age; still, his handwriting remained quite legible.|$|E
5|$|Brent Spiner as Dr. Brackish Okun, the unkempt {{and highly}} excitable {{scientist}} {{in charge of}} research at Area 51. Dr. Okun <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> killed by an alien but returned in the sequel, where {{it was revealed that}} the character had merely been in a coma. The character's appearance and verbal style are based upon those of visual effects supervisor Jeffrey A. Okun, with whom Emmerich had worked on Stargate.|$|E
5000|$|The {{high point}} of {{individual}} memberships <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> in 1950, when SNPJ had 71,554 members. The {{high point of}} lodge membership <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> in 1946, when SNPJ was composed of 614 active lodges.|$|R
5000|$|Control of the band's name <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> lost, {{at least}} in the United States. The name [...] "Fosterchild" [...] is {{currently}} associated with a Philadelphia-based heavy metal band, active since 2005, and where the name <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> trademarked.|$|R
50|$|Commercial {{reception}} <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> limited.|$|R
5|$|The {{boys were}} found in their beds in their own room (formerly Sheila's room). They <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> shot while in bed. The court heard that Daniel had been shot five times {{in the back of}} the head, four times with the gun held within one foot of his head, and once from over two feet away. Nicholas had been shot three times, all contact or close-proximity shots.|$|E
5|$|There {{are also}} streaky features, {{some of them}} {{hundreds}} of kilometers in length, {{that appear to be}} caused by windblown particles. Examination has also shown the surface to be relatively smooth; the few objects that seem to be impact craters <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> filled in, perhaps by raining hydrocarbons or volcanoes. Radar altimetry suggests height variation is low, typically no more than 150meters. Occasional elevation changes of 500meters have been discovered and Titan has mountains that sometimes reach several hundred meters to more than 1 kilometer in height.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} storm watch was issued for Bermuda on August27 but swiftly canceled {{the next day}} as Danielle steered well clear of the island. Swells from the powerful hurricane reached the East Coast of the United States, leading to the rescues of 250 people in Ocean City, Maryland and an additional 70 people {{off the coast of}} Central Florida. The body of a man—whose death <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> from drowning—was pulled from the waters of Satellite Beach, Florida; a second man went missing in Ocean City, but his body was never recovered and the search was eventually called off. Researchers examining the wreckage of RMS Titanic were forced to seek refuge in St. John's, Newfoundland; swells as large as 10ft (3m) impacted the coastline of Newfoundland.|$|E

50|$|The Sutean {{language}} <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> Semitic.|$|R
5|$|After McCoy {{told them}} they were the Miami Showband, Thomas Crozier (who had a notebook) asked the band members for their names and addresses, while the others bantered with them about {{the success of their}} {{performance}} that night. As Crozier took down the information, a car pulled up and another uniformed man appeared on the scene. He wore a uniform and beret noticeably different from the others. He spoke with an educated English accent and immediately took charge, ordering a man who <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> the leader of the patrol, to tell Crozier to obtain their names and dates of birth instead of addresses.|$|E
5|$|At {{approximately}} 8:00pm on 19 December 2010, Reardon {{returned home}} from a weekend visit to Sheffield to find Yeates absent from their flat on Canynge Road, Clifton. Reardon {{had been trying to}} contact her by phone and text, but without success. While awaiting Yeates' return, Reardon called her again, but her mobile phone rang from a pocket of her coat, which was still in the flat. He found that her purse and keys were also at the flat, and that their cat <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> neglected. Shortly after half past midnight, Reardon contacted the police and Yeates' parents to report her missing.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} support the robust head, the neck of Hatzegopteryx was likely {{strongly}} muscled. On the occipital bones, the nuchal lines, which serve as muscular attachments, are very well-developed and bear prominent scars. These conceivably supported the transversospinalis muscles, which aid in extension and flexion {{of the head and}} neck. Likewise, the opisthotic process, neural spines, and zygapophyses all <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> large and robust (with the latter bearing many pits and edges that likely represent muscle scars), and the basioccipital tuberosities were long; these all serve as points of attachment for various muscles of the head and neck. Although not entirely unmuscled, the neck of Arambourgiania probably would not have been as extensively muscled as that of Hatzegopteryx.|$|E
50|$|Government of Sri Lanka {{with the}} {{co-operation}} {{of the aid}} agencies, has taken all possible steps in getting food, medical supplies and other essential items across to the entrapped civilians. However, there <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> a paucity of medicines and the medical facilities <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> inadequate.|$|R
5000|$|The term [...] "transarmament" [...] <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{introduced}} in 1937 in a pamphlet by Kenneth Boulding. It <b>appears</b> not <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> used {{again until the}} 1960s.|$|R
50|$|The Regiment <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> disbanded in 1997.|$|R
5|$|On 12 January 2009, {{at least}} three people, {{including}} two Mexicans and one American, entered the Parque-Museo La Venta in Villahermosa and damaged just under 30 archaeological pieces, including the four La Venta colossal heads. The vandals were all members of an evangelical church and <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> carrying out a supposed pre-Columbian ritual, during which salts, grape juice, and oil were thrown on the heads. It was estimated that 300,000 pesos (US$21,900) {{would be needed to}} repair the damage, and the restoration process would last four months. The three vandals were released soon after their arrest after paying 330,000 pesos each.|$|E
5|$|Relatively {{little is}} known about {{recruiting}} processes for local 610 Offices. In rare instances where such information is available, 610 officers <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> drawn from other party or state agencies (such as the Political and Legislative Committee staff or Public Security Bureaus). Hao Fengjun, a defector and former officer with the 610 Office in Tianjin City, was one such officer. Hao had previously worked for the Public Security Bureau in Tianjin, and was among the officers selected to be seconded to the newly created 610 Office. According to Hao, few officers volunteered for a position in the 610 Office, so selections were made through a random draw. Some 610 Offices conduct their own recruiting efforts to bring in staff with university degrees.|$|E
5|$|That same evening, two further insurrectionary {{attempts}} {{failed in}} the Sơn Dương sector. A raid on the Garde indigène post in Hưng Hóa was repelled by the Vietnamese guards, who <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> tipped off. In {{the nearby town of}} Kinh Khe, VNQDD members killed the instructor Nguyen Quang Kinh and one of his wives. After destroying the Garde indigène post in Lâm Thao, the VNQDD briefly seized control of the district seat. At sunrise, a new Garde indigène unit arrived and inflicted heavy losses on the insurgents, mortally wounding Nhu. Aware of the events in the upper delta region, Pho Duc Chinh fled and abandoned a planned attack on the Sơn Tây garrison, but he was captured a few days later by French authorities.|$|E

5|$|The Hallaton Helmet is a {{decorated}} iron Roman cavalry parade helmet originally {{covered in a}} sheet of silver and decorated in places with gold leaf. It was discovered in 2000 near Hallaton, Leicestershire after Ken Wallace, {{a member of the}} Hallaton Fieldwork Group, found coins in the area. Further investigation by professional archaeologists from University of Leicester Archaeological Services discovered that the site <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> used as a large-scale Iron Age shrine. Nine years of conservation and restoration has been undertaken by experts from the British Museum, supported by a Heritage Lottery Fund grant of £650,000. The helmet is now on permanent display at the Harborough Museum in Market Harborough alongside other artefacts from the Hallaton Treasure hoard.|$|E
5|$|The first dent to morale {{came after}} about a week when the volunteers were first issued ranks in the Rhodesian Army. In {{the eyes of some}} of the French-speaking soldiers, the ranks {{assigned}} <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> chosen almost at random by their superiors, and did not reflect their actual respective levels of training, ability and experience. Some men who considered themselves to have been overlooked began to have problems with discipline. The brazen attitude of most of the company's soldiers jarred strongly with that of their Rhodesian commanders, who had high standards regarding presentation and dress which many of the Frenchmen had little inclination to meet.|$|E
5|$|A Television Infrared Observation Satellite (TIROS) {{revealed}} {{the presence of}} a tropical disturbance east of the Leeward Islands on September28. A reconnaissance aircraft flight into a system on the following day indicated that a tropical depression developed near 14.5°N, 48.9°W. The depression initially moved west-northwestward and remained disorganized for several days. In {{the early stages of the}} depression, the system <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> located under minor vortices in the upper atmosphere, located within a strong easttowest oriented trough. Approaching the Lesser Antilles, the system curved northwestward between two high pressure areas on September30 and avoided landfall in the islands. By October2, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Daisy. The trough dissipated on the following day, causing Daisy to resume its initial west-northwest motion. The storm intensified into a Category1 hurricane later on October3. Further deepening occurred, and by October5, Daisy became a Category2 hurricane.|$|E
