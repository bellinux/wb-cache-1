500|$|The BBC science-fiction series Doctor Who {{has often}} been heavily {{influenced}} by the various Quatermass serials, and despite Kneale's dislike of it ("It sounded a terrible idea <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>think</b> it was," [...] he commented in 1986) and his refusal to write for it, unofficial references to Quatermass {{have appeared in the}} programme and its spinoffs. [...] Serials directly influenced include The Web of Fear, The Invasion, Spearhead from Space, The Ambassadors of Death, Inferno, The Seeds of Doom and Image of the Fendahl, as well as the 2007 [...] "The Lazarus Experiment", which echoes the first serial's climax in Westminster Abbey, with the use of Southwark Cathedral. Former Doctor Who script editor and producer Derrick Sherwin admitted on a DVD documentary that the idea of setting more serials on contemporary Earth in the early 1970s was to recall a Quatermass feel.|$|E
500|$|Kneale {{never saw}} himself as a science-fiction writer, and was often {{critical}} of the genre. He particularly disliked the BBC series Doctor Who (1963–89; 1996; 2005–present), {{for which he had}} once turned down an offer to write. [...] "It sounded a terrible idea <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>think</b> it was," [...] he commented in 1986. [...] "The fact that it's lasted a long time and has a steady audience doesn't mean much. So has Crossroads and that's a stinker". He also slammed Blake's 7, which he described as the lowest point of British television science-fiction: [...] "I think the low point for me would be the very few bits I've seen of a thing called Blake's 7 which I found paralytically awful. The dialogue/characterisation seemed to consist of a kind of childish squabbling" [...] and Doomwatch: [...] "I was approached to write Doomwatch. That didn't seem to be much good either." [...] Doctor Who was heavily influenced by Kneale's Quatermass serials, in some cases even using specific storylines that were very similar to those from Quatermass.|$|E
500|$|The Gallagher {{brothers}} hold differing {{opinions about}} the album. As early as July 1997, Noel was [...] "talking down" [...] Be Here Now in the music press, describing the production as [...] "bland", and remarking {{that some of the}} tracks were [...] "fucking shit". Noel is also very keen to downplay the record's commercial success, saying: [...] "Just because you sell lots of records, it doesn't mean to say you're any good. Look at Phil Collins." [...] In Live Forever: The Rise and Fall of Brit Pop, he dismissed the album, and blamed its faults on drugs and the band's indifference during recording. He suggested that the people unsatisfied with the record simply sell it. In contrast, Noel noted that his brother [...] "thinks it fucking rocks." [...] In the same documentary, Liam defended the record, and said that [...] "at that time we thought it was fucking great, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>think</b> it's great. It just wasn't Morning Glory." [...] In 2006, Liam said of Noel, [...] "If he didn't like the record that much, he shouldn't have put the fucking record out in the first place... I don't know what's up with him but it's a top record, man, and I'm proud of it—it's just a little bit long." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{results of}} the study were {{politically}} sensitive, since a heavy death toll could raise questions regarding the humanitarian justifications {{on the eve of a}} contested US presidential election. Critics objected to the timing of the report, claiming it was hastily prepared and published despite what they perceived as its poor quality in order to sway the U.S. electorate. On this topic, Les Roberts stated [...] "I emailed it in on Sept. 30 under the condition that it came out before the election. My motive in doing that was not to skew the election. My motive was that if this came out during the campaign, both candidates would be forced to pledge to protect civilian lives in Iraq. I was opposed to the war <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>think</b> that the war was a bad idea, but I think that our science has transcended our perspectives." ...|$|E
2500|$|Flea has {{displayed}} {{a wide variety}} of techniques throughout the years, ranging from his initial use of slapping and popping to the more traditional methods he has employed since Blood Sugar Sex Magik. Greg Prato of Allmusic has noted, that [...] "by combining funk-style bass with psychedelic, punk, and hard rock, Flea created an original playing style that has been copied numerous times". Flea stated in an interview, that he was influenced greatly by Louis Armstrong. Flea has been considered one of the greatest bassists of all time, with Greg Tate of Rolling Stone saying [...] "if there were a Most Valuable Bass Player award given out in rock, Flea could have laid claim to that bitch ten years running". Smashing Pumpkins front man Billy Corgan recalls, that when he first saw the Chili Peppers in 1984, [...] "Flea was playing so aggressively that he had worn a hole in his thumb and he was literally screaming in pain in-between songs because it hurt so bad. Someone kept coming out and pouring crazy glue into the hole." [...] Flea's sound is also determined by what type of instrument he plays. Before Californication, he did not believe the actual bass held much significance: [...] "what mattered was how you hit them [...] and your emotional intent, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>think</b> that's the bottom line." [...] Flea owns a 1961 Fender Jazz Bass, treasuring it for its [...] "old wood sound".|$|E

[...] "I didn’t <b>think,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>still</b> don’t <b>think,</b> that this {{particular}} person {{would be the best}} example for our children," [...] Fleming said. [...] "And there were other people who we could have voted for, like (Air Force commander) Hoyt Vandenberg — he came from Lowell — or Bette Davis.

2500|$|Cantrell was a {{close friend}} of former Alice in Chains' lead singer Layne Staley, who he {{described}} as his best friend. Staley died in April 2002 at the same time of Cantrell's Degradation Trip tour, but Cantrell opted not to cancel any shows, stating, [...] "It's difficult to do interviews - it's hard to talk about it [...] I'm just thankful to have a tour and work - something I can focus on.". [...] "The shows I played between the time I got the word about Layne and Layne's funeral were very important to me in terms of being able to continue on. It's {{one of those things where}} if you take a break and allow things to settle in, it might be harder to get up again." [...] Cantrell's manager at the time, Bill Siddons, said: [...] "Jerry really loved Layne. They had a bond I haven't seen before." [...] Asked about Staley's death in an interview with MTV in July 2002, Cantrell said: [...] "It's something I'm still dealing with, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>think</b> like he's here. I miss him tremendously. I love him and have to move on. I'll remember him and respect the memories of what we did together and just enjoy life... and that's all I'll say about it." [...] William DuVall, who performed Staley's vocals during Cantrell's solo concerts, elaborated on this emotional period saying: [...] "I lost my grandfather in the same week, so Cantrell and I both hit the road with immense personal losses dogging us. There were times on stage—there was one show in Charlotte where it was just so heavy. I'm holding back tears onstage, and Jerry would start crying onstage too a lot at that point, and a lot of times we would just look at each other when we were singing the stuff because it was the only way... it was heavy. I can't quantify it really in words." [...] Cantrell canceled the show that he was scheduled to perform at Zephyrhills's Livestock Festival on April 28 in order to attend Staley's funeral in Seattle in the same day. Cantrell dedicated his solo album, Degradation Trip, released two months after Staley's death, to his memory. He also adopted Staley's cat, a female siamese named Sadie, after his death. The cat appeared on Cantrell's episode of MTV Cribs, which was shot at his ranch in Oklahoma in September 2002. Sadie died on the same night of Alice in Chains' concert in Seattle on October 8, 2010, aged 18.|$|E

The idea is really great and the gameplay holds glimmers of what could have been. Sadly, it falls a quite a bit short of perfect. The lack of character and sorry graphics slap the game down at the surface and some interface and gameplay ideas wound the title a little deeper. It still may {{be of interest to}} some gamers that have read the book or really have a thing for insects, but don't say I didn't warn you." ...|$|R
5000|$|Christopher Troilo from Avault {{gave the}} game three stars out of five, stating that [...] "If you require {{something}} {{with a little more}} depth <b>and</b> thought, <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>think</b> you should give it a try, but that’s probably all you’ll need to satisfy your curiosity." [...] Kieron Gillen from Eurogamer gave it a score of 7 out of 10, complimenting the graphic style as [...] "hyperactive amateurish-yet-charming" [...] and stating that it was [...] "a run-and-gun that chooses to step back from the difficulty cliff and just show all the gleeful nonsense its managed to think up." [...] He, as well as Troilo, compared the game with Contra.|$|R

2500|$|In 2010, a Polish {{language}} monograph titled Kapuściński Non-Fiction {{written by}} Artur Domosławski {{was published in}} Warsaw.

60|$|I {{must not}} fail to own the great {{pleasure}} that I have had {{in some of the}} stories of Auerbach. It is true that I have never cared greatly for 'On the Heights,' which in its dealing with royalties seems too far aloof from the ordinary human life, and which on the moral side finally fades out into a German mistiness. But I speak of it with the imperfect knowledge of one who was never able to read it quite through, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> have really no right to speak of it. The book of his that pleased me most was 'Edelweiss,' which, though the story was somewhat too catastrophical, seemed to me admirably good <b>and</b> true. <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>think</b> it very delicately done, and with a deep insight; but there is something in all Auerbach's work which in the retrospect affects me as if it dealt with pigmies.|$|R

60|$|We {{drove back}} to the office with some concern on my part at the {{prospect}} of so large a case. Sunning himself on the board steps, I saw for the first time Mr. Farquhar Fenelon Cooke. He was dressed out in broad gaiters and bright tweeds, like an English tourist, and his face might have belonged to Dagon, idol of the Philistines. A silver snaffle on a heavy leather watch guard which connected the pockets of his corduroy waistcoat, together with a huge gold stirrup in his Ascot tie, sufficiently proclaimed his tastes. But I found myself continually returning to the countenance, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>think</b> I could have modelled a better face out of putty. The mouth was rather small, thick-tipped, and put in at an odd angle; the brown eyes were large, and from their habit of looking up at one lent to the round face an incongruous solemnity. But withal there was a perceptible acumen about the man which was puzzling in the extreme.|$|E

5000|$|Torres is {{best known}} for {{starting}} the last game of the 1993 season for the Giants, when he gave up three runs over 3⅓ innings to the arch-rival Los Angeles Dodgers. The Giants, winners of 103 games that season, finished in second place behind the 104-win Atlanta Braves, at that time in the National League West division. Though he was then in his first month as a Major Leaguer, some Giants fans blamed Torres for ruining a promising season and apparently never forgave him; those fans continued to heckle him when he returned to San Francisco as an opposing player. Said Torres: [...] "They come to the park and they pay my salary, so {{they have the right to}} heckle me. If that's going to make them feel better and get over what happened in 1993, OK. But it's time to move on.... I don't think I was treated fairly by some of my teammates. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>still</b> don't <b>think</b> I'm being treated fairly by the fans." ...|$|R
60|$|From a child I {{was fond}} of reading, and all the little money that came into my hands was ever laid out in books. Pleased with the Pilgrim's Progress, my first {{collection}} was of John Bunyan's works in separate little volumes. I afterward sold them to enable me to buy R. Burton's Historical Collections; they were small chapmen's books, and cheap, 40 or 50 in all. My father's little library consisted chiefly of books in polemic divinity, most of which I read, and have since often regretted that, {{at a time when}} I had such a thirst for knowledge, more proper books had not fallen in my way since it was now resolved I should not be a clergyman. Plutarch's Lives there was in which I read abundantly, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>think</b> that time spent to great advantage. There was also a book of De Foe's, called an Essay on Projects, and another of Dr. Mather's, called Essays to do Good, which perhaps gave me a turn of thinking that had an influence on some of the principal future events of my life.|$|E
60|$|I {{have been}} up many mountains, and have climbed some that were perhaps {{somewhat}} dangerous in their ascent. In climbing the Owl's Head there is no danger. One is closed in by thick trees the whole way. But I doubt if I ever went up a steeper ascent. It was very hard work, but we were not beaten. We reached the top, and there sitting down, thoroughly enjoyed our victory. It was then half- past five o'clock, {{and the sun was}} not yet absolutely sinking. It did not seem to give us any warning that we should especially require its aid, and, as the prospect below us was very lovely, we remained there for a quarter of an hour. The ascent of the Owl's Head is certainly a thing to do, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>think,</b> in spite of our following misfortune, that it is a thing to do late in the afternoon. The view down upon the lakes and the forests around, and on the wooded hills below, is wonderfully lovely. I never was on a mountain which gave me a more perfect command of all the country round. But as we arose to descend we saw a little cloud coming toward us from over Newport.|$|E
6000|$|My {{father was}} methodical in everything. At {{the very same}} time of the day, in the same apartment, and with the same tone and manner which he had {{employed}} an exact month before, he recapitulated the proposal he had made for taking me into partnership, and assigning me a department in the counting-house, and requested to have my final decision. I {{thought at the time}} there was something unkind in this; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>think</b> that my father's conduct was injudicious. A more conciliatory treatment would, in all probability, have gained his purpose. As it was, I stood fast, and, as respectfully as I could, declined the proposal he made to me. Perhaps--for who can judge of their own heart?--I felt it unmanly to yield on the first summons, and expected farther solicitation, as at least a pretext for changing my mind. If so, I was disappointed; for my father turned coolly to Owen, and only said, [...] "You see it is as I told you.--Well, Frank" [...] (addressing me), [...] "you are nearly of age, and as well qualified to judge of what will constitute your own happiness as you ever are like to be; therefore, I say no more. But as I am not bound to give in to your plans, any more than you are compelled to submit to mine, may I ask to know if you have formed any which depend on my assistance?" ...|$|E

[...] The band later released an alternately arranged [...] "Temple Bar Remix" [...] as the single, the version of the song they most prefer. [...] The band also has claimed they find the song difficult to perform in concert.

5000|$|Some {{have criticized}} Professor Siegel for being bullish {{on the stock}} market back in 2000. In a BusinessWeek {{interview}} in May 2000 when asked about the stock market, he replied:"Seven percent per year average real returns on stocks is what I find over nearly two centuries. I don't see persuasive reasons why it should be any different from that over the intermediate run. In the short run, it could be almost anything."That being said, Professor Siegel was spot on when he also said in the same interview:"I have voiced my concern about the technology sector, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> sometimes advise people to shade down from that sector relative to its percentage in the & Poor's 500-stock index. I really am concerned with these companies that have p-e ratios of 90, 100, <b>and</b> above. <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>think</b> stocks, as a diversified portfolio, are the best long-run investment. I will say that indexed bonds at 4% are an attractive hedge at the present time. To get a 4% real rate of return, although it's not as high as 6.5% to 7% that we talked about in stocks, as a guaranteed rate of return is certainly comforting against any inflation." ...|$|R
