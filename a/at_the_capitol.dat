Additionally, on two occasions—in 1817 and 1945—they were held at other locations in Washington, D.C..|$|R

5|$|Arriving <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>capitol,</b> I {{sprang from}} my horse, first unbuckling {{the stars and}} stripes, a large flag I had {{on the front of}} my saddle. With Captain Langdon, chief of artillery, I rushed up to the roof. Together we hoisted the first large flag over Richmond, and on the peak of the roof drank to its success.|$|E
5|$|Casino Royale had {{its world}} premiere in London's Odeon Leicester Square on 13 April 1967, {{breaking}} many opening {{records in the}} theatre's history. Its American premiere was held in New York on 28 April, <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Capitol</b> and Cinema I theatres. It opened two {{months prior to the}} fifth Bond film by Eon Productions, You Only Live Twice.|$|E
5|$|After {{nine days}} {{quartered}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>capitol,</b> {{the men of}} the 11th New York were moved to the heights near the Insane Asylum to Camp Lincoln. This move would allow for easy transport across the Potomac and into Virginia when necessary. While just five miles (8km) from the capitol, the standard of living the men were used to had changed dramatically, as their usual foodstuffs were replaced with beef steak, dry bread, and coffee. Ellsworth wrote to his fiance that they had not had butter in a week.|$|E

5|$|Officer Jacob Joseph Chestnut (April 28, 1940 – July 24, 1998), was {{the first}} African American to lie in honor <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Capitol.</b> Chestnut is buried in Arlington National Cemetery. His funeral {{included}} a speech by President Bill Clinton and a fly-over by military jets in a missing man formation. A United States Post Office located in Fort Washington, Maryland has been renamed in their honor.|$|E
5|$|Katniss and Peeta {{are taken}} to the Capitol. In the {{few days before the}} Games start, they are advised and {{supported}} by a team consisting of their drunken mentor, Haymitch Abernathy, the sole living District 12 victor of the Hunger Games; Effie Trinket; and two fashion stylists and three prep workers who help each tribute look his or her best. Katniss's stylist, Cinna, is the only person <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Capitol</b> she considers a friend. They are also introduced to the general public, given some training, and evaluated by the Gamemakers. Katniss and, to a lesser extent, Peeta set themselves apart from the other tributes. Rue, the petite 12-year-old girl tribute from District 11, takes to following them around.|$|E
5|$|On January 7, 1929, The Capitol Theatre, a major Jasper Avenue {{competitor}} to the Princess, {{closed for}} renovations promising {{a change that}} “will please every theatre-goer in Edmonton”. Almost three months later on March 27, the theatre reopened with dual Movietone and Vitaphone sound systems. The availability of electronically indexed articles from the Edmonton Journal has caused the proliferation of a research error in several local histories. These histories claim that the first talkie screened in Edmonton was The Canary Murder Case, {{and that it was}} screened at the Princess. In fact, the first talkie in Edmonton was Mother Knows Best, screened <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Capitol.</b>|$|E

5|$|There {{were five}} total debates during the election, {{three of which}} were {{televised}}. The televised U.S. Senate Debates, were hosted by WMUR-TV, NECN, and NH1 News. The WMUR Debate was moderated by George Stephanopoulos of ABC and Josh McElveen of WMUR-TV and was held at Saint Anselm College in Goffstown. The NH1 News Debate was moderated by Wolf Blitzer of CNN and Paul Steinhauser of NH1 and {{was held at the}} NH1 Media Center in Concord. The NECN Debate was moderated by Chuck Todd of NBC and was held <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Capitol</b> Center for the Arts in Concord.|$|E
5|$|Upon its release, Gone {{with the}} Wind broke {{attendance}} records everywhere. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>Capitol</b> Theatre in New York alone, it was averaging eleven thousand admissions {{per day in}} late December, and within four years of its release had sold an estimated sixty million tickets across the United States—sales equivalent to just under half the population at the time. It repeated its success overseas, and was a sensational hit during the Blitz in London, opening in April 1940 and playing for four years. By the time MGM withdrew it from circulation {{at the end of}} 1943 its worldwide distribution had returned a gross rental (the studio's share of the box office gross) of $32 million, making it the most profitable film ever made up to that point.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{his public}} nonchalance, Seward was devastated by his {{convention}} loss, as were {{many of his}} supporters. The New Yorker was the best-known and most popular Republican, and his defeat shocked many in the North, who felt that Lincoln had been nominated through chicanery. Although Seward sent a letter stating Weed was not to blame, Seward's political manager took the defeat hard. Seward was initially inclined to retire from public life, but received many letters from supporters: distrustful of Lincoln, they urged Seward to remain involved in politics. On his way to Washington to return to Senate duties, he stopped in Albany to confer with Weed, {{who had gone to}} Lincoln's home in Springfield, Illinois to meet with the candidate, and had been very impressed at Lincoln's political understanding. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>Capitol,</b> Seward received sympathy even from sectional foes such as Jefferson Davis.|$|E

5|$|McCreary {{was not as}} {{successful}} in securing reforms during the 1914 legislative session. He advocated a comprehensive workmen's compensation law, but the law that was passed in the 1914 General Assembly was later declared unconstitutional. He also recommended a requirement for full disclosure of campaign contributions and expenditures, {{but the majority of}} legislators in the House of Representatives voted to send it back to the Suffrage and Elections Committee, from whence it was never recalled. Although they did not pass a law regulating lobbying <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>capitol</b> – a law that McCreary supported – legislators showed responsiveness to McCreary's desire for this reform by putting stricter regulations on who could be in the legislative chambers while the legislature was in session. Some reforms were made in the area of education. The school year was lengthened, school attendance for children was mandated, and the legislature created a Text Book Commission to assist local school boards in adopting textbooks. Public schools expenditures were increased by 25 percent.|$|E
5|$|The Capitol {{has also}} been witness to murder and death. Rep. William P. Taulbee had been a congressman from Kentucky from 1884 to 1888. Charles E. Kincaid, a {{journalist}} for The Louisville Times, had accused Taulbee of adultery and involvement in a Patent Office scandal, which had ruined Taulbee's political career. On February 28, 1890, the ex-congressman and the reporter ran into {{one another in the}} Capitol, and Taulbee assaulted and embarrassed Kincaid by tweaking the much smaller man's nose. Kincaid ran home, grabbed a pistol, and, when he encountered Taulbee on a marble staircase leading from the House chamber down to the dining room, shot him in the face just below Taulbee's left eye. Taulbee died two weeks later, and Kincaid was acquitted after claiming self-defense. Journalists and others claim that whenever a reporter slips on these steps, Taulbee's ghost briefly appears. Former President and then-Rep. John Quincy Adams suffered a stroke at his desk in the House chamber on February 21, 1848, and was taken into the Speaker's Room. His physical condition was too precarious to permit him to be moved, and he died <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Capitol</b> two days later. Many people claim to have heard Adams' ghost denouncing slavery late at night in National Statuary Hall, and one Congressional staff member claims that by standing in the spot where Adams' desk once stood a person can still hear the former president's ghostly whisper. James A. Garfield {{was a member of the}} House from 1863 to 1881 before assuming the Presidency in March 1881. Garfield was shot by Charles J. Guiteau, a disgruntled office seeker, on July 2, 1881, at 9:30a.m. as he walked through the Sixth Street Station of the Baltimore and Potomac Railroad in Washington, D.C. Garfield died of heart failure brought about by blood poisoning (itself caused by poor medical care) on September 19, 1881, while recuperating at a beach house near Long Branch, New Jersey. Witnesses have seen Garfield's specter walking solemnly through the halls of Congress.|$|E
