5000|$|Many US banks since 2000 and 2009 had a {{contractual}} {{default rate}} (in the U.S., 2005, ranging from 10% to 36%), which is typically {{much higher than}} the regular APR. The rate took effect automatically if any of the listed conditions occur, which can include the following: one or two late payments, any <b>amount</b> <b>overdue</b> beyond the due date or one more cycle, any returned payment (such as an NSF check), any charging over the credit limit (sometimes including the bank's own fees), and - in some cases - any reduction of credit rating or default with another lender, at the discretion of the bank. In effect, the cardholder is agreeing to pay the default rate on the balance owed unless all the listed events can be guaranteed not to happen. A single late payment, or even a non-reconciled mistake on any account, could result in charges of hundreds or thousands of dollars {{over the life of the}} loan. These high effective fees create a great incentive for cardholders to keep track of all their credit card and checking account balances (from which credit card payments are made) and for keeping wide margins (extra money or money available). However, the current lack of provable [...] "account balance ownership" [...] in most credit card and checking account designs (studied between 1990 and 2005) make these kinds of [...] "penalty fees" [...] a complex problem, indeed. New US statutes passed in 2009 limit the use of default rates by allowing an increase in rate on purchases already made to accounts that have been over 60 days late.|$|E

Since national tax (국세) and local tax (지방세) take a higher priority than the tenants, they may lose some or all of their deposit, depending on how much their landlords owe the government.|$|R

Based on the comparative analysis conducted by the University Library on the borrowing privileges of selected universities and colleges in Metro Manila, DLSU lends the most number of books and has the longest loan period (the same with Ateneo de Manila University (ADMU) and University of the Philippines-Diliman (UP-D)), which explains why it also charges a higher <b>amount</b> of <b>overdue</b> fine. Although ADMU and UP-D have the same loan period with DLSU, their borrowing limit which is both 5, is way beyond that of DLSU. From among the selected universities, it is the Emilio Aguinaldo College (EAC) that imposes the same overdue fine with DLSU. However, the borrowing limit of EAC which is only 2 as well as its loan period which is 1 day is incomparable to DLSU. The overdue fines of Arellan...|$|R

40|$|The local {{government}} sphere {{is comprised of}} municipalities whose functions include the provision of consumer services. A substantial portion of municipal revenue, which is also used for service provision, is derived from rates and service charges. Through the billing process, the municipality stipulates the amount due to be paid by each account holder. In the case of rates and consumer tariffs, this usually occurs on a monthly basis. Towards the end of 2002, overdue rates and service charges in the Nelson Mandela Metropolitan Municipality amounted to over R 800 million. In spite of various attempts undertaken by the municipality to collect <b>overdue</b> <b>amounts,</b> some residents are struggling to pay. Various reasons have been advanced for this scenario.

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the level of}} efficiency of the indirect taxes administration system. The level of efficiency was analysed through the trends of the cost-revenue ratio; and revenue detected-collected ratio. Further investigation was carried out {{to see whether the}} Malaysian indirect tax system has all the characteristics of a good tax system as perceived by the taxpayers based on the tenets proposed by the Institute Chartered Accountants of England and Wales (ICAEW). The result of the study revealed that the Malaysian Customs Department has been collecting less indirect taxes revenue each year as compared to the costs incurred in the process of acquiring the revenue. An anaysis on the ratio of total arrears to total revenue collected also indicated that uncollected indirect tax revenues is on the increasing trend. Is shows that the rate of increase in the <b>amount</b> of <b>overdue</b> taxes is more than the amount of revenue collected each year. It was also revealed that on the average,only 60 % of the revenue loss detected could be recovered for the period 1995 to 2001. The trend of collection has been rather stable even though the revenue detected has increased. Regarding the characteristics of a good tax system,based on the respondents surveyed, there are mixed responses for each characteristic as perceived by the taxpayers. The findings revealed that there is an existence of a good legislation under the tax system and the tax system is constant and regularly reviewed. However, they had disagreed that the present system is certain and simple; proper consultation has been made before any new legislation is issued; and that the overall system is fair. From all the characteristics suggested, the taxpayers ranked "statutory" as the highest and "proper consultation" as the lowest...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{builds a}} model of a {{sovereign}} borrower that has access to credit from private sector creditors and an IFI. Private sector creditors and the IFI offer different debt contracts that are modelled based on the institutional frameworks of these two types of debt. We analyze the decisions of a sovereign on how to allocate its borrowing needs between these two types of creditors, and when to default on its debt to the private sector creditor. The numerical analysis shows that, consistent with the data; the model predicts countercyclical IFI debt along with procyclical commercial debt flows, also matching other features of the data such as frequency of IFI borrowing and mean IFI debt stock.

40|$|The {{mismatch}} between credit repayments and income seasonality poses {{a challenge for}} microfinance institutions (MFIs) working in developing countries. For instance, in northern Bangladesh, income and consumption downfalls during the lean season after the transplanting of major paddy crops are {{a serious threat to}} a household's economy. Poor landless agricultural wage laborers suffer the most owing to this seasonality as they face difficulties in smoothing their consumption. However, in designing microcredit products, MFIs do not usually provide flexibility or seasonal adjustment during the lean season. This is mainly because MFIs are afraid that such flexibility might break the repayment discipline of borrowers, resulting in higher default rates. We thus conducted a randomized controlled trial in 2011 - 12 in northern Bangladesh to empirically test whether seasonality-adjusted flexible microcredit leads to an increase in repayment problems for MFIs as well as whether it can increase and stabilize consumption of borrower households. Our results suggest no statistically discernible difference among the treatment arms in case of default, <b>overdue</b> <b>amount,</b> or repayment frequency. On the other hand, we find no positive impact of repayment flexibility on immediate food consumption during the period of seasonality, except for in-kind full moratorium treatment group. After a year of initial intervention, however, we see positive changes in food intake during the lean season. Thus, our preliminary results are in favor of seasonality-adjusted flexible microcredit...|$|R
