5|$|After being {{released}} by FC Bayern Munich Ngwat-Mahop {{ended up as}} a trialist in Red Bull Salzburg. He managed to persuade FC Red Bull Salzburg's manager Giovanni Trapattoni of his football skills and he signed a two-year contract with the Austrian club. After the signing of his contract {{he was sent to}} Red Bull Salzburg Juniors to get playing time. There he made his debut in a 5–1 away defeat by FK Austria Wien II. In his second match with Red Bull Salzburg Juniors he handed two assists, to his teammates Vujic and Kitzbichler, to help them score the first and second goal of their team in a 2–2 home draw with SC-ESV Parndorf. He scored his first goal for his team in an 1–3 away win against DSV Leoben in the 70th minute after an assist by Öbster. In his next match Ngwat-Mahop scored once, in a 2–1 home win against Austria Lustenau. On 26 October, he netted a goal in the 80th minute of a 2–0 home win against Bad Aussee, to put the game beyond <b>any</b> <b>doubt.</b> <b>In</b> the next match against SK Schwadorf he proved himself a prolific forward by scoring the opening goal of the match, in the first minute, and serving the second to his teammate David Witteveen. Red Bull Salzburg Juniors finally lost the game by a 3–2 scoreline. Ngwat-Mahop continued scoring for his team in 2–1 home win against FK Austria Wien II, by scoring the opening goal of the match. Ngwat-Mahop featured in 13 matches and scored five goals for Red Bull Salzburg Juniors until the winter break. That resulted in him being called to play with FC Red Bull Salzburg's first team. After playing in some friendly matches with Red Bull Salzburg during the winter break, he made his league debut for the club on 23 February 2008, in a 3–1 away defeat from Austria Wien, as he replaced Alexander Zickler in the 52nd minute. Ngwat-Mahop continued to feature regularly in Red Bull Salzburg's playing squad {{until the end of the}} season, although mostly as a substitute. He also managed to score his first goal with Red Bull Salzburg in a 3–0 home win against Sturm Graz. At the end of the season he totalled one goal in 12 appearances. In April 2008, Ngwat-Mahop signed a contract extension with Red Bull Salzburg until the summer of 2011.|$|E

25|$|Bradman {{had only}} made 28, {{when he played}} Bill Voce into the slips. Jack Ikin caught the ball and threw it {{high in the air}} in joy. He had caught the great Bradman, and Australia, he thought, were three down for under a hundred on a good wicket. That was how it looked to Ikin, to some of the other English players and some of the crowd, and that was how it looked to me sitting {{watching}} from the dressing room. Bradman, however, thought it was a bump ball and he stayed, as he was fully entitled to do if there was <b>any</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>in</b> his mind... the umpire gave him not out and he went on to make 187 of Australia's total of 645.|$|E

500|$|Wayne Kramer, a guitarist for MC5, {{suggested}} that Hendrix {{had been set}} up as part of a wide-scale crackdown on rock musicians: [...] "I don't have <b>any</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>in</b> my mind that the right-wing government forces were behind all of that... There was an effort, a movement, to stop this threat that rock and roll represented." [...] Hendrix was not the only prominent rock musician who found himself in legal trouble during May 1969. On May 16, the US embassy in London revoked John Lennon's visa in response to his 1968 drug conviction, describing him as [...] "an inadmissible immigrant". That same day, Jefferson Airplane bassist Jack Casady was arrested for possession of marijuana, and on May 28, Mick Jagger and Marianne Faithfull were arrested at their London home for marijuana possession.|$|E
500|$|Another {{question}} that arose was whether Lody's trial {{should be held}} in public or in camera. Captain Reginald Drake, [...] head of counter-espionage, wanted Lody to be tried secretly {{so that he could}} implement [...] "an ingenious method for conveying false information to the enemy which depended on their not knowing which of their agents had been caught." [...] He was overruled, as the British Government believed that it would be more advantageous to publicise the threat of German spies to remove <b>any</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>in</b> the public mind that German espionage posed a serious threat in the UK. It was hoped that this would also generate support for the intelligence and censorship apparatus that was rapidly taking shape and would deter possible imitators. In the event, Lody's was the only spy trial in either World War held in public in the UK. In pursuing this policy the Government sacrificed the chance to [...] "turn" [...] captured spies and turn them into assets for the British intelligence services. It was an opportunity that was taken in the Second World War when the highly successful Double-Cross System was implemented.|$|E

[...] " [...] and panting duet partner Drake steam the {{recording}} studio windows as he raps a helpless play-by-play". Bill Lamb from About.com gave the song a positive review, saying that [...] "There it is, the chorus opens the track with [...] "Oh na na...what's my name?" [...] and the hook is firmly implanted. It's not long before Drake's added on rap kicks in with clever, sexy and romantic rhyming. Then the dreamy drum machine rhythms and Rihanna's vocals kick in again. This is a hit... "What's My Name?" [...] is a good addition to that romantic evening playlist." [...] Jocelyn Vena from MTV praised the [...] "song's chorus" [...] and [...] "Drake's verse". Molly Lambert of Pitchfork Media praised Rihanna's performance saying that [...] "On 'What's My Name', Rihanna doesn't have {{to tell us how}} desirable she is – it is a given. There is never <b>any</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>in</b> her delivery that Rihanna really might as well be the only girl in the world".|$|E

5000|$|Another {{example in}} the Islamic tradition, as {{compiled}} in the tome Jami' of at-Tirmidhi, quotes Muhammad as saying, [...] "Avoid legal punishments as far as possible, {{and if there are}} <b>any</b> <b>doubts</b> <b>in</b> the case then use them, for it is better for a judge to err towards leniency than towards punishment". Another similar expression reads, [...] "Invoke doubtfulness in evidence during prosecution to avoid legal punishments".|$|R
500|$|The writers {{initially}} intended that Sam {{would save}} Dean from Hell, possibly even before [...] "No Rest for the Wicked", by {{giving in to}} his demonic powers and becoming [...] "this fully operational dark force" [...] who would then want to go after Lilith. The battle would have been [...] "much more climactic", with the Winchesters [...] "going to war to save Dean's life". By {{the middle of the}} season, however, the writers realized the costs associated with depicting such an engagement and scaled it down. To make matters worse, the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike prevented them from fleshing out Sam's evolving abilities throughout the season, and his entire story arc was pushed back into the fourth season. With Sam's storyline no longer dovetailing with Dean's, the writers [...] " [...] <b>any</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>in</b> [...] minds" [...] to send Dean to Hell. Kripke disliked that the second-season finale [...] "just ended", and he felt that this episode provided a cliffhanger ending that had people [...] "biting their nails". Although the viewers' expectations that Dean would be saved was [...] "reason enough", his imprisonment in Hell also served as a [...] "turning point" [...] for both the character and the series. Kripke commented, [...] "You need huge moves to happen that can cause radical shifts in the characters, that set them off in a new direction. So what happens to Dean in Hell and how Dean gets out become primary concerns of season four." ...|$|E

2500|$|At the time, Truscott was shocked, writing later [...] "...I was dumbfounded. This {{was no time}} {{to drive}} to the north-west where the enemy was still strong; we should pour our maximum power into the Valmontone Gap to insure the {{destruction}} of the retreating German Army. I would not comply with the order without first talking to General Clark in person. ... he was not on the beachhead and could not be reached even by radio.... such was the order that turned the main effort of the beachhead forces from the Valmontone Gap and prevented destruction of the German Tenth Army. On the 26th the order was put into effect." [...] He went on to write [...] "There has never been <b>any</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>in</b> my mind that had General Clark held loyally to General Alexander's instructions, had he not changed the direction of my attack to the north-west on May26, the strategic objectives of Anzio would have been accomplished in full.

2500|$|The {{success of}} the {{uprising}} was short-lived, however. Although the insurrection went further than the Cheka had anticipated, {{the reaction of the}} Soviet authorities was prompt. Stalin dissipated <b>any</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>in</b> Moscow of the significance of the disorders in Georgia by the one word: [...] "Kronstadt", referring to the Kronstadt rebellion, a large scale though unsuccessful mutiny by Soviet sailors in 1921. Additional Red Army troops under the overall command of Semyon Pugachev were promptly sent in and Georgia's coastline was blockaded to prevent a landing of Georgian émigré groups. Detachments of the Red Army and Cheka attacked the first insurgent towns in western Georgia—Chiatura, Senaki and Abasha—as early as 29 August and managed to force the rebels into forests and mountains by 30 August. The Red Army forces employed artillery and aviation to fight the guerrillas who still continued to offer resistance, especially in the province of Guria, a home region to many Georgian Social Democratic (Menshevik) Party leaders and thus overwhelmingly disloyal to the Bolshevik rule. Tiflis, Batumi and some larger towns, where the Bolsheviks enjoyed more authority, remained quiet as did Abkhazia and most of the territories compactly settled by ethnic minorities.|$|E
