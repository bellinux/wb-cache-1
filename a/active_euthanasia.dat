40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the present criminal law position {{with respect to}} medically administered <b>active</b> voluntary <b>euthanasia</b> in Australia. Under existing criminal law principles, whilst there is some scope for passive <b>euthanasia,</b> <b>active</b> volunta. rY <b>euthanasia</b> is treated as murder and no account is taken of the special circumstances existing in such cases. Notwithstanding this prohibition, {{there is evidence that}} Australian doctors are involved in the practice of <b>active</b> voluntary <b>euthanasia.</b> However, police and prosectors appear reluctant to intervene in this area of medical practice, and judging from the experience in other jurisdictions, there is every likelihood that if a doctor were prosecuted in Australia for having administered <b>active</b> voluntary <b>euthanasia,</b> the doctor would escape the full rigours of the criminal law. Against this background, this thesis seeks to highlight the problems which exist {{as a result of the}} marked discrepancies between law and practice in this area. Attention is also drawn to the law's differential treatment of <b>active</b> and passive <b>euthanasia</b> and the difficulties and anomalies which arise from the legal characterisation of a number of other medical practices which bear some similarity to <b>active</b> voluntary <b>euthanasia</b> such as the turning off of artificial life-support and the administration of pain-relieving drugs which are known to be likely to hasten the patient's death. The thesis argues that <b>active</b> voluntary <b>euthanasia</b> should not be subject to a blanket criminal law prohibition. This argument is based on a number of factors including the principle of self-determination, current legal and medical practice, changing community attitudes, and jurisprudential arguments regarding the proper role of the criminal law. The conclusion of this thesis is that the law with regard to <b>active</b> voluntary <b>euthanasia</b> in Australia should be reformed by the introduction of legislation creating· a very limited exception to the homicide laws that would confer on doctors an immunity from liability, provided <b>active</b> voluntary <b>euthanasia</b> is performed in accordance with strict criteria and safeguards. It is argued that the practice of <b>active</b> voluntary <b>euthanasia</b> by doctors in the Netherlands provides a useful guide to law reform in Australia...|$|R
40|$|The {{distinction}} between 'kill' and 'help to die' is argued by analogy with the {{distinction between}} 'rape' and 'make love to'. The difference is {{the consent of the}} receiver of the act, therefore 'kill' is the wrong word for an act of <b>active</b> voluntary <b>euthanasia.</b> The argument that doctors must not be allowed by law to perform <b>active</b> voluntary <b>euthanasia</b> because this would recognise an infringement of the sanctity of life ('the red light principle') is countered by comparing such doctors with the drivers of emergency vehicles, who are allowed to drive through red lights...|$|R
25|$|There is {{much debate}} {{on the topic of}} {{euthanasia}} in Judaic theology, ethics, and general opinion (especially in Israel and the United States).

25|$|Voluntary, non-voluntary and {{involuntary}} types can {{be further}} divided into passive or active variants. Passive euthanasia entails the withholding treatment necessary for the continuance of life. <b>Active</b> <b>euthanasia</b> entails the use of lethal substances or forces, (such as administering a lethal injection), and is the more controversial. While some authors consider these terms to be misleading and unhelpful, they are nonetheless commonly used. In some cases, such as the administration of increasingly necessary, but toxic doses of painkillers, there is a debate {{whether or not to}} regard the practice as active or passive.|$|E
25|$|Historically, the {{euthanasia}} {{debate has}} {{tended to focus on}} a number of key concerns. According to euthanasia opponent Ezekiel Emanuel, proponents of euthanasia have presented four main arguments: a) that {{people have a right to}} self-determination, and thus should be allowed to choose their own fate; b) assisting a subject to die might be a better choice than requiring that they continue to suffer; c) the distinction between passive euthanasia, which is often permitted, and <b>active</b> <b>euthanasia,</b> which is not substantive (or that the underlying principle–the doctrine of double effect–is unreasonable or unsound); and d) permitting euthanasia will not necessarily lead to unacceptable consequences. Pro-euthanasia activists often point to countries like the Netherlands and Belgium, and states like Oregon, where euthanasia has been legalized, to argue that it is mostly unproblematic.|$|E
40|$|Euthanasia and {{criminal}} law If {{we wish to}} speak about euthanasia, {{it is necessary to}} say, what really mean this term. The noun "euthanasia" came from Greek language and it is composed from two Greek nouns, "eu" and "thanatos". The noun "eu" mean good and the noun "thanatos" mean dead. Euthanasia can be also translated as a good dead. View of euthanasia in the history was different. In antiquity people look at euthanasia otherwise than Christian society. About euthanasia spoke Nazis too, but the really term euthanasia is different from horrible Nazi policy. Nowadays is term euthanasia use for speaking about put to death patients in the finally stadium of their incurable illnesses. Euthanasia can be divided into three situations. Accordingly we speak about three kinds of <b>euthanasia,</b> passive <b>euthanasia,</b> <b>active</b> direct <b>euthanasia</b> and <b>active</b> indirect <b>euthanasia.</b> About passive euthanasia we speak in situations, when incurable ill patient refused medical help and owing to he died. Patient's dead come naturally without some assistance from the part of medical staff. In majority of states is passive euthanasia respected and it is practise in accordance with laws. As <b>active</b> indirect <b>euthanasia</b> is indicated situation, when patient died because of rise dose of medicaments. It is usual, that patients use some [...] ...|$|R

40|$|A {{comparison}} of the views of geriatric medicine physicians and intensive care physicians in the United Kingdom on the topics of <b>active</b> voluntary <b>euthanasia</b> and physician-assisted suicide revealed rather different attitudes. Eighty percent of geriatricians, but only 52 % of intensive care physicians, considered <b>active</b> voluntary <b>euthanasia</b> as never justified ethically. Gender and age did not play a major part in attitudinal differences of the respondents. If the variability of attitudes of these two medical specialties are anywhere near illustrative of other physicians in the United Kingdom, {{it would be difficult}} to formulate and implement laws and policies concerning euthanasia and assisted suicide. In addition, ample safeguards would be required to receive support from physicians regarding legalization...|$|R

40|$|This chapter {{focuses on}} the German {{criminal}} law in regard to euthanasia. Referring to the traditional classification, <b>active</b> indirect <b>euthanasia,</b> passive euthanasia, and assistance in suicide are legal in Germany, whereas <b>active</b> direct <b>euthanasia</b> is a crime. As criminal law is to be interpreted {{in the light of}} the Constitution, the most relevant Constitutional principles such as human dignity, the right to life and physical integrity, and the right to self-determination are presented. This legal overview is complemented by some of the currently most controversial issues within the topic. These include the impact of the new German law on living wills on the criminal law on euthanasia. Among other relevant debates, the issue of the criminalization of commercial assistance in suicide is discussed. The chapter concludes that despite the difficulties in the practical differentiation, the law on euthanasia is rather clear in Germany. The problem that remains, however, is the legal insecurity still largely found among the population and also among physicians and even lawyers. This insecurity leads to a frequent circulation of unqualified warnings, for one of a discussion concerning the legalization of <b>active</b> direct <b>euthanasia,</b> which currently is not at all being considered. ...|$|R

40|$|When I first {{wrote about}} this subject 36 years ago, the chance that any state would legalize {{assisted}} suicide or <b>active</b> voluntary <b>euthanasia</b> seemed minuscule. The possibility that any court would find these activities protected by the Due Process Clause seemed so remote as to be almost inconceivable. Not anymore. Before this decade ends, at least several states probably will decriminalize assisted suicide and/or <b>active</b> voluntary <b>euthanasia.</b> [Editor 2 ̆ 7 s note: In November, Oregon became {{the first state to}} legalize physician-assisted suicide, allowing doctors to prescribe lethal medication for competent, terminally ill adults who request it. ] A distinct possibility also exists that the U.
