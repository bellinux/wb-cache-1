5|$|Adam, a photographer, awakens in {{a bathtub}} {{in a large}} {{dilapidated}} bathroom, and finds himself chained at the ankle to a pipe. Lawrence Gordon, an oncologist, is similarly shackled across the room, and between them is a corpse holding a revolver and a microcassette recorder. Each man has a tape in his pocket, and Adam is able to retrieve the recorder. Adam's tape urges him to escape the bathroom, while Lawrence's tape tells him to kill Adam by six o'clock, or {{his wife and daughter}} will be killed and he will be left to die. Adam finds a bag containing two hacksaws inside a toilet tank; they attempt to cut through the chains, but Adam's saw breaks and he throws it <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> in frustration, revealing a hidden camera behind the mirror. Lawrence realizes that the hacksaws weren't meant for the chains, but for their feet and identifies their captor as the Jigsaw Killer, whom Lawrence knows of because he was a suspect five months before.|$|E
5|$|Alucard {{appears in}} , {{a chapter of}} the Lords of Shadow reboot series. It is {{revealed}} that this version of Alucard was originally Trevor Belmont, the son of Gabriel and Marie Belmont, conceived before Gabriel {{was turned into a}} vampire and became the dark lord Dracula. Trevor grew up not knowing of his true origin until the Brotherhood of Light reveals to him who his parents were. Believing that his father Gabriel murdered his mother in cold blood, he decides to pursue him in the hopes of destroying him and bringing peace to the land. After infiltrating the castle, Trevor successfully fights his way to the throne room, where he confronts Dracula without letting on that he is his son, or telling Dracula his name. Although Trevor puts up a valiant effort, in the end he is defeated and stabbed in the heart with his own Combat Cross. Dying and gazing <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mirror</b> of Fate he finally realizes the truth of what really happened to Gabriel and feels sorry for him, calling him his father. Dracula, confused, gazes <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> as well and learns who Trevor was all along. Remorseful and horrified for killing his own son who had been unknown to him the entire time, Dracula desperately tries to bring him back to life by giving him his blood, which seems to be in vain. Dracula mourns over his loss, and places Trevor in a coffin with the name Alucard, since he never learned his son's real name. Many years later Alucard awakens, with pale white skin, white hair, and glowing orange eyes. He meets up with Dracula and his own son, Simon. Alucard tries to finish what he started, angry that his father turned him into a vampire. Dracula asks Alucard to join him in remaking the world and destroying the brotherhood, but Alucard refuses. Dracula proceeds to attack Simon for being a Belmont, wishing to end the Belmont bloodline due to his hatred of his past life. Alucard and Simon manage to defeat Dracula, and part ways as Dracula's castle crumbles.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} a closeup shot of Katy's face, {{surrounded}} by alternating red and blue lights, as she mouths the song's lyrics. It then changes to a mechanics' shop, where two young men are seen sitting, looking to the ground. Shots of sparks then appear in the screen, which emerge from a car. Katy {{is sitting on the}} automobile's passenger seat, while looking to her love interest, who is repairing the car, seemingly worried. She is later seen being driven by her boyfriend's group in that car. Her boyfriend is seen lying on a bed, and looking <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror,</b> looking distantly. The car seen before finally arrives in a car parking lot where other cars are driving in circles. They exit their cars while others start driving again. The video's final scenes take place at the car parking lot, while the cars keep driving, with shots of women and other men sitting on the cars. The visual finally closes with a similar shot to that seen in the beginning, of Katy's face surrounded by lights, though now, her face is mixed with her love interest's.|$|E

40|$|For compact short-Rayleigh length free {{electron}} lasers (FELs), {{the area of}} the optical beam can be thousands of times greater <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirrors</b> than <b>at</b> <b>the</b> beam waist. A fixed numerical grid of sufficient resolution to represent <b>the</b> narrow mode <b>at</b> <b>the</b> waist and <b>the</b> broad mode <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirrors</b> would be prohibitively large. To accommodate this extreme change of scale with no loss of information, we employ a coordinate system that expands with the diffracting optical mode. The simulation using the new expanding coordinates has been validated by comparison to analytical cold-cavity theory, and is now used to simulate short-Rayleigh length FELs.

5|$|Inside {{their hotel}} room, Spears {{and her boyfriend}} start {{screaming}} at each other. When he tries to make amends and get close to her, she brushes off his attempts and walks away. Her boyfriend gets mad and then throws a vase at the wall while Spears goes into the bathroom, hurling something <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror.</b> She begins to fill the bathtub and remove her clothes. After this, the video includes intercut scenes of a close-up of Spears singing in a white shirt {{in front of a}} bright white light. As she lies in the bathtub, a red string, a custom associated with Kabbalah is seen in her wrist. She touches her head and looks at her hand, realizing she is bleeding from the wound. According to Jennifer Vineyard of MTV, the blood in her hand is stigmata. She loses consciousness in the bathtub and drowns. Shortly after, her boyfriend finds her and tries to resuscitate her. Meanwhile, it is revealed that in the close-up scenes Spears is actually inside a hospital hallway. The video continues with scenes of her being carried into an ambulance and surrounded by photographers, as well as scenes of her being resuscitated by doctors in a hospital bed. The ghost of Spears in a white shirt, watches herself in the bed and walks into the next room, where a baby girl is born. Spears is then seen running away from the camera into the light. The music video ends with her rising from under the water, resting her head and smiling, suggesting the whole scene of her death was a dream or a morbid fantasy.|$|E
25|$|The Times {{was first}} {{published}} on December 4, 1881, as the Los Angeles Daily Times {{under the direction of}} Nathan Cole Jr. and Thomas Gardiner. It was first printed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mirror</b> printing plant, owned by Jesse Yarnell and T.J. Caystile. Unable to pay the printing bill, Cole and Gardiner turned the paper over to the Mirror Company. In the meantime, S. J. Mathes had joined the firm, and it was at his insistence that the Times continued publication. In July 1882, Harrison Gray Otis moved from Santa Barbara to become the paper's editor. Otis made the Times a financial success.|$|E
25|$|For {{things that}} may be {{considered}} as two-dimensional objects (like text), front-back reversal cannot usually explain the observed reversal. In {{the same way that}} text {{on a piece of paper}} appears reversed if held up to a light and viewed from behind, text held facing a mirror will appear reversed, because the observer is behind the text. Another way to understand the reversals observed in images of objects that are effectively two-dimensional is that the inversion of left and right in a mirror is due to the way human beings turn their bodies. To turn from viewing the side of the object facing the mirror to view the reflection in the mirror requires the observer to look in the opposite direction. To look in another direction, human beings turn their heads about a vertical axis. This causes a left-right reversal in the image but not an up-down reversal. If a person instead turns by bending over and looking <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> image between his/her legs, up-down will appear reversed but not left-right. This sort of reversal is simply a change relative to the observer and not a change intrinsic to the image itself, as with a three-dimensional object.|$|E

500|$|At first, {{the journal}} {{articles}} available via ADS were scanned bitmaps created {{from the paper}} journals, but from 1995 onwards, the Astrophysical Journal began to publish an on-line edition, soon followed by the other main journals such as Astronomy and Astrophysics and the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society. [...] ADS provided links to these electronic editions from their first appearance. [...] Since about 1995, the number of ADS users has doubled roughly every two years. [...] ADS now has agreements with almost all astronomical journals, who supply abstracts. Scanned articles from {{as far back as}} the early 19th century are available via the service, which now contains over eight million documents. [...] The service is distributed worldwide, with twelve mirror sites in twelve countries on five continents, with the database synchronized by means of weekly updates using rsync, a mirroring utility which allows updates to only the portions of the database which have changed.

Jim Shelley, of the Daily Mirror, described Red or Black? as [...] "mess", and described the stunts as [...] "dull"; Kevin O'Sullivan, also <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mirror,</b> described the show as a [...] "sausage factory of sob stories"; while Ken Smith, of The Herald, described it as the [...] "dullest show of the week". After the fourth episode, Jan Moir of The Daily Mail reviewed the show, describing it as a [...] "spin of a wheel away from total disaster", and calling the appearances of Simon Cowell related music acts a [...] "blatant plugfest". Overall, Moir described the show [...] "overblown and immoral nonsense". Jonathan Liew, of The Daily Telegraph, requested that readers stopped watching the show, whilst describing it as [...] "so devoid of intellect that it actually sucks nearby intelligence into its vortex. This is, without exaggeration or embellishment, an abominably stupid television programme." [...] Readers of UKGameshows.com named it the worst new game show of 2011 in their [...] "Hall of shame" [...] poll.

2500|$|In 1935 Rothermere {{sold the}} paper to H. G. Bartholomew and Hugh Cudlipp. [...] With Cecil King (Rothermere's nephew) {{in charge of the}} paper's {{finances}} and Guy Bartholomew as editor, during the late 1930s the Mirror was transformed from a conservative, middle class newspaper into a left-wing paper for the working class. Partly on the advice of the American advertising agency J. Walter Thompson, the Mirror became the first British paper to adopt the appearance of the New York tabloids. The headlines became bigger, the stories shorter and the illustrations more abundant. By 1939, the publication was selling 1.4million copies a day. In 1937, Hugh McClelland introduced his wild Western comic strip Beelzebub Jones in the Daily Mirror. After taking over as cartoon chief <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mirror</b> in 1945, he dropped Beelzebub Jones and moved on to a variety of new strips.|$|E

[...] But when things came together you could see why Ant still inspires such dedication in the faithful. The likes of Ants Invasion, with its piercing, menacing lead-guitar line, and the sleazy, swaggering glam of Physical showed that there were enduring gems among the album tracks and B-sides, while hits such as Stand and Deliver, Antmusic (sweetly dedicated to Molly Meldrum) and Prince Charming reminded you what a deliciously odd pop star he truly was.".
