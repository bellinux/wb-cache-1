50|$|The {{terminology}} {{used to describe}} the prevention of smallpox can cause confusion. In 18th-century medical terminology, inoculation refers to smallpox inoculation. Confusion is caused by writers who interchange variolation and vaccination through either mistranslation or misinterpretation. The term variolation refers solely to inoculation with smallpox virus and is not interchangeable with vaccination. The latter term was first used in 1800 soon after Edward Jenner introduced smallpox vaccine derived from cowpox, an animal disease distinct from smallpox. The term variolation was then used from the 19th century to avoid confusion with vaccination. Most modern writers tend to refer to smallpox inoculation as variolation throughout without regard for chronology, as is used here. Further confusion was caused when, in 1891, Louis Pasteur honoured Jenner by widening the terms vaccine/vaccination to refer to the <b>artificial</b> induction of <b>immunity</b> against any infectious disease. Inoculation is used synonymously with injection in connection with the use of vaccines or other biopharmaceuticals, but has other meanings in e.g. laboratory work.|$|R

The general literature on the subject has been reviewed by the last named authors in their paper. More recently still we have carried out a test on four Macacus rhesus monkeys in which repeated intradermai injections of a highly potent virus replaced the injections of the weaker M. A. and Aycock strains. When the less potent strains are employed, immunization usually takes place without clinical manifestations, but when the highly potent strain is used, the result is different: [...] The monkeys of our test became ataxic, tremulous, and excited about a week after the third intracutaneous injection, or, in other works, presented the appearances manifested by ordinarily inoculated monkeys a day or two before the onset of paralysis. Of the four monkeys showing the preparalytic symptoms, three recovered completely [...] that is, the symptoms aborted-while the fourth became typically paralyzed and succumbed to experimental poliomyelitis, the spinal cord and medulla revealing characteristic lesions.

Resolution {{of the complete}} NITR gene cluster {{has led to the}} identification of eight previously undescribed families of NITRs and has revealed the presence of C-type lectins within the locus. A maximum haplotype of 36 NITR genes (138 gene sequences in total) can be grouped into 12 distinct families, including inhibitory and activating receptors. An extreme level of interindividual heterozygosity is reflected in allelic polymorphisms, haplotype variation, and family-specific isoform complexity. In addition, the exceptional diversity of NITR sequences among species suggests divergent evolution of this multigene family with a birth-and-death process of member genes. High-confidence modeling of Nitr V-domain structures reveals a significant shift in the spatial orientation of the Ig fold, in the region of highest interfamily variation, compared with Ig V domains.

2500|$|The terms inoculation, {{vaccination}} and immunization {{are often}} used synonymously to refer to <b>artificial</b> induction of <b>immunity</b> against various infectious diseases. This is supported by some dictionaries. However, there are some important historical and current differences. In English medicine, inoculation referred only {{to the practice of}} variolation until the very early 1800s. When Edward Jenner introduced smallpox vaccine in 1798, this was initially called cowpox inoculation or vaccine inoculation. Soon, to avoid confusion, smallpox inoculation continued to be referred to as variolation (from variola = smallpox) and cowpox inoculation was referred to as vaccination (from Jenner's use of variolae vaccinae = smallpox of the cow). Then, in 1891 Louis Pasteur proposed that the terms vaccine and vaccination should be extended to include the new protective procedures being developed. Immunization refers to the use of all vaccines but also extends to the use of antitoxin, which contains preformed antibody to e.g. diphtheria or tetanus exotoxins. Inoculation is now more or less synonymous in nontechnical usage with injection etc., and the question e.g. [...] "Have you had your flu injection/vaccination/inoculation/immunization?" [...] should not cause confusion. The focus is on what is being given and why, not the literal meaning of the technique used.|$|R
40|$|The {{intestinal}} microbiome (IM) or {{the community of}} commensal and pathogenic microbes that inhabit the intestinal tract of fish has long been of interest in aquaculture because of its hypothesized role in nutrient digestion and fish <b>immunity.</b> <b>Artificial</b> improvement to the IM of fish with pre- and probiotics {{has been shown to}} have benefits in some studies; however, the mechanisms behind these supplements are poorly understood {{because of a lack of}} knowledge on the basic structure of the IM of fish. The research described here aims to characterize the IM of the highly studied and commercially important Icatlurid catfish, channel catfish Ictalurus punctatus and blue catfish I. furcatus. In this study we evaluated differences between the homeostatic IM, across genotype (Objective 1) and developmental ontogeny (Objective 2), using high-throughput sequencing of 16 S rRNA gene amplicons. We compared the IM of four selected strains of blue catfish and three selected strains of channel catfish at 193 days post-hatch (DPH) in Objective 1 (n = 40); while the influence of developmental ontogeny was evaluated by observing the IM of a single family of channel catfish at 3, 65, 125, and 193 DPH Objective 2 (n = 20). The bacterial phyla Fusobacteria, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria were detected in all fish strains and developmental time points; however, at the genus level the abundances of different bacteria varied among experimental units, as well as being rather variable between individuals. At 3 DPH (n = 5) the IM of channel catfish sac-fry larvae showed the most variation between individuals; with bacteria from the genus Bradyrhizobium dominating the IM of two sac-fry (84 % and 88 %), and Flavobacterium, Lactobacillus, Comamonadaceae dominating the IM of the remaining three sac-fry analyzed (86 %, 99 %, and 97 % respectively). The dominant bacteria in the gut of all other fish analyzed (n = 55), was Cetobacterium somerae (mean ± SD, 41. 4 % ± 36 %), a commensal microbe that is known to produce vitamin B 12. Statistical differences in the abundance of three different bacteria within the order Clostridiales (P ≤ 0. 039) were detected in Objective 1, with more of these OTUs inhabiting the gut of channel catfish than that of blue catfish. Statistical differences in the abundance of Edwardsiella, a genus of bacteria known to cause disease in catfish, were detected across the two species of Ictalurid catfish in Objective 1 (P = 0. 038), and across developmental ontogeny in Objective 2 (P = 0. 021); however, these bacteria were detected at low abundance (0. 002 % - 0. 004 %). Comparisons of beta diversity showed significant differences between many strains of Ictalurids, with a highly significant difference between channel catfish and blue catfish (P = 0. 001); however, few differences were detected when comparing beta diversity across the four time points over the first 193 DPH in Objective 2, with only 3 DPH and 125 DPH showing significant differences (P = 0. 022). Overall these data suggest host-genotype, and to a lesser extent developmental ontogeny, influence the structure of the IM of Ictalurid catfish. As the first study to be conducted on the IM of these fish species, these results have performance implications on the culture of these commercially important catfish, while also enhancing our basic knowledge on the dynamics of the fish microbiome...|$|R

30|$|An {{advantage}} of <b>artificial</b> <b>immunity</b> over pattern recognition and other machine learning techniques are as follows: (1) an AIS’ aim {{is not to}} explicitly search for discriminating features between two-classes but to implicitly find those salient features through negative selection and (2) a robust, dynamic, and self-healing solution which can easily be applied in real-time environments. Typically, AISs have been applied to traditional desktop computer environments to protect against internet-based attacks, such {{as the work of}} Ramakrishnan and Srinivasan [22], where they reviewed several AIS-based security systems. In [23], Zhao applied an AIS for smartphone malware detection in a dynamic environment. Log preprocessing and system API access were dynamically captured and used as training features. They were able to achieve an 87.7 % true positive rate with an 8.2 % false positive rate. The differences between Zhao’s and our approach lie in feature extraction and the use of multiple-detector sets. Instead of dynamically capturing features, our approach utilizes static flow analysis. When using dynamic analysis, the app is treated as a black box. Therefore, an app can inconspicuously hide its true behavior using advanced obfuscation techniques. In static flow analysis, app behavior is much harder to obfuscate because the static analysis algorithm tracks data-flow through offline code analysis and simulated runtime environment behavior.|$|E

Understanding language means knowing what concept a word or phrase stands for and how to link them to form meaningful sentence. Identification of phrases or phrase chunking is an important step in natural language understanding (NLU). Chunker identifies and divides sentences into syntactically correlated word groups. Question Answering (QA) systems, another important application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) mostly requires retrieval of nouns or noun phrases as answers to the questions raised by the users. Also Chunking is an important preprocessing step in full parsing. Due to high ambiguity of natural language, exact parsing of text may become very complex. This ambiguity may be partially resolved by using chunking as an intermediate step. To {{the best of our knowledge}} no known work or tag set is available for phrase chunking in Malayalam.

40|$|Twenty papers {{derived from}} papers {{presented}} during the workshop. Internal parasites {{have been a}} problem for animals, probably since the dawn of evolution. However, domestication and the constraints we impose on animals, particularly ruminants, by restricting selection of forage and grazing range, load the dice very much in favour of the parasites. This is a continuing problem of most livestock we have to deal with. This text should inform the reader {{that this is not a}} situation which has quick solutions or easy answers, but despite this, progress in the control of parasites is being made. Knowledge of the parasites and of the host animals' responses to parasitic challenge will help us to keep pace with this progress. Also it is intended that the Animal Industries Workshop should go some way to explaining the principles of sustainable control. The total reliance we placed on the 'miracle' worm drenches which became available from the early 1960 s has resulted in our neglect of other management factors which, if utilised, should reduce our total dependence on these 'wonder' drugs. With the development of resistance to these drugs by the parasites and the spectre of meat and milk residue problems, the time is now opportune for re-examination of control measures. The purpose of the workshop and this book, which is derived from papers presented during the workshop, is to present up-to-date information which can be used to inform and upskill all concerned with the management of parasite problems. International specialists such as Quintin McKellar, Peter Waller and Ian Barger have contributed their considerable knowledge and understanding of the anthelmintics available, how they work, how anthelmintic resistance can arise and of the place long acting preparations and mixed anthelmintics have in control programmes. Other writers have addressed factors such as the extent of parasitism in New Zealand livestock, the life cycles and infectivity of these parasites in livestock, and the effects of nutrition in influencing the outcome of infection. Selection of resistant animals within breeding programmes and the acquisition of natural and <b>artificial</b> <b>immunity</b> are also included. Management practices to control gastrointestinal parasitism each have limitations and this is discussed, as is the use of computer models.

30|$|The {{intrusion}} detection method judges attacks {{based on data}} collected by multiple collection points in a computer network [5, 6]. The {{intrusion detection}} is an active protection technique that can intercept and respond to intrusions {{before they reach the}} network. However, the huge network data traffic is a huge challenge to intrusion detection systems as it induces high requirements on the detection efficiency so that attacks can be detected in real time. The restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) network was trained using the greedy algorithm, and low dimension expressions of the RBM network output were classified downwards using the back propagation algorithm [7]. The results indicated that the proposed model shows improved accuracy of intrusion detections, thus suitable for information extractions in high-dimension space. For data compression and low clustering efficiency issues, a modified self-adjustment clustering method is established based on direct correlation to samples close to cluster center [8]. This method effectively reduced clustering sample size and clustering time-space consumption and improves the effectiveness of intrusion detection. Aimed at feature optimization and selection in intrusion detections, a support vector machine (SVM) based two-stage feature selection method was proposed based on feature evaluations of the ratio of detection rate and false alarm rate [9]. In this method, filter noises and irrelevant features were filtered using Fisher classification and information gain in the filtering mode, respectively, to obtain overlapping feature subsets and effectively reduce modeling and detection time. For intrusion detections of internal nodes in wireless sensor networks (WSN), a layer-clustered intrusion detection method for trust value of node a based on the Beta distribution theory and outlier factor was proposed [10]. This method identifies abnormal nodes based on the Mahalanobis distance and exhibits low false alarm rates. Based on classification methods in data mining, optimized solutions were identified by direction calculations of relevant matrices and multi-category network attacks are analyzed by multi-objective mathematical programming model [11]. This method exhibits advantages such as low complexity, effective detections of multi-category attacks, and low false alarm rates. A fuzzy clustering intrusion model based on genetic algorithm and hierarchical algorithm was proposed [12]. Herein, the feature volume was determined by deletion of data set features using the Youden index, the susceptibility to initial cluster centers was relieved, and the local optimization issues in iteration were overcome. Experimental results demonstrated excellent detection performance of the proposed model for network attacks. For Kernel restriction issues in minimum enclosing ball algorithm, an intrusion detection method based on minimum enclosing ball with extensive Kernel was proposed [13]. This method can obtain the minimum enclosing ball of the sample set according to updates of the center and the radius of sphere and categorize network intrusions according to distributions of support vectors. To enhance the accuracy of intrusion detections, an intrusion detection method combining <b>artificial</b> <b>immunity</b> and rough set was proposed for vaccine injections [14]. This method can achieve real time detections of unknown attacks with improved effectiveness and efficiency. Also, a network intrusion detection model was proposed and an alarm system combining multiple proof techniques was established to filter false alarms [15]. An improved multi-objective genetic algorithm-based intrusion detection integrated method has been proposed [16]. This algorithm can effectively solve feature selection issues in intrusion detections, and the method based on this algorithm exhibited excellent detection accuracy and wide applicability to different categories of attacks.|$|E
