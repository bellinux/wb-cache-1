5|$|In November, Lyn {{stated that}} they wanted to {{purchases}} the shares in Ullevaal from NFF, who {{stated that they}} were now worth NOK10 million. NFF also raised questions if it was actually Lyn or the newly created limited company who were <b>actually</b> <b>going</b> to buy the shares. NFF stated that they were opposed to anyone but the federation and clubs owning the national stadium and that they were opposed to private investors. The federation hoped to use the high incomes generated from the recent success of the national team, including from participation in the 1994 FIFA World Cup, to allow the stadium company to charge high rent for the international matches and Cup Finals, thus quickly eliminating the stadium's debt. NFF felt it was unfair that they were in practice subsidizing Lyn by not having similar rent increases for the club, and that this should be reflected in the share value. In March 1994, Lyn sued NFF for the right to purchase the shares for NOK4.4 million plus interest.|$|E

[...] He also excused the film's characterization of Taylor Lautner's character, saying, [...] "The {{sight of the}} buff, young guys running through the forest with their tops off was slightly smirk-inducing. But it's fine. They know what their target-audience is." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Field Trip" [...] {{was written}} by {{executive}} producer Frank Spotnitz, who described the writing process as [...] "an experience". The script went through several phases; originally, the script was supposed to feature Mulder trapped in a cave with a mysterious monster. Then, the script was changed so that both Mulder and Scully would be trapped in the cave. Finally, the story was altered so that both Mulder and Scully only believed that they two were trapped in a cave, with only Mulder beginning to realize what was <b>actually</b> <b>going</b> on.|$|E

500|$|These {{concepts}} {{shaped the}} Mercury Control Center, which was located at Cape Canaveral in Florida.

As Mathews later recalled, Kraft came to him one day saying, [...] "There needs to be someone in charge of the flights while they're <b>actually</b> <b>going</b> on, and I want to be that person." [...] In this informal way, the position of flight director was born.|$|E

500|$|Much of the comic's {{dark humor}} {{is derived from}} its {{contrasts}} with Half-Life 2: in a depressing, dark vision of a conquered humanity's future, Gordon Freeman becomes a hero and savior; the similarly named Gordon Frohman, on the other hand, is just an average person, improbably cheerful {{to the point of}} stupidity, and somewhat naïve as to what is <b>actually</b> <b>going</b> on around him. [...] For instance, Frohman fails to realize that his return-addressed letters to Doctor Breen reveal his location, and so result in that location being invaded, bombed, or otherwise compromised.|$|E
500|$|When Liz learns from Kenneth that NBC {{will have}} Green Week, she says [...] "Oh brother, are they <b>actually</b> <b>going</b> to do {{something}} this year or are they just going to put that stupid green peacock {{in the corner of}} the screen?", a reference to the NBC peacock symbol having a green logo design during Green Week. As a result of what Liz said, Kenneth breaks the fourth wall, a term used when a character in a television show, film or on stage directly addresses the audience, when he glances down at the logo.|$|E
500|$|The episode's script parodied {{parents who}} voiced strong {{opposition}} to South Park, portraying them as so invested in fighting the television program that {{they fail to}} pay attention to what is <b>actually</b> <b>going</b> on in their children's lives. This is illustrated in the episode when Stan calls his mother seeking help because Death is chasing him, only for his mother to ignore him because she is too busy protesting the Terrance and Phillip show. This is also demonstrated by the line Kyle says, [...] "I think that parents only get so offended by television because they rely on it as a babysitter and the sole educator of their kids." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Death" [...] {{was written}} and {{directed}} by series co-creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone. The episode, along with the Terrance and Phillip show, were inspired by early criticism that South Park was little more than flatulence jokes and primitive animation. The script portrays the parents as so invested in protesting television programs, they fail to pay any attention to what is <b>actually</b> <b>going</b> on in their children's lives. They seem to want to make television clean and wholesome so the entertainment industry can raise their kids so they themselves don't have to make the time and effort to be full-time parents. The episode also advocates against censorship and addresses the morality and ethics of euthanasia.|$|E
500|$|... "Better in Time" [...] {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics. In {{his review of}} the album, Chung Ah-young of The Korea Times described the single as [...] "one of the best tracks [...] with impressive piano sounds harmonized with [...] powerful vocals". Alex Fletcher from Digital Spy gave a mixed review to the double A-side. He called the single a [...] "placid affair" [...] with [...] "its plinky-plonky piano and R groove resting uncomfortably next to Lewis's creamy vocal style". The BBC's reviewer Fraser McAlpine gave [...] "Better in Time" [...] three stars out of five commenting that [...] "The tune's quite nice, fairly hummable without ever <b>actually</b> <b>going</b> anywhere and despite the floaty, Mariah-esque qualities of Leona's vocals, it never goes completely mental in the throat-breakdancing department".|$|E
500|$|David Sims of The A.V. Club {{gave the}} episode an A, {{calling it a}} [...] "classic" [...] and writing that it [...] "is so damn clever in how it bonds Jerry's fears about social niceties with larger fears about mortality"; he also praised Louis-Dreyfus's acting, saying that Elaine [...] "has an amusingly stark little bit of {{dialogue}} about death midway through the episode: [...] "You know, funerals always make me think about my own mortality and how I'm <b>actually</b> <b>going</b> to die someday. Me, dead. Imagine that!" [...] I think it's probably Louis-Dreyfus' best moment of the show so far, because she's really starting to nail Elaine's declarative, vaguely imperious, self-centered tone." [...] He also admired [...] "the estimable Barney Martin in his first appearance as Jerry's irascible dad." ...|$|E

I'm afraid of your success, and of all the money you're making." ...|$|R
500|$|The episode {{centered}} on Kirk Acevedo's character Charlie Francis. Acevedo explained in an interview, [...] "Charlie goes {{out on this}} call, and he gets attacked by this mythological, genetically enhanced griffin. He fights for his life throughout the episode". Acevedo suggested that his wife, actress Kiersten Warren, play his character's wife Sonia, and the producers duly cast her. Acevedo explained his choice was because, [...] "to create intimacy with someone who you don't know is <b>actually</b> not <b>going</b> to work. So to have your real wife do it, then {{you can be a}} lot better on screen".|$|R
