Results of the experiments show that only limited fragmentation occurred to both limestones tested under all operating conditions. Under oxy-firing conditions primary fragmentation was significantly reduced with respect to air-fired operation, most likely because of the absence of limestone calcination under high CO(2) atmospheres. Thermal shock upon limestone injection in the hot bed appears {{not to be able to}} induce significant particle fragmentation by its own. Particle size, bed temperature and simultaneous occurrence of sulphation reaction were found not to influence significantly the limestone primary fragmentation extent under both oxy-firing and air-firing conditions.

The paper addresses the current rise of artists ‘working in the world’ – with non-art forms.

40|$|This paper {{outlines}} {{the development of}} <b>a</b> microwave <b>heated</b> <b>apparatus</b> {{for the production of}} silicon carbide (SiC) based ceramic matrix composites via chemical vapor infiltration. An innovative pilot scale reactor was designed and built. A coupled thermal and electromagnetic model was developed in order to predict the temperature profile inside the reactor. The results obtained from the model demonstrated that the electric field inside the sample was constant. This fact is particularly important in order to prevent the thermal instabilities (run-aways) that are typical in the case of microwave heating. Therefore the heating was uniform {{with the aid of a}} mode stirrer that achieved a better distribution of the microwave power and then improved the process efficiency. The infiltration cycles were carried out on SiC fiber preforms and resulted in an excellent average weight increase with respect to the initial sample. By using microwave heating, the treatment times were considerably reduced with respect to the conventional process times reported in the literature. The microstructure of the SiC composites were observed by scanning the electron microscopy in order to evaluate the quality and the degree of densification which was achieved within the fiber tows. The SiC deposition inside of the sample was sufficiently homogeneous and compact, even if a certain degree of inter-tow porosity was still evident...|$|R

40|$|International audienceAbstract The {{techniques}} for solving the Inverse Heat Conduction Problem represent useful tools for designing <b>heat</b> transfer <b>apparatuses.</b> One {{of their most}} challenging applications derives from the necessity of catching what happens inside <b>a</b> <b>heat</b> transfer <b>apparatus</b> by monitoring the temperature distribution on the external wall of the device, possibly by means of contactless experimental methodologies. The research presented here deals with {{the application of a}} solution strategy of the Inverse Heat Conduction Problem (IHCP) aimed at estimating the local heat transfer coefficient on the internal wall surface of a pipe, under a forced convection problem. The solution strategy, formulated for a 2 D model, is based on the Quadrupole Method (QM) coupled to the Truncated Singular Value Decomposition approach, used to cope with the ill-conditioning of the problem. presents some advantages over the more classical domain or boundary discretization methods as for instance the fact that, being meshless, brings to a reduction of the computational cost. The analytical model, built under the QM, is validated by means of numerical simulations and the numerical outputs are then used as synthetic data inputs to solve the IHCP. The estimation methodology is also applied to experimental data regarding a forced convection problem in coiled pipes. Moreover, the adopted solution technique is compared to other two well-known and consolidated approaches: Finite Element Method coupled to the Tikhonov Regularization Method and Gaussian Filtering Technique. The comparison highlights that, for the problem here investigated, the Quadrupole Method coupled to the Truncated Singular Value Decomposition and Finite Element Method coupled to the Tikhonov Regularization Method perform better than the Gaussian Filtering Technique when the noise level is low, while, for higher noise level values, their efficiency is almost comparable, as it happens in the considered experimental study case...|$|R

Thermal fatigue tests {{were carried out}} using <b>a</b> special induction <b>heating</b> <b>apparatus,</b> which consisted of induction heating and water spray cooling unit. The process of thermal cycling was simulated using a coupled heat-transfer solid-mechanics finite element model. It was seen that the thermal fatigue resistance was higher in the gas nitrided samples after austenizing at 1020 degrees C than for the gas nitrided samples after austenizing at 1100 degrees C. The thermal fatigue endurance limit {{was found to be}} maximum for the samples having a compound layer comprising of the higher phase fraction of gamma' (Fe- 4 N 1 -x). It was also found that, lower the ratio of compound layer thickness to the total diffusion depth, the higher is the fatigue life. These results were influenced by two major effects of nitrided (diffusion) layer. First is the high compressive residual stresses imparted on the surface which tend to mitigate the effect of thermal tensile stress and secondly very high surface hardness, due to the diffusion of nitrogen, which increase the threshold for crack initiation at the surface.

40|$|Lewice (LEWis ICE {{accretion}} program) is software used by {{literally hundreds}} of users in the aeronautics community for predicting ice shapes, collections efficiencies, and anti-icing heat requirements for aircraft. LEWICE performs its analysis in minutes on a desktop PC, allowing the user to run several parameter studies for design purposes. The ice shape predictions {{have been used to}} assess performance degradation both as an input to a CFD program or experimentally in flight or in a wind tunnel. This information is important to ensure an airplane s safe passage through an icing cloud. Currently, Lewice runs as a DOS program that accepts many different inputs such as cloud conditions, wing shapes, and thermal deicing inputs. Usually, such experimental data is stored in spreadsheets. However, Lewice inputs are text files; therefore, they must be generated by the user. Lewice s outputs (collection efficiency, ice shapes and thicknesses) are also text files; to plot the data, users must generate a spreadsheet with this output. Because all Lewice J/O {{is in the form of}} text files, using Lewice can be tricky and time-consuming. Our goal was to improve Lewice s usability by creating a user interface that would automatically generate Lewice input from a spreadsheet and automatically put Lewice output into spreadsheets with charts. Additionally, this user interface would automatically convert units (as Lewice only accepts input in certain units) and offer several output options. I call this program the Lewice Console. The Lewice Console is an easy to use interface for Lewice written in Visual Basic. It allows users to run Lewice given a spreadsheet listing experimental conditions. It automatically generates the input to Lewice, does necessary unit conversions, runs Lewice, and produces a spreadsheet with charts plotting the data. It allows users to import data from previously generated Lewice inputs into a spreadsheet. It also allows users to batch run Lewice on several different inputs to automatically generate multiple output spreadsheets. You can also generate plots of actual data vs. experimental data. These capabilities are just the beginning for the Lewice Console. Lewice is capable of running a full deicing experiment given <b>a</b> geometry and <b>heating</b> <b>apparatus</b> information.

Results suggest that the naphthenates are degraded most readily followed by phthalocyanines and by porphyrins.
