Participants were 800 children (7 – 12 years old) from third- to fifth-grade classrooms who completed self-report measures of {{the frequency}} <b>and</b> perceived <b>severity</b> of their bullying and victimization and of cognitive and affective empathy. Results showed that the frequency <b>and</b> perceived <b>severity</b> of bullying were moderately correlated in the entire sample but unrelated within the subsample of bullies.

Frequent, but not severe, bullies reported less cognitive empathy than non-bullies whereas both frequent and severe victims reported more affective empathy than non-victims. Within subsamples of bullies and victims, frequency of bullying was negatively associated with cognitive and affective empathy, <b>and</b> perceived <b>severity</b> of bullying was positively associated with affective empathy.

5|$|Narcosis {{has been}} {{compared}} with altitude sickness regarding its variability of onset (though not its symptoms); its effects depend on many factors, with variations between individuals. Thermal cold, stress, heavy work, fatigue, and carbon dioxide retention all increase the risk <b>and</b> <b>severity</b> of narcosis. Carbon dioxide has a high narcotic potential and also causes increased {{blood flow to the}} brain, increasing the effects of other gases. Increased risk of narcosis results from increasing the amount of carbon dioxide retained through heavy exercise, shallow or skip breathing, or because of poor gas exchange in the lungs.|$|E
