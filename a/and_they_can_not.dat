500|$|In 2013, Miyazaki {{stated that}} Howl's Moving Castle was his {{favorite}} creation, and explained his choice by saying [...] "I wanted to convey the message that life is worth living, and I don't think that's changed." [...] In the film, Sophie is shown to overcome extreme challenges by learning to put the well-being of those she cares about above her own self-interest, a quality which Miyazaki refers to as devotion. Several of the protagonists in Miyazaki's films, such as Ashitaka and San in Princess Mononoke and Sheeta and Pazu in Castle in the Sky learn to survive by learning the same lesson. Cavallaro states that Miyazaki spreads this moral through the entire film, to convey human beings' ability to be compassionate, such as when the scarecrow holds an umbrella over Sophie's head when it rains. Over {{the course of the}} film, Howl, its most vain and selfish character, also learns to put others before himself. When Madame Suliman returns the Witch of the Waste to her true form as a decrepit old woman, Sophie takes her in and cares for her, despite the witch being responsible for Sophie's curse, thus strongly demonstrating the idea of compassion. The witch then nearly destroys Howl through her selfish behavior, but also helps save the castle at the end. Parsons writes that [...] "In Miyazaki's balancing act, old women can be powerful and weak, positive and negative, nurturing and selfish, maligned and loved; in short, they can not be simply categorized or stereotyped, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> be dismissed as fantasy malefactors embodied by evil witches." [...] They are also given a lot of space in the film as active characters, something not commonly found in western movies.|$|E

50|$|Unnecessary {{constraints}} {{are another}} very common barrier that people face {{while attempting to}} problem-solve. This particular phenomenon occurs when the subject, {{trying to solve the}} problem subconsciously, places boundaries on the task at hand, which in turn forces him or her to strain to be more innovative in their thinking. The solver hits a barrier when they become fixated on only one way to solve their problem, and it becomes increasingly difficult to see anything but the method they have chosen. Typically, the solver experiences this when attempting to use a method they have already experienced success from, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> help but try to make it work in the present circumstances as well, even if they see that it is counterproductive.|$|E
50|$|The major {{disadvantage}} of rotary and fixed-matrix regenerators {{is that there}} is always some mixing of the fluid streams, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> be completely separated. There is an unavoidable carryover of a small fraction of one fluid stream into the other. In the rotary regenerator, the carryover fluid is trapped inside the radial seal and in the matrix, and in a fixed-matrix regenerator, the carryover fluid is the fluid that remains in the void volume of the matrix. This small fraction will mix with the other stream in the following half-cycle. Therefore, rotary and fixed-matrix regenerators are only used when it is acceptable for the two fluid streams to be mixed. Mixed flow is common for gas-to-gas heat and/or energy transfer applications, and less common in liquid or phase-changing fluids since fluid contamination is often prohibited with liquid flows.|$|E

She goes to the Roake corporation and interrogates {{the head of the}} company, Randolph Westley-Smythe. After testing the water and knowing that the citizens of Crown Point aren't taking any drugs, she concludes that the Roake corporation is slowly killing them as they have control over all of Crown Point's food division.

5000|$|A ro-langs is a zombie-like {{creature}} from Tibetan folklore. Ro is {{the word}} for corpse and Langs is the perfect tense of [...] "to rise up", so Ro-Langs literally means [...] "a risen corpse". A ro-langs is usually created by a gdon spirit, or a sorcerer. [...] A ro-langs cannot speak or bend over, it signals its victims by wagging its tongue back <b>and</b> forth. <b>They</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> bend at any joints, which makes them walk with a stiff-armed lurch. In regions of Tibet there are low doorways to keep the ro-langs out.|$|R
5000|$|In {{contrast}} to the CLOB approach is the Request For Quote ("RFQ") trading method. RFQ is an asymmetric trade execution model. In this method, a customer queries a finite set of participant market makers who quote a bid/offer ("a market") to the customer. The customer may only [...] "hit the bid" [...] (sell to the highest bidder) or [...] "lift the offer" [...] (buy from the cheapest seller). The customer is prohibited from stepping inside the bid/ask spread and thereby reducing its execution fees. Contrary to the CLOB model, customers can only trade with dealers. <b>They</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> trade with other customers, <b>and</b> importantly, <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> make markets themselves.|$|R
50|$|However, tanks {{have the}} {{disadvantage}} of having the driver at the front, close to the flail and any explosions, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> go slow enough for effective mine clearance. Also, the weight of tanks makes them difficult to transport (by contrast, the 18-ton Hydrema 910 is light enough to be moved by air in a C-130 Hercules.) The tanks used have generally been obsolete models that have been highly modified - some work under remote control, others have had the driver's station moved to the rear. In modern times, {{there has been little}} military interest in an updated equivalent of the Sherman Crab or Matilda Scorpion - a substantially unmodified tank still capable of combat. In battle, the modern preference is to detonate mines with explosive devices (mine-clearing line charges), such as the Antipersonnel Obstacle Breaching System or the Giant Viper. During the Gulf War, the U.S. 2nd Marine Division made an attempt to breach an Iraqi mine field with a mine flail mounted on an armored bulldozer. But the flail was destroyed and the bulldozer crippled by an Iraqi anti-tank mine.|$|E
5000|$|Twelvers {{believe in}} the Return, the term refers to the revival {{of a group of}} Muslims back to this world after the {{appearance}} of Mahdi. The base of this belief derives from the revival of the dead in the past communities as mentioned in the Quran and the revival at the Day of Resurrection.Sobhani describes that Resurrection is both of body and spirit. Quran 17: 51, in response to those that ask [...] "Who will restore us", answers: [...] "He who brought you forth the first time. [...] " [...] In another place, verse 22: 5-6, it is like the revival of the earth in the season of the spring after the winter. He adds the verse 36: 79 implies that the person who is raised up at the Resurrection is the one who was alive on the earth. The purpose of the Resurrection of the body and rejoining the soul is that it experience the rewards and punishments which are sensible <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> be experienced with the lack of the body.The purpose of spiritual resurrection is to observe those rewards and punishments which are especial to the spirit.|$|E
5000|$|Ray Whitley also {{endorsed}} another Gibson made guitar, sold by {{the mail}} order house Montgomery Wards under the house brand [...] "Recording King." [...] This highly esteemed guitar was marketed only in 1939, and featured the signature of Mr. Whitley on the headstock. 235 of these were made in mahogany, and 235 in rosewood. One of these instruments was the preferred guitar of American composer John Fahey, who recorded extensively on the instrument from 1969-1978. It was severely damaged in a domestic quarrel between Fahey and his girlfriend at the time. The remains of the guitar were collected by guitarist Peter Lang, who was an employee of Fahey's Takoma Records, and preserved for 23 years before being repaired by luthier Federico Sheppard, who later held the trademark for Recording King guitars.The Ray Whitley Recording King guitar was a favorite of B-17 pilots during the second World War, which may explain their rarity today. During the brief time this guitar was marketed, {{it was the most}} ornate guitar built by Gibson at the time, but as it was sold under the Recording King label, at $29.95 it was far from the most expensive guitar produced by Gibson prior to World War II."235 of these were made in mahogany, and 235 in rosewood."These numbers were entered without any reference or justification.
