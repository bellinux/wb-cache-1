40|$|Abstract. Enterprise architects seek {{to align}} {{enterprise}} processes and structure with their supporting IT systems so that enterprises can flourish in their environment. The enterprise architecture (EA) discipline {{has emerged from}} business best practices. EA frameworks are therefore mostly informal. As a result {{there is a lack}} of EA tools that can help enterprise architects to check this alignment. Most notably, current EA tools do not help enterprise architects to formalize the alignment of the multiple levels that constitute an enterprise model. In this paper we propose an EA framework and an associated tool that provide <b>alignment</b> <b>checking</b> along the functional and organizational hierarchies. We illustrate this approach with the Sun Microsystems industrial example of the Pet Store. ...|$|E

40|$|Tutorialpg. 129 An update and a {{demonstration}} of the reverse indicator alignment method with graphical plotting are presented. Hot alignment methods are not covered, but it should be clear that heat rises (falls) can be plotted directly on the graph. Only sizing (scale) differentiates the alignment of pumps from compressors. The scaling presented herein is typical. Reverse indicator tooling and an alignment training model will be discussed. The concentration here is on the pure steps of alignment. The training model allows the movement of a motor relative to a pump. The pump is fixed and the motor is the moveable unit with the coupling feet (near) and outboard feet (far) adjustable by screw travel. Each foot can be adjusted vertically up and down with traversing indicators, as well as horizontally, left and right, with traversing indicators. A flexible coupling remains in place as the shaft is rotated with reverse indicator bars in place. The reverse indicator weights are carried by the motor and pump shafts, i. e., the reach bar only supports its own weight, reducing ?bar sag. ? Reverse indicator dials, as well as motor foot travel indicators, read out in mil subdivisions (1 mil= 0. 0014 in= 25. 4 ?M).

40|$|The {{proliferation}} of dynamic program analysis tools has {{done much to}} ease the burden of developing complex software. However, creating such tools remains a challenge. Dynamic binary instrumentation frameworks such as DyanamoRIO and Pin provide support for such tools by taking responsibility for application transparency and machine code manipulation. However, tool writers must still make a tough choice when writing instrumentation: should they inject custom inline assembly into the application code, or should they use the framework facilities for inserting callbacks into regular C code? Custom assembly can be more performant and more flexible, but it forces the tool to take some responsibility for maintaining application transparency. Callbacks into C, or "clean calls," allow the tool writer to ignore the details of maintaining transparency. Generally speaking, a clean call entails switching to a safe stack, saving all registers, materializing the arguments, and jumping to the callback. This thesis presents a suite of optimizations for DynamoRIO that improves the performance of "naive tools," or tools which rely primarily on clean calls for instrumentation. Most importantly, we present a novel partial inlining optimization for instrumentation routines with conditional analysis. For simpler instrumentation routines, we present a novel call coalescing optimization that batches calls into fewer context switches. In addition to these two novel techniques, we provide a suite of machine code optimizations designed to leverage the opportunities created by the aforementioned techniques. With this additional functionality built on DynamoRIO, we have shown improvements of up to 54. 8 x for a naive instruction counting tool {{as well as a}} 3. 7 x performance improvement for a memory <b>alignment</b> <b>checking</b> tool on average for many of the benchmarks from the SPEC 2006 CPU benchmark suite. by Reid Kleckner.

40|$|We {{present the}} Scalable Nucleotide Alignment Program (SNAP), a new {{short and long}} read aligner that is both more {{accurate}} (i. e., aligns more reads with fewer errors) and 10 – 100 × faster than state-of-the-art tools such as BWA. Unlike recent aligners based on the Burrows-Wheeler transform, SNAP uses a simple hash index of short seed sequences from the genome, similar to BLAST’s. However, SNAP greatly reduces the number and cost of local <b>alignment</b> <b>checks</b> performed through several measures: it uses longer seeds to reduce the false positive locations considered, leverages larger memory capacities to speed index lookup, and excludes most candidate locations without fully computing their edit distance to the read. The result is an algorithm that scales well for reads from one hundred to thousands of bases long and provides a rich error model that can match classes of mutations (e. g., longer indels) that today’s fast aligners ignore. We calculate that SNAP can align a dataset with 30 × coverage of a human genome {{in less than an}} hour for a cost of $ 2 on Amazon EC 2, with higher accuracy than BWA. Finally, we describe ongoing work to further improve SNAP. ...|$|R

The patterns are similar for all three loci with the most speciose suborders of isopods also having the most divergent mitochondrial nucleotide sequences. Recommendations for designing an order- or suborder-level molecular study in previously unstudied groups of Crustacea would include: (1) collecting a minimum of two-four species or genera thought to be most divergent, (2) sampling across the group of interest as equally as possible in terms of taxonomic representation and the distribution of species, (3) surveying several genes, and (4) carrying out preliminary <b>alignments,</b> <b>checking</b> data for nucleotide bias, transition/ transversion ratios, and saturation levels before committing to a large-scale sequencing effort...|$|R
40|$|Embedded {{processors}} {{for media}} applications usually have SIMD instructions. SIMD instructions provide {{a form of}} vectorization where a large machine word {{is viewed as a}} vector of subwords and the same operation is performed on all subwords in parallel. Systematic usage of SIMD instructions can significantly improve program performance. Usually each memory access must be aligned with the instruction’s data access size. With C becoming the dominant language for programming embedded devices, there is a clear need for C compilers which optimize the use of SIMD instructions. An important problem in designing such compilers is the question of determining whether a C pointer is aligned, i. e., whether it refers to the beginning of a machine word. In this paper, we describe a method which determines the alignment of pointers at compile time. The alignment information is used {{to reduce the number of}} dynamic <b>alignment</b> <b>checks</b> and the overhead incurred by them. Our method uses an interprocedural analysis which analyzes pointer values propagated through function calls.

40|$|An easily-used {{system has}} been {{developed}} for routine measurements of the alignment of beams used for radiation therapy. The position of a beam of circular cross section is measured {{with respect to a}} steel sphere fixed to the patient positioning table and which should coincide with the isocenter. Since measurements can be done at all gantry angles (if one is available) and with all possible orientations of the patient table, the system is particularly suited for rapid and accurate measurements of gantry and/or couch isocentricity. Because it directly measures beam-to-positioner offset, the system provides an inclusive alignment verification of the total treatment system. The {{system has been}} developed for use with proton beams, but it could equally be used for <b>alignment</b> <b>checks</b> of an x-ray beam from a linear accelerator or other source. The measuring instrument consists of a scintillation screen viewed by a CCD camera, mounted on the gantry downstream of the sphere, The steel sphere is not large enough to stop protons of all energies of interest; however, it will always modify the energy and direction of protons which intersect it, creating a region of lower intensity (a "shadow'') in the light spot created by the proton beam hitting the screen. The position of the shadow with respect to the light spot {{is a measure of the}} alignment of the system. An image-analysis algorithm has been developed for an automatic determination of the position of the shadow with respect to the light spot. The specifications and theoretical analysis of the system have been derived from Monte Carlo simulations, which are validated by measurements. We have demonstrated that the device detects beam misalignments with an accuracy (1 s. d.) of 0. 05 mm, which is in agreement with the expected performance. This accuracy is more than sufficient to detect the maximum allowed misalignment of +/- 0. 5 mm. (C) 1999 American Association of Physicists in Medicine. [S 0094 - 2405 (99) 00611 - 2]...|$|R

Further, the chimeric alignments are displayed to the user to assist in sequence classification.

40|$|Often a {{designer}} has {{the problem to}} apply a suitable system of geometrical and dimensional tolerances to an assembly. The right solution is not unique, in fact {{it depends on the}} chosen parameters. If the tolerances have to be optimized, some important parameters have to be taken into account, e. g. the efficiency of each prescription, or if this last is reachable, or it can be verified and how much the realization costs. The authors opinion is that a statistical approach based on the Monte Carlo Method is very useful when the tolerances chains are complex. This paper shows an application of this method in order to verify the functional alignment between two assemblies and a critical analysis of the uncertainty in phase both of the component design and test. This study has been developed thanks to the strict requirements imposed by ESA (European Space Agency) on the components that Thales Alenia Space has to realize within the LISA Pathfinder experiment. The very critical aspect of this work is to reciprocally align two cylindrical elements of two different assemblies. The specifications require 100 μm as maximum linear displacement and 300 μrad as maximum angular displacement. Moreover this prescriptions have to be verified also when the two elements are independently moving. To be able to reach such strict accuracy level the components have been assembled in an ISO 100 class cleanroom and the work space was a 3 D Coordinate-Measuring Machine (CMM). The cylindrical elements have a 10 mm diameter, so the value of the measurement uncertainty associated with the <b>alignment</b> <b>check</b> is fundamental. Starting from the different uncertainty sources, the measurability and verifiability of the alignment have been considered and evaluated. The overall uncertainty has been assessed by numerical simulations which have taken into account the dimensional, geometrical and form tolerances as well as the instrumental uncertainty of the 3 D CMM. This estimation has been positively validated by a session of repeated measurements. Numerical simulations have also allowed performing a sensitivity analysis, in order to give information about which sources more contribute to the overall uncertainty...|$|R
40|$|The Clementine {{spacecraft}} {{was developed}} to demonstrate the performance of BMDO 2 ̆ 7 s lightweight sensor suite. The suite consisted of five different sensors (Star Trackers, UV/Vis, HiRes, NIR, LWIR) and a UDAR (Laser Impulse Detection And Ranging) system. The worst-case sensor operating requirements for the Clementine mission were: interface temperature with - 20 to 2 ° C, alignment to +/- 100 µRad, and jitter kept below 40 Rad in 40 msec. The average hear dissipation of the suite was over 100 Watts while operating {{for two of the}} five hour lunar orbit. To accomplish the mission the sensor suite was integrated onto a single-substrate sensor bench within the spacecraft. The bench met the stringent thermal, alignment, and jitter requirements of the sensors, and concurrently isolated the sensors from outside spacecraft contamination, as well as thermal and structural flexure. Also taken into account were the mission design drivers of hot thermal environment in lunar orbit, limited volume in the spacecraft, minimal weight, limited budget, and a six month schedule from concept to delivery of a flight bench. The design and development of the sensor bench will be discussed. Three different types of heat pipes were used to transport the heat of the sensors to radiators located {{on the side of the}} spacecraft. A beryllium metal block was used as a thermal capacitor during peak heat loads. Thermal straps connected sensors to heat pipes to keep thermal gradients as little as 3 ° C per inch across the interface. The bench was fastened in a quasi-kinematic fashion to eliminate the transfer of spacecraft structural loads and thermal flexing, and yet was rigid enough to keep alignment through launch. The bench substrate itself was made out of aluminum honeycomb. The alignment mechanism consisted of a nut-on-nut method to attain and keep the 100 µRad requirement. Volume and alignment constraints dictated sensor location on the bench. Development of the bench involved rigorous testing to insure requirements were met.
