These are often {{composed of a}} stronger material than standard envelopes and are often used by businesses to transport documents {{that may not be}} folded or damaged, such as legal documents and contracts. Due to their size, larger envelopes are sometimes charged <b>additional</b> <b>postage.</b>|$|E
25|$|Packages {{are often}} sent through some postal services, usually {{requiring}} <b>additional</b> <b>postage</b> than an average letter or postcard. Many postal services have limitations {{as to what}} a package {{may or may not}} contain, usually placing limits or bans on perishable, hazardous or flammable materials. Some hazardous materials in limited quantities may be shipped with appropriate markings and packaging, like an ORM-D label. Additionally, as a result of terrorism concerns, the U.S. Postal Service subjects their packages to numerous security tests, often scanning or x-raying packages for materials that might be found in biological materials or mail bombs.|$|E

5000|$|The Dutch East IndiesThe first {{postage stamp}} in the Dutch East Indies was printed in Utrecht Netherlands, on 1 April 1864. The stamp design showed {{a picture of}} King Willem III of Netherlands with a face value of ten cents in imperforation, design by T W Kaiser of Netherlands. Continued between 1864 and 1920, stamp designs only showed picture of the King and Queen of Netherlands, some were shown in typographic design. In 1921, a stamp {{appeared}} in different look. This stamp series {{is known as the}} [...] and was specially printed to serve as <b>additional</b> <b>postages</b> for sending sea mail in waterproof iron chests. Stamps issued in later years more often began to show the culture and geography of archipelago. During the Dutch East Indies period, the stamps were printed in Netherlands by the firm of Joh. Enschedé & Zoner of Haarlem, some printing was done in Batavia (Jakarta) by Reproductiebedrijf Topografische Dienst. The stamps mostly printed in single or two colors.|$|R
50|$|The Feudatory States {{maintained}} their own postal services within their territories and issued stamps {{with their own}} designs. Many of the stamps were imperforate and without gum, as issued. Many varieties of type, paper, inks and dies are not listed in the standard catalogues. The stamps of each Feudatory State were valid only within that State, so letters sent outside that State needed <b>additional</b> British India <b>postage.</b>|$|R

50|$|A {{special use}} of the term late fee is <b>additional</b> <b>postage</b> that was once {{required}} by Post Offices to allow inclusion of a letter or package in the outgoing mail dispatch although having been posted later than the normal closing time for mail. Often a special Late Fee Box was provided.|$|E

5000|$|Reluctant to antagonize {{potential}} {{freight customers}} by refusing letters, but {{not wishing to}} interrupt company operations for free mail carriage, the company's purser, C.H. Parson, had the company print up its own postage stamps. One thousand [...] "stamps" [...] with the initials [...] "U.C." [...] (for Upper Columbia Company) and the denomination of 5 cents were printed. One thousand more [...] "labels" [...] with just the initials [...] "U.C" [...] were also printed. An ordinary letter in those days cost 3 cents to send, so the Upper Columbia Company's [...] "stamps" [...] were considerably more than regular postage. The idea {{seems to have been}} to discourage the use of the steamer for mail, and perhaps to make a little money on the side. The details of how stamps and labels were used are not clear, but clearly some did pass through the Canadian mails with <b>additional</b> official <b>postage</b> stamps also affixed. Genuine envelopes (called [...] "covers") bearing the stamps or labels of the Upper Columbia Company are rare philatelic items and are sought after by stamp collectors.|$|R
5000|$|The {{increasing}} frequency of postal rate increases from the 1970s on, {{and the necessity}} to wait for these {{to be approved by}} Congress, made it problematic for the Postal Service to provide stamps matching the increased costs in a timely manner. Until it was known, for example, whether the new first-class rate would be 16c or, instead, 15c, no denominated stamp could be printed. The Postal Service found a way to bypass this problem in 1978. Preparatory to that year's increase, an orange colored stamp with a simple eagle design appeared bearing the denomination [...] "A" [...] instead of a number; and the public was informed that this stamp would satisfy the new first-class rate, whatever it turned out to be. Subsequent rate increases resulted in B, C and D stamps, which bore the same eagle design but were printed, respectively, in purple, buff-brown and blue-green. When it came time for an E stamp in 1987, the Postal Service commissioned a more elaborate design: a color picture of the globe as seen from space (E for Earth). Rises since have prompted F for Flower, G for Old Glory and H for Hat stamps, all appropriately illustrated. The F stamp in 1991 was accompanied by an undenominated [...] "make-up" [...] stamp with no pictorial design beyond a frame, which enclosed the words [...] "This U. S. stamp, along with 25c of <b>additional</b> U. S. <b>postage,</b> is equivalent to the 'F' stamp rate." ...|$|R

50|$|Mail {{to foreign}} {{destinations}} required <b>additional</b> <b>postage</b> as Yemen {{was not yet}} {{a member of the}} UPU. With printed matter i.e. the Umm al Qura newspaper and the government gazette Al Iman to foreign destinations including Cairo, Damascus and Beirut the additional franking was usually the one Anna adhesives, though also found without additional franking. Syrians worked in Yemen in Government service.|$|E
50|$|U.S. Special Delivery was {{a postal}} service paid for with <b>additional</b> <b>postage</b> for urgent letters and postal packets which are {{delivered}} {{in less time than}} by standard or first class mail service. Its meaning is different and separate from express mail delivery service. Essentially it meant that a postal packet was delivered from a post office to the addressee immediately once it arrived at the post office responsible for delivering it, rather than waiting for the next regular delivery to the addressee.|$|E

50|$|In July 1879, the Post Office of India {{introduced}} a quarter anna postcard {{that could be}} posted {{from one place to}} another within British India. This was the cheapest form of post provided to the Indian people to date and proved a huge success. The establishment of a large postal system spanning India resulted in unprecedented postal access: a message on a postcard could be sent from one part of the country to another part (often to a physical address without a nearby post office) without <b>additional</b> <b>postage</b> affixed. This was followed in April 1880 by postcards meant specifically for government use and by reply postcards in 1890. The postcard facility continues to this date in independent India.|$|E
50|$|The {{postage meter}} {{normally}} {{consists of a}} keyboard for entering the postage, three seals, and a stamping mechanism. Years ago, users needed to take their meter to a postal office in order to add <b>additional</b> <b>postage</b> (sometimes called a “reset” or “refill”). That changed in 1979 when Pitney Bowes invented remote meter resetting, otherwise known as Postage by Phone. Today, users can add to their postage balance by telephone, prepaid cards, via the web or through a direct connection over the Internet. The first counter shows the remaining balance. The second counter shows the total postage of the franked consignments. The third one counts the number of prints and is for statistic purposes only.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{fundraising}} (or semipostal) stamps {{have had}} this feature for years. For example, the breast cancer research stamp was issued in 1998. Forever Stamps {{can be used for}} international mail if <b>additional</b> <b>postage</b> is attached. Alternatively, in the beginning of 2013, the USPS introduced a Global Forever stamp, for first-class one-ounce international mail. In October of the same year, another Global Forever stamp with a Christmas motif was issued. [...] Two new stamps were issued the following year. For collectors all four were also printed in small numbers without die cuts, and so were imperforated. Another Global Forever issue, showing the Moon, followed in 2016. This was only issued with die cuts.|$|E
50|$|During World War One, {{a number}} of British colonies {{introduced}} a temporary levy on correspondence {{in order to raise}} funds for expenditure incurred in connection with the war. In mid-August 1916 a notice was issued in Tortola notifying the public that effective 1 September, all letters and parcels posted in the Virgin Islands to places in the British Empire outside the Leeward Islands had to pay <b>additional</b> <b>postage</b> as follows: 1d. on every letter, and 3d. on every parcel. Incoming postal packets containing dutiable goods were also to be charged a “War Surtax” of 3d. before delivery. “Three-penny and penny stamps surcharged WAR STAMP will shortly be on sale for this purpose. Until these are ready ordinary stamps can be used,” the Postmaster’s notice stated. On 1 February 1917 the tax was extended to letters addressed to the U.S.A. Covers or postal receipts documenting proper (non philatelic) use of these stamps are scarce. War tax stamps remained in use as definitives after the war ended.|$|E
