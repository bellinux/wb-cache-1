500|$|In January 2012, the FIA {{banned the}} use of [...] "reactive ride-height". The system, first {{proposed}} by Lotus in 2010 (but not applied until 2012), used hydraulic cylinders located in the brake calipers and suspension push-rods to make minute adjustments to the ride height of the car, thereby keeping the ride height at an optimal level throughout the race and providing stability during braking. The FIA initially approved the device as being legal, and several teams, including Ferrari and Williams, submitted plans to the FIA for their own versions of the device before it was banned one week later. The FIA later confirmed that the reactive ride-height systems violated Article 3.15 of the technical regulations, which states that [...] "any <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>effect</b> created by the suspension should be incidental to its primary function" [...] and [...] "any device that influences the car's aerodynamics must remain immobile {{in relation to the}} sprung part of the car" [...] and further noted that the system's primary purpose was achieving aerodynamic gains as opposed to providing stability under braking, and that {{the use of}} reactive ride-heights could also be challenged under Article 10.2 of the technical regulations, which govern suspension systems.|$|E

2500|$|Whenever natural {{fletching}} is used, {{the feathers}} {{on any one}} arrow must {{come from the same}} wing of the bird. The most common being the right-wing flight feathers of turkeys. [...] The slight cupping of natural feathers requires them to be fletched with a right-twist for right wing, a left-twist for left wing. This rotation, through a combination of gyroscopic stabilization and increased drag on the rear of the arrow, helps the arrow to fly straight away. [...] Artificial helical fletchings have the same effect. Most arrows will have three fletches, but some have four or even more.

A comparison is made between measured values of the flutter characteristics and the values calculated using an aerodynamic theory for oscillating wings of finite aspect ratio, and reasonable agreement for flutter speeds and frequencies is obtained. 1.

Extensive wind-tunnel tests have been conducted on a scaled model fin integrated with piezoelectric actuators and accelerometers to measure the afttip vibration responses under various freestream and vortical airflow conditions.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the combined influence of building morphology and trees on air pollutant {{concentrations in the}} Marylebone neighbourhood (central London). Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations are performed with OpenFOAM using the k-ε model. <b>Aerodynamic</b> and deposition <b>effects</b> of Platanus acerifolia trees are considered. While <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>effects</b> are treated as typically done in the literature, i. e. as a porous media, for the deposition an enhanced model with an additional sink term was implemented. CFD results are compared with UK AURN (Automatic Urban and Rural Network) station concentrations. Several meteorological conditions are analysed based on London City Airport weather station data, with attention to prevailing winds. CFD simulations show that trees trap air pollution by up to about 7 % at the Marylebone monitoring station in the spring, autumn and summer seasons, suggesting that the <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>effects</b> are similar over the different leaf seasons. <b>Aerodynamic</b> <b>effects</b> are more important at lower wind speeds causing little turbulent dispersion. Deposition effects {{are found to be}} 4 times less important with reductions of up to about 2 %, with more deposition in summer due to a greater leaf area density. Furthermore, for winds parallel to Marylebone Road, the <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>effects</b> decrease concentrations suggesting that in such cases trees could be considered as a mitigation measures. This is different from perpendicular winds for which trees exacerbate trapping, as found in previous studies. The analysis of concentration levels obtained from CFD simulations across the whole street confirms a beneficial <b>aerodynamic</b> dispersive <b>effect</b> of trees of 0. 7 % in summer time for all wind directions averaged at a wind speed of 5  m/s (yearly average wind speed observed in the area).

50|$|An {{aircraft}} able {{to operate}} for extended periods at supersonic speeds has a potential range advantage over a similar design operating subsonically. Most of the drag an aircraft sees while speeding up to supersonic speeds occurs just below the speed of sound, due to an <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>effect</b> known as wave drag. An aircraft that can accelerate past this speed sees a significant drag decrease, and can fly supersonically with improved fuel economy. However, due to the way lift is generated supersonically, the lift-to-drag ratio of the aircraft as a whole drops, leading to lower range, offsetting or overturning this advantage.|$|E
