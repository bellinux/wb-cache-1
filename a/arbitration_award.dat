25|$|Macleod's tenure saw the 1958 London bus strike. Macleod {{initially}} {{accepted his}} own chief Industrial Commissioner’s Investigation into the busmens' case. Macmillan, {{backed by the}} Cabinet, insisted on settling a separate railwaymen’s strike, despite an <b>arbitration</b> <b>award</b> against them, as {{it was felt that}} they had more public sympathy than the busmen. On the bus issue, Macleod was overruled and forced to pick a fight with Frank Cousins on the pretext that they accept an independent <b>arbitration</b> <b>award.</b>|$|E
25|$|Although it {{is common}} to talk of an <b>arbitration</b> <b>award</b> as a single concept, in most legal jurisdictions there are several sub-categories of award.|$|E

40|$|This article {{provides}} an overview of the nature and scope of judicial review of Olympic and international sports <b>arbitration</b> <b>awards,</b> primarily those rendered by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (based in Lausanne, Switzerland) and their review by the Swiss Federal Tribunal pursuant to the Swiss Federal Code on Private International Law. It also describes and compares U. S. courts 2 ̆ 7 review of international sports <b>arbitration</b> <b>awards</b> pursuant to the United Nations Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards as well as domestic sports <b>arbitration</b> <b>awards.</b> Both Swiss and U. S. courts are permitting CAS <b>arbitration</b> <b>awards</b> to establish a developing body of private international sports law that displaces national laws. The author concludes that this is the appropriate jurisprudential view because it is necessary to have universally accepted legal rules and dispute resolution processes for Olympic and international athletic competition, and for the governance of global sports competition to be fair and equitable on a worldwide basis...|$|R
25|$|Those {{gains were}} short-lived, however. The <b>arbitration</b> <b>award</b> had not {{required}} the employers {{to recognize the}} unions, leading some workers {{to believe that the}} government, not the SLC, was responsible for these improvements in their wages and hours. In addition, the Amalgamated Meat Cutters attempted to claim all of the members as its own, breaking off relations with the SLC. Race riots in Chicago in 1919 dissolved what little trust black packinghouse workers had in white-led unions. Once the <b>arbitration</b> <b>award</b> expired in 1919 employers fired union activists; by 1922, after a failed strike, the SLC was defunct.|$|E

25|$|The <b>arbitration</b> <b>award</b> {{also gave}} longshoremen a raise to ninety-five {{cents an hour}} for {{straight}} time work, just shy of the dollar an hour it demanded during the strike.

25|$|In {{the wake}} of the case, {{commentators}} and courts have remained divided over whether manifest disregard is still available as grounds to vacate an <b>arbitration</b> <b>award.</b> In Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. v.

The next year, 2010, the Eleventh Circuit followed suit in Frazier v. CitiFinancial Corp.|$|E
25|$|When {{it comes}} to {{contracts}} where one party disputed whether it had been properly formed, rather than the validity of a formed contract, the Court {{has been willing to}} let a court decide the issue.

5000|$|<b>Arbitration</b> <b>awards</b> {{enjoy the}} {{protection}} of special treaties.

25|$|In many states, the {{legislature}} has created extra procedures {{in order for}} a mechanics lien to be placed on residential property. In New Jersey, which enacted the strictest of these regulations, a mechanics lien can only be placed on residential property after a Notice of Unpaid Balance and Right to File Lien has been filed within 60 days of the lienor's last date of work and an <b>arbitration</b> <b>award</b> has been issued by an American Arbitration Association arbitrator permitting a mechanics lien to be filed.|$|E
25|$|The {{parties had}} turned to {{arbitration}} to settle a lingering issue from the termination of a lease: whether Mattel was contractually bound to indemnify Hall Street for environmental contamination {{to the site of}} a factory it rented from Hall Street in Beaverton, Oregon until closing it in 2001. The arbitrator had decided that the statute covering the groundwater pollution was primarily a health law, and so ruled that Mattel did not have to pay Hall Street's costs. Since the arbitration agreement had taken the form of an order from a district judge, Mattel and Hall Street had included a provision that the judge could review the <b>arbitration</b> <b>award,</b> he did and the award was reversed. It went back and forth twice between the district court and the Ninth Circuit before the Supreme Court granted certiorari.|$|E

Although his racial discrimination claims were dismissed, he eventually won an <b>arbitration</b> <b>award</b> of US$1.26 million. Fletcher has also been involved in litigation centered on a dispute with the board of The Dakota apartment building in New York City.|$|E
25|$|Because of the {{provisions}} of the New York Convention 1958, <b>arbitration</b> <b>awards</b> are generally easier to enforce in other nations than court verdicts.|$|R
50|$|The other {{characteristic}} of cross-border enforcement of <b>arbitration</b> <b>awards</b> {{that makes them}} appealing to commercial parties {{is that they are}} not limited to awards of damages. Whereas in most countries only monetary judgments are enforceable in the cross-border context, no such restrictions are imposed on <b>arbitration</b> <b>awards</b> and so it is theoretically possible (although unusual in practice) to obtain an injunction or an order for specific performance in an arbitration proceeding which could then be enforced in another New York Convention contracting state.|$|R

500|$|The Tribunal met in Geneva, Switzerland. The U.S. was {{represented}} by Charles Francis Adams, one of five international arbitrators, and was counseled by William M. Evarts, Caleb Cushing, and Morrison R. Waite. On August 25, 1872, the Tribunal awarded United States $15.5million in gold; $1.9 million was awarded to Great Britain. Historian Amos Elwood Corning noted that the Treaty of Washington and arbitration [...] "bequeathed to the world a priceless legacy". In addition to the $15.5million <b>arbitration</b> <b>award,</b> the treaty resolved some disputes over borders and fishing rights. On October 21, 1872 William I, Emperor of Germany, settled a boundary dispute {{in favor of the}} United States.|$|E
500|$|In 1794, Joseph Whidbey, {{master of}} the Discovery during George Vancouver's 1791–95 expedition, {{reported}} that his exploration {{of this part of}} the coast was blocked by a wall of 2 miles (3.2km) width and 1,200 metres (3,900ft)) thick. Vancouver claimed the land for Britain in conflict with an earlier Russian claim, which was resolved by the Anglo-Russian Convention of 1825. The United States purchased Alaska from the Russians in 1867 with a claim under that treaty of owning all lands up to [...] "the summit of the mountains situated parallel to the coast". [...] The United States and Canada agreed that an arbitration board would draw the exact boundary. The <b>arbitration</b> <b>award</b> given in 1903 resolved the Alaska boundary dispute by drawing a line that linked the mountain peaks in this area. Because the agreement froze the exact boundary in 1903, further retreat of the glacier does not alter the boundary as the coast extends northward. As a result, the northern edge of Tarr Inlet is approaching the boundary.|$|E
500|$|On March 22, 2012, a {{forensic}} audit of Alpha Kappa Alpha's 2010 financial records revealed troubling concerns with past president, Barbara McKinzie's development {{and access to}} a [...] "secret" [...] bank account. The audit of the sorority led to findings that supported the claims in the previous lawsuit. The audit also found two former officials continued to use sorority credit cards after their service ended, failing to appropriately document charges. Another lawsuit against the organization, the former president McKinzie and other officials contained similar allegations. The audit found that McKinzie and the other officials secretly created {{a second set of}} financial books to get around the sorority's accounting policies. According to the audit, [...] "(n)early $1.7 million in payments were made to the former president, Barbara McKinzie, without authorization. Approximately $282,000 in credit card charges on a second set of books appear to be fraudulent, including personal charges the sorority wasn't reimbursed for." [...] The sorority later expelled McKinzie and won an <b>arbitration</b> <b>award</b> of $ 1.6 million against her, which (as of January 2017) was challenged by McKinzie in court.|$|E

500|$|In the offseason, Rivera {{lost his}} salary {{arbitration}} case, {{in which he}} requested an annual salary of $9.25million, but arbitrators awarded him [...] $7.25million per year, which {{was at the time}} the highest <b>arbitration</b> <b>award</b> in baseball history. In the 2000 season, Rivera was selected as an All-Star for the third time. On July 8, he saved two games, each played in a different ballpark, as part of a day-night doubleheader against the New York Mets at Shea Stadium and Yankee Stadium. He ended the season with 36saves in 41opportunities and a 2.85ERA. In the postseason, Rivera saved six games, allowed three earned runs in innings pitched, and broke two major league records: he eclipsed Dennis Eckersley's record for postseason saves with the 16th of his career; he also broke Whitey Ford's record for consecutive scoreless innings pitched in postseason play, a streak that ended shortly thereafter at innings. In the 2000 World Series against the Mets, Rivera clinched a championship for his team for the third consecutive year. It was his fourth World Series title overall. By this point, he had established a reputation as an exceptional postseason performer—journalist Jack Curry called him the [...] "infallible weapon" [...] and [...] "the greatest reason the Yankees [...] three-time champions".|$|E
