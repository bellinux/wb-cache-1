5|$|The 6th Airborne Division, {{now with}} the commandos of the 1st Special Service Brigade under command, had to defend the Orne bridgehead.

5|$|One such {{case is a}} genus of shellfish, Lampsilis, which {{feeds on}} the gills of fish in the larval stage of their development. Once they mature, they leave the fish as adult mollusc. Gaining entry into the host is not <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> <b>task</b> though, {{despite the fact that}} several hundred {{thousand}} larvae are released at once. This is especially the case in flowing water bodies such as streams, where they cannot lie on the substrate and wait to be taken up in the course of foraging. Female Lampsilis have evolved a special technique for delivering their offspring into a suitable host, however. Structures {{on the edge of the}} mantle are able to capture the interest of fish. Some resemble small fish themselves, with eye spots, a 'tail' and horizontal stripes, and may even move in a similar fashion, as if facing the current (rheotaxis). When overshadowed by a fish, the larvae are forcefully expelled, becoming ectoparasites on their unsuspecting host.|$|E
5|$|From November 2009 until November 2010, the 173rd Airborne Brigade {{once again}} {{returned}} to Afghanistan, {{this time to}} the provinces of Logar and Wardak. With combat experience already earned in other similar mountain regions in 2007 and 2008, the Brigade distinguished itself in combat regularly against the Taliban and fought tenaciously against them, while still promoting and attempting to legitimize the Afghan government. The 1st and 2nd Battalions saw extensive action in eastern Logar and Wardak. The 1/91st Cavalry was given a mission to transform western Logar province into a secure environment; a mission that was not greeted as <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> <b>task.</b> Given the province and its three major districts saw a massive influx of both foreign and domestic fighters due to the relatively calm winter prior to the brigade's arrival, its company-sized and platoon-sized elements found themselves in combat against anti-Coalition forces almost daily {{from the start of}} March 2010 until its relief. The brigade returned to its home station in Europe in November 2010. Seven soldiers from the brigade lost their lives during the deployment.|$|E

30|$|PC {{testing has}} the added benefit that {{comparing}} two stimuli {{can often be}} <b>an</b> <b>easier</b> <b>task</b> for subjects than providing absolute ratings for two stimuli presented in isolation from each other.

25|$|Increase identifiability: Studies {{of social}} loafing suggest {{that people are}} less {{productive}} when they are working with others, but social facilitation {{studies have shown that}} people are more productive when others are present (at least with <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> <b>task).</b> If individuals within a group know one another, feel that their productivity or inputs are not identifiable, then social loafing is likely to occur. Alternatively, if individuals are anonymous and therefore unidentifiable, then social loafing may also be likely to occur.|$|E
25|$|The Spanish {{garrison}} {{who were}} allowed the honors of war {{but were not}} to fight for a long time, then marched out and the Dutch and English marched in. With the capture of Rheinberg Maurice knew that access over Rhine was now <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> <b>task</b> and the East of the Netherlands was now open to him. Maurice's troops were thus {{able to take the}} offensive further and capture Meurs, Groenlo, Bredevoort, Enschede, Oldenzaal and closed off the year and the campaign with the capture of Lingen.|$|E

25|$|Olowofoyeku {{grew up as}} {{the last}} born of a {{traditional}} extended family in Ilesha. His father had died a few months just before he was born. He had a powerful drive to succeed in spite of daunting challenges of growing up under the old British Colonial System with all its artificial barriers. It was not <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> <b>task,</b> but with a good education obtained through determination and hard work combined with honesty and integrity, he discovered {{that there are no}} actual barriers created by men that could not be overcome.|$|E

They are abducted by a group of barbarians: descendents of farmers, in a cargo cult based on relics of office material, bureaucracy and vague memories of European Union agricultural grants. Alalia and Fratt have to blast their way out and manage to escape before they end up as a sacrifice.|$|E
25|$|Rivero Méndez {{was ordered}} to {{investigate}} the situation in Fajardo. He {{was told that the}} Americans no longer occupied the city {{and that it would be}} <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> <b>task</b> to capture the people of Fajardo who had betrayed Spain. Rivero Méndez passed the information to General Ortega who suggested to General Macías take the town with 200 soldiers and an artillery battery. Macías was told to capture Dr. Veve and all those involved in the revolt, including the Americans in the lighthouse, even it meant the destruction of the lighthouse. Macías refused to accept Ortega's plan.|$|E

25|$|Solving such {{problems}} is actually <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> <b>task</b> {{and it is}} simply to avoid using ASCII format and use binary format instead. Not only it preserves the machine accuracy but also writing and reading to file system is a lot faster. The computational overhead to dump the trajectories becomes negligible and the trajectory files become about two orders of magnitude smaller in size. The downside might be that programming and decoding the data could become very tricky, but once it’s done correctly and with care, the advantages of using binary format are well worth the extra effort. BioMOCA is now equipped with the tools to record the trajectory information in binary format.|$|E
25|$|It is not <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> <b>task</b> {{determining}} {{whether or not}} a bite by any species of snake is life-threatening. A bite by a North American copperhead on the ankle is usually a moderate injury to a healthy adult, but a bite to a child's abdomen or face by the same snake may be fatal. The outcome of all snakebites depends on a multitude of factors: the size, physical condition, and temperature of the snake, the age and physical condition of the person, the area and tissue bitten (e.g., foot, torso, vein or muscle), the amount of venom injected, the time it takes for the person to find treatment, and finally the quality of that treatment.|$|E
25|$|As {{related in}} chapter 2, Loki, under {{the service of}} Odin, found out about Freyja's actions and told Odin. Odin told Loki to get the {{necklace}} {{and bring it to}} him. Loki said that since no one could enter Freyja's bower against her will, this wouldn't be <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> <b>task,</b> yet Odin told him not to come back until he had found a way to get the necklace. Howling, Loki turned away and went to Freyja's bower but found it locked, and that he couldn't enter. So Loki transformed himself into a fly, and after having trouble finding even the tiniest of entrances, he managed to find a tiny hole at the gable-top, yet even here he had to squeeze through to enter.|$|E
50|$|Difficulties {{with the}} {{introduction}} of VLOM have called into question a number of inherent assumptions in the concept relating to the user community, the supporting environment and technology choice.

He {{was told that the}} Americans no longer occupied the city {{and that it would be}} <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> <b>task</b> to capture the people of Fajardo that had betrayed Spain. Rivero Méndez passed the information to General Ricardo de Ortega y Diez who suggested to Governor Macias that they take the town with 200 soldiers and an artillery battery. Macias was told to capture Dr. Santiago Veve Calzada and all those involved in the revolt, including the Americans in the lighthouse even if it meant the destruction of the structure. On August 5, Governor General Macias dispatched Colonel Pedro del Pino and 200 men, including provisional troops and civil guardsmen from San Juan to recapture Fajardo. When the citizenry learned that the Spanish troops were coming, panic and fear ensued among those who had sided with the Americans. The citizen militia was disbanded and the citizens who had joined in the sedition fled to neighboring towns and into the hills. Dr. Veve and several other town leaders went to Amphitrite. Moving by rail from Hato Rey to Carolina and then marching the rest of the way, the Spanish troops entered Fajardo the afternoon of August 7.|$|E

Once the actors had a reference, the cutouts would be removed allowing the cameras to capture the scene. In order for the CG wolves to be {{in sync with the}} live action cameras and actors' movements, the team used match movers, a land surveying tool that recorded the shooting location's topography with reference marks.|$|E
