O experimento consistiu de seis tratamentos e quatro repetições. As variáveis avaliadas foram densidade, álcool, acidez total e volátil, extrato seco, extrato seco reduzido, açúcares redutores, relação álcool em peso/extrato seco reduzido, cinzas, alcalinidade das cinzas, índice de cor (I 420), polifenóis totais (I 280), N total, glicerol, ácido glicônico, minerais (P, K, Ca, Mg, Na, Mn, Fe, Cu, Zn, Rb, Li), compostos voláteis (etanal, acetato de etila, metanol, 1 -propanol, 2 -metil- 1 -propanol, 2 -metil- 1 -butanol e 3 -metil- 1 -butanol). A análise de regressão polinomial que avaliou o efeito da podridão cinzenta da uva na composição físico-química do vinho Gewürztraminer, mostrou que houve efeito linear significativo e positivo em relação à densidade, acidez total e volátil, extrato seco, extrato seco reduzido, açúcares redutores, cinzas, alcalinidade das cinzas, índice de cor (I 420), polifenóis totais (I 280), ácido glicônico, P, K, Ca, Mn, Fe, Rb, etanal e acetato de etila; efeito linear significativo e negativo nas variáveis álcool, relação álcool em peso/extrato seco reduzido, 2 metil- 1 -butanol e 3 -metil- 1 -butanol; efeito quadrático sobre N total, glicerol e metanol; e efeito cúbico sobre Mg, Zn, Li e 1 -propanol.

The aim of {{this work}} was to {{determine}} the effect of grape gray bunch rot, caused by Botrytis cinerea, on the composition of Gewürztraminer (Vitis vinifera L.) wine. The treatments consisted of increasing percentages (in weight) of grape gray bunch rot, i. e., 0, 2. 5, 5, 10, 15, and 20 %. The experiment underwent six treatments and four replications.

40|$|Purpose. The {{scientific}} work {{is dedicated to}} development of scientific-technical bases of production and application of concrete on the basis <b>of</b> <b>ashes</b> <b>of</b> thermal power plants (TPP). Methodology. The properties <b>of</b> TPP <b>ash,</b> {{as well as the}} peculiarities of its behavior in a concrete mix as a fine aggregate, have been studied. It is shown that the hydrolysis and hydration of cement occur in the active environment <b>of</b> <b>ash,</b> which has a huge specific surface area. This significantly affects the course of these processes {{and the quality of the}} concrete produced. A new technology <b>of</b> application <b>of</b> <b>ash</b> <b>of</b> TPP for preparation of concrete mixes is offered. Vibrated and vibrovacuumized concretes of optimum composition from slag and ash, as well as from granite crushed stone and ash, are tested. The chara-cteristics of ordinary concrete (from granite crushed stone and quartz sand) are given to compare. Findings. The results of the tests showed the possibility of obtaining concretes of class C 20 / 25 …C 25 / 30 on the basis <b>of</b> slag and <b>ash</b> <b>of</b> TPP at a limited consumption of cement. It is shown that the concrete with traditional aggregates has a lower strength than the concrete, which has ash as fine aggregate. This research results contribute to the increased use <b>of</b> <b>ash</b> in construction that solves the problem of aggregates as well as thermal power plants waste recycling. Originality. New method and technology of application <b>of</b> TPP <b>ashes</b> in concrete are developed. Ash concrete mix has rational flowability, which produces the greatest strength <b>of</b> <b>ash</b> vacuum concrete. This strength is twice or more as large as the strength <b>of</b> vibrated <b>ash</b> concrete mix with flowability S 1. Practical value. The physico-chemical properties <b>of</b> TPP <b>ash</b> as aggregate for concrete are presented. Significant difference <b>of</b> <b>ash</b> from ordinary aggregates is shown. Chemical activity <b>of</b> the <b>ash</b> is justified. The special conditions of cement hardening in the case <b>of</b> using <b>ash</b> as aggregate for concrete are presented. The advantages <b>of</b> <b>ash</b> over traditional aggregate are shown. The research results contribute to the mass application <b>of</b> TPP <b>ash</b> in construction and obtaining the products from the proposed concrete of low cost with high physical-mechanical properties.
