5|$|The author {{believes}} that determinations {{of what should}} be censored from whom should not {{be made by the}} government, stressing that a society must ensure that there is a tangible negative impact on youth from certain material before imposing censorship. She writes that it becomes incredibly difficult to characterize specifically what should and should not be censored, resulting in negative overreaching consequences of censorship. Heins <b>advises</b> <b>the</b> impact on society from censorship could be so great that censors should be sure there is real actual harm rather than imagined harm prior to enacting restrictive laws regulating indecency or the Internet.|$|E

When raising a flag to be flown at half-mast, it should first be raised {{to the top of}} the pole and then lowered to a point where the distance between the top of the flag and the top of the pole is one third of the length of the pole. When lowering the flag from half-mast, it should first be raised to the peak of the pole before it is lowered.|$|E

5|$|The {{members of}} the Presidential Council are not elected, but {{appointed}} by the President on advice of the Cabinet. No public nomination process or vote is stipulated in the Constitution. The President, {{if he does not}} concur with the Cabinet, may veto the appointment. However, he is required to consult the Council of Presidential Advisers ("CPA"), a constitutional body that <b>advises</b> <b>the</b> President on appointments of key public officials and matters relating to Singapore's financial reserves. If he exercises his veto without the CPA's concurrence, Parliament may overrule his decision with a resolution passed with a two-thirds majority vote. The President has no power to remove current members.|$|E
5|$|Further, {{he points}} out that the {{language}} used by the Beowulf poet was already archaic, and the choice of words was at the time recognisably poetic. Tolkien gives as an example beorn, which meant both 'bear' and 'warrior', but only in heroic poetry could it be used to mean 'man'. He <b>advises</b> <b>the</b> translator to prefer 'striking' and 'smiting', and to avoid 'hitting' and 'whacking'. But on the other hand, he criticises William Morris for using the dead and unintelligible 'leeds' for OE leode ('freemen', 'people'; cf German leute), even if antiquarians feel that the word ought to have survived. Tolkien does not accept the etymological fallacy either: mod means 'pride', not 'mood'; burg is 'stronghold', not 'borough', even though the modern word derives from the old one.|$|E
5|$|In her dream, Trijata sees Rama and {{his brother}} Lakshmana riding the {{celestial}} elephant Airavata toward Sita. Rama takes Sita in his lap and rises high in the sky, allowing Sita to touch the Sun and the Moon. Then the trio ride to Lanka {{and get into the}} Pushpaka Vimana (aerial chariot of Ravana) to fly towards the north, while Ravana, drenched in oil and with a red complexion, lies on the ground. Ravana then heads south on a donkey and falls in a pit of dung. A black woman in a red saree, drags him to the south. Other members of Ravana's family, like his brother Kumbhakarna and son Indrajit, face similar fates. Ravana's brother Vibishana is seen in regal white garments, riding a four tusked elephant near the Pushpaka Vimana. The city of Lanka drowns in the ocean and a monkey (vanara) messenger of Rama burns the city. Trijata <b>advises</b> <b>the</b> rakshasis to take refuge in Sita and apologize to her; in turn, Sita promises that if Trijata's dream materializes, she will protect her rakshasi guards.|$|E

5|$|Scar {{debuted in}} The Lion King (1994). The jealous younger brother of Mufasa, Scar was next-in-line {{to take the}} throne until his nephew Simba, Mufasa's son, was born, {{replacing}} him. Determined to usurp the throne and become king himself, Scar devises a plan to kill both Simba and Mufasa. Cleverly trapping Simba in a vast gorge, Scar signals his hyena minions, Shenzi, Banzai and Ed, to trigger a wildebeest stampede. Although Mufasa saves Simba, the king is weakened, and unable {{to climb out of}} the gorge to safety. When Mufasa begs Scar for help, Scar instead throws his brother to his death below. Convincing Simba that he is to blame for Mufasa's death, Scar <b>advises</b> <b>the</b> prince to run away and never return, then orders the hyenas to pursue and kill him. With his brother murdered and his nephew presumed dead, Scar returns to Pride Rock and tells the pride that both father and son are dead before becoming king.|$|E
5|$|The move 4.Nf3 {{develops}} a piece and covers the sensitive d2-square. After 4...Bb4+ 5.Nbd2Nc6 6.a3 Black can easily get {{confused by the}} move-order. The natural 6...Nxd2 7.Bxd2 Bxd2+ 8.Qxd2 Qe7 9.Qc3 transposes {{in the same position}} as after 5.Bd2, but White can also try 6...Nxd2 7.axb4! Nxf3+ 8.gxf3 Nxe5 9.Rg1 Qe7 10.Ra3! with a strong initiative. White can even retain his bishop with 6...Nxd2 7.Nxd2 and now Borik recommends 7...Bf8 with difficult play for Black as he is not certain to gain his pawn back. To avoid these possibilities Lalic <b>advises</b> <b>the</b> move-order 6...Bxd2+ 7.Bxd2 Nxd2 8.Qxd2 Qe7, but does not mention the possibility of White answering 6...Bxd2+ with 7.Nxd2. A possible improvement for Black (after 4...Bb4+ 5.Nbd2) would be 5...d5 with compensation for the pawn in all lines.|$|E
