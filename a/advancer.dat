"For one," [...] {{continued}} the cosmopolitan, grandly swelling his chest, [...] "I hold {{the press to}} be neither the people's improvisatore, nor Jack Cade; neither their paid fool, nor conceited drudge. I think interest never prevails with it over duty. The press still speaks for truth though impaled, {{in the teeth of}} lies though intrenched. Disdaining for it the poor name of cheap diffuser of news, I claim for it the independent apostleship of <b>Advancer</b> of Knowledge:--the iron Paul! Paul, I say; for not only does the press advance knowledge, but righteousness. In the press, as in the sun, resides, my dear Charlie, a dedicated principle of beneficent force and light. For the Satanic press, by its coappearance with the apostolic, it is no more an aspersion to that, than to the true sun is the coappearance of the mock one. For all the baleful-looking parhelion, god Apollo dispenses the day. In a word, Charlie, what the sovereign of England is titularly, I hold the press to be actually--Defender of the Faith!--defender of the faith in the final triumph of truth over error, metaphysics over superstition, theory over falsehood, machinery over nature, and the good man over the bad. Such are my views, which, if stated at some length, you, Charlie, must pardon, for it is a theme upon which I cannot speak with cold brevity. And now I am impatient for your panegyric, which, I doubt not, will put mine to the blush." ...|$|E

6000|$|There {{is another}} point {{concerning}} {{which it is}} very necessary to have clear ideas. Suppose a carpenter in Lanzerote {{to be engaged in}} making chests of drawers. Let us suppose that a, the timber, and b, the grain and meat needful for the man's sustenance until he can finish a chest of drawers, have to be paid for by that chest. Then the capital with which he starts is represented by a + b. He could not start at all unless he had it; day by day, he must destroy more or less of the substance and of the general adaptability of a in order to work it up into the special forms needed to constitute the chest of drawers; and, day by day, he must use up at least so much of b as will replace his loss of vital capital by the work of that day. Suppose it takes the carpenter and his workmen ten days to saw up the timber, to plane the boards, and to give them the shape and size proper for the various parts of the chest of drawers. And suppose that he then offers his heap of boards to the <b>advancer</b> of a + b as an equivalent for the wood + ten days' supply of vital capital? The latter will surely say: [...] "No. [167] I did not ask for a heap of boards. I asked for a chest of drawers. Up to this time, so far as I am concerned, you have done nothing and are as much in my debt as ever." [...] And if the carpenter maintained that he had [...] "virtually" [...] created two-thirds of a chest of drawers, inasmuch as it would take only five days more to put together the pieces of wood, and that the heap of boards ought to be accepted as the equivalent of two-thirds of his debt, I am afraid the creditor would regard him as little better than an impudent swindler. It obviously makes no sort of difference whether the Canariote or Teneriffian buyer advanced the wood and the food-stuffs, on which the carpenter had to maintain himself; or whether the carpenter had a stock of both, the consumption of which must be recouped by the exchange of a chest of drawers for a fresh supply. In the latter case, it is even less doubtful that, if the carpenter offered his boards to the man who wanted a chest of drawers, the latter would laugh in his face. And if he took the chest of drawers for himself, then so much of his vital capital would be sunk in it past recovery. Again, the payment of goods in a lump, for the chest of drawers, comes to the same thing as the payment of daily wages for the fifteen days that the carpenter was occupied in making it. If, {{at the end of each}} day, the carpenter chose to say to himself [...] "I have 'virtually' created, by my day's labour, a fifteenth of what I shall get for the chest [168] of drawers--therefore my wages are the produce of my day's labour"--there is no great harm in such metaphorical speech, so long as the poor man does not delude himself into the supposition that it represents the exact truth. [...] "Virtually" [...] is apt to cover more intellectual sins than [...] "charity" [...] does moral delicts. After what has been said, it surely must be plain enough that each day's work has involved the consumption of the carpenter's vital capital, and the fashioning of his timber, at the expense of more or less consumption of those forms of capital. Whether the a + b to be exchanged for the chest has been advanced as a loan, or is paid daily or weekly as wages, or, at some later time, as the price of a finished commodity--the essential element of the transaction, and the only essential element, is, that it must, at least, effect the replacement of the vital capital consumed. Neither boards nor chest of drawers are eatable; and, so far from the carpenter having produced the essential part of his wages by each day's labour, he has merely wasted that labour, unless somebody who happens to want a chest of drawers offers to exchange vital capital, or something that can procure it, equivalent to the amount consumed during the process of manufacture.* ...|$|E

50|$|A variant {{developed}} by Kit Woolsey and Steve Robinson {{uses the same}} responses as Multi-Landy (above) but also includes a pinpoint double. A double would show a 4-card major and a 5-card or longer minor, a constructive 6-card or longer single-suited minor, or a hand of 19 high card points or more. After 2, <b>advancer</b> would bid 2 to show equal length in the majors and ask overcaller to bid their better suit. After 2, <b>advancer</b> would respond 2 to ask overcaller to pass or correct. <b>Advancer</b> would bid 2 showing non-forcing values in spades but invitational values for hearts. <b>Advancer</b> would bid 2NT with a forcing hand asking for further description of overcallers hand. <b>Advancer</b> would bid 3 with invitational values in both majors. 3 or 4 are pass or correct at that level.|$|E
50|$|<b>Advancer</b> now has {{to assess}} what the joint holding is; Partner likely has {{stopping}} values in Hearts, but anyway partner's length assures the Heart suit is safe. Provided that <b>Advancer</b> has stopping values in the other three suits in his own holding (bearing in mind that partner may not have stopping values in Diamonds, merely 4-card length, the only question for <b>Advancer</b> {{is whether or not}} the HCP holding for the partnership is strong enough for 3NT.|$|E
5000|$|Following the two-suited overcalls, <b>advancer</b> will bid {{taking into}} account that out of the two {{possible}} two-suited hands of intervenor, the likely holding is in advancer's shortest suits. The responses are therefore convertible. For instance, following a CRASH double, an <b>advancer</b> holding [...] will start from the assumption that intervenor holds length in the black suits in which advancer's maximum length is three cards, rather than in the red suits in which his maximum length is five cards. <b>Advancer</b> will therefore bid 2, his best black suit. Intervenor will pass holding the black suits, or bid 3 holding the red suits. In case of the latter, <b>advancer</b> will correct to 3 since that is his best red suit.|$|E

Some were condensing air into a dry tangible substance, by extracting the nitre, and letting the aqueous or fluid particles percolate; others softening marble, for pillows and pin-cushions; others petrifying the hoofs of a living horse, to preserve them from foundering. The artist himself was at that time busy upon two great designs; the first, to sow land with chaff, wherein he affirmed the true seminal virtue to be contained, as he demonstrated by several experiments, which I was not skilful enough to comprehend. The other was, by a certain composition of gums, minerals, and vegetables, outwardly applied, to prevent the growth of wool upon two young lambs; and he hoped, in a reasonable time to propagate the breed of naked sheep, all over the kingdom.|$|R
