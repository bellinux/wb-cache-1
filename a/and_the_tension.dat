Sarah was kept in all of her offices – purely for the sake of her husband's position as Captain-General of the army – <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>tension</b> between the two women lingered on until early in 1711.

5|$|At {{one stop}} on the book tour {{associated}} with the publication and release of the book at the David A. Clarke School of Law of the University of the District of Columbia, Jackson's message was perceived as saying that American history can be studied as an analysis of race, but that economics <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>tension</b> between states’ rights and federal rights are the true basis of a domestic history revolving around pursuit of economic development, political power, and personal freedom. He then advanced the theory that these pursuits would most be most readily attained by adopting a set of new constitutional amendments, guaranteeing rights primarily grounded in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which the U.S. has ratified. Each is discussed in a separate chapter: the rights to quality health care, housing, education, a clean environment, fair taxes, full employment, equality for women, {{and the right to}} vote.|$|E
5|$|Historian Carl Sferrazza Anthony {{noted that}} {{ordinary}} citizens responded to Nixon. When {{a group of}} rural people visited the White House to present a quilt to the First Lady, many were overcome with nervousness; upon hearing their weeping, Pat hugged each individual tightly, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>tension</b> dissipated. When a young boy doubted that the Executive Mansion was her house {{because he could not}} see the washing machine, Pat led him through the halls and up an elevator, into the family quarters and the laundry room. She mixed well with people of different races, and made no distinctions on that basis. During the Nixons' trip to China in 1972, foreign minister Zhou En-lai was suffienciently smitten with her so as to give two rare giant pandas to the ambassador as a gift from China.|$|E

Abraham was greatly distressed but God told Abraham to do as his wife commanded because God's promise would be carried out through both Isaac and Ishmael.|$|E

Different drum sounds have different uses in music. Take, for example, the modern Tom-tom drum. A jazz drummer may want drums that are high pitched, resonant and quiet whereas a rock drummer may prefer drums that are loud, dry and low-pitched. Since these drummers want different sounds, their drums are constructed and tuned differently.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the lead}} of Frances Power Cobbe, Lind af Hageby {{regarded}} feminism and animal rights (and, in particular, vegetarianism), as strongly linked, seeing the advance of women as essential to civilization, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>tension</b> between women and male scientists as a battle between feminism and machismo. Craig Buettinger writes that feminism and anti-vivisection were strongly linked in the UK, where the comparison between the treatment of woman and animals {{at the hands of}} male scientists (and, indeed, their husbands) dominated the discourse. But in the United States, the antivisectionists based their need to protect animals on their duties as mothers and Christians, and did not see advancing women's rights as part of that.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, dance music saw more {{exposure}} at rock music festivals like Glastonbury and Reading. Raves, many illegal, {{continued to be}} organised <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>tension</b> caused by police attention, new putative legislation aimed at organisers, and the increase of harder music, led many dance music fans to return to legal night clubs, where rave music {{had given way to}} progressive house. Other clubs emerged to play the ever-splintering genres associated with the house music and rave scene, including hardcore techno, downtempo and trance, drum and bass and happy hardcore. The Bristol scene saw the development of trip hop, which mixed house and hip hop producing successful bands such as Massive Attack and Portishead. The 1990s also saw the development and refinement of IDM (Intelligent Dance Music), which borrowed from forms such as techno, drum and bass, and acid house music and introduced more abstract elements, including heavy use of digital signal processing. Among the most commercially successful products of these scenes were acts like The Prodigy, Chemical Brothers and Fat Boy Slim.|$|E

USE - Clamping element for shrink tensioning of bodies of a drilling tool. ADVANTAGE - The element allows reliable clamping of bodies of larger circumference. The circular joint element is arranged between <b>the</b> base body <b>and</b> <b>the</b> closed <b>tension</b> ring <b>and</b> is fixed to both <b>the</b> base <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>tensioning</b> ring, thus flexibly receiving differences in a radial thermal expansion produced between <b>the</b> base body <b>and</b> <b>the</b> closed <b>tension</b> ring, so as to limit the heating of <b>the</b> <b>tension</b> ring. <b>The</b> circular geometry of the joint element increases stability of clamping in radial direction, thus preventing undesired lateral slipping during loading by process forces.

25|$|Scenes of Clerical Life is {{the title}} under which George Eliot's first {{published}} work of fiction, a collection of three short stories, was released in book form; {{it was the first}} of her works to be released under her famous pseudonym. The stories were first published in Blackwood's Magazine over the course of the year 1857, initially anonymously, before being released as a two-volume set by Blackwood and Sons in January 1858. The three stories are set during the last twenty years of the eighteenth century and the first half of the nineteenth century over a fifty year period. The stories take place in and around the fictional town of Milby in the English Midlands. Each of the Scenes concerns a different Anglican clergyman, but is not necessarily centred upon him. Eliot examines, among other things, the effects of religious reform <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>tension</b> between the Established and the Dissenting Churches on the clergymen and their congregations, and draws attention to various social issues, such as poverty, alcoholism, and domestic violence.|$|E
25|$|Almost {{immediately}} after the conclusion of peace Louis renewed his aggressions on the German frontier through the Réunions policy. Engaged in a serious struggle with the Ottoman Empire, the emperor was again slow to move, and although he joined the Association League against France in 1682 {{he was glad to}} make a truce at Regensburg two years later. In 1686 the League of Augsburg was formed by the emperor and the imperial princes, to preserve the terms of the treaties of Westphalia and of Nijmegen. The whole European position was now bound up with events in England, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>tension</b> lasted until 1688, when William III of Orange won the English crown through the Glorious Revolution and Louis invaded Germany. In May 1689, the Grand Alliance was formed, including the emperor, the kings of England, Spain and Denmark, the elector of Brandenburg and others, and a fierce struggle against France was waged throughout almost the whole of western Europe. In general the several campaigns were favourable to the allies, and in September 1697, England, Spain and the United Provinces made peace with France at the Treaty of Rijswijk.|$|E

500|$|The {{papillary}} muscles {{extend from}} {{the walls of the}} heart to valves by cartilaginous connections called chordae tendinae. These muscles prevent the valves from falling too far back when they close.

As the heart chambers contract, so do the papillary muscles.

IGN noted that with the player's followers automatically going about daily life, the replay value was lowered even with the multiplayer options.

500|$|While {{she worked}} on the film, she also began {{producing}} her next album, writing new music, and teaming with new collaborators.

[...] Beck then introduces the melody line on electric guitar with a fuzz-tone effect producing indefinite sustain; alternating between major and minor modes, it is described as [...] "haunting" [...] by Power and as a [...] "distinctive piercing, sinister tone" [...] by critic Richie Unterberger. [...] In the second section, the piano, bass, and drums come in <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>tension</b> builds. [...] Unterberger describes the third section as [...] "suddenly set off from the main motif into a beautiful serene section highlighting slide-glissando guitars", with Beck's echo-laden slide sounding similar to a steel guitar. [...] The fourth section returns to the main melody with overlaid drawn-out descending slide. According to Beck, [...] "the phasing was Jimmy's idea... I played a load of waffle and he reversed it". The tension mounts as Moon adds drum flourishes, climaxing with a break.|$|E
