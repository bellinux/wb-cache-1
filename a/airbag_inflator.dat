50|$|The first {{motorcycle}} crash {{tests with}} an airbag were performed in 1973 and proved that airbag systems could be advantageous to a rider. These tests were followed up by {{tests in the}} 1990s that showed airbag devices could not fully restrain a rider when traveling more than 30 mi/h km/h, but still reduced a rider's velocity {{and his or her}} trajectory. Honda has recently developed a fuel tank mounted airbag for the Goldwing model that takes just 0.15 seconds to deploy. Crash sensors in the front wheel send data to the airbag ECU (electronic control unit) which in turn activates the <b>airbag</b> <b>inflator.</b> The airbag then takes the force of the rider.|$|E
5000|$|The {{signals from}} the various sensors are fed into the Airbag control unit, which determines from them the angle of impact, the severity, or force of the crash, along with other variables. Depending on the result of these calculations, the ACU may also deploy various {{additional}} restraint devices, such as seat belt pre-tensioners, and/or airbags (including frontal bags for driver and front passenger, along with seat-mounted side bags, and [...] "curtain" [...] airbags which cover the side glass). Each restraint device is typically activated {{with one or more}} pyrotechnic devices, commonly called an initiator or electric match. The electric match, which consists of an electrical conductor wrapped in a combustible material, activates with a current pulse between 1 and 3 amperes in less than 2 milliseconds. When the conductor becomes hot enough, it ignites the combustible material, which initiates the gas generator. In a seat belt pre-tensioner, this hot gas is used to drive a piston that pulls the slack out of the seat belt. In an airbag, the initiator is used to ignite solid propellant inside the <b>airbag</b> <b>inflator.</b> The burning propellant generates inert gas which rapidly inflates the airbag in approximately 20 to 30 milliseconds. An airbag must inflate quickly in order to be fully inflated by the time the forward-traveling occupant reaches its outer surface. Typically, the decision to deploy an airbag in a frontal crash is made within 15 to 30 milliseconds after the onset of the crash, and both the driver and passenger airbags are fully inflated within approximately 60-80 milliseconds after the first moment of vehicle contact. If an airbag deploys too late or too slowly, the risk of occupant injury from contact with the inflating airbag may increase. Since more distance typically exists between the passenger and the instrument panel, the passenger airbag is larger and requires more gas to fill it.|$|E

40|$|Currently, {{almost all}} new {{vehicles}} {{are equipped with}} airbags. A common type of <b>airbag</b> <b>inflator</b> is the Heated Gas Inflator (HGI). These inflators are cylindrical shaped canisters that are filled to very high pressures with a gaseous mixture of fuel and air. The mixture is ignited from one or {{both ends of the}} cylinder. The resulting high temperatures from combustion heats the excess air, which is then used to inflate the airbag. Once the mixture is ignited, large pressure waves form, traveling {{along the length of the}} tube. These waves, inherent to the design of the inflator, do not allow the use of a volume averaged assumption for the combustion chamber. Therefore, it is necessary to use a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) code to model the dynamic nature of the inflator. Commercial CFD codes are readily available that could be used to model the HGI. These codes use the Ideal Gas Law to calculate the properties of the mixture. The high pressures in an HGI do allow for the use of an ideal gas assumption. Instead, a Real Gas equation of state must be used. An existing <b>Airbag</b> <b>Inflator</b> Model that was capable of Real Gas equation of state calculations had been previously created to simulate solid propellant inflators. In order to properly model the wave dynamics in an HGI and include Real Gas calculations, a CFD model has been added to the <b>Airbag</b> <b>Inflator</b> Model. The CFD model must be capable of handling multiple species of gases and be able to properly model the sharp gradients associated with large pressure waves and changes in chemical species. Therefore, a high-resolution shock capturing technique is used to handle the homogeneous part of the governing equations. The non-homogeneous terms of the governing equations are solved using an ordinary differential equations solver. In order to combine the solutions, a time splitting technique is used to combine the solutions from the homogeneous and non-homogeneous parts of the governing equations. The addition of the CFD model to an <b>Airbag</b> <b>Inflator</b> Model with Real Gas equation of state capabilities provides a very useful tool in the design of HGIs. The model can be used to ensure that a design does not produce unexpected large magnitude pressure waves that could possibly cause dangerous mechanical failures. Later models of HGIs have ignitors at each end of the cylinder. The secondary ignitor can be delayed to vary the production rate of the exhaust gasses, depending on the severity of the crash. This time delay is an additional parameter that can have an effect on the wave dynamics in the HGI. The addition of the CFD model to the <b>Airbag</b> <b>Inflator</b> Model provides a fast and economical way to predict the outcome of any change in the design parameters of an HGI...|$|E

The mostly effective as stabilizers are the compounds that have rather close crystallographic parameters. A strong donor-acceptor interaction between nitrate-anion and organic molecules are found. Using quantum-chemical calculations, X-ray analysis, X-ray phase analysis, UV- and IR-spectroscopy it was found a new ammonium nitrate phase state in its alloy with some organic additives.

5000|$|Pyroshock, {{also known}} as {{pyrotechnic}} shock, is the dynamic structural shock that occurs when an explosion or impact occurs on a structure. Davie and Bateman describe it as: [...] "Pyroshock is the response of a structure to high frequency (thousands of hertz), high-magnitude stress waves that propagate throughout the structure {{as a result of}} an explosive event such as an explosive charge to separate two stages of a multistage rocket." [...] It is of particular relevance to the defense and aerospace industries in that they utilize many vehicles and/or components that use explosive devices to accomplish mission tasks. Examples include rocket stage separation, missile payload deployment, pilot ejection, automobile <b>airbag</b> <b>inflators,</b> etc. Of significance is the survival and integrity of the equipment after the explosive device has activated so that the vehicle can accomplish its task. There are examples of flight vehicles Boeing-The Aerospace Corp which have crashed after a routine explosive device deployment, the cause of the crash being determined as be a result of a computer failure due to the explosive device. The resultant energies are often high g-force and high frequency which can cause problems for electronic components which have small items with resonant frequencies near those induced by the pyroshock.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Incidental {{falls from}} heights, {{falls on the}} same level caused by {{slipping}} or tripping, and falls from wheelchair overturns are commonplace phenomena, associated with serious injuries from impact with the ground. A wearable airbag device is a countermeasure applicable to all these types of incidents. Three types of wearable airbag systems were developed and evaluated: for protection against falls from heights (Type- 1), against wheelchair overturns (Type- 2), and against falls {{on the same level}} (Type- 3). The systems consist of an <b>airbag,</b> sensor, <b>inflator,</b> and jacket. The sensor detects the fall and the airbag inflates to protect the user. Fall tests using dummies with/without the airbags demonstrated the effectiveness of these devices. In the experiments with system Type- 1, for fall heights of less than 2 m, the airbags reduced the impact acceleration, and the Head Injury Criterion (HIC) values were under 1, 000, the auto-crash test requirement. However, there are limits to the amount of protection afforded: in Type- 1, the airbag can protect only the back of the head.; in Types- 2 and 3, the fall height of the center of gravity is lower than 2 m, and there is some margin of extra protective resource, which can be used to extend the protected area...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Mechanical EngineeringMass transit bus {{is one of}} the key {{modes of}} transportation, {{especially}} in highly populated areas of the United States (US). Review of literature has shown that there is very little research, which focuses on the safety and comfort of a bus operator. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has a Fatal Accident Reporting System (FARS). FARS shows that there were 300 fatal bus accidents during the period from 1995 to 1999. Statistical data also shows that 16 bus operators suffered fatal injuries during the period from 1991 to 2000. The operators end up driving for long duration of time, which makes the three-point type of belt restraint system uncomfortable. This may also lead to stress and fatigue. The use of a two-point seat belt restraint system may be more comfortable for the operator since his hands and torso will be unrestrained. However, the physical sled testing of this seat belt configuration revealed severe life threatening risk for the operator. It was observed that the Head Injury Criteria (HIC 15) value was above the threshold limit of 700 and the femur load value was well over their allowable threshold limit of 10, 000 N. The Neck Injury Criteria (Nij) value was very close to the allowable threshold limit of 1. Thus, safety and comfort of the transit bus operator appear to be contradictory to each other. In this research, an effort had been made to develop a methodology to design an airbag restraint system for a mass transit bus operator, which can satisfy the two contradictory objectives. An Inflatable lap belt type of airbag restraint system has been previously implemented in aircraft safety. This system is comprised of a two-point restraint type seat belt system with an airbag embedded in it. This type of airbag safety system was tested in this study for a mass transit bus operator with an aim to keep the HIC and the Nij values within allowable limits. Additional knee-padding was designed to minimize the femur loads. All of the research was conducted for frontal impact of a bus with the rigid-wall crash condition. A model development of a two-point restraint type seat belt system was carried out with the occupant simulation code, MADYMO. This model is validated with the help of physical sled test data. The baseline simulation model was used to develop the numerical model of an inflatable lap belt airbag restraint system. With the help of numerical models, the prototypes of <b>airbag</b> and <b>inflators</b> were manufactured. A physical sled test was also carried out for this system under frontal impact condition. This test data was utilized to validate the simulation results obtained from the MADYMO model. The physical sled testing as well as numerical models were developed for the three-point belt restraint system. Except the femur injury, all of the injuries were within the allowable safe limit. A physical sled test with the airbag and the knee-padding was also conducted to test the performance of an inflatable lap belt airbag restraint system. A knee-padding played a vital role to minimize the femur injury. The Results from this study can be utilized in the design and development of a safety belt system for optimal protection of mass transit bus operators in the event of a frontal impact crashes. This study can be utilized further for designing the safety restraint system for other crash conditions...|$|R
