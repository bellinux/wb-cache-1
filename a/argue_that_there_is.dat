5|$|Several {{scholars}} <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> no one High Priest who is {{the strongest}} candidate for identification {{with each of the}} Wicked Priest passages. The different demises of the Wicked Priest and the tenses associated with them are often cited as evidence of the impossibility of a single Wicked Priest.|$|E
5|$|During the 1930s–1950s {{heyday of}} the big Hollywood studios, {{the status of women}} in the {{industry}} was abysmal and, while much has improved, many would <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> still much to be done. From art films by Sally Potter, Catherine Breillat, Claire Denis and Jane Campion to action movies by Kathryn Bigelow, women now have a stronger voice, but are only too aware of the still lingering gender gap.|$|E
5|$|Free {{hydrochloric}} acid was first formally {{described in the}} 16th century by Libavius, who prepared it by heating salt in clay crucibles. Other authors claim that pure {{hydrochloric acid}} was first discovered by the German Benedictine monk Basil Valentine in the 15th century, when he heated common salt and green vitriol, whereas others <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> no clear reference to the preparation of pure hydrochloric acid {{until the end of}} the 16th century.|$|E

5|$|Others <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> no {{available}} evidence that demonstrates {{that any of}} these organisms are capable of causing aphthous stomatitis by themselves. Some people with aphthous stomatitis may show herpes virus within the epithelium of the mucosa, but without any productive infection. In some persons, attacks of ulceration occur {{at the same time as}} asymptomatic viral shedding and elevated viral titres. However, antiviral medication has no effect on aphthous stomatitis.|$|E
5|$|With O'Sullivan, Hadley has {{conducted}} research on utilitarianism {{and the relationship}} between obligations to animals and obligations to needy humans. The scholars <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a conflict in Singer's philosophy between the obligation to aid needy humans and to protect animals, and that Westerners who own pets should, rather than spending large amounts of money extending the lives of their companions, euthanise severely ill animals and instead donate money to aiding those in the developing world.|$|E
5|$|The boys of South Park Elementary School are anxiously {{awaiting}} the night's episode of Terrance and Phillip, {{which ended in}} a cliffhanger last season, while the girls at the school express disgust over the show and the boys' obsession with fart jokes. Cartman retaliates by farting in a little girl's face, which causes all the boys to laugh. After school, the boys gather in Cartman's house to watch the episode. To their horror, it is then revealed that, as an April Fools Day joke, the channel is airing a new show called the Queef Sisters, about Canadian sisters Katherine (voiced by Trey Parker) and Katie Queef (voiced by Matt Stone). They {{are very similar to}} Terrance and Phillip, but instead of fart jokes, they make queef jokes. The show starts a queefing movement across the country, and men everywhere get upset and disgusted by the queefs, although the women do not understand what the problem is. Though the women of South Park <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> no difference between queefing and farting, the men are revolted by queefs, while still finding their own fart jokes amusing.|$|E

25|$|Authors such as Alyssa Rower and Samantha Slark <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a {{case for}} legalizing {{polygamy}} {{on the basis of}} regulation and monitoring of the practice, legally protecting the polygamous partners and allowing them to join mainstream society instead of forcing them to hide from it when any public situation arises.|$|E

25|$|The {{subject has}} {{attracted}} the attention of various scholars and critics, who have analysed why this form of low art has reached iconic status. Though it may be considered frivolous, cat-related internet content contributes to how people interact with media and culture. Some <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a depth and complexity to this seemingly simple content, with a suggestion that the positive psychological effects that pet animals have on their owners also holds true for cat images viewed online.|$|E
25|$|Thus {{even though}} both lines begin {{with a series of}} long syllables, it is {{immediately}} obvious on reading them that the first is iambic and second trochaic. Those who <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> no ictus say that, given that there is generally a word-break (caesura) after the 5th element of the iambic senarius, the word accents tend to fall naturally on the second and fourth elements rather than on the anceps elements. In the final metron, there is often a clash between ictus and accent.|$|E
25|$|Certain drugs, {{including}} both prescribed and recreational drugs are thought {{by some to}} cause the development of bruxism, however others <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> insufficient evidence to draw such a conclusion. Examples may include dopamine agonists, dopamine antagonists, tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, alcohol, cocaine, and amphetamines (including those taken for medical reasons). In some reported cases where bruxism {{is thought to have}} been initiated by selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, decreasing the dose resolved the side effect. Other sources state that reports of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors causing bruxism are rare, or only occur with long-term use.|$|E
