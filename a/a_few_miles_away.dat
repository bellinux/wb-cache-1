The next morning, Muhammad sent out a small force to harass the Meccan army on their way home. According to Watt, this was because Muhammad realized that a show of force was required to speed the Meccans away from Medinan territory. The Meccans, not wanting to be perceived as being chased away, remained nearby for a few days before leaving.|$|E

5|$|The Crosby Garrett Helmet is {{a copper}} alloy Roman cavalry helmet {{dating from the}} late 2nd or early 3rd century AD. It was found by an unnamed metal detectorist near Crosby Garrett in Cumbria, England, in May 2010.

It is possible that the owner of the helmet was a local inhabitant who had served with the Roman cavalry.|$|E

5|$|The assault at Zeebrugge <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>miles</b> <b>away</b> from Ostend {{was more}} {{successful}} and the blocking {{of the major}} channel did cause some consternation amongst the German forces in Bruges. The larger raiders could no longer leave the port, but smaller ships, including most submarines, were still able to traverse via Ostend. In addition, within hours a narrow channel had also been carved through Zeebrugge too, although British intelligence did not realise this for several weeks. The defeat at Ostend did not entirely dampen the exuberant British media and public reaction to Zeebrugge, but in the Admiralty {{and particularly in the}} Allied Naval and Marine Forces the failure to completely neutralise Bruges rankled.|$|E

50|$|Due {{largely in}} part to its age and {{location}} on the fault line and consequently {{as a result of}} the dilapidated buildings and approval by the tax payers, a new Woodlawn High School was constructed <b>a</b> <b>few</b> short <b>miles</b> <b>away</b> on <b>a</b> 57 acre site. The new school opened its doors in 2003 and became the first new school to open in the parish in 30 years.

5|$|The script {{demanded a}} dry location: an {{agricultural}} village {{where it had}} not rained in several years. To depict the 1890s era, the crew also required a village which lacked electricity, communication and automobiles. Kutch faced the same problems {{at that time and}} hence the village of Kunariya, located <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>miles</b> <b>away</b> from Bhuj, was chosen. During the filming of Lagaan, it did not rain at all in the region. However, a week after the shoot finished, it rained heavily bringing relief to Bhuj, which had a lean monsoon the previous year. The typical old Kutch hamlet was built by the local people four months before the arrival of the crew. The 2001 Gujarat earthquake devastated this region and displaced many locals. The crew, including the English, contributed to their cause by donating , with further contributions during the year.|$|E
5|$|Civilians in Masan posed an {{unexpectedly}} dangerous {{problem for the}} UN forces. The town had a large community of Communist sympathizers and agents. At {{the peak of the}} North Korean offensive, Han Gum Jo, manager of the Masan branch of the Korean Press Association, confessed that he was chief of the South Korean Labor Party in Masan and that he had been funneling information to the North Koreans through a Pusan headquarters. Additionally, the chief of the Masan prison guards was found to be the head of a Communist cell that included seven of his subordinates. This, and other counterintelligence information, came to light {{at a time when the}} most intense fighting was in progress only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>miles</b> <b>away.</b> Kean considered the situation so dangerous that he ordered Masan evacuated of all people except police, public officials, railroad and utility workers, and necessary laborers and their families. Evacuation was to be completed in five days. On September 10 and 11 alone the 25th Division evacuated more than 12,000 people by Landing Ship Tank (LST) from Masan.|$|E
5|$|On September 27, 1947, the Kings County {{council in}} New York City of the Army and Navy Union {{under the command}} of General Samuel Hoch made {{available}} an escort party for the families who were having their soldier dead brought home from World War II.

He also coordinated the Brooklyn Naval Yard Garrison of the organization later, that participated in the Freedom Train Brooklyn display at the Vanderveer Park freight yards of the Long Island Rail Road.

Akhsi or Archiyan (possibly <b>a</b> town <b>few</b> <b>miles</b> <b>away</b> from Namangan), {{which was}} one of the strongest forts in that country, was {{occupied}} by Shaikh Bayazid, brother of Tambol; he was treating about submission, and for that reason the Khans had tarried near the fort. At this juncture, Muhammad Shaybani Khan came up with 30,000 men. The Khans had hardly enough time to draw up in line, when, after a short conflict, the Khans were put to rout by the overpowering numbers of the enemy. Their horses being rendered useless with fatigue, the two Khans were taken prisoners. As for Babur, he fled to the hills on thesouth of Ferghana.|$|R

60|$|Meantime Heyst and {{the girl}} were <b>a</b> good <b>few</b> <b>miles</b> <b>away,</b> having gone in the night on board one of the Tesman schooners bound to the eastward.

The Tesman schooner had sailed at daylight with the usual land breeze, and was probably still in sight in the offing at the time. However, the two pursuers after their experience with the American mate, made for the shore. On landing, they had another violent row in the German language. But there was no second fight; and finally, with looks of fierce animosity, they got together into a gharry--obviously with the frugal view of sharing expenses--and drove away, leaving an astonished little crowd of Europeans and natives on the quay.|$|R

50|$|Meeting {{with the}} head of the {{education}} board to plead Maruge’s case, Jane is overruled. It is explained to her that if an exception is made to keep Maruge in the school, others will follow, and many schools will eventually become filled with older people sitting aside children. Maruge is forced to attend an adult learning centre, where he soon finds himself surrounded by people with no motivation or ambition to study. Maruge vows to never go back to the adult institution. Jane later decides to offer him a reprieve, to work as her teaching assistant. As Maruge's story gains publicity and attention, the local press descend on the school, causing friction among the parents. The villagers believe Jane and Maruge are seeking fame and fortune at the expense of the children. Following negative feedback and random acts of violence against the school, Jane soon receives a letter that she is to be transferred to another educational institute <b>a</b> <b>few</b> hundred <b>miles</b> <b>away.</b>|$|R

In 1926, Clarke and George Porter opened a Canalaska trading post for owner Captain Christian Theodore Pedersen in Perry River, probably because of Ahiarmiut relocation to that area, the Kent Peninsula caribou becoming scarce. In addition to the trading post, Clarke built a home for Angulalik, ensuring Ahiarmiut loyalty to the Canalaska post, rather than <b>an</b> HBC posta <b>few</b> <b>miles</b> <b>away</b> (run by Angus Gavin between April 1937 and July 1941).|$|R
