30|$|As such {{there is}} little or no room for {{argument}} on the notion that “people” are one of the key assets determining the success or failure of an organization and hence the importance of knowledge, skills, attitudes and behaviors of these people for the betterment of an organization. “People” <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>assets</b> that are capable of bringing growth and development in an organization. Though a company does not have absolute power over this asset, they can make use of certain tools and techniques to exert some vital influence over the way they perform towards achieving the goal of the organization. “The adoption of information and communication technology (ICT) in delivering Human Resource management functions, due to the digital revolution in the world is such a tool that organizations have employed to manipulate the performance and behavior of the people on whom they rely onto achieve business success” (Kovach and Hughes 2002).|$|E

In the absence of appropriate institutional mechanism poverty and natural resource become interlinked in a manner with one exacerbating the other. In this regards, appropriate property right regimes are considered vital both for addressing the problem of resource degradation and alleviation of absolute poverty. Based on this conceptual framework the Leasehold Forestry (LHF) for the poor has been practiced in Nepal for a decade. This study aims to examine through quantitative evidence how far the programme {{has been successful in}} reducing poverty incidence among participating LHF households. The study also aims to analyze the exogenous factors determining forest output using a household production function under imperfect market condition. As LHF programme is a demand based programme that has rapidly expanded to 26 of the 75 districts of Nepal within a short span of time, positive changes in socio-economic indicators among LHF is anticipated. The results of this study will provide policy makers with important insights on management of degraded land for poverty alleviation. If proved successful, this innovative experiment of Nepal can provide valuable lessons to countries facing similar resource degradation and poverty problems...|$|E

40|$|The {{globalisation}} {{of contemporary}} capitalism is bringing about {{at least two}} important implications for the emergence and significance of business services. First, the social division of labour steadily increases (ILLERIS 1996). Within the complex organisation of production and trade new intermediate actors emerge either from the externalisation of existing functions {{in the course of}} corporate restructuring policies or from the fragmentation of the production chain into newly defined functions. Second, competitive advantages of firms increasingly rest on their ability to innovate and learn. As global communication erodes knowledge advantages more quickly, product life cycles shorten and permanent organisational learning results to be crucial for the creation and maintenance of competitiveness. Intra- and interorganisational relations of firms now <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>assets</b> for learning and reflexivity (STORPER 1997). These two aspects of globalisation help understand why management consulting - as only one among other knowledge intensive business services (KIBS) - has been experiencing such a boost throughout the last two decades. Throughout the last ten years, the business has grown annually by 10 % on average in Europe. Management consulting can be seen first, as a new organisational intermediate and second, as an agent of change and reflexivity to business organisations. Although the KIBS industry may not take a great share of the national GDP its impact on national economies should not be underestimated. Estimations show that today up to 80 % of the value added to industrial products stem from business services (ILLERIS 1996). Economic geographers have been paying more attention to KIBS since the late 1970 s and focus on the transformation of the spatial economy through the emerging business services. This market survey is conceived as a first step of a research programme on the internationalisation of management consulting and as a contribution to the lively debate in economic geography. The management consulting industry is unlimited in many ways: There are only scarce institutional boundaries, low barriers to entry, a very heterogeneous supply structure and multiple forms of transaction. Official statistics have not yet provided devices of grasping this market and it may be therefore, that research and literature on this business are rather poor. The following survey is an attempt to selectively compile existing material, empirical studies and statistics in order to draw a sketchy picture of the European market, its institutional constraints, agents and dynamics. German examples will be employed to pursue arguments in more depth...|$|E

40|$|The {{security}} of TLS depends on trust in certificate authorities, and that trust stems from {{their ability to}} protect and control {{the use of a}} private signing <b>key.</b> <b>The</b> signing <b>key</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>asset</b> of a certificate authority (CA), and its value is based on trust in <b>the</b> corresponding public <b>key</b> which is primarily distributed by browser vendors. Compromise of a CA private key represents a single point-of-failure that could have disastrous consequences, so CAs {{go to great lengths to}} attempt to protect and control the use of their private keys. Nevertheless, keys are sometimes compromised and may be misused accidentally or intentionally by insiders. We propose splitting a CA's private key among multiple parties, and producing signatures using a generic secure multi-party computation protocol that never exposes <b>the</b> actual signing <b>key.</b> This could be used by a single CA to reduce the risk that its signing key would be compromised or misused. It could also enable new models for certificate generation, where multiple CAs would need to agree and cooperate before a new certificate can be generated, or even where certificate generation would require cooperation between a CA and the certificate recipient (subject). Although more efficient solutions are possible with custom protocols, we demonstrate the feasibility of implementing a decentralized CA using a generic two-party secure computation protocol with an evaluation of a prototype implementation that uses secure two-party computation to generate certificates signed using ECDSA on curve secp 192 k 1...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} monitor {{organizational}} health and promote well-being, some new measurement scales have been recently devised {{in relation to}} organizational values in the Italian cultural context. They aim to assess intangible organizational dimensions such as work satisfaction, strain, and harassment. Such constructs, within the adopted model of organizational well-being (also including indicators of organizational commitment and citizenship, altruistic behaviors, absenteeism, turnover, and burnout), are, as is well-known, consequent variables, deriving from organizational culture, climate and conflict, as well as collective efficacy, perception of organizational support, and stress sources (De Carlo, 2007). By administering it to a large sample of Italian workers, the scale factor structure was verified and validated through structural equation models. As regards work satisfaction, the five first-order factor theoretical model – satisfaction with content of work, with compensation, with interpersonal relationships, with organizational processes, with professional growth – fits the data well, while the second order factor, work satisfaction, explains well the five first order factors (χ 2 (72) = 539. 6, p<. 01, SRMR=. 05, CFI=. 97, RMSEA=. 05). As for strain, the fit of the three first-order factor model – emotional stability, uncommitment, and leisure – and a higher order factor (strain itself) is very good (χ 2 (32) = 222. 03, p<. 01, SRMR=. 04, CFI=. 97, RMSEA=. 05). Concerning harassment, a final three factor model – attacks on the person, on professional life quality, and economic attacks – fits the data well (χ 2 (37) = 272. 06, p<. 01, SRMR=. 03, CFI=. 96, RMSEA=. 06).

The most effective means of knowledge creation and transfer from experts to novices in both education and industry settings is through stories and dialogue using analog channel such as verbal discourse, ges-tures, annotations, and sketching. Current knowledge capture and reuse solutions do not afford to capture and utilize the relevance embedded in these multimodal streams of communication.

An increasing amount of tools for mining e-mail data into social networks <b>is</b> available, but <b>the</b> question remains to what extent these tools are also capable of conducting knowledge network analysis: the analysis of networks from a knowledge perspective. It is argued that in order to perform knowledge network analysis, a tool is required that is capable of analyzing both the header data and the body data of e-mail messages. In this paper two e-mail mining tools are elaborated. One focuses on the analysis of e-mail header data and the other focuses on the analysis of e-mail body data. Both tools are embedded in their theoretical background and compared to other e-mail mining tools that address e-mail header data or e-mail body data. The aim of this paper <b>is</b> two-fold. <b>The</b> paper primarily aims at providing a detailed discussion of both tools. Continuing, from the in-depth review, the integration of both tools is proposed, concluding towards a single new tool that is capable of analyzing both e-mail header and body data. It is argued how this new tool nurtures the application of knowledge network analysis...|$|R

Based on the FAS methodology (UNWTO) the attractiveness of identified <b>key</b> tourism <b>assets</b> <b>is</b> evaluated. <b>The</b> results of this evaluation indicate there is still more factors than attractors, <b>the</b> least developed <b>are</b> <b>the</b> man-made attractors, while <b>the</b> natural attractors <b>are</b> underdeveloped. Based on identified tourism assets and their attractiveness the differentiation of Danube and its coastal area into three highly valuable zones are proposed. Bearing in mind that potential tourism attractiveness of identified factors and attractors {{has not yet been}} realized, necessary actions for activating and sustainable development of three proposed tourism zones <b>are</b> suggested. Therefore <b>the</b> criteria for nautical infrastructure prioritization, as well as criteria for urban and rural tourism centers differentiation at Danube coastal area <b>are</b> defined. <b>The</b> paper indicates the priority actions for sustainable tourism development, namely the upgrading of tourist presentation and interpretation in order to achieve the potential attractiveness of tourism assets, supported with their better accessibility, as well as development of tourism products, integration and diversification of tourism offer at Danube and along its coastal area.

As {{the product of}} the clinical development process, clinical data are recognized to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>key</b> corporate <b>asset</b> and provide critical evidence of a medicine&rsquo;s efficacy and safety and of its potential economic value to <b>the</b> market. It <b>is</b> also well recognized that using effective technology-enabled methods to manage clinical data can enhance the speed with which <b>the</b> drug <b>is</b> developed and commercialized, hence enhancing the competitive advantage. The effective use of data-capture tools may ensure that high-quality data are available for early review and rapid decision-making. A well-designed, protocol-driven, standardized, site workflow-oriented and documented database, populated via efficient data feed mechanisms, will ensure regulatory and commercial questions receive rapid responses. When information from a sponsor&rsquo;s clinical database or data warehouse develops into corporate knowledge, the value of <b>the</b> medicine can <b>be</b> realized. Moreover, regulators, payer groups, patients, activist groups, patient advocacy groups, and employers are becoming more educated consumers of medicine, requiring monetary value and quality, and seeking out up-todate medical information supplied by biopharmaceutical companies. All these developments in the current biopharmaceutical arena demand that clinical data management (CDM) <b>is</b> at <b>the</b> forefront, leading change, influencing direction, and providing objective evidence. Sustaining an integrated database or data repository for initial product registration and subsequent postmarketing uses is a long-term process to maximize return on investment for organizations. CDM should <b>be</b> <b>the</b> owner of driving clinical data-cleaning process in consultation with other stakeholders, such as clinical operations, safety, quality assurance, and sites, and responsible for building a knowledge base to add potential value in assisting further study designs or clinical programs. CDM needs to draw on a broad range of skills such as technical, scientific, project management, information technology (IT), systems engineering, and interpersonal skills to tackle, drive, and provide valued service in managing data within the anticipated e-clinical age. Commitment to regulatory compliance is required in this regulated industry; however, a can-do attitude with strong willingness to change and to seek ways to improve CDM functions and processes proactively are essential to continued success and to ensure quality data-driven productivity.

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} the research problem of "what <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>key</b> underpinning <b>assets</b> or drivers of technological innovation, {{and how can}} they be harnessed to create competitive advantage?" Technological change is an evolutionary process. Research and technological innovation creates knowledge and technology that <b>is</b> irreversible in <b>the</b> sense that inventions can be superseded but not "uninvented". Technological innovation creates knowledge and technology that is cumulative because it lays a platform for further knowledge creation, or sets in place another rung in an ascending ladder of new performance characteristics or properties which are demonstrably superior to their antecedents. In turn, the asset specificity and irreversibility of technology and its cumulativeness create barriers to competitive entry. This allows a firm to earn the premiums that create market power and allow further innovation to <b>be</b> financed. <b>The</b> model of technological innovation advanced in this thesis has at its core the strategic governance framework of a firm, within which the dynamics of significant new technology, human capital and social processes are catalysed and made productive by differentiated technological learning processes. No one type of technological learning applies universally, but rather learning is differentiated by variables such as firm size and structure, the past experience and core competencies of the firm, its human capital stocks, social processes, interactions with the external environment, and a host of market, institutional and technological factors. It <b>is</b> argued that <b>the</b> dynamics of significant new technology, human capital and social processes are fundamental and necessary conditions of technological innovation. Technological learning processes underly and provide a connecting thread that integrates these necessary conditions into a model of technological innovation that can be applied by managers to create and sustain competitive advantage. Technological learning both shapes and <b>is</b> shaped by <b>the</b> human capital stocks and social processes of a firm. Learning processes give rise to significant new technology, and the dynamics of that technology in turn helps catalyse and gives rise to further learning. The rate and direction of learning and of technological innovation is also driven by the firm's interaction with external sources of ideas and technology. To create competitive advantage through technological innovation business managers must address a firm's strategy, human capital-related assets, social processes and technological learning abilities. Policy managers must ensure that <b>the</b> public technostructure <b>is</b> in place to foster human capital creation within an economy and to facilitate access to new ideas and sources of stimulus...|$|R
40|$|Thesis {{submitted}} in fulfilment of {{the requirements}} for the degree of Master of Technology: Business Information System In the Faculty of Business At the Cape Peninsula University of Technology, 2013 The South African manufacturing industry landscape has changed due to the pressures of globalisation and liberalisation of trade policy regimes. The structural shift of this industry {{has led to a}} global market in which many small businesses in the manufacturing sector find it difficult to compete with competitors for example, in Asian countries. Companies are required to improve their competitiveness by using various strategies such as e-commerce. However, these strategies are changing economics, markets, industry structure, products and services, the flow of products and services, consumer segmentation, consumer values, consumer behaviour and labour markets. An e-commerce strategy could assist small businesses in emerging markets to streamline their business processes in their respective sectors and industries, thus enabling them to enhance their business activities. Yet, literature reveals that most SMMEs do not take full advantage of e-commerce applications in their business activities. A qualitative approach using a case study methodology is used for this research. The researcher adopted models such as the Technology-Organisational-Environmental model, a value proposition model and a <b>key</b> <b>assets</b> model to collect and analyse evidence to propose guidelines for e-commerce initiatives in the selected environment. The findings indicate that SMMEs could improve their performance by establishing formal strategies and structures to increase their worth. This is done by creating e-commerce strategies to fit their organisational goals and objectives. Furthermore, manufacturing SMMEs need appropriate online platforms to transact and build strong relationships with suppliers, customers and partners. In addition, it is essential for SMMEs to establish and monitor quality standards in their e-commerce activities. It <b>was</b> found that <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>assets</b> needed by SMMEs in the manufacturing sector could impact their ability to sustain their business activities. Finally, manufacturing SMMEs need to deliver targeted and contextual marketing messages to help influence potential decision makers. This research contributes to the field of e-commerce by providing guidelines which manufacturing SMMEs could use as a starting point, to understand and improve their current e-commerce strategies and sustain their business growth...|$|R
40|$|In this dissertation, I {{study the}} {{performance}} impact {{of information technology}} (IT) investments in the public sector. IT has <b>been</b> one of <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>assets</b> in public administration since the early MIS era. Even though the information systems (IS) discipline has witnessed {{a considerable amount of}} research efforts on the subject of IT business value {{for the last couple of}} decades, the study on IT value in governments has not been as extensive as in the for-profit domain. A broad range of literature search in the areas of IS, public administration, public economics, and political sciences shows that there have been a limited number of quantitative empirical studies on the performance impact of IT in public organizations. To fill this gap in the literature, the dissertation presents three studies with distinctive theoretical examining the IT value in the public sector. In the first study, drawing upon the public value management perspective from public administration and the literature on IT resources in the IS discipline, I lay a theoretical foundation for the mechanism in which IT resources contribute to the generation of public value. Specifically, I argue that IT resources create public value by facilitating <b>the</b> four <b>key</b> organizational capabilities in governments - operational capability, communication capability, partnering capability, and innovative capability. In the second study, I empirically measure the cost efficiency effect of IT investments in the context of U. S. state governments. Estimation with a stochastic frontier estimation approach with the cost function framework shows that there is a significant efficiency improvement effect of IT in state governments. In the third study, the performance effect of IT <b>is</b> analyzed from <b>the</b> government growth perspective. Theories on government growth in political sciences and public economics provide theoretical predictions on the influence of IT on government expenditures as well as a basis for empirical estimation. I find that IT investments are associated with smaller expenditure size in U. S. state governments. Overall, this dissertation contributes to the literature by offering a theoretical framework, empirical methodologies, and conclusive evidence showing the value creation effect of IT in the public sector...|$|R
