60|$|The thought will perhaps {{occur to}} the reader that Fox was not less lax than Sheridan, and yet for Fox Burke long had the sincerest friendship. He was dissolute, indolent, irregular, and the most insensate gambler that ever squandered fortune after fortune over the faro-table. It was his vices {{as much as his}} {{politics}} that made George III. hate Fox as an English Catiline. How came Burke to accept a man of this character, first for his disciple, then for his friend, and next for his leader? The answer is a simple one. In spite of the disorders of his life, Fox, from the time when his acquaintance with Burke began, down to the time when it came to such disastrous end, and for long years afterwards, was to the bottom of his heart as passionate for freedom, justice, and beneficence as Burke ever was. These great ends were as real, as constant, as overmastering in Fox as they were in Burke. No man was ever more deeply imbued with the generous impulses of great statesmanship, with chivalrous courage, with the magnificent spirit of devotion to high imposing causes. These qualities we may be sure, and not his power as a debater and as a declaimer, won for him in Burke's heart the admiration which found such splendid expression in a passage that will remain as <b>a</b> <b>stock</b> <b>piece</b> of declamation for long generations after it was first poured out as a sincere tribute of reverence and affection. Precisians, like Lafayette, might choose to see their patriotic hopes ruined rather than have them saved by Mirabeau, because Mirabeau was a debauchee. Burke's public morality was of stouter stuff, and he loved Fox because he knew that under the stains and blemishes that had been left by a deplorable education, was that sterling, inexhaustible ore in which noble sympathies are subtly compounded with resplendent powers.|$|E

40|$|The cutting stock problem it is {{of great}} {{interest}} in relation with several real world problems.

The classical solution methods of this problem generally need a great amount of calculation. In order to reduce the computational load they use heuristics. A newer solution method is presented in this paper, which is based on a genetic technique. This method uses a tree representation of the cutting pattern, and combines different patterns in order to achive patterns with higher performance. The combination of the cutting patterns is realized by a combined crossover - mutation operator. An application of the proposed method is presented briefly in the end of the paper. 1.

50|$|In {{addition}} {{to the type of}} wood, how it is treated can {{have a significant impact on}} its properties. Wood for gunstocks should be slowly dried, to prevent grain collapse and splitting, and also to preserve the natural color of the wood; custom stockmakers will buy blanks that have been dried two to three years and then dry it for several additional years before working it into <b>a</b> <b>stock.</b> Careful selection can yield distinctive and attractive features, such as crotch figure, feathering, fiddleback, and burl, which can significantly add to the desirability of <b>a</b> <b>stock.</b> While <b>a</b> basic, straight grained blank suitable for <b>a</b> utilitarian <b>stock</b> might sell for US$20, an exhibition grade blank with superb figure could price in the range of US$2000. Blanks for one <b>piece</b> <b>stocks</b> are more expensive than blanks for two <b>piece</b> <b>stocks,</b> due to the greater difficulty in finding the longer blanks with desirable figure. Two <b>piece</b> <b>stocks</b> are ideally made from a single blank, so that the wood in both parts shows similar color and figure.|$|R

LP-based lower bounds on the minimum cost are computed and, by rounding the LP solution, a feasible solution and associated upper bound is obtained.
