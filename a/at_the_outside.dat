5|$|A {{long line}} of subwoofers placed {{horizontally}} along {{the front edge of}} the stage can be delayed such that the center subs fire several milliseconds prior to the ones flanking them, which fire several milliseconds prior to their neighbors, continuing in this fashion until the last subwoofers are reached <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> ends of the subwoofer row (beamforming). This method helps to counteract the extreme narrowing of horizontal dispersion pattern seen with a horizontal subwoofer array. Such delay shading can be used to virtually reshape a loudspeaker array.|$|E
5|$|I never {{warmed up}} ten, fifteen minutes {{before a game}} like most {{pitchers}} do. I'd loosen up, three, four minutes. Five <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside.</b> And I never went to the bullpen. Oh, I'd relieve all right, plenty of times, but I went right from the bench to the box, and I'd take a few warm-up pitches and be ready. Then I had good control. I aimed to make the batter hit the ball, and I threw as few pitches as possible. That's why I was able to work every other day.|$|E
5|$|Allen {{played as}} an inside linebacker {{throughout}} the preseason in 1993, {{but he was}} again cut to the practice squad {{before the start of}} the regular season. He was quickly brought back to the active roster and recorded five tackles in the Lions' season-opening win against the Toronto Argonauts. Allen saw regular playing time for the first time in his career, playing in fifteen regular season games for the Lions. He played mostly as a middle linebacker, but he briefly replaced Tyrone Jones twice <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> linebacker position while he was recovering illness and injury. Allen finished the regular season with 67 tackles, two interceptions, and a fumble recovery. He also recovered a fumble in the Western Semi-Final, but the Lions went on to lose 9–17 to the Stampeders.|$|E

5|$|These {{non-human}} antibodies {{are recognized}} as foreign by the human immune system and may be rapidly cleared from the body, provoke an allergic reaction, or both. To avoid this, parts of the antibody can be replaced with human amino acid sequences, or pure human antibodies can be engineered. If the constant region is replaced with the human form, the antibody is termed chimeric and the substem used was -xi-. Part of the variable regions may also be substituted, in which case it is called humanized and -zu- was used; typically, everything is replaced except the complementarity determining regions (CDRs), the three loops of amino acid sequences <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> of each variable region that bind to the target structure, although some other residues may have to remain non-human {{in order to achieve}} good binding. Partly chimeric and partly humanized antibodies used -xizu-. These three substems did not indicate the foreign species used for production. Thus, the human/mouse chimeric antibody basiliximab ends in -ximab just as does the human/macaque antibody gomiliximab. Purely human antibodies used -u-.|$|E

25|$|Bra-wearers {{who have}} {{difficulty}} calculating a correct cup size {{may be able}} to find a correct fit using a method adopted by plastic surgeons. Using a flexible tape measure, position the tape <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> of the chest, under the arm, where the breast tissue begins. Measure across the fullest part of the breast, usually across the nipple, to where the breast tissue stops at the breast bone. This measuring approach assumes that the breasts are not so large or pendulous that they sag significantly, making measuring across the fullness of the breast impractical. Only women whose breasts are firm and spherical can measure without a bra.|$|E

25|$|An {{adjustable}} wood bit, {{also known}} as an expansive wood bit, has a small center pilot bit with an adjustable, sliding cutting edge mounted above it, usually containing a single sharp point <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside,</b> with a set screw to lock the cutter in position. When the cutting edge is centered on the bit, the hole drilled will be small, and when the cutting edge is slid outwards, a larger hole is drilled. This allows a single drill bit to drill {{a wide variety of}} holes, and can take the place of a large, heavy set of different size bits, as well as providing uncommon bit sizes. A ruler or vernier scale is usually provided to allow precise adjustment of the bit size.|$|E
25|$|Ichthyosaurs {{became even}} more popular in 1854 by the {{rebuilding}} at Sydenham Hill of the Crystal Palace, originally erected at the world exhibition of 1851. In the surrounding park, life-sized, painted, concrete statues of extinct animals were placed, which were designed by Benjamin Waterhouse Hawkins {{under the direction of}} Richard Owen. Among them were three models of an ichthyosaur. Although it was known that ichthyosaurs had been animals of the open seas, they were shown basking on the shore, a convention followed by many nineteenth century illustrations with the aim, as Conybeare once explained, of better exposing their build. This led to the misunderstanding that they really had an amphibious lifestyle. The pools in the park were at the time subjected to tidal changes, so that fluctuations in the water level at intervals submerged the ichthyosaur statues, adding a certain realism. Remarkably, internal skeletal structures, such as the scleral rings and the many phalanges of the flippers, were shown <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside.</b>|$|E

25|$|The Thornycroft boiler is {{a variant}} that splits the usual central furnace into two. There are four drums: two main drums {{vertically}} in the centre – a steam and a water drum – also two wing drums <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> {{edges of the}} furnace. The design was notable for its early use of the water-wall furnace. The outer bank of tubes was shallow, consisting of only two rows of tubes. These rows were spaced closely, so that the tubes formed a solid wall, without gasflow between them. The inner bank of tubes was similar: the two rows of tubes closest to the furnace formed a similar water wall. These tubes were splayed apart at their base, so as to provide space for gasflow between them. Within the tube bank, gas flow is mostly parallel to the tubes, similar to some early designs, but contrary to the crossflow design of later three-drum boilers. The exhaust gas emerged into the heart-shaped space below the upper central drum, exiting to the funnel through the rear wall.|$|E
25|$|A star or planet {{often is}} modeled {{as a black}} body, and {{electromagnetic}} radiation emitted from these bodies as black-body radiation. The figure shows a highly schematic cross-section to illustrate the idea. The photosphere of the star, where the emitted light is generated, is idealized as a layer within which the photons of light interact with the material in the photosphere and achieve a common temperature T that is maintained {{over a long period}} of time. Some photons escape and are emitted into space, but the energy they carry away is replaced by energy from within the star, so that the temperature of the photosphere is nearly steady. Changes in the core lead to changes in the supply of energy to the photosphere, but such changes are slow on the time scale of interest here. Assuming these circumstances can be realized, the outer layer of the star is somewhat analogous to the example of an enclosure with a small hole in it, with the hole replaced by the limited transmission into space <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> of the photosphere. With all these assumptions in place, the star emits black-body radiation at the temperature of the photosphere.|$|E
25|$|Vettel got {{ahead of}} Kvyat at the Senna chicane for fifth on lap 37. Ricciardo's front-left {{suspension}} {{began to move}} unsteadily on the main straight on lap 39, and entering the Senna chicane, his car veered right. Ricciardo limped back to the pit lane to retire, ending his fifteen-race finishing streak, extending back following the Malaysian Grand Prix. Hülkenberg attacked Bottas entering the Senna chicane and passed Bottas for eighth after forcing him onto the turn's run-off area on lap 42. Räikkönen immediately took advantage and attacked Bottas who defended <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> of the Descida do Lago corner before the Ferrari got ahead of Bottas who went wide leaving the turn. Bottas made a pit stop on lap 44 which proved problematic: one of his mechanics struggled to make a front wing adjustment and Bottas emerged in 16th place. Magnussen was suffering worse tyre degradation than teammate Button and came under attack from Alonso on lap 45, {{who moved to the}} outside lane heading towards the Senna chicane but was unable to pass. The battle continued through the following corners and Magnussen went defensive driving into the Descida do Lago turn which compromised his exit and Alonso overtook him around the inside of turn five.|$|E
