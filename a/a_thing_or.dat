25|$|In {{the final}} entry of the franchise, {{made up of}} four {{segments}} from a presumably failed television series, Belle teaches the Beast <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>or</b> two about life itself, consideration and manners. He appears only {{in the first and}} fourth segments, and in a cameo in the third. In the first part, The Perfect Word, Beast and Belle have a bitter falling out at dinner when the Beast demands that Cogsworth open the windows to cool him down, {{despite the fact that he}} is the only one hot and there is a cold wind, and angrily strikes his servant, Webster, a long-tongued dictionary. Despite Lumiere and Cogsworth's pleas, Beast refuses to apologise for his behaviour, until Webster, Crane and LePlume forge a letter of apology from the Beast to Belle. All is settled, until the Beast realises that it was a forgery. He furiously banishes Webster, Crane and LePlume from the castle, but Belle brings them back from the woods, and the Beast soon learns to forgive them, as their intentions were good.|$|E
25|$|By {{the time}} of the rediscovery of the Roman law in Europe in the 12th and 13th centuries, the common law had already {{developed}} far enough to prevent a Roman law reception as it occurred on the continent. However, the first common law scholars, most notably Glanvill and Bracton, as well as the early royal common law judges, had been well accustomed with Roman law. Often, they were clerics trained in the Roman canon law. One of the first and throughout its history {{one of the most significant}} treatises of the common law, Bracton's De Legibus et Consuetudinibus Angliae (On the Laws and Customs of England), was heavily influenced by the division of the law in Justinian's Institutes. The impact of Roman law had decreased sharply after the age of Bracton, but the Roman divisions of actions into in rem (typically, actions against <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>or</b> property for the purpose of gaining title to that property; must be filed in a court where the property is located) and in personam (typically, actions directed against a person; these can affect a person's rights and, since a person often owns things, his property too) used by Bracton had a lasting effect and laid the groundwork for a return of Roman law structural concepts in the 18th and 19th centuries. Signs of this can be found in Blackstone's Commentaries on the Laws of England, and Roman law ideas regained importance with the revival of academic law schools in the 19th century. As a result, today, the main systematic divisions of the law into property, contract, and tort (and to some extent unjust enrichment) can be found in the civil law as well as in the common law.|$|E

500|$|In October 2008, Schwimmer {{made his}} Off-Broadway directorial debut in Fault Lines at the Cherry Lane Theatre in New York. The {{production}} won a mixed review from the Los Angeles Times, which wrote: [...] "Based on Fault Lines... we can't really tell whether Schwimmer has much talent as a director. We're surprised he didn't try something more challenging for his debut. If not much else, Schwimmer has encouraged his actors to intense their energy levels and comic timing at all costs". The New York Post, however, noted that Schwimmer [...] "knows <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>or</b> two about freewheeling banter... {{and for a}} good while the play crackles with terrific dialogue, expertly delivered". In February 2009, he returned to theater in a Chicago production of Thornton Wilder's three-act play Our Town as George Gibbs at the Lookingglass Theatre. [...] "Schwimmer... turns in a poignant, richly textured and demonstrably heartfelt performance as George Gibbs. I've seen a fair bit of Schwimmer's post-Friends stage work in London and New York, and I've never seen him better", commented the Chicago Tribune.|$|E

Harrison (who was then only 17) called Hamburg [...] "the naughtiest city in the world". McCartney said: [...] "By the time you got to Hamburg, a girlfriend there was likely to be a stripper, so to be suddenly involved with a hard-core striptease artist, who obviously knew <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>or</b> two about sex... it was quite an eye-opener." [...] Gerry Marsden—frontman for Gerry & the Pacemakers—remembered visiting a Hamburg brothel in Herbertstrasse with Lennon: [...] "We paid our money, went in and sat down.

500|$|To put {{it another}} way, <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>or</b> person is often seen as having a [...] "defining essence" [...] or a [...] "core identity" [...] that is unchanging, and {{describes}} what the thing or person really is. In this way of thinking, things and people are seen as fundamentally the same through time, with any changes being qualitative and secondary to their core identity (e.g. [...] "Mark's hair has turned gray as he has gotten older, {{but he is still}} the same person"). But in Whitehead's cosmology, the only fundamentally existent things are discrete [...] "occasions of experience" [...] that overlap one another in time and space, and jointly make up the enduring person or thing. On the other hand, what ordinary thinking often regards as [...] "the essence of a thing" [...] or [...] "the identity/core of a person" [...] is an abstract generalization of what is regarded as that person or thing's most important or salient features across time. [...] Identities do not define people, people define identities. [...] Everything changes from moment to moment, and to think of anything as having an [...] "enduring essence" [...] misses the fact that [...] "all things flow", though it is often a useful way of speaking.|$|E
500|$|The {{formulation}} of Russell as an Asian American character, {{along with the}} casting of an Asian American in the role was met positively as well. Both Nagai and the film were awarded by the East West Players for the depiction of Russell. EWP lauded Pixar {{for the creation of}} the character, stating, [...] "We are proud to honor a very progressive film company like Pixar who cast an Asian American character alongside an elderly one to play the leads in a feature film." [...] The character is noted as Pixar's first lead Asian character, and was further positively received within the added context of historical non-Asian castings for Asian roles in entertainment. Asian American organizations and entertainment websites, such as media watchdog Media Action Network for Asian Americans (MANAA), Racebending.com, and Angry Asian Man praised the character and Pixar for its diverse character depictions, noting the general lack of Asian American lead characters and Asian actors cast in entertainment. In an interview with NPR in 2013, Angry Asian Mans Phil Yu reflected on the character's lack of typical Asian stereotyping, stating, [...] "You know, he just happens to be Asian and he's, you know, really adorable character. But that kid could've been of any ethnicity but they made the effort to make him Asian - just a little color, you know, and it's really wonderful when that kind of thing happens where they don't have to play that up and make it like <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>or</b> a joke, which happens a lot." ...|$|E

Helen Pidd from The Guardian favoured the blend of 1980s musical styles on the album, but felt that it lacked danceable songs, saying [...] "Problem is, as {{with the majority of}} other tracks – including, most disappointingly, the Dennis-penned [...] "After Dark" [...] – you would be hard pushed to dance to it, which could well be Body Languages downfall". John Robinson from NME gave Body Language an overall positive review and called it [...] "an extremely tastefully done, soulful modern r'n'b record", but felt that it [...] "fails {{to live up to its}} predecessor [...] ". Likewise, Adrien Begnard from PopMatters felt that Body Language lacked the [...] "undeniably catchy" [...] material which was present in Fever, but praised the overall production and the first half of the album; he concluded that [...] "Even though Body Language is a bit of a misstep for Minogue, there's a sense of class to it" [...] and that [...] "Britney [...] could learn <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>or</b> two". The Spin review of the album commented that Minogue [...] "wears the '80s well" [...] and praised the dance-oriented songs on the track list, although they criticised the ballads and pointed out that [...] " [...] Minogue's vocals are so over-processed that they barely seem to exist at all". On the other hand, Andy Battaglia from The A.V.

500|$|Loss {{of control}} {{is defined in}} {{sections}} 54 and 55 of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009. Section 56 abolishes the common law defence of provocation, which also dealt only with murder. There is no mandatory life sentence for voluntary manslaughter. The defence operates whether the defendant is a principal or an accomplice. Broadly speaking, the defendant must have actually lost self-control; the trigger for {{this must be a}} qualifying trigger; and it must be that a [...] "normal" [...] person might also have lost control in the circumstances. The loss of control need not be sudden, but cannot be in a [...] "considered desired for revenge". The loss of control is a subjective test which asks whether this defendant actually lost control, and if so, whether that loss of control led to their killing. The qualifying trigger may take one of two forms, or be a combination of both: that the killing was attributable to the defendant's fear of serious violence from the victim against the defendant or another identified person; or where the defendant's loss of self-control was attributable to <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>or</b> things done or said (or both) which constituted circumstances of an extremely grave character, and caused the defendant to have a justifiable sense of being seriously wronged. The meaning of the terms [...] "extremely grave character" [...] and [...] "justifiable sense of being seriously wronged" [...] used in the second form is currently unclear. Section 51(1)(c) requires that [...] "a person of 's sex and age, with a normal degree of tolerance and self-restraint and in the circumstances of , might have reacted in the same or in a similar way to [...]" [...] These issues are complicated and directing a jury on issues of loss of control is likely to be difficult.|$|E
