Feral dogs are known to kill younger birds, and the southern caracara (Caracara plancus) is suspected to prey on hatchlings. Armadillos sometimes feed on greater rhea eggs; nests have been found which had been undermined by a six-banded armadillo (Euphractus sexcinctus) or a big hairy armadillo (Chaetophractus villosus) and the rhea eggs were broken apart. Predation on young rheas has also been reportedly committed by greater grisons (Galictis vittata).|$|E

All in all, it's a worthwhile collection of memorable videos from one of pop's trendsetters." [...] Bryan Chin from University Wire commented [...] "Some people really dislike the Madonna of the '90s. 'Oh, she got so slutty!, they quibble. 'She doesn't have the same kind of cultural impact that she had in the '80s,' they whine. Obviously, these people haven't been paying much attention.

500|$|Allgame felt Nuclear Strike [...] "is {{really nothing}} more than a repackaged version of the earlier game". The {{reviewer}} felt there to be limited motivation for owners of Soviet Strike to buy the new sequel other than the FMV. GameFan called Nuclear Strike [...] "a tangible improvement over its predecessor" [...] and [...] "a more satisfying experience all round." [...] The writer felt the increased number of vehicles set the game apart from Soviet Strike, saying they [...] "make for a far richer, more active playing experience." [...] He recommended it to Soviet Strike devotees, while Power Play recommended it for fans of action games. IGN wrote the game was a [...] "fine example" [...] of the series, also citing a broader range of vehicles over Soviet Strike. Nonetheless it gave Nuclear Strike a lower score than the game's predecessor, saying [...] "at its heart Nuclear Strike is the same game as Soviet Strike [...] It's not a bad game, it's just more of the same." [...] GameFan's reviewers called Nuclear Strike [...] "the definitive strike game" [...] and said it [...] "trounces all other Strikes that have come before." [...] Previewing the PlayStation version, Super GamePower predicted the improved explosion effects, missions and wider range of vehicles would make it the best in the series. In its review, the magazine said the game contained nothing new for fans of the previous games, but felt the control system, explosions, helicopter sound effects to be excellent. Next Generation said: [...] "Those who enjoyed Soviet Strike <b>are</b> <b>certain</b> <b>to</b> like Nuclear Strike even more", but said the games are almost indistinguishable. Game Revolution acknowledged the game is [...] "basically the same rehash of its predecessors, but it stands as a great game on its own. Nuclear Strike is a definite buy for fans who haven't tired of the series, and at least a 'rent me' for those who have been locked in the closet and haven't played any 'Strike' games." [...] Edge said: [...] "Fans of the series lusting after more above-viewed shooting action will naturally welcome this latest regurgitation. The seasoned gamer, however, will no doubt walk away with a feeling of d√©ja vu." ...|$|E

2500|$|It {{can be more}} {{intuitive}} {{to present}} this argument using Bayes' rule rather than Bayes' theorem. Having seen a black face we can rule out the white card. We {{are interested in the}} probability that the card is black given a black face is showing. Initially it is equally likely that the card is black and that it is mixed: the prior odds are 1:1. Given that it is black we <b>are</b> <b>certain</b> <b>to</b> see a black face, but given that it is mixed we are only 50% certain to see a black face. The ratio of these probabilities, called the likelihood ratio or Bayes factor, is 2:1. Bayes' rule says [...] "posterior odds equals prior odds times likelihood ratio". Since the prior odds are 1:1 the posterior odds equals the likelihood ratio, 2:1. It is now twice as likely that the card is black than that it is mixed.|$|E
2500|$|In {{recent years}} other authors have offered more detail on the losses of each side. John Manrho and Ronald P√ºtz, {{published}} their findings in Bodenplatte: The Luftwaffe's Last Hope. According to their figures, taken from German and Allied sources, {{which include the}} remains of German airmen found up until 2003, German casualties were 271 fighters destroyed, 65 single-engine fighters damaged and 9 twin-engine aircraft destroyed, and four damaged. Some 143 pilots were killed in action, 70 became prisoners of war and 21 were wounded in action. The Allies lost 305 aircraft destroyed and 190 aircraft damaged. A further 15 Allied aircraft were shot down and ten damaged. A further six were downed by other causes. Manrho and P√ºtz have also deduced that only 17 German aircraft <b>are</b> <b>certain</b> <b>to</b> have been shot down by German Flak. Even if aircraft with unknown fates are added, it still gives a figure of only 30‚Äî35.

2500|$|SWANCCs {{implications}} for {{the scope of the}} federal wetlands permitting program <b>are</b> <b>certain</b> <b>to</b> be significant, but it will take years of litigation before they are fully clear. A key source of confusion is the aforementioned disconnect between the decision's narrow holding and broad rationale. The latter appears to preclude any effort by the Corps to assert jurisdiction over isolated waters, including isolated wetlands, on the basis of linkages with interstate commerce other than the interstate flight of migratory birds. (The Corps asserted such non-migratory-bird linkages after the litigation commenced, noting that SWANCCs municipal landfill is clearly of a commercial nature and, when aggregated with similar activity elsewhere, would substantially affect interstate commerce. The Supreme Court declined to consider this argument, pointing out that landfill activity is a [...] "far cry" [...] from the [...] "waters of the United States" [...] to which the CWA extends.) Plainly, the degree of section 404 program contraction occasioned by SWANCC will depend on which aspects of the decision shape the government's response.|$|E
