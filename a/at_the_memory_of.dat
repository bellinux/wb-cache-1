500|$|However, {{the exact}} phrase on the {{monument}} is yaktaaj ajawlel, {{which is the}} same wording that was used when the [...] "burden" [...] of leadership passed from K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat, the k'ul ahaw of Quirigu√°, to his successor Sky Xul during his burial ten days after his demise in 785 AD. As such, this may suggest that, rather than abdicating, Ha' K'in Xook died in 780 AD, and his successor, K'inich Yat Ahk II, took up rule later. The deciphered glyphs on Throne 1 note that K'inich Yat Ahk II later [...] "remembered" [...] Ha' K'in Xook at the Paw Stone Place in some way, and that the new king may have possibly wept <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>memory</b> <b>of</b> Ha' K'in Xook, according to anthropologist Oswaldo Chinchilla Mazariegos.|$|E

60|$|Going to {{the spring}} near which we were outspanned, I took off my shirt {{to have a good}} wash, still chuckling <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>memory</b> <b>of</b> all the hocus-pocus of my old friend, the Opener-of-Roads.|$|E
6000|$|... "You spoke----" [...] the Duke {{hesitated a}} moment, writhing {{inwardly}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>memory</b> <b>of</b> the exact words {{in which the}} fool had spoken. [...] "You spoke this morning of one whom the Lady Valentina had met." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>At</b> once <b>the</b> <b>memory</b> <b>of</b> Rodenard and my {{followers}} {{occurred to}} me, and I thanked Heaven that I was abed {{where he might}} not see me, and that thus he would probably be sent forth empty-handed {{with the news that}} his master was neither arrived nor expected.|$|R

60|$|There was a silence. Mr. Barbecue-Smith {{stood with}} his back to the hearth, warming himself <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>memory</b> <b>of</b> last winter's fires. He could not control his {{interior}} satisfaction, but still went on smiling to himself. At last he turned to Denis.|$|E

5000|$|The Tunnel is a {{novel about}} a man named William Frederick Kohler and his attempt to write an {{introduction}} to his historical magnum opus, [...] "Guilt and Innocence in Hitler's Germany." [...] But when Kohler tries to flesh out this minor introduction, mostly {{for the purposes of}} gloating over his colleagues, he instead finds himself writing a deeply personal book about the history of his own life. As the novel progresses we see the lies, half-truths, violent emotions, and relative chaos of Kohler's life laid bare, and while he continues to dig away <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>memories</b> <b>of</b> his past he also begins digging a tunnel out from the basement where he works, a reflection of his tunneling through himself.

The shame of the former one I have wiped out--although, perchance, you think it not. I am wiping out the shame of the latter one. It was unworthy in me, mademoiselle, but I loved you so dearly {{that it seemed to}} me that no matter how I came by you, I should rest content if I but won you. I have since seen the error if it, the {{injustice}} of it. I will not take what is not freely given. And so, farewell." ...|$|E
6000|$|She did not understand. [...] "Your resolve {{delivered}} me from {{a horrible}} danger," [...] she admitted. And she shivered <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>memory</b> <b>of</b> it.
