40|$|In {{developing}} countries, long-term current <b>account</b> <b>deficits</b> {{may cause}} serious {{problems in the}} economy. Turkey's current <b>account</b> <b>deficit</b> and the financing of this deficit {{is one of the}} most widely debated issues in recent years. There are two different views about the emergence of the current <b>account</b> <b>deficit.</b> According to the first view, the current <b>account</b> <b>deficit</b> is due to the increase in demand created by economic growth after the 2001 crisis. According to the other opinion, this deficit is a result of an overvalued domestic currency, which is created by high interest rates accelerating the flow of short-term speculative capital. Since the current <b>account</b> <b>deficit</b> is financed with debt, the increasing external debt of the country is threatening the future of the economy. In this study, firstly the current <b>account</b> <b>deficit</b> problem in Turkey and the factors affecting the current operations which play an important role in financing the short-term capital movements are explained. Secondly, the policies to ensure the current account balance are defined. Finally the effects of the current <b>account</b> <b>deficit</b> problem on the European Union accession is discussed...|$|R

40|$|In {{the year}} ended December 1997, New Zealand’s current <b>account</b> <b>deficit</b> reached 7. 7 percent of GDP, high among {{industrial}} countries (table 1). Conventional wisdom has it that current <b>account</b> <b>deficits</b> in excess of 5 percent of GDP provide a warning signal to policy-makers and financial markets. However, {{there are reasons to}} think that this simple rule of thumb is not too informative. For example, many countries have had current <b>account</b> <b>deficits</b> in excess of 5 percent of GDP for prolonged periods, and have suffered no external crises, and some countries with current <b>account</b> <b>deficits</b> of less than 5 percent of GDP (Indonesia, for instance) have experienced serious problems. To understand the implications of New Zealand’s current <b>account</b> <b>deficit,</b> we must therefore look beyond simple rules of thumb. This article takes a detailed look at the factors influencing New Zealand’s current <b>account</b> <b>deficit,</b> and its potential economic ramifications. We conclude that although New Zealand’s current <b>account</b> <b>deficit</b> is sizeable and cannot be expected to remain at current levels indefinitely, adjustment when it occurs – and recent depreciation of the exchange rate suggests that that adjustment has already begun – is unlikely to be disruptive to the economy. ...|$|R
40|$|This study {{analyzed}} {{capital flows}} and current account dynamics in Zimbabwe from 1990 to 2013. The primary {{objective of the}} study was to determine whether Zimbabweâ€™s current <b>account</b> <b>deficit</b> is sustainable or not. The study involved investigating whether the current <b>account</b> <b>deficits</b> violates the intertemporal budget constraints (IBC) or not, investigating the causal relationship between capital flows and current <b>account</b> <b>deficits,</b> and whether there is evidence of speculative capital inflows into the economy which are subject to sudden stops and reversal. When a country runs persistent current <b>account</b> <b>deficits,</b> questions are raised on the ability of a country to generate future current account surpluses to meet its external debt obligations created by past current <b>account</b> <b>deficits.</b> The study applied the intertemporal balance model developed by Liu and Tanner, (1996) to assess sustainability of the current <b>account</b> <b>deficit.</b> The analysis involved testing the stationarity of current account to GDP ratio. Unit root tests were initially conducted by applying the ADF test. However, given its inability to discriminate clearly between non-stationary and stationary series with a higher degree of autocorrelation and sensitivity to breaks, the study also used second generation stationarity tests, notably the Dickey-Fuller Generalized Least Square (DF GLS), the semi-parametric Phillips-Perron test and Kwiatkowski-Phillips-Schmidt-Shin (KPSS) test. In addition, cointegration a test was conducted which also give way to the Error Correction Model (ECM). The study concluded the analysis with Granger Causality Tests on the current and current and capital account balance and the respective sub-components. The results of the unit root tests amply demonstrated that the current <b>account</b> <b>deficits</b> violated the IBC implying that Zimbabweâ€™s current <b>account</b> <b>deficit</b> were unsustainable. The exports and imports of goods and services were co integrated but the Wald Coefficient Restriction tests results indicated that the current <b>account</b> <b>deficits</b> followed an explosive path. The study also took into account the errors and omissions in the analysis. The results confirmed that the current <b>account</b> <b>deficit</b> is unsustainable even when the errors and omission are subtracted from the current <b>account</b> <b>deficit...</b>|$|R
