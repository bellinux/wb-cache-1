Finally, despite their redox asymmetry, even in the heterobimetallic iron-rhodium as-indacenediide complexes, strong metal-metal coupling is present. In fact, oxidation of the iron centre is accompanied by electron transfer from rhodium to iron and formation of a reactive 17 -electron rhodium site. syn and anti Fe-Rh as-indacenediide complexes are rare examples of heterobimetallic systems which can be classified as borderline Class II/Class III species...|$|E

Three new methods of synthesis of (DD) BF 2 + cations are reported, and compared with the previous method of reacting a chelating donor with Et 20. BF 3. The methods most effective for aromatic donors such as 1, 1 O-phenanthroline are ineffective for saturated polydentate tertiary-amines like N,N,N',Nil,Nil-pentamethyldiethylenetriamine. Polydentate tertiary-amine donors that form 5 -membered rings upon bidentate chelation were found to chelate effectively when the BF 2 source contained two leaving groups (a heavy halide and a Lewis base such as pyridine =pyr or isoxazole =ISOX), i. e., pyr. BF 2 X (X = CI or Br), ISOX. BF 2 X and (pyr) 2 BF 2 +. Those that would form 6 membered rings upon chelation do not chelate {{by any of the}} four methods. Polydentate aromatic ligands chelate effectively when the BF 2 source contained a weak Lewis base, e. g., ISOX. BF 3, ISOX. BF 2 X and Et 20. BF 3. Bidentate chelation by polydentate tertiaryamine and aromatic donors leads to nmr parameters that are significantly different then their (D) 2 BF 2 + relatives (D =monod~ntate t-amines or pyridines). The chelated haloboron cations (DD) BFCI+, and (DD) BFBr+ were generated from D. BFX 2 adducts for all ligands that form BF 2 + cations above. In addition, the (DD) BCI 2 + and (DD) BBr 2 + cations were formed from D. BX 3 adducts by the chelating aromatic ligands, except for the <b>aromatic</b> <b>ligand</b> 1, 8 -bis(dimethylamino) naphthalene, which formed only the (DD) BF 2 + cation, apparently due to its extreme steric hindrance. Chelation by a donor is a two-step reaction. For polydentate tertiary-amine ligands, the two rates appear to be very dependent on the two possible leaving groups on the central boron atom. The order of increasing ease of displacement for the donors was: pyr < Cl < Br < ISOX. The rate of chelation by polydentate aromatic ligands appears to be dependent on the displacement of the first ligand from the boron.
