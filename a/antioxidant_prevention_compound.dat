Scopolamine developed oxidative {{stress in the}} brain with the decreased levels of antioxidant enzymes and increased nitrite level. At the same time, a significant impairment of learning and memory occurred when evaluated by passive avoidance task (PAT) and Morris water maze (MWM) with concomitant increase of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity and decreased acetylcholine levels. Pre-treatment by Sch B (10, 25, 50 mg/kg) effectively prevented scopolamine-induced oxidative stress and improved behavioural tasks. Further, the scopolamine-induced increase in AChE activity was significantly suppressed {{and the level of}} acetylcholine was maintained as normal by Sch B treatment.

40|$|Oxidative {{stress is}} a {{hallmark}} of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). We propose that rather than causing damage because of the action of free radicals, oxidative stress deranges signaling pathways leading to tau hyperphosphorylation, {{a hallmark of}} the disease. Indeed, incubation of neurons in culture with 5  µM beta-amyloid peptide (Aβ) causes an activation of p 38 MAPK (p 38) that leads to tau hyperphosphorylation. Inhibition of p 38 prevents Aβ-induced tau phosphorylation. Aβ-induced effects are prevented when neurons are co-incubated with trolox (the water-soluble analog of vitamin E). We have confirmed these results in vivo, in APP/PS 1 double transgenic mice of AD. We have found that APP/PS 1 transgenic mice exhibit a high level of P-p 38 in the hippocampus but not in cortex and this is prevented by feeding animals with a diet supplemented with vitamin E. Our results underpin the role of oxidative stress in the altered cell signaling in AD pathology and suggest that <b>antioxidant</b> <b>prevention</b> may be useful in AD therapeutics...|$|R

40|$|Aberrant {{oxidative}} metabolism {{is one of}} the hallmarks of cancer. Reactive species overproduction could promote carcinogenesis via inducing genetic mutations and activating oncogenic pathways, and thus, antioxidant therapy was considered as an important strategy for cancer prevention and treatment. Caveolin- 1 (Cav- 1), a constituent protein of caveolae, has been shown to mediate tumorigenesis and progression through oxidative stress modulation recently. Reactive species could modulate the expression, degradation, posttranslational modifications, and membrane trafficking of Cav- 1, while Cav- 1 -targeted treatments could scavenge the reactive species. More importantly, emerging evidences have indicated that multiple antioxidants could exert antitumor activities in cancer cells and protective activities in normal cells by modulating the Cav- 1 pathway. Altogether, these findings indicate that Cav- 1 may be a promising oxidative stress-related target for cancer <b>antioxidant</b> <b>prevention.</b> Elucidating the underlying interaction mechanisms between oxidative stress and Cav- 1 is helpful for enhancing the preventive effects of antioxidants on cancer, for improving clinical outcomes of antioxidant-related therapeutics in cancer patients, and for developing Cav- 1 targeted drugs.

40|$|Fatigue crack {{propagation}} (FCP) {{can be affected}} by environment {{in a variety of}} ways, each of which may compromise the aircraft’s structural integrity. [1] Corrosion occurring during ground basing can alter the initial discontinuity state (IDS) and create a modified damage state (MDS), which may promote fatigue crack formation and growth during flight. This corrosion may also cause stress enhancement due to material thinning, or even retardation of fatigue crack growth if sufficiently rigid corrosion product forms in a crack. Also, atomic hydrogen produced on the alloy surface during localized corrosion may enter the metal and contribute to damage on subsequent mechanical loading. This corrosion fatigue (or environmental fatigue) problem has been the objective of considerable scientific study over the past 30 years, but important uncertainties hinder accurate rate and life prediction of operating airframe components. These uncertainties are the motivators behind this project whose goals are to improve the laboratory characterization, mitigation methods, basic understanding, and modeling of FCP laws necessary to manage fatigue in aerospace aluminum alloy structures.

40|$|Antimutagenic DNA damage-control is {{the central}} {{component}} of the homeostatic control essential for survival. Over eons of time, this complex DNA damage-control system evolved to control the vast number of DNA alterations produced by reactive oxygen species (ROS), generated principally by leakage of free radicals from mitochondrial metabolism of oxygen. Aging, mortality and cancer mortality are generally accepted {{to be associated with}} stem cell accumulation of permanent alterations of DNA, i. e., the accumulation of mutations. In a young adult, living in a low LET background of 0. 1 cGy/y, the antimutagenic system of prevention, repair and removal of DNA alterations reduces about one million DNA alterations/cell/d to about one mutation/cell/d. DNA alterations from background radiation produce about one additional mutation per 10 million cells/d. As mutations accumulate and gradually degrade the antimutagenic system, aging progresses at an increasing rate, mortality increases correspondingly, and cancer increases at about the fourth power of age. During the past three decades, genomic, cellular, animal and human data have shown that low-dose ionizing radiation, including acute doses up to 30 cGy, stimulates each component of the homeostatic antimutagenic control system of <b>antioxidant</b> <b>prevention,</b> enzymatic repair, and immunologic and apoptotic removal of DNA alterations. On the other hand, high-dose ionizing radiation suppresses each of these antimutagenic protective components. Populations living in high background radiation areas and nuclear workers with increased radiation exposure show lower mortality and decreased cancer mortality than the corresponding populations living in low background radiation areas and nuclear workers without increased radiation exposure. Both studies of cancer in animals and clinical trials of patients with cancer also show, with high statistical confidence, the beneficial effects of low-dose radiation...|$|R

40|$|Background: AIDS is {{the leading}} cause of {{preventable}} death in Malawi. Increasingly young people of primary school age are becoming infected with HIV due to a lack of basic knowledge about the disease and its <b>prevention,</b> <b>compounded</b> by socio-historical factors such as cultural norms about sex and the social position of girls and women. Education is considered therefore a key prevention strategy. This study investigated whether a specially designed AIDS education, delivered by specifically trained teachers, with active involvement and participation of adults and peers, would improve pupils' understanding of AIDS and help them to adopt positive attitudes towards sex and sexual practices and behaviours. Methods: Two rural and two urban primary schools were selected to be control or intervention schools. Teachers were recruited and specially trained. Pupils from classes 6, 7 and 8 participated. Parents and the wider community of the intervention schools were involved. Knowledge, attitudes, and self-reports of adopting protective sexual behaviours were tested pre- and post-intervention. Additional data was collected in interviews. Attendances at HIV clinic were monitored, and data were collected on marriage and pregnancy rates. Results: 366 pupils completed the study. The mean scores for all study groups significantly improved in the course of the study (p<O. OO 1). However, there were greater gains in the rural intervention school: early marriages and pregnancies among the intervention schools' girls reduced; many pupils attended HIV testing clinics.

As compared to the extensive research of the pharmacological activities of tanshinone IIa, few studies have dealed with its metabolism and pharmacokinetics. Hydroxylation is an important pathway in the metabolism of tanshinone IIa. However, the metabolites and primary cytochrome P 450 (CYP) isozymes responsible for tanshinone IIa hydroxylation remain to be determined in human. Here, we characterized tanshinone IIa hydroxylation by human liver microsomes (HLMs) and nine recombinant human CYP (rCYP) isozymes to identify what kinds of metabolites are present and which human CYP isozymes are involved. One hydroxyl metabolite was detected in reactions catalyzed by HLMs and rCYP 2 A 6, and was identified as tanshinone IIb by comparing the tandem mass spectra and the chromatographic retention time with that of the standard compound. A kinetic study showed that tanshinone IIa hydroxylation by HLMs and rCYP 2 A 6 followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics. The Km values of HLMs and rCYP 2 A 6 for tanshinone IIa hydroxylation were 5. 93 ± 0. 44 and 5. 22 ± 0. 31 μM, respectively. A CYP 2 A 6 selective inhibitor (8 -methoxypsoralen) inhibited tanshinone IIa metabolism almost completely, with no metabolite detectable, but other CYP-selective inhibitors exerted no inhibitory effects. Rates of tanshinone IIa hydroxylation correlated well (r > 0. 98, P < 0. 01) with rates of hydroxylation of the CYP 2 A 6 probe substrate coumarin from 15 individual HLMs. In combination, we demonstrate that tanshinone IIa is metabolized by HLMs to a single metabolite (tanshinone IIb) and the tanshinone IIa hydroxylation is specifically catalyzed by CYP 2 A 6 in HLMs. and that makes tanshinone IIa has potential use as an in vitro probe for CYP 2 A 6 catalytic activities. 国际药代...|$|R

40|$|Cardiovascular {{diseases}} and cancer {{are the leading}} causes of death in most countries. These diseases share many common risk factors as well as pathogenetic determinants, and their incidence is related to age in an exponential manner. Furthermore, it has become apparent that several treatments used in therapy or even in prevention of cancer can impair the structural and functional integrity of the cardiovascular system, giving rise to an interdisciplinary field: cardio-oncology. However, tumors and cardiovascular diseases also share common protective factors: they can be prevented either by avoiding exposure to recognized risk factors, and/or by favoring the intake of protective compounds and by modulating the host defense machinery These latter approaches are generally known as chemoprevention. A great variety of dietary and pharmacological agents {{have been shown to}} be potentially capable of preventing cancer in preclinical models, most of which are of plant origin. Phytochemicals, in particular diet-derived compounds, have therefore been proposed and applied in clinical trials as cancer chemopreventive agents. There is now increasing evidence that some phytochemicals can be also protective for the heart, having the potential to reduce cancer, cardiovascular disease and even anticancer drug-induced cardiotoxicity. We introduce the concept that these compounds induce pre-conditioning, a low level cellular stress that induces strong protective mechanisms conferring resistance to toxins such as cancer chemotherapeutics. Cancer cells and cardiomyocytes have fundamental differences in their metabolism and sensitivity to preconditioning, autophagy and apoptosis, so that dosage of the <b>prevention</b> <b>compounds</b> is important.

40|$|Sporadic cancers {{comprise}} {{the vast majority}} of diagnosed cancer cases, many with a largely environmental etiology. The mechanisms by which specific environmental factors influence cancer risk, however, remain widely uncharacterized. Because sporadic cancers are diagnosed later in life, many incident cancer studies poorly quantify previous exposures or utilize methodologies that may not be appropriate for the study of cancer initiation or prevention. Developing novel methods of studying the role of nutrition and the environment in carcinogenesis will provide essential insight towards the prevention, early identification, and treatment of cancer. Incorporating novel culture methods, including primary tissue culture, will allow for the study of specific and relevant normal cell populations, including stem cells, that may be particularly sensitive to environmental and nutritional factors. The overarching goal of this dissertation was to develop and apply novel statistical and experimental methods to characterize the roles of nutrition and the environment in carcinogenesis and cancer prevention, with a focus on epigenetic change. In Chapter 2, comprehensive epidemiological and clinical information were paired with DNA methylation profiling of head and neck tumors to identify significant differences in tumor DNA methylation in chemically induced or human papillomavirus induced tumors. In Chapter 3, data on average dietary intake was paired with tumor epigenetic measurements to identify that a head and neck cancer patient’s diet in the year before diagnosis can significantly affect tumor epigenetic profiles, providing a potential mechanism by which diet affects disease prognosis.

This approach has been particularly useful with isoflavones because of their abundance in specific foods, including soy foods.

NEAC (excluding coffee) was measured using Italian food composition tables in terms of ferric reducing-antioxidant power (FRAP), Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) and total radical-trapping antioxidant parameter (TRAP). The odds ratios (OR) of AMI, and the corresponding 95...|$|R
40|$|Dietary {{antioxidant}} intake {{has been}} reported to be inversely associated with coronary miery disease. To clarify the possible role oflipophilic <b>antioxidants</b> in the <b>prevention</b> of atherosclerosis, we investigated the effects ofubiquinol- 1 0 and ~-carotene on the susceptibility oflow-density lipoprotein(LD L) to oxidative modification. Methods: In this study,first "ubiquinol- 1 0 and ~-carotene" were added to plasma and incubated for 3 hr at 37 °C. Then, the LDL fraction was separated by ultracentrifugation. The oxidizability ofLDL was estimated by measuring conjugated diene (CD), lipid peroxides and thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) after cupric sulfate solution was added. Results: We showed that ubiquinone-! 0 and ~-carotene significantly (p ~-carotene. Conclusion: LDL exposed to the lipophilic antioxidants in vitro reduced oxidizability. These findings suggest that ubiquinol- 1 0 and ~-carotene have a role in ameliorating atherosclerosis...|$|R
40|$|Sarcopenia is an age-related {{clinical}} condition {{characterized by the}} progressive loss of motor units and wasting of muscle fibers resulting in decreased muscle function. The molecular mechanisms leading to sarcopenia are not completely identified, but the increased oxidative damage occurring in muscle cells {{during the course of}} aging represents one of the most accepted underlying pathways. In fact, skeletal muscle is a highly oxygenated tissue and the generation of reactive oxygen species is particularly enhanced in both contracting and at rest conditions. It has been suggested that oral antioxidant supplementation may contribute at reducing indices of oxidative stress both in animal and human models by reinforcing the natural endogenous defenses. Aim of the present paper is to discuss present evidence related to possible benefits of oral <b>antioxidants</b> in the <b>prevention</b> and treatment of sarcopenia...|$|R
40|$|Rabies is a viral encephalitis, {{nearly always}} fatal, but {{preventable}} through vaccines. Rabid animal bite {{is the prime}} transmission act, while veterinary vaccination {{is one of the}} best strategies for rabies general <b>prevention.</b> Aluminum <b>compounds</b> and saponin are the commercial adjuvants used for this vaccine nowadays. Nevertheless, aluminum compounds can provoke undesired side effects and saponin has a narrow activity range without toxicity. B. atrophaeus inactivated spores (BAIS), with or without saponin, were then used as an alternative to boost the inactivated rabies virus response. BAIS was as effective as saponin in augmenting antibody titers, but combination of both adjuvants doubled the titers raised by them individually. The combined adjuvant formulation maintained viability for 21 months when stored at 4 - 8 degrees C. Overall, BAIS was demonstrated as a viable alternative to commercial adjuvants, while its combination with saponin resulted in even higher vaccine potency with good stability. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
