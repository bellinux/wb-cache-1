Rolls-Royce staff visited a number of North American automobile manufacturers in order to select one to build the Merlin in the U.S. or Canada. Henry Ford rescinded an initial offer to build the engine in the U.S. in July 1940, and the Packard Motor Car Company was subsequently selected to take on the $130,000,000 Merlin order. Agreement was reached in September 1940, and the first Packard-built engine, a Merlin XX designated the V-1650-1, ran in August 1941.|$|E

500|$|Chlorine gas {{was first}} used by French chemist Claude Berthollet to bleach {{textiles}} in 1785. Modern bleaches resulted from further work by Berthollet, who first produced sodium hypochlorite in 1789 in his laboratory {{in the town of}} Javel (now part of Paris, France), by passing chlorine gas through a solution of sodium carbonate. The resulting liquid, known as [...] "Eau de Javel" [...] ("Javel water"), was a weak solution of sodium hypochlorite. This process was not very efficient, and <b>alternative</b> <b>production</b> methods were sought. Scottish chemist and industrialist Charles Tennant first produced a solution of calcium hypochlorite ("chlorinated lime"), then solid calcium hypochlorite (bleaching powder). These compounds produced low levels of elemental chlorine and could be more efficiently transported than sodium hypochlorite, which remained as dilute solutions because when purified to eliminate water, it became a dangerously powerful and unstable oxidizer. Near {{the end of the nineteenth}} century, E. S. Smith patented a method of sodium hypochlorite production involving electrolysis of brine to produce sodium hydroxide and chlorine gas, which then mixed to form sodium hypochlorite. This is known as the chloralkali process, first introduced on an industrial scale in 1892, and now the source of most elemental chlorine and sodium hydroxide. In 1884 Chemischen Fabrik Griesheim of Germany developed another chloralkali process which entered commercial production in 1888.|$|E

Interest in <b>alternative</b> <b>production</b> methods has grown recently due to ethical concerns in gavage-based foie gras production. Such livers are alternatively termed fatty goose liver, ethical foie gras, or humane foie gras. [...] The British supermarket chain Waitrose also provides a version of ethical foie gras which it calls (and has been trademarked) faux gras. This {{is not to be}} confused with the American product by the same name, produced by Regal Vegan, which has the US trademark for faux gras, and is actually a vegan, nut based spread.|$|E

40|$|<b>Alternative</b> Al <b>production</b> methods: Part 1 - {{a review}} of {{indirect}} carbothermal routes The production of Al from its ores at present relies on the Bayer (alumina production) and the Hall- Heroult (Al production) process. The cost associated with alumina production and apparent disadvantages of the Hall-Heroult process have led to intensive research to find alternative routes for Al production. The direct carbothermal reduction process has been thoroughly investigated as an alternative technique. Another alternative includes the indirect carbothermal reduction route where alumina (or aluminous ores) is first reduced to intermediate Al compounds before reduced further to Al. The present study reviews and provides systematic thermodynamic analyses of <b>alternative</b> Al <b>production</b> routes. In this paper (Part 1), {{a comprehensive review of}} <b>alternative</b> Al <b>production</b> techniques focusing on the indirect carbothermal reduction routes is presented.
