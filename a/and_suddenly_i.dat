The only thing I can really remember is that, when I was being brought home in a car, I was in that wonderful state of half-awakeness in which you hear all sorts of incredible sounds going through your mind. They were all orchestral sounds, but I was playing them all, <b>and</b> <b>suddenly</b> <b>I</b> was Hofmann. I was enchanted.|$|E

[...] He joined Hibernian when they were bottom of the Scottish Premier Division; Alex McLeish had recently been appointed manager.|$|E

But the success of Tirra Lirra, plus the prize it won and the two prizes The Impersonators won, made me feel less private and more vulnerable, and I had to get over {{that in order to}} go on at all.

500|$|An {{offensive}} minded player {{throughout his}} amateur and minor professional career, St. Louis {{was forced into}} a checking-line role by the Calgary Flames. He credits the experience for rounding out his game: [...] "I played a true third-line role, killing penalties and playing against the other team's top lines. For me, {{it was like a}} five-month crash course on developing my defensive game. My whole life, I had been an offensive player, <b>and</b> <b>suddenly</b> <b>I</b> was in the role of trying to be smart without the puck. I think those fifty-six games helped me develop into a complete player." ...|$|E
500|$|Composer Bear McCreary {{changed his}} synth {{programming}} {{for the series}} from [...] "warm, round tones" [...] to a [...] "mangled under heavy distortion" [...] sound. He began the episode without any synths, describing his music for the episode's opening scene as [...] "among the most shamelessly orchestral I’ve ever done for this series ... I wanted the score to feel like it belonged in the 1940's, with a retro, adventurous attitude." [...] Then, [...] "just as the audience begins to get used to" [...] the orchestral sound, the episode cuts to [...] "modern day <b>and</b> <b>suddenly</b> <b>I</b> bring in the new synths, with distorted basses blazing over the nastiest groove I've ever written for the show. The transition is hopefully as jarring as I intended—jumping from soaring orchestra to blasting electronica, as we leap forward in time seventy years." ...|$|E
500|$|Malone {{credited}} Howarth's versatility {{with the}} reason he was cast as Todd. [...] During a February 1993 interview with Soap Opera Digest (SOD), Howarth stated he was surprised he won the part. [...] "I really don't know how I made it," [...] he said. He met a One Life to Live casting director two years previously, while performing in a New York play, but, when the role of Todd opened up, he [...] "auditioned just like everybody else". He [...] "made it to callbacks, and [...] got the part". Howarth said, [...] "I was hired... to plant drugs in Jason Webb's jacket. All I knew was that my first name was Todd. I don't know what happened next. They called me in again <b>and</b> <b>suddenly</b> <b>I</b> had a last name 'Manning.' Then I get called to read another day." ...|$|E

60|$|Mine was a milder and slighter experience, but its thrill was of {{the same}} kind.

500|$|Nageswara Rao {{played the}} role of a 90-year-old man. His {{character}} enters the film just before the interval and remains until {{the very end of the}} film. All the members of the principal cast except Nageswara Rao played dual roles in the film. Nagarjuna said in an interview that he would be seen in the 1920s, 1980s and 2013 and would play a zamindar in 1920. Saran revealed that every character in the film would have a specific aspect; Nagarjuna's character loves cars. Regarding her role, Saran said that she would be seen as a poor but content farmer in the flashback sequences and a doctor in the present day. She added [...] "My character goes back to 1930s and comes back in the present era. I can't tell how it happens though. It's a fun character and you will find me stammering a lot. Suddenly, I'm talking normally <b>and</b> <b>suddenly</b> <b>I</b> start stammering, that's how you understand my character." [...] She added that apart from Nagarjuna, she has more scenes with Nageswara Rao and only a couple of scenes with Chaitanya in the film.|$|E
2500|$|After the woman's departure, Dick began {{experiencing}} strange hallucinations. Although initially attributing them to {{side effects}} from medication, he considered this explanation implausible {{after weeks of}} continued hallucinations.

And I found out that in fact there is Breguet watch, so I've never given commentaries that the Patriarch doesn't have it. There is a box with Breguet, but I've never worn it." [...] This triggered at least one Internet blogger to study the issue and collect images of Kirill's wristwear. [...] Some time later, photographs on his official website showed him wearing {{what appeared to be}} an expensive watch on his left wrist, ...|$|E

2500|$|Posing as {{a married}} couple, Argüello and Khaled boarded the plane using Honduran passports—having {{passed through a}} {{security}} check of their luggage—and were seated in the second row of tourist class. Once the plane was approaching the British coast, they drew their guns and grenades and approached the cockpit, demanding entrance. According to Khaled, {{in an interview in}} 2000,"So half an hour (after take off) we had to move. We stood up. I had my two hand grenades and I showed everybody I was taking the pins out with my teeth. Patrick stood up. We heard shooting just the same minute and when we crossed the first class, people were shouting but I didn't see who was shooting because it was behind us. So Patrick told me 'go forward I protect your back.' So I went and then he found a hostess {{and she was going to}} catch me round the legs. So I rushed, reached to the cockpit, it was closed. [...] So I was screaming 'open the door.' Then the hostess came; she said 'she has two hand grenades,' but they did not open (the cockpit door) <b>and</b> <b>suddenly</b> <b>I</b> was threatening to blow up the plane. I was saying 'I will count and if you don't open I will blow up the plane.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|During the Fragile Tour, Wakeman bought {{four books}} {{at an airport}} bookstall in Richmond, Virginia, {{including}} one about Henry VIII and his six wives titled The Private Life of Henry VIII (1964) by Scottish writer Nancy Brysson Morrison. As he read about Anne Boleyn on the subsequent flight to Chicago, a theme he recorded in November 1971 ran through his mind which he wrote on some hand drawn ledger lines and played during the sound check and the subsequent concert. Said Wakeman, [...] "I had been searching for a style to write in <b>and</b> <b>suddenly</b> <b>I</b> found it in writing music about these six ladies...I would concentrate {{on one of the}} wives and then music just came into my head and I would write it down. Sometimes I was flying, other times I was on stage, or {{just in front of the}} piano at home ... The six wives theme gave me the thread, the link, I needed to give me a reason for putting these pieces of music together." [...] He explains the album's concept further in its liner notes: [...] "The album is based around my interpretations of the musical characteristics of the wives of Henry VIII. Although the style may not always be in keeping with their individual history, it is my personal conception of their characters in relation to keyboard instruments." [...] Wakeman elaborated and wrote the music as if he was doing a surreal painting, [...] "sketches of how I felt about them at the time".|$|E

60|$|<b>And</b> yet, <b>suddenly,</b> <b>I</b> {{recognized}} Hamilton. I {{recognized him}} without effort, without a shock, without a start.

60|$|I {{had no time}} to dash out of the door. I {{was caught}} in a trap, and I felt cold <b>and</b> sick. <b>Suddenly</b> <b>I</b> caught sight of the ladder leading to the loft.

60|$|Again I was on {{the point}} of {{entering}} to administer a very stern reproof to that talkative rogue, when of a sudden there was a commotion within.
