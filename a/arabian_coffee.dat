On the other hand, Austria's popular Viennese coffeehouses were created with Europe's introduction to coffee. These coffeehouses are dissimilar in that they are not usually places of gathering, instead many people go to sit alone and enjoy coffee.

In addition, populations of P. coffeae vary in morphological and molecular features, as well as reproductive fitness and pathological potential. The objective {{of the present study was}} to compare the pathogenicity of two Brazilian P. coffeae populations, K- 5 from Coffea arabica roots and M- 2 from Aglaonema sp. roots, in terms of their influence on the plant growth and photosynthesis of <b>Arabian</b> <b>coffee</b> (C. arabica). Five experiments were conducted in controlled conditions, and the results demonstrated that K- 5 is pathogenic on coffee, as it can reproduce and causes obvious damage on the plant. Moreover K- 5 proved to be very virulent on <b>Arabian</b> <b>coffee,</b> considering its effects on seedling mortality, plant growth and photosynthesis. By contrast, M- 2 was considered to be of low virulence, or even non-pathogenic, on coffee because it failed to reproduce. Thus, the results indicate that K- 5 and M- 2 may be distinct species, supporting the hypothesis of previous authors...|$|E

In the present study, 36 osteoporotic postmenopausal and 25 healthy postmenopausal women as cases and controls respectively were selected from Armed Forces Hospital, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The study has designed to collect the data about the general characteristics (age, marital status, education, number of pregnancies, activity level, income and housing), anthropometric measurements, medical history and dietary intake by using both the methods (24 h recall, food frequency questionnaire). Serum samples were analyzed for calcium, phosphorus, vitamin D and Para Thyroid Hormone (PTH) and they were correlated with Bone Mineral Density (BMD). Food intake items were correlated with hip, neck and spin BMD. In results, cases found significantly older than controls and had history of bone fractures. Cases were consumed significantly less dietary calcium than controls. Serum parameters did not show any significant differences. However significant correlation was found between serum level of PTH and calcium with BMD of spine and right neck femur respectively. Banana and Mataziz (locally prepared dish with vegetables) showed positive correlation with hip BMD. A negative significant correlation was found between <b>Arabian</b> <b>coffee</b> and right neck femur BMD.

The increase intake of dates and gahwa (<b>Arabian</b> <b>coffee)</b> along with a high cholesterol diet in Saudi population as well as increased incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) has raised a concern {{about the effects of}} the Saudi diet on CVD risk. Golden Syrian hamsters were divided into six groups (six animals in each) as follows: 1) control (chow), 2) Dates-diet (50 % date pulp with chow), 3) Dates-diet + gahwa (replaced with drinking water), 4) cholesterol-diet (1 % cholesterol in chow), 5) dates-diet + 1 % cholesterol, 6) Dates-diet + gahwa + 1 % cholesterol. All the above dietary preparations were made every week and supplemented for 13 consecutive weeks. Plasma lipid profile including total cholesterol, triglycerides (TC), Low Density Lipoprotein (LDL), High Density Lipoprotein (HDL) were estimated. Total cholesterol and TC were estimated in liver, heart and kidney tissues. The high cholesterol-diet caused significant increase in body and organs (liver and kidney) weights as compared to controls. Dates-diet, significantly reduced the body and liver weight that increased by the high cholesterol-diet. Plasma lipids were significantly elevated by high cholesterol-diet supplementation and this increase was significantly decreased by the dates-diet. However, hepatic TC levels further increased when dates were combined with high cholesterol-diet supplementation. Gahwa intake either with dates alone or with high cholesterol-diet was not induced any significant changes in lipid parameters. In conclusion, the dates lowering effects on body weights and plasma lipid profile shows its beneficial affects against atherosclerosis development in humans.

As plantas apresentaram diferen√ßas significativas em termos de crescimento e aspectos fisiol√≥gicos e bioqu√≠micos O fornecimento de nitrog√™nio no m√™s de outubro proporcionou um aumento significativo nos teores de amino√°cidos totais e na atividade da redutase do nitrato. As folhas de plantas crescendo em condi√ß√µes de sombreamento natural apresentaram maior peso fresco a que pleno sol. O teor de prote√≠nas totais decresceu abruptamente a partir do m√™s 10 em todas as plantas analisadas, √©poca em coincidiu com o inicio do enchimento dos gr√£os. O aumento nos teores de amino√°cidos totais tamb√©m foi acompanhado por um aumento nos dias de chuva, na precipita√ß√£o e tamb√©m na radia√ß√£o global. N√£o houve efeito significativo com rela√ß√£o √° localiza√ß√£o da folhas (parte {{superior}} x parte inferior) nos aspectos analisados. O fornecimento de nitrog√™nio no m√™s 10 n√£o alterou a concentra√ß√£o de clorofila medida pelo clorofil√¥metro SPAD, e a clorofila total extra√≠da n√£o se alterou significativamente at√© o m√™s 11 exceto nas plantas de sol as folhas do parte superior tiveram uma maior s√≠ntese no m√™s 9. No m√™s 12 houve um aumento nas taxas de clorofila em todos os tratamentos. Os teores de N foliar tiveram correla√ß√£o positiva com as leituras de clorofila analisadas pelo SPAD, ate o m√™s 11. Tivemos tamb√©m no per√≠odo de analise, um aumento significativo na concentra√ß√£o de caroten√≥ides a partir do m√™s 8, evidenciando seu efeito foto protetor uma vez que houve tamb√©m um aumento na radia√ß√£o global no per√≠odo ao redor de 50 %. As folhas em condi√ß√µes de sombreamento natural apresentaram maior peso seco que as de pleno sol. O teor de prote√≠nas totais decresceu abruptamente a partir do m√™s 11 em todas as plantas, √©poca que coincidiu com o in√≠cio da produ√ß√£o/enchimento dos gr√£os. Houve um aumento nos teores de amido ap√≥s o m√™s 10 (exceto nas folhas da parte inferior das plantas de sol), vindo a diminuir em fun√ß√£o do enchimento dos gr√£os. Tamb√©m se observou uma s√≠ntese acentuada de a√ß√∫cares redutores no in√≠cio, decrescendo em fun√ß√£o do in√≠cio da forma√ß√£o dos gr√£os. Com rela√ß√£o aos nutrientes nas folhas analisadas, o mangan√™s teve um comportamento significativamente diferente em rela√ß√£o aos demais, onde nas folhas a pleno sol a concentra√ß√£o do elemento foi de 6 a 8 vezes √° das folhas sombreadas.

In month 12 had an increase on the levels of chlorophyll in all the treatments. The levels of foliar N had had positive correlation with the readings of chlorophyll analyzed by the SPAD, until month 11. We had also in the period of analyzes, a significant increase on the concentration of carotenoids from month 8, evidencing its photo protective effect. During this time also we had an increase in the global radiation in the period around 50 %. The leaves in conditions of natural shade had presented greater dry weight that of full sun. The total protein levels abruptly decreased from the month 11 in all plants, time coincident with the beginning of the production/filling up of the grains. The Month 10 also had an increase in starch levels (except in leaves of third inferior of the sunny plants), decreasing in function of the filling up of the grains. Also an increased synthesis of reducing sugars was observed at the beginning and a decrease during the beginning of the formation of the grains.

Dentre estas destacam-se as prog√™nies Bourbon Vermelho 959 correspondente a S 0, 43 - 18 - 11 correspondente a S 3 do cafeeiro 43 e 43 - 7 - 7 - 15 e 43 - 7 - 19 - 13 correspondente a S 4 dessa mesma planta, as quais tamb√©m foram analisadas com detalhes. Com rela√ß√£o √† altura das plantas no campo n√£o se notou heterose no h√≠brido Fr que apresenta altura m√©dia intermedi√°ria. Tamb√©m as autofecunda√ß√µes sucessivas parecem n√£o influir na redu√ß√£o do vigor vegetativo. Os dados obtidos foram aproveitados para an√°lise da variabilidade desse caracter√≠stico, calculando-se a vari√¢ncia para os canteiros e a vari√¢ncia total, bem como sua homogeneidade. Notou-se que Fx apresenta vari√¢ncia igual √† de uma das linhas puras e muito pr√≥xima da outra. Das duas linhas puras, a de n√∫mero 357 - 21 Dp mostrou-se pouco mais vari√°vel, cinco anos ap√≥s a transplanta√ß√£o para o local definitivo. Embora o h√≠brido F 1 tenha produzido mais caf√© cereja no conjunto de tr√™s anos do que as linhas puras, a diferen√ßa n√£o foi significativa. O h√≠brido se mostrou menos vari√°vel quanto a este caracter√≠stico, embora as vari√¢ncias n√£o sejam tamb√©m significativamente diferentes. Nas outras prog√©nies estudadas os valores da vari√¢ncia foram bem maiores, com tend√™ncia de aumento com as sucessivas autofecunda√ß√µes. As linhas isog√™nicas analisadas ano por ano deram indica√ß√µes de que a vari√¢ncia do h√≠brido permaneceu menor, com exce√ß√£o de um ano apenas. Varia√ß√£o bem acentuada foi encontrada entre as prog√©nies constantes do ensaio no tocante √†s porcentagens de sementes do tipo moca. O h√≠brido H 1934 apresentou menor quantidade de sementes moca do que as linhas puras e significativamente menos que a prog√™nie 357 - 21 Dp. Quanto √† variabilidade, a do h√≠brido se mostrou intermedi√°ria, aproximando-se da linha pura com vari√¢ncia maior. As vari√¢ncias das outras prog√™nies estudadas s√£o bem mais elevadas, notando-se tend√™ncia de aumento com as autofecunda√ß√µes sucessivas. Com rela√ß√£o √†s sementes concha, a porcentagem m√©dia para o h√≠brido n√£o difere das linhas puras e o valor da vari√¢ncia √© intermedi√°rio. Para as demais prog√™nies analisadas os valores das vari√¢ncias s√£o maiores e mostram tend√™ncia de redu√ß√£o com as autofecunda√ß√µes. O valor da peneira m√©dia correspondente ao tamanho das sementes n√£o difere para as tr√™s linhas isog√™nicas, a variabilidade sendo, por√©m, menor para o h√≠brido. Para as outras prog√™nies n√£o se notou redu√ß√£o do tamanho como efeito da autofecunda√ß√£o e as suas vari√¢ncias n√£o mostram tend√™ncia de aumento ou redu√ß√£o nas gera√ß√µes estudadas. Dos itens analisados, destacam-se como mais promissores do ponto de vista da produ√ß√£o e altura das plantas (a qual pode representar o vigor vegetativo) a prog√©nie de Bourbon Vermelho 959 e a de Bourbon Amarelo J 24 ex. Dependendo do caracter√≠stico analisado, notou-se que a vari√¢ncia entre plantas nos canteiros do h√≠brido F 1 pode ser igual, intermedi√°ria ou menor do que a das linhas puras. Em nenhum caso, por√©m, a vari√¢ncia do h√≠brido se mostrou maior que a das linhas puras. Three {{isogenic}} progenies of Red Bourbon coffee (Coffea arabica L. var. bourbon (B. Rodr.) Choussy) {{were investigated}} {{in relation to}} several characteristics in a balanced lattice experiment with 16 entries, five replications, each plot with four individual plants. Two of these isogenic progenies were obtained by artificial self-pollination of two plants which were derived from haploid sporophytes after their chromosomes were duplicated (357 - 21 and RP 13). The third isogenic progeny is the F 1 of the hybrid between those duplicated plants (H 1934). Among the remaining 13 entries of this trial more attention {{was given to the}} following progenies of Red Bourbon coffee: 959, S 0 from open pollinated seeds taken in a private farm; 43 - 18 - 11, selfed S 3 from a selected plant; 43 - 7 - 7 - 15 and 43 - 7 - 19 - 13, selfed S 4 progenies of similar pedigrees. Plant height was measured for all entries five years after transplantation to the field. It was observed that the F 1 did not show heterosis for this characteristic, its average height being intermediate between those of the two isogenic progenies. The within plot variance presented by the F 1 is equal to that of one of the pure lines and close to that of the other. The average height presented by the S 3 and the S 4 progenies originally derived from plant C 43 suggests that successive selfing does not reduce plant height (Table 3). Total yields in kilograms of riped fruits of individual plants were recorded for {{the first three years of}} crops. The mean yield of the F 1 is higher than those of the two isogenic lines, although this difference is not significant. The within plot variance of yields is smaller for the F 1 than for the two pure lines, but again the differences are not significant. When separate analyses were made for the annual crops of the three isogenic progenies, it was seen that the smallest within plot variance was presented by the F 1 in two of the three years. The within plot variances for the total yields of the S 3 and S 4 progenies were higher than those presented by the isogenic progenies, showing a tendency to become larger with successive selfings (Tables 4 and 5). Observations were also made on the percentages of three different seed types produced by coffee plants, namely, the flat, normal seeds, "moca" (peaberry) and "concha" seeds. "Moca" seeds result from the development of a single ovule after a precocious abortion of the second ovule in the ovary. "Concha" seeds are those born from independent ovules which may eventually occur in the same fruit lo-cule. Abnormal frequencies of these abnormal seed types are clearly under genetic control and apparently the percentage of "moca" beans is more subjected to environmental influences. Lower percentages of "moca" seeds were found for the F 1 hybrid than for the two pure lines. The value of the F 1 variance for percentage of "moca" is intermediate between those of the pure lines and closer to the highest vafcie. Higher variances in the percentage of this seed type were found for the other progenies, showing also a tendency to increase with more generations of selfing. The percentages of "concha" seeds were not different among the three isogenic lines, the F 1 variance for this seed type being intermediate. Higher variances for the percentage of "concha" seeds were found for the other progenies, together with an indication that successive selfings may reduce the incidence of this seed types (Tables 6 and 7). Seed size was graded for all plants during the three years of crop in a series of sieves differing by 1 / 64 of an inch. No differences were noticed between isogenic progenies, although the F 1 variance for seed size was lower (Table 8). It is concluded that a definite trend can not be observed for the variability within isogenic progenies of the <b>arabian</b> <b>coffee</b> plant, which is a predominantly autogamous species. Depending on the characteristic under observation, the variances of the F 1 hybrid may be lower, equal to or higher than the variances presented by the isogenic progenies of the homozygous plants that entered the cross. (Table 9). Although these data refer only to the first three years of crop, it may be pointed out that no instance was found where the Fx presented higher variances than those of the two isogenic progenies...|$|E
