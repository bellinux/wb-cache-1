500|$|IGN's Meghan Sullivan {{found the}} {{portrayal}} of the cadets' involvement in the war [...] "incredibly moving" [...] and was intrigued by the story's focus on war, but found the need to understand Orience's lore and mythology made the ending convoluted. Becky Cunningham of GamesRadar {{was fascinated by the}} game's setting <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> it posed about morality and memory, finding the story worth experiencing. Alexa Ray Corriea, writing for GameSpot, generally enjoyed the story despite noting the main plot becoming complicated quickly, but stated that the ending introduced too many new story elements for comfort. Michael Damiani of GameTrailers found the overall story enjoyable, but gaps in story and character development, along with the need to replay the game to get the full story, [...] " [...] you full of questions and doubt from beginning to end." [...] Eurogamer's Chris Schilling was similarly critical of the need to understand terms unfamiliar to series newcomers. He also disliked the length of cutscenes, and the jarring change from grim imagery to lighter subjects like chocobo breeding. Tom Sykes of Official Xbox Magazine said that the setting and story's superficial similarities to the later Harry Potter books improved the story after the confusing opening. Game Informers Matt Miller stated that the story started strongly, but was made less enjoyable when it began focusing on the game's overarching narrative and said the abundance of characters had a negative impact on their characterization. RPGFan's Stephen Meyerink, despite saying the game had [...] "goofy faces and silly moments", found the story and themes engaging. Samuel Roberts of PC Gamer was less positive, feeling that the story and characters reminded him too much of poor-quality anime series.|$|E
500|$|The philosopher Frederick Suppe {{considered}} Sexual Preference a {{very important}} study that failed to duplicate the findings of Bieber et al. or the predictions of symbolic interactionism, labeling theory, and societal reaction theory approaches. Suppe considered Bell et al.′s sample of homosexuals, while highly biased, to nevertheless be the most representative ever made, and argued that biased samples can be adequate {{for the purposes of}} refuting theories propounded in other studies [...] "so long as the types of subjects used in those other studies constitute a subsample of the replicative study′s sample and the latter's population does not go beyond the claimed scope of the replicated studies." [...] He maintained that Bell et al.′s study meets these requirements, that their use of path analysis was appropriate, and that their procedures for developing a composite etiology model, which contained [...] "virtually all paths advanced in the literature", are legitimate. He argued that the only plausible basis for disputing that the study definitively refutes [...] "social learning theories of homosexual etiology" [...] is to challenge the adequacy of Bell et al.′s models <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> they used. However, he questioned some of the details of Bell et al.′s methodology, including the questions asked. He wrote that while Bell et al. did not use the same specific questions that Bieber et al. employed, they did use [...] "questions directed at the same concerns." [...] He noted that Bell et al.′s data regarding subjects′ negative feelings toward and relationships with their fathers were based on open-ended interview questions, adding {{that it would have been}} preferable had they employed the same [...] "structured-answer questions" [...] used in Bieber et al.′s earlier study. He rejected Bell et al.′s claim that their study supports a biological explanation of sexual orientation. He wrote that since Bell et al.′s study, research into the [...] "social causes of homosexuality" [...] has become [...] "moribund." ...|$|E
500|$|The game's {{story and}} {{characters}} were well received. Electronic Gaming Monthly {{said it is}} [...] "rich in story and character development." [...] Game Informer and Next Generation agreed that the plot {{was one of the}} game's highlights, the former drawing comparisons to Star Wars, Star Blazers, the Old Testament, and many other Square games, making it [...] "a game every RPG fanatic must play." [...] IGN said the storyline is intricate, engrossing, [...] "deep, complex, {{and once in a while}} even confusing, until more of the real underlying plotline is uncovered." [...] GameSpot said the story is [...] "excellent" [...] and [...] "thought-provoking" [...] but said it can be [...] "a little preachy at times", but went on to say that the religious and existential themes [...] "enhance the story and [...] understanding of the game's deep characterizations". Game Revolution described the storyline as [...] "epic" [...] and [...] "fabulous" [...] with [...] "many twists and turns" [...] and a large cast of characters. RPGFan said [...] "the story is unique and probably the most complex and interesting of any RPG", giving it a 99% rating for the story. Retrospectively, Edge praised the plot's scope and ambition and the protagonist as the [...] "most complicated Freudian hero" [...] in video games, but said it has a [...] "flawed" [...] script and [...] "muddied" [...] translation, as well as too many cut scenes, especially on the second disc, where the use of the world map is restricted for an extended period and the amount of cut scenes increases. Years after the game's release, Jeremy Parish of Electronic Gaming Monthly called the game's plot [...] "one of the wackiest game plotlines ever", but said that it [...] "actually makes sense" [...] if the player ignores all of the sideplots. IGN, however, stated that despite having too many cut scenes and a sometimes confusing plot, [...] "immersion is a key factor in Xenogears <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> you may have about the storyline are all answered at some point in the game." [...] Following the PSN release, RPGFan's James Quentin Clark said Xenogears has [...] "hands down the best single story I have seen in any video game," [...] giving it a 100% rating for the story.|$|E

2500|$|The {{confession}} album, or confession book, {{was a kind}} of autograph book {{popular in}} late nineteenth century Britain.

[...] The same kind of form is now found in the Dutch vriendenboek ("friends [...] book") and German Freundschaftsbuch ("friendship book"), used by small children; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> that the confession album contained live on in the Proust Questionnaire often used for celebrity interviews.|$|E
2500|$|Some of the {{questions}} that many viewers said they considered irrelevant when measured against the faltering economy or the Iraq war, like why Senator Barack Obama did not wear an American flag pin on his lapel, the incendiary comments of Obama’s former pastor, or Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton’s assertion that she had to duck sniper fire in Bosnia more than a decade ago.

Included in that category were continued questions about Obama's former pastor, Senator Hillary Clinton's assertion that she had to duck sniper fire in Bosnia more than a decade ago, and Senator Obama's not wearing an American flag pin.

2500|$|In {{the book}} Eiseley conveys {{his sense of}} wonder at the depth {{of time and the}} vastness of the universe. He uses his own experiences, {{reactions}} to the paleontological record, and wonderment at the world to address the topic of evolution. More specifically, the text concentrates on human evolution and human ignorance. In The Immense Journey, Eiseley follows the journey from human ignorance at the beginning of life to his own wonderment about the future of mankind. Marston Bates writes, [...] "It seems to me... that Eiseley is looking at man in a quite hard-headed fashion, because he is willing to sketch problems for which he has no present and sure solution. We are not going to find the answers in human evolution until we have framed the right questions, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> are difficult because they involve both body and mind, physique and culture—tools and symbols as well as cerebral configurations." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Concordat, wrote William Shirer, [...] "was hardly put {{to paper}} {{before it was}} being broken by the Nazi Government". On 25 July, the Nazis promulgated their {{sterilization}} law, an offensive policy {{in the eyes of}} the Catholic Church. Five days later, moves began to dissolve the Catholic Youth League. Clergy, nuns and lay leaders began to be targeted, leading to thousands of arrests over the ensuing years, often on trumped up charges of currency smuggling or [...] "immorality".

2500|$|In {{a review}} titled [...] "The last labour of Hercules", Matthew Coady in The Guardian, on 9 October 1975, {{wrote that the}} book was both [...] "a curiosity and a triumph". He {{repeated}} {{the tale of the}} book being written some thirty years before and then stated that, [...] "through it, Dame Agatha, whose recent work has shown a decline, is seen once more at the peak of her ingenuity." [...] Coady called Captain Hastings the [...] "densest of Dr Watsons ... never has the stupidity of the faithful companion-chronicler been so cunningly exploited as it is here." [...] Coady summarised the absolute basics of the plot <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> raised within it and then said,In providing the answers, the great illusionist of crime fiction provides a model demonstration of reader manipulation. The seemingly artless, simplistic Christie prose is mined with deceits. Inside the old, absurd conventions of the Country House mystery she reworks the least likely person trick with a freshness rivalling the originality she displayed nearly 50 years ago in The Murder of Roger Ackroyd. For the egotistic Poirot, hero of some 40 books… it is a dazzlingly theatrical finish. [...] 'Goodbye, cher ami', runs his final message to the hapless Hastings. 'They were good days.' For addicts, everywhere, they were among the best.|$|E
2500|$|There are {{problems}} on both extremes {{of the gun}} transmission debate. Its proponents emphasize the older history of gunpowder evolution as attested by historical records and archaeological samples in China, its less obviously militarily focused name as [...] "fire medicine," [...] the Mongol role as a catalyst in disseminating gunpowder technology, and criticizes the scant or absent evidence of prior experimentation with gunpowder in Europe for non-military purposes {{before the arrival of}} the gun. However, there are still several blanks in the history of a gun transmission theory <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> they raise which its proponents have been unable to answer. The rapid spread of guns across Eurasia, only 50 years from China to Europe, with non-existent evidence of its route from one extreme of the continent to the other, remains a mystery. Other Chinese inventions such as the compass, paper, and printing took centuries to reach Europe, with events such as the Battle of Talas as perhaps a possible takeoff point for discussion. No such event exists on record for either gunpowder or the gun. There is simply no clear route of transmission, and while the Mongols are often pointed to as the likeliest vector, Timothy May points out that [...] "there is no concrete evidence that the Mongols used gunpowder weapons on a regular basis outside of China." [...] A conclusion most military historians in the transmission camp have come to is that the rapid diffusion of gunpowder and the gun is probably best explained by its clear military applications.|$|E
