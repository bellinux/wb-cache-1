[...] Offered the chance to assess his own placement among the game's greats, he said, [...] "I haven't mastered the homers or RBI. The little things, I probably mastered." [...] Of his various records and achievements, he values his career runs scored mark the most: [...] "You have to score to win." ...|$|E
500|$|I don't {{want people}} being crushed.

There is a global anxiety about how fragile {{the status quo is}} and the safety of citizens, but in my mind—honestly—this film is in another realm. There is no {{correlation}} to the real world. There is no fear of a copycat Kaiju attack because a Kaiju saw it on the news and said, [...] "I'm going to destroy Seattle." [...] In my case, I'm picking up a tradition. One that started right after World War II and was a coping mechanism, in a way, for Japan to heal the wounds of that war. And it's integral for a Kaiju to rampage in the city.|$|E
500|$|Erica Futterman for Rolling Stone favoured their live {{acoustic}} performances as both showing, [...] "Horan's {{ability to play}} guitar, as well as One Direction's admirable live vocals. There {{was no need to}} worry about a backing track or a bum note, a pleasant realization at a pop show." [...] Herald Suns Cameron Adams opined that One Direction have [...] "strong pop voices". Melody Lau of the National Post wrote, [...] "It's easy to get lost in inherent appeal of their perfectly coiffed dos and almost-too-put-together preppy style but somewhere {{in the midst of all}} the love-struck squeals of teenage girls <b>are</b> <b>guys</b> who can actually sing and, to a certain extent, entertain." [...] Jane Stevenson of the portal site Canoe concurred: [...] "What I didn't really prepare myself for was that they all can actually sing in concert." [...] Chris Richards, writing in The Washington Post, dissented from the approval: [...] "As the five traded couplets, it was tough to imagine a future Justin Timberlake, Ricky Martin or Bobby Brown emerging from the pack. No one voice stood out." [...] Mike Wass of Idolator felt One Direction's [...] "surprisingly accomplished effort" [...] of Kings of Leon's [...] "Use Somebody" [...] proved that One Direction are [...] "more than capable" [...] of evolving their sound.|$|E

500|$|Lars Brandle (Billboard) {{reviewed}} the {{concert at the}} BBEC Great Hall in Brisbane. Brandle predominantly noted the band's popularity: [...] "To say [...] is the hottest boy-band on the scene, doesn't quite grasp the situation. [...] "On fire" [...] {{is closer to the}} mark." [...] Brandle commended the show for being [...] "all slick, clean fun". Erica Futterman (Rolling Stone) wrote in a title for the concert at the Beacon Theatre in New York, [...] "U.K. boy band relies on vocal prowess and charisma to keep fan base loyal." [...] Futterman highlighted their acoustic performances, which [...] "showed off Horan's ability to play guitar, as well as One Direction's admirable live vocals".Futterman concluded that there [...] "was no need to worry about a backing track or a bum note, a pleasant realization at a pop show". Jane Stevenson (Canoe.ca) maintained that the show at the Molson Canadian Amphitheatre in Toronto had [...] "none of that choreographed dance move nonsense", and complimented the [...] "naturally, classy, low-key" [...] production. Melody Lau (National Post) {{reviewed the}} same concert. Lau opined, [...] "It's easy to get lost in inherent appeal of their perfectly coiffed dos and almost-too-put-together preppy style but somewhere {{in the midst of all}} the love-struck squeals of teenage girls <b>are</b> <b>guys</b> who can actually sing and, to a certain extent, entertain." [...] Lau additionally noted One Direction's lack of original material to perform, [...] "the group falls back on a handful of covers to fill in their set, including Kings of Leon's [...] "Use Somebody", Gym Class Heroes' [...] "Stereo Hearts" [...] and, surprisingly, Natalie Imbruglia's [...] "Torn". Not straying too far away from the originals, the mid-show medley definitely felt like the boys randomly belting out songs for the sake of filler but girls didn't mind." ...|$|E

2500|$|However, the 2003 {{season was}} also spotted with {{controversy}} involving Singh surrounding the year's {{event at the}} Bank of America Colonial. LPGA star Annika Sörenstam {{became the first woman}} to play at a PGA Tour event since Babe Zaharias at the 1945 Los Angeles Open. Surrounding this fervor, Singh was misquoted as having said that Sörenstam [...] "didn't belong" [...] on the men's tour and that he would not play if he were paired with her. What he actually said is {{that he would not be}} paired with her because his playing partner was being selected from the past champion's pool. Singh later clarified, [...] "There <b>are</b> <b>guys</b> out there trying to make a living. It's not a ladies' tour. If she wants to play, she should—or any other woman for that matter—if they want to play the man's tour, they should qualify and play like everybody else." ...|$|E

6000|$|But I {{admit it}} is a {{disadvantage}} {{that they have}} not a saint or hero to crown in effigy as well as a traitor to burn in effigy. I admit that popular Protestantism has become too purely negative for people to wreathe in flowers the statue of Mr. Kensit or even of Dr. Clifford. I do not disguise my preference for popular Catholicism; which still has statues that can be wreathed in flowers. I wish our national feast of fireworks revolved round something positive and popular. I wish the beauty of a Catherine Wheel were displayed to the glory of St. Catherine. I should not especially complain if Roman candles were really Roman candles. But this negative character does not destroy the national character; which began at least in disinterested faith and has ended at least in disinterested fun. There is nothing disinterested at all about the new commercial fireworks. There is nothing so dignified as a dingy guy among the lights of Broadway. In that thoroughfare, indeed, the very word guy has another and milder significance. An American friend congratulated me on the impression I produced on a lady interviewer, observing, 'She says you're a regular guy.' This puzzled me a little at the time. 'Her description is no doubt correct,' I said, 'but I confess that it would never have struck me as specially complimentary.' But it appears that {{it is one of the}} most graceful of compliments, in the original American. A guy in America is a colourless term for a human being. All men <b>are</b> <b>guys,</b> being endowed by their Creator with certain ... but I am misled by another association. And a regular guy means, I presume, a reliable or respectable guy. The point here, however, is that the guy in the grotesque English sense does represent the dilapidated remnant of a real human tradition of symbolising real historic ideals by the sacramental mystery of fire. It is a great fall from the lowest of these lowly bonfires to the highest of the modern sky-signs. The new illumination does not stand for any national ideal at all; and what is yet more to the point, it does not come from any popular enthusiasm at all. That is where it differs from the narrowest national Protestantism of the English institution. Mobs have risen in support of No Popery; no mobs are likely to rise in defence of the New Puffery. Many a poor crazy Orangeman has died saying, 'To Hell with the Pope'; it is doubtful whether any man will ever, with his last breath, frame the ecstatic words, 'Try Hugby's Chewing Gum.' These modern and mercantile legends are imposed upon us by a mercantile minority, and we are merely passive to the suggestion. The hypnotist of high finance or big business merely writes his commands in heaven with a finger of fire. All men really <b>are</b> <b>guys,</b> in the sense of dummies. We are only the victims of his pyrotechnic violence; and it is he who hits us in the eye.|$|E
