50|$|Astasis {{has been}} seen in {{patients}} with diverse thalamic lesions, predominantly affecting the posterior lateral region of the brain. It is most frequently accompanied by <b>abasia,</b> although not always. <b>Abasia</b> is a symptom very similar to it and is the inability to walk. The two are most commonly seen in astasia-abasia, which is also called Blocq's disease. It is more common for astasia and <b>abasia</b> to be seen together {{than it is to}} see either one or the other.|$|E

50|$|Astasia-abasia {{refers to}} the {{inability}} to either stand or walk in a normal manner. Astasia {{refers to the}} inability to stand upright unassisted. <b>Abasia</b> refers to lack of motor coordination in walking. The term <b>abasia</b> literally means that the base of gait (the lateral distance between the two feet) is inconstant or unmeasurable. When seen in conversion disorder, the gait is bizarre and is not suggestive of a specific organic lesion: often the patient sways wildly and nearly falls, recovering at the last moment.|$|E
50|$|Lesions in {{the spinal}} cord or the spinal root can cause damage to a nerve or nerve root. Depending on where the {{abnormality}} is in a patient they can experience {{a wide range of}} symptoms, including those that are found in patients with astasis. It has been seen that patients with spinal atrophy who have astasia without <b>abasia</b> have neither sensory disturbances of the lower limbs or weakness in the hip extensor flexor muscles. This helps to indicate that one of the main causes of astasia without <b>abasia</b> is weakness in the triceps surae muscle.|$|E
50|$|Astasia and/or <b>abasia</b> are {{associated}} with the corresponding fears of walking and/or standing, variously called stasophobia, basophobia, stasiphobia, basiphobia, stasobasophobia, stasibasiphobia, etc., sometimes turning into pathological forms, i.e. phobias.|$|E

50|$|Damage to the {{peripheral}} nerves {{coming from the}} legs to the somatosensory area is the leading candidate {{for the cause of}} astasis. These damaged nerves prevent feedback for stabilization of posture for patients with astasis. This causes a disturbance in postural movements, such as a swaying around the legs and hip joints. This swaying may be seen only when a patient in standing still, and may disappear before walking, indicating that these patients exhibit astasia without <b>abasia.</b> This impairment of sensation is not always required for the sensation to develop. However, impairment often worsens astasia.|$|E
5000|$|Aboulia or abulia (from βουλή, meaning [...] "will", {{with the}} prefix -a), in neurology, {{refers to a}} lack of will or {{initiative}} and {{can be seen as a}} disorder of diminished motivation (DDM). Aboulia falls in the middle of the spectrum of diminished motivation, with apathy being less extreme and akinetic mutism being more extreme than aboulia. A patient with aboulia is unable to act or make decisions independently. It may range in severity from subtle to overwhelming. It is also known as Blocq's disease (which also refers to <b>abasia</b> and astasia-abasia). Aboulia was originally considered to be a disorder of the will.|$|E
50|$|Weakness of the triceps surae muscle {{has been}} seen in many {{patients}} who {{have been diagnosed with}} astasis. This weakness can be caused by a myopathy to that muscle group. The bilateral triceps surae muscle, made up of the gastrocnemius and the soleus, is essential to maintain a straight posture while standing. This indicates that weakness to this muscle is the cause of the swaying and impaired posture in patients with astasis. This weakness is seen regardless of whether somatosensory feedback from the legs is impaired, suggesting {{it is one of the}} main causes of astasia without <b>abasia.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{first edition}} of The Merck Manual was {{published}} in 1899 by Merck & Co., Inc. for physicians and pharmacists and was titled Merck’s Manual of the Materia Medica. The 192 page book which sold for US $1.00, was divided into three sections, Part I (“Materia Medica”) was an alphabetical listing of all known compounds thought to be of therapeutic value with uses and doses; Part II (“Therapeutic Indications”) was an alphabetical compendium of symptoms, signs, and diseases {{with a list of}} all known treatments; and Part III (“Classification of Medicaments (sic) According to their Physiologic Actions”) was a listing of therapeutic agents according to their method of action or drug classification. Many of the terms used are now considered archaic, such as <b>abasia,</b> astasia, errhines and rubefacients - sternutatories, and many of the agents listed are now not considered to be standard therapeutic agents but were considered useful at the time, including poisonous compounds such as mercury, lead, strychnine and arsenic. There were 108 remedies listed for indigestion (dyspepsia), including alcohol, arsenic, cocaine, gold chloride, mercury, morphine, nux vomica, opium, silver nitrate, strychnine, and “Turkish baths (for malaise after dining out)”. Bismuth, calcium, magnesium salts were also on the list, which are ingredients found in many modern gastrointestinal treatments available today. Arsenic was recommended for over 100 illnesses including anemia, diarrhea, hydrophobia, elephantiasis, and impotence. The formulas include “aletris cordial”, a “uterine tonic and restorative”, which contained “aletris farinosa or True Unicorn combined with aromatics”. The manufacturer, Rio Chemicals of St. Louis was clear to differentiate the inclusion of true unicorn rather than false unicorn in its preparation.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} {{the role of}} weakness of the bilateral triceps surae muscles-the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles-in astasia without <b>abasia</b> and whether compensating for muscle weakness with ankle-foot orthoses improves this disability. DESIGN: Case-control study of clinical findings and before and after trial of ankle-foot orthoses. SETTING: Clinics of the departments of rehabilitation medicine of two university hospitals. PATIENTS: A stilts group consisting of 23 patients with astasia without <b>abasia,</b> and a non-stilts group without this phenomenon consisting of 12 patients with hereditary motor sensory neuropathy, 15 patients with lumbosacral spondylotic radiculopathy or spondylolisthesis, and 20 healthy volunteers. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Clinical findings of the stilts and non-stilts groups were compared and the sensitivity and specificity of each clinical finding was calculated. The length of the centre of foot pressure (COP) while standing was measured in a bilateral below knee amputee and 16 consecutive patients in the stilts group with and without ankle-foot orthoses. RESULTS: Weakness of the triceps surae muscles was the only finding that differed significantly {{between the two groups}} and was both sensitive and specific. The amputee was unable to stand in place without dorsiflexion bumpers, which functioned similarly to the triceps surae muscle. Bilateral ankle-foot orthoses improved the COPs of 14 out of 16 patients. CONCLUSION: The main cause of astasia without <b>abasia</b> is weakness of the triceps surae muscles, and this disability is improved by bilateral ankle-foot orthoses...|$|E

In addition, an opsoclonus, myoclonia and introvert behaviour developed. MRI of the brain, EEG, extensive tests of blood, urine and CSF showed no abnormalities. Based on clinical symptoms only, {{the diagnosis of}} opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome (OMS) could be made. Under the suspicion of a neuroblastoma, further investigations were performed: a lateral and antero-posterior X-ray examination of the chest showed no tumour; neither did ultrasound of the abdomen. Concentrations of catecholamines and their metabolites in 24 h urine were normal and none of five tested anti-neuronal antibodies were found. However, a total-body scintigraphy with [I(123) ] metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) revealed a paravertebral hot spot {{on the left side}} compatible with a neural crest tumour. A MRI scan of the abdomen confirmed the supraphrenic lesion. [I(123) ]MIBG uptake was sufficient for [I(131) ]MIBG therapy. The response of the tumour to this therapy was favourable.

40|$|News {{of death}} - {{concatenated}} recordings. People from Ujir tend {{to spend at}} least part of their time in Dobo, the capital of Kabupaten Aru. When somebody from Ujir dies in Dobo efforts are made to urgently bring the body to Ujir. In this case, a woman called <b>Abasia</b> Walay died in Dobo. The recordings were made in Ujir the night when the news of her death reached the village, but before the body was taken to Ujir. In the first sequences wailing children gather in a house by the home of the deceased. At this stage the adults are engaged in practical preparations for the coming funeral. The recordings here are all made during the night between the 22 nd and 23 rd August 2013. In one sequence, Wellfelt speaks in Indonesian with a woman called Jumila Baubesi: The deceased is a relative of Jumila’s husband, Gani Baubesi, the village secretary. Jumila reports that her husband has gone to the pearling company on the nearby island Wasir to ask permission to borrow a speed boat for transport of the deceased woman. Accoring to the consultant, <b>Abasia</b> Walay was sick for years, coughing. She was taken to Papua and to different village healers in search for a remedy to the illness. <b>Abasia</b> Walay (born 1964) was married to Hasim Walay (born 1950). They had two children, Susan born 1990 and Wayu born 2003. Susan studies in Tual, but she had gone home for Idul fitri, the celebrations {{at the end of the}} Muslim fasting month Ramadan. Thus Susan was present at her mother’s funeral in Ujir. Wayu still stayed with his parents when his mother died. (The family is included in the Ujir survey as inhabitants of RU 162). Towards the end of the sequence the men are busy building a temporary shelter in front of the house of the deceased. This is used during mourning ceremonies and communal dinners in the days after the funeral. The house is decorated with white textiles; in Ujir the villagers are Muslims, and as is common in Islam white is the colour of death and mourning. The sequence ends with night shots from the pier in front of Ujir, viewing lights from the mosque that was under construction, flickering lights from a landed boat and finally the rising moon. People stayed up all night waking and waiting for the boat to arrive with the dead woman. Due to low tide the boat could not leave Dobo immediately. Near dawn the body was finally received in Ujir.

40|$|Introduction. Astasia is the {{inability}} to maintain an upright body position without assistance {{in the absence of}} motor weakness or sensory loss. <b>Abasia</b> is described as {{the inability}} to walk or as uncoordinated walking, while preserving mobility of the lower limbs. Ganser syndrome is described as a dissociative disorder characterized by approximate answers, somatic conversion symptoms, clouding of consciousness, as well as visual and auditory pseudohallucinations. The aim {{of this study is to}} present a case that seemed like a combination of neurological and internal disturbances, but actually represented a psychogenic disorder. Case Outline. This paper presents the case of a 13 -year-old patient with the first manifestation of {{the inability to}} walk and stand. Medical history, diagnostic instruments and differential diagnostic methods have been presented in detail. The clinical manifestation was initially interpreted as a neurological disorder. However, after the application of diagnostic procedures and a change in family circumstances, the patient was diagnosed with a psychogenic movement disorder, astasia-abasia, with progressive clinical presentation that included dissociative psychotic reactions (Ganser syndrome). Differential diagnosis as well as the elements of the therapeutic approach have been discussed. Conclusion. Presenting a case of psychogenic astasia-abasia in children contributes to a better understanding and differentiating between conditions with a clinical presentation of signs and symptoms dealt with by other branches of medicine...|$|E
40|$|Uner Tan Syndrome” {{consists}} of two main symptoms: quadrupedal gait and primitive cognitive abilities including language and conscious experience. To assess the central mechanisms involved in this syndrome, we performed MRI and PET scans on affected and unaffected individuals from both families. All affected individuals were also subjected to neurological examination. To assess {{the integrity of the}} peripheral and central vestibular system, Barany’s caloric test was applied to the affected individuals. Brain MRI and PET scans were performed on normal subjects (N = 7) and patients (N = 7). Right- and left-cerebral and cerebellar areas, including the vermial and callosal areas, were measured on the MRI scans using a computer cursor. Quadrupedal gait, mental retardation, dysartric speech, nystagmus, severe truncal ataxia, hyperreflexia, astasia and <b>abasia</b> were observed in the affected individuals from both families. Cerebellum and vermis were atrophic in the MRI and PET scans of the first family. In contrast, the brain MRI seemed to be normal in the MRI and PET scans of affected individuals from the second family. The caloric test revealed central vestibular damage in patients from the first family and peripheral vestibular damage in patients from the second family. The results suggest that “Uner Tan Syndrome”, discovered in two unrelated families, may be caused by peripheral or central vestibular damage resulting from different genetic defects. Cerebellar hypoplasia may not be a prerequisite for the emergence of this syndrome. Primitive mental abilities may be explained by damage within the vestibulo-cerebellar system, while the quadrupedal gait may be due to a genetic defect within the higher brain centers that suppress the atavistic brain networks controlling quadrupedal gait and helped in the emergence of the habitual bipedal gait during human evolution. This retarded development of human locomotion –devolution- may illuminate the brain mechanisms responsible for the transition from quadrupedality to bipedality in human evolution...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} done to assess the {{relation}} between serum mannose binding lectin (MBL) and disease activity and extension in patients with tuberculosis. Methods: The study included 50 pulmonary TB cases recruited from chest department at El <b>Abasia</b> and Tanta Chest Hospitals and 27 patients with other respiratory infections as a positive control group. Also 13 healthy subjects were included as a negative control group. Patients were classified as follows: 30 with active TB (group I), 20 with inactive TB (group II) and 27 with non-TB respiratory diseases as positive control group (group III). Full clinical evaluation, plain chest X-ray (postero-anterior & lateral views), routine laboratory investigations were done to all patients. MBL measurement in serum of all subjects was done by an ELISA assay. Results: No significant difference in MBL levels seen {{between males and females}} in all studied groups. MBL levels were significantly higher in group I & II than the other groups. MBL levels were non-significantly higher in active TB (group I) than inactive TB (group II) while they were significantly higher in active TB cases than in infectious respiratory diseases other than TB and non-infectious respiratory diseases. Levels were non-significantly higher in active TB cases than in controls. MBL levels were significantly higher in TB cases than in infectious respiratory diseases other than TB. 60 % of active TB group has high MBL level versus 13. 3 % of non-TB respiratory infection cases and 8. 3 % of noninfectious respiratory diseases group. Only one patient with far advanced tuberculosis showed significantly higher levels of MBL than patients with minimal and moderate disease while no significant difference seen between patients with minimal and moderately advanced diseases. Conclusion: MBL is possibly related to increased susceptibility to tuberculosis. Its levels were nearly the same in both active and inactive tuberculous patients. There is a direct relation between levels of MBL and disease extension...|$|E
40|$|Funeral in Ujir. Collective event {{engaging}} the entire village. <b>Abasia</b> Walay died in Dobo on 20130822. Her body was transported to Ujir, and received there around 03 {{in the morning}} of the 23 rd. The custom in Ujir (as a Muslim village) is to bury the dead soon after death, preferably as in this case in the morning after. In the morning of the 23 rd, women gathered inside the house of the deceased to perform the last washing of the body. The washing is made by people of the same gender as the deceased. After cleaning, the body is clad in nine meters of white cloth. The preparations could not be recorded as they are sacred. In front of the house a temporary bier was constructed. The lid was covered with textile and decorated with flowers. Senior men gathered in the front room of the house to hold prayers. The body was carried out, placed on the bier and the funeral procession set of moving swiftly, sometimes running, along the beach while singing religious chants. The lead singer was Wau Notanubun. A grave had been dug in a small burial ground with a few graves behind some garden houses. The body was placed in the grave, lying on her side, facing Mecca. After ceremonies inside the grave it was closed and then ceremonies were held at the grave. The villagers left the closest family at the grave. The bier was set to float on the sea. On a bridge over a stream by the village Wau Notanubun presents a few ladies in Ujir language. Save but one they are presented either as haja, which means that they have been on pilgrimage to Mecca or as wives to a haji, a male pilgrim. Going on pilgrimage to Mecca is a main aspiration to many villagers in Ujir. On their way home people stopped at the mourning house to get some drinks and cakes. At the end of the recording sounds are heard from the mosque as the Friday prayers are coming up. In the end haja Lela walks home, past the new mosque which is still under construction. NB. Traditions pertaining to death are further explained by the Imam in a recording from 20130828 in connection with a ritual meal held on the 7 th day after the death of <b>Abasia</b> Walay.
