50|$|For example, if a mariner {{already knows}} how to operate {{navigation}} equipment and if negative transfer occurs, {{he or she may}} display more errors while learning to operate new equipment than a mariner who has never operated navigation equipment. This is because the old mariner is using previous knowledge that may have transferred negatively and now is having to forget the prior inaccurate knowledge and try to learn new equipment the correct way. This is because the learning that was transferred can not properly apply to the new experience. Another example of this might be the way an experience of the same kind has different protocol for different situations. If a mariner has already learned how to quickly react to an alarm, the same mariner may react to the same alarm on new equipment even more quickly (positive transfer on reaction time) than without already knowing how to react. Although the reaction may happen very quickly, it may be to push the wrong <b>alarm</b> <b>switch</b> located in the same position as the old <b>alarm</b> <b>switch</b> (negative transfer on error rate). In essence, the old behavior contributes to making errors at a faster rate on the new behavior.|$|E

The lab is locked down by the automatic security system and Daryl tells Anna to flip the <b>alarm</b> <b>switch,</b> which actually ends up accidentally triggering the alarm. After escaping the lab, Daryl and Anna go to Sherwood to gather information about the evacuation. Daryl later says goodbye to Anna when she and her father find each other and drive away.|$|E
50|$|The stator casing and {{diffuser}} are rigidly supported {{from the}} turbine end bearing bracket. Low conductivity demineralised water {{is circulated through}} the stator windings by a pump and passes through coolers and a filter before entering the inlet manifold of the winding. After passing through the winding the water returns to the pump through a degassing tank. This is basically a sudden enlargement in the pipe, which causes the water velocity to decrease and so enables any bubbles of gas to be collected in a small chamber fitted with a float-operated <b>alarm</b> <b>switch.</b> A header tank, which contains enough water for a complete refill of the system, is connected into the inlet pipe to the winding. A small demineralising plant is provided to treat the water, should the conductivity of the make-up water supply be too high.|$|E

We conducted laboratory trials to determine whether yellow perch experience a comparable ontogenetic shift in their response to conspecific alarm cues. When exposed to either young-of-year (YOY) or adult perch skin extract, YOY perch responded with decreased time in motion and number of feeding attempts as well as increased time spent with spines erect and latency to first feeding attempt, all of which are indicative of an anti-predator response. Adult perch, when exposed to the same cues, responded with increased time spent moving and number of feeding attempts as well as decreased time spent with spines erect and latency to first feeding attempt, indicative of a foraging response. These data suggest that yellow perch undergo an ontogenetic niche shift in response to conspecific alarm cues...|$|R

50|$|The {{investigating}} officers, however, {{doubted that}} {{the crime was}} a burglary and suspected that the perpetrators were known to the victims; they soon began to question {{the children and the}} employees of the Richthofen family. What made them suspicious was not only the crime scene, with the <b>alarm</b> system <b>switched</b> off and the papers spread very regularly, as if by design, but also Suzane's extraordinarily cold behavior - she was seen in the house's swimming pool with Daniel the day after the murder, and celebrated her 19th birthday with friends just hours after the parents´ burial. The investigators focused their attention on Suzane and her boyfriend and began shadowing them. The clue for the arrest came with Christian Cravinhos, who had bought a motorcycle a few days later and paid cash in 100-dollar bills. A few days later, on November 9, 2002 he was arrested, as well as his brother and Suzane, who soon confessed to the murder. Suzane was released from prison in May 2005, when the Supreme Court of Justice granted her habeas corpus. She then awaited her trial under house arrest.|$|R

40|$|We propose an {{unsupervised}} learning framework to infer motion patterns in videos {{and in turn}} use them to improve tracking of moving objects in sequences from static cameras. Based on tracklets, we use a manifold learning method Tensor Voting to infer the local geometric structures in (x,y) space, and embed tracklet points into (x,y,θ) space, whereθ represents motion direction. In this space, points automatically form intrinsic manifold structures, each of which corresponds to a motion pattern. To define each group, a novel robust manifold grouping algorithm is proposed. Tensor Voting is performed to provide multiple geometric cues which formulate multiple similarity kernels between any pair of points, and a spectral clustering technique is used in this multiple kernel setting. The grouping algorithm achieves better performance than state-of-the-art methods in our applications. Extracted motion patterns can then {{be used as a}} prior to improve the performance of any object tracker.

40|$|We {{present an}} {{approach}} for online learning of discriminative appearance models for robust multi-target tracking {{in a crowded}} scene from a single camera. Although much {{progress has been made}} in developing methods for optimal data association, there has been comparatively less work on the appearance models, which are key elements for good performance. Many previous methods either use simple features such as color histograms, or focus on the discriminability between a target and the background which does not resolve ambiguities between the different targets. We propose an algorithm for learning a discriminative appearance model for different targets. Training samples are collected online from tracklets within a time sliding window based on some spatial-temporal constraints; this allows the models to adapt to target instances. Learning uses an AdaBoost algorithm that combines effective image descriptors and their corresponding similarity measurements. We term the learned models as OLDAMs. Our evaluations indicate that OLDAMs have significantly higher discrimination between different targets than conventional holistic color histograms, and when integrated into a hierarchical association framework, they help improve the tracking accuracy, particularly reducing the false <b>alarms</b> and identity <b>switches.</b> 1...|$|R
