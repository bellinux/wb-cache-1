5|$|Although they {{recorded}} <b>all</b> <b>income</b> {{that came}} through the Exchequer, not all sources of income went through that office, so the Pipe rolls are not a complete record of royal income. They did include both regular income from the royal lands and judicial profits, {{as well as more}} occasional income derived from feudal levies, wardships, and ecclesiastical vacancies. Another source of income recorded in the rolls was from feudal reliefs, the payment made by an heir when inheriting an estate. A major source of income in the roll of 1130 is from the forests, under the Forest Law, which was the royal law covering the restrictions imposed on non-royals hunting in areas of the country declared royal forest. However, royal income from taxation that was not annually assessed was not usually recorded in the Pipe rolls, nor were his receipts from lands outside England. Some payments went directly to the king's household, and because they did not pass through the Exchequer, they were not recorded in the Pipe rolls.|$|E

25|$|The {{negative}} aspects of inequality are spread across the population.

25|$|At the March 2005 AFL-CIO {{executive}} council meeting, however, {{no consensus on}} reform emerged.

25|$|One type of {{flat tax}} would {{be imposed on}} <b>all</b> <b>income</b> once; at {{the source of the}} income.

30|$|The output-oriented radial DEA {{models are}} {{constructed}} {{in such a}} way that the existing ratio of the average income of the three population classes remains constant, because they attempt to increase the income proportionately. Accordingly, the objective function of (1) indicates the factor by which <b>all</b> <b>incomes</b> can be uniformly increased until the boundary of the data envelopment is reached; or the factor by which they can be reduced in the case of super-efficiency without compromising the efficiency of a country. Thus, for example, Belgium should increase <b>all</b> <b>incomes</b> to 100 / 62 [*]=[*] 161 % under constant RTS and to 100 / 72 [*]=[*] 139 % under variable RTS (see columns 2 and 3 of Table  8).|$|R

In order {{to compensate for the}} initial 28% taxation, only 72% of the distributed profit will be taxable. Furthermore, only the distributed profit exceeding a risk-free interest on the capital invested in the partnership will be taxable. The maximum marginal tax rate of distributed income will be 48.16 percent (0.28+0.72*0.28).|$|E
