5|$|Mulder and Scully get wind of {{this bizarre}} car chase as they're doing work in Buhl, Idaho {{investigating}} possible domestic terrorism. Mulder coerces Scully into taking a detour to Elko, Nevada on <b>a</b> <b>hunch</b> {{that this may}} be an X-File. Crump, who has started to develop symptoms of a sickness, is put in an ambulance. Mulder, wishing to speak to Crump, follows the ambulance, and ends up being kidnapped by Crump, who has escaped from the police.|$|E
5|$|Melvin Frohike visits Scully's {{apartment}} and shows her {{a newspaper article}} about Kenneth Soona's murder. When she returns to FBI headquarters, the metal detector curiously goes off. Scully presents Skinner with the newspaper article, thinking that the data from Soona's death can clear Mulder in his father's murder. Skinner, however, refuses to do any follow-up on it. After Scully leaves it is revealed that the Cigarette Smoking Man was waiting in an adjacent room to question Skinner about the exchange. Leaving the building, Scully has <b>a</b> <b>hunch</b> upon seeing the metal detector again that leads to locating metal {{in the back of}} her neck. Scully sees a doctor, who removes a small metal implant.|$|E
5|$|Angel {{finds that}} he cannot {{stop talking about}} his divorce when trying to meet new women at a bar. After he meets a woman {{recovering}} from her own divorce, he has to leave her {{to speak to a}} prostitute whom he sees across the room with a prosthetic hand and fingernails painted {{in the same way as}} the Ice Truck Killer's first victim. Working on <b>a</b> <b>hunch</b> that the Ice Truck Killer is an acrotomophiliac, Angel decides to speak to Debra's boyfriend, Rudy Cooper, a prosthetics specialist and (unbeknownst to anyone else) the actual Ice Truck Killer. Rudy cooperates with the interview upon realizing that Angel does not know his identity. Later, Angel is stabbed in a parking lot by a masked man. Angel manages to elbow him in the face before two men scare the attacker off. Minutes later, Rudy - who had earlier fallen out with Debra due to secretly having dinner with Dexter - arrives with flowers. They kiss, but Rudy backs away complaining of a cut lip, suggesting that he was Angel's attacker.|$|E

5000|$|Reasonable {{suspicion}} requires less evidence than [...] "Probable Cause", {{but more}} than <b>a</b> mere <b>hunch.</b> <b>A</b> {{rule of thumb is}} that reasonable suspicion requires 25% proof, and probable cause requires more than 50% statistical chance. Therefore, if there is probable cause for arrest for DUI/DWIOWI, as suggested by the research and examples used above, then there is reasonable suspicion to stop a driver.|$|R

25|$|Having {{received}} the secret message, Artemis decides {{the only option}} is to break into Koboi Laboratories and return all weapon control to the LEP, interrupting the rescue mission. Root bitterly acknowledges the only fairy who ever succeeded in doing so was the kleptomaniac dwarf Mulch Diggums, who {{had worked as a}} builder of the facility, but was presumed dead following his break-in to Fowl Manor. Holly then reveals that Foaly had <b>a</b> <b>hunch</b> that Mulch had survived by placing the iris cam that scanned his vitals into local wildlife. Foaly realized that some of the gold returned by Artemis to the fairies was missing, and then traced several bars to Los Angeles, where Mulch was living as diminutive millionaire and legendary Oscar thief. The group then head to Los Angeles and apprehend Mulch once again.|$|E
500|$|Within {{a week of}} Tony Blair {{moving to}} 10 Downing Street after the May 1997 general election, press reports of a rift between Humphrey and Cherie Blair, the new Prime Minister's wife, emerged. Mrs Blair was {{reported}} to either be allergic to cats or to believe them to be unhygienic. Sheila Gunn, who {{had gone on to}} be John Major's press advisor, later admitted that she was the source of these reports which her obituary says were based [...] "on <b>a</b> <b>hunch</b> for which she had no evidence".|$|E
500|$|Mulder later tells Scully that he {{does not}} believe Modell is on another killing spree, and, after an odd {{interview}} with Linda, believes she is the killer and has the same powers as Modell. Skinner suspends Mulder, but Mulder vows to prove his theory right. He talks with Modell's therapist again, who mentions that a nun from the Little Sisters of Charity had called him a [...] "conquered warrior". On <b>a</b> <b>hunch,</b> Mulder tries to show her a picture of Linda. The phone rings and, after stating she is with Mulder, she sticks her hand into a fuse box and is fatally electrocuted.|$|E

500|$|Polydore Vergil and Thomas More {{expanded}} on this portrayal, emphasising Richard's outward physical deformities {{as a sign}} of his inwardly twisted mind. More describes him as [...] "little of stature, ill-featured of limbs, crook-backed... hard-favoured of visage". Vergil {{also says}} he was [...] "deformed of body... one shoulder higher than the right". Both emphasise that Richard was devious and flattering, while planning the downfall of both his enemies and supposed friends. Richard's good qualities were his cleverness and bravery. All these characteristics are repeated by Shakespeare, who portrays him as having <b>a</b> <b>hunch,</b> a limp and a withered arm.|$|E
500|$|New Line Cinema bought Jeffrey's {{treatment}} and {{hired him to}} write the original draft of the script, which featured Death as an unseen force. [...] After the script was finished, New Line Cinema submitted the script to directors, including writing partners James Wong and Glen Morgan. Both writers were willing {{to make it into}} a film, although they rewrote the script to comply with their standards. [...] "I believe that {{at one time or another}} we've all experienced a sense of prescience. [...] We have <b>a</b> <b>hunch,</b> a feeling, and then that hunch proves true," [...] Wong said. [...] "We want to do for planes and air travel what Jaws did for sharks and swimming".|$|E
500|$|... "Seeing Red" [...] is {{the tenth}} {{episode of the}} first season of the American {{television}} drama series Dexter, which first aired on December 3, 2006 on Showtime in the United States. The episode was written by Kevin R. Maynard and was directed by Michael Cuesta. In the episode, the Miami Metro Homicide Department team investigate a blood-soaked crime scene, where blood spatter analyst Dexter Morgan (Michael C. Hall) is confronted by a repressed memory of a traumatic incident from his childhood. Meanwhile, Dexter's girlfriend Rita Bennett (Julie Benz) is charged with assaulting her ex-husband Paul Bennett (Mark Pellegrino) and risks losing custody of their children, while Det. Angel Batista (David Zayas) investigates <b>a</b> <b>hunch</b> that the Ice Truck Killer has an amputee fetish.|$|E

500|$|Equipment at Inmarsat's Perth {{ground station}} had been {{upgraded}} in 2013 with additional storage capacity and new software to record an expanded data set for transmissions, including {{the addition of}} Burst Frequency Offset (BFO) and Burst Timing Offset (BTO) values. Without {{the addition of the}} BFO and BTO values, {{it would not have been}} possible to determine the aircraft's distance from the satellite at each handshake and hence significantly narrow the search region. The expanded data values were prompted by Inmarsat's involvement in the search for Air France Flight447, which disappeared over the Atlantic Ocean in 2009. The company felt the additional data values could be useful in future incidents. According to Inmarsat's vice-president of satellite operations, Mark Dickinson, the company [...] "did not know precisely how [...] might be useful but [...] had <b>a</b> <b>hunch</b> and decided to [...]" ...|$|E
500|$|The Americans and the British launch Operation Thunderball to foil SPECTRE {{and recover}} the two atomic bombs. On <b>a</b> <b>hunch,</b> M assigns Bond to the Bahamas to investigate. There, Bond meets Felix Leiter, {{seconded}} to the CIA from his usual role at Pinkertons {{because of the}} Thunderball crisis. While in Nassau, Bond meets Dominetta [...] "Domino" [...] Vitali, Largo's mistress and the sister of the dead pilot Giuseppe Petacchi. She is living on board the Disco Volante and believes Largo is on a treasure hunt, although Largo makes her stay ashore while he and his partners hunt hidden treasure. After seducing her, Bond informs her that Largo killed her brother; Bond then recruits her to spy on Largo. Domino re-boards the Disco Volante with a Geiger counter to ascertain if the yacht is where the two nuclear bombs are hidden. However, she is discovered and Largo tortures her for information.|$|E
500|$|In Neuromancer, Gibson {{first used}} the term [...] "" [...] {{to refer to the}} visualized Internet, two years after the nascent Internet was formed in the early 1980s from the {{computer}} networks of the 1970s. Gibson thereby imagined a worldwide communications network years before the origin of the World Wide Web, although related notions had previously been imagined by others, including science fiction writers. At the time he wrote [...] "Burning Chrome", Gibson [...] "had <b>a</b> <b>hunch</b> that [...] would change things, {{in the same way that}} the ubiquity of the automobile changed things." [...] In 1995, he identified the advent, evolution and growth of the Internet as [...] "one of the most fascinating and unprecedented human achievements of the century", a new kind of civilization that is– in terms of significance — on a par with the birth of cities, and in 2000 predicted it would lead to the death of the nation state.|$|E
50|$|Ned Glass (April 1, 1906 - June 15, 1984) was a Polish-born American {{character}} actor {{who appeared in}} more than eighty films and on television {{more than one hundred}} times, frequently playing nervous, cowardly, or deceitful characters. Short and bald, with <b>a</b> slight <b>hunch</b> to his shoulders, he was immediately recognizable by his distinct appearance, his nasal voice, and his pronounced New York City accent.|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Pett started. She {{remembered that}} she had used almost that very {{expression}} to Ann. Her suspicions, which had been lulled by the prompt recognition of the visitor by Skinner and Lord Wisbeach, returned. It {{is one of the}} effects of <b>a</b> successful <b>hunch</b> that it breeds other hunches. She had been right about Jerry Mitchell; was she to be proved right about the self-styled Jimmy Crocker? ...|$|R
60|$|As I came {{nearer to}} him I {{could see that}} he was a stranger, and from his dusty clothes and {{dilapidated}} appearance he seemed to have come from a distance. He had <b>a</b> great <b>hunch</b> of bread on his knee and a clasp-knife in his hand, but he had apparently just finished his breakfast, for he brushed the crumbs off his lap and rose to his feet when he perceived me.|$|R
500|$|Though Townsend {{was proud}} {{of what he had}} {{accomplished}} so early in his career, he was discouraged by his experience with the music industry. [...] "I was becoming a product of somebody else's imagination, and it was mixing with my own personality," [...] he later reflected. [...] "This combination was appalling." [...] He pushed to get his own projects off the ground. Despite getting notable touring gigs with other musicians, however, Townsend continued to face rejection of his own music. Relativity Records dropped Noisescapes from their label shortly after Townsend accepted Vai's offer, seeing no commercial appeal in Townsend's music. [...] "I have <b>a</b> <b>hunch</b> they only offered me a deal to get me to sing with Steve," [...] he mused. While touring with the Wildhearts, Townsend {{received a phone call from}} an A representative for Roadrunner Records, expressing an interest in his demos and an intention to sign him. The offer was ultimately rescinded by the head of Roadrunner, who regarded Townsend's recordings as [...] "just noise".|$|E
500|$|The {{crew of the}} Enterprise {{responds}} to messages received from the SS Tsiolkovsky, a science vessel monitoring {{the collapse of a}} supergiant star. The messages suggest, amid their rounds of laughter, that the crew has been exposed to a sudden hull breach. After the Enterprise secures the Tsiolkovsky via tractor beam, an away team beams over and finds the crew frozen to death in various stages of undress—including one who was taking a shower fully clothed. A woman's body, frozen, falls into Lt. La Forge's (LeVar Burton) hands. Dr. Crusher (Gates McFadden) orders full medical examinations of the away team on their return, and finds La Forge sweating profusely and complaining about the temperature. She orders him to stay in sickbay but he manages to escape, making his way to the quarters of Crusher's son, Wesley (Wil Wheaton). Unaware of La Forge's condition, Wesley shows him a portable tractor beam device and La Forge places an encouraging hand on his shoulder. Meanwhile, acting on <b>a</b> <b>hunch</b> by Commander Riker (Jonathan Frakes), who had read a book on past starships named [...] "Enterprise" [...] and found a previous mention of someone taking a shower fully clothed in its pages, Lt. Cdr. Data (Brent Spiner) locates a historical record identifying the ailment as similar to one encountered by Captain Kirk's USS Enterprise. La Forge returns to sickbay, where Dr. Crusher quickly becomes concerned when she realizes that the infection is spread by physical contact. Much of the ship's crew comes {{under the influence of the}} ailment, including Data, who engages in a sexual encounter with Security Chief Tasha Yar (Denise Crosby). Dr. Crusher, struggling against the effects of the ailment, finds the original antidote documented by Kirk's Enterprise to be ineffective, and begins devising a new version of it.|$|E

2500|$|Excitedly, two of {{the young}} {{visitors}} sign up and are soon admitted as permanent members. Castle, though, has fostered <b>a</b> growing <b>hunch</b> that Frazier is somehow presenting a sham society or is in fact, secretly, a dictator. Defending the virtues of democracy, Castle finally confronts Frazier directly, accusing him of despotism, though he has no definitive proof. Frazier rebuts, on the contrary, that the vision for Walden Two is as a place safe from all forms of despotism, even the [...] "despotism of democracy".|$|R
30|$|Our study {{starts with}} <b>a</b> simple <b>hunch</b> that the mixed {{empirical}} {{evidence for the}} linkage of political decentralization and innovation {{might be due to}} the influence of non-institutional aspects of decentralization such as cultural attributes. In other words, not only political decentralization but cultural decentralization may matter for technological innovation, as creativity, ingenuity, or originality underpinning innovative activities would prosper more in culturally less authoritarian environments. Even in politically decentralized countries, individuals may experience a culturally stifling atmosphere that discourages them from venturing with novel ideas.|$|R

2500|$|Louis St-Laurent (...) {{was born}} on 1 February 1882 in Compton, Quebec, a village in the Eastern Townships to Jean-Baptiste-Moïse Saint-Laurent, a French-Canadian, and Mary Anne Broderick, an Irish-Canadian. He grew up fluently bilingual. His English had a {{noticeable}} Irish brogue, while his gestures (such as <b>a</b> <b>hunch</b> of the shoulders) were French.|$|E
2500|$|Aderca was {{similarly}} troubled by philosemitism. He believed that positive discrimination was counterproductive, and favored race blindness: [...] "When [...] secretly confesses philosemitism, {{all of a}} sudden I have <b>a</b> <b>hunch.</b> I would prefer to know he is indifferent." [...] Looking back on Romanian antisemitism, Aderca sided with other Jewish thinkers who looked favorably on ethno-nationalists such as Mihai Eminescu. He argued that Eminescu's work was not particularly antisemitic, and evidenced those traits which gave it universal appeal.|$|E

50|$|Frieza's third form {{is again}} more brutish, with an {{extremely}} elongated skull (like an Alien). His facial features contort and change, with his nose melding {{into his mouth}} to form a crude beak. His original horns recede and are now white in color, erupting in pairs {{along the length of}} his head. His tail tip, which had been cut off by Kuririn, did not regenerate and he now has <b>a</b> slight <b>hunch.</b> Although his tail was surprisingly not regenerated, the rest of his wounds disappeared as if nothing ever touched him.|$|R
30|$|Additionally, as Norberg (2017) points out, blended {{learning}} is not new. The modality dates back, at least, to the medieval {{period when the}} technology of textbooks was introduced into the classroom where, traditionally, the professor read to the students from the only existing manuscript. Certainly, like modern technologies, books were disruptive because they altered {{the teaching and learning}} paradigm. Blended learning might be considered what Johnson describes as <b>a</b> slow <b>hunch</b> (2010). That is, an idea that evolved {{over a long period of}} time, achieving what Kaufmann (2000) describes as the adjacent possible – a realistic next step occurring in many iterations.|$|R
