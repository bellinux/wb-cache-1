5|$|The service {{designation}} MiG-5 {{was reserved}} for the production version of this aircraft, as demonstrated in the NKAP order of 2 October 1941, which instructed Zavod No. 1 to begin manufacture of the MiG-5 {{after the completion of}} its State <b>acceptance</b> <b>tests.</b> Other known designations for the aircraft include the DIS-200 and Idzeliye 71, its factory designation. The bomber version, if it had entered production, might have been known as the MiG-2.|$|E
5|$|Despite these {{production}} {{problems and}} the fact that the I-250 had yet even to be submitted for State acceptance trails, an order had been placed for fifty more aircraft on 26 February (these aircraft have been referred to as the MiG-13, which presumably would have been their designation if they had actually entered service). A new deadline of 5 July 1946 was set for the delivery of the first pre-production aircraft, but it was stymied, again, for a lack of an engine. By this time seven airframes had been completed, but all lacked engines. The first I-250 was finally accepted on 8 August and flown for the first time three days later, although its engine seals failed and a number of ignition cables were scorched. The engine replacement and repairs forced the aircraft to miss its scheduled appearance at the Tushino Air Display. It was handed over to the NII VVS (Air Force Institute) on 15 September to finally begin its State <b>acceptance</b> <b>tests.</b> All ten aircraft had been delivered by 30 October, although construction number 3810107 (Factory No. 381, first batch, seventh aircraft) was used as a static test airframe and 3810110 became a static engine testbed.|$|E
5|$|The {{aircraft}} {{was given the}} service designation of MiG-9 (internal OKB designations of I-301 and izdeliye FS) and a small batch of ten aircraft, equipped with original German engines, was ordered during 1946 from Factory No. 1 in Kazan before flight testing was completed. They were intended {{to be used in}} the parade, but bad weather forced the cancellation of their flypast. Two of them were assigned to participate in the state acceptance trials while others were used as testbeds for various programs. The trials were concluded in June and the MiG-9 generally met the performance goals set by the Council of People's Commissars. The test pilots found the fighter easy and simple to fly. Defects noted during testing were that the engines flamed out when firing the cannon at high altitudes due to gun gas ingestion, no ejection seat was fitted, nor were air brakes or a fire suppression system. The fuel tanks were not self-sealing and no armor was provided for the pilot. Despite these drawbacks, the MiG-9 was ordered into production at Factory No. 1 before the <b>acceptance</b> <b>tests</b> were completed as the Soviet leadership believed that its shortcomings could be rectified during production. A batch of 50 aircraft, 40 single-seat fighters and 10 two-seat trainers, were ordered in late 1946 to participate in the 1947 May Day parade. In recognition of their accomplishment Artem Mikoyan and Mikhail Gurevich were awarded the Stalin Prize in 1947.|$|E

Soon thereafter, he was named as engineering liaison officer on both the B-24 and B-32 programs.

25|$|The {{progenitor}} for the ASh-73 was the M-70. It {{was tested}} in late 1938 {{and was a}} failure because of cracks in the master connecting rod and the geared centrifugal supercharger's impeller. The exhaust valves also burnt through. The M-71 of 1939 was the successor to the M-70 and it too was not a success. It used some components from the M-62 engine, but its development was slowed by the German attack on the Soviet Union in 1941. It passed its State <b>acceptance</b> <b>tests</b> {{in the autumn of}} 1942, but was not placed into production as there was not any production capacity available, although it was tested on a number of different prototypes during the war. The M-72 of early 1945 was a boosted version of the M-71 and was superseded by the ASh-73 before production could get underway.|$|E

25|$|In late October 1967, Scorpion started {{refresher}} training and weapons system <b>acceptance</b> <b>tests,</b> {{and was given}} a new commanding officer, Francis Slattery. Following type training out of Norfolk, Virginia, she got underway on 15 February 1968 for a Mediterranean Sea deployment. She operated with the 6th Fleet into May and then headed west for home. Scorpion suffered several mechanical malfunctions, including a chronic problem with Freon leakage from refrigeration systems. An electrical fire occurred in an escape trunk when a water leak shorted out a shore power connection. (However, major steam and leakage problems are not uncommon on U.S. Navy or Royal Navy submarine deployments, even in the 21st Century.) There {{is no evidence that}} the Scorpions speed was restricted in May 1968, although it was conservatively observing a depth limitation of 500 feet, due to the incomplete implementation of planned post-Thresher safety checks and modifications.|$|E
25|$|The flight school {{moved in}} November 1911 to a farm leased near Augusta, Georgia, hoping to {{continue}} flying {{there during the}} winter. Training was limited by rain and flooding, and they returned to Maryland in May 1912. Arnold began to develop a phobia about flying, intensified by Al Welsh's fatal crash at College Park on June 11. In August Arnold was at Marblehead, Massachusetts, with 1st Lt. Roy C. Kirtland conducting <b>acceptance</b> <b>tests</b> of the Burgess Model H, an enclosed-fuselage tandem-seat seaplane and the Army's first tractor (front-mounted propeller and engine). The pair received orders to fly the new aircraft to Bridgeport, Connecticut to participate in maneuvers but high winds forced them to land on Massachusetts Bay on August 12. Attempting to take off again, Arnold caught a wing tip in the water turning into the wind and crashed into the bay off Plymouth. Arnold suffered a lacerated chin during the mishap but the aircraft was salvaged and repaired. Another crash at College Park on September 18 killed 2nd Lt. Lewis Rockwell, an academy classmate of Arnold's.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—During <b>acceptance</b> <b>testing</b> {{customers}} {{assess whether}} a system meets their expectations and often identify issues {{that should be}} improved. These findings have to be communicated to the developers – a task we observed to be error prone, especially in distributed teams. Here, it is normally not possible to have developer representatives from every site attend the test. Developers who were not present might misunderstand insufficiently documented findings. This hinders fixing the issues and endangers customer satisfaction. Integrated feedback systems promise to mitigate this problem. They allow to easily capture findings and their context. Correctly applied, this technique could improve feedback, while reducing customer effort. This paper collects our experiences from comparing <b>acceptance</b> <b>testing</b> with and without feedback systems in a distributed project.

500|$|Based on {{the glowing}} {{report by the}} NII VVS (Nauchno-Issledovatel'skiy Institut Voyenno-Vozdushnykh Sil—Air Force Scientific Test Institute) in early 1942 {{preparations}} began to put the I-185 (M-71) into production. A 'production standard setter (etalon)' aircraft was built in April 1942 with a redesigned engine cowling. Its gross weight increased by [...] over the earlier prototypes, but the reduction in drag from the new cowling was significant and the top speed increased to [...] at 5000 meters. It underwent manufacturer's tests between June and October and was submitted for the State <b>acceptance</b> <b>tests</b> on 18 November. However, flight testing was interrupted {{by the need to}} replace the engine between 17 December 1942 and 26 January 1943. The new engine failed the next day and the aircraft crashed on 27 January. Flight tests were ordered to be continued with the original prototypes to validate the range figures, but the first prototype crashed on 5 April, killing the pilot as he attempted a dead-stick landing.|$|E
500|$|Another {{prototype}} {{equipped with}} RD-21 engines and a pressurized cockpit {{was completed in}} June 1947. It was known internally as the I-307 (izdeliye FR) and was given the service designation of MiG-9M. The armament was rearranged in another attempt to ameliorate the gun gas ingestion problem with the N-37 being mounted on the starboard side of the fuselage and the two NS-23s on the port side, well aft so that the gun barrels did not protrude beyond the air intake. This caused the cockpit to be moved forward slightly which gave the pilot a better view when landing. The number of fuel tanks was reduced to five, but the aircraft's total capacity remained the same. It made its first flight in July, but the factory flight tests were not completed until early 1948. Despite {{a top speed of}} [...] at , it failed its state <b>acceptance</b> <b>tests.</b> The reasons given were that the engines continued to flame out if they were run at low rpm at altitudes above , the mounts for the cannon were not fully developed and the workmanship of the pressurized cockpit was low. The real reason was that the aircraft was inferior to the MiG-15 already in flight testing.|$|E
500|$|Many {{of these}} changes were made to {{aircraft}} before Pe-3bis production resumed in April 1942 and combat-use revealed several additional problems {{that had to be}} addressed in a second Pe-3bis prototype, which began its State <b>acceptance</b> <b>tests</b> in May 1942. Reloading the nose guns proved to be time-consuming, taking up to 45minutes, and the night-firing of the port-side UBK continued to blind the pilot. These problems prompted the transfer of both UBK guns to the wing center section where they were installed in a compartment that was hinged at the front to drop down and allow easier access to the guns and their ammunition. The starboard gun was given 230rounds and the port gun had 265rounds. This change reduced the capacity of the Nr. 7fuel tank by , but an asbestos bulkhead was added to protect the tank from heat generated by the guns. The changes meant that the cartridge cases from the ShVAK cannon could not be collected, making the skin and lower fuselage vulnerable. These were reinforced with steel sheets to minimize the damage inflicted by the large-caliber cases. The original mounting for the dorsal UBT machine gun provided an excellent field of fire, but lack of aerodynamic balance prevented the gunner/navigator to use its full range. Pressure exerted by the airstream prevented the gunner from traversing more than about 40–50° from the centerline. A twin-petal compensator proved mostly ineffective. The crash pylon was removed to give the gunner more working space. The ammunition box of the UBT was too small, only 30rounds, and took about a minute to reload. The boxes were deleted and the UBT was given a 200-round belt with an electric drive to help to prevent feed problems. An anti-icing system was added for the propellers and the pilot's windscreen. The nose glazing was replaced entirely and the crew's armor was increased to a total weight of [...] These changes moved the aircraft's center of gravity forward and the landing gear struts were lengthened, moving the wheels [...] forward, which helped to reduce the chance of the aircraft tipping over.|$|E
