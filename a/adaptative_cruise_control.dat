40|$|International audienceResearch in <b>adaptative</b> <b>cruise</b> <b>control</b> (ACC) is {{currently}} {{one of the}} most important topics in the field of intelligent transportation systems. The main challenge is to perceive the environment, especialy at low speed. In this paper, we present a novel approach to track the 3 -D trajectory and speed of the obstacles and the surrounding vehicles through a stereo-vision system. This tracking method extends the classical patch-based Lucas-Kanade algorithm [9], [1] by integrating the geometric constraints of the stereo system into the motion model: the epipolar constraint, which enforces the tracked patches to remain on the epipolar lines, and the magnification constraint, which links the disparity of the tracked patches to the apparent size of these patches. We report experimental results on simulated and real data showing the improvement in accuracy and robustness of our algorithm compared to the classical Lucas-Kanade tracker...|$|E

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{assisting}} {{driver in the}} task of longitudinal vehicle control is known as <b>cruise</b> <b>control.</b> Starting from the <b>cruise</b> <b>control</b> devices of the seventies and eighties, now the technology has reached cooperative adaptive <b>cruise</b> <b>control.</b> This paper will address the basic concept of adaptive <b>cruise</b> <b>control</b> and the requirement to realize its improved versions including stop and go adaptive <b>cruise</b> <b>control</b> and cooperative adaptive <b>cruise</b> <b>control.</b> The conventional <b>cruise</b> <b>control</b> was only capable of maintaining a set speed by accelerating or decelerating the vehicle. Adaptive <b>cruise</b> <b>control</b> devices are capable of assisting the driver to keep a safe distance from the preceding vehicle by controlling the engine throttle and brake according to the sensor data about the vehicle. Most of the systems use RADAR as the sensor, a few uses LIDAR also. Controller includes the digital signal processing modules and microcontroller chips specially designed for actuating throttle and brake. The stop and go <b>cruise</b> <b>control</b> is for the slow and congested traffic of the cities where the traffic may be frequently stopped. Co-operative Adaptive <b>Cruise</b> <b>Controls</b> are not yet released but postulations are already there...|$|R

30|$|Among {{existing}} studies, most of {{the existing}} rule-based adaptive <b>cruise</b> <b>control</b> strategies are derived based on the human driver models, such as Intelligent Driver Model [15], Full Velocity Difference Model [32] and Optimal Velocity Model [33]. These adaptive <b>cruise</b> <b>control</b> strategies may inherit the limitation of the human driver models, such as instability [16, 34] and unrealistic behavior [13, 15, 33]. In this paper, we propose a rule-based adaptive <b>cruise</b> <b>control</b> to improve the stability and behavior of Intelligent Driver Model [15]. The stabilization effect of the proposed adaptive <b>cruise</b> <b>control</b> on traffic flow is discussed theoretically. Moreover, in order to estimate {{the performance of the}} proposed ACC, the stabilization effect of the proposed adaptive <b>cruise</b> <b>control</b> is compared with existing models.|$|R

40|$|In this {{literature}} survey little evidence is found of studies primarily investigating the road safety effects of <b>cruise</b> <b>control.</b> Those effects which were examined (mainly through practical tests {{with and without}} <b>cruise</b> <b>control)</b> showed {{that in addition to}} positive effects governing individual fuel consumption, <b>cruise</b> <b>control</b> was also likely to cause positive road safety effects. This was linked to the fact that: (1) drivers would have fewer tasks to perform; (2) they would be driving at lower average speeds; and (3) that the traffic flow would be more `stable'. On theoretical grounds, these studies anticipate a significant road safety effect following the general introduction of <b>cruise</b> <b>control</b> on motorways in the form of <b>cruise</b> <b>control</b> on motorways {{in the form of a}} 50 per cent reduction in the number of fatal accidents involving passenger cars. This dramatic effect is linked to the calculation that the widespread introduction of <b>cruise</b> <b>control</b> would slightly reduce average speeds and significantly reduce the distribution of speeds on these road types. This would result in fewer changes of lane, less overtaking and less braking, all of which would cause fewer accidents. One possible specific application of <b>cruise</b> <b>control</b> is in cars towing caravans, for which comfort and road safety are important factors...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we explore {{learning}} based predictive <b>cruise</b> <b>control</b> {{and the impact of}} this technology on increasing fuel efficiency for commercial trucks. Traditional <b>cruise</b> <b>control</b> is wasteful when maintaining a constant velocity over rolling hills. Predictive <b>cruise</b> <b>control</b> is able to look ahead at future road conditions and solve for a cost effective course of action. Model based controllers have been implemented in this field but cannot accommodate the many complexities of a dynamic environment which includes changing road and vehicle conditions. In this work, we focus on incorporating a learner into an already successful model based predictive cruise controller in order to improve its performance. We explore back propagating neural networks to predict future errors then take actions to prevent said errors from occurring. The results show that this approach improves the model based predictive <b>cruise</b> <b>control</b> by up to 60 % under certain conditions. In addition, we explore the benefits of classifier ensembles to further improve the gains due to intelligent <b>cruise</b> <b>control.</b> ...|$|R

The proposed FRACC responds to a velocityerror using a sigmoidal function of forward spacing. Mathematical properties of the controller, in particular string stability, are examined. Simulation experiments demonstrate that the controller yields smooth and safe responses in typical highway scenarios, including hard-braking and cut-in scenarios.

40|$|<b>Cruise</b> <b>control</b> {{in motor}} {{vehicles}} enhances safe and efficient driving by maintaining a constant speed at a preset level. Adaptive <b>Cruise</b> <b>Control</b> (ACC) {{is the latest}} development in <b>cruise</b> <b>control.</b> It controls engine throttle position and braking to maintain a safe distance behind a vehicle in front by responding to the speed of this vehicle, thus providing a safer and more relaxing driving environment. ACC can be further developed by including the look-ahead method of predicting environmental factors such as wind speed and road slope. The conventional analytical control methods for adaptive <b>cruise</b> <b>control</b> can generate good results; however they are difficult to design and computationally expensive. In order to achieve a robust, less computationally expensive, {{and at the same}} time more natural human-like speed control, intelligent control techniques can be used. This paper presents an Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) based on ACC systems that reduces the energy consumption of the vehicle and improves its efficiency. The Adaptive <b>Cruise</b> <b>Control</b> Look-Ahead (ACC-LA) system works as follows: It calculates the energy consumption of the vehicle under combined dynamic loads like wind drag, slope, kinetic energy and rolling friction using road data, and it includes a look-ahead strategy to predict the future road slope. The <b>cruise</b> <b>control</b> system adaptively controls the vehicle speed based on the preset speed and the predicted future slope information. By using the ANFIS method, the ACC-LA is made adaptive under different road conditions (slope angle and wind direction and speed). The vehicle was tested using the adaptive <b>cruise</b> <b>control</b> look-ahead energy management system, the results compared with the vehicle running the same test but without the adaptive <b>cruise</b> <b>control</b> look-ahead energy management system. The evaluation outcome indicates that the vehicle speed was efficiently controlled through the look-ahead methodology based upon the driving cycle, and that the average fuel consumption was reduced by 3 %. <br /...|$|R
