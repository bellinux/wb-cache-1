5|$|I am {{excited to}} give my Australian fans the World Premiere of 'Love On Top'! Thank you for the amazing {{response}} to the song at radio. I have worked very hard on this video, this song is special to me and I had an idea for the video based on {{some of my favorite}} male groups. I remember seeing videos from New Edition, The Jackson 5 and the Temptations, bands I love for their beautiful harmonies, and precise choreography and I always wanted to make a video and be part of a boy group myself. It was so much fun. I put my heart and soul into 'Love On Top' <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> you love it.|$|E
5|$|I'll be {{offering}} my vision when my campaign begins. And {{it will be}} comprehensive and sweeping. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> {{that it will be}} compelling enough to draw people toward it. I feel that it will be. But it will emerge from my dialogue with the American people. I've traveled to every part of this country during the last six years. During my service in the United States Congress, I took the initiative in creating the Internet. I took the initiative in moving forward a whole range of initiatives that have proven to be important to our country's economic growth and environmental protection, improvements in our educational system.|$|E
25|$|When Fisher (First Sea Lord) and Churchill (First Lord of the Admiralty) {{both had}} to leave office (May 1915) after their quarrel over the Dardanelles, Jellicoe wrote to Fisher: “We owe you a debt of {{gratitude}} for having saved the Navy from a continuance in office of Mr Churchill, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> that never again will any politician be allowed to usurp the functions that he took upon himself to exercise”.|$|E
60|$|What could I say to all this? Really nothing; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>hoped</b> {{he would}} allow me to be silent. The storm recommenced.|$|R
5000|$|Michaels left The Doctors in January 2012 {{after half}} a season, because, she claimed, the {{arrangement}} [...] "wasn't the fit both the show <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>hoped</b> for".|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps it was wrong, but I {{tried to}} do right. I wasn't sure, no one said anything, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>I</b> was mistaken. It would have been selfish to frighten you all when Marmee was so anxious about Meg, and Amy away, and you so happy with Laurie--at least I thought so then." ...|$|R
25|$|The Puritans {{though they}} differ in Ceremonies and accidentes, yet {{they agree with}} us in {{substance}} of religion, and I thinke all or the moste parte of them love his Majestie, and the presente state, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> will yield to conformitie. But the Papistes are opposite and contrarie in very many substantiall pointes of religion, and cannot but wishe the Popes authoritie and popish religion to be established.|$|E

25|$|I {{composed}} the fugue first and {{wrote it down}} while I was thinking out the prelude. I only {{hope that you will}} be able to read it, for it is written so very small; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> further that you will like it. Another time I shall send you something better for the clavier. My dear Constanze is really the cause of this fugue's coming into the world. Baron van Swieten, to whom I go every Sunday, gave me all the works of Händel and Sebastian Bach to take home with me (after I had played them to him). When Constanze heard the fugues, she absolutely fell in love with them. Now she will listen to nothing but fugues, and particularly (in this kind of composition) the works of Händel and Bach. Well, as she has often heard me play fugues out of my head, she asked me if I had ever written any down, and when I said I had not, she scolded me roundly for not recording some of my compositions in this most artistically beautiful of all musical forms and never ceased to entreat me until I wrote down a fugue for her.|$|E
6000|$|... "Forgive me!" [...] she cried, {{looking up}} at him with real respect in her face, and real remorse smiting her conscience. [...] "Forgive me! I have misled you <b>and</b> myself. <b>I</b> tried to love you: I was {{grateful}} for your regard, touched by your fidelity, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>I</b> might repay it; but I cannot! I cannot!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... “It {{would have}} been {{impossible}} to get the catamaran anywhere but on to the shore, where the soldiers stood shooting, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>hoped</b> that by daylight we might be recognised and saved.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then I {{beg your}} pardon, mother. I {{certainly}} wasn't {{thinking of her}} alone. But she is proud, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>hoped</b> you would let her feel that we realize all that she is doing." ...|$|R
25|$|I find it {{very hard}} to say this truth. I am to blame for {{everything}} I did at that time. I am trying to erase all this and to be what I was not at that time. I am also to blame for what I did not do, for not trying to protect those prisoners. Regardless of the temporary nature of my then-post. I ask myself again and again, what could I have done that I didn't do? Thousands of innocent victims perished. Graves remain behind, refugees, destruction and misfortune and misery. I bear general part of the responsibility for this. There is misfortune on all sides that stays behind as a warning that this should never happen again. My testimony and admission of guilt will also remove blame from my nation because it is individual guilt, the guilt of a man named Dragan Obrenović. I stand by this. I am responsible for this. The guilt for which I feel remorse and for which I apologise to the victims and to their shadows. I will be happy if this contributed to reconciliation in Bosnia, if neighbours can again shake hands, if our children can again play games together, and if {{they have the right to}} a chance. I will be happy if my testimony helps the families of victims, if I can spare them having to testify again and thus relive the horrors and the pain during their testimony. It is my wish that my testimony should help prevent this ever happening again, not just in Bosnia, but anywhere in the world. It is too late for me now, but for the children living in Bosnia now, it's not too late <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> that this will be a good warning to them.|$|E
500|$|The {{prosecution}} presented {{two witnesses}} {{who were at}} the hospital after the shootings. Hospital security guard Priscilla Durham and police officer Garry Bell testified that Abu-Jamal confessed in the hospital by saying, [...] "I shot the motherfucker, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> the motherfucker dies." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite the {{way things}} turned out , I'm still proud of those days [...] I feel like I was at the {{forefront}} of the gay liberation movement, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> I did my part to help it move forward. So, I kind of wear the label of 'Bathhouse Betty' with pride.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> did so, <b>and</b> {{a moment}} later we were off. I was pretty {{confident}} that Mr. Allen Price had not witnessed my departure, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>hoped</b> he would not find it out for some hours to come.|$|R
6000|$|... "The Princess {{was kind}} enough to invite me," [...] he replied, [...] "but I ventured to excuse myself. I saw that the numbers were even without me, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>hoped</b> for a little more {{conversation}} with you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, see here, Nathan, {{it begins}} to look as though there was goin' to be a row for a fact, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>hoped</b> you lived close by so I could go to your house till it was over." ...|$|R
500|$|During his gubernatorial campaign, Laffoon {{had promised}} not to seek higher office if elected governor. Term-limited by the state constitution, he {{returned}} to private life following his four years in office. On the day of Chandler's inauguration, Laffoon said [...] "I'm going to Madisonville right after the inauguration, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> to get some clients at my law office by Wednesday morning." ...|$|E
500|$|Will Ferrell's ten second cameo was well-received, with Canning concluding, [...] "...the cherry {{on the top}} was {{discovering}} that The Girlie Show was only picked up to offset the complaints raised by the series Bitch Hunter. The ten-second clip of this series, with a cameo from Will Ferrell, was phenomenal <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> the web will soon produce more clips." ...|$|E
500|$|Cameron {{calls the}} {{connection}} a [...] "subconscious" [...] reference: [...] "I have just loved... the mythology, the entire Hindu pantheon, seems so rich and vivid." [...] He continued, [...] "I didn't want to reference the Hindu religion so closely, but the subconscious association was interesting, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> I haven't offended anyone in doing so." [...] He {{has stated that}} he was familiar {{with a lot of}} beliefs of the Hindu religion and found it [...] "quite fascinating".|$|E
6000|$|... "I am glad, indeed, to hear it, Major, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>hoped</b> {{that you}} would have {{something}} of the sort to tell me. There was a look about you both that I took to mean that things were going on well." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>And</b> also, <b>I</b> <b>hoped</b> for love. <b>I</b> {{knew you}} didn't love {{me when we}} married, but <b>I</b> <b>hoped</b> for it to come.|$|R

500|$|On October 20, 1872, Briggs {{arrived at}} Pier 50 on the East River, New York City, to {{supervise}} the loading of the ship's cargo for Genoa: 1,701 barrels of poisonous denatured alcohol. A week later, Briggs was joined by his wife and baby daughter. On Sunday, November 3, Briggs wrote to his mother, telling her {{that he intended to}} leave on Tuesday, adding that, [...] "Our vessel is in beautiful trim <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> we shall have a fine passage." ...|$|E
500|$|During {{the trial}} of Sir John Fenwick, who was implicated in a plot to assassinate King William, Gloucester signed {{a letter to the}} King {{promising}} his loyalty. [...] "I, your Majesty's most dutiful subject," [...] the letter read, [...] "had rather lose my life in your Majesty's cause than in any man's else, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> it will not be long ere you conquer France." [...] Added to the letter was a declaration by the boys in Gloucester's army: [...] "We, your Majesty's subjects, will stand by you while we have a drop of blood." ...|$|E
500|$|The Junta {{reconfirmed}} the order, but excluded {{the bishop}} of Córdoba, Rodrigo de Orellana, who was banished instead. Castelli was commissioned by the Junta to enforce the execution order. Mariano Moreno said, [...] "Go, Castelli, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> you will not incur the same weakness as our general, if not yet fulfilled the determination, Larrea will go, and finally I'll go myself if necessary". Ocampo and Chiclana were demoted. Castelli's assistants were Nicolás Rodríguez Peña, elected as secretary, his former client Diego Paroissien as a campaign doctor, and Domingo French {{as head of the}} escort.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] I went on smoothly, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>hoped</b> {{to render}} what I {{was going to}} say the means of enlightening him without offence {{concerning}} the little mistake he had just made with the waitress, [...] "of course we don't take that in its closest literality." ...|$|R
60|$|Later {{that day}} I met Steele at Hoden's and {{was with him}} when he looked at the body and the written message which spoke so tersely of the enmity toward him. We left there together, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>hoped</b> Steele would let me stay with him from that moment.|$|R
6000|$|... "For {{more than}} a month," [...] she cried, [...] "and {{to think that you}} have never felt it." [...] My action was too much for her gravity, and she fell back against the {{skylight}} in a fit of merriment, which threatened to wake her father. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>hoped</b> it would.|$|R
500|$|The central {{argument}} in the letter is that the British have negated {{the rights of the}} Irish people by relying on a completely British system to pass the patent without allowing the Irish Parliament a say. William Wood, according to the Drapier, was already involved in a similar dispute with a coin he minted for Massachusetts. Wood, the Drapier claims, [...] "hath already tried his Faculty in New-England, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> he will meet with an EQUAL RECEPTION here; what That was I leave to the Publick Intelligence." [...] The response to Wood's coin was a complete boycott of the coin.|$|E
500|$|The Don Dunstan Foundation was {{established}} at the University of Adelaide {{shortly before his death}} to push for progressive change and to honour Dunstan's memory. Dunstan had spent his last months helping to lay the platform for its establishment. At the inauguration of the body, Dunstan had said [...] "What we need is a concentration on the kind of agenda which I followed <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> that my death will be useful in this". The foundation's primary work is the giving of scholarships; an additional aim is to promote causes championed by Dunstan such as human rights, social equality, multiculturalism and aboriginal rights.|$|E
500|$|Five {{days before}} the vote, United States President Bill Clinton, while {{recognizing}} the referendum as an internal issue of Canada, gave a minute-long statement extolling the virtues of a united Canada, ending with [...] "Canada {{has been a great}} model {{for the rest of the}} world, and has been a great partner of the United States, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> that can continue." [...] While the statement provided relief in sovereignist circles for not being a stronger endorsement of the [...] "No" [...] position, the implication of Clinton, who was popular in Quebec and the leader of the province's most important trading partner, endorsing Canadian unity had strong reverberations in the electorate.|$|E
60|$|In some way, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>hoped</b> {{it might}} be made clear before many days had passed, the {{delivery}} of a prisoner to Job Lord was, together with the holding of us, a trap for more important ends; but what those ends might be my mind failed totally in the grasping.|$|R
60|$|<b>And</b> yet <b>I</b> have <b>hope,</b> <b>and</b> {{the more}} <b>I</b> consider, the more <b>I</b> <b>hope.</b>|$|R
60|$|HON. Our great want, a while since, was harbour {{and good}} company, <b>and</b> now <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> we have both.|$|R
