40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to understand the mineralogical characteristics of the bentonite and its upper developed soil, at Nanggulan Kulonprogo. Separation and collection of clay fraction were done by fractionation on suspension at pH 10 after organic matter was oxidized using H 2 O 2. Characteristics of clay mineral was analyzed using X-ray diffraction on parallel oriented samples after Mg saturation, glycerol solvation, or K saturation, and its following successive heating at 100 °C, 300 °C and 550 °C. Cation exchange capacity (CEC) and the exchangeable bases were analyzed using saturation of NH 4 OAc 1 N pH 7. Results showed that clay materials of both samples were Ca-bentonite.

Heat capacity measurements reveal <b>a</b> <b>broad</b> <b>peak</b> centered <b>at</b> 125 K, whose magnitude is much larger than that expected from a Schottky anomaly due to a cubic crystal electric field. At 5 K, inelastic neutron scattering experiments clearly show the existence of <b>a</b> <b>broad</b> magnetic <b>peak</b> <b>at</b> 40 (3) meV. The absence of quasielastic scattering at this temperature, together with the almost total account of the magnetic signal in the inelastic peak, shows that the excitation has a different origin than a splitting of the electronic levels due to crystal field potential. Instead, we propose a model in which the signal originates from inelastic excitations across two hybridization bands near the Fermi energy, usually {{referred to as a}} spin gap. A simple phenomenological two-level model can account for the peak in the specific heat, with a spin-gap energy of 36 (2) meV, which is in very good agreement with the inelastic scattering data. Further, at 300 K, the inelastic response becomes purely quasielastic, which is in agreement with the theoretical calculations. Interestingly, the spin-gap energy in CeFe 4 Sb 12 exhibits a universal scaling behavior with the Kondo temperature TK.
