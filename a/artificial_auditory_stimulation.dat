Objectives: The present study aimed to evaluate the acute effects of classical baroque and heavy metal musical <b>auditory</b> <b>stimulation</b> on Heart Rate Variability (HRV) in healthy men. Patients and Methods: In this study, HRV was analyzed regarding time (SDNN, RMSSD, NN 50, and pNN 50) and frequency domain (LF, HF, and LF / HF) in 12 healthy men. HRV was recorded at seated rest for 10 minutes. Subsequently, the participants were exposed to classical baroque or heavy metal music for five minutes through an earphone at seated rest. After exposure to the first song, they remained at rest for five minutes and they were again exposed to classical baroque or heavy metal music. The music sequence was random for each individual. Standard statistical methods were used for calculation of means and standard deviations. Besides, ANOVA and Friedman test were used for parametric and non-parametric distributions, respectively. Results: While listening to heavy metal music, SDNN was reduced compared to the baseline (P = 0. 023). In addition, the LF index (ms 2 and nu) was reduced during exposure to both heavy metal and classical baroque musical <b>auditory</b> <b>stimulation</b> compared to the control condition (P = 0. 010 and P = 0. 048, respectively).

We hypothesized that the putatively facilitated access should be reflected in increased activation of the amygdala upon bilateral EMDR stimulation even in healthy subjects. We investigated 22 healthy female university students (mean 23. 5 years) with fMRI. Subjects were scanned while confronted with blocks of disgusting and neutral picture stimuli.

Study design: The study was performed in 16 healthy men aged 18 - 25 years. All procedures were performed in the same soundproof room. We analyzed heart rate variability (HRV) in time (standard deviation of normal-to-normal R-R intervals [SDNN], root-mean square of differences [RMSSD] and percentage of adjacent NN intervals with a difference of duration greater than 50 ms [pNN 50]) and frequency (low frequency [LF], high frequency [HF] and LF/HF ratio) domains.

40|$|Binocular rivalry is an {{intriguing}} visual phenomenon which over recent decades has particularly engaged {{the interest of}} scientists. This phenomenon is induced when two different images are viewed, one by each eye, with alternations occurring between perceiving one image for a few seconds, followed by the other image for a few seconds. Thus, despite the constant sensory input, there are striking changes in perception. There are several extrinsic factors (e. g. stimulus variables such as contrast, colour, motion) that are well known to influence rivalry, however, much less work has been conducted {{on the effect of}} other extrinsic factors such as non-visual stimulation. Recent studies into multimodal influences (e. g. tactile, olfactory, <b>auditory</b> <b>stimulation)</b> on binocular rivalry indicate that interactions occur between the different senses; whereby there are significant changes in how often subjects perceive either of the presented images. The aim {{of the study was to}} further our understanding of the mechanisms involved in rivalry processing, with implications also for understanding how multiple and often conflicting stimuli from the environment are resolved in the human brain. For this purpose, the influence of <b>auditory</b> <b>stimulation</b> on binocular rivalry was explored using unilateral and bilateral auditory stimuli.

A randomized sham-controlled, single blind study was conducted in a clinical setting on adult participants with chronic tinnitus (n = 14). Compensatory <b>auditory</b> <b>stimulation</b> (CAS) and HD-tDCS were administered either individually or in combination in order to access the effects of both interventions on tinnitus perception.

Minimum masking levels and the visual analog scale were used to assess the strength of the tinnitus percept immediately before and after the treatment intervention. CAS reduced minimum masking levels, and visual analog scale trended towards improvement. Effects of HD-tDCS could not be resolved with the current sample size.
