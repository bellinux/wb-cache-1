5|$|Two major {{versions}} of its manuscripts are known. One has fifteen verses but attached to Atharvaveda, while <b>another</b> <b>very</b> different and augmented manuscript {{exists in the}} Telugu language which has one hundred and forty two verses and {{is attached to the}} Krishna Yajurveda. The text is notable for describing Yoga in the Vaishnavism tradition.|$|E
5|$|<b>Another</b> <b>very</b> ancient seat is the {{so-called}} “Chair of Dagobert” in the Louvre. It is of cast bronze, sharpened with the chisel and partially gilt; it is of the curule or faldstool type and supported upon legs terminating in the heads and feet of animals. The seat, which was probably of leather, has disappeared. Its attribution depends entirely upon the statement of Suger, abbot of St Denis in the 12th century, who added a back and arms. Its age has been much discussed, but Viollet-le-Duc dated it to early Merovingian times, and it may in any case be taken as the oldest faldstool in existence.|$|E
5|$|<b>Another</b> <b>very</b> {{important}} mode is the G mode (G from graphite). This mode {{corresponds to}} planar vibrations of carbon atoms and {{is present in}} most graphite-like materials. G band in SWCNT is shifted to lower frequencies relative to graphite (1580cm−1) and is split into several peaks. The splitting pattern and intensity depend on the tube structure and excitation energy; they can be used, though with much lower accuracy compared to RBM mode, to estimate the tube diameter and whether the tube is metallic or semiconducting.|$|E

5|$|It is not {{possible}} to estimate the chances of <b>another</b> <b>very</b> bright Kreutz comet arriving in the near future, but given that at least 10 have reached naked eye visibility over the last 200 years, another great comet from the Kreutz family seems almost certain to arrive at some point. Comet White–Ortiz–Bolelli in 1970 reached an apparent magnitude of 1. In December 2011, Kreutz sungrazer C/2011 W3 (Lovejoy) survived its perihelion passage and had an apparent magnitude of −3.|$|E
5|$|Mount Tambora has {{remained}} active {{since the end}} of the 1815 eruption sequence. Minor lava domes and flows were extruded on the caldera floor during the 19th and 20th centuries. Sometime between 1850 and 1910, Tambora erupted again but only inside the caldera. Small lava flows and lava dome extrusions were formed. This eruption (VEI-2) created the Doro Api Toi parasitic cone inside the caldera. A very small (VEI-0) and non-explosive eruption occurred in 1967; <b>Another</b> <b>very</b> small eruption was reported in 2011. In August 2011, the alert level for the volcano was raised from level I to level II after increasing activity was reported in the caldera, including earthquakes and smoke emissions.|$|E
5|$|Stela 88 {{may have}} been paired with Stela 62. The {{monument}} has {{the image of a}} queen but her name is unknown. B'olon K'awiil also appears to be mentioned on the stela. It dates to around 751 and stands on the stairway of Structure 13. Stela 91 is <b>another</b> <b>very</b> late monument probably dating to the early 10th century. Like Stela 84, it bears an inscription that is a meaningless imitation of hieroglyphic writing.|$|E

5|$|<b>Another</b> <b>very</b> common {{component}} of distributed element filters is the stub. Over {{a narrow range}} of frequencies, a stub {{can be used as}} a capacitor or an inductor (its impedance is determined by its length) but over a wide band it behaves as a resonator. Short-circuit, nominally quarter-wavelength stubs (figure 3(a)) behave as shunt LC antiresonators, and an open-circuit nominally quarter-wavelength stub (figure 3(b)) behaves as a series LC resonator. Stubs can also be used in conjunction with impedance transformers to build more complex filters and, as would be expected from their resonant nature, are most useful in band-pass applications. While open-circuit stubs are easier to manufacture in planar technologies, they have the drawback that the termination deviates significantly from an ideal open circuit (see figure 4(b)), often leading to a preference for short-circuit stubs (one can always be used in place of the other by adding or subtracting λ/4 to or from the length).|$|E
5|$|John's first {{marriage}} probably dates to {{after his arrival}} in Serbia, though the identity of his first wife, if any, is unknown. If the next ruler of Valona, Alexander Komnenos Asen, was his son, {{then he would have}} been born circa 1346–1348, as he was already an adult in 1363–1366. This would place John's potential {{first marriage}} a few years before Alexander's estimated birth. Around 1350–1355, John married Anna Palaiologina, a granddaughter of Byzantine Emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos and a widow of John II Orsini, the despot of Epirus. This marriage to an Epirote noblewoman consolidated and legitimised John's position in the region. Besides Alexander, <b>another</b> <b>very</b> likely child of John Komnenos Asen was a certain Komnena, the wife of Balša II who had succeeded Alexander as ruler of Valona in early 1372.|$|E
