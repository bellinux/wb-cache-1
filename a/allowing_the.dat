5|$|<b>Allowing</b> <b>the</b> enpassant capture, {{together}} {{with the introduction of}} the two-square first move for pawns, {{was one of the last}} major rule changes in European chess, and occurred between 1200 and 1600. Other relatively recent rule changes were castling, the unlimited range for queens and bishops (Spanish master Ruy López de Segura gives the rule in his 1561 book Libro de la invencion liberal y arte del juego del axedrez) and a change to the rules on pawn promotion. In most places the en passant rule was adopted at the same time as <b>allowing</b> <b>the</b> pawn to move two squares on its first move, but it was not universally accepted until the Italian rules were changed in 1880.|$|E
