Tunis' work often protested the increasing professionalization of sports in America. He believed that amateur participation in sports taught values important for good citizenship like perseverance, fair play and equality, and that the emphasis on professional sports was turning America into a country of spectators. His sports books also tackled current social issues such as antisemitism and racial equality.|$|E

Analysis indicated that (1) Performance-approach goals were positively associated with perception of physical education Competence, Entity beliefs <b>about</b> <b>sport</b> ability, the Performance dimension of the motivational climate, and negatively associated with Incremental beliefs <b>about</b> <b>sport</b> ability. (2) Mastery goals were positively associated with perception of physical education Competence, Incremental beliefs <b>about</b> <b>sport</b> ability, the Mastery dimension of the motivational climate, and negatively associated with the Performance dimension of the motivational climate. Also, (3) Performance-avoidance goals were positively associated with Entity beliefs <b>about</b> <b>sport</b> ability and the Performance dimension of the motivational climate; these goals were negatively associated with Incremental beliefs <b>about</b> <b>sport</b> ability and perception of physical education Competence.

500|$|Although he {{accepted}} {{an invitation from}} President Lyndon B.

On his 70th birthday, Nurmi agreed to an interview for Yle, Finland's national public-broadcasting company, only after learning that President Kekkonen would act as the interviewer. Suffering from health problems, {{with at least one}} heart attack, a stroke and failing eyesight, Nurmi at times spoke bitterly <b>about</b> <b>sports,</b> calling it a waste of time compared to science and art. He died in 1973 in Helsinki and was given a state funeral. Kekkonen attended the funeral and praised Nurmi: [...] "People explore the horizons for a successor. But none comes and none will, for his class is extinguished with him." [...] At the request of Nurmi, who enjoyed classical music and played the violin, Konsta Jylhä's Vaiennut viulu (The Silenced Violin) was played during the ceremony. Nurmi's last record fell in 1996; his 1925 world record for the indoor 2000 m lasted as the Finnish national record for 71 years.|$|E
500|$|Defenders of {{the current}} usage often state their {{intention}} to honor Native Americans by referring to positive traits, such as fighting spirit and being aggressive, brave, stoic, dedicated, and proud; while opponents see these traits as being based upon stereotypes of Native Americans as savages. In general, the social sciences recognize that all stereotypes, whether positive or negative, are harmful because they promote false or misleading associations between a group and an attribute, fostering a disrespectful relationship. The injustice of such stereotypes is recognized with regard to other racial or ethnic groups, thus mascots are morally questionable regardless of offense being taken by individuals. Defenders {{of the status quo}} also state that the issue is not important, being only <b>about</b> <b>sports,</b> and that the opposition is nothing more than [...] "political correctness", which change advocates argue ignores the extensive evidence of harmful effects of stereotypes and bias. Although there has been a steady {{decline in the number of}} teams doing so, Native American images and nicknames nevertheless remain fairly common in American and Canadian sports, and may be found in use at all levels, from youth teams to professional sports franchises.|$|E
500|$|The {{popularity}} of Hemingway's work {{depends on its}} themes of love, war, wilderness and loss, {{all of which are}} strongly evident in the body of work. These are recurring themes in American literature, and are quite clearly evident in Hemingway's work. Critic Leslie Fiedler sees the theme he defines as [...] "The Sacred Land"—the American West—extended in Hemingway's work to include mountains in Spain, Switzerland and Africa, and to the streams of Michigan. The American West is given a symbolic nod with the naming of the [...] "Hotel Montana" [...] in The Sun Also Rises and For Whom the Bell Tolls. [...] According to Stoltzfus and Fiedler, in Hemingway's work, nature is a place for rebirth and rest; and it is where the hunter or fisherman might experience a moment of transcendence at the moment they kill their prey. Nature is where men exist without women: men fish; men hunt; men find redemption in nature. Although Hemingway does write <b>about</b> <b>sports,</b> such as fishing, Carlos Baker notes the emphasis is more on the athlete than the sport. At its core, much of Hemingway's work can be viewed in the light of American naturalism, evident in detailed descriptions such as those in [...] "Big Two-Hearted River".|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we explore}} how {{physically}} disabled youth {{who participate in}} mainstream education discursively construct and position themselves in relation to dominant discourses <b>about</b> <b>sport</b> and physicality that mark their bodies as ‘abnormal’ and ‘deviant’. We employ a feminist poststructuralist perspective to analyze the narratives <b>about</b> <b>sport,</b> physical education (PE), the body and self of four physically disabled Dutch youngsters. Our results indicate that although dominant societal discourses <b>about</b> <b>sport</b> and physicality construct disabled bodies as deviant, vulnerable and lacking and the disabled as ‘abnormal’, these youth constructed the self as ‘normal’. However, they did so in different ways. One of the interviewees used the alternative discourse ‘everyone is different, everyone is normal’ to position her disabled self as different and normal simultaneously. Hereby she resisted dominant notions about the abled body embedded in discourses <b>about</b> <b>sport</b> and physicality. This act of resistance enabled her to accept her disability {{as part of her}} self. Others normalized their disabled bodies by attempting to pass as able-bodied. They tried to minimize and/or hide their disability and in this manner reproduced ableist discourses <b>about</b> <b>sport</b> and physicality. Our interviewees also engaged in various performative acts of resistance. They challenged these dominant discourses by strategically using the possibilities a different/disabled self provided them. Overall the data indicate the important role that visible signifiers of disability played in the exclusionary practices that these disabled youth encountered and the subject positions they could claim. Since alternative constructions and positionings regarding the abled/normal body suggest ways in which the dominance of ableism may be disrupted, we conclude with an emphasis on the need for future research that explores such alternatives...|$|R
