In this work, its special type of hydropiercing-bend is simulated using Rice and Tracey ductile criterion based on VUMAT of ABAQUS/Explicit and verified by experiments. Hydropiercing-bend processes with different slope angles of chamfer are discussed to predict the ultimate quality. It is shown that the <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>chamfer</b> should be less than 70 º {{for this kind of}} material and technical condition {{in order to make the}} slug attached with the tube blank...|$|E

40|$|Experimental {{investigations}} {{are carried out}} on Hartmann whistles to explore the effect <b>of</b> external <b>chamfer</b> at the cavity mouth. The acoustic performance depends upon the cavity length, jet-to-cavity-spacing and external chamfer angle (15 °, 30 °, and 45 °). The modifications in spectral and directional characteristics <b>of</b> external <b>chamfered</b> Hartmann whistles {{are studied in detail}} and are compared with a regular cavity. The frequencies are observed to attain a minimum value at a <b>chamfer</b> <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> 30 ° along with modification in the acoustic spectra. In general, it is noticed that the external chamfered whistles are directive at an emission <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> around 45 ° where it is around 37 ° for a regular whistle. Numerical simulations portray the flow/shock oscillation features in external chamfered cavities. Simulations depict intense flow diversion at the mouth <b>of</b> <b>chamfered</b> cavities and elucidate the directivity shift as well as the enhancement of acoustic power observed experimentally. Thus, it is observed that Hartmann whistles with external chamfering could radiate acoustic power up to 2. 3 times that of a non-chamfered whistle...|$|R

This study evaluated the existence of correlation between in vitro margin fit and a new microleakage technique for complete crowns cemented with 3 different luting agents. Thirty human premolars were prepared for full-coverage crowns with a convergence <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> 6 degrees, <b>chamfer</b> margin <b>of</b> 1. 2 mm circumferentially, and occlusal reduction of 1. 5 mm. Ni-Cr cast crowns were cemented with either zinc phosphate (ZP) (S. S. White), resin-modified glass-ionomer (RMGI) (Rely X Luting Cement) or a resin-based luting agent (RC) (Enforce). Margin fit (seating discrepancy and margin gap) was evaluated according to criteria in the literature under microscope with 0. 001 mm accuracy. After thermal cycling, crowns were longitudinally sectioned and microleakage scores at tooth-cement interface were obtained and recorded at × 100 magnification. Margin fit parameters were compared with the one-way ANOVA test and microleakage scores with Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn's tests (alpha= 0. 05). Correlation between margin fit and microleakage was analyzed with the Spearman's test (alpha= 0. 05). Seating discrepancy and marginal gap values ranged from 81. 82 µm to 137. 22 µm (p= 0. 117), and from 75. 42 µm to 78. 49 µm (p= 0. 940), respectively. Marginal microleakage scores were ZP= 3. 02, RMGI= 0. 35 and RC= 0. 12 (p 0. 05). Conclusion: Margin fit parameters and microleakage showed no strong correlations; cast crowns cemented with RMGI and RC had lower microleakage scores than ZP cement...|$|R
