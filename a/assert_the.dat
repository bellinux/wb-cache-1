5|$|In the end {{the fines}} were never paid, and the lands were soon restored. Edward had {{nevertheless}} demonstrated an important point. After the conquest of Wales, the strategic position of the Marcher lordships was less vital to the English crown, and the liberty awarded to the Marcher lords could be curtailed. For Edward this was therefore {{a good opportunity to}} <b>assert</b> <b>the</b> royal prerogative, and to demonstrate that it extended also into the Marches of Wales.|$|E
5|$|Regarding air transport, Aarhus {{is served}} by the Aarhus Airport in Tirstrup about 35km {{northeast}} of the city centre. There has been much discussion about constructing a new airport closer to the city for many years, but so far, no plans have been realised. In August 2014, the city council officially initiated a process to <b>assert</b> <b>the</b> viability of a new international airport. A small seaplane now operates four flights daily between Aarhus harbour and Copenhagen harbour.|$|E

5|$|The Arnolfini {{is named}} after Jan van Eyck's {{masterpiece}} The Arnolfini Portrait (1434) depicting the merchant and arts patron Giovanni Arnolfini. The Arnolfini Portrait {{is one of the}} earliest paintings to <b>assert</b> <b>the</b> presence of the artist within its depiction (an inscription {{in the middle of the}} work and a reflection in a mirror on the back wall) and one of Arnolfini's consistent concerns: to explore the role of artist as a witness and recorder of what is around them – contemporary society. The painting is in the National Gallery, London and it was one of the founder's favourite paintings.|$|E
5|$|A Free Ride, {{also known}} as A Grass Sandwich, is a stag film of the silent era that is {{considered}} to be the earliest extant American hardcore pornographic movie. It depicts a motorist who picks up two women from the roadside and later engages in several sex acts with them. Although most scholars consider A Free Ride a 1915 film, some sources claim that it was produced later. The film's director used a pseudonym and the cast remained anonymous. The filming location is not known, although it may have been produced in New Jersey. Two contradictory theories have emerged regarding the identities of the cast: some sources suggest they were people with low social status, but others <b>assert</b> <b>the</b> opposite. The Kinsey Institute has a print of the film in its collection. A Free Ride was screened at the inauguration of the Museum of Sex. In 2004, Lisa Oppenheim, a New York-based artist, remade the film.|$|E
5|$|During {{the winter}} of 1861, Johnson tried mightily to <b>assert</b> <b>the</b> {{legitimacy}} of the fledgling government, but to no avail. Its jurisdiction extended {{only as far as}} the area controlled by the Confederate Army. Johnson came woefully short of raising the 46,000 troops requested by the Confederate Congress in Richmond. Efforts to levy taxes and to compel citizens to turn over their guns to the government were similarly unsuccessful. On January 3, 1862, Johnson requested a sum of $3million from the Confederate Congress to meet the provisional government's operating expenses. The Congress instead approved a sum of $2million, the expenditure of which required approval of Secretary of War Judah P. Benjamin and President Davis.|$|E
5000|$|Redundancy theorists {{begin by}} inquiring into the {{function}} of the predicate [...] "__is true" [...] in sentences like [...] " [...] 'Snow is white' is true". They reason that <b>asserting</b> <b>the</b> longer sentence is equivalent to <b>asserting</b> <b>the</b> shorter sentence [...] "Snow is white". From this they infer that nothing is added to the assertion of the sentence [...] "Snow is white" [...] by quoting it, appending the predicate [...] "__is true", and then <b>asserting</b> <b>the</b> result.|$|R

5|$|Dworkin {{authored}} ten {{books of}} radical feminist theory and numerous speeches and articles, each designed to <b>assert</b> <b>the</b> presence of and denounce institutionalized and normalized harm against women. She {{became one of}} the most influential writers and spokeswomen of American radical feminism during the late 1970s and the 1980s. She characterized pornography as an industry of damaging objectification and abuse, not merely a fantasy realm. She discussed prostitution as a system of exploitation, and intercourse as a key site of subordination in patriarchy. Her analysis and writing influenced and inspired the work of contemporary feminists, such as Catharine MacKinnon, Gloria Steinem, John Stoltenberg, Nikki Craft, Susan Cole, and Amy Elman.|$|E
5|$|Many Lollards {{were still}} about, {{especially}} in London and the Thames Valley, in Essex and Kent, Coventry, Bristol {{and even in}} the North, who would be receptive to the new ideas when they came, who looked for a reform in the lifestyle of the clergy. They emphasised the preaching of the word over the sacrament of the altar, holding the latter to be but a memorial, but they were not party to the actions of the government. Other ideas, critical of the papal supremacy were held, not only by Lollards, but by those who wished to <b>assert</b> <b>the</b> supremacy of the secular state over the church but also by conciliarists such as Thomas More and, initially, Cranmer. Other Roman Catholic reformists, including John Colet, Dean of St Paul's, warned that heretics were not nearly so great a danger to the faith as the wicked and indolent lives of the clergy.|$|E
5|$|Mary Ann Davis, who {{had bought}} the Fornells grant on Key Biscayne in 1821, died in Galveston, Texas in 1885. Her son Waters Smith Davis began taking steps to <b>assert</b> <b>the</b> family title to the island. In 1887 he {{purchased}} {{the rights of the}} other Davis heirs and received a new deed in his name. He could not get a clear title, however. Venancio Sanchez still claimed a half share of the Fornells Grant, two of the town lots had been sold to William Harney around 1840, and Osborne and Field had their deed from the Florida Internal Improvement Fund. Davis received quitclaims from Osborn and Field, and on the Harney lots, but was unable to settle with Sanchez. He finally received a patent from the United States government for his land in 1898. In 1903 Davis bought the abandoned Cape Florida lighthouse from the United States Treasury for US$400.|$|E

5|$|Mason slowly {{moved from}} being a {{peripheral}} figure towards the center of Virginia politics, but his published response to the Stamp Act, which he opposed, is most notable {{for the inclusion of}} his anti-slavery views. George Washington or George William Fairfax, the burgesses for Fairfax County, may have asked Mason's advice as to what steps to take in the crisis. Mason drafted an act to allow {{for one of the most}} common court actions, replevin, to take place without the use of stamped paper, and sent it to George Washington, by then one of Fairfax County's burgesses, to gain passage. This action contributed to a boycott of the stamps. With the courts and trade paralyzed, the British Parliament repealed the Stamp Act in 1766, but continued to <b>assert</b> <b>the</b> right to tax the colonies.|$|E
5|$|Mellitus {{attended}} a council of bishops held in Italy in February 610, convened by Pope Boniface IV. The historian N. J. Higham speculates {{that one reason}} for his attendance may have been to <b>assert</b> <b>the</b> English Church's independence from the Frankish Church. Boniface had Mellitus take two papal letters back to England, one to Æthelbert and his people, and another to Laurence, the Archbishop of Canterbury. He also brought back the synod's decrees to England. No authentic letters or documents from this synod remain, although some were forged in the 1060s and 1070s at Canterbury. During his time as a bishop, Mellitus joined with Justus, the Bishop of Rochester, in signing a letter that Laurence wrote to the Celtic bishops urging the Celtic Church to adopt the Roman method of calculating the date of Easter. This letter also mentioned the fact that Irish missionary bishops, such as Dagan, refused to eat with the Roman missionaries.|$|E
5|$|On 16 December, Minnesota steamed out of Hampton Roads {{with the}} Great White Fleet for a circumnavigation of the globe. The cruise was {{intended}} as a show of force to Japan, the United States' rival in the Pacific, to <b>assert</b> <b>the</b> United States' status as a global naval power, and to convince Congress of the need to support increased naval expenditures. The fleet cruised south to the Caribbean and then to South America, making stops in Port of Spain, Rio de Janeiro, Punta Arenas, and Valparaíso, among other cities. After arriving in Mexico in March 1908, the fleet spent three weeks conducting gunnery practice. The fleet then resumed its voyage up the Pacific coast of the Americas, stopping in San Francisco and Seattle before crossing the Pacific to Australia, stopping in Hawaii on the way. Stops in the South Pacific included Melbourne, Sydney, and Auckland.|$|E

5|$|The {{different}} species of Eucteniza are distinguished by differences in body size, limb proportions, number of tibial spines, and shape of female sperm receptacles, as well as geographic location. Most species are known from male specimens only, but E. rosalia and E. panchovillai are known only from female specimens. Eucteniza species are distributed throughout central and northern Mexico, much of Texas, and {{the lower part of}} the Baja Peninsula. Many species are only known from the type locality, the site where the type specimen or specimens were originally collected. The species with the largest range is E. relata, although Bond and Godwin <b>assert</b> <b>the</b> species is actually composed of multiple as-yet-unnamed cryptic species (distinct species erroneously grouped into one) that will require additional morphological or genetic research to distinguish.|$|E
5|$|In 1490, Sigismund {{was forced}} to abdicate and turn over all his territories to Frederick's son Maximilian I. Maximilian had married Mary of Burgundy in 1477 {{after the death of}} Charles the Bold in the Burgundy Wars and thus {{inherited}} the Burgundian territories: Duchy and County of Burgundy and the Netherlands. He took over and expanded the Burgundian administration with a more centralized style of government, which in 1482, caused the outbreak of a rebellion of the cities and counts, allied with Charles VIII of France, against Maximilian. The Duchy of Burgundy was also a French fiefdom and immediately claimed by Charles VIII. The first phase of this conflict would last until 1489, keeping Maximilian occupied in the Low Countries. He even fell into the hands of his enemies and was held prisor for four months in Bruges in 1488. He was freed only when his father sent an army under the command of duke Albert of Saxony to his rescue. Maximilian subsequently returned to Germany, leaving his cousin Albert as his representative. Albert would, in the following years, manage to <b>assert</b> <b>the</b> Habsburg hegemony in the Netherlands.|$|E
5|$|The {{power balance}} {{began to change}} after King Rajendra came of age and his grandmother, Tripurasundari, died on 26 March 1832 due to cholera. Bhimsen lost his main support and the court became a stage for a power struggle, which even though started off {{as an attempt to}} <b>assert</b> <b>the</b> King's {{authority}} from the Mukhtiyar, spread to various aristocratic clans and their attempt to secure total authority. It was no secret that Bhimsen was able to maintain his supremacy due to the large standing army under his and his family's command; and in the subsequent years, different factions would attempt to increase their influence based on the strength of the number of battalions under their grip. After Tripurasundari's death, the royal seal by which government orders were approved naturally went {{into the hands of the}} senior queen Samrajya Laxmi, who knew all too well of its powers and wanted to emulate the queens of the past by establishing her own regency. Sensing Samrajya Laxmi's ambition, Ranbir Singh started to stroke her dislike of Bhimsen in the hopes of becoming the mukhtiyar himself. Getting a whiff of this matter, Bhimsen strongly reprimanded Ranbir Singh which caused him to resign from his General's position and live in retirement in his house at Sipamandan. However, Bhimsen later managed to placate his brother, by giving him the title of Chota (Little) General, and send him to Palpa as its governor. Since he could find nobody that he could trust to keep watch over the royal palace, Bhimsen from then on started to live in an ordinary rented house located near the palace premise.|$|E
