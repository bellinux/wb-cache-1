Comet White–Ortiz–Bolelli in 1970 reached an apparent magnitude of 1. In December 2011, Kreutz sungrazer C/2011 W3 (Lovejoy) survived its perihelion passage and had an apparent magnitude of −3.|$|E
5|$|Although {{all of its}} {{components}} had been tested in target and drop tests, no full test of a gun-type nuclear weapon occurred before Hiroshima. There were several reasons for not testing a Little Boy type of device. Primarily, there was insufficient uranium-235. Additionally, the weapon design was simple enough {{that it was only}} deemed necessary to do laboratory tests with the gun-type assembly. Unlike the implosion design, which required sophisticated coordination of shaped explosive charges, the gun-type design was considered <b>almost</b> <b>certain</b> <b>to</b> work. Thirty-two drop tests were conducted at Wendover, and only once did the bomb fail to fire. One last-minute modification was made, to allow the powder bags of propellant that fired the gun to be loaded in the bomb bay.|$|E
5|$|Although {{all of its}} {{components}} had been tested, no full test of a gun-type nuclear weapon occurred before the Little Boy was dropped over Hiroshima. The only test explosion of a nuclear weapon concept had been of an implosion-type device employing plutonium as its fissile material, and took place on 16 July 1945 at the Trinity nuclear test. There were several reasons for not testing a Little Boy type of device. Primarily, there was little uranium-235 {{as compared with the}} relatively large amount of plutonium which, it was expected, could be produced by the Hanford Site reactors. Additionally, the weapon design was simple enough that it was only deemed necessary to do laboratory tests with the gun-type assembly. Unlike the implosion design, which required sophisticated coordination of shaped explosive charges, the gun-type design was considered <b>almost</b> <b>certain</b> <b>to</b> work.|$|E

With Johanns' move to Washington, few high-profile Republicans stepped up to run against Nelson, as the state party focused its attention on the governor's race.

In the 20-year span from 1960 to 1989 from the theater standpoint, the majority of cartoons in Hong Kong were imported from the US. It was typical to play American movies in major cinemas preceded by an American cartoon segment. Sometimes the segment would even be shown in its entirety.

25|$|A nuclear renaissance is {{possible}} but cannot occur overnight. Nuclear projects face significant hurdles, including extended construction periods and related risks, long licensing processes and manpower shortages, plus long‐standing {{issues related to}} waste disposal, proliferation and local opposition. The financing of new nuclear power plants, especially in liberalized markets, has always been difficult and the financial crisis seems <b>almost</b> <b>certain</b> <b>to</b> have made it even more so. The huge capital requirements, combined with risks of cost overruns and regulatory uncertainties, make investors and lenders very cautious, even when demand growth is robust.|$|E
25|$|Leaders of the {{political}} opposition have also been implicated in CICIG investigations: several legislators and members of Libertad Democrática Renovada party (LIDER) were formally accused of bribery-related issues, prompting a large decline in the electoral prospects of its presidential candidate, Manuel Baldizón, who until April had been <b>almost</b> <b>certain</b> <b>to</b> become the next Guatemalan president in the 6 September 2015 presidential elections. Baldizón's popularity steeply declined and he filed accusations with the Organization of American States against CICIG leader Iván Velásquez of international obstruction in Guatemalan internal affairs.|$|E

25|$|For the League's 13th Round, Palmeiras drew with Goiás {{away from}} home by the score of 1–1. Ewerthon opened the score after just 12 minutes from the {{beginning}} with a long range shot. Palmeiras played extremely well during the first half, but in the second half, the team didn't make a good appearance, trying to hold a 1–0 lead until the end, when a dubious foul was committed by Palmeiras defence, and after the kick, Goiás drew with a header from Amaral. The result was disappointing for the team who was <b>almost</b> <b>certain</b> <b>to</b> win 3 points in the league. Despite of the bad result, the team continued 11th in the table awaiting the return of some important players to the squad. In the following round, Palmeiras won the match against Atlético-PR by 2–0 {{in a very good}} appearance from all the players.|$|E
25|$|After {{a lengthy}} holdout {{to start the}} 1997–98 season, Fedorov, a {{restricted}} free agent, signed an offer sheet with the Carolina Hurricanes worth up to $38million (with bonuses). The Red Wings matched the offer on February 26, 1998, ending Fedorov's holdout. The offer included $14million for signing and $2million for 21 regular season games, but the most controversial {{part of the deal}} was a $12million bonus payable immediately if Fedorov's team reached 1998 conference finals – at the time, Detroit was already a Cup contender while Carolina was <b>almost</b> <b>certain</b> <b>to</b> miss the playoffs, so the clause was criticized for creating an unfair disadvantage for Detroit. Nevertheless, the Red Wings did match the offer and paid the bonus. The $28million Detroit paid Fedorov for 43 total games in 1997–98 is the largest single season amount paid to an NHL player. Fedorov led the playoffs in goals and helped the Red Wings win their second consecutive Stanley Cup that season.|$|E

50|$|After {{the presidential}} election, Seymour {{remained}} involved in state politics, though primarily as an elder statesman {{rather than an}} active politician. He received a number of honors during this period, including the chancellorship of Union College in 1873. In 1874 he turned down <b>almost</b> <b>certain</b> election <b>to</b> the United States Senate, urging the nomination instead of the eventual choice, Francis Kernan.
