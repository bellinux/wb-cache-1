Abstract – Influence of an {{ion beam}} on {{properties}} of magnetron (planar geometry) is considered {{and character of}} display of such influence on features of initiation of the <b>abnormal</b> <b>glow</b> <b>discharge</b> of low pressure is experimentally investigated. Character-istics of initiation of the discharge in the bottom range of pressure < 8 · 10 – 2 Pa are determined at an irradiation of the magnetron cathode a beam of ions of argon. Dominating factors of initiation of the <b>abnormal</b> <b>glow</b> <b>discharge</b> of low pressure in magnetron are ion–electron emission and sputter-ing of the magnetron cathode by ion beam. Falling dependence of a voltage of initiation of the dis-charge on energy of ions and threshold dependence of a voltage of initiation on a current of an ion beam is established. The prospect of expansion of functionalities of planar magnetron is shown due to the coordination of modes of sputtering of the magnetron anode by an ion beam and the magne-tron cathode by plasma ions of the <b>abnormal</b> <b>glow</b> <b>discharge.</b> 1...|$|E

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. This thesis presents the experimental and theoretical studies of nonthermal and stable atmospheric-pressure <b>glow</b> <b>discharges.</b> With the excitation frequency in the kilohertz range, a uniform and stable <b>glow</b> <b>discharge</b> has been successfully produced in atmospheric helium without the usually indispensable dielectric barrier. For this barrier-free cold atmospheric discharge, there are two discharge events occurring, respectively, in the voltage-rising and the voltage-falling phases, and in general they compete with each other. This distinct feature is illustrated through a detailed fluid simulation. For direct current atmospheric <b>glow</b> <b>discharges,</b> their cathode fall region is shown to depend critically on the discharge current density. For atmospheric <b>glow</b> <b>discharges</b> excited at 13. 56 MHz on the other hand, we present observations that after gas breakdown, the discharge evolves from the normal glow mode to the <b>abnormal</b> <b>glow</b> mode and then through the recovery mode back to the normal glow mode. The operation modes, namely the a mode and the y mode, in radio-frequency atmospheric <b>glow</b> <b>discharges</b> are investigated with a one-dimensional, self-consistent continuum model. This model is evaluated by comparing our numerical results with experimental data and other simulation results in literature. It is shown that gas ionization is volumetric in the a mode and localized in the boundary region between the sheath and the bulk plasma in the y mode. The stable operation regime in the a mode is {{found to have a}} positive differential conductivity, and can be expanded to higher discharge current density without compensating plasma reactivity by increasing the excitation frequency. Furthermore this plasma stability-reactivity balance is also studied for radio-frequency atmospheric glow microdischarges...|$|R
