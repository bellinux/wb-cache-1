Gastroesophageal reflux may cause arching of the back <b>and</b> <b>twisting</b> of the {{head to the side}} in infants, which may be mistaken for tonic-clonic seizures.|$|E
5|$|Dragonflies {{generate}} lift in {{at least}} four ways at different times, including classical lift like an aircraft wing; supercritical lift with the wing above the critical angle, generating high lift and using very short strokes to avoid stalling; creating vortices; and vortex shedding. Some families appear to use special mechanisms, as for example the Libellulidae which take off rapidly, their wings beginning pointed far forward and twisted almost vertically. Dragonfly wings behave highly dynamically during flight, flexing <b>and</b> <b>twisting</b> during each beat. Among the variables are wing curvature, length and speed of stroke, angle of attack, forward/back position of wing, and phase relative to the other wings.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} sport, {{the use of}} poles for {{vaulting}} distances was recorded in Fierljeppen contests in the Frisian area of Europe, and vaulting for height was seen at gymnastics competitions in Germany in the 1770s. One of the earliest recorded pole vault competitions was in Cumbria, England in 1843. The basic rules and technique of the event originated in the United States. The rules required that athletes do not move their hands along the pole and athletes began clearing the bar with their feet first <b>and</b> <b>twisting</b> so that the stomach faces the bar. Bamboo poles were introduced in the 20th century and a metal box in the runway for planting the pole became standard. Landing mattresses were introduced in the mid-20th century to protect the athletes who were clearing increasingly greater heights.|$|E

The physical measurands considered are strain, temperature, curvature, <b>and</b> <b>twist.</b> A noticeable sensitivity to strain, temperature, <b>and</b> <b>twist</b> is observed, with a blueshift to increase strain <b>and</b> <b>twist.</b> An increase in temperature induces a redshift. On the other hand, curvature has no observable effect on the spectral position of the photonic bandgap edge...|$|R

Given a wild card to Queen's, Murray progressed past Santiago Ventura in straight sets for his first ATP match win. Following a second-round win against Taylor Dent, he played former Australian Open champion Thomas Johansson in the third round, losing in three sets after cramping <b>and</b> <b>twisting</b> his ankle. Following his performance at Queen's, Murray received a wild card for Wimbledon. Ranked No. 312, Murray became the first Scot in the Open Era to reach the third round of the men's singles tournament at Wimbledon. In the third round, Murray lost to 2002 Wimbledon finalist David Nalbandian due to cramping and fatigue, having led two sets to love.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after passing}} Fobney Lock and the {{associated}} water treatment works, the Kennet flood plain narrows and the river enters a narrow steep-sided gap in the hills forming the southern flank of the Thames flood plain. At County Lock the river enters the centre of Reading, where it formerly flowed through the centre of a large brewery. This narrow <b>and</b> <b>twisting</b> stretch of the river became known as Brewery Gut. Because of poor visibility {{and the difficulty of}} boats passing in this stretch, traffic has long been controlled by a set of maritime traffic lights. Today the Brewery Gut is a major feature of Reading's The Oracle shopping centre.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} about the social {{behavior}} of H. suspectum, but they have been observed engaging in male-male combat, in which the dominant male lies on top of the subordinate one and pins it with its front and hind limbs. Both lizards arch their bodies, pushing against each other <b>and</b> <b>twisting</b> around in an effort to gain the dominant position. A wrestling match ends when the pressure exerted forces them to separate, although bouts may be repeated one after the other. These bouts are typically observed just before the mating season. Those with greater strength and endurance are thought to win more often and enjoy greater reproductive success. Although the Gila monster has a low metabolism and one of the lowest lizard sprint speeds, it {{has one of the highest}} aerobic scope values (the increase in oxygen consumption from rest to maximum metabolic exertion) among lizards, allowing them to engage in intense aerobic activity for a sustained period of time. Males have been observed to have higher aerobic scopes than females, presumably because of sexual selection for a trait advantageous in prolonged combat. The Gila monster may live up to 20 years in the wild, or 30 in captivity.|$|E

5|$|The flavour {{has been}} {{described}} as nutty and slightly meaty, with a smooth, creamy texture, and a distinctive aroma reminiscent of sourdough. Young, small porcini are most appreciated by gourmets, as the large ones often harbour maggots (insect larvae), and become slimy, soft and less tasty with age. Fruit bodies are collected by holding the stipe near the base <b>and</b> <b>twisting</b> gently. Cutting the stipe with a knife may risk the part left behind rotting and the mycelium being destroyed. Peeling and washing are not recommended. The fruit bodies are highly perishable, due largely to the high water content (around 90%), the high level of enzyme activity, and the presence of a flora of microorganisms. Caution should be exercised when collecting specimens from potentially polluted or contaminated sites, as several {{studies have shown that the}} fruit bodies can bioaccumulate toxic heavy metals like mercury, cadmium, caesium and polonium. Bioaccumulated metals or radioactive fission decay products are like chemical signatures: chemical and radiochemical analysis can be used to identify the origin of imported specimens, and for long-term radioecological monitoring of polluted areas.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fall}} of 1957, Stompanato visited Turner in England, where she was filming Another Time, Another Place (1958), co-starring Sean Connery. In her autobiography, Turner said that she {{arranged}} for Stompanato's visit because she was lonely and having a difficult time filming. Their reunion was initially happy, but the two soon began fighting. Stompanato became suspicious when Turner would not allow him to visit the set and, during one fight, he choked her, causing her to miss three weeks of filming. Turner later wrote {{that she and her}} makeup man, Del Armstrong, called Scotland Yard in order to have Stompanato deported. Stompanato got wind of the plan and showed up on the set with a gun, threatening her and her co-star Sean Connery, whom he warned to keep away from Turner. Connery answered by grabbing the gun out of Stompanato's hand <b>and</b> <b>twisting</b> his wrist, causing him to run off the set sheepishly. Turner and Armstrong later returned with two Scotland Yard detectives to the rented house where she and Stompanato were staying. The detectives advised Stompanato to leave and escorted {{him out of the house}} and also to the airport, where he boarded a plane back to the United States.|$|E
25|$|The {{atoms in}} a CH2X2 group, {{commonly}} found in organic compounds and where X can represent any other atom, can vibrate in nine different ways. Six of these vibrations involve only the CH2 portion: symmetric and antisymmetric stretching, scissoring, rocking, wagging <b>and</b> <b>twisting,</b> as shown below. Structures {{that do not have}} the two additional X groups attached have fewer modes because some modes are defined by specific relationships to those other attached groups. For example, in water, the rocking, wagging, <b>and</b> <b>twisting</b> modes do not exist because these types of motions of the H represent simple rotation of the whole molecule rather than vibrations within it.|$|E

40|$|In the paper, yarn {{dynamical}} behavior <b>and</b> <b>twist</b> {{distribution in}} a modified ring spinning system are investigated. Equations of motion <b>and</b> <b>twist</b> wave propagation {{are used to}} obtain the numerical solutions of yarn path, yarn tension <b>and</b> <b>twist</b> distribution in steady state. It is observed that yarn path in the twisting zone has several classic modes corresponding to the yarn tension, {{and all of the}} yarn paths are approximately planar curves rather than spatial curves. The angular velocities of yarn at the twisting device are given as well as the twist of yarn in the modified ring spinning system. Experiments are conducted to evaluate the yarn paths <b>and</b> <b>twist</b> distributions under consideration. The theoretical and experimental results have a good agreement.

40|$|<b>Twist</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>Twist</b> 2 {{are highly}} conserved {{members of the}} Twist {{subfamily}} of bHLH proteins responsible for the transcriptional regulation of the developmental programs in mesenchymal cell lineages. The regulation of such processes requires that <b>Twist</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>Twist</b> 2 function as molecular switches to activate and repress target genes by employing several direct and indirect mechanisms. Modes of action by these proteins include direct DNA binding to conserved E-box sequences and recruitment of coactivators or repressors, sequestration of E-protein modulators, and interruption of proper activator/repressor function through protein–protein interactions. Regulatory outcomes of <b>Twist</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>Twist</b> 2 are themselves controlled by spatial-temporal expression, phosphoregulation, dimer choice and cellular localization. Although these two proteins are highly conserved and exhibit similar functions in vitro, emerging literature have demonstrated different roles in vivo. The involvement of <b>Twist</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>Twist</b> 2 in {{a broad spectrum of}} regulatory pathways highlights the importance of understanding their roles in normal development, homeostasis and disease.

25|$|In {{order for}} MSCs to {{differentiate}} into an ACL, {{they must be}} placed in a proper scaffold on which to grow, and must be in a bioreactor that maintains a normal physiological environment for the cells to reproduce and proliferate effectively. The scaffold must have the mechanical properties of a healthy ACL to sustain the ligament while it is in its primary form and maintain normal knee movement. Scaffolds that are used for ACL growth include collagen, silk, gelatin, polylactic acid, and glycosaminoglycans. Mechanical properties of the scaffolds are further enhanced through braiding <b>and</b> <b>twisting</b> of the scaffold materials.|$|E

25|$|As {{the range}} of {{permissible}} transformations becomes broader, {{the range of}} objects one is able to distinguish as preserved by {{the application of the}} transformations becomes narrower. Similarity transformations are fairly narrow (they preserve the relative distance between points) and thus allow us to distinguish relatively many things (e.g., equilateral triangles from non-equilateral triangles). Continuous transformations (which can intuitively be thought of as transformations which allow non-uniform stretching, compression, bending, <b>and</b> <b>twisting,</b> but no ripping or glueing) allow us to distinguish a polygon from an annulus (ring with a hole in the centre), but do not allow us to distinguish two polygons from each other.|$|E
