For example, zirconium is a primary component of the sorbent column dependent dialysate regeneration and recirculation system known as the REDY system, which was first introduced in 1973. More than 2,000,000 dialysis treatments have been performed using the sorbent column in the REDY system. Although the REDY system was superseded in the 1990s by less expensive alternatives, new sorbent-based dialysis systems are being evaluated and approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Renal Solutions developed the DIALISORB technology, a portable, low water dialysis system. Also, developmental versions of a Wearable <b>Artificial</b> <b>Kidney</b> have incorporated sorbent-based technologies.|$|E

However, on 19 February it was reported that he was [...] "sinking rapidly", with use of the <b>artificial</b> <b>kidney</b> machine developing into a [...] "vicious circle, gradually sapping his strength".

40|$|The {{effect of}} two {{commonly}} used sterilization methods for <b>artificial</b> <b>kidneys</b> on the morphology {{and performance of}} hollow fiber Hemophan® hemodialysis membranes was studied. A relatively new membrane characterization method, thermoporometry, {{was used to determine}} the pore size distributions and porosities of the differently treated membrane samples. The samples used for this study were not treated with a concentrated glycerol solution before sterilization. Hemophan was found to have a pore size distribution with pore radii between 1. 5 and 12 nm, the volume porosity was 20 %. The sample sterilized with ethylene oxide (EtO) had a volume porosity of 18 % which was due to a decrease of the pore volume of the smallest pores. The applied dry steam sterilization treatment resulted in a drastic collapse of the large pores while smaller pores were formed. The calculated porosity was only 10 %. The `tortuous capillary pore model¿ was used to predict the performance of the <b>artificial</b> <b>kidneys</b> from the pore size distribution in the membrane material. In vitro dialysis experiments with creatinine and vitamin B 12 were carried out to compare the calculated and measured clearance rates. Also the ultrafiltration capacity of the devices was determined. It was found that a reasonable estimation of the ultrafiltration capacity could be made. The calculated clearance rates were systematically underestimated, although the relative dependence of the clearance rates on the applied sterilization methods was approximated reasonably...|$|R
