5|$|After {{being hurt}} {{in a fall}} in his bathtub after {{slipping}} on a bar of soap, Miller was expected to withdraw <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> leadership hoped for a deal as late as May 15, the day Miller was to hold a press conference Ohio political observers thought he would use to announce his withdrawal. However, Miller stayed in the race and the two incumbents faced {{each other in the}} Republican primary on June 2, 1992.|$|E

5|$|By enfranchising racial minorities, the Act {{facilitated}} {{a political}} realignment of the Democratic and Republican parties. Between 1890 and 1965, minority disenfranchisement allowed conservative Southern Democrats to dominate Southern politics. After Democratic President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Act into law, newly enfranchised racial minorities began {{to vote for}} liberal Democratic candidates throughout the South, and Southern white conservatives began to switch their party registration from Democrat to Republican en masse. These dual trends caused the two parties to ideologically polarize, with the Democratic Party becoming more liberal <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> Party becoming more conservative. The trends also created competition between the two parties, which Republicans capitalized on by implementing the Southern strategy. Over the subsequent decades, the creation of majority-minority districts to remedy racial vote dilution claims also contributed to these developments. By packing liberal-leaning racial minorities into small numbers of majority-minority districts, large numbers of surrounding districts became more solidly white, conservative, and Republican. While this increased the elected representation of racial minorities as intended, it also decreased white Democratic representation and increased the representation of Republicans overall. By the mid-1990s, these trends culminated in a political realignment: the Democratic Party <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> Party became more ideologically polarized and defined as liberal and conservative parties, respectively; and both parties came to compete for electoral success in the South, with the Republican Party controlling most of Southern politics.|$|E
5|$|Hubert Humphrey brought {{national}} {{attention to the}} state with his address at the 1948 Democratic National Convention. Minnesotans have consistently cast their Electoral College votes for Democratic presidential candidates since 1976, longer than any other state. Minnesota {{is the only state}} in the nation that did not vote for Ronald Reagan in either of his presidential runs. Minnesota has gone to the Democratic Party in every presidential election since 1960, with the exception of 1972, when it was carried by Richard Nixon <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> Party.|$|E

5|$|In November 1997 McKevitt {{and other}} dissidents held {{a meeting in}} a {{farmhouse}} in Oldcastle, County Meath, and a new organisation, styling itself Óglaigh na hÉireann, was formed. The organisation attracted disaffected Provisional IRA members from Derry <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>republican</b> stronghold of South Armagh, as well as Dublin and Belfast cities and Counties Limerick, Tipperary, Louth, Tyrone, Monaghan and Kerry.|$|E
5|$|Most non-Republican Guard armored units had older tank designs, {{mainly the}} T-55 or its Chinese equivalents, the Type 59 and Type 69. The {{remaining}} 34 divisions were composed of poorly trained conscripts. These divisions were deployed to channel the Coalition's forces {{through a number}} of break points along the front, allowing the Iraqi Army's heavy divisions <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> Guard units to isolate them and counterattack. However, the Iraqis left their western flank open, failing to account for tactics made possible by the Global Positioning System and other new technologies.|$|E
5|$|On September 11, 2001, Lynch won the Democratic primary with 39% of the vote, 10 {{points ahead}} of Jacques, who ranked second with 29% of the vote. The same day, the September 11 attacks took place, which {{dampened}} the ensuing general election campaign between Lynch <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> nominee, state Senator Jo Ann Sprague. As both sides turned to similar themes of patriotism and defense, Lynch {{benefited from the}} demographics of his district. On October 16, he defeated Sprague 65%-33%.|$|E

5|$|The Confederacy lacked reinforcements, so Lee's army shrank {{with every}} costly battle. Grant's army moved south, crossed the James River, forcing a siege and trench warfare outside Petersburg, Virginia. Lincoln then made an {{extended}} visit to Grant's headquarters at City Point, Virginia. This allowed {{the president to}} confer in person with Grant and William Tecumseh Sherman about the hostilities, as Sherman coincidentally managed a hasty visit to Grant from his position in North Carolina. Lincoln <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> Party mobilized support for the draft throughout the North, and replaced the Union losses.|$|E
5|$|The United States has {{operated}} under a two-party system {{for most of}} its history. For elective offices at most levels, state-administered primary elections choose the major party nominees for subsequent general elections. Since the general election of 1856, the major parties have been the Democratic Party, founded in 1824, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> Party, founded in 1854. Since the Civil War, only one third-party presidential candidate—former president Theodore Roosevelt, running as a Progressive in 1912—has won as much as 20% of the popular vote. The President and Vice-president are elected through the Electoral College system.|$|E
5|$|Despite republicanism in Greece, Olga {{was still}} held in high esteem <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>republican</b> {{government}} in Athens {{offered to pay}} for her funeral and repatriate her remains to Greece. Nonetheless, her children declined the offer, preferring to bury her in Italy beside her son, Constantine I, whose body Greece had refused to accept. Her funeral was held on 22 June 1926 at the Orthodox Church in Rome and the next day she was laid to rest in the crypt of the Russian church in Florence. After the restoration of the Greek monarchy in 1935 she was re-interred at Tatoi on 17 November 1936.|$|E

5|$|During the 1860s and the American Civil War, the {{legislature}} {{was the scene}} of intense debate. At the beginning of the war, the General Assembly was controlled by the southern sympathetic Democrats. Governor Oliver Morton <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> minority were able to prevent the General Assembly from meeting in 1862 and 1863 by denying the body quorum. Morton even had some members of the body arrested or detained on suspicions of disloyalty. The lack of funding created by this crisis again led to the near bankruptcy of the state. In 1864, the Republicans gained a majority and convened the General Assembly to remedy the state's funding problems.|$|E
5|$|In 1878 Long unsuccessfully {{challenged}} the incumbent Rice for the gubernatorial nomination. When Rice {{announced his retirement}} the following year, Long again sought the nomination. It went to former Lieutenant Governor Thomas Talbot, but Long won the lieutenant governor nomination by acclamation. The Democratic opposition was divided by Benjamin Butler's return to that party, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> ticket won the general election. Long capitalized on Talbot's avoidance of public ceremonies to maintain a high profile despite his post's relative unimportance. He was easily nominated for governor when Talbot announced he would not run for reelection, {{despite a lack of}} support from the party leadership. The election was highly divisive, pitting Long against Butler and the divided Democrats. Long was criticized for his lack of Civil War service and attacked for his diversions from the party line, but won a comfortable victory. He was reelected by comfortable margins the two following years.|$|E
5|$|In late 1971, John Dean, the White House Counsel, {{pushed to}} expand the {{existing}} intelligence program ahead of the 1972 re-election campaign. Dean delegated the task to Jack Caulfield, {{a member of his}} staff who was a former New York police officer. According to Dean, Caulfield himself was interested in work outside of politics; he intended to create a private security company, and felt that if the Nixon cabinet were an early client, it would lead to lucrative future clients within the private sector. Fred Emery, a journalist for The Times and BBC, refutes this, claiming in his book Watergate: The Corruption & Fall of Richard Nixon that the idea of a private sector security firm was simply a front for a committed campaign of surveillance working Nixon <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> Party, with political donations to the re-election campaign able to be diverted through the company as though they were unrelated transactions.|$|E

50|$|The 1994 South Carolina United States House of Representatives {{elections}} were held on November 8, 1994, to select six Representatives for two-year terms {{from the state}} of South Carolina. The primary elections for <b>the</b> Democrats <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> were held on August 9 <b>and</b> <b>the</b> runoff {{elections were}} held two weeks later on August 23. All four incumbents who ran were re-elected <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> won both of the open seats in the 1st congressional district <b>and</b> <b>the</b> 3rd congressional district. The composition of the state delegation after the elections was four Republicans and two Democrats.|$|R
5|$|Pittsburgh was a Republican stronghold {{starting}} in the 1880s, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> governments provided jobs and assistance for the new immigrants {{in return for their}} votes. But the Great Depression {{starting in}} 1929 ruined the GOP in the city. The Democratic victory of 1932 meant an end to Republican patronage jobs and assistance. As the Depression worsened, Pittsburgh ethnics voted heavily for the Democrats, especially in 1934, making the city a stronghold of the New Deal Coalition. By 1936, Democratic programs for relief and jobs, especially the WPA, were so popular with the ethnics that a large majority voted for the Democrats.|$|E
5|$|Randall {{believed}} he had been betrayed by many he had thought would support him, but carried on regardless {{in support of his}} party's nominee. Hancock (who remained on active duty) <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> nominee, James A. Garfield, did not campaign directly, in keeping with the customs of that time, but campaigns were conducted by other party members, including Randall. Speaking in Pennsylvania and around the Midwest, Randall did his best to rally the people to Hancock against Garfield, but without success. Garfield was elected with 214 electoral votes—including those of Pennsylvania. Worse still for Randall, Garfield's victory had swept the Republicans back into a majority in the House, meaning Randall's time as Speaker was at an end.|$|E
