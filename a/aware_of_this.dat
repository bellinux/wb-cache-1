5|$|Although the U.S. {{command in}} Saigon and the {{politicians}} in Washington became increasingly <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> arrangement during 19661967, they declined to overtly interfere due to the political ramifications of conducting military operations against a neutral country and the wishes of Sihanouk. Washington still had hopes of reopening a dialog with Sihanouk, and refrained from any actions that might alienate him further.|$|E
5|$|In 1942, {{fighting}} with the Partisans intensified. Not only had they liberated a substantial territory {{in the eastern part}} of Yugoslavia, but they encouraged rebellion all over the country. The German, Italian and NDH governments were <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> danger and they used every means available to destroy the Partisan forces. They planned several large-scale operations for this purpose in which air support played a very important role.|$|E

5|$|The {{limitation}} of the argument so far is that it only shows {{the existence of a}} necessary existent, and that is different from showing the existence of God as worshipped in Islam. An atheist might agree that a necessary existent exists, but it could be the universe itself, or there could be many necessary existents, none of which is God. Avicenna is <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> limitation, and his works contains numerous arguments to show the necessary existent must have the attributes associated with God identified in Islam.|$|E
5|$|With {{some people}} unable {{to believe that}} the Japanese would be so ruthless, rumours began to spread almost {{immediately}} after news of the attack was made public. The most common rumour was that Centaur had been carrying munitions or commandos {{at the time of her}} sinking, with the Japanese made <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> prior to her departure. This stemmed from an incident involving the ambulance drivers' weapons during loading in Sydney.|$|E

5|$|By mid-1943, {{following}} {{the capture of}} southern Italy, Allied aircraft started to appear over the Balkans. NDH military command was <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> danger {{and was trying to}} persuade the Germans to provide at least two squadrons of Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighters to the ZNDH. However, instead of Bf 109s, the only reinforcement fighters that came from Germany were the first of a batch of 36 overhauled captured French Morane-Saulnier M.S.406 fighters in October, plus another dozen which arrived in December. The Germans also supplied 25 Beneš-Mráz Beta-Minor sporting two seater monoplanes, which were dispatched between the squadrons for liaison duty, as the lack of radio communications equipment at squadron level was still evident.|$|E

The academic Jeremy Black points to the 1951 defections of two members of MI6—Guy Burgess and Donald Maclean—to the Soviet Union as having a major impact on how Britain was poorly viewed in US intelligence circles; Fleming was <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> tension between the two countries, but he did not focus on it too strongly, and Bond and Leiter's warm relationship did not reflect the reality of the US-UK relationship.|$|E

Bokassa left the French army to join the Central African Republic army in 1962. By 1965, the country was in turmoil—plagued by corruption and slow economic growth, while its borders were breached by rebels from neighboring countries. Dacko obtained financial aid from the People's Republic of China, {{but in spite of}} this support, the country's problems persisted. Bokassa, now commander-in-chief of the army, made plans to take over the government; Dacko became <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>this,</b> and countered by forming a gendarmerie headed by police chief Jean Izamo, who quickly became Dacko's closest adviser.|$|E

5|$|Tactically, {{the pass}} at Thermopylae was {{ideally suited to}} the Greek style of warfare. A hoplite phalanx could block the narrow pass with ease, with no risk of being outflanked by cavalry. Moreover, in the pass, the phalanx {{would have been very}} {{difficult}} to assault for the more lightly armed Persian infantry. The major weak point for the Greeks was the mountain track which led across the highland parallel to Thermopylae, that could allow their position to be outflanked. Although probably unsuitable for cavalry, this path could easily be traversed by the Persian infantry (many of whom were versed in mountain warfare). Leonidas was made <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> path by local people from Trachis, and he positioned a detachment of Phocian troops there in order to block this route.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} textual {{reference to}} the hoodening tradition comes from {{the first half of}} the eighteenth century. A number of scattered references to it appeared over the next century and a half, many of which considered it to be a declining tradition that had become extinct in many parts of Kent. <b>Aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> decline, in the early twentieth century the folklorist and historian Percy Maylam documented what survived of the tradition and traced its appearances in historical documents, publishing his findings as The Hooden Horse in 1909. Although deemed extinct at the time of the First World War, the custom was revived in an altered form during the mid-twentieth century, when the use of the hooden horse was incorporated into a number of modern Kentish folk traditions.|$|E
5|$|After a brief {{return to}} Versailles, Eliza joins Elizabeth Charlotte of the Palatinate at her estate before the {{invasion}} of the Palatinate in her name. Eliza informs William of Orange of the troop movements caused by the French invasion which frees his forces along the border of the Spanish Netherlands, a region of stalemate between France and the Dutch Republic. During her flight from the Electorate of the Palatinate, Eliza becomes pregnant by Louis's cryptographer, though popular knowledge suggested it was the French nobleman Etienne D'Arcachon's child. Meanwhile, William takes the free troops from the border on the Spanish Netherlands to England, precipitating the Glorious Revolution, including the expulsion of JamesII. James flees London and Daniel Waterhouse soon encounters him in a bar. Convinced that the Stuart monarchy has collapsed, Daniel returns to London and takes revenge on Jeffreys by inciting a crowd to capture him for trial and later execution. Though he plans to depart for Massachusetts, Daniel's case of bladder stones increasingly worsens during this period. The Royal Society and other family friends are very <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> and force Daniel to get the stone removed by Robert Hooke at Bedlam.|$|E

5|$|Bajkam, having {{consolidated}} {{his control}} over Baghdad, now {{turned to face}} the threat posed by the Buyids. To this end, he strengthened his ties with the Baridis of Basra, by handing over Wasit, as previously agreed, appointing Abu Abdallah al-Baridi as vizier of the Abbasid court (although the latter remained at Wasit and did not visit Baghdad), and, finally, by marrying himself to one of al-Baridi's daughters. Bajkam's success against the Buyids was mixed: Wasit was saved from Buyid attack, and the Baridis led a successful campaign in Susiana, but an expedition into Jibal was crushed by the third Buyid brother, Hasan. The alliance with the Baridis quickly soured, however, as al-Baridi still maintained his ambition of replacing Bajkam, and ajkam was <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>this.</b> In late August 940, Bajkam removed al-Baridi from the vizierate and launched an attack on Wasit, which the Baridis abandoned without resistance. In the meantime, the Baghdad was in turmoil as religious violence had become commonplace, with fanatical members of the Hanbali school imposing their tenets on the general populace.|$|E
5|$|Based {{around the}} {{overflow}} of volunteers for the 1st Rhodesia Regiment, {{a core of}} personnel for a second Southern Rhodesian expeditionary unit was in place by November 1914. This was made into the 2nd Rhodesia Regiment (2RR) during December 1914 and January 1915. The 1st Rhodesia Regiment's lack of combat experience thus far influenced those men in Southern Rhodesia who were yet to enlist; many Rhodesian colonials were keen to fight on the front lines, and some resolved {{that they might have}} to travel to Europe to be sure of doing so. <b>Aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> competition with the Western Front for the colony's manpower, recruiters for the 2nd Rhodesia Regiment took great care to assure potential inductees that they would definitely see combat, in Africa, if they signed up for the new unit. The 2nd Rhodesia Regiment ultimately had a paper strength of 500 men, the same as the 1st. Thirty black scouts, recruited in Southern Rhodesia, were also attached to the regiment.|$|E
5|$|Born in Panama City to a poor mestizo family, Noriega {{studied at}} the Chorrillos Military School in Lima and at the School of the Americas. He became {{an officer in the}} Panamanian army, and rose through the ranks in {{alliance}} with Omar Torrijos. In 1968, Torrijos overthrew President Arnulfo Arias in a coup, establishing himself as leader; under Torrijos' government, Noriega became chief of military intelligence. After Torrijos' death in 1981, Noriega consolidated his power to become Panama's de facto ruler in 1983. From the 1950s until shortly before the U.S. invasion, Noriega worked with U.S. intelligence agencies. Noriega was one of the Central Intelligence Agency's most valued intelligence sources, as well as one of the primary conduits for illicit weapons, military equipment and cash destined for U.S.-backed counter-insurgency forces throughout Latin America. The U.S. also regarded Noriega as an ally in its War on Drugs, despite Noriega himself having amassed a personal fortune through drug trafficking operations. Though his U.S. intelligence handlers were <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>this,</b> it was allowed because of his usefulness to the U.S.|$|E
