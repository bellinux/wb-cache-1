40|$|The control-value theory (CVT) {{proposes that}} <b>achievement</b> {{emotions}} and academic <b>achievement</b> show reciprocal effects over time. Previous {{studies have examined}} how <b>achievement</b> emotions predict subsequent <b>achievement.</b> However, evidence is limited for whether <b>achievement</b> can also predict <b>achievement</b> emotions. To examine these reciprocal relations, data were collected about two <b>achievement</b> emotions: enjoyment and boredom, and mathematics <b>achievement</b> over four waves in a single school year in primary school students in Years 5 and 6. Results from structural equation modeling supported reciprocal relations between emotions and <b>achievement.</b> Higher enjoyment and lower boredom predicted greater subsequent <b>achievement</b> and, in turn, greater academic <b>achievement</b> predicted subsequent greater enjoyment and lower boredom. Furthermore, the relations between emotions over time were mediated by <b>achievement.</b> These findings build on the evidence base for CVT and further understanding of relations between <b>achievement</b> emotions and academic <b>achievement</b> in younger students. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R

The learning models compared were Problem Based Learning model with scientific approach (PBL-S), Think Pair Share with scientific approach (TPS-S) and classical with scientific approach (Classical -S). The type of {{the research}} was a quasi experimental research with the factorial design of 3 x 3. The population were all ten grade students of Senior High School in Madiun City on academic year 2014 / 2015. The sample consisted of students of SMAN 1 Madiun, SMAN 5 Madiun, and SMAN 4 Madiun, which taken by using stratified cluster random sampling technique. The data of the research were collected through documentation, questionnaire, and test. The data was analyzed using unbalanced two-ways anova at the significance level of 0. 05. Based on the data analysis, it can be concluded as follows. (1) PBL-S gives better mathematics <b>achievement</b> than TPS-S and Classical-S, whereas TPS-S gives better mathematics learning <b>achievement</b> than Classical-S. (2) Students with high Learning <b>Achievement</b> Motivation are better in mathematics learning <b>achievement</b> than students with medium and low Learning <b>Achievement</b> Motivation, and also medium Learning <b>Achievement</b> Motivation have better mathematics learning <b>achievement</b> than low Learning <b>Achievement</b> Motivation. (3) For PBL-S, students with high Learning <b>Achievement</b> Motivation give better mathematics learning <b>achievement</b> than medium and low Learning <b>Achievement</b> Motivation, whereas students with medium and low Learning <b>Achievement</b> Motivation have the same mathematics learning <b>achievement.</b> For TPS-S with medium Learning <b>Achievement</b> Motivation gives the same mathematics learning <b>achievement</b> with high and low Learning <b>Achievement</b> Motivation, also high Learning <b>Achievement</b> Motivation gives better mathematics learning <b>achievement</b> than low Learning <b>Achievement</b> Motivation.

40|$|BackgroundThe {{hierarchical}} model of <b>achievement</b> motivation presumes that <b>achievement</b> goals channel the <b>achievement</b> motives of need for <b>achievement</b> {{and fear of}} failure towards motivational outcomes. Yet, less is known whether autonomous and controlling reasons underlying the pursuit of <b>achievement</b> goals can serve as additional pathways between <b>achievement</b> motives and outcomes. AimsWe tested whether mastery approach, performance approach, and performance avoidance goals and their underlying autonomous and controlling reasons would jointly explain the relation between <b>achievement</b> motives (i. e., fear of failure and need for <b>achievement)</b> and learning strategies (Study 1). Additionally, we examined whether the autonomous and controlling reasons underlying learners' dominant <b>achievement</b> goal would account for the link between <b>achievement</b> motives and the educational outcomes of learning strategies and cheating (Study 2). SampleSix hundred and six Greek adolescent students (M-age= 15. 05, SD= 1. 43) and 435 university students (MageM= 20. 51, SD= 2. 80) participated in studies 1 and 2, respectively. MethodIn both studies, a correlational design was used and the hypotheses were tested via path modelling. ResultsAutonomous and controlling reasons underlying the pursuit of <b>achievement</b> goals mediated, respectively, the relation of need for <b>achievement</b> and fear of failure to aspects of learning outcomes. ConclusionAutonomous and controlling reasons underlying <b>achievement</b> goals could further explain learners' functioning in <b>achievement</b> settings...|$|R
