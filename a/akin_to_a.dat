The Amsterdam Treaty had {{increased}} the Commission's powers and Prodi was dubbed {{by the press}} as something <b>akin</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> Prime Minister. Powers were strengthened again with the Nice Treaty in 2001 giving the Presidents more power over the composition of their Commissions.|$|E

5|$|Chocolina was {{originally}} {{meant to be}} a waitress in Serendipity, but her design impressed Toriyama enough that he expanded her role into something <b>akin</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> shop clerk, and the director wrote a new backstory and new dialogue for her. Isamu Kamikokuryo said that though Chocolina's jovial manner and scanty outfit at times clashed with the game's overall atmosphere, he felt she was a good inclusion. Chocolina is voiced by Julie Nathanson in English and Seiko Ueda in Japanese.|$|E

5|$|Jones had {{previously}} developed a gruesome game called Go to Hell. In an interview Jones {{stated that he}} developed the game for his own amusement; he enjoyed the reactions people gave to the game. The original, pre-release, version of the game featured more grisly images. Reviewers praised the game's graphics but had mixed feeling about the scenes actually depicted by the graphics. Some reviewers criticized the game's gameplay as repetitive but praised as being fun and <b>akin</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> horror movie by others.|$|E
5|$|Pied currawongs are vocal birds, calling when {{in flight}} and at all times of the day. They are more noisy {{early in the morning}} and in the evening before roosting, as well as before rain. The loud {{distinctive}} call has been translated as Kadow-Kadang or Curra-wong, <b>akin</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> croak. They also have a loud, high-pitched, wolf-like whistle, transcribed as Wheeo. The endemic Lord Howe Island subspecies has a distinct, more melodious call.|$|E
5|$|The {{shedding}} {{of scales}} is called ecdysis, or, in normal usage moulting or sloughing. In {{the case of}} snakes, the complete outer layer of skin is shed in one layer. Snake scales are not discrete but extensions of the epidermis hence they are not shed separately, but are ejected as a complete contiguous outer layer of skin during each moult, <b>akin</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> sock being turned inside out.|$|E

5|$|Combat in Mass Effect 2 is squad-based and {{a maximum}} of two squad members may {{accompany}} the player on the battlefield. The player has direct control of Shepard while the squad members are controlled by the game's artificial intelligence. Battles take place in real-time, but the player can pause the action at any time to calmly target enemies and select different powers for the squad members to use. The game uses an over the shoulder perspective <b>akin</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> third-person shooter, and places strong emphasis on using cover to avoid taking damage while fighting enemy forces. The player may also issue commands to the squad members, such as sending them to take cover behind a manually picked object or focus their fire on a designed target.|$|E
5|$|Early Mormons {{understood}} the Book of Mormon to be a religious {{history of the}} indigenous peoples of the Americas. Smith's followers {{view it as a}} companion to the Bible and an additional witness of Christ, <b>akin</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> large apocryphal work. Modern historian Fawn Brodie has called the Book of Mormon a response to pressing cultural and environmental issues of Smith's times, saying that Smith composed the Book of Mormon drawing from scraps of information available to him. Dan Vogel, another historian, says that the work is autobiographical in nature.|$|E
5|$|Gummi Ships {{are another}} common {{element of the}} series, which serve as the main mode of {{transportation}} between worlds in the games. The gameplay for the Gummi Ship sections is more <b>akin</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> rail shooter. Because it received negative criticism in the first game, it was modified in the third title. Most games also feature a journal which is accessible from the main menu. This journal keeps track of information regarding the story, characters, enemies, and locations. In the first three games, the journal is kept by Jiminy Cricket, who was appointed by Queen Minnie as the royal chronicler. In 358/2 Days, Birth by Sleep and Dream Drop Distance, the main characters write their own journal entries.|$|E

5|$|In this, the milieu is {{interested}} in developing unified world views to discover {{the nature of the}} divine and establish a scientific basis for religious belief. Figures in the New Age movement—most notably Fritjof Capra in his The Tao of Physics (1975)—have drawn parallels between theories in the New Physics and traditional forms of mysticism, thus arguing that ancient religious ideas are now being proven by contemporary science. Many New Agers have adopted James Lovelock's Gaia hypothesis that the Earth acts <b>akin</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> single living organism, although have expanded this idea to include the idea that the Earth has consciousness and intelligence.|$|E
5|$|Natural predators of the California {{spiny lobster}} include bony fish {{such as the}} California sheephead, giant sea bass and cabezone, sharks {{including}} the horn shark and leopard shark, octopuses and sea otters. In response to an approaching predator, spiny lobsters including the California spiny lobster can produce a loud noise using the stick-slip phenomenon, <b>akin</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> bowed instrument. The bases of the antennae act as a plectrum, which is rubbed over a file {{on the edge of}} the antennular plate. If a predator is very close, spiny lobsters will flex their muscular tail in order to escape the predator, backwards.|$|E
5|$|The Guimarota {{locality}} {{is located}} in the eastern Lusitanian Basin, {{which is part of the}} Iberian Meseta. The vertebrate-bearing Guimarota-strata was deposited in a brackish lagoon that periodically received both freshwater and saltwater influxes. Ecologically, the environment would have been <b>akin</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> modern mangrove swamp. Plants known from megafossils include the horsetails Equisetum and Schizoneura; the seed fern Caytonia; the cycad Otozamites; the araucaria Brachyphyllum; Ginkgo; and the charophyte algae Porochara. Additionally, plant families known only from pollen include lycopods, forked ferns, possible scaly tree ferns (which may be matoniaceans or dicksoniaceans instead), royal ferns, the seed fern Sphenopteris, cypresses, and pines. Most of the preserved organisms probably originated from around the swamp, although there may have been minimal transportation by water currents.|$|E

5|$|The most {{distinctive}} {{voice of the}} curve-billed is an abrupt and brash whit-wheet, which sounds <b>akin</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> person whistling to get one's attention. It is usually uttered from high perches. The songs are {{similar to that of}} the northern mockingbird but notes do not end as abruptly; its voice is regarded as more pleasant. The curve-billed can utter songs consecutively two or three times, the length spanning from 2 to 15 seconds. Some phrases are nasal and buzzy; its large vocabulary enables it to conjure successive songs that are usually different from one another.|$|E
5|$|A {{cold front}} was located {{north of the}} Bahamas on August26, with a broad area of {{cyclonic}} turning located east of northern Florida. Atmospheric pressures were falling in the region, and gale force winds were recorded by 12:00UTC on August27. Based on the structure, {{it is estimated that}} the frontal low developed into a tropical storm by 18:00UTC that day. Ship reports in the region suggested peak winds of 50mph (85km/h). There was very dry air {{on the west side of}} the system, unusual for August, and the radius of maximum winds was around 115mi (185km), suggesting that the structure could have been <b>akin</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> subtropical cyclone. The storm continued to the northwest, making landfall very near Myrtle Beach, South Carolina at 02:00UTC on August28. It spread rainfall across the Carolinas, later enhanced by Hurricane Able just days later, while cities reported winds of around 35mph (55km/h). The storm weakened over land and dissipated late on August28 over eastern Kentucky.|$|E
5|$|Aqil {{secured a}} durable {{alliance}} with the Beni Sakhr, consecrated through his marriage to a woman from the tribe. From Transjordan, he and his band of irregulars raided areas {{on both sides of}} the Jordan River until he was invited back to the Galilee by Acre's kaimakam in 1847. The latter had sought to neutralize Aqil and his allies' marauding activities, and thus pardoned Aqil. He was also given command of 75 bashi-bazouk in Lower Galilee. Thereafter, he was commissioned with overseeing that region's security. In particular, the successive governors of Acre entrusted him with protecting the Galilee's trade routes and maintaining general security in the area, which he did successfully. With time, he became an unofficial mutasallim (tax collector) for much of northern Palestine, including the Jezreel Valley, Safad, Tiberias and Nazareth. The tax he collected was not on behalf of the authorities, but rather a tribute payment (khuwwa) to receive his protection. While this unofficial system proved successful in guaranteeing local security, later historians criticized it as <b>akin</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> protection racket.|$|E

5|$|Disney's {{plans for}} the futuristic city of EPCOT {{did not come to}} fruition. After Disney's death, his brother Roy {{deferred}} his retirement to take full control of the Disney companies. He changed the focus of the project from a town to an attraction. At the inauguration in 1971, Roy dedicated Walt Disney World to his brother. Walt Disney World expanded with the opening of Epcot Center in 1982; Walt Disney's vision of a functional city was replaced by a park more <b>akin</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> permanent world's fair. In 2009, the Walt Disney Family Museum, designed by Disney's daughter Diane and her son Walter E. D. Miller, opened in the Presidio of San Francisco. Thousands of artifacts from Disney's life and career are on display, including numerous awards that he received. In 2014, the Disney theme parks around the world hosted approximately 134 million visitors.|$|E
5|$|Employing the Sub Intelligent Numbers Selector {{theory that}} {{assigned}} non-descript unit names and randomized numerical designations to formations {{in order to}} disguise their role from the enemy, the company was designated the 8213th Army Unit. Upon formation, {{it was decided that}} the company would be considered an ad hoc, or provisional unit, which meant it did not have a permanent lineage and was only a temporary formation, <b>akin</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> task force. This decision was unique to the Eighth Army Ranger Company, as subsequent companies assumed the lineage of Ranger units from World War II, and veterans later expressed resentment with the choice as it prevented the company from accruing its own campaign streamers or unit decorations. While subsequent Ranger companies were authorized shoulder sleeve insignia with the distinctive black and red scroll of their World War II predecessors, the Eighth Army Ranger Company wore the shoulder patch of the Eighth United States Army, which commanded all UN troops in Korea.|$|E
5|$|Modern Warfare Remastered builds {{upon the}} {{original}} by featuring extensive graphical and rendering enhancements, lighting upgrades, updated animations, remastering original sound effects {{as well as}} adding new, and offers numerous small improvements while retaining the original core gameplay. Extras such as new multiplayer content and additional achievements and cheats are also included. The game received positive reviews from critics, who lauded the improved graphics, sound, and range of amendments from the original game, {{to the point that}} some found it more <b>akin</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> remake. Criticism focused on its dated narrative and AI, with split opinions given to aspects that were seen as both dated and refreshingly simplistic. Activision also generated controversy for not initially releasing Remastered as a standalone game, among other criticized business decisions centered around additional content.|$|E
