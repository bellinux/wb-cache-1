500|$|Filming began {{during the}} second week of August 1967. Three {{temporary}} sets and a portion of corridor were constructed for specific use in this episode, which included the large trading post set. The chairs in that set were a problem, as the set designers wanted 24 matching chairs and decided that folding ones would not do. John M. Dwyer sourced them from a local company, but the numbers required meant that they had to be pulled out of showrooms from all over the county. When it came to the fight scene in the episode, Dwyer warned director Joseph Pevney not to damage the chairs. That scene was filmed twice after a cameraman with a handheld camera wandered onto the set. The scene where Kirk is covered with tribbles in the grain container needed to be filmed eight times, using all five hundred sewn tribbles. Gerrold had expected that scene to be cut at some point during production, as he thought that William Shatner would not agree to it. He said that Shatner was the [...] "consummate professional <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>he</b> was eager to show off his comic abilities".|$|E
2500|$|In a 1995 interview, Wallace {{said that}} he planned to vote for Republican Bob Dole in the 1996 presidential election, commenting, [...] "He's a good man. His wife is a born-again Christian woman <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>he</b> is too." [...] He also {{revealed}} that he had voted for George H. W. Bush, another Republican, in 1992. His son, George Wallace Jr., officially switched from the Democratic to the Republican Party that same year. Wallace himself declined to officially identify as either a Republican or a Democrat. But he added, [...] "The state is slowly going Republican because of Clinton being so liberal." ...|$|E
2500|$|As Governor of Massachusetts, Romney {{supported}} {{the teaching of}} evolution, and opposed the teaching of intelligent design, in public school science classes, stating so in December 2005 during his term, and then in May 2007 – shortly after his term concluded – saying, [...] "In my opinion, the science class is where to teach evolution, or if there are other scientific thoughts {{that need to be}} discussed. If we’re going to talk about more philosophical matters, like why it was created, and was there an intelligent designer behind it, that’s for the religion class or philosophy class or social studies class." [...] Romney expressed his own views in May 2007 by saying, [...] "I believe that God designed the universe and created the universe. And I believe evolution is most likely the process he used to create the human body. ... I’m not exactly sure what is meant by intelligent design. But I believe God is intelligent <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>he</b> designed the creation. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>he</b> used the process of evolution to create the human body." [...] He said that when faculty members interviewing him for an honors designation asked for his beliefs on the subject before his 1971 graduation from Brigham Young University, he told them that there was [...] " [...] between true science and true religion". [...] At a May 2007 Republican Party presidential debate, Romney was not one of several candidates that raised their hands to indicate they did not accept evolution.|$|E

6000|$|... "Don't care if he's {{captain of}} twenty ships," [...] said Miss Roxy, obdurately; [...] "he ain't a {{professor}} of religion, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>he's</b> an infidel, <b>and</b> she's one of the Lord's people." ...|$|R

2500|$|Testifying {{before the}} Iraq Inquiry on 29 January 2010, Blair said Saddam was a [...] "monster <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>he</b> {{threatened}} {{not just the}} region but the world." [...] Blair said that British and American attitude towards Saddam Hussein had [...] "changed dramatically" [...] after the 11 September attacks. Blair denied {{that he would have}} supported the invasion of Iraq even if he had thought Saddam had no weapons of mass destruction. He said he believed the world was safer {{as a result of the}} invasion. He said there was [...] "no real difference between wanting regime change and wanting Iraq to disarm: regime change was US policy because Iraq was in breach of its UN obligations." [...] In an October 2015 CNN interview with Fareed Zakaria, Blair apologised for his [...] "mistakes" [...] over Iraq War and admitted there were [...] "elements of truth" [...] to the view that the invasion helped promote the rise of ISIS. The Chilcot Inquiry report of 2016 gave a damning assessment of Blair's role in the Iraq War, though the former prime minister again refused to apologise for his decision to back the US-led invasion.|$|E

6000|$|... "I daresay his bark {{is worse}} than his bite," [...] said the visitor, trembling; [...] "anyway, I’m going to stay here. I saw Mr. Robinson come here, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>he’s</b> got him in there. Killing him, perhaps. Oh! Oh!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She had, I think, a bundle, though I couldn't {{see very}} well," [...] said a female voice from another window, which seemed that of Maryann. [...] "But {{she had no}} young man about here. Hers lives in Casterbridge, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>he's</b> a soldier." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "It {{may sound}} strange," [...] he continued, [...] "but I assure you it's {{not a bad}} speculation.

6000|$|Alert, kindly, cordial, Mark {{greeted me}} {{and taking a}} seat, fixed his keen blue, kindly eyes upon me.

6000|$|... "I don't believe it," [...] came firmly {{from the}} former major of the school battalion. [...] "I believe he took them; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>he</b> took the other things, too!" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "They're {{bound to}} talk about the Baxter failure and criticize Lige," [...] she deplored to Mrs. Jonas. [...] "And it riles Sara up so terrible. She used to declare that she hated Lige, and now she won't listen to a word against him. Not that I say any, myself. I'm sorry for him, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>he's</b> done his best. But I can't stop other people from talking." ...|$|R

60|$|On the 19th {{there was}} {{constant}} skirmishing {{with the enemy}} while we were getting into better position. The enemy had been much demoralized by his defeats at Champion's Hill and the Big Black, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>believed</b> <b>he</b> would not make much effort to hold Vicksburg. Accordingly, at two o'clock I ordered an assault. It resulted in securing more advanced positions for all our troops where they were fully covered from the fire of the enemy.|$|R
6000|$|... "But," [...] he said, [...] "the boy's {{head was}} quite turned {{by the beauty}} of the country. He had been raving all day about the new poet, Alfred Tennyson, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>he</b> thought he had walked into lotus-land." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'Will {{you go to}} him?' he {{presently}} added. 'Perhaps I grew too {{angry at}} last, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>he</b> loves you. At least, if he does not, he must be more unfeeling than I can think him. You do not dislike it, dearest.' ...|$|E

5000|$|... “We {{had a small}} {{problem that}} we didn't know whether Jarda Jágr would go fifth or Vláďa Růžička would go fifth but then, I would say, a respect overpoised because when Vláďa Růžička {{said he wanted to}} go fifth, then Džegr said he would go fourth. Patýs was a bit {{surprised}} when we democratically elected him to go because he hadn't played at the end <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>believed</b> <b>he</b> can score with a techniques somewhat.” - About a penalty shooting against Canada at Nagano Olympics.|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{like him}} very much," [...] the Major said shortly; [...] "he is great friends with Dr. Wade, {{who has the}} very highest opinion of him, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>he</b> is {{generally}} considered {{to be one of the}} most rising young officers of his grade." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I was passing," [...] {{said the}} general, [...] "and I thought I would {{stop for a}} chat. By the way, how is the search for Lieutenant Smith-Oldwick progressing?
