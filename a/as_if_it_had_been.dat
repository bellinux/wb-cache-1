5|$|Aghartas 1976 North American release had {{different}} artwork designed by John Berg, the art director from Davis' U.S. label, Columbia Records. In its liner notes, an inscription said the record should be listened {{to at the}} highest possible volume, and the trumpeter was credited for the arrangements. After it was released, Macero received a complaint from Columbia's accounting department about Davis being compensated $2,500 per arrangement, arguing {{that none of the}} music sounded <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> arranged.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{advantages}} of linezolid is its high bioavailability (close to 100%) when given by mouth: the entire dose reaches the bloodstream, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> given intravenously. This means that people receiving intravenous linezolid may be switched to oral linezolid as soon as their condition allows it, whereas comparable antibiotics (such as vancomycin and quinupristin/dalfopristin) can only be given intravenously.|$|E
5|$|The {{desalination}} plant {{was impossible to}} hide, and since it had been built by the Italians, the enemy knew exactly where and what it was. Proud and Murray Dixon therefore disguised the plant to look <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> destroyed by a bomb. A trompe l'oeil black hole was painted {{over the top and}} one side of the building, along with shrapnel marks, shortly after a real attack which fortunately missed the plant; a disused chimney was actually demolished; real rubble, empty oil drums and real wrecked vehicles, which were in plentiful supply, were brought to decorate the compound; and some fake craters were constructed and decorated as if a stick of bombs had fallen right on target. The finishing touch was some real smoke from burning oily rags. The plant was not attacked again.|$|E

25|$|If the PBGC {{finds that}} a {{distress}} termination is appropriate, the plan's liabilities are calculated and compared with its assets. Depending {{on the difference}} between the two values, the termination may be treated <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> a standard termination or <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> initiated by the PBGC.|$|E
25|$|Albus Dumbledore {{was tall}} and thin, with silver hair and beard (auburn in his youth) so long {{that they could be}} tucked into his belt. He had a very long and crooked nose that looked <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> broken at least twice. (It is speculated that his brother's punch during their sister's funeral may {{have played a role in}} shaping his nose.) He was also said to have had long and {{skillful}} fingers. His eyes were described to be a brilliant, soul-piercing shade of blue, and usually twinkled with kindness and mischief.|$|E
25|$|The second specimen, CAGS-IG-T1, also {{preserves}} {{the remains of}} several meals. Disarticulated bones were found, {{in front of the}} lower ischia, identified as belonging to at least two individuals of Confuciusornis sanctus, a basal bird that is very common in the formation. Also a 13.5 centimetres long scapula was discovered, belonging to some 1.5 metres (4.9 ft) long herbivorous ornithischian, perhaps Yueosaurus or a Psittacosaurus species. The bone surface of the scapula looked <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> etched by stomach acid for about thirteen days, leading to the conclusion the birds were swallowed later and in quick succession. This again would indicate a high metabolism for Sinocalliopteryx, necessitating a regular food intake.|$|E

25|$|It {{would appear}} that the bow of Scorpion skidded upon impact with the globigerina ooze on the sea floor, digging a sizable trench. The sail had been dislodged, as the hull of the {{operations}} compartment upon which it perched disintegrated, and was lying on its port side. One of Scorpions running lights was in the open position, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> on the surface {{at the time of the}} mishap, although it may have been left in the open position during the vessel's recent nighttime stop at Rota. One Trieste II pilot who dived on Scorpion said that the shock of the implosion may have knocked the light into the open position.|$|E
25|$|The Shulchan Aruch quotes the Talmud {{that because}} {{scissors}} have two blades, it would therefore {{be permitted to}} trim the beard by using them, since the cutting action would come from contact between two blades and not from that between blade and skin. In Germany and Italy, {{by the end of}} the seventeenth century, Jews started removing beards with the aid of pumice stones and chemical depilatories, which would leave the face smooth, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> shaven. These are non-razor shaves which are not prohibited. Menachem Mendel Schneersohn (Tzemach Tzedek) argued that shaving a beard would fall under the biblical regulation against males resembling a female (he also extended the prohibition for wanton destruction to destroying the hair of the beard); the Shulchan Aruch interpreted this regulation in a different way, arguing that it forbade men from removing hair from areas where women were accustomed to remove hair, such as underarm hair and pubic hair.|$|E
25|$|It was the Adventure Comics run which {{established}} the Legion's general workings and environment. A club of teenagers, they operated {{out of a}} clubhouse {{in the shape of}} an inverted yellow rocket ship which looked <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> driven into the ground. The position of Legion leader rotated among the membership. Each Legionnaire had to possess one natural superpower which no other member possessed; despite this, several members had overlapping powers, particularly Superboy, Supergirl, Mon-El, and Ultra Boy. Some issues included comical moments where candidates with bizarre, useless, or dangerous abilities would try out for membership and be rejected; five of these flawed candidates went on to form the Legion of Substitute Heroes. The Legion was based on Earth and protected an organization of humans and aliens called the United Planets. The regular police force in the United Planets was the Science Police. The setting for each story was 1000 years from the date of publication.|$|E

25|$|But the Liber secundus of 1685 {{can still}} be read today. Even after it was {{superseded}} by Book 3 of the Principia, it survived complete, {{in more than one}} manuscript. After Newton's death in 1727, the relatively accessible character of its writing encouraged the publication of an English translation in 1728 (by persons still unknown, not authorised by Newton's heirs). It appeared under the English title A Treatise of the System of the World. This had some amendments relative to Newton's manuscript of 1685, mostly to remove cross-references that used obsolete numbering to cite the propositions of an early draft of Book 1 of the Principia. Newton's heirs shortly afterwards published the Latin version in their possession, also in 1728, under the (new) title De Mundi Systemate, amended to update cross-references, citations and diagrams to those of the later editions of the Principia, making it look superficially <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> written by Newton after the Principia, rather than before. The System of the World was sufficiently popular to stimulate two revisions (with similar changes as in the Latin printing), a second edition (1731), and a 'corrected' reprint of the second edition (1740).|$|E
25|$|Puccini left {{instructions}} that Riccardo Zandonai should finish the opera. Puccini's son Tonio objected, and eventually Franco Alfano {{was chosen to}} flesh out the sketches after Vincenzo Tommasini (who had completed Boito's Nerone after the composer’s death) and Pietro Mascagni were rejected. Puccini's publisher Tito Ricordi II decided on Alfano because his opera La leggenda di Sakùntala resembled Turandot in its setting and heavy orchestration. Alfano provided a first version of the ending with a few passages of his own, {{and even a few}} sentences added to the libretto which was not considered complete even by Puccini himself. After the severe criticisms by Ricordi and the conductor Arturo Toscanini, he was forced to write a second, strictly censored version that followed Puccini's sketches more closely, {{to the point where he}} did not set some of Adami's text to music because Puccini had not indicated how he wanted it to sound. Ricordi's real concern was not the quality of Alfano's work, but that he wanted the end of Turandot to sound <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> written by Puccini, and Alfano's editing had to be seamless. Of this version, about three minutes were cut for performance by Toscanini, and it is this shortened version that is usually performed.|$|E
25|$|The {{exterior}} set for {{the fictional}} Albert Square {{is located in the}} permanent backlot of the BBC Elstree Centre, Borehamwood, Hertfordshire, at , and is outdoors and open to the weather. It was initially built in 1984 with a specification that it should last for at least fifteen years at a cost of £750,000. The EastEnders lot was designed by Keith Harris, who was a senior designer within the production team together with supervising art directors Peter Findley and Gina Parr. The main buildings on the square consisted originally of hollow shells, constructed from marine plywood facades mounted onto steel frames. The lower walls, pavements, etc., were constructed of real brick and tarmac. The set had to be made to look <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> standing for years. This was done by a number of means, including chipping the pavements, using chemicals to crack the top layer of the paint work, using varnish to create damp patches underneath the railway bridge, and making garden walls in such a way they appeared to sag. The final touches were added in summer 1984, these included a telephone box, telegraph pole that was provided by British Telecom, lampposts that were provided by Hertsmere Borough Council and a number of vehicles parked on the square. On each set all the appliances are fully functional such as gas cookers, the laundry washing machines and The Queen Victoria beer pumps.|$|E

Furthermore, the subject and object of intransitive verbs seemed to have the form of the absolutive (i.e. an asigmatic case). This caused an asymmetry between the valencies of transitive and intransitive verbs, summarized in the table below: ...|$|R
500|$|The Derry Provisionals {{had little}} contact with the IRA elsewhere. [...] They had few weapons (about twenty) which they used mainly for sniping. [...] At the same time, they {{launched}} their bombing campaign in Derry. [...] Unlike in Belfast, they were careful to avoid killing or injuring innocent people. [...] Eamonn McCann wrote that [...] "the Derry Provos, under Martin McGuinness, had managed to bomb the city centre until it looked <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> hit from the air without causing any civilian casualties." ...|$|E
500|$|Catherine {{was born}} on 13 April 1519 in Florence, Republic of Florence, {{the only child of}} Lorenzo de' Medici, duke of Urbino, and his wife, Madeleine de la Tour d'Auvergne, the countess of Boulogne. The young couple had been married the year before at Amboise as part of the {{alliance}} between King Francis I of France and Lorenzo's uncle Pope Leo X against the Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I. According to a contemporary chronicler, when Catherine was born, her parents were [...] "as pleased <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> a boy".|$|E
500|$|Lead singer Smith {{announced}} that the band would explore a new direction on their next album, pursuing a new, rawer sound. The new sound materialised itself on the third album {{through the use of}} traditional synthesizers instead of the band's previous use of guitars. The producer of In This Light and on This Evening, Flood also increased the importance of [...] "vibe" [...] in the music's sound, making it darker than the previous two albums, while also attempting to make the album sound <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> recorded live.|$|E

500|$|On {{at least}} one occasion, Merrick was able to fulfil a long-held desire to visit the theatre. Treves, {{with the help of}} Madge Kendal, {{arranged}} for him to attend the Christmas pantomime at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane. Treves sat with some nurses, concealed in Baroness Burdett-Coutts' private box. According to Treves, Merrick was [...] "awed" [...] and [...] "enthralled". [...] "The spectacle left him speechless, so that if he were spoken to he took no heed". For weeks following the show Merrick talked about the pantomime, reliving the story <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> real.|$|E
500|$|Reviews for Skin & Bone were decidedly mixed. The New York Times {{called it}} a [...] "bleak, disjointed movie" [...] that [...] "often comes across <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> planned like a pornographic feature." [...] Director Lewis is praised, however, for [...] "effectively mix us up as to what's real and what isn't." [...] Bright Lights Film Journal had {{stronger}} words of praise for the film, calling it [...] "intense [...] sometimes unsettling" [...] with a [...] "conceptual richness and mocking wit," [...] while also noting the [...] "element of genuine pathos [...] runs beneath the sardonic wit and brutal, sometimes lethal sex." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{building}} Donnell {{purchased in}} 1979 had declined badly. The Dearborn entrances {{had been closed}} in, the ground floor had been [...] "defaced by garish signs", and the brick had been painted and was peeling. Inside, the marble wainscoting had been painted over {{and many of the}} original oak doors had been replaced with cheaper mahogany. The decorative stair rails had been enclosed, and some stairways and corridors had been closed off completely. Much of the original mosaic tile had been demolished—some floors were carpeted, others tiled in vinyl or terrazzo. Half of the sixteen elevators were still manually operated. [...] "It was <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> partly updated every ten years throughout its history", said Donnell, [...] "it was never done over in its entirety." ...|$|E
