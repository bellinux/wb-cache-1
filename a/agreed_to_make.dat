In early February 1892, Palmer and Patrick A.

Palmer ended up rejecting the bid, and argued against it at the 1892 Democratic National Convention. Russell received one vote for President on the first ballot.|$|E
5|$|Early on in {{the gold}} rush, the US Army sent a small {{detachment}} to Circle City, in case intervention was required in the Klondike, while the Canadian government considered excluding all American prospectors from the Yukon Territory. Neither eventuality took place and instead the US <b>agreed</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> Dyea a sub-port of entry for Canadians, allowing British ships to land Canadian passengers and goods freely there, while Canada agreed to permit American miners {{to operate in the}} Klondike. Both decisions were unpopular among their domestic publics: American businessmen complained that their right to a monopoly on regional trade was being undermined, while the Canadian public demanded action against the American miners.|$|E

In November 1947, she agreed to do the film, thereby giving up an unfinished film project called Bedeviled. However, in January 1948, {{it was reported that}} she had withdrawn from the film. Initially, Louis B. Mayer gave her permission for doing so because of her schedule, but she was later that month put on suspension. Eventually, Turner <b>agreed</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the film, but did not start production until March due to having to lose weight.|$|E

After Fox and the studio argued against the idea of using Mulder in such a way, the producers <b>agreed</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the change.

Its episodes are approved by Rare's Gregg Mayles for their applicability to the game. The cartoon was also designed to give viewers tips on how to interact with the in-game piñatas.

5|$|Although the Whig Party was on {{its final}} decline nationally, it {{remained}} strong in Tennessee, and the outlook for Democrats there in 1855 was poor. Feeling that re-election as governor was necessary {{to give him a}} chance at the higher offices he sought, Johnson <b>agreed</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the run. Meredith P. Gentry received the Whig nomination. A series {{of more than a dozen}} vitriolic debates ensued. The issues in the campaign were slavery, the prohibition of alcohol, and the nativist positions of the Know Nothing Party. Johnson favored the first, but opposed the others. Gentry was more equivocal on the alcohol question, and had gained the support of the Know Nothings, a group Johnson portrayed as a secret society. Johnson was unexpectedly victorious, albeit with a narrower margin than in 1853.|$|E
5|$|At the Hospitallers' request, Pope Gregory IX {{repeated}} the excommunication of Bohemond in March 1230.

With the mediation of Gerald and the Ibelins, Bohemond and the Hospitallers made a treaty which was signed on 26 October 1231. Bohemond confirmed the Hospitallers' right to hold Jabala and a nearby fortress and granted them money fiefs in both Tripoli and Antioch. The knights renounced the privileges that Raymond-Roupen had granted to them. Before long, Gerald of Lausanne lifted the excommunication and sent the treaty to Rome to be confirmed by the Holy See.|$|E

5|$|Australia's bowling {{attack was}} led by Lindwall and Miller, who took the new ball in the Tests. Bradman used the pair in short and fiery bursts with the new ball. English cricket administrators had <b>agreed</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a new ball {{available}} every 55 overs; at the time, the norm was to allow a new ball for every 200 runs scored, something that usually took longer than 55 overs. The new regulation played directly {{into the hands of}} the Australians, as a new ball is ideal for fast bowling and the tourists had a vastly superior pace attack. Bradman thus wanted to preserve his two first-choice pacemen for a vigorous attack on the English batsmen every 55 overs. As a result, Australia's third fast bowler Bill Johnston bowled the most overs, and the left arm seamer Ernie Toshack also had a heavy workload until a knee injury ended his campaign.|$|E
5|$|Both Warren and Brown stated {{early in}} the race {{that they would not}} accept {{television}} advertisement assistance from Super PACs and interest groups. On January 23, 2012, both candidates signed the agreement, or People's Pledge. While no outside groups were obligated by the agreement, both candidates agreed to donate a sum equal to 50% of an advertisement run by any groups to a charity of the other candidate's choice. The pledge was broken twice, by Brown supporters. In March the American Petroleum Institute and Coalition of Americans for Political Equality launched ads supporting Brown, and as a result, the Brown campaign <b>agreed</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> donations of $1,000 and $34,545, respectively, to the charity of Warren's choice: the Autism Consortium.|$|E

5|$|Edmund Rich, the Archbishop of Canterbury, {{intervened in}} 1234 and held several great councils, advising Henry {{to accept the}} {{dismissal}} of des Roches. Henry <b>agreed</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> peace, but, before the negotiations were completed, Richard died of wounds suffered in battle, leaving his younger brother Gilbert to inherit his lands. The final settlement was confirmed in May, and Henry was widely praised for his humility in submitting to the slightly embarrassing peace. Meanwhile, the truce with France in Brittany finally expired, and Henry's ally Duke Peter came under fresh military pressure. Henry could only send a small force of soldiers to assist, and Brittany fell to Louis in November. For the next 24 years, Henry ruled the kingdom personally, rather than through senior ministers.|$|E
5|$|In 530 a major Persian {{offensive}} in Mesopotamia {{was defeated by}} Roman forces under Belisarius at Dara, while a second Persian thrust in the Caucasus was defeated by Sittas at Satala. Belisarius was defeated by Persian and Lakhmid forces at the Battle of Callinicum in 531. In the same year the Romans gained some forts in Armenia, while the Persians had captured two forts in eastern Lazica. Immediately after the failure at Callinicum the Persians and Romans negotiated without success. The two sides re-opened talks in spring 532 and finally signed the Eternal Peace in September 532, which lasted less than eight years. Both powers agreed to return all occupied territories, and the Romans <b>agreed</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a one-time payment of 110 centenaria (11,000lb of gold). Iberia remained in Persian hands, and the Iberians who had left their country were given the choice of remaining in Roman territory or returning to their native land.|$|E
5|$|Johnston was a left-arm bowler {{who engaged}} in fast bowling when the ball was new and conducive to pacemen, before {{reverting}} to orthodox spin when the ball became old. He was Australia's third fast bowler in the Tests, reinforcing the new ball attack of Keith Miller and Ray Lindwall, who were {{regarded as one of}} the finest pace pairings of all time. Bradman typically used Miller and Lindwall in short bursts against the English batsmen with the new ball. The hosts had <b>agreed</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a new ball available every 55 overs, more frequently than usual. This allowed the Australian pacemen more frequent use of a shiny ball that swung at high pace. Johnston typically delivered pace after the Lindwall and Miller had first use of the new ball, before resorting to spin later in the innings. In order to keep Lindwall and Miller fresh, Bradman had Johnston deliver the most overs by any bowler.|$|E
