25|$|Nimble, Capital and General Geddes reached Key West on 24 December and Florida and Thorn {{returned}} from Cuba the next day, their crews having been released unharmed. One of the Africans on Surprize died before reaching Key West, so 121 were unloaded there. Lt. Holden {{claimed that the}} Africans were under his protection because Guerrero had surrendered to him. The Collector of Customs for the port claimed custody of the Africans {{because they had been}} landed in American territory after being shipwrecked. The wreckers claimed salvage on Nimble for helping to get it off the reef and replace the rudder. Lt. Holden refused to submit to the <b>arbitration</b> <b>procedure</b> established by Florida territorial law, which would have let a panel of local residents, almost all of whom had a financial stake in wrecking, decide how much in salvage fees were due the wreckers. Nimble left Key West without the Africans, and the wreckers remained unpaid. Nimble delivered the 20 Cuban crewmen it was holding to Havana to be dealt with by the British-Spanish Mixed Commission Court that dealt with Spanish slave-runners caught near Cuba.|$|E

2500|$|In 1940, President Roosevelt asked Millis {{to become}} the {{permanent}} arbiter between General Motors (GM) and the United Auto Workers (UAW). The 1937 collective bargaining agreement between {{the company and its}} union established a temporary, voluntary <b>arbitration</b> <b>procedure,</b> which was made permanent in the 1940 contract. It was the first permanent arbitration mechanism in any mass production industry, and not only the union but many companies and politicians were eager to see it succeed. [...] Several of President Roosevelt's aides and confidantes urged Millis to accept the position. He agreed. However, Millis refused the large salary that was offered to him, and instead took only the same moderate salary he had been receiving at the university. Although he was arbitrator for only a few months, he laid the groundwork for smooth labor relations not only at General Motors but set a pattern for arbitration that spread throughout the manufacturing sector of the economy.|$|E

40|$|This article explores an {{overlooked}} dynamic between arbitration and {{the more}} formal court system. As developed in more detail below, this article 2 ̆ 7 s thesis is that arbitration can help define and reinforce due process norms applicable in court, and a due process-like norm regarding discovery is beginning to develop. Courts often review arbitration agreements for fairness, and through this judicial review, courts have developed a body of law discussing and defining whether certain procedures (or the lack thereof) violate fairness norms {{in connection with the}} resolution of a particular dispute. Through this body of law exploring procedural fairness, one can identify emerging procedural norms, such as a right to discovery in certain situations. Through the procedural creativity and experimentation that occurs in arbitration, and through the judicial review of such arbitral <b>procedures,</b> <b>arbitration</b> creates countless opportunities to explore and define what constitutes the minimum bundle of procedures required for a fair hearing. Part II of this article provides a general overview of <b>arbitration</b> and <b>arbitration</b> <b>procedures.</b> Part III of this article then explores the legal framework supporting arbitration, including how courts review <b>arbitration</b> <b>procedures</b> for fundamental fairness. Part IV concludes with a discussion of how this judicial review of <b>arbitration</b> <b>procedures</b> helps define and reinforce due process norms applicable in courts, particularly with respect to an emerging due process right to discovery...|$|R

40|$|This Note {{addresses}} {{whether there}} should be an arbitration and mediation section added to both the Uniform Athlete Agent Act (UAAA), and Sports Agent Responsibility and Trust Act (SPARTA) to establish a uniform dispute resolution process for dealing with unscrupulous acts of athlete agents. This issue is distinctive because while all four professional sports leagues’ players associations have specific <b>arbitration</b> <b>procedures</b> in their athlete agent regulations, the two statutes governing athlete agent conduct do not adopt a uniform policy relating to <b>arbitration</b> <b>procedures.</b> This Note addresses the prior history of state and federal legislation pertaining to an athlete agent, including how the UAAA and SPARTA regulate athlete agents working with both students and professionals. This Note then analyzes the similarities and differences among the <b>arbitration</b> and mediation <b>procedures</b> used by each of the four professional sports leagues’ players associations. It next discusses the successes and failures of both the professional leagues’ arbitration methods and other legal literature propositions for most effectively dealing with sports agents. Finally, this Note proposes that the most effective processes for dealing with the alleged unscrupulous acts of sports agents will result from modifying both the UAAA and SPARTA to include a uniform sports agent act and a uniform arbitration and mediation section...|$|R

40|$|Given {{the obvious}} {{inadequacy}} of ordinary legal procedures to resolve consumer disputes, {{it is necessary}} to look for alternative models which, without excluding administrative and judicial proceedings, are more accessible to consumers. Although arbitration is the most widely used model, consumer mediation is becoming increasingly more important. Consumer mediation lacks a systematic organisation in Spanish law and the rules on consumer arbitration only refer to mediation, remitting to regulation by the autonomous communities, some of which have exclusive competence in mediation in their Statutes of Autonomy. Although mediation in consumer affairs often falls within <b>arbitration</b> <b>procedures,</b> the optimal solution would be to separate mediation linked to <b>arbitration</b> <b>procedures</b> (intra-arbitration) from consumer mediation detached from arbitration (extra-arbitration) to offer more alternatives for out-of-court conflict resolution, taking into account that a resolution obtained in a process of mediation will be enforceable if it {{is in the form of}} a court settlement or if it is recorded by a notary. The conclusion is that consumer affairs are especially suitable for mediation, although the rules on consumer arbitration are inadequate for normalisation, making it necessary to introduce specific regulations on mediation for their application in this field...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to provide an {{overview}} of the most recent public policy and ethical issues as they relate to the growing usage of nonunion employment arbitration particularly in relation to financial services firms and professional firms. In this era of increasing employment-related litigation, it is wise from an employer’s point of view to find alternative procedures that offer assurances of fairness yet provide expeditious means for resolving disputes. From an employee’s vantage point, however, it is essential that the fundamental issue of procedural and substantive due process be maintained and guaranteed. Therefore, a number of strategic ethical issues arise: How should employment <b>arbitration</b> <b>procedures</b> be designed following the Due Process Protocol of the Task Force on Alternative Dispute Resolution in Employment? How should <b>arbitration</b> <b>procedures</b> follow the national rules for the resolution of employment disputes of the American Arbitration Association? Do recent court decisions shed light on these issues? What ethical principles can be gleaned from these public policy pronouncements? A final objective of this paper is to study some of the current initiatives on this topic.

There were more than fifty such drafts during Hunter's tenure. His biographer L W Chubb singles out the Conveyance of Mails Act, 1893, which established an <b>arbitration</b> <b>procedure</b> for disputes between the railway companies and the GPO about charges for transporting mail by train. Chubb calculates that this one measure saved the taxpayer more than £10m. Hunter's other most important contribution, in Chubb's view, was the negotiation of the terms for acquiring the National Telephone Company's system, which saved another £8.5m.|$|E
