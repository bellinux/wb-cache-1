25|$|Colonies {{are often}} {{founded by a}} group of L. vechti females using what is known as {{associative}} foundation. They begin by constructing small nests in the center, and eventually other wasps join the colony and build nests around the initial central one. The nests last for multiple years, and colonies grow and contain up to 600 nests or more. Temperature does not play a serious limiting factor in the lives of these wasps, and there is no particular season during which the colonies of these wasps are not present and active. However, brood rearing <b>and</b> <b>reproduction</b> <b>is</b> more likely to occur during the dry season, and the population of the nest tends to increase during that time as well, although brood rearing and reproduction also occurs during the wet season.|$|E
500|$|The {{movements}} of the people show that their behaviour is inappropriate or a caricature of rustic buffoonery, but its representation of fertility <b>and</b> <b>reproduction</b> <b>is</b> presented in a joyful manner. Indeed, the painting reflects a degree of ambiguity in that it can both {{be seen as an}} attack on the stereotypical oversexed behaviour of the lower orders as well as evoking a comical picture. In the sixteenth century, when this was painted, dance was subject to a strict code and regarded by the authorities and church as a social evil. People could not swing their arms or legs or laugh too loud, as that would be considered a type of rudeness to many people. The painting therefore [...] "expresses the peasants' liberation from the stricter limits of upper classes" [...] by failing to adhere to the expected social standards of the times.|$|E
2500|$|In most birds, both {{excretion}} <b>and</b> <b>reproduction</b> <b>is</b> {{done through}} a single posterior opening, called the cloaca—male and female birds touch cloaca to transfer sperm, {{a process called}} [...] "cloacal kissing". In many other terrestrial animals, males use specialized sex organs to assist the transport of sperm—these male sex organs are called intromittent organs. In humans and other mammals this male organ is the penis, which enters the female reproductive tract (called the vagina) to achieve insemination—a process called sexual intercourse. The penis contains a tube through which semen (a fluid containing sperm) travels. In female mammals the vagina connects with the uterus, an organ which directly supports {{the development of a}} fertilized embryo within (a process called gestation).|$|E

2500|$|Sound {{recording}} <b>and</b> <b>reproduction</b> <b>is</b> {{an electrical}} or mechanical inscription and re-creation of sound waves, such as spoken voice, singing, instrumental music, or sound effects. The two main classes of sound recording technology are analog recording and digital recording. Analog (or analogue) recording (Greek, ana = [...] "according to" [...] and logos = [...] "relationship") {{is a technique}} used to store signals of audio or video information for later playback. In digital recording, the analog signal of video or sound is converted into a stream of discrete numbers, representing the changes in chroma and luminance values (video) orair-pressure (audio) through time, thus making an abstract template for the original sound or moving image. In 1967, the first digital audio magnetic tape recorder is invented. A 12-bit 30kHz stereo device using a compander to extend the dynamic range.|$|E

50|$|Soils are thin, coarse and {{relatively}} nutrient-poor, {{owing to the}} unproductive climate and repeated glaciation events during the Pleistocene. Moisture retention is usually high, due {{to the presence of}} underlying granite bedrock, and soils often become waterlogged early in the growing season. However, because very little precipitation falls during the summer months, soils can dry quickly once snow melts and vegetative growth <b>and</b> <b>reproduction</b> <b>is</b> limited late in the growing season by drought.|$|E
50|$|Growth <b>and</b> <b>reproduction</b> <b>is</b> poor in dry or acidic conditions, {{though the}} plants can handle drought well once dormant. By {{emerging}} before the forest canopy leafs out, Ficaria verna {{is able to}} take advantage of the higher levels of sunlight reaching the forest floor during late winter and early spring. By late spring, second year plants quickly age as daylight hours lengthen and temperatures rise. By the end of May, foliage has died back and plants enter a six month dormancy phase.|$|E

50|$|The {{association}} of this ritual with fertility, sex <b>and</b> <b>reproduction</b> <b>is</b> {{both natural and}} human.

The history of this ritual practice dates back to the ancient period and was patronised by the Kings and royal households. This ritual practice existed in various historical periods. Aadi is the month for sowing, rooting, planting of seeds and vegetation since it is peak monsoon time when rain is showered in abundance.|$|E
50|$|Arrowroot is a {{perennial}} plant growing to {{a height of}} between 0.3 m and 1.5 m. Its leaves are lanceolate. The edible part of the plant is the rhizome. Twin clusters of small white flowers bloom about 90 days after planting. The plant rarely produces seed <b>and</b> <b>reproduction</b> <b>is</b> typically by planting part of a rhizome with a bud. Rhizomes are ready for harvesting 10-12 months after planting as leaves of the plant begin to wilt and die. The rhizomes are fleshy, cylindrical, and grow from 20 cm to 45 cm long.|$|E

50|$|The drone's {{only job}} is to mate with the virgin alates, <b>and</b> <b>reproduction</b> <b>is</b> at its highest in spring and summer. Tetramorium, like many other ants have nuptial flights where drones fly {{high up in the}} air and mate with new queens. The dealate, or newly fertilized slate, finds a {{suitable}} nesting location and digs a founding chamber called the clausteral chamber/cell. As the eggs hatch and the ants develop they will spend that time, about two to three months, tending to the queen of their colony. They will continue helping in the colony until they are a month old.|$|E
50|$|Many {{are quite}} {{specialised}} {{and can only}} thrive and reproduce where the ground has been broken by plough or spade. They are invariably annual <b>and</b> <b>reproduction</b> <b>is</b> by seed alone, which can in many species lie dormant for years in the soil until brought to the surface during cultivation. They have fast reproduction cycles, usually in one year from seed to seed, though some species can {{have more than one}} generation in one season. A few species such as groundsel (Senecio vulgaris), shepherd's purse (Capsella bursa-pastoris), red deadnettle (Lamium purpureum) and chickweed (Stellaria media) can survive unharmed through very cold weather and are often able to seed even in winter.|$|E

40|$|Composting {{is a waste}} {{management}} technology that is becoming more widespread {{as a response to}} the increasing production of sewage sludge and the pressure for its reuse in soil. In this study, different bioassays (plant germination, earthworm survival, biomass <b>and</b> <b>reproduction,</b> <b>and</b> collembolan survival <b>and</b> <b>reproduction)</b> <b>were</b> assessed for their usefulness in the compost quality assessment. Compost samples, from two different composting plants, were taken along the composting process, which were characterized and submitted to bioassays (plant germination and collembolan and earthworm performance). Results from our study indicate that the noxious effects of some of the compost samples observed in bioassays are related to the low organic matter stability of composts and the enhanced release of decomposition endproducts, with the exception of earthworms, which are favored. Plant germination <b>and</b> collembolan <b>reproduction</b> inhibition <b>was</b> generally associated with uncomposted sludge, while earthworm total biomass <b>and</b> <b>reproduction</b> <b>were</b> enhanced by these materials. On the other hand, earthworm and collembolan survival were unaffected by the degree of composting of the wastes. However, this pattern was clear in one of the composting procedures assessed, but less in the other, where the release of decomposition endproducts was lower due to its higher stability, indicating the sensitivity and usefulness of bioassays for the quality assessment of composts...|$|R
