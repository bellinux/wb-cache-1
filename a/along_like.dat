25|$|In March 1982 {{he worked}} in Modena, Italy, and from November, Basquiat worked from the ground-floor display and studio space Larry Gagosian had built below his Venice, California, home and {{commenced}} a series of paintings for a 1983 show, his second at Gagosian Gallery, then in West Hollywood. He brought along his girlfriend, then unknown aspiring singer Madonna. Gagosian recalls, “Everything was going along fine. Jean-Michel was making paintings, I was selling them, and {{we were having a}} lot of fun. But then one day Jean-Michel said, ‘My girlfriend is coming to stay with me.’ I was a little concerned-one too many eggs can spoil an omelet, you know? So I said, ‘Well, what’s she like?’ And he said, He said, ‘Her name is Madonna and she’s going to be huge.’ I’ll never forget that he said that. So Madonna came out and stayed for a few months and we all got <b>along</b> <b>like</b> one big, happy family.” During this time he took considerable interest in the work that Robert Rauschenberg was producing at Gemini G.E.L. in West Hollywood, visiting him on several occasions and finding inspiration in the accomplishments of the painter. In 1982, Basquiat worked briefly with musician and artist David Bowie.|$|E

[...] Subsequent Christmas specials {{were recorded in}} 1972 and 1973. [...] In 1975 a 13-episode television series was commissioned by ATV for ITV. Carry On Laughing ran for two seasons, with six half-hour episodes in season one and seven in season two. [...] The writer Penelope Gilliatt wrote: [...] "The usual charge to make against the Carry On films {{is to say that}} they could be so much better done. [...] This is true enough. [...] They look dreadful, they seem to be edited with a bacon slicer, the effects are perfunctory and the comic rhythm jerks <b>along</b> <b>like</b> a cat on a cold morning.

500|$|John Frink is {{generally}} depicted as Springfield's stereotypical nerdy, mad, and socially inept scientist, inventor, and mathematician. He wears thick glasses, a white lab coat, pink pants, and has buckteeth. Frink is {{a college professor}} at Springfield Heights Institute of Technology and runs his own astronomical observatory. He has an IQ of 197it was 199 before he sustained a concussion during the collapse of Springfield's brief intellectual juntaand {{is a member of}} the Springfield chapter of Mensa. Frink {{is generally}} very polite and friendly. He has a trademark mannerism of using Jerry Lewis-style gibberish when excited, such as [...] "HOYVIN-GLAVIN!" [...] and [...] "FLAVIN" [...] and impulsively shouting other words that have no relevance to the situation at hand. He also occasionally refers to the importance of remembering to [...] "carry the one" [...] in various mathematical calculations. When he rambles he often speaks incoherently in run-on sentences without pauses. Frink also has a tendency to over-complicate simple matters and/or invent scientific terminology while expressing various concepts, e.g. [...] "Father and I got <b>along</b> <b>like</b> positrons and antineutrinos!" [...] or, [...] "microcalifragilistics".|$|E
500|$|Many critics noted Several {{songs are}} built on the same formula of [...] "You're a Jerk", with Allmusic noting that, [...] "Dot Com," [...] "Colors," [...] "Turnt," [...] and [...] "So Dope" [...] (which the chorus is a sound bite from the 1992 film Class Act) all have the cheesy drum machines, samples, and off-kilter lyric {{approach}} that make [...] "Jerk" [...] so good. The review also said [...] "R ballad [...] "Tie Me Down" [...] featuring smooth Auto-tuned vocals from Ray J, the B.A.S.S.-inspired [...] "Bunz", the slow jam [...] "New Girl," [...] and the rollicking [...] "Cashmere," [...] which bumps <b>along</b> <b>like</b> a New Jack rap jam, are nice diversions." [...] On the album split, The Los Angeles Times said, [...] "The album begins to lose circulation toward its end, when the pair lose their lambent wit in favor of mawkish lover-boy ballads better left to Sean Kingston albums." [...] Jeff Weiss of the newspaper used [...] "Tie Me Down" [...] as an example, noting that its sounds have [...] "a saccharine sappiness and contrived tone that feels {{at odds with the}} otherwise organic-sounding album." ...|$|E

500|$|Andrew Hampp and Erika Ramirez of Billboard {{magazine}} praised Beyoncé's [...] "sexy" [...] vocals on {{the track}} which they hailed as a [...] "slinky club banger". The Washington Post writer Chris Richards described [...] "Blow" [...] as a [...] "strutting, moaning disco vamp". Sal Cinquemani, writing for Slant Magazine {{described it as a}} [...] "post-disco slink". The Quietus writer Mof Gimmers wrote, [...] "The cocaine soul bears down again, with the excellent 'Blow' which grooves <b>along</b> <b>like</b> Kelis on a Friday night, before gnashing its teeth into the gonzo pop of Cameo or Parliament." [...] The Guardians Michael Cragg described it as a [...] "delicious throwback funk" [...] song. Mikael Wood of Los Angeles Times felt that the [...] "sumptuous" [...] song allowed Beyoncé [...] "to flex her impressive stylistic chops". Spins Anupa Mistry praised the collaboration of Timbaland and Pharrell on the [...] "nimble and funky" [...] track [...] "Blow" [...] as [...] "mighty" [...] and [...] "genius". Similarly, Claire Lobenfeld from Complex who felt that Justin Timberlake and Timbaland [...] "lost their ability to make their distinctive, infectious love-pop" [...] on Timberlake's album The 20/20 Experience, noted that [...] "Blow" [...] proved the opposite: [...] "The two have reinvigorated the overused private-parts-as-candy trope by writing one of Bey's friskiest songs ever. Add some Pharrell production... and you have one of the smoothest pieces of filth of the year." [...] Ryan Dennehy from AbsolutePunk found [...] "trademark" [...] Timbaland production in [...] "Blow" [...] and opined, [...] "Bey wisely co-opts Timbaland himself to deliver a steamy hook that interlocks with her own vocals." [...] Cosmopolitan writer Alex Rees deemed [...] "Blow" [...] an [...] "awesome disco moment".|$|E
500|$|The {{following}} track, [...] "Enjoy", a song {{concerning the}} links between sex and fear, has been considered as [...] "decidedly trippy", and [...] "Posts most abrasive track". NME described it in its 1995 review as, [...] "a dark and deranged techno thing". Over military drums and [...] "squalls of noise", Björk sings about [...] "her hedonistic tendencies". The orchestral interlude [...] "You've Been Flirting Again", like the previous track [...] "Enjoy", features [...] "mysterious or open-ended lyrics". They are an attempt to describe the nature of flirting, which is [...] "ambiguous and slippery"; the playfulness of the song's title contrasting with the [...] "weightiness" [...] of its words. [...] "Isobel" [...] is a string-laden, orchestral trip hop song, with a [...] "visually rich narrative". Craig McLean of The Face called the track [...] "Broadway on breakbeats". Various critics have discussed the song's distinctive tempo, with Pulse!s Tom Lanham comparing it to [...] "a camel making {{its way across the}} desert", and Rolling Stones Lorraine Ali writing that the song [...] "snakes <b>along</b> <b>like</b> a patient desert caravan". Conceived by Björk as [...] "part autobiography part storytelling", its lyrics concern Isobel, a woman magically born in a forest who finds people in the city [...] "a bit too clever for her", eventually retreating back to nature and sending them a message of instinct through trained moths. Inspired by South American literature—particularly Gabriel García Márquez—the track's lyrics discuss [...] "the duality between reason and emotions, between intuition and intellect"; in the singer's own words, [...] "asking how 20th century civilisation clashes with nature and, in places like Iceland and Thailand, people really believe they can have a TV remote control {{in one hand and a}} ghost sitting beside them".|$|E
500|$|Another {{prominent}} {{artist was}} Tetsuya Nomura. Having impressed Sakaguchi with his proposed ideas, which were handwritten and illustrated {{rather than simply}} typed on a PC, Nomura was brought on as main character designer. Talking of his role as character designer, Nomura stated {{that when he was}} brought on, the main scenario had not been completed, but he [...] "went <b>along</b> <b>like,</b> 'I guess first off you need a hero and a heroine', and from there drew the designs while thinking up details about the characters. After [...] done the hero and heroine, [...] carried on drawing by thinking what kind of characters would be interesting to have. When [...] handed over the designs [...] tell people the character details [...] thought up, or write them down on a separate sheet of paper". Something that could not be carried over from earlier titles was the chibi sprite art, as that would not fit with the new graphical direction. Naora, in his role as an assistant character designer and art director, helped adjust each character's appearance so the actions they performed were believable. When designing Cloud and Sephiroth, Nomura was influenced by his view of their rivalry mirroring the legendary animosity between Miyamoto Musashi and Sasaki Kojirō, with Cloud and Sephiroth being Musashi and Kojirō respectively. Sephiroth's look was defined as [...] "kakkoii", a Japanese term combining good looks with coolness. Several of Nomura's designs evolved substantially during development. Cloud's original design of slicked-back black hair with no spikes was intended to serve as a contrast to Sephiroth's long, flowing silver hair in addition to saving polygons. Nomura feared, however, that such masculinity could prove unpopular with fans, and therefore he changed Cloud's design to feature a shock of spiky, bright blond hair. Vincent changed from researcher to detective to chemist, and finally to the figure of a former Turk with a tragic past.|$|E

2500|$|Paul I, who {{ascended to}} the throne in November 1796, {{dismissed}} most of his mother's statesmen but retained Bezborodko in charge of foreign affairs. Paul extended the favor to Lvov and granted him state support and new commissions, although nowhere as significant or lucrative as those awarded to Vincenzo Brenna (Khodasevich: [...] "Even under new order Lvov was swimming <b>along</b> <b>like</b> a fish in water"). In an ironic twist of fortune, in April 1797 Paul I dispatched Lvov to Moscow to redesign Bartolomeo Rastrelli's modest Grand Kremlin Palace, a feat once attempted by Vasili Bazhenov. Lvov produced a vast plan consisting of a three-part neoclassical palace core within a redesigned Gothic revival citadel, [...] "an intimate royal villa in a park-like setting." [...] His design was not as radical as Bazhenov's 1767 draft that was cancelled by Catherine at an early stage, but shared the same fate. After one year of preliminary work the project was cancelled; all alterations to existing Kremlin buildings done by Lvov were later absorbed into extant Grand Kremlin Palace designed by Konstantin Thon.|$|E
2500|$|The {{original}} {{concept for}} Final Fantasy VIIs world {{was for a}} fully modern setting, but after the project moved from the 2D Super Nintendo Entertainment System to development for the PlayStation console, the setting altered with it. Elements from the original concept were later used in Final Fantasy VIII and Parasite Eve. The game's producer, Hironobu Sakaguchi, chose character designer Tetsuya Nomura to create the main cast. Nomura had previously worked on monster designs for Final Fantasy VI. Sakaguchi chose Nomura after being amused by the way Nomura did the storyboarding for the cutscenes. Talking of his role as character designer, Nomura stated {{that when he was}} brought on, the main scenario had not been completed, but he [...] "went <b>along</b> <b>like,</b> 'I guess first off you need a hero and a heroine', and from there drew the designs while thinking up details about the characters. After [...] done the hero and heroine, [...] carried on drawing by thinking what kind of characters would be interesting to have. When [...] handed over the designs [...] tell people the character details [...] thought up, or write them down on a separate sheet of paper." [...] Nomura also created Zack Fair, who was a late addition to the cast meant to add depth to Cloud and Aerith's relationship, and came up with the name for Red XIII, wanting an [...] "interesting" [...] name that combined a color and a number. Although the game was Nomura's favorite Final Fantasy project, he felt that it was hindered by graphical limitations, and that his designs were, consequently, very plain in comparison to his [...] "true" [...] style.|$|E
2500|$|One of the earliest, {{and one of}} {{the most}} famous {{critical}} disparagements of the play occurred in 1678, in the introduction to Edward Ravenscroft's theatrical adaptation, Titus Andronicus, or the Rape of Lavinia. A Tragedy, Alter'd from Mr. Shakespeare's Works. Speaking of the original play, Ravenscroft wrote, [...] "'tis the most incorrect and indigested piece in all his works. It seems rather a heap of rubbish than a structure." [...] In 1765, Samuel Johnson questioned the possibility of even staging the play, pointing out that [...] "the barbarity of the spectacles, and the general massacre which are here exhibited, can scarcely be conceived tolerable to any audience." [...] In 1811, August Wilhelm Schlegel wrote that the play was [...] "framed according to a false idea of the tragic, which by an accumulation of cruelties and enormities, degenerated into the horrible and yet leaves no deep impression behind." [...] In 1927, T.S. Eliot famously argued that it was [...] "one of the stupidest and most uninspired plays ever written, a play in which it is incredible that Shakespeare had any hand at all, a play in which the best passages would be too highly honoured by the signature of Peele." [...] In 1948, John Dover Wilson wrote that the play [...] "seems to jolt and bump <b>along</b> <b>like</b> some broken-down cart, laden with bleeding corpses from an Elizabethan scaffold, and driven by an executioner from Bedlam dressed in cap and bells." [...] He goes on to say that if the play had been by anyone other than Shakespeare, it would have been lost and forgotten; it is only because tradition holds that Shakespeare wrote it (which Dover Wilson highly suspects) that it is remembered, not for any intrinsic qualities of its own.|$|E
