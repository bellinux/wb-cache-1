This means, for {{the first}} nuclear heatup of each fuel element, that local bundle power must be ramped very slowly to prevent {{cracking}} of the fuel pellets and limit {{the differences in the}} rates of thermal expansion of the fuel. PCIOMR rules also limit the maximum local power change (in kW/ft*hr), prevent pulling control rods below the tips of <b>adjacent</b> <b>control</b> rods, and require control rod sequences to be analyzed against core modelling software to prevent pellet-clad interactions. PCIOMR analysis look at local power peaks and xenon transients which could be caused by control rod position changes or rapid power changes to ensure that local power rates never exceed maximum ratings.|$|E
5000|$|In March 2002, plant staff {{discovered}} that the borated water {{that serves as the}} reactor coolant had leaked from cracked control rod drive mechanisms directly above the reactor and eaten through more than six inches (150 mm) of the carbon steel reactor pressure vessel head over an area roughly {{the size of a football}} (see photo). This significant reactor head wastage on the interior of the reactor vessel head left only 3/8 in of stainless steel cladding holding back the high-pressure (~2500 psi, 17 MPa) reactor coolant. A breach most likely would have resulted in a massive loss-of-coolant accident, in which reactor coolant would have jetted into the reactor's containment building and resulted in emergency safety procedures to protect from core damage or meltdown. Because of the location of the reactor head damage, such a jet of reactor coolant might have damaged <b>adjacent</b> <b>control</b> rod drive mechanisms, hampering or preventing reactor shut-down.

40|$|Endometrial cancer (EC) is {{the most}} common estrogen-dependent {{gynecological}} malignancy in the developed World. To investigate the local formation of estradiol (E 2), we first measured the concentrations of the steroid precursor androstenedione (A-dione) and the most potent estrogen, E 2, and we evaluated the metabolism of A-dione, estrone-sulfate (E 1 -S), and estrone (E 1) in cancerous and <b>adjacent</b> <b>control</b> endometrium. Furthermore, we studied expression of the key genes for estradiol formation via the aromatase and sulfatase pathways. A-dione and E 2 were detected in cancerous and <b>adjacent</b> <b>control</b> endometrium. In cancerous endometrium, A-dione was metabolized to testosterone, and no E 2 was formed. Both, E 1 -S and E 1 were metabolized to E 2, with increased levels of E 2 seen in cancerous tissue. There {{was no significant difference in}} expression of the key genes of the aromatase (CYP 19 A 1) and the sulfatase (STS, HSD 17 B 1, HSD 17 B 2) pathways in cancerous endometrium compared to <b>adjacent</b> <b>control</b> tissue. The mRNA levels of CYP 19 A 1 and HSD 17 B 1 were low, and HSD 17 B 14, which promotes inactivation of E 2, was significantly down-regulated in cancerous endometrium, especially in patients with lymphovascular invasion. At the protein level, there were no differences in the levels of STS and HSD 17 B 2 between cancerous and <b>adjacent</b> <b>control</b> tissue by Western blotting, and immunohistochemistry revealed intense staining for STS and HSD 17 B 2, and weak staining for SULT 1 E 1 and HSD 17 B 1 in cancerous tissue.

40|$|Background: The {{scientific}} basis for acupuncture meridians is unknown. Past {{studies have suggested}} that acupuncture meridians are physiologically characterized by low electrical impedance and anatomically associated with connective tissue planes. We are interested in seeing whether acupuncture meridians are associated with lower electrical impedance and whether ultrasound-derived measures – specifically echogenic collagenous bands- can account for these impedance differences. Methods/Results: In 28 healthy subjects, we assessed electrical impedance of skin and underlying subcutaneous connective tissue using a four needle-electrode approach. The impedances were obtained at 10 kHz and 100 kHz frequencies and at three body sites- upper arm (Large Intestine meridian), thigh (Liver), and lower leg (Bladder). Meridian locations were determined by acupuncturists. Ultrasound images were obtained to characterize the anatomical features at each measured site. We found significantly reduced electrical impedance at the Large Intestine meridian compared to <b>adjacent</b> <b>control</b> for both frequencies. No significant decrease in impedance was found at the Liver or Bladder meridian. Greater subcutaneous echogenic densities were significantly associated with reduced impedances in both within-site (meridian vs. <b>adjacent</b> <b>control)</b> and between-site (arm vs. thigh vs. lower leg) analyses. This relationship remained significant in multivariabl...|$|E
40|$|Background: Introduced organisms {{can alter}} {{ecosystems}} by disrupting natural ecological relationships. For example, red imported fire ants (Solenopsis invicta) have disrupted native arthropod communities {{throughout much of}} their introduced range. By competing {{for many of the}} same food resources as insectivorous vertebrates, fire ants also have the potential to disrupt vertebrate communities. Methodology/Principal Findings: To explore the effects of fire ants on a native insectivorous vertebrate, we compared the reproductive success and strategies of eastern bluebirds (Sialia sialis) inhabiting territories with different abundances of fire ants. We also created experimental dyads of adjacent territories comprised of one territory with artificially reduced fire ant abundance (treated) and one territory that was unmanipulated (control). We found that more bluebird young fledged from treated territories than from <b>adjacent</b> <b>control</b> territories. Fire ant abundance also explained significant variation in two measures of reproductive success across the study population: number of fledglings and hatching success of second clutches. Furthermore, the likelihood of bluebird parents re-nesting in the same territory was negatively influenced by the abundance of foraging fire ants, and parents nesting in territories with experimentally reduced abundances of fire ants produced male-biased broods relative to pairs in <b>adjacent</b> <b>control</b> territories. Conclusions/Significance: Introduced fire ants altered both the reproductive success (number of fledglings, hatchin...|$|E

40|$|According to {{conventional}} wisdom within the acupuncture community, acupuncture points and meridians are special conduits for electrical signals. This view gained popularity after anecdotal reports and clinical studies asserted that these anatomical structures {{are characterized by}} lower electrical impedance compared to <b>adjacent</b> <b>controls.</b> To ascertain whether evidence exists to support or refute this claim, we conducted a systematic review of studies directly evaluating the electrical characteristics of acupuncture structures and appropriate controls. We searched seven electronic databases until August 2007, hand-searched references, and consulted technical experts. We limited the review to primary data human studies published in English. A quality scoring system was created and employed for this review. A total of 16 articles representing 18 studies met inclusion criteria: 9 examining acupuncture points and 9 examining meridians. Five out of 9 point studies showed positive association between acupuncture points and lower electrical resistance and impedance, while 7 out of 9 meridian studies showed positive association between acupuncture meridians and lower electrical impedance and higher capacitance.

40|$|The {{vegetation}} {{cover of a}} sand dune was surveyed {{ten years after the}} improvement of a restoration project that utilized seed sowing, seedling planting and seedling transplantation from an adjacent area with watering in the first months. On {{the upper part of the}} restored dune, the vegetation was sparse (53 %) but more developed than that of the <b>adjacent</b> <b>control</b> area (34 %), both presenting herbaceous/subshrub physiognomy with predominance of Panicum racemosum. On the slope of the restored dune, a shrub vegetation developed, presenting a percentage cover (90 %) similar to that of the control area (100 %). Dodonaea viscosa was the dominant species on this restored face. The establishment of arboreal and shrub species seedlings on the upper dune was good. In part, this improved the species richness, but contributed to dissimilarity between this area and the control site.   A lower species richness was presented on the slope and the similarity to the control area was even lower. Plants introduced by sowing and seedling transplantation showed success and contributed to the similarity with the adjacent vegetation. Seedlings of arboreal and shrub plants survived on the upper dune. These species are represented in a more developed stage of succession, differing from the <b>adjacent</b> <b>control</b> area...|$|E
