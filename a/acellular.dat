5|$|Cementum is a {{specialized}} bone like substance covering {{the root of}} a tooth. It is approximately 45% inorganic material (mainly hydroxyapatite), 33% organic material (mainly collagen) and 22% water. Cementum is excreted by cementoblasts within {{the root of the}} tooth and is thickest at the root apex. Its coloration is yellowish and it is softer than dentin and enamel. The principal role of cementum is to serve as a medium by which the periodontal ligaments can attach to the tooth for stability. At the cementoenamel junction, the cementum is <b>acellular</b> due to its lack of cellular components, and this <b>acellular</b> type covers at least ⅔ of the root. The more permeable form of cementum, cellular cementum, covers about ⅓ of the root apex.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, {{vaccine is}} {{administered}} {{along with the}} tetanus, diphtheria, and <b>acellular</b> pertussis vaccines (DTaP) and a pediatric dose of hepatitis B vaccine. In the UK, IPV is combined with tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis, and Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccines.|$|E
25|$|The {{concerns}} about side effects led Sato to introduce an even safer <b>acellular</b> vaccine for Japan in 1981 that was approved in the US in 1992 {{for use in}} the combination DTaP vaccine. The <b>acellular</b> vaccine has a rate of adverse events similar to that of a Td vaccine (a tetanus-diphtheria vaccine containing no pertussis vaccine).|$|E

25|$|In 1932 an {{outbreak}} of whooping cough hit Atlanta, Georgia, prompting pediatrician Leila Denmark to begin her study of the disease. Over {{the next six years}} her work was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, and in partnership with Emory University and Eli Lilly & Company, she developed the first pertussis vaccine. In 1942 American scientists Grace Eldering, Loney Gordon, and Pearl Kendrick combined the whole-cell pertussis vaccine with diphtheria and tetanus toxoids to generate the first DTP combination vaccine. To minimize the frequent side effects caused by the pertussis component, Japanese scientist Yuji Sato developed an <b>acellular</b> vaccine consisting of purified haemagglutinins (HAs: filamentous strep throat and leucocytosis-promoting-factor HA), which are secreted by B. pertussis. Sato's <b>acellular</b> pertussis vaccine was used in Japan starting in 1981. Later versions of the <b>acellular</b> vaccine in other countries consisted of additional defined components of B. pertussis and were often part of the DTaP combination vaccine.|$|E
25|$|<b>Acellular</b> {{cementum}} forms first. The cementoblasts {{differentiate from}} follicular cells, {{which can only}} reach {{the surface of the}} tooth's root once Hertwig's Epithelial Root Sheath (HERS) has begun to deteriorate. The cementoblasts secrete fine collagen fibrils along the root surface at right angles before migrating away from the tooth. As the cementoblasts move, more collagen is deposited to lengthen and thicken the bundles of fibers. Noncollagenous proteins, such as bone sialoprotein and osteocalcin, are also secreted. <b>Acellular</b> cementum contains a secreted matrix of proteins and fibers. As mineralization takes place, the cementoblasts move away from the cementum, and the fibers left along the surface eventually join the forming periodontal ligaments.|$|E
25|$|Two new {{vaccines}} {{were launched}} in 1992. These combined tetanus and diphtheria with <b>acellular</b> pertussis (TDaP or DTaP) {{which could be}} given to adolescents and adults (as opposed to previously when the vaccine was only given to children).|$|E
25|$|Both WHO and the CDC {{found that}} the <b>acellular</b> {{pertussis}} vaccines were effective at prevention of the disease, but had a limited impact on infection and transmission, meaning that vaccinated people could act as asymptomatic reservoirs of infection.|$|E
25|$|Tdap {{is given}} as a onetime, first time only dose that {{includes}} the tetanus, diphtheria, and <b>acellular</b> pertussis vaccinations. This should not be administered {{to those who are}} under the age of eleven or over the age of sixty-five.|$|E
25|$|In {{children}} under the age of seven, the tetanus vaccine is often administered as a combined vaccine, DPT/DTaP vaccine, which also includes vaccines against diphtheria and pertussis. For adults and children over seven, the Td vaccine (tetanus and diphtheria) or Tdap (tetanus, diphtheria, and <b>acellular</b> pertussis) is commonly used.|$|E
25|$|Descemet's {{membrane}} (also posterior limiting membrane): a thin <b>acellular</b> layer {{that serves}} as the modified basement membrane of the corneal endothelium, from which the cells are derived. This layer is composed mainly of collagen type IV fibrils, less rigid than collagen type I fibrils, and is around 5-20 μm thick, depending on the subject's age. Just anterior to Descemet's membare, a very thin and strong layer, Dua's layer, 15 microns thick and able to withstand 1.5 to 2 bars of pressure.|$|E
500|$|Thomas Cavalier-Smith, who has {{published}} {{extensively on the}} classification of protists, has recently proposed that the Neomura, the clade that groups together the Archaea and Eucarya, would have evolved from Bacteria, more precisely from Actinobacteria. His 2004 classification treated the archaeobacteria {{as part of a}} subkingdom of the Kingdom Bacteria, i.e. he rejected the three-domain system entirely. Stefan Luketa in 2012 proposed a five [...] "dominion" [...] system, adding Prionobiota (<b>acellular</b> and without nucleic acid) and Virusobiota (<b>acellular</b> but with nucleic acid) to the traditional three domains.|$|E
500|$|Myxogastria/Myxogastrea (myxogastrids, ICZN) or Myxomycetes [...] (ICBN), is a {{grouping}} of slime molds that contains 5 orders, 14 families, 62 genera and 888 species. They are colloquially {{known as the}} plasmodial or <b>acellular</b> slime moulds.|$|E
500|$|The Latin name Myxomycota {{comes from}} the Ancient Greek words [...] myxa, which means [...] "mucus", and [...] mykes, which means [...] "fungus". The name Myxogastria was {{introduced}} in 1970 by Lindsay Shepherd Olive to describe the family Myxogastridae, which was introduced in 1899 by Thomas Huston Macbride. Swedish mycologist Elias Magnus Fries described numerous slime moulds as Myxogasteres in 1829. Species in the class Myxomycota are colloquially known as plasmodial or <b>acellular</b> slime moulds. Some consider the Myxomycota [...] to be a separate kingdom, with an unsettled phylogeny because of conflicting molecular and developmental data. The relations among Myxogastrid orders are as yet unclear.|$|E
500|$|Many marine {{animals that}} float {{near the surface}} are highly transparent, giving them almost perfect camouflage. However, {{transparency}} is difficult for bodies made of materials that have different refractive indices from seawater. Some marine animals such as jellyfish have gelatinous bodies, composed mainly of water; their thick mesogloea is <b>acellular</b> and highly transparent. This conveniently makes them buoyant, but it also makes them large for their muscle mass, so they cannot swim fast, making this form of camouflage a costly trade-off with mobility. Gelatinous planktonic animals are between 50 and 90 percent transparent. A transparency of 50 percent {{is enough to make}} an animal invisible to a predator such as cod at a depth of better transparency is required for invisibility in shallower water, where the light is brighter and predators can see better. For example, a cod can see prey that are 98 percent transparent in optimal lighting in shallow water. Therefore, sufficient transparency for camouflage is more easily achieved in deeper waters.|$|E

2500|$|The {{origin of}} the {{formative}} cementoblasts {{is believed to be}} different for cellular cementum and <b>acellular</b> cementum. One of the major current hypotheses is that cells producing cellular cementum migrate from the adjacent area of bone, while cells producing <b>acellular</b> cementum arise from the dental follicle. [...] Nonetheless, it is known that cellular cementum is usually not found in teeth with one root. [...] In premolars and molars, cellular cementum is found only in the part of the root closest to the apex and in interradicular areas between multiple roots.|$|E
2500|$|Cementum {{formation}} is called cementogenesis and occurs {{late in the}} development of teeth. [...] Cementoblasts are the cells responsible for cementogenesis. Two types of cementum form: cellular and <b>acellular.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The {{multicomponent}} <b>acellular</b> pertussis {{vaccine is}} 71–85% effective, with greater effectiveness for more severe strains. Despite widespread vaccination, however, pertussis has persisted in vaccinated populations and is today [...] "one {{of the most}} common vaccine-preventable diseases in Western countries". The 21st-century resurgences in pertussis infections are attributed to a combination of waning immunity and bacterial mutations that elude vaccines.|$|E
2500|$|Bones {{consist of}} living cells {{embedded}} in a mineralized organic matrix. This matrix consists of organic components, mainly Type I collagen – [...] "organic" [...] referring to materials produced {{as a result of}} the human body – and inorganic components, primarily hydroxyapatite and other salts of calcium and phosphate. Above 30% of the <b>acellular</b> part of bone consists of the organic components, and 70% of salts. The collagen fibers give bone its tensile strength, and the interspersed crystals of hydroxyapatite give bone its compressive strength. These effects are synergistic.|$|E
2500|$|Bowman's layer (also {{known as}} the {{anterior}} limiting membrane): when discussed {{in lieu of a}} subepithelial basement membrane, Bowman's Layer is a tough layer composed of collagen (mainly type I collagen fibrils), laminin, nidogen, perlecan and other HSPGs that protects the corneal stroma. When discussed as a separate entity from the subepithelial basement membrane, Bowman's Layer can be described as an <b>acellular,</b> condensed region of the apical stroma, composed primarily of randomly organized yet tightly woven collagen fibrils. These fibrils interact with and attach onto each other. This layer is eight to 14 micrometres (μm) thick [...] and is absent or very thin in non-primates.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{inactive}} {{tetanus toxoid}} was discovered and produced in 1924. [...] A more effective adsorbed {{version of the}} vaccine, created in 1938, was proven to be successful when {{it was used to}} prevent tetanus in the military during World War II. DTP (which is the combined vaccine for diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis) was first used in 1948 and was continued until 1991 when it was replaced with an <b>acellular</b> form of the pertussis vaccine because of safety concerns. Half of those who received the DTP vaccine had redness, swelling, and pain around the injection site which convinced researchers to find a replacement vaccine.|$|E
2500|$|From this equation, {{it can be}} {{observed}} that if E is less than (1 − 1/R0), then {{it is impossible to}} eliminate a disease, even if the entire population is vaccinated. Similarly, waning vaccine-induced immunity, as occurs with <b>acellular</b> pertussis vaccines, requires higher levels of booster vaccination to sustain herd immunity. If a disease has ceased to be endemic to a population, then natural infections no longer contribute to a reduction in the fraction of the population that is susceptible. Only vaccination contribute to this reduction. The relation between vaccine coverage and effectiveness and disease incidence can be shown by subtracting the product of the effectiveness of a vaccine and the proportion of the population that is vaccinated, pv, from the herd immunity threshold equation as follows: ...|$|E
2500|$|Enamel is {{a highly}} mineralized <b>acellular</b> tissue, and caries act upon it through a {{chemical}} process {{brought on by the}} acidic environment produced by bacteria. [...] As the bacteria consume the sugar and use it for their own energy, they produce lactic acid. [...] The effects of this process include the demineralization of crystals in the enamel, caused by acids, over time until the bacteria physically penetrate the dentin. [...] Enamel rods, which are the basic unit of the enamel structure, run perpendicularly {{from the surface of the}} tooth to the dentin. [...] Since demineralization of enamel by caries, in general, follows the direction of the enamel rods, the different triangular patterns between pit and fissure and smooth-surface caries develop in the enamel because the orientation of enamel rods are different in the two areas of the tooth.|$|E
2500|$|Bone - {{being one}} of the most {{resistant}} materials to the process of fossilisation - often preserves internal detail, which allows the histology and growth of the scales to be studied in detail. The scales consist of a non-growing [...] "crown" [...] composed of dentine, with a sometimes-ornamented enameloid upper surface and an aspidine (<b>acellular</b> bony tissue) base. Its growing base is made of cell-free bone, which sometimes developed anchorage structures to fix it {{in the side of the}} fish. Beyond that, there appear to be five types of bone-growth, which may represent five natural groupings within the thelodonts - or a spectrum ranging between the end members, meta- (or ortho-) dentine and mesodentine tissues. Interestingly, each of the five scale morphs appears to resemble the scales of more derived groupings of fish, suggesting that thelodont groups may have been stem groups to succeeding clades of fish.|$|E
2500|$|Nanotechnology. Actin-myosin systems act as {{molecular}} motors {{that permit}} {{the transport of}} vesicles and organelles throughout the cytoplasm. It is possible that actin {{could be applied to}} nanotechnology as its dynamic ability has been harnessed in a number of experiments including those carried out in <b>acellular</b> systems. [...] The underlying idea is to use the microfilaments as tracks to guide molecular motors that can transport a given load. That is actin could be used to define a circuit along which a load can be transported in a more or less controlled and directed manner. In terms of general applications, it could be used for the directed transport of molecules for deposit in determined locations, which would permit the controlled assembly of nanostructures. [...] These attributes could be applied to laboratory processes such as on lab-on-a-chip, in nanocomponent mechanics and in nanotransformers that convert mechanical energy into electrical energy.|$|E
2500|$|Various fairly {{standardized}} {{abbreviations for}} vaccine names have developed, although the standardization {{is by no}} means centralized or global. For example, the vaccine names used in the United States have well-established abbreviations that are also widely known and used elsewhere. An extensive list of them provided in a sortable table and freely accessible, is available at a US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention web page. The page explains that [...] "The abbreviations [...] this table (Column 3) were standardized jointly by staff of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, ACIP Work Groups, the editor of the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR), the editor of Epidemiology and Prevention of Vaccine-Preventable Diseases (the Pink Book), ACIP members, and liaison organizations to the ACIP." [...] Some examples are [...] "DTaP" [...] for diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and <b>acellular</b> pertussis vaccine, [...] "DT" [...] for diphtheria and tetanus toxoids, and [...] "Td" [...] for tetanus and diphtheria toxoids. At its page on tetanus vaccination, the CDC further explains that [...] "Upper-case letters in these abbreviations denote full-strength doses of diphtheria (D) and tetanus (T) toxoids and pertussis (P) vaccine. Lower-case 'd' and 'p' denote reduced doses of diphtheria and pertussis used in the adolescent/adult-formulations. The 'a' in DTaP and Tdap stands for 'acellular,' meaning that the pertussis component contains only a part of the pertussis organism." [...] Another list of established vaccine abbreviations is at the CDC's page called [...] "Vaccine Acronyms and Abbreviations", with abbreviations used on U.S. immunization records. The United States Adopted Name system has some conventions for the word order of vaccine names, placing head nouns first and adjectives postpositively. This is why the USAN for [...] "OPV" [...] is [...] "poliovirus vaccine live oral" [...] rather than [...] "oral poliovirus vaccine".|$|E

50|$|Two {{kinds of}} {{cementum}} are formed: <b>acellular</b> and cellular, and fibers can be intrinsic or extrinsic, resulting in four possible permutations; the first cementum to be formed during tooth development is <b>acellular</b> extrinsic fiber cementum.

50|$|New <b>acellular</b> {{pertussis}} vaccines {{were developed}} in the 1980s, which included only a few selected pertussis antigens (toxins and adhesins). <b>Acellular</b> vaccines {{are less likely to}} provoke side effects.
