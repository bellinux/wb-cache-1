40|$|ABSTRACT: For {{the simple}} {{case of a}} homogeneous, {{isotropic}} plate with a single, symmetric pair of actuators, previous work by the authors has demonstrated the importance of including discrete layer kinematics in predicting the global response of the <b>actuated</b> <b>plate.</b> The inclusion of discrete layer kinematics permits accurate modeling of the so-called local kinematic effect, whereby {{a portion of the}} total actuation is diverted to the production of localized transverse shear deformation near the edges of the actuator, thus reducing the amount of actuation energy available to produce the desired global deformation mode. The present study expands upon this previous effort, investigating the magnitude of the local kinematic effect for more complex <b>actuated</b> <b>plates</b> involving fiber-reinforced laminated composite substrates with multiple symmetric pairs of actuators. The results obtained from finite element simulations using a wide range of kinematic assumptions conclusively demonstrate that as the actuated span-to-thickness ratio decreases, the models with discrete layer kinematics predict a smaller global response than the models that use equivalent-single-layer kinematics. Thus, the local kinematic effect is observed to influence the global response of the <b>actuated</b> <b>plates</b> regardless of the material constitution of the structural substrate and regardless of the in-plane spacing between actuator pairs.

40|$|The {{digitally}} reconfigurable {{surface is}} a pin based mechanism for creating physical threedimensional contoured surfaces {{from a computer}} aided design (CAD) input. When the digital design is properly downloaded into the device, a pin array is collectively actuated to the desired geometry. A rubber interpolation layer is held onto {{the tops of the}} pins by vacuum pressure to prevent undesired dimpling of the surface caused by the discrete nature of the pin array. Prior art in this field of reconfigurable pin tooling (RPT) surfaces have mostly involved using large diameter pins with conventional linear actuators behind each pin. Such devices have rarely been commercially viable as the surface area and resolution of the surface scales poorly with the number of actuators and cost. The digitally reconfigurable surface developed theoretically only requires a single mechanically <b>actuated</b> <b>plate,</b> regardless of scale or resolution (number of pins or diameter of pins). The device works by pulling all of the closely packed steel pins simultaneously in one direction via a magnetic moving plate, and as they move, pins are individually clutched and held in position by a novel fusible alloy clutch array, integrated with input circuitry. When the magnetic plate reaches the end of its stroke, all pins are in the proper configuration. The simplicity of this actuation method allows for improved scalability (resolution and area) and low manufacturing cost for the device. In addition, the phase changing clutch array, when coupled with notched or threaded pins, has an excellent holding strength allowing for many possible high pressure molding applications on surfaces generated. It is my hope that this research will one day pave the way for a practical, commercially available, reconfigurable pin-based forming tool. by Benjamin J. Peters. Thesis (S. B.)

40|$|Blast {{attacks have}} become the most {{pervasive}} threat in both civil and military contexts. However, there is currently a limited understanding of the mechanisms of loading, damage and failure of structures, and injury to humans produced by blast. This thesis seeks to advance our current understanding of the mechanisms of blast loading on structures. Towards this end, a comprehensive analytical and numerical study of basic problems in the interaction of blast waves with structures is conducted. The analysis is {{of interest in the}} conception of blast mitigation strategies and in the design and optimization of protection systems with improved performance against blast. The approach builds on a classic solution by G. I. Taylor on the interaction of acoustic blast waves with free-standing plates (In G. K. Batchelor, editor, The Scientific Papers of Sir Georey Ingram Taylor, vol. III, p. 287 - 303, Cambridge University Press, 1963). Taylor's analysis demonstrates that the coupled fluid-structure interaction eect can be exploited for the purpose of reducing the impulse transmitted from the blast to the structure. This basic result is not applicable to the case of air blasts due to non-linear compressibility effects. In this thesis, a number of extensions of Taylor's theory is proposed. The case of air blast waves interacting with free-standing plates of variable mass is given special attention. The limiting cases of extremely heavy and extremely light plates are explored analytically for arbitrary blast intensities, from where it is concluded that a modified non-dimensional parameter representing the mass of compressed fluid relative to the mass of the plate governs the fluid-structure interaction. (cont.) The intermediate asymptotic regimes are studied using a numerical method based on a Lagrangian formulation of the Euler equations of compressible ow and conventional shock-capturing techniques. Based on the analytical and numerical results, approximate formulae for the transmitted impulse describing the entire range of relevant conditions are proposed. The main conclusion of the theory is that non-linear fluid compressibility further enhances the beneficial effect selects of fluid-structure interaction in reducing the impulse transmitted to the structure. More specifically, it is found that impulse reductions due to fluid-structure interaction are more significant than in the acoustic limit when compared to those obtained ignoring fluid-structure interaction effect selects. In addition, a number of acoustic results for uniform shocks, viscoelastic supports, two fluid media, impulsively deployed and pressure <b>actuated</b> <b>plates</b> are proposed which provide the basis for evaluation of the benefits of the fluid-structure interaction {{in a wide variety of}} settings. The governing non-dimensional parameters in each specific context are determined and exact solutions to the fluid-structure interaction problem are provided. The results for the actively deployed plates reveal that significant cancellation of the blast impulse can be achieved thus suggesting a plausible blast mitigation strategy. by Nayden Kambouchev.

This is of interest in the case when surface bonded macro-fiber composites (MFC) actuators are employed as the actuation system.

40|$|AbstractIntelligent {{mechatronic}} systems, such as self-optimizing systems, {{allow an}} adaptation of the system behavior at runtime based on the current situation. To do so, they generally select among several pre-defined working points. A common method to determine working points for a mechatronic system is to use model-based multiobjective optimization. It allows finding compromises among conflicting objectives, called objective functions, by adapting parameters. To evaluate the system behavior for different parameter sets, {{a model of the}} system behavior is included in the objective functions and is evaluated during each function call. Intelligent mechatronic systems also have the ability to adapt their behavior based on their current reliability, thus increasing their availability, or on changed safety requirements; all of which are summed up by the common term dependability. To allow this adaptation, dependability can be considered in multiobjective optimization by including dependability-related objective functions. However, whereas performance-related objective functions are easily found, formulation of dependability-related objective functions is highly system-specific and not intuitive, making it complex and error-prone. Since each mechatronic system is different, individual failure modes have to be taken into account, which need to be found using common methods such as Failure-Modes and Effects Analysis or Fault Tree Analysis. Using component degradation models, which again are specific to the system at hand, the main loading factors can be determined. By including these in the model of the system behavior, the relation between working point and dependability can be formulated as an objective function. In our work, this approach is presented in more detail. It is exemplified using an actively <b>actuated</b> single <b>plate</b> dry clutch system. Results show that this approach is suitable for formulating dependability-related objective functions and that these can be used to extend system lifetime by adapting system behavior...|$|R

An optimization study is performed {{to identify the}} optimum combination of design parameters that maximizes the plate volume velocity for a given resonance frequency. Fifteen plates with various plate and actuator sizes, thicknesses, and bonding layers were fabricated and tested using results from the optimization study. A maximum equivalent piston displacement of 0. 39 mm was achieved with the optimized plate samples tested with only one actuator powered, corresponding to a plate deflection {{at the center of}} over 1 millimeter. This is very close to the deflection required for a full size engine application and represents a 160 -fold improvement over previous work. Experimental results further show that performance is limited by the critical stress of the piezoceramic actuator and bonding layer rather than by the maximum moment available from the actuator. Design enhancements are described in detail that will lead to a flight-worthy acoustic plate radiator by minimizing actuator tensile stresses and reducing nonlinear effects. Finally, several adaptive tuning methods designed to increase the bandwidth of acoustic plate radiators are analyzed including passive, active, and semi-active approaches. The back chamber pressurization and volume variation methods are investigated experimentally and shown to be simple and effective ways to obtain substantial control over the resonance frequency of a plate radiator. This study shows that piezoceramic-based plate radiators can be a viable acoustic source for active control of aircraft engine fan noise...|$|R
40|$|Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) combine {{high levels}} {{sensitivity}} and multifunctionality with small size and low power consumption. The major prime mover for MEMS {{industry in the}} past has been automobiles whereas consumer electronics (E. g. iPhones and Nintendo Wii) is the most important sector for growth now. With new focus on small scale energy harvesting from ambient vibration and air flow, MEMS have definitely entered a new generation. A significant factor propelling design and manufacturing is the need for reliable and robust computational tools. The basic skeleton of MEMS still remain suspended or anchored beams and <b>plates</b> <b>actuated</b> by electrical, electrostatic, thermal, magnetic or photonic mechanisms. This dissertation describes the simulation of coupled dynamics of thin MEMS actuated electrostatically and vibrating in a fluid medium. Although, only micro-beams are addressed here, the computational structure developed here can be directly used to address other forms of actuation or medium. A fully Lagrangian approach is developed to couple the electrostatic, fluidic and mechanical problem which is then solved using Newton's method. This approach eliminates the problems arising from remeshing and computing of derivatives of integrals over changing domain shapes. The mechanical problem is solved using finite element method (FEM) whereas the fluidic and electrostatic problems are tackled using the boundary element method (BEM). Severe numerical issues arise when dealing with very thin microstruc- tures (very high aspect ratio) for the BEM problem due to nearly singular integrals. A special BEM which addresses these problems has been developed for both the electrostatic and the fluidic problem. A singularity of mathematical nature arises at the free edge for the electrostatic BEM problem when dealing with cantilevers. This problem is solved by incorporating a singular element formulation for the electrostatic BEM. The resulting solution is compared with the case of simple extrapolation for some typical performance parameters. Finally, several possible extensions of current work like adapting the algorithm for nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS), computational acceleration using the fast multipole method (FMM) and quantifying uncertainty has been explained in the concluding chapter...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: Total Artificial Hearts (TAHs) act as {{a bridge}} to {{transplantation}} or destination therapy for patients with terminal heart insufficiency. Recirculation areas are prone to thrombus formation, especially for long-term applications. Therefore, inadequate pump washout results in excessive thromboembolic risk. In this study the TAH ReinHeart, a double chamber membrane pump <b>actuated</b> by pusher <b>plates,</b> is investigated. The rotational orientation of the bileaflet mechanical heart valve (MHV) at the inflow has {{a significant effect on}} the flow pattern within the pump volume during each pump cycle. Therefore, it is expected that the washout is also sensitive to the rotational orientation of the MHV. In order to determine optimal valve orientation regarding the washout of the volume a numerical two-phase Fluid-Structure-Interaction (FSI) model was developed. Materials & Methods: Complex membrane kinematics necessitated fully coupled 3 D FSI simulations to accurately predict the pumping process. A commercial partitioned block-GaussâSeidel coupling package was used. In order to achieve coupling stability (âartificial added mass effectâ), the interface artificial compressibility method was applied. The augmented Lagrange formulation was used to enforce the frictional contact conditions between the structural contact pairs. To maintain mesh quality and to prevent inversion of fluid elements in regions of large deformation, the mesh stiffness of the fluid elements was defined as a function of mesh properties. The preload was applied to the fluid inlet by using a fixed pressure opening, whereas the systolic afterload at the fluid outlet was modeled by combining a fixed relative pressure opening and a fluid resistance based on the DarcyâWeisbach equation. Independence tests were performed for the structural and the fluid mesh as well as the time step size and the number of pulse cycles. Validation of the FSI model was performed using stereo Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) measurements and high-speed recordings of the actual pump. In order to investigate the washout of the old blood by the new blood a homogeneous, immiscible two-phase flow model was used. The same non-Newtonian blood model was applied for both phases. Initially, the whole chamber was filled with fluid 1 (old blood). Several heart cycles with only fluid 1 entering the volume were simulated until pulse cycle independence was reached. Subsequently, fluid 2 (new blood) with a volume fraction of 1 was defined at the inlet. Four TAH geometries with 0 Â°, 45 Â°, 90 Â° and 135 Â° inlet valve orientation were created, where 0 Â° means that the MHV is oriented vertical to the chamber ceiling. The outlet valve was kept in the same orientation (0 Â°). The two-phase FSI model is currently applied to all geometries. Results: The flow fields and membrane motion correspond well with the PIV measurements and high-speed recordings, respectively For all valve orientations, at least three heart cycles were necessary to achieve adequate washout of the pump chamber volume. The remaining volume of fluid 1 in the chamber after three heart cycles was 0. 12 % and 0. 48 % for 0 Â° and 90 Â°, respectively. Remains of old blood can be observed mainly {{in the corner of the}} membrane and the housing opposite the inlet and outlet where velocities are low. Furthermore, washout quarter-time and washout half-time are currently compared for all geometries. Conclusions: The numerical two-phase Fluid-Structure-Interaction model was developed and is currently applied to investigate chamber washout of a Total Artificial Heart. Four geometries with different rotational orientations of the inlet MHV were created and are compared regarding washout efficiency. First results of this approach are promising concerning the detection of stagnant blood areas. Besides valve orientation, different heart valve types and chamber designs could be evaluated and compared in order to reduce the potential for thrombus formation. Furthermore, based on the washout efficiency as well as estimated stresses a design optimization of the chamber unit, pusher plate and membrane is possible...|$|R
