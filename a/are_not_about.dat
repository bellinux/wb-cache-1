25|$|Between {{the events}} of the two books, quite a bit has happened. Lorena, lover of Gus McCrae, has left Clara and married Pea Eye Parker, of the former Hat Creek Outfit. They have several children, and own a farm in the Texas Panhandle. Pea Eye is {{thoroughly}} devoted to Lorena, and Lorena has learned to reciprocate and become almost equally attached to Pea Eye. Lorena teaches in a nearby schoolhouse. The cattle ranch (set up by the Hat Creek outfit in Montana) has collapsed. Newt is dead, fallen on by the Hell Bitch. Call has finally admitted to himself that Newt was his son. July Johnson is dead, and Clara lives alone. Call has gone back to being a Ranger and a gun-for-hire. Trains have greatly expanded the reach of civilization and have pushed back the frontier. The American West is no longer rough and tumble and Captain Woodrow F. Call has become a relic, albeit a greatly respected one. Nineteen-year-old Joey Garza and his deadly German rifle (capable of killing a man at a distance of half a mile) <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>about</b> to let law and order close the book on the Wild West just yet.|$|E

While season three did indeed feature mainstream songs in its soundtrack, many of the songs were decades old.

40|$|In {{introducing}} the Association for Higher Education and Development (AHEAD) to the Ethiopian public through a communiqué published in Addis Tribune in 2000, {{we made the}} following bold statement: “The purpose of [our activities] <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>about</b> the past.

Our long-term objective is to coordinate and channel the resources, expertise and creativity of Ethiopians in the Diaspora toward development efforts in the motherland. ” AHEAD was thus established to contribute towards development efforts in Ethiopia by mobilizing, coordinating and channeling the necessary resources and relevant expertise to Ethiopian higher academic institutions. In addition to the programs that it runs {{in support of this}} mandate, AHEAD also seeks to mobilize Ethiopians in the diaspora and facilitate their contributions to, and role in, development undertakings in Ethiopia...|$|R
500|$|The initial albums were {{generally}} straightforward good versus evil adventure stories. However, thanks to Pierre Christin's interests in politics, sociology and ethnology, as the series progressed the situations typically arose from misunderstandings or ideological differences between various groups {{that could be}} resolved through reason and perseverance. The core theme of the stories is an optimistic liberal humanism: the adventures <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>about</b> defeating enemies but about exploring, facing challenges, and celebrating diversity. Thus, according to academic John Dean, Christin [...] "as a rule works into his narratives political, environmental and feminist concerns – thereby showing social ills are universal, no matter on what planet you land".|$|E
500|$|All {{of these}} new things {{entering}} my life are changing the way I view my purpose, but 'Dance in the Dark' in particular is about me wanting to live—but also, the song isn't called 'Dance in the Light'. I'm not a gospel singer trying to cross people over. What I'm saying is, 'I get it. I feel you, I feel the same way, and it's OK.' I {{hope and pray that}} I can inspire some sort of change in people subliminally through the show. They're singing 'Dance in the Dark,' but they're dancing and they're free, they're letting it out. But the songs <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>about</b> freedom, they're about [...] I get it. I feel the way you feel.|$|E
500|$|Another line of {{criticism}} of Belldandy relates to the sexual nature of the character, with Belldandy being described by one commentator as a [...] "soft porn goddess". Nevertheless, other commentators have observed that Belldandy might be , but writers such as Gilles Poitras note that the series—far from being soft porn—is in fact a very tender and romantic comedy: the characters {{do no more than}} simply kiss (and that infrequently) {{over the course of the}} series. Newitz suggests that part of the appeal of Oh My Goddess! is the romantic nature of the story: [...] "In anime, romantic love is possible because overt sexuality is not". According to Newitz the relationships in romantic anime, such as Oh My Goddess!, <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>about</b> consummation but about [...] "sexual innuendo and deferral".|$|E

500|$|The [...] "Lucy poems" [...] {{are written}} {{from the point}} of view of a lover who has long viewed the object of his affection from afar, and who is now {{affected}} by her death. Yet Wordsworth structured the poems so that they <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>about</b> any one person who has died; instead they were written about a figure representing the poet's lost inspiration. Lucy is Wordsworth's inspiration, and the poems as a whole are, according to Wordsworth biographer Kenneth Johnston, [...] "invocations to a Muse feared dead". Lucy is represented in all five poems as sexless; it is unlikely that the poet ever realistically saw her as a possible lover. Instead, she is presented as an ideal and represents Wordsworth's frustration at his separation from Coleridge; the asexual imagery reflects the futility of his longing.|$|E
500|$|A {{comeback}} of The KLF was {{implied by}} two black-and-white full-page adverts {{placed in the}} 21 August 1997 issue of Time Out. The first proclaimed [...] "They're Back. The Creators of Trance. The Lords of Ambient. The Kings of Stadium House. The Godfathers of Techno Metal. The Greatest Rave Band In The World. Ever! 2K. For 23 minutes Only". [...] The second stated [...] "'Jeremy Deller presents '1997 What The Fuck's Going On'", a reference to The JAMs' debut album 1987 (What the Fuck Is Going On?). [...] It continued, [...] "Jimmy Cauty and Bill Drummond invite you to a 23 minute performance during which the next 840 days of our lives will be discussed". The Independent {{looked forward to the}} event, saying that [...] "It {{was just a matter of}} time before Jimmy Cauty and Bill Drummond hatched another prank and put a grin back on the face of pop music." [...] "You just ache for them to be No. 1 again....", they said, but [...] "One hopes they <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>about</b> to shoot themselves in the foot" [...] because [...] "the idea walks the tightrope between lunacy and brilliance.... the pop world's countdown to the millennium surely starts here".|$|E
500|$|Final Destination films, for {{the film}} and media studies scholar Eugenie Brinkema, are {{characterized}} by their {{move away from the}} typical horror antagonist and towards the certainty and inevitability of death. This makes the films inconsistent with many analyses of horror, according to which horror films require a monster. Final Destination films depart from other horror films, and even other horror films aimed at teens, in that they feature [...] "no families, no repression; no psychic, geographic, or domestic hauntings; and no sexuality—neither the pursuit of pleasure in the slasher convention of easy bodily access nor the monstrosity of sexual difference". The films, Brinkema argues, <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>about</b> the seeking of pleasure, as are paradigmatic slashers, but are instead about the avoidance of pain and death; they are [...] "constitutively bitter, anhedonic, paranoid, and sad". In the films, death becomes its own cause; the premonition of the roller-coaster derailment in Final Destination 3 is without context or cause, but the fact that some characters are able to avoid the death they would have had grounds the necessity of their deaths, in the order that they would have died on the roller coaster. Thus, [...] "Death's list" [...] or [...] "Death's design" [...] is realized. Final Destination 3 spends as much time interpreting deaths as displaying them. Wendy's close analysis of photographs allows her to come to understand the deaths, but is inevitably too late. In the franchise's films, Brinkema says, [...] "one must closely read to survive (for a spell), and yet reading changes absolutely nothing at all". Thus, the characters [...] "might as well" [...] have stayed on the roller coaster.|$|E

2500|$|... “The [...] was mysterious for the Indians." [...] It {{was good}} when the Indians {{did not know}} the ways of the white man. It made the Indians like one family. Bad Indians could not become Hunka. It was not the white man’s way of teaching. Sometimes many Indians camped {{together}} to perform the ceremony. Then there were good times. This was usually in the summer time. The winter was not a good time for the ceremony, because food was not plenty during the winter. When many Indians gathered together for the ceremony, the old men counseled and the young men played games. The women provided plenty to eat. The children were happy and were never hungry. The young people made lover. Many sought a vision, and talked with the spirits. The good spirits attended such gatherings. The bad spirits also come. The Lakotas here practiced this ceremony for many years. It was not always the same. The shamans first learned how to perform it right. These shamans became Oglalas. The other Lakota learned how to perform it from the Oglalas. Other Indians are Hunkas, but they are not full Hunkas like the Oglalas. The young people do not become Hunka now. It is of no use to them. The old people do not pay attention to the Hunka now. The Hunka are not what they were in old times. Some old Indians could perform the ceremony right. An old Indian who wears the gee string and leggings could perform it. He might be afraid to talk like the Indians did before they lived on a reservation. It would not be right to teach the young Indians what was taught to the Hunka in old times. There are some secret things taught to a Hunka. These secrets are not good now. They <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>about</b> the spirits. The spirits will not come now. These are the spirits of the skies of the Earth, of the clouds, of the Thunder, of the land of pines, of the coming light of the sunset of the south, of the winds, of the waters, of flying things, of the beasts, of the insects, and of the spider. There are bad spirits also. There are ghosts and the man from the land of the pines. One spirit is stronger than another. One spirit is chief, and can influence all other spirits. These spirits come no more to the Indians of the reservation. It involved things that would not be allowed now. The Oglala did not think these things were wrong, but the white people do. For example a Hunka was taught how to steal horses and steal women from other Indians than Lakota.” “White men have their Bible and their Christ to guide them to the life to come. We Indians have our White Cow traditions and brave deeds. Let us wait, my friend, and see who gets there first.” ...|$|E
