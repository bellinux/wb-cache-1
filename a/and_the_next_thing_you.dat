500|$|Considering Kiedis had resumed heavy {{drug use}} and Frusciante was no longer present for collaboration, songs were written at a far slower rate. Working with Frusciante had been {{something}} Kiedis took for granted: [...] "John Frusciante had been a true anomaly {{when it came to}} song writing. He made it even easier than Hillel Slovak to create music, even though I'd known Hillel for years. I just figured that was how all guitar players were, that you showed them your lyrics and sang a little bit <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> knew you had a song. That didn't happen right off the bat with Dave." [...] Drummer Chad Smith suggested it was writer's block that was holding Kiedis back from coming up with lyrics, however Kiedis strongly denied this. With the writing process taking too much time and Kiedis returning to his drug habit, Flea {{for the first time on}} any of the band's albums, besides contributing music as usual, took over and wrote some of the song's lyrics, including [...] "Transcending", his tribute to River Phoenix along with the intro and outro to [...] "Deep Kick", a song that told the story of his and Kiedis's youth. [...] Also for the first time on any album, Flea contributed lead vocals which he performed on his solo track titled [...] "Pea".|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{this winter}} regimen, Kazmir began the {{season on the}} {{disabled}} list with hamstring and shoulder issues. He made his first start on April 15, a loss to the Yankees. His struggles continued throughout {{the first half of the}} season, as he posted the worst ERA among starters in the AL (6.92) along with a 7â€“9 record. Quoted in the Los Angeles Times in July, Kazmir said [...] "It kind of feels like I'm thinking too much about where I'm throwing the ball and things start snowballing, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> know you don't really know what's going on." ...|$|E
2500|$|Owen said he grew {{up around}} [...] "a mob of entertaining, troublesome, fascinating" [...] actors {{involved}} in challenging the Lord Chamberlain during {{some of the most}} exciting days of a very controversial Royal Court Theatre. When he was at Highgate School, because his father was an actor, his teachers thought that {{he should be able to}} act, too. However, at first he was not interested. [...] "I was always made to read plays at school but I never wanted to. Then I was made to take part in a school play and I didn't want to do that either but I started to get approval for my acting. I was reasonably academic, good at sport, but somehow with the acting, people said 'that was fantastic'. So I thought,'Ok, I'll carry on doing this for a bit <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> know that's how I make my living these days".|$|E

2500|$|Tritt is {{a member}} of the Republican Party and {{supported}} George W. Bush for President in 2000. The two met in 1996 at the Republican National Convention in San Diego, California, where Tritt sang the national anthem. Tritt told Insight on the News, that he is a strong supporter of Second Amendment rights and believes the answer to crime is not gun control but criminal control. [...] "I'm a pro-gun guy. I'm an NRA National Rifle Association member, a life member as a matter of fact. I'm more for the belief of making the punishment tougher for the criminals to start with. I think that sends much more of an incentive for people to not commit crimes of any type than taking away guns. Because you take away guns, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> know, stabbing murders are going to increase." [...] He adds that he is [...] "definitely pro-death penalty." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "(O'Hare) {{was a great}} swimmer and spear fisherman, and {{he insisted}} that the {{squadron}} swim with him. Swimming with Butch O'Hare meant that at eight o'clock in the morning, you swam out into the ocean off Maui; he would still be out there {{at three in the}} afternoon! If he got hungry, Butch would roll over and dive, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> knew, he would come up with a fish of some sort. Then he'd just roll over and lie on his back like an otter and eat the thing raw! He really impressed us with that! One day, he came back to the surface with an octopus draped over his arm. He said, 'Now, you {{have to learn how to}} kill these things, boys: you bite 'em right behind the eye.' And with that, he chomped down! The octopus has some sort of spinal cord there, and biting it there does kill it! Then we had to go back to the beach where Butch would put these things in a frying pan with a little oil and some salt and stir them around. He enjoyed them, but they tasted like old rubber tires to me!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Navarro's joining and Kiedis's {{continued}} {{drug addiction}} {{had a profound}} effect on the band and the subsequent sound of their next album, One Hot Minute (1995). With Frusciante no longer present for collaboration, songs were written at a far slower rate. Working with Frusciante had been something Kiedis took for granted: [...] "John had been a true anomaly when it came to song writing. He made it even easier than Hillel to create music, even though I'd known Hillel for years. I just figured that was how all guitar players were, that you showed them your lyrics and sang a little bit <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> knew you had a song. That didn't happen right off the bat with Dave." [...] To compensate, Kiedis and bassist Flea took several vacations together, during which entire songs were conceived and with Kiedis often absent from recording due to his drug problems or struggling to come up with lyrics, Flea took a much bigger role in the writing process; coming up with ideas for many songs including full lyrics and even singing lead on his own song, [...] "Pea".|$|E

6000|$|Hoop! if ever you DID try a leap! Out go your legs, out fling your arms, off goes your hat; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> feel--that is, I did--is a most {{tremendous}} thwack {{across the}} chest, and my feet jerked {{out of the}} stirrups: me left in {{the branches of a}} tree; Trumpeter gone clean from under me, and walloping and floundering in the ditch underneath. One of the stirrup-leathers had caught in a stake, and the horse couldn't get away: and neither of us, I thought, ever WOULD have got away: but all of a sudden, who should come up the lane but the Spicy Dustman! ...|$|E
60|$|Carl, {{absorbed in}} {{watching}} a spider spinning its web at the window, {{did not notice}} Faith's legs. She walked home with her father after church and he never noticed them. She got on the hated striped stockings before Jerry and Una arrived, so that {{for the time being}} none of the occupants of the manse knew what she had done. But nobody else in Glen St. Mary was ignorant of it. The few who had not seen soon heard. Nothing else was talked of {{on the way home from}} church. Mrs. Alec Davis said it was only what she expected, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> would see some of those young ones coming to church with no clothes on at all. The president of the Ladies' Aid decided that she would bring the matter up at the next Aid meeting, and suggest that they wait in a body on the minister and protest. Miss Cornelia said that she, for her part, gave up. There was no use worrying over the manse fry any longer. Even Mrs. Dr. Blythe felt a little shocked, though she attributed the occurrence solely to Faith's forgetfulness. Susan could not immediately begin knitting stockings for Faith because it was Sunday, but she had one set up before any one else was out of bed at Ingleside the next morning.|$|E
60|$|At last, I fell asleep, {{dreaming about}} Harry {{fighting}} a duel of dice-boxes with the military-looking man below; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> I knew, was {{the glare of}} a light before my eyes, and Harry himself, very pale, stood before me.|$|R

He only saw.|$|R

60|$|There {{was some}} {{consultation}} {{here in a}} low voice, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> Richard heard distinctly was, {{that one of the}} Nobles held up a silver chain and key, {9} saying that they had been found on <b>the</b> Duke's neck, <b>and</b> that he had kept them, thinking that they doubtless led to something of importance.|$|R

5000|$|.....We're {{talking about}} my {{personal}} story and his personal story, and there's also a layer of pop culture that {{plays a role in}} the lyrics of the song.
