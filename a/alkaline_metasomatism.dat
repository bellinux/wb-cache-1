This sequence has normal stratigraphic stacking and comprises three units:the lower Lagoa da Prata carbonate schist, the intermediate Bom Sucesso BIF {{and the upper}} Tabuãozinho schist. U-Pbdetrital zircon data from samples of the Lagoa da Prata unit indicate a maximum age of deposition of 2603 ± 7. 3 Ma, correlatedwith the basal Caraça Group of the Minas Supergroup.

40|$|Peridotitic garnet xenocrysts from 33 Group II and 29 Group I kimberlites {{have been}} used to map the lithospheric mantle along a {{southwest}} to northeast traverse across the Kaapvaal Craton in South Africa. A minimum age difference of 10 m. y. exists between the Group II and Group I kimberlites in this region, and the compositions of their respective garnet xenocryst suites can define changes in mantle composition over this time interval. Depths of origin for each garnet were derived empirically using the garnet geotherm method. The location of each grain was then projected onto a cross-section. Using a gridding algorithm, the vertical and lateral distribution of Ti, Zr and Zr/Y in the garnets and the calculated XMg of coexisting olivine are contoured for the cross-section. The resulting images show that significant changes occurred in the lithospheric mantle beneath the craton between the emplacements of the two groups of kimberlites. The nature of these changes defines three domains with different metasomatic styles along the cross-section, recognisable by different geochemical signatures in garnet. In the southwest Prieska domain, metasomatism was dominated by interaction of the lithosphere with mafic silicate melts, resulting in garnets with high Ti, Fe and Zr, and low Zr/Y. In the central Kimberley domain, metasomatic signatures consistent with the interaction of the host peridotite with a hydrous, highly <b>alkaline</b> fluid (phlogopite-style <b>metasomatism)</b> are most commonly observed, resulting in high Zr and high Zr/Y, but low Ti and moderate Fe. In the northeastern Swartruggens domain, a high-Fe signature, probably related to the intrusion of the Bushveld complex, predates further phlogopite-style metasomatism during the Group II/Group I interval. Changes in the thermal structure of the lithosphere between kimberlite groups indicate that metasomatism by mafic fluids involves heating, but phlogopite-style metasomatism does not. 10 page(s...|$|R

Trends in P- Fe# - CaO - fO 2 for minerals from the porphyritic kimberlite show greater discontinuities than xenocrysts from the breccia. Xenoliths show the widest variation at all pressures. Protokimberlite systems {{are marked by}} ilmenite PT points that range from the lithosphere base (7. 5 GPa) to a pyroxenite lens situated at intermediate depths (5 - 3. 5 GPa) with increasing Cr because of AFC that formed two metasomatic groups with differing Fe#Ol (∼ 10 - 12 and 13 - 15). The first Opx-Gar-based mantle geotherm for the Alakit field based on 10 mineral associations {{is close to the}} 35 mW/m 2 geotherm at 6. 5 GPa and 600 °C, i. e. near to the Moho. The oxidation state for the megacrystalline ilmenites in the lithosphere base is higher than for other kimberlites in Yakutia. Calculated parental melts for clinopyroxene and garnet by xenocrysts from the breccia show highly inclined linear REE patterns with deep HFSE troughs similar to differentiated protokimberlite magmas. Melts calculated for metasomatic xenoliths have less inclined slopes without troughs in spider diagrams. Garnets reveal S-shaped REE patterns. Calculated melts for garnets from graphite-bearing Cr-websterites located mainly in middle part of the mantle column show slightly inclined convex REE patterns and Ba-Sr troughs with variable enrichment in Nb-Ta-U. The calculated parental melts for clinopyroxenes have inclined REE spectra with a depression in HFSE. Metasomatic clinopyroxenes have enriched patterns with Ba, Zr peaks. 40 Ar- 39 Ar analyses of dispersed phlogopites from the Alakit mantle xenoliths yield a Proterozoic (1154 Ma) age, corresponding to continental arc <b>metasomatism.</b> <b>Alkaline</b> and Ti-rich veins with alkali amphiboles close to richterite formed at ∼ 1015 Ma and mark a plume event in Rodinia mantle.

40|$|Abstract [...] Dioctahedral {{vermiculite}} {{occurs in}} an isolated metagabbro klippe (Kuranqah Metagabbro) that belongs to the Central Anatolian Ophiolites from central Turkey. Both the metagabbro and the structurally underlying high-grade metamorphic rocks are intruded by granitic rocks. The Kuranqah Metagabbro is characterized by its well-developed compositional layering, {{and the presence of}} vermiculitized phlogopite-rich layers. Petrographic and mineralogic studies how that the primary mineral phases in the host rock are diopside, tschermakitic hornblende, Fe-rich phlogopite, and plagioclase. Secondary minerals are horn-blende, actinolitic hornblende, Fe-rich phlogopite, and vermiculite. A two-phase history of alteration involving acidic weathering and <b>alkaline</b> <b>metasomatism</b> is suggested for the dioctahedral vermiculite and secondary Fe-rich phlogopite, respectively. The alteration of phlogopite to dioctahedral vermiculite pro-ceeded both along cleavage planes and at crystal edges. The vermiculite is colorless to pale yellow with weak pleochroism and shows optical continuity with the parent mineral. Vermiculite flakes, analyzed semi-quantitatively b scanning electron microscope-energy dispersive analysis (SEM-EDS) and electron microprobe (EMP), are characterized by partially expanded interlayers, K depletion, and Mg and/or A 1 enrichment. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and differential thermal analysis-thermal gravimetric (DTA-TG) analyses indicate that phlogopite is not a pure phase, although it is the dominant one. The XRD patterns show the presence of both dioctahedral vermiculite having dehydrated interlayers and hydroxy-A 1 inter-layers, and interstratified phlogopite-vermiculite. The transformation of phlogopite to vermiculite is thought o represent an initial stage of weathering in an acidic environment...|$|E
40|$|The {{petrology}} of peridotite xenoliths in the Cenozoic volcanics from Greene Point (Northern Victoria Land, Antarctica) provides new {{constraints on}} the characterisation of the lithospheric mantle beneath the West Antarctic Rift. Based on mineral major and trace element models, this mantle domain is proposed to represent a residuum after 10 % and 20 % partial melting. Moreover, melting models and isotopic results for Sr and Nd systematics highlight the substantial contribution of tholeiitic melts percolating through peridotites. Close correlation with trace element contents in clinopyroxene phenocrysts from Ferrar and Karoo tholeiites allows us to ascribe this refertilisation event to the Jurassic. This asthenospheric melt was also able to transfer a garnet signature to the Northern Victoria Land mantle segment. The rare presence of glass and secondary phases indicate that Greene Point xenoliths were heterogeneously affected by <b>alkaline</b> <b>metasomatism,</b> probably related to the West Antarctic Rift System opening; this has also been widely observed in other Northern Victoria Land localities (i. e., Baker Rocks). Temperature and fO 2 were calculated (950 °C; δlog fO 2 (QFM), - 1. 70 to - 0. 39) at a fixed pressure of 15 kbar, confirming the tendency of the anhydrous Greene Point xenolith population to have higher equilibration temperatures and comparable redox conditions, compared to the nearby amphibole-bearing peridotites from Baker Rocks.

40|$|Madagascar {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} gem-producing countries in the world, including ruby and sapphires. Gem corundum deposits formed at different stages in the geological evolution of the island and in contrasting environments. Four main settings are identified: (1) Gem corundum formed in the Precambrian basement within the Neoproterozoic terranes of southern Madagascar, and in the volcano-sedimentary series of Beforona, north of Antananarivo. In the south, high-temperature (700 to 800 &# 176;C) and low-pressure (4 to 5 kbar) granulites contain deposits formed during the Pan-African orogenesis between 565 and 490 Ma. They accompany mafic and ultramafic complexes (ruby deposits of the Vohibory group), skarns at the contact between Anosyan granites and the Proterozoic Tranomaro group (sapphire deposits of the Tranomaro–Andranondambo district), and shear-zone corridors cross-cutting feldspathic gneisses, cordieritites and clinopyroxenites in the Tranomaro, Vohimena and Androyan metamorphic series (biotite schist deposits of Sahambano and Zazafotsy, cordieritites of Iankaroka and Ambatomena). The circulation of fluids, especially along discontinuities, allowed in-situ <b>alkaline</b> <b>metasomatism,</b> forming corundum host rocks related to desilicified granites, biotitites, “sakenites” and “corundumites”. (2) Gem corundum also occurs in the Triassic detrital formations of the Isalo group, as giant palaeoplacers in the Ilakaka–Sakaraha area. Here, sapphires and rubies may come from the metamorphic granulitic terranes of southern Madagascar. (3) Gem corundum deposits occur within the Neogene-Quaternary alkali basalts from Ankaratra (Antsirabe–Antanifotsy area) and in the Ambohitra Province (Nosy Be, Ambato and Ambondromifehy districts). Primary deposits are rare, except at Soamiakatra where ruby in gabbroic and clinopyroxenite xenoliths within alkali-basalts probably derive from mantle garnet peridotites. The blue-green-yellow sapphires typical of basaltic fields are always recovered in palaeoplacer (in karst formed upon Jurassic limestones from the Montagne d'Ambre, Antsiranana Province) and alluvial and soil placers (Ankaratra volcanic massif). (4) Deposits occur within Quaternary eluvial, colluvial and alluvial concentrations, such as high-quality rubies from the Andilamena and Vatomandry deposits...|$|E
40|$|Detailed petrological and geochemical {{investigations}} of an extensive sampling of mantle xenoliths from the Neogene–Quaternary Bir Ali diatreme (southern Yemen) {{indicate that the}} underlying lithospheric mantle consists predominantly of medium- to fine-grained (often foliated) spinel-peridotites (85 – 90 %) and spinel-pyroxenites (10 – 15 %) showing thermobarometric estimates in the P–T range of 0. 9 – 2. 0 GPa and 900 – 1150 °C. Peridotites, including lherzolites, harzburgites and dunites delineate continuous chemical, modal and mineralogical variations compatible with large extractions of basic melts occurring since the late Proterozoic (~ 2 Ga, according to Lu–Hf model ages). Pyroxenites may represent intrusions of subalkaline basic melts interacting and equilibrated with the host peridotite. Subsequent metasomatism has led to modal changes, with evidence of reaction patches and clinopyroxene and spinel destabilization, as well as formation of new phases (glass, amphibole and feldspar). These changes are accompanied by enrichment of the most incompatible elements and isotopic compositions. 143 Nd/ 144 Nd ranges from 0. 51419 to 0. 51209 (εNd from + 30. 3 to − 10. 5), 176 Hf/ 177 Hf from 0. 28459 to 0. 28239 (εHf from + 64. 4 to − 13. 6), and 208 Pb/ 204 Pb from 36. 85 to 41. 56, thus extending from the depleted mantle (DM) towards the enriched OIB mantle (EM and HIMU) components. 3 He/ 4 He (R/RA) ratios vary from 7. 2 to 7. 9 with He concentrations co-varying with the most incompatible element enrichment, in parallel with metasomatic effects. These metasomatic events, particularly effective in harzburgites and dunites, are attributable to the variable interaction with alkaline basic melts related to the general extensional and rifting regime affecting the East Africa–Arabian domain during the Cenozoic. In this respect, Bir Ali mantle xenoliths resemble those occurring along the Arabian margins and the East Africa Rift system, similarly affected by <b>alkaline</b> <b>metasomatism,</b> whereas they are distinctly different from xenoliths located within the Ethiopian–Yemen continental flood basalt province that are pervasively refertilized by plume-related subalkaline melts...|$|E
40|$|Effects of mafic <b>alkaline</b> <b>metasomatism</b> {{have been}} {{investigated}} by a combined study of the East Serbian mantle xenoliths and their host alkaline rocks. Fertile xenoliths and tiny mineral assemblages found in depleted xenoliths {{have been investigated}}. Fertile lithologies are represented by clinopyroxene (cpx) -rich lherzolite and spinel (sp) -rich olivine websterite containing Ti–Al-rich Cr-augite, Fe-rich olivine, Fe–Al-rich orthopyroxene and Al-rich spinel. Depleted xenoliths, which are the predominant lithology in the suite of East Serbian xenoliths, are harzburgite, cpx-poor lherzolite and rare Mg-rich dunite. They contain small-scale assemblages occurring as pocket-like, symplectitic or irregular, deformation-assisted accumulations of metasomatic phases, generally composed of Ti–Al- and incompatible element-rich Cr-diopside, Cr–Fe–Ti-rich spinel, altered glass, olivine, apatite, ilmenite, carbonate, feldspar, and a high-TiO 2 (c. 11 wt%) phlogopite. The fertile xenoliths are too rich in Al, Ca and Fe to simply represent undepleted mantle. By contrast, their composition can be reproduced {{by the addition of}} 5 – 20 wt% of a basanitic melt to refractory mantle. However, textural relationships found in tiny mineral assemblages inside depleted xenoliths imply the following reaction: opx+sp 1 (primary mantle Cr-spinel) ±phlogopite+Si-poor alkaline melt=Ti–Al-cpx+sp 2 (metasomatic Ti-rich spinel) ±ol±other minor phases. Inversion modelling, performed on the least contaminated and most isotopically uniform host basanites (87 Sr/ 86 Sr=c. 0. 7031; 143 Nd/ 144 Nd=c. 0. 5129), implies a source that was enriched in highly and moderately incompatible elements (c. 35 – 40 × chondrite for U–Th–Nb–Ta, 2 × chondrite for heavy rare earth elements (HREE), made up of clinopyroxene, carbonate (c. 5 %), and traces of ilmenite (c. 1 %) and apatite (c. 0. 05 %). A schematic model involves: first, percolation of CO 2 - and H 2 O-rich fluids and precipitation of metasomatic hydrous minerals; and, second, the subsequent breakdown of these hydrous minerals due to the further uplift of hot asthenospheric mantle. This model links intraplate alkaline magmatism to lithospheric mantle sources enriched by sublithospheric melts at some time in the past...|$|E
40|$|Anhydrous and amphibole-bearing mantle {{peridotite}} xenoliths from Kapfenstein (Styrian Basin) {{have been}} studied {{with the aim of}} understanding both the processes responsible for amphibole formation and the nature of metasomatizing agents which affected this portion of lithosphere. This area of the Pannonian Basin underwent a subduction event which was followed after about 15 Ma, by alkaline intraplate magmatism. Primary clinopyroxene (cpx 1) in four-phase lherzolite xenoliths is characterized by LREE-depleted to slightly LREE-enriched patterns. LREE-depleted cpx 1 have low Th and U contents and Zr (and Hf) anomalies varying from slightly negative to positive. LREE-enriched cpx have high Th and U contents and remarkable positive anomalies of Zr and Hf. Primary clinopyroxenes in amphibole-bearing lherzolites present a comparable compositional variation from LREE (and Th, U, Zr, Hf) -depleted type to LREE (and Th, U, Zr, Hf) -enriched type. LREE-depleted cpx 1, with strong negative Zr and Ti anomalies, are also recognized in the peridotite matrix of a composite sample cut by a large amphibole vein. Textural and geochemical evidence indicates that amphibole disseminated within the matrix grew at the expense of primary spinel and clinopyroxene, mimicking the trace element patterns of the latter. As a consequence, the geochemical features of amphibole vary in relation to those of clinopyroxene, from enriched to depleted. On the other hand, the composition of vein amphibole in the composite xenolith compares well with amphibole megacrysts and microphenocrysts, suggesting that it represents a fractionation product of alkaline melt that passed through the lithosphere. Two kinds of metasomatism, superimposed on a slightly depleted lithospheric mantle, were identified. A slab-derived melt (proto-adakite?) metasomatic agent was responsible for the first enrichment in Th, U, Zr and Hf observed in clinopyroxene, whereas an alkaline within-plate metasomatic agent caused the formation of the Nb (and Ta) - rich disseminated amphibole. The final process was the alkaline magmatism, which was responsible for the formation of the large amphibole vein and megacrysts. It is proposed that the Nb-poor and Nb-rich amphiboles record the transition between the suprasubduction slab melt-related and the intraplate <b>alkaline</b> <b>metasomatism.</b> These geochemical features are consistent with a lithospheric portion enriched in slab melt components which was subsequently metasomatized by alkaline melt. Alternatively an asthenospheric uprising could have scavenged a previously slab melt-enriched region of the lithosphere. (C) 2006 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|The tin- bearing granites in the State of Goias, Brazil, form {{two groups}} of {{different}} ages: 1770 My for the Sucuri and Soledade massifs, 1658 - 1614 My. for the Serra Dourada, Serra da Mesa and Serra Branca massifs. The geology of the province suggests that these granites were emplaced in a rift context. The Sucuri and Soledade massifs are emplaced in gneisses of Archean age, the others massifs are intrusive in the Serra da Mesa Group, a sedimentary formation composed of pelites and greywackes. This Group was metamorphosed in the amphibolite facies (kyanite- almandine- biotite paragenesis). According to several thermobarometric tools, the temperature was around 540 °C and the pressure between 5 and 7 kBar. The age of the sediments {{is supposed to be}} lower Proterozoic, in accordance with the age proposed for the Serra Dourada massif (1653 My [...] The Serra Dourada massif is composed of four rock types. The petrographic, mineralogic observations and geochemical data reveal a main trend, composed of an amphibole- bearing facies, a biotite- bearing facies, and a fine grained porphyritic facies.. Garnet- bearing granites do not show any relations with the main trend. The contents of these granites in Nb, Y, Zr, Ce, La, Ga, and their MgO/TiO 2 ratio (around 1) {{are similar to those of}} the anorogenic granites of South Western United States and Gabo suite of Australia. However, niobium shows a compatible behaviour in Serra Dourada, in contrast to its incompatible behaviour in many anorogenic granites [...] . // [...] . The compositional variations of the beryllium minerals observed in skarns may be explained by the following processes : -either a late arrival of silica- rich solutions (high Si/Al ratio, presence of phenacite or helvite) within early formed alumina- rich parageneses (musgravite, chrysoberyl), - or a limited mobility of Al relatively to Si, which would induce a limited extension of the aluminous parageneses (musgravite, chrysoberyl). The activity of aluminum plays an essential role in the stability of the beryllium minerals : phenacite and/or helvite are stable when it is low, and beryl, chrysoberyl or musgravite when it is high. However, the increase of activity of other elements (Ca, Mn, Fe, Zn, alkalis) that would induce the formation of minerals incorporating alumina (garnet or felspars) would be unfavourable to the formation of beryl. Helvite is thus typically stable in calcic skarns, and it is associated with phenacite in the rocks submitted to <b>alkaline</b> <b>metasomatism.</b> Beryl, on the contrary, normally appears when acidic fluids separates from highly evolved granitic magmas (aplopegmatitic stage). The zonation of helvite crystals in albitites (genthelvite core, danalite border) reflects the decrease of alkalinity of the fluids. This zonation on the crystal scale is also observed on the outcrop scale: helvite composition varies from Ge 64 Da 10 He 26 in the internal zone to Ge 23 Da 50 He 26, in the external zone. The same variation is observed in an albitized siderophyllite vein, from Ge 25 Da 42 He 33 in a slightly albitized zone to Ge 55 Da 39 He 22 in a highly albitized one. The formation of genthelvite is favoured, as compared with the other members of the helvite group, by alkaline conditions. The compositional variations of helvite in the Sucuri massif would result from variations in fs 2 and f 02, in the fluids. Genthelvite is stable under alkaline and oxidizing conditions. Les granites stannifères de l'état de Goias forment deux groupes d'âge different. Les massifs de Sucuri et de Soledade ont un âge de 1770 Ma et les massifs de Serra Dourada, Serra da Mesa et Serra Branca ont respectivement 1653, 1614 et 1658 Ma. La géologie de cette province conduit à situer la mise en place de ces granites dans la zone de Rift. Les éléments traces Nb, Y, Zr, Ce, La et Ga et le rapport MgO/TiO 2 sont comparables à ceux des granites anorogéniques du sud-ouest des Etats-Unis et de la suite de Gabo en Australie. Les valeurs faibles du rapport Zr/Hf (23 à 28) des massifs étudiés permettent d'exclure une origine directe par fusion partielle, le rapport crustal par fusion est compris entre 30 et 40. La zonalité minéralogique (bordure à biotite et coeur à pyroxène) des lentilles à pyroxène du gisement de Mata Azul (massif de Serra Dourada) traduit le caractère métasomatique de ces roches et rappelle celles des endoskarns. Les études pétrographiques, minéralogiques et géochimiques ont mis en évidence l'importance du rôle du calcium et de la fugacité d'oxygène. A l'exception des albitites, la majorité des zones métasomatiques et les veines minéralisées sont localisées dans la partie apicale du granite fin au nord du massif de Sucuri. Les minéraux du béryllium (béryl, phénacite et helvite) sont présents dans la veine à quartz-muscovite, dans la veine à sidérophyllite. dans l'albitite, seules la phénacite et l'helvite sont présentes. Les variations de composition des minéraux de l'helvite dans le massif de Sucuri résulteraient des variations de la fugacité de soufre et de celle de l'oxygène et de l'alcalinité à l'intérieur du fluide...|$|E
