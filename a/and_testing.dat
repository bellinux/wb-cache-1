40|$|Integration <b>and</b> <b>test</b> {{planning}} of embedded systems {{is a task}} often performed by industry experts. The {{reason for this is}} the multi-disciplinary nature of the embedded system, the complexity of the components and their environment and the volatility of the integration <b>and</b> <b>test</b> plan. The Tangram research project aims at reducing the integration <b>and</b> <b>test</b> duration of complex embedded systems, like ASML wafer scanners, without influencing the product quality or cost. Integration <b>and</b> <b>test</b> planning is one of the areas where model-based techniques and algorithms can reduce the integration <b>and</b> <b>test</b> duration. This paper presents a structured integration <b>and</b> <b>test</b> planning method including several improvement cycles. This method is applicable for multi-disciplinary systems and can be used to guide the modeling and optimization effort of industrial-size integration <b>and</b> <b>test</b> plans. This method {{has been used as a}} framework for our research into integration <b>and</b> <b>test</b> modeling, sequencing, planning and optimization...|$|R
40|$|The {{complexity}} of semiconductor manufacturing equipment is growing. This growth {{results in a}} complexity increase of the integration <b>and</b> <b>test</b> phase of these systems. Simply adding more test resources is not possible anymore, {{because of the cost}} involved. A better design of an integration <b>and</b> <b>test</b> strategy can help to optimize this hectic phase. However, methods to design and evaluate integration <b>and</b> <b>test</b> strategies for multi-disciplinary systems are hardly available. In this paper, we present a method to design and compare integration <b>and</b> <b>test</b> strategies. Following this method, an optimal integration <b>and</b> <b>test</b> strategy can be chosen from a set of possible strategies. A case has been performed where a system is integrated <b>and</b> <b>tested</b> using three different integration <b>and</b> <b>test</b> strategies: a time-to-market-driven strategy, a quality-driven strategy and a combined quality and time-to-market strategy...|$|R
40|$|The {{integration}} <b>and</b> <b>test</b> plan of a {{newly developed}} or manufactured product often has a typical form in a specific organization. This paper describes a number of typical integration <b>and</b> <b>test</b> plans encountered at various organizations with different business drivers. The integration <b>and</b> <b>test</b> plans are described using the same simple notation. A number of aspects per organization is investigated: a typical integration <b>and</b> <b>test</b> plan, the organization size, product volume, business drivers, number of components in the product and the used technology. The investigated organizations are grouped according to product complexity and a rough classification of integration <b>and</b> <b>test</b> plans: flexible <b>and</b> regulated integration <b>and</b> <b>test</b> plans. We conclude that flexible integration <b>and</b> <b>test</b> plans are used in time-to-market driven organizations, while regulated plans are used for non-time-to-market driven organizations...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a method to}} determine the optimal integration <b>and</b> <b>test</b> plan for embedded systems software releases. The method consists of four steps: 1) describe the integration <b>and</b> <b>test</b> problem in an integration <b>and</b> <b>test</b> model which is introduced in this paper, 2) determine possible test positioning strategies, 3) calculate integration <b>and</b> <b>test</b> plans for each <b>test</b> positioning strategy <b>and</b> 4) analyze the resulting plans on time-to-market <b>and</b> total <b>test</b> time <b>and</b> choose the optimal one. A test positioning strategy determines when a <b>test</b> phase starts <b>and</b> stops. We introduce several possible test phase strategies {{that can be used}} within the method. Using this method, for two specific ASML lithographic machine software releases (ASML 2006), we determined the optimal integration <b>and</b> <b>test</b> plans <b>and,</b> hence, the best test positioning strategy for ASML software testing...|$|R

40|$|Abstract-The goal of {{software}} inspection <b>and</b> <b>test</b> {{is to reduce}} the expected cost {{of software}} failure over the life of a product. This paper extends the use of defect higgers, the eventsthat cause defects to be discovered, to help evaluate the effectiveness of inspections <b>and</b> <b>test</b> scenarios. In the case of inspections, the defect trigger is defined as a set of values that associate the shills of the inspector with the discovered defect. Similarly, for test scenarios, the defect trigger values embody the deferring strategies being used in creating these scenarios. The usefulness of triggers in evaluating the effectiveness of software inspections <b>and</b> <b>tests</b> is demonstrated by evaluating the inspection <b>and</b> <b>test</b> activities of some software products. These evaluations are used to point to both deficiencies in inspection <b>and</b> <b>test</b> strategies <b>and</b> to progress made in improving such strategies. The trigger distribution of the entire inspection or test series may then be used to highlight areas for further investigation, with the aim of improving the design, implementation, <b>and</b> <b>test</b> processes.
