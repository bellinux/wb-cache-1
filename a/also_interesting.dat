5|$|The ABJM theory {{appearing}} in {{this version of}} the correspondence is <b>also</b> <b>interesting</b> for a variety of reasons. Introduced by Aharony, Bergman, Jafferis, and Maldacena, it is closely related to another quantum field theory called Chern–Simons theory. The latter theory was popularized by Witten in the late 1980s because of its applications to knot theory. In addition, the ABJM theory serves as a semi-realistic simplified model for solving problems that arise in condensed matter physics.|$|E
5|$|According to the United States Census Bureau, {{there are}} an {{estimated}} 5,045,356 houses in Ohio, of which 4,499,506, or about 89.2% are estimated to be occupied; this is 0.8% above the national average rate of occupation. Houses with a mortgage are estimated to cost owners about $1,216 per month, which is $186 below the national average. The United States Census Bureau also estimates that 3,150,239 houses are owner-occupied, or about 70%, which is 2.7% above the national average, and that an estimated 1,349,267 houses are renter-occupied. The median house value is $135,200, which is a significant $50,000 below the national average. Also, {{there are an}} estimated 545,850 unoccupied houses. It is <b>also</b> <b>interesting</b> to note that the plurality of houses in Ohio were built from 1940 to 1959 (1,175,325 houses), and that 3,058,721 houses are in some way dependent on utility gas.|$|E
5|$|In 1650, {{during the}} Third English Civil War, Oliver Cromwell's Parliamentarian forces invaded Scotland, {{taking control of}} the south of the country after their victory at Dunbar in September. In February 1651, Cromwell found his lines of {{communication}} under attack from a small group of Royalists based at Tantallon. This group, led by Alexander Seton, comprised just 91 men. Despite this, Cromwell's retaliation was to send 2,000 to 3,000 troops under General Monck, together with much of the artillery he had in Scotland, and lay siege to Tantallon. Seton was ennobled by Charles II, as Viscount of Kingston, on 14 February, during the siege. After twelve days of bombardment with cannon a breach was made in the Douglas Tower. The defenders were compelled to surrender, but only after quarter had been granted to them in recognition of their bravery. After the siege Tantallon was left in ruins: it was never repaired or inhabited afterwards. The siege of Tantallon was <b>also</b> <b>interesting</b> in that the Commonwealth land forces were supported by the Commonwealth Navy.|$|E

25|$|Requiem for Convoy PQ-17, a {{novel by}} Valentin Pikul is {{dedicated}} to the fate of the convoy. The book is <b>also</b> <b>interesting</b> since it describes the Soviet belief that Soviet submarine K-21 hit the Tirpitz. From 2003–04, a film was released in Russia based on this book.|$|E

25|$|The {{terminal}} station Depo Hostivař was constructed within the buildings {{of an existing}} railway depot. The extension is the first segment of the system to be built above ground and not through a tunnel.

25|$|As {{with many}} widely used natural products, {{the demand for}} menthol greatly exceeds the supply from natural sources. In the case of menthol it is <b>also</b> <b>interesting</b> to note that {{comparative}} analysis of the total life-cycle costs from a sustainability perspective has shown that production from natural sources actually results in consumption of more fossil fuel, produces more carbon dioxide effluent and has more environmental impact than either of the main synthetic production routes.|$|E

25|$|It is <b>also</b> <b>interesting</b> to pay {{attention}} to homilies from the doctrinal point of view and with the “gift of tongues”. For many faithful, the Sunday Holy Mass, with its Homily, is the only occasion where they will hear the message of Christ. With evermore renewed commitment, preaching will be very effective, above all if it is directed also at one’s own soul: if one lives what one says and preaches what one lives.|$|E
25|$|It is <b>also</b> <b>interesting</b> to {{note that}} wood collage in a sense made its debut, indirectly, {{at the same time}} as paper collage, since (according to the Guggenheim online), Georges Braque {{initiated}} use of paper collage by cutting out pieces of simulated oak-grain wallpaper and attaching them to his own charcoal drawings. Thus, the idea of gluing wood to a picture was implicitly there from the start, since the paper used in the very first paper collages was a commercial product manufactured to look like wood.|$|E
25|$|The {{temples of}} East Java dated from {{the era of}} Singhasari and Majapahit; mostly located in Trowulan archaeological site, and also {{scattered}} around Blitar and Malang. Although not as grand and popular as the temples of Central Java, the East Javanese temples is <b>also</b> <b>interesting</b> destination for candi and Indonesian ancient history enthusiast. East Javanese temples such as Wringin Lawang, Brahu, Bajang Ratu, and Candi Tikus in Trowulan archaeological site. Jawi temple near Pandaan, south of Surabaya, Penataran temple in Blitar, Kidal temple and Singhasari temple near Malang.|$|E

25|$|Many other sporocarps are grazed upon by {{invertebrates}} such as mollusks and fly larvae, some {{of which}} are even tolerant to the toxic α-amanitin. Belowground, populations of nematodes and springtails are maintined by consumption of fungal tissue. There are <b>also</b> <b>interesting</b> studies concerning EcM fungi and arthropods. The ectomycorrhizal fungus Laccaria bicolor has been found to lure and kill springtails to obtain nitrogen, {{some of which}} may then be transferred to the mycorrhizal host plant. In a study by Klironomos and Hart, eastern white pine inoculated with L. bicolor was able to derive up to 25% of its nitrogen from springtails.|$|E
25|$|A two part text, On the Binding of Contracts, {{deals with}} when {{contracts}} are binding {{and when they}} are not. The first section deals with general rules regarding when contracts are binding, including an analogy to the fact that Adam's trade of an apple for access to the Garden of Eden was valid even though it was an uneven contract because Adam knew it was such. The second half deals with cases in which a contract may be overturned. The tract is <b>also</b> <b>interesting</b> because it is a collection of material from varying dates and places and as such much more uneven in content than other tracts.|$|E
25|$|The Baroque style quickly spread {{throughout}} Russia, gradually replacing more traditional and canonical architecture. The Stroganov merchants sponsored construction of majestic Baroque structures in Nizhny Novgorod (the Nativity Church, 1703) {{and in the}} remote tundra region (the Presentation Cathedral in Solvychegodsk, 1693). During {{the first decades of}} the 18th century, some remarkable Baroque cathedrals were built in such eastern towns as Kazan, Solikamsk, Verkhoturye, Tobolsk and Irkutsk. <b>Also</b> <b>interesting</b> are the traditional wooden churches by carpenters of the Russian North. Working without hammer and nails, they constructed such bizarre structures as the 24-domed Intercession Church at Vytegra (1708, burnt down 1963) and the 22-domed Transfiguration Church at Kizhi (1714).|$|E

25|$|The {{bitter taste}} is almost universally {{unpleasant}} to humans. This is because many nitrogenous organic molecules {{which have a}} pharmacological effect on humans taste bitter. These include caffeine, nicotine, and strychnine, which respectively compose the stimulant in coffee, addictive agent in cigarettes, and active compound in many pesticides. It appears that some psychological process allows humans to overcome their innate aversion to bitter taste, as caffeinated drinks are widely consumed and enjoyed around the world. It is <b>also</b> <b>interesting</b> to note that many common medicines have a bitter taste if chewed; the gustatory system apparently interprets these compounds as poisons. In this manner, the unpleasant reaction to the bitter taste is a last-line warning system before the compound is ingested and can do damage.|$|E
25|$|Union Rotorua was <b>also</b> <b>interesting</b> {{in its use}} of ro-ro for the Trans Tasman route. The cargo did not {{necessarily}} just contain truck and trailer units, but was also cargo stacked in the decks using forklifts. This necessitated the vehicle decks of the ship being build to withstand the loading of up to 39t per axle that could be exerted by a heavy forklift. Union Rotorua was built with a large angled stern ramp that allowed her to unload her cargo at any wharf {{without the need for}} a specialist linkspan as required by most ro-ro ships. She also had a bow door which could be used if a linkspan was present in a port, thus allowing cargo to be worked both forward and aft speeding up turn around time.|$|E
25|$|The {{decoration}} includes stuccoes by Francesco Ferrari (c.1725), and a Cosmatesque pavement. The main altarpiece has a Madonna with Saints Andrew and Gregory (1734) by Antonio Balestra. The second altar on {{the left}} has a Madonna on a Throne with child and four Saints and Blesseds of the Gabrielli family (1739) by Pompeo Batoni. At {{the end of the}} nave, the altar of S. Gregorio Magno has three fine reliefs {{from the end of the}} 15th century by Luigi Capponi. <b>Also</b> <b>interesting</b> is the Salviati Chapel, designed by Francesco da Volterra and finished by Carlo Maderno in 1600: it includes an ancient fresco which, according to the associated tradition, spoke to St. Gregory, and a marble altar (1469) by Andrea Bregno and pupils.
