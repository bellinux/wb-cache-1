The medicine man touches the fan to the center pole and then to the patient, in order to transmit power from the pole to the patient.

The pygmy slow loris is primarily valued for the medicinal use of its hair, but it is also used to make bone glue of monkey, <b>a</b> <b>medicine</b> used mostly by local people, but sometimes sold to visitors. In general, wearing slow loris bones is considered good luck and the meat is sometimes thought to cure leprosy.|$|E
5|$|The Sunrise Dance Ceremony is not {{an ancient}} Yavapai ceremony. Apache and Yavapai often intermarried and adopted {{elements}} of each other's cultures; these two tribes reside together on the Camp Verde and Fort McDowell reservations. The Sunrise Dance is a four-day rite-of-transition for young Apache girls, which typically takes place from March through October. The sunrise dance is an ancient practice, unique to the Apache. It {{is related to the}} myth of the Changing Woman, a powerful figure in Apache culture who is believed to grant longevity. The power of Changing Woman is transferred to the pubescent girl through songs sung by the Medicine Man. <b>A</b> <b>medicine</b> man is joined by other tribal members in singing a series of songs, up to 32 which are believed to have first been sung by Changing Woman.|$|E

5|$|The main {{characters}} each come {{from one of}} four Clans: ThunderClan, RiverClan, ShadowClan, and WindClan. All Clan cats share a belief in StarClan, a group of spirits usually represented by the stars, who are their ancestors and provide them with guidance. The Clans also follow identical hierarchy structures: Clans each have one leader, a deputy who is second-in-command, and <b>a</b> <b>medicine</b> cat who heals Clanmates in addition to communicating with StarClan. The bulk of each Clan consists of warriors, who carry out hunting for food, patrol borders, and fight battles when they occur. Apprentices are younger cats who are in training to become warriors, or more rarely, medicine cats.|$|E
5|$|The motor {{symptoms}} of PD {{are the result}} of reduced dopamine production in the brain's basal ganglia. Dopamine does not cross the blood-brain barrier, so it cannot be taken as <b>a</b> <b>medicine</b> to boost the brain's depleted levels of dopamine. However a precursor of dopamine, levodopa, can pass through to the brain where it is readily converted to dopamine, and administration of levodopa temporarily diminishes the motor {{symptoms of}} PD. Levodopa has been the most widely used PD treatment for over 40 years.|$|E
5|$|Wambui {{subsequently}} bore another son, Kongo, but Muigai died shortly after. In {{keeping with}} Kikuyu tradition, Wambui was then {{married to her}} late husband's younger brother, Ngengi. Kenyatta was then given the name of Kamau wa Ngengi ("Kamau, son of Ngengi"). Wambui bore her new husband a son, whom they also named Muigai. Ngengi was harsh and resentful toward these three boys, with Wambui deciding to take her youngest son with her {{to stay with her}} parental family further north. It was there that she died, and Kenyatta—who was very fond of the younger Muigai—travelled through the forest to collect his infant half-brother. Kenyatta then moved in with his grandfather, Kongo wa Magana, and assisted the latter in his role as <b>a</b> <b>medicine</b> man.|$|E

5|$|Artemisinin is a {{sesquiterpene}} lactone {{containing a}} peroxide group, which {{is believed to}} be essential for its anti-malarial activity. Its derivatives, artesunate and artemether, have been used in clinics since 1987 for the treatment of drug-resistant and drug-sensitive malaria, especially cerebral malaria. These drugs are characterized by fast action, high efficacy and good tolerance. They kill the asexual forms of P. berghei and P. cynomolgi and have transmission-blocking activity. In 1985, Zhou Yiqing and his team combined artemether and lumefantrine into a single tablet, which was registered as <b>a</b> <b>medicine</b> in China in 1992. Later it became known as “Coartem”. Artemisinin combination treatments (ACTs) are now widely used to treat uncomplicated falciparum malaria, but access to ACTs is still limited in most malaria-endemic countries and only a minority of the patients who need artemisinin-based combination treatments receive them.|$|E
5|$|Dr. Mario is {{a falling}} block tile-matching video {{game in which}} Mario assumes {{the role of a}} doctor, tossing two-colored medical {{capsules}} into <b>a</b> <b>medicine</b> bottle representing the playing field. This area is populated by viruses of three colors: red, yellow, and blue, which stay in their starting position until removed. In a manner and style considered similar to Tetris, the player manipulates each capsule as it vertically falls 1 unit of space at a time, able to move it left or right and rotate it 90 degrees in either clockwise or counter-clockwise. When four or more capsule halves or viruses of matching color are aligned in vertical or horizontal configurations, they are removed from play. Any remaining capsule halves or whole capsules which are now not supported by a virus or capsule will fall {{to the bottom of the}} playing field or until it hits another supported object, and any new 4-in-a-row alignments created from this will also be removed. The main objective is to complete levels, which is accomplished by eliminating all viruses from the playing field. A game over occurs if capsules fill up the playing field in a way that obstructs the bottle's narrow neck. After each 5th level is completed on Medium or High difficulty, up to level 20, a cut-scene is shown where the virus trio is sitting on a tree as music plays and an object flies across the screen.|$|E
5|$|During Harrison's administration, the Lakota Sioux, {{previously}} {{confined to}} reservations in South Dakota, grew restive {{under the influence}} of Wovoka, <b>a</b> <b>medicine</b> man, who encouraged them to participate in a spiritual movement called the Ghost Dance. Many in Washington did not understand the predominantly religious nature of the Ghost Dance, and thought it was a militant movement being used to rally Native Americans against the government. On December 29, 1890, troops from the Seventh Cavalry clashed with the Sioux at Wounded Knee. The result was a massacre of at least 146 Sioux, including many women and children; the dead Sioux were buried in a mass grave. In reaction Harrison directed Major General Nelson A. Miles to investigate and ordered 3500 federal troops to South Dakota; the uprising was brought to an end. Wounded Knee is considered the last major American Indian battle in the 19th century. Harrison's general policy on American Indians was to encourage assimilation into white society and, despite the massacre, he believed the policy to have been generally successful. This policy, known as the allotment system and embodied in the Dawes Act, was favored by liberal reformers at the time, but eventually proved detrimental to American Indians as they sold most of their land at low prices to white speculators.|$|E
