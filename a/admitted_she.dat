5|$|Initially Bryant {{kept her}} {{concerns}} low-key, despite her pastor's pleadings to become involved. She {{wrote a letter}} to the county commission and called Ruth Shack, expressing her concerns. Her most significant objection to the ordinance was that it would allow homosexuals to work in parochial schools; all four of Bryant's children attended a local private Christian school. She <b>admitted</b> <b>she</b> was largely ignorant of any specific dangers homosexuals presented, but when she was sent graphic images of homosexual acts, and shown photos of child pornography by a local police sergeant visiting her church, she was horrified. Bryant credited her inspiration later to her 9-year-old daughter suggesting God could assist with her cause; then she decided to take a more public role.|$|E
5|$|Niedermayer missed several games {{early in}} the 2001–02 season due to back pain, and his 33 points on the season was his lowest in six seasons. Niedermayer and the Devils reached their fourth Stanley Cup Final in 2002–03. The series was a family affair, as Scott's brother Rob {{was a member of}} the {{opposing}} Mighty Ducks of Anaheim. When asked, their mother <b>admitted</b> <b>she</b> was hoping Rob's Mighty Ducks would win as Scott already had two championships to his name. Scott dashed his brother and mother's hopes, recording two assists in the deciding seventh game to lead the Devils to a 3–0 victory, and win his third Stanley Cup.|$|E

5|$|The {{manager and}} {{investigator}} summoned Collins {{for an interview}} and questioned her. Collins asked {{for the presence of}} a union representative several times but was refused by the manager each time. Upon questioning, Collins explained that she had put four pieces of chicken (which cost $1 total) into a larger box (one which could hold $2.98 of chicken) because the store had run out of the four-piece sized boxes. To check Collins's story, the investigator left to ask the coworker who had reported her. The coworker confirmed that the store had run out of $1 size boxes and <b>admitted</b> <b>she</b> did not know how much chicken Collins had placed in the larger box. The investigator returned to the interview, apologized to Collins, and prepared to let her go.|$|E
5|$|Three more {{individuals}} {{who say they}} had unprotected sex with Usher sued him on allegations of fraud, sexual battery, infliction of emotional distress and more, alleging that he was positive for the herpes virus and didn't tell them in advance. All three are represented by attorney Lisa Bloom who said {{at the news conference}} on 8 August 2017 that one of her three clients had contracted genital herpes allegedly from Usher. One of the accusers, Quantasia Sharpton, said she had unprotected sex with him after a concert she attended around her 19th birthday. The other two accusers, one male, one female, preferred to remain anonymous plaintiffs.

5|$|Lasarra was {{a female}} protoss {{scientist}} stationed on Kaldir when it was attacked by zerg led by Sarah Kerrigan. The protoss were defeated; Lasarra was captured during the attack on Kaldir {{at the request of}} Abathur, who wanted to experiment on her even though it was known that the protoss could not be infested. Kerrigan agreed to spare Lasarra's life until she found a use for her. During her time onboard Kerrigan's leviathan, Lasarra interacted with Kerrigan a number of times. Kerrigan tried to justify her actions on Kaldir, saying that if the protoss could contact Shakuras, Kerrigan {{would not have been able}} to survive. However, Lasarra is unconvinced, saying that self-preservation is no justification for killing so many innocents. Eventually, Kerrigan <b>admitted</b> <b>she</b> could not and would not justify her actions, stating that both the zerg and protoss were killers. Eventually, as one of the protoss ships was able to break through the zerg blockade, Lasarra was implanted with a special larva and allowed to warp in to that ship. The larva devoured her and then other lifeforms being stored on the ship, evading detection. It eventually transformed into a broodmother, Niadra, which bred a new brood that infested the ship, killing every protoss on board. Kerrigan later showed some regret over Lasarra's death, as she told Izsha that she did not enjoy having to kill her.|$|E

25|$|In his journals, Alexander Polovtsov, State Secretary during Alexander III's reign, left an unsympathetic {{portrayal}} of Grand Duchess Olga.

25|$|In the 1970s a {{specific}} form of surgery known as psychic dentistry emerged in America. Willard Fuller {{was the most}} well known proponent.

However, magicians and skeptics have found these claims to be unsupported by solid evidence. One dentist examined some patients of Fuller. In one case miraculous gold fillings {{turned out to be}} tobacco stains. In another case a female patient who reported a miraculous new silver filling <b>admitted</b> <b>she</b> had forgotten that the filling was already there.|$|E

25|$|In 2014 {{one team}} used a {{helicopter}} to fly from South base camp to Camp 2 {{to avoid the}} Khumbu Icefall, then reached the Everest summit. This team {{had to use the}} south side because the Chinese had denied them a permit to climb. Ultimately, Chinese reluctance may have been beneficial to Nepalese interests, allowing the government to showcase improved local hospitals and the opportunity for a new hybrid aviation/mountaneering stylewhich sparked conversations about helicopter use in the mountaineering world. Nepal ended up investigating Wang, and she denied the charge but <b>admitted</b> <b>she</b> did fly some support crew over the Khumbu Icefall to Camp 2 using a helicopter. National Geographic noted how a village festooned Wang with honours after she donated 30,000 USD to the town's hospital.

25|$|Bree tracked Brooke {{down and}} {{revealed}} they were sisters to a frosty reception. With help from Brooke's boyfriend, Vinnie Kruse (Pua Magasiva), Bree {{landed a job}} at the hospital alongside Brooke. However, after several icey interactions with her sister, Bree ended up dating Vinnie but started to suffer from her lack of self-confidence at work. Vinnie soon discovered Bree had only passed her medical exams by sleeping with her tutor and they broke up. Bree started to blackmail staff to keep her job but was suspended when she nearly killed a patient. Bree was devastated when Annette returned and <b>admitted</b> <b>she</b> had wanted to abort Bree, resulting in Bree holding Annette captive, drugging and, mentally torturing her. Bree lost her job and after working as a medical supplies salesman, began sleeping with Kevin Johns (David Van Horn) under the identity of Brooke. When Brooke discovered the fraud, Bree lost her mind and attempted to murder her, knocking her out and hiding her body in a storage container. The hospital staff soon realised Bree legitimately believed herself to be her sister and once Brooke was discovered, Bree was sectioned to a mental health ward. Bree was relocated to a different city where Brooke continued to visit her.|$|E
25|$|O'Sullivan {{returned}} in March 2002 for the World Cross Country Championships, {{being held in}} Dublin. She finished a very respectable 7th in the Short Race, and led Ireland to Team Bronze. At the European Championships in Munich later that year, O'Sullivan attempted a defense of her two European Golds she won in 1998. In the 10000 m she won silver in a National Record of 30:47.59. Despite this, she finished a full 46 seconds behind winner Paula Radcliffe who narrowly missed becoming the second woman to break 30 minutes in a European Record performance of 30:01.09. O'Sullivan <b>admitted</b> <b>she</b> had been outclassed in the race, saying that only world record holder Wang Junxia could have beaten her on the night.
