It is characterized by qualitative impairment in social interaction, by stereotyped and restricted patterns of behavior, activities and interests, and by no clinically significant delay in cognitive development or general delay in language. Intense preoccupation with a narrow subject, one-sided verbosity, restricted prosody, and physical clumsiness are typical of the condition, but <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>required</b> for diagnosis. Suicidal behavior appears to occur at rates similar to those without ASD.|$|E
5|$|At the Paris Air Show in June 2011, Hong Kong Airlines had {{announced}} a signed contract for 10 Airbus A380's however due to China's anger with the European Union over plans to force all airlines {{to take part}} in its carbon-trading scheme, the Chinese government has blocked progress on Airbus’s sale of 10 A380s to Hong Kong Airlines. Normally, airlines in Hong Kong <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>required</b> to seek approval from the Chinese government to proceed with aircraft orders. The A380 cancellation became an issue as Hong Kong Airlines' parent, Hainan Airlines, is registered in mainland China, not Hong Kong SAR.

5|$|Chocobo Tales {{features}} {{a mix of}} three different types of gameplay; role-playing video game, exploration, and card battles. Players explore a 3D environment to find picture books.

The picture books take the form of Aesop's Fables and Grimm's Fairy Tales with the player character often taking the main role. Other Final Fantasy characters take up roles within the stories. More simplistic minigames, known as microgames, are also scattered throughout the world. Unlike minigames, these are not located within pop-up books, do not affect the game-world and <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>required</b> to progress in the game.|$|E
