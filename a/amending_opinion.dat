40|$|Abstract For pupils and for {{any person}} who went to school, history is a school subject which {{combines}} studies about historical themes, methods and teaching devices. In a questionnaire to pupils in lower secondary school in Geneva, we asked some open questions about {{what they think of}} those elements. We ask what they prefer, what they don’t like, what is useful. The same questions were asked of students in educational sciences. This paper analyses answers from these two groups and compares them. Some themes and methods are endorsed by a large number of persons; other ones are liked by one group and rejected by the other.

Originally confined to a small footnote in the Court's initial decision, it was expanded to over two pages when plaintiff Capitol petitioned the court to reassess its conclusion on the issue. In an <b>amended</b> <b>opinion,</b> Judge Pauley held that while prior case law construing § 301(c) of the Copyright Act held that federal copyright protections do not preempt or limit common law rights in pre-1972 works, they also did not suggest that § 301(c) limits Congress's ability to grant immunity to qualified Internet service providers for the infringement of works fixed before 1972. More particularly, Pauley ruled that EMI's interpretation of § 301(c) as excluding pre-1972 recordings from the DMCA would eviscerate the purpose of the DMCA, and [...] "where an examination of the statute as a whole demonstrates that a party's interpretation would lead to 'absurd or futile results ... plainly at variance with the policy of the legislation as a whole,' that interpretation should be rejected." ...|$|R

40|$|On June 26, 2002, in Newdow v. U. S.

Eight months later, the still divided Ninth Circuit panel issued an <b>amended</b> <b>opinion</b> reaffirming its ruling that the school district’s policy coerces students to perform a “religious act” in contravention of the Establishment Clause. However, holding that it had exceeded the legal analysis necessary to review the lawfulness of the policy, the Newdow Court vacated its determination that the words “under God” in the Pledge are per se unconstitutional. This article urges that the original Newdow decision rightly understood that adding the words “under God” to the Pledge violates the Constitution’s anti-establishment principles. Accordingly, government policy encouraging public school students to avow via the Pledge that ours is a nation dependent on or ruled by God, likewise contravenes the First Amendment...|$|R

40|$|I {{develop a}} dynamic model of law {{creation}} {{in which the}} court is uncertain about the ideal rule. The court learns about the ideal rule through the cases it hears, which are in turn the result of rational choices of agents responding to the court's previous decisions. Learning requires experimentation, and since agents choose optimally, learning is only possible experimentation is incentive compatible for the agent. The court provides incentives to the agent by setting penalties, and writing opinions that commit the court to sanctioning or punishing various actions. The model generates several predictions. First, the efficacy of opinion writing is asymmetric- the court has an incentive to write broad permissive opinions, but no cor-responding incentive to write broad restrictive opinions. Second, the court's learning is inefficient- it does not induce learning that minimizes the expected future cost of uncer-tainty. Instead, the court will induce experimentation that {{increases the likelihood that}} it can amend its permissive opinion- since this policy tool is more efficacious. Third, since the court cannot always <b>amend</b> an <b>opinion,</b> it has a incentive to preemptively write broad opinions.

He was preoccupied, he was irresponsive to my experimental observations on vulgar topics--the hot weather, the inn, the advent of Adelina Patti. At last, uttering his thoughts, he announced that Madame Blumenthal had proved to be an extraordinarily interesting woman. He seemed to have quite forgotten our long talk in the Hartwaldt, and betrayed no sense of this being a confession that he had taken his plunge and was floating with the current. He only remembered that I had spoken slightingly of the lady, and he now hinted that it behoved me to <b>amend</b> my <b>opinion.</b> I had received the day before so strong an impression of a sort of spiritual fastidiousness in my friend's nature, that on hearing now the striking of a new hour, as it were, in his consciousness, and observing how the echoes of the past were immediately quenched in its music, I said to myself that it had certainly taken a delicate hand to wind up that fine machine. No doubt Madame Blumenthal was a clever woman. It is a good German custom at Homburg to spend the hour preceding dinner in listening to the orchestra in the Kurgarten; Mozart and Beethoven, for organisms in which the interfusion of soul and sense is peculiarly mysterious, are a vigorous stimulus to the appetite.

Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Omaha District, Nebraska. The Missouri River Recovery Program - Emergent Sandbar Habitat Value Engineering Study focuses on the assessment of the Missouri River Recovery Program (MRRP) Habitat Creation Project with specific focus on the creation of emergent sandbar habitats, examining current plans and programs to seek out alternative approaches and ideas that will improve the overall performance of the program. The MRRP seeks to mitigate near-term losses of Missouri River habitats and recover threatened and endangered species, one of which is emergent sandbar habitats (ESH) that are particularly important to the endangered interior least tern (Sternula antillarum) and threatened piping plover (Charadius melodus), two bird species provided protection under the federal Endangered Species Act (ESA). The program further seeks to sustain these species through habitat creation and restoration, species protection, and monitoring and research to prevent further declines of these species and other native species that may rely on ESH. The purpose of the VE study is to identify potential viable alternatives to improve the overall performance and cost of creating ESH while focusing on concepts that will assist the Corps in meeting its objective to create sufficient habitat to ensure that fledge ratios and adult population goals for both bird species identified by the U.

Second, it did not appear to have appreciated the distinction between general and specific relevance. Third, the introduction of the judicial discretion is a concept that neither comports with the common law position nor coheres with the EA. Fourth, whether there should have been continued applicability of the ‘ultimate issue rule’ could have been clarified. At bottom, Parliament did not demonstrate a keen understanding of the conceptualisation, structure, and principles of the antiquated EA. A framework for determining relevance and admissibility of evidence that is in accordance with the EA is thus proposed.

The BiOp and Mitigation Project provide direction and authority to complete projects that provide fish and wildlife habitat along Missouri River. These actions are being undertaken to address endangered species needs and mitigate for the loss of habitat that resulted from construction, operation, and maintenance of the Missouri River Mainstem Reservoir System and the Bank Stabilization and Navigation Project (BSNP). The Sandy Point Bend project site consists of 251. 6 acres and is situated on the Nebraska side of the Missouri River in Harrison County, Iowa.

RPA IV. B. 3 includes recommendations for the mechanical creation and maintenance of Emergent Sandbar Habitat (ESH) as nesting habitat for these two species. ESH refers to exposed, inter-channel sandbars. In contrast to islands, ESH complexes are temporary formations and comparatively dynamic in nature. The proposed action involves the restoration of three ESH complexes in the 59 -mile segment of the Missouri National Recreational River (MNRR) below Gavins Point dam (River Miles 811 - 753).

Please refer to the ESH AM Strategy - Appendix H of the Draft ESH Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement (PEIS) – and the Missouri River Recovery Program (MRRP) AM Process Framework for detailed background information on the overall scope and approach of this effort. Also note that as more information becomes available, corrections to values in tables and figures from past reports may be updated and certain methodologies may evolve in future AM Reports. In the future, the most recent AM Report should be referred to for the most up-to-date information. Following is a summary of data from the 2010 nesting season. A more complete tracking of progress towards metrics, as well as trends, {{can be found in}} the report card (Section 3. 5). Monitoring data from 2010 indicate that population sizes for both the plover and tern were below BiOp targets and decreased 33 % and 5 %, respectively, from 2009 levels (Table 3. 1). Fledge ratios for plovers remained below target but increased slightly (7 %) from 2009. Fledge ratios for terns were above target in 2010 and increased significantly (29 %) from 2009. ESH area was below the target associated with Alternative 5 of the Draft ESH PEIS and is estimated to have declined 19 % between 2009 and 2010. In addition there was also an overall decline in the amount of reservoir habitat due to increased water levels at all reservoirs. During 2004 – 2010, the total amount of constructed ESH was approximately 847 acres, or an average construction rate of 169 acres/year in years where construction took place (Table 4. 1). Construction of new ESH for the 2010 nesting season amounted to approximately 104 acres and was below the target associated with Alterative 5 of the PEIS. Based on available data and observations, a number of recommendations have been developed for upcoming years of implementing the ESH sub-program. Recommendations to directly influence effectiveness are: 1. Increase rate of ESH construction to at least 164 acres annually, 2. Utilize vegetation removal methods from pilot project to improve habitat quality on previously constructed habitats annually, 3. Continue investigations to improve understanding of creation actions and system and species response...|$|R
5000|$|On February 18, 2011, the California Court of Appeal for the Fourth Appellate District {{affirmed the}} {{sustaining}} of a demurrer without leave to <b>amend.</b> In an <b>opinion</b> by Justice Joan Irion, {{the court ruled}} in favor of MERS in two ways: (1) California's nonjudicial foreclosure statutes did not expressly or impliedly allow a lawsuit simply to determine whether the party initiating a foreclosure was authorized to do so; and (2) even if they did, the plaintiff consented to the use of MERS to initiate the foreclosure when he signed the deed of trust. [...] Gomes expressly cited to and relied upon the state supreme court's 2010 decision in Lu v. Hawaiian Gardens Casino, Inc., which clarified that a certain conservative method of statutory analysis (first articulated by Associate Justice Frank K. Richardson in 1979 and adopted by a majority of the court in a 1988 opinion by Chief Justice Malcolm M. Lucas) applies to all California statutes, not just the California Insurance Code. Thus, if the California Legislature has not expressly written a cause of action into a statute, it simply does not exist. The Supreme Court of California denied Gomes's petition for review on May 18, 2011. Gomes' attorney then filed a petition for writ of certiorari in the U.S. Supreme Court in which he attempted to challenge MERS on vaguely articulated due process federal constitutional grounds not previously raised in the lower courts. However, he failed to challenge the constitutionality of the California rule for finding an implied cause of action, which would likely have failed anyway, as the federal rule for finding an implied cause of action is nearly identical.

Bald eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) depend on the adjacent cottonwood forest for nesting, roosting, and wintering habitat along the Missouri River. Past and ongoing U. S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) operations to serve Congressionally authorized project purposes, including flood control, have restricted overbank flooding causing the reduction of existing stands and new cottonwood establishment. The degradation of cottonwood forests will likely continue in the future and result in additional impacts to bald eagles. In response, the Corps and the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), in partnership with tribal nations, states and other agencies, are working to restore a portion of the Missouri River’s natural form and function in order to recover Missouri River species provided protection under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (ESA). The Missouri River Recovery Program (MRRP) implements the USFWS 2003 <b>Amended</b> Biological <b>Opinion</b> (BiOp) on the Corps operation of the System, BSNP, and Kansas River Tributary Reservoirs (KR) Projects. Pursuant to Section 5018 of the Water Resources Development Act of 2007 (WRDA 2007) the Corps, in consultation with the Missouri River Recovery Implementation Committee (MRRIC) is preparing a long-term and comprehensive Missouri River Ecosystem Restoration Plan (MRERP). The MRRIC includes representatives from Basin Tribes, states, and a diverse range of basin stakeholders. When complete, the MRERP will identify management actions to recover federally protected Missouri River species, mitigate losses of terrestrial and aquatic habitat, and prevent future declines of species. The Cottonwood Management Plan (CMP) is part of the MRRP. Ultimately, this plan may also inform the long-term MRERP. The MRRP incorporates the requirements of the Missouri River BSNP Fish and Wildlife Mitigation Project on the Lower River (Mitigation Project) with the actions required by the 2003 Amended BiOp (Appendix A). The Mitigation Project was authorized by Section 601 (a) of the Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) of 1986 (Public Law 99 - 662). Title VI of the 1986 WRDA authorizes the Mitigation Project in accordance with the plans and subject to the conditions recommended in the Missouri River BSNP Final Feasibility Report and Final Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for the Fish and Wildlife Mitigation Plan (Corps 1981). The intent of the originally authorized Mitigation Project was to restore, preserve, and develop 18, 200 acres of existing public lands and acquire and develop 29, 900 acres of non-public land. A total of 48, 100 acres of land in the four affected states, Iowa, Nebraska, Kansas, and Missouri, would be acquired, restored, preserved, and developed for the Mitigation Project. Allocations of the acreage by affected states are presented in the report entitled Missouri River Bank Stabilization and Navigation Fish and Wildlife Mitigation Project, Reaffirmation Report (Corps 1990). In the WRDA of 1999 (Public Law 106 - 53) Congress authorized the acquisition and development of an additional 118, 650 acres for the Mitigation Project, increasing the total acreage to 166, 750 acres. The key recovery initiatives for the MRRP include habitat construction and restoration, hatchery support, flow modification, and an integrated science program that informs an overall adaptive management strategy. The CMP is part of the habitat creation recovery initiative of the MRRP...|$|R
