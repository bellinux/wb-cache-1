These cells had demonstrated transformation–like stable changes and could be used as model system to study oxidant induced carcinogenesis. Our objective was to understand mechanism of radiation-resistance in these cells. Apoptotic cell death was inhibited in these cells as visualized microscopically by Hoechst staining and nucleosomal ladder formation in agarose gel. Release of cytochrome c in cytoplasm and Apoptosis Inducing Factor in the mitochondrial and nuclear fraction of cells were determined by Western blotting. The caspase 9 and caspase 3 activities in these cells were estimated from fluorimetric assays. These results revealed that the radiation resistance was due to inhibition of caspase-dependent apoptotic death pathways although Apoptosis Inducing Factor mediated pathway remained unaffected. These findings may aid in understanding the mechanism of radiation resistance in tumors <b>arising</b> <b>from</b> <b>oxidative</b> <b>stress...</b>|$|E
40|$|A central {{mystery in}} the {{function}} of site-specific DNA-binding proteins is the detailed mechanism for rapid location and binding of target sites in DNA. Human oxoguanine DNA glycosylase 1 (hOgg 1), for example, must search out rare 8 -oxoguanine lesions to prevent transversion mutations <b>arising</b> <b>from</b> <b>oxidative</b> <b>stress.</b> Here we report high-speed imaging of single hOgg 1 enzyme molecules diffusing along DNA stretched by shear flow. Salt-concentration-dependent measurements reveal that such diffusion occurs as hOgg 1 slides in persistent contact with DNA. At near-physiologic pH and salt concentration, hOgg 1 has a subsecond DNA-binding time and slides with a diffusion constant as high as 5 × 10 ^ 6 bp 2 /s. Such a value approaches the theoretical upper limit for one-dimensional diffusion and indicates an activation barrier for sliding of only 0. 5 kcal/mol (1 kcal = 4. 2 kJ). This nearly barrierless Brownian sliding indicates that DNA glycosylases locate lesion bases by a massively redundant search in which the enzyme selectively binds 8 -oxoguanine under kinetic control. ...|$|E
40|$|Excessive {{free radical}} generation, {{especially}} {{reactive oxygen species}} (ROS) leading to oxidative stress in the biological system, has been implicated in the pathogenesis and pathological conditions associated with diverse human inflammatory diseases (HIDs). Although inflammation which is considered advantageous is a defensive mechanism in response to xenobiotics and foreign pathogen; {{as a result of}} cellular damage <b>arising</b> <b>from</b> <b>oxidative</b> <b>stress,</b> if uncontrolled, it may degenerate to chronic inflammation when the ROS levels exceed the antioxidant capacity. Therefore, in the normal resolution of inflammatory reactions, apoptosis is acknowledged to play a crucial role, while on the other hand, dysregulation in the induction of apoptosis by enhanced ROS production could also result in excessive apoptosis identified in the pathogenesis of HIDs. Apparently, a careful balance must be maintained in this complex environment. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have been proposed in this review as an excellent candidate capable of playing prominent roles in maintaining this balance. Consequently, in novel drug design for the treatment and management of HIDs, AMPs are promising candidates owing to their size and multidimensional properties as well as their wide spectrum of activities and indications of reduced rate of resistanc...|$|E

A concentration-dependent ferric reducing, free radical scavenging and antioxidant activity of two genotypes, namely KS 1 and gulabi of vetiver (Vetiveria zizanioides L.

A positive co-relation was observed between FRAP, DPPH and TPC of cv KS 1, whereas TAC and RP showed a negative co-relation.

Platelets {{are very sensitive to}} oxidative stress, as it leads to the damage of mitochondrial DNA, which is the initial step of a sequence of events culminating in the cell death through the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis. Owing to a lot of reports on secondary complications <b>arising</b> <b>from</b> <b>oxidative</b> <b>stress</b> caused by therapeutic drug overdose, the present study concd. on the influence of sesamol on oxidative stress-induced platelet apoptosis. Sesamol, a phenolic deriv. present in sesame seeds is an exceptionally promising drug with lots of reports on its protective functions, including its inhibitory effects on platelet aggregation at concns. below 100 Î¼M, and its anti-cancer effect at 1 mM. However, the present study explored the toxic effects of sesamol on human platelets. Sesamol at the concn. of 0. 25 mM and above induced platelet apoptosis through endogenous generation of ROS, depletion of thiol pool, and Ca 2 + mobilization. It also induced mitochondrial membrane potential depolarization, caspase activation, cytochrome c translocation and phosphatidylserine exposure, thus illustrating the pro-apoptotic effect of sesamol at higher concn. However, even at high concn. of 2 mM sesamol effectively inhibited collagen/ADP/epinephrine-induced platelet aggregation. The study demonstrates that even though sesamol inhibits platelet aggregation, it has the tendency to elicit platelet apoptosis at higher concns. Sesamol has a potential as thrombolytic agent, nevertheless the current work highlights the significance of an appropriate dosage of sesamol when it is used as a therapeutic drug.

However, {{little is known about}} melatonin and its receptors in the human placenta throughout pregnancy and their role in villous trophoblast development. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine melatonin-synthesizing enzymes, arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase (AANAT) and hydroxyindole O-methyltransferase (HIOMT), and melatonin receptors (MT 1 and MT 2) expression throughout pregnancy as well as the role of melatonin and its receptors in villous trophoblast syncytialization. Our data show that the melatonin generating system is expressed throughout pregnancy (from week 7 to term) in placental tissues. AANAT and HIOMT show maximal expression at the 3 rd trimester of pregnancy. MT 1 receptor expression is maximal at the 1 st trimester compared to the 2 nd and 3 rd trimesters, while MT 2 receptor expression does not change significantly during pregnancy. Moreover, during primary villous cytotrophoblast syncytialization, MT 1 receptor expression increases, while MT 2 receptor expression decreases. Treatment of primary villous cytotrophoblast with an increasing concentration of melatonin (10 pM- 1 mM) increases the fusion index (syncytium formation; 21 % augmentation at 1 mM melatonin vs. vehicle) and β-hCG secretion (121 % augmentation at 1 mM melatonin vs. vehicle). This effect of melatonin appears to be mediated via its MT 1 and MT 2 receptors. In sum, melatonin machinery (synthetizing enzymes and receptors) is expressed in human placenta throughout pregnancy and promotes syncytium formation, suggesting an essential role of this indolamine in placental function and pregnancy well-being...|$|R

However, the physiological mechanisms that underpin both the costs of reproduction {{and the benefits of}} cooperation remain poorly understood. It has been hypothesized that reproductive costs may <b>arise</b> in part <b>from</b> <b>oxidative</b> <b>stress,</b> as reproductive investment may elevate exposure to reactive oxygen species, compromising survival and future reproduction and accelerating senescence. However, experimental evidence of oxidative costs of reproduction in the wild remains scarce. Here, we use a clutch-removal experiment to investigate the oxidative costs of reproduction in a wild cooperatively breeding bird, the white-browed sparrow weaver, Plocepasser mahali. Our results reveal costs of reproduction that are dependent on group size: relative to individuals in groups whose eggs were experimentally removed, individuals in groups that raised offspring experienced an associated cost (elevated oxidative damage and reduced body mass), but only if they were in small groups containing fewer or no helpers. Furthermore, during nestling provisioning, individuals that provisioned at higher rates showed greater within-individual declines in body mass and antioxidant protection. Our results provide rare experimental evidence that reproduction can negatively impact both oxidative status and body mass in the wild, and suggest that these costs can be mitigated in cooperative societies by the presence of additional helpers. These findings have implications for our understanding of the energetic and oxidative costs of reproduction, and the benefits of cooperation in animal societies...|$|R

The NO production was assessed in 7 carriers of the haplogroup J and 27 non-J carriers, by means of the colorimetric reaction of the Griess reagent in supernatants of cultured chondrocytes. Inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) mRNA from these samples was analyzed by qPCR. Appropiated statistical analyses were performed Results Carriers of the haplogroup J showed a significantly longer telomere length of PBLs than non-J carriers, regardless of age, gender and diagnosis (p = 0. 025). Cultured chondrocytes carrying the mtDNA haplogroup J also showed a lower NO production than non-J carriers (p = 0. 043). No significant correlations between age and telomore length of PBLs were detected neither for carriers of the haplogroup J nor for non-J carriers. A strong positive correlation between NO production and iNOS expression was also observed (correlation coefficient = 0. 791, p Conclusion The protective effect of the mtDNA haplogroup J in the OA disease <b>arise</b> <b>from</b> a lower <b>oxidative</b> <b>stress</b> in carriers of this haplogroup, since this haplogroup is related to lower NO production and hence longer telomere length of PBLs too. </p...|$|R

AC 1 is activated by the eukaryotic Ca 2 +-sensor calmodulin (CaM), which contains nine methionine residues (Met) important for CaM-target interactions. During ageing, Met residues are oxidized to (S) - and (R) -methionine sulfoxide (MetSO) by reactive oxygen species <b>arising</b> <b>from</b> an age-related <b>oxidative</b> <b>stress.</b> We examined how oxidation by H 2 O 2 of Met in CaM regulates CaM activation of AC 1. We employed a series of thirteen mutant CaM proteins never assessed before in a single study, where leucine is substituted for Met, in order to analyze the effects of oxidation of specific Met. CaM activation of AC 1 is regulated by oxidation {{of all of the}} C-terminal Met in CaM, and by two N-terminal Met, M 36 and M 51. CaM with all Met oxidized is unable to activate AC 1. Activity is fully restored by the combined catalytic activities of methionine sulfoxide reductases A and B (MsrA and B), which catalyze reduction of the (S) - and (R) -MetSO stereoisomers. A small change in secondary structure is observed in wild-type CaM upon oxidation of all nine Met, but no significant secondary structure changes occur in the mutant proteins when Met residues are oxidized by H 2 O 2, suggesting that localized polarity, flexibility and structural changes promote the functional changes accompanying oxidation. The results signify that AC 1 catalytic activity can be delicately adjusted by mediating CaM activation of AC 1 by reversible Met oxidation in CaM.

Arachidonylethanolamide (AEA) is a well characterized NAE that is an endogenous ligand at cannabinoid and vanilloid receptors, but it exists in small quantities relative to other NAE types. The abundance of other NAE species, such as palmitoylethanolamine (PEA), together with their largely unknown function and receptors, has prompted us to examine the neuroprotective properties and mechanism of action of PEA. We hypothesized that PEA protects HT 22 cells <b>from</b> <b>oxidative</b> <b>stress</b> and activates neuroprotective kinase signaling pathways. Results Indeed PEA protected HT 22 cells <b>from</b> <b>oxidative</b> <b>stress</b> in part by mediating an increase in phosphorylated Akt (pAkt) and ERK 1 / 2 immunoreactivity as well as pAkt nuclear translocation. These changes take place within a time frame consistent with neuroprotection. Furthermore, we determined that changes in pAkt immunoreactivity elicited by PEA were not mediated by activation of cannabinoid receptor type 2 (CB 2), thus indicating a novel mechanism of action.
