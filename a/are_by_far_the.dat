Caridean shrimp <b>are</b> <b>by</b> <b>far</b> <b>the</b> most important food source. It also consumes polychaete worms and amphipods, and rarely penaeid prawns, molluscs, and small bony fishes. Compared to smaller rays, larger rays have a more varied diet that incorporates a greater proportion of polychaete worms.|$|E

5|$|Molluscs are {{the largest}} marine phylum, {{comprising}} about 23% of all the named marine organisms. Numerous molluscs also live in freshwater and terrestrial habitats. They are highly diverse, not just in size and in anatomical structure, but also in behaviour and in habitat. The phylum is typically divided into 9 or 10 taxonomic classes, of which two are entirely extinct. Cephalopod molluscs, such as squid, cuttlefish and octopus, {{are among the most}} neurologically advanced of all invertebrates—and either the giant squid or the colossal squid is the largest known invertebrate species. The gastropods (snails and slugs) <b>are</b> <b>by</b> <b>far</b> <b>the</b> most numerous molluscs in terms of classified species, and account for 80% of the total.|$|E
5|$|Since {{at least}} the early modern period it was a common custom to hide objects such as written charms, dried cats, horse skulls, and witch bottles in the {{structure}} of a building, but concealed shoes <b>are</b> <b>by</b> <b>far</b> <b>the</b> most common items discovered. Archaeologist Brian Hoggard has observed that the locations in which these shoes are found suggest that at least some were concealed as magical charms to protect the occupants of the building against evil influences. Such hidden caches of objects are known by archaeologists as spiritual middens.|$|E
5|$|The single-instruction-single-data (SISD) {{classification}} {{is equivalent}} to an entirely sequential program. The single-instruction-multiple-data (SIMD) classification is analogous to doing the same operation repeatedly over a large data set. This is commonly done in signal processing applications. Multiple-instruction-single-data (MISD) is a rarely used classification. While computer architectures {{to deal with this}} were devised (such as systolic arrays), few applications that fit this class materialized. Multiple-instruction-multiple-data (MIMD) programs <b>are</b> <b>by</b> <b>far</b> <b>the</b> most common type of parallel programs.|$|E

5|$|Iodous {{acid and}} iodite are even less stable and exist {{only as a}} {{fleeting}} intermediate in the oxidation of iodide to iodate, if at all. Iodates <b>are</b> <b>by</b> <b>far</b> <b>the</b> {{most important of these}} compounds, which can be made by oxidising alkali metal iodides with oxygen at 600°C and high pressure, or by oxidising iodine with chlorates. Unlike chlorates, which disproportionate very slowly to form chloride and perchlorate, iodates are stable to disproportionation in both acidic and alkaline solutions. From these, salts of most metals can be obtained. Iodic acid is most easily made by oxidation of an aqueous iodine suspension by electrolysis or fuming nitric acid. Iodate has the weakest oxidising power of the halates, but reacts the quickest.|$|E
5|$|Iron metal {{has been}} used since ancient times, {{although}} copper alloys, which have lower melting temperatures, were used even earlier in human history. Pure iron is relatively soft, but is unobtainable by smelting because it is significantly hardened and strengthened by impurities, in particular carbon, from the smelting process. A certain proportion of carbon (between 0.002% and 2.1%) produces steel, which may be up to 1000times harder than pure iron. Crude iron metal is produced in blast furnaces, where ore is reduced by coke to pig iron, which has a high carbon content. Further refinement with oxygen reduces the carbon content to the correct proportion to make steel. Steels and iron alloys formed with other metals (alloy steels) <b>are</b> <b>by</b> <b>far</b> <b>the</b> most common industrial metals {{because they have a}} great range of desirable properties and iron-bearing rock is abundant.|$|E
5|$|Most {{industrial}} applications of synthetic diamond {{have long been}} associated with their hardness; this property makes diamond the ideal material for machine tools and cutting tools. As the hardest known naturally occurring material, diamond {{can be used to}} polish, cut, or wear away any material, including other diamonds. Common {{industrial applications}} of this ability include diamond-tipped drill bits and saws, and the use of diamond powder as an abrasive. These <b>are</b> <b>by</b> <b>far</b> <b>the</b> largest industrial applications of synthetic diamond. While natural diamond is also used for these purposes, synthetic HPHT diamond is more popular, mostly because of better reproducibility of its mechanical properties. Diamond is not suitable for machining ferrous alloys at high speeds, as carbon is soluble in iron at the high temperatures created by high-speed machining, leading to greatly increased wear on diamond tools compared to alternatives.|$|E

5|$|Solitary and nocturnal, {{the common}} torpedo spends much time {{resting on the}} sea floor, often buried in sediment. It is an ambush {{predator}} that pounces onto prey and stuns them with electricity, the process taking {{only a fraction of}} a second. Once the prey is immobilized, it is manipulated to the mouth with motions of the disc, and swallowed whole. Adults feed almost entirely on small benthic bony fishes, including soles, herring, mullet, gobies, goatfishes, porgies, dragonets, and jack mackerels. Large decapod crustaceans are a minor secondary food source, while very rarely skates may be consumed. Juveniles are less exclusively piscivorous than the adults and feed on a variety of invertebrates as well. The most significant prey species differ between seasons and geographic regions. For example, in the Tyrrhenian Sea, juvenile common sole (Solea solea) <b>are</b> <b>by</b> <b>far</b> <b>the</b> most important prey item in autumn and winter, but in spring and summer they become less available and other fishes figure more prominently in the ray's diet. Known parasites of this species include the tapeworm Phyllobothrium lactuca, and the monogeneans Amphibdella paronaperugiae and Amphibdelloides benhassinae.|$|E
5|$|The VFD {{controller}} is a solid-state {{power electronics}} conversion system consisting of three distinct sub-systems: a rectifier bridge converter, a direct current (DC) link, and an inverter. Voltage-source inverter (VSI) drives (see 'Generic topologies' sub-section below) <b>are</b> <b>by</b> <b>far</b> <b>the</b> {{most common type}} of drives. Most drives are AC-AC drives in that they convert AC line input to AC inverter output. However, in some applications such as common DC bus or solar applications, drives are configured as DC-AC drives. The most basic rectifier converter for the VSI drive is configured as a three-phase, six-pulse, full-wave diode bridge. In a VSI drive, the DC link consists of a capacitor which smooths out the converter's DC output ripple and provides a stiff input to the inverter. This filtered DC voltage is converted to quasi-sinusoidal AC voltage output using the inverter's active switching elements. VSI drives provide higher power factor and lower harmonic distortion than phase-controlled current-source inverter (CSI) and load-commutated inverter (LCI) drives (see 'Generic topologies' sub-section below). The drive controller can also be configured as a phase converter having single-phase converter input and three-phase inverter output.|$|E
5|$|The short-tailed isopods {{have a short}} pleotelson and terminal, stylus-like uropods {{and have}} a {{sedentary}} lifestyle on or under the sediment on the seabed. The long-tailed isopods have a long pleotelson and broad lateral uropods {{which can be used}} in swimming. They are much more active and can launch themselves off the seabed and swim for short distances. The more advanced long-tailed isopods are mostly endemic to the southern hemisphere and may have radiated on the ancient supercontinent of Gondwana soon after it broke away from Laurasia 200 million years ago. The short-tailed forms may have been driven from the shallow seas in which they lived by increased predatory pressure from marine fish, their main predators. The development of the long-tailed forms may also have provided competition that helped force the short-tailed forms into refugia. The latter are now restricted to environments such as the deep sea, freshwater, groundwater and dry land. Isopods in the suborder Asellota <b>are</b> <b>by</b> <b>far</b> <b>the</b> most species-rich group of deep sea isopods.|$|E

5|$|There are 69 known moons of Jupiter. This gives Jupiter {{the largest}} number of moons with {{reasonably}} stable orbits of any planet in the Solar System. The most massive of the moons are the four Galilean moons, which were independently discovered in 1610 by Galileo Galilei and Simon Marius and were the first objects found to orbit a body that was neither Earth nor the Sun. From the end of the 19th century, dozens of much smaller Jovian moons have been discovered and have received the names of lovers or daughters of the Roman god Jupiter or his Greek equivalent Zeus. The Galilean moons <b>are</b> <b>by</b> <b>far</b> <b>the</b> largest and most massive objects to orbit Jupiter, with the remaining 65 moons and its rings together comprising just 0.003% of the total orbiting mass.|$|E
5|$|UNESCO {{identified}} three {{specific areas of}} concern under {{the present state of}} conservation: (i) vandalism by visitors; (ii) soil erosion in the south-eastern part of the site; and (iii) analysis and restoration of missing elements. The soft soil, the numerous earthquakes and heavy rains lead to the destabilization of the structure. Earthquakes <b>are</b> <b>by</b> <b>far</b> <b>the</b> most important contributing factors, since not only do stones fall down and arches crumble, but the earth itself can move in waves, further destroying the structure. The increasing popularity of the stupa brings in many visitors, most of whom are from Indonesia. Despite warning signs on all levels not to touch anything, the regular transmission of warnings over loudspeakers and the presence of guards, vandalism on reliefs and statues is a common occurrence and problem, leading to further deterioration. As of 2009, there is no system in place {{to limit the number of}} visitors allowed per day or to introduce mandatory guided tours only.|$|E
5|$|Viruses <b>are</b> <b>by</b> <b>far</b> <b>the</b> most {{abundant}} biological entities on Earth and they outnumber {{all the others}} put together. They infect all types of cellular life including animals, plants, bacteria and fungi. However, different types of viruses can infect only a limited range of hosts and many are species-specific. Some, such as smallpox virus for example, can infect only one species – in this case humans, and {{are said to have}} a narrow host range. Other viruses, such as rabies virus, can infect different species of mammals and are said to have a broad range. The viruses that infect plants are harmless to animals, and most viruses that infect other animals are harmless to humans. The host range of some bacteriophages is limited to a single strain of bacteria and they can be used to trace the source of outbreaks of infections by a method called phage typing.|$|E

5|$|Western {{observers}} such as James Emerson Tennent (1858) and Charles Gabriel Seligman (1911) have {{termed the}} social group Coast Veddahs, Coast Verdas or East Coast Veddas. Anthropologists have considered {{them to be}} at least partly descended from the Veddas of the interior of the island who had migrated at some unknown period in the past to the east coast, intermarrying with the local Tamils. Interior Veddas clans themselves have a number of divisions, each claiming either Sinhalese, Tamil, mixed, or pure Vedda lineages. Vedda identity also depends on whether these clans are hunter-gatherers or settled agriculturalists. Settled Veddas have tended {{over a period of time}} to assume Sinhalese or Tamil identity based on the area of residence. If considered a subdivision of Veddas, then they <b>are</b> <b>by</b> <b>far</b> <b>the</b> largest sub-group amongst the Vedda people. Residents of Eastern Province consider those who maintain a primitive life style, or are partly dependent on hunting and gathering, as Vedar without any connotations of ethnic origins.|$|E
