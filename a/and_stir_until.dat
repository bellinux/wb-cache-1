50|$|A {{quick way}} to make casein {{painting}} medium is to take some skim milk cottage cheese and first wash off any of the milky fluids.

As the mixture is stirred while it warms it begins to froth and the lumps dissolve. It is not boiled but kept simmering <b>and</b> <b>stirred</b> <b>until</b> the frothing stops.
