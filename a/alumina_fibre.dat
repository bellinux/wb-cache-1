40|$|Modern {{society has}} become reliant on battery powered {{electronic}} {{devices such as}} cell phones and laptop computers. The standard way of recharging these devices is by connecting to a reticulated electricity supply. In situations with no electricity supply some other recharging method is required. Such a possibility is a small, portable, generator based on fuel cell technology, specifically mini-tubular solid oxide fuel cells (MT-SOFC). MT-SOFCs have been developed since the 1990 s but there is limited analysis, discussion or research on developing and constructing a portable generator based on MT-SOFC technology. Such a generator, running on a portable gas supply, requires combining the key aspects of cell performance, a heating and fuel reforming system, and cell manifolds. Cell design, fuel type, fuel flow rate, current-collection method and operating temperature all greatly affected MT-SOFCs performance. Segmenting the cathode significantly increased the power output. Maximum power density from an electrolyte supported MT-SOFC was 140 mW/cm 2. The partial oxidation reactor (POR) developed provided the required heat to maintain the MT-SOFCs at an operating temperature suitable for generating electricity. The exhaust gas from the POR was a suitable fuel for MT-SOFCs, having sufficient carbon monoxide and hydrogen to generate electricity. Various manifold materials were evaluated including solid metal blocks and folded sheet metal. It was found that manifolds made from easily worked <b>alumina</b> <b>fibre</b> board decreased the thermal stresses and therefore the fracture rate of the MT-SOFCs. The final prototype developed comprised a partial oxidation reactor and MT-SOFCs mounted in <b>alumina</b> <b>fibre</b> board manifolds within a well-insulated enclosure, which could be run on LPG. Calculated efficiency of the final prototype was 4 %. If all the carbon monoxide and hydrogen produced by the partial oxidation reactor were converted to electrical energy, efficiency would increase to 39 %. Under ideal conditions, efficiency would be 78 %. Efficiency of the prototype can be improved by increasing the fuel and oxygen utilisation ratios, ensuring heat from the exhaust gases is transferred to the incoming gases, and improving the methods for collecting current at both the anode and cathode...|$|E

Their biodurabilities were tested at pH 7. 4 with lung airway epithelial lining fluid or serum ultrafiltrate (SUF) and at pH 4. 5 with macrophage phagolysosomal simulant fluid (PSF). Potential to generate free radicals was tested in vitro. Through the variation in the soak temperature from 650 20 C to 950 20 C (experiments S 650 -S 950), the heating protocol affected the morphological characteristics, crystal structure, surface area, and density of the <b>alumina</b> <b>fibres</b> while their dissolution half-times were not significantly affected in SUF or PSF. Fibre samples formed at different heating ramp rates (experiments R 93 -R 600) showed significant variation in the dissolution rates with the highest ramp rate corresponding to the highest dissolution rate. Thus, by increasing the calcination temperature ramp rate the <b>alumina</b> <b>fibres</b> may be produced that have reduced biodurability and lower inflammogenic potential.

40|$|Aluminium matrix {{composites}} {{have been}} fabricated by squeeze casting into short fibre preforms modified {{on the basis}} of a phase contiguity model to improve mechanical performance. Fibre junctions were created in a planar random <b>alumina</b> <b>fibre</b> array by (a) sintering, (b) phosphoric acid treatment, (c) phosphoric acid/aluminium hydroxide (P/Al) treatment and (d) infiltration with alumina powder and sintering. The microstructures and mechanical properties of these composites were examined systematically. The results indicate that using phosphoric acid solution itself to create inter-fibre bonds in the preform gave rise to very low composite strength and ductility compared with that resulting from the as-received preform. This is mainly due to the severe damage to the fibres caused by chemical reaction. By employing the P/Al binder to create the cross-links, the composites reinforced with laboratory-made preforms yielded higher tensile strength relative to the uniform fibre reinforced composites without any sacrifice to the ductility and elastic modulus. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.

Composite wires produced using the continuous process are suitable {{to simplify the}} introduction of fibre reinforcements into aluminium castings {{as well as the}} production of double composite, sandwich and preferentially reinforced structures.

Composite wires were produced with different infiltration pressure (0. 83 MPa, 1. 03 MPa, 1. 24 MPa, 1. 52 MPa, and 1. 65 MPa) to determine the correlation between infiltration pressure and the porosity of wires. 10 grinded cross-sectional samples were made from each type of composite wires. Based on the micrographs of these samples the volume fraction of aluminium was determined by image analysis, which also yielded information on the porosity of wires.

Square shaped samples (length 400 mm) are used, heated from above and settled on a water cooled calorimeter system to obtain a one dimensional steady state temperature field. The heat is supplied by electrical heating elements freely hanging inside a furnace which is completely constructed from ceramic components to withstand temperatures up to about 1800 °C.

To produce composite materials porous performs were prepared. They are characterized by the suitable permeability and good strength required to resist stresses arising during squeeze casting process. Performs exhibited semi-oriented arrangement of fibres and open porosity enabled producing of composite materials 10 % (in vol. %) of Al 2 O 3 fibres (Saffil).

40|$|Glass matrix {{composites}} {{based on}} NextelTM <b>alumina</b> <b>fibre</b> reinforced borosilicate glass have been fabricated {{to improve their}} mechanical property and fracture toughness. In this work, a novel processing technique, which is called “sandwich” hot-pressing, has been used. It consists of arranging the reinforcing fibres in two directions with a periodic interspacing between glass slides, and submitting the material to a heat-treatment for consolidation into highly dense and transparent composites, which were proved by XRD analysis and SEM observations. These composites’ mechanical, optical and microstructural properties were studied and compared {{to those of the}} unidirectional fibre reinforced borosilicate glass composite and unreinforced glass matrix produced under the same conditions. Furthermore, a hybrid sol-gel technique has been employed for coating the fibres with a smooth and crack free ZrO 2 interfacial layer to provide a weak bonding at the fibre/matrix interface to promote fibre pull-out during fracture. ZrO 2 coated and uncoated fibre-reinforced borosilicate glass matrix composites were fabricated, with different sizes of optical windows including 4 x 4, 5 x 5 and 6 x 6 cm 2. Moreover, a geometry based equation was derived to evaluate the expected light transmittance of the composites. These multi-directional fibre reinforced glass matrix composites retained at least 50 % of the light transmittance and higher flexural strength compared with the unreinforced glass matrix. The highest measured flexural strength value of these composites was 56 ± 7 MPa. The composites reinforced by ZrO 2 coated fibres had higher flexural strength (approx. 36 %) and lower standard deviation (approx. 47 %) compared with those reinforced by uncoated fibres. The introduction of a ZrO 2 interfacial layer was to improve the mechanical properties and to retain the composites’ integrity, which was proved by the observations of fibre pull-out and crack deflection upon failure during mechanical tests. To investigate the microstructure of the interfacial layer in the composite, SEM, FIB-SIMS and TEM were employed.

40|$|This study {{involved}} two avenues of investigation: {{a new concept}} of Direct Carbon Fuel Cell (DCFC) {{and the production of}} carbon from biomass. The new concept of DCFC merges a solid oxide electrolyte and a molten carbonate electrolyte called the “hybrid direct carbon fuel cell” using tubular geometry. The tubular cell was chosen for several reasons, such as sealing process, reduction of stress during the sintering process and reduction of the final size of the stack. In addition, it makes the fuelling process easier than in planar geometry. The previous tests carried out on tubular hybrid direct carbon fuel cell at the University of St Andrews showed promising results. In fact, a power of 85 mW was achieved at 800 ºC. However this temperature was too high and so the focus of the new project was on decreasing the operating temperature to 650 ºC, replacing the YSZ electrolyte used in the previous configuration with an electrolyte such as GDC, which showed better performance at low temperature. YSZ was substituted for GDC in the anodes and cathode in order to prevent an increase in the interface resistance due to the possible reaction between electrolyte and electrodes at the interface. Anodes with different proportions of NiO and GDC were investigated {{in order to understand the}} electrochemical phenomena in the presence of GDC compared to YSZ. Three different electrical configurations were investigated by AC impedance studies because the electrochemistry of the cell changes as function of the position and the surface of the current collector, which is dipped into the anode chamber. Performance improved when the surface area of the current collector increased, which combined a silver wire with strip of nickel mesh. Two types of seals (552 ceramabond and ToKu adhesive) and the sealing process were also studied in order to prevent leakage, which affects the performance of the entire cell.

40|$|Geopolymers {{have been}} {{suggested}} in the literature as matrix materials for fibre reinforced composites due to a unique combination of low-temperature synthesis and high temperature stability. This study investigated several key aspects of fibre reinforced geopolymer matrix composites {{in order to improve}} the basic knowledge of these materials. It was demonstrated that geopolymer matrix composites show great potential as fire-resistant materials for near room temperature applications. In particular, basalt fibre composites were of great interest due to their comparatively low cost and good mechanical performance. Microstructural investigations indicated that basalt fibres can potentially be used in geopolymer matrices up to 600 °C. However, the success of the application of geopolymer matrix composites at higher temperatures is seen as critical and depends on further development of suitable matrices. Several compositions within a sodium-metahalloysite model matrix system were evaluated in order to identify a suitable formulation for composite fabrication. An average compressive strength of ~ 79 MPa and flexural strength and modulus of ~ 10 MPa and 8. 5 GPa, respectively, were achieved for the best batch of the main matrix composition. By optimising the matrix composition, the mechanical properties could be significantly improved, achieving an extremely high maximum compressive strength value of 145 MPa. Issues with reproducibility and the influence of various aspects of the fabrication process are discussed. The room temperature flexural properties of unidirectional fibre reinforced composite bars with basalt, carbon and alumina fibres were investigated. Besides the fibre type, the effects of several other parameters including fibre sizing, matrix strength, span-to-depth ratio and specimen dimensions on the flexural properties and the failure behaviour of the composites were studied. Significant improvements to the mechanical properties were achieved with all fibre types. However, the mechanical behaviour was highly influenced by the elastic modulus of the fibre. Furthermore, it was shown that the composite properties were affected by the overall sample dimensions, the testing span and the mixing time of the geopolymer binder. The <b>alumina</b> <b>fibre</b> composites achieved the highest flexural stress with a maximum value of 470 MPa and a fibre content of ~ 30 vol. -%. Basalt and carbon fibre composites showed maximum flexural strength values around 200 MPa. Although all composite types displayed considerable post-fracture strength, only the basalt composites failed in tensile mode. The applicability of the weak matrix composites (WMC) concept to describe the mechanical behaviour of geopolymer matrix composites was discussed. The fibre-matrix interactions were analysed between room temperature and 1000 °C by means of electron microscopy, EDS and x-ray diffraction. All fibres were found to be chemically stable under the highly alkaline conditions of the geopolymer synthesis and showed no significant reaction with the geopolymer matrix at room temperature. The results indicate that basalt fibre composites may be used up to 600 °C without significant degradation of the fibre. The heating of the carbon fibre composites to 600 °C had drastic effect on the strength and integrity of the composite, in particular, when using sized carbon fibres. The alumina fibres showed good wetting and bonding behaviour but otherwise little reaction with the matrix even after heating to 1000 °C...|$|E

40|$|In {{the first}} part of this thesis the {{influence}} of silicon (Si) alloying on the thermal stability of alumina thin films was investigated by means of transmission electron microscopy (TEM). These alumina thin films were deposited by filtered cathodic arc (FCA) and by magnetron sputter ion plating (MSIP). Amorphous and crystalline FCA alumina thin films were deposited on Si wafers, and crystalline MSIP alumina thin films were deposited on Si wafers and on cemented carbide cutting tools. The thin films were annealed at elevated temperatures before TEM investigations to determine their thermal stability. In the second part of this thesis MSIP alumina thin films, deposited on cemented carbide cutting tools, were investigated in the TEM after using them in several cutting tests. Furthermore, so called WHIPOX-material was investigated. WHIPOX is an <b>alumina</b> <b>fibre</b> matrix composite with a porous matrix. TEM investigations of Al 2 O 3 thin films showed that Si-alloying stabilizes the amorphous and the gamma-Al 2 O 3 phases. Si-alloying of the amorphous FCA Al 2 O 3 thin film led to at least a 290 °C higher crystallization temperature. In addition investigations of annealed thin films showed that Si-alloying increases the thermal stability of gamma-Al 2 O 3 by at least 100 °C. The morphology of the porous, nanocrystalline FCA gamma-Al 2 O 3 layer was stabilized to a 300 °C higher temperature. By Si-alloying of crystalline MSIP Al 2 O 3 thin films deposited on Si wafers, the thermal stability range of gamma-Al 2 O 3 was increased by 100 °C and the formation temperature of the alpha-Al 2 O 3 -phase was increased by 250 °C. Moreover Si influenced the phase-transfomation sequence: The unalloyed crystalline MSIP Al 2 O 3 thin film showed a direct transition of the gamma- into the alpha-phase, while the Si alloyed MSIP Al 2 O 3 thin film first transformed into theta- before the formation of alpha-Al 2 O 3 was observed. By using another substrate, such as cemented carbide cutting tools coated with (Ti,Al) N for improved adhesion, the coating system could be used in cutting tests. However, investigations of the annealed coating system proved, that a (Ti,Al) N-layer decreases the thermal stability range of gamma-Al 2 O 3 : The formation of alpha-Al 2 O 3 is accompanied by the decomposition of the metastable, cubic (Ti,Al) N-layer into the cubic TiN- and the hexagonal AlN-phase, the oxidation of the (Ti,Al) N-layer and the Ti-diffusion into the Al 2 O 3 -layer. The thermal stability of gamma-Al 2 O 3 could be enhanced by annealing in vacuum instead of annealing in atmosphere as well as by Si-alloying of the Al 2 O 3 - and (Ti,Al) N-layers. The combined results lead to the assumption that Si was not incorporated into the Al 2 O 3 -lattice, but segregated preferentially as amorphous Si or SiO 2 at grain boundaries of the nanocrystalline gamma-Al 2 O 3 -grains and thereby reduced diffusion and hence crystal growth. Thus, gamma-Al 2 O 3 was presumably stabilized due to Si-alloying by stabilizing the size of the nanocrystals. In case of the Si-alloyed Al 2 O 3 /(Ti,Al) N-layers deposited on cemented carbide, the Si alloying of the (Ti,Al) N-layer can also explain the stabilization of gamma-Al 2 O 3. Less (Ti,Al) N-layer-oxidation can also be explained by the amorphization effect of Si-alloying on the Al 2 O 3 -layer, which was observed for all crystalline FCA and MSIP Al 2 O 3 thin films. The higher the amorphous content, the less grain boundaries and therefore possible diffusion pathways for O, Al and Ti exist. Investigations of the MSIP Al 2 O 3 /(Ti,Al) N-coating system after use in cutting tests of a case hardening steel, showed that it could withstand the thermomechanical stress at selected cutting parameters. Neither delamination of the coating nor phase transformation was observed. Investigation of WHIPOX-material sintered at 1200 °C showed the existence of small, below 100 nm in size, Y-stabilized ZrO 2 -nanoparticles homogeneously dispersed within the Al 2 O 3 -matrix. Moreover it showed that the ZrO 2 -particles got into the matrix during preparation and that they could be found between Al 2 O 3 -matrix grains and between fibre-matrix grains and therefore could influence the sintering activity. This presumption was confirmed by the result that ZrO 2 -free prepared WHIPOX-samples showed higher sintering activities than ZrO 2 -containing samples. Furthermore the sintering activity was enhanced by increasing the sintering temperature to 1300 °C...|$|E
40|$|Two {{types of}} alumina ceramic {{membrane}} in hollow fibre shape {{was used in}} this study. Both <b>alumina</b> hollow <b>fibres</b> (AHF) were sintered at different temperatures; (a) 1350 oC and (b) 1450 oC. In order to improve the catalytic activity of the alumina membrane for oxygen separation purposes, surface modification of the membranes was carried out using La 0. 6 Sr 0. 4 Co 0. 2 Fe 0. 8 O 3 -δ (LSCF) perovskite catalyst. LSCF was synthesised using simple Pechini sol-gel method. The evaporation time and temperature of the LSCF-sol were varied to obtain various viscosity of catalytic sol. From XRD analysis, pure LSCF perovskite structure formed at temperature at 850 oC. The morphological of unmodified and surface-modified <b>alumina</b> hollow <b>fibre</b> membranes (AHF) were studied using FESEM. The effect of LSCF catalytic sol viscosity was studied and it was found that as the viscosity of the sol increases, the amount of catalyst deposited on the <b>alumina</b> hollow <b>fibre</b> were increased. Besides, the amount of catalyst deposited on 1350 AHF was found to be higher than 1450 AHF. This result is supported by the result of pore distribution data whereby 1350 AHF was observed to be more porous than 1450 AHF, with porosity percentage of 40. 38 % and 28. 80 %, respectively. Although higher viscosity of catalytic sol could lead to a high amount of catalyst deposited on the AHF substrate, there is a tendency for micro-cracks to develop. Thus, the viscosity of the catalytic sol is important to control in order to have higher oxygen permeation flux...|$|R

Oxide ceramic matrix composites (CMC) are reliable candidates for this purpose. Within this scope, the German funded project HiPOC (High Performance Oxide Ceramics) supports the further development of OXIPOL (Oxide CMC based on Polymers) materials at the German Aerospace Center (DLR) in Stuttgart. The OXIPOL materials studied in this work are manufactured via the polymer infiltration and pyrolysis process (PIP) and reinforced with <b>alumina</b> <b>fibres</b> (Nextel 610, 3 M).

40|$|The {{availability}} of inorganic membranes which can withstand high temperatures and harsh chemical environments {{has resulted in}} a wide range of opportunities for the application of membranes in chemical reactions and separations. In particular, the combination of membrane separation and catalytic reaction into a single operating unit is an attractive way to increase conversions, improve yields and more efficient use of natural resources in many reactions. In this study, asymmetric <b>alumina</b> hollow <b>fibres</b> with different macrostructures consisting of finger-like macrovoids and a sponge-like packed pore structure in varying ratios have been prepared by a combined phase inversion/sintering technique. The asymmetric membranes in hollow fibre geometry possess superior surface area to volume ratios with less gas permeation resistance in comparison to commercial symmetric membranes in tubular and disk configurations. Such asymmetric hollow fibres are used as substrates onto which a Pd membrane is directly deposited by an electroless plating (ELP) technique without any pre-treatment of the substrate surface. A systematic study of the electroless plating of Pd and Ag onto an asymmetric <b>alumina</b> hollow <b>fibre</b> substrate has been carried out by direct measurement of one of the gaseous products, i. e. N 2, using gas chromatography (GC). In addition, the influences of the substrate macrostructure on hydrogen permeation through the Pd/Al 2 O 3 composite membranes have been investigated both experimentally and theoretically. Furthermore, a multifunctional Pd/alumina hollow fibre membrane reactor (HFMR) has been developed and employed for the catalytic dehydrogenation of methylcyclohexane (MCH) to toluene (TOL). The developed HFMR consists of a thin and defect-free Pd membrane coated directly onto the outer surface of an asymmetric <b>alumina</b> hollow <b>fibre</b> substrate. 50 wt% Ni/Al 2 O 3 nano-sized catalysts were directly impregnated into the substrate. The performance of HFMR has also been compared with several different reactor configurations.

40|$|Purpose: The {{effects of}} the applied load and {{graphite}} volume fraction on dry-sliding friction and wear propertiesof hybrid composite reinforced with <b>alumina</b> <b>fibres</b> and graphite in form of fibres or flakes were investigated. Design/methodology/approach: The tests were carried out on preforms with about 6. 5 to 15. 0 % (all thepercentages v/v) of Al 2 O 3 fibres (Saffil) and 1. 5 to 12. 0 % of graphite, infiltrated using the squeeze casting method. Porous preforms possess suitable permeability, good strength and reveal semi-oriented arrangement of fibresand graphite flakes. The composite microstructure exhibit regular arrangement of fibres and rather poor bondingbetween matrix and graphite. Dry wear tests were carried out using a wear tester at constant sliding velocity and under various loads, which inrelation to diameter of specimens corresponds to pressure of P 1 = 0. 81; P 2 = 1. 23; P 3 = 1. 53 MPa. Findings: Comparison of wear losses for monolithic Al-Si 7 alloy and its composites reveals that alumina fibresconsiderably improve this property but addition of graphite also protects from seizure. The composites reinforcedwith graphite fibres were less sensitive to the applied load than both the matrix and the composites reinforced withgraphite flakes. Research limitations/implications: Proposed method {{can be used for}} manufacturing of hybrid compositewith graphite fibers less than 10 vol. % due to problems with producing of the uniform microstructure.
