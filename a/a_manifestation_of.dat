5|$|A {{criticism}} of New Age often made by leftists {{is that its}} focus on individualism deflects participants from engaging in socio-political activism.

5|$|O'Malley's detractors {{say that}} he was not a visionary for taking {{baseball}} west. They say the game was naturally heading toward geographical expansion and O'Malley just an opportunist.

5|$|Although not {{traditionally}} {{regarded as}} an apotropaic, mirrors {{have been used to}} ward off vampires when placed, facing outwards, on a door (in some cultures, vampires do not have a reflection and sometimes do not cast a shadow, perhaps as <b>a</b> <b>manifestation</b> <b>of</b> the vampire's lack of a soul). This attribute is not universal (the Greek vrykolakas/tympanios was capable of both reflection and shadow), but was used by Bram Stoker in Dracula and has remained popular with subsequent authors and filmmakers.|$|E

5|$|Dhumavati is <b>a</b> <b>manifestation</b> <b>of</b> the anti-social and inauspicious {{elements}} in women {{and is an}} antithesis to the goddess Lakshmi. Like Alakshmi, Dhumavati rules over the four months of the rainy season, when even solar light is obscured by the evil water spirit. This coincides with Chaturmas, a period during the year when the god Vishnu sleeps. At that time, darkness rules and the soul loses its usual luster. This period is considered inauspicious, and as such as no auspicious ceremonies like marriage can take place.|$|E
5|$|During Hygeberht's archbishopric, joint synods for {{the provinces}} of Lichfield and Canterbury were held, presided over by both archbishops. These gatherings were canonically irregular, as the usual {{procedure}} was for each province to hold its own synod. The reasons for holding joint councils are unclear; {{they may have been}} <b>a</b> <b>manifestation</b> <b>of</b> Offa's desire to supervise the entire southern church, or an attempt by the archbishops of Canterbury to retain some authority over the province of Lichfield.|$|E
5|$|His {{aversion to}} the {{imposition}} of a rules-based society led him to denounce, as <b>a</b> <b>manifestation</b> <b>of</b> the people's 'mental enslavement', the foundations of law, property rights and even the institution of marriage. He considered the basic foundations of society as constraining the natural development of individuals to use their powers of reasoning to arrive at a mutually beneficial method of social organisation. In each case, government and its institutions are shown to constrain the development of our capacity to live wholly in accordance with the full and free exercise of private judgement.|$|E

5|$|Some of Swaminarayan's {{followers}} {{believe he}} was an incarnation of Lord Krishna. The images and stories of Swaminarayan and Krishna have coincided in the liturgy of the sect. The story {{of the birth of}} Swaminarayan parallels that of Krishna's birth from the scripture Bhagavata Purana. Swaminarayan himself is said to have intimated that he was <b>a</b> <b>manifestation</b> <b>of</b> God in a meeting with Reginald Heber, the Lord Bishop of Calcutta, in 1825.|$|E
5|$|The Annamalaiyar temple {{is one of}} the Pancha Bhoota Stalams, or five Shiva temples, {{with each}} <b>a</b> <b>manifestation</b> <b>of</b> a natural element: land, water, air, sky and fire. In Annamalaiyar temple, Shiva is said to have {{manifested}} himself as a massive column of fire, whose crown and feet could not be found by the Hindu gods, Brahma and Vishnu. The main lingam in the shrine is referred as Agni Lingam, and represents duty, virtue, self-sacrifice and liberation through ascetic life {{at the end of the}} Agni kalpa.|$|E
5|$|The {{complex is}} {{markedly}} {{different from those}} built during the 4th Dynasty (c. 2613–2494 BC) in its size, architecture and location, being at Saqqara rather than Gizah.

Some 1500 years after its construction, the pyramid complex was restored under Ramses II. During the much later Saite period (664–525 BC), it was used as a cemetery.|$|E

5|$|The {{founder of}} the Hindu sect Pushtimarg – Vallabhacharya (1479–1531) is {{believed}} to have visited Pandharpur at least twice and was ordered to marry by Vithoba (called Vitthalnath or Vitthalnathji in the sect) and have children so that he could be born as Vallabhacharya's son. Later, Vallabhacharya married. His second son and successor was recognized as <b>a</b> <b>manifestation</b> <b>of</b> Vithoba and named Vitthalnath, also known as Gusainji.|$|E
5|$|The historiography of Vithoba and his cult {{is an area}} of {{continuing}} debate, even regarding his name. Various Indologists have proposed a prehistory for Vithoba worship where he was previously: a hero stone, a pastoral deity, <b>a</b> <b>manifestation</b> <b>of</b> Shiva, a Jain saint, or even all of these at various times for various devotees. Though the origins of both his cult and his main temple are likewise debated, there is clear evidence that they already existed by the 13th century.|$|E
