5|$|For centuries, {{oyster farming}} {{has been a}} {{mainstay}} of the surrounding economy. However, in December 2009, commercial harvesting was suspended after the norovirus was discovered in several exported crops, resulting in <b>a</b> <b>recall.</b>|$|E

5|$|In International elite competition, {{electronically}} tethered starting blocks {{sense the}} reaction {{time of the}} athletes. If the athlete reacts in less than 0.1 second, an alert sounds for <b>a</b> <b>recall</b> starter and the offending athlete is guilty of a false start.|$|E

40|$|The current {{research}} challenges the widespread truism that <b>recalling</b> <b>a</b> positive self necessarily increases self-esteem, whereas <b>recalling</b> <b>a</b> negative self necessarily decreases self-esteem. Four experiments demonstrate that chronically happy people show a relative increase in self-esteem by <b>recalling</b> either <b>a</b> positive or a negative self. Chronically sad people, however, show a relative decrease in self-esteem by <b>recalling</b> either <b>a</b> positive or a negative self. These effects {{are due to}} divergent perceptions of mood congruence between the recalled self and the current self. Specifically, happy people perceive high mood congruence between <b>a</b> <b>recalled</b> positive self and the current self but low mood congruence between <b>a</b> <b>recalled</b> negative self and the current self. In contrast, sad people perceive high mood congruence between <b>a</b> <b>recalled</b> negative self and the current self but low mood congruence between <b>a</b> <b>recalled</b> positive self and the current self. Independent of chronic mood, mood congruence leads to perceptions of temporal recency, whereas mood incongruence leads to perceptions of temporal distance. In line with the inclusion-exclusion model of social judgment, perceived temporal recency elicits assimilation effects on self-esteem, whereas perceived temporal distance elicits contrast effects on self-esteem...|$|R

5|$|Heskey was {{recalled}} {{into the}} England squad for the 2006 FIFA World Cup qualifiers against Northern Ireland and Azerbaijan in 2005, {{after having been}} dropped following the match against Ukraine in August 2004.

5|$|In 2008, <b>a</b> <b>recall</b> {{vote was}} held asking if 2003 inductee Chris Benoit, who {{killed his wife}} and son before {{committing}} suicide in June 2007, should remain in the hall. To have Benoit removed, Meltzer required that 60% of voters must agree with the proposal. Although the majority voted for Benoit's removal, they only represented 53.6% of the votes, falling short of the number required. Benoit remains on the list of inductees.|$|E
5|$|In desperation, the England {{selectors}} {{turned to}} 35-year-old Graham Gooch, stalwart opening batsman, as their fourth {{captain of the}} series, for the Fifth Test at The Oval. England also replaced Cowdrey with DeFreitas, dropped Gower for Matthew Maynard, and replaced the injured Allan Lamb with Rob Bailey, <b>a</b> <b>recall</b> and two Test debuts respectively. The tourists replaced the youngster Keith Arthurton with Greenidge, who had recovered from an injury.|$|E

5|$|In late 2006, India's ODI team {{began to}} hit rocky waters. After losing a {{bilateral}} {{series in the}} West Indies, they were knocked out of a triangular tournament in Malaysia ahead of the finals, and were eliminated {{in the first round}} of the 2006 ICC Champions Trophy on home soil. Kartik took four wickets at 34.00 and an economy rate of 5.36 in the Challenger Trophy and could not earn <b>a</b> <b>recall.</b> He had a steady domestic first-class season, taking 26 wickets at 25.53 in nine matches, never taking more than five wickets in a match. He took 13 wickets at 27.92 in eight one-day matches for the season, and was overlooked as Kumble and Harbhajan were the spinners selected for the 2007 Cricket World Cup. India were knocked out in the first round after losing to Bangladesh, and Harbhajan was dropped while Kumble retired from ODIs, but Kartik did not do enough to persuade the selectors to hand him <b>a</b> <b>recall.</b>|$|E

5|$|The revolt {{took place}} in a period of turmoil for Aberhart and his government: besides the {{dissident}} backbenchers, half of the cabinet resigned or was fired over a period of less than a year.

25|$|In the end, Gayle {{was chosen}} as one-day captain, with Shivnarine Chanderpaul {{assuming}} vice-captaincy duties. Also, one-day specialists Austin Richards, Dwayne Smith and <b>a</b> <b>recalled</b> Simmons were called in to replace Joseph, Ganga and Corey Collymore.|$|R
5|$|According to Quirky, Wink {{products}} were in 300,000 homes by 2015. In April 2015 Wink experienced a security problem that made {{many of its}} hubs go offline or break, forcing the company to issue <b>a</b> <b>recall.</b> The recall caused a several-month inventory backlog and subsequent shortage of the Wink hub. Due to financial difficulties, {{due in part to}} the recall, Quirky began looking for buyers to sell Wink to in 2015. That November, after Quirky went through bankruptcy proceedings, it sold Wink for $15 million to Flextronics (now called Flex), to whom Quirky owed $18.7 million. Flex was Wink's primary supplier of firmware and hardware. Wink continues to operate as an independent subsidiary of Flex. As of 2016, 1.3 million devices are connected to Wink.|$|E
5|$|After the 1934 tour, Woodfull and Ponsford—Australia's first-choice opening pair—retired, leaving {{vacancies}} in the Test team. Fingleton scored {{four centuries}} {{and was the}} leading run-scorer during the 1934–35 domestic season to earn <b>a</b> <b>recall</b> to the Australian team for the 1935–36 tour of South Africa. From that point onwards until the outbreak of World War II, he opened the batting with his New South Wales partner Bill Brown. With Bradman absent due to illness, it was the happiest time of Fingleton's career, and he scored centuries in three consecutive innings as Australia won {{each of the last}} three Tests by an innings. In the Fourth Test, he and Brown put on the first double century opening partnership for Australia in a Test.|$|E
5|$|After the {{war ended}} in 1945, {{first-class}} cricket resumed in 1945–46. Harvey played in a trial match for state selection. Playing for the Rest of Victoria against the first-choice state team, he made 82 and 25. This {{was not enough to}} convince the state selectors and Harvey did not get <b>a</b> <b>recall</b> to the Victorian team {{until the end of the}} season when he played against South Australia at the Adelaide Oval. He responded by striking a career-best 163 to help his team to an innings win.|$|E

5|$|As a free agent, Babangida {{underwent}} a successful trial at Chinese side Tianjin Teda {{in the summer}} of 2003. The move, however, was put off due to the outbreak of SARS in China, and Babangida signed with the second-tier side Changchun Yatai shortly after. His four goals {{in the second part of}} the season helped his team to the Jia B title and earned him <b>a</b> <b>recall</b> to the national team for their preparations for the 2004 African Cup of Nations. Babangida scored four more goals for Yatai the following season before retiring in 2004.|$|E
5|$|Before the 1998–99 {{campaign}} began, Gascoigne began {{suffering from}} blackouts after blaming {{himself for the}} death of a friend, who died after Gascoigne and a group of friends went on a night out drinking. Despite his ongoing personal problems and his spell in rehab, Gascoigne started the season in good form and helped Middlesbrough into fourth place by Christmas. They ended the season in ninth place and having scored three goals in 26 top-flight games Gascoigne was linked with <b>a</b> <b>recall</b> to the England squad, who were now managed by former teammate Kevin Keegan and lacking a creative presence in midfield.|$|E
5|$|In 1947 Agnew {{graduated}} as Bachelor of Laws {{and passed}} the Maryland bar examination. He started his own law practice in downtown Baltimore, but was not successful, and {{took a job as}} an insurance investigator. A year later, he moved to Schreibers, a supermarket chain, where his main role was that of a store detective. He stayed there for four years, a period briefly interrupted in 1951 by <b>a</b> <b>recall</b> to the army after the outbreak of the Korean War. He resigned from Schreibers in 1952, and resumed his legal practice, specializing in labor law.|$|E

5|$|On June 3, 2013, BFDF {{turned in}} over 16,000 {{signatures}} petitioning to recall Morse to the Colorado Secretary of State, Republican Scott Gessler, of which only 7,178 {{needed to be}} certified in order to force <b>a</b> <b>recall</b> election. In addition, over 13,000 signatures were turned in to recall Giron, of which 11,285 needed to be certified. Efforts to recall McLachlan failed, collecting only about 8,500 signatures of the 10,587 needed. Likewise, the efforts to recall Hudak also failed, falling short of the 18,962 signatures needed.|$|E
5|$|On October 4, 2013, Colorado Secretary of State Scott Gessler {{approved}} a second petition to recall Colorado State Senator Evie Hudak, also {{an advocate of}} gun control; the signature gatherers had 60 days to collect 18,300 or more signatures to force <b>a</b> <b>recall</b> election in Colorado Senate District 19 which encompasses Arvada, Colorado and Westminster, Colorado. Hudak later resigned rather than face recall. Because she resigned, the Democrats were able to appoint a replacement; {{if she had been}} recalled, the Republicans could have gained a majority in the state senate.|$|E
5|$|The SG-1000's launch did {{not prove}} to be successful. The three launch games, {{all of which were}} ported from Sega's VIC dual-arcade board, lacked the name {{recognition}} of Famicom launch games Donkey Kong, Donkey Kong Jr., and Popeye. However, the situation was quickly turned around. Thanks in part to the SG-1000's steadier stream of releases (21 SG-1000 games by the end of 1983, as compared to only 9 Famicom games), and in part to <b>a</b> <b>recall</b> on Famicom units necessitated by a faulty circuit, the SG-1000 chalked up 160,000 units in sales in 1983, far exceeding Sega's projection of 50,000 units.|$|E
