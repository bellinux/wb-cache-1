5|$|In the 1880s, Alfred Comyn Lyall, an {{administrator}} of the British Raj who also studied history, revisited Tod's classification and asserted that the Rajput society was in fact tribal, based on kinship rather than feudal vassalage. He had previously generally agreed with Tod, who acknowledged claims that blood-ties played some sort of role {{in the relationship between}} princes and vassals in many states. In shifting the emphasis from a feudal to a tribal basis, Lyall was able to deny the possibility that the Rajput kingdoms might gain sovereignty. If Rajput society was not feudal, then it was not on the same trajectory that European nations had followed, thereby forestalling <b>any</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> consider that they might evolve into sovereign states. There was thus no need for Britain to consider itself to be illegitimately governing them.|$|E
5|$|The Serjeants only enjoyed their {{returned}} {{status for}} another six years, however, before Parliament intervened. The Practitioners in Common Pleas Act 1846, from 18 August 1846, allowed all barristers {{to practice in}} the Court of Common Pleas. The next and final blow was the Judicature Act 1873, which came into force on 1 November 1875. Section 8 provided that common law judges need no longer be appointed from the Serjeants-at-Law, removing the need to appoint judicial Serjeants. With this Act {{and the rise of}} the Queen's Counsel, there was no longer <b>any</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> appoint Serjeants, and the practice ended.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the other}} major {{problems}} noted in the report was the availability of parking at stations along the line.

That was {{in addition to the}} construction of a further 240 car parking bays at Whitfords Station, costing $780,000 in 2000, on the southern side of the station. Construction of a multi-story parking structure at Warwick was not considered as an option due to a number of social and environmental concerns.|$|E
25|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} the discontinuation of PSP, the Chinese electronics company Lenkeng released a PSP to HDMI converter called the LKV-8000. The device {{is compatible with the}} PSP-2000, PSP-3000 and PSP GO, but the AV cable packaged with it requires an adapter to plug into the PSP GO's port. Instead of component RCA plugs, the PSP's YPbPr AV signal is carried through a D-sub 9 cable that screws into the converter box, which then converts the signal from analog to digital and upscales it to 720p through HDMI. Lenkeng also released a variant of the LKV-8000 with a button allowing the user to toggle between 720p and 1080p. To overcome the problems of PSP games being displayed in a small window surrounded by a black boarder, the LKV-8000 featured a Zoom button on the connector itself. This allowed players to fill screen natively, without <b>any</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> use the television's zoom function. A few other Chinese companies have also released clones of this upscaler under different names, like the Pyle PSPHD42. The LKV-8000 and its variants have become popular among players and reviewers as the only means of playing and recording PSP gameplay in full screen.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, the Chu {{confederation}} nominally submitted {{once again}} to the Zhou kings after its victory, with its rulers refraining from using royal titles. As Chu had firmly established its autonomy and control over the middle Yangtze region, {{there was no longer}} <b>any</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> openly defy the Zhou monarchs. Following his father's death, King Mu led a punitive campaign against the confederation to force it back into full submission, but was unsuccessful. Chu remained unchallenged and virtually independent. Possibly to check the confederation's expansion, the Zhou dynasty moved its vassal state of E into the Nanyang Basin, north of Chu. Until the rule of King Li of Zhou, E was possibly the most powerful state of the middle Yangtze region, and ensured Zhou's security in the south. E revolted in 850 BC, however, and was destroyed by Zhou, allowing it to be absorbed by Chu which consequently grew even more powerful. After one last war with Zhou in 823 BC, the state of Chu fully seceded from the Zhou kingdom. After 703 BC, the Chu rulers finally declared themselves kings and equals to the Zhou rulers.|$|E
25|$|Early English {{common law}} had, in many instances, imposed {{liability}} {{on those who}} had caused harm regardless of wrongful intent or negligence. Trespass was considered a remedy for all tortious wrongs, and sometimes used as a synonym for torts generally. Over the centuries, however, judges focused more on the intent and negligence behind the actions than {{the nature of the}} actions themselves, leading to the development of negligence and nuisance and the further development of trespass. At the time of Rylands, the previous case relied upon was Vaughan v Menlove, decided in the Court of Common Pleas in 1837. The case had almost identical facts to Rylands, but strict liability was never even considered. The case is instead thought of {{as one of the best}} attempts of early 19th Century English judges to build up the law of negligence. The outcome of Rylands meant that judges would again impose strict liability on defendants who accumulated dangerous things on their land without <b>any</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> prove negligence or wrongful intent. The decision won support for bringing the law relating to private reservoirs up to standard with the law relating to public reservoirs, which contained similar statutory provisions thanks to a pair of private Acts of Parliament passed in 1853 and 1864.|$|E
25|$|Fergus and Mandy try to {{reassemble}} {{the broken}} {{pieces of the}} mirror. Fergus has {{the idea that if}} they put the pieces together on their side the mirror will repair itself on the other side. It works. While in the Hall of Mirrors, a kind woman appears to Daniel and Constance. She tells Constance she was right to steal the crown as the heir is dead. She also reveals that the crown can make a difference to the future. Meanwhile, in 1867 Gervais strikes gold, meaning he no longer has <b>any</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> sell the crown. The mirror appears and Constance goes through. Upon her return, Constance discovers that her father has entrusted the crown to her to do as she sees fit, but before she can arrange this with her friends in the 1990s, the mirror vanishes, signifying the end of their adventures. Back in 1997, Daniel, Fergus and Mandy visit Constance's grave and discover a clue to the location of the crown. Someone arrives and gives them a letter from Constance. The letter states that they are the new proprietors of the Crown Foundation. Now that their adventures had come to an end, Daniel decides to go back home and stay with this mum.|$|E

500|$|The {{situation}} drastically {{changed in}} 1916 when the Russian government ordered the Armenian volunteer units to be demobilized and prohibited any Armenian civic activity.

Richard Hovannisian wrote that because the [...] "Russian armies were in firm control of most of the Armenian plateau by the summer of 1916, there was no longer <b>any</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> expend niceties upon the Armenians". According to Tsatur Aghayan, Russia used the Armenian volunteers for its own interests. Andranik and other Armenian volunteers, disappointed by the Russian policy, left the front in July 1916.|$|E

Rumors have existed since the 1930s that Hepburn may have been a lesbian or bisexual, which she often joked about. In 2007, William J.

500|$|As {{early as}} 1946, missile {{conversion}} projects for Kentucky and the incomplete large cruiser [...] were discussed. In the early 1950s, the advances in guided missile technology {{led to a}} proposal to create a large warship armed with both guns and missiles. To this end, the incomplete Kentucky was chosen for conversion from an all gun ship into a [...] "guided missile battleship". This proposal would have been relatively conservative, and would have involved the installation {{of a pair of}} twin arm launchers for the RIM-2 Terrier surface-to-air missile (SAM) on the aft deckhouse, with a pair of antennas for the associated AN/APG-55 pulse doppler interception radar installed forward of these, and the AN/SPS-2B air search radar on a short mast. Since the battleship was already approximately 73% complete (construction had been halted at the main deck), installation of the missile system and associated electronics would have involved only adding the necessary equipment without <b>any</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> rebuild the ship to accommodate the system. Some guided missile concepts included one or two launchers for eight Regulus II or SSM-N-2 Triton nuclear cruise missiles. The guided missile battleship project was authorized in 1954, and Kentucky was renumbered from BB-66 to BBG-1, with the conversion due to be complete in 1956. However, the project was soon cancelled, with the conversion ideas transferred to a smaller platform that led to the [...] guided missile cruiser. [...] These partial conversions of two [...] heavy cruisers proved only partially successful in their new role, as the pace of change in cruise missile technology rendered their new weapons systems obsolete, while their remaining heavy guns proved in demand.|$|E
500|$|McCann {{notes that}} Grant {{typically}} played [...] "wealthy privileged characters who {{never seemed to}} have <b>any</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> work {{in order to maintain}} their glamorous and hedonistic lifestyle. He became a star whose characters were good looking, quick witted, funny and athletic, a star whose characters seemed to win the hearts of women without even trying". Martin Stirling, commenting in the biography Cary Grant: In Name Only, thought that Grant had an acting range which was [...] "greater than any of his contemporaries, but understood why a number of critics underrated him as an actor. He believes that Grant was always at his [...] "physical and verbal best in situations that bordered on farce". Charles Champlin, commenting in Donald Deschner's The Complete Films of Cary Grant (1973) similarly identifies a paradox in Grant's screen persona, in his unusual ability to [...] "mix polish and pratfalls in successive scenes". He remarks that Grant was [...] "refreshingly able to play the near-fool, the fey idiot, without compromising his masculinity or surrendering to camp for its own sake. His ability to play off against his own image as the strong and handsome romantic hero-figure is, as a matter of fact, probably unique among superstars. Nobody else comes even close to mind who could similarly toy with his own dignity without losing it". Wansell further notes that Grant could, [...] "with the arch of an eyebrow or the merest hint of a smile, question his own image", managing to [...] "blend irony and romance in a way that few other stars have ever done, by slyly never appearing to take himself too seriously, and mixing his own unique mixture of naïveté and worldliness". Stanley Donen, a director who had worked with Grant, stated that his real [...] "magic" [...] came from his attention to minute details and always seeming real, which came from [...] "enormous amounts of work" [...] rather than being God-given. Grant remarked of his career: [...] "I guess to a certain extent I did eventually become the characters I was playing. I played at being someone I wanted to be until I became that person, Or he became me". He would later profess that the real Cary Grant was more like his scruffy, unshaven fisherman in Father Goose than the [...] "well-tailored charmer" [...] of Charade.|$|E

500|$|Some of the show's {{plots and}} ideas {{are drawn from}} the lives of both creators' daughters; the {{decision}} to have Ron eventually join his school's football team was inspired by Schooley's daughter being involved in her high school band, which resulted in them attending several school football matches. Citing Ron as his favorite character, McCorkle admitted that he reminds him {{of his high school}} self. Although not as strong an action hero as Kim, {{at the same time the}} creators were careful to highlight Ron's courage and attributes by emphasizing the fact that he constantly finds himself in dangerous situations. By the fourth and final season, the writers had taken into consideration male fans' requests to see Ron succeed more often than he had in earlier seasons, developing him into a more confident character as he gradually [...] "come into his own" [...] and becomes more of a partner than a sidekick. Drakken and Shego's relationship [...] "weirdly" [...] mirrors Kim and Ron's to some extent, with the female character remaining smarter and more competent than her fumbling male teammate. Initially envisioned as a [...] "standard sidekick", Sullivan's sarcastic interpretation of Shego ultimately inspired Schooley and McCorkle to expand upon the humor revolving around the fact that Shego is barely able to tolerate Drakken. The creators had always intended for Kim and Ron to eventually become romantically involved but avoided this storyline in fear of [...] "paint ourselves in a corner", citing Sam and Diane's ill-fated relationship in the sitcom Cheers as an example. Throughout the first three seasons, the idea of Ron having feelings for Kim is alluded to, but he never pursues them for various reasons. Production on new episodes of Kim Possible had virtually ceased by the end of Season 3 when Kim and Ron finally become a couple, which McCorkle felt had ended the series perfectly in the film , thus initially eliminating <b>any</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> determine how they were to proceed with them as a new couple. However, when the series was surprisingly renewed for a fourth season, Schooley and McCorkle were forced to confronted the challenge of writing for Kim and Ron as a couple for the first time but eventually grew to appreciate their [...] "new dynamic", which provided the show with [...] "new life" [...] while allowing the writers to explore previously uncharted comedic territory. In fact, fans' interest in the new power couple's relationship was one of the main reasons the show was renewed.
