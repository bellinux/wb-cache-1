30|$|The most studied inhibitors are <b>aliphatic</b> <b>carboxylic</b> <b>acids,</b> phenols, and furan {{aldehydes}} (Jönsson et al. 2013). <b>Aliphatic</b> <b>carboxylic</b> <b>acids,</b> such as acetic acids, formic acid, and levulinic acid, are carbohydrate degradation products.

30|$|Since the <b>aliphatic</b> <b>carboxylic</b> <b>acids</b> {{are formed}} in {{considerable}} amounts in the pulping industry, their partial recovery has gradually become an interesting alternative to {{using them as}} fuel [11].

50|$|In the Shiina {{esterification}} performed under basic conditions, {{asymmetric synthesis}} is realized using chiral nucleophilic catalysts. First, {{in the presence}} of a chiral nucleophilic catalyst, by the action of an appropriate carboxylic acid anhydride on a racemic <b>aliphatic</b> <b>carboxylic</b> <b>acid,</b> the corresponding MA is produced, resulting in the kinetic resolution of the racemic <b>aliphatic</b> <b>carboxylic</b> <b>acid</b> after having been subjected to reaction with achiral alcohol. Using this method, optically active carboxylic acids and optically active carboxylic acid esters can be obtained. It is also possible to realize the kinetic resolution of racemic alcohols by modifying the compositions of the reactants, i.e., by forming MA through reactions between achiral carboxylic acid and the appropriate carboxylic acid anhydride; then, by activating the racemic alcohols using the MA, optically active alcohols and optically active carboxylic acid esters can be obtained.|$|E

Results: In this paper, lauric (C 12 : 0) and oleic (C 18 : 1) acids as well as a mixture of tall oil fatty acids were esterified with α-glucoisosaccharino- 1, 4 -lactone in a microwave-assisted batch reactor using a respective molar ratio of 3 : 1 in the presence of p-toluenesulfonic acid as a catalyst to obtain a mixture of the corresponding mono- and diesters (nonionic surfactants) at 70 – 100 °C for 6 – 24 h. The total yields varied in the range of 40 – 62 % and the mass ratio of monoesters to diesters (0. 4 – 2. 7) was greatly dependent on the fatty acid feedstock.
