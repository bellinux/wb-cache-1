The interviews began as casual conversations with her friends, who then brought up anecdotes they themselves had been told by other friends; this began a continuing chain of referrals.

[...] "Women's empowerment is deeply connected to their sexuality." [...] She also stated, [...] "I'm obsessed with women being violated and raped, and with incest. <b>All</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> deeply connected to our vaginas." ...|$|E

50|$|Although it {{may seem}} that people living with brain damage have great {{difficulty}} continuing the usual day-to-day aspects, they still can accomplish many feats.

KC also is fully capable of scripted activities (e.g., making reservations or changing a flat tire).In addition, patient HC successfully graduated high school and continued into post-secondary studies, an obvious accomplishment despite her condition. DH relearned his childhood memories from his parents and can retell the stories, but cannot recall specifics other than what has been told to him.|$|E

Thats what you hear the end of the song. I just thought that they were the appropriate people. It is far and away my favourite Monkees song.|$|E
