This formulation uses the axisymmetric convected Green's function independent of the flow direction arising from the adjunct operator by the Prandtl-Glauert transformation and uses two new operators, one concerning the particular normal derivative and the other concerning the convected normal derivative.

40|$|The past {{environment}} is often reconstructed by measuring certain proxy data, such as changes in oxygen isotopes, taxonomic assemblages, and taphonomic signatures in a palaeoenvironmental archive (e. g., rhodoliths, corals, invertebrate shells, trees, ice cores, speleothems, etc.). Proxy analysis usually yields {{a record that}} has to be compared with present day analogues in order toto yield meaningful results. This also holds true for the interpretation of the palaeoenvironment of rhodolith deposits. The characteristics of Recent rhodoliths and the environments in which they are formed, thus, need to be known in order toto interpret their fossil counterparts. The comparison of fossil and Recent rhodoliths and their {{environment is}}, however, not straightforward, because the respective <b>analytical</b> <b>methods</b> <b>applied</b> to them are usually different and often difficult to reconcile. In order toTo reduce the uncertainties of this problem and to facilitate direct comparisons, we describe a number of <b>analytical</b> <b>methods</b> <b>applied</b> to fossil rhodoliths that can also be performed on Recent material. The analytical methods introduced here correspond to three different scales of analysis: (1) the outcrop scale as completed in field studies, and the study of (2) isolated specimens and (3) thin sections in the laboratory...|$|E

However, DMPS was not effective in simulated continuous frying.

40|$|Abstract—We {{introduce}} a network visualization technique that supports an <b>analytical</b> <b>method</b> <b>applied</b> {{in the social}} sciences. Policy network analysis is an approach to study policy making structures, processes, and outcomes, thereby concentrating on relations between policy actors. An important operational concept {{for the analysis of}} policy networks is the notion of centrality, i. e., the distinction of actors according to their importance in a relational structure. We integrate this measure in a layout model for networks by mapping structural to geometric centrality. Thus, centrality values and network data can be presented simultaneously and explored interactively.

40|$|I {{develop and}} test {{a new theory}} of {{corporate}} political strategy and behavior based upon ownership structure. I posit that firms with a principal owner structure will differ from firms with an independent management structure. To test this hypothesis, I analyze contributions to political parties, politicians, and political organizations. I find that principal owner firms are able to resolve collective action problems within the firm and innovate the most rapidly in response to campaign finance legislation. In addition, I find that ownership structure predicts which firms exhibit strong partisan preferences relative to their industry. Furthermore, ownership structure explains why some firms innovate in response to legal and political change, {{and are more likely}} to engage in philanthropic, partisan and ideological activities. These findings challenge much of the conventional wisdom regarding the political behavior of firms. <b>Analytical</b> <b>methods</b> <b>applied</b> in my research include causal modeling, pattern matching, econometrics, and case studies...|$|E
30|$|The {{chemical}} structure of triterpenoids of Ganoderma lucidum comprised mainly of ganodermic acid and its alcohol moieties and aldehydes (Sanodiya et al. 2009), among others. Conventional <b>analytical</b> <b>methods</b> <b>applied</b> to characterize these triterpenoids {{involves the use}} of liquid chromatography such as reverse-phased high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to separate the complex mixtures and identify them based on their absorbance at 235 nm, 243 nm and 251 nm in methanol using ultra-violet (UV) detector (Chyr and Shiao 1991; Shiao et al. 1989). Post column UV detection at 243 nm was then applied to quantify the triterpenoids. HPLC analysis therefore involves the administration of a series of indirect and irreversible destructive protocols. Common to all industrial food processes, the ability to obtain real-time information via an integrated and non destructive quality control system is an attractive option financially, since process delinquencies due to poor materials control may now be greatly reduced via an intermediate quality assessment step implemented at the raw materials level.|$|E

To obtain advance hetero-modulus and hetero-viscous complex {{materials}} with extreme high dynamic strength, wear and thermal shock resistances {{a novel approach}} was applied by the authors.

The method is demonstrated in several case studies for process characterization and failure analysis of thin film technology based Solar cells, including Silicon (CSG), Cadmium Telluride (CdTe) and Copper Indium Selenide (CIS) absorbers. While existing techniques such as electro-, photoluminescence spectroscopy and lock-in thermography are able to locate the larger, electrically active defects reasonably fast on a large area, the FIB-SEM EBIC system is uniquely capable of detecting sub-micron, sub-surface defects and of analysing these defects in the same system.

We therefore visualize the network in a layered fashion, mapping status scores to vertical coordinates.

40|$|Chondritic meteorites are {{of great}} {{interest}} since {{they are one of}} the most ancient remnants of the early solar system. Some of them, like the carbonaceous CM meteorites experienced aqueous alteration thus their olivine content transformed more or less into hydrated silicates such as phyllosilicates. These hydrated CM 2 meteorites have been investigated in KBr pellets by means of Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. In our focus of interest was to study the 3 and 10 μm (3000 and 1000 cm^- 1, the O-H and silicate streching) bands of several CM 2 chondrites. By investigating these signals the water content and the extent of hydration can be determined. In order to achieve this, development of a new pellet production method was essential. This technique facilitates the elimination of adsorbed water coming from the surrounding environment, which would complicate correct interpretation of the results.

40|$|Physical effects {{degrading}} {{the quality}} of reconstructed medical images have been corrected during a while using <b>analytical</b> <b>methods,</b> <b>applied</b> to projections or directly to reconstructed images but those methods are still aproximative.
