Among the regenerable sorbents already developed for hot gas cleaning systems in Integrated Gasification Combined Cycles, metal oxide mixtures based on iron, titanium, or zinc oxides (zinc ferrites and zinc titanates) were tested for <b>arsenic</b> <b>and</b> selenium retention.

40|$|<b>Arsenic</b> <b>and</b> {{selenium}} <b>compounds</b> may be emitted to {{the environment}} during coal conversion processes, although some compounds are retained in the fly ashes, in different proportions depending {{on the characteristics of}} the ashes and process conditions. The possibility of optimizing the conditions to achieve better trace element retention appears to be an attractive, economical option for reducing toxic emissions. This approach requires a good knowledge of fly ash characteristics and a thorough understanding of the capture mechanism involved in the retention. In this work the ability of two fly ashes, one produced in pulverized coal combustion and the other in fluidized bed combustion, to retain <b>arsenic</b> <b>and</b> selenium <b>compounds</b> from the gas phase in coal combustion and coal gasification atmospheres was investigated.

40|$|Information on the {{physical}} and chemical properties of <b>arsenic</b> <b>and</b> <b>arsenic</b> <b>compounds</b> can be found in Table 1. 1, for further details please refer to IARC (1980). The list is not exhaustive, nor does it comprise necessarily the most commercially important arsenic-containing substances; rather, it indicates the range of arsenic compounds available. 1. 2 Chemical and physical properties of the agents Arsenic (atomic number, 33; relative atomic mass, 74. 92) has chemical and physical properties intermediate between a metal and a nonmetal, and {{is often referred to as}} a metalloid or semi-metal. It belongs to Group VA of the Periodic Table, and can exist in four oxidation states: – 3, 0, + 3, and + 5. Arsenite, As III, and arsenate, As V, are the predominant oxidation states under, respectively, reducing and oxygenated conditions (WHO, 2001; IARC, 2004). From a biological and toxicological perspective, there are three major groups of arsenic compounds:-inorganic arsenic compounds,-organic arsenic compounds, and-arsine gas. Of the inorganic arsenic compounds, arsenic trioxide, sodium arsenite <b>and</b> <b>arsenic</b> trichloride are the most common trivalent <b>compounds,</b> <b>and</b> <b>arsenic</b> pentoxide, <b>arsenic</b> acid <b>and</b> arsenates (e. g. lead arsenate and calcium arsenate) are the most common pentavalent compounds.

We also showed that carcinogenic nickel, chromium, <b>and</b> <b>arsenic</b> <b>compounds</b> <b>and</b> N-methyl-N-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) induced stable anchorage independence (Al) in diploid human fibroblasts (DHF) but no focus formation or immortality. Nickel subsulfide and lead chromate induced Al but not mutation to 6 -thioguanine resistance. The mechanism of induction of Al by metal salts in DHF was likely not by the type of base substitution or frameshift mutations measured in these assays. MNNG induced Al, mutation to 6 -thioguanine resistance, and mutation to ouabain resistance, and might induce Al by base substitution or frameshift mutations. Dexamethasone, aspirin, and salicylic acid inhibited nickel subsulfide, MNNG, and 12 -O-tetrade-canoylphorbol- 13 -acetate (TPA) -induced Al in DHF, suggesting that arachidonic acid metabolism and oxygen radical generation play a role in induction of Al.
