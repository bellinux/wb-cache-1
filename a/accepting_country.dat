50|$|Migrants or ‘non-resident nationals’ can {{be defined}} as migrants/expatriates, working or {{residing}} in abroad may have other country’s citizenship or different forms of permanent resident status. Those people can be treated as non-resident nationals or migrants for their home country or the country where they born having home country’s language as mother tongue. Sponsorship may be extended up to the first generation of migrant subject to satisfy few more conditions imposed by the home country’s discretion. Since receiving second country’s citizenship, the term is better to defined as ‘migrants’ or ‘non-resident nationals’ rather than non-resident citizen. Hence, the idea <b>accepting</b> <b>country</b> may redefine its own migrant’s sponsorship; however, the basic concept is to bring sponsor money from working and earning abroad.|$|E
5000|$|Not {{making much}} headway in Nashville, Yoakam moved to Los Angeles and worked towards {{bringing}} his particular brand of new Honky Tonk or [...] "Hillbilly" [...] music (as he called it) {{forward into the}} 1980s. Writing all his own songs, and continuing to perform mostly outside traditional country music channels, he did many shows in rock and punk rock clubs around Los Angeles, playing with roots rock or punk rock acts like The Blasters (Yoakam scored a small video hit with his version of their song [...] "Long White Cadillac"), Los Lobos, and X. This helped him diversify his audience beyond the typical country music fans, and his authentic, groundbreaking music is often credited with rock audiences <b>accepting</b> <b>country</b> music.|$|E

40|$|The {{subject of}} the {{research}} is the analysis of migration processes in the Barents Euro-Arctic region (BEAR). The main focus is the balance of interests between ethnic immigrants and citizens of the <b>accepting</b> <b>country</b> as well as formation and dynamics of ethno-social structure. The research of the migration problems is done through socio-cultural focus. It implies that a research of nation’s constant norms, values and traditions creates a scientific basis for creation of poly-cultural society and it’s stable structure. The {{novelty of the work}} is the regional aspect. The transformational trends of modern society and specifics of the BEAR are taken into account and studied on the example of the Murmansk region which is characterized as a region of heavy migration. The study describes migration processes intertwined with the realities of the multi-cultural society in BEAR (with the example of Murmansk region). The factors of upkeep of ba-lanced inter-ethnic relationship and formation of poly-cultural society are highlighted. The role of each ethnic group and national diasporas within ethno-social processes is highlighted.   Authors suggest that the success of socio-cultural adaptation of immigrants is not only due to knowledge of language and culture of the accepting society, but also is due to traditions and trends of poly-culture of the accepting nation. The results of the study may be used for managing solutions in stabilizing of ethno-cultural processes within BEAR but also {{within the framework of the}} study courses, such as «Ethno-sociology» or «Sociology of migration». </p...|$|E
