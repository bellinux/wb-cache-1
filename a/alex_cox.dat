5|$|<b>Alex</b> <b>Cox</b> {{had tried}} to make a Mars Attacks film in the 1980s before Burton and Gems began {{development}} in 1993. When Gems turned in his first draft in 1994, Warner Bros. commissioned rewrites from Gems, Burton, Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski in an attempt to lower the budget to $60 million. The final production budget came to $80 million, while Warner Bros. spent another $20 million on the Mars Attacks! marketing campaign. Filming took place from February to November 1996. The film was shot in California, Nevada, Kansas, Arizona and Argentina. The soundtrack became famous for the Martians' quirky speech pattern, which was created by reversing the sound of a duck's quack.|$|E
5|$|A film {{based on}} the Marvel Comics {{character}} Doctor Strange was initially listed as being in development at New World Pictures, with a script dated January 21, 1986 by Bob Gale. For unknown reasons, Gale's film never went further into production. By 1989, <b>Alex</b> <b>Cox</b> had co-written a script with Doctor Strange co-creator Stan Lee. The script had the character traveling to the Fourth Dimension before facing the villain Dormammu on Easter Island, Chile. A film using this script was almost made by Regency, but the company's films were distributed by Warner Bros. at the time, which was in a dispute with Marvel over merchandising. By December 1992, Wes Craven had signed to write and direct Doctor Strange for release in either 1994 or 1995, with Savoy Pictures distributing. In 1995, David S. Goyer had completed a script for the film. By April 1997, Columbia Pictures had purchased the film rights and Jeff Welch {{was working on a}} new screenplay, with Bernie Brillstein and Brad Grey producing.|$|E
5|$|The {{daughter}} of Hank Harrison and psychotherapist Linda Carroll, Love had an itinerant early life. She spent her formative years in San Francisco and Portland, Oregon, {{where she was}} in a series of short-lived bands before being cast in two films by British director <b>Alex</b> <b>Cox.</b> After forming Hole in 1989, she received substantial attention from underground rock press for the group's debut album, produced by Kim Gordon. Hole's second release, Live Through This (1994), gave her high-profile renown with critical accolades and multi-platinum sales. In 1995, Love returned to acting, earning a Golden Globe Award nomination for her performance as Althea Leasure in Miloš Forman's The People vs. Larry Flynt (1996), which established her as a mainstream actress. The following year, she saw further mainstream success with the release of Hole's third album, Celebrity Skin (1998), which was nominated for multiple Grammy Awards.|$|E

25|$|Love {{had lived}} a nomadic life prior, {{immersing}} herself in numerous music scenes {{and living in}} various cities along the west coast. After unsuccessful attempts at forming bands in San Francisco (where she was briefly a member of Faith No More) and Portland, Love relocated to Los Angeles, where she found work as an actress in two <b>Alex</b> <b>Cox</b> films (Sid and Nancy and Straight to Hell). Erlandson was a California native {{and a graduate of}} Loyola Marymount University, and was working as a royalties manager for Capitol Records at the time he met Love.|$|E
25|$|Walker's {{campaign}} has inspired two films, {{both of which}} take considerable liberties with his story: Burn! (1969) directed by Gillo Pontecorvo, starring Marlon Brando, and Walker (1987) directed by <b>Alex</b> <b>Cox,</b> starring Ed Harris. Walker's name {{is used for the}} main character in Burn!, though the character is not meant to represent the historical William Walker and is portrayed as British. On the other hand, Alex Cox's Walker incorporates into its surrealist narrative many of the signposts of William Walker's life and exploits, including his original excursions into northern Mexico to his trial and acquittal on breaking the neutrality act to the triumph of his assault on Nicaragua and his execution.|$|E

500|$|The {{deaths of}} Silence, Pauline and the outlaws {{at the hands}} of Loco and his gang are a {{culmination}} of the subversive elements of The Great Silence and its anti-authoritarian stance. Killing sympathetic or leading characters was not a new tactic to Corbucci – the title character of his second Western, Minnesota Clay, was seemingly killed {{at the end of the}} film's American prints. However, the political context of the later film plays a major factor in the presentation of its thematic concerns. <b>Alex</b> <b>Cox</b> elaborates: ...|$|E
500|$|The 1979 {{court ruling}} had left many issues between Lydon and McLaren unresolved. Five years later, Lydon filed another action. Finally, on 16 January 1986, Lydon, Jones, Cook and {{the estate of}} Sid Vicious were awarded control of the band's heritage, {{including}} the rights to The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle and all the footage shot for it—more than 250 hours. That same year, a fictionalised film account of Vicious's relationship with Spungen was released: Sid and Nancy, directed by <b>Alex</b> <b>Cox.</b> In his autobiography, Lydon lambastes the film, saying that it [...] "celebrates heroin addiction", goes {{out of its way}} to [...] "humiliate [...] life", and completely misrepresents the Sex Pistols' part in the London punk scene. Although he praised Gary Oldman's performance as Vicious, Lydon felt Oldman only captured [...] "the stage persona as opposed to the real person." ...|$|E
2500|$|More recent Acid Westerns include <b>Alex</b> <b>Cox's</b> film Walker (1987) and Jim Jarmusch's film Dead Man (1995). Rosenbaum {{describes}} the Acid Western as [...] "formulating a chilling, savage frontier poetry {{to justify its}} hallucinated agenda"; ultimately, he says, the Acid Western expresses a counterculture sensibility to critique and replace capitalism with alternative forms of exchange.|$|R
5000|$|Burning Sensations was a {{short-lived}} Los Angeles area rock band. The group {{is best known}} for its MTV hit [...] "Belly of the Whale", the music for which blends a rather unusual fusion of rock and calypso styles, and for covering the Jonathan Richman song [...] "Pablo Picasso", which was included in both the 1984 film and soundtrack of director <b>Alex</b> <b>Cox's</b> Repo Man starring Harry Dean Stanton and Emilio Estevez.|$|R

500|$|Fantoma Films and Image Entertainment {{released}} The Great Silence on DVD on September 4, 2001, {{with their}} release being the film's first {{appearance on the}} American market. The release used an English-language print that was digitally remastered by Zoetrope Aubry Productions, presented in [...] letterboxed widescreen, with the only audio option being a Dolby Digital Mono mix of the English dub. The DVD's special features consist of a video introduction to the film by <b>Alex</b> <b>Cox,</b> the alternative happy ending (with optional commentary by Cox), and the English version of the film's trailer. Fantoma reissued the disc on January 27, 2004. Glenn Erickson felt that the transfer on Fantoma's DVD was [...] "reasonable but not great" [...] due to the transfer having washed-out colours despite being clean from damage. Erickson also felt that the English dub [...] "still plays as artificial and false, and detracts mightily from Kinski's performance" [...] despite praising the voice acting itself.|$|E
500|$|Corbucci hired {{established}} German actor Klaus Kinski to play Loco, {{a character}} who was partially intended to emulate Gorca, the vampire played by Boris Karloff in Mario Bava's Black Sabbath, which served as a major stylistic influence on The Great Silence. Other cast members were established character actors in or outside the Spaghetti Western genre, including Luigi Pistilli, Mario Brega, Marisa Merlini, Raf Baldassare, Carlo D'Angelo, Spartaco Conversi and Bruno Corazzari (an actor often compared to Kinski). Frank Wolff, usually known for playing serious or villanous characters, was cast against type in the semi-comical role of Sheriff Burnett. [...] Vonetta McGee, a then-unknown pre-law San Francisco State College dropout and amateur actress who had moved to Rome to find work at Cinecittà, was cast as Pauline in her first film role. After appearing in Corbucci's film and Luigi Magni's Faustina, McGee was invited to return to America by Sidney Poitier, where she became a major actress in the blaxploitation genre. <b>Alex</b> <b>Cox</b> later cast her as Marlene in his film Repo Man based on her performance as Pauline.|$|E
500|$|Deciding {{to shift}} her focus to acting, Love {{enrolled}} at the San Francisco Art Institute and studied film with George Kuchar. Love featured {{in one of his}} short films, titled Club Vatican. In 1985 she submitted an audition tape for the role of Nancy Spungen in the Sid Vicious biopic Sid and Nancy (1986), and was given a minor supporting role by director <b>Alex</b> <b>Cox.</b> After filming Sid and Nancy in New York City, she worked at a peep show in Times Square and squatted at the ABC No Rio social center and Pyramid Club in the East Village. The same year, Cox cast her in a leading role in his film Straight to Hell (1987), a spaghetti western starring Joe Strummer and Grace Jones filmed in Spain in 1986. The film caught the attention of Andy Warhol, who featured Love in an episode of Andy Warhol's Fifteen Minutes with Robbie Nevil in a segment titled [...] "C'est la Vie". She also had a part in the 1988 Ramones music video for [...] "I Wanna Be Sedated", appearing as a bride among dozens of party guests.|$|E
50|$|Jones' punk-era reminiscences about {{close friend}} Sid Vicious {{formed the basis}} of {{director}} <b>Alex</b> <b>Cox's</b> screenplay Sid and Nancy and he has spoken about the friendship in several TV and radio documentaries. Jones worked for designer Vivienne Westwood in her shop Sex, was the Sex Pistols' DJ and appeared as a music executive in their film The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle, and today is regarded as something of an expert on all things Punk.|$|R
2500|$|In January 2015, it was {{announced}} that Pop contributed the theme song to <b>Alex</b> <b>Cox's</b> latest film, Bill, the Galactic Hero. He also collaborated with New Order on the song [...] "Stray Dog" [...] of their album Music Complete released in September of that year. Pop also collaborated with Tomoyasu Hotei on the songs [...] "How The Cookie Crumbles" [...] and [...] "Walking Through The Night" [...] from the album Strangers, also released that same year.|$|R
50|$|Middleton's plays were staged {{throughout}} the 20th century {{and into the}} 21st, each decade offering more productions than the last. Even some less familiar works of his have been staged: A Fair Quarrel at the National Theatre, and The Old Law by the Royal Shakespeare Company. The Changeling has been adapted for film several times, and the tragedy Women Beware Women remains a stage favourite. The Revenger's Tragedy was adapted into <b>Alex</b> <b>Cox's</b> film Revengers Tragedy, the opening credits of which attribute the play's authorship to Middleton.|$|R
500|$|Many {{directors}} have listed {{it as one}} of the greatest films ever made, including Woody Allen, Michael Apted, Les Blank, Kenneth Branagh, Paul Greengrass, Michel Hazanavicius, Michael Mann, Sam Mendes, Jiri Menzel, Paul Schrader, Martin Scorsese, Denys Arcand, Gillian Armstrong, John Boorman, Roger Corman, <b>Alex</b> <b>Cox,</b> Milos Forman, Norman Jewison, Richard Lester, Richard Linklater, Paul Mazursky, Ronald Neame, Sydney Pollack and Stanley Kubrick. Yasujirō Ozu said it was his favorite non-Japanese film and was impressed by its techniques. François Truffaut said that the film [...] "has inspired more vocations to cinema throughout the world than any other" [...] and recognized its influence in The Barefoot Contessa, Les Mauvaises Rencontres, Lola Montès, and 8 1/2. Truffaut's Day for Night pays tribute to the film in a dream sequence depicting a childhood memory of the character played by Truffaut stealing publicity photos from the film. Numerous film {{directors have}} cited the film as influential on their own films, including Theo Angelopoulos, Luc Besson, the Coen brothers, Francis Ford Coppola, Brian De Palma, John Frankenheimer, Stephen Frears, Sergio Leone, Michael Mann, Ridley Scott, Martin Scorsese, Bryan Singer and Steven Spielberg. Ingmar Bergman disliked the film and called it [...] "a total bore. Above all, the performances are worthless. The amount of respect that movie has is absolutely unbelievable!" ...|$|E
500|$|In his {{analysis}} of the Spaghetti Western genre, <b>Alex</b> <b>Cox</b> described The Great Silence as Corbucci's [...] "tightest, most relentless Western; his best and his bleakest. It's shot in his trademark messy, over-edited, jerky-zoom style, and its telephoto close-ups are frequently out of focus. Yet it is incredibly beautiful". He voiced praise for Ippoliti's strategy of [...] "shooting through things" [...] (a marked improvement over his work on Navajo Joe), the tight script, the strong female characters and the tragic nature of the ending, rooted in Corbucci's pessimism towards the deaths of radical political leaders. Performance-wise, he described Sheriff Burnett and Regina, the film's equivalent of the [...] "cute/funny" [...] characters that had appeared in Corbucci's earlier Westerns, as [...] "tolerable" [...] due to their senses of dark humour and morality, and praised McGee, Pistilli and Brega's acting. Cox also felt that Kinski's Loco was the actor's finest appearance in a Western, and that Trintignant's performance, which might have seemed doll-like in the hands of actors such as Franco Nero, John Phillip Law and Terence Hill, was pulled off [...] "flawlessly. His character's moral quandary, and decision to sacrifice himself, are perfectly conveyed". Noting that Corbucci seemed proud of The Great Silence – [...] "a great work, a great Spaghetti Western, a great Western, a classic of transgressive cinema" [...] – [...] Cox believes that Zanuck's withholding of the international release and its poor domestic performance were key factors in the decline in quality of Corbucci's output following its release.|$|E
