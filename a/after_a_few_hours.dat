Ammonia is not stable in the Martian atmosphere and breaks down <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hours.</b> One possible source is volcanic activity.|$|E
5|$|After the French Revolution, she {{was renamed}} Vengeur du Peuple and {{took part in}} the Glorious First of June. There, she was {{disabled}} after a furious duel with HMS Brunswick and surrendered after losing hope of being rescued by a French ship. <b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hours,</b> as British ships were beginning rescue operations, she listed and foundered, taking almost half her crew with her.|$|E
5|$|In April 1940, Germany invaded Denmark and Norway {{to protect}} {{shipments}} of iron ore from Sweden, which the Allies {{were attempting to}} cut off by unilaterally mining neutral Norwegian waters. Denmark capitulated <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hours,</b> and despite Allied support, during which the important harbour of Narvik temporarily was recaptured from the Germans, Norway was conquered within two months. British discontent over the Norwegian campaign led to {{the replacement of the}} British Prime Minister, Neville Chamberlain, with Winston Churchill on 10 May 1940.|$|E

5|$|When in England, Manley Power and {{his family}} lived in Hill Court Manor, Walford, near Ross-on-Wye, Herefordshire. Based on Burke's records, he was likely Lord of the Manor of Walford, Ross, Ross Foreign, Aston Ingham, and Wilton.

5|$|A {{technique}} called radioembolization {{is used to}} treat hepatocellular carcinoma and liver metastasis. Radioembolization is a low toxicity, targeted liver cancer therapy that uses millions of tiny beads made of glass or resin containing radioactive yttrium-90. The radioactive microspheres are delivered directly to the blood vessels feeding specific liver tumors/segments or lobes. It is minimally invasive and patients can usually be discharged <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hours.</b> This procedure may not eliminate all tumors throughout the entire liver, but works on one segment or one lobe {{at a time and}} may require multiple procedures.|$|E
5|$|Peggy convinces Al to sue {{the motel}} with her and the Rhoades. Steve, not wanting a lawyer to take any of the million dollars he expects to win from the case, decides to act as one for the two families. The case begins with Steve {{presenting}} a lengthy opening statement, during which the stenographer and the judge fall asleep. Next, Steve shows the subpoenaed sex tapes from the motel, despite objections from his wife. <b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hours,</b> the tape runs out and the courtroom applauds Steve and Marcy's romp. Next, Steve shows Peggy and Al's tape, which ends after a few seconds.|$|E
50|$|PLAXIS is {{program that}} has been {{developed}} specifically {{for the analysis of}} deformation, stability and flow in geotechnical engineering.

5000|$|Whether or not {{tax fraud}} {{rose to the}} level of [...] "high crimes and misdemeanors," [...] or whether a convicted felon could be allowed to remain on the federal bench, were not {{questions}} discussed at great length. <b>After</b> only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hours</b> of debate, the House Judiciary Committee reported the articles of impeachment.|$|R
25|$|In the Jura wine region, the Arbois AOC makes very pale, pink red wines {{that are}} often mistaken for rosés from Pinot noir and the local Poulsard and Trousseau {{varieties}}. But the region also makes even paler actual rosés from the same grape varieties that are pressed <b>after</b> only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hours</b> of skin contact.|$|R
5|$|Meanwhile, {{the others}} {{arrive at the}} cabin for the hunting trip. Leslie (Amy Poehler) proves to be an {{excellent}} hunter and bags the first quail. Growing increasingly agitated, Ron agrees to a challenge that Leslie cannot shoot more birds than he can, and they split up. <b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hours</b> of hunting, Ron screams and the others rush to his side and find he has {{been shot in the}} head. Ann, a nurse, takes Ron back to the cabin, where he is absolutely furious even though the injury is not serious. Ron asks whether Leslie shot him, but she insists she did not. Ron takes several pain pills and washes it down with scotch, which forces Ann and Leslie to hold his mouth open and induce vomiting, despite fierce opposition from Ron himself.|$|E
5|$|Powers {{helped the}} police perform a sting operation, telling Seymour {{that the police}} knew what had {{happened}} and {{that the only way to}} save Williams was to dig up the gun and move it to somewhere more safe. When Seymour and Powers went to do this, several policemen (who had been lying in wait) immediately arrested her and Powers (who was released a few hours later). Seymour was in a poor condition both physically and mentally, and <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hours</b> she wrote and signed a statement which incriminated Williams. Powers again helped the police, convincing Williams to meet him at Moorgate station, where Williams was arrested by the police and charged with the murder of Arthur Walls. Williams maintained that he was innocent of the murder and burglary.|$|E
5|$|The reactor was {{powered up}} successfully, but <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hours</b> the power level dropped and the reactor shut down. Leona speculated that a water leak was the problem, {{rather than a}} {{radioactive}} poison. However, during the night the operators were able to power the reactor up again only to have it once more die away. The timings now pointed to a radioactive poison. After working through the numbers with slide rules and hand calculators, they determined the Neutron {{cross section of the}} poison, {{which turned out to be}} xenon-135. Fortunately, the DuPont engineers had equipped the reactor with 50 per cent more fuel tubes that the physicists had called for, and by loading them up, they managed to get the reactor started.|$|E
5000|$|Braid died on 25 March 1860, in Manchester, <b>after</b> just <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hours</b> of illness.

He was survived by his wife, his son James (a general practitioner, rather than a surgeon), and his daughter.|$|R
50|$|On 5 September, the Soviet 24th and 66th Armies {{organized}} a massive attack against XIV Panzer Corps. The Luftwaffe helped repulse the offensive by heavily attacking Soviet artillery positions and defensive lines. The Soviets {{were forced to}} withdraw at midday <b>after</b> only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hours.</b> Of the 120 tanks the Soviets had committed, 30 were lost to air attack.|$|R
25|$|Hilbert et al. {{showed that}} {{major changes in}} {{polypeptide}} synthesis occurred <b>after</b> only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hours</b> of colonization by the fungus. Seven of the aforementioned ectomycorrhizins were detected, {{as well as a}} polypeptide cleansing event as several plant and fungal polypeptides underwent a sharp decrease. Comparative analyses of the mRNAs from both free-living mycelium and the EcM mycobionts showed many changes in gene expression, including SRAP32.|$|R
5|$|Atmospheric {{conditions}} remained {{only marginally}} conducive {{for the development}} of thunderstorms on the morning of December30. Throughout the day, moisture was drawn from the Gulf of Mexico northward into the Ozarks region. However, the presence of a capping inversion prevented thunderstorms from developing. During the evening of December30, an area of strong wind shear developed near the Ark-La-Tex and southeastern Oklahoma area well ahead of a nearing cold front, providing a focal point for potential storm development. Late that day, scattered thunderstorms developed over eastern Oklahoma and northern Arkansas, producing significant hail. Over the next few hours and into December31, these storms would intensify as they moved into southwestern Missouri, producing four tornadoes. The first tornado watch issued in association with the severe event was issued at 07:06UTC on December31 as these storms tracked across the Ozarks. <b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hours,</b> these supercell thunderstorms lessened in strength as they neared the Greater St. Louis metropolitan area.|$|E
5|$|The {{scenes in}} which Cole {{appeared}} on the ship were done by using a harness {{as if she was}} flying. Because the actress wore green dress and makeup, the normal greenscreen was replaced by bluescreens in the studio. Cole felt it was fun to fly on the harness, but found it painful <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hours.</b> Gillan was allowed to perform several of her own stunts in the episode. She was excited to learn that her character would fight pirates with swords, and was taught how to handle one with basic moves. Gillan was also allowed to swing across the ship. However, a stunt double was required to film the sequence where Amy is thrown across the deck by the Siren. The sickbay set was also built in a studio. Because the beds were attached to strings, they were prone to swaying. The cast members who were asked to lie on the beds were instructed to stay still and not breathe heavily to limit movement.|$|E
25|$|New {{fluorescent}} lamps may show a twisting spiral {{pattern of light}} {{in a part of}} the lamp. This effect is due to loose cathode material and usually disappears <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hours</b> of operation.|$|E
50|$|The Hangul {{alphabet}} {{was completed}} in 1443 and published in 1446 along with a 33-page manual titled Hunmin Jeong-um, explaining what the letters are {{as well as the}} philosophical theories and motives behind them. The Hunmin Jeong-um purported that anyone could learn Hangul in a matter of days. Persons previously unfamiliar with Hangul can typically pronounce Korean script accurately <b>after</b> only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hours</b> of study.|$|R
60|$|Bathurst {{stopped for}} a day at Patna to see Rujub and his daughter. He was {{received}} as an expected guest, and <b>after</b> spending <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hours</b> with them he continued his journey. At Calcutta he found a letter awaiting him from Isobel, saying that she had arrived safely in England, and should stay with her mother until his arrival, and there he found her.|$|R
50|$|CR.42AS: A close air-support version. The two {{standard}} 12.7 mm {{machine guns}} could be supplemented with two more. There were underwing racks for two 220 lb (100 kg) bombs. AS stands for 'Africa Settentrionale.' There was an additional engine filter to prevent damage from sand which caused {{a loss in}} power, a common occurrence in North Africa, since filter-less engines could be damaged <b>after</b> only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hours</b> use.|$|R
25|$|At {{the time}} of her birth, her parents were unable to pay the fees of Dr. Gadre, who had {{delivered}} her, so her father left her at a Muslim orphanage. However, he picked her up <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hours.</b>|$|E

25|$|The villagers {{approached}} the fort with Scutd-doo, however {{he ran away}} from the group as they got near the fort. The army, unconvinced by this apparent escape, demanded his wife and sub-chief be turned over as hostages. <b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hours</b> Scutd-doo surrendered to the army.|$|E
50|$|The {{inflorescence}} comprises around 12 flowers, 8 - 12 mm in diameter. Each flower {{has five}} uneven sepals and five yellow petals usually {{with a dark}} red spot near the base. The flowers are cleistogamous, producing little pollen and no nectar, and attracting few insect visitors, and the petals fall off <b>after</b> only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hours.</b> The centre of the flower houses around 20 stamens and a single capitate stigma.|$|R
50|$|The Ming forces {{gradually}} retreated north while {{fighting off}} several waves of attacks. Li Rusong {{and many other}} generals personally fought in the brawl, and they sustained heavy casualties before they met up {{with the rest of}} their army toward the later portion of the day. The Japanese pursued the defeated Ming army back up the pass to its highest point, and <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> more <b>hours</b> of fighting.|$|R
5000|$|Appetite {{is another}} {{sensation}} experienced with eating; {{it is the}} desire to eat food. There are several theories about how the feeling of hunger arises. A healthy, well-nourished individual can survive for weeks without food intake, with claims ranging from three to ten weeks. [...] The sensation of hunger typically manifests <b>after</b> only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hours</b> without eating and is {{generally considered to be}} unpleasant. Satiety occurs between 5 and 20 minutes after eating.|$|R
25|$|Duc de la Vauguyon had {{captured}} and ransomed a lobster smack sailing from Norway to Britain. The {{master of the}} smack informed Montague that the privateer had had a consort. Medeas rigging was too cut up for her to pursue the consort, so Montague sent Piercy after her.

25|$|Soon de Leyva {{realized}} {{the attack was}} producing far more harm to his galleys and frigates and hardly any on the English. Even de Leyva's flag galley had sustained heavy damage and soon it warped from the fight, and <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hours</b> more fighting {{the rest of the}} Spanish ships had repeated the same feat. Most of them had sustained some form of damage and some were fighting to stay afloat, while the English edging away from the coast still in convoy formation, headed West.|$|E
