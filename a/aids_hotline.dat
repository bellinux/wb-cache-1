40|$|The {{health crisis}} which {{in recent years}} has {{depleted}} the ranks of the art community, has not received much formal notice in art education journals. A continuing stigma remains attached to AIDS due to its appearance among gay men and IV drug users. Many people pretend it is not there. My own life has become consumed by it, due to the illness of many, many friends and associates. For nearly two years, because of the enormity of the crisis combined with relatively little action on state and federal levels and the mounting grief and loss in my own life, I began to feel that art education is a silly field contributing very little to society in general and contributing nothing to end this awful disease. I decided, despite my advanced age and status at the university, to work on a nursing degree and leave teaching, finger paint and clay to other people. In nursing, I found an advancing technological approach to treating human organisms, not human beings. Wanting to work with people, I switched to social work. In the meantime, I have been volunteering on the National <b>AIDS</b> <b>Hotline,</b> handing diverse: crisis calls ranging from suicide threats to education about the virus and its effects. I have also volunteered to spend time with the dying at the Brownlie Hospice, in a move to do something else very concrete. I may still complete mv MSW degree to work with PWAs (People with AIDS) as a professional social worker. Curiously, however, this mid-life career crisis hits led to a re-evaluation of the importance of art and art education in the lives of every person I know including myself. As with the dying themselves, there seems little time for game playing and intellectual gymnastics. Our human limitations, our financial constraints and the unrelenting, destructive, lethal character of this particular virus, form a metaphor drawing attention to why we do what we do and why it matters...|$|E
40|$|America Responds to AIDS was {{launched}} in 1987 to raise awareness about HIV/AIDS among all Americans. It was created {{in response to a}} 1985 Congres- sional mandate that required the CDC to educate the public about HIV/AIDS. The campaign was developed by Ogilvy and rolled out in the following phases from 1987 through 1996 : 2 ̆ 022 The National AIDS Mailing to all U. S. households in 1988 provided facts about HIV/AIDS transmission and prevention. 2 ̆ 022 In 1989 a campaign was targeted to minorities, sexually active young adults, and injection drug users 2 ̆ 014 all at greatest risk of HIV infection. 2 ̆ 022 Adult influencers, especially parents talking to their children about AIDS, were the focus of the 1990 phase of the campaign. 2 ̆ 022 Voluntary testing and treatment for HIV infection was addressed in 1992. 2 ̆ 022 HIV risk-reduction behaviors, including abstinence and condom use, were highlighted in 1994. 2 ̆ 022 Targeted PSAs to audiences disproportionately affected 2 ̆ 014 African Americans and Latinos 2 ̆ 014 were conducted in 1995 and 1996. Print and broadcast public service announcements (PSAs) profiling 2 ̆ 01 creal people 2 ̆ 01 d affected by HIV/AIDS were produced and marketed to mass media, generating more than 320 million of public service airtime in the first 5 years. The campaign promoted the newly created CDC <b>AIDS</b> <b>Hotline,</b> where callers could talk with counselors and receive free information in the mail. The federal government spent 7. 36 million developing the first five phases, including 3. 46 million for production, 2. 06 million for marketing and distribution, and 1. 84 million for development. Between the campaign 2 ̆ 019 s launch in October 1987 and January 1992 the PSAs aired more than 59, 000 times, with a commercial airtime value of 67. 8 million.
