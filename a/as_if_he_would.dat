25|$|On August 7, 1872, Hardin {{was wounded}} by a shotgun blast in a {{gambling}} dispute at the Gates Saloon in Trinity, Texas. He {{was shot by}} Phil Sublett, who had lost money {{to him in a}} poker game. Two buckshot pellets penetrated Hardin's kidney and for a time it looked <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> die.|$|E
25|$|In 1971, Amon, now {{driving for}} the Matra factory team, once again scored a {{pre-season}} victory, {{this time at}} the Argentine Grand Prix. Once the Formula One season had begun, he managed to convert a third-place start at the Spanish GP into a third-place podium finish and scored a couple of fifth places in the South African and French GPs. Apart from these results, however, his run of poor F1 returns continued. He had a major accident at the Nürburgring and it sidelined him for the next race at the Österreichring. At the Italian GP he qualified in pole position and despite a poor start to the race looked <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> capitalise on it – until the visor on his helmet became detached. Amon had to slow to avoid risking a major accident, thereby allowing other drivers to catch and overtake him. He finished the race in sixth place, scoring just one Championship point.|$|E
25|$|On Lee’s {{transfer}} to Richmond, he detailed urgent defense construction, {{then he called}} on Lawton’s “earnest and close attention” to the Federal’s probable approach to the city. “It looks now <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> take the Savannah River”. Guns located in island batteries were to be removed to the mainland in and around Savannah’s defensive lines. Obstructions in the river above the city were to be set by hands provided by upriver planters {{in the event of}} an envelopment by way of Fort McAllister. “Every effort must be made” to retard or prevent further progress of the enemy directly upriver on the Savannah River approaches. “If he attempts to advance by batteries on the marshes or islands, he must be driven back, if possible.” Scouts were ordered out “so as to discover his first lodgment, when they can be broken up.” An additional three-gun battery at MacKay’s Point was not intended to stop federal gunboats in force, but with Tattnall’s gunboat support, they could prevent Federal batteries from being built on Elba Island to threaten Old Fort Jackson.|$|E

50|$|Cornfeld then {{heard that}} Cronenberg {{was no longer}} {{associated}} with Total Recall and once again approached him with The Fly. Cronenberg agreed to sign on <b>as</b> director <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> be allowed to rewrite the script.|$|R

2500|$|The author {{goes on to}} {{say that}} Ajaan Sao would only give specific, {{practical}} instruction and would refrain from expounding sophisticated dharma topics: [...] "This is one instance of how Phra Ajaan Sao taught his pupils — teaching just a little at a time, giving only the very heart of the practice, almost <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> say, [...] "Do this, and this, and this," [...] with no explanations at all." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 822, when {{soldiers}} at Xuanwu Circuit (宣武, headquartered in modern Kaifeng, Henan) rebelled against and expelled the military governor Li Yuan (李愿) {{under the leadership}} of Li Jie (李㝏), Shi supported Li Jie's request to be made military governor, and further postured by placing his troops at Liyang (黎陽, in modern Hebi, Henan) <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> cross the Yellow River to aid Li Jie. [...] However, after Li Jie's rebellion was subsequently crushed by an imperial campaign, Shi changed his attitude and said to the imperial official sent to confer with him, Wei Wenke (韋文恪): ...|$|E
2500|$|We see Darwin {{portrayed as}} a monkey with his own human head. He holds a mirror up to another monkey which is sitting next to him. It seems <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> invite the monkey to ponder over himself and his existence. This is {{underlined}} by the two accompanying quotations of Shakespeare: [...] "This is the ape of form" [...] (from: Love's Labour's Lost, act 5, scene 2) and [...] "Some four or five descents since" [...] (All's Well that Ends Well, act 3, scene 7). Darwin's facial expression seems to encourage the monkey to recognise their common ancestry. The ape, in turn, looks into the mirror and tries to touch the reflection to literally grasp Darwin's suggestion and to assure himself of the authenticity of their kinship.|$|E
60|$|Sergeant Corney {{strapped}} {{his rifle}} on his back, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> believing <b>he</b> <b>would</b> have {{no use for}} it; but he made certain his knife was loose in its sheath, and I understood {{that if we had}} trouble it would be at close quarters.|$|R
60|$|She {{made him}} stop {{to look at}} the graves. Suddenly, as they stood, she kissed him, clasped him fervently, roused him till his passion burned away his heaviness, and he seemed tipped with life, his face glowing <b>as</b> <b>if</b> soon <b>he</b> <b>would</b> burst alight. Then she was satisfied, and could laugh.|$|R

2500|$|In 826, Emperor Jingzong {{was assassinated}} by his polo player Su Zuoming (蘇佐明). [...] The eunuch Liu Keming (劉克明) {{supported}} Emperor Muzong's younger brother Li Wu the Prince of Jiàng, {{and at one}} point, Li Wu was meeting with the officials and acting <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> be the next emperor. [...] However, Wang and other powerful eunuchs, including Yang Chenghe (楊承和), Wei Congjian (魏從簡), and Liang Shouqian, soon mobilized their troops and attacked Liu's party. [...] Liu committed suicide, while Li Wu was killed. [...] They supported Emperor Jingzong's younger brother Li Han the Prince of Jiāng (note different tone), who {{changed his name to}} Li Ang, as emperor (as Emperor Wenzong). [...] It was Wang who consulted with the imperial scholar Wei Chuhou to deal with the ceremony of Emperor Wenzong's enthronement after the coup.|$|E
2500|$|In 2013 at Daytona, Harvick dodged a {{practice}} wreck {{in the last}} session of practice, and {{the same in the}} Sprint Unlimited. Later, he would go on and tie Tony Stewart's and Dale Jarrett's record for wins in the Sprint Unlimited. In his victory burnout moments after he won his car shut down and Harvick said, [...] "I don't care!" [...] 2013 was his last season with RCR, and he said, [...] "I'm gonna finish better than I started!" [...] He also won his Budweiser Duel, and though it seemed <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> be the first driver to sweep the Sprint Cup events at Speedweeks, he was caught up in a crash on lap 35 of the Daytona 500 and finished 41st. Harvick won his first race of the season at the 2013 Toyota Owners 400, which ended Kyle Busch's four-year winning streak in the spring Richmond race.|$|E
2500|$|By {{the late}} Middle Ages {{the search for}} natural causes had come to typify the work of Christian natural philosophers. Although {{characteristically}} leaving {{the door open for}} the possibility of direct divine intervention, they frequently expressed contempt for contemporaries who invoked miracles rather than searching for natural explanations. The University of Paris cleric Jean Buridan (a. 1295-ca. 1358), described as [...] "perhaps the most brilliant arts master of the Middle Ages," [...] contrasted the philosopher's search for [...] "appropriate natural causes" [...] with the common folk's habit of attributing unusual astronomical phenomena to the supernatural. In the fourteenth century the natural philosopher Nicole Oresme (ca. 1320–82), who {{went on to become a}} Roman Catholic bishop, admonished that, in discussing various marvels of nature, [...] "there is no reason to take recourse to the heavens, the last refuge of the weak, or demons, or to our glorious God <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>He</b> <b>would</b> produce these effects directly, more so than those effects whose causes we believe are well known to us." ...|$|E
60|$|I was mystified by Pierre's words, {{although}} surely by {{this time}} I should {{have come to understand}} that his odd speech betokened the perfecting of a plan, and I remained silent <b>as</b> <b>if</b> believing <b>he</b> <b>would</b> make sport of me, until two or three minutes had elapsed when Abel Hunt could no longer be seen in the gloom.|$|R

2500|$|Ensign's {{first race}} of the season was the South African GP where Amon {{qualified}} 18th and showed a revival of form, climbing to an astonishing 7th place, in the old [...] Ensign N174 and contesting 6th with Mario Andretti in the Parnelli Ford, in the last laps before a last minute refueling stop left him 14th. Thereafter results began to improve, with Amon qualifying 17th and finishing 8th in the USA West GP; qualifying 10th and finishing fifth in the Spanish GP; and then qualifying eighth for the Belgian GP. More points then seemed likely from the race until his car lost a wheel 19 laps from the finish and Amon was lucky to escape unhurt from the ensuing accident. He then achieved an incredible 3rd grid position start for the Swedish GP using a Nicholson rebuilt Cosworth {{for the first time}} and in the race looked <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> join Tyrrell drivers Jody Scheckter and Patrick Depailler on the podium, until suspension failure threw him from the track after 38 laps.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the midway}} {{point of the}} 90th PGA Championship, the only golfer under par was J. B. Holmes. Holmes, whose best finish at a major was a tie for 25th at the Masters earlier in 2008, shot a two-under 68 to post a -1 after 36 holes. He was {{as many as three}} shots under par for the tournament, but bogeyed two of his final four holes. Ben Curtis and Justin Rose shared the best round of the day with three-under 67s to settle into a tie for second at even par with Charlie Wi. After {{withdrawing}} from the Open Championship, 2001 PGA Championship winner, David Toms, regained his form by shooting a one-under 69 to put himself in a tie for fifth with Henrik Stenson. Sergio García shot a three-over 73 to place himself in a seven way tie for seventh. García appeared <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> be higher on the leaderboard {{at the close of the}} day, but he double-bogeyed the 17th hole. Phil Mickelson bogeyed two of his final four holes to finish in a seven way tie for 14th going into the weekend.|$|E
