Eventually she became just <b>as</b> <b>busy</b> <b>as</b> queen mother as she had been as queen consort. In July 1953, she undertook her first overseas visit since the funeral when she visited the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland with Princess Margaret. She laid the foundation stone of the University College of Rhodesia and Nyasaland – the current University of Zimbabwe.|$|E
5|$|On October 25, 1788 Jones' team {{began their}} survey of Grimsby Township; it was {{completed}} November 13, 1788. Saltfleet Township was surveyed from November 14, 1788 to December 25, 1788 and Binbrook Township was surveyed from December 24, 1788 until February 12, 1789. All of these townships were surveyed using the Front and Rear system, except Binbrook, which was surveyed with the Single Front system. During this time, Frey had assigned two other surveyors to lead surveys in the Nassau district. Daniel Hazen and Jesse Pawling both led teams, but neither group was <b>as</b> <b>busy</b> <b>as</b> Jones' group. Hazen's group surveyed only four townships, and incompletely, and Pawling's three, also incompletely. In November 1789 Jones began {{acting as the}} deputy surveyor in Nassau District as Frey had left Upper Canada, and he officially received the position in early 1791 {{on the order of}} Deputy Surveyor General John Collins.|$|E
25|$|The Grand Union Canal was nationalised in 1948, control {{transferring}} to the British Transport Commission, and in 1962 to the British Waterways Board, later British Waterways. Commercial traffic continued to decline, effectively ceasing in the 1970s, though lime juice was carried from Brentford to Boxmoor until 1981, and aggregates on the River Soar until 1996. However, leisure traffic took over, and the canal is now <b>as</b> <b>busy</b> <b>as</b> it ever was, with leisure boating complemented by fishing, towpath walking and gongoozling. More recently freight traffic has {{returned with the}} carriage of aggregates from Denham to West Drayton in barges and narrow boats, {{and the opening of}} a new wharf for re-cyclables and aggregates at Old Oak Common.|$|E

500|$|The {{new owners}} of RKO made an initial effort {{to revive the}} studio, hiring veteran {{producer}} William Dozier to head production. A needed cash infusion was realized in 1954 when the 89 acre RKO Encino movie ranch was sold off {{to make way for}} a new tract home development. [...] During the first half of 1956, the production facilities were <b>as</b> <b>busy</b> <b>as</b> they had been in a half-decade. RKO Teleradio Pictures released Fritz Lang's final two American films, While the City Sleeps and Beyond a Reasonable Doubt (both 1956), but years of mismanagement had driven away many directors, producers, and stars. Other films included Bundle of Joy, a remake of the Ginger Rogers-starring Bachelor Mother which was re-tooled as a vehicle for star couple Eddie Fisher and Debbie Reynolds. Rogers herself would make a film for the new RKO (The First Traveling Saleslady) and would later comment that [...] "coming back to RKO was like coming back to a picnic you've been on last week, and pick up the bones all around and see what the ants have taken from the lunch that you left." [...] The studio was also saddled with the last of the inflated B movies such as Pearl of the South Pacific (1955) and The Conqueror (1956) that enchanted Hughes. The latter, starring John Wayne, was the biggest hit produced at the studio during the decade, but its $4.5 million in North American rentals did not come close to covering its $6 million cost.|$|E

Large crowds were expected to view the refloating. The ship was also expected to bring extra visitors to Blackpool over the Easter weekend. The Tourist Information Centre at Cleveleys reported a large increase in enquiries in the weeks after Riverdance grounded. Local residents complained that the influx of visitors [...] "made their lives hell", raising parking, traffic and litter issues. By early April, the number of visitors had begun to drop.|$|E

2500|$|<b>As</b> <b>busy</b> <b>as</b> he {{was during}} the 1950s and early 1960s, there were still many film {{projects}} that Buñuel had to abandon {{due to lack of}} financing or studio support, including a cherished plan to film Mexican novelist Juan Rulfo's Pedro Páramo, of which he said how much he enjoyed [...] "the crossing from the mysterious to the real, almost without transition. [...] I really like this mixture of reality and fantasy, [...] but I don't know how to bring it to the screen." [...] Other unrealized projects during his lifetime included adaptations of André Gide's Les caves du Vatican; Benito Pérez Galdós's Fortunata y Jacinta, Doña Perfecta, and Ángel Guerra; Evelyn Waugh's The Loved One; William Golding's Lord of the Flies; Dalton Trumbo's Johnny Got His Gun; J. K. Huysmans' Là-Bas; Matthew Lewis's The Monk; José Donoso's Lugar sin límites; a film of four stories based on Carlos Fuentes's Aura; and Julio Cortázar's Las ménades. Some of these adaptations were later used by following directors.|$|E
2500|$|The {{managers}} were very {{busy with the}} details of production, but they were <b>as</b> <b>busy</b> <b>as</b> actors. [...] Wilks acted one hundred and forty performances in the 1721-2 season, for example, and Wilks rarely toured out of London (with {{the exception of a}} single trip to Dublin in 1711). [...] Wilks was one of the mainstays of Drury Lane, both as a manager and, even more, as an attractive male lead. [...] Colley Cibber, whose autobiography portrays himself as a voice of reason and calm, paints Wilks as a vain and tempestuous personality, and it is possible to believe Cibber's complaints about others without believing his praise of himself. [...] Alexander Pope satirized Wilks, along with Cibber and Doggett, in The Dunciad, both versions. [...] William Hogarth depicted Wilks as a man busy making a pantomime play of a jail break while using scripts for Hamlet as toilet paper. [...] The actor managers responded to the increasing move for [...] "spectacle" [...] plays (see Augustan drama for context) and quick productions with low costs, and thus the triumvirate, in particular, was frequently satirized for cheapening the stage.|$|E
