5|$|The duality {{represents}} a major advance {{in our understanding}} of string theory and quantum gravity. This is because it provides a non-perturbative formulation of string theory with certain boundary conditions <b>and</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> the most successful realization of the holographic principle, an idea in quantum gravity originally proposed by Gerard 't Hooft and promoted by Leonard Susskind.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the Scottish Terrier can make a good watchdog due to its tendency to bark only when necessary <b>and</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> typically reserved with strangers, although this is not always the case. They have been described as a fearless breed that may be aggressive around other dogs unless introduced at an early age. Scottish Terriers were originally bred to hunt and fight badgers. Therefore, the Scottie is prone to dig as well as chase small vermin, such as squirrels, rats, and mice.|$|E

5|$|Laevistrombus {{canarium}} (commonly {{known as}} the dog conch or by its better-known synonym, Strombus canarium) is a species of edible sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusc in the family Strombidae (true conches). Known from illustrations in books dating from the late 17th century, L.canarium is an Indo-Pacific species occurring from India and Sri Lanka to Melanesia, Australia and southern Japan. The shell of adult individuals is coloured from light yellowish-brown to golden to grey. It has a characteristic inflated body whorl, a flared, thick outer lip and a shallow stromboid notch. The shell is valued as an ornament, <b>and</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> heavy and compact it is also often used as a sinker for fishing nets.|$|E
5|$|Some {{noble gases}} have direct {{application}} in medicine. Helium is sometimes {{used to improve}} the ease of breathing of asthma sufferers. Xenon is used as an anesthetic because of its high solubility in lipids, which makes it more potent than the usual nitrous oxide, <b>and</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> readily eliminated from the body, resulting in faster recovery. Xenon finds application in medical imaging of the lungs through hyperpolarized MRI. Radon, which is highly radioactive and is only available in minute amounts, is used in radiotherapy.|$|E
5|$|Like {{many plants}} in {{south-west}} Western Australia, B.prionotes {{is adapted to}} {{an environment in which}} bushfire events are relatively frequent. Most Banksia species can be placed in one of two broad groups according to their response to fire: reseeders are killed by fire, but fire also triggers the release of their canopy seed bank, thus promoting recruitment of the next generation; resprouters survive fire, resprouting from a lignotuber or, more rarely, epicormic buds protected by thick bark. B.prionotes is unusual in that it does not fit neatly into either of these groups. It lacks a lignotuber or thick bark, and so cannot be considered a resprouter; yet it may survive or escape some fires because of its height, the sparseness of its foliage, and because it occurs in dune swales where fire are cooler and patchier. On the other hand, it is not a typical reseeder either, because of its relatively low fire mortality rates, <b>and</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> only weakly serotinous: although fire promotes seed release, seed release still occurs in the absence of fire.|$|E

25|$|Prior to the {{development}} of palladium-catalyzed cross coupling reactions, copper was the preferred catalyst for almost a century. Palladium offers a faster, more selective reaction.

25|$|The JPEG {{standard}} also allows, {{but does}} not require, decoders to {{support the use of}} arithmetic coding, which is mathematically superior to Huffman coding. However, this feature has rarely been used, as it was historically covered by patents requiring royalty-bearing licenses, <b>and</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> slower to encode and decode compared to Huffman coding. Arithmetic coding typically makes files about 5–7% smaller.|$|E

25|$|Natural gas {{could be}} {{considered}} the most environmentally friendly fossil fuel, because it has the lowest CO2 emissions per unit of energy <b>and</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> suitable for use in high efficiency combined cycle power stations.

25|$|The Holy Scripture is not {{identical}} with divine revelation, but {{a part of}} it. Scriptures were written later by apostles and evangelists, who knew Jesus.

25|$|In both {{segmentation}} and paging, certain {{protected mode}} registers specify to the CPU what memory address it should allow a running program to access. Attempts to access other addresses trigger an interrupt which cause the CPU to re-enter supervisor mode, placing the kernel in charge. This {{is called a}} segmentation violation or Seg-V for short, and since it is both difficult to assign a meaningful result to such an operation, <b>and</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> usually {{a sign of a}} misbehaving program, the kernel generally resorts to terminating the offending program, and reports the error.|$|E

25|$|When it {{was first}} discovered, the toxin was called the Very Fast Death Factor (VFDF) because when it was {{injected}} into the body cavity of mice it induced tremors, paralysis and death within a few minutes. In 1977, the structure of VFDF was determined as a secondary, bicyclic amine alkaloid, and it was renamed anatoxin-a. Structurally, it is similar to cocaine. There is continued interest in anatoxin-a because of the dangers it presents to recreational and drinking waters, <b>and</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> a particularly useful molecule for investigating acetylcholine receptors in the nervous system. The deadliness of the toxin means {{that it has a}} high military potential as a toxin weapon.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the ozone}} layer absorbs UVB {{ultraviolet}} light from the sun, ozone layer depletion increases surface UVB levels (all else equal), {{which could lead to}} damage, including increase in skin cancer. This was the reason for the Montreal Protocol. Although decreases in stratospheric ozone are well-tied to CFCs and to increases in surface UVB, there is no direct observational evidence linking ozone depletion to higher incidence of skin cancer and eye damage in human beings. This is partly because UVA, which has also been implicated in some forms of skin cancer, is not absorbed by ozone, <b>and</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> nearly impossible to control statistics for lifestyle changes over time.|$|E
25|$|Female {{choice is}} the final step in the males attempt to reproduce; if the female does not find the male’s traits desirable, {{reproduction}} will not be successful. As it is in most species, body size is an important and most common desired trait amongst females. Body size is indicative of fitness and/or genetic quality; <b>and</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> easily observable, {{it can be an}} indicator for how a female will pick her mate. A larger body size positively correlates to higher paternity; thus larger males are more successful in siring more offspring than smaller males. Male salamanders also prefer larger females because they produce more ova than smaller females.|$|E
