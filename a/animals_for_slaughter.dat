2500|$|Temple Grandin, {{who is both}} {{an animal}} welfare activist and the leading American {{designer}} of commercial slaughterhouses, has outlined techniques for humane ritual slaughter. She considers shackling and hoisting of <b>animals</b> <b>for</b> <b>slaughter</b> to be inhumane, and has developed alternative approaches usable in production plants. Grandin has coordinated this with the Committee on Jewish Law and Standards of the Conservative movement in the United States, and in 2000 the Committee voted to accept her approach, ruling that [...] "Now that kosher, humane slaughter using upright pens is both possible and widespread, we find shackling and hoisting to {{be a violation of}} Jewish laws forbidding cruelty to animals and requiring that we avoid unnecessary dangers to human life. As the CJLS, then, we rule that shackling and hoisting should be stopped." ...|$|E

50|$|Several equine and animal-welfare {{organizations}} oppose slaughter {{or support}} {{a ban on}} horse slaughter, but other animal organizations and animal-agriculture groups support the practice. According to livestock-slaughter expert Temple Grandin, horse slaughter can be humane with proper facility design and management. Included in animal-agriculture groups supporting horse slaughter are organizations representing the interests of traditional food-animal industries such as cattle, sheep and pigs, who are concerned that banning any <b>animal</b> <b>for</b> <b>slaughter</b> will lead to outlawing all meat production.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{statistics}} is to show changes in the size and value of total production of <b>animals</b> <b>for</b> <b>slaughtering</b> and meat analyzed by use. Due to the interest of breeders and specialists from our country in specialized breeds of cattle meat production is increasing, {{the purpose of this}} paper is to present the evolution of beef production over the last three years. The number of animals slaughtered decreased steadily from 2010 to 2012. Most slaughter, were done in the second half of the years in which research was made. The largest number of cattle were slaughtered in December 2010, and the fewest (with 62. 32 % less) in January 2012. Total slaughter is declining, but a higher number of animals are slaughtered in official slaughterhouses, at a higher weight. As a consequence, beef production is forecast to remain relatively stagnant. </p...|$|R

5000|$|Although the {{production}} of wool is spread across the islands, the breeding of <b>animals</b> <b>for</b> <b>slaughter</b> is concentrated on East Falkland where the EU accredited Send Bay abattoir is situated. An additional cost borne by producers on West Falklands is the fare charged for crossing the Falklands Sound.

40|$|The model de Leslie (matriciel model {{based on}} the {{monitoring}} of cohort) is the most model used for assessing the dynamic of population. Such model was used for assessing the population projection for the next 10 years {{based on the}} fixed in (birth and purchase) and out (mortality and culling) parameters {{as well as the}} reproduction items (fecundity, abortion rate). Different scenario based on this model can be tested and the effect of mortality rate improvement or increasing reproduction performances can be assessed on the population dynamic. Moreover, the economic values of the camel industry (selling milk and culled <b>animals</b> <b>for</b> <b>slaughtering)</b> can be assessed at the national level. For example by improving survival rate of 0 - 1 y calves from 84 to 90 %, the annual growth rate of the herd population will pass from 2. 53 to 2. 69 %. Many examples are given in the presentation.
