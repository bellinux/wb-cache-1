5|$|Judy Taylor, {{author of}} several books about Potter and her works, observes that Potter had {{difficulty}} drawing the human form, and, {{as a result of her}} limitations, restricted depictions of Mr. McGregor in The Flopsy Bunnies to his hands <b>and</b> <b>feet.</b> Any awkwardness in their depictions was minimized by presenting his hands <b>and</b> <b>feet</b> in isolation and from the bunnies' point of view. In the few full-length illustrations of Mr. McGregor, the need to depict his face was eliminated by presenting him in the middle or far distance and from the rear.|$|E

40|$|General EcologyThe {{purpose of}} this {{experiment}} {{was to determine the}} effects of rain <b>and</b> <b>foot</b> disturbances on the pit size and relocation preference of antlion larvae (Myrmeleon immaculatus). Antlions were placed in sand filled aquaria to build pits in a 24 -hour period and pit size and location (exposed or sheltered) was measured. Rain <b>and</b> <b>foot</b> traffic treatments were performed and relocation and pit size was measured after a 24 -hour period. The mean pit diameter of the antlions exposed to treatments of dry <b>and</b> <b>foot</b> traffic were significantly larger than the mean pit diameter of antlions with the rain treatment. The number of antlions that relocated to shelter after the no treatment <b>and</b> <b>foot</b> traffic treatment was not significantly greater than the number of antlions that relocated to shelter after the treatment of rain. There was a greater proportion that chose shelter as the number of trials increased for no treatment <b>and</b> <b>foot</b> traffic treatment. There were significantly more pits built in dry conditions than wet conditions. In conclusion, pit size was related to disturbances of rain <b>and</b> <b>foot,</b> <b>and</b> pit size was larger within the trails with out treatment <b>and</b> with <b>foot</b> traffic <b>and</b> rain disturbances...|$|R

5|$|Slow lorises have a {{powerful}} grasp with both their hands <b>and</b> <b>feet</b> due to several specializations. They can tightly grasp branches with little effort because of a special muscular arrangement in their hands <b>and</b> <b>feet,</b> where the thumb diverges at nearly 180° {{from the rest of}} the fingers, while the hallux (big toe) ranges between being perpendicular and pointing slightly backwards. The toes have a large flexor muscle that originates on the lower end of the thigh bone, which helps to impart a strong grasping ability to the hind limbs. The second digit of the hand is short compared to the other digits, while on the foot, the fourth toe is the longest. The sturdy thumb helps to act like a clamp when digits three, four, and five grasp the opposite side of a tree branch. This gives their hands <b>and</b> <b>feet</b> a pincer-like appearance. The strong grip can be held for hours without losing sensation due to the presence of a rete mirabile (network of capillaries), a trait shared among all lorises. Both slender and slow lorises have relatively short feet. Like nearly all lemuriforms, they have a grooming claw on the second toe of each foot.|$|E

40|$|Fear of falling, <b>foot</b> pain, {{impairment}} <b>and</b> disability {{are commonly}} reported in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, {{the relationship between}} fear of falling <b>and</b> <b>foot</b> pain, impairment <b>and</b> disability has not been investigated in established RA. The aim {{of the study was}} to evaluate the relationship between fear of falling <b>and</b> <b>foot</b> pain, walking velocity <b>and</b> <b>foot</b> impairment <b>and</b> disability in women with established RA. A secondary aim was to evaluate differences between fear of falling, foot pain, walking velocity <b>and</b> <b>foot</b> impairment <b>and</b> disability in women with established RA and age- and sex-matched control participants. Twenty-one women with established RA and twenty-one age- and sex-matched controls were assessed for fear of falling, foot pain, <b>foot</b> impairment <b>and</b> disability and walking velocity. Pearson’s r-correlations were used to examine relationships between fear of falling <b>and</b> the <b>foot</b> measures. Independent samples t tests evaluated the differences in fear of falling <b>and</b> <b>foot</b> measures between the two groups. In people with RA, significant correlations were found between fear of falling <b>and</b> <b>foot</b> impairment (r[*]=[*] 0. 53, p[*]=[*] 0. 015), foot disability (r[*]=[*] 0. 77, p < 0. 001) and walking velocity (r[*]=[*] 0. 56, p[*]<[*] 0. 001). No correlation was found between fear of falling <b>and</b> <b>foot</b> pain (r[*]=[*] 0. 36; p[*]=[*] 0. 11). Significant differences between cases and control participants were found between fear of falling (p[*]=[*] 0. 001), foot impairment (p[*]=[*] 0. 004) <b>and</b> <b>foot</b> disability (p[*]<[*] 0. 001). <b>Foot</b> impairment <b>and</b> disability relates to fear of falling in women with established RA. A better understanding of fear of falling in people with established RA may contribute to more efficient falls assessments in order to identify at risk individuals...|$|R

APG and blood pressure were measured at rest and 5 to 30 minutes after exercise at the supine position. Results: 1) APG index in foot was lower than fingertip both intensity. 2) There was significant increase of △APG index from rest in fingertip <b>and</b> <b>foot</b> after the intensity of 60 % HR max reserve. 3) No significant differences of △APG index between fingertip <b>and</b> <b>foot</b> was both the intensity of 30 0 x 0. 00000 b 6 bdb 55 bp- 1022 nd 60 % HR max reserve. 4) There were no significant relationship among △APG index, △heart rate and △pule pressure in fingertip <b>and</b> <b>foot</b> after both intensities.
