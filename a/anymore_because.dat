5|$|On the September 1 {{episode of}} SmackDown!, Kennedy {{defeated}} Finlay and Bobby Lashley in a Triple Threat {{match to win}} the WWE United States Championship, his first and only Championship reign in WWE. On the September 8 episode of SmackDown!, Kennedy announced {{that he wanted to}} move over to Raw, as SmackDown! did not interest him <b>anymore</b> <b>because</b> he had already defeated every top performer on the roster. This led to SmackDown! General Manager Theodore Long making a match between Kennedy and The Undertaker, who Kennedy had never faced, to be held at No Mercy. Kennedy won the match by disqualification. On the October 13 episode of SmackDown!, Kennedy, now with a win over The Undertaker, again stated his desire to move to the Raw brand. However, Long put him against an opponent who he had never faced—this time Chris Benoit—with Kennedy's title on the line. Long said that, if Kennedy were to defeat Benoit, he would be given his release and be allowed to go to Raw. Ultimately, Kennedy lost the match and the United States Championship to Benoit after submitting to the Crippler Crossface following a distraction by The Undertaker, which also marked Kennedy's first loss via submission.|$|E

One index of the changing situation is the rising curve of complaints from satellite photo-analysts that {{they are unable to}} get decent dry-season shots of the Amazon <b>anymore,</b> <b>because</b> of the great clouds of smoke and particulates hanging over large parts of the forest. The reasons for this pall are quite clear when one examines the numbers of fires and the consequent contributions of particulates and ‘greenhouse’ gases.|$|E
25|$|These models don’t use {{a spatial}} {{representation}} of the body <b>anymore,</b> <b>because</b> they derive the parameters directly from the images or videos using a template database. Some {{are based on the}} deformable 2D templates of the human parts of the body, particularly hands. Deformable templates are sets of points on the outline of an object, used as interpolation nodes for the object’s outline approximation. One of the simplest interpolation function is linear, which performs an average shape from point sets, point variability parameters and external deformators. These template-based models are mostly used for hand-tracking, but could also be of use for simple gesture classification.|$|E

25|$|The German word Gauliga is {{composed}} of Gau, approximately meaning county or region, and Liga, or league. The plural is Gauligen.

50|$|Some {{residents}} still {{refer to}} the area as Carmel Valley, which in fact, is north of Torrey Hills and is around the 56 freeway. Many do not call the area Carmel Valley <b>anymore,</b> however, <b>because</b> of confusion with Carmel Mountain, which {{is located on the}} east end of the 56 freeway near Rancho Peñasquitos, about 15 miles east.|$|R
25|$|Radium (usually in {{the form}} of radium {{chloride}} or radium bromide) was used in medicine to produce radon gas which in turn was used as a cancer treatment; for example, several of these radon sources were used in Canada in the 1920s and 1930s. However, many treatments that were used in the early 1900s are not used <b>anymore</b> <b>because</b> of the harmful effects radium bromide exposure caused. Some examples of these effects are anaemia, cancer, and genetic mutations. Safer gamma emitters such as 60Co, which is less costly and available in larger quantities, are usually used today to replace the historical use of radium in this application.|$|E
25|$|Americans {{initially}} {{believed that}} the proliferation of false parts mainly affected only smaller airlines; indeed, smaller airlines and repair stations were usually the businesses that were {{the most likely to}} be affected by fake parts. However, the FAA later found counterfeit parts in larger operations, including the discovery of counterfeit parts in aircraft of large, well-known airlines; even Air Force One, the aircraft used by the President of the United States, at one time contained fakes. As a result, illegal dealers and counterfeiters faced arrests, trials, and convictions. Schiavo stated that the among the most important actions taken by the United States government regarding the proliferation of counterfeit parts was the convictions of counterfeiters and illegal dealers. The FAA created a more rigorous documenting system to prevent the proliferation of fake aircraft parts and were eventually given the authority to press criminal charges on airlines who knowingly accept unapproved parts. In the 2000s, Schiavo said that aircraft parts are not counterfeited as often <b>anymore</b> <b>because</b> regulation of the spare parts industry has become much more strict than in the 1980s and the 1990s.|$|E

[...] In September, the New York Post published an article claiming that campaign donors were buying influence with Nixon by providing him with a secret cash fund for his personal expenses.

500|$|The Astonishing is Dream Theater's second concept album after 1999's [...] Described as an [...] "honest-to-God rock opera" [...] by Rolling Stone, it {{has been}} {{compared}} to The Who's Tommy (1969), Rush's 2112 (1976), Pink Floyd's The Wall (1979), and Queensrÿche's [...] (1988). 2112 also revolves around music being used to achieve freedom in a futuristic setting. The album's story was inspired by Petrucci's love of fantasy and science fiction franchises such as Game of Thrones, Lord of the Rings, and Star Wars, as well as his observations on the role of technology in modern-day society. In an interview with Billboard, he explained, “I was thinking of all of the things now that people used to do that they don’t do <b>anymore</b> <b>because</b> they’re automated or done by robots: lots of jobs, self-driving cars coming right around the corner ...

[...] Falle founded and became the director of Sex Trade 101, a Toronto-based nonprofit organization dedicated to protecting the rights of women who have been in prostitution. She founded Sex Trade 101 because she saw women in the sex industry as victims rather than as criminals, and she believed that the Criminal Code depicted them as criminals. She founded the organization {{in order to make it}} more widely known that the vast majority of women in the sex industry want to leave. She met many women who had no family to support them in exiting the sex industry, and she decided to found an organization to provide that support. The organization helps prostitution victims exit the sex industry and improve their lives.|$|E

The film was adapted into a serialized graphic novel written by Aronofsky and Ari Handel, published in French in October 2011 by the Belgian publisher Le Lombard. By July 2012, Aronofsky's crews were building an ark set in Oyster Bay, Long Island, New York. Aronofsky announced the start of filming on Noah on Twitter in the same month, tweeting shots of the filming in Iceland. The film featured Emma Watson, Anthony Hopkins, Logan Lerman, and Jennifer Connelly, with the latter having also starred in Requiem for a Dream. During its opening weekend, Noah held the largest non-sequel opening within Russia and Brazil, and the fourth-largest opening of all time. Aronofsky did not use live animals for the film, saying in a PETA video that [...] "There's really no reason to do it <b>anymore</b> <b>because</b> the technology has arrived".

500|$|Local and {{national}} Republican leaders encouraged Nixon to challenge incumbent Pat Brown for Governor of California in the 1962 election. Despite initial reluctance, Nixon entered the race. The campaign was clouded by public suspicion that Nixon viewed the {{office as a}} stepping-stone for another presidential run, some opposition from the far-right of the party, and his own {{lack of interest in}} being California's governor. Nixon hoped that a successful run would confirm him in his status as the nation's leading active Republican politician, and ensure he remained a major player in national politics. Instead, he lost to Brown by more than five percentage points, and the defeat was widely believed {{to be the end of}} his political career. In an impromptu concession speech the morning after the election, Nixon blamed the media for favoring his opponent, saying, [...] "You won't have Nixon to kick around <b>anymore</b> <b>because,</b> gentlemen, this is my last press conference". The California defeat was highlighted in the November 11, 1962, episode of ABC's [...] entitled [...] "The Political Obituary of Richard M. Nixon". Alger Hiss appeared on the program, and many members of the public complained that it was unseemly to allow a convicted felon air time to attack a former vice president. The furor drove Smith and his program from the air, and public sympathy for Nixon grew.|$|E

However, as soon as filming begins, he immediately asks about her rumoured promiscuity and involvement in the Smurf genocide. To Cartman's surprise, Wendy claims she indeed bulldozed Smurfland to get the valuable Smurfberries, but alludes that Cartman was involved with the plot, and that the Smurfs would have left Smurfland if Cartman had not integrated himself with them. She steps down as student body president, turning the title over to Cartman, and announces her own new book [...] on the Smurfs. Cartman is angry that she has turned the tables on him and stolen his Smurf idea, particularly when she announces she sold the movie rights to director James Cameron, who turned the book into his new film, Avatar. With being the student body president, Cartman can't do the morning announcements <b>anymore</b> <b>because</b> a student can't hold both positions at the same time. Cartman, much to his anger, also learns that being the student body president is a meaningless position with no real power. The episode ends with Casey Miller reading the announcements, which include a student's explicit letter of disgust for Cartman's performance as president, causing him to run out the room crying, [...] "I'm doing the best I can!" ...|$|E
500|$|Lansdale {{continued}} {{to be critical of}} Durbrow, and wanted to replace him as ambassador. Two months later, the incoming US President John F. Kennedy started a review of Washington's stance with regards to Saigon. Lansdale's report predicted South Vietnam's demise, and along with it, the rest of South East Asia and US preeminence in global affairs, unless a new direction was found. He blamed what he saw as Durbrow's poor judgement for the problems in the alliance, and that the current ambassador could not work effectively <b>anymore</b> <b>because</b> he had [...] "sympathized strongly" [...] with the coup. Without explicitly suggesting himself, Lansdale said that Durbrow had to be replaced with someone [...] "with marked leadership talents" [...] and the ability to [...] "influence Asians through understanding them sympathetically". Lansdale called Diệm [...] "the only Vietnamese with executive ability and the required determination to be an effective President" [...] and said the new ambassador needed thus needed to have a rapport with him. Lansdale said Diệm was comfortable with MAAG and the CIA, but felt that diplomats were [...] "very close to those who tried to kill him on November 11". During the meeting at which these matters were discussed, there was strong agreement that Durbrow's position in Saigon had become untenable. Lansdale's submissions were seen as being important in Kennedy's decision to replace Durbrow with Frederick Nolting in May 1961. Nolting was a mild man who was seen as unlikely to pressure Diệm to reform and therefore upset him. Kennedy was thought to have seriously contemplated the appointment of Lansdale, before encountering complaints from sections of the State and Defense Departments, among them Defense Secretary Robert McNamara. Kennedy also increased funding for Diệm immediately and made a show of support for the Vietnamese leader at the advice of Lansdale.|$|E
