5|$|Angered by the French surrender, <b>and</b> <b>unhappy</b> with British {{policies}} that affected them, an Ottawa chief named Pontiac organized 18 Native American tribes that attacked British {{military and civilian}} settlements beginning in April 1763. The tribes captured eight British forts and forced the evacuation of two more. General Amherst ordered the 17th to Albany in June 1763 to assist in combating the outbreak of hostilities.|$|E
5|$|From a {{conflicted}} <b>and</b> <b>unhappy</b> childhood, Parker rose to acclaim, {{both for}} her literary output in publications such as The New Yorker {{and as a}} founding member of the Algonquin Round Table. Following the breakup of the circle, Parker traveled to Hollywood to pursue screenwriting. Her successes there, including two Academy Award nominations, were curtailed when her involvement in left-wing politics led to a place on the Hollywood blacklist.|$|E
5|$|Sarumpaet, {{born into}} a {{politically}} active Christian family in North Sumatra, initially studied architecture in Jakarta. After seeing a play by Willibrordus S. Rendra in 1969, she dropped out and joined his troupe. Five years later, after marrying and converting to Islam, she founded the Satu Merah Panggung; the troupe did mostly adaptations of foreign dramas. As she became increasingly concerned about her marriage <b>and</b> <b>unhappy</b> about the local theatre scene, two years later Sarumpaet left her troupe and began to work in television; she only returned in 1989, after divorcing her abusive husband.|$|E

5|$|Staff {{available}} for employment include entertainers, security guards, mechanics, and handymen. Lack of staff can cause problems, including messy footpaths, rides breaking down, crime, <b>and</b> <b>unhappy</b> visitors. If visitors become unhappy, thugs {{may come to}} vandalise the park by committing offences such as popping balloons, stealing food, and beating up entertainers. Occasionally, wages {{and the price of}} goods must be negotiated; failure to reach an agreement results in staff strikes or loss of shipment.|$|E
5|$|String {{arrangements}} were added {{late in the}} recording process. Björk had friend Eumir Deodato conduct, transcribe and compose original pieces for the few songs that Björk did not arrange for herself. To keep with the Icelandic theme of the album, Björk ordered the services of the Icelandic String Octet. By June 1997, the album was behind schedule and Björk was uncertain of the final track listing <b>and</b> <b>unhappy</b> {{with some of the}} recorded vocals.|$|E
5|$|By early 1944 Treloar was overworked <b>and</b> <b>unhappy</b> {{to be in}} Melbourne {{instead of}} at the Memorial. He was also uncomfortable with {{the way in which}} Bean and the AWM's acting {{director}} Arthur Bazley were running the Memorial in his absence, and sought to intervene in its management. This degree of intervention frustrated Bazley, and led to increasing conflict between the two men who had worked together since 1917. Their relationship worsened in 1945, and the Memorial's board was eventually forced to make a ruling on what Bazley and Treloar's responsibilities were. In 1946, Bazley left the Memorial to take a job in the Department of Immigration due to continuing tensions with Treloar.|$|E

5|$|Pedro II's {{mother died}} when he was one year old, and his father remarried, to Amélie of Leuchtenberg, a couple years later. Pedro II formed a strong bond with Empress Amélie, whom he {{considered}} to be his mother throughout the remainder of his life. When Pedro I abdicated on 7 April 1831 and departed to Europe with Amélie, Pedro II was left behind with his sisters and became the second emperor of Brazil. He was raised with simplicity but received an exceptional education towards shaping what Brazilians then considered an ideal ruler. The sudden and traumatic loss of his parents, coupled with a lonely <b>and</b> <b>unhappy</b> upbringing, greatly affected Pedro II and shaped his character.|$|E
5|$|On 19 August, Göring {{read the}} {{reports on the}} losses of 18 August, <b>and</b> <b>unhappy</b> with {{the extent of the}} losses, {{recalled}} both pilots. Hitler's Directive 17 had ordered the Luftwaffe to achieve air superiority, but remain strong enough for when, or rather if, Sea Lion was launched. Moreover, Göring recognised that the Luftwaffe was his power base. A failure would be damaging, but a severe weakening of the Luftwaffe would be far worse. He emphasised to his commanders the need to preserve the Luftwaffe's strength. Essentially, the core theme of the conference was fighter protection. The fighter leaders advocated sweeps to clear the skies in advance of attacks. Other commanders present thought a combination of sweeps and close escort would be more effective in reducing losses. Göring agreed and listed a number of forms that the sweeps could take. The most important tactical change he made was instituting a wholesale purge of older Geschwaderkommodore in favour of younger men. From now on, leaders were to be drawn from the ranks, given responsibility based on skill and experience rather than rank, while allowing them to have a free rein in tactical engagements (a form of aerial Auftragstaktik).|$|E

25|$|The SCG {{has been}} both a happy <b>and</b> <b>unhappy</b> hunting ground for Australian rugby union. One of the worst {{incidents}} to occur there was the sad demise of Ken Catchpole's international career. Robbed of a glorious retirement, his career ended in a disgraceful scandal. Australia was playing the New Zealand All Blacks and while Catchpole was trapped {{on the bottom of}} a ruck New Zealander second rower, Colin Meads, tried to drag him out by one leg, splitting him like a wishbone. Australia, although well beaten on this occasion, was well served by international-standard halfbacks and 20-year-old John Hipwell ran on for his first test as Catchpole was carried off. It was a sad end to an illustrious career.|$|E

25|$|Disillusioned {{with the}} music {{business}}, despite all his success, <b>and</b> <b>unhappy</b> with the status quo, in 1991 Jon Bon Jovi fired his management, business advisers, and agents, including his long-time manager, Doc McGhee. Jon took on the quarterbacking responsibilities himself by closing ranks and creating Bon Jovi Management. In October 1991 the band went to a Caribbean island of St. Thomas to discuss plans for the future. They managed to resolve their differences by allowing each member to speak about his feelings without interruption from each other. Upon resolving their issues, they headed back into the Vancouver Little Mountain studios with Bob Rock {{to work on the}} band's fifth album in January 1992.|$|E
25|$|Indira Gandhi {{was born}} as Indira Priyadarshini Nehru in a Kashmiri Pandit family on 19 November 1917 in Allahabad. Her father, Jawaharlal Nehru, {{was a leading}} figure in India's {{political}} struggle for independence from British rule, {{and became the first}} Prime Minister of the Dominion (and later Republic) of India. She was the only child (a younger brother was born, but died young), and grew up with her mother, Kamala Nehru, at the Anand Bhavan; a large family estate in Allahabad. She had a lonely <b>and</b> <b>unhappy</b> childhood. Her father was often away, directing political activities or incarcerated, while her mother was frequently bed-ridden with illness, and later suffered an early death from tuberculosis. She had limited contact with her father, mostly through letters.|$|E
25|$|Philip {{married his}} cousin, Margaret of Austria, in 1599, {{a year after}} {{becoming}} king. Margaret, the sister of the future Emperor Ferdinand II, {{would be one of}} three women at Philip's court who would apply considerable influence over the king. Margaret was considered by contemporaries to be extremely pious – in some cases, excessively pious, and too influenced by the Church – 'astute and very skillful' in her political dealings, although 'melancholic' <b>and</b> <b>unhappy</b> over the influence of the Duke of Lerma over her husband at court. Margaret continued to fight an ongoing battle with Lerma for influence up until her death in 1611. Philip had an 'affectionate, close relationship' with Margaret, and paid her additional attention after she bore him a son in 1605.|$|E

When he was serving as the Prefect of the Masters of Writing, he evaluated his subordinates based on their performance and dismissed those who failed to live up to his expectations. Emperor Wu once told Xun Xu that he hoped that Xun Xu would learn from Xun Yu and Xun You by promoting deserving officials and dismissing corrupt officials. A few months after Xun Xu assumed his new appointment, his mother died so he resigned and wanted to go home for filial mourning. However, Emperor Wu denied him permission and sent Zhou Hui (周恢) to announce an imperial edict ordering him to return to his job.|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless, Jamphel Gyatso {{was also}} said to possess {{all the signs}} of being the true {{incarnation}} of the Seventh. This was also {{claimed to have been}} confirmed by many portents clear to the Tibetans and so, in 1762, at the age of 5, he was duly enthroned as the Eighth Dalai Lama at the Potala Palace. At the age of 23 he was persuaded to assume the throne as ruler of Tibet with a Regent to assist him and after three years of this, when the Regent went to Beijing as ambassador in 1784, he continued to rule solo for a further four years. Feeling unsuited to worldly affairs, however, <b>and</b> <b>unhappy</b> in this role, he then retired from public office to concentrate on religious activities for his remaining 16 years until his death in 1804. He is also credited with the construction of the Norbulingka 'Summer Palace' started by his predecessor in Lhasa and with ordaining some ten thousand monks in his efforts to foster monasticism.|$|E
25|$|Louis {{felt very}} ill before {{boarding}} the ship, {{waiting for his}} full recovery delayed their plans for weeks. Once at sea, it was Maria Luisa who fell ill. On 2 October 1802, before arriving at Barcelona, still in open waters, Maria Luisa under difficulties {{gave birth to her}} daughter Maria Luisa Carlota (named after Maria Luisa's older deceased sister). At first, doctors thought that both mother and daughter would not survive. The couple also found out that they arrived too late for the wedding. Maria Luisa, still very ill, waited three days on the ship to recover before she went ashore in Barcelona, where her parents were waiting for her. One week after they arrival they got news that Louis's father, Ferdinand, had died. Ill <b>and</b> <b>unhappy,</b> Louis wanted to return as soon as possible to his Italian states, but Charles IV and Maria Luisa insisted to take them to the court in Madrid.
