25|$|The {{programme}} has {{its roots}} firmly in the desire of Doctor Who producer John Nathan-Turner to get Elisabeth Sladen back into the TARDIS. He had wanted her to have the contract eventually awarded to Janet Fielding in late 1980. John Nathan-Turner's preferred plan for the transition from Baker to Davison was to have Sarah Jane be <b>along</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>ride</b> from Logopolis to the second story of series 19. However, Sladen {{had no interest in}} returning simply to reprise a role and function identical to the one she had left years before.|$|E

At the invitation of Bree, they stay at the apartment of Bree's father. Robbie, Sky and Raven come <b>along</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>ride.</b>|$|E

After being discovered by Lauren, he convinces her to join New Directions, despite her belief that show choir is stupid. Ashley Fink said of their relationship: [...] "I think Ryan Murphy has a master plan and we're all kind of <b>along</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>ride.</b> I know what you mean, but I wouldn't count us out just yet on that front. We all have to laugh at ourselves but it's going somewhere. Ultimately, {{it comes down to}} whether audiences will buy a relationship between Puck and Lauren. I think there's a really hilarious chemistry between Puck and Lauren. I think he's a badass, she's a badass. I don't know, I think they're funny together. There's something about {{the two of them together}} that I like, so I hope it's not outside the realm of possibility." ...|$|E

[...] Referring to the Observer September, Pinker added that the episode would also peel [...] "back some layers about what his agenda has been and use that as an opportunity to revisit the things on the show we’ve seen before." [...] Fellow executive producer J.H. Wyman elaborated [...] "We always said you would find out about the Observers this season {{and we were going to}} investigate them a lot more. We’re excited about it all. That’s a highlight– the Observers are a highlight. For us to constantly break what you know and reset and have people go, 'Wow, I didn’t see that coming!'

2500|$|Kobach {{is alleged}} to have {{scheduled}} negligible state business to coincide with Republican Party functions, taking his family along with him. The costliest trip taken by any state official during that time was on Feb. 27, 2015, a 2,193-mile journey to Virginia by Kobach to deliver a funeral eulogy for a former employee. He brought Dave DePue, a Topeka pastor whose ministry focuses on evangelizing government officials, <b>along</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> $3,290 <b>ride.</b> State Representative Jim Ward questioned whether state government should have paid <b>for</b> travel to <b>the</b> funeral. Kobach's flights included one to Lincoln, Nebraska in January 2015, to testify about the Kansas photo ID law as Nebraska's legislature considered passage of a similar statute to the one Kobach promoted in Kansas.

One of Kobach's daughters flew with him in May to a Republican luncheon in McPherson where he was keynote speaker, telling those gathered about voter fraud and his efforts to be able to bring criminal cases.

5000|$|The {{reception}} to {{the album}} has been mixed. Timothy Monger of Allmusic {{thought that the}} duo Ian Axel and Chad King tackled [...] "some classic pop territory with a wide-eyed sincerity that is ultimately appealing if occasionally trite," [...] that the production is [...] "concise and full of punch," [...] but there are moments that could [...] "benefit from some subtlety." [...] Jason Lipschutz of Billboard said that the album is [...] "as uniformly earnest as the sombre lead" [...] single [...] "Say Something," [...] but also has songs that offered [...] "quirky optimism and snappy tempo." [...] Glenn Gamboa of Newsday found the album filled with surprises and thought it musically and lyrically [...] "eclectic." [...] He judged the duo to have approached the album [...] "with such passion and joyfulness on [...] "Is There Anyone Out There?"(sic) that you end up going <b>along</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> wild <b>ride</b> and enjoying it." [...] Elysa Gardner of USA Today was equally positive and thought the tunes in the album [...] "smartly crafted," [...] the singing of the duo blended [...] "seamlessly," [...] and that their more driving tracks [...] "establish this pair as pop contenders." ...|$|R
