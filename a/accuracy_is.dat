25|$|Absolute <b>accuracy</b> <b>is</b> {{the error}} of the {{measurement}} compared to a perfect measurement. Relative <b>accuracy</b> <b>is</b> {{the error of}} the measurement compared to the device used to calibrate the multimeter. Most multimeter datasheets provide relative accuracy. To compute the absolute accuracy from the relative accuracy of a multimeter add the absolute accuracy of the device used to calibrate the multimeter to the relative accuracy of the multimeter.|$|E
25|$|The {{position}} {{calculated by}} a GPS receiver requires the current time, {{the position of}} the satellite and the measured delay of the received signal. The position <b>accuracy</b> <b>is</b> primarily dependent on the satellite position and signal delay.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} {{important}} analyser characteristics. The mass resolving {{power is the}} measure of the ability to distinguish two peaks of slightly different m/z. The mass <b>accuracy</b> <b>is</b> the ratio of the m/z measurement error to the true m/z. Mass <b>accuracy</b> <b>is</b> usually measured in ppm or milli mass units. The mass range is the range of m/z amenable to analysis by a given analyzer. The linear dynamic range is the range over which ion signal is linear with analyte concentration. Speed refers to the time frame of the experiment and ultimately is used to determine the number of spectra per unit time that can be generated.|$|E

25|$|With fully {{automatic}} weapons, open-bolt operation allows air to circulate, cooling the barrel; with semi-automatic firearms, the closed-bolt operation is preferred, as overheating {{is not as}} critical, and <b>accuracy</b> <b>is</b> preferred.

25|$|To {{increase}} the yield rate, advanced interventional imaging with angiographic C-arms {{has proven to}} be beneficial. The advantage of intra-procedural imaging is that the patient and the diaphragm are in exactly the same position during 2D/3D imaging and the actual biopsy. Hence the <b>accuracy</b> <b>is</b> usually much higher than using pre-operative data.|$|E
25|$|We can {{extrapolate}} {{from the}} above table that the step size needed to get an answer that is correct to three decimal places is approximately 0.00001, meaning that we need 400,000 steps. This large number of steps entails a high computational cost. For this reason, people usually employ alternative, higher-order methods such as Runge–Kutta methods or linear multistep methods, especially if a high <b>accuracy</b> <b>is</b> desired.|$|E

25|$|Discretization is {{typically}} achieved by sampling the Gaussian filter kernel at discrete points, normally at positions {{corresponding to the}} midpoints of each pixel. This reduces the computational cost but, for very small filter kernels, point sampling the Gaussian function with very few samples leads to a large error. In these cases, <b>accuracy</b> <b>is</b> maintained (at a slight computational cost) by integration of the Gaussian function over each pixel's area.|$|E
25|$|A {{particularly}} important objective, called computational thermochemistry, is to calculate thermochemical quantities {{such as the}} enthalpy of formation to chemical accuracy. Chemical <b>accuracy</b> <b>is</b> the accuracy required to make realistic chemical predictions and is {{generally considered to be}} 1kcal/mol or 4kJ/mol. To reach that accuracy in an economic way it is necessary to use a series of post-Hartree–Fock methods and combine the results. These methods are called quantum chemistry composite methods.|$|E
25|$|Beyond {{the elastic}} limit, {{permanent}} deformation will occur. The elastic limit is therefore the lowest stress at which permanent deformation can be measured. This requires a manual load-unload procedure, and the <b>accuracy</b> <b>is</b> critically {{dependent on the}} equipment used and operator skill. For elastomers, such as rubber, the elastic limit is {{much larger than the}} proportionality limit. Also, precise strain measurements have shown that plastic strain begins at low stresses.|$|E

In the checkout activities, the absolute geometric <b>accuracy</b> <b>was</b> examined. The <b>accuracy</b> <b>was</b> evaluated utilizing ground control point(GCP) s which were automatically extracted by the template matching between GLI image chips and coastline database. The examination for many images showed the geometric <b>accuracy</b> <b>was</b> about a few kilo-meters on the ground. Most of the errors were static, in other words, every image has the almost same geometric errors in both amplitude and direction. Such error patterns were seemed to be induced by the miss-alignments of the GLI sensor. The authors corrected the alignments of the GLI sensor based on the collinearity condition in the photogrammety. After the correction, the geometric <b>accuracy</b> <b>was</b> improved to about one pixel even in 250 m channel images...|$|R

For example, to change ¼ to a decimal, divide 4 into 1.00, to obtain 0.25. To change ⅓ to a decimal, divide 3 into 1.0000..., and stop when the desired <b>accuracy</b> <b>is</b> obtained. Note that ¼ can be written exactly with two decimal digits, while ⅓ cannot be written exactly with any finite number of decimal digits.|$|E
25|$|To {{measure the}} content {{selection}} part the Dice coefficient or the MASI (Measuring Agreement on Set-valued Items) metric are used. These measure the overlap of properties in two descriptions. In an evaluation the scores are usually averaged over references made by different human {{participants in the}} corpus. Also sometimes a measure called Perfect Recall Percentage (PRP) or <b>Accuracy</b> <b>is</b> used which calculates the percentage of perfect matches between an algorithm-produced and a human-produced reference.|$|E

The slowest speed is several steps {{faster than the}} slowest main sweep speed, although the fastest is generally the same. A calibrated multiturn delay time control offers wide range, high resolution delay settings; it spans the full duration of the main sweep, and its reading corresponds to graticule divisions (but with much finer precision).

25|$|Although {{his work}} is our most {{reliable}} source {{for the history of}} his era, its factual <b>accuracy</b> <b>is</b> occasionally questioned. The Annals are based in part on secondary sources, and there are some obvious mistakes, for instance the confusion of the two daughters of Mark Antony and Octavia Minor, who are both called Antonia. The Histories, however, are written from primary documents and intimate knowledge of the Flavian period, and are therefore thought to be more accurate.|$|E
25|$|Test {{equipment}} {{tends to}} drift {{out of calibration}} over time, and the specified accuracy cannot be relied upon indefinitely. For more expensive equipment, manufacturers and third parties provide calibration services so that older equipment may be recalibrated and recertified.
