40|$|Several {{variables}} are usually recorded on line in Intensive Care Units (ICU) to detect {{changes in a}} patientís state. Current <b>alarm</b> <b>systems</b> are based on fixed thresholds, generating many false alarms. This paper presents a filtering <b>alarm</b> <b>system</b> developed to reduce these false alarms, without missing any true alarm. A vital physiological variable, the oxygen saturation rate signal (SpO 2) is taken as an example. The filtering <b>alarm</b> <b>system</b> is started when the threshold based <b>alarm</b> <b>system</b> <b>sets</b> off an <b>alarm.</b> A multivariable analysis of the other monitored physiological variables is carried out on a fixed temporal window preceding the alarm, using change indices calculated from the physiological variables trend. These indices are aggregated using fuzzy decision making tools and allow classifying the alarm in ìtrueî or ìfalseî. The system was tested on 45 hours of data recorded every second on adult patients hospitalized in ICU. Results show that 31 out of the 35 false alarms set off by the classical system are filtered and no true alarm is missed, out of 45 ones...|$|R

The 'number of non-bells per 100 terrorists' and the 'number of non-terrorists per 100 bells' are unrelated quantities.

To show this, consider what happens if an identical <b>alarm</b> <b>system</b> were <b>set</b> up in a second city with no terrorists at all. As in the first city, the alarm sounds for 1 out of every 100 non-terrorist inhabitants detected, but unlike in the first city, the alarm never sounds for a terrorist. Therefore, 100% of all occasions of the alarm sounding are for non-terrorists, but a false negative rate cannot even be calculated. The 'number of non-terrorists per 100 bells' in that city is 100, yet P(T | B) = 0%. There is zero chance that a terrorist has been detected given the ringing of the bell.|$|R
