5|$|At {{an unknown}} date, {{which may have}} been in the early 640s, East Anglia was {{attacked}} by a Mercian army and Ecgric was obliged to defend it with a much smaller force, though one that was not negligible. The East Angles appealed to Sigeberht to leave his monastery and lead them in battle, hoping that his presence <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>memory</b> <b>of</b> his former military exploits would encourage the army and make them less likely to flee. Sigeberht refused, saying that he had renounced his worldly kingdom and now lived only for the heavenly kingdom. However, he was dragged from the monastery to the battlefield where, unwilling to bear arms, he went into battle carrying only a staff. The Mercians were victorious and Sigeberht, Ecgric and many of the East Angles were slain and their army was routed. In this way Sigeberht became a Christian martyr. He is among the names of the kings who according to an ancient saying, were avenged by the slaying of Penda in 654.|$|E

25|$|The {{film was}} based on the real events but with {{numerous}} compromises for its commercial appeal, such as including Americans among the escapees (none of whom were actually American).

In his sermon at Temple Israel, Wax told the congregation: [...] "This city shall witness a new spirit <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>memory</b> <b>of</b> this great prophet of our time shall be honored. There will be bigots and segregationists and the so-called respectable but unrighteous people who will resist. But in the scheme of history, God's will does prevail."

The only remaining impediment was a recommended ten-cent-an-hour raise on , followed by another raise on [...] The city budget did not have the estimated $558,000 (today $) required to pay the workers.

500|$|On some date between 15 May and 17 June 326, Constantine had {{his eldest}} son Crispus, by Minervina, seized and put to death by [...] "cold poison" [...] at Pola (Pula, Croatia). In July, Constantine had his wife, the Empress Fausta, killed in an over-heated bath. Their names were wiped {{from the face of}} many inscriptions, {{references}} to their lives in the literary record were eradicated, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>memory</b> <b>of</b> both was condemned. Eusebius, for example, edited praise of Crispus out of later copies of his Historia Ecclesiastica, and his Vita Constantini contains no mention of Fausta or Crispus at all. Few ancient sources are willing to discuss possible motives for the events; those few that do offer unconvincing rationales, are of later provenance, and are generally unreliable. At the time of the executions, it was commonly believed that the Empress Fausta was either in an illicit relationship with Crispus, or was spreading rumors to that effect. A popular myth arose, modified to allude to Hippolytus–Phaedra legend, with the suggestion that Constantine killed Crispus and Fausta for their immoralities. One source, the largely fictional Passion of Artemius, probably penned in the eighth century by John of Damascus, makes the legendary connection explicit. As an interpretation of the executions, the myth rests on only [...] "the slimmest of evidence": sources that allude to the relationship between Crispus and Fausta are late and unreliable, and the modern suggestion that Constantine's [...] "godly" [...] edicts of 326 and the irregularities of Crispus are somehow connected rests on no evidence at all.|$|E
