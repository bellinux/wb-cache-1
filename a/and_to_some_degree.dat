5|$|Although other breeds {{were being}} {{increasingly}} imported and bred, {{the numbers of}} the Finnhorse population also slowly began to recover; in 1997, 19,000 Finnhorses existed. Harness racing and associated parimutuel betting, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>some</b> <b>degree</b> also the relatively new hobby of riding, became {{the most important factors}} ensuring the survival of the breed.|$|E
5|$|Farsari's {{images were}} widely distributed, {{presented}} or mentioned {{in books and}} periodicals, and sometimes recreated by artists in other media; they shaped foreign perceptions {{of the people and}} places of Japan <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>some</b> <b>degree</b> affected how Japanese saw themselves and their country.|$|E
5|$|Law {{enforcement}} at {{the county}} level, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>some</b> <b>degree</b> at the state level, became notoriously tolerant of the illegal activities in Galveston, {{in no small part}} because of the prosperity they generated, and the bribery and influence peddled by the Maceos. The city police very early on became entirely complicit.|$|E

5|$|Many of the {{facets of}} Minnesota culture that are {{perceived}} as the area's early history in fact originated after this period. Notably, the heavy Scandinavian immigration for which the state is known, and the pioneering days chronicled by author Laura Ingalls Wilder occurred after statehood in the later 19th century. Unlike these later years, {{the first half of}} the 19th century was characterized by sparsely populated communities, harsh living conditions, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>some</b> <b>degree,</b> lawlessness.|$|E

25|$|Pashto {{employs the}} Pashto alphabet, a {{modified}} {{form of the}} Perso-Arabic alphabet. It has extra letters for Pashto-specific sounds. Since the 17th century, Pashto has been primarily written in the Naskh script, rather than the Nasta'liq script used for Urdu alphabet <b>and,</b> <b>to</b> <b>some</b> <b>degree,</b> the Persian alphabet.|$|E
25|$|George Adamski (17 April 1891 – 23 April 1965) was a Polish American {{citizen who}} became widely known in ufology circles, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>some</b> <b>degree</b> in popular culture, after {{he claimed to}} have photographed spaceships from other planets, met with {{friendly}} Nordic alien Space Brothers, and to have taken flights with them to the Moon and other planets.|$|E
25|$|Consisting {{of sixteen}} books written in Latin on the {{invitation}} of Archbishop Absalon, Gesta Danorum describes Danish history <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>some</b> <b>degree</b> Scandinavian history in general, from prehistory to the late 12th century. In addition, Gesta Danorum offers singular reflections on European affairs in the High Middle Ages from a unique Scandinavian perspective, supplementing what has been handed down by historians from Western and Southern Europe.|$|E

25|$|Lead, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>some</b> <b>degree</b> tin, {{as used in}} solder {{contains}} {{small but}} significant amounts of radioisotope impurities. Radioisotopes undergoing alpha decay are a concern due to their tendency to cause soft errors. Polonium-210 is especially problematic; lead-210 beta decays to bismuth-210 which then beta decays to polonium-210, an intense emitter of alpha particles. Uranium-238 and thorium-232 are other significant contaminants of alloys of lead.|$|E
25|$|Mason's {{idea was}} to remove what American {{railroad}} men saw as the biggest disadvantages of the Fairlie - its cramped space for fuel and water caused by its double ended design (not very useful on American railroads where there was always ample room for a turntable or wye), its cramped cab caused by the joined double boilers, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>some</b> <b>degree</b> its poor riding.|$|E
25|$|Charlie asks Sarah {{what she}} would do if Leslie went away and did not come back. Nancy becomes angry at him for asking. Sarah is upset by the {{question}} and wants {{to go back to the}} sea. Leslie hits and chokes Charlie for making Sarah cry. Leslie and Sarah decide to go back. Nancy tells them to stay because eventually they will have to come back. Nancy, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>some</b> <b>degree</b> Charlie, offer their help. Leslie accepts their offer.|$|E

25|$|Organic {{chemicals}} {{are widely used}} as ingredients in household products. Paints, varnishes, and wax all contain organic solvents, as do many cleaning, disinfecting, cosmetic, degreasing, and hobby products. Fuels {{are made up of}} organic chemicals. All of these products can release organic compounds during usage, <b>and,</b> <b>to</b> <b>some</b> <b>degree,</b> when they are stored. Testing emissions from building materials used indoors has become increasingly common for floor coverings, paints, and many other important indoor building materials and finishes.|$|E
25|$|Classification of the {{earliest}} finds was attempted {{on the basis of}} the skull roof, often the only part of the specimen preserved. With the frequent convergent evolution of head shape in labyrinthodonts, this led to form taxa only. The relationship of the various groups to each other and to the lissamphibians (<b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>some</b> <b>degree</b> the first reptiles) is still a matter of some debate. Several schemes have been forwarded, and at present there is no consensus among workers in the field.|$|E
25|$|Told in a first-person narrative, {{the story}} {{focuses on the}} author's {{discovery}} of the doubly fictional world of Tlön, whose inhabitants are completely idealistic and live imaginative lives. Relatively long for Borges (approximately 5,600 words), the story {{is a work of}} speculative fiction. One of the major themes of Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius is that ideas ultimately manifest themselves in the physical world and the story is generally viewed as a parabolic discussion of Berkeleyan idealism, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>some</b> <b>degree</b> as a protest against totalitarianism.|$|E

25|$|While {{at the end}} of the 19th century, the townland was in {{many ways}} similar to what it had been at its {{beginning}} - the McGeough family still held title to the land, and the great majority of the inhabitants worked as peasants thereon - in many ways it was transformed. The population was steep decline, now both educated (to at least an elementary level) and bilingual, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>some</b> <b>degree</b> radicalised, all of which would serve (to some degree) in contributing to the portentous changes which would occur during the first half of the 20th century.|$|E
25|$|As an aristocrat and {{political}} intriguer, Gage viewed Rogers as a provincial upstart who posed {{a threat to}} his newly acquired power, due to his friendship with Amherst. At the time, Rogers was still a half-pay captain in the British army <b>and,</b> <b>to</b> <b>some</b> <b>degree,</b> under Gage's military jurisdiction. However, Gage could not challenge Rogers, the king's appointee, unless he could find a good reason, as the king would countermand any legal process {{in order to save}} his favorites. Knowing this, Gage actively set about finding an immutable justification to remove Rogers as royal governor {{in a way that would}} forestall royal intervention.|$|E
25|$|The Assyrians, {{like the}} rest of the Mesopotamian peoples, {{followed}} the ancient Mesopotamian religion, with the national god Assur having pride of place at the head of the Old Assyrian Empire. Other major gods within the pantheon of the Old Assyrian Empire were: Ishtar, Adad, Sin, Ninurta, Nergal, and Ninlil. Assyrian architecture, like that of Babylonia, was influenced by Sumero-Akkadian styles (<b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>some</b> <b>degree</b> Mitanni), but early on developed its own distinctive style. Palaces sported colorful wall decorations, and seal-cutting (an art learned from Mittani) developed apace. Schools for scribes taught both the Babylonian and Assyrian dialects of the Akkadian language, and Sumerian and Akkadian literary works were often copied with an Assyrian flavor.|$|E
50|$|The {{different}} creation accounts {{were each}} {{associated with the}} cult of a particular god {{in one of the}} major cities of Egypt: Hermopolis, Heliopolis, Memphis, <b>and</b> Thebes. <b>To</b> <b>some</b> <b>degree</b> these myths represent competing theologies, but they also represent different aspects of the process of creation.|$|R
