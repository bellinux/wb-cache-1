40|$|This {{research}} {{examines the}} teaching methods in a Year 7 distance education English programme {{in relation to}} text complexity in reading and written English. It considers student performance, processes, resources <b>and</b> <b>teaching</b> strategies. The research focuses on the <b>assessment</b> <b>and</b> <b>teaching</b> of text complexity in reading and written English in relation to student aptitude.

Consideration is also given to criticism of the new English curriculum especially where it is relevant to the teaching of text complexity in reading and written English.

This paper presents an approach to curriculum design that links the pedagogical concerns of quality standards and knowledge creation to the commercial imperatives of funding and development of third-stream income. Drawing in part on Whittington's classification of theories of strategy, it suggests an emergent process serving multiple outcomes in a low-cost, low-risk model.

Using the technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK) framework, this study investigated how contextual factors predicted the number of website components related to the teacher information, communication, classroom management, <b>and</b> <b>teaching</b> <b>content</b> section of a class website designed by a Texas high school teacher. This quantitative, predictive correlational research design included data collected from a proportional allocation of 191 Texas high school teacher websites representing 20 geographic areas, 5 content areas, 5 grade levels, Title 1 designation, campus enrollment levels, and self-reported teacher technology readiness. Multiple regressions revealed the campus 2 ̆ 7 Title 1 designation {{was a significant predictor}} of the number of teacher information <b>and</b> <b>teaching</b> <b>content</b> components included on the class websites of Texas high school teachers. The study revealed that opportunities to access online resources through class websites were reduced for students in Title 1 designated schools.

Educational decision makers and administrators may use this information to determine where expenditures should be made to ensure development of class websites that meet students 2 ̆ 7 needs.

40|$|To {{encourage}} {{teachers of}} secondary two science to link <b>assessment</b> <b>and</b> <b>teaching</b> strategies to promote learning {{through use of}} a web-based environment, two online <b>assessment</b> <b>and</b> diagnostic tools were trialed in five Hong Kong schools. The Diagnostic Tutorial <b>Assessment</b> System (DTAS) <b>and</b> the Intelligent Content Assessment Marking (ICAM) System were used in a collaborative project which was initiated by faculty of the Hong Kong Institute of Education. The project involved teachers, students, course designers, curriculum officers and a technology company. Two tools, integrated within an e-learning environment allowed teachers to diagnose student's learning difficulties and to focus on students' preparedness for learning. By identifying more explicitly the type of questions or topics that a student can or cannot solve, teachers could further determine whether a student was ready to learn and what format of instruction was most appropriate. The outcome {{of the project was}} a set of customised <b>teaching</b> <b>and</b> learning <b>content</b> materials based on the Hong Kong secondary two science curriculum. Both teachers and students could also access an elaborate online tool that provided accurate profiles of individual students learning progress.
