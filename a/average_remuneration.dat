60|$|In {{the first}} place it is unhappily true that the wages of {{ordinary}} labor, in all the countries of Europe, are wretchedly insufficient to supply the physical and moral necessities {{of the population in}} any tolerable measure. But, when it is further alleged that even this insufficient remuneration has a tendency to diminish; that there is, in the words of M. Louis Blanc, une baisse continue des salaires; the assertion is in opposition to all accurate information, and to many notorious facts. It has yet to be proved that there is any country in the civilized world where the ordinary wages of labor, estimated either in money or in articles of consumption, are declining; while in many they are, on the whole, on the increase; and an increase which is becoming, not slower, but more rapid. There are, occasionally, branches of industry which are being gradually superseded by something else, and, in those, until production accommodates itself to demand, wages are depressed; which is an evil, but a temporary one, and would admit of great alleviation even in the present system of social economy. A diminution thus produced of the reward of labor in some particular employment is the effect and the evidence of increased remuneration, or of a new source of remuneration, in some other; the total and the <b>average</b> <b>remuneration</b> being undiminished, or even increased. To make out an appearance of diminution in the rate of wages in any leading branch of industry, it is always found necessary to compare some month or year of special and temporary depression at the present time, with the average rate, or even some exceptionally high rate, at an earlier time. The vicissitudes are no doubt a great evil, but they were as frequent and as severe in former periods of economical history as now. The greater scale of the transactions, and the greater number of persons involved in each fluctuation, may make the fluctuation appear greater, but though a larger population affords more sufferers, the evil does not weigh heavier on each of them individually. There is much evidence of improvement, and none, that is at all trustworthy, of deterioration, in the mode of living of the laboring population of the countries of Europe; when there is any appearance to the contrary it is local or partial, and can always be traced either to the pressure of some temporary calamity, or to some bad law or unwise act of government which admits of being corrected, while the permanent causes all operate in the direction of improvement.|$|E

40|$|The {{issue of}} the basic teachers' {{remuneration}} is still very far from a reasonable solution. Data published by the INEP (based on the 2006 PNAD) show, first of all, an extreme disparity in the country: the highest <b>average</b> <b>remuneration</b> {{was found in the}} Federal District, with R$ 3. 371, 00, considerably above all other states. The second highest <b>average</b> <b>remuneration</b> was paid in the state of Rio de Janeiro and the third one in Sergipe; both were a little above 60 % in comparison with the salary paid in the Federal District. The smallest <b>average</b> <b>remuneration</b> was found in Pernambuco: only 24 % of the salary paid in the Federal District. It seems we are not talking of the same country, so great is the disparity. Secondly, there is no major correspondence between higher remuneration and better school performance, partially because there is no automatic correlation, partially because higher remuneration does not result from the acknowledgment of the students' school performance, but in general from the political struggle waged by the teachers' unions. Perhaps this explains the fact that Sergipe, a state from the Northeast, has the third highest <b>average</b> <b>remuneration</b> in the country. Even so, the article supports the idea that it is fundamental to improve the living conditions of teachers, especially because of their social dignity, of which they are also noteworthy constructors. Therefore, the recent proposal of 40 working hours per week and a basic salary of R$ 950, 00 seems to be very unsatisfactory, as it cannot regulate teachers' work time preferably in eight hours daily. It is very important to achieve, over time, a more visible correlation between the improvement of the teachers' remuneration and the improvement of students' learning...|$|E
40|$|The German Corporate Governance Code works {{according}} to the comply-or-explain principle. One of its recommendations was to publish the remuneration {{of the members of}} the executive board on an individual basis. We examine the characteristics of the firms that complied with the code requirement. Our results indicate that firms that paid higher <b>average</b> <b>remunerations</b> to their management board members were less likely to comply, whereas firms with higher Tobin's Q were more likely to comply. We also document a non-monotonic relation between ownership concentration and the probability of compliance that is consistent with standard corporate governance arguments. Due to the fact that the number of firms complying with the disclosure requirement was low, a new law was passed that mandates disclosure unless the shareholders' meeting (with a 75 % majority) decides otherwise. We find that this "loophole" in the new legislation is exploited by smaller firms, firms with comparatively high levels of executive remuneration, and firms with concentrated ownership. We discuss the implications of our results for the effectiveness of the comply-or-explain regulation. ...|$|R

We find positive abnormal announcement returns for both bondholders and stockholders for banks with high PPS executives.

There is empirical literature which analyses the interrelation between board features and company performance. The results suggest that board characteristics have a measureable impact on the economic success of a firm. Although the two-tier system prevalent in “Continental European” countries significantly differs from the one-tier regime as it separates management and supervision of an organization, there is little research done by now to examine, whether results from one-tier regimes persist in this alternative setting. Our study explores the interrelations between supervisory board characteristics and accounting as well as market based corporate performance by using a sample of German listed companies.

Additionally and in contrast to previous results in different governance settings we find that board size does not negatively buy positively affect firm performance in terms of accounting based figures...|$|E
40|$|Historically a {{significant}} gap {{between male and}} female wages has existed in the Australian labour market. Indeed this wage differential was institutionalised in the 1912 arbitration decision which determined that the basic female wage would be set at between 54 and 66 per cent of the male wage. More recently however, the 1969 and 1972 Equal Pay Cases determined that male/female wage relativities should be based upon the premise of equal pay for work of equal value. It {{is important to note that}} the mere observation that average wages differ between males and females is not sine qua non evidence of sex discrimination. Economists restrict the definition of wage discrimination to cases where two distinct groups receive different <b>average</b> <b>remuneration</b> for reasons unrelated to differences in productivity characteristics. This paper extends previous studies of wage discrimination in Australia (Chapman and Mulvey, 1986; Haig, 1982) by correcting the estimated male/female wage differential for the existence of non-random sampling. Previous Australian estimates of male/female human capital basedwage specifications together with estimates of the corresponding wage differential all suffer from a failure to address this issue. If the sample of females observed to be working does not represent a random sample then the estimates of the male/female wage differential will be both biased and inconsistent...|$|E

The relationship between the base salary, total remuneration, % Change in Total Remuneration and Total Shareholder Return for CEOs from the ASX 20 was poor for both 2008 and 2009. Most CEOs increased their remuneration regardless of the Total Shareholder Return. The average total shareholder return for 2008 was - 0. 98 %.

Aside from the Introduction and Conclusion, the thesis consists of four chapters. The second chapter discusses the concept of compensations in labour law, and provides an analysis of the functions of labour law compensations, from the perspective of both the employee and employer. An overview of the different types of compensations is provided, including their categorization. Redundancy payment, the primary and most frequent type of labour law compensation in Czech law, forms the content of chapter three. The functions of redundancy payments are explained, and the terms and conditions which give rise to the right of employees to redundancy payment are analyzed. Further, the amounts of redundancy payments under different circumstances are dealt with in detail, including an explanation of the methods of their calculation; the author also focuses on the category of <b>average</b> monthly <b>remuneration</b> and its importance in this relation.

40|$|It is {{necessary}} to review the arguments of Mr. Ogilvy, {{in so far as}} they are supposed to touch upon my former paper on Strikes and their Influence upon Wages. We are substantially in agreement in the view stated by me in my former paper, that a strike may be the means of successfully raising the status of some branches of labour that are comparatively under-paid or over-worked; it may raise the real wages of a particular country or locality which formerly laboured under the <b>average</b> <b>remuneration</b> of other countries; it may be the means of forcing the capitalist or employer to give a fairer or larger share of the profits of capital and labour—i. e., machinery, plant, skill, and labour. Of late years, through the improved condition of labour, some of the labourers had been able to make savings which accumulated so that they could do for a certain time without actual labour. This was the secret of the source and success of all strikes. The main question at issue was whether it was possible by the present appliances to produce a great deal more of the articles necessary for life and comfort than was produced previously; if so, by labourers having the means of getting a larger share in the products their condition would undoubtedly be improved...|$|E
40|$|This paper empirically {{examines}} {{the factors that}} determine managers' remuneration {{in a sample of}} 97 UK small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The sample was partitioned into two groups, one comprising of 69 managers working for firms located in the South East (SE) economic planning region and the other comprising 28 managers working for firms located in 'other English regions' (OR). The <b>average</b> <b>remuneration</b> of managers located in the SE {{in the latter half of}} 1988 was 30 000 Pounds whilst for those located in the OR their remuneration was significantly less and averaged only 17 500 Pounds for the same period. Several wage equations were then estimated to determine if this difference in remuneration was due primarily to differences in the managers' human capital and/or employing-firm characteristics or whether, after controlling for these factors, it was possible to detect a significant independent locational influence. The results indicate that both human capital (primarily the managers' age and qualifications) and firm/job-specific factors (their relative workloads, the size and growth of the firm in terms of assets) and the location of their employing firms were able to explain a large proportion of the variance in remuneration. Though the locational effect was statistically significant, after controlling for differences in human capital and job/firm-specific factors, the remuneration of the SE managers was estimated to be only some 3000 Pounds higher than that of managers located elsewhere in England...|$|E
40|$|Objectives Occupational {{accidents}} {{constitute a}} substantial health and economic burden for societies {{around the world}} and a variety of factors determine the frequency of accidents at work. The aim {{of this paper is to}} investigate the relationship between the economic situation and the rate of occupational accidents in Poland. Material and Methods The analysis comprised data for 66 Polish sub-regions taken from the Central Statistical Office’s Local Data Bank. The regression analysis with panel data for period 2002 – 2014 was applied to identify the relationships involved. Four measures of accidents were used: the rates of total occupational accidents, accidents among men and women separately as well as days of incapacity to work due to accidents at work per employee. Four alternative measures assessed the economic situation: gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, <b>average</b> <b>remuneration,</b> the unemployment rate and number of dwelling permits. The confounding variables included were: employment in hazardous conditions and the size of enterprises. Results The results of the regression estimates show that the number of occupational accidents in Poland exhibits procyclical behavior, which means that more accidents are observed during the times of economic expansion. Stronger relationships were observed in the equations explaining men’s accident rates as well as total rates. A weaker and not always statistically significant impact of economic situation was identified for women’s accident rates and days of incapacity to work. Conclusions The results have important implications for occupational health and safety actions. In the periods of higher work intensity employers should focus on appropriate training and supervision of inexperienced workers as well as on ensuring enough time for already experienced employees to recuperate. In terms of public health actions, policy makers should focus on scrutinizing working conditions, educating employers and counteracting possible discrimination of injured employees.

40|$|Background: Residents' {{perception}} {{on quality}} of endocrinology training in India is not known. This study aimed {{to evaluate the}} perceptions about endocrinology residency programs in India among current trainees as compared to practicing endocrinologists. Methods: Trainees attending a preconference workshop at the annual conference of Endocrine Society of India (ESI) were given a questionnaire designed to evaluate their perceptions on their training. These evaluated the reasons for choosing endocrinology, their experiences during residency, and career plans. Practicing endocrinologists attending ESICON with at least 5 -year experience were evaluated as controls. Results: Questionnaires from 63 endocrine trainees and 78 practicing endocrinologists were analyzed. Endocrinology {{is perceived to be}} the super-specialty with the best quality of life (QOL) but fair with regard to financial remuneration. Among current trainees, 61. 89 %, 31. 74 %, and 34. 91 % are satisfied with training in clinical endocrinology, laboratory endocrinology, and clinical/translational research, respectively. The corresponding figures for practicing endocrinologists are 71. 78 %, 25. 63 %, and 30. 75 %, respectively. Exposure to national endocrinology conferences during their endocrinology residency was adequate. However, exposure to international endocrinology conferences, research publications, project writing, and grant application are limited. Laboratory endocrinology is rated as the most neglected aspect during endocrine residency. Most of the trainees want to establish their own clinical practice in the long run. Very few trainees (17. 46 %) wish to join the medical education services. Conclusion: There is a good perception of QOL in endocrinology in spite of <b>average</b> financial <b>remuneration.</b> There is dissatisfaction with the quality of training in laboratory endocrinology and clinical research.

This paper aims to provide an insightful and up-to-date complement to existing literature {{particularly with respect to}} short-term executive remuneration and corporate governance practices specifically in the UK. This study initially provides an overview of the main theoretical concepts related to executive remuneration and then examines the pay-performance link. It also attempts to observe the effect of various other determinants of total executive remuneration on a sample of fifty companies from the FTSE 100 index. The study also inspects the pay-performance relationship using various components like director base salary/fees, benefits and emoluments as well as variations of executive pay like <b>average</b> director <b>remuneration</b> and HPD remuneration. The results of this study are in line with prior research conducted in this field. The regression results indicate that firm performance has a significant impact on executive remuneration. Another significant determinant of executive pay was found to be the firm size variable which indicated that the level of executive pay increases with firm size. The findings of the study also suggest that corporate governance variables, measuring board characteristics like the size and proportion of non-executive directors on the board as well as the remuneration committee have an equally significant impact on the determination of executive remuneration. This study also sheds light on the corporate governance issues, mechanisms and recent reforms that have an effect on executive remuneration practices.

This study is using panel data analysis on 76 public listed companies in ACE Market from 2009 to 2013 (5 years) with the total of 380 observations. Similar to AIM Market in UK, ACE Market is set up to facilitate emerging companies, which are important to Malaysia economic growth, to raise capital easily. Unfortunately, these companies are shunned by investors because being perceived of having high agency cost and risky. Therefore by studying the executive remuneration, this study would provide an insight for company to design an optimal remuneration packages to align executive directors to shareholders’ interest which in return increasing shareholders’ confidence, interest and investment in this market. The outcome of the study indicates that overall the executive directors' remunerations are fairly aligned to shareholders’ interest. Remuneration is positively determined by company performance and company size which indicates good corporate governance. Interestingly, <b>average</b> <b>remuneration</b> is negatively determined by proportion of executive directors to the board which show ACE companies have set limited budget for hiring executive directors. Unfortunately, executive directors with high share ownership have strong influence on the remuneration which indicates boards of directors have failed to suppress executive directors’ influence. The implication of this study shows that it is important for government to impose some regulations to reduce the influence of executive directors on the board. One of the options available is to compel companies to have shareholders voting on executive directors’ remuneration which encourage boards to justify the remuneration packages to shareholders. Another option is to make it compulsory for remuneration board to consist of non-executive directors only in order have impartial decision on the remuneration packages...|$|E
40|$|This report {{recommends}} that corporate governance should be strengthened through {{the introduction of}} independent remuneration committees, measures to promote board accountability and shareholder engagement, enhanced pay disclosure and increased pressure on those boards that are unresponsive to shareholder concerns. Strong growth in executive remuneration from the 1990 s to 2007, and instances of large payments despite poor company performance, have fuelled community concerns that executive remuneration is out of control. Pay for CEOs of the top 100 companies appears to have grown most strongly, at 13 per cent real a year, from the mid- 90 s to 2000, and then increased by around 6 per cent annually in real terms to 2007. Since 2007 <b>average</b> <b>remuneration</b> has fallen by around 16 per cent a year, returning it to 2004 - 05 levels. Liberalisation of the Australian economy and global competition, increased company size, and the shift to incentive pay structures, have been major drivers of executive remuneration - companies compete to hire the best person for the job, and try to structure pay to maximise the executive 2 ̆ 7 s contribution to company performance. Nonetheless, some past trend and specific pay outcomes appear inconsistent with an efficient executive labour market, and possibly weakened company performance.

40|$|Evaluations of an economy's {{economic}} performance are often made using {{a measure of}} real gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, which represents the <b>average</b> <b>remuneration</b> (labour income plus capital services) that an economy generates through domestic production. Because real GDP is a constant dollar measure of the remuneration to capital and labour in an economy, it {{does not account for}} who owns the capital, {{how much of it is}} used up through production or how relative price shifts affect the volume of goods and services that can be purchased. Modifications can be made to traditional estimates of GDP to account for these factors. This paper examines the performance of the Canadian economy using alternate measures' gross domestic income, gross national income and net national income. The paper also examines the relative performance of the Canadian and U. S. economies using standard GDP measures and these alternate measures. The comparison spans the period from 1980 to 2006, but focuses on the 2002 -to- 2006 period. During these latter years, changes in commodity prices, manufactured goods prices, the exchange rate, international investment income and capital consumption have all contributed importantly to real income growth in Canada. As a result, a very different picture of relative performance of the Canadian and U. S. economies emerges when an aggregate income measure is used that accounts for relative price changes, international income flows and capital consumption than when real GDP is used. From 2002 to 2006, U. S. real GDP per capita grew 9. 3 % while Canadian GDP per capita rose 7. 0 %, making it appear that the U. S. economy was outperforming the Canadian economy. However, once changes in resource prices and the exchange rate, international investment income and capital consumption are taken into account, real income per capita in the United States increased by 8. 6 %, which is similar to its GDP per capita growth. However, the Canadian adjusted measure of real income per capita growth rose 15. 6 %, more than twice the per capita real GDP growth in Canada and nearly double the U. S. rate. In contrast, the difference between the two economies was exactly the opposite in the period from 1980 to 2000 when commodity prices were falling, when the exchange rate was not appreciating and when outward flows of income to foreigners were increasing relative to the income paid to Canadians. During this period, when consideration is given to these factors, real income measures in Canada were falling relative to those in the United States.

40|$|Are {{state and}} local {{government}} workers overcompensated? In this paper, we step back from the highly charged rhetoric and address this question with the two primary data sources for looking at compensation of {{state and local}} government workers: the Current Population Survey conducted by the Bureau of the Census for the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and the Employer Costs for Employee Compensation microdata collected as part of the National Compensation Survey of the Bureau of Labor Statistics. In both data sets, the workers being hired in the public sector have higher skill levels than those in the private sector, so the challenge is to compare across sectors in a way that adjusts suitably for this difference. After controlling for skill differences and incorporating employer costs for benefits packages, we find that, on average, public sector workers in state government have compensation costs 3 - 10 percent greater than those for workers in the private sector, while in local government the gap is 10 - 19 percent. We caution that this finding is somewhat dependent on the chosen sample and specification, that averages can obscure broader differences in distributions, and that a host of worker and job attributes are not available to us in these data. Nonetheless, the data suggest that public sector workers, especially local government ones, on <b>average,</b> receive greater <b>remuneration</b> than observably similar private sector workers. Overturning this result would require, we think, strong arguments for particular model specifications, or different data. ...|$|R
50|$|Cairnes' {{exposition}} {{of the natural}} or social limit to free competition, and of its bearing on the theory of value: He {{points out that in}} any organised society there can hardly be the ready transference of capital from one employment to another, which is the indispensable condition of free competition; while class distinctions render it impossible for labour to transfer itself readily to new occupations. Society may thus be regarded as consisting of a series of noncompeting industrial groups, with free competition among the members of any one group or class. Now the only condition under which cost of production will regulate value is perfect competition. It follows that the normal value of commodities-the value which gives to the producers the <b>average</b> and usual <b>remuneration</b> will depend upon cost of production only when the exchange is confined to the members of one class, among whom there is free competition. In exchange between classes or non-competing industrial groups, the normal value is simply a case of international value, and depends upon reciprocal demand, that is to say, is such as will satisfy the equation of demand. This theory is a substantial contribution to economical science and throws great light upon the general problem of value. At the same time, it may be thought that Cairnes overlooked a point brought forward prominently by Senior, who also had called attention to the bearing of competition on the relation between cost of production and value. The cost to the producer fixes the limit below which the price cannot fall without the supply being affected; but it is the desire of the consumer-i.e. what he is willing to give up rather than be compelled to produce the commodity for himself that fixes the maximum value of the article. To treat the whole problem of natural or normal value {{from the point of view}} of the producer is to give but a one-sided theory of the facts.|$|R
40|$|This {{paper has}} {{examined}} which medium-term effects the Norwegian gender quota law {{has had on}} corporate boards listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange from 2009 to 2015. Wehave studied the gender quota law’s impact on different corporate board factors, such as board composition, the number of directorships held, basic remuneration, board size, andthe age of directors. Further, we also compared the gender quota law’s effects on these factors with similar studies made in earlier periods. The {{reason for that is}} to recognise whether there is a tendency of convergence over time. The study have been conducted using a quantitative approach by gathering information from mostly annual reports. Since, this is a comparative study, we will be using the same methods as previous researchers. These methods are arithmetic averages and standard deviations. We have also included some other methods to strengthen the results, such as geometric average, median, correlations, and significance test. The results of our research show that the number of directorships held by female directors decreased in both absolute numbers as well as in <b>averages</b> and dispersion. <b>Remuneration</b> for female directors increased. However, it diverged with male directors. The average board size did not remain significantly constant over time. We also found that the average age of board directors both increase and converges between the genders. We also believed that the proportion of female directors was depended on the firm’s board size, which the results showed was an incorrect assumption. This paper has applied an overarching theory called contingency theory. Further, other complementary theories within the area of corporate governance have also been used such as stakeholder theory, agency theory, and resource dependency theory. When analysing the results from this paper, there were too many plausible and contrasting theoretical explanations for why the various outcomes occurred. Therefore, {{we do not believe that}} the existing theoretical frameworks available are appropriate to explain how the gender quota law will impact corporate boards. The main contribution of this study is the results that show how both female and maledirectors’ average age and directorships held are converging over the observed period. Also, that the gender quota law has enabled female directors to gain more experience, which has led to a higher proportion of female directors...|$|R
40|$|The {{original}} {{policy for}} the implementation of payroll taxes was to impose a tax on wages as both a funding mechanism for, and a limitation to, qualifying for social security. However, the self-employment tax base developed severe inconsistencies with this original policy and among different tax entities by including certain returns on capital investments in the tax base. At present, different payroll tax obligations arise for similarly situated taxpayers based solely on how business owners elect to be taxed under the check-the-box regulations. These inconsistencies resulted from misguided efforts by Congress and the Treasury to view the payroll tax base with the same lens as the income tax. This misconception is evident in regulations and proposals that seek to distinguish wages from capital for purposes of payroll taxes based on the active/passive distinction that arose under the passive loss limitation rules of the income tax. Following the lead of the self-employment tax base, the newly minted net investment income tax base that arose under the Affordable Care Act now suffers from similar inconsistencies. Consequently, certain capital income for active members of tax partnerships is included in the self-employment tax base, and this same income for shareholders of S corporations is neither taxed as self-employment income nor taxed under the net investment income tax regime. Also, owner–employees are entitled to significant reductions in their payroll tax obligations when the value of their services provided to the company exceeds their share of the income from the company. This reduction is never recaptured even if the company becomes very profitable in subsequent years. The net investment income tax takes effect {{for the first time in}} 2013, and there are currently pending legislative proposals that seek to merge the income tax provisions for the various flow-through entities under one standardized set of rules. So the time is ripe to eliminate the various inconsistencies in the payroll tax and net investment income tax by using a uniform standard consistently applied across all entities and taxpayers. This Article makes four recommendations to restore the payroll tax regime to its original purpose and cure these inconsistencies in the payroll tax and net investment income tax bases. First, payroll taxes should be standardized for all taxpayers across all tax entities by using the reasonable compensation standard so that capital income is entirely eliminated from the payroll tax base. Second, the Treasury should issue additional significant regulations to improve the administration of the reasonable compensation standard, including providing safe harbor amounts that can be claimed as reasonable compensation for the value of services provided by owner–employees based on the <b>average</b> <b>remuneration</b> paid to similarly situated nonowner taxpayers. Third, to the extent that the owner–employee’s share of income for the year is less than the value of services provided to the company, such deficiency should be carried forward for up to three future tax years and applied to increase the payroll tax base of the owner–employee to the extent that the owner–employee’s share of income exceeds the value of services provided in such later years. Finally, the definition for net investment income for purposes of the net investment income tax, a tax which is specifically meant to apply to returns on capital, should be modified to simply include all items of income that are not otherwise subject to the payroll tax base as wages. Since the proper implementation of these recommendations would require congressional action and the motivation for such changes is to restore the payroll tax base to its original foundation rather than to cut taxes or raise revenues, these changes should be made on as close to a revenue-neutral basis as possible. After taking the projected revenue adjustments in the payroll and net investment income taxes along with the projected adjustments to future outlays within the relevant budget window, the tax rates could be adjusted downward to the extent the changes increase net revenues or upward should these changes result in a decrease in net revenues. These changes would reacquaint payroll taxes with the original {{policy for the}} social security tax and benefit system—namely, that it be based on the wages of wage earners rather than capital income—and would eliminate the arbitrary variance in the self-employment and net investment income tax bases between identical business activities of owners of different flow-through entities...|$|E
40|$|M. Comm. This chapter has {{provided}} the quantitative analysis into the question of trade unions affecting productivity and unit labour costs in a negative manner. We started by making the statement that investing in capital inputs usually requires the company concerned to borrow funds from a bank, against the current lending rate. Should this lending rate increase, we would expect the amount of fixed capital invested to fall and vice versa. The pattern of interest rates and gross fixed capital formation followed this orthodox theory but that of South Africa has not: where interest rates have been rising, so too has the level of fixed investment. One may therefore conclude that industries in South Africa value capital inputs highly and are prepared to pay a higher price {{in order to have}} more capital inputs in their production process. We then went on to analyse the South African motor vehicle industry and {{came to the conclusion that}} the factor inputs of capital and labour were not optimally allocated and that the industry operated at a less than efficient point. In fact, labour was being over-utilised and capital was being under-utilised. We also noted that labour productivity over the past decade had been declining: labour was more productive in 1984 than in 1993. The only way for the South African motor vehicle industry to become more internationally competitive is for it to operate more efficiently and contain costs. One of the ways in which it could do this would be to move closer to the level of optimum factor input; this will mean that both capital and labour inputs will be better allocated. More capital needs to be utilised and several thousand workers needs to be retrenched; Kleynhans estimates 24 000 to 36 000 workers (1994 : 143). It is most likely to be the actions of labour unions that have caused vast numbers of unproductive workers to be employed at high wages. Any past attempt to reduce the size of the workforce has naturally met with strong criticism from the unions and this has led to strike action and work stoppages. Unfortunately, the harsh reality is that labour needs to be replaced by capital if the industry is to survive internationally. It was noted in a table comparing the <b>average</b> <b>remuneration</b> of workers in the motor vehicle industry of different countries that the seven other countries discussed all showed higher rates of remuneration than in South Africa. Since these countries all have highly competitive motor vehicle manufacturing industries, one must be led to the conclusion that the higher wages are only paid because of a high rate of labour productivity within that sector. This again sustains the argument that higher wages are not detrimental to an industrial sector, provided productivity is relatively higher than the wage increases. The next industry to be considered was the South African clothing industry. Again the analysis proved that factor inputs were not optimally allocated. It appeared that capital was over-utilised and labour was under-utilised but after testing the significance of the result, Clark (1996 : 72) said that this was not necessarily true. The marginal productivity of capital indicated that capital inputs used in the production process are unproductive: this was confirmed by the fact that the marginal product of capital was negative. However, referring to table 5. 3 which gave the production, capital and labour data for the industry, usage of the factor input capital seems to have remained constant. One would therefore conclude that as output has been increasing, the contribution of the factor input capital has been decreasing. Clark (1996 : 91) outlines two possible reasons for this phenomenon: firstly, depreciating exchange rates have meant that capital inputs have become more expensive and could have forced the industry to "make do" with less capital inputs and secondly, the imposition of economic sanctions meant that it was difficult to purchase and import such capital goods. A process of sub-contracting out to small and medium concerns then occurred, some of whom could not afford to service or replace existing machinery and so turn to more labour-intensive methods of clothing production. Labour inputs in the production process did make a positive contribution: this was confirmed by labour having a positive output elasticity coefficient but the actual productivity of each individual worker has fallen. In other words the reason for the positive contribution was the addition of extra labour units to production and not by each worker contributing more to the production process. The final industry that was analysed was the mining and quarrying industry. The data illustrates that the real output level is falling, as is the number of persons employed in the sector. The unit labour costs have risen enormously which suggests that fewer workers are being paid more to produce less output. Added to this is the fact that more capital inputs are being used that ten years ago and the capital to labour ratio index has been steadily increasing further suggests that some units of labour input are being replaced by units of extra capital input. Using the data in table 5. 8 of the annual average growth rates, the average growth rate of the labour productivity index shows a negative pattern: in other words, labour is becoming less and less productive and consequently workers are being retrenched and more capital is being employed, even though the cost of utilising more capital in the industry is increasing the whole time...|$|E
40|$|Tese de doutoramento apresentada à Universidade de Brabant, TilburgIn {{the last}} two decades there has been a {{significant}} development of organizational culture theories inside organizational psychology, which have been largely divulged among managers who have adopted them in their everyday language. Inside those theories one concept occupies a "central role": the concept of value (v. g. Jones, 1983; Smircish, 1983; Schein, 1985). In this book we present a study looking for the role of values inside the organization empirically, Two main goals have guided this research: 1 	- The culture producing effect of organizations on values. Corporate culture models state that each organization and its management can induce its own specific organizational culture and consequently its own specific value systems. In this research, it is empirically tested if different enterprises are related with different value systems and if this relationship is stronger than the one established between value systems and Portuguese regions. 2 	- The effects of values on perceptions and emotional and behavioral outputs. Several theoretical ftameworks state that values influence the perceptions and the emotional and behavioral outputs of individuais. This statement is empirically tested in an organizational context. Reviewing the literature on values, from philosophy to economics, one can easily observe that different concepts are used in the different fields, which may lead to some difficulties in their study and several misunderstandings. Anyway, the anthropological conception of value (Kluckhohn, 1951) seems dominant in most of the works: its influence is capital in the whole of social and organizational psychology (e. g. Rokeach, 1973 and Schein, 1986). But although the anthropological conception is the broader framework and the common departure point for most psychologists, the latter, when building their theories and operationalizations, arrive at completely different conceptions and instruments. Among these conceptions, two typical ones are very often used: the one of Schein (1986), - "Values are what 'ought' or 'should' be" -, which is more connected with the concept of social norm generally used in social psychology; and the one of Kluckhohn (1951), - "Value is a conception of the desirable that influences the ways people select actíon and evaluate events" -, which is the conception generally adopted in social psychology (v. g. Rokeach, 1973, Howard et al. 1983, Schwartz and Bilsky, 1987). In this study we adopt the latter definition. Within the scope of this defínition it is possible to distinguish various levels of abstraction. Given our organizational interests, we look at two levels of values: a) General and abstract values, - what is desirable and important in people's life in a general way -; and b) Work related values, - what is desirable and important for people in work, these latter being conceived as a specific domain, í. e. an "area of behavior that is aimed at the same goal" (Vinson et ai. 1977 and Verhallen et ai. 1989). On the first level we adopt the Rokeach Model (Rokeach, 1973) and, on the second level, we have as reference the MOW Model (MOW, 1987). In order to accomplish the first goal of this study, we identified several possible antecedents of values on. both levels. Matching the corporate culture models with the comparative management models, our main interest is centered on the possible influences of enterprises and Portuguese regions on value systems. Beyond these possible effects, we also control personal characteristics, such as education, sex and age, which have been shown to influence values in previous studies (v. g. Rokeach, 1973, 1979; Feather, 1975; Buchhoiz, 1978; MOW, 1987) and the individual history inside the organízations, in regard to which we adopt several indices imported from socialization models (v. g. Van Maanen and Schein, 1979), such as career evolution, seniority, training and supervision. Ali the antecedents are treated on the same level of causality. 179 -CA As we intended to analyse the relationships between values and job/organizational perceptions and emotional and behavioral outputs (second goal), we constructed a heuristic model, where general values play a central cognitive role influencing work related values, job/organizational perceptions and individual outputs. These last ones are conceived as being also influenced by world values and organizational perceptions, Nevertheless, the model is conceived as a reciprocal causality one. In the absence of a global operationalized model of organizations, in this study the concepts and operationalizations used in the job/organizational perceptions and individual outputs are largely based on a revision oí the Hackman and Oldham Model (1980) about job design and on its further developments by Cammmann et al. (1983). In this context, we decided to distinguish between four general leveis of analysis within job/organizational perception: job and role characteristics, group perception, rewards perception and organizational perception. As individual outputs, we consider job. satisfaction, job involvement, organizational commitement and extra-hours at work. The relationships between job/organizational perceptions and individual outputs are conceived according to the postcognitive-nonreairsive model (v. g. Lazarus, 1982, 1984, James and Tetrick, 1986), i,e. even if reciprocally related job perceptions are the first cause of emotional answers, e,g. satisfaction. To attain our goals we decided to use a large survey. But before building it we conducted a pilot-study, based on 20 semi-directive interviews looking for specific values in Portugal and possible subjective impressions of change in value systems during the individual's organizational life. Data analysis showed that the general values brought up by the interviewees can be located in Rokeach's terminal and instrumental value systems, showing once again (see Rokeach 1973, 1979, Feather, 1975, Ng et al., 1982, Schwartz and Bilsky, 1987) the rather universal character of these systems. The analysis of the work related values, suggested by the Portuguese sample, showed that the majority of them can be placed in the work related value system proposed by the MOW Team (1987). However a new work related value appeared in a very significant way: To attain goals/results", suggesting a strong intrinsic work motivation in the Portuguese population, so that we included it in our scale. About value changes, there was a near consensus about their evolution during the period after the admission to the organization, white this evolution was attributed to friends and colleagues, Nevertheless, the individuais had some difficulties in indicating which values had become more or less important in that period. Once constructed, the survey was applied to two Portuguese enterprises (N = 452) with different activities and characteristics but each one with identical structures, procedures and jobs in the three Portuguese regions considered. With this design, we intended to control the effects of the enterprises on the values in contrast with the effects of the regions. Comparing the two enterprises, enterprise 1 (N = 195) is big, with a stable environment, consisting of blue and white collar workers and managed like a public service, while enterprise 2 (N = 257) is smaller, with a strong competitive environment, comprising only white collar workers and managed like a private company. In the latter there is less absenteeism, a higher productivity, a higher <b>average</b> <b>remuneration</b> and promotions based on individual appraisals (in El promotions are mainly based on automatisms). The three Portuguese regions include the most developed (Lisboa) {{and one of the most}} underdeveloped of Portugal (Évora). Given the large number of variables in our survey and to avoid too complex patterns difficult to interpret, we use principal component analysis on all logical groups of variables. Thus, with the general values we got five factors explaining 35 percent of the variance. The last four factors found show a strong convergence with the factors found in previous researches (Rokeach, 1973 and Howard et ai. 1983), which induced us to name them in the same way: competence -versus-morality, self-constriction -versus- self-expression, personal/emotional -versus- social oriented and delayed -versus- immediate gratification. Only factor 1 : non-conflict -versus- enlarger seems more specific to our sample, although the enlarger pole is quite similar to the one found by Howard et al. (1983) with American and Japanese managers. 180 In regard to work related values, 5 factors were identified, explaining 54 percent of the variance, with some similarities with the MOW Team findings (1987), but also with some specific differences. Nevertheless, we discovered that adopting the same kind of ranking/rating scale used by the MOW Team had not been a good choice: during collecting data some respondents showed some doubts about how to answer (which had not happened during the pre-test) and once the data plotting was done we got a distribution that could have been influenced by chance. After analysing the logical relationships between general and work related values the factor chance was excluded, but we are careful with the interpretations related to work related values. For principal component analysis, the job/organizational perceptions were grouped into 8 categories: job/role perceptions, work group functioning, supervision, reward systems, structure perception, procedures, norms and perception of the organization as a whole. For each new scale, reliabilities are offered. The same is done in regard to the scales of the individual outputs. In a first approach, we tested the differences in values between enterprises and between regions. From this analysis, it is possible to conclude that each enterprise is dominated by rather different general and work related values, while the three Portuguese regions have a small effect on values systems. While one of the enterprises is oriented to values such as: non-conflict, morality, social values and comfort; the other is oriented to: enlarger, competence, expressive characteristics of work and To attain goals/results". Apparently, each enterprise had generated its value systems, its own corporate culture. However, after we analysed all considered antecedents of value systems, we found that, at a general values level, the differences are mainly influenced by the personal characteristics (age, sex and education), Enterprise, region and individual organizational history have a weak influence on general values. On the other hand, at a work related values level, enterprise shows a constant and significant impact, by itself or associated with individual organizational history (e. g. seniority and training). Nevertheless, it is not possible to assume that this relationship results from a socializing process. The variables used as indices of socialization (promotion, training and seniority) appear mainly related with development/utility work related values (serve society, to attain goals/results and learn new things). In the enterprise managed like a public service, comfort and economic rewards are preferred, while, in comparison, development/utility are preferred in the enterprise managed like a private company. Thus, our data tend to confirm the enduring character of general values foreseen by Rokeach (1973), i. e. the individuals tend to keep their own values towards life, independently of the type of organization where they work (further research is needed with more and different kinds of organization). However, work related values, being more concrete and a specific domain connected with organizational activities, are influenced a great deal by different enterprises. Because the data happened to be available, we also analysed in an exploratory sense the antecedents on job/organizational perceptions mentioned before. Among the personal characteristics: education confirms the strong impact on those perceptions, inducing, when present, a systematic negative effect; while age shows a positive effect and sex shows weak or absent relationships. Among individual organizational history: seniority is only present in the regression equations when age is also present, which is certainly related with the strong correlation between them (. 88), nevertheless, while age produces a positive effect, seniority shows a systematic negative effect; training does not appear very related with organizational perception, however when present it shows a positive relationship, in opposition to education; promotion has only expected relationships with rewards perception. When considered on its own, supervision has quite a reduced relationship with organizational perception, nevertheless when in interaction with individual organizational history the number of relationships increase significantly. The effects of enterprise on job/organizational perceptions were rather expected according to enterprise characteristics. But the same did not happen with region. It shows quite an influence on perceptions. 181 where some of these influences produced by the Porto region are unexpected according to region and enterprise characteristics. Employees from both enterprises in Porto, which in public opinion is regarded as the "capital of work", are, for instance, more demanding towards the supportive and production orientation of their supervisors. As the Porto region is not related with specific values, the effects on perceptions seem to have to be interpreted in a cultural framework related with social norms. More research is needed to explain these specificities of Porto culture. The relationships found between general and work related values confirm theoretical expectations (Rokeach, 1973 and Vinson et al. 1977) and empirical data from the field of consumer psychology (Verhallen et ai., 1989) : general and specific domain values are logically and consistently related but not in a one-to-one correspondance. For instance, while morality general values are related with comfort work related values, competence general values are connected with expressive characteristics, economic rewards and development/utility work related values. General and work related values do not establish strong relationships with job/organizational perceptions. Nevertheless, the latter are not independent from values. As theoretically expected (James and Jones, 1989), these relationships tend to improve from descriptive perceptions to evaluative ones. General values found more related with organizational perceptions are: self-expansion -vs- self-constriction and morality -vs- competence. Work related values found more related with organizational perceptions are: comfort I (environmental) and economic rewards. General and work related values show moderate relationships with individual organizational outputs, where those that are established with affective outputs are stronger than those established with the declared behavioral output. Morality, self-constriction and social oriented employees systematically show a more positive reaction towards the job and the organization. Enlarger oriented employees are more organizational committed and give more extra-time to the enterprise. Among work related values, development/utility values have a positive relationship with job involvement, organizational commitment and extra-time; while economic rewards and comfort II show negative relationships with job involvement and organizational commitment. Probably, as a result of the scale used work related values are less related with individual outputs than general values. As theoretically expected, job and organizational perceptions are better able to explain the variance of job satisfaction, job involvement, organizational commitment and extra-time at work than values. And also as expected organizational levels nearer everyday life of the employees have more impact on individual outputs: job perception, group functioning perceptions and reward systems. Our results about the effects of enterprise on general and work related values indicate that to use the concept of value, in its more traditional sense in Social Sciences - as "a conception of the desirable" -, can not be done so arbitrarily and simply as is generally done. General values do not seem quite influence by enterprise (at least bureaucratic ones) and, thus, they can not be included in the framework of corporate culture. On the other hand, work related values are influenced by enterprise, i. e. they can be considered a dimension of corporate culture, but they are conditioned by the "enduring" general values which, in this way, put limits to some developments of corporate culture. Le. the enterprise seems to be able to influence employees values related to its activities if they fit in general values but it cannot manipulate their values towards general life. Managers ignoring this statement can be very disappointed with their cultural management...|$|E
40|$|The {{main goal}} of this project was to propose {{appropriate}} methods of analysing {{the effects of the}} privatisation of state-owned enterprises, methods which were then tested on a limited sample of 16 Polish and 8 German enterprises privatised in 1992. A considerable amount of information was collected relating to the six-year period 1989 - 1994 relating to most aspects of the companies' activities. The effects of privatisation were taken to be those changes within the enterprises which were the result of privatisation, in such areas as production, the productivity of labour and fixed assets, investments and innovations, employment and wages, economic incentives (especially for top managers), financing (internal and external sources), bad debts and economic effects (financial analysis). A second important goal was to identify the main factors which represent methodological obstacles in surveys of the effects of privatisation during a period of fundamental transformation of the entire economic system. The list of enterprises for the research was compiled {{in such a way as}} to allow for the differentiation of ownership structures of privatised firms and to permit (at least to a certain extent) the empirical verification of some hypotheses regarding the privatisation process. The enterprises selected were divided into the following three groups representing (as far as possible) various types of ownership structures or types of control: (1) enterprises control by strategic investors (domestic or foreign), (2) enterprises controlled by employees (employee-owned companies), (3) enterprises controlled by managers. Formal methods such as econometric models with varying parameters were used to separate pure privatisation effects from other factors which influence various aspects of an enterprise's working, including policies on the productivity of labour and capital, <b>average</b> wages, the <b>remuneration</b> of top managers, etc. While the group admits that their findings and conclusions cannot be treated as representative of all privatised enterprises in Poland and Germany, they found considerable convergence with their findings and those of other surveys conducted on a wider scale. The main hypotheses that were confirmed included that privatisation (especially in companies controlled by large investors and managers) leads to a significant increase in the effectiveness of these production process, growing pay differentials between different employee groups (e. g. between executives and rank-and-file employees) and between different jobs and positions within particular professional groups. They also confirmed the growing importance in incentives to top executives of incentives linked with the company's economic effects (particularly profit-related incentives), long-term incentives and the capital market...|$|R

40|$|In {{the paper}} Latvian {{construction}} industry is comprehensively evaluated and {{compared with the}} Baltic States and the European Union. Industry resources and it costs are analyzed by group: natural resources, production of building materials, fixed assets and attraction of money capital, personnel costs. Possibilities to obtain profit while working in construction were analyzed. Basing on the analysis, suggestions for improvements in the industry activities are elaborated. Nature factor {{is one of the}} most important factors, which substantially influences on construction industry development. Nature factor (resource) costs do not decrease, because the largest part of the natural resources is nonrenewable. Comparing Latvian data with the average EU data and median, it is evident that in Latvia there are cheapest materials, which ask the minimum treatment, and are accessible in the country (sand, wood). Materials, for which industrial machines are necessary (blocks, tiles), have higher prices in Latvia than in the EU. Comparing Latvian data with the other Baltic states, it is evident that in other Baltic states main construction materials are substantially cheaper. It is connected with low development of production of construction materials in Latvia. Industry of construction materials depends from import deliveries; as a result, prices are high. Small market volumes do not allow returning invested means in the case of new factory; it is more profitable to transport construction materials in region. Investment volume in Latvian construction industry grew rapidly from 2002 almost doubling every second year. Investment per employed in construction in Latvia is larger than in France, Germany and the EU, but smaller than in Finland, Sweden and UK. In the Baltic states and in Latvia in particular capital investment increase is connected not only with increase of construction volumes, but also with changes in construction process and increase of mechanization level. Also market demand changes played their part. Before 2000 largest part of construction (near 70 %) was repair, which is done without expensive mechanisms and machines, however since then multistory buildings construction increased, which demands large capital investments in fixed assets. Also in the Baltic region increase in mechanization level is connected with the increase of wages. In the Euro area money resources are 40 - 100 % cheaper than in other states. In Latvia, as compared with the other Baltic states, interest rates are higher by 1. 2 percent points on average and by 1. 8 percent points cheaper then the EU average. It means that in the other Baltic states current assets are cheaper by 25 %, but in the EU by 47 % on average. But even with expensive money resources, on UK example shown, UK construction industry is excellently developed and competitive. Unfortunately one example is not enough to make a conclusion, that industry can be successful despite of interest rates. The reason can be the large scale of construction industry in the UK. With the conditions little Baltic states could not survive. During six years number of employees in construction in Latvia has almost doubled, and similar situation is in the other Baltic states. So rapid increase of employees in construction can be connected with minimal starting point and with boom circumstances. Data dynamics of 2001 - 2005 show that in Latvia the number of employees rose more rapidly than in developed countries. In 2005 - 2007 there was the boom increase in the Baltic states. Share of employees in construction industry has been defined, it is 9 %. In boom time this limitation didn’t work. For low skilled construction works it is always possible to find workers, paying appropriate wages. In developed countries (Finland, UK) average wages in construction are by 30 - 55 % lower than the average wage in the country. Situation is opposite in Latvia, and in the Baltic states, where wages in construction are 4 - 10 % higher. Value added in construction, which can be seen as a productivity indicator, in Latvia, and in the Baltic states, is about 3 times lower then the average EU level. Workers in Latvia work ineffective, it is possible to raise their productivity at least 3 times. Despite low productivity of Latvian workers, their efficiency is the largest in the EU. Profitability in construction industry in Latvia is between four EU leaders: Poland, UK, Greece, and Latvia. Increase of profit is visible both in the EU and in separate countries. The stable gross profitability level in construction is on average 12 %, which is similar in other industries. Its means that the industry provides stable <b>average</b> entrepreneurship factor <b>remuneration</b> for entrepreneurs working in the industry. ...|$|R
