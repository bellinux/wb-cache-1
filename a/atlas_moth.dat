5|$|The {{external}} morphology of Lepidoptera is {{the physiological}} {{structure of the}} bodies of insects belonging to the order Lepidoptera, also known as butterflies and moths. Lepidoptera are distinguished from other orders {{by the presence of}} scales on the external parts of the body and appendages, especially the wings. Butterflies and moths vary in size from microlepidoptera only a few millimetres long, to a wingspan of many inches such as the <b>Atlas</b> <b>moth.</b> Comprising over 160,000 described species, the Lepidoptera possess variations of the basic body structure which has evolved to gain advantages in adaptation and distribution.|$|E
500|$|Insects are {{the only}} group of {{invertebrates}} to have developed flight. The evolution of insect wings has been a subject of debate. Some entomologists suggest that the wings are from paranotal lobes, or extensions from the insect's exoskeleton called the nota, called the paranotal theory. Other theories {{are based on a}} pleural origin. These theories include suggestions that wings originated from modified gills, spiracular flaps or as from an appendage of the epicoxa. The epicoxal theory suggests the insect wings are modified epicoxal exites, a modified appendage {{at the base of the}} legs or coxa. In the Carboniferous age, some of the Meganeura dragonflies had as much as a [...] wide wingspan. The appearance of gigantic insects has been found to be consistent with high atmospheric oxygen. The respiratory system of insects constrains their size, however the high oxygen in the atmosphere allowed larger sizes. The largest flying insects today are much smaller and include several moth species such as the <b>Atlas</b> <b>moth</b> and the white witch (Thysania agrippina).|$|E
50|$|Adult <b>Atlas</b> <b>moths</b> do {{not have}} mouths, and as such only live for a few days.|$|R
50|$|<b>Atlas</b> <b>moths</b> {{were often}} {{considered}} the largest moths {{in the world}} in terms of total wing surface area, but recent sources confer this title upon the Hercules Moth from New Guinea and northern Australia. Their wingspans are also among the largest, reaching over 25 cm. Females are appreciably larger and heavier than the males.|$|R
5000|$|The Butterfly House {{is made up}} of an {{undercover}} walk-through in a sustainably-heated, climate-controlled polytunnel. http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/bristol/7308608.stm [...] Species on show include the blue morpho butterflies, glasswings, leopard lacewings and <b>atlas</b> <b>moths.</b> The exhibit is linked to butterfly projects run by the zoo in Kenya and Costa Rica. The zoo also supports work to protect the rare silky wave moth in Avon Gorge.|$|R
2500|$|Adults are {{characterized}} by large size, heavy bodies covered in hair-like scales, lobed wings, reduced mouthparts, and small heads. They lack a frenulum but the hind wings overlap the forewings, producing the same effect of an unbroken wing surface. These moths are sometimes brightly colored and often have translucent eyespots or [...] "windows" [...] on their wings. [...] Sexual dimorphism varies by species, but males can generally be distinguished by their larger, broader antennae. Most adults possess wing spans between 1 and 6in (2.5 and 15cm), but some tropical species, such as the <b>Atlas</b> <b>moth</b> (Attacus atlas), may have wing spans up to 12in (30cm). Together with certain Noctuidae (chiefly Calpinae and Catocalinae, such as the genera Ascalapha, Erebus, or Thysania), the Saturniidae contain the largest Lepidoptera, {{and some of the}} largest insects alive today.|$|E
60|$|Reptiles are as {{abundant}} as in Africa, {{but they}} present no well-known groups {{which can be}} considered as specially characteristic. Among insects we may notice the {46} magnificent golden and green Papilionidæ of various genera as being unequalled in the world; while the great <b>Atlas</b> <b>moth</b> is probably the most gigantic of Lepidoptera, being sometimes ten inches across the wings, which are also very broad. Among the beetles the strange flat-bodied Malayan mormolyce is the largest of all the Carabidæ, while the catoxantha is equally a giant among the Buprestidæ. On the whole, the insects of this region probably surpass those of any other part of the world, except South America, in size, variety, and beauty.|$|E

50|$|Females {{are sexually}} passive, {{releasing}} powerful pheromones which males detect and {{home in on}} {{with the help of}} chemoreceptors located on their large feathery antennae. Males may thus be attracted from several kilometres downwind. <b>Atlas</b> <b>moths</b> are unsteady fliers, and the female does not stray far from the location of her discarded chrysalis: she seeks a perch where the air currents will best carry her pheromones.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Atlas</b> <b>moths</b> {{are said}} to be named after either the Titan of Greek mythology, or their map-like wing patterns.

25|$|A deimatic {{displays}} is {{a pattern}} of threatening or startling behaviour, such as suddenly displaying conspicuous eyespots, used to scare off or momentarily distract a predator, thus giving the prey animal an opportunity to escape. For example, some moths look threatening while at rest by displaying a sinister lurking face, {{such as those of}} genus Speiredonia, or the more aggressive face of a snake poised to attack, such as many species of genus Spirama. Adult <b>Atlas</b> <b>moths</b> of the genera Attacus and Rothschildia also display snake heads. The eyed hawkmoth displays its large eyespots on its wings and moves them slowly {{as if it were a}} vertebrate predator such as an owl.|$|R

40|$|We use {{the moth}} Heliothis virescens as model {{organism}} {{for studying the}} neural network involved in chemosensory coding and learning. The constituent neurons are characterised by intracellular recordings combined with staining, resulting in a single neuron identified in each brain preparation. In order to spatially relate the neurons of different preparations a common brain framework was required. We here present an average shaped <b>atlas</b> of the <b>moth</b> brain. It is based on 11 female brain preparations, each stained with a fluorescent synaptic marker and scanned in confocal laser-scanning microscope. Brain neuropils of each preparation were manually reconstructed in the computer software Amira, followed by generating the atlas using the Iterative Shape Average Procedure. To demonstrate {{the application of the}} atlas we have registered two olfactory and two gustatory interneurons, as well as the axonal projections of gustatory receptor neurons into the atlas, visualising their spatial relationships. The olfactory interneurons, showing the typical morphology of inner-tract antennal lobe projection neurons, projected in the calyces of the mushroom body and laterally in the protocerebral lobe. The two gustatory interneurons, responding to sucrose and quinine respectively, projected in different areas of the brain. The wide projections of the quinine responding neuron included a lateral area adjacent to the projections of the olfactory interneurons. The sucrose responding neuron was confined to the suboesophageal ganglion with dendritic arborisations overlapping the axonal projections of the gustatory receptor neurons on the proboscis. By serving as a tool for the integration of neurons, the atlas offers visual access to the spatial relationship between the neurons in three dimensions, and thus facilitates the study of neuronal networks in the Heliothis virescens brain.
