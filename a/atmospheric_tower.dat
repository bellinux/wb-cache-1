The facility {{is one of the most}} modern refineries in the United States and, with crude oil processing capacity of 495, 000 barrels per day (BPD), is one of the largest in the world. The latest round of MPC retesting at the refinery was completed in an automated fashion, stepping multiple independent variables simultaneously while the MPC controller was in service. The crude # 6 MPC application has 34 MVs and 90 CVs covering two furnaces, an <b>atmospheric</b> <b>tower</b> and a naphtha stabilizer. During the plant test, an existing MPC controller is online and active in stabilizing the operation while the test program moved all the 33 MVs simultaneously.

40|$|The {{objective}} of {{the study reported here}} was {{to determine the effects of}} consistency, temperature, caustic addition rate and reaction time on the level of delignification for softwood brownstock pulp produced at Jay. Performance of Current System Analysis of mill process data suggests that the current oxygen delignification system at Jay achieves approximately a 25 to 27 % reduction in kappa number. The pulp leaving the oxygen system typically has an intrinsic viscosity of about 1100 cc/gram and corresponds to a TAPPI viscosity of about 39 centipoises, which is quite high. Samples taken of the pulp going to the oxygen reactor indicate that the alkali concentration going to the reactor is about 3 grams per liter and approximately 100 Kg per metric ton of COD and 200 Kg per metric ton of Color are carried over from the brown stock washers. Based upon the experimental results it was concluded that approximately half of the alkali in the pulp going to the pressurized oxygen reactor currently comes from the alkali in the carryover from the brownstock washers. The laboratory results further suggest that approximately 65 % of the delignification that is taking place in the oxygen delignification process in the mill takes place in the 15 minute pressurized reactor and the piping prior to the reactor; while about 35 % of the drop in kappa number takes place in the <b>atmospheric</b> <b>tower.</b> Important Process Variables Controlling Delignification Important process variables controlling the level of oxygen delignification, in their order of importance, are the reaction temperature, alkali concentration and oxygen pressure. Of the variables investigated experimentally, raising the temperature in the reactor is the most important variable driving the reaction. High pressure is desirable because it reduces the volume of gas that must be mixed into the pulp by the high shear mixer. The alkali concentration going to the reactor is determined by the carry over of alkali, the pulp consistency and the alkali being added to the reactor...|$|E
