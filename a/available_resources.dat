5|$|A {{population}} ecology concept is r/K selection theory, {{one of the}} first predictive models in ecology used to explain life-history evolution. The premise behind the r/K selection model is that natural selection pressures change according to population density. For example, when an island is first colonized, density of individuals is low. The initial increase in population size is not limited by competition, leaving an abundance of <b>available</b> <b>resources</b> for rapid population growth. These early phases of population growth experience density-independent forces of natural selection, which is called r-selection. As the population becomes more crowded, it approaches the island's carrying capacity, thus forcing individuals to compete more heavily for fewer <b>available</b> <b>resources.</b> Under crowded conditions, the population experiences density-dependent forces of natural selection, called K-selection.|$|E
5|$|Any {{point that}} lies {{either on the}} {{production}} possibilities curve or {{to the left of}} it is said to be an attainable point: it can be produced with currently <b>available</b> <b>resources.</b> Points that lie {{to the right of the}} production possibilities curve are said to be unattainable because they cannot be produced using currently <b>available</b> <b>resources.</b> Points that lie strictly to the left of the curve are said to be inefficient, because existing resources would allow for production of more of at least one good without sacrificing the production of any other good. An efficient point is one that lies on the production possibilities curve. At any such point, more of one good can be produced only by producing less of the other.|$|E

5|$|Operation Dragoon (initially Operation Anvil) was {{the code}} {{name for the}} Allied {{invasion}} of Southern France on 15August 1944. The operation was initially planned to be executed in conjunction with Operation Overlord, the Allied landing in the Normandy, {{but the lack of}} <b>available</b> <b>resources</b> led to a cancellation of the second landing. By July 1944 the landing was reconsidered, as the clogged-up ports in Normandy did not have the capacity to adequately supply the Allied forces. Concurrently, the French High Command pushed for a revival of the operation that would include large numbers of French troops. As a result, the operation was finally approved in July to be executed in August.|$|E
5|$|The {{ability to}} plan and strategize, much like {{abstract}} thinking, {{can be seen in}} the more diversified toolkit of the Middle Stone Age, as well as in the subsistence patterns of the period. As MSA hominins began to migrate into a range of different ecological zones, it became necessary to base hunting strategies around seasonally <b>available</b> <b>resources.</b> Awareness of seasonality is evident in the faunal remains found at temporary sites. In less forgiving ecological zones, this awareness would have been essential for survival and the {{ability to plan}} subsistence strategies based on this awareness demonstrates an ability to think beyond the present tense and act upon this knowledge.|$|E

5|$|The {{growth rate}} hypothesis, {{also known as}} the {{resource}} availability hypothesis, states that defense strategies are determined by the inherent growth rate of the plant, which is in turn determined by the resources available to the plant. A major assumption is that <b>available</b> <b>resources</b> are the limiting factor in determining the maximum growth rate of a plant species. This model predicts that the level of defense investment will increase as the potential of growth decreases. Additionally, plants in resource-poor areas, with inherently slow-growth rates, tend to have long-lived leaves and twigs, and the loss of plant appendages may result in a loss of scarce and valuable nutrients.|$|E
5|$|While Kublai {{attended}} to other {{matters in the}} north, the Song court was mobilizing its populace for war and all <b>available</b> <b>resources</b> that could be rendered and drained into the war effort. In the mid 13th century, the Song government led by Jia Sidao began confiscating portions of estates owned by the rich {{in order to raise}} revenues in a land nationalization scheme. This had the negative effect of alienating the wealthy landowners and hastening the collapse of the empire, as wealthy landlords and merchants favored what they deemed the inevitable Mongol conquest and rule than the other alternative of paying higher taxes for continual, exhaustive warfare.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the same}} point as Hooker's approach, Hawker had been working upon the {{development}} of a replacement fighter aircraft for the Hawker Hunter, designated as the P.1121. However, the P.1121 was cancelled shortly after the publishing of the 1957 Defence White Paper, which had advocated a policy shift away from manned aircraft and towards missiles. In light of this cancellation, Hawker found itself with the <b>available</b> <b>resources</b> to commit to a new project, and thus decided to study the use of the projected Pegasus engine as a basis for a new military aeroplane that would be able to conform with an active NATO specification that sought a new Light Tactical Support Fighter to replace the Fiat G.91, particular attention was paid to meeting the specification's performance and load requirements.|$|E

5|$|By {{about two}} days after the passage of Hurricane Wilma, 800residents on Grand Bahama {{remained}} in shelters, including 65 families who lost their homes and stayed in a hotel set up as a government shelter in Freeport. On Bimini, most residents who evacuated to shelters returned to their homes within two days of the hurricane. The Bahamian Red Cross quickly assessed the damage on Grand Bahama and Bimini, and successfully requested to be included under the federation's hurricane appeal for Central America. Local Red Cross chapters mobilized all <b>available</b> <b>resources</b> to assist the residents most affected. The Bahamian Red Cross began a three-month program to distribute food and other items to 1,000 of the 3,500affected families, primarily on Grand Bahama; the remaining 2,500families received assistance from the government and other organizations. Volunteers delivered building materials and provided water vouchers to those affected. In Nassau, the Red Cross disaster contingency stock sent a boat with food items, blankets, health kits, tarpaulins and water. About a week after the hurricane, the United States Agency for International Development began providing $50,000 (2005USD) to the Bahamian National Emergency Management Agency for the purchase and distribution of emergency supplies. The agency also provided $9,000 (2005USD) for locally contracted helicopter assessments in the affected areas. Red Cross agencies throughout the Caribbean Sea provided hygienic kits, plastic sheeting, blankets, and jerry cans.|$|E

5|$|In {{the greater}} St. Petersburg, Pinellas County, area alone, 320,000 people {{evacuated}} {{ahead of the}} storm in what was a national record for the largest evacuation of a single county in history. The large number of refugees from the storm put a strain on facilities, highways, and contingencies. Although {{the number of people}} required to leave far exceeded the capacity of Pinellas County shelters, only 120,000 of the 300,000 or more refugees made use of the shelters. Still, official shelter usage was considered to be higher than average, possibly due to shortened lead times limiting the ability of individuals to make arrangements with friends and relatives, or increased awareness of <b>available</b> <b>resources.</b> Post-storm phone surveys indicated that evacuation order compliance rates were as high as 90% in Pinellas County, and the entire evacuation there took just 9 hours, rather than the expected 15. With over 200,000 individuals recorded to be in more than 120 shelters along the coast of west-central Florida, evacuees became restless {{as a result of the}} duration of the storm. Supplies such as food ran short, and many people ignored orders and tried to return home prematurely. The threat of Hurricane Elena also triggered an unprecedented mass transfer of medical and nursing home patients. Tampa General Hospital, at 84% of patient capacity, was evacuated; four more hospitals and around 19 nursing homes in Pinellas County were also cleared. Overall, nearly 2,000 nursing home patients were transported to safety. Although successful, the process encountered issues such as time constraints and staffing shortages.|$|E
5|$|The Maya {{built their}} cities with Neolithic technology; they built their {{structures}} from both perishable materials and from stone. The exact type of stone used in masonry construction varied according to locally <b>available</b> <b>resources,</b> and this also affected the building style. Across a broad swathe of the Maya area, limestone was immediately available. The local limestone is relatively soft when freshly cut, but hardens with exposure. There was great variety {{in the quality}} of limestone, with good-quality stone available in the Usumacinta region; in the northern Yucatán, the limestone used in construction was of relatively poor quality. Volcanic tuff was used at Copán, and nearby Quiriguá employed sandstone. In Comalcalco, where suitable stone was not available locally, fired bricks were employed. Limestone was burned at high temperatures in order to manufacture cement, plaster, and stucco. Lime-based cement was used to seal stonework in place, and stone blocks were fashioned using rope-and-water abrasion, and with obsidian tools. The Maya did not employ a functional wheel, so all loads were transported on litters, barges, or rolled on logs. Heavy loads were lifted with rope, but probably without employing pulleys.|$|E

The <b>available</b> <b>resource</b> capacities on PlanetLab nodes can fluctuate significantly in a short time, and a node selected to execute a task may become unsuitable for it within a short time ranging from a few minutes to an hour. One way to overcome this problem is relocate the task to another node. This requires identifying the set of nodes that are mostly likely to meet the requirements of the task for a long duration. For this purpose we have developed a system for monitoring a collection of nodes for their <b>available</b> <b>resource</b> capacities. Using this system we have conducted a study to characterize the distribution of the number of nodes that meet a given resource capacity requirement, and the distribution of the duration for which a node satisfies the requirement. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{additive}} increase multiplicative decrease (AIMD) algorithm, that {{is commonly}} used for congestion avoidance in communication networks, has recently been suggested in other fields such as load management in electric power networks. As for congestion avoidance, in such systems {{a large number of}} agents are required to share a given resource. In recent work by Shorten, Wirth and Leith on congestion control in networking a stochastic model has been developed to analyse AIMD algorithms. However, the analysis assumes a continuous implementation of the algorithm and a constant <b>available</b> <b>resource.</b> These assumptions are no longer useful if the AIMD algorithm is applied in fields such as load management in electric power networks, where a discrete implementation is often required, and the <b>available</b> <b>resource</b> shared may be inherently variable. In this paper we develop a disturbed AIMD model based on the model introduced by Shorten et al. that includes discrete time implementation and time varying resource availability. Further, we use that model to bound the influence of these disturbances, caused by either a discrete implementation or small variations in the <b>available</b> <b>resource...</b>|$|R

The forest has wildland fire engines, pumps, hand tools and fire hose at its disposal. A helicopter can be summoned quickly, along with support from the South Central Idaho Interagency Dispatch Center, including a team of smokejumpers and air tankers used to provide air support in dropping flame retardant and water.

5|$|The size {{of these}} castles varied {{depending}} on the geography of the site, {{the decisions of the}} builder and the <b>available</b> <b>resources.</b> Analysis of the size of mottes has shown some distinctive regional variation; East Anglia, for example, saw much larger mottes being built than the Midlands or London. While motte-and-bailey and ringwork castles took great effort to build, they required relatively few skilled craftsmen allowing them to be raised using forced labour from the local estates; this, in addition to the speed with which they could be built – a single season, made them particularly attractive immediately after the conquest. The larger earthworks, particularly mottes, required an exponentially greater quantity of manpower than their smaller equivalents and consequently tended to be either royal, or belong to the most powerful barons who could muster the required construction effort. Despite motte-and-bailey and ringworks being common designs amongst Norman castles, each fortification was slightly different – some castles were designed with two baileys attached to a single motte, and some ringworks were built with additional towers added on; yet other castles were built as ringworks and later converted to motte-and-bailey structures.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we present {{mechanisms}} and models for building autonomically scalable and resilient services in wide-area shared computing environments. Wide-area shared computing platforms {{as exemplified by}} PlanetLab provide a cooperatively shared pool of computing resources. Building services in such environments poses unique challenges due to the fluctuations in <b>available</b> <b>resource</b> capacities and node availability. Autonomic mechanisms for building scalable and resilient services in such environments need to appropriately scale the service capacity under fluctuating <b>available</b> <b>resource</b> capacities, node crashes, and fluctuations in client load. Towards addressing these issues, we have developed models and mechanisms for estimating the service capacity under varying <b>available</b> <b>resource</b> capacities through online micro-benchmarking. The mechanisms for autonomic scaling of service capacity perform dynamic replication and regeneration of service replicas based on the estimated service capacity and observed load. This requires selection of appropriate nodes for the placement of new replicas. Furthermore due to the fluctuations in resource capacities, the load distribution for such services need {{to adapt to the}} varying service capacities of the individual service replicas. For this purpose we develop mechanisms for adaptive load distribution. We present here the evaluation of these mechanisms through experiments conducted over the PlanetLab environment...|$|R

In that technique, {{it is assumed}} that the nodes cycle has three states such as noncritical section (NCS), entry section (ES) and critical section (CS). During deployment, the node is in NCS state, and after receiving the unique tokens, it enters into CS state. The scheduler sends the resource request message in different queues using fuzzy-based flow prioritization technique. If the <b>available</b> <b>resource</b> exceeds the required resource, the scheduler allocates the inelastic service similar to the <b>available</b> <b>resource</b> until the inelastic queue gets empty. Then the token is passed to the queue that contains elastic service flows. Based on simulation results, the proposed approach allocates the resources efficiently.|$|R
