5|$|The {{entrance}} of William Bullitt into Louise Bryant's life confounds the intertwined {{stories of the}} grief-stricken war widow, the radical heroine, and the champion of the oppressed.

5|$|ACC teams viewed a {{berth in}} the Humanitarian Bowl as {{undesirable}} due to its location. Aside from {{being one of the}} lower priority tie-ins, the destination is far outside the conference's geographic footprint. Travel costs from the East Coast are prohibitively expensive <b>and</b> <b>historically</b> caused low turnout among ACC fans. In addition, the game is hosted at a cold-weather venue, which is a disadvantage in comparison with ACC bowl games in places such as Florida, California, and Georgia.|$|E

5|$|During the Middle Ages, Capetian Kings of France {{chose to}} have their heirs {{apparent}} crowned during their own lifetime {{in order to avoid}} succession disputes. This practice was later adopted by Angevin Kings of England, Kings of Hungary and other European monarchs. From the moment of their coronation, the heirs were regarded as junior kings (rex iunior), but they exercised little power <b>and</b> <b>historically</b> {{were not included in the}} numbering of monarchs if they predeceased their fathers. The nobility disliked this custom, as it reduced their chances to benefit from a possible succession dispute.|$|E
5|$|Extensive {{work was}} put into {{creating}} a genuine <b>and</b> <b>historically</b> correct atmosphere for the film.

5|$|Languages express meaning by {{relating}} a sign form to a meaning, or its content. Sign forms must {{be something}} that can be perceived, for example, in sounds, images, or gestures, and then related to a specific meaning by social convention. Because the basic relation of meaning for most linguistic signs is based on social convention, linguistic signs can be considered arbitrary, {{in the sense that the}} convention is established socially <b>and</b> <b>historically,</b> rather than by means of a natural relation between a specific sign form and its meaning.|$|E

5|$|Stereotypical <b>and</b> <b>historically</b> {{inaccurate}} {{images of}} Indians in general interfere with learning about them by creating, supporting and maintaining oversimplified and inaccurate views {{of indigenous peoples}} and their cultures. When stereotypical representations are taken as factual information, they {{contribute to the development}} of cultural biases and prejudices, (clearly a contradiction to the educational mission of the University.) In the same vein, we believe that continuation of the use of Indians as symbols and mascots is incongruous with the philosophy espoused by many Americans as promoting inclusivity and diversity.|$|E
