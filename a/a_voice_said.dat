500|$|The {{video was}} {{directed}} by James Foley, who worked with Madonna in her music video for [...] "Live to Tell", produced by David Naylor and Sharon Oreck, and Michael Ballhaus {{was in charge of}} the photography. The video was shot on location over three days in Staten Island, New York and Manhattan. Staten Island was chosen on Foley's suggestion as it was where he grew up: [...] "We talked about wanting to tap into a working-class environment, because by that time she had done 'Material Girl' and 'Like a Virgin' and other stuff that was very glamorous and stylized. She wanted to do something a bit more grounded and 'drama'." [...] Actor Alex McArthur was signed to play Madonna's boyfriend and the father of her child in the video. Madonna had spotted McArthur in a small role as a naive youth in the 1985 film Desert Hearts, and she thought he was a natural to play her mechanic boyfriend. [...] "I was out in the garage working on my Harley," [...] said McArthur, [...] "I answered the phone and <b>a</b> <b>voice</b> <b>said,</b> 'Hi, this is Madonna. I would like you to be in my next video.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Entirely my opinion, Miss Beverley," [...] <b>a</b> <b>voice</b> <b>said</b> in her ear. [...] "I find it most depressing--and unhealthy. And listen.--Do {{you hear}} that?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Overcome with gratitude, {{the keeper}} stooped to caress the strange {{creature}} which had done him {{such a great}} service; but suddenly <b>a</b> <b>voice</b> <b>said</b> in his ear: ...|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Kingdom in <b>a</b> {{freezing}} <b>voice</b> <b>said</b> {{that she}} had not noticed it.|$|R
6000|$|Marty now alighted; {{the lamp}} again shone upon her, {{and as the}} {{carriage}} rolled on, <b>a</b> soft <b>voice</b> <b>said</b> {{to her from the}} interior, [...] "Good-night." ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{could not}} see her rescuer, for the hall into which he had hastily dragged her was only dimly lighted. But <b>a</b> {{peremptory}} <b>voice</b> <b>said</b> quickly: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hurrah, Jack! I {{was afraid}} that they had done for you," [...] <b>a</b> <b>voice</b> <b>said,</b> and he saw Tucker and Hill sitting propped up against a wall.|$|E
6000|$|... "We'll {{take the}} chances willing," [...] <b>a</b> <b>voice</b> <b>said,</b> {{and there was}} a grim chorus of approval. [...] "We've borne enough, and it's time we did something." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, here's the doctor, now," [...] <b>a</b> <b>voice</b> <b>said</b> {{behind them}} where they stood by the garden wall, and they turned to confront Gerald with his daughter.|$|E
6000|$|Then <b>a</b> low <b>voice</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "I arrest you, in {{the name}} of the queen, for being {{concerned}} in the robbery of the Portsmouth coach at Dorking." ...|$|R
6000|$|The cries died away, and {{the long}} heaving sobs began to subside, and at last <b>a</b> broken <b>voice</b> <b>said,</b> on Aunt Jane's shoulder, 'It's---a--- little bit---like mamma.' ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{turned slowly}} {{on the other}} side, and tried to {{continue}} his repose, but another shake disturbed him, and <b>a</b> deep <b>voice</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "Awake; arise, sleepy one." ...|$|R
6000|$|Then {{he heard}} a ring of metal in front of him, and <b>a</b> <b>voice</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "Qui vive!" [...] while another voice said, [...] "Is that you, Sam?" ...|$|E
6000|$|A {{moment later}} she {{became aware that}} the stoep was {{swarming}} with men who seemed to arise out of the shadows. <b>A</b> <b>voice</b> <b>said</b> in the Kaffir tongue: ...|$|E
6000|$|Humpty {{sat down}} upon the grass and wept grievously, {{for the death of}} his {{companion}} was a great blow to him. And while he sobbed, <b>a</b> <b>voice</b> <b>said</b> to him, ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{same instant}} a small twig and flower from the creeper {{outside the door}} flew in at the open window, and <b>a</b> {{masculine}} <b>voice</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "Ready, Fancy dearest?" ...|$|R
6000|$|In {{a moment}} more {{she heard her}} own name called. An {{interval}} of another instant passed, and <b>a</b> familiar <b>voice</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "I know where she is. I'll fetch her." ...|$|R
6000|$|They {{crossed the}} ferry {{and reached the}} {{outposts}} at last, and Stead was much startled when {{the barrel of a}} musquet gleamed in the moonlight, and <b>a</b> gruff <b>voice</b> <b>said</b> [...] "Stand." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{figured we}} needn't trail quite so much grub along, and I guess you'll want it," [...] <b>a</b> <b>voice</b> <b>said.</b> [...] "Neither of {{you changed your}} minds 'bout {{lighting}} out of this?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... - The sky became {{overcast}} {{without any}} notice; a wind very like the March east wind of England, blew across me; and <b>a</b> <b>voice</b> <b>said,</b> 'How {{do you like}} it? Will it do?' ...|$|E
6000|$|There was a tramp of booted feet in {{the hall}} outside, and then {{footsteps}} on the stairs, first mounting and then again descending. [...] "No," [...] <b>a</b> <b>voice</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "he hasn't come home." ...|$|E
5000|$|Sarfatti {{attended}} Midwood High School in Midwood, Brooklyn, {{graduating in}} 1956. In Destiny Matrix (2002), Sarfatti wrote that, {{when he was}} 13, he received at least one telephone call from <b>a</b> <b>voice</b> that <b>said</b> it was a conscious computer on <b>a</b> spaceship. The <b>voice</b> <b>said</b> he had been identified as [...] "one of 400 bright young receptive minds," [...] {{and that he would}} be picked up shortly from his building's fire escape. He and several friends waited, he wrote, but nothing happened.|$|R
6000|$|<b>A</b> girl's <b>voice</b> <b>said</b> passionately: [...] "I don't care! I shan't {{leave them}} here for folks {{to make remarks}} about! I knew they wouldn't take the premium, and I hope you're {{satisfied}} now, mother." ...|$|R
60|$|The doctor {{shook him}} {{first and then}} punched him. Then he shook him again and gave him little {{scientific}} slaps, until at length Harry Thomson, in <b>a</b> far-away <b>voice,</b> <b>said</b> that he was all right.|$|R
6000|$|At {{the moment}} when the {{aspiration}} crossed his mind, it was suddenly answered by a low knock at the door, and <b>a</b> <b>voice</b> <b>said</b> softly in the passage outside, [...] "Let me come in." ...|$|E
6000|$|Thus it {{was that}} as Nuttie {{was sitting on the}} grass in earnest contemplation of Blanche's play, a hand was familiarly laid on her shoulder, and <b>a</b> <b>voice</b> <b>said,</b> 'I haven't seen that horrid girl yet!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{prepared}} to give evidence on that point," [...] <b>a</b> <b>voice</b> <b>said</b> {{from the corner of}} the room, and there was a general movement of surprise as every one turned round to look at the speaker.|$|E
6000|$|Ethel {{walked up}} and down the room, divided between a tumult of joy, grief, dread, and perplexity. At that moment <b>a</b> little <b>voice</b> <b>said</b> at the door, [...] "Please, Margaret wants Harry to come up directly." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am here, Conway," [...] <b>a</b> faint <b>voice</b> <b>said</b> {{from the}} other end of the cabin; [...] "but I have broken my leg I think, and Desmond has knocked all the wind out of my body." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hear her! hear her!" [...] {{cried the}} revellers, {{knocking}} their horns upon the board, {{while in the}} silence that followed <b>a</b> woman's <b>voice</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "Sir Godwin's luck is great, but give me Sir Wulf's strong arms." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now then, {{why are you}} delaying?" [...] <b>a</b> <b>voice</b> <b>said</b> sharply, and a warder entered with {{a lighted}} torch. [...] "Get up, you lazy hound! It will be worse for you if I have to speak again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "D'you vant {{to look at}} a nishe coat?" [...] <b>a</b> <b>voice</b> <b>said,</b> {{which made}} him start; and then some one behind him began {{handling}} a masterpiece of Stultz's with a familiarity which would have made the baron tremble.|$|E
6000|$|... "I have no {{accommodation}} for you here, citizens," [...] <b>a</b> <b>voice</b> <b>said,</b> as Jean Martin and Leigh rode {{into the}} little courtyard, and {{a man with a}} wooden leg came out from the side door of the inn.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't {{you tell}} him," [...] <b>a</b> subdued <b>voice</b> <b>said,</b> and the man, who I think was Steel, came near choking {{me as he}} poured more spirit than I could swallow down my throat and also down my neck.|$|R
6000|$|A heavy {{body had}} plunged against the door, evidently without a {{suspicion}} {{that there would}} be any resistance. A rattling at the handle followed, and <b>a</b> <b>voice</b> outside <b>said,</b> [...] "Dash the door!" ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{dinner was}} over, and Cecil was favouring the {{audience}} with a severely classical piece of music, when, under cover thereof, <b>a</b> low <b>voice</b> <b>said</b> to Julius, [...] "Now, really and truly, tell me how he is getting on?" ...|$|R
