5|$|More global {{behavioural}} abnormalities may be noted, {{such as an}} increase in arousal and movement (described as psychomotor agitation or hyperactivity) which might reflect mania or delirium. An inability to sit still might represent akathisia, {{a side effect of}} antipsychotic medication. Similarly, a global decrease in arousal and movement (described as psychomotor retardation, <b>akinesia</b> or stupor) might indicate depression or a medical condition such as Parkinson's disease, dementia or delirium. The examiner would also comment on eye movements (repeatedly glancing to one side can suggest that the patient is experiencing hallucinations), and the quality of eye contact (which can provide clues to the patient's emotional state). Lack of eye contact may suggest depression or autism.|$|E
25|$|A pallidotomy {{involves}} {{the destruction of}} the globus pallidus, in particular the globus pallidus interna, in patients with Parkinson's who suffer from rigidity and <b>akinesia.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{specific}} {{appearance of}} the right ventricle on echocardiography {{is referred to as}} the McConnell's sign. This is the finding of <b>akinesia</b> of the mid-free wall but a normal motion of the apex. This phenomenon has a 77% sensitivity and a 94% specificity for the diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism in the setting of right ventricular dysfunction.|$|E
25|$|Gait {{freezing}}, {{also called}} motor blocks, is {{a manifestation of}} <b>akinesia.</b> Gait freezing {{is characterized by a}} sudden inability to move the lower extremities which usually lasts less than 10 seconds. It may worsen in tight, cluttered spaces, when attempting to initiate gait or turning around, or when approaching a destination. Freezing improves with treatment and also with behavioral techniques such as marching to command or following a given rhythm.|$|E
25|$|CNS {{side effects}} include drowsiness, vertigo, headache, tremor, syncope, sleep disturbances, nightmares, restlessness, <b>akinesia,</b> agitation, seizures, rigidity, akathisia, confusion, fatigue, insomnia, hyperkinesia, weakness, lethargy, ataxia, slurred speech, depression, myoclonic jerks, and anxiety. Rarely seen are delusions, hallucinations, delirium, amnesia, libido {{increase}} or decrease, paranoia and irritability, abnormal EEG, worsening of psychosis, paresthesia, status epilepticus, and obsessive compulsive symptoms. Similar to other antipsychotics clozapine rarely {{has been known}} to cause neuroleptic malignant syndrome.|$|E
25|$|After {{three weeks}} of age, Maguari stork nestlings develop {{defensive}} behaviour if their nest is approached by an intruder; which is not known for nestlings of other stork species. They crouch forward, partially spread their wings and erect the black feathers on their head, neck and back; followed by a shrill, rasping scream and an attempt to grab a persistent intruder with their bill. In many other stork species, <b>akinesia</b> lasts {{throughout much of the}} nestlings’ early life, and the constantly white plumage makes them appear as eggs to potential chick predators. However, in maguari stork nestlings, <b>akinesia</b> ceases much earlier, and the unusual aggressiveness of the young has probably developed as a specialised anti-predator strategy in compensation for the young chicks’ inability to leave the nest due to their slow-developing hallux and the vulnerable position of the nest on the ground. However, at 25–35 days old, the hallux is sufficiently developed to allow the chicks to leave ground nests in search of food. Chicks also occasionally beg for food from their parents outside the nest, but parents have never been observed to feed their young outside the nest.|$|E
25|$|Parkinson's disease (PD), {{also known}} as Parkinson disease, is a {{degenerative}} disorder of {{the central nervous system}} that often impairs the sufferer's motor skills and speech. Parkinson's disease belongs to a group of conditions called movement disorders. It is characterized by muscle rigidity, tremor, a slowing of physical movement (bradykinesia), and in extreme cases, a loss of physical movement (<b>akinesia).</b> The primary symptoms are the results of decreased stimulation of the motor cortex by the basal ganglia, normally caused by the insufficient formation and action of dopamine, which is produced in the dopaminergic neurons of the brain. Secondary symptoms may include high level cognitive dysfunction and subtle language problems. PD is both chronic and progressive.|$|E
2500|$|Neuroablative lesion surgery locates and destroys, by heat, {{the parts}} of the brain {{associated}} with producing Parkinsonian neurological symptoms. The procedures generally involve a thalamotomy and/or pallidotomy. [...] A thalamotomy is the destruction of a part of the thalamus, in particular the ventralis intermedius, to suppress tremor in 80-90% of patients. If rigidity and <b>akinesia</b> are apparent, the subthalamis nucleus is then the site of ablation.|$|E
2500|$|By the {{conclusion}} of this first run of leucotomies in February 1936, Moniz and Lima had operated on twenty patients with an average period of one week between each procedure; Moniz published his findings with great haste in March of the same year. The patients were aged between 27 and 62 years of age; twelve were female and eight were male. Nine of the patients were diagnosed as suffering from depression, six from schizophrenia, two from panic disorder, and one each from mania, catatonia and manic-depression with the most prominent symptoms being anxiety and agitation. The duration of the illness prior to the procedure varied from as little as four weeks {{to as much as}} 22 years, although all but four had been ill for at least one year. Patients were normally operated on the day they arrived at Moniz's clinic and returned within ten days to the Miguel Bombarda Mental Hospital. A perfunctory post-operative follow-up assessment took place anywhere from one to ten weeks following surgery. Complications were observed in each of the leucotomy patients and included: [...] "increased temperature, vomiting, bladder and bowel incontinence, diarrhea, and ocular affections such as ptosis and nystagmus, as well as psychological effects such as apathy, <b>akinesia,</b> lethargy, timing and local disorientation, kleptomania, and abnormal sensations of hunger". Moniz asserted that these effects were transitory and, according to his published assessment, the outcome for these first twenty patients was that 35%, or seven cases, improved significantly, another 35% were somewhat improved and the remaining 30% (six cases) were unchanged. There were no deaths and he did not consider that any patients had deteriorated following leucotomy.|$|E
50|$|Many <b>akinesia</b> {{patients}} also form {{a linguistic}} <b>akinesia</b> {{in which their}} ability to produce verbal movements mirrors their physical <b>akinesia</b> symptoms, especially after unsuccessful PVP. Patients are usually able to maintain normal levels of fluency, but often stop midsentence, unable to remember or produce a desired word. According to a study of Parkinson's patients with articulatory hypokinesia, subjects with faster rates of speech experienced more problems trying to produce conversational language than those who normally spoke at slower rates.|$|E
50|$|There {{may also}} be a myogenic cause to the fetal <b>akinesia,</b> meaning that fetal muscles do not develop {{properly}} due to a muscle disease (for example, a congenital muscular dystrophy). Similarly, connective tissue tendon and skeletal defects may contribute to the fetal <b>akinesia</b> and be the primary cause of amyoplasia. Additionally, malformations may occur in the central nervous system and/or spinal cord that can lead to a lack of fetal movement in utero. This neurogenic cause is often accompanied by a wide range of other conditions. Other causes of fetal <b>akinesia</b> may include a maternal fever during pregnancy or a virus.|$|E
50|$|The {{ballooning}} {{patterns were}} classified by Shimizu et al. as Takotsubo type for apical <b>akinesia</b> and basal hyperkinesia, reverse Takotsubo for basal <b>akinesia</b> and apical hyperkinesia, mid-ventricular type for mid-ventricular ballooning accompanied by basal and apical hyperkinesia, and localised type {{for any other}} segmental left ventricular ballooning with clinical characteristics of Takotsubo-like left ventricular dysfunction.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{cause of}} both <b>akinesia</b> and mutism is {{ablation}} of the cingulate gyrus. Destruction of the cingulate gyrus {{has been used}} in the treatment of psychosis. Such lesions result in <b>akinesia,</b> mutism, apathy, and indifference to painful stimuli. The anterior cingulate cortex is thought to supply a [...] "global energizing factor" [...] that stimulates decision making. When the anterior cingulate cortex is damaged, it can result in akinetic mutism.|$|E

50|$|Post-MI - {{the death}} of tissue in the {{ventricular}} wall due to loss of blood supply causes wall areas which do not move as well as normal (hypokinesia), {{or not at all}} (<b>akinesia),</b> meaning they relax more slowly, so the ventricular filling is relatively too rapid.|$|E
50|$|Parkinson's {{disease is}} a {{neurodegenerative}} disease characterized, in part, {{by the death of}} dopaminergic neurons in the pars compacta of the substantia nigra. The major symptoms of Parkinson's disease include tremor, <b>akinesia,</b> bradykinesia, and stiffness. Other symptoms include disturbances to posture, fatigue, sleep abnormalities, and depressed mood.|$|E
50|$|Hypokinetic {{movement}} disorders {{refer to}} <b>akinesia</b> (lack of movement), hypokinesia (reduced amplitude of movements), bradykinesia (slow movement) and rigidity. In primary movement disorders, the abnormal movement {{is the primary}} manifestation of the disorder. In secondary movement disorders, the abnormal movement is a manifestation of another systemic or neurological disorder.|$|E
50|$|The fetal <b>akinesia</b> in {{amyoplasia}} {{is thought}} to be caused by various maternal and fetal abnormalities.

50|$|This {{technique}} was first applied by Davis. In peribulbar block, 6 ml of local anaesthetic is injected to the peripheral {{spaces of the}} orbit. The anaesthetic diffuses into the muscle cone and eyelids, causing global and orbicularis <b>akinesia</b> and anaesthesia. After injection, orbital compression is applied for around 15 minutes.|$|E
50|$|Intrahippocampal {{injection}} of 8 µg of cangitoxin in rats has strong behavioral effects, leading to <b>akinesia</b> interchanging with facial automatisms and head tremor, salivation, rearing, jumping, barrel-rolling, wet dog shakes and forelimb clonic movements. In addition, convulsions occur which gradually increase in duration, {{leading to a}} status epilepticus. The electroencephalogram shows spike-and-wave, which is typically seen during epileptic convulsions.|$|E
50|$|Pridopidine is {{less likely}} to produce {{extrapyramidal}} symptoms, such as <b>akinesia</b> (inability to initiate movement) and akathisia (inability to remain motionless), than dopamine antagonists (such as antipsychotics). Furthermore, pridopidine displays no detectable intrinsic activity, differentiating it from D2 receptor agonists and partial agonists (agents that stimulate receptor responses). Pridopidine, therefore, differs from D2 receptor antagonists, agonists and partial agonists.|$|E

50|$|Kinesia paradoxa can {{very easily}} be stimulated by visual and {{auditory}} cues, {{but there is}} an additional method that does not require any external cues. By having an individual focus all their attention on walking or another movement, they are sometimes able to control <b>akinesia</b> in its early stages. For example, in a common household <b>akinesia</b> is much more common because the patient is not only focusing on their walking because of the excess of additional distractions in the home. Often eliminating some of these distractions and learning to focus all attention on walking can help improve mobility. This is also true when participating in other activities such as cycling. When an individual focuses only on their pedaling, they are often able to facilitate smooth movements. This method is only effective in very rare cases and those that are not extreme, so if proven unhelpful visual and auditory cues should be explored further.|$|E

5000|$|... "Many {{patients}} {{often find}} {{a hard time}} describing the incomprehensible pain and restlessness from severe akathisia," [...] especially if they also experience cognitive impairment, have co-occurring <b>akinesia</b> (stillness,) or have an intellectual impairment. In addition, not all observable restless motion is akathisia. For example, mania, agitated depression, and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder may look like akathisia, but the movements feel voluntary and not due to restlessness.|$|E
50|$|Susruta Samhita has evidences {{of use of}} {{anaesthesia}} for ocular surgeries. Inhalational anaesthesia {{was used}} for this purpose. Egyptian surgeons used carotid compression to produce transient ischemia during eye surgery to reduce the perception of pain. In 1884, Karl Koller used cocaine for ocular surgery. The same year, Herman Knapp used cocaine for retrobulbar block. In 1914, van Lint achieved orbicularis <b>akinesia</b> by local injection.|$|E
5000|$|... van Lint's block : In van Lint's block, the {{peripheral}} branches of facial nerve are blocked.
