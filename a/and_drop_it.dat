25|$|A knot {{in three}} {{dimensions}} can be untied when placed in four-dimensional space. This is done by changing crossings. Suppose one strand is behind another as seen from a chosen point. Lift it into the fourth dimension, {{so there is no}} obstacle (the front strand having no component there); then slide it forward, <b>and</b> <b>drop</b> <b>it</b> back, now in front. Analogies for the plane would be lifting a string up off the surface, or removing a dot from inside a circle.|$|E
25|$|In one instance, Shaw and Edwards {{were asked}} to move small objects in a sealed {{transparent}} globe, normally small bits of paper balanced on an edge. At first {{they were unable to}} get anything to happen, but later noticed that the container was being removed to replace the object within. During one such event they took the opportunity to roll up a small ball of metal foil <b>and</b> <b>drop</b> <b>it</b> into the circular ring cut into the surface of the table that held the globe. This introduced a small gap under one edge, which they could blow into to cause the paper to move.|$|E
25|$|Creeling {{involved}} {{replacing the}} rovings bobbins {{in a section}} of the mule without stopping the mule. On very coarse counts a bobbin lasted two days but on fine count it could last for 3 weeks. To creel, the creeler stood behind the mule, he placed new bobbins on the shelf above the creel. As the bobbin ran empty he would pick it off its skewer in the creel unreeling 30cm or so of roving, <b>and</b> <b>drop</b> <b>it</b> into a skip. With his left hand, he would place on the new bobbin onto the skewer from above and with his right hand twist in the new roving into the tail of the last.|$|E

25|$|The {{most common}} type of forging {{equipment}} is the hammer and anvil. Principles behind the hammer and anvil are still used today in drop-hammer equipment. The principle behind the machine is simple: raise the hammer <b>and</b> <b>drop</b> <b>it</b> or propel it into the workpiece, which rests on the anvil. The main variations between drop-hammers are in the way the hammer is powered; the most common being air and steam hammers. Drop-hammers usually operate in a vertical position. The main reason for this is excess energy (energy that isn't used to deform the workpiece) that isn't released as heat or sound needs to be transmitted to the foundation. Moreover, a large machine base is needed to absorb the impacts.|$|E
25|$|The {{crew was}} sent from Karljohansvern on 15 November 1918 and the command flag was hoisted on 17 November. The same day Hjalmar Riiser-Larsen flew {{the first of}} two Sopwith Babys to the station. Seven people were {{stationed}} at Avaldsnes, under the command of First Lieutenant Riiser-Larsen. He was subordinate to the captain of HNoMS Tordenskjold, which was stationed in Haugesund. The Spowiths were used in minesweeping duty. They would survey the North Sea for mines. In case they found any, they would note its location on a map <b>and</b> <b>drop</b> <b>it</b> to the crew on the nearest minesweeper. Work was carried out around Karmøy and the shipping channel towards Stavanger. By January it was decided that minesweeping in the area would no longer require aerial aid. The aircraft were flown to Kristiansand on 17 January 1919 and the station was closed on 21 January 1919.|$|E
25|$|Chicks hatch {{synchronously}} with a dense downy coat. The coloring is white, grey or yellow, {{with dark}} spots {{to aid in}} camouflage. The young are precocial, and can run {{almost as soon as}} they hatch. Soon after hatching the eggs, the male will leave the nest and call the chicks to him with a soft contact call. If threatened, he will freeze and attempt to hide the chicks under his wings or belly. There have been documented cases of females caring for the young; it is thought that this occurs when the male has been killed. Young chicks can feed themselves within the first few days, but the male will bring the food <b>and</b> <b>drop</b> <b>it</b> on {{the ground in front of}} them. The chicks have a high initial mortality rate. However, within a few days they are chasing insects on their own and, at 1–3 weeks, they can fly to branches a metre from the ground. They are self-sufficient within 20 days.|$|E

2500|$|When {{the cold}} winds of winter {{pass over the}} warmer water of the lake, they pick up {{moisture}} <b>and</b> <b>drop</b> <b>it</b> as lake-effect snow. Since the prevailing winter winds are from the northwest, the southern and southeastern shoreline of the lake {{is referred to as}} the snowbelt. In some winters the area between Oswego and Pulaski may receive twenty or more feet (600cm) of snowfall. Also impacted by lake-effect snow is the Tug Hill Plateau, an area of elevated land that is about [...] east of Lake Ontario, creating ideal conditions for lake-effect snowfall. The [...] "Hill", as it is often referred to, typically receives more snow than any other region in the eastern United States. As a result, Tug Hill is a popular location for winter enthusiasts, such as snow-mobilers and cross-country skiers. Lake-effect snow often extends inland as far as Syracuse, with that city often recording the most winter snowfall accumulation of any large city in the United States. Other cities in the world receive more snow annually, such as Quebec City, which averages , and Sapporo, Japan, which receives [...] each year and is often regarded as the snowiest city in the world.|$|E
2500|$|Mister Freeze {{appears in}} The New Batman Adventures, {{sporting}} a new, sleeker design. As his mutation slowly destroys his body, Victor Fries kidnapped scientists (voiced by Jeff Bennett and Lauren Tom) {{to try and}} stop the process, only succeeding in saving his head which is supported by four robotic legs built separate from his suit. When a cured Nora Fries married her own doctor and left Gotham permanently, the trauma destroys whatever is left of Fries' humanity. Mister Freeze vows to inflict on others the loss he's suffered in the episode [...] "Cold Comfort" [...] by taking away the things they value most, much to the confusion of Robin and Batgirl. When Freeze is confronted at his hideout by Batman and Batgirl, he reveals his true condition to {{them as well as}} his goal of destroying Gotham City [...] all the Dark Knight holds dear [...] by dropping a 'reverse fusion bomb' that will freeze the city. Freeze boards a helicopter to drop the bomb. However, he is followed by Batman and they engage in a duel in which Batman uses a grappling gun to hook Freeze to the bomb <b>and</b> <b>drop</b> <b>it</b> into the river, where an explosion creates a huge iceberg. Although Freeze is presumed dead, his head is seen to be missing as the episode ends.|$|E
