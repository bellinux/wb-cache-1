The long sides consisted of temporary wooden stands, with seating on the south stand and standing places on terraces on the north stand. The end sides of the stadium consisted of grass embankments at a 30 percent angle, allowing for standing space for spectators without having to build stands. Changing rooms were located in a nearby German-built barracks dating from the Second World War.|$|E
5|$|The minimum {{information}} produced from a successful structural alignment {{is a set}} of residues that are considered equivalent between the structures. This set of equivalences is then typically used to superpose the three-dimensional coordinates for each input structure. (Note that one input element may be fixed as a reference and therefore its superposed coordinates do not change.) The fitted structures can be used to calculate mutual RMSD values, as well as other more sophisticated measures of structural similarity such as the global distance test (GDT, the metric used in CASP). The structural alignment also implies a corresponding one-dimensional sequence alignment from which a sequence identity, or the percentage of residues that are identical between the input structures, can be calculated <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>measure</b> of how closely the two sequences are related.|$|E

After years of observations of wild ring-tailed lemur populations at the Berenty Reserve in Madagascar and as well as baboons in Africa, she more recently concluded that this highly social lemur species does not demonstrate the equivalent social complexity of cercopithecine monkeys, despite general appearances.|$|E

5|$|Early in 1952, General Tire {{purchased}} the Bamberger Broadcasting Service from R.H. Macy and Company. With the deal, General Tire acquired the WOR radio and TV stations {{and the rights}} to the name General Teleradio, under which the company merged its broadcasting interests as a new division (Bamberger had previously sold its TV station in the nation's capital, WOIC, to CBS and the Washington Post). Most importantly, as far as the future of the Mutual Broadcasting System was concerned, WOR's founding shares in the network, when added to the Yankee and Don Lee holdings, gave General Tire majority control of Mutual. That same year, NBC began its attempts to win the television rights to Queen for a Day from Mutual. <b>As</b> <b>a</b> <b>measure</b> of the afternoon show's success, its audience at its new Los Angeles home, General Teleradio/Don Lee's KHJ-TV, was triple that of the city's six other stations combined.

It means that Pancasila should {{be used as the}} basis to examine, nullify and to decide the Constitutionality of laws in Indonesia. This research critically analyses: (i) Why do Pancasila, the Indonesian rechtsidee, should be used <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>measuring</b> instrument or <b>as</b> <b>a</b> reviewing tools on the process of constitutional review in the Constitutional Court; (ii) Precedents or decided cases that used Pancasila as the basis to determine the constitutionality of a particular law (especially a judicial review of Acts in the area of politics, economic, social and religion during 2003 - 2013); (iii) The best formula to ensure the Constitutional Court to always use Pancasila as the main basis for judicial review of laws. This research is based on positivism paradigm. A doctrinaire approach is utilized to address the research questions and to reach the objectives of this research. Additionally, a deductive analysis is used in this research. This work has found that: First, there are convincing facts that Pancasila as the national principle was born on 1 June 1945 when Soekarno gave speech in front of BPUPK general assembly. Pancasila was not born on 18 August 1945 at the same time with the ratification of the Constitution (UUD 1945) since the legal position of Pancasila and the Constitution is not equal. Pancasila should be used <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>measuring</b> instrument for the Constitutional Court to review the constitutionality of every law considering the legal position of Pancasila as the rechtsidee of Indonesia that has regulatory function to determine the fairness of a particular law. Second, during 2003 - 2013 there are three types of Court decisions from Pancasila perspective: decisions without consider Pancasila <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>measuring</b> instrument, decision that not only mentioned articles in the Constitution but also stated about the value of Pancasila but the value of Pancasila are not clearly mentioned <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>measuring</b> instrument; and decision that clearly used Pancasila <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>measuring</b> instrument.

5|$|The athletes or teams who place first, second, {{or third}} in each event receive medals. The winners receive gold medals, which were solid gold until 1912, then made of gilded silver and now {{gold-plated}} silver. Every gold medal however must contain {{at least six}} grams of pure gold. The runners-up receive silver medals and the third-place athletes are awarded bronze medals. In events contested by a single-elimination tournament (most notably boxing), third place might not be determined and both semifinal losers receive bronze medals. At the 1896 Olympics only the first two received a medal; silver for first and bronze for second. The current three-medal format was introduced at the 1904 Olympics. From 1948 onward athletes placing fourth, fifth, and sixth have received certificates, which became officially known as victory diplomas; in 1984 victory diplomas for seventh- and eighth-place finishers were added.
