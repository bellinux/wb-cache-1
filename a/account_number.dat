5|$|Both {{the sale}} of weapons to Iran, and the funding of the Contras, {{attempted}} to circumvent not only stated administration policy, but also the Boland Amendment. Administration officials argued that regardless of the Congress restricting the funds for the Contras, or any affair, the President (or {{in this case the}} administration) could carry on by seeking alternative means of funding such as private entities and foreign governments. Funding from one foreign country, Brunei, was botched when North's secretary, Fawn Hall, transposed the numbers of North's Swiss bank <b>account</b> <b>number.</b> A Swiss businessman, suddenly $10 million richer, alerted the authorities of the mistake. The money was eventually returned to the Sultan of Brunei, with interest.|$|E
25|$|The IBAN {{consists}} {{of up to}} 34 alphanumeric characters comprising: a country code; two check digits; and a number that includes the domestic bank <b>account</b> <b>number,</b> branch identifier, and potential routing information.

25|$|More recently, {{building}} {{societies have}} tended to obtain sort-code and <b>account</b> <b>number</b> allocations within the clearing system, and hence the use of roll numbers has diminished.

25|$|The {{check digits}} enable the sending bank (or its customer) {{to perform a}} sanity check of the routing {{destination}} and <b>account</b> <b>number</b> from a single string of data {{at the time of}} data entry. This check is guaranteed to detect any instances where a single character has been omitted, duplicated, mistyped or where two characters have been transposed. Thus routing and <b>account</b> <b>number</b> errors are virtually eliminated.|$|E

25|$|Because most {{building}} societies {{were not}} direct {{members of the}} UK clearing system, it was common for them to use a roll number to identify accounts rather than to allocate a six-digit sort-code and eight-digit <b>account</b> <b>number</b> to the BACS standards.|$|E

25|$|Credit cards have {{a printed}} or {{embossed}} bank card number {{complying with the}} ISO/IEC 7812 numbering standard. The card number's prefix, called the Bank Identification Number, is the sequence of digits {{at the beginning of}} the number that determine the bank to which a credit card number belongs. This is the first six digits for MasterCard and Visa cards. The next nine digits are the individual <b>account</b> <b>number,</b> and the final digit is a validity check code.|$|E
50|$|Each {{account in}} the chart of {{accounts}} is typically assigned a name and a unique number by which it can be identified.

50|$|The (national) bank codes {{differ from}} the {{international}} Bank Identifier Code (BIC/ISO 9362, a normalized code - also known as Business Identifier Code, Bank International Code and SWIFT code).

25|$|The {{degree to}} which bank verifies the {{validity}} of a recipient's bank <b>account</b> <b>number</b> depends of {{the configuration of the}} transmitting bank's softwaremany major software packages supply bank account validation as a standard function. Some banks outside Europe may not recognize IBAN, though this is expected to diminish with time. Non-European banks usually accept IBANs for accounts in Europe, although they might not treat IBANs differently from other foreign bank account numbers. In particular, they might not check the IBAN's validity prior to sending the transfer.|$|E
25|$|But how, {{one might}} ask, is this still {{thriving}} given the increasing emphasis on internet security? The simple, but unfortunate solution, according to Symantec’s “Internet Security Threat Report”, {{is that of}} the expanding “underground economy”. With more than fifty percent of the supporting servers located in the United States, this “underground economy” has become a haven for internet thieves, who use the system in order to sell stolen information. These pieces of information can range from generic things such as a user account or email to something as personal as a bank <b>account</b> <b>number</b> and PIN.|$|E
