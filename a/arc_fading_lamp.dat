40|$|We {{report an}} {{evidence}} for a phase separation in a one-dimensional continuous system of spinless fermions with a short-range attractive interaction. It {{is based on the}} numerical study of the momentum-dependent ground state energy. While at small interaction strengths it has a conventional Luttinger-liquid shape of periodic arcs on top of the shallow finite-size-induced parabola, the <b>arcs</b> <b>fade</b> away and finally vanish at some finite critical interaction strength. We interpret this result as a condensation of fermions into a liquid one-dimensional droplet and support this conclusion by further arguments...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe have {{analyzed}} {{the response of}} azimuthal component of the ionospheric electric field to auroral arc activity. We have chosen for analysis three intervals of coordinated EISCAT and TV observations on 18 February, 1993. These intervals include three kinds of arc activity: {{the appearance of a}} new auroral arc, the gradual brightening of the existing arc and variations of the arc luminosity. The arcs were mostly east-west aligned. In all cases, the enhancement of arc luminosity is accompanied by a decrease in the westward component of the ionospheric electric field. In contrast, an increase of that component seems to be connected with <b>arc</b> <b>fading.</b> The observed response is assumed to have the same nature as the "short circuit" of an external electric field by the conductor. The possible consequence of this phenomenon is discussed [...] Keywords. Ionosphere (electric fields and currents; ionospheric irregularities) · Magnetospheric physics (auroral phenomena...|$|R

50|$|The TX3 was the Laser flagship. It came {{standard}} with 14-inch satin-chrome alloy wheels, sports cloth interior trim, red insert strips in {{the body}} side mouldings and bumpers, black tailgate and beaver panel garnishes, semi-bucket seats with adjustable seat height, back and lumbar support, auto <b>fade</b> interior <b>lamps,</b> and all other Ghia appointings. EFI and A/C was standard, and automatic transmission was not available. The TX3 also had a unique front fascia with quad headlights and the parker lamps incorporated into the indicator lenses (L/GL/Ghia had the parkers inside the main headlight unit) and two-tone paint.|$|R
50|$|Most of Zvi's writing {{during this}} time were circled around the Character Benjamin the Fourth - {{as seen in the}} book When the <b>Lamp</b> <b>Fade</b> Away, this {{character}} was based on the author's self-image. The stories center around loving and soft-spoken persona - people trapped in the reality of revolution, war and the destruction of their religious and cultural traditions.|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} new M-I {{coupling}} model of substorm during southward IMF {{based on the}} THEMIS observations of two events on 1 March 2008. The first event (E- 1) was classified as a pseudo-breakup: brightening of the onset arc preceded the first dipolarization onset by &sim; 71 &pm; 3 s, but the breakup <b>arcs</b> <b>faded</b> within &sim; 5 min without substantial poleward expansion and the dipolarization stopped and reversed to thinning. The second event (E- 2) {{was identified as a}} substorm: brightening of the second onset arc preceded the second dipolarization onset by &sim; 80 &pm; 3 s, leading to a full-scale expanding auroral bulge during the substorm expansion phase for &sim; 20 min. The Alfvén travel time from the ionosphere to the dipolarization onset region is estimated at &sim; 69. 3 s in E- 1; at &sim; 80. 3 s in E- 2, which matched well with the observed time delay of the dipolarization onset after the brightening of the onset arc, respectively in E- 1 and E- 2. Brightening of the onset arc precedes the dipolarization onset suggest that the onset arc brightening is caused by the intense upward field-aligned currents originating from the divergence of the Cowling electrojet in the ionosphere. The Cowling electrojet current loop (CECL) is formed to close the field-aligned currents at all times. The closure current in the Alfvén wavefront is anti-parallel to the cross-tail current. Dipolarization onset occurs when the Alfvén wavefront incident on the near-Earth plasma sheet to disrupt the cross-tail current in the dipolarization region. Slow MHD waves dominate the disruption of the cross-tail current in the dipolarization region...|$|R
50|$|Lady Sandrilene fa Toren {{is locked}} {{away in a}} dark room with a <b>fading</b> oil <b>lamp.</b> She was magically hidden in this {{storeroom}} days ago by her nurse, who was murdered moments later just outside the door by a mob bent on destroying everything infected by the fierce plague that killed Sandry's parents. Sandry is concerned about the flickering oil lamp, even though she knows there is no chance of anybody finding her as the room she is locked in is protected by magic so that it cannot be found either magically or non-magically, and the only person who knows her whereabouts is her nurse, who is dead. Sandry is afraid of going crazy in the darkness. Unknowingly doing her first piece of magic, Sandry traps the remaining light in a simple braid. A powerful seer, Niklaren Goldeye, finds her and takes her to Winding Circle in Emelan.|$|R
50|$|There {{were two}} basic slide {{projector}} programming controls: {{a set of}} instructions to position the slide in the projector {{and a set of}} instructions for the slide projector lamp. These controls would be used to define the cues. The cues would often designate an action for more than one projector such as with a dissolve between two slides which would require simultaneously fading up on one <b>lamp</b> and <b>fading</b> down another <b>lamp.</b> Similar commands were used to control motion-picture projectors, as well as auxiliary controls for lighting and effects, etc.|$|R
60|$|The {{town has}} lately yawned a weary laugh over {{an enemy of}} yours, who has {{produced}} two heavy volumes, styled by him 'The Real Shelley.' The real Shelley, it appears, was Shelley as conceived of by a worthy gentleman so prejudiced and so skilled in taking up things by the wrong handle that I wonder he has not made a name in the exact science of Comparative Mythology. He criticises you {{in the spirit of}} that Christian Apologist, the Englishman who called you 'a damned Atheist' in the post-office at Pisa. He finds that you had 'a little turned-up nose,' a feature no less important in his system than was the nose of Cleopatra (according to Pascal) {{in the history of the}} world. To be in harmony with your nose, you were a 'phenomenal' liar, an ill-bred, ill-born, profligate, partly insane, an evil-tempered monster, a self-righteous person, full of self-approbation--in fact you were the Beast of this pious Apocalypse. Your friend Dr. Lind was an embittered and scurrilous apothecary, 'a bad old man.' But enough of this inopportune brawler. For Humanity, of which you hoped such great things, Science predicts extinction in a night of Frost. The sun will grow cold, slowly--as slowly as doom came on Jupiter in your 'Prometheus,' but as surely. If this nightmare be fulfilled, perhaps the Last Man, in some fetid hut on the ice-bound Equator, will read. by a <b>fading</b> <b>lamp</b> charged with the dregs of the oil in his cruse, the poetry of Shelley. So reading, he, the latest of his race, will not wholly be deprived of those sights which alone (says the nameless Greek) make life worth enduring. In your verse he will have sight of sky, and sea, and cloud, the gold of dawn and the gloom of earthquake and eclipse, he will be face to face, in fancy, with the great powers that are dead, sun, and ocean, and the illimitable azure of the heavens. In Shelley's poetry, while Man endures, all those will survive; for your 'voice is as the voice of winds and tides,' and perhaps more deathless than all of these, and only perishable with the perishing of the human spirit.|$|R
50|$|Manufacturers {{of highly}} {{specialized}} multi-image {{equipment such as}} optical slide cameras and slide projector programming hardware. Precise camera systems were developed for the multi-image market featuring pin-registered film movements capable of making multiple exposures, controlled backlit color light sources, motorized multi-axis compounds for precise positioning of artwork, and long-roll film loads. Slide projector programming computers and dissolve equipment and software was developed to synchronize the slides with the audio by providing precise time control over slide tray positioning and <b>lamp</b> <b>fade</b> rates needed to create multi-image animation. Programmer and camera manufacturers included Audio Visual Labs, Electrosonic, Clearlight Inc. Spindler & Sauppe, Marron Carrel and Forox.|$|R
50|$|The third {{standard}} {{option is to}} use electroluminescent (EL) lamps. They are lower priced compared to fiber optics and offer additional design flexibility. The color of light emitted from an EL lamp can {{vary depending on the}} phosphors that are used. Some common colors are blue/green and yellow/green, white, blue and orange. EL lamps have a half-life of approximately 3000-8000 hours depending upon the quality of the phosphor. Once they reach their half-life, the brightness starts to <b>fade</b> rapidly. EL <b>lamps</b> are thus not a good choice if the lamp is on {{for an extended period of}} time. Fading or flashing could double the life of the lamp.|$|R
30|$|The {{discrete}} aurora for the 630.0 -nm wavelength abruptly brightened at {{the onset}} of the MI, and the center of activity shifted equatorward in a similar manner to the previous event (Fig.  4 g, k–o). During the MI, the preexisting <b>arc</b> slowly <b>faded</b> away, and the equatorward arc became the dominant structure (Fig.  4 h, k–m), indicating that the MI current system is a separate structure from the preexisting DP- 2. On the other hand, the 557.7 -nm diffuse auroral intensity slowly increased only during the PI and then abruptly intensified {{at the onset}} of the MI (Fig.  4 i–m). The lack of clear magnetic and auroral signatures of the PI indicates that the post-noon PI current was not present or much smaller than that in event 1. If we do not have auroral measurements, we cannot rule out the possibility that the lack of a PI in the magnetometer data might be because the PI signal was masked by an MI signal or occurred far away from noon. However, the smaller diffuse auroral luminosity indicates that the PI signal in the post-noon sector was indeed substantially smaller than that in event 1.|$|R
50|$|The Holocaust {{and overall}} {{suffering}} of the Jewish People had a tremendous influence on Zvi and inspired the book When the <b>Lamp</b> <b>Fades</b> Away (The Perpetual Fire) - in which, once the Jews are exterminated or driven out of City of Hadiach a memorial lamp that has been alight {{for over a century}} goes dark. The closing sentiments of the book are Zionist wishes for a land where the Jews would be safe of such suffering. Zvi wrote this work in Hebrew and complete secrecy, so much so as to hide the efforts from his own Family. Never satisfied with the work the author rewrites it numerous times, only finishing it in 1962. The book is later published in Israel in 1966 under the pen name A. Tsfoni.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I'm proud {{for what}} I am--that's very certain. But I don't expect anything,' Laura Wing declared. 'That's the only form my pride takes. Please give my love to Mrs. Berrington. I am so sorry--so sorry,' she went on, {{to change the}} talk from the subject of her marrying. She wanted to marry but she wanted also not to want it and, above all, not to appear to. She lingered in the room, moving about a little; the place was always so {{pleasant}} to her that to go away--to return to her own barren home--had the effect of forfeiting a sort of privilege of sanctuary. The afternoon had <b>faded</b> but the <b>lamps</b> had been brought in, the smell of flowers {{was in the air}} and the old house of Plash seemed to recognise the hour that suited it best. The quiet old lady in the firelight, encompassed with the symbolic security of chintz and water-colour, gave her a sudden vision of how blessed it would be to jump all the middle dangers of life and have arrived at the end, safely, sensibly, with a cap and gloves and consideration and memories. 'And, Lady Davenant, what does she think?' she asked abruptly, stopping short and referring to Mrs. Berrington.|$|R
6000|$|Peter apologised extravagantly for {{not having}} seen to it that she had proper refreshment, and {{took her to the}} round table, in a corner, on which the little {{collation}} had been served. He poured out tea for her and pressed bread and butter on her and petits fours, of all which she profusely and methodically partook. It was late; the afternoon had <b>faded</b> and a <b>lamp</b> been brought in, the wide shade of which shed a fair glow on the tea-service and the plates of pretty food. The Lovicks sat with Mrs. Rooth {{at the other end of}} the room, and the girl stood at the table, drinking her tea and eating her bread and butter. She consumed these articles so freely that he wondered if she had been truly in want of a meal--if they were so poor as to have to count with that sort of privation. This supposition was softening, but still not so much so as to make him ask her to sit down. She appeared indeed to prefer to stand: she looked better so, as if the freedom, the conspicuity of being on her feet and treading a stage were agreeable to her. While Sherringham lingered near her all vaguely, his hands in his pockets and his mind now void of everything but a planned evasion of the theatrical question--there were moments when he was so plentifully tired of it--she broke out abruptly: [...] "Confess you think me intolerably bad!" ...|$|R
6000|$|One {{afternoon}} {{some three}} weeks after we had moved into the new house, I {{came out of the}} Club, where I had been lunching in conference with Scherer and two capitalists from New York. It was after four o'clock, the day was <b>fading,</b> the street <b>lamps</b> were beginning to cast sickly streaks of jade-coloured light across the slush of the pavements. It was the sight of this slush (which for a brief half hour that morning had been pure snow, and had sent Matthew and Moreton and Biddy into ecstasies at the notion of a [...] "real Christmas"), that brought to my mind the immanence of the festival, and the fact that I had as yet bought no presents. Such was the predicament in which I usually found myself on Christmas eve; and it was not without a certain sense of annoyance at the task thus abruptly confronting me that I got into my automobile and directed the chauffeur to the shopping district. The crowds surged along the wet sidewalks and overflowed into the street, and {{over the heads of the}} people I stared at the blazing shop-windows decked out in Christmas greens. My chauffeur, a bristly-haired Parisian, blew his horn insolently, men and women jostled each other to get out of the way, their holiday mood giving place to resentment as they stared into the windows of the limousine. With the American inability to sit still I shifted from one corner of the seat to another, impatient at the slow progress of the machine: and I felt a certain contempt for human beings, that they should make all this fuss, burden themselves with all these senseless purchases, for a tradition. The automobile stopped, and I fought my way across the sidewalk into the store of that time-honoured firm, Elgin, Yates and Garner, pausing uncertainly before the very counter where, some ten years before, I had bought an engagement ring. Young Mr. Garner himself spied me, and handing over a customer to a tired clerk, hurried forward to greet me, his manner implying that my entrance was in some sort an event. I had become used to this aroma of deference.|$|R
