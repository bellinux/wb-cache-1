In The Penelopiad, Atwood re-writes archetypes of female passivity <b>and</b> <b>victimization</b> while using contemporary ideas of justice and a variety of genres.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: This study {{investigated}} the development and consequences of off-line <b>and</b> online <b>victimization</b> during adolescence. We examined the number and shapes of off-line <b>and</b> online <b>victimization</b> trajectories, the relationship between trajectories of off-line <b>and</b> online <b>victimization,</b> <b>and</b> their effect on life satisfaction. Methods: A four-wave panel study with 6 -month time intervals was conducted among {{a representative sample of}} Dutch adolescents aged 12 - 17 years (N = 1, 762). We used group-based modeling to investigate the victimization trajectories. Results:Three off-line victimization trajectories could be distinguished. One group followed a trajectory of low to no victimization experiences across adolescence. A second group followed a pathway of moderate <b>and</b> decreasing <b>victimization.</b> A third group followed a pathway of high <b>and</b> decreasing <b>victimization.</b> Two groups in online victimization could be distinguished. One group followed a trajectory of low to no victimization experiences. A second group followed a pathway of moderate victimization that peaked at age 14. Dual-trajectory analyses revealed a substantial overlap between off-line <b>and</b> online <b>victimization</b> trajectories. Finally, <b>victimization</b> <b>and</b> life satisfaction were longitudinally related; moderate <b>and</b> high <b>victimization</b> trajectories resulted in lower levels of life satisfaction during wave 4. Conclusions: The overlap between the off-line <b>and</b> online <b>victimization</b> trajectories <b>and</b> their negative consequences on life satisfaction suggests that prevention of victimization should focus on both types of victimization. The results suggest that peer victimization should not be studied without considering adolescent peer relationships on the Internet...|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{the current}} study was to {{investigate}} whether peer rejection <b>and</b> peer <b>victimization</b> mediated the relation between children’s aggressive behaviors and depressive symptoms. Participants were 533 fourth- and fifth-grade children (289 girls and 244 boys). Data on aggression <b>and</b> peer <b>victimization</b> were collected through teacher and peer report, whereas data on depressive symptoms were collected through self-, teacher, and peer report. Peer rejection was measured through peer nominations of liking and disliking. Through testing two competing concurrent structural models, results revealed that peer rejection <b>and</b> peer <b>victimization</b> jointly mediated the overall relation between aggression and depressive symptoms, although this mediation was only partial. Furthermore, peer rejection partially mediated the relation between aggression <b>and</b> peer <b>victimization,</b> <b>and</b> peer <b>victimization</b> partially mediated the relation between peer rejection and depressive symptoms.

Although relations between <b>victimization</b> <b>and</b> academic and social competence have been examined, fewer studies have considered how underlying processes linking these constructs are related or whether relations differ for adolescent subgroups. The current study’s purpose was to examine potential mediating and moderating effects in associations between physical <b>and</b> relational <b>victimization</b> <b>and</b> academic and social competence. Participants included a predominantly African American sample of 271 adolescents participating in a longitudinal violence prevention project.

25|$|While the genders {{engage in}} IPV at about equal rates, females {{are more likely}} to use less {{dangerous}} forms of physical violence (e.g. pushing, pinching, slapping, scratching or kicking), while males {{are more likely to}} punch, strangle, beat, burn, or threaten with weapons. Males {{are also more likely to}} use sexual aggression, although both genders are equally likely to pressure their partner into sexual activities. In addition, females are four times more likely to respond as having experienced rape and are more likely to suffer fatal injuries inflicted by their partner, or to need psychological help as a result of the abuse. Females are more likely to consider IPV a serious problem than are their male counterparts, who are more likely to disregard female-perpetrated IPV. Along with form, motivations for violence also vary by gender: females are likely to perpetrate violence in self-defense, while males are likely to perpetrate violence to exert power or control. The self-defense aspect is supported by findings that previous victimization is a stronger predictor of perpetration in females than in males. Other research indicates that boys who have been abused in childhood by a family member are more prone to IPV perpetration, while girls who have been abused in childhood by a family member are prone to lack empathy and self-efficacy; but the risks for the likelihood of IPV perpetration <b>and</b> <b>victimization</b> among adolescents vary and are not well understood.|$|E
500|$|Western {{scholarship}} has historically used ideas of subordinance <b>and</b> <b>victimization</b> to characterize traditional Chinese womanhood. These beliefs were largely constructed {{on the basis}} of ideological and political agendas, and were widely accepted despite their ethnocentrism. Early European writings pertaining to Chinese women were produced by missionaries and ethnologists {{at the conclusion of the}} 19th century. The goal of the missionaries was to [...] "civilize China," [...] and highlighting weakness <b>and</b> <b>victimization</b> provided for the continuance of their work. This belief prompted scholars to use female subordination as a means to validate Western ideas about Chinese culture and Confucian principles.|$|E
500|$|In the 1970s, as {{the feminist}} {{movements}} were forming, {{they began to}} affect the literature surrounding women in China. Studies on Chinese women from this period were concerned with women's liberation, and were sympathetic to the feminist movement. This sentiment largely influenced the topics and methodology of the research. With this shift in perspective, the focus of discourse remained on subordination, patriarchal oppression, <b>and</b> <b>victimization.</b> These studies examined such issues as foot binding and the chastity of widows. Literature formulated by feminist writers did nothing to dispel {{the myth of the}} weak, subservient woman. These works provided a new bias that had not before been articulated. Feminists believed that Chinese women were a part of a [...] "universally subordinated womanhood". This line of thinking illustrates the cultural superiority inherently felt by Western women. Writings on Chinese woman rarely account for differences in time, ethnicity, class, region or age, preferring to describe the status of women as a static, unitary fixture of Chinese culture, despite the political and geographic boundaries that defined different regions and the economic and social changes that occurred throughout history.|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} the mediational role of emotion dysregulation in the relations between peer <b>victimization,</b> internalizing symptoms, <b>and</b> aggression. Participants were 253 predominantly African-American elementary school children from a low-income, high-risk environment. Results indicated that worry dysregulation partially mediated the associations between child-reported overt <b>and</b> relational <b>victimization</b> <b>and</b> anxiety symptoms. Evidence for partial mediation of the associations between self-reports of overt <b>and</b> relational <b>victimization</b> <b>and</b> aggression through anger dysregulation were also found. These results provide general support for notion that emotion dysregulation operates as a mechanism linking overt <b>and</b> relational <b>victimization</b> to internalizing symptoms and aggression.

2500|$|Bullying is abusive social {{interaction}} between peers which can include aggression, harassment, and violence. Bullying is typically repetitive and enacted {{by those who}} are in a position of power over the victim. A growing body of research illustrates a significant relationship between bullying and emotional intelligence. Emotional intelligence (EI) is a set of abilities related to the understanding, use and management of emotion as it relates to one's self and others. Mayer et al., (2008) defines the dimensions of overall EI as: [...] "accurately perceiving emotion, using emotions to facilitate thought, understanding emotion, and managing emotion". The concept combines emotional and intellectual processes. Lower emotional intelligence appears to be related to involvement in bullying, as the bully and/or the victim of bullying. EI seems {{to play an important role}} in both bullying behavior <b>and</b> <b>victimization</b> in bullying; given that EI is illustrated to be malleable, EI education could greatly improve bullying prevention and intervention initiatives.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the roles of prosocial {{perceptions}} and gender in the relative relationships between relational <b>victimization</b> <b>and</b> depressive symptoms; <b>and</b> relational <b>victimization</b> <b>and</b> loneliness/social dissatisfaction among preadolescents. Five hypotheses guided this investigation. First, it was hypothesized that students reporting high-level relational victimization would experience higher levels of depressive symptoms as compared to students reporting low-level relational victimization. Second, it was hypothesized that students reporting high-level relational victimization would experience higher levels of loneliness/social dissatisfaction as compared to students reporting low-level loneliness/social dissatisfaction. The third hypothesis was prosocial perceptions would moderate the relative relationships between relational <b>victimization</b> <b>and</b> depressive symptoms; <b>and</b> relational <b>victimization</b> <b>and</b> loneliness/social dissatisfaction. Hypothesis four was students reporting both high-level relational <b>victimization</b> <b>and</b> high-level prosocial perceptions would report lower levels of depressive symptoms and loneliness/social dissatisfaction compared to students reporting both high-level relational <b>victimization</b> <b>and</b> low-level prosocial perceptions. The final hypothesis guiding this investigation was the path coefficients would be stronger for girls. ^ Participants in this study included 907 sixth, seventh, and eighth grade students from three Midwestern middle schools that participated in a larger longitudinal study on bullying and peer relationships. Findings from one-way analyses of variance (ANOVAs) supported the hypotheses that students reporting high-level relational victimization report higher levels of depressive symptoms and loneliness/social dissatisfaction than students reporting low-level relational victimization. Findings from Structural Equation Modeling analyses did support the hypothesis that prosocial perceptions would moderate the relative relationships between relational <b>victimization</b> <b>and</b> depressive symptoms; <b>and</b> relational <b>victimization</b> <b>and</b> loneliness/social dissatisfaction. The hypothesis that path coefficients would be stronger for girls, was not supported. Findings supported the hypothesized protective function of prosocial perceptions in the associations among relational <b>victimization,</b> depressive symptoms, <b>and</b> loneliness/social dissatisfaction. Specifically, students reporting high-level relational <b>victimization</b> <b>and</b> high-level prosocial perceptions experienced fewer depressive symptoms and loneliness/social dissatisfaction than high-level relational victims reporting low-level prosocial perceptions. ^ The theoretical and applied implications of these findings are discussed, along with limitations of the current investigation. Finally, possible directions for future research are identified. ...|$|R

Multilevel analyses were conducted on the control group of an intervention study among students in grades 3 - 6 of Dutch elementary schools (N = 2859 students from 124 classes and 33 schools; ages 8 - 12; 49. 6 % boys).
