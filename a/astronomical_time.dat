5|$|The high {{population}} of the asteroid belt makes for a very active environment, where collisions between asteroids occur frequently (on <b>astronomical</b> <b>time</b> scales). Collisions between main-belt bodies with a mean radius of 10km are expected to occur about once every 10 million years. A collision may fragment an asteroid into numerous smaller pieces (leading {{to the formation of}} a new asteroid family). Conversely, collisions that occur at low relative speeds may also join two asteroids. After more than 4 billion years of such processes, the members of the asteroid belt now bear little resemblance to the original population.|$|E

40|$|We {{explore the}} {{statistical}} behaviour of the discrete nonlinear Schrödinger equation {{as a test}} bed for the observation of negative-temperature (i. e. above infinite temperature) states in Bose–Einstein condensates in optical lattices and arrays of optical waveguides. By monitoring the microcanonical temperature, we show that there exists a parameter region where the system evolves towards a state characterized by a finite density of discrete breathers and a negative temperature. Such a state persists over very long (<b>astronomical)</b> <b>times</b> since the convergence to equilibrium becomes increasingly slower {{as a consequence of}} a coarsening process. We also discuss two possible mechanisms for the generation of negative-temperature states in experimental setups, namely, the introduction of boundary dissipations and the free expansion of wavepackets initially in equilibrium at a positive temperature...|$|R
25|$|In 2011, Chunhao Han of the Beijing Global Information Center of Application and Exploration said China had {{not decided}} what its vote {{would be in}} January 2012, but some Chinese {{scholars}} consider it important to maintain a link between civil and <b>astronomical</b> <b>time</b> due to Chinese tradition. The 2012 vote was ultimately deferred. At an ITU/BIPM-sponsored workshop on the leap second, Dr. Han expressed his personal view in favor of abolishing the leap second, and similar support for the redefinition was again expressed by Dr. Han, along with other Chinese timekeeping scientists, at the URSI General Assembly in 2014.|$|E

The basis of all studies in this thesis lies without any doubt in extensive fieldwork.

40|$|Most {{aspects of}} energy {{metabolism}} display clear variations during day and night. This daily rhythmicity of metabolic functions, including hormone release, {{is governed by}} a circadian system that consists of the master clock in the suprachiasmatic nuclei of the hypothalamus (SCN) and many secondary clocks {{in the brain and}} peripheral organs. The SCN control peripheral timing via the autonomic and neuroendocrine system, as well as via behavioral outputs. The sleep-wake cycle, the feeding/fasting rhythm and most hormonal rhythms, including that of leptin, ghrelin and glucocorticoids, usually show an opposite phase (relative to the light-dark cycle) in diurnal and nocturnal species. By contrast, the SCN clock is most active at the same <b>astronomical</b> <b>times</b> in these two categories of mammals. Moreover, in both species, pineal melatonin is secreted only at night. In this review we describe the current knowledge on the regulation of glucose and lipid metabolism by central and peripheral clock mechanisms. Most experimental knowledge comes from studies in nocturnal laboratory rodents. Nevertheless, we will also mention some relevant findings in diurnal mammals, including humans. It will become clear that {{as a consequence of the}} tight connections between the circadian clock system and energy metabolism, circadian clock impairments (e. g., mutations or knock-out of clock genes) and circadian clock misalignments (such as during shift work and chronic jet-lag) have an adverse effect on energy metabolism, that may trigger or enhancing obese and diabetic symptom...|$|R
