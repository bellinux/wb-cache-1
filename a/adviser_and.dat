With her best friend Flounder, Ariel collects human artifacts in her grotto, and often goes {{to the surface of the}} ocean to visit Scuttle, a seagull who offers very inaccurate knowledge of human culture. She ignores the warnings of her father King Triton, the ruler of Atlantica, and Sebastian, a crab who serves as Triton's <b>adviser</b> <b>and</b> court composer, that contact between merpeople and humans is forbidden.|$|E
5|$|As part of {{the trial}} in Alexandria, six of LaRouche's {{associates}} were also found guilty. His chief fund-raiser, William Wertz, was convicted on ten mail fraud counts. LaRouche's legal <b>adviser</b> <b>and</b> treasurer, Edward Spannaus, along with fund raising operatives Dennis Small, Paul Greenberg, Michael Billington, and Joyce Rubinstein, were convicted of conspiracy to commit mail fraud. Wertz and Spannaus were sentenced to five years imprisonment each, with Spannaus serving a total of {{two and a half}} years until his release from custody. Both were fined $1,000.

Kautilya suggested employing means such as seduction, secret use of weapons, and poison for political gain. He also urged detailed precautions against assassination—tasters for food and elaborate ways to detect poison. In addition, {{the death penalty for}} violations of royal decrees was frequently administered through the use of poison.|$|E

5|$|Jan Zamoyski, one of {{the most}} {{distinguished}} personalities of the period, became the king's principal <b>adviser</b> <b>and</b> manager. A highly educated and cultivated individual, talented military chief and accomplished politician, he had often promoted himself as a tribune of his fellow szlachta. In fact in a typical magnate manner, Zamoyski accumulated multiple offices and royal land grants, removing himself far from the reform movement ideals he professed earlier.|$|E

His mentor at Van Eck, Klaus Buescher, joined Crescent as president in 1991, and they together managed the company until Buescher's death in June 1997. Since that time, Ijaz has remained active as Crescent's owner, operating it as a quantitative investment <b>adviser</b> <b>and</b> venture investing firm.|$|E
5|$|The second {{production}} by Star Film, Tjioeng Wanara {{was released on}} 18 August 1941.

It premiered to commercial success, but received mixed reviews. This black-and-white production, which was screened until at least 1948, is now thought lost.|$|E

5|$|A {{few months}} later, United Diamond Fields of British Guiana was {{incorporated}} as a limited company. The company used Oppenheimer {{as a technical}} <b>adviser,</b> <b>and</b> immediately arranged to have its diamonds sold to the syndicate. The price was to be fixed for six months, with an auditor's certificate {{at the end of}} that time used to negotiate a new price. Oppenheimer was the only one with access to the accounting information, and the rest of the company had no way of checking that his figures were correct. In the same time frame, a new deposit of diamonds was discovered in South Africa, forcing the syndicate to acquire several million pounds worth of these new diamonds to prevent their control over the market being destroyed. This strained their finances and the new diamonds forced the price down.|$|E
5|$|Class distinction, however, became linked as {{the fashion}} of female homoeroticism passed. Tribades were {{simultaneously}} considered members of the lower class trying to ruin virtuous women, and representatives of an aristocracy corrupt with debauchery. Satirical writers began to suggest that political rivals (or more often, their wives) engaged in tribadism in order to harm their reputations. Queen Anne was rumored to have a passionate relationship with Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough, her closest <b>adviser</b> <b>and</b> confidante. When Churchill was ousted as the queen's favorite, she purportedly spread allegations of the queen having affairs with her bedchamberwomen. Marie Antoinette was also the subject of such speculation for some months between 1795 and 1796.|$|E
5|$|Harper {{ran for the}} Canadian House of Commons in the 1988 federal election, {{appearing}} on the ballot as Steve Harper in Calgary West and losing {{by a wide margin}} to Hawkes, his former employer. After Reform candidate Deborah Grey was elected as the party's first MP in a 1989 by-election, Harper became Grey's executive assistant, and was her chief <b>adviser</b> <b>and</b> speechwriter until 1993. He remained prominent in the Reform Party's national organization in his role as policy chief, encouraging the party to expand beyond its Western base, and arguing that strictly regional parties were at risk of being taken over by radical elements. He delivered a speech at the Reform Party's 1991 national convention, in which he condemned extremist views.|$|E

5|$|In 1771, the Tây Sơn {{rebellion}} {{erupted from}} Bình Định Province. In 1777, {{the last of}} the Nguyễn lords was deposed and killed. His nephew Nguyen Phuc Anh was the most senior member of the Nguyễn family to have survived the Tây Sơn victory and conquest of Saigon in 1777. Nguyễn Ánh fled to Hà Tiên in the far south of the country, where he met Pigneau de Behaine, a French priest who became his <b>adviser</b> <b>and</b> played a large part in his rise to power. Over the next few decades, there were continuous attacks and counterattacks by both sides and Saigon changed hands frequently. Eventually, Nguyễn Ánh was forced him into exile. The Tây Sơn regularly raided the rice growing areas of the south during the harvesting season, confiscating the Nguyễns' supply of food.|$|E
5|$|In late March 1889, {{just as the}} izinDuna {{were about}} to leave London, Rhodes arrived to make the {{amalgamation}} with Cawston and Gifford official. To the amalgamators' dismay, the Colonial Office had received protests against the Rudd Concession {{from a number of}} London businessmen and humanitarian societies, and had resolved that it could not sanction the concession because of its equivocal nature, as well as the fact that Lobengula had announced its suspension. Rhodes was originally angry with Maund, accusing him of responsibility for this, but eventually accepted that it was not Maund's fault. Rhodes told Maund to go back to Bulawayo, to pose as an impartial <b>adviser,</b> <b>and</b> to try to sway the king back in favour of the concession; as an added contingency, he told Maund to secure as many new subconcessions as he could.|$|E

5|$|Most {{official}} {{records show}} Davies's birth date as November 1886, {{but he is}} widely {{thought to have been}} born at least four years earlier. After leaving school aged 12 and working for some years in local pits, Davies studied mining engineering and later took an Arts degree at University College, Cardiff. He returned to the coalfields in 1913, and established a reputation for militancy. In 1918 he was elected miners' agent for the Dowlais district of the South Wales Miners' Federation (SWMF), and in 1924 was appointed SWMF's chief organiser, legal <b>adviser,</b> <b>and</b> vice-president. After a visit to Moscow in 1922 he became a firm advocate of the Soviet Union, a position he maintained {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E
5|$|Plante finally {{retired from}} hockey in 1975, {{after the death}} of his {{youngest}} son. He moved to Switzerland with his second wife, Raymonde Udrisard, but remained active on the North American hockey scene as an analyst, <b>adviser,</b> <b>and</b> goaltender trainer. He was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1978. In the fall of 1985, Plante was diagnosed with terminal stomach cancer. He died in a Geneva hospital in February 1986 and was buried in Sierre, Switzerland. When his coffin was carried from the church following the funeral mass, it passed under an arch of hockey sticks held high by a team of young hockey players from Quebec, visiting Switzerland for a tournament.|$|E
5|$|The first {{occasion}} was on 8 September 1943, on {{the afternoon}} after Stimson discovered {{that he was the}} chairman. The first meeting established a Technical Subcommittee chaired by Major General Wilhelm D. Styer. Because the Americans did not want Akers on the Technical Subcommittee due to his ICI background, Llewellin nominated Chadwick, whom he also wanted to be Head of the British Mission to the Manhattan Project. The other members were Richard C. Tolman, who was Groves's scientific <b>adviser,</b> <b>and</b> C. J. Mackenzie, the president of the Canadian National Research Council. It was agreed that the Technical Committee could act without consulting the Combined Policy Committee whenever its decision was unanimous. The Technical Subcommittee held its first meeting on 10 September, but negotiations dragged on. The Combined Policy Committee ratified the proposals in December 1943, by which time several British scientists had already commenced working on the Manhattan Project in the United States.|$|E
