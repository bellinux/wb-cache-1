He started a chess boom {{not only in the}} United States and in the Western hemisphere, but worldwide. Teaching chess or playing chess <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>career</b> had truly become a respectable profession. After Bobby, the game was simply not the same.|$|E
5|$|With the {{military}} reforms of Gaius Marius in 107 BC, designed to combat {{a shortage of}} manpower due to wars against Jugurtha, the different classes of units were disbanded entirely. The wealth and age requirements were scrapped. Now soldiers would join <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>career,</b> rather than as service to the city, and would all be equipped as heavy infantry with the same, state purchased equipment.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of August, Hansen injured his shoulder and was optioned to Jersey City in favor of Sal Maglie, where he appeared in five games (1–3, 7.31 ERA). After serving seven months in the military, Hansen asked the team to voluntarily retire him in early 1946 due to his father's severe illness. He did not appear in a game at any level during the 1946 season, but stated {{that he did not}} plan to give up baseball <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>career.</b>|$|E

5|$|At this time, Ueno Hikoma and Horie Kuwajirō also {{received}} photographic instruction from Rossier. Apparently Ueno had {{originally intended to}} learn not only the practice of photography but also the manufacture of cameras. The encounter with Rossier seems to have convinced Ueno to pursue photography <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>career,</b> {{but he was so}} overwhelmed by the technology of the camera that he quickly dropped the notion of making one himself. Within a few months, he and Horie had purchased a French camera and chemicals, thereafter launching their independent photographic careers.|$|E
5|$|Boyd {{was born}} in Plaistow, Essex. He played for the West Ham Schools team {{alongside}} Ken Green, who was later to be a Birmingham teammate, and as a youth played for Ilford F.C. The outbreak of the Second World War when Boyd was 15 delayed his entry into football <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>career.</b> He joined the Royal Navy, and while serving in Malta was spotted playing for a Navy team by a Plymouth Argyle supporter, who recommended him to the club. After a trial, Boyd signed professional forms in December 1945.|$|E
5|$|Despite Gray {{constantly}} seeking {{collectors and}} {{people to help}} him with the Harvard herbarium, in the first fifteen years he was at Harvard, no graduate entered botany <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>career.</b> This changed in 1858 with the arrival of Daniel Cady Eaton, who had graduated from Yale University in 1857 and came to Harvard to study with Gray. Eaton later returned to Yale to be a botany professor and oversee its herbarium, just as Gray did at Harvard. Daniel Eaton was the grandson of Amos Eaton, whose textbooks Gray had studied during his college days. Eaton influenced the teaching style of Gray, and both required practical work of their students. Gray retained the Fisher post until 1873 while living in the Asa Gray House.|$|E

5|$|Fielding first {{produced}} a play in February 1728. Although his first production, Love in Several Masques, {{lasted only a}} few nights, it {{was the start of}} his career in theatre. On 16 March 1728, Fielding enrolled at the University of Leyden, but he did not abandon the theatre. His early plays were those of an amateur hobby, but he later returned to London to earn a living. Arthur Murphy, in his 1762 biographical introduction to Fielding's works, believed that Fielding returned to London and treated the theatre <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>career</b> because his father stopped an allowance of 200 pounds a year.|$|E
5|$|From the {{beginning}} of the IIHF World Championships in 1920, Canada would send a senior amateur club team, usually the previous year's Allan Cup champion, to compete as the Canadian entry. These teams were often university players, or unpaid players playing ice hockey while being employed in some other profession full-time. From the 1920s until the 1950s, Canadian amateur club teams won most of the World Championship and Olympic titles. <b>As</b> <b>a</b> <b>career,</b> Canadian players would play instead in the various professional hockey leagues, the best reaching the NHL. Their professional status made them ineligible to play in the World Championships or Olympics under the rules of the time. The last Canadian amateur club to win the world championship was the Trail Smoke Eaters in 1961.|$|E

The couple would have four children, one of whom died in infancy. He resumed working at his uncle's business and eventually became a director of the company. However, rather than pursue bookkeeping <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>career,</b> he commenced legal studies. He qualified as a solicitor in 1907, becoming a partner in a Carterton practice which he had joined the previous year.|$|E

Thomas' {{goal was to}} provide a {{comprehensive}} education to hip-hop dancers that was comparable to what ballet, modern, and jazz dancers experience at their respective institutions. HHDC provides a formal curriculum with dance classes (breaking, freestyle, locking, etc.) and academic classes (dance theory, physiology, kinesiology, etc.) to people who want to pursue hip-hop dance <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>career.</b> It is the only educational institution in the United States that is exclusively dedicated to hip-hop dance instruction. HHDC does not grant degrees. It is a non-profit organization and repertory company that grants certifications to dancers that complete the three-year program.|$|E

Stanford tried unsuccessfully for a classics scholarship at Trinity Hall, Cambridge, but gained an organ scholarship, and later a classics scholarship, at Queens' College. By the time {{he went up to}} Cambridge in 1870 he had written a substantial number of compositions, including vocal music, both sacred and secular, and orchestral works (a rondo for cello and orchestra and a concert overture).|$|E
5|$|Neil Hamilton Fairley {{was born}} in Inglewood, Victoria, on 15 July 1891, as the third of six sons of James Fairley, a bank manager, and his wife Margaret Louisa, née Jones.

A second also qualified as a Doctor of Medicine at the University of Melbourne, and later as an FRACP and FRCP; he became senior physician at Royal Melbourne Hospital. A third son became a general practitioner.|$|E
5|$|On {{his return}} to Ohio, the degree from a prestigious Eastern school made Garfield a man of distinction. He {{returned}} to Hiram to teach at the Institute, and in 1857 was made its president. He did not see education as a field that would realize his full potential. At Williams, he had become more politically aware in the intensely anti-slavery atmosphere of the Massachusetts school, and began to consider politics <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>career.</b> In 1858, he married Lucretia; they would have seven children, five of whom survived infancy. Soon after the wedding, he formally entered his name to read law at a Cleveland firm, although he did his studying in Hiram. He {{was admitted to the}} bar in 1861.|$|E

5|$|She was not {{the first}} woman balloonist. On 20 May 1784, the Marchioness and Countess of Montalembert, the Countess of Podenas and a Miss de Lagarde had taken a trip on a {{tethered}} balloon in Paris. Neither was she the first woman to ascend in an untethered balloon: in Blanchard's time, Citoyenne Henri, who had made an ascent with André-Jacques Garnerin in 1798, was widely credited with that ballooning first, although the honour actually belonged to Elizabeth Thible. Thible, an opera singer, had made an ascent to entertain Gustav III of Sweden in Lyon on 4 June 1784, fourteen years before Citoyenne Henri. Blanchard was, however, the first woman to pilot her own balloon and the first to adopt ballooning <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>career.</b>|$|E
5|$|Since the {{favourite}} {{sport for}} the people of Calcutta was the game of football, Ganguly was initially attracted to the game.
