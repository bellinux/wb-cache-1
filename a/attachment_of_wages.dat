30|$|As a first main {{result of}} the study, we find no {{significant}} wage differences between subsidized and similar unsubsidized workers, and the difference in individual wage changes is mostly insignificant as well. Thus for Germany, our study does not obtain evidence of rent-sharing between workers and firms to exploit the schemes under consideration, or for comparatively low wages in subsidized jobs. These results differ from those obtained in studies of North American wage subsidy schemes. It seems that wage effects of wage subsidies seem to hinge crucially {{on the design of}} the subsidy scheme and on the institutional setting. Our main explanation for similar short-run wages of subsidized and unsubsidized workers is that the German system of wage setting is shaped by collective contracts and an <b>attachment</b> <b>of</b> <b>wages</b> to jobs rather than to individual abilities: The ubiquity of collective contracts implies that lower or higher wages for subsidized workers than for unsubsidized workers within similar jobs and within the same firm might first not be feasible (if the firm is covered by a collective contract and the worker is unionized) and second and even more important, be assessed as not acceptable or unfair, respectively, by workers, firms' management and also by caseworkers. This should hold in particular regarding wage-undercutting because subsidized jobs are on average rather low-wage jobs. Furthermore, the German scheme did not involve vouchers, which might have helped to avoid stigma effects.|$|E
40|$|<b>Attachment</b> <b>of</b> <b>wage</b> {{as a way}} for {{creditors}} {{to enforce}} payment by unwilling or insolvent debtors is not very successful in several countries. Based on a dynamic model of debtor behaviour, this paper explores two alternatives of reform. One is to reduce the rate <b>of</b> <b>attachment,</b> which at present amounts to 100 percent <b>of</b> the <b>wage</b> income exceeding the subsistence level, thus probably destroying incentives to work. According to model simulations, reducing the attachment rate is likely to result in an increase of labour supply but a decrease <b>of</b> <b>attachment</b> revenue per period. Second, the introduction of a debt release would have an ambiguous effect on labour supply. While resulting in a partial loss for creditors, it would permit debtors to get out of debt. A Pareto improvement thus {{does not seem to be}} possible. When taking the taxpayers as an involved third party into account, however, a potential Pareto improvement appears attainable. debt, insolvency, <b>attachment</b> <b>of</b> <b>wage,</b> subsistence level...|$|R

There were a number of other aids to judgment-debt collection in the system: for example, property <b>attachment</b> and garnishment <b>of</b> <b>wages.</b> In any event, the system was so clearly inconsistent with the right to freedom protected by section 11(1) of the Constitution, and so manifestly indefensible under section 33(1) of the Constitution, that there was no warrant for its retention, even temporarily.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the economic {{effects of the}} end of mandatory retirement. It takes advantage of the unique variation in institutions affecting retirement behavior to study the change in labor force participation, job <b>attachment</b> and <b>wages</b> <b>of</b> older workers from the 1970 s to the 1990 s. In the 1970 s, about 40 % of male employees in the US were covered by rules mandating retirement at age 65. Then, in 1978 and 1986, mandatory retirement was abolished by stepwise amendments of the federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act. To mimic the ideal experiment offered by the change in legislation, I impute coverage of mandatory retirement to data from the monthly Current Population Survey and compare labor force trends for workers with high- and low-probabilities of coverage before and after the change. The results indicate that workers covered by mandatory retirement had a very high incidence of retirement at age 65, which declined significantly following the elimination of mandatory retirement. Overall, the results suggest that the labor force of workers 65 and older rose by 10 % to 20 % with the end of mandatory retirement. Neither job tenure nor wage-profiles of older workers were affected by the change...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{new evidence}} about wage stickiness {{and the nature}} <b>of</b> <b>wage</b> setting. We use a unique micro dataset on monthly frequency, covering wages in the Icelandic private sector for the period from 1998 - 2010, and draw the following conclusions. First, the mean frequency <b>of</b> <b>wage</b> change is 10. 8 % per month. When weighted for heterogeneity across industries and occupations the result is almost identical; the frequency of change is 10. 5 % per month. Second, only 0. 5 % <b>of</b> monthly <b>wage</b> changes are decreases. Third, the mean duration <b>of</b> <b>wage</b> spells is 8. 9 months. Onefifth <b>of</b> <b>wage</b> spells last longer than a year while other spells last for one year or shorter. Fourth, wage setting displays strong features of time-dependence: half <b>of</b> all <b>wage</b> changes are synchronised in January, but other adjustments are staggered through the year. Fifth, there is limited evidence of state-dependence: frequency <b>of</b> <b>wage</b> increases, size <b>of</b> increases, frequency <b>of</b> <b>wage</b> decreases and size of decreases do not correlate with inflation. However, both frequency and size <b>of</b> <b>wage</b> decreases have significant correlation with unemployment. Sixth, the hazard function for wages is mostly flat during the first months but has a large twelve-month spike. These facts align with a model <b>of</b> time-dependent <b>wage</b> contracts <b>of</b> fixed duration. ...|$|R
