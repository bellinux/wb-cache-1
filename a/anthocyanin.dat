In this work, the purification process parameters of S. chinensis <b>anthocyanins</b> using a macroporous resin and gel filtration chromatography were evaluated. The optimized parameters of static adsorption and desorption were as follows. The selected resin is HPD- 300 (nonpolar copolymer styrene type resin), and the <b>anthocyanins</b> adsorption saturation capacity of HPD- 300 resin was 0. 475 mg/g dry resin. Adsorption time was 4 h, and 0. 517 mg/mL of S. chinensis <b>anthocyanins</b> was adsorbed on the resin column with a flow rate of 39 mL/h (3 BV/h). After adsorption, the <b>anthocyanins</b> were completely desorpted with 2. 5 BV of 90 % (v/v) ethanol solution, and the desorption flow rate was 13 mL/h (1 BV/h).
