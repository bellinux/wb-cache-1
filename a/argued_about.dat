5|$|The match {{ended when}} Lex Luger and Bret Hart {{simultaneously}} eliminated each other. Two referees <b>argued</b> <b>about</b> who had landed first while several inconclusive camera angles were broadcast. Eventually, WWF President Jack Tunney {{came to the}} ring and had Finkel announce that both men would be considered winners. The situation regarding the title shot at WrestleMania X, {{which was to be}} given to the winner, remained unresolved until the following week on Monday Night Raw.|$|E
5|$|Bache's major {{accomplishment}} was {{the establishment}} of Liszt's music in England, to which he selflessly devoted himself between 1865 and his death in 1888. This was {{at the height of}} the War of the Romantics, when conservative and liberal musical factions openly <b>argued</b> <b>about</b> the future of classical music and the merits of the compositions written in their respective schools. Bache featured several of the orchestral and choral works through an annual series of concerts, which he single-handedly funded, organised and promoted. Likewise, he played an annual series of solo recitals that incorporated Liszt's piano music.|$|E
5|$|Her {{position}} {{changed the}} following month. She {{had had a}} series of rows with Bamber. He seemed to want to end the relationship, and they had <b>argued</b> <b>about</b> his involvement in the murders. She told him he was a psychopath and at one point tried to smother him with a pillow. During one argument on 4 September, another woman telephoned Bamber in her presence, and it became clear to Mugford that he had been seeing that woman too. Mugford smashed a mirror, slapped Bamber and he twisted her arm up her back. Three days later she went to the police and changed her statement.|$|E

5|$|Since {{the very}} beginning, Danes have <b>argued</b> <b>about</b> the precise place of {{photography}} in society. In 1839, Crown Prince Frederik deposited Falbe's daguerreotypes with Ørsted, {{the secretary of}} the Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters, despite the fact that Daguerre, the inventor, was an artist. In 1842, the artist Johan Frederik Møller was refused a grant from the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts for studying photography in France {{on the grounds that it}} was not an art. Photographers came within neither the scope of the Academy of Sciences nor that of the Academy of Fine Arts but were regarded as manual workers.|$|E
5|$|This {{policy was}} {{realized}} as NSC-68, a classified report {{issued by the}} United States National Security Council in April 1950 and written by Paul Nitze, Kennan's successor as director of policy planning. Kennan and Charles Bohlen, another State Department expert on Russia, <b>argued</b> <b>about</b> the wording of NSC-68, which became the basis of Cold War policy. Kennan rejected the idea that Stalin had a grand design for world conquest implicit in Nitze's report and argued that he actually feared overextending Russian power. Kennan even argued that NSC-68 {{should not have been}} drafted at all, as it would make U.S. policies too rigid, simplistic, and militaristic. Acheson overruled Kennan and Bohlen, endorsing the assumption of Soviet menace implied by NSC-68.|$|E
5|$|Clyde began 1974 {{season with}} a 3–0 record, but became embroiled in {{controversy}} following a dispute between new manager Billy Martin and general manager Bobby Brown. Martin and Brown <b>argued</b> <b>about</b> what {{was the best way}} on handling Clyde's future development, which led to Brown's resignation and caused Clyde to miss a month before remaining on the Rangers roster {{for the rest of the}} year. He played in 28 games (21 starts) and finished with 3–9 record, and a 4.38 ERA. He started one game in 1975 (a loss) before injuring his shoulder and was demoted to the Pittsfield Rangers of the Eastern League. He stayed in the minors for three seasons, having a shoulder operation in 1976. The Rangers organization lost so much faith in Clyde's ability that he was left unprotected in the 1976 Major League Baseball expansion draft, but was not chosen. He played for the Sacramento Solons in 1976, and the Tucson Toros of the Pacific Coast League in 1977 where he had 5–7 record with a 5.84 ERA. When the season ended, the Rangers traded Clyde and veteran Willie Horton to the Cleveland Indians for Tom Buskey and John Lowenstein on February 28, 1978.|$|E

Veronica talks to Dick, who {{presents}} a different account of events, saying that he didn't drug her and that he found Beaver with Veronica already. Veronica approaches Beaver, who gives a set of events more {{similar to that of}} Sean. However, after Dick and Sean leave, he purports to have run away and vomited before he could bring himself to rape her. Keith says that he has to leave for an engagement in Vegas. Logan talks to Aaron, but Aaron does not even know Logan's birth date. Veronica talks to Carrie Bishop (Leighton Meester), who says that she saw Veronica having sex with Duncan. Veronica confronts Duncan, who denies the rape accusations and remembers comforting Veronica in her drugged state. Duncan says that the sex was consensual even though he knew that they were siblings, confirming Veronica's fears. Veronica talks to Wallace about the events but says that she is content with the answers she has. Keith calls a prostitute in Vegas for an unknown reason, while Veronica apologizes to Logan and tells her about the situation with Duncan. Back in Vegas, Keith talks to the prostitute, Cheyenne, about Abel Koontz, as Cheyenne and Koontz were together at the time of Lilly's murder. Veronica and Logan go into his darkened house before they realize that Aaron throws a surprise party for him, meaning that virtually the entire high school knows that they are dating.|$|E

In fact, during his lifetime, neither pagan nor Christian ideology reigned supreme, and the greatest thinkers of the day <b>argued</b> <b>about</b> the merits and rationality of each religion. Most importantly for the pagan cause, though, Rome was still a predominantly pagan empire that had not wholly accepted Christianity.|$|E
25|$|The 1930s {{economic}} {{debate between}} LSE and Cambridge {{is well known}} in academic circles. Rivalry between academic opinion at LSE and Cambridge goes back to the school's roots when LSE's Edwin Cannan (1861–1935), Professor of Economics, and Cambridge's Professor of Political Economy, Alfred Marshall (1842–1924), the leading economist of the day, <b>argued</b> <b>about</b> the bedrock matter of economics and whether the subject should be considered as an organic whole.

25|$|Deck and his {{attorneys}} also <b>argued</b> <b>about</b> {{the burden of}} proof. Deck’s counsel believed that the bias created by the shackles put {{the burden of proof}} on Deck and not the state. The defense argued that the state could not prove that the shackles did no harm. Ultimately, the defense felt that the shackling of Deck was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, meaning shackling made a difference in the decision that the jury made. The defense argued that this alone was a violation against the constitution and due process.|$|E

25|$|The study Neural Activity Predicts Attitude Change in Cognitive Dissonance (2009) {{identified}} the neural bases of cognitive dissonance with functional {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI); the neural scans of the participants replicated the basic findings of the induced-compliance paradigm. When in the fMRI scanner, some of the study participants argued that the uncomfortable, mechanical environment of the MRI machine nevertheless was a pleasant experience for them; some participants, from an experimental group, said they enjoyed the mechanical environment of the fMRI scanner more than did the control-group participants (paid actors) who <b>argued</b> <b>about</b> the uncomfortable experimental environment.|$|E
25|$|As time passed, Tarlton {{began to}} lose some of its importance. The state capital was moved from nearby Chillicothe (its last {{location}} outside Columbus) to Columbus, Ohio in 1816, and the National Road (present U.S. Route 40 or more roughly Interstate 70) went {{through the center of}} Ohio. This road started at Baltimore and ending in Illinois. So, the focus of commerce in Ohio shifted from the communities along Zane's Trace {{to the center of the}} state. Among the cities the National Road crossed was Springfield, Ohio, where it arrived in 1836 and stopped for ten years while lawmakers <b>argued</b> <b>about</b> where it would go from there. Located at that terminus, Springfield especially boomed during those ten years.|$|E
25|$|In March Johnson {{decided to}} {{restrict}} future bombing {{with the result}} that 90 percent of North Vietnam's population and 75 percent of its territory was off-limits to bombing. In April he succeeded in opening discussions of peace talks and after extensive negotiations over the site, Paris was agreed to and talks began in May. When the talks failed to yield any results {{the decision was made to}} resort to private discussions in Paris. Two months later it was apparent that private discussions proved to be no more productive. Despite recommendations in August from Harriman, Vance, Clifford and Bundy to halt bombing as an incentive for Hanoi to seriously engage in substantive peace talks, Johnson refused. In October when the parties came close to an agreement on a bombing halt, Republican presidential nominee Richard Nixon intervened with the South Vietnamese, and made promises of better terms, so as to delay a settlement on the issue until after the election. After the election, Johnson's primary focus on Vietnam was to get Saigon to join the Paris peace talks. Ironically, only after Nixon added his urging did they do so. Even then they <b>argued</b> <b>about</b> procedural matters until after Nixon took office.|$|E
