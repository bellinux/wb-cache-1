5|$|Along with Davis' {{other records}} during the 1970s, Dark Magus was {{received}} ambivalently by contemporary critics, but it inspired noise rock acts {{during the late}} 1970s and the experimental funk artists of the 1980s. The album was not released in the United States until July 1997, when it was reissued by Sony Records and Legacy Records. In retrospective reviews, critics praised its jazz-rock <b>aesthetic</b> <b>and</b> the group members' performances, and some believed certain parts foreshadowed jungle music.|$|E
5|$|Although van der Weyden did not {{adhere to}} the {{conventions}} of idealisation, he generally sought to flatter his sitters. He depicted his models in highly fashionable clothing, often with rounded—almost sculpted—facial features, some of which deviated from natural representation. He adapted his own <b>aesthetic,</b> <b>and</b> his portraits of women often bear {{a striking resemblance to}} each other.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. As the {{essential}} public assets for sustainable development, Highway should provide for people {{not only the}} enjoyment of convenient and safe transportation, but also the fulfillment of visual pleasure <b>and</b> <b>aesthetic</b> appeal. Taking the highway as the <b>aesthetic</b> object <b>and</b> making the research in <b>aesthetic</b> perception <b>and</b> the process of psychological experience of the aesthetic subject are of great importance to highway landscape planning <b>and</b> design. The <b>aesthetic</b> subject <b>and</b> object of highway landscape are defined and their {{relationship between the two}} is explored based on the analysis of characteristics and principles of highway aesthetics in the paper. And the conception of the highway landscape aesthetic field is also introduced. In view of the aesthetic characteristics of highway landscape, the aesthetic process is studied in detail from three phrases of <b>aesthetic</b> expectation <b>and</b> <b>aesthetic</b> attention, <b>aesthetic</b> expansion <b>and</b> <b>aesthetic</b> perception, <b>and</b> <b>aesthetic</b> dispersion. Taking Guangdong Fokai highway for example, the aesthetic psychological expanding process of highway landscape is finally analyzed...|$|R

5|$|The Wellington bypass was {{constructed}} by contractor M. J. Gleeson Ltd, from 1973 to 1975.

The <b>aesthetic</b> <b>and</b> constructional design of the bridges was also heavily criticised. Over the next 15 years, almost all of the original carriageway had to be replaced with asphalt.|$|E
5|$|Glam metal lost {{mainstream}} {{interest in}} the early 1990s as the perceived excesses of glam metal created a backlash against the genre. A factor in the decline of glam metal was the rise of grunge in the early 1990s, which had a stripped-down <b>aesthetic</b> <b>and</b> a complete rejection of the glam metal visual style. Glam metal has enjoyed a revival since the late 1990s with reunions of many popular acts from the genre's 1980s heyday, {{as well as the}} retro styling of newer bands including The Darkness from Lowestoft, the United Kingdom, Santa Cruz from Helsinki, Finland, and Steel Panther from Los Angeles, America.|$|E
5|$|Hanging scroll: Hanging scrolls {{originated}} in their earliest form from literature and other texts written on bamboo strips and silk banners in ancient China. The earliest hanging scrolls {{are related to}} and developed from silk banners in early Chinese history. These banners were long and hung vertically on walls. Such silk banners and hanging scroll paintings were found at Mawangdui {{dating back to the}} Han Dynasty (206 BCE – 220 CE). By the time of the Tang Dynasty (618–907), the <b>aesthetic</b> <b>and</b> structural objectives for hanging scrolls were summarized, which are still followed to this day. During the early Song Dynasty (960–1279), the scrolls became well suited to the art styles of the artists, consequently hanging scrolls were made in many different sizes and proportions.|$|E

Nevertheless, onion domes are popularly believed to symbolise burning candles. In 1917, noted religious philosopher Prince Yevgeny Trubetskoy argued that the onion shape of Russian church domes may not be explained rationally. According to Trubetskoy, drums crowned by tapering domes were deliberately scored to resemble candles, thus manifesting a certain <b>aesthetic</b> <b>and</b> religious attitude. Another explanation {{has it that the}} onion dome was originally regarded as a form reminiscent of the edicula (cubiculum) in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem.|$|E

The review also reflects on the impact of “postmodernism” on aesthetics within marketing.

5|$|The <b>aesthetic</b> <b>and</b> {{technical}} {{mastery of}} Borobudur, and also its sheer size, has evoked {{the sense of}} grandeur and pride for Indonesians. Just like Angkor Wat for Cambodian, Borobudur has become a powerful symbol for Indonesia — to testify for its past greatness. Sukarno {{made a point of}} showing the site to foreign dignitaries. The Suharto regime — realized its important symbolic and economic meanings — diligently embarked on a massive project to restore the monument with the help from UNESCO. Many museums in Indonesia contain a scale model replica of Borobudur. The monument has become almost an icon, grouped with the wayang puppet play and gamelan music into a vague classical Javanese past from which Indonesians are to draw inspiration.|$|E

In addition, more general changes have taken place in Western societies, due to technological development, new economic realities, political changes etc. However, these diverse aesthetic expressions are also a reflection of individual architects and industrial designers’ personal expression, based on designers’ tendency to experiment with form, materials, and ornament to create new <b>aesthetic</b> styles <b>and</b> <b>aesthetic</b> vocabulary. Changes in <b>aesthetic</b> styles <b>and</b> expressions have been, and still are, both synchronic and diachronic, as different aesthetic styles are produced and promoted simultaneously.|$|R
