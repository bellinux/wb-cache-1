System engineering {{is no exception}} to this trend, with ontologies being proposed {{as a basis for}} several tasks in complex industrial implements, including system design, monitoring and diagnosis. In this paper, we consider four different contributions to system engineering wherein ontologies are instrumental to provide enhancements over traditional ad-hoc techniques. For each application, we briefly report the methodologies, the tools and the results obtained with the goal to provide an <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>merits</b> and limits of ontologies in such domains...|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} {{constitutes}} {{a step toward}} the understanding, and eventual optimization, of the spray quenching process for aluminum extrusions. A spray quenching test bed was constructed to simulate an industrial spray quench. This experimental facility allowed for the testing of irregular shapes using up to eight water sprays. Quenching experiments were conducted using flat water sprays in two different con-figurations with an L-shape testpiece constructed from commercially pure aluminum AI 1100 -O. Section thickness and spray configuration were found to {{have a significant effect on}} the cooling rate and cooling uniformity. The commercially pure aluminum A 11100 -O L-shape and a similar L-shape constructed from aluminum alloy 2024 -T 6 were simulated with a two-dimensional finite-element code and spray correla-tions available from previous studies.

40|$|Driven by a {{combination}} of flat lining revenues and an explosive growth in the mobile data traffic and hence the need for network resources, mobile operators consider infrastructure-and spectrum sharing as a means to reduce operational costs. We develop and apply an assessment approach to quantify the benefits associated with spectrum sharing in an infrastructure-shared environment, and estimate the evolution of the derived 'spectrum sharing dividend' as traffic loads, radio access technologies, spectrum availability and performance targets change over time. The obtained insights can assist operators and regulators in their <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> the <b>merit</b> <b>of</b> spectrum sharing.

40|$|One {{important}} bias {{economists and}} psychologists have identified is the lock-in effect. The lock-in effect causes a decision maker who must revisit an earlier {{decision to be}} locked in to that earlier decision. The effect is particularly pronounced where the earlier decision led to the investment of resources that cannot be recovered. Although lock-in does not prevent the decision maker from altering course, it does introduce a systemic bias that {{should be taken into}} account. Preliminary injunctions require judges to assess the <b>merits</b> <b>of</b> a case at an early stage and then revisit the merits later. In the early stages of a case, the facts or legal arguments may not be fully developed or the decision may be rushed, leading to a significant risk that the preliminary <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> the <b>merits</b> will be incorrect. Where irreparable harm occurs {{as a result of the}} denial of a preliminary injunction, the judge will face strong motivation to validate his earlier <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> the <b>merits,</b> even in the face of new evidence or upon further reflection. In Winter v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., the U. S. Supreme Court recently called into question the appropriate standard for deciding preliminary injunctions. In that case, the Court announced a broad statement of the standard without considering the variety of tests that lower courts have developed. As those courts reassess their test in light of the Winter decision, they should ensure that the preliminary injunction standard avoids the potential for lock-in. A flexible standard for issuing preliminary injunctions that employs a balancing test and requires plaintiffs to show only “serious questions” on the merits will achieve the purposes of a preliminary injunction while avoiding the risk of lock-in...|$|R
