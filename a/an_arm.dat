Minor controversy was sparked by Mustaine's announcement that Megadeth would not play certain songs live due to his new identification as a Christian. In May 2005, Mustaine allegedly threatened to cancel shows in Greece and Israel with extreme metal bands Rotting Christ and Dissection due to the bands' anti-Christian beliefs. This caused the two bands to cancel appearances.|$|E

50|$|International law recognizes a {{right of}} self-defence, as the International Court of Justice (ICJ) affirmed in the Nicaragua Case {{on the use of}} force. Some {{commentators}} believe that the effect of Article 51 is only to preserve this right when <b>an</b> <b>armed</b> attack occurs, and that other acts of self-defence are banned by article 2(4). The more widely held opinion is that article 51 acknowledges this general right, and proceeds to lay down procedures for the specific situation when <b>an</b> <b>armed</b> attack does occur. Under the latter interpretation, the legitimate use of self-defence in situations when <b>an</b> <b>armed</b> attack has not actually occurred is still permitted. It is also to be noted that not every act of violence will constitute <b>an</b> <b>armed</b> attack.

In the north half of that interchange, SR57 enters the San Jose Hills, climbing to its highest elevation before descending back into the connected San Gabriel and Pomona Valleys and ending at the Glendora Curve interchange with the Foothill Freeway (I-210) in Glendora.|$|E
5|$|After {{the lineup}} stabilized, the band {{released}} {{a number of}} platinum-selling albums, including Rust in Peace (1990) and Countdown to Extinction (1992).

Ellefson settled with Mustaine out of court and rejoined the group in 2010. Megadeth has hosted its own music festival, Gigantour, several times since mid-2005.|$|E

5|$|Ammianus {{is silent}} about archers on the Alamanni side. The Germans almost {{certainly}} did not have mounted archers, as this was <b>an</b> <b>arm</b> that evolved in the East and in any case, their longbows are unsuitable for use on horseback. As for the infantry, the archery capability of the Rhine Germans has traditionally been seen as negligible, due to the 6th-century writer Agathias's comment that the Franks {{did not know how}} to use bows. But this is contradicted by the archaeological record and by Ammianus himself in other parts of his account. It is virtually certain that there were a significant number of Alamanni foot archers at Strasbourg.|$|E

It was also said that, despite her connection with Smith, police and four pathologists had failed to establish that Lynott had been murdered. The inquest jury returned an open verdict.|$|E

Lebrón recovered in a satisfactory manner and issued a press release in appreciation for the public's support. Complications from this episode of bronchitis, however, persisted throughout 2010, leading to her death on August 1, 2010. Multiple public figures, who support independence or free association for Puerto Rico, immediately lamented Lebrón's death, praising her activism. Her life was eulogized even in European papers.|$|E
