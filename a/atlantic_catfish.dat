50|$|The Atlantic {{wolffish}} (Anarhichas lupus), {{also known}} as the seawolf, <b>Atlantic</b> <b>catfish,</b> ocean catfish, devil fish, wolf eel (the common name for its Pacific relative), woof or sea cat, is a marine fish of the wolffish family Anarhichadidae. The numbers of the Atlantic wolffish are rapidly being depleted, most likely due to overfishing and bycatch, and is currently a Species of Concern according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Marine Fisheries Service.|$|E
40|$|International audienceHepatic microsomes and cytosols of channel <b>catfish</b> (), {{rainbow trout}} (), <b>Atlantic</b> salmon (), red tilapia (.), largemouth bass (), striped bass (), hybrid striped bass (x), and {{bluegill}} () (n = 8) {{were used to}} study the kinetics of phase I (ECOD, EROD, PROD, BROD) and phase II (UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UDPGT) -, sulfotransferase (ST) - and glutathione-s-transferase (GST) - mediated) reactions. The best catalytic efficiency for ECOD and GST activities was performed by channel <b>catfish,</b> <b>Atlantic</b> salmon, rainbow trout and tilapia. The highest EROD catalytic efficiency was for Atlantic salmon. None of the species had either PROD or BROD activities. Rainbow trout had very similar UDPGT catalytic efficiency to tilapia, channel <b>catfish,</b> <b>Atlantic</b> salmon, largemouth bass and bluegill. Sulfotransferase conjugation had no significant differences among the species. In summary, tilapia, channel <b>catfish,</b> <b>Atlantic</b> salmon and rainbow trout had the best biotranforming capabilities; striped bass, hybrid striped bass and bluegill were low metabolizers and largemouth bass shared some capabilities with both groups...|$|R

40|$|Although {{fish farming}} has been practiced for 4, 000 years, {{aquaculture}} research dates back only to about 1, 870, whereas molecular techniques, {{in addition to}} the more traditional methods of biotechnology, were introduced only recently. Contemporary genomic approaches (often adapted from human or medical research) such as cDNA cloning and sequencing, cDNA microarray/expression analysis, and functional genomics, combined with improvements in transgenic technologies, have enhanced possibilities for aquacultural biotechnologists for improving fish growth rates and increasing resistance to pathogens and stressors. Although genomic technologies in fish have been applied primarily to model organisms, such as zebrafish (Danio rerio), fugu or pufferfish (Tetraodon nigroviridis), and medaka (Oryzias latipes), many teleosts of interest for biological research and with potential application in aquaculture have unique physiological characteristics that cannot be directly investigated from the study of small laboratory fish models. As a consequence, large-scale genomic research studies are increasingly being applied to farmed species of economic relevance, such as farmed rainbow trout, <b>Atlantic</b> salmon, tilapia, <b>catfish,</b> and sea bass. Accordingly, we describe the utilization of molecular cloning and gene expression analysis in cultured European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) to generate "transcriptome-focused" information which may enable {{a better understanding of the}} transcriptional programs that underlie fish respiratory physiology and immune response pathways...|$|R
40|$|The {{mononuclear}} phagocyte {{system is}} composed of monocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells and has crucial roles in inflammation, autoimmunity, infection, cancer, organ transplantation and in maintaining organismal homeostasis. Interleukin- 34 (IL- 34) and macrophage colony stimulating factor (MCSF), both signalling through the MCSF receptor, regulate the mononuclear phagocyte system. A single IL- 34 and MCSF gene are present in tetrapods. Two types of MCSF exist in teleost fish which is resulted from teleost-wide whole genome duplication. In this report, we first identified and sequence analysed six IL- 34 genes in five teleost fish, rainbow trout, fugu, <b>Atlantic</b> salmon, <b>catfish</b> and zebrafish. The fish IL- 34 molecules had a higher identity within fish group but low identities to IL- 34 s from birds (27. 2 - 33. 8 %) and mammals (22. 2 - 31. 4 %). However, they grouped with tetrapod IL- 34 molecules in phylogenetic tree analysis, had a similar 7 exon/ 6 intron gene organisation, and genes in the IL- 34 loci were syntenically conserved. In addition, the regions of the four main helices, along with a critical N-glycosylation site were well conserved. Taken together {{these data suggest that}} the teleost IL- 34 genes described in this report are orthologues of tetrapod IL- 34. Comparative expression study of the three trout MCSFR ligands revealed that IL- 34, MCSF 1 and MCSF 2 are differentially expressed in tissues and cell lines. The expression of MCSF 1 and MCSF 2 showed great variance in different tissues and cell lines, suggesting a role in the differentiation and maintenance of specific macrophage lineages in specific locations. The relatively high levels of IL- 34 expression across different tissues suggests a homeostatic role of IL- 34 for the macrophage lineage in fish. One striking observation {{in the present study was}} the lack of induction of MCSF 1 and MCSF 2 expression but the quick induction of IL- 34 expression by PAMPs and inflammatory cytokines in cell lines and primary head kidney macrophages in rainbow trout. In a parasitic proliferative kidney disease (PKD) model, the expression of IL- 34 but not the dominant MCSF 2 was affected by PKD, suggesting an involvement of macrophage function in this disease model. Thus IL- 34 expression is sensitive to inflammatory stimuli and may regulate macrophage biology once up-regulated. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Seafood {{consumption}} in the U. S. has increased over the period 1990 to 2003. A {{large percentage of the}} seafood consumed in the U. S. is imported. The most important seafood products imported to the U. S. are shrimp, <b>Atlantic</b> salmon, tilapia, <b>catfish,</b> crayfish, mussels and a mixture of mollusks. In 2003, the U. S. imported 199 million pounds of tilapia and tilapia products, at a value of $ 241. 2 million, a 38 % increase from the previous year. The seafood market has been considered an important foreign exchange earner for the Caribbean Common Market (CARICOM), and Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) member countries. Jamaica is the only CARICOM country that exports tilapia products from aquaculture sources to the U. S. In 2003, Jamaica exported 39, 950 pounds of frozen tilapia fillet to the U. S. at a value of $ 77, 952 (Aquaculture Outlook, 2004). Given that tilapia culture may be a promising enterprise for CARICOM and FTAA member countries, it is important to evaluate changes in U. S. market demand for tilapia from CARICOM countries. A Source Differentiated Almost Ideal Demand System (SDAIDS) model was used to conduct an import demand study for tilapia and tilapia products in the U. S. The own price elasticity of Jamaica frozen fillet was found to be - 0. 23, and significant which means that it is price inelastic and which means that increases in exports, other factors remaining constant, may lead to a fall in total revenue. The Jamaican frozen fillet is complementary to that {{of the rest of the}} world (ROW) and fresh fillet from Ecuador, but competitive (substitute) to fresh-frozen fillet from Thailand. Fresh fillet from Ecuador, with a cross price elasticity of 0. 29, is a substitute for the fresh fillet from Costa Rica. The fresh fillet from Costa Rica is complementary to the fresh-frozen from Thailand. The fresh fillet from Honduras with a cross price elasticity of 1. 13 is a substitute for the fresh fillet from Ecuador.

McDonald started [...] with the Inland Empire 66ers before he was promoted to the Double-A Jacksonville Suns. He was named the Dodgers' Minor League Pitcher of the Year in 2007. In August 2008, he was promoted to the Dodgers Triple-A affiliate, Las Vegas 51s. He went 1-0 in his first two starts, striking out 20 batters in that span. He was called up to the Dodgers on September 1, 2008. He made his major league debut on September 17, 2008, against the Pittsburgh Pirates, working one scoreless inning in relief. In February 2009, McDonald was named the #56 prospect in baseball by Baseball America. McDonald then earned a spot in the Dodgers' starting rotation to begin the 2009 season and started his first game in the majors on April 10, 2009, at Chase Field against the Arizona Diamondbacks, allowing five runs in a little over two innings. He made three more starts, only lasting as many as five innings in one (April 25 against the Colorado Rockies, his first career victory), and then was demoted back to the bullpen. With an ERA of 6.75, he was optioned back to AAA on May 14, and then recalled by the Dodgers on June 19. After being recalled, he pitched exclusively out of the bullpen the rest of the season. McDonald began 2010 in the starting rotation for the Albuquerque Isotopes. He was recalled by the Dodgers to start the game on July 19 against the San Francisco Giants. He made a few additional appearances in the bullpen for the Dodgers. On July 31, 2010, McDonald was traded along with outfielder Andrew Lambo to the Pittsburgh Pirates for reliever Octavio Dotel.|$|R
