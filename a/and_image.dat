However, users may have photographs that contain graphics or <b>images</b> <b>and</b> want to access an electronic database to retrieve this information. Hence, an effective photograph retrieval method is needed. Although many content-based retrieval {{methods have been}} developed for <b>images</b> <b>and</b> graphics, few are designed to retrieve graphics <b>and</b> <b>images</b> simultaneously. Moreover, existing graphics retrieval methods use contour-based rather than pixel-based approaches. Contour-based methods, which are concerned with lines or curves, are inappropriate for images. To retrieve graphics <b>and</b> <b>images</b> simultaneously, this work applies an adaptive retrieval method. The proposed method uses histograms of oriented gradient (HOG) as pixel-based features. However, the characteristics of graphics <b>and</b> <b>images</b> differ, <b>and</b> this affects feature extraction and retrieval accuracy. Thus, an adaptive method is proposed that selects different HOG-based features for retrieving graphics <b>and</b> <b>images.</b> Experimental results demonstrate the proposed method has high retrieval accuracy even under noisy conditions...|$|R

5|$|Diagnosis of a {{cerebrospinal}} fluid leak is performed {{through a combination}} of measurement of the CSF pressure and a computed tomography myelogram (CTM) scan of the spinal column for fluid leaks. The opening fluid pressure in the spinal canal is obtained by performing a lumbar puncture, also known as a spinal tap. Once the pressure is measured, a radiocontrast agent is injected into the spinal fluid. The contrast then diffuses out through the dura sac before leaking through dural holes. This allows for a CTM with fluoroscopy to locate <b>and</b> <b>image</b> any sites of dura rupture via contrast seen outside the dura sac in the imagery.|$|E
