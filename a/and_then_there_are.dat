25|$|Other {{than the}} Swiss Alps, the plateau, and {{especially}} the rural plateau, is not geared to tourism. It is mainly a transit region. There is city tourism in the major cities with their touristical attractions, especially the Old Towns of Bern and Lucerne, but also Zurich, St. Gallen, Fribourg, Geneva and Lausanne. An important natural touristic attraction is the Rhine Fall near Schaffhausen. The lakes also attract tourists, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> several spa towns, Baden, Schinznach-Bad, Yverdon-les-Bains and Zurzach, thanks to their hydrothermal vents.|$|E
25|$|The section {{beyond the}} bridge {{contained}} the culvert {{to maintain the}} flow to Tringford pumping station, some of which has now been rewatered, and is the location for the current restoration work by the Wendover Arm Trust. The canal crosses the border between Buckinghamshire and Hertfordshire, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> two wooden footbridges, erected in 2007 to provide easier access to the canal bed while it was being restored. The second one is {{on the site of}} a swing bridge which carried a road from Tring to Wilstone reservoir. Between them, the remains of Whitehouses wharf and pumping station have been excavated. Part of the canal was filled with rubbish {{in the early twentieth century}} by the local authority, and was excavated by bottle collectors before restoration began. There is no towpath on a short section to Little Tring bridge, but walkers can follow a minor road to rejoin the canal, which is navigable at this point.|$|E
500|$|In 2004, One by One won the Grammy Award for Best Rock Album, {{while one}} year earlier at the 45th Grammy Awards [...] "All My Life" [...] {{was chosen as}} Best Hard Rock Performance. While the band had a {{positive}} opinion about the record following release, as Grohl said the songs were [...] "the best we've ever written", he {{and the rest of}} the Foo Fighters eventually grew distasteful about the results. Grohl stated that he was frustrated at himself for rushing on the album: [...] "four of the songs were good, and the other seven I've never played again in my life." [...] Hawkins said that [...] "if you think about things too much, they kinda get sterile, as we found out there", and Shiflett declared that [...] "there are great songs , <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>there</b> <b>are...</b> parts of great songs".|$|E

500|$|Fox Mulder and Dana Scully's {{fight in}} the episode where Scully gets upset due to Mulder always driving grew out of nitpicking from fans {{about the fact that}} Mulder always seems to be the one driving the car. Mulder's joke about Scully's [...] "little feet" [...] was a joke that Carter had made before at an X-Files {{convention}} in Pasadena, California. Gillian Anderson stated that these have been things that fans on the internet have been nitpicking about {{since the beginning of the}} show. David Duchovny later explained that the comedic episodes of the series were often more ludicrous than the other episodes in the show. He noted, [...] "There's The X-Files of the stand-alone, and then there's The X-Files of the mythology, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> the comedic X-Files as well, in which the characters are really not quite the characters that we know." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{scene in}} which O'Malley's colleagues were {{laughing}} at his funeral was one of Vernoff's favorite scenes. She added: [...] "Shonda gave me smart notes that enhanced the writing and then the wonderful director Ed Ornelas and the amazing DP Herb Davis and the whole crew that support them made it visually beautiful and then the actors… damn, did they all bring their A game to this scene. <b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> the editors and music folks {{and the people who}} color correct everything and mix the sound… It's a collaboration. What it takes to make good TV is a huge coming together of a great many artists. What it takes to make great TV is all that plus a little magic and a little luck. And that’s what I feel like we had with this scene. It's so funny and so bittersweet and so, so sad." ...|$|E
500|$|Modern reviews {{have been}} largely critical– Brett Alan Weiss, writing for AllGame, {{considered}} the game to be a [...] "slower, less intense, less enjoyable" [...] version of Kaboom!. He criticized {{the lack of support}} for the paddle controller, and stated that not even the two-player and terrorist modes made the game enjoyable. In his book Classic Home Video Games, Weiss wrote that Lost Luggage was a [...] "fleeting pleasure", opining that [...] "the airplanes flying overhead look nice, {{but the rest of the}} game is ordinary in appearance" [...] and that the difficulty curve and action were poor. Writing for Atari HQ, Keita Iida commented that [...] "there are good Kaboom! clones (Eggomania) <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> bad ones (this one)." [...] Iida believed that if the game was not as similar to Kaboom! then it would be [...] "mildly amusing", but that the better alternatives hampered it.|$|E

500|$|Upon its release, {{the video}} {{received}} universal acclaim from contemporary music critics. Lindsey Weber of Vulture called the short film a [...] "strangely moving ode to Los Angeles". Markos Papadatos from Digital Journal rated it an A+ and wrote, [...] "Just {{when you thought}} that Jared Leto and Thirty Seconds to Mars cannot possible [...] get any better, they prove us wrong" [...] with their music video for [...] "City of Angels". He found it [...] "raw and captivating" [...] and felt that [...] "it will certainly move people." [...] Brenna Ehrlich from MTV commented that while the short film [...] "may lack all the majestic animals" [...] featured in the music video for [...] "Up in the Air", [...] "it does have some exotic animals of a different sort: a whole pack of celebrities." [...] Liza Darwin from Nylon magazine opened her review by writing, [...] "There are music videos, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> Thirty Seconds to Mars music videos." [...] She stated, [...] "Part documentary, part cinematic music video, this Jared Leto-helmed mini-film is touching, sweet, and totally worth watching in its 11-minute entirety." ...|$|E
