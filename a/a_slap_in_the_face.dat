A plan to hold a reenactment of the battle itself (as well as a reenactment of the subsequent French victory of 1760 at the Battle of Sainte-Foy) was cancelled due to threats of public disorder. Leaders of separatist parties described the event as <b>a</b> <b>slap</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> for Quebecers of French ancestry and as an insult for the francophone majority. Some sovereigntist groups threatened or made indirect threats by stating that if the event took place, there could be violence. The movement against re-enactment and these threats of violence led the National Battlefields Commission to cancel the event.|$|E

Abel Gance called it [...] "superb" [...] and wrote, [...] "What a lesson to all directors!" [...] and René Clair said [...] "overthrew the realist dogma" [...] of filmmaking. Film critic and director Louis Delluc said the film has a compelling rhythm: [...] "At first slow, deliberately laborious, it attempts to irritate.

[...] Jean Epstein, however, called it [...] "a prize example of the abuse of décor <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cinema" [...] and said it [...] "represents a grave sickness of cinema".
