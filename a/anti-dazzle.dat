40|$|ABSTRACT This paper {{critically}} {{reviewed the}} chemical bath deposition (CBD) method of thin film syntheses {{as well as}} the theories of early growth (nucleation) mechanisms of growth into continuous films and characterizations of the synthesized thin films using state-of-art techniques such as energy dispersive X-ray Spectrometry (EDS), Scanning electron micros-copy (SEM), tunneling electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and UV-VIS Spectrophotometer. The films deposited by this technique have possible applications in anti-reflection, <b>anti-dazzling,</b> thermal control widow coatings, optical filters, total reflectors, poultry protection and warming coatings, light emitting diodes, solar cell fabrication and varistors...|$|R
40|$|Thin CdMnS {{films were}} {{deposited}} from chemical baths on glass substrates using aqueous conc. Ammonia as a complexing agent. The baths were kept under uniform temperature in an electric oven for periods of 30 and 60 minutes ranging between 700 and 900 C. The deposited thin films were characterized with Spectro UV-VIS RS spectrophotometers. The thin films showed moderate transmittance (< 75 %) in the VIS-NIR regions. All the films show peak refractive index of 2. 28 and direct transition energy band gaps of 1. 40 - 1. 65 eV. The characterization revealed that CdMnS thin films are potential materials for solar cell absorbers, <b>anti-dazzling</b> coating of eyeglasses, and {{for construction of}} poultry houses.

5000|$|For 1933 {{detailed}} refinements {{were made}} to provide more comfort and better appearance, [...] "the bodies are more imposing and the cars look lower". Bonnet flutes, lamps and bumpers were chromium-plated. The saloon's rear seats were deeper and finer quality leather upholstery provided. An eddy-free roof front, anti-glare sloping windscreen and <b>anti-dazzle</b> dipping headlamps were fitted, and dual electric screenwipers replaced the single vacuum instrument.|$|E
50|$|The CLS-Class {{became the}} first {{production}} Mercedes-Benz car with MULTIBEAM LED (similar to Audi Matrix LED) digitally controlled, full-LED glare-free adaptive highbeam. Multibeam LED headlamps come {{with a number of}} lighting features to extend the Intelligent Light System's previous functionality (adaptive Highbeam Assist, country mode, motorway mode, fog lamps, active light function, LED daytime running lamps): <b>Anti-dazzle,</b> high-performance high beams, which react faster, and more precise anticipatory camera-based active light function, navigation-assisted light function for roundabouts.|$|E
50|$|The seventh {{generation}} codenamed G30 {{was unveiled}} on 13 October 2016. Improvements {{over the previous}} model include weight savings of up to 100 kg and a new design with a drag coefficient of 0.22 Cd. Other improvements include an updated BMW iDrive system that now uses a high-resolution 10.25-inch display, a new head-up display that covers 70% more area as well as selective <b>anti-dazzle</b> high beam headlights {{with a range of}} up to 500 metres. The seventh-gen 5 Series has 7-Series like gesture control, iDrive 6.0 infotainment unit, voice control, and head-up display, and new multi-contour massage seats. BMW claims that the cabin is quieter than ever thanks to extensive use of sound-deadening materials.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} aims at realising a shutter prototype {{which would}} allow the containment of the summer heating load in non-residential buildings. The prototype will be constructed with glass-block and will overhang the façade. It will be parallelepiped shaped; furthermore, it will have an isosceles section with the larger base positioned {{at the top of}} the hole forming, thus, a plan perpendicular to the façade and overhanging by 0, 40 cm. With its positioning at the height of the envisaged holes and its particular geometrical shape, this prototype will replace the standard vertical shutter with one containing glass-block with a sharp inclination with respect to the incidence of the sun rays in the summer time. A measurement campaign is envisaged in order to optimize the glass inclination with respect to the incidence of the sun rays both during the winter and the summer time and the width of the horizontal <b>anti-dazzle</b> screen placed {{at the top of the}} shutter. The objectives of this research are: - Minimising overheating during the summer through the inclination of the glass surface; - Reaching a high level of visual comfort; - Realising a monitored natural ventilation. The horizontal overhang surfaces of the shutter will be equipped with a series of holes controlled by a system of rotating thin plates which, once positioned vertically, will allow the proper circulation of air and a further source of natural light. Furthermore, the geometrical shape of this prototype allows for the control of te shades; the holes on the higher and lower horizontal surfaces will guarantee a natural ventilation so to ensure the proper level of air moisture. The lack of mobile or steady <b>anti-dazzle</b> screens ensures a perfect view of the external surroundings; in addition to this, the standard levels envisaged for by the existing regulations on natural lighting on the back wall will not be altered. The aim of this work is that of providing a passive element which could concretely guarantee a high level of acoustic and visual comfort, and a proper ventilation in indoor non-residential environments...|$|E
40|$|The {{progress}} in laser technology leads to very compact but nevertheless powerful laser sources. In the visible and near infrared spectral region, lasers of any wavelength can be purchased. Especially {{continuous wave laser}} sources pose {{a serious threat to}} the human eye and electro-optical sensors due to their high proliferation and easy availability. The manifold of wavelengths cannot be encountered by conventional safety measures like absorption or interference filters. We present a protection concept for electro-optical sensors to suppress dazzling in the visible spectral region. The key element of the concept is the use of a digital micromirror device (DMD) in combination with wavelength multiplexing. This approach allows selective spectral filtering in defined regions of interest in the scene. The system offers the possibility of automatic attenuation of dazzling laser radiation. An <b>anti-dazzle</b> algorithm comprises the analysis of the laser wavelength and the subsequent activation of the appropriate micromirrors of the DMD...|$|E
