5|$|As <b>an</b> <b>opponent</b> <b>of</b> the Vietnam War, Bedell {{signed a}} {{petition}} urging against United States {{military intervention in}} Iraq. This petition was signed {{with the names of}} 70 former Congressmen from the 1970s and was presented in a press conference on March 15, 2003. Bedell said that it was unbelievable for the United States to settle disputes with war, and he said that an Iraq war would be similar to the Vietnam War.|$|E

5|$|Race meetings, concert parties (including drag acts– good drag queens were {{in great}} demand), {{trips to the}} seaside and {{football}} matches were organised to keep men entertained. There were various unofficial publications, including the “Wipers Times”– these give an insight into the views of ordinary soldiers and junior officers. Overt patriotism was rare, and politicians such as (Prime Minister) Asquith and Ramsay MacDonald (<b>an</b> <b>opponent</b> <b>of</b> the war, later Labour Prime Minister) were satirised.|$|E
5|$|Though {{alarmed by}} the {{election}} of Abraham Lincoln in the election of 1860, Hawes was <b>an</b> <b>opponent</b> <b>of</b> secession, supporting instead the idea of armed neutrality. In May 1861, Hawes, Breckinridge, and Kentucky governor Beriah Magoffin represented the Southern Rights viewpoint at a convention to decide Kentucky's course in the Civil War. He attended another such convention in September 1861. Neither convention produced a conclusive decision.|$|E
5|$|According to {{a treaty}} between John Hunyadi and Đorđe Branković, Despot of Serbia, Matthias and the Despot's grand{{daughter}} Elizabeth of Celje were engaged on 7 August 1451. Elizabeth {{was the daughter}} of Ulrich II, Count of Celje, who was related to King Ladislaus V of Hungary and <b>an</b> <b>opponent</b> <b>of</b> Matthias's father. Because of new conflicts between Hunyadi and Ulrich of Celje, the marriage of their children only took place in 1455. Elizabeth settled in the Hunyadis' estates but Matthias was soon sent to the royal court, implying that their marriage was a hidden exchange of hostages between their families. Elizabeth died before the end of 1455.|$|E

5|$|Galland flew {{his first}} of 300 combat mission in Spain with the J/88 {{commander}} Gotthard Handrick, on 24 July 1937, near Brunete. During {{his time in}} Spain, Galland analysed the engagements, evaluated techniques and devised new ground-attack tactics which were {{passed on to the}} Luftwaffe. His experiences in pin-point ground assaults were used by Ernst Udet, a proponent of the dive bomber and leading supporter of the Junkers Ju 87 to push for Stuka wings. Wolfram von Richthofen, <b>an</b> <b>opponent</b> <b>of</b> Udet's, used them to push for the opposite: Schlachtflieger dual combination fighter-bombers. After trials with Henschel Hs 123s, Bf 109s and Ju 87s, the Junkers was selected to undergo trials for the dive bomber role.|$|E
5|$|He was an {{educational}} activist, {{member of the}} Commission of National Education and the initiator and president of Society for Elementary Textbooks. He was <b>an</b> <b>opponent</b> <b>of</b> king Stanisław II August in the 1770s and 1780s, and a major figure in the Polish politics of that era. During the Great Sejm he was {{a leader of the}} Patriotic Party and the reform movement and eventually backed the King in many reform projects. An advocate of a pro-Prussian orientation, he helped conclude an alliance with Prussia in 1790. He co-authored the Constitution of 3 May 1791.|$|E
5|$|In January 1957, the US {{adopted the}} Eisenhower Doctrine and pledged {{to prevent the}} spread of {{communism}} and its perceived agents in the Middle East. Although Nasser was <b>an</b> <b>opponent</b> <b>of</b> communism in the region, his promotion of pan-Arabism was viewed as a threat by pro-Western states in the region. Eisenhower tried to isolate Nasser and reduce his regional influence by attempting to transform King Saud into a counterweight. Also in January, the elected Jordanian prime minister and Nasser supporter Sulayman al-Nabulsi brought Jordan into a military pact with Egypt, Syria, and Saudi Arabia.|$|E

5|$|Many equestrians were publicans, {{in charge}} of tax-collecting in Asia (Asia in Roman times meant {{essentially}} the Roman-dominated area that is now referred to as western Anatolia), and of contracting for construction projects. The equestrian class would get to control a court that tried senators for misconduct in provincial administration. In effect, the equestrians replaced senators already serving at the court. Thus, Gaius became <b>an</b> <b>opponent</b> <b>of</b> senatorial influence. Other reforms implemented by Gaius included fixing prices on grain for the urban population and granting improvements in citizenship for Latins and others outside the city of Rome.|$|E
5|$|Moore {{was also}} a self-taught xylophonist, {{glockenspiel}} player and pianist, {{as well as an}} accomplished composer. He was a former amateur cricketer, golfer and chess player.

Moore was <b>an</b> <b>opponent</b> <b>of</b> fox hunting, an outspoken critic of the European Union, supporter of the UK Independence Party and served as chairman of the short-lived anti-immigration United Country Party. He served in the RAF during World War II, and never married or had children.|$|E
5|$|Northerners {{assumed that}} Fillmore, hailing from a free state, was <b>an</b> <b>opponent</b> <b>of</b> {{the spread of}} slavery. Southerners {{accused him of being}} an abolitionist, which he hotly denied. Fillmore responded to one Alabamian in a widely {{published}} letter that slavery was an evil, but one that the federal government had no authority over. Taylor and Fillmore corresponded twice in September, with the general happy that the crisis over the South Carolinians was resolved. Fillmore, for his part, assured his running mate that the electoral prospects for the ticket looked good, especially in the Northeast.|$|E

5|$|Public {{opposition}} to the project was broad. The Adelaide City Council objected to the plan {{on the basis that}} it would interfere with the well-designed layout of the city proper. In response, the government altered the plan to redirect the line underneath the city, at a considerable increase in cost. Residents in inner-city suburbs such as St Peters were concerned about the noise of the light rail vehicles, and protested against any disruption of the Torrens Gorge in the Modbury corridor. Test drilling commenced for the tunnel, but the entire light rail project was halted in 1980 after Premier David Tonkin appointed Michael Wilson, <b>an</b> <b>opponent</b> <b>of</b> the plan, as Transport Minister.|$|E
5|$|Senator Powell favored Kentucky's {{neutrality}} policy {{during the}} Civil War, but nationally, the conflict {{put him in}} a tenuous political situation. On one hand, he favored a strong national government and a strict interpretation of the U.S. Constitution. On the other hand, he was <b>an</b> <b>opponent</b> <b>of</b> coercion, and due to Kentucky's proximity to the Southern states, maintained a more sympathetic view of the southern cause than legislators from more northern states. During his term as governor, Powell had been critical of Northern states that refused to abide by the Fugitive Slave Act.|$|E
5|$|Tensions {{between the}} factions were {{inflamed}} {{almost as soon}} as the 1924 legislature convened. A bill to outlaw parimutuel betting in the state passed the House of Representatives, but failed in the Senate. The next legislative battle centered on removing the head of the Board of Charities and Corrections and give the governor greater control over the board's makeup; this attempt also narrowly failed. When Senator Stanley, <b>an</b> <b>opponent</b> <b>of</b> prohibition, sought re-election to the Senate in 1924, Fields and his allies did not support him, leading to the election of Republican Frederick M. Sackett and giving the Republicans both of the state's senate seats {{for the first time in}} history.|$|E
