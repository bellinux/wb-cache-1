5|$|Although {{the mundane}} subject was {{constant}} throughout the Haystack series, the underlying theme {{may be seen}} as the transience of light. This concept enabled Monet to use repetition to show nuances of perception as the time of day, the seasons and the weather changed. The almost unvarying subject provided the basis for him to compare changes of light and mood across his nuanced series. The first paintings in the series were started in late September or early October 1890, and he continued producing these paintings for about seven months. These paintings made Monet the first painter to paint such a large quantity of pictures of the same subject matter differentiated by light, weather, atmosphere <b>and</b> <b>perspective.</b>|$|E
5|$|Building on {{his late}} 1950s {{drawings}} of comic strips characters, Look Mickey marks Lichtenstein's first full employment of painterly techniques to reproduce almost faithful representations {{of pop culture}} and so satirize and comment upon the then developing process of mass production of visual imagery. In this, Lichtenstein pioneered a motif that became influential not only in 1960s pop art but continuing {{to the work of}} artists today. Lichtenstein borrows from a Donald Duck illustrated story book, showing Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck during a fishing mishap. However, he makes significant alterations to the original source, including modifying the color scheme <b>and</b> <b>perspective,</b> while seeming to make statements about himself.|$|E
5|$|In the 1980s, {{the sector}} was in crisis, {{characterized}} by low investment, poor cost recovery and poor service quality {{in most of}} the country. As a result, the government decided to break up INSFOPAL {{at the end of the}} 1980s and to devolve the responsibility for service provision back to the municipalities after four decades, except for some cases like the Valle de Cauca department, where the regional companies continued providing the services. Furthermore, the institutional responsibility for the sector was transferred from the Ministry of Health to the Ministry of Economic Development. This change was not only an administrative change, but it introduced a different focus <b>and</b> <b>perspective</b> to the sector.|$|E

5|$|Tubman's {{friends and}} {{supporters}} {{from the days}} of abolition, meanwhile, raised funds to support her. One admirer, Sarah Hopkins Bradford, wrote an authorized biography entitled Scenes in the Life of Harriet Tubman. The 132-page volume was published in 1869, and brought Tubman some US$1,200 in revenue. Criticized by modern biographers for its artistic license and highly subjective point of view, the book nevertheless remains an important source of information <b>and</b> <b>perspective</b> on Tubman's life. Bradford released another volume in 1886 called Harriet, the Moses of her People, which presented a less caustic view of slavery and the South. It, too, was published as a way to help alleviate Tubman's poverty.|$|E
5|$|Van Gogh {{returned}} to Cuesmes in August 1880, where he lodged with a miner until October. He {{became interested in}} the people and scenes around him, and recorded them in drawings after Theo's suggestion that he take up art in earnest. He travelled to Brussels later in the year, to follow Theo's recommendation that he study with the Dutch artist Willem Roelofs, who persuaded him – in spite of his dislike of formal schools of art – to attend the Académie Royale des Beaux-Arts. He registered at the Académie in November 1880, where he studied anatomy and the standard rules of modelling <b>and</b> <b>perspective.</b>|$|E
5|$|In Sicily, the {{decision}} was taken not just for fashion and appearance {{but also because it}} would minimise the damage to property and life likely to be caused in future quakes. In 1693, the cramped housing and streets had caused buildings to collapse together like dominoes. Although after the earthquake the avenues were broadened and the density of housing was lowered overall, cramped and narrow areas of housing still remained, posing a hazard for the poor. Architecturally and aesthetically, the big advantage of the new order of town planning was that unlike many Italian towns and cities, where one frequently encounters a monumental Renaissance church squeezed terrace fashion between incongruous neighbours, in urban Baroque design one can step back and actually see the architecture in a more conducive setting in relation to its proportions <b>and</b> <b>perspective.</b> This is most notable in the largely rebuilt towns of Caltagirone, Militello in Val di Catania, Catania, Modica, Noto, Palazzolo Acreide, Ragusa, and Scicli.|$|E

5|$|True Detective was {{intended}} to be a novel, but once the project took definite form, Pizzolatto thought the narrative's shifts in time <b>and</b> <b>perspective</b> made it more suitable for television. He pitched an adaptation of Galveston, and from May to July 2010 he developed six screenplays, including an early, 90-page draft of the True Detective pilot script. Pizzolatto secured a development deal with HBO for a potential pilot series shortly thereafter. He wrote a second True Detective script soon after his departure from The Killing thanks to the support of production company and manager Anonymous Content, which ultimately produced and developed the project in-house. By April 2012, following a heated bidding period, HBO commissioned eight episodes of True Detective. Pizzolatto did not hire a writing staff because he believed a collaborative approach would not work with his isolated, novelistic process, and that a group would not achieve his desired result. After working alone for about three months, the final copy of the project script was 500 pages long.|$|E
5|$|When {{paying a}} state visit to Britain, foreign {{heads of state}} are usually entertained by the Queen at Buckingham Palace. They are {{allocated}} a large suite of rooms known as the Belgian Suite, situated {{at the foot of}} the Minister's Staircase, on the ground floor of the north-facing Garden Wing. The rooms of the suite are linked by narrow corridors, one of them is given extra height <b>and</b> <b>perspective</b> by saucer domes designed by Nash in the style of Soane. A second corridor in the suite has Gothic-influenced cross-over vaulting. The Belgian Rooms themselves were decorated in their present style and named after Prince Albert's uncle LéopoldI, first King of the Belgians. In 1936, the suite briefly became the private apartments of the palace when they were occupied by King EdwardVIII.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to explore the {{experiences}} of selected Saskatchewan teachers regarding the incorporation of Aboriginal content <b>and</b> <b>perspectives</b> within current provincial curricula. This exploration was accomplished through administering a survey to selected teachers teaching in urban, rural and Band controlled school divisions and by conducting semi-structured interviews. Three themes emerged in the data analysis: (a) the incorporation of Aboriginal content <b>and</b> <b>perspectives</b> takes time; (b) the incorporation of Aboriginal content <b>and</b> <b>perspectives</b> is an important initiative; and (c) teachers require further supports for the implementation of the incorporation of Aboriginal content <b>and</b> <b>perspectives.</b> These three themes form the basis of five recommendations to school and provincial policy makers and teacher education programs. This study is important because all teachers in the province of Saskatchewan have been required to implement Aboriginal content <b>and</b> <b>perspectives</b> into their curricula since 2000. The population growth of Aboriginal people in Saskatchewan is continuing to rise. Because of this the provincial education system is experiencing an increase in Aboriginal students. Hence, this study will inform the development of future policies to ensure that all children in Saskatchewan come to know Aboriginal content <b>and</b> Aboriginal <b>perspectives...</b>|$|R
