Six batches of recently processed UHT milk were collected and stored under three temperatures (21 ºC, 6 ºC, and - 12 ºC) and analyzed by HPLC in {{the day of the}} milk collection (day 0) and at 30, 60, 90, and 120 days of storage.

There was a progressive increase of the CMP index during the storage period of 120 days, and this indicates the possibility of false positive results if the CMP index is used as an adulteration test for long term stored UHT milk. The validity of the CMP index as an adulteration indicator is only possible soon after packaging, and sample freezing is the only alternative when immediate analysis is not possible.

Two types of breach of contract are investigated, <b>adulteration</b> <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> supplied to the creamery (enabling a member to capture more than his share of the result) and exit before the stipulated period of membership (putting at risk the economy by increasing the costs per produced unit).

This suggest that the cooperatives singled out the reasons for exit that would not cause a ’run ’ on the cooperative.

Earlier, in 2007, contamination of pet food with ME and its related contaminants was associated with many clinical cases of canine and feline nephrotoxicity, {{and in some cases}} mortality. ME is a triazine compound that is often detected with other triazine analogs such as cyanuric acid. As is the custom in some livestock operations, the contaminated pet food was mixed with feed intended for the swine and poultry industry. This practice has raised several questions as to whether ME and its related triazines would adversely affect the health of these food animals, and whether meat products derived from swine and poultry could contain high-enough levels of these contaminants to warrant public health concern. Data for this review article were obtained from recent research efforts in our laboratory, peer-reviewed publications cited in PubMed, and information available at USDA, US FDA, and WHO websites. The primary issues discussed are related to (1) the chemistry and interactions between ME and its triazine analogs; (2) reported animal and human exposures with possible pathways through which ME can enter the human food chain; (3) mammalian toxicology; (4) comparative pharmacokinetics (PK) and modeling strategies used to predict residue levels; and (5) emerging issues and management strategies...|$|E

Milk freezing point was analyzed with each of investigated methods in three consecutive testing respectively repetition. The results of freezing point were recorded as higher by reference in comparison to infrared spectroscopy method. Mean difference from 1. 31 to 5. 28 m°C respectively 3. 43 m°C was determined between results obtained with infrared spectroscopy and reference method. Mean repeatability results for both investigated methods showed slight difference, sr%= 0. 194 for the reference method and sr%= 0. 193 for the infrared spectrometry method.

40|$|Milk {{processing}} {{industries and}} distributors {{have problems with}} <b>adulteration</b> <b>of</b> liquid <b>milk</b> {{by the addition of}} bovine cheese whey. Recently, the detection of fraudulent manipulation <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> with whey has focused on the identification of glycomacropeptide (GMP). Current non-immunological methods to detect GMP in dairy products are expensive and time-consuming or have low sensitivity. In this study, a novel sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the detection and quantification of whey in raw milk was developed, using a polyclonal rabbit anti-GMP antibody. Calibration curves were constructed by analyzing raw milk standards containing different known concentrations of liquid cheese whey (0. 02 – 20 %). The method had a detection limit of 0. 047 % (v/v) and a quantification limit of 0. 14 % (v/v). The antibody showed high specificity and no cross-reaction with milk components (other than κ-casein) and was successful in detecting GMP in dairy commercial products. The recovery ratio was between 95. 62 % and 113. 88 % for all matrices tested. The intra-assay and interassay coefficients of variation were < 6 % and < 7 %, respectively. Finally, it can be stored for 3  months {{in the form of a}} ready-to-use kit, while maintaining its accuracy and reproducibility...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} study, {{near-infrared}} spectroscopy (NIRS) was explored as a fast and reliable screening method {{for the detection}} <b>of</b> <b>adulteration</b> <b>of</b> skim <b>milk</b> powder (SMP). Sixty genuine SMP were adulterated with acid whey (1 – 25 % w/w), starch (2 and 5 %) and maltodextrin (2 and 5 %) {{for a total of}} 348 adulterated samples. Two chemometric approaches were employed. In the first approach, an untargeted one class model for genuine skim milk powder was developed by Soft Independent Modelling of Class Analogy. In the second approach, adulterant-specific regression models were developed to assess the amount of each adulterant by partial least square regression and principal component regression. The class modelling approach had the advantage that several adulterants could be detected with the same chemometric model, including situations where multiple adulterants are present in the test sample or where yet unknown adulterants are present. Regression models showed a better sensitivity with genuine SMP samples completely discriminated from samples adulterated with 5 % acid whey and 2 % of starch or maltodextrin. NIRS proved to be a useful tool for the rapid and cost-efficient untargeted and/or targeted detection <b>of</b> <b>adulterations</b> in SMP. </p...|$|R
