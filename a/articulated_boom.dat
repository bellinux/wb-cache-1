The aerial lift was equipped with a stabilizing device: an extendable axle to enhance the vehicle’s stability. The manufacturer stated in the Operators and Safety Manual that all operators must properly position the extendable axle and lock it into position before raising the platform or extending the boom. There were two safety features on the lift that were designed to ensure the use of the stabilizing device: an axle set indicator light and an interlock. A post incident test showed that while the indicator light worked, the interlock was inoperable. The plant maintenance crew did not receive the Operators and Safety Manual from the leasing company nor did they receive any training on how to operate the lift.

The wings are stowed against the spacecraft kinematically, and released by five pyrotechnically-actuated mechanisms. Since deployment failure would be catastrophic, {{a total of}} 17 deployment tests were completed to qualify the system for the worst cast launch environment. This successful testing culminated in the flawless deployment of the solar arrays on orbit, 15 minutes after launch in November 1997.

40|$|With {{respect to}} the special {{environmental}} conditions - elevated #gamma#-radiation and temperature - in the plasma chamber of a fusion reactor like NET/ITER, maintenance and replacement tasks can be performed only by means of remote handling systems. EDITH (Experimental Device for In-Torus Handling) is the prototype of such a system. It {{is based on an}} <b>articulated</b> <b>boom</b> transporter which can be equipped with different end-effectors and tools, respectively, depending on the different tasks to be carried out. EDITH is the central component of a testbed constructed in full scale to investigate experimentally remote handling operations in the simulated section of a plasma chamber. As typical tasks the replacement of protective tiles and divertor plates have been performed. In order to allow the operators a fast and reliable performance of the tasks an advanced guidance and control system has been developed. The guidance system forms a remote handling workstation which, together with the servo-manipulator, represents the man/machine interface for the control and surveillance of all devices. The workstation supports the operators at all operations to be manually controlled, at the planning, simulation and programming of automatically performed subtasks. It serves also as a permanently available documentation system and information source. The driving factors for the conceptual design of the control system were the dynamic behaviour, the operational reliability and the cooperation with the guidance system. Qualification tests and first practical experience confirm that this type of remote handling techniques permits to perform in-vessel maintenance tasks safely, reliably and in appropriate time.

CP- 5 was the principle nuclear reactor {{used to produce}} neutrons for scientific research at Argonne from 1954 to 1979. The CP- 5 reactor was a heavy-water cooled and moderated, enriched uranium-fueled reactor with a graphite reflector. The CP- 5 D&D project includes the disassembly, segmentation and removal of all the radioactive components, equipment and structures associated with the CP- 5 facility.

The teleoperated systems provided were the Dual Arm Work Platform (DAWP), the Rosie Mobile Teleoperated Robot Work System (ROSIE), and a remotely-operated crane control system with installed swing-reduction control system. Another remotely operated apparatus, a Brokk BM 250, was loaned to ANL by the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory (PPPL). This machine is not teleoperated and {{was not part of the}} LSDP, but deserves some mention in this discussion. The DAWP is a robotic dismantlement system that includes a pair of Schilling Robotic Systems Titan III hydraulic manipulator arms mounted to a specially designed support platform: a hydraulic power unit (HPU) and a remote operator console. The DAWP is designed to be crane-suspended for remote positioning. ROSIE, developed by RedZone Robotics, Inc. is a mobile, electro-hydraulic, omnidirectional platform with a heavy-duty telescoping boom mounted to the platform's deck. The work system includes the mobile platform (locomotor), a power distribution unit (PDU) and a remote operator console. ROSIE moves about the reactor building floor around the reactor assembly and, like the DAWP, is controlled from a console in the control room. The remotely-operated crane control system with installed swing-reduction control system was installed on the CP- 5 polar crane and allows a load suspended from the crane to be remotely operated while reducing the induced swing in the load, The system includes a remote-controlled rotational hook, two remote-reading load cells and a lightweight portable operator controller.

Methodology. To determine the kinematic characteristics of each link of the <b>articulated</b> jib system (<b>boom,</b> arm, jib tie, counterweight, load) we developed a dynamic and mathematical models that allow us to describe the movement of the articulated jib system when luffing.

The conducted mathematical modeling allowed scientifically proving the usefulness of the proposed methodology for determining the design parameters of the articulated jib systems. The designed package of geometry, weight and variable data helps to simplify the process of preparatory calculations before the automated synthesis and to optimize the design of the articulated jib systems of portal cranes. Originality. For the first time the work proposes the technique for calculation of the parametric data that allow us to determine the rational design parameters of the articulated jib system. There are developed local programs for the integrated optimization synthesis that make it possible to select the best design option simultaneously by several quality criteria and functional constraints. Practical value. The proposed method of calculating the design parameters can be used in the design of new and modernization of existing portal cranes with the articulated jib systems, which, in turn, will reduce the material and energy consumption of the cranes...|$|R
