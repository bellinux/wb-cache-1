Since 2009, the current ball has been displayed atop the building year-round, while the original, smaller version of the current ball that was used in 2008 is on display at Times Square's visitor center.|$|E
5|$|Timothy Ludwig Pflueger (September 26, 1892 – November 20, 1946) was a {{prominent}} architect, interior designer and <b>architectural</b> <b>lighting</b> designer in the San Francisco Bay Area {{in the first half}} of the 20th century. Together with James R. Miller, Pflueger designed some of the leading skyscrapers and movie theaters in San Francisco in the 1920s, and his works featured art by challenging new artists such as Ralph Stackpole and Diego Rivera. Rather than breaking new ground with his designs, Pflueger captured the spirit of the times and refined it, adding a distinct personal flair. His work influenced later architects such as Pietro Belluschi.|$|E
5|$|Over the Stock Exchange floor, Pflueger {{mounted a}} ceiling {{composed}} of interconnected sheet metal strips above {{which he used}} indirect lighting to soften the edges and reduce shadows made by traders on the floor below. The result was so effective that Pflueger used it on a much larger scale above the audience seating at the Paramount Theatre in Oakland, where it extended from and formed a continuity with the incised art on the proscenium. In Oakland, Pflueger flanked the stage with structures {{that appeared to be}} pillars supporting the proscenium but were instead layered, curved sheets of thin metal behind which lighting instruments cast light indirectly to give the columns a suffused glow. In 1931, he used the same concept to frame the stage at the Bal Tabarin (now Bimbo's 365 Club), and to bring a changing palette of color to the ceiling above the dance floor. Pflueger filed for and, in 1934, received two <b>architectural</b> <b>lighting</b> design patents, one for his ceiling grid with indirect lighting and one for the thin metal panels hiding lighting instruments. He used the patented ceiling grid once more in the Patent Leather Bar, in 1939.|$|E

25|$|Parabolic Aluminized Reflector lights, or PAR lights, or PAR cans, {{are used}} when a {{substantial}} amount of flat lighting is required for a scene. A PAR can is a sealed beam PAR lamp housed in a simple can-like unit. Like an old-fashioned automotive headlight, the reflector is integral to the lamp and the beam spread of the unit is not adjustable except by changing the lamp. PAR lamps are widely used in <b>architectural</b> <b>lighting</b> and may often be found at hardware stores. PAR lights have seen heavy use in rock and roll shows, especially those with smaller budgets, due to their low cost, light weight, easy maintenance, high durability, and high output. They are often used in combination with smoke or haze machines which make the path of the beam visible. They are also often used as top, back, or side lights in the theatre and for special effects.|$|E
500|$|Due to a {{significant}} wealthy East Asian clientele of gamblers which the casino attracts, it is a restaurant with Chinese chefs serving authentic Chinese cuisine. The bright and luminous interior contains no direct lighting; rather, an overhead metal-cut white screen and large aquariums filled with goldfish are all backlit by LED bulbs. Halogen track lighting spotlights each table. The lighting system won a commendation from <b>Architectural</b> <b>Lighting</b> magazine in its 2009 AL Design Awards. The authors of Eating Las Vegas 2012 wrote: [...] "Combining classic Chinese peasant and street food with a super-cool design, the place looks like it's been draped in a gigantic white, transparent metal doily, and is meant to resemble either inverted Chinese lace cut into an arabesque pattern or the inside of an inverted bird's nest – all very symbolic and all very Chinese. The food is fabulous, especially the Imperial seafood-soup dumplings (which everyone comes for) and the Chef's Special beef pancake".|$|E

50|$|<b>Architectural</b> <b>light</b> shelves {{have been}} proven to {{reduce the need for}} {{artificial}} lighting in buildings. Since they can reflect light deeper into a space, the use of incandescent and fluorescent lighting can be reduced or completely eliminated, depending on the space. Light shelves make it possible for daylight to penetrate the space up to 2.5 times the distance between the floor and the top of the window. Today, advanced light shelf technology makes it possible to increase the distance up to 4 times. In spaces such as classrooms and offices, light shelves {{have been proven}} to increase occupant comfort and productivity. Furthermore, incorporating light shelves in a building design is admissible for the LEED point system, falling under the “Indoor Environment Quality: Daylight & Views” category.|$|R

60|$|And the {{principles}} {{on which this}} division is to be made, are as regards relation of quantities, the same in architecture as in painting, or indeed, in any other art whatsoever, only the painter is by his varied subject partly permitted, partly compelled, to dispense with the symmetry of <b>architectural</b> <b>light</b> and shade, and to adopt arrangements apparently free and accidental. So that in modes of grouping there is much difference (though no opposition) between the two arts; but in rules of quantity, both are alike, so far forth as their commands of means are alike. For the architect, {{not being able to}} secure always the same depth or decision of shadow, nor to add to its sadness by color (because even when color is employed, it cannot follow the moving shade), is compelled to make many allowances, and avail himself of many contrivances, which the painter needs neither consider nor employ.|$|R
