40|$|Photooxidation (UV radiation) and {{enhanced}} photooxidation (UVC/H 2 O 2) are water treatment technologies which remove aquatic natural organic matter (NOM) by photodegradation, producing lower molecular weight components and CO 2. Since these technologies are being investigated {{for the treatment}} of drinking water, knowledge of the potential toxicity of the photooxidation by-products is vital. The potential toxicity of UVA-, UVB-, UVC-irradiated, and UVC/H 2 O 2 -treated aquatic NOM in two spot samples from two Australian reservoirs was analysed in two spot samples using Vibrio fischeri in the MicrotoxTM test, African green monkey kidney cells (AS/NZS 4020 : 1999), and Daphnia carinata in an <b>acute</b> <b>immobilisation</b> <b>test.</b> Toxicity was not apparent for both the MicrotoxTM procedure and cytotoxicity analyses for the UVC-irradiated and UVC/H 2 O 2 -treated NOM samples, while UVA- and UVB-irradiated water samples were non-toxic to D. carinata. In contrast, acute toxicity was observed for UVC- and UVC/H 2 O 2 -treated water samples. The observed toxicity was attributed to photooxidative degradation of NOM-metal binding sites, which resulted in the release of bioavailable copper ions, as evidenced by higher concentrations of free copper ions in photooxidised water. As the total copper concentrations of the two raw water samples were well below the Australian Water Quality Guidelines for metals in domestic supplies, the release of copper from photooxidised NOM is unlikely to cause health concerns in these samples...|$|E
40|$|The aquatic {{toxicity}} of sulfaquinoxaline (SQO) and sulfaguanidine (SGD) was evaluated {{on the following}} test organisms: Daphnia magna (reproduction test), Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata, Scenedesmus dimorphus, Synecococcus leopoliensis (algal growth inhibition test) and Lemna gibba (duckweed growth inhibition test). Furthermore, the additivity of the two compounds was measured on D. magna (<b>acute</b> <b>immobilisation</b> <b>test)</b> and P. subcapitata (algal growth inhibition test) using the isobologram method. Results show that SQO and SGD are more toxic to green algae and daphnids, respectively, than other veterinary sulfonamides (SAs) and that their mixtures have a less then additive interaction. Taking into account the highest concentrations detected so far in surface waters for SQO (0. 112 lg L_ 1) and for SGD (0. 145 lg L_ 1) and the lowest NOECs obtained with the five test organisms, divided by an assessment factor of 10, the following PNECs and risk quotients (RQs) were calculated. SQO: PNEC 2 lg L_ 1; RQ 0. 056. SGD: PNEC 39. 5 lg L_ 1; RQ 0. 004. Consequently, at the concentrations actually detected in the aquatic environment, the two SAs alone should not harm the freshwater organisms. However, it seems advisable, for veterinary mass treatments, the use of other SAs that have a lesser impact on the aquatic environment. Furthermore, considering the high probability of having complex mixtures of different SAs residues in water, each individual contamination should be evaluated by applying to the SAs mixtures the conservative criteria of additivity...|$|E
3000|$|... 'Personal Care Products'; also {{referred}} to as cosmetic products or cosmetics in the European Union (EU), contain a multitude of chemicals used for different purposes. The chemicals used to introduce certain functions in personal care products show different properties. Due to some of these properties (e.g. low water solubility) environmental behavior and effects are not easily determined. For many of these substances, ecotoxicological testing is technically not feasible or very expensive. Due to this lack of appropriate testing tools, recent research is increasingly interested in this substance group [1]. 'Poorly soluble substances', which are characterised by low water solubility (< 1 mg/l), may constitute a substantial proportion of the ingredients in some 'personal care products'. Such ingredients with essential function are used in numerous cosmetic products, e.g. as emulsifiers. The extensive usage results in high production volumes and thereby requires an assessment of the environmental behavior and the toxicity of these substances to aquatic organisms to fulfill the requirements of the European Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) Regulation. For manufacturers or importers as responsible registrants, risk assessment is necessary to demonstrate product safety for human health and the environment. At the threshold of the water solubility of the substance, toxicity tests are very difficult to conduct and cannot be performed as a matter of routine. High lipophilicity and high adsorption potential might cause an extensive adsorption of the substance to surfaces, e.g. to the test vessels or test organisms. This might complicate testing procedures, and analytical determination of the substance. As a consequence, the measured concentrations in the test solution are likely to be significantly lower than the nominal concentrations. It also raises difficulties in quantifying the substances with analytical methods because of their low concentration in the water phase. For these reasons standard tests such as the Daphnia <b>acute</b> <b>immobilisation</b> <b>test</b> or the algal growth inhibition test, which are required for the REACH registration, might provide insufficient results and are thereby often not appropriate for a realistic risk assessment.|$|E

40|$|Antifouling (AF) systems {{provide the}} most {{cost-effective}} protection against biofouling. Several AF biocides have, however, caused deleterious effects in the environment. Subsequently, new compounds have emerged that claim to be more environment-friendly, but studies on their toxicity and environmental risk are {{necessary in order to}} ensure safety. This work aimed to assess the toxicity of three emerging AF 2 ̆ 7 biocides, tralopyril, triphenylborane pyridine (TPBP) and capsaicin, towards non-target freshwater organisms representing three trophic levels: algae (Chlamydomonas reinhardtii), crustacean (Daphnia magna) and fish (Danio rerio). From the three tested biocides, tralopyril had the strongest inhibitory effect on C. reinhardtii growth, effective quantum yield and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) content. TPBP caused sub-lethal effects at high concentrations (100 and 250 mu g L- 1), and capsaicin had no significant effects on algae. In the D. magna <b>acute</b> <b>immobilisation</b> <b>test,</b> the most toxic compound was TPBP. However, tralopyril has a short half-life and quickly degrades in water. With exposure solution renewals, tralopyril 2 ̆ 7 s toxicity was similar to TPBP. Capsaicin did not cause any effects on daphnids. In the zebrafish embryo toxicity test (zFET) the most toxic compound was tralopyril with a 120 h - LC 50 of 5 mu g L- 1, TPBP 2 ̆ 7 s 120 h - LC 50 was 447. 5 mu g L- 1. Capsaicin did not cause mortality in zebrafish up to 1 mg L- 1. Sub- lethal effects on the proteome o f zebrafish embryos were analysed for tralopyril and TPBP. Both general stress- related and compound-specific protein changes were observed. Five proteins involved in energy metabolism, eye structure and cell differentiation were commonly regulated by both compounds. Tralopyril specifically induced the upregulation of 6 proteins implicated in energy metabolism, cytoskeleton, cell division and mRNA splicing whilst TPBP lead to the upregulation of 3 proteins involved in cytoskeleton, cell growth and protein folding. An ecological risk characterization was performed for a hypothetical freshwater marina. This analysis identified capsaicin as an environment-friendly compound while tralopyril and TPBP seem to pose a risk to freshwater ecosystems. Noneless, more studies on the characterization o f the toxicity, behaviour and fate of these AF biocides in the environment are necessary since this information directly affects the outcome o f the risk assessment...|$|E
40|$|Daphnia magna is a {{freshwater}} cladoceran largely {{employed in}} ecotoxicity tests {{due to its}} high sensitivity to xenobiotics, relative easiness of culturing, short parthenogenetic cycle and small dimensions. However, various {{studies have shown that}} other daphnids may be more sensitive than D. magna to some environmental contaminants. The use of indigenous species in toxicity tests has the advantage of generating ecologically relevant and environmentally realistic data for use in water quality guidelines. Aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the suitability of Daphnia curvirostris for the acute toxicity test usually performed on D. magna, and to compare the sensitivity of the two species toward 10 antibacterials and to some of their binary mixtures. The D. curvirostris clone used in the tests was generated from a specimen collected in Rosolina (RO, coordinate WGS 84 : 45, 138666698153 lat 12, 3240131618937 lon), while D. magna was originally obtained from Ecotox LDS S. r. l. (Milano, Italy). Tests were conducted in accordance with the OECD 202 guideline. Daphnids were exposed to scaled concentrations of the following antibacterials: enrofloxacin (EFX), ciprofloxacin(CPX), sulfaguanidine (SGD), sulfadiazine (SDZ), sulfamethazine (SMZ), sulfaquinoxaline (SQO), sulfaclozine (SCZ), sulfamerazine (SMA), sulfadimetoxine (SDM) and trimethoprim (TMP). Furthermore, the toxicity of 4 mixtures was evaluated (TMP+SDZ, TMP+SDM, TMP+SQO and EFX+CPX). The calculated EC 50 s spanned three orders of magnitude, varying from 4. 33 mg L- 1 (EFX) to 421, 1 mg L- 1 (SDM) in D. curvirostris and from 5. 21 mg L- 1 (SGD) to 379. 8 mg L- 1 (SCZ) in D. magna. D. curvirostris showed to be more sensitive than D. magna to the assayed compounds, with the exception of SMA, SDZ and SDM. With binary mixtures simple additivity was mainly recorded. It was concluded that D. curvirostris is well suitable for the <b>acute</b> <b>immobilisation</b> <b>test,</b> and that its sensitivity to xenobiotics may often be greater than that of D. magna, probably due to its higher surface/volume quotient; besides, being naturally present in the water ponds of northern Italy, D. curvirostris can give a realistic picture of the local environmental impact of xenobiotics. Tests with D. curvirostris were also useful in confirming that, as already observed in previous experiments with D. magna, binary mixtures of antibacterials usually act in accordance to the expectable and reassuring criterion of simple addition...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} project aims {{to investigate the}} toxicity of six commonly used agricultural pesticides (formulations based on glyphosate, mecoprop-p, chlorothalonil, mancozeb, metaldehyde and chlorpyrifos) on three key functional groups of the freshwater environment. This was achieved by carrying out laboratory acute toxicity studies on 1) the bacterial community of a dehydrated microbial seed, 2) the submerged aquatic macrophyte species Myriophyllum aquaticum and 3) the aquatic invertebrate species Daphnia magna. Firstly, the impact of pesticide exposure on the bacterial trophic level of a freshwater system was carried out. The effect of the pesticides on bacterial activity was measured by assessing the oxygen consumption of the population over time. This was achieved by using the standard BOD 5 method and the Oxitop control measuring system. The inhibitory effect of the test substance on the bacterial population was {{measured in terms of}} percentage inhibition of BOD 5, length of the lag phase, slope of the line during the exponential growth phase and EC 50 values calculated at various time points on the growth response curve. Based on the results, the overall toxicity order of the pesticide formulations towards the bacterial population was as follows; glyphosate/mecoprop-p > chlorothalonil/chlorpyrifos > metaldehyde > mancozeb. Based on the EC 50 value obtained, these pesticides are not thought to have a long term inhibitory effect on bacteria. All pesticides were degraded and used as a food source by the bacteria seed population over the test period. This indicates that freshwater systems have the ability to remediate against pesticide contamination. A second toxicity bioassay was carried out on the submerged aquatic macrophyte Myriophyllum aquaticum, which represented the macrophyte trophic level of the system. While no standard procedure for toxicity testing of Myriophyllum aquaticum exists, the experimental procedure used was based on the Myriophyllum toxicity test method developed by the SETAC Aquatic Macrophyte Ecotoxicology Group (AMEG), with some minor modifications. Submerged rooted M. aquaticum shoots were exposed to the test substance, under controlled conditions, for a period of 14 days. Macrophyte inhibition was assessed by recording shoot length, biomass wet and dry weight, root length and root number, as well as noting physical changes of the plant {{over the course of the}} study. Based on mean toxicity values, the toxicity scale of the six pesticides examined was as follows; mancozeb > mecoporp-p > glyphosate > chlorpyrifos > chlorothalonil > metaldehyde. Five of the six pesticides examined exerted a toxic effect on M. aquaticum. Glyphosate, mecoprop-p, chlorothalonil, mancozeb and chlorpyrifos were all found to be toxic to the plant. Metaldehyde was the only active ingredient which did not stunt the plant growth. Due to the large range in sensitivity of parameters, it was concluded that a number of parameters should be used when measuring macrophyte toxicity. Roots are particularly sensitive to pollutants and where possible should always be included in toxicity tests. Finally, the toxicity of plant protection products on the invertebrate trophic level of a freshwater ecosystem was examined by carrying out the <b>Acute</b> <b>Immobilisation</b> <b>Test</b> of Daphnia (OECD 202). The toxicity order of the pesticides towards daphnia was found to be as follows; mancozeb > chlorpyrifos > metaldehyde > chlorothalonil > glyphosate > mecoprop-p. Fungicide and insecticide products were the most harmful to daphnia while herbicidal products posed less of a risk. The OECD 202 Daphnia immobility study is a general protocol for the assessment of a wide variety of chemical substances, however, some modification for the assessment of plant protection products have been suggested. Stirring or aeration of the test solution may be required in cases where the test substance does not easily remain in solution. Secondly, distinguishing between immobility and mortality of daphnia, while more time consuming, can provide useful additional information on the effect of the substance on the daphnia. By combining the above results, an overall assessment of the toxicity of pesticides on the freshwater environment can be evaluated. It was concluded that individual pesticides effect each trophic level differently. The invertebrate trophic level was observed to be the most sensitive to pesticide exposure, while the bacterial trophic level was the least sensitive. Bacterial populations have the potential to remediate against pesticide exposure and are an important defence against pesticide pollution events. It was concluded that of the six pesticide formulations examined here, mancozeb and in particular chlorpyrifos based formulations pose the greatest risk to the overall aquatic ecosystem. This is due to their toxicity on the three test species but also based on their potential for wider ecosystem effects. A tiered toxicity assessment, using a number of toxicity assays from different trophic levels, is therefore considered an effective way of assessing the risk posed by pollutants to the aquatic environment as a whole...|$|E

This project focused on two toxicants that occur to-gether in the aquatic environment as a result of human activities. The chemicals chosen were copper, an abundant toxicant in sewage sludge, and cypermethrin the active compound of many insecticides. This report investigate the combined effect of cypermethrin and copper on Daphnia magna.

A mixture of copper and cypermethrin (30 : 70) gave an EC 50 value of 0. 685 ± 0. 137 TU.

40|$|In {{the last}} decades the {{production}} and use of nanomaterials, such as titanium dioxide nanomaterials (nano-TiO 2), increased extensively. To support a sustainable nanotechnology, {{it is essential to}} investigate the environmental risks of nanomaterials. However, it remains unclear whether {{in the context of the}} European Chemical Regulation Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) the nano and bulk form of a substance have to be registered separately or not, and if parameters considered with approved and standardized test guidelines (OECD) are sufficient to describe the potential environmental implications of manufactured nanomaterials. These guidelines do not consider relevant exposure scenarios such as solar radiation and mixture toxicity which might be of special importance for manufactured nanomaterials, including nano-TiO 2 which is known to be photoactive and to adsorb organic co-contaminants. Therefore, we conducted water flea tests with nano-TiO 2 (Daphnia magna, OECD 202) under laboratory light (LL) and simulated solar radiation (SSR) and examined the potential mixture toxicity of nano-TiO 2 materials and the organic antimicrobial substance triclocarban to earthworms (Eisenia fetida, OECD 207 and 222), daphnids, fish embryos (Danio rerio OECD 236) as well as to activated sludge (OECD 209). Different sized uncoated, anatase TiO 2 materials were tested to account for particle size specific effects (nanomaterials: NM 101, 7 - 10 nm and NM 102, 15 - 25 nm; bulk: NM 100, 200 - 220 nm). Furthermore, we investigated: a) whether the ionic strength of the test medium has an influence on the outcome of Daphnia sp. acute immobilisation tests of nano-TiO 2 materials; b) whether solar radiation influences the aquatic toxicity of TCC and the extent of potential mixture toxicity of nano-TiO 2 and organic co-contaminants; c) whether TCC has an effect on the reproduction of earthworms; d) whether oxidative stress was induced in earthworms by nano-TiO 2, TCC and mixtures of both. We showed that in contrast to Daphnia sp. acute immobilisation tests in which solar radiation was considered (median effect concentration (EC 50), 48 h, SSR, NM 101, NM 102, NM 100 and TCC: 1. 28, 0. 53, 3. 88 and 0. 006 mg/L), standard tests were not able to adequately detect toxicity associated with nano and non-nano scale TiO 2 materials, as well as TCC (EC 50, 48 h, LL, NM 101, NM 102, NM 100 and TCC: 79. 52, > 50, > 50 and 0. 027 mg/L), resulting in an underestimation of the hazard associated with these materials to daphnids in the aquatic environment. Thus, we propose to develop guidance for including solar radiation in standardized OECD guidelines used for testing photoactive chemicals and nanomaterials. Phototoxicity of the TiO 2 materials was linked to the photoactivity measured by electron paramagnetic resonance, i. e., the total hydroxyl radical (•OH) formation rate of the TiO 2 particles comprising free and surface adsorbed •OH. The latter as well as phototoxicity were maximal for the intermediate sized particle NM 102. Thus, phototoxicity of TiO 2 materials to D. magna, although not inversely correlated, was shown to depend on particle size supporting the claim to the importance of testing nano and bulk forms of TiO 2 separately in the context of REACH. Our results confirm that 10 -fold diluted ISO medium (EC 50, 48 h, SSR, NM 102 /NM 101 : 0. 53 / 1. 28 mg/L) may be regarded as a more appropriate medium than ISO medium (EC 50, 48 h, SSR, NM 102 /NM 101 : 1. 1 / 2. 9 mg/L) for testing nanomaterials in the Daphnia sp. <b>acute</b> <b>immobilisation</b> <b>test,</b> in order to represent natural waters which have a lower ionic strength than ISO medium. Mixture toxicity tests revealed that TCC toxicity was either not influenced or significantly lowered by up to 64 %, 53 % and 74 % to daphnids, fish and earthworms at an TiO 2 application level of 1 mg/L (aquatic) and 1000 mg/kg dw (terrestrial). We suggest that toxicity was reduced because TCC adsorbed to nano-TiO 2, and consequently the bioavailability and toxicity of TCC was lowered. Mixture toxicity experiments with fish embryos revealed that TCC toxicity (EC 50, 96 h, dark/SSR: 74 / 80 µg/L) under solar radiation was lowered to a lesser extent (53 %) than under laboratory light (78 %) in the presence of nano-TiO 2 (NM 102), demonstrating that the interaction of nano-TiO 2 and organic co-contaminants can be influenced by environmental factors such as solar radiation. We showed that TCC negatively affected the survival as well as reproduction of earthworm at environmentally irrelevant concentrations (lethal concentration causing 10 % effect, LC 10, 14 d: 262 mg/kg dw; EC 50, 56 d: 243 mg/kg dw). However, we provided evidence that TCC uptake via food ingestion (bioaccumulation factor, BAF: 10. 3 ± 1. 1) results in a more pronounced uptake of TCC than via soil exposure (BAF: 2. 8 ± 0. 7). For an adequate risk assessment it has to be clarified whether TCC exposure via food (e. g. sludge) leads to a more pronounced toxicity of TCC to E. fetida than exposure via soil. Measurements of oxidative stress revealed that chronic TCC earthworm toxicity was not related to oxidative stress and that co-exposure to nano-TiO 2, as well as nano-TiO 2 itself also did not induce oxidative stress within earthworms. TiO 2 materials alone induced no effects to all test organisms, resulting in no observed effect concentrations (NOEC) of ≥ 50, 100 and 1000 ppm for daphnids, fish embryos, earthworms (acute and chronic) and activated sludge. In conclusion, this study shows that it is necessary to establish relevant exposure scenarios to assess the environmental risks of nano scale and non-nano scale TiO 2 materials and TCC. Furthermore, primary particle size of TiO 2 materials has to be considered in future regulations concerning nanomaterials to ensure their safe use...|$|E

40|$|The use of Percoll-purified treponemes in an assay {{similar to}} the Treponema pallidum <b>Immobilisation</b> <b>test</b> {{demonstrated}} that <b>immobilisation</b> of purified treponemes by seronegative normal human serum proceeded {{at a much higher}} rate than that of unpurified treponemes. This suggests that the removal of the testicular extract makes the treponemes more vulnerable to this action. A preincubation of the purified treponemes with the testicular extract from infected or uninfected testes delayed their rate of immobilisation to that demonstrated by the unpurified treponemes. This showed that substances produced during the infection are probably not responsible for the delay in immobilisation. Discrimination between the classical and the alternative pathway of complement activation, studied by the ethylene glycol-bis (beta-aminoethyl ether) N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (EGTA) method, showed that the classical pathway was responsible for the rapid immobilisation of the purified treponemes. However, the slow immobilisation in the EGTA-serum samples suggested a minor role of the alternative pathway in the immobilisation of the purified treponemes. Since the testicular extracts exerted an anti-complement activity, it needs to be investigated whether the protection offered to the purified treponemes by the testicular extracts is based on their deteriorating effect on the classical complement pathway or is due to a re-establishment of the protective cover around the treponemes...|$|R
40|$|Using the 96 hours growth {{inhibition}} test {{on the green}} alga Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata and the 48 hours <b>immobilisation</b> <b>test</b> on the microcrustacean Daphnia magna, surface waters used for field irrigation and ground waters used for livestock watering were respectively screened for toxicity. This was done in order to generate a priority list of water samples to be further checked by chemical analysis for various contaminants. Fifty livestock watering sources and fifty field irrigation sources were monitored. From each site four samples (one in each season) were collected. Irrigation samples were filtered and then diluted in algal medium before testing. Livestock watering samples were filtered, their salinity and pH adjusted to those of D. magna medium, and then tested without dilution. The large majority of irrigation samples tested positive, particularly those collected during the summer season, where some samples showed more than 50 % algal {{growth inhibition}} even at the highest dilution (1 : 8). Effects of ground water samples on D. magna were moderate, {{and the majority of}} samples tested negative. Positive samples generally caused not more than 10 % immobilisation and were considered only as suspected toxic, some samples caused 15 - 45 % immobilisation while only a few samples, collected during the summer season, caused 45 - 60 % <b>immobilisation.</b> Altogether the <b>tests</b> showed to be sensible enough for the prioritisation of the water samples and confirmed that both surface and ground waters are more contaminated during the summer season, probably due to the massive use of fertilizers and pesticides on crops during the spring-summer period.

From each site, four water samples (one in each season) were collected {{during the period from}} summer 2009 through to spring 2010. Surface water samples and ground water samples were first screened for toxicity using the growth inhibition test on Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata and the <b>immobilisation</b> <b>test</b> on Daphnia magna, respectively. Then, {{based on the results of}} these toxicity tests, 28 ground water samples and 26 surface water samples were submitted to chemical analysis for various contaminants (insecticides/ acaricides, fungicides, herbicides, metals and anions) by means of UPLC-MSn HPLC-MSn, AAS and IEC. With the exception of one surfacewater samplewhere the total pesticides concentration was greater than 4 μg L− 1, positive samples (51. 9 %) showed only traces (nanograms per liter) of pesticides. Metals were generally under the detection limit. High concentrations of chlorines (up to 692 mg L− 1) were found in some ground water samples while some surface water samples showed an excess of nitrites (up to 336 mg L− 1). Detected levels of contamination were generally too low to justify the toxicity recorded in bioassays, especially in the case of surface water samples, and analytical results painted quite a reassuring picture, while tests on P. subcapitata showed a strong growth inhibition activity. It was concluded that, from an ecotoxicological point of view, surface waters used for field irrigation in the Veneto region cannot be considered safe...|$|R

Repeated immobilisation protocols (6 days, 1 h/day and 13 days, 2 h/day) were used to diminish the influence of <b>acute</b> <b>immobilisation</b> stress on c-Fos expression and analgesia (tail-flick test) induced by electroacupuncture on the 36 S point (EA 36 S). Animals submitted to immobilisation alone (IMMO) or to electroacupuncture (100 Hz, 2 - 4 V, faradic wave) on a non-point region (EANP) were compared with animals submitted to electroacupuncture on the 36 S point. in animals not previously submitted to repeated immobilisation, electroacupuncture on the 36 S point induced analgesia and c-Fos expression in the PAG was not different from that induced by electroacupuncture at a non-acupuncture point. in animals submitted to repeated immobilisation (repeated immobilisation for 6 days or repeated immobilisation for 13 days), however, electroacupuncture on point 36 S led to higher levels of analgesia and c-Fos expression, specifically in the ventrolateral PAG (v 1 PAG), as compared with animal groups subjected only to immobilisation or to electroacupuncture on a non-point. Our findings endorse previous results, and point to a specific part of the PAG involved in the effects of electroacupuncture at the Zusanli point. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved.

The {{development of}} fast, simple and miniaturisable analytical {{systems for the}} detection of these compounds is an impor-tant goal in analytical chemistry. In this chapter we present the re-sults obtained in the developing cholinesterase biosensor for nerve agent detection characterised by high shelf and operational stability. Different types of <b>immobilisation</b> were <b>tested</b> immobilizing in dif-ferent ways the acetylcholinesterase from electric eel and butyrylcholinesterase from horse serum on the screen printed elec-trodes chemically modified with the electrochemical mediator Prus-sian Blue (PB-SPEs). The enzymatic activity of the immobilized en-zymes was thus measured in amperometric mode at + 200 mV vs Ag/AgCl using as substrate the acetylthiocholine and butyrylthiocholine, respectively, quantifying the enzymatic product thiocholine by means of PB-SPEs. The biosensor with butyrylcholinesterase immobilized using glutaraldehyde, bovine se-rum albumin and Nafion® has demonstrated a shelf life higher than 6 months at RT in dry condition and an operational stability up to 10 hours. The biosensor was challenged with Sarin gas. The enzymatic measurements were carried out also measuring the rate of enzymatic activity in the first 30 sec. by means of a new version of Palm Sens® instrument software. In this way, the time of analysis was lower than 2 min. Keeping in mind that the IDLH (Immediately Dangerous to Life or Health) is 0. 1 mg/m 3, this biosensor with kinetic measure-ments supported by the Palm Sens® software allows to detect 0. 1 mg/m 3 in 90 sec, demonstrating that is an useful analytical system for environmental security...|$|R

À l’Université de Montréal, le Centre d’étude du sommeil naissait il y a environ 40 ans et a grandi pour devenir en 2012 le Centre d’études avancées en médecine du sommeil (CÉAMS). Le CÉAMS, c’est 14 chercheurs, plus de trente stagiaires de {{recherche}} et un personnel hautement qualifié. C’est un laboratoire de 1, 500 mètres carrés comprenant 10 salles d’enregistrement polygraphique du sommeil, 3 laboratoires d’isolation temporelle pour l’étude des rythmes circadiens, un laboratoire d’enregistrement EEG à haute densité, un système d’imagerie SPECT à haute résolution et une clinique qui agit comme lieu de formation clinique et comme centre de référence pour plusieurs pathologies du sommeil, telles que la narcolepsie, le bruxisme, le syndrome des jambes sans repos et le trouble comportemental en sommeil paradoxal. Cet article raconte l’histoire du CÉAMS, ses principales réalisations et ses projets d’avenir en parallèle avec le développement général de la médecine du sommeil. The Département de psychiatrie de l’Université de Montréal houses one of {{the first}} sleep centers founded 40 years ago. This center contributed to virtually every aspect of sleep medicine. It grew considerably over time to become {{one of the}} largest sleep centers worldwide. It is now called the Center for Advanced Research in Sleep Medicine (CARSM). Fourteen researchers and more than 30  research PhDs and postdoctoral fellows are working together in a 1, 500 square-meter facility that includes separate units for fundamental and clinical studies and for the sleep disorders clinic. It has 10 polysomnographic recording rooms, 3 isolated units devoted to chronobiological studies, a high resolution SPECT imaging laboratory specifically devoted to sleep research, a high-density EEG unit and a psychophysiological laboratory to study the interaction between pain and sleep. This article relates the history of the CARSM and also presents a personal sleep odyssey. The CARSM has been very active in the description of clinical features and definitions of the phenotype of most sleep disorders. It contributed specifically to the development of diagnostic tools in narcolepsy (the multiple sleep latency test in different age groups), in nocturnal epilepsy (development of a method to localize the primary focus using in-depth electrodes recording during rapid eye movement sleep), in sleep bruxism (a method for scoring masticatory muscle activity during sleep and definition of cut-off values), in the restless legs syndrome (RLS: the suggested <b>immobilisation</b> <b>test),</b> in sleepwalking (sleep deprivation and experimental awakenings) and REM sleep behaviour disorder (RBD: development of the first polygraphic method to diagnose RBD). The CARSM also contributed to the knowledge on the epidemiology of sleep disorders, conducting the first population-based prevalence study of RLS and of sleep bruxism. Researchers at the CARMS also looked at the impact of sleep disorders like narcolepsy, RLS, sleep apnea and the parasomnias on daytime cognitive functions and cardiovascular health. The CARSM collaborates with researchers throughout the world to elucidate the genetic bases of several disorders, especially narcolepsy, RLS, RBD and parasomnias in children and adults, through large well-defined cohorts of patients and normal subjects. Finally, the CARSM has made original contributions to the development of new treatments of sleep disorders, especially the dopaminergic treatments of RLS (first with levodopa and then with pramipexole). Current research also involves the identification of prodromal markers of Parkinson disease and dementia in patients with RBD as to build a ready-to trial cohort to test the efficacy of neuroprotective agents. In summary, the CARSM is a center dedicated to basic and clinical research on sleep and circadian rhythms. It is located at the Hôpital du Sacré-Coeur de Montréal but involves several other researchers at the Université de Montréal and at other universities in Canada and in the world...|$|R
40|$|The work {{detailed}} {{in this thesis}} is presented and discussed in six chapters, which constitute a general and progressive study into both inorganic and organic electron-coupled-proton buffers (ECPBs). ECPBs allow the decoupling of the oxygen evolving reaction and the hydrogen evolving reaction during electrolytic water splitting into two separated steps. A range of commercial and literature based inorganic polyoxometallates (POMs) were investigated to determine their redox potentials and solubility in aqueous media. Of these, the Keggin-structured POM silicotungstic acid (H 4 [SiW 12 O 40], STA) was investigated in detail. The cyclic voltammogram (CV) of STA shows two reversible 1 -electron redox waves on carbon electrodes at E 1 / 2 = + 0. 01 V vs. NHE and E 1 / 2 = – 0. 22 V vs. NHE, where the latter is cathodic of the reduction potential of hydrogen on platinum electrodes (E 1 / 2 = ± 0. 00 V vs. NHE). Electrochemical studies, in combination with gas chromatography show that H 4 [SiW 12 O 40] can be reduced by two electrons to form H 6 [SiW 12 O 40] on carbon electrodes, while effectively suppressing hydrogen evolution during electrolysis. The reduced H 6 [SiW 12 O 40] species can then be utilised for rapid and spontaneous hydrogen evolution, either on demand or via a continuous flow setup, if in contact with suitable catalysts. Platinum {{was found to be}} the best catalyst for spontaneous hydrogen evolution and was tested at a range of loadings, supported on carbon and ultimately indicated that an STA-based electrolytic system can utilise platinum up to 30 times more efficiently than a conventional proton-exchange-membrane electrolyser (PEME). A modified PEME was built for H 4 [SiW 12 O 40] reduction and various methods for catalyst <b>immobilisation</b> were <b>tested.</b> In an attempt to mimic photosynthetic water splitting, a range of quinone derivatives were also investigated as organic, low molecular weight ECPBs. 1, 4 -hydroquinone-sulfonic acid was found to efficiently decouple hydrogen and oxygen evolution, with a redox potential of E 1 / 2 = 0. 65 V vs. NHE and showed an 80...|$|R

The aim {{of the study was to}} examine the effects of a daily restraint of sows during the last third of gestation on endocrine stress reactions, immune responses and growth of the offspring. Stress and immune reactions of piglets were <b>tested</b> using an <b>immobilisation</b> and ACTH <b>test</b> at the ages of 3, 7, 21 and 35 days. Prenatally stressed piglets showed lower basal plasma cortisol and increased basal cortisol binding globulin concentrations at the age of 3 days compared to the control piglets. The prenatal stress treatment caused a decrease of glucocorticoid receptors in the hypothalamus, an enlarged adrenal cortex and a decreased thymus weight one day after birth. During the first days of life prenatal stress suppressed immune funetions as shown by lower IgG levels and decreased in vitro lymphocyte responses to T cell and B cell mitogens. In addition, prenatally stressed piglets showed a higher mortality after birth and a tendency for lower birth weights. In general, morphological, endocrine and immune effects of prenatal stress treatment were only observed in piglets during the first days after birth.

40|$|With {{a rising}} demand for {{nanomaterials}} and their continual increase in production, {{the release of}} nanoparticles (NPs) into the environment is inevitable (Petosa et al., 2010). Problematically, NPs can have {{a wide range of}} toxic effects, which are exacerbated by their size (at least one dimension smaller than 100 nm) (Engineering., 2004). Detrimental effects include brain, intestinal and respiratory injury, delayed embryonic development, DNA damage which ultimately lead to increased mortality (Trouiller et al., 2009), (Handy et al., 2008). Natural and manufactured NPs also have the ability to bind and transport chemical pollutants, thus enhancing their toxicity (Moore, 2006). While an array of techniques are available for in situ remediation of numerous groundwater contaminants, there are currently none for in situ remediation of nanoparticles. This fundamental technology gap means we are poorly prepared to deal with nanoparticle pollution events. The aim of this PhD was to develop mechanisms to immobilise and remove nanoparticles from water and waste water in order to prevent the transport of nanoparticles to sites where they have the potential to cause harm. Experiments conducted demonstrate the potential of microbially mediated mineral formation to immobilise nanoparticles from water. The ureolytic bacteria Sporosarcina pasteurii was used to induce calcium carbonate precipitation in batch and column experiments. Nanoparticle <b>immobilisation</b> was <b>tested</b> as a function of nanoparticle size and surface charge. The results demonstrate the successful immobilisation of negatively charged nanoparticles (both large and small, 150 and 35 nm respectively), while failing to remove positively charged nanoparticles from solution. In order to capture positively charged nanoparticles a second mineral, struvite, was tested. The precipitation of struvite successfully immobilised positively charged nanoparticles. However, in comparison to the calcite precipitation experiments the removal of positively charged nanoparticles was found to be pH and ionic strength dependant. Finally, the ability of Bacillus subtilis, a common groundwater bacterium and wastewater treatment biofilm to adsorb and remove nanoparticles from solution was examined. Here both biosorbent materials were highly efficient at removing positively charged nanoparticles from solution whilst negatively charged nanoparticles remained in suspension. The research presented here demonstrates that microbially induced mineral precipitation may be used as a tool to immobilise nanoparticles from contaminated groundwater. In addition, bacteria and wastewater treatment biofilm were found to be highly efficient biosorbents of positively charged nanoparticles. These findings hold implications for the fate and transport of nanoparticles through environmental systems and wastewater treatment plants...|$|R
40|$|This {{work was}} {{performed}} {{in the framework of}} two application-oriented research projects that focus on the generation and evaluation of fluorescent Saccharomyces (S.) cerevisiae-based sensor and reporter cells for white biotechnology as well as the extension of the conventional single-cell/single-construct principle of ordinary yeast biosensor approaches. Numerous products are currently generated by biotechnological processes which require continuous and precise process control and monitoring. These demands are only partially met by physical or physiochemical sensors since they measure parameters off-line or use surrogate parameters that consequently provide only indirect information about the actual process performance. Biosensors, in particular whole cell-based biosensors, have the unique potential to near-line and long-term monitor parameters such as nutrient availability during fermentation processes. Moreover, they allow for the assessment of an analyte’s biological relevance. Prototype yeast sensor and reporter strains derived from common laboratory strains were transformed with multicopy expression plasmids that mediate constitutive or inducible expression of a fluorescence reporter gene. Performance of these cells was examined by various qualitative and quantitative detection methods – representative of putative transducer technologies. Analyses were performed on the population level by microplate reader-based fluorometry and Western blot {{as well as on the}} single-cell level by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry. ‘Signature’ promoters that are activated or repressed during particular nutrient-limited growth conditions were selected in order to generate yeast nutrient sensor strains for monitoring the biological availability of nitrogen, phosphorus or sulphur. For each category, at least one promoter mediating at least threefold changed green fluorescence levels between sensor cells in non-limited and nutrient-limited conditions was identified. Sensor strains were evaluated in detail regarding sensitivity, analyte selectivity and the ability to restore basic fluorescence after shift from nutrient-limited to non-limited conditions (regeneration). The applicability for bioprocess monitoring purposes was tested by growth of yeast nutrient sensor cells in microalgae media and supernatants. Despite successful proof of principle, numerous challenges still need to be solved to realise prospective implementation in this field of white biotechnology. The major drawback of plasmid-borne detection constructs is a high fluorescence variance between individual cells. By generation of a nitrogen sensor strain with a genome-integrated detection construct, uniform expression on the single-cell level and simultaneous maintenance of basic properties (ability of fluorescence induction/regeneration and lack of cross-reactivity) was achieved. However, due to the singular detection construct per cell, significantly weaker overall fluorescence was observed. The traditional single-cell/single-construct approach was expanded upon in two ways. Firstly, a practical dual-colour sensor strain was created by simultaneous, constitutive expression of a red fluorescence reporter gene in green fluorescent nitrogen sensor cells. Secondly, an innovative cellular communication and signal amplification system inspired by the natural S. cerevisiae pheromone system and mating response was established successfully. It features the yeast pheromone alpha-factor as a trigger and alpha-factor-responsive reporter cells which express a fluorescence reporter gene from the pheromone-inducible FIG 1 promoter as an output signal. The system was functional both with synthetic and cell-secreted alpha-factor, provided that recombinant cells were deleted for the alpha-factor protease Bar 1 p. Integration of amplifier cells which secrete alpha-factor in response to stimulation with the pheromone itself could increase the systemś sensitivity further. Signal amplification was demonstrated for phosphorus sensor cells as a proof of concept. Therefore, the alpha-factor-based cellular communication and signal amplification system might be useful in applications that suffer from poor signal yield. Due to its modular design, the system could be applied in basically any cell-based biosensor or sensor-actor system. Immobilisation of the generated sensor and reporter cells in transparent natural polymers can be beneficial considering biosensor fabrication. Functionality of sensor and reporter cells in calcium-alginate beads or nano-printed arrays was successfully demonstrated. For the latter setup, fluorescence scanning and software-assisted fluorescence quantification was applied as a new detection method. In an experiment using an agarose-based two-compartment setup proposed by Jahn, 2011, properties of the alpha-factor-based cellular communication and signal amplification system after <b>immobilisation</b> were <b>tested.</b> These studies provide an initial experimental basis for an appropriate geometry of miniaturised immobilisation matrices with fluorescent yeast sensor and reporter cells in prospective biosensor designs...|$|R
