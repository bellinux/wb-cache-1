40|$|This paper examines, {{in a high}} {{technology}} context, how investor and investee behave, and interact, {{in the face of}} risk. The evidence on which it is based was obtained by fieldwork methods, over the period 2000 - 2, examining a sample of UK investors and investees active in {{high technology}} areas. The paper focuses on four questions: how risky are investments; what affects risk most; what aspects of innovation affect risk; what non-financial factors affect risk most? It finds that there was general agreement between investors and investees about which investments were relatively more or less risky. However, investees were shown to be relatively more risk averse than investors, right across the spectrum of investee types. When it came to factors affecting risk most, there was a clear difference between investors and investees. <b>Agency</b> <b>risk</b> was largely the concern of the investor. Business risk was the investee’s first priority, and <b>agency</b> <b>risk</b> did not figure large in the investee’s mind. This suggests that this component of risk had successfully been shifted on to the investor. Business risk was also a clear concern of investors, but they placed more emphasis o...|$|E

40|$|The {{research}} {{is focused on}} the risk management of SMEs in tourism industry. In estimation there are around 12, 000 tourism agencies locate in 656 different cities in China. However, the current operations and regulations of small domestic tourism agencies are still immature and ready to trigger a major failure. In the mean time, these tourism agencies become quite vulnerable when facing the challenges bring about constantly changing external economic environment, natural catastrophes, and industry competition. The researcher aims to create a whole set of risk management process which is simple to use, especially for those business owners who are lack of previous risk management experiences and those businesses which are financially incapable of hiring a professional risk management officer. Even though the proposed risk management methods are primarily originated from a case tourism agency in China, it also can to be applied to other SMEs in tourism sector of similar kind. Risk identification has been recognized as the basic and indispensable stage in the risk management process. In the case tourism <b>agency,</b> <b>risks</b> are specific to each production process and each step in each process. By identifying the steps that need to be completed successfully, we can identify the specific risks. On the other hand, concerning case tourism <b>agency’s</b> <b>risk</b> assessment, both the probability and severity of potential losses has been tackled. The risk will be ranked in some way which enables risk management resources to be allocated in a more cost-effective manner. The probability and impact of future contingent losses were estimated by using a five point scale in each case, which is easy for the owner to understand and apply. In the mean time, a simple hypothetical approach of testing the correlation between risks has been proposed. This approach has not been widely covered in the literature and it provides another way of looking at and prioritizing the risk. More specifically, risk which possesses both a higher level of probability and size of contingent loss deserves more risk management attention as it indicates a non-ambiguous sign of risk. In terms of case tourism <b>agency’s</b> <b>risk</b> management, initial examination has been done to determine whether the risks are transferable or not. And an important conclusion has been drawn that the nature of the important identified risks meant that market insurance was not available, and so self-insurance and self-protection were considered as alternatives...|$|R

30|$|Quite unsurprisingly then, {{the field}} of {{technology}} investing is ridden with dire risks of all kinds – technological, competitive, managerial, financial and those related to timely liquidity infusion (Mason and Harrison, 2004). In this paper, {{we focus on the}} risks emanating from information asymmetry between the VC and the entrepreneurs in India, while investing in high-technology domains. Such risks, that are invariably loaded against the VC firms (VCs) are of two kinds – one, adverse selection i.e. risks from ‘hidden information’ (entrepreneurs possess certain information not known to the VCs); and two, <b>Agency</b> <b>Risks</b> i.e. risks from hidden actions (entrepreneurs in the pursuit of their own self-interest can undertake certain actions not observable by the VCs) (Barry, 1994). VCs have devised several strategies to minimize the severity of such risks. Syndicating with other VCs, investing at earlier stages of the venture, domain specialization, and hiring erstwhile technology entrepreneurs on their investing teams {{are just a few of}} these (Joshi, 2016).|$|R

40|$|This work {{concerns}} {{the development of}} new methods of accounting for risk in high-technology ventures. The paper enquires into attitudes to risk and skills at risk management, in the relationship between high-technology firms and their venture capital backers. The basic prescription behind the proposed approach, building on work by the authors and co-workers [Reid (1996, 1999), Reid, Terry and Smith (1997) ], and other recent developments [e. g. Fiet (1995 a,b) ], is that as the venture capital industry matures, so should the techniques which high-technology firms and their venture capital backers use for risk management. If total risk is split up into innovation risk, business risk and <b>agency</b> <b>risk,</b> the main category of risk which hitherto the venture capitalist has sought to attenuate is <b>agency</b> <b>risk.</b> This has been addressed through improved management accounting systems, post-investment, and pre-commitment to the installation of such systems, pre-investment. However, success in this area has been incomplete, and attention to business and innovation risk has been severely limited. Lack of overall success in risk handling has, as a consequence, been a major cause of failure to provide adequate levels of outside finance for high-technology ventures, if appropriate yardstick comparison is made with US practise. This paper proposes a new research agenda, and a corresponding methodology, for investigating methods used for managing innovation, business and agency risks in investor-investee relations. Risk management, high-technology firms, accounting systems, economic...|$|E

There {{is a growing}} awareness among risk professionals (analysts, emergency managers, planners etc.) that the tools and processes for assessing risk and helping communities become resilient are inadequate. In order to strengthen the nation's resilience, FEMA should modify its Risk MAP process so that it addresses the ever changing conditions and risks communities face. In this system analysis, an asset-based appreciative inquiry risk assessment model (referred to in this thesis as the "ABAIRA Model") is compared to the Federal Emergency Management <b>Agency's</b> <b>Risk</b> MAP process. The ABAIRA Model expands upon an asset-based approach to Risk MAP (referred to in this thesis as the "Workshop Model") that the author helped develop and test {{at the request of}} the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Eight main problem areas for improvement are addressed. These include: (1) defining community resilience; (2) a risk assessment process that focuses on what really matters to a community, most importantly their human well-being; (3) effective community engagement; (4) incorporating community goals and plans into the risk assessment process; (5) identifying assets beyond just built capital, by including natural and social capital; (6) assessment of community capability; (7) identification and assessment of mitigation, risk reduction and resilience opportunity; and (8) incorporating risk assessment into other community planning processes.

40|$|Research Article The {{success of}} new ventures can hinge on obtaining venture capital (VC) funding. Virtually every {{successful}} IT venture has depended on VC funding early in its history. However, obtaining venture capital is difficult. Unlike earlier studies on VC funding that consider new ventures to be homogeneous, this study seeks to identify factors that VCs consider {{when they make}} funding decisions for IT ventures. Building on prior {{research in the area}} of agency and business risk, we develop a theoretical model that draws on work in finance and entrepreneurship. The model suggests that VCs consider two types of risk: business risk and <b>agency</b> <b>risk.</b> The relative importance of these two types of risk may be different across industries. We test this model using data from 139 business plans for IT startups that were considered for funding by VCs. Traditional structural equation modeling (SEM) does not accommodate non-normal data or dichotomous outcome variables. Using the Robust Weighted Least Squares approach, we test our model with non-normal data and dichotomous outcomes. In addition, we use Tetrad analysis to check model fit against alternative models, floor and ceiling analysis to test sample frame validity, relative effect size comparison to test relative elasticity of effects, and a Monte Carlo estimation approach to test overall model power and power of individual paths. We find that business risk is an important factor in startup funding for IT ventures. We do not find <b>agency</b> <b>risk</b> to be an important consideration in start-up funding for IT ventures...|$|E
40|$|Venture {{projects}} are fraught with exogenous market risk and endogenous <b>agency</b> <b>risk.</b> We apply a real options perspective {{to analyze the}} investment decision of the venture capitalist (VC) in this set-up. The solutions presented are conflictive: the VC reduces his exposure to exogenous risk by delaying investments to wait for informational updates (delay option), but he mitigates endogenous risk by advancing investments to discover entrepreneurs effort. So far, papers focus on the optimal timing of investments considering independence of exogenous and endogenous risk. We show that interdependence of exogenous risk and endogenous risk exists. We find that endogenous risk prompts the VC to accelerate the discovery process when exogenous risk is high, and to abandon the delay option when it is most valuable...|$|E
40|$|By {{combining}} {{insights from}} relational network theory and agency theory we identify the boundary conditions to the embeddedness approach to partner selection decisions in interfirm collaborations. Employing a longitudinal dataset comprising the investment syndicates {{for the population}} of UK management buyouts between 1993 and 2003, we find that relational embeddedness is less important for selecting partners when <b>agency</b> <b>risks</b> are low, allowing firms to expand their networks. Furthermore, reputational capital may act as a partial substitute for relational embeddedness, again permitting firms to expand their networks. Our findings enhance understanding of the boundary conditions associated with the relational network approach to partner selections and network behaviour. Copyright (c) 2010 The Authors.

40|$|Although just a {{minority}} of all small firms in the UK, high-growth entrepreneurial ventures are becoming widely recognised for their role in job growth and economic prosperity. However, due to their inherently high-risk nature, many of these early-stage firms experience difficulty in securing outside finance from institutional investors, which ultimately limits their growth and economic potential. Fortunately, two investor types, business angels (BAs) and venture capitalists (VCs), do fund {{a small proportion of}} these entrepreneurial ventures, although they, especially BAs, often have much more financial capital available for such investments. Since many aspects of BA and VC investment processes remain unknown, it is hoped that {{a better understanding of how}} and why these investors fund particular investments may aid in further lessening the entrepreneurial funding problem. This research study, therefore, conducts the first-ever detailed comparison of the investment criteria and procedures of these two financiers across the full investment process. To make the study more robust, a theoretical base is adopted (based on agency theory) to form research hypotheses which propose that BAs and VCs in the UK may use different approaches to limit potential <b>agency</b> <b>risks</b> in their investments (i. e. the risks associated with an entrepreneur's potential misuse of the investor's money). Utilising data from 40 personal interviews and 262 questionnaire responses, this study empirically supports the main hypothesised notion that, although both investors reduce <b>agency</b> <b>risks</b> at all stages of the investment process, BAs place more emphasis on doing so ex-post investment (the incomplete contracts approach), whilst VCs stress doing so more ex-ante investment (the principal-agent approach). In supporting the hypothese, empirical information is gathered about each investment stage and each investor group's heterogeneity. Possible implications of these findings are then discussed in the hope of aiding, no matter how slightly, the funding efficiency of small entrepreneurial firms. </p...|$|R
30|$|Quite interestingly, the VCs in {{this segment}} also exhibit {{the least amount of}} syndication, with just 33 % of their deals being syndicated. There could be many {{possible}} reasons for the same: Social capital necessary for syndication is distinctly lower for the FVCs {{in this segment}}. The <b>agency</b> <b>risks</b> arising from opportunistic behaviour by other syndication partners are high – particularly if VCs are geographically distant from the investee ventures and other peer VCs. This is particularly true for the FVCs in this segment since, none of them have offices at multiple locations within India and in fact 50 % do not even have a physical office in India. Accordingly, these FVCs are likely to encounter institutional barriers as also cultural barriers owing to low ethnicity composition (Li et al., 2014).|$|R
