All we’ve {{been doing all}} day is gape at the sky. All the ships for the air show have started to come in. Everything from an L- 4 to a JP- 59 came in today, and it’s just the beginning. Even my baby, the A- 26 came in, and is that a ship, honey. Gosh it {{streaked}} through {{the air like a}} bolt of lightning. That’s the flyin’est ship I ever saw. About 40 P- 40 ’s have come in, a whole mess of 25 ’s, 26 ’s, 2 ̆ 6 17 ’s too. The B- 29 ’s are expected tomorrow. God knows where they’re going to park those trucks. I haven’t heard from you so far this week, I hope you’re O. K., not sick or anything. Gosh, darling, this week is dragging like all the others. I thought maybe with this good weather that the time would pass faster because I’m busy. It doesn’t—I guess nothing can speed up the time when I’m away from you my darling. To make it worse I’m constantly being reminded of you, because for some strange reason I seem to have contracted a slight cough from you. I can’t understand it, I thought I gave it back to you Sunday, well I guess I’ll just have to try <b>again.</b> <b>Tomorrow</b> <b>night,</b> I’m scheduled to fly, but I think we ought to have some snow by then, there’s a pretty strong front moving in with plenty of weather behind it. It ought to be clear Saturday, however. I don’t think I’ll fly Friday, there’s no schedule then, all the ships will be in the hangers {{to make room for the}} air show. Maybe, just maybe, I can get off Friday night, but I doubt it. I won’t know for sure until the end of this week. They’ve been piling homework on us this week darling, so I’ll have to get to work. I miss you darling, more this week than I ever did before. I love you, too, angel. Take care of yourself and write as often as possible. I’ll call you around seven Thursday. Un[t]il then—I love you.

Miss Dorothy Six 8 Brookside Ave. Pelham, 65 New York [Transcription begins]:STEWART FIELDNEWBURGH, NEW YORK Thursday 2030 Dearest Dottie, What a mad {{day this}} has been. I flew two hours this morning, {{then went to}} ground school. Then in the afternoon, more ground school, P. T., armed session with the link trainer, {{a bite to eat}} then the toughest two hours I ever spent in the air. Tonight from six ‘til eight I was flying dual {{instruments}} with my instructor. It’s O. K. with me to fly instruments, but when you’re doing it to save your neck it’s something different. About seven we were cruising around up near Albany when it started to snow, and I mean snow! I could hardly see the wingtips, just a red 2 ̆ 6 green blur where the lights were. So about that time my jolly companion decides it’s time to go home, so we got on the beam and started, along with everything else. The damned ship began to ice up, the carburator [sic] included, the lights in my cockpit went out, and precipitation static (caused by the friction of the snow on the plane) blanked out the radio. And to make it worse, I had to go so bad my back teeth were floating. My God what a trip. But we made it. I’ve got 22 hours and five minutes of the extra thirty now, and if we keep flying like we have been, I’ll be through around Tuesday, and maybe they’ll let us off early for Christmas. I’ll probably fly <b>again</b> <b>tomorrow</b> <b>night</b> since I need some more instrument time. I’m sure of flying all day Saturday, we’re going to try to run off that Cross Country if the weather’s good. And if it isn’t, I’ll fly Sunday. If I do I’ll call you, as you know darling. (Can you read my writing? I can’t) O. K. hon, you don’t have to wear your hair up, but sometime I want to see you with it up. I know I’d like it that way, but I guess I’d like it any way you wore it. I love you darling. I got a letter from Don today. He wished us both a lot of happiness, and sent his best to you, honey. He’s in North Carolina now, also he’s a P. F. C. He expects to go overseas in about three or four weeks. He’s leaving from the West Coast, so that means the Pacific I guess. It’s too bad he couldn’t have gotten home for Christmas. He was quite surprised to hear about us, naturally. I think he’s always liked you hon, but how could he help it. Say hon, when you write Bob again, say hello to him for me. I’m looking forward to seeing him around Christmas. Steve seems to think a lot (please excuse this letter, hon, what a mess!) of Woody. I don’t know whether he’s madly in love with her, I don’t know him well enough, but he talks about her a lot, and wants to see her this weekend, that should prove something. It’s pretty nice to be in love with you too darling, except when I’m trying to concentrate on anything except you, or when I’m trying to write to you, it’s hard not to tell you every other line how wonderful, sweet, and lovely you are, or how much I love you, my darling. Well, angel, I’ve got to stop writing now, and be content with just thinking about you, (for a change). I love you, darling, I’ll always love you with all my heart. I miss you terribly and think of you always. I love you— Judd[Transcription ends...|$|E

Every time I {{hear from you}} I just can’t believe I’m so lucky. You’re so wonderful—I’m so glad that you didn’t {{go to the movies}} on Sunday, honey, and wrote instead. It was so nice to get such a real long letter from you—I hope you write <b>again</b> <b>tomorrow</b> <b>night</b> (That’s last night) —Very complicated, huh? I miss you, too, honey. Golly, every week it gets worse 2 ̆ 6 worse or maybe better 2 ̆ 6 better. It all depends on how you look at it. Yes, it did see[m] rather funny to have you put me on a train for a change. I like it anyway. I hate trains now, though. They’re always {{separating}} us. Well, I still don’t know about my job. They haven’t said anything but that’s not good or bad. Don’t know what they’ll do now. I sure do hope they wait until after March, because I do want to get their dresses for when we’re married. I didn’t want to say anything about it this weekend. Oh, well, what will be, will be. (Freddy Slack is playing “A Woman always Pays. ”) The words are so right, too. Oh, honey, my hair doesn’t look well up 2 ̆ 6 I don’t feel comfortable with it up either. The only time I could be happy with it up is in the summer. Honestly, honey, I’d be unhappy with it up 2 ̆ 6 cold besides. Lord, if you think I look nice in the morning when I wake up, then I’m afraid you’re in for a big disappointment. Oh, the without makeup part isn’t so bad. I have natural color, thank heavens 2 ̆ 6 I never have had to wear any make up but lipstick but oh—well, you’ll have to wait til March to be disillusioned anyway. When I wake up I won’t have just brushed my hair 2 ̆ 6 that will make a big difference—believe me, you won’t like it. Tell me some more things to do {{to get you out of}} bad moods. I don’t think that any of the things you mentioned would be sufficient to do it. I was in a pretty sad mood, too but we both got out of them o. k. Yes, hon, we do have the same moods together. Pretty much the same anyway. I just hope we both never get real mad at the same time. That I wouldn’t like to see. Yes, hon, for a change we did a lot of talking or rather you did a lot of talking. No, you didn’t say too much. I’m glad that you told me about your little shall we say adventures or what would you like to refer to them as? You know I believe in telling the truth and that I’d much rather have you tell me about things you’ve done than hear about them from someone else. Even if I never did hear about them from anyone else, I’m glad you told me. I hope you’ll always be frank (oh, how can you be when you [are] Judson) —but seriously, honey, I am glad you told me. I hope there aren’t any more but I hope if there are you’ll tell me. Golly, honey, this war seems to be going on 2 ̆ 6 on 2 ̆ 6 on. I don’t think it will ever end. It would be wonderful if it ended before March. I know how you feel about going over and getting a crack at the Japs but I hate to think of all the kids that are going to be killed before it ends. I’m afraid a lot of the fellows that I write to aren’t going to be interested in getting any mail from me now that we’re engaged. It will probably change their outlook on the situation a little—Gee, I love you, honey. Well, my little weather bureau for once you were almost right. It did snow, of course, not when you expected it, at least not here anyway. It was very exciting 2 ̆ 6 I hope we have a white Christmas. That reminds me I have to get a pair of shoes with ties in them so that if it does snow my toes won’t get wet. I have the simplest mind. Honestly—the way I ramble on 2 ̆ 6 on. How do you ever read my letters more than once. I never read them over. Writing them is confusing enough. They weren’t meant to be read more than once over lightly. Gee, darling, I love you so. You’re the most wonderful man in the world. I love you so. Honey, how many hours do you have left out of the thirty you were supposed to have finished at the end of this training? Very many? Betty Grable is on the Dick Haymes show now—stop drooling!! Gee, Harry James sure did all right for himself. Remember that night at the Meadowbrook? How could you forget. Look what happened. You’re practically a married man! Got a letter from Bob last night. It was a riot as usual. He said he’s going to come 2 ̆ 6 see me this Christmas 2 ̆ 6 watch me blush. Fine. He didn’t mention what he was going to say but that’s beside the point. He really is a good guy. I’m glad you like ‘always’ now. Yes, I like “Always” 2 ̆ 6 think that would be a pretty good song—I’m afraid there are a couple of songs, popular now, that remind me of you much more, though. One is “I Didn’t Know About You” and another is “There Goes That Song Again. ” (Helen Forest is singing “Don’t Ever Change. ” That’s nice too.) Paper Moon 2 ̆ 6 “Her Tears Flowed Like Wine” also remind me of you very much. Honey, do you think Steve is serious about Woody? Is he going to be your best man? You asked him, didn’t you or didn’t you? Gee, I love you so, honey. You have all my love so I can’t send you any more. Oh, this morning I rode down with Woody. She was talking away and I was dreaming about you 2 ̆ 6 she’d be asking me something over five times before I’d notice it. We (she came over to where I work) went to look at raincoats 2 ̆ 6 went home together. She got her report marks or something 2 ̆ 6 they were all good. Did quite a bit of Christmas shopping this noon time—I was dropping packages all the way home. Woody just called 2 ̆ 6 I sprayed that spray 2 ̆ 6 am sitting here sniffing. Reminds me of last Saturday night. My father was murdering me to get me off the phone. Well, now I can write you more. Gee, I love you so, my darling. You’re so wonderful. It’s so nice to be in love with you. Honey, what do you wish usually? Tell me, please. Darling, I love you so. Gee, I can imagine you waking me up in the morning—I hate to get up. Jackie was telling me how Greg [?] calls until he’s almost hoarse to get her up but she just rolls over. I detest waking up. Maybe if you’re doing the waking I won’t mind it so much. Well, sweetheart, I’d better get some of the millions of things I should be doing done—what a sentence! Anyhow, since I got home from work I’ve just eaten 2 ̆ 6 written you. I love you, honey. All my love,Dottie the Morse Code Iunderstood—ditto— P. S. I love you, my darling. I hope this week doesn’t take too long. [Transcription ends...|$|E

No one is in yet, honey, so I decided this would be about the best time to write a little to you. Golly, honey, I miss you so. I hope that you can get home this weekend. Everything has gone wrong. First of all {{yesterday}} was not one of my good days. You called and said you might have to fly on Sunday. That alone would have been enough bad news for a whole week but no. Everything else went wrong too. A couple of minor things happened and then another major catastrophe (words, why didn’t I learn to spell). It was about your Christmas present. The thing I wanted to get you, they didn’t have and would have to order. I don’t know what to do now. I don’t want to get anything else but it will be two or three weeks at least before they can get that. I’m so disappointed. Now I don’t know what to do. I’m very unhappy about the whole thing. Gee, honey, everything sure goes wrong at once. If you don’t get an overnight pass, honey, {{would you like me to}} come up for a while Saturday or Sunday or something? I just couldn’t stand a whole week or two weeks without seeing you. Gee, I miss you so, my darling. I don’t think I’ll ever be able to see you often enough. I fall in love with you all over again twice as much every time I see you though. I never believed that I could love anyone as much as I love you, honey. Gee, honey, the radio said it would be nice today and tomorrow, but they didn’t mention what would happen on Saturday. I’m praying for nice weather. How long did you fly last night? Hope you get in a lot of hours so that you get home this weekend. Golly, honey, I’ve just got to see you soon. I love you so, honey and it’s so lonesome being away from you even for a few hours. When it grows into days 2 ̆ 6 weeks, it’s awful. Will Steve get home this weekend? Woody is very unhappy—too—this weekend. Don’t remember what I was going to say but anyhoo, I’m home now darling. I’m in a much happier state now. Maybe soon I’ll be in the state of matrimony. Ah, yes. Well, my darling, guess what. I got your Christmas present. Two of them—one tonight quite unexpectedly and the other at noon today. It wasn’t quite what I wanted but it’s O. K. at least I hope you’ll like them. (Both of them—the one at night 2 ̆ 6 the noon one). Golly I’m tired and as you can see nothing makes sense that I write. What a conversation I could carry on. There’s a plane over here now 2 ̆ 6 I just turned out my light and looked for it but couldn’t see anything. Gee, I love you so. You’re so marvelous. I got your letter tonight, hon, and it was so very sweet. I wish I were there to keep you warm too. Now you be careful when it’s cold like that because your resistence [sic] is low, or isn’t it and I wouldn’t like you to catch a cold. Especially when I catch them so easily. It’s pretty cold around here but I’m awfully hot (no cracks!!). Have a sweater (nice and baggy) on and the heat is going on every few seconds. Well, honey, what happened. You finally learned to spell Tuesday! Congrats! I’m glad you liked “Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo. ” I’ll have to go see it. Well, it didn’t rain or anything today honey, but it was plenty cold. I’ll bet you froze there because it was 22 ° here. I wasn’t cold at all though. Must have my love to keep me warm now. The radio said it would be nice tomorrow. What’s going to happen Saturday is what worries me. I sure hope that it’s real nice Saturday 2 ̆ 6 you go on that cross country flight. How many hours have you gotten in now, honey? I sure hope that you don’t have to fly this weekend. I love you so, honey, and it would be so awful not to see you. I know I’ll never see enough of you, my darling. I’ll be trying all my life, though. Every time I’m with you I love you so much more. There are so many more things I love about you now than there were at first. You’re so wonderful. Your line certainly is improving with age or is it practice? Anyhoo, I love you, and I love your line too. Honey, what do you want to do this weekend? Should I call the Meadowbrook, honey, or what? I know Steve is coming down Saturday. He has a date with Woody. What’s this about his going back to the field Sunday morning? Gee, I hope you’re going to like your Christmas presents, darling. Your anniversary present isn’t quite ready yet but it will be soon. Does it seem to you that we’ve been officially engaged for almost a month? Gee, next week is Christmas. I just can’t believe it, darling. Well, my darling, I have to get a couple of things done. I’ll write again tomorrow, hon. I sure hope that you don’t have to fly this weekend. I love you so. Please let me know as soon as possible whether you can get home this weekend or not. If you can’t do you want me to come up? I love you so, honey. Please write whenever you can. I’m praying for good weather, hon. I miss you “awfully much!” You’re the only “thing” (get that) that I ever think about. I always do think about you, honey. I love you so. I’ll love you always, forever and always. All my love,Dottie P. S. here’s a page that I left out of one of the letters I wrote you. It was quite a few days ago. Probably a week or so but here it is anyhoo. I love you, honey. [Written in margin at the top of page]:here’s the one that was under the bed for so long Friday Dearest Judson— It’s really wonderful to have you come home in the middle of the week. I just can’t believe that you’ll be home again tomorrow. That sounds so nice. Today has seemed like Monday all day. I was just as tired as I usually am on Mondays too. Charlotte 2 ̆ 6 I went to the movies last night 2 ̆ 6 saw “Gypsy Wildcat” 2 ̆ 6 Music in Manhattan. ” We both liked them a lot but I guess we’re easily pleased or something. Golly, I miss you so. I’m so glad that I don’t have to wait a whole week to see you again. I just can’t believe that you’re coming home <b>again</b> <b>tomorrow</b> <b>night.</b> I do wish you’d learn to spell Tuesday. You always have the worst time with that day. I haven’t much time to write tonight because I have to leave here at eight. It’s almost seven thirty now 2 ̆ 6 I have to eat yet. Honey, isn’t it wonderful now that your mother’s given her consent. It makes me feel so much better 2 ̆ 6 happier. You have to go on that cross-country flight tomorrow, so please be careful, darling. No more forced landings or anything. Hope that you get home early and that Steve doesn’t have to walk those tours. I do think he 2 ̆ 6 Woody will have a good time together. What do you mean that Ginis too childish? You sound as if you mean a few different things. I’ll ask you tomorrow anyway if I can remember. Oh, our engagement was in the paper. I just found out that the Mt. Vernon paper had it in last night. The Standard put it in tonight. The picture is so dark that you can’t see anything, which is probably the best thing. I’d send it to you but we only have one paper 2 ̆ 6 Daddy will want to see it. Haven’t seen the other one but Woody read it to me over the phone. Gee, I’d love to see a few people in Mt. Vernon when they read that! They spelled Stewart Field wrong, honey, (Stuart Field) oh, well. It doesn’t seems [sic] real still. Seeing it in the paper seems so much more unreal. I just had to go downstairs 2 ̆ 6 talk to mother—my grandmother hasn’t an ounce of brains, I’m almost sure. She tells mother how awful the picture looks 2 ̆ 6 how bad my ankle is 2 ̆ 6 gets her all upset. Honestly, there’s going to be a murder around here soon. It’s awfully hard to go up 2 ̆ 6 down stairs without stepping on my foot so she has me go down to talk to mother—women! She’s gotten mother all upset now. Somehow or other I forgot to write on this— If I could draw I’d draw a lovely picture then you wouldn’t know the difference. What have I got to lose— [stick-figure illustration of a person lying on a bed with foot elevated and a dog on the floor. Parts of drawing have been labeled “me,” “sore ankle,” “bed,” and “Rex. ”] Oh, well, so I’m a failure. [Transcription ends...|$|E
