5|$|Myers {{worked at}} Mohawk Valley Bank for six years. During {{this time he}} {{developed}} an interest in counterfeit money. He collected counterfeit bills and assembled <b>a</b> <b>scrapbook</b> of these for study. He then had another book of genuine bills; he then compared the two to learn the counterfeiters' techniques. He became an expert in detecting counterfeit bills. This became a valued interest to the bankers and Myers was given all the bank notes to pass through him for approval of genuineness. This ultimately became {{a basis for the}} present day method of detecting counterfeit bills.|$|E
5|$|Sir Nicholas' kindertransport efforts {{remained}} largely unrecognised until 1988, {{when they came}} to public attention after his wife found <b>a</b> <b>scrapbook</b> in their attic documenting the details. Only then did the individuals whom Winton arranged to have transported to safety as children learn the story of how they survived the Holocaust. As the majority of 'Winton's Children' (as they came to be known) were Jewish, it is believed this saved them from certain death had they stayed in Czechoslovakia. As of 2009, the direct descendants of Winton's Children numbered over 5000 people.|$|E

5|$|To prove {{she is able}} {{to handle}} her own affairs, Serena refuses to leave jail with either Lily or CeCe (Caroline Lagerfelt) {{although}} Lily drops the charges on which she had Serena arrested. Rufus (Matthew Settle) is also angry with Lily for Serena's arrest; Dan (Penn Badgley) and Jenny (Taylor Momsen) inform Vanessa (Jessica Szohr) that Rufus returned home without proposing to Lily, and he has remained in his bedroom ever since. Lily feuds with CeCe for telling Rufus about their lovechild. From jail, Serena encourages Blair (Leighton Meester) to enjoy prom with Nate (Chace Crawford) in the way Blair had chronicled in <b>a</b> <b>scrapbook</b> as a preteen, but each of the couple’s prom plans, such as the limo, hotel reservation and Blair's dress, inexplicably go awry. Nate suspects Chuck (Ed Westwick) of sabotaging the prom in an effort to win Blair back, but Chuck denies involvement. Dan convinces Serena to allow him to pay her bail and escort her to the Prom.|$|E
5|$|Murder on the Orient Express, as {{with its}} predecessor, {{features}} an inventory system. There are several {{components of the}} inventory, including a fingerprint examination screen, <b>a</b> <b>scrapbook,</b> and a passport screen for managing and viewing the passengers' passports. There are a total of eighty slots for carrying items in the inventory, spread across five separate screens. Items cannot be discarded from the inventory once they have been acquired. The player can access the inventory by clicking on an icon on the game's interface, or can simply right-click. After items are used, a right-click returns them to the inventory, and the exact slot they were originally placed in. Each item is labelled, and the player can inspect each inventory item in more detail by dragging it over a magnifying glass icon, and can also listen for a soft hissing sound which indicates {{that there is something}} relevant for the player to note about a certain item. In a divergence from other games in its genre, Murder on the Orient Express does not allow the player to combine items in the main inventory screen. There is a separate interface for item combinations, and the player must drag items into this screen if they wish to try to combine them.|$|E
5|$|The {{taxi driver}} and his {{companion}} hold Homer hostage {{deep into the}} rainforest. They force Homer {{to make a phone}} call to Marge, telling her that if the family provides 50,000 dollars to the kidnappers, he will be released. However, the Simpsons do not have enough money so they go looking for Homer instead. Walking through the streets of Rio de Janeiro, they run into a parade that features a Teleboobies float with characters from the show. Lisa is surprised to discover that Ronaldo is working inside the costume of the dancing flamingo from Teleboobies—a well-paid job he got after learning to dance with the shoes he bought with Lisa's donation money. Ronaldo tells Lisa that he stopped writing to her because he did not know which state she lives in, since it was the orphanage that used to send his letters. Later, Ronaldo gives the Simpsons the money they need to save Homer. Meanwhile, Homer shows the kidnappers <b>a</b> <b>scrapbook</b> he made of his kidnapping memories. Apparently, he has developed Stockholm syndrome. The family and the kidnappers then meet up high over a valley near the Sugarloaf Mountain in two separate cable cars. The Simpsons toss the kidnappers their money, and when Homer jumps into his family's cable car, the cables break, sending the family crashing into the mountainside and rolling down to the ground. They all survive unharmed, but Bart is then eaten whole by an anaconda. The episode ends with Bart dancing inside the snake to carnival music.|$|E

5|$|A {{few months}} later, Mick and Tina go to Babe's house to confront her, as Stan's ashes have been {{replaced}} by custard powder, only to be greeted by a man who says that Babe has moved to Ramsgate. Along with Shirley, they track Babe down to a caravan in Ramsgate, where Babe states she was evicted from her house. Later, Shirley discovers <b>a</b> <b>scrapbook</b> of photos of young pregnant girls with due dates written on the back and realises that Babe and Queenie had kidnapped these girls and had their babies adopted out. Shirley is disgusted by Babe's actions and threatens to set her fire to her caravan, but Mick stops her. However, Babe burns the caravan down herself, realising that she needs to move on, and returns to Walford with Shirley, Mick and Tina. Linda's mother, Elaine Peacock (Maria Friedman), and her toyboy fiancé, Jason Adams (Scott Neal), temporarily move into the Vic. Babe does not trust Jason, although they have a passionate encounter, which is caught by Mick and Linda. Linda asks Babe to ensure Jason leaves Walford without informing Elaine of the reason, but when Elaine teases Babe, she reveals that she had sex with Jason. Elaine refuses to believe this, while Jason suggests that he and Babe steal from the pub and leave together. Babe secretly records the conversation and plays it to the Carters, who force Jason to leave. Babe admits to Elaine and Linda that she and Jason did not have sex and that she feels lonely. Babe continues to clash with Cora and is humiliated when Cora exposes her baby farming past to the Carter family and the pub's customers.
