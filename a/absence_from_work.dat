25|$|In September 1988, Dahmer's {{grandmother}} {{asked him}} {{to move out of}} her house because of his habit of bringing young men to her house late at night and the foul smells emanating from both the basement and the garage. Dahmer found a one-bedroom apartment on North 25th Street and moved into his new residence on September 25. The following day, Dahmer was arrested for drugging and sexually fondling a 13-year-old boy whom he had lured to his home on the pretext of posing nude for photographs. In January 1989, Dahmer was convicted of second-degree sexual assault and of enticing a child for immoral purposes. Sentencing for the assault was suspended until May 1989. On March 20, Dahmer commenced a ten-day Easter <b>absence</b> <b>from</b> <b>work,</b> during which he moved back into his grandmother's home.|$|E
25|$|After a few days, Jim Olive's {{business}} partner became {{concerned about his}} <b>absence</b> <b>from</b> <b>work</b> and contacted police, who visited the Olive house and spoke with Marlene Olive. She provided various alibis for herself and Riley, which the police later determined were false, and stories about her parents having either disappeared or died, claiming that one parent had killed the other and then disappeared with the body or that both parents were killed by Hells Angels. Police also noted the recently cleaned room in the otherwise disordered house. The friend who had helped clean informed the police about the blood {{in the room and}} the couple's statements about killing the Olives and burning their bodies. Acting either on information from Marlene Olive or from her friend, police searched the China Camp barbecue pit and determined that it contained fragments of burnt human remains. Marlene Olive and Riley were arrested.|$|E
2500|$|The {{financial}} cost of trauma includes both {{the amount of}} money spent on treatment and the loss of potential economic gain through <b>absence</b> <b>from</b> <b>work.</b> The average {{financial cost}} for the treatment of traumatic injury in the United States is approximately [...] per person, making it costlier than the treatment of cancer and cardiovascular diseases. One reason for the high cost of the treatment for trauma is the increased possibility of complications, which leads to the need for more interventions. Maintaining a trauma center is costly because they are open continuously and maintain a state of readiness to receive patients, even if there are none. In addition to the direct costs of the treatment, there also is a burden on the economy due to lost wages and productivity, which in 2009, accounted for approximately [...] in the United States.|$|E

2500|$|Falconer was {{a strong}} proponent of land reform. From {{the time of his}} first {{election}} address in the Forfarshire by-election he identified himself as a land reformer, supporting government proposals to give smallholders security of tenure at a fair rent and providing capital for new buildings. He took {{a leading role in the}} enacting of the Small Landholders (Scotland) Act of 1911 which incorporated the grant of security of tenure at fair rent into law [...] and he was the founder of the Scottish Rural Workers Society, a friendly society designed to provide social insurance payments in the event of sickness or prolonged <b>absence</b> <b>from</b> <b>work.</b> In 1925 he was appointed to a joint Board of Agriculture and Scottish Office inquiry into unemployment among farm workers and related social insurance schemes. In 1917 he served on the Board of Trade Parliamentary committee set to deal with the question of the cheap supply of electric power. The committee concluded that a national, comprehensive system for the generation and supply of electricity at the cheapest possible rate should be instituted after the end of the Great War to ensure the competitiveness of the industry, replacing the current organisation of the industry in small areas under many separate authorities which were not large enough to research or sustain the necessary scientific improvements.|$|E
2500|$|The Hospital Financing Law (1972) {{secured the}} supply of {{hospitals}} and reduced the cost of hospital care, [...] "defined the financing of hospital investment as a public responsibility, single states to issue plans for hospital development, {{and the federal government}} to bear the cost of hospital investment covered in the plans, rates for hospital care thus based on running costs alone, hospitals to ensure that public subsidies together with insurance fund payments for patients cover total costs". The Benefit Improvement Law (1973) made entitlement to hospital care legally binding (entitlements already enjoyed in practice), abolished time limits for hospital care, introduced entitlement to household assistance under specific conditions, and also introduced entitlement to leave of <b>absence</b> <b>from</b> <b>work</b> and cash benefits {{in the event of a}} child's illness. In 1971, to encourage the growth of registered family holiday centres, the Federal Government granted subsidies for the building and appointing of 28 of these centres at a total cost of 8 million DM. Free preliminary investigations were introduced for 2.5 million children up until the age of 4 for the early detection and correction of developmental disorders, and health research was expanded. Federal grants were increased, especially for the Cancer Research Centre in Heidelberg, while a Federal Institute for Sport Science was set up, together with the Institute for Social Medicine and Epidemiology in Berlin. In addition, funding for new rehabilitation facilities was increased.|$|E
50|$|In Hungarian, {{the word}} vakáció can mean both a {{recreational}} trip, an officially granted <b>absence</b> <b>from</b> <b>work</b> (generally in warmer months), {{and the summer}} (longest) school break.
