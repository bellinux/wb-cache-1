500|$|From 1842 Bennett {{had been}} a {{director}} of the Philharmonic Society of London. He helped to relieve the society's perilous finances by persuading Mendelssohn and Spohr to perform with the Society's orchestra, attracting full houses and much-needed income. In 1842 the orchestra, under the composer's baton, gave the London premiere of Mendelssohn's Third (Scottish) Symphony, two months after its world premiere in Leipzig. In 1844 Mendelssohn conducted the last six concerts of the society's season, in which among his own works and those of many others he included music by Bennett. From 1846 to 1854 the Society's conductor was Michael Costa, of whom Bennett disapproved; Costa was too devoted to Italian opera and not a partisan of the German masters, as was Bennett. Bennett wrote to Mendelssohn on 24 July, displaying some querulousness, [...] "The Philharmonic Directors have engaged Costa... with which I am not very well pleased, but I could not persuade them to the contrary, and <b>am</b> <b>tired</b> <b>of</b> quarrelling with them. They are a worse set this year than we have ever had." ...|$|E

An {{estimated}} 250,000 to 375,000 attended San Francisco's Gay Freedom Day Parade; newspapers claimed the higher numbers were due to John Briggs. Organizers asked participants to carry signs indicating their hometowns for the cameras, to show how far people came to live in the Castro District. Milk rode in an open car carrying a sign saying [...] "I'm from Woodmere, N.Y." [...] He gave a version of what became his most famous speech, the [...] "Hope Speech", that The San Francisco Examiner said [...] "ignited the crowd":On this anniversary of Stonewall, I ask my gay sisters and brothers to make the commitment to fight. For themselves, for their freedom, for their country... We will not win our rights by staying quietly in our closets... We are coming out to fight the lies, the myths, the distortions.

He wrote to his wife, [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>tired</b> <b>of</b> the sickening sight of the battlefield, with its mangled corpses & poor suffering wounded! Victory has no charms for me when purchased at such cost." [...] He redeployed all of his army except for the V Corps south of the river, and although he continued to plan for a siege and the capture of Richmond, he lost the strategic initiative. An offensive begun by the new Confederate commander, Gen. Robert E. Lee, would be planned while the Union troops passively sat in the outskirts of Richmond. The Seven Days Battles of June 25 through July 1, 1862, drove the Union Army back to the James River and saved the Confederate capital.|$|E

[...] I went to Michigan because several lawyers in my native town were graduates of that university and I always liked the place. [...] I do not regret my choice. [...] If President Jordan will talk facts rather than trash, he will change his attitude on my standing in college, so far as Michigan is concerned. [...] At Stanford I was only a special and I do not deny that my work was not of a high order. [...] At Michigan I never flunked during my entire course, and what the conditions were against me when I entered I made up by working hard in summer school. ... I owe it to Michigan and athletics in general to state definitely that I did not receive one cent in connection with athletics while I was in Michigan." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1985, Warwick {{recorded}} the American Foundation for AIDS Research (AmFAR) benefit single [...] "That's What Friends Are For" [...] alongside Gladys Knight, Elton John and Stevie Wonder. The single, credited to [...] "Dionne and Friends", {{was released in}} October and eventually raised over three million dollars for that cause. The tune was a triple #1 — R, Adult Contemporary, and four weeks at the summit on the Billboard Hot 100 in early 1986 — selling close to two million 45s in the United States alone. [...] "Working against AIDS, especially after years of raising money for work on many blood-related diseases such as sickle-cell anemia, seemed {{the right thing to}} do. You have to be granite not to want to help people with AIDS, because the devastation that it causes is so painful to see. I was so hurt to see my friend die with such agony," [...] Warwick told the Washington Post in 1988. [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>tired</b> <b>of</b> hurting and it does hurt." [...] The single won the performers the NARAS Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal, as well as Song of the Year for its writers, Bacharach and Bayer Sager. It also was ranked by Billboard magazine as the most popular song of 1986. With this single Warwick also released her most successful album of the 1980s, titled Friends, which reached #12 on Billboard's album chart.|$|E

2500|$|Because Byrnes {{had been}} part of the US {{delegation}} at Yalta, Truman assumed that he had accurate knowledge of what had transpired. It would be many months before Truman discovered that this was not the case. Nevertheless, Byrnes advised that the Soviets were breaking the Yalta Agreement and that Truman needed to be resolute and uncompromising with them. [...] Although Byrnes' hard line against the Soviets paralleled the feelings of the President, personal relations between the two men grew strained, particularly when Truman felt that Byrnes was attempting to set foreign policy by himself, and only informing the President afterward. An early instance of this friction was the Moscow Conference in December 1945. Truman considered the “successes” of the conference to be “unreal” and was highly critical of Byrnes’s failure to protect Iran, which was not mentioned in the final communiqué. “I had been left in the dark about the Moscow conference,” Truman told Byrnes bluntly. In a subsequent letter to Byrnes, Truman took a harder line in reference to Iran, saying in part, [...] "Without these supplies furnished by the United States, Russia would have been ignominiously defeated. Yet now Russia stirs up rebellion and keeps troops on the soil of her friend and ally— Iran... Unless Russia is faced with an iron fist and strong language another war is in the making. Only one language do they understand—“” [...] I do not think we should play compromise any longer ...I <b>am</b> <b>tired</b> <b>of</b> babying the Soviets". [...] This led to the Iran crisis of 1946, and Byrnes took an increasingly hardline position in opposition to Stalin, culminating in a speech in Stuttgart on September 6, 1946. The [...] "Restatement of Policy on Germany", also known as the [...] "Speech of Hope", set the tone of future U.S. policy as it repudiated the Morgenthau Plan, an economic program that would permanently deindustrialize Germany. Byrnes was named TIME Man of the Year. Truman and others believed that Byrnes had grown resentful that he had not been Roosevelt's running mate and successor, and in his resentment he was disrespecting Truman. Whether this was true or not, Byrnes felt compelled to resign from the Cabinet in 1947 with some feelings of bitterness.|$|E
