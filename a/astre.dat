25|$|The Pontiac <b>Astre</b> is a subcompact {{automobile}} {{that was}} marketed by Pontiac as a rebadged {{variant of the}} Chevrolet Vega. Initially marketed in Canada for model years 1973-1974, the <b>Astre</b> debuted in the U.S. for the 1975 model year, competing with other domestic and foreign subcompacts that included the Mercury Bobcat, Volkswagen Rabbit, and Toyota Corolla.|$|E
25|$|For 1975, Pontiac {{introduced}} the new sub-compact <b>Astre,</b> {{a version of}} the Chevrolet Vega. This was the brand's entry into the fuel economy segment of the market. <b>Astre</b> had been sold exclusively in Canada from 1973. It was offered through the 1977 model year. 1975 would also see the end of Pontiac convertibles for the next decade.|$|E
40|$|The {{persistency}} of {{red clover}} (Trifolium pratense L.) can be poor when grazed in mixed and pure stands, {{but it is}} still regarded as a valuable source of high quality summer feed in some farming systems. Vegetatively reproductive red clover selections offer promise to solve this persistency problem. The objectives of this research were to study the growth, perennation, reproductive ability and productivity of vegetatively reproductive red clover selections. A series of nine spaced plant and mixed and pure sward experiments were conducted at Hastings, Dannevirke, AgResearch Grasslands and Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand (latitude 40 ° 23 'S) from 1995 to 1998. The vegetatively reproductive red clovers evaluated were cv. <b>Astred,</b> F 2419 and cv. Gualdo with Grasslands Pawera and Turoa used as controls. Preliminary investigations into the incidence of rooted plantlet production by prostrate red clover selections under grazing found 37, 16 and 5 rooted plantlets per parent plant for <b>Astred,</b> F 2419 and Turoa, respectively. <b>Astred</b> produced larger rooted plantlets which survived better than F 2419 and Turoa. <b>Astred</b> produced 57 % of its plantlets on primary stems, or branches off these stems, that grew from the parent plant crown in September, whereas F 2419 plantlets developed on a wider spread of stem ages. The majority of plantlets formed on quaternary branches at a range of distances (4 cm - 55 cm) from the parent plant crown. <b>Astred</b> produced less rooted plantlets per parent plant, had longer, wider leaves, thicker stems and was taller at 10 months of age than Gualdo. More rooted plantlets were established per <b>Astred</b> parent plant under wet surface soil conditions than dry conditions (22. 2 % and 3. 7 % gravimetric soil surface water content, respectively), but when the dry soil surface was watered, there was a compensatory {{increase in the number of}} rooted plantlets. Removal or retention of flowers did not affect rooted plantlet formation. There was no difference in the total herbage accumulated between <b>Astred</b> and Pawera in the first growing season, under 4, 6 and 8 week grazing frequencies, and lax and hard grazing intensities, but <b>Astred</b> produced more (P< 0. 001) herbage at the first spring grazing. <b>Astred</b> swards had significantly higher percentages of parent plants than Pawera in all treatments after two seasons grazing. Grazing intensity and frequency affected the number of rooted plantlets produced which ranged from 29 to 66 per m 2. The recommended grazing management for pure swards of <b>Astred</b> red clover is to graze every 4 to 6 weeks, or when pre grazing height reaches 30 cm, whichever is later, with a minimum post grazing residual of 10 cm over the whole grazing season for effective plantlet production. Pawera and <b>Astred</b> had contrasting total percentages of leaf and stem from 20 / 9 / 96 to 6 / 1 / 97 (P< 0. 001) with Pawera having thicker stems compared with <b>Astred</b> in all corresponding grazing treatments (P< 0. 001). The total percentage of regrowth for <b>Astred</b> or Pawera was not significantly different. The persistence of tagged parent plants of <b>Astred</b> and Pawera in the 6 weeks hard grazed treatment was similar until after 2. 5 years of age when (P< 0. 001) more <b>Astred</b> parent plants survived. Grazing intensity and frequency affected the number of all plantlets (plantlets with no roots, aerially rooted or rooted) produced, which ranged from 0 to 11 per m 2 for rooted plantlets after each grazing. In mixed swards on three farm trials at Hastings, Dannevirke and Palmerston North, <b>Astred</b> parent plant persistence decreased with increasing grazing pressure, but significantly more parent plants survived than for Pawera. The vegetatively reproductive red clover selections performed at productive levels that could make a significant contribution to New Zealand agriculture as truly perennial, taprooted forage legumes capable of increasing or maintaining their parent plant population over time under grazing...|$|R

25|$|A unique <b>Astre</b> {{package was}} offered in 1975. Dubbed the 'Lil Wide Track, {{it was the}} {{creation}} of Jerry Juska of Dymar to help with lackluster <b>Astre</b> sales. Juska took his ideas to Dave Landrith of Motortown Corporation specializing in custom auto work. The package includes a front air dam, rear spoiler, appliance wire mag rims, window louvers, a chrome exhaust tip, and bright stripe decals for the hood, body sides, rear spoiler, door handles, and wheel centers. They assembled a couple of cars in Jan. and Feb. 1975 and took pictures to local Detroit dealers where the package gained acceptance. It added a little over $400 to the price of the <b>Astre</b> but dealers felt the difference in looks was worth the price. Production was later switched from an old warehouse in suburban Detroit to a factory beside the Lordstown Assembly Vega/Astre plant. An estimated 3,000 Lil Wide Track Astres were ordered by dealerships. The package components were later offered as a dealer installed kit.|$|E
