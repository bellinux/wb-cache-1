The aim of this research was to study the difference of forced vital capacity (FVC) on workers between foundry and fitting-shop in “ED” <b>aluminium</b> <b>cast</b> industry, Giwangan Yogyakarta. Method: This was an observational research using cross sectional design. The population was 15 workers on each location. The data was collected using questionnaire, measuring of lung function and total dust content. The data would be analyzed using Mann-Whitney test. Result: The result showed that the average of total dust content on those location was 0. 65 mg/m 3 and 2. 75 mg/m 3 orderly. This was still below the threshold value (10 mg/m 3). The measuring of lung function showed that 73. 35 % of workers in foundry  and 66. 6 % of workers in fitting-shop had  FVC decreasing with the average of FVC was 75. 80 % and 77. 27 % in order.
