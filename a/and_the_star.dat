5|$|As the {{hydrogen}} shell burning produces more helium, the core increases in mass and temperature. In a red giant {{of up to}} 2.25 , {{the mass of the}} helium core becomes degenerate prior to helium fusion. Finally, when the temperature increases sufficiently, helium fusion begins explosively in what is called a helium flash, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>star</b> rapidly shrinks in radius, increases its surface temperature, and moves to the horizontal branch of the HR diagram. For more massive stars, helium core fusion starts before the core becomes degenerate, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>star</b> spends some time in the red clump, slowly burning helium, before the outer convective envelope collapses <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>star</b> then moves to the horizontal branch.|$|E

5|$|As a red dwarf, Gliese 876 is {{much less}} massive than the Sun: {{estimates}} suggest it has only 32% {{of the mass of}} the Sun. The surface temperature of Gliese 876 is cooler than the Sun <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>star</b> has a smaller radius. These factors combine to make the star only 1.24% as luminous as the Sun, and most of this is at infrared wavelengths.|$|E

5|$|Spectroscopic studies first {{revealed}} {{the presence of}} a planet around HD 209458 on November 5, 1999. Astronomers had made careful photometric measurements of several stars known to be orbited by planets, in the hope that they might observe a dip in brightness caused by the transit of the planet across the star's face. This would require the planet's orbit to be inclined such that it would pass between the Earth <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>star,</b> and previously no transits had been detected.|$|E
5|$|The {{apparent}} {{brightness of}} a star is {{expressed in terms of}} its apparent magnitude. It {{is a function of the}} star's luminosity, its distance from Earth, and the altering of the star's light as it passes through Earth's atmosphere.

5|$|The exact mass-luminosity {{relationship}} {{depends on}} how efficiently energy can be transported from the core to the surface. A higher opacity has an insulating effect that retains more energy at the core, so the star {{does not need to}} produce as much energy to remain in hydrostatic equilibrium. By contrast, a lower opacity means energy escapes more rapidly <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>star</b> must burn more fuel to remain in equilibrium. Note, however, that a sufficiently high opacity can result in energy transport via convection, which changes the conditions needed to remain in equilibrium.|$|E
5|$|Very {{massive stars}} can undergo core {{collapse}} when nuclear fusion becomes unable {{to sustain the}} core against its own gravity; passing this threshold {{is the cause of}} all types of supernova except Type Ia. The collapse may cause violent expulsion of the outer layers of the star resulting in a supernova, or the release of gravitational potential energy may be insufficient <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>star</b> may collapse into a black hole or neutron star with little radiated energy.|$|E
5|$|When {{the title}} was created, a {{suggested}} medal was drafted and designed by the government.

The suspension was made from gold-plated silver, while the suspension of the current medal is made from gold, as the medal. The design of the star evokes the Marshal's Star, which Soviet Marshals wore around their necks. This medal was adopted by Presidential Decree Number 26 on May 15, 1996.|$|E

5|$|Around 5.4billion {{years from}} now, {{the core of}} the Sun will become hot enough to trigger {{hydrogen}} fusion in its surrounding shell. This will cause the outer layers of the star to expand greatly, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>star</b> will enter a phase of its life in which it is called a red giant. Within 7.5billion years, the Sun will have expanded to a radius of 1.2AU—256 times its current size. At the tip of the red giant branch, {{as a result of the}} vastly increased surface area, the Sun's surface will be much cooler (about 2600K) than now and its luminosity much higher—up to 2,700current solar luminosities. For part of its red giant life, the Sun will have a strong stellar wind that will carry away around 33% of its mass. During these times, it is possible that Saturn's moon Titan could achieve surface temperatures necessary to support life.|$|E
5|$|As the {{hydrogen}} fuel {{at the core}} of the progenitor of IK Pegasi B was consumed, it evolved into a red giant. The inner core contracted until hydrogen burning commenced in a shell surrounding the helium core. To compensate for the temperature increase, the outer envelope expanded to many times the radius it possessed as a main sequence star. When the core reached a temperature and density where helium could start to undergo fusion this star contracted and became what is termed a horizontal branch star. That is, it belonged to a group of stars that fall upon a roughly horizontal line on the H-R diagram. The fusion of helium formed an inert core of carbon and oxygen. When helium was exhausted in the core a helium-burning shell formed in addition to {{the hydrogen}}-burning one <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>star</b> moved to what astronomers term the asymptotic giant branch, or AGB. (This is a track leading to the upper-right corner of the H-R diagram.) If the star had sufficient mass, in time carbon fusion could begin in the core, producing oxygen, neon and magnesium.|$|E
5|$|Gliese 876 b {{currently}} {{lies beyond}} {{the outer edge}} of the habitable zone but because Gliese 876 is a slowly evolving main-sequence red dwarf its habitable zone is very slowly moving outwards and will continue to do so for trillions of years. Therefore, Gliese 876 b will, in trillions of years time, lie inside Gliese 876's habitable zone, as defined by the ability of an Earth-mass planet to retain liquid water at its surface, and remain there for at least 4.6 billion years. While the prospects for life on a gas giant are unknown, large moons may be able to support a habitable environment. Models of tidal interactions between a hypothetical moon, the planet <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>star</b> suggest that large moons should be able to survive in orbit around Gliese 876 b for the lifetime of the system. On the other hand, it is unclear whether such moons could form in the first place. However, the large mass of the gas giant may make it more likely for larger moons to form.|$|E

5|$|Orion is {{mentioned}} in the oldest surviving works of Greek literature, which probably {{date back to the}} 7th or 8th century BC, but which are the products of an oral tradition with origins several centuries earlier. In Homer's Iliad Orion is described as a constellation, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>star</b> Sirius {{is mentioned}} as his dog. In the Odyssey, Odysseus sees him hunting in the underworld with a bronze club, a great slayer of animals; he is also mentioned as a constellation, as the lover of the Goddess Dawn, as slain by Artemis, and as the most handsome of the earthborn. In the Works and Days of Hesiod, Orion is also a constellation, one whose rising and setting with the sun is used to reckon the year.|$|E
5|$|Stars {{far more}} massive than the sun evolve in more complex ways. In {{the core of}} the star, {{hydrogen}} is fused into helium, releasing thermal energy that heats the sun's core and provides outward pressure that supports the sun's layers against collapse in a process known as stellar or hydrostatic equilibrium. The helium produced in the core accumulates there since temperatures in the core are not yet high enough to cause it to fuse. Eventually, as the hydrogen at the core is exhausted, fusion starts to slow down, and gravity causes the core to contract. This contraction raises the temperature high enough to initiate a shorter phase of helium fusion, which accounts for less than 10% of the star's total lifetime. In stars with fewer than eight solar masses, the carbon produced by helium fusion does not fuse, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>star</b> gradually cools to become a white dwarf. White dwarf stars, if they have a near companion, may then become Type Ia supernovae.|$|E
