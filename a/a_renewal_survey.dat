40|$|We {{investigate}} whether organisational renewal impacts upon {{the performance of}} family firms, and identify aspects of “familiness” acting as facilitators or inhibitors of organisational <b>renewal.</b> <b>A</b> <b>survey</b> instrument captured data on relevant family-related characteristics, organisational renewal, and firm performance from CEOs of 140 family firms in Greece. Regression {{analysis was used to}} test hypotheses. We found strong evidence that organisational renewal impacts positively upon profit growth of family firms. Where CEOs had a strong growth aspiration for the future, were firm founders, and where succession planning was taking place, renewal was more likely to be enacted. Efforts are focused on creating a business which will thrive in the future, and not curating an organisational heirloom shaped and constrained by the past. Their strong future focus liberates these family firms from possible cross-generational path dependency, allowing the special resources of their family's business to act instead as a springboard for on-going organisational renewal. Conversely, those family firms {{with a high level of}} family altruism indicated by extensive kin-employment seemed to be more probably destined for stagnation than stewardship, as they promote (past-focused) historical family sentiment and tradition. The dangers of cross-generational path dependency indeed seem pronounced in such past-focused firms...|$|R
