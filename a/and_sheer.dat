5|$|The killer whale's intelligence, trainability, {{striking}} appearance, playfulness {{in captivity}} <b>and</b> <b>sheer</b> size {{have made it}} a popular exhibit at aquaria and aquatic theme parks. From 1976 to 1997, 55 whales {{were taken from the}} wild in Iceland, 19 from Japan, and three from Argentina. These figures exclude animals that died during capture. Live captures fell dramatically in the 1990s, and by 1999, about 40% of the 48 animals on display in the world were captive-born.|$|E

The video was shot during Madonna's photo shoot with Elle magazine, for its May cover girl issue. Madonna's retro-chic {{look in the}} video {{was inspired by the}} photoshoot. The video featured a guest appearance from rapper Pharrell Williams; he was portrayed alongside Madonna, singing to the camera in front of various backdrops. Madonna wore thigh-high PVC boots, visible underwear <b>and</b> <b>sheer</b> tops in the video. The dresses were designed by several fashion brands, including Chanel and Roberto Cavalli.|$|E
5|$|On 1 November 1537, Cáceres {{arrived at}} the Peñol de Cerquín. He {{immediately}} sent envoys to Lempira, requesting his submission; Lempira executed the envoys and declared his defiance. In response, Cáceres launched a direct assault against the fortress but found it impregnable. No roads climbed the mountain, <b>and</b> <b>sheer</b> wall prevented attempts to climb it. Well-engineered defences manned by large numbers of gathered warriors prevented the Spanish from storming the approaches, and horses were useless on the steep terrain. Cáceres had no choice except to lay close siege to the Peñol. He divided his men equally amongst the eight approaches to the fortress, and fierce fighting ensued, in which five Spaniards were killed and many were injured, including Cáceres. The siege held firm, {{but was unable to}} gain any ground.|$|E

5|$|The {{southern}} {{section of}} the forest in the Wind River Range is the primary destination for mountain climbers. Nine of the highest 10 peaks in Wyoming are here, and the mountains are primarily of granitic rock with countless cliffs <b>and</b> <b>sheer</b> rock walls. The Cirque of the Towers is particularly popular as it has numerous peaks within a relatively short distance of each other. Two particular climbs on the peaks in the cirque are considered amongst the finest climbing adventures available in the U.S. The Absaroka Range also attracts climbers but not of a technical nature since the rocks are not considered solid enough for good anchoring points. For the tallest peaks in the Wind River Range, the entire summiting effort will take even experienced climbers many days due to the inaccessibility {{of the region and}} complexity of the climbing effort.|$|E

25|$|It is {{suspected}} that the four species of introduced caddisflies Trichoptera are adversely impacting native aquatic invertebrate populations either through competition for space and resources, or because of its large body size <b>and</b> <b>sheer</b> abundance in Hawaiian streams.

25|$|Killer whales {{were first}} {{captured}} live and displayed in exhibitions in the 1960s, soon becoming popular attractions at public aquariums and aquatic theme parks {{due to their}} intelligence, trainability, striking appearance, playfulness in captivity <b>and</b> <b>sheer</b> size. As of September, 2016, there are 56 orcas in captivity worldwide, 33 of which are captive-born. The practice of keeping killer whales in captivity has become controversial.|$|E

25|$|Establishing precise {{figures on}} Paganism is difficult. Due to the secrecy {{and fear of}} {{persecution}} still prevalent among Pagans, limited numbers are willing to openly be counted.

25|$|Besides {{experimental}} research, {{the comparative}} method {{can also be}} employed to investigate hypotheses such as those given by Curio above. For example, closely related species such as the kittiwake do not show mobbing behavior. The kittiwake's cliff nests are almost completely inaccessible to possible predators due to gusty winds <b>and</b> <b>sheer</b> cliffs, meaning its young are not at risk to predation like the black-headed gull.

25|$|Velasquez {{possesses}} a four-octave vocal range.

She has exhibited her belting <b>and</b> <b>sheer</b> lung power while singing onstage sitting in lotus position, while lying on bed and even while being suspended up on a harness in mid-air. Velasquez credits this from her father's vocal training technique where she is submerged neck-deep in the sea to strengthen her diaphragm and build up her vocal cords and lung power.|$|E
