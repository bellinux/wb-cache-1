5|$|After Gothika, Downey {{was cast}} {{in a number of}} leading and {{supporting}} roles, including well-received work in a number of semi-independent films: A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints, Good Night, and Good Luck, Richard Linklater's dystopian, rotoscoped <b>A</b> <b>Scanner</b> Darkly (in which Downey plays the role of a drug addict), and Steven Shainberg's fictional biographical film of Diane Arbus, Fur, where Downey's character represented the two biggest influences on Arbus' professional life, Lisette Model and Marvin Israel. Downey also received great notice for his roles in more mainstream fare such as Kiss Kiss Bang Bang and Disney's poorly received The Shaggy Dog.|$|E
5|$|Downey had {{a regular}} {{role in the}} {{television}} series Ally McBeal in 2000, which won him a Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actor. He was then cast in the 2003 films The Singing Detective alongside Robin Wright and Gothika with Halle Berry. In 2005, he starred in Kiss Kiss Bang Bang with Val Kilmer; in Good Night, and Good Luck with David Strathairn and George Clooney; and voiced the character of Patrick Pewterschmidt in the animated series Family Guy. The following year, he appeared in the animated science fiction film <b>A</b> <b>Scanner</b> Darkly and as Paul Avery in the 2007 film Zodiac.|$|E
5|$|The game's {{head-up display}} simulates {{the inside of}} Samus's helmet and {{features}} a radar, map, missile ammunition meter and health meter. Several visors are available, and each performs a different function. One, also seen in the previous game, is <b>a</b> <b>scanner</b> that searches for enemy weaknesses, interfaces with mechanisms such as force fields and elevators and retrieves text entries from certain sources. The others reveal and highlight interdimensional objects or cloaked enemies, and create a visual representation of sound.|$|E

5|$|The heads-up display, which simulates {{the inside}} of Samus' helmet, {{features}} a radar display, a map, ammunition for missiles, a health meter, a danger meter for negotiating hazardous landscape or materials, and a health bar and name display for bosses. The display can be altered by exchanging visors; one uses thermal imaging, another has x-ray vision, and another features <b>a</b> <b>scanner</b> that searches for enemy weaknesses and interfaces with mechanisms such as force fields and elevators. Metroid Prime introduces a hint system that provides the player with clues about ways to progress through the game.|$|E
5|$|The main {{character}} comes {{equipped with a}} staff after {{the initial stages of}} the game, which functions as both a weapon, and a tool for exploration and puzzle-solving. Combat is mainly melee-orientated, with players locking-on to an enemy upon moving in close. Once in combat, an enemy's health is displayed as a heart icon above them, with players able to strafe and roll around a target to dodge attack, while using the staff to either block incoming strikes, or attack an enemy. As a tool, the staff can be used to open containers, operate mechanisms, or lift up stones to uncover hidden caves and boulders to find items. As the player progress in the story, the staff can be upgraded with powers that can help in combat or assist in solving puzzles and exploring locations, including the ability to fire projectiles at enemies or trigger switches, and a special jump ability to reach places that are inaccessible through normal methods. However, using such powers requires magical energy, which the player can recover by retrieving special crystals from the environment. Along with the staff, the player can also has a sidekick that joins them after a certain stage of the story, who can help by finding them items and using certain abilities to open up new areas. Such abilities, referred to as tricks, require the player to feed them with special mushrooms, with each one constituting one trick that can be performed, with the sidekick able to perform a maximum of six tricks when fully fed before needing more mushrooms. The game's inventory system focuses on three areas - items, staff powers, and tricks - with the player able to use three scanner systems in the game - a mini-map of a region (provided a map has been purchased first), <b>a</b> <b>scanner</b> to give information on objects in that are approached, and a fuel cell radar.|$|E

25|$|Dick was recreated by {{his fans}} {{in the form of}} a simulacrum or {{remote-controlled}} android designed in his likeness. Such simulacra had been themes of many of Dick's works.

In February 2006, an America West Airlines employee misplaced the android's head, and it has not yet been found. In January 2011, it was announced that Hanson Robotics had built a replacement.|$|E
25|$|<b>A</b> <b>Scanner</b> Darkly (1977) is a bleak {{mixture of}} science fiction and police {{procedural}} novels; in its story, an undercover narcotics police detective begins to lose touch with reality after falling victim to the same permanently mind-altering drug, Substance D, he was enlisted to help fight. Substance D is instantly addictive, beginning with a pleasant euphoria which is quickly replaced with increasing confusion, hallucinations and eventually total psychosis. In this novel, as with all Dick novels, there is an underlying thread of paranoia and dissociation with multiple realities perceived simultaneously. It was adapted to film by Richard Linklater.|$|E
25|$|<b>A</b> <b>Scanner</b> Darkly is a 2006 American {{animated}} science-fiction thriller film {{directed by}} Richard Linklater, {{based on the}} novel of the same name by Philip K. Dick. The film tells the story of identity and deception in a near-future dystopia constantly under intrusive high-tech police surveillance {{in the midst of a}} drug addiction epidemic. The film was shot digitally and then animated using interpolated rotoscope, an animation technique in which animators trace over the original footage frame by frame, for use in live-action and animated films, giving the finished result a distinctive animated look. It was distributed by Warner Independent Pictures.|$|E

30|$|Three-dimensional {{scanners}} can {{be classified}} into two categories according to the light source they emit. One is <b>a</b> laser <b>scanner,</b> {{and the other is}} <b>a</b> raster <b>scanner.</b> The idea of <b>a</b> laser <b>scanner</b> started upon learning about the characteristics of lasers. Because of its low divergence, it can basically bring back the coordinates of the scanned objects in three-dimensional space. Compared with the raster scanner, it has faster transmission speed and more precise resolution, and it can continue to break points. But the laser also has a nondiffusion property, and a certain amount will bring about the qualitative radiation effects.|$|R
