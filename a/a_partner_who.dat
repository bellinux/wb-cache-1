Consider, for example, a woman who decides that her negative self-views have led her to tolerate abusive relationship partners. When she realizes that such partners are making her miserable, she may seek therapy. In {{the hands of a}} skilled therapist, she may develop more favorable self-views which, in turn, steer her toward more positive relationship partners with whom she may cultivate healthier relationships. Alternatively, when a woman who is uncertain about her negative self-concept enters a relationship with <b>a</b> <b>partner</b> <b>who</b> is certain that she deserves to view herself more positively, that woman will tend to improve the self-concept.|$|E

25|$|In {{the human}} case, {{according}} to FCC, evolving females with increasingly heavy childcare burdens {{would have done}} best by resisting attempts at harem-holding by locally dominant males. No human female needs <b>a</b> <b>partner</b> <b>who</b> will get her pregnant only to disappear, abandoning her in favour of his next sexual partner. To any local group of females, the more such philandering can be successfully resisted—and the greater the proportion of previously excluded males who can {{be included in the}} breeding system and persuaded to invest effort—the better. By evolving concealed ovulation and continuous receptivity, females force males into longer periods of consortship if they are to {{have a good chance of}} achieving impregnation (figures c,d). Reproductive synchrony —whether seasonal, lunar or a combination of the two—is a key strategy for reproductive levelling, reducing paternity skew and involving more males in investment in offspring. Greater reproductive synchrony owing to seasonality during glacial cycles may have differentiated Neanderthal reproductive strategies from those of Homo sapiens ancestors.|$|E
500|$|Lyrically {{the track}} is written about a failing {{relationship}} caused by <b>a</b> <b>partner</b> <b>who</b> abuses alcohol. The singer {{speaks of a}} man who faces a disconnect between his personality while drunk and sober, causing the inability to forge a connection. During the second verse Gomez sings [...] "Why is it so different when we wake up? / Same lips, same kiss, but not the same touch / Don't you know that you do it just enough, but not enough / But I know what's next, and I want so much", describing a lover who can only show his true emotions while intoxicated. Later in the song she expresses the pain she feels having wasted so much time into her relationship, and decides to leave her dysfunctional lover: [...] "You've got a hold on me / You're like a wasted dream / I gave you everything / But you don't know how to love me when you're sober".|$|E
500|$|Following the {{commercial}} {{success of their}} debut studio album Fallen (2003) and its accompanying tour (2003–04), Evanescence returned to the studio to work on material for a new album. During that time, guitarist Ben Moody parted ways with the band and the group sued their previous record manager. In addition to that, the replacement guitarist for Moody, Terry Balsamo suffered from a stroke during {{the final stages of}} recording, which further extended the time needed to release and finalize the album. The Open Door was eventually finished and set for release in October 2006. For the songwriting process on the album, Amy Lee mostly collaborated with Balsamo whom she described as <b>a</b> <b>partner</b> <b>who</b> lifted her up and helped her pass the point of refraining when composing. [...] "Lithium" [...] {{was one of the first}} songs written for the album, solely by Lee. During an interview with VH1, she revealed that she had written the song on a guitar when she was 16-years old, but never used it in any of her projects despite her liking of its chorus. During the band's work on The Open Door, Lee rearranged the song on a piano and wrote its verses. [...] Lee describes the song as one [...] "which embraces feeling over numbness".

500|$|The episode {{received}} many positive reviews. John Preston, writing for The Daily Telegraph, called the episode an [...] "undiluted triumph". Opening his review, he said [...] "last night's episode {{struck me as}} being as close to 50minutes of pure pleasure as you're likely to get on television". He noted the episode's clever tackling of the topical theme of obesity, and its mixture of emotion and special effects. In closing, he said [...] "the dejected critic, denied even the smallest nit to pick, walks glumly away". Scott Matthewman of The Stage lamented that the Adipose were not threatening enough. He liked the Adipose's execution of Miss Foster, a [...] "momentary pause in mid-air, gravity only kicking in when the character looks down", comparing it to Wile E. Coyote and Chuck Jones, which [...] " [...] a nice little touch in an episode... full of them". He also appreciated Tate, saying that [...] "David Tennant finally has <b>a</b> <b>partner</b> <b>who</b> is approaching an equal". [...] Sam Wollaston of The Guardian wrote that Tate was [...] "not right for this role" [...] and [...] "too hysterical, too comedy, not cool enough", and felt her inclusion {{was an attempt to}} trade on the popularity of her own series and [...] "broaden the appeal of [...] still further". He also found the music [...] "a bit oppressive" [...] but concluded that, despite these criticisms, the show was [...] "still awfully nice television". Keith Watson of Metro gave the episode 4 stars out of 5. He admitted that despite his dislike of Tate, [...] "she isn't that bad". His review of the Adipose was positive, citing them as a reason {{of the quality of the}} show. Closing, he said [...] "it split [...] sides".|$|E

2500|$|By 1922 {{there were}} at least 7 million {{homeless}} children in Russia as a result of nearly a decade of devastation from World War I and the Russian Civil War.

By the 1930s the USSR declared the abolition of homelessness and any citizen was obliged to have a propiska– a place of permanent residency. Nobody could be stripped of propiska without substitution or refuse it without a confirmed permission (called [...] "order") to register in another place.

2500|$|A {{separate}} {{argument for}} starting antiretroviral therapy that has gained more prominence is {{its effect on}} HIV transmission. ART reduces the amount of virus in the blood and genital secretions. This {{has been shown to}} lead to dramatically reduced transmission of HIV when one partner with a suppressed viral load (<50 copies/ml) has sex with <b>a</b> <b>partner</b> <b>who</b> is HIV negative. In clinical trial HPTN 052, 1763 serodiscordant heterosexual couples in 9 countries were planned to be followed for at least 10 years, with both groups receiving education on preventing HIV transmission and condoms, but only one group getting ART. The study was stopped early for ethical reasons {{when it became clear that}} antiviral treatment provided significant protection. Of the 28 couples where cross-infection had occurred, all but one had taken place in the control group consistent with a 96% reduction in risk of transmission while on ART. The single transmission in the control group occurred early after starting ART before viral load was likely to be suppressed.|$|E
2500|$|Porter {{maintained}} a luxury apartment in Paris, where he entertained lavishly. His parties were extravagant and scandalous, with [...] "much gay and bisexual activity, Italian nobility, cross-dressing, international musicians {{and a large}} surplus of recreational drugs". In 1918, he met Linda Lee Thomas, a rich, Louisville, Kentucky-born divorcée eight years his senior. She was beautiful and well-connected socially; the couple shared mutual interests, including a love of travel, and she became Porter's confidant and companion. The couple married the following year. She was in no doubt about Porter's homosexuality, but it was mutually advantageous for them to marry. For Linda, it offered continued social status and <b>a</b> <b>partner</b> <b>who</b> was the antithesis of her abusive first husband. For Porter, it brought a respectable heterosexual front {{in an era when}} homosexuality was not publicly acknowledged. They were, moreover, genuinely devoted to each other and remained married from December 19, 1919, until her death in 1954. Linda remained protective of her social position, and believing that classical music might be a more prestigious outlet than Broadway for her husband's talents, she tried to use her connections to find him suitable teachers, including Igor Stravinsky, but was unsuccessful. Finally, Porter enrolled at the Schola Cantorum in Paris where he studied orchestration and counterpoint with Vincent d'Indy. Meanwhile, Porter's first big hit was the song [...] "Old-Fashioned Garden" [...] from the revue Hitchy-Koo in 1919. In 1920, he contributed the music of several songs to the musical A Night Out.|$|E
2500|$|The Warren Cup is a {{piece of}} convivial silver, usually dated to the time of the Julio-Claudian dynasty (1st century AD), that depicts two scenes of male-male sex. It has been argued that the two sides of this cup {{represent}} the duality of pederastic tradition at Rome, the Greek in contrast to the Roman. On the [...] "Greek" [...] side, a bearded, mature man is mounted by a young but muscularly developed male in a rear-entry position. The young man, probably meant to be 17 or 18, holds on to a sexual apparatus for maintaining an otherwise awkward or uncomfortable sexual position. A child-slave watches the scene furtively through a door ajar. The [...] "Roman" [...] side of the cup shows a puer delicatus, age 12 to 13, held for intercourse in the arms of an older male, clean-shaven and fit. The bearded pederast may be Greek, with <b>a</b> <b>partner</b> <b>who</b> participates more freely and with a look of pleasure. His counterpart, who has a more severe haircut, appears to be Roman, and thus uses a slave boy; the myrtle wreath he wears symbolizes his role as an [...] "erotic conqueror". The cup may have been designed as a conversation piece to provoke the kind of dialogue on ideals of love and sex that took place at a Greek symposium. The antiquity of the Warren Cup has been challenged, and it may instead represent perceptions of Greco-Roman homosexuality {{at the time of its}} manufacture, possibly the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries.|$|E
