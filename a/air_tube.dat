6000|$|You are not {{to forget}} {{the nature of this}} man's act; it is not {{permitted}} to you {{to think of it as}} an instance of bravado, nor, on the other hand, a needless sacrifice of self. If the enemy has not retreated he is in force on that ridge. The investigator will encounter nothing less than a line-of-battle; there is no need of pickets, videttes, skirmishers, to give warning of our approach; our attacking lines will be visible, conspicuous, exposed to an artillery fire that will shave the ground the moment they break from cover, and for half the distance to a sheet of rifle bullets in which nothing can live. In short, if the enemy is there, it would be madness to attack him in front; he must be manoeuvred out by the immemorial plan of threatening his line of communication, as necessary to his existence as to the diver at the bottom of the sea his <b>air</b> <b>tube.</b> But how ascertain if the enemy is there? There is but one way,--somebody must go and see. The natural and customary thing to do is to send forward a line of skirmishers. But in this case they will answer in the affirmative with all their lives; the enemy, crouching in double ranks behind the stone wall and in cover of the hedge, will wait until it is possible to count each assailant's teeth. At the first volley a half of the questioning line will fall, the other half before it can accomplish the predestined retreat. What a price to pay for gratified curiosity! At what a dear rate an army must sometimes purchase knowledge! [...] "Let me pay all," [...] says this gallant man--this military Christ! ...|$|E
50|$|The cycling {{historian}} Raymond Henry says repairs before Rustin’s invention {{were made}} by cutting a patch from a discarded <b>air</b> <b>tube,</b> scraping it with a file, then cleaning it with petrol. The repair patch and punctured tube were then coated with rubber solution and each heated above a flame until the rubber had reached the correct temperature and softeness.

40|$|The {{iridescent}} {{colors of}} the blue-banded bee (Aphrodita sp.) come from the bands of scales on their backs. Observed in optical microscope, the scales are typically 100 μm x 20 μm, with bright greenish and dark bands arranged alternately over the whole scale. Electron microscope images of the cross-section along the axis of scale show that arrays of <b>air</b> <b>tubes</b> are embedded orderly in the chitin matrix composing each scale. The submicron <b>air</b> <b>tubes,</b> mostly aligned along one direction, are well organized in particular periodic structure, which can be modeled as two-dimensional photonic crystal. Viewing from the plane of periodicity, the <b>air</b> <b>tubes</b> are many hexagonal cells oriented in a certain direction. There are mainly two kinds of hexagonal arrangement found: Orientation 1 and 2, corresponding to ΓM and ΓK directions along normal incident wave vector. Spectroscopic measurement with spatial resolution of several micrometers is used to demonstrate the UV and visible wavelength range spectra of two independent modes of polarized light, TE and TM modes. The obtained experimental spectra are then compared with theoretical calculation based on two orientations of <b>air</b> <b>tubes</b> model, to show correspondence between two color regions and two orientations. Irregularities occurred in periodic structure are also found to affect the spectra and optical images of the bee scale. Experiments are designed to study and evaluate the contribution of photonic band gap effect and guided resonance effect to structural colors...|$|R
50|$|Inside most {{tubes are}} springs, fork oil, and air, {{creating}} a shock absorber. Some forks allow pressurized air {{to be added}} through a valve {{in the top of}} the fork to stiffen the suspension. Quality forks have a flexible <b>air</b> <b>tube</b> between both fork tubes in order to balance the air pressure in both forks. Modern fork tubes have a method which employs a screw to compress fork spring to increase or decrease spring pre-load.|$|E

50|$|Pulling {{the alarm}} chain on a British train will pull a lever {{connected}} to the brake pipe flaps. Pulling the alarm activates a piston, causing the flaps to be opened and all the air pushed out the <b>air</b> <b>tube,</b> forcing the brakes on. In the driver's cab, a buzzer and a light will tell that the alarm has been activated. In the guard's van, this is seen from a valve which shows loss of pressure in the brake pipe. In the UK, there is a fine of £80 for pulling the alarm chain without good reason.|$|E

5000|$|Kabal was nicknamed [...] "Sandman" [...] during {{production}} of Mortal Kombat 3 before his actual name was determined. According to Mortal Kombat co-creator John Tobias, Kabal's overall design {{was inspired by}} the Tusken Raiders from Star Wars, while the circular lenses of his mask were inspired by 1940s-style aviator goggles. Series co-creator and programmer Ed Boon described such character concepts like Kabal as being [...] "very off the cuff." [...] The developers had also been interested at the possibility of introducing a character with a disability into the series. Both of Kabal's Fatalities poked fun at his handicap with him exposing his scarred face and literally scaring his opponents to death, in addition to inflating his opponents' head like a balloon with an <b>air</b> <b>tube</b> from his respirator, causing them to float upward before exploding offscreen.|$|E
50|$|The {{primary air}} input to a ball tube mill {{performs}} a dual function. It {{is used for}} drying and as the fuel transport medium, and by regulating it the mill output is regulated. Governed by the pulverized fuel outlet temperature requirement, the cold air and hot air dampers are regulated to achieve the correct primary air temperature. In addition to raising the coal temperature inside the mill for drying and better grinding, the same air works as the transport medium to move the pulverized coal out of the mill: it travels through the annular space between the fixed trunnion tubes and the rotating hot <b>air</b> <b>tube</b> onwards to the classifier. Coal-laden air passes through double cone static classifiers, with adjustable classifier vanes, for segregation into pulverized fuel of the desired fineness, and coarse particles. The pulverised fuel continues its journey towards the coal burners for combustion. The coarse particles rejected in the classifier are returned to the mill for another cycle of grinding.|$|E
50|$|In 1994, NASCAR {{introduced}} roof flaps to the car, {{which is}} designed to keep cars from getting airborne and possibly flipping down the track. Following Rusty Wallace's crashes at Daytona and Talladega, Penske Racing designed the original roof flaps. NASCAR team owner Jack Roush helped improve on the design of the roof flaps, in conjunction with Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, Daytona, Florida, USA. During spins, as a result of accidents or loss of handling, as the car rotates it eventually reaches an angle where the oncoming air reacts with the profile of the vehicle {{in the same manner as}} a wing. If the speed is high enough air flowing over the car's overall airfoil shape will create sufficient lift to force the car to become airborne. To prevent this, NASCAR developed a set of flaps that are recessed into pockets on the roof of the car. As a car is turned around and reaches an angle where significant lift occurs, the low pressure above the flaps causes them to deploy. The first flap oriented 140 degrees from the centerline of the car typically deploys first. After flap deployment, higher pressure air is forced through an <b>air</b> <b>tube</b> which connects to a second flap, deploying it. This second flap ensures that, should the car continue to spin, no further lift will be created as the vehicle's angle changes. The deployment of these flaps eliminates most of the lift on the vehicle. The roof flaps generally keep the cars on the ground as they spin, alt.|$|E

50|$|Kyle first {{appears in}} Child's Play 2. She is first seen smoking a {{cigarette}} in her bedroom when Andy Barclay is looking around his new house. Her foster mother, Joanne Simpson, enters her room telling her to put it out, to put her luggage away, and also tells her {{that she needs to}} have dinner with the family instead of going to work. Kyle tells her that she will be on her own next year and that she needs the money. In the morning, one of Joanne's antiques is found shattered, and both her and Andy are sent to do the laundry. Kyle is told that she is grounded and cannot go out on a date that night. Kyle sneaks out that night and when she returns home by climbing through Andy's bedroom window, she finds him tied to the bed with a doll next to him. When she goes to untie him, Joanne and Phil enter the room and believe that she {{is in the process of}} tying him up. Phil is later murdered by Chucky, and Andy is sent back to the orphanage. Kyle throws the Chucky in the garbage and goes outside on the swing set to smoke. While swinging, she feels something under the dirt and digs it up. She discovers a damaged Good Guy doll, named Tommy. She then goes to look in the garbage can and realizes that Chucky is gone. Now knowing that Chucky is alive, she goes to warn Joanne but finds her corpse tied to a chair. Chucky then attacks Kyle and forces her to drive him to the orphanage. At the orphanage, Chucky escapes with Andy. Kyle follows them to the Play Pals factory. She subdues Chucky, and flees with Andy. After successfully evading Chucky, Andy and Kyle come face to face with him and force an <b>air</b> <b>tube</b> into his mouth, causing him to explode. The two then leave the factory.|$|E
5000|$|Some were {{naturally}} formed. Some Mahayana buddhist monks left {{instructions to}} be followed after their deaths, which often included having them buried sitting in a lotus posture, put into a vessel with drying agents (such as coal, wood, paper, or lime) and surrounded by bricks, to be exhumed later, usually after three years. The preserved bodies would then be decorated with paint and adorned with gold. It is a common method in China. Some covered the bodies with clay or salt.According to Victor H. Mair in the Discovery Channel series The Mystery of the Tibetan Mummy, the self-mummification of a Tibetan monk, who died ca. 1475 and whose body was retrieved relatively incorrupt in the 1990s, was achieved by the sophisticated practices of meditation, coupled with prolonged starvation and slow self-suffocation using a special belt that connected the neck with his knees in a lotus position.The mummies of monks (Sokushinbutsu) in Japan practised nyūjō (入定), which caused their own death by adhering to a wood eating diet made up of salt, nuts, seeds, roots, pine bark, and urushi tea. They were then buried alive in a pine-wood box full of salt connected by a tube for air and would ring a bell signaling they were alive. When the bell stopped ringing the <b>air</b> <b>tube</b> was removed. Japan banned unburying in 1879, and assisted suicide—including religious suicide—is now illegal.

According to the ventilation of heading face in deep mine, the distribution of velocity and the temperature of the air within tube were simulated by using ANSYS software, and the thermal insulation effect was discussed. The result indicates that double-skin <b>air</b> <b>tube</b> has good effect on thermal insulation, and the number of air intakes and the thickness of the air layer are two important factors to the thermal insulation effect. The thermal insulation effect drops by increasing the number of air intakes. When the air layer thickness is less than 20 mm, the outlet temperature decreases significantly.
