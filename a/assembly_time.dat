40|$|Abstract. The {{purpose of}} this paper is to assess the impact of timer-based burst {{assembly}} algorithms for TCP traffic. We present an analysis for short, medium and long <b>assembly</b> <b>times</b> and investigate segment and flow distribution over the assembled bursts. Further, we also analyze their impact on the congestion window evolution and on the effective throughput achieved. It has been found out that short <b>assembly</b> <b>times</b> are ideally suitable for sources with small congestion windows, allowing for a speed up, while large <b>assembly</b> <b>times</b> yield a lower throughput variation among the individual assembled flows. For long <b>assembly</b> <b>times,</b> the transfer of more segments from the same source is trading off the increase of the burstification delay but no throughput gain is obtained. However, large <b>assembly</b> <b>times</b> smooth out individual flow performance and provide a significant lower variation of throughput. To this end, in this paper, we propose a new adaptive burst assembly algorithm that dynamically assigns flows to different burstifiers based on their instant window size...|$|R
40|$|It {{has long}} been the goal of {{designers}} to identify a robust measure of product complexity to guide product decisions. Using Design for Assembly evaluations from over 225 assemblies and subassemblies, alternative measures of product complexity are identified and compared. Time is shown to be the most consistently predicted, useful, and fungible measure. The distribution of <b>assembly</b> <b>times</b> for a product can be modeled by Pareto`s law. This leads to a new, more effective product design guideline and a predictive tool that enables rapid and accurate prediction of <b>assembly</b> <b>times</b> for redesigned products without having to repeat DFMA analysis...|$|R

40|$|The global {{financial}} crisis, brewing for a while, {{really started to}} show its in automobiles Automotive manufacturing is complex and includes the coordination of design and manufacturing. In the manufacturing approaches {{over the past few}} years, assembly has been a key issue and it seems simulation models are usually tailored to address a narrow set of industrial issues. This paper describes the development of manufacturing system design, operation, and maintenance based on Simulation. The model is being developed at two different levels: the supply chain, the assembly plant. A solution that may optimize one performance measure may deteriorate other performance solution difficult. The resulting algorithms are comparable to the simulation in terms of success rate, <b>assembly</b> <b>times,</b> peak forces and moments, and have <b>assembly</b> <b>times</b> superior to those of a benchmark blind search algorithm. </p...|$|R

The experimental set up annotated an assembly line involving 36 subjects. The material presentation factor involved {{the use of a}} material rack compared to using an unstructured kit as well as a structured kit. The information presentation factor involved using a text and number instruction compared to a photograph instruction, and situations with and without component variation were considered. Results show that <b>assembly</b> <b>times</b> and workload ratings were lower when using a kit, whereas using a material rack resulted in perceived decreased workflow and increased stress and frustration. Moreover, <b>assembly</b> <b>times</b> and workload ratings were lower when using photographs, whereas using text and numbers increased mental workload. The results could be useful when planning work places and production systems in order to obtain a better workflow and an increased human performance. ...|$|R
2500|$|It is also {{possible}} to use solely the macro processing abilities of an assembler to generate code written in completely different languages, for example, to generate a version of a program in COBOL using a pure macro assembler program containing lines of COBOL code inside <b>assembly</b> <b>time</b> operators instructing the assembler to generate arbitrary code. IBM OS/360 uses macros to perform system generation. The user specifies options by coding a series of assembler macros.

2500|$|On December 16, 2003, Boeing {{announced}} that the 787 would be assembled in its factory in Everett, Washington. Instead of conventionally building the aircraft from the ground up, final assembly employed 800 to 1,200 people to join completed subassemblies and to integrate systems. Boeing assigned global subcontractors to do more assembly work, delivering completed subassemblies to Boeing for final assembly. This approach was intended {{to result in a}} leaner, simpler assembly line and lower inventory, with pre-installed systems reducing final <b>assembly</b> <b>time</b> by three-quarters to three days. Subcontractors had early difficulties procuring needed parts and finishing subassemblies on schedule, leaving remaining assembly work for Boeing to complete as [...] "traveled work". In 2010, Boeing considered in-house construction of the 787-9 tail; the tail of the 787-8 is made by Alenia. The 787 was unprofitable for some subcontractors; Alenia's parent company, Finmeccanicam had a total loss of €750 million on the project by 2013.|$|E

40|$|Nowadays, {{customers}} request more {{variation in}} a company’s product assortment {{leading to an}} increased amount of parts moving around on the shop floor. To cope with this tendency, a kitting process can be implemented. Kitting is the operation of collecting the necessary parts for a given end product in a specific container, called a kit, prior to arriving at an assembly unit. As kitting performance {{is critical to the}} overall cost and performance of the manufacturing system, this paper analyses a two-part kitting process as a Markovian model. In particular, kitting is studied as a paired queue, thereby accounting for stochastic part arrivals, and kit <b>assembly</b> <b>times.</b> Using sparse matrix techniques, we assess the impact of kitting interruptions, bursty part arrivals and phase-type distributed kit <b>assembly</b> <b>times</b> on the behaviour of the part buffers. Finally, a cost-profit analysis of kitting processes is conducted and an approximation for a two-part kitting process is established...|$|R
