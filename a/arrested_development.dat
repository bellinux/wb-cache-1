40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to investigate the effect of pre-tassel applications of foliar-applied pesticides and surfactants on ear development in hybrid corn. Increased reports of ear development abnormalities first surfaced during the 2007 growing season in the Midwest. The majority of these ear abnormalities were designated as either 2 ̆ 2 <b>arrested</b> ear <b>development</b> 2 ̆ 2 or 2 ̆ 2 hollow husk 2 ̆ 2, with <b>arrested</b> ear <b>development</b> being more commonly used. The reports of <b>arrested</b> ear <b>development</b> in 2007 coincided with an increase that year in the use of foliar fungicides applied around the V 14 growth stage of corn. Due to the association of <b>arrested</b> ear <b>development</b> with applications of foliar fungicides, the cause was initially suspected to be injury by the chemical mode of action of foliar fungicides. Research was established to investigate this phenomenon in 2009 with these specific objectives: 1) elucidate contributing factors to <b>arrested</b> ear <b>development,</b> 2) determine the optimum timing for pre-tassel nonionic surfactant applications to prevent <b>arrested</b> ear <b>development</b> and associated yield loss, and 3) determine the impact of nonionic surfactant chemistries on <b>arrested</b> ear <b>development.</b> Replicated field trials were established at the Purdue Agronomy Center for Research and Education, West Lafayette, IN, in 2009, 2010, and 2011, and results indicate that <b>arrested</b> ear <b>development</b> occurrence increases when nonionic surfactant products containing alkylphenol ethoxylate are applied from growth stages V 10 to V 14. Reductions in grain yield, kernels per ear, and ear length also result from <b>arrested</b> ear <b>development.</b> Nonionic surfactant applications after the VT growth stage appear to be safe relative to ear development in corn. ...|$|R

5|$|Pupae {{have the}} ability to enter facultative diapause, the state of <b>arrested</b> <b>development</b> and growth in {{response}} to a change in the environment. By preparing themselves for a major change in environmental conditions, they can increase reproductive success. Diapause increases with increasing latitude. In tropical conditions, populations breed continuously, and only 2-4% of pupae diapause. In subtropical and temperate regions, most individuals diapause. Individuals who don't enter diapause in these areas emerge in late fall and die without reproducing. Drought-responsive diapause has also been observed in the summer.|$|E

5|$|The plot of <b>Arrested</b> <b>Development</b> {{revolves}} around {{the members of the}} Bluth family, a formerly-wealthy family who continue to lead extravagant lifestyles despite their changed circumstances and who often find themselves drawn into interactions with incestuous undertones.

Michael is a widowed single father. His teenage son, George Michael (Michael Cera), has the same qualities of decency but feels a constant pressure to live up to his father's expectations and is often reluctant to follow his father's plans. He battles with a crush he has on cousin Maeby, which developed from a kiss she gave him as part of a prank.|$|E

40|$|Oxygen plays a {{key role}} in energy metabolism. However, there are organisms that survive severe {{shortfalls}} in oxygen. Drosophila embryos rapidly <b>arrest</b> <b>development</b> upon severe hypoxia and recover upon restoration of oxygen, even days later. Stabilization of the normally unstable engrailed RNA and protein preserved the localized striped pattern of this embryonic patterning gene during 3  days in hypoxia. Severe hypoxia blocked expression of a heat-shock-inducible lacZ transgene. Cyanide, a metabolic poison, did not immediately block gene expression or turnover, arguing against a passive response to energy limitation. In contrast, nitric oxide, a putative hypoxia signal, induced a reversible <b>arrest</b> of <b>development,</b> gene expression and turnover. Reciprocally, a nitric oxide scavenger allowed continued gene expression and turnover during hypoxia, but it reduced hypoxia tolerance. We suggest that hypoxia-induced stasis preserves the status quo of embryonic processes and promotes survival. Our data implicate nitric oxide as a mediator of this response and provide a system in which to investigate its action...|$|R
40|$|<b>Arrested</b> {{embryonic}} <b>development</b> {{involves the}} downregulation or cessation of active cell division and metabolic activity, and {{the capability of}} an animal to <b>arrest</b> embryonic <b>development</b> results in temporal plasticity of the duration of embryonic period. <b>Arrested</b> embryonic <b>development</b> is an important reproductive strategy for egg-laying animals that provide no parental care after oviposition. In this review, we discuss each type of embryonic developmental arrest used by oviparous reptiles. Environmental pressures that might have directed the evolution of arrest are addressed and we present previously undiscussed environmentally dependent physiological processes that may occur in the egg to bring about arrest. Areas for future research are proposed to clarify how ecology affects the phenotype of developing embryos. We hypothesize that oviparous reptilian mothers are capable of providing their embryos {{with a level of}} phenotypic adaptation to local environmental conditions by incorporating maternal factors into the internal environment of the egg that result in different levels of developmental sensitivity to environmental conditions after they are laid...|$|R
