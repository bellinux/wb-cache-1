5|$|The {{ecological}} complexities {{human beings}} are facing through the technological transformation of the planetary biome has brought on the Anthropocene. The unique set of circumstances has generated {{the need for a}} new unifying science called coupled human and natural systems that builds upon, but moves beyond the field of human ecology. Ecosystems tie into human societies through the critical and all encompassing life-supporting functions they sustain. In recognition of these functions and the incapability of traditional economic valuation methods to see the value in ecosystems, there has been a surge of interest in social-natural capital, which provides the means to put a value on the stock and use of information and materials stemming from ecosystem goods and services. Ecosystems produce, regulate, maintain, and supply services of critical necessity and beneficial to human health (cognitive and physiological), economies, and they even provide an information or reference function as a living library giving opportunities for science and cognitive development in children engaged in the complexity of the natural world. Ecosystems relate importantly to human ecology as they <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>ultimate</b> base foundation of global economics as every commodity, and the capacity for exchange ultimately stems from the ecosystems on Earth.|$|E

25|$|In 2004, Mohler {{hosted a}} {{symposium}} at Southern Seminary honoring Paul Pressler, the former judge from Houston, Texas, {{who was a}} prime leader in the Southern Baptist Convention Conservative resurgence that began in 1979, a movement which ultimately toppled the moderate faction from its control over the SBC. At the symposium held on the 25th anniversary of the Conservative resurgence, Pressler attributed rank-and-file church members for reversing the trend toward theological liberalism in the denomination. Mohler said that without the Conservative resurgence, the SBC would in time have become as liberal as the Episcopal or the Methodist churches.

500|$|The {{simplest}} interpretations {{in scientific}} writing, history of science, and literary criticism take the parable at face value, accepting empiricism and observation as legitimate techniques. For example, when writing about stellar atmospheres, Dimitri Mihalas states that [...] "it is specimens, not facts, that <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>ultimate</b> empirical currency {{that we must}} use if we wish to purchase a valid theory" [...] before beginning a discussion of Pound's sunfish.|$|E
500|$|In practice, {{demand is}} likely to be only {{relatively}} elastic or relatively inelastic, that is, somewhere between the extreme cases of perfect elasticity or inelasticity. More generally, then, the higher the elasticity of demand compared to PES, the heavier the burden on producers; conversely, the more inelastic the demand compared to PES, the heavier the burden on consumers. [...] The general principle is that the party (i.e., consumers or producers) that has fewer opportunities to avoid the tax by switching to alternatives will bear the greater proportion of the tax burden. In the end the whole tax burden is carried by individual households since they <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>ultimate</b> owners of the means of production that the firm utilises (see Circular flow of income).|$|E
500|$|Kain's {{character}} was originally conceived circa 1993 by Silicon Knights' president, Denis Dyack, as {{the protagonist of}} The Pillars of Nosgoth, an initial video game concept for what would become 1996's [...] He was modeled in part on William Munny, the protagonist of Clint Eastwood's 1992 Western film, Unforgiven. The developers set out to craft an antihero to suit [...] "a game where the player is put in the position where everyone believes you are evil", feeling that the industry required a story addressing issues of moral ambiguity and wondering how players would react when [...] "everyone {{in the world was}} your enemy (including yourself) [...] where you had to kill innocents to survive [...] you <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>ultimate</b> pawn". Other influences which helped to define Kain's character arc included The Wheel of Time, Necroscope, and cover art from The Pillars of the Earth. In comparison to Count Dracula, Dyack commented {{in an interview that he}} believed Kain would [...] "kick his ass" [...] in a fight. He and writer Ken McCulloch considered Simon Templeman's voiceover for the character superlative, despite initial apprehensions that the actors they had hired might not be able to convey the game's complicated dialogue.|$|E

500|$|The novel {{met with}} [...] "a crackle of {{favorable}} reviews in major papers". The New Republic hailed it as [...] "an exceptional work", both [...] "thoughtful and irrepressibly imaginative". The Houston Chronicle described Clarke as [...] "a superb character writer", and the Denver Post {{called her a}} [...] "superb storyteller". The reviews praised Clarke's [...] "deft" [...] handling of the pastiche of styles, but many criticised the novel's pace, The Guardian complaining that [...] "the plot creaks frightfully in many places and the pace dawdles". In his review for Science Fiction Weekly, Clute suggested that [...] "almost every scene in the first 300 pages should have been carefully and delicately trimmed" [...] (emphasis in original) since they do little to advance the story. He argued that, at times, Clarke's Austenesque tone {{gets in the way}} of plot development. On the other hand, The Baltimore Sun found the novel [...] "a quick read". Complaining that the book leaves the reader [...] "longing for just a bit more lyricism and poetry", The Washington Post reviewer noted, with others, that [...] "sex plays virtually no role in the story... one looks in vain for the corruption of the innocent". The New Statesman reviewer, Amanda Craig, praised the novel as [...] "a tale of magic such as might have been written by the young Jane Austen– or, perhaps, by the young Mrs Radcliffe, whose Gothic imagination and exuberant delicacy of style set the key." [...] However, she also criticised the book: [...] "As fantasy, it is deplorable, given that it fails to embrace the essentially anarchic nature of such tales. What is so wonderful about magicians, wizards and all witches other than Morgan le Fay is not just their magical powers, but that they possess these in spite of being low-born. Far from caring about being gentlemen, wizards <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>ultimate</b> expression of rank's irrelevance to talent". However, reviewers were not in universal agreement on any of these points. Maguire wrote in the New York Times: ...|$|E
2500|$|Altruism figures {{prominently}} in Buddhism. Love and compassion are components {{of all forms}} of Buddhism, and are focused on all beings equally: love is the wish that all beings be happy, and compassion is the wish that all beings be free from suffering.

In an extreme form, the idea of consequentialism is commonly encapsulated in the saying, [...] "the end justifies the [...] ", meaning that if a goal is morally important enough, any method of achieving it is acceptable.|$|E

2500|$|Leibniz's {{best known}} {{contribution}} to metaphysics is {{his theory of}} monads, as exposited in Monadologie. According to Leibniz, monads are elementary particles with blurred perceptions of one another. [...] Monads can also {{be compared to the}} corpuscles of the Mechanical Philosophy of René Descartes and others. Monads <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>ultimate</b> elements of the universe. The monads are [...] "substantial forms of being" [...] with the following properties: they are eternal, indecomposable, individual, subject to their own laws, un-interacting, and each reflecting the entire universe in a pre-established harmony (a historically important example of panpsychism). Monads are centers of force; substance is force, while space, matter, and motion are merely phenomenal.|$|E
2500|$|The One and the Indefinite Dyad <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>ultimate</b> {{ground of}} {{everything}} because {{the realm of}} Plato's Forms and the totality of reality derive from their interaction. The whole manifold of sensory phenomena rests in the end on only two factors. [...] Form issues from the One, which is the productive factor; the formless Indefinite Dyad serves as the substrate for {{the activity of the}} One. Without such a substrate, the One could produce nothing. All Being rests upon the action of the One upon the Indefinite Dyad. This action sets limits to the formless, gives it Form and particularity, and is therefore also the principle of individuation that brings separate entities into existence. A mixture of both principles underlies all Being.|$|E
