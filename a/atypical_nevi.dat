40|$|Several case-control studies {{identified}} {{common and}} <b>atypical</b> melanocytic <b>nevi</b> as major risk indicators {{for the development}} of cutaneous melanoma. The present investigation was planned to detect factors associated with the prevalence of these melanoma risk markers. Whole-body examination findings and interview data of 513 melanoma patients and 498 age- and sex-matched control subjects were analyzed. Existence of more than 50 common melanocytic nevi and the presence of <b>atypical</b> melanocytic <b>nevi</b> were significantly related to age and gender, with significantly elevated relative risk for their prevalence before the age of 60 and in males. Additionally, sunburns before the age of 20 were significantly associated with both more than 50 common melanocytic nevi (relative risk = 1. 7) and the presence of <b>atypical</b> melanocytic <b>nevi</b> (relative risk = 1. 5). Actinic lentigines were found more frequently with increasing age, and the presence of actinic lentigines was significantly related to a tendency of freckling in adolescence (relative risk = 2. 0) and to two or more sunburns after the age of 20 (relative risk = 1. 6). In conclusion, sunburns before the age of 20 {{contribute to the development of}} multiple melanocytic <b>nevi</b> and <b>atypical</b> melanocytic <b>nevi.</b> In adulthood, this type of sun exposure is associated with the development of actinic lentigines. The relative risk of developing cutaneous melanoma increases in association with the development of these benign melanocytic lesions...|$|R

40|$|<b>Atypical</b> <b>nevi</b> {{and other}} {{potential}} {{risk factors for}} uveal melanoma were studied in 109 uveal melanoma patients and 149 controls. Information concerning employment, medical history, drug use, family history of cancer, excess sun exposure, and blistering sunburn {{before and after the}} age of 15 was obtained. A total skin examination was performed and skin type, hair color, eye color, freckles, actinic damage, the total number of common acquired nevi, and the number of clinically <b>atypical</b> <b>nevi</b> were noted. More <b>atypical</b> <b>nevi</b> were found in uveal melanoma patients than in controls (age- and sex-adjusted odds ratio of 2. 9 [95 % confidence interval 1. 2 - 6. 3] for one or two <b>atypical</b> <b>nevi</b> versus none; odds ratio of 5. 1 [95 % CI 1. 3 - 20. 0] for three or more <b>atypical</b> <b>nevi</b> versus none).

40|$|<b>Atypical</b> <b>nevi</b> {{share some}} dermoscopic {{features}} with early melanoma, and computer elaboration of digital images could represent a useful support to diagnosis. The aim {{of our study}} was to automatically assess colors in <b>atypical</b> <b>nevi,</b> and to compare the data with those referring to clearly benign nevi and melanomas. Dermoscopic images of 459 melanocytic lesions, referring to 76 <b>atypical</b> <b>nevi,</b> 288 clearly benign nevi and 95 melanomas, were acquired {{by means of a}} digital videomicroscope (Videocap 100, DS-Medica, Italy) employing a 20 -fold magnification. An image analysis program, based on an approach, which shares some similarities with the human perception of colors, was employed. For the evaluation of colors in melanocytic lesion images, the identification of the six main color groups (black, dark brown, light brown, red, white and blue-gray) and the numerical description of color areas were obtained. Black, white and blue-gray were more frequently found in <b>atypical</b> <b>nevi</b> than in clearly benign nevi, but less frequently than in melanomas. Color area values significantly differed between the three groups, showing increasing irregularity in color distribution from benign lesions to <b>atypical</b> <b>nevi</b> and melanomas.

To explore clinical treatments that might interfere with and possibly prevent atypical nevus progression, a previous study documented that 3 months systemic low-dose interferon-α (IFN-α) treatment of patients with a clinical history of melanoma and numerous <b>atypical</b> <b>nevi,</b> led to inactivation of the STAT 1 and STAT 3 transcription factors in <b>atypical</b> <b>nevi.</b> Based upon this finding, we initiated a second study to determine whether systemic low-dose IFN-α treatment also impairs the expression of upstream regulators and downstream targets of STAT 1 and STAT 3 in <b>atypical</b> <b>nevi.</b> Using cyanine dye-conjugated antibodies, fluorescence imaging analysis revealed expression of JAK 2, JNK 1, AKT 1, NF-κB, and IFN-αβ receptor in benign and <b>atypical</b> <b>nevi,</b> and early- and advanced-stage melanomas. To determine possible changes {{in the level of}} expression of these molecules in <b>atypical</b> <b>nevi,</b> excised before and after 3 months of systemic low-dose IFN-α treatment, newly designed optical imaging software was used to quantitate the captured fluorescent hybridization signals on a cell-by-cell basis and across an entire nevus section.

40|$|A {{definite}} diagnosis {{cannot be}} established based on histologic features {{alone in a}} large number of Spitz nevi and spitzoid melanomas. In a vast majority of common benign and malignant melanocytic lesions, B-RAF and N-RAS mutations were described, but these were not detected in Spitz nevi. In contrast, H-RAS mutations were frequently encountered in Spitz nevi, but only rarely in melanomas. To date, B-RAF mutation analysis has not been reported in <b>atypical</b> Spitz <b>nevi,</b> and {{there are only a few}} reports of it in spitzoid melanomas. We analyzed 96 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded spitzoid melanocytic lesions for hotspot mutations in B-RAF, N-RAS, and H-RAS genes to test the assumption whether mutation analysis would assist a more accurate diagnosis of spitzoid melanocytic lesions, which are notoriously difficult to classify. B-RAF or N-RAS mutations were observed in 31 of 36 (86 %) spitzoid melanomas, and in 6 of 7 (86 %) spitzoid melanoma metastases. In contrast, none of the 14 Spitz nevi and none of the 16 <b>atypical</b> Spitz <b>nevi</b> had mutations in any of the three genes. A B-RAF or N-RAS mutation was found in 8 of 23 (35 %) spitzoid lesions suspected for melanoma.

40|$|Different {{pigmentary}} {{characteristics as}} well as different parameters of sun exposure have previously been identified as risk factors for developing cutaneous melanoma. The aim {{of the present study}} was to identify significant risk factors, de- termine the related magnitude of their estimated relative risks, and define criteria for the detection of persons at risk. Five hundred thirteen melanoma patients and 498 controls matched for age and sex underwent a whole-body examination for the number and type of melanocytic lesions and were interviewed on ultraviolet exposure and other potential risk factors. The total number of common melanocytic nevi on all body sites represented the most important risk factor in multiple logistic regression analysis with a relative risk of 7. 6 for subjects with more than 100 versus no more than 10 melanocytic nevi. Other significant independent risk factors were the number of <b>atypical</b> melanocytic <b>nevi</b> (relative risk, 6. 1 for at least 5 melanocytic nevi versus none), the number of actinic lentigines (relative risk, 3. 5 for many versus none), hair color, skin type, and reported melanocytic nevus growth. No single parameter of sun exposure was significantly related to melanoma risk in the multivariate analysis. Groups with an estimated relative risk between 1 and 121. 0 were distinguished by considering common and <b>atypical</b> melanocytic <b>nevi</b> {{as well as}} actinic lentigines as the decisive criteria. In conclusion, even without any information on the case history, whole-body examination and diagnosis of pigmented lesions was found to be an effective strategy for identifying persons at risk of developing melanoma. Furthermore, clinical recognition of at least 5 <b>atypical</b> melanocytic <b>nevi</b> without histologic examination is a key for identifying subjects at high risk...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: In {{the setting}} of {{familial}} melanoma, the presence of <b>atypical</b> <b>nevi,</b> which are the precursors of melanoma, {{is associated with a}} nearly 100 % risk of developing primary melanoma by age 70. In patients with sporadic melanoma, it is estimated that 40 - 60 % of melanomas develop in contiguous association with <b>atypical</b> <b>nevi.</b> Currently, the only way to prevent <b>atypical</b> <b>nevi</b> from progressing to melanoma is to monitor and excise them as soon as they exhibit changes in their clinical features. Activation of the transcription factor, Stat 3, has been linked to abnormal cell growth and transformation as well as to interferon alpha (IFN-alpha) -mediated growth suppression in vitro. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To determine whether IFN-alpha, used for adjuvant therapy of high-risk, resected melanoma, induces changes in Stat 3 in <b>atypical</b> <b>nevi,</b> patients with a clinical history of melanoma who have multiple <b>atypical</b> <b>nevi</b> were treated for 3 months with low-dose IFN-alpha. Thereupon, the new technology of microscopic spectral imaging and biochemical assays such as electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) and immunoblot analysis were used for the study of <b>atypical</b> <b>nevi,</b> obtained before and after IFN-alpha treatment. RESULTS: The results of the investigations provided evidence that, as a result of systemic IFN-alpha treatment, Stat 1 and Stat 3, which are constitutively activated in melanoma precursor lesions, lose their ability to bind DNA, and as shown in the case of Stat 3, become dephosphorylated. CONCLUSIONS: Unlike primary and metastatic melanomas, melanoma precursor lesions cannot be established as cell cultures. Thus, the only way to explore pathways and treatment regimens that might help prevent progression to melanoma is {{within the context of a}} melanoma precursor lesion study conducted prospectively. The findings presented here suggest that down-regulation of the transcription factors Stat 1 and Stat 3 by systemic IFN-alpha treatment may represent a potential pathway to prevent the activation of gene(s) whose expression may be required for atypical nevus cells to progress to melanoma...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND Clark <b>nevi</b> (<b>atypical</b> melanocytic <b>nevi)</b> can be {{considered}} as risk markers and potential precursors of melanoma. The authors report on the morphologic changes of an atypical nevus by dermoscopic follow-up examination over a 7 -year period. CASE REPORT A 43 -year-old man had a brown macule on his back, sized 5 mm, with an irregular shape, clinically and dermoscopically diagnosed as an equivocal melanocytic lesion. Dermoscopically during the initial examination, a predominant reticular pattern with peripheral eccentric hyperpigmentation in the lower portion of the lesion could be seen. After 7 months, the area of peripheral eccentric hyperpigmentation had regressed, and after 4. 5 years the atypical pigment network had almost disappeared. After 7 years of follow-up, a diffuse area of hypopigmentation and a residual light brown pigmentation were detectable. The histopathologic diagnosis was consistent with an atypical junctional nevus with regression with features of a Clark nevus.

40|$|<b>Atypical</b> (dysplastic) <b>nevi</b> are melanocytic lesions, {{which are}} {{precursors}} of melanoma {{as well as}} markers of increased melanoma risk. Although these lesions exhibit distinct clinical and histological features, their molecular features are largely unknown. To determine whether atypical, compared to benign nevi, from patients with a clinical history of malignant melanoma reveal molecular changes, we analyzed these lesions {{for the expression of}} two growth factors (basic fibroblast growth factor and transforming growth factor a), their receptors (fibroblast growth factor receptor-I and epidermal growth factor receptor), and two cell adhesion molecules (MUC 18 and avfi 3 integrin), all of which are expressed in primary and metastatic melanomas. The results demonstrated a statistically significant correlation (P = 0. 02) between increasing degrees of histological atypia and expression of epidermal growth factor receptor in the epidermal keratinocytes of atypical melanocytic lesions. Furthermore, both <b>atypical</b> and benign <b>nevi</b> revealed considerably high levels of overall gene activity in their dermal melanocytic and epidermal keratinocytic compartments.

40|$|Before {{the controversies}} {{surrounding}} dysplastic melanocytic nevi are resolved, dermatopathologists {{must be able}} to reliably distinguish dysplastic nevi from common acquired nevi and malignant melanoma. To establish whether grading of melanocytic dysplasia has any biologic relevance, dermatopathologists {{must be able to}} consistently recognize two or more grades of atypia. We studied the concordance among five dermatopathologists for recognition and grading of 60 nevomelanocytic lesions. Ten cases from each of the following categories of melanocytic proliferation were retrieved from the Massachusetts General Hospital files: (1) common melanocytic nevi, (2) melanocytic nevi with features of dysplastic nevi, (3) dysplastic nevi with slight cytologic atypia, (4) dysplastic nevi with moderate cytologic atypia, (5) dysplastic nevi with severe cytologic atypia, and (6) primary malignant melanoma. The slides were reviewed independently; no discussion of diagnostic criteria preceded the review. Overall concordance for diagnosing dysplastic nevi was 77 %, with a kappa statistic of 0. 55 – 0. 84. Furthermore, in grading dysplastic nevi, experienced dermatopathologists had a concordance ranging from 35 to 58 % (kappa value 0. 38 – 0. 47). Those with less experience in grading dysplastic nevi had a concordance of 16 – 65 % (kappa value 0. 05 – 0. 24). The five observers in this study reliably distinguished dysplastic nevi from common acquired nevi and malignant melanoma. Further refinement of the criteria for grading of nevomelanocytic dysplasia and experience in grading are critical for accuracy in subcategorization of dysplastic nevi. Consistent, reproducible subcategorization or dysplastic nevi is a requisite before the issue of biologic or prognostic relevance of grading (dysplastic nevi) can be addressed. This study supports the validity of existing criteria for the diagnosis of dysplastic nevi because the problems in diagnosis were at the limits of the spectrum, namely, discrimination of slightly <b>atypical</b> dysplastic <b>nevi</b> from common <b>nevi</b> and severely <b>atypical</b> dysplastic <b>nevi</b> from radial growth phase melanoma...|$|R

Two observers retrospectively examined digitalized dermoscopic images of 19 atypical melanocytic nevi from 15 {{children and young adults}} (median age 12 years, range 3 - 26 years). The images were assessed for global dermoscopic patterns at baseline and after a median 25 -month (range 6 - 138 mos) follow-up. Ten (52. 6 %) nevi changed and nine (47. 4 %) retained a stable dermoscopic pattern. Of the 10 changing lesions, 2 of 4 homogeneous nevi evolved into a reticular pattern and 2 into a mixed pattern; 1 of 2 nevi with a mixed pattern evolved into a homogeneous nevus and 1 into a regressing nevus; 1 of 2 nevi with "other" patterns, such as negative pigment network and peppering throughout the lesion, evolved into a mixed nevus and 1 into a regressing nevus; 1 globular nevus evolved into a mixed pattern; and 1 starburst nevus evolved into a homogeneous nevus.

40|$|Full list {{of author}} {{information}} {{is available at the}} end of the articleBackground Malignant melanoma is an aggressive skin cancer with rapidly increasing incidence worldwide [1, 2]. At the early phase, the disease can often be cured surgically, but the prognosis is worse in advanced stages resulting from its therapy resistance [3]. Although exposure to UV radiation is considered as the major risk factor for melanoma [4], a large number of <b>nevi</b> and <b>atypical</b> dysplastic <b>nevi</b> are asso-ciated with increased risk [5]. The dynamic extracellular matrix has been shown to contribute to cancer progression. In the skin, an abun-dant extracellular matrix molecule is hyaluronan (HA), which is composed of repeating disaccharide units of N-acetylglucosamine and glucuronic acid. This simple sugar molecule has been shown to enhance tumor cell invasion, proliferation and metastasis, and to promote drug resistance leading to a poor clinical prognosis (reviewed in [6]).

40|$|Melanin {{synthesis}} is an oxygen-dependent {{process that}} acts as a potential source of reactive oxygen species (ROS) inside pigment-forming cells. The synthesis of the lighter variant of melanin, pheomelanin, consumes cysteine and this may limit the capacity of the cellular antioxidative defense. We show that tyrosine-induced melanogenesis in cultured normal human melanocytes (NHM) is accompanied by increased production of ROS and decreased concentration of intracellular glutathione. Clinical <b>atypical</b> (dysplastic) <b>nevi</b> (DN) regularly contain more melanin than do normal melanocytes (MC). We also show that in these cultured DN cells three out of four exhibit elevated synthesis of pheomelanin and this is accompanied by their early senescence. By using various redox-sensitive molecular probes, we demonstrate that cultured DN cells produce significantly more ROS than do normal MC from the same donor. Our experiments employing single-cell gel electrophoresis (comet assay) usually reveal higher fragmentation of DNA in DN cells than in normal MC. Even if in some cases the normal alkaline comet assay shows no differences in DNA fragmentation between DN cells and normal MC, the use of the comet assay with formamidopyrimidine DNA glycosylase can disclose that the DNA of the cultured DN cells harbor more oxidative damage than the DNA of normal MC from the same perso...|$|R

Over the past decade, we observed 8 ultramarathon runners with malignant melanoma. UV exposure, immunosuppression due to long-term intensive exercise, or both have been discussed as potential triggers in these patients. To further evaluate risk factors for malignant melanoma in marathon runners, we examined anamnestic, phenotypic, sun-related, and clinical variables in 210 athletes and compared them with those of an age- and sex-matched control group. Observations Although control subjects exhibited higher sun sensitivity and more common melanocytic nevi, marathon runners presented with more <b>atypical</b> melanocytic <b>nevi,</b> solar lentigines, and lesions suggestive of nonmelanoma skin cancer. These findings correlated with increasing training intensity. During exercising, most runners wore shorts (96. 7 %) and shirts (98. 6 %) that would not or would only partially cover their back and extremities. Regular use of sunscreen was reported in only 56. 2 % of runners.

40|$|We {{analyzed}} {{the value of}} digital epiluminescence microscopy (DELM) for the long-term follow-up of <b>atypical</b> <b>nevi.</b> Patients (n= 530) were prospectively categorized into defined melanoma risk groups and followed by clinical and epiluminescence microscopy (ELM) examinations. <b>Atypical</b> <b>nevi</b> (n= 7001) were additionally followed by DELM. During follow-up (median 32. 2 months), we detected 53 melanomas among 637 excised lesions (8. 3 % overall chance of success). The chance of success for melanoma detection among lesions suspicious by ELM criteria was increased to 17 % when additional DELM-documented changes were present. Moreover, 18 of the 53 melanomas were exclusively identified by DELM-documented changes, indicating that DELM increased {{the sensitivity of the}} ELM analysis by identifying additional melanomas. However, for lesions exclusively excised due to DELM changes, the chance of success was lower than for ELM (5. 2 vs 11. 8 %). Excisions due to mere DELM changes detected 66. 7 % of melanomas in familial atypical mole and multiple melanoma (FAMMM) and 32. 5 % of melanomas in atypical mole syndrome (AMS) patients.

METHODS: At the National Cancer Institute of Naples, Italy, 40 patients with ASN underwent SLNB between 2003 and 2011. Medical records were reviewed and all slides of the primary tumours were retrieved, rendered separately, and assessed by four experienced dermatopathologists from two different academic institutions. Each member of the review panel assessed slides separately without recourse to medical notes and blinded to each others' diagnosis. All patients were treated with wide local excision and SLN biopsy according to the standard procedure. All cases were followed up to assess outcomes. RESULTS: The original diagnosis of ASN was confirmed in all 40 cases. No sentinel node positivity was recorded, and no patients developed nodal involvement during a median follow-up of 46 months (range 16 - 103).

Cytological and architectural features of melanocytic skin lesions were studied on 25 melanomas and 50 <b>atypical</b> melanocytic <b>nevi</b> employing CRM (Vivascope 1000, Lucid Inc., USA) and digital dermoscopy (Videocap 200, DS-Mediroup, Italy). All lesions were excised for diagnostic confirmation. Some differences in CRM features were observed between benign and malignant lesions: in melanocytic nevi, cells were usually round to oval, mainly located in the basal layers or clustered into nests within the papillary dermis. Melanomas were characterized by numerous large cells within the superficial layers of the epidermis, suggesting a pagetoid fashion, and by cells polymorphic in size and shape mainly located in the basal layer, sometimes interrupted by small dermal papillae irregularly distributed throughout the lesion, owing to disarrangement of the normal architecture of the rete ridges. Moreover, large irregular cells with refractive cytoplasm and eccentric dark nucleus infiltrating dermal papilla and cell clusters with a multilobulated feature constituted by sparse cells or with a cerebriform aspect were specifically observed in melanomas. Although preliminary and based on a limited number of cases, these findings show the potential of this technique for the noninvasive diagnosis of clinically difficult lesions...|$|R
40|$|A {{large number}} of benign melanocytic nevi is the major risk factor for {{malignant}} melanoma (MM). In a multicenter case-control study, the number of common (CN) and clinically <b>atypical</b> (AN) <b>nevi</b> were counted separately at individual sites in 278 melanoma patients and 278 age- and gender-matched non-melanoma controls. Relative risk (RR) adjusted for age and sex was calculated. In men as well as women, the number of CN on the legs was {{the best predictor of}} overall melanoma risk. In men, RR for developing MM when {{greater than or equal to}} 1 AN were present on the trunk was 4 -fold (vs. none). In women, presence of AN on the arms increased RR 9. 5 -fold. For men and women combined, after adjusting for age and gender, the RR for developing MM on the trunk and on the legs was best predicted by counts of CN at the respective body region. However, high counts of CN on the arms were associated with high melanoma risk on the legs (somewhat lower on the trunk). For AN, no site-specificity of melanoma risk was found. Our data suggest that nevus counts of the legs are the best predictor of overall melanoma risk if total body nevus counts are not feasible. Although high counts of CN on the trunk and legs are associated with a higher risk of developing MM at the respective site than at another site, our data do not unequivocally support a direct site-specific melanoma risk.

40|$|Skin {{malignant}} melanoma {{is a highly}} angiogenic cancer, necessitating early diagnosis for positive prognosis. The current diagnostic standard of biopsy and histological examination inevitably leads to many unnecessary invasive excisions. Here, we propose a non-invasive method of identification of melanoma based on blood flow dynamics. We consider a wide frequency range from 0. 005 – 2 Hz associated with both local vascular regulation and effects of cardiac pulsation. Combining uniquely the power of oscillations associated with individual physiological processes we obtain a marker which distinguishes between melanoma and <b>atypical</b> <b>nevi</b> with sensitivity of 100 % and specificity of 90. 9 %. The method reveals valuable functional information about the melanoma microenvironment. It also provides the means for simple, accurate, in vivo distinction between {{malignant melanoma}} and <b>atypical</b> <b>nevi,</b> and {{may lead to a}} substantial {{reduction in the number of}} biopsies currently undertaken...|$|E
40|$|In 126 adult renal {{transplant}} recipients who {{had survived}} their transplantation {{for at least}} 8 years, we determined whether numbers of nevi {{and the presence of}} clinically <b>atypical</b> <b>nevi</b> were related to chronic sun exposure. On the basis of a skin examination, three groups were defined: patients with at least one clinically atypical nevus; patients with only clinically normal nevi; and patients without any nevi. The prevalence odds ratio of having any clinically <b>atypical</b> <b>nevi</b> as compared to having only clinically normal nevi was calculated in a logistic model, in relation to gender, skin type, age, sun exposure, and number of keratotic skin lesions present. Similarly, the prevalence odds ratio of having 30 or more nevi compared to fewer than 30 nevi was calculated. We found an inverse association between chronic sun exposure and age with numbers of nevi in adult renal transplant recipients. The presence of clinically <b>atypical</b> <b>nevi</b> was also inversely associated with chronic sun exposure, but this association disappeared after adjustment for age. We did not observe an association of nevi with the number of keratotic skin lesions, nor with humoral immune responses against human papillomavirus and the presence of certain HLA antigens, which are factors associated with nonmelanoma skin cancer in renal transplant recipients. Chronic sun exposure and age appeared to be strong determinants for decreased numbers of nevi in adult renal transplant recipients. Infection with human papillomaviruses does not appear to play an important role...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{stages of}} melanocytic {{progression}} {{are defined as}} atypical (dysplastic) nevus, melanoma in situ, melanoma in the radial growth phase (RGP), melanoma in the vertical growth phase (VGP), and melanoma in the metastatic growth phase (MGP). Melanoma in situ and RGP melanoma often develop in contiguous association with <b>atypical</b> <b>nevi.</b> This frequently poses a problem {{with respect to their}} early detection. Furthermore, unlike cells obtained from VGP and MGP melanomas, cells derived from melanoma in situ and RGP melanoma do not proliferate in vitro. Thus, compared to the late stages of the disease, less information is available regarding genes expressed in the early stages. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To determine whether spectral imaging, a recently developed optical imaging technique, can detect melanoma in situ and RGP melanoma arising in melanoma precursor lesions, <b>atypical</b> <b>nevi</b> in patients with a clinical history of melanoma were subjected to noninvasive macroscopic spectral imaging. To determine at what stage in the progression pathway of melanoma genes having important biological functions in VGP and MGP melanomas are activated and expressed, lesions of melanoma in situ were analyzed by immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization for expression of some of these known molecular and immunologic markers. RESULTS: The present study demonstrates the capability of noninvasive spectral imaging to detect melanoma in situ and RGP melanoma that arise in contiguous association with <b>atypical</b> <b>nevi.</b> Furthermore, the study provides evidence that genes and antigens expressed in VGP and MGP melanoma are also expressed in melanoma in situ. CONCLUSIONS: Because of the dark and variegated pigmentation of <b>atypical</b> <b>nevi,</b> melanoma in situ and RGP melanoma that arise in these melanoma precursor lesions are often difficult to recognize and thus frequently go unnoticed. The application of new optical screening techniques for early detection of melanoma and the identification of genes expressed {{in the early stages of}} melanoma development are two important avenues in the pursuit of melanoma prevention. The investigations presented here document that macroscopic spectral imaging has the potential to detect melanoma in its early stage of development and that genes essential for the proliferation and cell adhesion of VGP and MGP melanoma are already expressed in melanoma in situ...|$|E
40|$|Dermoscopy {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the diagnosis of pigmented lesions, particularly in the differential diagnosis of early-stage melanoma. Dermoscopy systems that aim to enable automatic “unmanned-without physician” diagnosis are becoming increasingly common. We aimed to investigate the reliability and weaknesses of diagnosis programs. Furthermore, we attempted to determine whether such programs are superior to diagnosis by a physician, compared to histopathological assessment. The images stored in the DermoGenius ultra-computerized dermoscopy system of the Dermoscopy Unit between January 2008 and December 2008 were surveyed retrospectively. Dermoscopic images made prior to excision of 77 lesions from 51 patients verified by histopathology were reviewed. Nineteen patients were men and 32 were women. Mean age was 35. 5 years. Diagnosis by a clinician or automatic analysis revealed that 23 (30 %) of the lesions were <b>atypical</b> (dysplastic) <b>nevi,</b> 22 (29 %) were compound nevi, 10 (13 %) were dermal nevi, 8 (10 %) were malignant melanomas, 7 (9 %) were common nevi, 6 (7 %) were junctional nevi, and 1 (1 %) was a blue nevus. Compared to histopathological diagnosis, considered the gold standard, the sensitivity of the automated analysis program was 96. 6 %, its specificity 14. 9 %, and its diagnostic accuracy 47 %. For the clinician, the values were 100 % for sensitivity, 66. 7 % for specificity, and 95 % for diagnostic accuracy. Based on histopathological results, the diagnostic accuracy of the physician was higher than that of the automatic analysis program. Therefore, errors are inevitable when an inexperienced physician assesses patients according to automatic program results. </p...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: <b>Atypical</b> Spitz <b>nevi</b> are an {{important}} diagnostic problem in dermatopathology. The lack of clear histological criteria and reliable immunohistochemical markers makes their further determination toward Spitz nevus, benign tumor, or Spitzoid melanoma difficult. Expression of histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC 2) in Spitz tumors has not been studied so far. Aim: To determine level of expression of HDAC 2 in Spitz tumors and to examine differences in the expression of HDAC 2 related to clinical (sex and age of patients, localization and tumor size) and histopathological parameters (histological type, thickness, depth of invasion and mitotic activity). Material and methods: The study included 78 cases with histopathological Spitz nevus diagnoses, atypical Spitz nevus, superficial atypical Spitz nevus and Spitzoid melanoma. The samples were stained using immunohistochemistry and anti-HDAC 2 antibodies. HDAC 2 expression was analyzed in three components of the tumor (epidermal, superficial and deep dermal) {{in relation to the}} clinical and histopathological characteristics. Results: High expression of HDAC 2 (> 74 %) was generally observed in Spitz tumors. HDAC 2 expression was not associated with different clinical parameters. We found moderately strong positive correlation between the components of the tumor: epidermal and superficial dermal (r= 0. 53; p= 0. 004), epidermal and deep dermal (r= 0. 60; p= 0. 04), superficial and deep dermal (r= 0. 68; p< 0. 001). No difference in the HDAC 2 expression was found between histological types of Spitz tumors. Also, HDAC 2 expression was not associated with different histological prognostic parameters in Spitzoid melanoma. Conclusion: The expression of HDAC 2 in Spitz tumors is high and homogeneous throughout. HDAC 2 expression is not associated with different histological types of Spitz tumors...|$|R
40|$|When {{comparing}} two subsequent {{stages of}} melanocytic tumor progression we identified calcyclin {{as a new}} potential progression marker, the expression of which was correlated with metastatic behavior of various human melanoma cell lines in nude mice. In this study, we describe a good correlation between RNA and protein levels in the xenografts of these cell lines and extended these experiments to a panel of 120 routinely processed human melanocytic cutaneous lesions. Northern blot analysis demonstrated that calcyclin RNA expression was elevated in melanoma metastases as compared to several types of nevocellular nevi. Calcyclin staining using a specific polyclonal antiserum showed a more complex pattern. A stronger staining in {{a higher percentage of}} positive cells was observed in thick primary melanoma (> or = 1. 5 mm) as compared to thin primary melanoma (II) corresponding to the vertical growth phase of primary melanomas. Protein expression in nevocellular nevi was confined to the dermal part and was highest in the lower parts of the dermis. Remarkably, dysplastic <b>nevi</b> (<b>atypical</b> moles), potential precursors of melanoma, did not show any expression at all, either in junctional or dermal parts. Confinement of the expression to the dermal part of nondysplastic nevi and primary melanomas may reflect interactions with the microenvironment of the reticular dermis that occurs with vertical growt...|$|R
