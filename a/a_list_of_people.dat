25|$|For practicality, {{usually only}} the last surname (excluding prepositions) is used in formal {{greetings}} or in scientific papers indexing. But, in <b>a</b> <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>people,</b> the first given name, not the surname, is used for alphabetical sorting. A married woman may add her partner's last surname(s) {{to the end of}} her own name, but this is not mandatory and increasingly less common. The same may happen with men, though this is extremely rare.|$|E
25|$|The given name(s) {{normally}} {{comes before}} the surname. However, in <b>a</b> <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> sorted alphabetically by surname, the surname usually comes first.

In many formal situations, the given name is omitted altogether.|$|E

25|$|In January 1992, {{it came to}} the {{attention}} of Maathai and other pro-democracy activists that <b>a</b> <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> were targeted for assassination and that a government-sponsored coup was possible. Maathai's name was on the list. The pro-democracy group, known as the Forum for the Restoration of Democracy (FORD), presented its information to the media, calling for a general election. Later that day, Maathai received a warning that one of their members had been arrested. Maathai decided to barricade herself in her home. Shortly thereafter, police arrived and surrounded the house. She was besieged for three days before police cut through the bars she had installed on her windows, came in, and arrested her. She and the other pro-democracy activists who had been arrested were charged with spreading malicious rumors, sedition, and treason. After a day and a half in jail, they were brought to a hearing and released on bail. A variety of international organizations and eight senators (including Al Gore and Edward M. Kennedy) put pressure on the Kenyan government to substantiate the charges against the pro-democracy activists or risk damaging relations with the United States. In November 1992, the Kenyan government dropped the charges.|$|E
500|$|The {{investigations}} and surveillance would, in part, assess how the anti-Vietnam War movement could damage Nixon's campaign. Nixon's staff also {{anticipated that the}} Democratic campaign would employ the services of Intertel, a private investigation firm led by former Department of Justice officials who had served under Robert F. Kennedy, a Democrat and former Attorney General. Caulfield noted that this firm {{had the potential to}} employ [...] "formidable and sophisticated" [...] intelligence-gathering techniques, and Sandwedge was his attempt to create a Republican counterpart to it. The plan would involve black bag operations, targeting political enemies of the campaign. Electronic surveillance was also an element of the proposal, with plans to scrutinize the private lives of the targets, including their tax records and sexual habits. The Sandwedge proposal also included <b>a</b> <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> willing to work with Caulfield on the project; these included several investigators and officials of Inland Revenue, and a former sheriff of Cook County, Illinois.|$|E

500|$|After {{defeating}} the Continental Army at the Battle of Long Island on August 27, 1776, British Admiral Richard Howe mistakenly assumed a strategic advantage {{to be at}} hand, and requested the Second Continental Congress send representatives {{in an attempt to}} negotiate peace. A delegation, including Adams and Benjamin Franklin, met with Howe at the Staten Island Peace Conference on September 11. Howe's authority was premised on the Colonists' submission, so no common ground was to be found. When Lord Howe unhappily stated he could view the American delegates only as British subjects, Adams replied, [...] "Your lordship may consider me in what light you please, ...except that of a British subject." [...] Adams learned many years later that his name was on <b>a</b> <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> specifically excluded from Howe's pardon-granting authority. Being quite unimpressed with General Howe, and also after payments to colonial volunteers were increased, Adams in September 1776 said about the war, [...] "We shall do well enough." [...] Indeed, if Washington got his men, the British would be [...] "ruined".|$|E

She reluctantly goes along with it when Noah threatens to fire her.They then introduce Gabriel to Trevor, an evolved human with a kinetic projection ability.

500|$|Portnoy wrote [...] "Repentance" [...] as {{the fourth}} {{part of his}} Twelve-step Suite, a {{collection}} of songs from various Dream Theater albums which revolve around his journey through Alcoholics Anonymous. The song discusses steps eight and nine of the process, which deal with making <b>a</b> <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> whom one has wronged and, if possible, making direct amends with them. Portnoy, who as of 2007 had been sober for 7½ years, invited friends and fellow musicians Mikael Åkerfeldt, Jon Anderson, David Ellefson, Daniel Gildenlöw, Steve Hogarth, Chris Jericho, Neal Morse, Joe Satriani, Corey Taylor, Steve Vai, and Steven Wilson to record spoken apologies, regrets, and sorrows of their own, which were featured throughout the song. Portnoy dedicated [...] "Repentance", [...] "to Bill W. {{and all of his}} friends". During recording, the title of the track was, [...] "Fisheye" [...] and it was the seventh and final song to be written. This saga is concluded in the band's tenth studio album Black Clouds & Silver Linings with [...] "The Shattered Fortress".|$|E
