40|$|This pioneer {{research}} for Pakistan uses monthly time series {{data for the}} period of 1997 - 1 to 2008 - 4 to determine the causal relationship between the money supply, food prices and <b>manufactured</b> <b>product</b> prices in developing country like Pakistan. Empirical analysis is performed by using the ARDL and Toda Yamamoto causality test. The results show that the bidirectional causality between the food prices and money supply and unidirectional causality from money supply to <b>manufactured</b> <b>product</b> prices. On the other hand there is no causal relationship between the food prices and <b>manufactured</b> <b>product</b> prices. The important finding {{of this study is that}} food prices response faster then the <b>manufactured</b> <b>product</b> prices to a change in money supply in the Pakistan. ...|$|R
