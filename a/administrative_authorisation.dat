30|$|We define {{planning}} as {{a long-term}} process that covers the political idea of the project, its incorporation into the national scheme, through to its commissioning once it has been defined. Planning {{in the form of}} plans can be superimposed over time with the implementation of the transport project. The implementation of projects and their progress in terms of design and construction depends on the socio-economic context, their acceptability, the quality of the studies, the obtaining of <b>administrative</b> <b>authorisations</b> and their profitability. It frequently occurs that a project is launched and the plan modified to integrate the project once its characteristics have been defined in terms of the context. The planning integrates a number of different practices such as the detailing of a master plan, the socio-economic evaluation, the environmental evaluation, the level of consultation, the project design, the project management, etc.|$|R

40|$|Domestic {{violence}} is a social-pathology phenomenon, which requires a complex solution in terms of inter-disciplinary attitude. Key role in the system is {{the one of the}} Police of the Czech Republic (further PCR), which in most cases gets first into the contact with a victim and an offender and is authorized to the control and prevention of unacceptable act. According to the legal situation the policemen should secure the safety of an endangered individual, document the incident, effectively regulate a violent person and handle the specific communication with the victim of domestic violence. This thesis deals with the procedure of police organs at the solution of incidents, showing the signs of domestic violence in the connection to the adoption of Act No. 273 / 2008 Coll., on the PCR, which has been valid since 1 st January 2009, and its comparison to the previous legal regulations solving the problems of domestic violence. The objective of the thesis is the description of valid legal regulations, their comparison to the previous state which was solved by the amendment of the original law on the Police of the Czech Republic carried out by the Act No. 135 / 2006 Coll., on protection against domestic violence valid from 1 st January 2007 to 31 st December 2008 and the assessment of present development, especially if the simplification of work of PCR organs in this area (institute of expulsion of a violent person at the solution of incidents with the signs of domestic violence) influences the work of police and solution of these cases. The thesis itself was carried out by the method of questioning, the form of non-standardized interview in terms of qualitative research. The interview was carried out in the sample of police members, placed in basic police stations, where they solve the issue of domestic violence. The interview was also carried out with officials of various command types in the sphere of Regional Police Headquarters of South Bohemian Region. Other respondents were the workers of intervention centres, employees of social and law protection of children institutions and the workers of non-profit organizations functioning in South Bohemian Region and the analysis of study case. By the change of legal regulations the process concerning expulsion of violent person was changed (from the procedure in <b>administrative</b> action to <b>authorisation</b> of a police officer according to the law on PCR). It was found out that by the change in the procedure at expulsion of violent person out of the house by a police organ the course of expulsion became faster and also the possibility of efficient protection of an endangered individual. The change of the process has no effect on the incident assessment...|$|R

40|$|Quality {{assurance}} {{policies for}} long-term care in France are founded on a law passed in 2002, but the organisation {{of the system is}} still underway. It is principally based on a legal framework that sets out requirements for quality monitoring and quality improvement. Quality assessment is related to outcomes, indicators and guidelines. It pertains to formal care and is related to <b>administrative</b> <b>authorisation</b> and financial conditions. In the public sector, the aim is to develop continuous quality assurance in a system differentiated by internal and external quality assessment. In the private sector, the aim is mainly to check conformity with quality standards, as internal and external quality assurance may be replaced by a certification procedure. A central agency is in charge of enhancing quality through the production of new guidelines but quality supervision {{is the role of the}} funding institution and qualitative results are not publicly available. To date, not many organisations or units have conducted the entire quality assurance process, as the quality of long-term care is ensured by an institutional system that is in the final stages of being structured...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Aims and background: The present work {{assessed}} {{the impact of}} two decrees on ethics committees in Italy, aimed at bringing the national laws on the conduct of clinical trials into line {{with the rest of}} the EC, and regulating and facilitating not-for-profit research. Material and methods: Prospectively collected data from an Italian multicentre study were examined with respect to the ethics review process. Administrative and time elements of the review process were audited. Main outcome measures were time between the application submission and the ethics committee definitive opinion, type and number of application submission forms, number of ethics committees that refused fee exemption, and time between the ethics committee approval and the <b>administrative</b> <b>authorisation.</b> Results: A total of 134 local research ethics committees (LRECs) were approached. Application submission procedures and application forms varied greatly; paper submission was mandatory. The median time from submission to approval was 72 days. Only two LRECs refused the fee exemption. The median time from LREC approval to administrative agreement was 50 days and only 9. 6...|$|E
40|$|This report studies {{analytical}} and empirical issues {{encountered in the}} assessment of the influence on aggregate labour markets of legal provisions, institutional arrangements, and jurisprudence in the area of employment protection. It summarises the current state of knowledge in the field, outlines useful research directions, and offers a preliminary discussion of new relevant information. Section 2 surveys existing theoretical work and empirical evidence on the relationship between Employment Protection Legislation (EPL) and broad labour market performance indicators. (The more complex issue of whether employment-reduction costs can directly or indirectly increase the productivity of employment relations is not directly addressed in this Report. We do note, however, that such effects and/or insurance concerns must have motivated existing legislation, and should be taken into account by any reform process). Formal models of dynamic labour demand do not yield clear-cut implications as to the relation between employment protection and main labour market aggregates, such as employment and unemployment rates and labour force participation. However, these models unambiguously indicate that employment should be more stable and individual employment relationships more durable when employment reduction is costly for employers. The set of rules governing unfair dismissals, layoffs for economic reasons, severance payments, minimum notice periods, <b>administrative</b> <b>authorisation</b> for dismissals and prior discussion with representative of unions and/or labour market administrations certainly implies that employment reductions are costly for employers; it does so, however, in ways that are hard to represent quantitatively. Previous research has circumvented measurement difficulties by r [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Defence date: 26 April 2012 Examining Board: Professor Heike Schweitzer, Universität Mannheim and European University Institute (Supervisor) Professor Hans-Wolfgang Micklitz, European University Institute Professor Lorenzo F. Pace, Università degli Studi del Molise Professor Harm Schepel, Kent Law SchoolThe {{enactment}} of Regulation 1 / 2003 radically {{changed the rules}} for the application of Art. 101 and Art. 102 TFEU, replacing the existing system of prior <b>administrative</b> <b>authorisation</b> by one of a directly applicable exception coupled with the possibility of national authorities applying Art. 101 (3) TFEU. Concerns over substantial consistency in the application of European competition law (“ECL”) were the main reason for the introduction of the so-called rule of convergence under Art. 3 of Regulation 1 / 2003. Although Art. 3 expanded and gave statutory weight to the assertion of supremacy of ECL over national competition law (“NCL”), initially acknowledged in the Walt Wilhelm judgement, it did not rule out completely the possibility of Member States applying stricter NCL to unilateral conduct adopted by undertakings (Art. 3 (2) second sentence). Prima facie, the exception would cover national provisions prohibiting the abuse of economic dependence/superior bargaining power, resale below cost/at a loss, as well as some types of unilateral conduct not related to economic dependence (e. g. boycott). An inquiry into four selected jurisdictions (France, Germany, Italy and the UK) reveals that not all national provisions whose primary goal is “the protection of competition on the market” (Rec. 9 of Regulation 1 / 2003) should be taken as a legitimate manifestation of plurality compatible with the concerns over substantive consistency mirrored in Art. 3 (2) second sentence. The primary reason for this selective approach is that some national provisions, in particular those that prohibit per se resale below cost/at a loss, want a valid economic rationale for the purpose of competition law. Conversely, other stricter national provisions may be regarded as performing a complementary role vis-à-vis ECL, as it may be the case of the prohibition of economic dependence applied to the automotive and food-supply sectors. Despite the substantial changes introduced by Art. 3 in the relationship between ECL and NCL, Art. 3 (2) second sentence can be regarded as a continuation of the case law inaugurated by the Walt Wilhelm judgement, recognising, albeit in more limited terms, that “unitas in diversitate” is an integrating part of competition law...|$|E
