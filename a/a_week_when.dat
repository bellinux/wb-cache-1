5|$|Additional {{problems}} were discovered when the ride {{opened to the}} public. The WindSeeker at Canada's Wonderland underwent repairs for just over <b>a</b> <b>week</b> <b>when</b> {{it was discovered that}} one of the 32 pairs of seats had been removed for an unstated reason. They were replaced and testing began shortly after. In another case at the same installation, riders were stuck {{at the top of the}} WindSeeker tower for 20 minutes when the swings did not come down. Since these incidents, ride operations are suspended during high winds or heavy rain.|$|E
5|$|The twelve finalists {{from the}} fifth {{series of the}} UK TV talent show The X Factor {{released}} a cover of the song on October 27, 2008 for the Help for Heroes and The Royal British Legion charities. The release was backed by, and originally suggested by, The Sun newspaper. The finalists performed the single {{for the first time}} alongside Mariah Carey on October 25, 2008 during <b>a</b> <b>week</b> <b>when</b> only Carey's material could be sung. The single was released on download on 26 October 2008, followed by the physical release the day after.|$|E
5|$|When the 3rd Infantry {{landed at}} Licata, Sicily, on 10 July, Murphy was a {{division}} runner. On a scouting patrol, he killed two fleeing Italian officers near Canicattì. Sidelined with illness for <b>a</b> <b>week</b> <b>when</b> Company B arrived in Palermo on 20 July, he rejoined {{them when they}} were assigned to a hillside location protecting a machine-gun emplacement, {{while the rest of the}} 3rd Infantry Division fought at San Fratello en route to the Allied capture of the transit port of Messina.|$|E

5|$|Chazz Palminteri as U.S. Customs Special Agent Dave Kujan. Singer {{had always}} wanted the actor for the film, {{but he was always}} unavailable. The role was offered to Christopher Walken and Robert De Niro, both of whom turned it down. The filmmakers even had Al Pacino come in and read for the part, but he decided not to do it because he had just played a cop in Heat. Palminteri became available, but only for <b>a</b> <b>week.</b> <b>When</b> he signed on, this persuaded the film's {{financial}} backers to support the film fully because he was a sufficiently high-profile star, thanks to the recent release of A Bronx Tale and Bullets Over Broadway.|$|E
5|$|The first dent to morale {{came after}} about <b>a</b> <b>week</b> <b>when</b> the volunteers were first issued {{ranks in the}} Rhodesian Army. In {{the eyes of some}} of the French-speaking soldiers, the ranks {{assigned}} appeared to have been chosen almost at random by their superiors, and did not reflect their actual respective levels of training, ability and experience. Some men who considered themselves to have been overlooked began to have problems with discipline. The brazen attitude of most of the company's soldiers jarred strongly with that of their Rhodesian commanders, who had high standards regarding presentation and dress which many of the Frenchmen had little inclination to meet.|$|E
5|$|Richard died on May 10, 1958; it was {{ten days}} before the child's tenth birthday. Skelton was {{scheduled}} to do his weekly television show on the day his son was buried. Though there were recordings of some older programs available which the network could have run, he asked that guest performers be used instead. Calling themselves The Friends of Red Skelton, his friends in the television, film and music industries organized The Friends Of Red Skelton Variety Show, which they performed to replace The Red Skelton Show for that week; by May 27, 1958, Skelton had returned to his program. The death of Richard profoundly affected the family; by 1961 Richard's model trains had been moved to a storeroom in the Bel Air mansion, but Skelton refused to have them dismantled. In 1962, the Skelton family moved to Palm Springs, and Skelton used the Bel Air home only on the two days <b>a</b> <b>week</b> <b>when</b> he was in Los Angeles for his television show taping.|$|E

25|$|York {{proceeded}} to Fort Oglethorpe, Georgia, {{where he was}} discharged from the service, and then to Tennessee for more celebrations. He had been home for barely <b>a</b> <b>week</b> <b>when,</b> on June 7, 1919, York and Gracie Loretta Williams (February 7, 1900– September 27, 1984) were married by Tennessee Governor Albert H. Roberts in Pall Mall. More celebrations followed the wedding, including a week-long trip to Nashville where York accepted a special medal awarded by the state.|$|E

25|$|Firm kiwifruit ripen after a {{few days}} to <b>a</b> <b>week</b> <b>when</b> stored at room temperature, but should not be kept in direct sunlight. Faster {{ripening}} occurs when placed in a paper bag with an apple, pear, or banana. Once a kiwifruit is ripe, however, it is preserved optimally when stored far from other fruits, as it is very sensitive to the ethylene gas they may emit, thereby tending to over-ripen even in the refrigerator. If stored appropriately, ripe kiwifruit normally keep for about one to two weeks.|$|E
25|$|At first, units {{tried to}} cover their sectors every day. Later, the number and {{seriousness}} of border violations by Mexicans decreased, and the patrols tapered off. In the autumn of 1920, the schedule for the 1st Surveillance Group called for flights twice <b>a</b> <b>week.</b> <b>When</b> exercises with ground forces or other activities interfered, patrols might be canceled for days or even weeks at a time. Brig. Gen. William Mitchell’s need for men and planes from the border for bombing tests against naval vessels off the Virginia Capes in June 1921 brought border patrol to an end.|$|E
25|$|In January 1975, just a {{few months}} after his {{marriage}} to Zanele, Mbeki was sent to Swaziland to assess the possibility of setting up an ANC frontline base in the country. Ostensibly attending a UN conference, Mbeki was accompanied by Max Sisulu. The duo met with Sisulu's sister, Lindiwe Sisulu, who was studying at the University at Swaziland. Lindiwe set up a meeting for the two at the home of S'bu Ndebele, then a librarian at the university. Mbeki and Sisulu held meetings in Swaziland for a week with South Africans studying there to assess the situation. They returned to Lusaka after <b>a</b> <b>week,</b> <b>when</b> their visas had expired. Mbeki reported back to the ANC that the possibility of establishing an ANC base in Swaziland was promising, especially because of its location, as it was close to Johannesburg and Durban.|$|E

25|$|Paramus, {{along with}} the rest of Bergen County, has strict blue laws {{preventing}} stores selling non-food items from opening on Sundays. Although it started as a religious observance, it is kept on the books due to a desire of the residents of Paramus to have one day <b>a</b> <b>week</b> <b>when</b> traffic is tolerable in the town. This law was called into question when a BJ's Wholesale Club opened at the Routes 4/17 junction. BJ's was allowed to open on Sundays, but is only allowed to sell food and basic necessities. The store has been structured to restrict access to items that cannot be purchased on Sunday. Paramus has its own blue laws that are significantly more restrictive than those in effect in other communities in Bergen County. It is one of the last places in the United States to have such an extensive blue law.|$|E
500|$|Watson's new column quickly broadened {{its scope}} {{to cover all}} aspects of life in Seattle. In 1959 it was rechristened [...] "This, Our City." [...] By 1962, the column, {{primarily}} a [...] "three dot" [...] compilation of short items, was running five days <b>a</b> <b>week.</b> <b>When</b> a particular issue caught his attention, Watson would produce a longer, essay-style column. It was these essay-style columns that provided most of the fodder for his 1993 book, My Life in Print.|$|E
500|$|The {{controversy}} over Marsh's bowling action {{came to a}} head in the return match against Victoria at the SCG. The fixture had been slated for the Australia Day weekend but it was postponed by <b>a</b> <b>week</b> <b>when</b> Queen Victoria died. By the time the match was under way, public interest had started to wane. Some three decades later, J. C. Davis reflected on the match, noting that it stirred many memories, [...] "some fragrant and some rather unpleasant". The unsavoury incident that he alluded to was Crockett's continual no-balling of Marsh for throwing.|$|E
50|$|Bernardo {{made his}} Scottish Premier League {{on the final}} day of the season in a 1-2 home loss against Kilmarnock, but left the club <b>a</b> <b>week</b> later <b>when</b> his {{short-term}} contract expired.|$|R

500|$|Kentucky {{was one of}} {{the schools}} that held their public {{practice}} event a week early in part because they could lure more recruiting prospects during <b>a</b> <b>week</b> <b>when</b> most other programs were not hosting similar events. [...] The National Association of Basketball Coaches asked the Southeastern Conference to force Kentucky to adhere to the traditionally scheduled practice to no avail. [...] They then belatedly petitioned the NCAA to legislate conformity unsuccessfully. [...] Kentucky coach Billy Gillispie had contacted the Kentucky's compliance office, the SEC and the NCAA to ensure that no rules were being violated.|$|E
500|$|Livingston {{has also}} {{employed}} {{the assistance of}} other people, notably Michael Clements, founder of the Half-Life 2 comics repository PHWOnline, and creator of SKETCH, another comic based on Half-Life 2. Clements aided him in enhancing the presentation of Concerned. [...] Greg Galcik, creator of SpinnWebe, also assisted in site maintenance, and Livingston later offered him a [...] "guest week special", in which Galcik wrote and published three issues for Concerned. [...] A similar set of three issues have also been published by Joe Yuska, during <b>a</b> <b>week</b> <b>when</b> Livingston was unavailable.|$|E
500|$|Blanchard had {{performed}} regularly at the Tivoli Gardens, making ascents twice <b>a</b> <b>week</b> <b>when</b> {{she was in}} Paris. She had been warned repeatedly {{of the danger of}} using fireworks in her exhibitions. This display was to be a particularly impressive one with many more pyrotechnics than usual, and it appears that the warnings had made an impression on her. Some spectators implored her not to make the ascent, but others, eager to see the show, urged her on. One report suggested that she finally made up her mind and stepped into her chair with the words [...] "Allons, ce sera pour la dernière fois" [...] ("Let's go, this will be for the last time").|$|E
