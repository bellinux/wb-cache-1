5|$|Students {{initiated}} a major demonstration in 1968 over two main issues. The first was Columbia's proposed gymnasium in neighboring Morningside Park; this {{was seen by}} the protesters to be an <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>aggression</b> aimed at the black residents of neighboring Harlem. A second issue was the Columbia administration's failure to resign its institutional membership in the Pentagon's weapons research think-tank, the Institute for Defense Analyses (IDA). Students barricaded themselves inside Low Library, Hamilton Hall, and several other university buildings during the protests, and New York City police were called onto the campus to arrest or forcibly remove the students.|$|E
5|$|Encouraged by Nogai, in 1292 Shishman {{launched}} a major campaign against Milutin, his Serbian neighbour to the west. Thanks {{to the support}} of Tatar mercenaries, Shishman's forces raided deeply into Serbian territory and reached Hvosno in Kosovo. After attempting to conquer the fortress of Ždrelo near Peć to no avail and burning the Žiča monastery, Shishman's troops returned to Vidin without any territorial gains. Milutin's response to Shishman's <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>aggression</b> was much more successful. His counter-attack resulted in Serbian forces reaching Vidin and capturing Shishman's capital after a brief siege. The despot, however, managed to escape north of the Danube {{to the safety of}} his Tatar suzerains.|$|E
5|$|Washington's {{military}} experience {{began in the}} French and Indian War with a commission as a major in the militia of the British Province of Virginia. In 1753 Washington was sent as an ambassador from the British crown to the French officials and Indians {{as far north as}} present-day Erie, Pennsylvania. The following year he led another expedition to the area to assist in the construction of a fort at present-day Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Before reaching that point, he and some of his men, accompanied by Indian allies, ambushed a French scouting party. Its leader was killed, although the exact circumstances of his death were disputed. This peacetime <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>aggression</b> is seen {{as one of the first}} military steps leading to the global Seven Years' War. The French responded by attacking fortifications Washington erected following the ambush, forcing his surrender. Released on parole, Washington and his troops returned to Virginia.|$|E

Male {{dolphins}} engage in <b>acts</b> <b>of</b> <b>aggression</b> apparently {{for the same reasons}} as humans: disputes between companions and competition for females. <b>Acts</b> <b>of</b> <b>aggression</b> can become so intense that targeted dolphins sometimes go into exile after losing a fight.|$|R

5|$|The {{first serious}} combat {{involving}} the Swiss Air Force began in June 1940. In {{six days of}} aerial battles, eleven German aircraft were downed, {{with a loss of}} two Swiss aircraft and three airmen killed. Following these incidents, on 6June, the chief of the Luftwaffe, Hermann Göring, protested the attacks, claiming that most of the German planes had been in French airspace and that the Luftwaffe had entered Swiss airspace only by mistake. Germany demanded financial compensation and an apology by the Swiss government. In a second, more pointed demand on 19June, Germany stated that they viewed the air battles as a flagrant <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>aggression,</b> and if these interceptions continued, Switzerland would face sanctions and retaliation. The next day, General Henri Guisan ordered all Swiss units to stop engaging foreign aircraft, and on 1July 1940, the Federal Council apologized for possible border violations by Swiss pilots, without admitting any had occurred. On 16 July, the German government declared that the events were settled. Engaging aircraft of the combatant nations was prohibited until October 1943, when strategic bombing of Bavaria and Austria by the Allies became an increasing likelihood.|$|E

25|$|President Eisenhower did {{not want}} to fly American U-2 pilots over the Soviet Union because he felt that if one of these pilots were to be shot down or {{captured}} that it could be seen as an <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>aggression.</b> At a time like the Cold War, any <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>aggression</b> could spark open conflict between the two countries. In order to ease the burden of flying Americans into Soviet airspace the idea developed to have British pilots from the Royal Air Force fly these missions in place of the American Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). With the United Kingdom still reeling from the aftermath of the Suez Crisis and in no position to snub American requests, the British government was amenable to the proposal. Using British pilots allowed Eisenhower {{to be able to use}} the U-2 plane to see what the Soviet Union was hiding, while still being able to plausibly deny any affiliation if a mission became compromised.|$|E

40|$|The {{current study}} sought to {{understand}} if mortality salience and identification with the University of Kentucky men’s varsity basketball team (UK) would interact {{in such a way}} as to influence participants’ willingness to engage in anonymous <b>acts</b> <b>of</b> <b>aggression</b> toward fans, coaches and players of rival sport teams. A research question was also evaluated which asked if mortality salience might be a potential mediator between participants’ identification and their likelihood to engage in anonymous <b>acts</b> <b>of</b> <b>aggression.</b> Results indicated that mortality salience was not a significant predictor and there was no significant interaction between identification and mortality salience. As a result, subsequent mediation analysis also did not find mortality salience to be a mediator between identification and likelihood to engage in anonymous <b>acts</b> <b>of</b> <b>aggression.</b> Results did support previous research, which found identification to be a significant predictor <b>of</b> anonymous <b>aggression.</b> Participants who reported higher identification with UK were also more likely to report willingness to engage in anonymous aggression toward fans, players, and coaches of rival sport teams...|$|R

Some countries {{charged that the}} U.S. had committed an <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>aggression</b> by invading Panama {{and was trying to}} conceal a new manifestation of its interventionist policy of force in Latin America. On 29 December, the General Assembly of the United Nations voted 75–20, with 40 abstentions, to condemn the invasion as a flagrant violation of international law.|$|E

25|$|The U.S. doesn't always follow {{international}} law. For example, {{some critics}} assert the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq {{was not a}} proper response to an imminent threat, but an <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>aggression</b> which violated international law. For example, Benjamin Ferencz, a chief prosecutor of Nazi war crimes at Nuremberg said George W. Bush should be tried for war crimes along with Saddam Hussein for starting aggressive wars—Saddam for his 1990 attack on Kuwait and Bush for his 2003 invasion of Iraq.|$|E

The expedition was terminated, however, when Yanal Kusush suddenly attacked Musa and deserted to the Hamdanids. Nasir al-Dawla responded to this <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>aggression</b> by leading his army, which included a number of Turks, to Samarra the following month. Mu'izz al-Dawla similarly gathered his forces and departed from Baghdad with the caliph al-Muti' for Ukbara.|$|E
25|$|TCKs {{have the}} unique {{experience}} of being exposed to and living in cultures different from their home culture for extended periods of time. This {{has been found to}} affect their level of authoritarianism, both positively and negatively depending on the circumstance of the TCK. Authoritarianism measurements have been used by researchers on individuals, and high scores on the right-wing authoritarian scale (RWA) have been found to possess the following three personality characteristics: a tendency to submit themselves to authority figures, a willingness to commit an <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>aggression</b> for the sake of this authority or authorities, and possessing significant concern with acting according to the rules and norms of their group.|$|E
25|$|Further {{signs of}} {{infiltration}} were {{found by the}} lead section and as the scouts tracked the footprints of the militiamen through a dried creek bed they discovered some empty food packets and old cigarette butts, confirming the presence of militia in the area.

40|$|The Nuremberg Charter {{introduced}} the crime <b>of</b> <b>aggression</b> into international law. The American Chief Prosecutor Robert Jackson gave a famous promise that offenders who commit <b>acts</b> <b>of</b> <b>aggression</b> shall be prosecuted and {{international criminal law}} would be applied against them. Notwithstanding {{the efforts of the}} United Nations to criminalize aggression, in the period between the Nuremberg trial and the Kampala Conference in 2010 {{there has not been a}} universally accepted definition <b>of</b> <b>aggression.</b> Even though the Nuremberg Principles had been recognized and the Tokyo judgment followed the Nuremberg precedent, a universally accepted definition of the ‘supreme crime’ was missing for more than 60 years. One could argue that the Cold War was the main reason for the absence of international follow-up to the criminalization <b>of</b> <b>aggression</b> after 1947; or one may also say that the international community relied on the UN Charter provisions as a trustworthy bulwark against <b>acts</b> <b>of</b> <b>aggression.</b> The definition <b>of</b> ‘act of aggression’ from 1974 could not be labeled as ‘historic’ simply because in reality nothing truly changed. The international tribunals prior to the establishment of the International Criminal Court did not have the crime <b>of</b> <b>aggression</b> in their statutes. In this article the author describes the development of the ‘supreme crime’ specifically after the Nuremberg trial, with a focus on the UN efforts in dealing with <b>acts</b> <b>of</b> <b>aggression.</b> Individual responsibility for the crime <b>of</b> <b>aggression</b> as such is also examined in this ‘vacuum period’ where the international consensus was missing...|$|R

25|$|During German-Finnish negotiations, Finland {{had demanded}} to remain neutral unless the Soviet Union {{attacked}} them first. Germany therefore sought to provoke the Soviet Union into an <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>aggression</b> toward Finland. On 22 June, 1941, Germany launched Operation Barbarossa, invading the Soviet Union. German aircraft employed Finnish air bases, while also launching Operation Rentier, {{which resulted in}} the take-over of Petsamo at the Finnish-Soviet border. Simultaneously Finland proceeded to remilitarize the neutral Åland Islands. Despite these actions the Finnish government insisted via diplomatic channels to be still a neutral party, but the Soviet leadership already viewed Finland as an ally of Germany. On 22 June, the Murmansk Oblast entered a state of emergency, with a total of 50,000 mobilized into the army and navy. Conscripts and volunteers joined ranks of the newly formed , while sailors from the Northern Fleet entered the service of a marine infantry Brigade. A considerable number of civilians was also employed in the construction of four lines of fortifications, between Zapadnaya Litsa and Kola Bay. Subsequently, the Soviets proceeded to launch a massive air raid on 25 June, bombing all major Finnish cities and industrial centers including Helsinki, Turku and Lahti. During a night session at the same day the Finnish parliament decided to go to war against the Soviet Union. Operation Silver Fox could now commence.|$|E
