40|$|The {{performance}} of quantum well GaN/A 1 GaN {{light emitting diode}} (LED) is reviewed for three different barrier compositions; symmetric barrier composition with low A 1 content, asymmetric barrier composition with higher A 1 content on <b>p-type</b> <b>cladding</b> <b>layer</b> and lower <b>A</b> 1 content on n-type <b>clading</b> <b>layer,</b> and symmetric barrier composition with higher A 1 content. The study was conducted using ATLAS/BLAZE & LUMINOUS software developed by Silvaco International Inc. Integrated radiative recombination rate was studied on applied voltages up to 5 V. Results showed three phases of LED performance with different applied voltages and these were explained using badgap theory.

40|$|Most III-V nitride light {{emitting}} diodes have an n-type down structure with Ga polarity. In such a device, the active layer is grown {{on top of the}} n-cladding <b>layer</b> and the <b>p-type</b> <b>cladding</b> <b>layer</b> is grown on top of the active layer. We have analyzed the band structure of such a device and found a reduced effective conduction band barrier due to the positive spontaneous and piezoelectric polarization charge, resulting in large electron overshoot and necessitating the introduction of the commonly employed electron blocking layer. On the other hand, the polarization charge at the corresponding interface for <b>a</b> <b>p-type</b> down device with Ga polarity is negative, resulting in a significant enhancement of the electron barrier and the existence of a 2 D hole gas near the interface. These are beneficial to the performance of single heterojunction LEDs. We have fabricated and tested such a device with a peak efficiency above 100 A/cm 2 and only ~ 10 % droop up to 500 A/cm 2, which was achieved without the implementation of an AlGaN electron-blocking layer or a second hetero-interface. 1...|$|R

40|$|Long {{wavelength}} GaSb-based {{quantum well}} lasers have been optimized for high coupling efficiency into an optical system. Two approaches {{were used to}} reduce the vertical far-field. In the first approach we showed the use of V-shaped Weaker Waveguide in the n-cladding layer dramatically reduces vertical beam divergence without any performance degradation compared to a conventional broad-waveguide laser structure. Starting from a broad waveguide laser structure design which gives low threshold current and a large vertical far-field (VFF), the structure was modified to decrease the VFF while maintaining a low threshold-current density. In a first step {{the combination of a}} narrow optical waveguide and reduced refractive index step between the waveguide and the <b>cladding</b> <b>layers</b> reduce the VFF from 67 ? to 42 ?. The threshold current density was kept low to a value of ~ 190 A/cm 2 for 1000 × 100 µm 2 devices by careful adjustment of the doping profile in the <b>p-type</b> <b>cladding</b> <b>layer.</b> The insertion of a V-Shaped Weaker Waveguide in the n-cladding layer is shown to allow for further reduction of the VFF to a value as low as 35 ? for better light-coupling efficiency into an optical system without any degradation of the device performance. In the second approach, we showed that the use of a depressed cladding structure design also allows for the reduction of the VFF while maintaining low the threshold current density (210 A/cm 2), slightly higher value compare to the first design...|$|R

40|$|Using a top-contact window, we have {{observed}} emission from a direct-gap monitor layer {{placed at the}} interface between the p-cladding and contact layers of an AlGaInP laser diode when driven under forward bias, thereby providing direct evidence for minority carrier (electron) leakage in these devices. We have further shown that the leakage is due to both drift and diffusion and, using pulsed optical excitation of a device under bias, we have determined a value of 170 /spl plusmn/ 10 cm/sup 2 / V/sup - 1 / s/sup - 1 / for the mobility of minority carriers in the <b>p-type</b> <b>cladding</b> <b>layer</b> by <b>a</b> time-of-flight experiment. The data was analyzed using a simulation which takes account {{of the influence of}} recombination times in the well and monitor layer on the overall time response of the structure. The measured mobility corresponds to electron transport through the X-conduction band. We show that the drift component of the leakage current reduces the differential efficiency and is responsible for the decrease in external differential efficiency with increasing temperature. Because the leakage occurs by a mixture of drift and diffusion, the transit time does not decrease significantly with increasing drive current; however the impact of leakage on the modulation response is predicted to be very small unless the leakage becomes a substantial fraction of the total current...|$|R
