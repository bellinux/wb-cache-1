500|$|Electronic Arts often acquires new {{companies}} to expand or add to new product lines. For instance, EA {{chairman and chief}} executive officer Larry Probst said after the acquisition of JAMDAT Mobile that [...] "we intend to build a leading global position in the [...] business of providing games on mobile phones". EA followed through with this later, making the company into EA Mobile, and allowing people to purchase and download content produced by them directly onto their phones. After the <b>acquisition</b> <b>of</b> <b>Origin</b> Systems, some staff in that company claimed that Electronic Arts initially gave them more resources, but allowed little latitude if employees made a mistake, and in some cases no longer trusted them, and even worked against them. EA has shut down entire companies or the studios thereof after acquiring them, including [...] the studio DICE Canada, Origin Systems, EA Chicago (NuFX), and Pandemic Studios. Gaming blogger Brian Crecente has said that fears that EA doesn't care about the quality of their products after they are acquired are debatable.|$|E
5000|$|Computer Gaming World in September 1992 {{broke the}} news of Electronic Arts' <b>acquisition</b> <b>of</b> <b>Origin</b> Systems on Prodigy, before its next issue went to press. Online news {{websites}} began to proliferate in the 1990s. An early adopter was The News & Observer in Raleigh, North Carolina which offered online news as Nando. Steve Yelvington wrote on the Poynter Institute website about Nando, owned by The N&O, by saying [...] "Nando evolved into the first serious, professional news site on the World Wide Web". It originated in the early 1990s as [...] "NandO Land". It is believed that a major increase in digital online journalism occurred around this time when the first commercial web browsers, Netscape Navigator (1994), and Internet Explorer (1995). By 1996, most news outlets had an online presence. Although journalistic content was repurposed from original text/video/audio sources without change in substance, it could be consumed in different ways because of its online form through toolbars, topically grouped content, and intertextual links. A twenty-four-hour news cycle and new ways of user-journalist interaction web boards were among the features unique to the digital format. Later, portals such as AOL and Yahoo! and their news aggregators (sites that collect and categorize links from news sources) led to news agencies such as The Associated Press to supplying digitally suited content for aggregation beyond the limit of what client news providers could use in the past.|$|E
40|$|This is an {{analysis}} of California history of the shifting of language policies from Spanish to English, as an Official Language The focus is English as an imposed language that {{from the beginning of}} schooling policies stifle a process <b>of</b> language <b>acquisition</b> for the majority of Spanish speakers. In 1849 the California Constitution stipulated that all laws, regulations, and provisions be published in English and Spanish. Soon after in 1855 the use of Spanish for institutional purposes was prohibited by law. By 1879 provisions for native language use were abolished. California became the first English Only State in the union. In spite of historical policies that impose English as an Official Language, which limits the use of other languages in institutional settings, the <b>acquisition</b> <b>of</b> native <b>origin</b> languages, in a dialectical fashion, meld into the fabric of culture and expression.

40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. (Eng)) [...] University of the Witwatersrand, Faculty of Engineering, 1989. The classic {{approach}} {{to the construction of}} a mathematical model to simulate traffic movements in a dense road network, such as a Central Business District (CBD), includes the need to prepare a complete Origin - Destination (O-D) matrix of vehicle trips into and through the network. Subsequent steps in the model deal with the coding of the road network and the assignment of the 0 -D matrix onto the network. The <b>acquisition</b> <b>of</b> reliable <b>origin</b> - destination data to create the 0 -D matrix is very often a tedious and costly exercise The use of traffic count information as an alternative method of 0 -D data creation needs consideration. Using the Simulation and Assignment of Traffic in Urban Road Network (SATURN) suite of computer programs, the task of simulating the prevailing traffic conditions may be considerably facilitated and hence reducing the cost of a traffic study in a CBD area. The present project report deals with that particular issue {{in the context of a}} small CBD in South Africa. The results show that saving can be achieved in the data collection...|$|R

Correspondence analysis is used to determine the relation between education level, job position and legal situation of immigrants in Spain. The results indicate that immigrants are occupying non skilled tasks, even in the case of well educated immigrants. Furthermore, these immigrants have no options to increase their skills nor by experience (in the job) neither by theirself (attending a school), since the im-migration police only authorizes very short migration.

40|$|Infection-dependent {{replication}} assays {{have been}} used to identify numerous putative <b>origins</b> <b>of</b> baculovirus replication. However, plasmid DNA, when cotransfected into insect cells with Autographa californica multinucleocapsid nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV) DNA, replicates independently of any viral sequence in cis (11). Cotransfection of transfer plasmids and baculovirus DNA is a common procedure used in generating recombinant viruses and in measuring the level of gene expression in transient-expression assays. We have examined the fate of a series of vector plasmids in cotransfection experiments. The data reveal that these plasmids replicate following cotransfection and the replication of plasmid DNA is not due to <b>acquisition</b> <b>of</b> viral putative <b>origin</b> sequences. The conformation of plasmid DNA replicating in the cotransfected cells was analyzed and found to exist as high-molecular-weight concatemers. Ten to 25 % of the replicated plasmid DNA was integrated into multiple locations on the viral genome and was present in progeny virions following serial passage. Sequence analysis of plasmid-viral DNA junction sites revealed no homologous or conserved sequences in the proximity of the integration sites, suggesting that nonhomologous recombination was involved during the integration process. These data suggest that while a rolling-circle mechanism could be used for baculovirus DNA replication, recombination may also be involved in this process. Plasmid integration may generate large deletions of the viral genome, suggesting that the process of DNA replication in baculovirus may be prone to generation of defective genomes...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe Netherlands {{is known}} for its low methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) prevalence. Yet MRSA with no link to {{established}} Dutch risk factors for <b>acquisition,</b> MRSA <b>of</b> unknown <b>origin</b> (MUO), has now emerged and hampers early detection and control by active screening upon hospital admittance. We assessed the magnitude of the problem and determined the differences between MUO and MRSA <b>of</b> known <b>origin</b> (MKO) for CC 398 and non-CC 398. National MRSA Surveillance data (2008 - 2009) were analysed for epidemiological determinants and genotypic characteristics (Panton-Valentine leukocidin, spa). A quarter (24 %) of the 5545 MRSA isolates registered were MUO, i. e. not from defined risk groups. There are two genotypic MUO groups: CC 398 MUO (352; 26 %) and non-CC 398 MUO (998; 74 %). CC 398 MUO needs further investigation because it could suggest spread, not by direct contact with livestock (pigs, veal calves), but through the community. Non-CC 398 MUO is less likely to be from a nursing home than non-CC 398 MKO (relative risk 0. 55; 95 % CI 0. 42 - 0. 72) and Panton-Valentine leukocidin positivity was more frequent in non-CC 398 MUO than MKO (relative risk 1. 19; 95 % CI 1. 11 - 1. 29). Exact transmission routes and risk factors for non-CC 398 as CC 398 MUO remain undefined...|$|R
