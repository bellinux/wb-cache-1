5|$|<b>Adders</b> execute integer {{addition}} {{in electronic}} digital computers, usually using binary arithmetic. The simplest architecture is the ripple carry adder, which follows the standard multi-digit algorithm. One slight improvement is the carry skip design, again following human intuition; {{one does not}} perform all the carries in computing , but one bypasses the group of 9s and skips to the answer.|$|E

5|$|Salta, and the Moss in particular, {{is home to}} {{a variety}} of plant and animal life, {{including}} some rare specimens. <b>Adders,</b> Britain's only native venomous snake, are seen on the Moss, and prey upon small rodents, such as voles. Many wild bird species inhabit Salta and the surrounding area, including larger species such as pheasants, which are also bred locally for hunting.|$|E
5|$|The {{eggs and}} chicks of this ground-nesting bird are {{vulnerable}} to predation by red foxes, pine martens, European hedgehogs, least weasels and domestic dogs, and by birds including crows, Eurasian magpies, Eurasian jays and owls. Snakes, such as common <b>adders,</b> may also rob the nest. Adults may be caught by birds of prey including northern goshawks, hen harriers, Eurasian sparrowhawks, common buzzards, peregrine and sooty falcons.|$|E
5|$|<b>Adders</b> are {{not usually}} aggressive, tending to be rather timid and biting only when cornered or alarmed. People are {{generally}} bitten only after stepping on them or attempting to pick them up. They will usually disappear into the undergrowth at a hint of any danger, but will return once all is quiet, often to the same spot. Occasionally, individual snakes will reveal their presence with a loud and sustained hissing, hoping to warn off potential aggressors. Often, these {{turn out to be}} pregnant females. When the adder is threatened, the front part of the body is drawn into an S-shape to prepare for a strike.|$|E

25|$|The Viperidae differ much among {{themselves}} in the toxicity of their venom. Some, such as the Indian Russell's viper (Daboia russelli) and saw-scaled viper (Echis carinatus); the American rattlesnakes (Crotalus spp.), bushmasters (Lachesis spp.) and lanceheads (Bothrops spp.); and the African <b>adders</b> (Bitis spp.), night <b>adders</b> (Causus spp.), and horned vipers (Cerastes spp.), cause fatal results unless a remedy is speedily applied. The bite of the larger European vipers may be very dangerous, and followed by fatal results, especially in children, {{at least in the}} hotter parts of the Continent; whilst the small meadow viper (Vipera ursinii), which hardly ever bites unless roughly handled, {{does not seem to be}} possessed of a very virulent venom, and, although very common in some parts of Austria and Hungary, is not known to have ever caused a serious accident.|$|E
25|$|The {{effect of}} the venom of proteroglyphous snakes (sea snakes, kraits, mambas, black snakes, tiger snakes, death <b>adders)</b> is mainly on the nervous system, {{respiratory}} paralysis being quickly produced by bringing the venom {{into contact with the}} central nervous mechanism which controls respiration; the pain and local swelling which follow a bite are not usually severe.|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1998 Minimizing {{the dynamic}} power {{consumption}} of a circuit {{is becoming a}} more and more important issue for digital circuit design {{in the age of}} portable electronics. Among all the arithmetic circuits, addition is the most fundamental operation. Therefore, designing low power <b>adder</b> is an important and necessary research area. In this thesis, the dynamic switching power consumption of ripple carry <b>adder,</b> carry look ahead <b>adder,</b> carry skip <b>adder,</b> carry select <b>adder,</b> and prefix <b>adder</b> are discussed. The power factor, the sum of products of probability and fan-out of all internal nodes, is presented. This thesis also studies the power and time trade-off with efficiency index which is the product of power factor and worst case gate counts. The result shows that the carry look ahead <b>adder</b> has the lowest efficiency index in the design of a 64 bit <b>adder.</b> The carry skip <b>adder</b> is the best one in a design of a 16 and 32 bit <b>adder.</b> The ripple carry <b>adder</b> is the best choice for an 8 bit <b>adder.</b> This study also presents a low power prefix <b>adder</b> design which will reduce the power consumption of the prefix <b>adder</b> without lost of performance...|$|R

25|$|Most bites {{occur in}} {{industrial}} plantations, which attract {{many types of}} snake prey. Banana plantations are associated with vipers such as night <b>adders,</b> while rubber and palm tree plantations attract elapids, including cobras and black mambas. Important cobra species include the forest cobra and the black-necked spitting cobra. In forested areas of Guinea, cobras may inflict more than 30% of all venomous bites.|$|E
25|$|Aggressive {{encounters}} {{are potentially}} costly for individuals {{as they can}} get injured and be less able to reproduce. As a result, many species have evolved forms of ritualised combat to determine who wins access to a resource without having to undertake a dangerous fight. Male <b>adders</b> (Vipera berus) undertake complex ritualised confrontations when courting females. Generally, the larger male will win and fights rarely escalate to injury to either combatant.|$|E
25|$|The Causinae are a {{monotypic}} subfamily of venomous vipers {{found only}} in sub-Saharan Africa. It was created for the genus Causus, a group considered {{to be among the}} most primitive members of the family Viperidae based on head scalation, oviparity, venom apparatus, and because they have round pupils. However, this is contradicted by recent molecular studies. Six species are currently recognized. They are commonly known as night <b>adders.</b>|$|E

25|$|Several genera, {{including}} Asian coral snakes (Calliophis), burrowing asps (Atractaspis) {{and night}} <b>adders</b> (Causus), are remarkable for having exceptionally long venom glands, extending along {{each side of}} the body, in some cases extending posterially as far as the heart. Instead of the muscles of the temporal region serving to press out the venom into the duct, this action is performed by those of the side of the body.|$|E
25|$|The brown snakes, death <b>adders,</b> mulga snakes, taipans, and tiger snakes are {{the five}} groups that inflict {{virtually}} all reported snakebites, although copperheads, rough-scaled snakes, {{and members of}} the genus Hoplocephalus are also occasionally involved in bites. Of the five dangerous groups, the highly venomous eastern brown snake, which is widespread and common in both rural and urban environments, is the most important—it is estimated to be responsible for up to 60% of all deaths caused by snakebite.|$|E
25|$|The vast {{majority}} of venomous snakebites in Australasia occur in the Australasian ecozone. At least 300 evenomations occur each year in Papua New Guinea, 30 in the Solomon Islands, and 10 Vanuatu. The majority of bites in New Guinea are caused by the death <b>adders,</b> and a smaller number by the endemic small-eyed snake and other local species. Most of the Pacific Islands are free of terrestrial snakes, although sea snakes are common in coral reefs. In the Oceania ecozone, only Micronesia and Tonga, where at least 10 envenomations occur annually, face an appreciable burden of snakebite.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} a new {{self-checking}} fast ripple <b>adder</b> is presented. The <b>adder</b> implements the sum {{as well as}} the inverted sum and is totally self-checking with respect to all single stuck-at faults.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the design of}} a highly re-configurable <b>adder,</b> which has been optimized for speed and area. Since pass transistor based multiplexer is the fastest element in standard CMOS logic, we designed the <b>adder</b> using only multiplexers and 2 -input inverted logic gates. This <b>adder</b> is the hybrid of binary carry lookahead <b>adder</b> of Brent, and carry select <b>adder.</b> By using the hybrid approach, the area and wiring of the <b>adder</b> is reduced by 1 / 2, keeping the <b>adder</b> delay proportional to O (log n). The critical path of the 64 -bit partitioned <b>adder</b> consists of 7 two-to-one multiplexers and 1 XOR gate. The <b>adder</b> can be partitioned to support a variety of data formats, it can add two 64 -bit operands, four 32 -bit operands, eight 16 -bit operands, or sixteen 8 -bit operands. The <b>adder</b> can be used for multi-media applications, and is well suited for VLIW processors. The <b>adder</b> is described in Verilog, and synthesized using Synopsys tool.
