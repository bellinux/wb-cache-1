40|$|Can we {{determine}} a spin parameter of <b>a</b> black <b>hole</b> by observation of <b>a</b> black <b>hole</b> shadow in <b>an</b> accretion disk? In order {{to answer this}} question, we make a qualitative analysis and a quantitative analysis of a shape and a position of <b>a</b> black <b>hole</b> shadow casted by <b>a</b> rotating black <b>hole</b> on <b>an</b> optically thick accretion disk and its dependence on an angular momentum of <b>a</b> black <b>hole.</b> We have found black <b>hole</b> shadows with <b>a</b> quite similar size and a shape for largely different black hole spin parameters and <b>a</b> same black <b>hole</b> mass. Thus, it is practically difficult to {{determine a}} spin parameter of <b>a</b> black <b>hole</b> from <b>a</b> size and a shape of <b>a</b> black <b>hole</b> shadow in <b>an</b> accretion disk. We newly introduce a bisector axis of <b>a</b> black <b>hole</b> shadow named <b>a</b> shadow axis. For <b>a</b> rotating black <b>hole</b> <b>a</b> shape and a position of <b>a</b> black <b>hole</b> shadow are not symmetric {{with respect to a}} rotation axis of <b>a</b> black <b>hole</b> shadow. So, in this case the minimum interval between a mass center of <b>a</b> black <b>hole</b> and <b>a</b> shadow axis is finite. An extent of this minimum interval is roughly proportional to a spin parameter of <b>a</b> black <b>hole</b> for <b>a</b> fixed inclination angle between a rotation axis of <b>a</b> black <b>hole</b> and <b>a</b> direction of an observer. In order to measure a spin parameter of <b>a</b> black <b>hole,</b> if <b>a</b> shadow axis is determined observationally, it is crucially important to determine a position of a mass center of <b>a</b> black <b>hole</b> in <b>a</b> region of <b>a</b> black <b>hole</b> shadow.

40|$|Abstract—A “clean ” black <b>hole</b> is <b>a</b> black <b>hole</b> in vacuum {{such as the}} Schwarzschild black hole.

In this paper, the effect of matter fields on the black hole and the greybody factor is investigated. The results show that matter fields make <b>a</b> black <b>hole</b> smaller. They can increase the potential energy to <b>a</b> black <b>hole</b> to obstruct Hawking radiation to propagate.

What can one say about the interior of <b>a</b> black <b>hole?</b> The {{important point is that}} inside <b>a</b> black <b>hole</b> the space radial direction becomes time, and time becomes a space direction. The path into the gravitational abyss of the interior of <b>a</b> black <b>hole</b> is <b>a</b> progression in time. There is a peculiar region inside <b>a</b> black <b>hole</b> where some characteristics of the space-time curvature become singular. We call this region singularity. The colossal tidal gravitational forces near singularity modify physical laws. Space and time are not only strongly curved near the singularity, but they split into quanta. The fall into the singularity is unstoppable for a body inside <b>a</b> black <b>hole.</b> This paper also addresses the following questions: Can one see what happens inside <b>a</b> black <b>hole?</b> Can <b>a</b> falling observer cross the singularity without being crushed? Can new baby universes arise inside <b>a</b> black <b>hole?</b> An answer to all these questions is probably ``yes''. We give also a brief review of the modern black hole astrophysics.
