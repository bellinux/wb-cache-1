25|$|In {{electric}} power distribution, capacitors {{are used for}} power factor correction. Such capacitors often come as three capacitors connected as a three phase load. Usually, the values of these capacitors are given not in farads {{but rather as a}} reactive power in volt-amperes reactive (var). The purpose is to counteract inductive loading from devices like electric motors and transmission lines to make the load appear to be mostly resistive. Individual motor or lamp loads may have capacitors for power factor correction, or larger sets of capacitors (usually with <b>automatic</b> <b>switching</b> devices) may be installed at a load center within a building or in a large utility substation.|$|E

40|$|Electric Power {{reliability}} is a {{major concern}} of any utility company. Although the distribution system is getting advanced, reliable energy at a cheaper cost is still a big concern. Power utility companies are trying to provide reliable energy through many possible ways. One of the possible solutions is use of <b>automatic</b> <b>switches.</b> Power utility companies are using <b>automatic</b> <b>switch</b> called IntelliRupter® for automatic fault detection, isolation and service restoration. It has been the biggest achievement in improving reliability so far. However, such automation is very costly. It needs proper planning for installation of such devices so that the utility company can make the most benefit at optimal cost.
