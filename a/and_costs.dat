40|$|Nowadays, {{supply chain}} {{management}} (SCM) is considered {{as the key to}} win the business competition. It can bring many benefits for companies, such as waste elimination, increasing efficiency and customers‘ satisfaction. However, unnecessary waste still exists. In order to handle the issue better, {{a clear view of the}} sources of waste is required. Hence, the visibility of supply chain in terms of time <b>and</b> <b>cost</b> becomes more <b>and</b> more demanding. This research investigates the relevant issues of the fresh produce supply chain based on a case study in an international food company called Malaysian Agrifood Corporation Berhad (MAFC). It explores the issues of time <b>and</b> <b>cost</b> management within tomato supply chain over a three-month period. It examines all processes and stages of material and information flows along the Lushious tomato supply chain, aiming at highlighting the level of time <b>and</b> <b>cost</b> consumed by different processes across the supply chain and hence to unveil the waste areas. Based on these objectives, SCTCM (Supply Chain Time <b>and</b> <b>Cost</b> Mapping) is employed for supply chain analysis. This paper will demonstrate the application of SCTCM, which can lead to substantial time <b>and</b> <b>cost</b> savings. The results indicate that analyzing supply chains with time <b>and</b> <b>cost</b> tools simultaneously is fundamental for managers to make better decisions. This paper argues that better visibility of supply chain can be achieved through investigating supply chains with time <b>and</b> <b>cost</b> tools simultaneously. Analysis of time <b>and</b> <b>cost</b> consumed at each activity can provide some insights for managers to make better decisions...|$|R
