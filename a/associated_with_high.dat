The two main forms of damage are splitting, whereby a {{longitudinal}} crack develops during growth {{that can be a}} few centimetres to {{the entire length of the}} root, and breaking, which occurs postharvest.

5|$|Five {{medications}} {{have evidence}} for long-term use orlistat, lorcaserin, liraglutide, phentermine–topiramate, and naltrexone–bupropion. They result in weight loss {{after one year}} ranged from 3.0 to 6.7kg over placebo. Orlistat, liraglutide, and naltrexone–bupropion are available in both the United States and Europe, whereas lorcaserin and phentermine–topiramate are available only in the United States. European regulatory authorities rejected the latter two drugs {{in part because of}} associations of heart valve problems with lorcaserin and more general heart and blood vessel problems with phentermine–topiramate. Orlistat use is <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>high</b> rates of gastrointestinal side effects and concerns have been raised about negative effects on the kidneys. There is no information on how these drugs affect longer-term complications of obesity such as cardiovascular disease or death.|$|E
5|$|Like {{other animals}} {{at the highest}} trophic levels, the killer whale is {{particularly}} at risk of poisoning from bioaccumulation of toxins, including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). European harbor seals have problems in reproductive and immune functions <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>high</b> levels of PCBs and related contaminants, and a survey off the Washington coast found PCB levels in killer whales were higher than levels that had caused health problems in harbor seals. Blubber samples in the Norwegian Arctic show higher levels of PCBs, pesticides and brominated flame-retardants than in polar bears. When food is scarce, killer whales metabolize blubber for energy, which increases pollutant concentrations in their blood.|$|E

50|$|Some {{studies suggest}} that higher rates of gun {{ownership}} are <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>higher</b> homicide rates, although Gary Kleck argues that the highest-quality studies show that gun ownership does not increase homicide rates.

5|$|Nonpolar {{antioxidants}} such as eugenol—a {{major component}} of oil of cloves—have toxicity limits that can be exceeded with the misuse of undiluted essential oils. Toxicity <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>high</b> doses of water-soluble antioxidants such as ascorbic acid are less of a concern, as these compounds can be excreted rapidly in urine. More seriously, very high doses of some antioxidants may have harmful long-term effects. The beta-carotene and Retinol Efficacy Trial (CARET) study of lung cancer patients found that smokers given supplements containing beta-carotene and vitamin A had increased rates of lung cancer. Subsequent studies confirmed these adverse effects.|$|E
5|$|Rotaviruses infect {{the young}} of {{many species of}} animals {{and they are a}} major cause of {{diarrhoea}} in wild and reared animals worldwide. As a pathogen of livestock, notably in young calves and piglets, rotaviruses cause economic loss to farmers because of costs of treatment <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>high</b> morbidity and mortality rates. These rotaviruses are a potential reservoir for genetic exchange with human rotaviruses. There is evidence that animal rotaviruses can infect humans, either by direct transmission of the virus or by contributing one or several RNA segments to reassortants with human strains.|$|E
5|$|A UK Kennel Club survey {{puts the}} median {{lifespan}} of Miniature Schnauzers {{at a little}} over 12 years. About 20% lived to >15 years. While generally a healthy breed, Miniature Schnauzers may suffer health problems <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>high</b> fat levels. Such problems include hyperlipidemia, which may increase the possibility of pancreatitis, though either may form independently. Other issues which may affect this breed are diabetes, bladder stones and eye problems. Feeding the dog low- or non-fatty and unsweetened foods may help avoid these problems. Miniature Schnauzers are also prone to comedone syndrome, a condition that produces pus filled bumps, usually on their backs, {{which can be treated}} with a variety of methods. Miniature Schnauzers should have their ears dried after swimming due to a risk of infection, especially those with uncropped ears; ear examinations {{should be part of the}} regular annual check up. Miniature Schnauzers are also prone to von Willebrand disease (vWD). vWD in dogs is an inherited bleeding disorder that occurs due to qualitative or quantitative deficiency of von Willebrand factor (vWF), a multimeric protein that is required for platelet adhesion.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} the association between the quality of parent-child interaction and child outcomes. Specifically, global interactional synchrony, the individual synchrony components of mutual initiation and mutual compliance, and mother’s attitudes towards parenting (satisfaction with parenting, involvement, and communication) were examined as predictors of young children’s social skills and aggression. One hundred and thirty-one preschool-aged children (3 - 6 years) and their mothers engaged in a videotaped free play task and a structured task. These interactions were coded for global mother-child interactional synchrony and the individual synchrony components of mutual initiation and mutual compliance. The results revealed that higher levels of mother-child mutual initiation and mutual compliance were <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>higher</b> levels of interactional synchrony. Higher levels of interactional synchrony and mutual compliance were <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> lower levels of child physical aggression, whereas higher levels of mutual initiation were <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>higher</b> levels of child physical and relational aggression. Higher levels of interactional synchrony were <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>higher</b> ratings of child assertion skills. Higher self-report ratings of maternal involvement were <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> lower levels of child physical aggression. Higher ratings of satisfaction with parenting, parent-child involvement and communication were <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>higher</b> ratings of child social skills. Finally, ratings of communication were <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>higher</b> levels of interactional synchrony and higher ratings of satisfaction <b>with</b> parenting were <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>higher</b> levels of mutual initiation, whereas higher levels of satisfaction and involvement were <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> lower levels of mutual compliance.
