40|$|The dissociative {{adsorption}} {{of three}} carboxylic acids (acetic acid, propanoic <b>acid,</b> and <b>acrylic</b> <b>acid),</b> <b>allyl</b> alcohol, and allyl aldehyde on Si(100) 2 × 1 {{at room temperature}} has been investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and temperature programmed desorption (TPD), as well as density-functional theory (DFT) calculations. The C 1 s features obtained by XPS measurement for acetic acid, propanoic <b>acid,</b> and <b>acrylic</b> <b>acid</b> show that formation of bidentate carboxylate at a low exposure is followed by that of unidentate carboxylate at a higher exposure, with approximately equal population for both adstructures. The signatures of C 1 s features attributed to methyl (285. 7 eV), ethyl (285. 3 eV), ethenyl (285. 0 eV), and bidentate carboxyl (286. 8 eV) and unidentate carboxyl (289. 8 - 289. 3 eV) carbons were observed for the studied carboxylic acids. The {{results showed that the}} carboxyl group is more reactive than the alkyl or alkenyl group towards the Si(100) 2 × 1 surface, with O−H dissociation preferred over [2 + 2] C=C cycloaddition and the other plausible reaction products. This was also supported by our DFT calculation which showed that the bidentate carboxylate adstructure is the most stable configuration among the calculated adstructures for the aforementioned carboxylic acids. The combined temperature-dependent XPS and TPD studies provided strong evidence for the formation of ketene, acetaldehyde and CO from acetic acid, CO and ethylene from propanoic acid, and CO, ethylene, acetylene, and propene from <b>acrylic</b> <b>acid.</b> Furthermore, the TPD results provided further evidence for the preferred structure of the adsorbate from each of the carboxylic acid on the surface. In addition to carboxyl group, reactivity of the hydroxyl and carbonyl functional groups relative to that of ethenyl group was studied by investigating the reaction of allyl alcohol and allyl aldehyde on Si(100) 2 × 1 at room temperature. The C 1 s XPS results supported O−H dissociation for allyl alcohol and [2 + 2] C=O cycloaddition for allyl aldehyde over the [2 + 2] C=C cycloaddition. The similarity between the observed C 1 s features for allyl alcohol and allyl aldehyde helped to identify the structure of the adsorption products of these two molecules on the surface. The presence of the related C 1 s feature of C=C for allyl alcohol and allyl aldehyde, and the absence of C 1 s feature of C=O for allyl aldehyde provided strong evidence to support that [2 + 2] C=C cycloaddition does not occur in the presence of hydroxyl or carbonyl groups. Furthermore, by comparing the experimental results and the adsorption energies of the adstructures calculated by DFT, it was concluded that these molecules do not react with the Si dimers through both of their functional groups, while the reaction of only one of the two functional groups is preferred on the surface. Formation of ethylene, acetylene, and propene from allyl alcohol and allyl aldehyde, simultaneously to CO from allyl alcohol, was concluded from the corresponding TPD results, which also confirm the structure of the adsorbates on the surface. The present research shows that reactions involving oxygen-containing functional groups are favoured over the other plausible reactions including [2 + 2] C=C cycloaddition on the Si(100) 2 × 1. The preference of the surface to react with one of the two functional groups calls for future studies for the selective functionalization of Si(100) 2 × 1 with potential applications in molecular electronics...|$|R

5|$|The Carroll {{rearrangement}} is a rearrangement {{reaction in}} organic chemistry and involves {{the transformation of}} a β-keto <b>allyl</b> <b>ester</b> into a α-allyl-β-ketocarboxylic acid. This organic reaction is accompanied by decarboxylation and the final product is a γ,δ-allylketone. The Carroll rearrangement is an adaptation of the Claisen rearrangement and effectively a decarboxylative allylation.|$|R

The Panel considered that migration is not expected when the absorption capacity of the pads is not exceeded. Therefore no exposure from the consumption of the packed food is expected. The Panel also considered that none of these starting substances and the cross-linked polymer gives rise to concern for genotoxicity. Therefore the CEF Panel concluded that the use of the substance <b>acrylic</b> <b>acid,</b> sodium salt, co-polymer with <b>acrylic</b> <b>acid,</b> methyl ester, methacrylic acid, 2 hydroxypropylester, and <b>acrylic</b> <b>acid</b> cross-linked does not raise a safety concern when used as fibres in absorber pads for the packaging of fresh or frozen meat, poultry, fish, fruits and vegetables under conditions under which the absorption capacity of the pads is not exceeded and mechanical release of the fibres from the pads is excluded...|$|R
40|$|For {{the study}} of {{biological}} phenomena influenced by the R- and N-Ras proteins, characteristic peptides which embody the correct lipid modifications of their parent proteins (palmitoyl thioesters, geranylgeranyl thioethers, and farnesyl thioethers), as well as analogues thereof, may serve as efficient tools. For the construction of such acid- and base labile peptide conjugates the <b>allyl</b> <b>ester</b> was developed as C-terminal protecting group. <b>Allyl</b> <b>esters</b> are cleaved selectively and in high yields from lipidated peptides by Pd(0) -mediated allyl transfer to accepting N- or C-nucleophiles like morpholine and N,N-dimethylbarbituric acid. This protecting group technique formed the key step in the synthesis of the characteristic S-palmitoylated and S-isoprenylated C-terminus of human R-Ras and human N-Ras proteins, {{as well as several}} analogues thereof. Deprotections are so mild that no undesired side reactions of the lipid conjugates are observed. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

30|$|The {{chemical}} companies BASF and Cargill and industrial biotechnology company Novozymes are developing bio-based technologies to produce <b>acrylic</b> <b>acid</b> from renewable feedstocks. Currently, <b>acrylic</b> <b>acid</b> {{is produced by}} the oxidation of propylene derived from the refining of crude oil. Using biotechnology route, these companies have worked to develop microorganisms that can efficiently convert renewable feedstock, among them are glycerol, into 3 -hydroxypropionic acid, which is one possible chemical precursor to <b>acrylic</b> <b>acid</b> [48]. The companies have carried out this precursor production in pilot scale, but they intend to increase for commercial scale still in 2014.|$|R
