5|$|Davies <b>also</b> <b>notes</b> two {{flaws in}} Rhys's achievement. One was the {{personal}} {{nature of his}} accord with Henry II, which meant {{that it did not}} survive Henry's death. The other was his inability to control his sons and to force the other sons to accept Gruffydd as his successor.|$|E
5|$|As of 2012, Lycoming County has 52 {{incorporated}} municipalities: 1 city, 9 boroughs, and 42 townships. Lycoming County's townships include 1 census-designated place (CDP) and 50 villages. CDPs are {{geographical areas}} {{designated by the}} U.S. Census Bureau {{for the purposes of}} compiling demographic data. Villages are marked with signs by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation. Neither CDPs nor villages are actual jurisdictions under Pennsylvania law and their territory is legally part of the township(s) where they are located. The first list <b>also</b> <b>notes</b> the CDP and villages within their respective townships.|$|E
5|$|Egyptologist and {{archaeology}} pioneer Sir Flinders Petrie {{surveyed the}} Giant, probably during the First World War, and published his {{results in a}} Royal Anthropological Institute paper in 1926. Petrie says that he made 220 measurements, and records slight grooves across the neck, and from the shoulders down to the armpits. He <b>also</b> <b>notes</b> a row of pits suggesting {{the place of the}} spine. He concludes that the Giant {{is very different from the}} Long Man of Wilmington, and that minor grooves may have been added from having been repeatedly cleaned.|$|E

5000|$|Rob Kemp of Den of Geek gave a good overall review {{stating that}} the acting was good and that [...] "Nichols has the {{charisma}} to be a show carrier" [...] but <b>also</b> <b>noted</b> that the supporting cast were bland but hoped for further development. He <b>also</b> <b>noted</b> that while {{the focus on the}} futuristic technology, although he <b>also</b> <b>noted</b> that [...] "the climatic shoot-out does hint that the suit will become a deus ex machina in the writers’ arsenal." ...|$|R
5|$|Eric Oey of the University of California, Berkeley, {{writes that}} the novel's mysticism builds into a {{promotion}} of theosophy and Buddhist ideals: Aij Tjeng and Gwat Nio read about both, then leave their materialistic lives to become more spiritual. Ultimately, he writes, the concept of reincarnation is put forth when Roosminah is discovered soon after Lily's death. Faruk of Gadjah Mada University <b>also</b> <b>notes</b> the novel's concept of reincarnation, drawing on its repeated emphasis on the parallels (both physical and psychological) between the half-sisters Marsiti and Gwat Nio, as well as Lily and Roosminah.|$|E
5|$|Heinrich <b>also</b> <b>notes</b> the {{possibility}} that national parliaments could appoint citizen representatives to the UNPA, similarly to how the U.S. Electoral College officially selects the President. This would be a stopgap solution until direct election became possible. Yet it would still ensure that citizens would be electing citizens (albeit indirectly), rather than the executive appointing officials, to the UNPA.|$|E
5|$|Juenger <b>also</b> <b>notes</b> that SpongeBob {{could affect}} the ratings of other Nickelodeon {{programming}} because children often change channels to find their favorite program, then stay tuned into that network. Nickelodeon recently reduced its exposure in television. In {{the first quarter of}} 2012, the network cut back on the number of episodes it aired by 16% compared with a year earlier.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{afterwards}} Seaxburh {{moved to}} the double monastery at Ely, which was the precursor to Ely Cathedral, and where her sister Æthelthryth was abbess. The historian Barbara Yorke mentions the possibility that Seaxburh and her namesake Seaxburh of Wessex were the same person, but <b>also</b> <b>notes</b> that the accounts of Seaxburh's religious life at Ely contradict this suggestion.|$|E
5|$|Siregar {{described}} Kartodikromo as {{the first}} Indonesian writer to openly criticise the Dutch colonial government and the traditional form of feudalism practised in the country; he <b>also</b> <b>notes</b> that the writer w{{as the first}} Indonesian to consciously depict class struggles in his works. As Siregar considered Indonesian literature {{to have been born}} from a nationalist understanding, he considered Marco one of the first truly Indonesian writers.|$|E
5|$|The Natural History is {{generally}} divided into the organic {{plants and animals}} and the inorganic matter, although there are frequent digressions in each section. The encyclopedia <b>also</b> <b>notes</b> the uses made {{of all of these}} by the Romans. Its description of metals and minerals is valued for its detail in the history of science, being the most extensive compilation still available from the ancient world.|$|E

5|$|A modern {{review was}} given by University of York Professor Judith Buchanan. Buchanan recognizes that the film's acting was commended for its action and {{highlights}} the acting of the fool, placed prominently in the foreground, and says that {{it seems as if}} he has been imported from King Lear. This fool serves as an exaggerated proxy for the audience and filters a set of responses for the audience and goes on to steal the reunion scene with his expressions. Buchanan says that adapting the Shakespeare play to the one reel format required foreknowledge of the subject for audiences to intelligibly follow the subject. Buchanan <b>also</b> <b>notes</b> that this transitional period included lecturers who were hired to give supplementary lectures or commentary on the film being exhibited and the additional commentary for Shakespeare adaptations was desirable.|$|E
5|$|According to {{contemporary}} Frankish scholar and courtier Einhard, Eric was killed at Trsat (Tarsatch), a {{town on the}} coast of Liburnia by the treachery of the inhabitants. Due to a lack of primary materials, it is uncertain who killed Duke Eric. Most of historians point at Croats, while some point at Byzantines. Einhard <b>also</b> <b>notes</b> the death of Gerold, Prefect of Bavaria, another Frankish commander who was slain in Pannonia in the same year. Croatian historian Nenad Labus refers to this event as a successful assassination attempt by Avars and Slavs. Historian Pierre Riché believes that Dalmatian Croats (Guduscani) killed Eric in collusion with Avars.|$|E
5|$|Greb (Alex Diakun) {{shares his}} tale, of a {{television}} censor called Waylon Figgleif. Figgleif's overzealous approach to censorship leads Greb to try pushing his limits. Greb assumed {{the form of a}} small demonic baby and reveals himself to Figgleif, who breaks down and starts attempting to censor everyday life. Greb repeats this trick, and encourages Figgleif to go on a killing spree—Figgleif takes a gun, bursts onto the taping of a science-fiction show about alien abduction, and kills several actors. Greb's methods and effectiveness are dismissed until he reveals the story's epigram. Figgleif's spree was caught on camera, and broadcast by another network as a found footage special. However, Greb <b>also</b> <b>notes</b> that he too was spotted by Black during this.|$|E

5|$|Jack Finegan noted {{some early}} writers' {{reckoning}} of the regnal years of Augustus are the equivalent to 3/2 BC, or 2 BC or later {{for the birth}} of Jesus, including Irenaeus (3/2 BC), Clement of Alexandria (3/2 BC), Tertullian (3/2 BC), Julius Africanus (3/2 BC), Hippolytus of Rome (3/2 BC), Hippolytus of Thebes (3/2 BC), Origen (3/2 BC), Eusebius of Caesarea (3/2 BC), Epiphanius of Salamis (3/2 BC), Cassiodorus Senator (3 BC), Paulus Orosius (2 BC), Dionysus Exiguus (1 BC), and Chronographer of the Year 354 (AD 1). Finegan places the death of Herod in 1 BC, and says if Jesus was born two years or less before Herod the Great died, the birth of Jesus would have been in 3 or 2 BC. Finegan <b>also</b> <b>notes</b> the Alogi reckoned Christ's birth with the equivalent of 4 BC or AD 9.|$|E
5|$|Krohn's {{research}} <b>also</b> <b>notes</b> that Hitchcock {{shot the}} scene with two cameras: one a BNC Mitchell, the other a handheld French Éclair camera which Orson Welles had used in Touch of Evil (1958). In order to create an ideal montage for the greatest emotional impact on the audience, Hitchcock shot a lot of footage of this scene which he trimmed down in the editing room. He even brought a Moviola on the set to gauge the footage required. The final sequence, which his editor George Tomasini worked on with Hitchcock's advice, however did not go far beyond the basic structural elements set up by Bass' storyboards.|$|E
5|$|Maier {{writes that}} the novel {{includes}} themes of love, with Hidjo's love for Woengoe, Betje, and Biroe paralleling that of Walter's love for Roos, Woengoe, and Betje. He <b>also</b> <b>notes</b> {{that there is a}} theme of social mobility, where Hidjo's relationships with noble women are fostered by his merchant father to grant the family a greater social position; bride prices also feature prominently, showing that one can become a noble through marriage if one has enough money. He notes that, {{towards the end of the}} novel, love is described as something only those with a Dutch education would attempt to find, as the social-financial meaning of marriage remains predominant among the traditional Javanese. The characters, despite not all marrying for love, are happy with their eventual partners and have a comfortable life.|$|E

5|$|Stefan Kieniewicz, {{in a more}} {{critical}} treatment in the Polish Biographical Dictionary, notes {{that a lot of}} her exploits are poorly documented, and it is not always possible to separate legend from facts. He notes it is not certain she ever commanded any unit, and that her role as the commander of the 25th Regiment was more honorary than real; he <b>also</b> <b>notes</b> that she is known to have fainted on the battlefield, distracting her comrades, and in at least one instance (at the battle of Šiauliai), she was purposefully held behind front lines, as her comrades tried to ensure she would not endanger herself.|$|E
5|$|The {{concept of}} motive is also explored. When confronting Padgett, Mulder asks {{him why he}} is murdering his victims. Padgett, in turn, admits that he cannot answer the question. Kaner {{suggests}} that Padgett is representative of a version of Mulder, {{and that there is}} a direct parallel between being a criminal profiler—who must think like the criminal—and a writer—who must think like his characters. In the end, however, Padgett sacrifices his personal quest—his manuscript—in order to be free. This presents a distinct contrast to Mulder, who will never truly give up his obsession. Michelle Bush, in her book Myth-X, <b>also</b> <b>notes</b> that the episode sheds light on Scully's motive throughout the series: she wants to gain Mulder's attention, something she feels she does not have. Padgett eventually realizes this, and sacrifices himself for her love.|$|E
5|$|The film's {{cast and}} credits were {{unbilled}} {{and very few}} details emerged, but the film has been claimed to have featured Lon Chaney by two scholars. Jon Mirsalis states that Lon Chaney has an unbilled part as a pawnbroker. Michael Blake <b>also</b> <b>notes</b> that Lon Chaney {{had a role in}} the film, but Blake also states that the film had only one reel and lists the production code as 0119. Blake's claim that it was a single reel is the subject of dispute because the release was originally as a two reel production in publications and many advertisements for the film.|$|E
