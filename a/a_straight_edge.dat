5|$|The {{rivalry between}} Rey Mysterio and CM Punk was {{continued}} from several previous pay-per-views. After months of feuding, Mysterio challenged Punk to <b>a</b> <b>Straight</b> <b>Edge</b> Society Pledge vs. Hair match at Over the Limit. Had Punk won, Mysterio would {{have joined the}} Straight Edge Society, Punk's faction which promoted the straight edge lifestyle. Had Mysterio won however, Punk agreed to have his head shaved. On May 14, Mysterio and Punk faced {{each other in a}} singles match, but the Straight Edge Society (Luke Gallows, Serena, and a mystery masked man) interfered and attacked Mysterio. The following week, Mysterio interrupted an initiation ceremony, in which Punk was shaving the heads of three men to induct them into the Straight Edge Society, and mocked Punk, claiming everyone would be laughing at Punk when he was shaved bald at Over the Limit. Later that night, Mysterio teamed with Montel Vontavious Porter to defeat Punk and Gallows in a tag team match.|$|E
5|$|The third {{match on}} the card was <b>a</b> <b>Straight</b> <b>Edge</b> Society pledge vs. hair match, between CM Punk and Rey Mysterio. For this match, the other Straight Edge Society members (Serena and Luke Gallows) were banned from ringside. Early on in the match, Punk threw Mysterio headfirst {{out of the ring}} into the barber chair at ringside. Punk had {{suffered}} a cut to the head prior to the exchange, and while Mysterio was on the floor, the match was halted so that the blood could be cleaned up. While Punk's wound was being attended, he dropkicked Mysterio, who was on the ring apron, and began attacking him on the floor to restart the match. After Mysterio missed a splash from the top rope, Punk went to pin him, but Mysterio was able to perform a crucifix cradle on Punk for the victory. The other Straight Edge Society members attacked Mysterio after the match, but he was saved by Kane, which allowed Mysterio to handcuff Punk to the ring ropes and shave his head.|$|E

50|$|The C.21's {{fuselage}} {{was almost}} flat sided, with a vertical knife edge at the short nose. It had an open cockpit {{starting in the}} extreme nose and seating the three passengers in tandem; the pilot's cockpit was under the trailing edge, with a deep cut-out for better upward vision. At the rear <b>a</b> <b>straight</b> <b>edged,</b> long and low fin carried <b>a</b> <b>straight</b> <b>edged,</b> balanced rudder that extended down to the keel. An angled tailplane mounted {{on top of the}} fuselage had elevators with a cut-out for rudder movement and it had a tailskid undercarriage, with pairs of mainwheels on axles attached to longitudinal bars fixed under the engines on N-form struts.|$|R
25|$|Pinking shears are {{a type of}} {{scissors}} that have blades of which are sawtoothed instead of straight. Used to cut woven cloth, pinking shears leave a zigzag pattern instead of <b>a</b> <b>straight</b> <b>edge.</b> The earliest patent for pinking shears was U.S. patent #489,406 which was issued to Louise Austin of Whatcomb, Washington on January 3, 1893.|$|E
25|$|The {{baseplate}} (sole plate) {{is generally}} circular (though this, too, varies by individual models) {{and may be}} used in conjunction with a fence attached to the base, which then braces the router against the edge of the work, or via a straight-edge clamped across the work to obtain a straight cut. Other means of guiding the machine include the template guide bushing secured in the base around the router cutter, or router cutters with built-in guide bearings. Both of these run against <b>a</b> <b>straight</b> <b>edge</b> or shaped template. Without this, the varying reaction of the wood against the torque of the tool makes it impossible to control with the precision normally required.|$|E
25|$|Attached to {{the nave}} are {{the north and}} south aisles. The north aisle {{contains}} at its east two 19th-century windows of three lights set within <b>a</b> <b>straight</b> <b>edge</b> openings under gabled hood moulds. Tracery is of 15th-century panel style, with a central quatrefoil rosette inset, and reflects a true 15th-century window at the west wall. North aisle windows are clear glazed within diagonal muntins. A single step angled buttress supports the aisle north-east corner. To the west of the aisle north windows and above the east of the porch is the aisle roof’s single gargoyle-headed drain. The gabled porch at the west of the windows is 13th-century, its doorway with a pointed chamfered arch from the spring of part octagonal responds—half-piers attached to walls supporting an arch—with octagonal capitals. Attached to the responds to the height of the capitals is a cast iron double-gate. The porch interior contains a stone bench each side, and an inner doorway with 14th-century three-mould arch and hood mould with label stops. The panelled porch door has metal-studded deep stiles and rails, the panels with intermediate and arch-headed mullions.|$|E
50|$|The Toucan's wing is <b>straight</b> <b>edged,</b> of {{constant}} chord and square tipped, set {{low on the}} fuselage. There is some dihedral outboard of a brief centre section. From the wing roots two slender beams extend rearwards to cropped triangular fins, linked by <b>a</b> <b>straight</b> <b>edged</b> tailplane at about one third fin height. The unbalanced rudders are rectangular.|$|R

They sat side-by side ahead of the leading edge under a multi-part glazed canopy which ended, slightly raised above the upper fuselage line, over the wing. The empennage was conventional, with <b>a</b> <b>straight</b> <b>edged</b> tailplane mounted {{on top of the}} fuselage and carrying <b>straight</b> <b>edged,</b> rounded tipped and balanced elevators. <b>A</b> small, <b>straight</b> <b>edged</b> fin {{at the rear of the}} tailplane carried a balanced, rounded rudder which reached down to the keel and worked within an elevator cut-out.|$|R

2500|$|Apart {{from their}} engines, the de Havilland DH.42 Dormouse and DH.42A Dingo I {{were very similar}} aircraft. The Dormouse was built to Air Ministry {{specification}} 22/22 as a two-seat reconnaissance fighter and the Dingo to Specification 8/24 for army cooperation. They were two-bay biplanes with unswept wings of constant chord, though the lower wing was slightly smaller in span and only about 73% of the chord {{when compared to the}} upper one. [...] The two trailing edges were in line and the trailing struts vertical, but the forward struts were forward-raked. Both wings carried unbalanced ailerons. The vertical tail had the characteristic DH shape, with a balanced rudder; the elevators were unbalanced. [...] The structure throughout was wood, with fabric covering on the wings and empennage, but with de Havilland's usual thin plywood cover on the fuselage. [...] There was a single axle undercarriage, with the main legs attached to the lower wing root and with bracing to the forward fuselage. [...] The pilot's cockpit was under the upper wing centre section and the gunner sat close behind at the trailing edge. [...] In the Dormouse, the pilot had an oval cutout in the wing for upward vision and the gunner a V-shaped notch in the trailing edge to ease his field of fire. [...] In the Dingo, the pilot's cutout was made smaller and circular, whilst the gunner's notch was increased to fuselage width and deepened to the rear wing spar, giving it <b>a</b> <b>straight</b> <b>edge.</b>|$|E

6000|$|... 'And at last Jim looked astern {{where the}} other pointed with maniacal insistence. He saw a silent black squall which had eaten up already one-third of the sky. You know how these squalls come up there about {{that time of the}} year. First you see a darkening of the horizon--no more; then a cloud rises opaque like a wall. <b>A</b> <b>straight</b> <b>edge</b> of vapour lined with sickly whitish gleams flies up from the southwest, {{swallowing}} the stars in whole constellations; its shadow flies over the waters, and confounds sea and sky into one abyss of obscurity. And all is still. No thunder, no wind, no sound; not a flicker of lightning. Then in the tenebrous immensity a livid arch appears; a swell or two like undulations of the very darkness run past, and suddenly, wind and rain strike together with a peculiar impetuosity as if they had burst through something solid. Such a cloud had come up while they weren't looking. They had just noticed it, and were perfectly justified in surmising that if in absolute stillness there was some chance for the ship to keep afloat a few minutes longer, the least disturbance of the sea would make an end of her instantly. Her first nod to the swell that precedes the burst of such a squall would be also her last, would become a plunge, would, so to speak, be prolonged into a long dive, down, down to the bottom. Hence these new capers of their fright, these new antics in which they displayed their extreme aversion to die.|$|E

6000|$|... "Very {{likely it}} was sawn, Bertie; They {{could have had}} no tools that would cut a hard stone like this regularly, but as they were {{certainly}} clever builders they must have employed some means to do it. Possibly they used a saw without teeth, for however much they might have hardened the copper, the teeth could not have stood, but {{if they had a}} hard copper band fixed like the saw some masons use, and kept the stone moistened with fine sand, they might have cut into it. Of course {{it would have been a}} slow process; but they would not have needed to go far into the stone, for when they got down two or three inches they might have broken it through by dropping a heavy weight on the end. It would not have mattered if the fracture had not been straight below the cut, for only on the surface would they have wanted to fit accurately to the next stone. In another way they might have got <b>a</b> <b>straight</b> <b>edge,</b> that is, by driving very dry wedges into the cut made by the saw, and then moistening them. I know that great stones can be split in that way. They may have used both methods. However, it doesn't matter to us much how they did it. It is clear that they could in some way or other cut stones. As they took the trouble to do so here, we may conclude that they were anxious to have a smooth floor that would be extremely difficult to get up.|$|E

50|$|Like the wing, the {{rectangular}} section fuselage had a wooden frame and was ply covered.
