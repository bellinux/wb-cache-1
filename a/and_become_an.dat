5|$|The 1995 Quebec {{referendum}} was {{the second}} referendum to ask voters in the Canadian French-speaking province of Quebec whether Quebec should proclaim national sovereignty <b>and</b> <b>become</b> <b>an</b> independent country, with the condition precedent of offering a political and economic agreement to Canada.|$|E
5|$|As the two grew older, {{the letters}} became fewer and farther between. There {{was also a}} great deal that they kept to themselves. Jefferson said nothing about his {{construction}} of a new house, domestic turmoil, slave ownership, or poor financial situation, while Adams did not mention the troublesome behavior of his son Thomas, who had failed as a lawyer <b>and</b> <b>become</b> <b>an</b> alcoholic, resorting afterwards to living primarily as a caretaker at Peacefield.|$|E
50|$|Ferguson {{graduated}} from Columbia University in 1795, studied law, <b>and</b> <b>became</b> <b>an</b> attorney. He {{was active in}} politics as <b>a</b> Democratic-Republican, <b>and</b> <b>became</b> <b>a</b> political opponent of Dewitt Clinton.|$|R

5|$|Despite {{its small}} size, the least weasel is a fierce hunter, capable {{of killing a}} rabbit five to ten times its own weight. Although they are {{commonly}} taken, the rabbits are usually young specimens, <b>and</b> <b>become</b> <b>an</b> important food source during the spring, when small rodents are scarce and rabbit kits are plentiful. Male least weasels take {{a higher proportion of}} rabbits than females, as well as an overall greater variety of prey. This is linked to the fact that being larger, and having vaster territorial ranges than females, males have more opportunities to hunt a greater diversity of prey.|$|E
5|$|He was {{appointed}} Lucasian Professor of Mathematics in 1669 on Barrow's recommendation. During that time, any Fellow {{of a college}} at Cambridge or Oxford was required to take holy orders <b>and</b> <b>become</b> <b>an</b> ordained Anglican priest. However, {{the terms of the}} Lucasian professorship required that the holder not be active in the church (presumably so as to have more time for science). Newton argued that this should exempt him from the ordination requirement, and Charles II, whose permission was needed, accepted this argument. Thus a conflict between Newton's religious views and Anglican orthodoxy was averted.|$|E
5|$|His job was {{to prepare}} staff studies on {{upcoming}} potential operations. While he did do naval planning, his team prepared plans that coordinated land, air and sea operations. A staff study might be put into effect <b>and</b> <b>become</b> <b>an</b> operation, or MacArthur might shelve it {{in favor of an}} alternative operation, especially if the staff study revealed that it would be too time-consuming, difficult or costly. The three teams would work simultaneously on three different objectives in leapfrog fashion. Tarbuck routinely attended staff conferences that involved naval matters.|$|E

5|$|Rubin was {{inspired}} to pursue an undergraduate education at the currently all-women's school, Vassar College, because Maria Mitchell had been a professor there. She also ignored advice she had received from a high school science teacher to avoid a scientific career <b>and</b> <b>become</b> <b>an</b> artist. She earned her bachelor's degree in astronomy in 1948, the only graduate in astronomy that year. She attempted to enroll in a graduate program at Princeton, but was barred due to her gender. Princeton would not accept women as astronomy graduate students for 27 more years. Rubin also turned down an offer from Harvard University due to her husband, Robert Rubin's, position {{as a graduate student}} at Cornell University.|$|E
5|$|The Public Faroese Health School (Faroese: Heilsuskúli Føroya) in Suðuroy is a {{vocational}} school offering {{two types of}} education. The health care assistant education (Heilsuhjálpari) takes fifteen months. Following graduation, pupils can choose to leave the school and work in home care and retirement homes. Alternatively they can continue with another 22 months <b>and</b> <b>become</b> <b>an</b> assistant nurse (heilsurøktari). The assistant nurse can work in various places, mostly in retirement homes or hospitals. The graduates from the Health School are mainly women. In 2012 almost 90% of the School's graduates were women.|$|E
5|$|The {{highway is}} four lanes through Saskatchewan from the Alberta {{boundary}} to {{just west of}} Floral; {{the rest of the}} road is two lanes, but plans exist to twin the route and gain expressway status.

5|$|After {{covering}} up a murder that occurred at The Crazy Horse, Adriana is arrested and pressured by the FBI {{to wear a}} wire to avoid being charged as an accomplice. She refuses to wear a wire and informs the FBI that she {{may be able to}} persuade her fiancé Christopher to co-operate <b>and</b> <b>become</b> <b>an</b> informant against Tony. She confesses to Christopher that she has been informing and that the FBI would give them new identities if they would testify. Christopher is grief-stricken and nearly kills her. He leaves the apartment, saying he needs time to think. Tony has Silvio pick up Adriana under the pretense of taking her to see Christopher, but instead drives her out to the woods and executes her. Adriana’s betrayal and subsequent execution is too much for Christopher to handle and he briefly returns to drug abuse to deal with the pain.|$|E
5|$|Despite the honours and {{financial}} security she enjoyed, Catherine was preoccupied with reuniting with her children. Intent on finding {{a proxy for}} negotiations with the Sublime Porte, as well as obtaining resources for their release, she turned to Ludovico III Gonzaga, Marquis of Mantua, on 23 July 1470. On 11 February 1474, she addressed {{a letter to the}} Duke of Milan, Galeazzo Maria Sforza, asking him to help her reach the Ottoman border and enter negotiations. Sforza obliged. In the summer of 1474, the Queen was in Novi, a city in her family's possession. She was accompanied by her brother Vlatko's wife, Margarita Marzano, and probably wanted Vlatko's help in establishing contact with their younger half-brother, Hersekzade Ahmed Pasha, who had converted to Islam <b>and</b> <b>become</b> <b>an</b> Ottoman statesman. Whether she succeeded in that endeavor is not clear, but in any case she failed to reunite with either of her children. They both followed in their uncle's footsteps, becoming Muslims and, in Sigismund's case, also attaining high-ranking posts in the Ottoman Empire.|$|E
5|$|In 1913, Stevens {{arrived in}} Washington {{to take part}} in the June {{picketing}} of the Senate. She did not plan to stay, but Alice Paul convinced her to do so. She was hired by the NAWSA, and was assigned to the newly formed Congressional Union for Woman Suffrage (CUWS), which had been created by Alice Paul and Mary Ritter Beard. At that time, the Congressional Union was a subdivision of the NAWSA, though it operated independently. Stevens was hired to serve as executive secretary in Washington, D. C., as well as serve as regional organizer and was assigned the eastern district. Paul had divided the nation into quadrants of twelve states each and assigned Stevens to the eastern area, Mabel Vernon to the middle west, Anne Martin to the far west, and Maud Younger to the south. The regional organizers were tasked with educating groups about the suffrage bills that were in Congress and garnering support from each state for ratifying national suffrage. Rather than follow the previous strategy of achieving enfranchisement on a state-by-state basis, the Congressional Union Strategy was full federal approval. This issue, caused a rift in the suffrage movement at the 1913 Convention, causing Paul and her supporters to break ties with the NAWSA <b>and</b> <b>become</b> <b>an</b> independent organization.|$|E

5|$|Rotblat {{returned}} to Britain to become senior lecturer and {{acting director of}} research in nuclear physics at the University of Liverpool. Most of his family had survived the war. With {{the help of a}} Polish man, his brother-in-law Mieczysław (Mietek) Pokorny had created false Polish Catholic identities for Rotblat's sister Ewa and niece Halina. Ewa, taking advantage {{of the fact that she}} was an ash blonde who, like Rotblat, spoke fluent Polish as well as Yiddish, smuggled the rest of the family out of the Warsaw Ghetto. Mietek, Rotblat's brother Mordecai (Michael) and Michael's wife Manya, Rotblat's mother Scheindel, and two Russian soldiers lived in a concealed bunker underneath a house near Otwock, in which Ewa and Halina lived with a Polish family. Displays of Polish anti-Semitism that she witnessed during the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising embittered Ewa towards Poland, and she petitioned Rotblat to help the family emigrate to England. He therefore now accepted Chadwick's offer of British citizenship so he could help them escape from Poland. They lived with him in London for some time before becoming established. Halina would go on to graduate from Somerville College, Oxford and University College London, <b>and</b> <b>become</b> <b>an</b> editor of the Dictionary of National Biography.|$|E
5|$|The National Hurricane Center remarked the {{potential}} for the system transitioning into a tropical cyclone. An approaching trough caused the storm to stall and weaken the deep convection. On April 23, the cyclone weakened to depression status due to strong wind shear. A Hurricane Hunters flight into the system confirmed the weakening, and also reported a 1.8°F (1°C) temperature rise in the center, suggesting a warm core and some tropical characteristics. Early on April 24, the subtropical depression turned eastward, maintaining limited convection. At the time, forecasters anticipated the depression would continue east-northeastward <b>and</b> <b>become</b> <b>an</b> extratropical cyclone. By late on April 24, the system was too weak to classify using the Dvorak technique, and the NHC ceased issuing advisories. Within 24hours, the circulation dissipated as the system continued eastward through the westerlies.|$|E
5|$|Set in 1957, Great Moments in Aviation follows Gabriel Angel (Rakie Ayola), a young Caribbean {{woman from}} Grenada who embarks {{on a cruise}} to England with the {{intention}} of becoming an aviator. Upon boarding the ship, Gabriel finds herself assigned shared sleeping quarters with fellow passenger Duncan Stewart (Jonathan Pryce). The rest of the ship's passengers, including missionaries Angela Bead (Vanessa Redgrave) and Gwendolyne Quim (Dorothy Tutin) assume the two are married, and when Professor Rex Goodyear (John Hurt) appears to recognise Duncan as his old acquaintance Alasdair Birch, Duncan fosters the assumption to maintain his cover. It transpires that Duncan is a forger, who many years ago stole a Titian painting from Goodyear and had an affair with his wife. Goodyear believes that his painting is on board the ship, and leads Gabriel to believe that Duncan was responsible for his wife's death. She is furious with Duncan for lying to her, but the two go on to reconcile and later make love. Their romance is complicated by the fact Gabriel professes to have a husband waiting for her in England. She explains that he has been there for two years working, and she is joining him so that she can fulfil her lifelong dream of becoming a pilot — inspired by her grandfather Thomas (Oliver Samuels) who flew off into a storm and never came home. They begin a relationship nonetheless, supported by Angela and Gwendolyne, who also come to realise that they have feelings for one another. They each confess to having secretly been in love with the other for years, and become lovers, vowing to live together in their retirement. It comes to light that the death of Goodyear's wife was an accident, caused as he and Duncan fought over her. Duncan returns his painting, and goes on to burn all his forged documents and papers in front of Gabriel. She confesses that her marriage to Michael is over, and she and Duncan resolve to begin a life together. The film ends with Gabriel's grandmother Vesuvia (Carmen Munroe) reading her family a letter from England, informing them that Gabriel and Duncan are happy together, and are expecting a child. As the family express their delight, Gabriel flies overhead, having finally attained her pilot licence <b>and</b> <b>become</b> <b>an</b> aviator.|$|E
