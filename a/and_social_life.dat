5|$|Campbell {{moved from}} Seattle to San Francisco in 1975, {{getting a job}} in a {{hospital}} near The Castro and immersing himself in the political <b>and</b> <b>social</b> <b>life</b> of the community, which had become a center for the LGBT community over the previous few years. By 1981, he had enrolled in a training program at University of California, San Francisco, to become an adult health nurse practitioner, with a view to focusing on healthcare in the gay and lesbian community.|$|E
5|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} the union, the process of gradual Polonization gained steady momentum. In culture <b>and</b> <b>social</b> <b>life,</b> both the Polish language and Catholicism became dominant, and in 1696, Polish replaced Belarusian as the official language—with the Belarusian language being banned from administrative use. However, the local Ruthenian peasants, continued to speak their own language and remained faithful to the Eastern Orthodox church.|$|E

5|$|By {{the years}} of unification, German Jews played an {{important}} role in the intellectual underpinnings of the German professional, intellectual, <b>and</b> <b>social</b> <b>life.</b> The expulsion of Jews from Russia in the 1880s and 1890s complicated integration into the German public sphere. Russian Jews arrived in north German cities in the thousands; considerably less educated and less affluent, their often dismal poverty dismayed many of the Germanized Jews. Many of the problems related to poverty (such as illness, overcrowded housing, unemployment, school absenteeism, refusal to learn German, etc.) emphasized their distinctiveness for not only the Christian Germans, but for the local Jewish populations as well.|$|E
5|$|The next day, Bart {{plans to}} reveal what he witnessed, but Seymour and Edna {{fear that they}} would be fired if anyone found out and they swear him to secrecy. They hire him as their gofer so they can {{secretly}} exchange messages. Bart agrees for a while because the reward for his cooperation is that Milhouse will inherit Bart's poor school record. Eventually, Bart grows frustrated about his home, school <b>and</b> <b>social</b> <b>life</b> continually being interrupted to help them advance their relationship, putting him in embarrassing situations. One afternoon at school, after he is embarrassed in front of his classmates by having to say one of Seymour's messages to Edna out loud, Bart bitterly gathers the entire school in front of a janitor's closet and he opens the door to reveal that Seymour and Edna are making out.|$|E
5|$|In 1874, Savage began {{a ten-year}} stay in San Francisco. He worked {{with his father}} and brother on an iron foundry enterprise, and served two years as colonel of the 2nd Regiment California National Guard. Savage took a {{prominent}} role in the civic <b>and</b> <b>social</b> <b>life</b> of the city, and was often called upon to make extemporaneous speeches to large crowds, a skill on which politician and economist Henry George complimented him. In January 1878, Savage served as chief military executive officer of the Committee of Safety, a group set up to oppose Denis Kearney and his riotous mob of angry supporters who {{wanted to get rid of}} Chinese immigrants. Savage's calm and logical presence was seen by San Franciscans as a rallying point for law and order during the riots. Savage renewed the friendship of his childhood schoolmate, now Bohemian Club poet Charles Warren Stoddard. He made the acquaintance of writer Archibald Clavering Gunter, who would later publish some of Savage's stories.|$|E

5|$|The Khmer Rouge leadership, {{with much}} of its {{political}} and military structures shattered by the Vietnamese invasion, was forced to take refuge in Thailand, where it was warmly welcomed by the Thai Government. Despite the overwhelming economic challenges brought by the Khmer Rouge and the accompanying refugees, the Thai Government sheltered and protected the Khmer Rouge at Khao Larn camp in Trat Province. Meanwhile, in Phnom Penh, the new Kampuchean regime tried to rebuild the country’s economic <b>and</b> <b>social</b> <b>life,</b> which was largely destroyed by decades of political upheavals and constant warfare. However, efforts to rebuild the country were severely hampered {{by the lack of}} educated and qualified personnel, as most educated people had either fled the country or had been murdered by the Khmer Rouge regime during the previous four years. By the end of the year, the new regime’s attempts at nation-building were further challenged by several anti-Vietnamese resistance groups operating along the western regions of the country.|$|E
