The aims of the present study were to determine the efficacy somatostatin analogue octreotide (OCT) combined with a low dose of docetaxel (DTX) using castration resistant prostate cancer cells and to investigate the involved molecular mechanisms in vitro. The anti-proliferative and synergism potential effects were determined by MTT assay. Induction of apoptosis was analyzed employing <b>annexing</b> <b>V</b> and propidium iodide staining and flow cytometry. VEGFA, CASP 9, CASP 3 and ABCB 1 gene expression was evaluated by RT-PCR and Q-RT-PCR analysis. OCT in combination with DTX treatments on DU 145 cell migration was also evaluated. Investigation revealed that combined administration of DTX and OCT had significant, synergistically greater cytotoxicity than DTX or OCT treatment alone. The combination of the two drugs caused a more marked increase in apoptosis and resulted in greater suppression of invasive potential than either individual agent. There was obvious increase in caspase 3 expression in the OCT alone and two-drug combined treatment groups, however, VEGFA expression was markedly suppressed in them.

The framework will be further developed in D 7. 4 (“Test and evaluation plans”). Based on the use cases from deliverable D 1. 5 and the requirements from D 7. 1, hypotheses, indicators and test scenarios are formulated and included in this deliverable D 7. 2. Evaluation has, as in D 7. 1, been divided in three main categories: • Technical Assessment evaluates the performance of the developed interactIVe functions and collects information and data for safety impact assessment. • User-Related Assessment assesses the functions from the user perspective, and also to provide further input to the safety impact assessment. • Impact Assessment, estimates how and how much the functions influence traffic safety. This deliverable has further defined the evaluation framework by: • Hypotheses definition based on the research questions of D 7. 1. The hypotheses are set up in two categories per assessment (technical, user related and impact) : o General o System specific (SECONDS, INCA, and EMIC). • Indicator definition based on the hypotheses of this deliverable. The indicators are set up per assessment (technical, user related and impact). • Test scenarios definition based on the use cases defined in D 1. 5. Summarizing, the outcome of this deliverable is a list of hypotheses, indicators and test cases, which will be used to define specific test plans for the interactIVe functions in D 7. 4. The current status of the project is that the functions that will be developed in interactIVe are not yet totally outlined. This document has D 1. 5 (<b>v</b> 16, <b>Annex</b> 1 <b>v</b> 2 and <b>Annex</b> 2 <b>v</b> 12) and D 1. 6 (v 0998) as a basis.

40|$|Cancer is a {{worldwide}} health problem and despite advances in traditional treatments i. e. surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy, the cure rate remains disappointing for some cancers. Different novel therapeutic strategies are being developed. In this thesis two nontraditional cancer therapy approaches are studied: gene therapy using viral vectors and antitumour vaccination with dendritic cell - tumour cell (DC/TC) hybrids. We {{have developed a}} novel ELISPOT titration method for viral vectors {{that is based on}} the actual expression of the transgene in target cells. This method was developed with recombinant parvovirus MVM-IL 2, but it should be adaptable for other vectors carrying expression cassettes for secreted transgene products for which antibodies are available. The ELISPOT titration method allows for faster and better quantification of transducing units present in vector stocks as opposed to titration by in situ hybridisation (annexe I). The MVMIL 2 vector has shown an anti-tumour effect against melanoma in an immunocompetent mouse model (annexe IV). Previous work concerns photodynamic inactivation of adenoviral vectors for biosafety and an in vivo study in which a synergistic effect of antiangiogenesis gene therapy combined with radiotherapy could be shown (<b>annexes</b> <b>V</b> and VI). DC/TC hybrids have been proposed as cancer vaccines for their simultaneous expression of antigen presentation machinery and tumour associated antigens. Hybrids are classically generated by polyethylene glycol (PEG) or electrofusion. These methods however require special skills and equipment and cause rather high cell lethality. Fusion via the expression of viral fusogenic membrane glycoproteins (FMG), such as the vesicular stomatitis virus-G (VSV-G) (annexe III) or the Gibbon ape Leukemia Virus (GaLV) FMG, have recently been described. We have mainly focussed on the latter. Transduction of cells with GaLV-FMG proved to be a limiting step for an efficient generation of hybrids. On the other hand, constitutive expression of GaLV-FMG leads to lethal syncytia formation in human cells. Therefore we developed a novel fusion strategy for the generation of DC/TC cell hybrids that involves the use of a non-human fusogenic cell line that constitutively expresses the GaLV-FMG. With this method we were able to generate reproducible yields of DC/TC triparental hybrids. The formation of tri-parental hybrids via the fusogenic cell line is an interesting alternative to existing DC/TC fusion methods because of its simplicity and its flexibility in the choice of fusion partners, i. e. autologous or allogeneic DCs and tumour cells. Moreover, the tri-parent hybrid system offers the possibility to further enhance the immune response by the addition of transgenes that code for immuno-modulating factors to the fusogenic cell line (annexe II).

Plasma membrane asymmetry was determined in polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN), lymphocytes, and platelets from 45 healthy young (mean 29 years, 26 male) and 28 healthy elderly (mean 70 years, 15 male) subjects by flow cytometric measurement of <b>annex</b> in <b>V</b> binding to cell surface phosphatidylserine. Membrane fluidity in lymphocytes and platelets from young and elderly subjects was determined by fluorescence polarization of 1, 6 -diphenyl-l, 3, 5 -hexatriene (DPH) and (4 -trimethylammonium) -DPH (1 MA). Results. In elderly subjects, {{a higher proportion of}} lymphocytes had specific annexin V binding to phosphatidylserine (PS) than in young subjects (young: median percentage of cells with specific annexin V binding to PS 5. 3 [second to fourth quintiles range 3. 8 - 8. 7]; elderly: 8. 5 [5. 2 - 17. 2]; p =. 028). No ageing change in annexin V binding to PMN was observed (young: 35. 0 % [21. 8 - 53. 5]; elderly: 39. 6 % [27. 4 - 69. 8]; p =. 42). Platelets had no specific annexin V binding (young: median molecules of annexin V specific binding 3. 8 [0. 4 - 11. 3]; elderly:- 1. 4 [- 4. 8 - 1. 7]; p =. 23).

Attention was devoted mainly to the selected fusarium mycotoxins (deoxynivalenol, zearalenol, T- 2 toxin, and HT- 2 toxin) ochratoxin A and aflatoxins B 1, B 2, G 1, and G 2. The aim of the thesis was to optimize and validate analytical methods for the determination of the above mentioned mycotoxins in the brewing materials and beer. Analytes were separated using high-performance liquid chromatography with mass – spectrometric detection (HPLC-MS/MS) and ultra-performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection (UPLC/FLR). These analytical methods were then applied for mapping the occurrence of fusarium mycotoxins in malting barley crops in the Czech Republic and monitoring the level of contamination with mycotoxins in malting and brewing industries. In addition, experiments studying over-foaming of beer were conducted as primary gushing – over-foaming of beer – is connected, similarly as mycotoxins, with the presence of microscopic filamentous fungi in the raw materials for beer production. Studies describing in detail these methods are part of this thesis (<b>Annex</b> I – <b>V).</b> From all published results, it is evident that the occurrence of mycotoxins in cereals including barley is natural and cannot be completely prevented, not even if all conditions of correct agricultural practice are observed.
