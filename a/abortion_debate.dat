40|$|The {{collapse}} of communism across East Central Europe was marked by a renewal of debates around reproduction, with <b>abortion</b> <b>debates</b> surfacing in Romania, Germany and Poland. Reproductive politics and more specifically <b>abortion</b> <b>debates</b> typically come to the forefront {{in times of crisis}} or societal transformation. Struggles over women's reproductive rights in Poland, as evidenced by continuing debate around the legal status of abortion, are in this postcommunist context intimately related to and bound up with ongoing symbolic and concrete re-definitions of Polish nationhood, identity and citizenship. Focusing on the connections between discourses of Polish nationhood, gender and democracy, this article offers a detailed and critical engagement with debate in the Sejm (the lower chamber of the Polish parliament) during the second reading of the 1996 liberalization of abortion amendment. Using a discourse analysis methodology, the article argues that abortion is a symbolic issue through which anxieties about postcommunist reform are raised, nationalist pasts and futures are imagined and through which political projects are articulated...|$|R

50|$|Teratophobia may {{refer to}} either a fear of giving birth to malformed {{offspring}} or a general fear of disfigured people. In its broadest sense it may also include a fear of monsters or monstrosities in general.

Individuals that deal with teratophobes regularly are also contrasted with attractive people, and are said to find courting difficult and also find it difficult to find a romantic partner. The concept of teratophobia has also been observed as a phenomenon during <b>abortion</b> <b>debates.</b>|$|R

25|$|Garson Romalis (October 23, 1937 – January 31, 2014) was a Canadian {{gynecologist}} {{who specialized}} in providing abortions. (See Abortion in Canada.) He was twice wounded in attempts on his life. The first attempt on his life {{was by far the}} most violent antiabortion crime in Canada, according to the National Post.

Since being personally attacked, Romalis became more outspoken and more determined to provide abortions to women who want them. As such, he was a notable public figure in the Canadian <b>abortion</b> <b>debate.</b> The University of Toronto Law School invited him to speak at their Symposium to mark the 20th Anniversary of R. vs. Morgentaler.

I will map abortion and contraception policies and discourses during and after state socialism, with Russia, Poland and Romania as main cases. Furthermore, historical and contemporary constructions of birth control in these countries are contrasted to western European debates, in order to denaturalise implicit assumptions in the different contexts. The analytical focus will in particular be on the conceptual distinction between contraception and abortion and on different normative assessments of these two categories, with examples from ‘border conflicts’ – controversies on whether a phenomenon is the one or the other. The rhetoric of ‘choice’ in <b>abortion</b> <b>debates</b> and its implicit assumptions will also be discussed...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{provides}} a rhetorical history of abortion discourse {{with an emphasis}} on the rhetorical moment from 2013 - 2016. To uncover the rhetorical strategies used to shape consensus on abortion, I highlight three major events—Senator Wendy Davis’s (D-Fort Worth) notorious 13 -hour filibuster against Texas’s HB 2, the conservative capture of Davis as Abortion Barbie, and the Supreme Court case, Whole Woman’s Health v. Hellerstedt (2016). Because of these key rhetorical moments, pro-choice and anti-choice publics cultivated a period of heightened tension that reinvigorated <b>abortion</b> <b>debates.</b> While pro-choice groups employed narrative to centralize women as rhetorical agents and open spaces to discuss abortion, anti-choice publics used visual rhetoric to vilify women and accentuate the fetus. But with both ideologies adopting scientific rhetoric, the Supreme Court intervened to determine evidenced-based truth and settle disputed abortion law. This helped make abortion a major political issue in the 2016 presidential election and accentuated how legal, political, and public discourses perpetuate reproductive oppression...|$|R

40|$|The {{issues of}} fetal protection, fetal {{rights and the}} status of unborn life have been debated on a variety of levels in a variety of {{disciplines}} over the past centuries. One needs only think of John Milton who asked the “hard” question: “For man to tell how human life began / Is hard: for who himself beginning knew?” (Paradise lost (1667) Bk 8 251 – 252). While the issue of fetal rights most often arises in <b>abortion</b> <b>debates,</b> the issue of fetal rights in the context of feticide has received scant attention in South Africa. (For a thought-provoking general discussion of fetal rights, see Du Plessis “Jurisprudential reflections on the status of unborn life” 1990 TSAR 44; Van Niekerk (ed) The status of prenatal life (1991) and Kahn (ed) The sanctity of human life (1983).)

40|$|When {{considering}} {{questions of}} access, {{an argument for}} procreative autonomy is an interesting starting point. Its compelling logic, when applied to <b>abortion</b> <b>debates,</b> posits that women should be trusted to make abortion decisions outside of the scrutiny of criminal law. In {{the face of the}} term "autonomy", it has been noted that women's abortion decisions are frequently made in consultation and with a view to how their decisions will affect others, including the child they could bear. The same can be said of women who travel to the reproductive technological frontier. Their individual and complex embodied experiences and their decision-making processes need to be fully considered in future debates about regulation so that the meanings of these technologies are articulated by those whose lives bear their most profound marks. And in the speculation that these debates entail about ways in which current and future uses of reproductive technologies could change the constitution of populations and future social relations, mothers and their families - whichever form they take - must be given room to tell their stories...|$|R

The result is that the Swedish parliament <b>debate</b> about the <b>abortion</b> talks about abortion i four different ways.

Were the second and third way is the biggest. The way the members of the parliament sees abortion influences the way they se the women and the roll of the society in the abortion situation. One side means that it is a to big burden for the women to carry on there own and that decisions about abortion should be taken in consultation with a welfare officer and a doctor. The other side means that women should have the same rights as men, that they are capable to take decisions about there possibility {{to take care of the}} babies. ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{both public}} and private debate, {{arguments}} presented in favor of or against abortion access focus on either the moral permissibility of an induced abortion, or justification of laws permitting or restricting abortion. The World Medical Association Declaration on Therapeutic Abortion notes that [...] "circumstances bringing the interests of a mother into conflict with the interests of her unborn child create a dilemma and raise the question {{as to whether or not}} the pregnancy should be deliberately terminated". <b>Abortion</b> <b>debates,</b> especially pertaining to abortion laws, are often spearheaded by groups advocating one of these two positions. Anti-abortion groups who favor greater legal restrictions on abortion, including complete prohibition, most often describe themselves as [...] "pro-life" [...] while abortion rights groups who are against such legal restrictions describe themselves as [...] "pro-choice". Generally, the former position argues that a human fetus is a human person with a right to live, making abortion morally the same as murder. The latter position argues that a woman has certain reproductive rights, especially the choice whether or not to carry a pregnancy to term, and that at the point of abortion, the fetus is insufficiently developed to constitute a life form.|$|R
