Some existing results, obtained under the unrealistic assumption of an infinite life expectancy, are reversed. In particular, we show that when the market interest rate is equal to (or less than) the sum of <b>age-specific</b> <b>mortality</b> <b>rate</b> and the discounting rate in time preference at any age over the remaining lifetime, then VSL declines. We also show that an inverted-U shape of VSL profile over the life cycle emerges under realistically plausible circumstances. An innovation is that we characterize the changes in optimal consumption and instantaneous utility with age, showing that such changes are proportionate to the difference between the sum of <b>age-specific</b> <b>mortality</b> <b>rate</b> and the discounting rate in time preference and the market interest rate, which may prove to be useful in addressing other issues related to VSL.

To address this issue, we consider reconciling forecasts of <b>age-specific</b> <b>mortality</b> <b>rates,</b> extending the methods of Hyndman et al.

For evaluating forecast uncertainty, we propose a bootstrap method for reconciling interval forecasts.

There remains however, {{the question as}} to whether these two species are always responding in an identical manner to the feeding regime. Enhanced survival can be achieved either through a set-point effect, where there is a change in the elevation of the Ln <b>age-specific</b> <b>mortality</b> <b>rate</b> or, by a decrease in the slope of the Ln <b>age-specific</b> <b>mortality</b> <b>rate</b> that results in {{a significant increase in the}} time to double the rate of mortality.

These two possible responses to DR feeding may confound attempts to identify the biochemical mechanisms underlying the effect of DR on survival. A general lack of consistency is evident in the data and this is apparent when evaluating the free radical hypothesis of ageing in this model. Further, this hypothesis as currently viewed may be too simplistic to explain the variety and complexity of the ageing phenotype.

40|$|The last {{published}} {{figures have}} shown geographical variations in mortality {{with respect to}} female breast cancer in European countries. However, national health policies need a dynamic image of the geographical variations within the country. The aim {{of this paper was}} to describe the spatial distribution of age-specific mortality rates from female breast cancer in the municipalities of Andalusia (southern Spain) and to analyze its evolution over time from 1981 to 2012. An ecological study was devised. Two spatio-temporal hierarchical Bayesian models were estimated. One of these was used to estimate the <b>age-specific</b> <b>mortality</b> <b>rate</b> for each municipality, together with its time trends, and the other was used to estimate the age-specific rate ratio compared with Spain as a whole. The results showed that 98 % of the municipalities exhibited a decreasing or a flat mortality trend for all the age groups. In 2012, the geographical variability of the age-specific mortality rates was small, especially for population groups below 65. In addition, more than 96. 6 % of the municipalities showed an <b>age-specific</b> <b>mortality</b> <b>rate</b> similar to the corresponding rate for Spain, and there were no identified significant clusters.

In making social policies and pricing annuities at national and sub-national levels, {{not only is}} it important to forecast mortality accurately, but also, forecasts at sub-national levels should add up to the forecasts at the national level. This motivates recent developments of grouped functional time series methods (Shang, Han and Rob Hyndman., 2017) to reconcile <b>age-specific</b> <b>mortality</b> forecasts. We extend these grouped functional time series forecasting methods to multivariate time series and apply them to produce point forecasts of <b>mortality</b> <b>rates</b> at older ages, from which fixed-term annuities for different ages and maturities can be priced. Using the regional <b>age-specific</b> <b>mortality</b> <b>rates</b> in Japan obtained from the Japanese Mortality Database, we investigate the one-step-ahead to 15 -step-ahead point forecast accuracy between the independent and grouped forecasting methods.

40|$|Free-living flatworms ("Turbellaria") are {{appropriate}} model organisms to gain better {{insight into the}} role of stem cells in ageing and rejuvenation. Ageing research in flatworms is, however, still scarce. This is partly due to culture difficulties and the lack of a complete set of demographic data, including parameters such as median lifespan and <b>age-specific</b> <b>mortality</b> <b>rate.</b> In this paper, we report on the first flatworm survival analysis. We used the species Macrostomum lignano, which is an emerging model for studying the reciprocal influence between stem cells, ageing and rejuvenation. This species has a median lifespan of 205 +/- 13 days (average +/- standard deviation [SD]) and a 90 (th) percentile lifespan of 373 +/- 32 days. The maximum lifespan, however, is more than 745 days, and the average survival curve is characterised by a long tail because a small number of individuals lives twice as long as 90 % of the population. Similar to earlier observations {{in a wide range of}} animals, in M. lignano the <b>age-specific</b> <b>mortality</b> <b>rate</b> increases exponentially, but levels off at the oldest ages. To compare the senescence of M. lignano with that of other ageing models, we determined the mortality rate doubling time, which is 0. 20 +/- 0. 02 years. As a result, we can conclude that M. lignano shows gradual senescence at a rate similar to the vertebrate ageing models Rattus norvegicus and Mus musculus. We argue that M. lignano is a suitable model for ageing and rejuvenation research, and especially for the role of stem cells in these processes, due to its accessible stem cell system and regeneration capacity, and the possibility of combining stem cell studies with demographic analyses...|$|E

No single endpoint, such as carcinogenesis, completely describes toxicant-induced effects in laboratory animals. Mathematical models of mortality and time-dependent exposure to toxicants can yield indices of net injury from all causes. With careful manipulation of diet in control groups, the separate and combined effects of hormesis, caloric restriction and toxicity on mortality can be delineated. In particular, <b>age-specific</b> <b>mortality</b> <b>rate</b> analyses can characterize a) the temporal pattern of net injury from acute, short term and chronic environmental exposure, b) late-life effects, c) effects of fractional exposures and d) relative biological effectiveness.

Elderly people, aged 80 years and older, {{have been the}} subject of this study and were viewed in several aspects including the number of elderly people and <b>age-specific</b> <b>mortality</b> <b>rate</b> by districts. Data for the years 1981 and 1991 were reviewed. In 1981 there were 73, 052 (1. 6 %) persons aged 80 or older. Ten years later in 1991 their number had increased to 107, 256, which was 2. 2 % of the whole population. Most of the elderly people live on the islands, in the district of Dubrovnik and in Lika, which is in the continental part of Croatia. There are more women than men among those aged 80 years and older. <b>Age-specific</b> <b>mortality</b> <b>rate</b> in 1981 in Croatia was 170 and in 1991 151 per 1, 000 elderly people. In women the rate was 162 in 1981 and 141 in 1991, per 1, 000 elderly people. The death rate was higher in men; in 1981 it was 201 and in 1991, 172 per 1, 000 elderly people. We can see that the specific mortality rate had fallen in 1991 compared to 1981. The age specific mortality rate varies from district to district. In 1991 the lowest, 110 per 1, 000, was in Lika, and the highest in the districts of Vara`din (182 per 1, 000), Bjelovar (178 per 1, 000) and Zagorje (175 per 1, 000). The death rate was higher amongst elderly men (172. 31 per 1, 000) than elderly women (141. 65 per 1, 000). The smallest number of those aged 80 years and older with a high death rate is found in Slavonia. The opposite – a high number of elderly people and a low specific mortality rate – can be seen in the district of Lika.

Particular attention is paid to the representation of children skeletal remains in cemeteries. Comparing the empirical number of children from twelve Central European cemeteries with theoretical values indicated that especially the youngest children are under-represented.

The aim of the thesis is to evaluate mortality of this group of causes of death in selected Latin American countries {{at the turn of}} the millennium. It is generally known that in developing countries mortality rates from infectious and parasitic diseases are higher than in developed areas, where in the context of an epidemiological transition, when infectious diseases tend to be replaced by degenerative (civilization) diseases, mortality rates from infectious and parasitic diseases are significantly decreased.

Objective : To examine recent trends in <b>age-specific</b> <b>mortality</b> <b>rates</b> from CHD, particularly those among younger adults. Methods and results : Mortality data from 1984 to 2004 were used to calculate <b>age-specific</b> <b>mortality</b> <b>rates</b> for British adults aged 35 + years, and joinpoint regression {{was used to assess}} changes in trends. Overall, the age-adjusted <b>mortality</b> <b>rate</b> decreased by 54. 7 % in men and by 48. 3 % in women.

Assuming a further {{continuation of the}} stable pace of mortality decline, a Poisson log-bilinear projection model {{is applied to the}} forecasting of the gender- and <b>age-specific</b> <b>mortality</b> <b>rates</b> for Belgium on the basis of mortality statistics relating to the period 1950 - 2000. Bootstrap procedures are then used to obtain confidence intervals on various actuarial quantities...|$|R
40|$|The {{calculated}} {{life expectancy}} (whether by subpopulation-specific characteristics or by <b>age-specific</b> <b>mortality</b> <b>rates)</b> for aggregated subpopulations need not lie {{within the limits}} of the individual subpopulations' life expectancies. For two subpopulations and two age groups, we present a geometric interpretation of exactly what happens and indicate how this generalizes. Also, we give a complete algebraic characterization of when paradoxes can and cannot occur for the case of two subpopulations and two age groups...|$|R
