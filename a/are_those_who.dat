The Carter Center estimated 200million people in 74 countries are infected with the disease, and half the victims live in Africa. The condition has a low mortality rate, but often is a chronic illness that can damage internal organs. It can impair the growth and cognitive development of children, and {{increase the risk of}} bladder cancer in adults. The disease is caused by several flukes of the genus Schistosoma, which can bore through human skin.

5|$|John Calvin, a sixteenth-century French theologian and {{principal}} {{figure in the}} development of Calvinism, was influenced by Augustine's works. Unlike Augustine, Calvin was willing to accept that God is responsible for evil and suffering; however, he maintained that God cannot be indicted for it. Calvin continued the Augustinian approach that sin {{is the result of the}} fall of man, and argued that the human mind, will, and affections are corrupted by sin. He believed that only the grace of God is sufficient to provide humans with ongoing ethical guidance, arguing that reason is blinded by humans' sinful nature. Calvin proposed that humanity is predestined, divided into the elect and the reprobate: the elect <b>are</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> God has chosen to save and are the only ones who will be saved.|$|E
5|$|The Varaha, in the 83 {{verses of}} Chapter 2, {{explains}} to Ribhu {{how to achieve}} the most exalted knowledge of Brahmavidya, and then what it is. He tells Ribhu that the four means of this knowledge are to practice conduct of one's Varna (caste) and one's Ashrama (stage in life), from ascetic austerity {{and with the help}} of a Guru (spiritual teacher). The Varaha then states that the path to Brahmavidya is through the capacity to distinguish between the ephemeral and the eternal, detachment from the material world unto the spiritual world. A sincere longing for spiritual liberation and six virtuous qualities (shama) are essential in order to achieve Brahmavidya, asserts the Upanishad, these being tranquility, self-restraint, doing work without craving for rewards, endurance, faith, and meditation. Varaha states in verse 2.4 that the truly blessed <b>are</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> know Brahman and Atman and have thus become one with them.|$|E

5|$|When Lon Nol assumed {{power in}} 1970, the Khmer Republic {{government}} launched a propaganda campaign {{to portray the}} ethnic Vietnamese as agents of the Vietcong. About 30,000 Vietnamese were arrested and killed in prison, while an additional 200,000 were repatriated to Vietnam. Five years later in 1975, some 200,000 to 250,000 Vietnamese remained in Cambodia when the Khmer Rouge seized power. About three quarters of them were expelled to Vietnam, and the remaining 20,000 who remained <b>are</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> are of mixed-Vietnamese and Khmer descent. Those who remained were either killed or massacred by the regime. By the time Vietnamese troops entered Cambodia in 1979, virtually all of Cambodia's Vietnamese population were either displaced or killed. Vietnam established a new regime known as the People's Republic of Kampuchea (PRK), and Vietnamese advisers were appointed in the new government administration. In 1983, the PRK government formulated an official policy to encourage former Vietnamese residents of Cambodia to return and settle down. Vietnamese immigrants who had no family ties to Cambodia also came to settle in the country, as there was little border control to limit Vietnamese migrants from entering the country. The Vietnamese were recognised as an official minority under the PRK regime, and Overseas Vietnamese Associations were established in parts of Cambodia with sizeable Vietnamese populations. The PRK government also identity cards were issued to them until the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops in 1990.|$|E
5|$|When {{the college}} {{was founded in}} 1571, the first charter {{installed}} David Lewis as Principal and named eight others as the first Fellows of the college. The statutes of 1622 allowed for 16 Fellows. There is now no limit {{on the number of}} Fellowships that the Governing Body can create. The college statutes provide for various categories of Fellows. Professorial Fellows are those Professors and Readers of the University who are allocated to the college by the University. One of these professorships is the Jesus Professor of Celtic, which is the only chair in Celtic Studies at an English university. Celtic scholars such as Sir John Rhys and Ellis Evans have held the position since its creation in 1877. The chair is currently vacant, having been held by Thomas Charles-Edwards until his retirement in 2011. The zoologists Charles Godfray and Paul Harvey are both Professorial Fellows. Official Fellows <b>are</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> hold tutorial or administrative appointments in the college. Past Official Fellows include the composer and musicologist John Caldwell, the historians Sir Goronwy Edwards and Niall Ferguson, the philosopher Galen Strawson and the political philosopher John Gray. There are also Senior and Junior Research Fellows. Principals and Fellows who retire can be elected as Emeritus Fellows.|$|E

First, <b>are</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> explore the theory as a possible means of explanation or employ it as the framework for their research. Second, <b>are</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> build on or expand Bourdieu's theory. Finally, there <b>are</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> attempt to disprove Bourdieu's findings or to discount them in favour of an alternative theory.
