5|$|During her {{subsequent}} {{testimony before}} the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee {{as part of the}} confirmation hearings, she refused to <b>answer</b> <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> her view on the constitutionality of some issues such as the death penalty as it was an issue that she might have to vote on if it came before the court.|$|E
5|$|Evolutionary {{biology is}} partly based on paleontology, which uses {{the fossil record}} to <b>answer</b> <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> the mode and tempo of evolution, and partly on the {{developments}} {{in areas such as}} population genetics. In the 1980s, developmental biology re-entered evolutionary biology after its initial exclusion from the modern synthesis through the study of evolutionary developmental biology. Phylogenetics, systematics, and taxonomy are related fields often considered part of evolutionary biology.|$|E
5|$|Saadanius had {{a longer}} face than living catarrhines and lacked the {{advanced}} frontal sinus (airspaces in the facial bones) found in living catarrhines. However, {{it had a}} bony ear tube (ectotympanic) and teeth {{comparable to those of}} living catarrhines. The discovery of Saadanius may help <b>answer</b> <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> the evolution and appearance of the last common ancestors of Old World monkeys and apes.|$|E

5|$|At {{the same}} time, Ginsburg did <b>answer</b> <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> some {{potentially}} controversial issues. For instance, she affirmed her {{belief in a}} constitutional right to privacy and explained at some length her personal judicial philosophy and thoughts regarding gender equality. Ginsburg was more forthright in discussing her views on topics about which she had previously written. The U.S. Senate confirmed her by a 96 to 3 vote and she took her judicial oath on August 10, 1993.|$|E
5|$|Nixon {{refused to}} answer further {{questions}} about the Fund, and attention turned to Stevenson's fund, especially as its details became clear. Governor Stevenson's fund, which proved to total $146,000, had been used for such expenditures as Christmas gifts to reporters, dues for private clubs, and to hire an orchestra for a dance his son was hosting. Taking a leaf from Nixon's book, the Democrats refused to <b>answer</b> <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> the governor's fund. Both parties were eager to bury the matter, and the story died.|$|E
5|$|On March 9, 2000, {{after failing}} to win any of the first 20 {{primaries}} and caucuses in the election process, Bradley withdrew his campaign and endorsed Gore; he ruled out the idea of running as the vice-presidential candidate and did not <b>answer</b> <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> possible future runs for the presidency.

5|$|Other policemen {{arrived in}} Houndsditch, {{and began to}} attend to the wounded. Tucker's body was put into a taxi and he was taken to the London Hospital (now the Royal London Hospital) in Whitechapel Road. Choate was also taken there, where he was {{operated}} on, but he died at 5:30 am on 17 December. Bentley was taken to St Bartholomew's Hospital. He was half-conscious on arrival, but recovered {{enough to be able to}} have a conversation with his pregnant wife and <b>answer</b> <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> the events. At 6:45pm on 17 December his condition worsened, and he died at 7:30. The killings of Tucker, Bentley and Choate remain one of the largest multiple murders of police officers carried out in Britain in peacetime.|$|E
5|$|The {{relatively}} stable {{value of the}} currency in the 1990s compared to the 1980s is explained by Peter D. Little in Somalia: Economy without a State as resulting {{from the lack of}} a central government printing currency to pay for civil and military expenditures. Traders avoid the need to carry large amounts of Somali shillings by converting them to U.S. dollars and then wiring them to money houses in Somalia. Because identification can be easily forged, those seeking to pick up wired money are required to <b>answer</b> <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> their clan and kinship relations. Private remittance companies known as hawala assist in the transfer of money. One of the largest such companies, Al Barakaat, was shut down in 2001 by a U.S.-led initiative due to alleged terrorist ties; the company's communications business, with more than 40,000 subscribers, was also shut down.|$|E
5|$|Alberta Chief Returning Officer Lorne Gibson, {{as one of}} his 182 post-election {{recommendations}} to the government, suggested that the appointment of returning officers be handled by his own, non-partisan, office. He had previously made this suggestion in 2006, but the government had not acted on it. He also recommended following the election that his office, rather than the government's Justice department, be responsible for prosecuting election-related offenses; the latter did not lay charges in any of 19 alleged campaign finance violations Gibson brought to its attention. In February 2009, Gibson appeared before the legislature's all-party committee on legislative offices to <b>answer</b> <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> the conduct of the election; there, he echoed opposition claims that the government, and not his office, was to blame for most problems. Shortly after, the committee voted 8–3 against re-appointing him, with all Progressive Conservatives on the committee opposing his re-appointment and all opposition MLAs supporting it. Opposition leaders David Swann and Brian Mason suggested that Gibson was being punished for criticizing the government.|$|E

5|$|For {{the second}} time in three years, Žigić was chosen as {{domestic}} player {{of the year in the}} captains' poll, and was also honoured by the Red Star Sport Association as best male athlete of 2005, an award open to athletes representing the club in any sport, not just in football. After Pantelić's departure for Hertha BSC, Red Star's goals were spread more evenly among the remaining forward players. In the league, Žigić and Boško Janković were joint-top scorers with 12, and Purović contributed one fewer, as the club won their 24th title. They completed the double with a defeat of city rivals OFK in the cup final, coming back from 2–0 down via Žigić's 67th-minute free kick under the defensive wall and Purović's equaliser to take the match into extra time, during which Žigić gave Red Star the lead with a header and Dušan Basta made the final score 4–2. After the match, Žigić refused to <b>answer</b> <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> his Red Star future.|$|E
5|$|While {{waiting in}} the church, Jackie sees Pete talking to Rose and thinks he is having an affair. Pete and Rose talk alone, and he comes to realise that she is his {{daughter}}. When Rose is unable to <b>answer</b> <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> how good of a father he was, Pete realises he was meant {{to die in the}} accident. Jackie thinks Rose is Pete's daughter with another woman, and in a fit of frustration Pete hands the baby Rose to adult Rose. The paradox worsens, and a Reaper is able to enter the church. The Doctor declares himself the oldest thing in the church and offers himself to the Reaper, who consumes him and disappears. The TARDIS key goes cold and drops to the ground. Pete realises that they now have no other choice and that he must die in order to restore the timeline. He bids Rose and Jackie an emotional farewell, races out of the church and throws himself under the car that was originally meant to kill him; it has continued to appear near the church. The timeline is repaired, and the Reapers' victims reappear. The Doctor sends Rose to be with her father, and she holds his hand until he dies. Rose and the Doctor walk hand-in-hand back to the restored TARDIS.|$|E
