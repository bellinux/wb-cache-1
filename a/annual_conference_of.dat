5|$|In January 1994, over 60,000 third–sixth {{graders in}} the state of Oklahoma {{selected}} from Shiloh 23 nominees as the winner of the Sequoyah Children's Book Award. The Sequoyah Award was presented to Naylor in April 1994 during the yearly Oklahoma Library Association conference. On April 14, 1994, at the <b>annual</b> <b>conference</b> <b>of</b> the Missouri Association of School Librarians, Shiloh received that year's Mark Twain Readers Award. The Mark Twain Award is decided annually through a vote by fourth–eighth graders {{in the state}} of Missouri. On October 29, 1994, Naylor received the William Allen White Children's Book Award for Shiloh. The award is decided through the tallying of over 55,000 children {{in the state of}} Kansas.|$|E
5|$|The Genesee Wesleyan Seminary {{was founded}} in 1831 by the Genesee <b>Annual</b> <b>Conference</b> <b>of</b> the Methodist Episcopal Church in Lima, New York, south of Rochester. In 1850, it was {{resolved}} to enlarge the institution from a seminary into a college, or to connect a college with the seminary, becoming Genesee College. However, the location was soon thought {{by many to be}} insufficiently central. Its difficulties were compounded by the next set of technological changes: the railroad that displaced the Erie Canal as the region's economic engine bypassed Lima completely. The trustees of the struggling college then decided to seek a locale whose economic and transportation advantages could provide a better base of support.|$|E
5|$|In 2009 McNallen {{was invited}} to the International Asatru Summer Camp, but this was opposed {{by many of the}} groups attending, who argued that he should not be invited because of what they {{perceived}} as his racist views; a number of European Heathen groups, such as Norway's Bifrost and the Swedish SAS, threatened to boycott the event as a result of McNallen's invite. In 2011, the AFA sent a contingent to the <b>annual</b> <b>conference</b> <b>of</b> a white nationalist organization, the National Policy Institute, in what some figures close to McNallen revealed was an attempt to recruit members. After this incident was publicized it resulted in accusations of racism being levelled against McNallen and the AFA from various parts of the Pagan blogosphere.|$|E

In 2003, the choir returned to Italy to perform at the <b>annual</b> <b>Conference</b> <b>of</b> the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The choir has also performed in France and Spain. On October 2, 2007, the Weill Institute of Music at Carnegie Hall announced that the City College choir {{was one of four}} high school choirs selected to participate in the National High School Choral Festival on March 10, 2008. The fourchoirs will perform Johannes Brahms' A German Requiem under the direction of Craig Jessop, Mormon Tabernacle Choir Director.

5|$|D. hallorum, first {{described}} in 1991 by Gillette as Seismosaurus halli from a partial skeleton comprising vertebrae, pelvis and ribs, specimen NMMNH P-3690, {{was found in}} 1979. As the specific name honours two people, Jim and Ruth Hall, George Olshevsky later suggested to emend the name as S. hallorum, using the mandatory genitive plural; Gillette then emended the name, which usage has been followed by others, including Carpenter (2006). In 2004, a presentation at the <b>annual</b> <b>conference</b> <b>of</b> the Geological Society of America made a case for Seismosaurus being a junior synonym of Diplodocus. This {{was followed by a}} much more detailed publication in 2006, which not only renamed the species Diplodocus hallorum, but also speculated that it could prove to be the same as D. longus. The position that D. hallorum should be regarded as a specimen of D. longus was also taken by the authors of a redescription of Supersaurus, refuting a previous hypothesis that Seismosaurus and Supersaurus were the same. A 2015 analysis of diplodocid relationships noted that these opinions are based on the more complete referred specimens of D. longus. The authors of this analysis concluded that those specimens were indeed the same species as D. hallorum, but that D. longus itself was a nomen dubium.|$|E
