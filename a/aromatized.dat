25|$|Testosterone can be metabolized by {{aromatase}} into estradiol, {{and many}} other AAS can be metabolized into their corresponding estrogenic metabolites as well. As an example, the 17α-alkylated AAS methyltestosterone and metandienone are converted by aromatase into methylestradiol. 4,5α-Dihydrogenated derivatives of testosterone such as DHT cannot be <b>aromatized,</b> whereas 19-nortestosterone derivatives like nandrolone can be but to a greatly reduced extent. Some 19-nortestosterone derivatives, such as dimethandrolone and 11β-MNT, cannot be <b>aromatized</b> due to steric hindrance provided by their 11β-methyl group, whereas the closely related AAS trestolone (7α-methyl-19-nortestosterone), in relation to its lack of an 11β-methyl group, can be <b>aromatized.</b> AAS that are 17α-alkylated (and not also 4,5α-reduced or 19-demethylated) are also <b>aromatized</b> but {{to a lesser extent}} than is testosterone. However, it is notable that estrogens that are 17α-substituted (e.g., ethinylestradiol and methylestradiol) are of markedly increased estrogenic potency due to improved metabolic stability, and for this reason, 17α-alkylated AAS can actually have high estrogenicity and comparatively greater estrogenic effects than testosterone.|$|E
25|$|Unlike testosterone, DHT {{cannot be}} <b>aromatized</b> into an {{estrogen}} like estradiol, {{and for this}} reason, has no propensity for estrogenic effects.|$|E
25|$|Estradiol, {{like other}} steroids, {{is derived from}} cholesterol. After side chain {{cleavage}} and using the Δ5 or the Δ4- pathway, Δ4-androstenedione is the key intermediary. A portion of the Δ4-androstenedione is converted to testosterone, which in turn undergoes conversion to estradiol by aromatase. In an alternative pathway, Δ4-androstenedione is <b>aromatized</b> to estrone, which is subsequently converted to estradiol.|$|E
25|$|During pregnancy, {{estrogen}} levels, including estradiol, rise steadily toward term. The {{source of}} these estrogens is the placenta, which <b>aromatizes</b> prohormones {{produced in the}} fetal adrenal gland.|$|R
50|$|As {{drostanolone}} {{does not}} <b>aromatize</b> at any dose, typical estrogen-linked side effects encountered when using other anabolic steroids, like water retention, gynecomastia, and elevated blood pressure are not observed.|$|R
50|$|The 2+2cycloaddition of {{diphenyl}} ketene with phenylacetylene leads {{first to}} a cyclobutenone which thermally <b>aromatizes</b> to a phenyl vinyl ketene and cyclizes in a 4+2cycloaddition to 3,4-diphenyl-1-naphthol in 81% yield.|$|R
25|$|In rodents, estrogens (which are locally <b>aromatized</b> from androgens in the brain) play an {{important}} role in psychosexual differentiation, for example, by masculinizing territorial behavior; the same is not true in humans. In humans, the masculinizing effects of prenatal androgens on behavior (and other tissues, with the possible exception of effects on bone) appear to act exclusively through the androgen receptor. Consequently, the utility of rodent models for studying human psychosexual differentiation has been questioned.|$|E
25|$|Unlike other androgens such as testosterone, DHT {{cannot be}} {{converted}} by the enzyme aromatase into an estrogen like estradiol. Therefore, it is frequently used in research settings {{to distinguish between}} the effects of testosterone caused by binding to the AR and those caused by testosterone's conversion to estradiol and subsequent binding to and activation of ERs. Although DHT cannot be <b>aromatized,</b> it is still transformed into metabolites with significant ER affinity and activity. These are 3α-androstanediol and 3β-androstanediol, which are predominant agonists of the ERβ.|$|E
25|$|Estradiol is {{produced}} especially within the follicles {{of the female}} ovaries, but also in other endocrine (i.e., hormone-producing) and nonendocrine tissues (e.g., including fat, liver, adrenal, breast, and neural tissues). Estradiol is biosynthesized from cholesterol {{through a series of}} chemical intermediates. One principal pathway involves the generation of androstenedione, which is converted into estrone by aromatase and then by 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase into estradiol. Alternatively, androstenedione can be converted into testosterone, an androgen and the primary male sex hormone, which in turn can be <b>aromatized</b> into estradiol.|$|E
50|$|Taxodone was {{the first}} {{isolated}} example of a quinone methide with a labile hydrogen adjacent to this reactive chromophore. Kupchan demonstrated that taxodone <b>aromatizes</b> to a catechol ketone upon exposure to mild acid. Air oxidation of this catechol ketone affords taxodione.|$|R
5000|$|For most substrates, in {{the absence}} of an oxidant, the dihydrophenanthrene {{intermediate}} may reversibly open to the corresponding cis-stilbene. However, suitably substituted stilbenes cyclize irreversibly if an <b>aromatizing</b> elimination or hydrogen shift process can take place. Examples of these transformations are provided below.(3) ...|$|R
40|$|Diels-Alder {{addition}} of N,N-diethyl- 1, 3 -butadienylamine (DBA) to dehydroaromatic interme-diates, generated from some aromatic halo ethers and sulfides, was investigated. The primary Diels-Alder adducts lose diethylamine and <b>aromatize.</b> The same reaction using 4 -chlorobiphenyl (1 h), N,N-dimethyl-p-bromoaniline(li) or 9 -bromophenanthrene(1 j) was also investigated...|$|R
25|$|In primates, the {{developmental}} influence of androgens is less clear, {{and the consequences}} are less understood. Within the brain, testosterone is <b>aromatized</b> to (estradiol), which is the principal active hormone for developmental influences. The human testis secretes high levels of testosterone from about week 8 of fetal life until 5–6 months after birth (a similar perinatal surge in testosterone is observed in many species), a process that appears to underlie the male phenotype. Estrogen from the maternal circulation is relatively ineffective, {{partly because of the}} high circulating levels of steroid-binding proteins in pregnancy.|$|E
25|$|NET and {{its major}} active {{metabolite}} 5α-DHNET {{have been found}} to act as irreversible aromatase inhibitors (Ki = 1.7μM and 9.0μM, respectively). However, like the case of 5α-reductase, the concentrations required are probably too high to be clinically relevant at typical dosages. 5α-DHNET specifically has been assessed and found to be selective in its inhibition of aromatase, and does not affect cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme (P450scc), 17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase, 21-hydroxylase, or 11β-hydroxylase. Since it is not <b>aromatized</b> (and hence cannot be transformed into an estrogenic metabolite), unlike NET, 5α-DHNET has been proposed as a potential therapeutic agent in the treatment of ER-positive breast cancer.|$|E
25|$|Transgender men {{who have}} been oophorectomized must {{continue}} androgen therapy to avoid premature osteoporosis. Estrogen supplementation is theoretically not usually necessary, as some of the injected testosterone will be <b>aromatized</b> into estrogen sufficient to maintain bone (as it does in cisgender men). However, a single small study of trans men after oophorectomy demonstrated that androgens alone may be insufficient to retard bone loss. (van Kesteren P, et al. “Long-term follow-up of bone mineral density and bone metabolism in transsexuals treated with cross-sex hormones.” Clin Endocrin. 48(3):347-54. 1998.) It is likely the case that pre-oophorectomy, residual estrogen production is protective. However, after oophorectomy, some trans men may have insufficient estrogen to retard bone loss.|$|E
40|$|Legumes are dried {{to improve}} their conservation. The paper proposes a new {{alternative}} re-hydration method for dried legumes. The use of the rapid solid liquid dynamic extraction with the Naviglio extractor technology is proposed and used. The procedure allows to fast re hydrate and <b>aromatize</b> dried legumes...|$|R
50|$|The {{first two}} step involve the {{reaction}} of the α-bromo-acetophenone with molecules of aniline to form intermediate 4. The charged aniline forms a decent enough leaving group for an electrophilic cyclization to form intermediate 5, which quickly <b>aromatizes</b> and tautomerizes to give the desired indole 7.|$|R
50|$|Brus da ricotta is {{a version}} without wine or grappa {{which is made}} {{in various parts of}} Piedmont by fermenting sheep’s milk ricotta cheese for a month or more, and <b>aromatizing</b> with chilli or black pepper. It has been {{recognized}} as a “traditional Piedmontese product” by the regional government.|$|R
25|$|Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) (referred to as {{androstanolone}} or stanolone {{when used}} medically) {{can also be}} used in place of testosterone as an androgen. The availability of DHT is limited; it is not available in the United States or Canada, for instance, but it is available in certain European countries, including the United Kingdom, France, Spain, Belgium, Italy, and Luxembourg. DHT is available in formulations including topical gel, buccal or sublingual tablets, and as esters in oil for intramuscular injection. Relative to testosterone, and similarly to many synthetic AAS, DHT has the potential advantages of not being locally potentiated in so-called androgenic tissues that express 5α-reductase (as DHT is already 5α-reduced) and of not being <b>aromatized</b> into an estrogen (it is not a substrate for aromatase).|$|E
25|$|Synthetic anabolic–androgenic steroids (AAS), like {{nandrolone}} (as an ester like nandrolone decanoate or nandrolone phenylpropionate), are agonists of the {{androgen receptor}} (AR) similarly to testosterone {{but are not}} usually used in HRT for transgender men or for androgen replacement therapy (ART) in cisgender men. However, {{they can be used}} in place of testosterone with similar effects, and can have certain advantages like less or no local potentiation in so-called androgenic tissues that express 5α-reductase like the skin and hair follicles (which results in a reduced rate of skin and hair-related side effects like acne, oily skin, seborrhea, excessive body hair growth, and, in particular, male-pattern baldness), although this can also be disadvantageous in a few aspects of masculinization (specifically facial hair growth, body hair growth, and clitoral enlargement). Although many AAS are not potentiated in androgenic tissues, they have similar effects to testosterone in other tissues like bone, muscle, fat, and the voice box. Also, many AAS, like nandrolone esters, are <b>aromatized</b> into estrogens to a greatly reduced extent relative to testosterone or not at all, and for this reason, are associated with reduced or no estrogenic effects (e.g., gynecomastia). AAS that are 17α-alkylated like methyltestosterone, oxandrolone, and stanozolol are orally active but carry a high risk of liver damage, whereas AAS that are not 17α-alkylated, like nandrolone esters, must be administered by intramuscular injection (via which they act as long-lasting depots similarly to testosterone esters) but have no more risk of liver damage than does testosterone.|$|E

25|$|Varieties of bariis (rice), {{the most}} popular {{probably}} being basmati, usually act as the main dish. Spices including cumin, cardamom, cloves, cinnamon and garden sage are used to <b>aromatize</b> these different rice dishes. Somalis serve dinner as late as 9 pm.

2500|$|Non {{aromatic}} rings can be <b>aromatized</b> {{through a}} variety of simple transformations. [...] Dehydration allows the Semmler-Wolff transformation of 2-cyclohexenone oxime to aniline under acidic conditions. [...] In applying redox processes, [...] 2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyano-1,4-benzoquinone (DDQ) and an acid catalyst has been used to synthesise a steroid with a phenanthrene core by oxidatation accompanied by a double methyl migration. [...] In the process, DDQ is itself reduced into an aromatic hydroquinone product.|$|E
2500|$|The {{bones and}} the brain are two {{important}} tissues in humans where the primary effect of testosterone is by way of aromatization to estradiol. In the bones, estradiol accelerates ossification of cartilage into bone, leading to closure of the epiphyses and conclusion of growth. In the central nervous system, testosterone is <b>aromatized</b> to estradiol. Estradiol rather than testosterone serves {{as the most important}} feedback signal to the hypothalamus (especially affecting LH secretion).

2500|$|The gonads {{in these}} women are not ovaries, but instead, are testes; during the {{embryonic}} stage of development, testes form in an androgen-independent process that occurs due {{to the influence of}} the SRY gene on the Y chromosome. [...] They may be located intra-abdominally, at the internal inguinal ring, or may herniate into the labia majora, often leading to the discovery of the condition. [...] Testes in affected women {{have been found to be}} atrophic upon gonadectomy. [...] Testosterone produced by the testes cannot be directly used due to the mutant androgen receptor that characterizes CAIS; instead, it is <b>aromatized</b> into estrogen, which effectively feminizes the body and accounts for the normal female phenotype observed in CAIS.|$|E
50|$|This enzyme {{belongs to}} the family of oxidoreductases, {{specifically}} those acting on the CH-CH group of donor with other acceptors. The systematic name of this enzyme class is cyclohexa-1,5-diene-1-carbonyl-CoA:acceptor oxidoreductase (<b>aromatizing,</b> ATP-forming). This enzyme is also called benzoyl-CoA reductase (dearomatizing). This enzyme participates in benzoate degradation via coa ligation. It has 2 cofactors: manganese, and Magnesium.|$|R
40|$|Summary. Granulosa {{cells were}} {{aspirated}} 3 =n-h before the expected time of ovulation from 10 follicles of 4 patients treated with gonadotrophins: 4 of the follicles were immediately preovulatory. The granulosa cells were cultured for 10 h with 17 =ahydroxy-pregnenolone or dehydroepiandrosterone and samples of medium removed at 3 and 10 h were assayed for 6 steroids. Granulosa cells {{were unable to}} synthesize androgens from endogenous substrate or undertake conversions via the =D pathway, but cells from all follicles were capable of <b>aromatizing</b> exogenous androgens to oestrogens although this capability was reduced in cells from follicles beginning to luteinize. Granulosa cells from preovulatory follicles synthesized more progesterone from endogenous substrate than cells from follicles which had not begun to luteinize.

50|$|Carbonyl ylides can be {{synthesized}} by acid catalysis of hydroxy-3-pyrones in {{the absence}} of a metal catalyst. An initial tautomerization occurs, followed by elimination of the leaving group to <b>aromatize</b> the pyrone ring and to generate the carbonyl ylide. A cycloaddition reaction with a dipolarophile lastly forms the oxacycle. This approach is less widely employed due to its limited utility and requirement for pyrone skeletons.|$|R
