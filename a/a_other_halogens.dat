50|$|The {{mechanism}} for iodination is slightly different: iodine (I2) is treated with an oxidizing agent such as nitric acid {{to obtain the}} electrophilic iodine (2 I+). Unlike the <b>other</b> <b>halogens,</b> iodine does not serve as a base since it is positive. In one study the iodinization reagent {{is a mixture of}} iodine and iodic acid.|$|R
25|$|The carbon–fluorine bond {{is one of}} {{the strongest}} in organic {{chemistry}} (an average bond energy around 480 kJ/mol). This is significantly stronger than the bonds of carbon with <b>other</b> <b>halogens</b> (<b>an</b> average bond energy of e.g. C-Cl bond is around 320 kJ/mol) and {{is one of the}} reasons why fluoroorganic compounds have high thermal and chemical stability.|$|R

50|$|Lastly, halogens {{could also}} move into and {{stabilize}} a vinyl cation system. In {{the reaction of}} 5-chloropentyne with trifluoroacetic acid, there is simultaneous protonation and 1,4-shift of chlorine that forms a bridge cyclic structure across four carbons. Trifluoracetic acid subsequently attacks the intermediate from the terminal end to form 2-chloropent-4-enyl trifluoroacetate. This phenomenon is also observed in <b>other</b> <b>halogens.</b> For instance, fluoroalkynes can form a product with two adducts.|$|R

50|$|The {{molecule}} has bond {{lengths of}} xenon to fluorine 1.992 Å, xenon to oxygen 2.126 Å, xenon bonded oxygen to nitrogen 1.36 <b>Å,</b> and <b>other</b> nitrate oxygen bonds are 1.199 (cis) and 1.224 Å (trans). The bond angles are FXeO 177.6°, XeON 114.7°, (Xe)ONO 114.5° (cis), other (Xe)ONO 118.4° (trans) and (non-Xe)ONO is 127.1°. The bond lengths and angles on the xenon atom {{are similar to}} that in FXeOSO2F and FXeOTeF5 indicating a polar oxygen bond. The Xe-O-N angle is larger than halogen nitrates, which indicates a lower bond density for Xe-O bond. N-Ocis bond length is longer than the N-Otrans bond length, the opposite to <b>other</b> <b>halogen</b> nitrates.|$|R
50|$|Iodine {{is found}} on Earth mainly as the highly {{water-soluble}} iodide I−, which concentrates it in oceans and brine pools. Like the <b>other</b> <b>halogens,</b> free iodine occurs mainly as a diatomic molecule I2, {{and then only}} momentarily after being oxidized from iodide by an oxidant like free oxygen. In the universe and on Earth, iodine's high atomic number makes it a relatively rare element. However, its presence in ocean water has given it a role in biology (see below).|$|R
50|$|The interhalogens of form XY have {{physical}} properties intermediate between {{those of the}} two parent halogens. The covalent bond between the two atoms has some ionic character, the less electronegative halogen, X, being oxidised and having a partial positive charge. All combinations of fluorine, chlorine, bromine, and iodine that have the above-mentioned general formula are known, but not all are stable. Some combinations of astatine with <b>other</b> <b>halogens</b> are not even known, {{and those that are}} known are highly unstable.|$|R
30|$|Metallic {{radionuclides}} represent {{very important}} tools in nuclear medicine – both in non-invasive molecular imaging (SPECT, PET) and for radiotherapy; cf. the systematic use of e.g. 111 In for SPECT, 68 Ga for PET, 90 Y and several lanthanide radioisotopes for therapy. Compared to radiopharmaceutical synthesis with non-metallic radionuclides such as e.g. 11 C, 18 F and <b>other</b> <b>halogens,</b> synthesis with radiometals are {{in most cases}} easier to perform and may approach kit-type protocols - as well known for 99 mTc, the “working horse” of nuclear medicine.|$|R
40|$|The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is {{considering}} {{the use of}} iodine for disinfection of recycled wastewater and potable water in the International Space Station. Like chlorine and <b>other</b> <b>halogen</b> compounds, iodine can form disinfection by-products (DBPs) {{in the presence of}} organic compounds. Recycled wastewater sources proposed for reuse in the space station include laundry, urine, and humidity condensate. These contain large concentrations of iodine-demanding compounds, including phenol (Barkely et al., 1992). Therefore, the potential formation for iodine disinfection byproducts (IDBPs) is of concern...|$|R
50|$|In the {{electron}} capture mode, the PDD is a selective detector for monitoring high electron affinity compounds such as freons, chlorinated pesticides, and <b>other</b> <b>halogen</b> compounds. For {{this type of}} compound, the minimum detectable quantity (MDQ) is at the femtogram (10-15) or picogram (10-12) level. The PDD is similar in sensitivity and response characteristics to a conventional radioactive ECD, and can be operated at temperatures up to 400°C. For operation in this mode, He and CH4 are introduced just upstream from the column exit.|$|R
5|$|Atmospheric {{passivation}} gives titanium excellent {{resistance to}} corrosion, almost equivalent to platinum. Titanium {{is capable of}} withstanding attack by dilute sulfuric and hydrochloric acids, chloride solutions, and most organic acids. However, titanium is corroded by concentrated acids. As indicated by its negative redox potential, titanium is thermodynamically a very reactive metal that burns in normal atmosphere at lower temperatures than the melting point. Melting is possible only in an inert atmosphere or in a vacuum. At , it combines with chlorine. It also reacts with the <b>other</b> <b>halogens</b> and absorbs hydrogen.|$|R
40|$|A structure–activity {{relationship}} study {{concerning the}} antibacterial properties of several halogen-substituted tricyclic sulfur-containing flavonoids has been performed. The compounds have been synthesized by cyclocondensation of the corresponding 3 -dithiocarbamic flavanones under acidic conditions. The influence of different halogen substituents on the antibacterial properties {{has been tested}} against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. Amongst the N, N -dialkylamino-substituted flavonoids, those having an N, N -diethylamino moiety exhibited good to excellent antimicrobial properties against both pathogens. Fluorine-substituted flavonoids {{were found to be}} less active than those bearing <b>other</b> <b>halogen</b> atoms...|$|R
50|$|Partially {{fluorinated}} alkanes are the hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). Substituting <b>other</b> <b>halogens</b> {{in combination}} with fluorine gives rise to chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) or bromofluorocarbons (BFCs) and the like (if some hydrogen is retained, HCFCs and the like). Properties depend on the number and identity of the halogen atoms. In general, the boiling points are even more elevated by combination of halogen atoms because the varying size and charge of different halogens allows more intermolecular attractions. As with fluorocarbons, chlorofluorocarbons and bromofluorocarbons are not flammable: {{they do not have}} carbon-hydrogen bonds to react and released halides quench flames.|$|R
5000|$|In recent decades, the {{existence}} of the infrared atmospheric window has become threatened by the development of highly unreactive gases containing bonds between fluorine and either carbon or sulfur. The [...] "stretching frequencies" [...] of bonds between fluorine and other light nonmetals are such that strong absorption in the atmospheric window will always be characteristic of compounds containing such bonds. This absorption is strengthened because these bonds are highly polar due to the extreme electronegativity of the fluorine atom. Bonds to <b>other</b> <b>halogens</b> also absorb in the atmospheric window, though much less strongly.|$|R

2500|$|Sir Humphry Davy {{originally}} {{suggested the}} name fluorine, taking the root from {{the name of}} [...] "fluoric acid" [...] and the -ine suffix, similarly to <b>other</b> <b>halogens.</b> This name, with modifications, came to most European languages. (Greek, Russian, and several other languages use the name ftor or derivatives, which was suggested by Ampère and comes from the Greek φθόριος (phthorios), meaning [...] "destructive".) The New Latin name (fluorum) gave the element its current symbol, F, although the symbol Fl {{has been used in}} early papers. [...] The symbol Fl is now used for the super-heavy element flerovium.|$|R
40|$|Weak {{interactions}} involving fluorine {{have been}} analyzed {{in the structure}} of 6 -methoxy- 1, 2 -diphenyl- 1, 2, 3, 4 -tetrahydroisoquinoline with fluorine substitution at para-, meta- and ortho- positions, respectively, on the 1 -phenyl ring. The packing modes in the crystalline lattice as determined by X-ray diffraction techniques generate motifs via F···F, C-H···F and C-F···π interactions. The three structures as compared to the parent compound depict conformational changes in the saturated tetrahydroisoquinoline moiety. The salient features of the four structures in terms of weak interactions involving fluorine suggest that organic fluorine does resemble the <b>other</b> <b>halogens...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{formation}} of a halogen bonded self-assembled co-crystal physisorbed monolayer containing N⋯Br interactions is reported for the first time.

Density functional theory (DFT) calculations are also employed to assess the magnitudes of the different interactions in the layer. Significantly, compared to <b>other</b> <b>halogen</b> bonds in physisorbed monolayers we have reported recently, the N⋯Br bond here {{is found to be}} non-linear. It is proposed that the increasing importance of the lateral hydrogen bond interactions, relative to the halogen bond strength, leads to the bending of the halogen bonds...|$|R
