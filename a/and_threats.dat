40|$|Introduction There is some {{contention}} {{within the}} existing literature examining Challenge <b>and</b> <b>Threat</b> in a sport context. It is suggested that Challenge <b>and</b> <b>Threat</b> can be experienced simultaneously (Cerin, 2003; Meijen et al, 2013); however this has been seldom examined. Based upon the suggestions of The Theory of Challenge <b>and</b> <b>Threat</b> in Athletes model (TCTSA; Jones et al, 2009) Challenge <b>and</b> <b>Threat</b> result in differing sport performance and have an impact upon emotions experienced. Challenge <b>and</b> <b>Threat</b> self-report was examined alongside shooting performance and emotions. Methodology One hundred and two participants (mean age= 26. 82, SD= 10. 01) were recruited for the study. A quasi-experimental study was implemented. Self-report of Challenge <b>and</b> <b>Threat</b> were collected alongside emotions via the Sport Emotion Questionnaire (Jones et al, 2005) with reference to a shooting task. Results There was {{a significant proportion of}} variance accounted for by Challenge and shooting performance (R²=. 42, p< 0. 05). As Challenge report increased, shooting performance decreased (ß=-. 204, p< 0. 05). Moreover, when Challenge <b>and</b> <b>Threat</b> patterns were examined, the analysis indicated that moderate Challenge/low Threat had a more facilitative performance in the shooting task (Mean= 7. 96, SD= 1. 49) compared to all of the other combinations of Challenge <b>and</b> <b>Threat</b> patterns. In regards to emotion moderate Challenge/low Threat reported lower amounts of happiness (mean= 1. 32, SD=. 88) and excitement (mean 1. 42, SD= 68) <b>and</b> moderate Challenge/moderate <b>Threat</b> reported more anxiety (mean= 2. 05, SD=. 69) than all of the other group combinations. Conclusion The study support suggestions that patterns of Challenge <b>and</b> <b>Threat</b> can have an impact upon performance, moreover emotions also differ between different patterns of Challenge <b>and</b> <b>Threat.</b> Future research should examine patterns of Challenge <b>and</b> <b>Threat</b> <b>and</b> the potential impact this has upon central tenants of the TCTSA model for example control. This study has implications for application to the applied field as the influence of Challenge <b>and</b> <b>Threat</b> has been shown to have an impact upon sporting performance...|$|R
40|$|Purpose of Study: Several {{studies have}} {{examined}} challenge <b>and</b> <b>threat</b> via specific cardiovascular parameters in relation to sporting performance. However, limited evidence exists that utilises self-report measures of challenge <b>and</b> <b>threat</b> <b>and</b> the impact upon sport performance. The {{aim of this study}} was to examine self-report of challenge <b>and</b> <b>threat</b> <b>and</b> its association with shooting performance. Methodology: One hundred and two participants (Mean age= 26. 82, SD= 10. 01) were recruited for the study. A quasi-experimental study was implemented to explore the association between self-report measures of challenge <b>and</b> <b>threat</b> <b>and</b> its relationship with shooting performance. Cardiovascular (CV) parameters recorded during the experiment included cardiac output and total peripheral resistance due to their association with challenge <b>and</b> <b>threat.</b> Results: There was a significant proportion of variance accounted for by challenge and shooting performance (R²=. 42, p< 0. 05). As challenge report increased, shooting performance decreased (ß=-. 204, p< 0. 05). Moreover, when challenge <b>and</b> <b>threat</b> patterns were examined, the analysis indicated that moderate challenge/low threat had a more facilitative performance in the shooting task (Mean= 7. 96, SD= 1. 49) compared to all of the other combinations of challenge <b>and</b> <b>threat</b> patterns. In regard to CV measures, there was no significant associations observed between challenge <b>and</b> <b>threat</b> or shooting performance (p< 0. 05). Discussion and Conclusion: Higher levels of challenge are not ideal when completing a discrete motor skill task, such as shooting. These findings appear to suggest that a combination of moderate challenge <b>and</b> low <b>threat</b> may elicit a facilitative performance in regards to a discrete motor skill...|$|R

40|$|The aims of this {{research}} programme were to a. Further examine and develop an existing self-report measure of Challenge <b>and</b> <b>Threat</b> within a sport context, b. Examine Challenge <b>and</b> <b>Threat</b> self-report with performance in a sport context, c. Further examine the Biopsychosocial Model (BPSM) proposed in relation to Challenge <b>and</b> <b>Threat</b> <b>and</b> sport performance, d. Examine the associations between Challenge, <b>Threat,</b> cortisol response <b>and</b> sport performance, e. Examine self-report of emotions direction and intensity experienced during a sport performance in regard to Challenge <b>and</b> <b>Threat</b> <b>and</b> f. Examine Challenge <b>and</b> <b>Threat</b> in combination {{with each other in}} regard to sport performance. These 6 aims were addressed in 3 different empirical studies. Study 1 used a cross sectional study design to explore the validity and reliability of an existing self-report measure of Challenge <b>and</b> <b>Threat.</b> Participants were gym users (n= 200, Mage= 24. 91) and asked to complete the self-report measure before a dart-throwing competition. Study 2 comprised of three different stages. Stage 1; a cross sectional study design to examine the content validity of a pool of existing self-report items to measure Challenge <b>and</b> <b>Threat</b> in a range of athletes (n= 25, Mage= 22. 00). Participants comprised of male and female athletes engaged in various sports (football, n= 6, cricket, n= 2, swimming, n= 5, tennis, n= 1, rugby, n= 6, netball, n= 3, basketball, n= 2.). Stage 2, used a cross sectional study design to further examine the construct validity of the remaining items from stage 1. This stage used principle components analysis (PCA) to determine whether Challenge <b>and</b> <b>Threat</b> self-report items were grouped in a particular way (Kline, 1994). Participants were competitive runners (n= 197, Mage= 37. 11) and asked to complete the self-report measure regarding Challenge <b>and</b> <b>Threat</b> before competition. Stage 3 used a cross sectional study design to explore the validity and reliability of the self-report measure of Challenge <b>and</b> <b>Threat</b> developed in stages 1 - 2 in competitive runners (n= 147, Mage = 30. 06), using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to examine how well the data total fitted the proposed hypothetical model. Finally a quasi-experimental study (study 3) examined the association between Challenge <b>and</b> <b>Threat</b> <b>and</b> shooting performance. This study explored the Challenge <b>and</b> <b>Threat</b> self-report measure <b>and</b> its relationship with performance, emotions and physiological responses. Participants in this study comprised of university student and staff members (n= 102, Mage = 27. 11). Results from study 1 suggested that the existing self-report measure of Challenge <b>and</b> <b>Threat</b> utilised was not suitable for use within a sport context. Results from study 2, stage 1, revealed a pool of self-report items that athletes described as applicable and relevant to their sports performance. Results from study 2, stage 2, suggested that items identified in study 2, stage 1 represented a two component solution, one associated with <b>Threat</b> <b>and</b> the other Challenge. Results from study 2, stage 3 suggested that a 12 item self-report measure was suitable for use within a sport context and that Challenge has a positive association with sport performance. Finally, study 3, suggested that the self-report measure of Challenge <b>and</b> <b>Threat</b> developed in study 2 (stages 1 - 3) was suitable for use within a sport context. Results from study 3 also suggest that a mixture of Challenge <b>and</b> <b>Threat</b> can have implications for performance outcome. Emotions reported were shown to have associations with Challenge <b>and</b> <b>Threat</b> self-report, as suggested by The Theory of Challenge <b>and</b> <b>Threat</b> States in Athletes (TCTSA). The study findings showed that physiological associations with Challenge <b>and</b> <b>Threat</b> were equivocal. Limitations to the present research programme and directions for future research are discussed...|$|R
40|$|In {{the current}} {{functional}} MRI study, we investigated interactions between reward <b>and</b> <b>threat</b> processing. Visual cues {{at the start}} of each trial informed participants about the chance of winning monetary reward and/or receiving a mild aversive shock. We tested two competing hypothesis: according to the salience hypothesis, in the condition involving both reward <b>and</b> <b>threat,</b> enhanced activation would be observed because of increased salience; according to the competition hypothesis, the processing of reward <b>and</b> <b>threat</b> would trade-off against each other, leading to reduced activation. Analysis of skin conductance data during a delay phase revealed an interaction between reward <b>and</b> <b>threat</b> processing, such that the effect of reward was reduced during <b>threat</b> <b>and</b> the effect of threat was reduced during reward. Analysis of imaging data during the same task phase revealed inter-actions between reward <b>and</b> <b>threat</b> processing in several regions, including the midbrain/ventral tegmental area, caudate, putamen, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, anterior insula, middle frontal gyrus and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex. Taken together, our findings reveal conditions during which reward <b>and</b> <b>threat</b> trade-off against each other across multiple sites. Such interactions are suggestive of competitive processes and may reflect the organization of opponent systems in the brain...|$|R
40|$|Objectives This study {{examined}} the relationship between the cognitive and affective components of the theory of challenge <b>and</b> <b>threat</b> states in athletes (TCTSA). It was expected that cognitive components, specifically self-efficacy, perceived control, and achievement goals, predict challenge <b>and</b> <b>threat</b> appraisals <b>and</b> emotional states, as well as the interpretation of emotional state. Design A cross-sectional design was employed to measure self-efficacy, perceived control, achievement goals, emotional state, interpretation of emotional state, <b>and</b> challenge <b>and</b> <b>threat</b> cognitive appraisal in relation to how participants typically approach an important competition. Method 177 collegiate athletes completed questionnaires measuring the cognitive and affective components of challenge <b>and</b> <b>threat</b> states. Results A regression analysis was performed to examine if cognitive elements predicted challenge <b>and</b> <b>threat</b> appraisals <b>and</b> emotions. <b>Threat</b> appraisal was predicted by avoidance goals and emotions were predicted by cognitive components. There was a negative association between anxiety and self-efficacy and a positive association between anxiety and avoidance goals. Also, differences between challenge <b>and</b> <b>threat</b> appraisal patterns (high challenge/high threat, high challenge/low threat, low challenge/high threat, low challenge/low threat) were analysed. Participants with a high challenge <b>and</b> low <b>threat</b> appraisals pattern scored higher on self-efficacy and lower on avoidance goals and anxiety than other challenge/threat patterns. Conclusions The results provide support for the TCTSA. What athletes think, based on their cognitive components, influences the emotions they experience, and their approaches to competition...|$|R

5|$|Despite the {{favorable}} economic development, the military potential of 16th century Poland was modest {{in relation to}} the challenges <b>and</b> <b>threats</b> coming from several directions, which included the Ottoman Empire, the Teutonic state, the Habsburgs, and Muscovy. Given the declining military value and willingness of pospolite ruszenie, the bulk of the forces available consisted of professional and mercenary soldiers. Their number and provision depended on szlachta-approved funding (self-imposed taxation and other sources) and tended to be insufficient for any combination of adversaries. The quality of the forces and their command was good, as demonstrated by victories against a seemingly overwhelming enemy. The attainment of strategic objectives was supported by a well-developed service of knowledgeable diplomats and emissaries. Because of the limited resources at the state's disposal, the Jagiellonian Poland had to concentrate on the area most crucial for its security and economic interests, which was the strengthening of Poland's position along the Baltic coast.|$|E

5|$|Symmetry has {{a variety}} of causes. Radial {{symmetry}} suits organisms like sea anemones whose adults do not move: food <b>and</b> <b>threats</b> may arrive from any direction.

The head becomes specialised with a mouth and sense organs (cephalisation), and the body becomes bilaterally symmetric (though internal organs need not be). More puzzling is the reason for the fivefold (pentaradiate) symmetry of the echinoderms. Early echinoderms were bilaterally symmetrical, as their larvae still are. Sumrall and Wray argue that the loss of the old symmetry had both developmental and ecological causes.|$|E

5|$|The {{massacre}} at Kraljevo, {{as well as}} a similar and nearly concurrent massacre in nearby Kragujevac, was met with outrage by the Serbian puppet government, which responded with pleas, interventions <b>and</b> <b>threats</b> of resignation. The killings led German military commanders in Serbia to question the efficacy of mass reprisal shootings, as they pushed thousands of Serbs into the hands of anti-German guerrillas. The killing of airplane factory workers in Kraljevo convinced the OKW that arbitrary shootings of Serbs not only incurred a significant political cost but were also counterproductive. The ratio of 100executions for one soldier killed and 50executions for one soldier wounded was reduced by half in February 1943, and removed altogether that autumn. Henceforth, each individual execution had to be approved by Special Envoy Hermann Neubacher.|$|E

Sigismund attempted to break the Polish–Lithuanian alliance by offering Vytautas a king's crown; Vytautas's acceptance would have violated the terms of the Ostrów Agreement and created Polish-Lithuanian discord.

5|$|Daphnomeles {{participated in}} the {{subsequent}} conflicts against Tsar Samuel, but his greatest feat was the capture of the Bulgarian leader Ibatzes in 1018, {{for which he is}} given a prominent position in Skylitzes's work. Following the defeat at the Battle of Kleidion in 1015, Bulgarian resistance began to collapse. By 1018, most Bulgarian commanders had surrendered, and only Ibatzes, who had retreated with his followers to the royal estate of Pronista, a naturally strong and defensible highland position, continued to resist. He rejected both bribes <b>and</b> <b>threats</b> from the Byzantines, and for 55 days, the Byzantine army under Emperor Basil II remained encamped at Deabolis nearby, waiting for his surrender. At that point, and as local crowds gathered to Ibatzes's palace for the feast of the Dormition, Daphnomeles, now strategos of nearby Achrida, on his own initiative, resolved to end the impasse. With only two escorts, he climbed the way to the estate, and announced himself to Ibatzes. Ibatzes, believing that Daphnomeles would not have come alone unless he intended to forge an alliance against Basil, retreated with the strategos to a secluded wooded glade in the gardens for a private discussion. There, Daphnomeles and his two hidden associates sprang on the Bulgarian general, blinded him, and carried him to the upper story of the palace, through the assembled crowds who were too stunned to react. When the Bulgarians recovered, they gathered underneath the building crying for revenge. Daphnomeles, however, addressed them and managed to convince them of the futility of further resistance, and to lay down their arms and seek the emperor's pardon.|$|E
