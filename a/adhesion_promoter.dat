Ni-stearate and resorsynol-formaldehyde resin combined with hexamethylenetetramine in various mass ratios were included as <b>adhesion</b> <b>promoters.</b> Elastomer mixtures were prepared using a laboratory double mill, and the rheological and vulcanization characteristics were examined on a vulcameter provided with an oscillating disc, a higher temperature of 145 °C. The crosslinking of the mixture was carried out by press, at a temperature of 145 °C and specific pressure of 40 bar, in period of 45 minutes. A wide number of standardized methods for physical mechanical characterization of vulcanization prior and after accelerated aging were used. The adhesion of vulcanizate bond with zinc coated steel cord was determined according to the so called H-test, by measuring the pulling-out force of the cord from the vulcanized block, and the degree of coverage of cord with vulcanizate after separation. The results of examinations show significant dependence of physico-mechanical characteristics and adhesion forces on the type and amount of used <b>adhesion</b> <b>promoters</b> in experimental elastomer mixtures...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} new <b>promoters</b> on the <b>adhesion</b> of elastic and {{strength}} properties unfilled elastomeric compositions based on synthetic isoprene rubber SKI- 3 {{and also on}} the structure of their vulcanizates are investigated. Synthesized <b>adhesion</b> <b>promoters</b> constitute silica fillers modified with cobalt, nickel, and a combination of cobalt and nickel. They contain on the surface a reduced number (compared with industrial stearate, cobalt) ions of metals of variable valence. Tests are carried out to determine the dependency of changes of the tensile strength, the elongation at break and the density of the crosslinking of rubbers on dosages of the investigated <b>adhesion</b> <b>promoters</b> and amounts of metal ions on their surface. The effect of type and dosage of the synthesized <b>promoters</b> of <b>adhesion</b> of rubber to steel brassedcord on heat aging resistance of elastomeric compositions are established. It is established that the vulcanizates containing synthesized <b>adhesion</b> <b>promoters</b> have greater high temperatures resistance as compared with the rubber materials containing industrial cobalt stearate. Increasing dosages of modified silica acid fillers in elastomeric compositions, quantity of metals on their surface leads to the decrease of the resistance of vulcanizates to heat ageing. While Nickel ions have less oxidation effect on rubber, compared to cobalt ions that may be due to their lesser activity It is determined that the introduction of <b>adhesion</b> <b>promoters</b> leads to the formation of additional cross-linking. It is revealed that use the mineral promoters in the elastomeric compositions affects less the density of cross-linkage of rubber after heat aging as compared with the cobalt stearate. When administered in an elastomeric composition the silica modified nickel, increasing the crosslinking density of rubber upon exposure to elevated temperatures was observed...|$|R

50|$|Polymeric {{surfaces}} generally only possess dispersion forces but {{may contain}} functional groups able to bond to adhesion promoters. If parylene is bonded to {{a printed circuit}} board (PCB) then often the mechanical tie-points allow parylene to exhibit good adhesion as opposed to bonding through covalent links (chemical bonding). Sometimes plasma methods are effective in the promotion of adhesion between parylene and polymeric surfaces but these techniques are not trivial to employ. The third surface, metal-oxide forming surfaces, generally possess a hydroxyl-terminated surface, M-OH, where M is a metal such as aluminum or chromium. This termination group has the ability to react with commercially available silanes such as A-174 (methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane), which is the common <b>adhesion</b> <b>promoter</b> for the parylene polymers.|$|E

40|$|The {{ability of}} {{waterborne}} coatings {{to adhere to}} polypropylene-based substrates is a challenge in the automotive industry. This thesis seeks to explore novel methods to improve the adhesion and provide coated substrates of an industrial standard. Two methods are explored, whereby a physical entanglement method {{is found to be}} unsuccessful but a chemical bonding method is found to give patentable results. It is found that the UV curing of carbene precursors as candidate adhesion promoters, gives an adhesive force which is comparable to the industrial state of the art method, flaming. Initially, the UV energy initiates CH insertion reactions, which covalently graft the <b>adhesion</b> <b>promoter</b> to the polypropylene surface. Secondly, the hydrophilic functional groups of the <b>adhesion</b> <b>promoter</b> adhere to the waterborne basecoat, thus optimal adhesion is achieved. Statistical modelling of the results reveals that the adhesive strength depends on the UV intensity, the <b>adhesion</b> <b>promoter</b> concentration and functional group type. To explore the industrial applicability, the safety and stability during storage and the aesthetics of the adhesion promoters were investigated. This research is the first step to developing a formulation that is able to replace the current flaming method...|$|E

40|$|<b>Adhesion</b> <b>promoters</b> are {{traditionally}} {{used to improve}} the durability between an adhesive or any other organic phase, such as a sealant or a paint, and a metallic substrate. There are {{many different types of}} molecules which will act as <b>adhesion</b> <b>promoters,</b> but one class which has attracted considerable attention is that based on the organosilanes, such as y-aminotriethoxysilane, or y-glycidoxypropyl trimethoxysilane. Applications of such <b>adhesion</b> <b>promoters</b> {{are to be found in}} sealants, rubbers, primers in packaging and primers for coatings and adhesives. Organosilanes as <b>adhesion</b> <b>promoters</b> are widely used in industry, and until recently have been included in adhesive formulations in an empirical way, because it has been observed that the adhesive properties and hydrolytic stability can be improved. However recent work is leading to an understanding of how the silane molecules specifically interact with metallic and inorganic substrates. Little is known at the present time regarding the mode of operation of such molecules when applied to polymeric substrates. The purpose of the current work was to probe interaction of these molecules with low energy polymer substrates, for example, poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and poly(ethylene terephalate) (PET), using surface analysis techniques. Two factors which have been identified as controlling the adsorption of the organosilanes onto low energy substrates are the solution chemistry and the surface energy of the polymer. Both have been investigated extensively within this project. The latter was identified by means of investigating a series of substrates, with increasing polar contribution towards the surface free energy. The highest polar component was displayed by corona treated PET, which also displayed the highest levels of adsorption of organosilanes. Investigation of the adsorbed layer of the organosilane on the corona discharge treated PET has led to an understanding of the mechanism of the interaction of the molecules with all of the low energy substrates, and models for such interactions are proposed on the basis of spectroscopic observations...|$|R
40|$|Robust {{adhesion}} of polymers {{is necessary}} for applications in many industries; however, adhesion is poorly understood on a molecular level. Here, a surface and interface-sensitive nonlinear optical technique, sum frequency generation (SFG) vibrational spectroscopy was used to study polymer adhesive surfaces and polymer/adhesive interfaces {{to gain a better}} understanding of polymer adhesion mechanisms. Silane <b>adhesion</b> <b>promoters</b> are often used to enhance the adhesion of elastomeric materials to polymer substrates. The interfacial structures of a known silane adhesion promoting mixture at polymer/liquid, silicone elastomer/liquid and polymer/silicone elastomer buried interfaces were studied with SFG and correlated to adhesion testing results. The silane <b>adhesion</b> <b>promoters</b> exhibited orientational order at all buried interfaces, implying that interfacial ordering of silane <b>adhesion</b> <b>promoters</b> may be necessary to enhance <b>adhesion.</b> Silane <b>adhesion</b> <b>promoters</b> cannot be used in microfluidics fabrication. In these applications, surface treatments are used to oxidize the silicone surface prior to adhesion, but due to hydrophohbic recovery these effects are temporary. Hydrophobic recovery can be slowed by removing extractable short chain oligomers from the silicone bulk. SFG analysis of silicone surfaces before and after extractable materials were removed showed that the silicone surface methyl group orientation changed after extractions. Also, the surface flattened after extractable materials were removed. These changes in surface structure may slow hydrophobic recovery, and therefore improve adhesion enhancement by oxidative surface treatments. Lastly, the adhesion of a different class of polymer adhesives, epoxy resins, was investigated. Epoxy resins are used as underfills in flip-chip devices, and adhesion failure of underfills can cause the flip-chip device to fail. Here, SFG was used to study the surface structures of model epoxy compounds before cure, after cure and after moisture exposure. Surface structural changes were observed for all three conditions, which may affect adhesion of epoxy underfills. Further, the buried interfacial structures of the cured epoxies and a model polymer were investigated before and after moisture exposure and correlated to adhesion testing results. These studies showed that SFG is a powerful technique to study polymer adhesion mechanisms and the surface and interfacial structures required for adhesion...|$|R
40|$|The {{success of}} {{printing}} {{technology in the}} electronics industry primarily depends {{on the availability of}} metal printing ink. Various types of commercially available metal ink are widely used in different industries such as the solar cell, radio frequency identification (RFID) and light emitting diode (LED) industries, with limited usage in semiconductor packaging. The use of printed ink in semiconductor IC packaging is limited by several factors such as poor electrical performance and mechanical strength. Poor adhesion of the printed metal track to the epoxy molding compound is another critical factor that has caused a decline in interest in the application of printing technology to the semiconductor industry. In this study, two different groups of adhesion promoters, based on metal and polymer groups, were used to promote adhesion between the printed ink and the epoxy molding substrate. The experimental data show that silver ink with a metal oxide <b>adhesion</b> <b>promoter</b> adheres better than silver ink with a polymer <b>adhesion</b> <b>promoter.</b> This result {{can be explained by the}} hydroxyl bonding between the metal oxide promoter and the silane grouping agent on the epoxy substrate, which contributes a greater adhesion strength compared to the polymer <b>adhesion</b> <b>promoter.</b> Hypotheses of the physical and chemical functions of both adhesion promoters are described in detail...|$|E

40|$|Encapsulated {{photovoltaic}} modules {{must hold}} together for 20 years, reliably resisting delamination and separation {{of any of}} the component materials. Delamination of encapsulation materials from each other, or from solar cells and interconnects, can create voids for accumulation of water, promoting corrosive failure. Delamination of silicone elastomers from unprimed surfaces was a common occurrence with early modules, but the incidences of silicone delamination with later modules decreased when <b>adhesion</b> <b>promoters</b> recommended by silicone manufacturers were used. An investigation of silicone delamination from unprimed surfaces successfully identified the mechanism, which was related to atmospheric oxygen and moisture.
