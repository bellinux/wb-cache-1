40|$|Counter Current Flow Limitation (CCFL) was {{observed}} in the pressurizer surge line of the Oregon State University <b>APEX</b> <b>facility</b> during test NRC- 10. This test simulated a one-inch diameter cold leg break with a failure of three of four of the fourth-stage Automatic Depressurization System (ADS) valves. The result was a high vapor flow rate through ADS 1 - 3, that caused CCFL in the pressurizer surge line and liquid holdup in the pressurizer. Because this liquid was not available for core cooling, further study of the passive safety systems in the AP 600 under Mode 5 Cold Shutdown conditions was deemed necessary. An analysis of the AP 600 geometry and the existing CCFL database determined that Kutateladze scaling is appropriate for the APEX and AP 600 surge lines. The Kutateladze CCFL correlation {{was used to assess}} CCFL in the APEX and AP 600 pressurizer surge lines under Mode 5 Cold Shutdown conditions. The results indicate that CCFL would be expected in the pressurizer surge lines at low pressures and decay powers prior to ADS 4 actuation.

40|$|Graduation date: 1997 The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{describe}} the flow oscillations which occur in the AP 600 long term cooling test facility at Oregon State University. The AP 600 system is an advanced pressurized water reactor design utilizing passive emergency cooling systems. A few hours after the initiation of a cold leg break, the passive cooling systems inject gravity fed cold water at a rate allowing steam production in the reactor vessel. Steam production in the core causes the pressure in the upper head to increase leading to flow oscillations in all the connecting reactor systems. This paper will show that the oscillations have a definite region of onset and termination for specific conditions in the <b>APEX</b> testing <b>facility.</b> Tests performed at high powers, high elevation breaks, and small break sizes do not exhibit oscillations. The APOS (Advanced Plant Oscillation Simulator) computer code has been developed using a quasi-steady state analysis for flows and a transient analysis for the core node energy balance. The pressure in the reactor head is calculated using a modified perfect gas analysis. For tank liquid inventories, a simple conservation of mass analysis is used to estimate the tank elevations. Simulation logic gleaned from APEX data and photographic evidence have been incorporated into the code to predict termination of the oscillations. Areas which would make the work more complete include a better understanding of two-phase fluid behavior for a top offtake on a pipe, more instrumentation in the core region of the <b>APEX</b> testing <b>facility,</b> and a clearer understanding of fluid conditions in the reactor barrel. Scaling of the oscillations onset and pressure amplitude are relatively straight forward, but termination and period are difficult to scale to the full AP 600 plant. Differences in the core power profile and other geometrical differences between the testing facility and the actual plant make the scaling of this phenomenon to the actual plant conditions very difficult...|$|R
40|$|The ALMA Common Software (ACS) {{provides}} the software infrastructure used by ALMA and by several other telescope projects, thanks {{also to the}} choice of adopting the LGPL public license. ACS {{is a set of}} application frameworks providing the basic services needed for object oriented distributed computing.

40|$|Context: Though {{intensive}} care units (ICUs) only account for 10 % of hospital beds, they consume nearly 22 % of hospital resources. Few definitive costing {{studies have been}} conducted in Indian settings that would help determine appropriate resource allocation. Aim: To evaluate and compare the cost of {{intensive care}} delivery between multi-specialty and neurosurgery ICU in an <b>apex</b> trauma care <b>facility</b> in India. Materials and Methods: The study was conducted in a polytrauma and neurosurgery ICU at a 203 bedded level IV trauma care facility in New Delhi, India from May, 2012 to June 2012. The study was cross-sectional, retrospective, and record-based. Traditional costing was used to arrive at the cost for both direct and indirect cost estimates. The cost centers included in study were building cost, equipment cost, human resources, materials and supplies, clinical and nonclinical support services, engineering maintenance cost, and biomedical waste management. Statistical Analysis: Fisher′s two-tailed t-test. Results: Total cost/bed/day for the multi-specialty ICU was Rs. 14, 976. 9 /- and for the neurosurgery ICU was Rs. 14, 306. 7 /-, manpower constituting nearly half of the expenditure in both ICUs. The cost center wise and overall difference in the cost among the ICUs were statistically significant. Conclusions: Quantification of expenditure in running an ICU in a trauma center would assist healthcare decision makers in better allocation of resources.

These tests have been conducted in the Advanced Plant Experiment (<b>APEX)</b> <b>Facility</b> which is a one quarter height scaled simulation of the Westinghouse Advanced Passive 600 megawatt electric (AP 600) pressurized water reactor. The purpose of the testing program is to examine AP 600 passive safety system performance, particularly during long term cooling. The NRC- 25 series tests represents a parametric study to determine the minimum liquid reserves required to prevent a temperature excursion in the APEX core.

40|$|Graduation date: 1997 The Oregon State University (OSU) Radiation Center (RC) is the {{location}} of a one quarter scale model of the Westinghouse Electric Corporation advanced light-water nuclear reactor design called the AP- 600. The full scale AP- 600 is a 600 megawatt electric nuclear power plant that incorporates unique passive systems to perform the safety functions currently required of all existing nuclear power plants. Passive safety refers to a system's ability to perform its desired function using natural forces such as gravity and natural circulation. This reduces the reliance on active systems to assure plant safety. The Advanced Plant Experiment (APEX) at the OSU RC is an electrically heated simulation of the AP- 600 that includes the Nuclear Steam Supply System (NSSS) and all of the passive safety systems.

40|$|Shifts {{of center}} {{wavelengths}} (CWLs) and related changes of full-widths at half-maximums (FWHMs) occur during in-flight data acquisitions of push-broom imaging spectrometers {{such as the}} airborne prism experiment (APEX). Combined with the spectrally changing properties of the dichroic coating {{that acts as a}} beam splitter between the visible and near infrared (VNIR) as well as the short-wave infrared (SWIR) channels, these shifts affect both the spectral and radiometric accuracies of the spectrometer data, and hence the accuracy of higher level products. In this paper, two independent standards, i. e., atmospheric absorption features as well as features of the standard reference material filter built in the <b>APEX</b> in-flight characterization <b>facility,</b> are used in a complementary way to improve in-flight spectral calibration. The CWL shift and FWHM change for each detector element are simultaneously detected by using spectrum-matching and surface fitting techniques under constraints from pregenerated shift realizations. Subsequently, the APEX spectroradiometric response model is improved in the aspect of spectral resolution by using performance parameters of optics and detector modules. The radiometric gain and offset for each detector element are corrected according to the detected CWLs and FWHMs, as well as the improved APEX response model. Compared with the spectral and radiometric parameters acquired during laboratory calibration, the detected CWLs and FWHMs promote the accuracy of the atmospheric feature positions in the SWIR channel by 10 nm, whereas the corrected gains and offsets reduce the radiance deviation in the spectral regions 375 - 550 nm and 950 - 1080 nm both by 70 % on average...|$|R
40|$|All {{projects}} aim at {{pushing the}} limits of our knowledge about the interaction between a galaxy and a supermassive black hole (SMBH) at its center. The {{development of a new}} instrument can be as valuable as combining different datasets. I follow both approaches and developed projects which deal with new instrumentation and telescope technology, combine datasets from different wavelengths and resolutions, and incorporate recent theoretical models and predictions, which can be verified empirically. The first two of the six chapters compile astrophysical and technical background of the individual projects, which are presented in the following four chapters. While the first project (Chapter 3) deals with observations of the innermost parsec of our Galaxy, Chapter 4 presents data of the inner kpc of an active galaxy. The subjects of Chapters 5 and 6 are very luminous AGN/host systems, so-called QSOs. Whereas Chapter 5 presents global, spatially unresolved properties of SMBH/host systems, the radio jet, analyzed in the final Chapter 6, combines all size scales. It is investigated from close to its origin out to several kpc. The accretion onto the black hole of the Milky Way (Chapter 3) is extremely inefficient and the SMBH possibly interacts dominantly via tidal forces only. The next discussed system (Chapter 4) is the prototype of moderately luminous Seyfert 2 AGN, NGC 1068. Here a strong local influence of the nuclear X-ray radiation is observed. Chapter 5 deals with the possible global importance of radiative interaction between highly luminous QSO AGN and the host. The radio jet in Chapte 6 definitely shows signs of interaction with the matter of its host several kpc away from the nucleus. Chapters 3 - 6 include a dedicated introductory and a conclusive section, which put the results obtained in the larger astrophysical context of the observation. Chapter 3 deals with the pioneering interferometric infrared study of stellar sources and their surroundings in the immediate vicinity of the SMBH {{at the center of the}} Milky Way. I was able to use the resolving power of an optical large baseline interferometer (OLBI) to investigate for the first time the different structures and excitation conditions of interstellar and circumstellar dust in 200 mpc distance to the SMBH. It is unknown whether the standard models for star and dust formation, which themselves dominate the infrared appearance of an inactive galaxy as the Milky Way, still apply under the strong tidal forces of gravity, exerted by the central SMBH. The VLTI observations, described in Chapter 3, are the first observations of stellar interferometry in the infrared, which target objects through the 25 magnitudes of optical extinction along the line of sight toward the GC. One motivation for these observations, in addition to the direct scientific intention, was to create a showcase for advanced optical interferometry applications at the GC. An important part of the thesis is the detailed analysis of the achievable accuracy of the interferometric measurements. Such a precision study under the challenging conditions of off-axis optical AO guiding and faint target brightnesses close to the system limits has not been published before. For the first time I can present results that show that the direct zone of dust formation around the deeply embedded star is observable. The temperature, derived from the spectral properties, and the spatial size, as derived from the high resolution interferometric dataset, show the cool star nature of the object. The following Chapter 4 reports on the first extragalactic sub-mm spectra of the innermost region in the Seyfert 2 prototype NGC 1068 with the new <b>APEX</b> telescope <b>facility.</b> The emission of the molecular rotational excitation lines CO(J= 3 - 2) and HCN(J= 4 - 3) were observed during the instrument testing phase. In Chapter 5, I present the results of the search for rotational line transitions at 80 GHz, in particular the 1 - 0 transition of the HCN molecule. It traces gas densities larger than 10 ^ 4 cm^- 3 and is therefore a better quantitative tracers of the regions where star formation actually occurs than the stronger CO(1 - 0) transition, which correlates to the total amount of molecular gas which could be transformed into stars. The observed galaxies host a luminous quasar in their core. I investigate the hypothesis of an amplification and extension of this effect in high luminosity AGN from local nuclear to global galactic scales. In the last chapter, I analyze the physical properties of the radio jet in the radio loud quasar J 1101 + 7225, which shows exceptionally far away from its nuclear origin (4 kpc) high relativistic motions. I follow the jet down to the hundred pc scale. The full analysis of the radio properties reveals an exemplary radio jet, which shows a complex inner structure including a possibly helical morphology...|$|R
