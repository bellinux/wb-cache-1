Hammond and Yardley were inspecting the wet pitch. I knew there was a chance of losing valuable wickets so I just kept on appealing until the umpires answered me.|$|E

500|$|Dworkin and Stoltenberg {{were married}} in 1998; after her death Stoltenberg said, [...] "It's why we never told anybody really that we married, because people get {{confused}} about that. They think, Oh, she's yours. <b>And</b> <b>we</b> <b>just</b> did not want that nonsense." ...|$|E
500|$|... "We {{needed someone}} to play {{keyboards}} for a song I did with Gavin Christopher. We called someone and he couldn't come, so by accident we stumbled on Ben. Ben came to the session, and he can't really play keyboards very well-he's really more of a drummer-but after that day, we kept in touch, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>just</b> sort of clicked as writers.|$|E
500|$|Although {{the band}} {{produced}} the album, Pekka stated that Antti {{was the main}} producer since he was present at {{every step of the}} production, including mixing and mastering. Because they were comfortable self-producing on all their previous albums, they refused to bring in an outside record producer for 12 Gauge. [...] "This concept has worked for us since the beginning <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>just</b> want to trust it. Everything goes easy with this setup and we don’t want any extra risk factors". Mastering for the disc took place at the Cutting Room in Stockholm, Sweden.|$|E

500|$|Inspiration for [...] "The Bill" [...] {{came when}} Shearsmith and Pemberton, {{the creators of}} Inside No. 9, saw a group arguing over a bill at a restaurant. Pemberton said that, unexpectedly, [...] "they were arguing about wanting to pay it, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>just</b> came out and thought, 'Could that be one episode?' ... And then it's about {{sustaining}} that one idea". For him, [...] "when you're in the writing phase, you can see anything in day-to-day life that could spark your imagination"; after seeing this dispute, the writers immediately returned to their office to begin writing.|$|E
500|$|During an {{interview}} with The Pulse of Radio, vocalist Taylor said that Slipknot would be changing their stage set around for the US arena leg. [...] "We're {{getting away from the}} pyro. We're going way more visual this time. We're incorporating a lot of video." [...] He explained that they always try to do something different: [...] "We've got people still coming to see us for, you know, after ten years, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>just</b> want to try and give something special." [...] On the opening show of the leg, percussionist Crahan debuted a new mask which was significantly different from the one he wore while touring in 2008.|$|E
500|$|After Harrison's {{death in}} November 2001, McCartney {{said he was}} [...] "a lovely guy and a very brave man who had a {{wonderful}} sense of humour". He went on to say, [...] "We grew up together <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>just</b> had so many beautiful times together– that's what I am going to remember. I'll always love him, he's my baby brother." [...] On {{the first anniversary of}} his death, McCartney played Harrison's [...] "Something" [...] on a ukulele at the Concert for George. He also performed [...] "For You Blue" [...] and [...] "All Things Must Pass", and played the piano on Eric Clapton's rendition of [...] "While My Guitar Gently Weeps".|$|E

500|$|The {{special edition}} of Blood came with a bonus disc {{featuring}} three extra tracks. Tim Bowness (of No-Man) wrote lyrics and performed vocals on the first song, [...] "No Celebrations". The second track is a cover of [...] "Christian Brothers" [...] by Elliott Smith. The third track is [...] "Terminal (Endless)", an extended version of the regular CD track [...] "Terminal". [...] "It still has something interesting drum stuff where Gavin just plays steady beats with variations on it," [...] Moore said. [...] "We had some mercy on the album version, but on the bonus CD, we don't have any mercy <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>just</b> let it go." ...|$|E
500|$|On September 4, 2008, keyboardist and vocalist Kevin Moore {{posted a}} news update to the {{official}} Chroma Key website. In it, he stated {{that he had been}} working with guitarist Jim Matheos on a third OSI album [...] "for several months now, slowly but surely." [...] Moore later stated that with OSI, he and Matheos [...] "usually play it by ear. We never really know if we're going to do another OSI, we never agree on it. I don't remember ever agreeing to start a new one, really. But Jim will send me an idea or something <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>just</b> start talking about it." ...|$|E
500|$|Several titles were {{considered}} before the band {{settled on the}} eponymous name. Kretz explained, [...] "We've always tried {{to come up with}} very witty and interesting names for our records <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>just</b> felt that it was time, 18 years into the Stone Temple Pilots career, to put out a self-titled album." [...] Robert agreed that the new title was a testament to the [...] "new chapter" [...] in the band's career. Weiland also felt the band was starting over and thought the music expressed this on its own. [...] "We don't need {{to come up with some}} major conceptual title. The image on the cover and the music speak for themselves." ...|$|E

500|$|It was Jones who {{ultimately}} played {{most of the}} bass parts during the Bollocks recordings; Howard calls his rudimentary, rumbling approach the [...] "explosive missing ingredient" [...] of the Sex Pistols' sound. Vicious's bass is reportedly present on one track that appeared on the original album release, [...] "Bodies". Jones recalls, [...] "He played his farty old bass part <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>just</b> let him do it. When he left I dubbed another part on, leaving Sid's down low. I {{think it might be}} barely audible on the track." [...] Following [...] "God Save the Queen", two more singles were released: [...] "Pretty Vacant" [...] (largely written by Matlock) on 1 July and from the Bollocks sessions, [...] "Holidays in the Sun" [...] on 14 October. Each was a Top Ten hit.|$|E
500|$|Wednesday 13 {{explained}} the album's inspiration in an interview: [...] "Wednesday 13 (the band) has a live DVD that I put {{out and we}} couldn't think of a title and we were driving down the road thinking, {{we are going to}} have to come up with a name for it. The live titles, you have to put something like that. So, we were watching Bill O'Reilly and we kept listening to him say, 'Fuck it, we'll do it live.' That's kind of how quick we threw that DVD together. We didn't know we were putting it together like 4 days before so we were like, 'fuck it, we'll do it live.' We didn't do any overdubs on it, everybody in the band was sick <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>just</b> went with it." ...|$|E
500|$|During recording, Eno created several {{prototype}} mixes of the song. The Edge {{recalled how}} these different mixes assisted the band {{in creating the}} final version of the track. One of these early versions was later released under the title [...] "Bottoms (Watashitachi No Ookina Yume)" [...] as a bonus track on the UK and Japanese promotional releases of the experimental 1995 album Original Soundtracks 1 by Passengers, a side project by U2 and Eno, as well as a B-side on some versions of the [...] "Miss Sarajevo" [...] single. [...] "Bottoms (Watashitachi No Ookina Yume)" [...] is an instrumental track and was described by The Edge as a [...] "crazy" [...] mix. He added [...] "'Bottoms' was done in Japan, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>just</b> built on that mix. Sometimes you can end up with something completely distinctive." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Isn't it nice," [...] said Corny, [...] "that he isn't a queen, to {{be taken}} care of, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> can <b>just</b> pay him and come away, and not have to think of him any more?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, it doesn't matter. We {{were walking}} down the street, here, this morning, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> saw the sign of an {{apartment}} to let, in a window, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> thought, <b>just</b> for amusement, <b>we</b> would go in and look at it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, papa; we have {{something}} to read you, something quite fresh. A piece of paper was found on the table this morning--(dropt, we suppose, by a fairy)--containing a very pretty charade, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> have <b>just</b> copied it in." ...|$|R
500|$|Jackson {{said that}} the {{recording}} of [...] "The Girl Is Mine" [...] {{was one of his}} most enjoyable moments in the studio. He stated, [...] "One of my favourite songs to record, of all my recordings as a solo artist, is probably [...] "The Girl Is Mine", because working with Paul McCartney was pretty exciting <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>just</b> literally had fun. It was like lots of kibitzing and playing, and throwing stuff at each other, and making jokes. We actually recorded the (instrumental) track and the vocals pretty much live at the same time, and we do have footage of it, but it's never been shown." [...] He concluded, [...] "Maybe one day we'll give you a sneak preview of it." [...] The footage of the pair was later shown at The Paul McCartney World Tour.|$|E
500|$|Doby {{was part}} of a December 3, 1957, multi-player trade between the White Sox and Baltimore Orioles, then was traded again on April 1 to Cleveland along with Don Ferrarese for Gene Woodling, Bud Daley, and Dick Williams. He {{appeared}} in 89 games with the Indians that season and had a [...]289 batting average, 13 home runs, and 45 RBIs. He was sent to the Detroit Tigers on March 21, 1959, in exchange for Tito Francona. Tigers general manager Rick Ferrell said, [...] "this gives us some more power <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>just</b> hope Doby hits as well in Briggs Stadium this season as he has in other years." [...] With the Tigers he appeared in 18 games and was the first black player to play for the Tiger franchise. He hit [...]218 with four RBIs before Detroit sold the 35-year-old Doby to the White Sox on May 13 for $20,000.|$|E
500|$|The year 2006 {{marked a}} {{significant}} {{turning point in}} Genelia's career. She completed two Telugu movies in early 2006, one was the romantic comedy Happy, {{and the other was}} Raam. She then portrayed the role of Haasini, a vibrant, effervescent and a happy-go-lucky young girl, in the 2006 Telugu romantic film Bommarillu. The movie, a blockbuster at the box-office, grossed [...] in India, and also won the 2006 Golden Nandi award. Her character was well received, and garnered her the Telugu Filmfare Award for Best Actress, besides Nandi Special Jury Award and Santosham Award for Best Actress. Sify concluded about her acting in their review that, [...] "The scene stealer is Genelia with her innocent looks and cute mannerisms. She does not overact <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>just</b> fall in love with her character. Genelia looks like a dream in chic skirts and is {{the life of the party}} and raises the bar of the film." ...|$|E

"I {{ended up}} {{recording}} {{little bits of}} the song for her as YouTube links <b>and</b> then <b>we</b> <b>just</b> shared them back and forth <b>and</b> then when <b>we</b> got together she had translated them," [...] says Cardiff. [...] "It was pretty sweet. She’s a very lovely person and I feel lucky that that happened." ...|$|R
