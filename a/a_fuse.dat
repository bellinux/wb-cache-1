5|$|Before {{leading the}} final sortie by the castle garrison, Zrinski ordered <b>a</b> <b>fuse</b> be lit to the powder magazine. After cutting {{down the last}} of the {{defenders}} the besiegers poured into the fortress. The Ottoman Army entered the remains of Szigetvár and fell into the booby trap; thousands perished in the blast when the castle's magazine exploded.|$|E
5|$|Fuses: Documented {{evidence}} suggests that the earliest fuses were first used by the Chinese between the 10th and 12th centuries. After the Chinese had invented gunpowder, they began adapting its explosive properties for use in military technology. By 1044 they were using gunpowder in simple grenades, bombs, and flamethrowers, all of which required <b>a</b> <b>fuse</b> to be lit before being thrown at the enemy.|$|E

5|$|The Dorniers were {{to carry}} twenty 110-lb bombs each fitted with <b>a</b> <b>fuse</b> {{that would allow}} for {{function}} if released from 50 feet or higher; the type of bomb previously used by the Staffel had to release from twice this height, making the unit's Do 17s correspondingly more vulnerable to ground fire.|$|E
5|$|The years 904–906 saw {{the use of}} {{incendiary}} projectiles called 'flying fires' (fei-huo). Needham (1986) {{argues that}} gunpowder was first used in warfare in China in 919 as <b>a</b> <b>fuse</b> for the ignition of another incendiary, Greek fire. Initially, gunpowder mixtures were utilised through traditional engines and throwing mechanisms; containers and grenades were thrown by mangonels and trebuchets, and explosive rockets and arrows were developed, along with gunpowder flamethrowers.|$|E
5|$|On September 17, 1992, Apple {{recalled}} 60,000 PowerBook100s {{because of}} a potential safety problem. An electrical short, it was discovered, could melt a small hole in the casing, which occurred {{in three of the}} 60,000 notebooks manufactured between October 1991 and March 1992. On the day of the recall, Apple shares closed at $47, down $1.25, but some analysts discounted the recall's importance. In addition, the original power supplies had problems with insulation cracks that could cause a short in <b>a</b> <b>fuse</b> on the motherboard; and the computer was prone to cracks in the power adapter socket on the motherboard, which required a $400 replacement motherboard if the warranty had expired.|$|E

5|$|Once {{the embassy}} had been tipped off {{that there was}} a spy {{operating}} in the facility in early 1944, Bazna found it increasingly difficult to gather intelligence. The British Field Office had warned the embassy of a security leak. Bazna forwarded the document to the Germans. The warning had come to Churchill from Roosevelt, who obtained the information given by a defector to the United States. A new alarm system in the British Embassy now required Bazna to remove <b>a</b> <b>fuse</b> whenever he wanted to look in the ambassador's safe.|$|E
5|$|The {{next day}} at school, Flash tries to {{convince}} Squeezit to help him rescue René and Frenchy. When Squeezit refuses, Flash enlists the help of Gramps instead. In the Sixth Dimension, they speak to an old Jewish man who tells them how to help Frenchy escape, but they soon are captured by Bust Rod. Doris interrogates Flash and Gramps and then lowers them into a large septic tank. She then plots her revenge against Frenchy, relocating all the denizens of Cell 63 to a torture chamber. She leaves the Princess to oversee Frenchy's torture and execution, but when <b>a</b> <b>fuse</b> is blown, the torture is put on hold and the prisoners from Cell 63 are relocated to keep the King from finding them.|$|E
5|$|Evidence was {{presented}} by the prosecution to suggest that Morgan continued to use the vehicle while Figard's body lay in the cab, and that the lorry was parked outside his house over the Christmas period. Farrer said Morgan bought a spade, axe and hacksaw {{with the intention of}} dismembering the body, but changed his mind, instead making an overnight delivery run to dispose of it. After removing <b>a</b> <b>fuse</b> from his lorry's tachograph to conceal the journey, he drove to Worcestershire. Discrepancies were subsequently found in his travel records for 29 December 1995 because he forgot to replace the fuse following the trip. DNA tests on spots of blood found in the cab matched Figard, while a blood-soaked mattress was found in Morgan's garage. Several items belonging to Figard, including photographs and a toilet bag, were recovered from his house. Some of her clothing was found close to a warehouse he had visited the night the body was dumped. Morgan gave two bottles of Pascal Chretien that Figard had brought to England as Christmas presents to two garage attendants who worked at a Shell station opposite his house.|$|E

25|$|<b>A</b> <b>fuse</b> is an {{automatic}} means of removing power from a faulty system; often abbreviated to ADS (Automatic Disconnection of Supply). Circuit breakers {{can be used}} as an alternative design solution to fuses, but have significantly different characteristics.|$|E
25|$|A {{circuit breaker}} is an {{automatically}} operated electrical switch {{designed to protect}} an electrical circuit from damage caused by excess current, typically resulting from an overload or short circuit. Its basic function is to interrupt current flow after a fault is detected. Unlike <b>a</b> <b>fuse,</b> which operates once and then must be replaced, a circuit breaker can be reset (either manually or automatically) to resume normal operation. Circuit breakers are made in varying sizes, from small devices that protect low-current circuits or individual household appliance, up to large switchgear designed to protect high voltage circuits feeding an entire city. The generic function of a circuit breaker, RCD or <b>a</b> <b>fuse,</b> as an automatic means of removing power from a faulty system is often abbreviated as ADS (Automatic Disconnection of Supply).|$|E
25|$|An RCD {{does not}} provide {{protection}} against unexpected or dangerously high current (called spikes or surges) when current is in the usual wires in the circuit, therefore it cannot replace <b>a</b> <b>fuse</b> or protect against overheating or fire risk due to overcurrent (overload) or short circuits if the fault {{does not lead to}} current leakage. Therefore, RCDs are often used or integrated as a single product along with some kind of circuit breaker, such as <b>a</b> <b>fuse</b> or miniature circuit breaker (MCB), which adds protection in the event of excessive current in the circuit (the resulting RCD with overcurrent protection called an RCBO). RCDs also cannot detect the situation where a human accidentally touches both conductors at the same time, since the current through an expected device, an unexpected route, or a human, are indistinguishable if the current returns through the expected conductor.|$|E

25|$|Most BSD and Linux {{distributions}} do not, {{for legal}} reasons; users must manually install third-party implementations of exFAT (as <b>a</b> <b>FUSE</b> module) {{in order to}} be able to mount exFAT-formatted volumes. However, SDXC cards can be reformatted to use any file system (such as ext2, UFS, or VFAT), alleviating the restrictions associated with exFAT availability.|$|E
25|$|The {{distribution}} board system used in Irish homes also differs substantially from {{those used in}} the UK and elsewhere. All {{distribution board}}s (fuse boxes) are required to have a 'main fuse' or 'main breaker' rated at the maximum permissible load for that installation. Typically, this is a 63 <b>A</b> <b>fuse</b> and a switch, or a Minized fuse isolator which accepts a Neozed fuse.|$|E
25|$|A {{spillway}} is {{a section}} of a dam designed to pass water from the upstream side of a dam to the downstream side. Many spillways have floodgates designed to control the flow through the spillway. There are several types of spillway. A service spillway or primary spillway passes normal flow. An auxiliary spillway releases flow {{in excess of the}} capacity of the service spillway. An emergency spillway is designed for extreme conditions, such as a serious malfunction of the service spillway. <b>A</b> <b>fuse</b> plug spillway is a low embankment designed to be overtopped and washed away {{in the event of a}} large flood. The elements of <b>a</b> <b>fuse</b> plug are independent free-standing blocks, set side by side which work without any remote control. They allow increasing the normal pool of the dam without compromising the security of the dam because they are designed to be gradually evacuated for exceptional events. They work as fixed weirs at times by allowing over-flow for common floods.|$|E
