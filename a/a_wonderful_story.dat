[...] Bury retold his story to Lamb, but omitted the {{reference}} to Jack the Ripper, and added that he had stabbed his wife's body once. Bury was searched, and a small knife, bankbook and his house key were confiscated pending inquiries. Lamb and Detective Constable Peter Campbell proceeded to the Burys' dingy flat, where they discovered the mutilated remains of Ellen stuffed into the wooden box Bury had commissioned in London.|$|E

60|$|Bishop Burnet, in {{his book}} of travels, tells us <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> <b>story,</b> almost incredible; but tells it as a passage that deserves our belief.

5000|$|BookList, {{reviewing}} Wee Winnie Witch's Skinny, wrote [...] "This original scare tale, {{which may}} be her creepiest, is <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> horror <b>story</b> that draws on traditional beliefs about witches hanging up their skins and riding people using braided hair as a bridle. Moser's framed, colored wood engravings {{do a great job}} of bringing the wild, shivery adventure close to home, their black backgrounds and strong lines lit with garish Halloween images in shades of green and red." [...] The School Library Journal recommended that [...] "This tale is admirably suited to Halloween telling, or for any time that shivers are in order." ...|$|R
5000|$|About the movie's {{failure and}} {{critical}} response, John McTiernan said: [...] "Initially, it was <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> Cinderella <b>story</b> with <b>a</b> nine-year-old boy. We {{had a pretty}} good script by Bill Goldman, charming. And this ludicrous hype machine got hold of it, and it got buried under bullshit. It was so overwhelmed with baggage. And then it was whipped out unedited, practically assembled right out of the camera. It was in the theater five or six weeks after I finished shooting. It was kamikaze, stupid, no good reason for it. And then to open the week after Jurassic Park--God! To get to the depth of bad judgment involved in that you'd need a snorkel." ...|$|R

60|$|The man {{who escaped}} {{at the former}} place tells <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> <b>story</b> of the strangeness of its coiling flow, and how he looked down from the church spire and saw the houses of the village rising like ghosts out of its inky nothingness. For {{a day and a}} half he {{remained}} there, weary, starving and sun-scorched, the earth under the blue sky and against the prospect of the distant hills a velvet-black expanse, with red roofs, green trees, and, later, black-veiled shrubs and gates, barns, outhouses, and walls, rising here and there into the sunlight.|$|E

They must occupy the seats near the farther window, and as you will no doubt all be looking out on this side, they will probably not be noticed, which would be all the better, as it is a little irregular my taking them up." ...|$|E
60|$|Cynicism is humour in ill-health. It {{would have}} been far more {{difficult}} {{to tell the story of}} how a multitude of commonplace people were changed by a half-dubious perception that God was indeed close at hand to them, a perception that they would sometimes struggle with and deny, sometimes realize overwhelmingly; it {{would have been}} <b>a</b> beautiful, pitiful, <b>wonderful</b> <b>story,</b> and it may be if Boon had lived he would have written it. He could have written it. But he was too ill for that much of writing, and the tired pencil turned to the easier course....|$|R
2500|$|Producer Andy Harries {{responded to}} the Clough family's criticisms by stating that [...] "The filmmakers' goal is to tell <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> and {{extraordinary}} <b>story</b> with universal themes of success, jealousy and betrayal". Harries added that without adding fictional elements the film {{would not have been}} as exciting to watch. He also reassured Clough's family that the film would be a more sympathetic portrayal of Clough than in the book. Writer Peter Morgan claimed that he did not feel the film's accuracy was of major importance.|$|R

After some time of VR dating and awesome adventures with a female heroine, they agree to meet up in real life.

And he came back with pebbles of gold and flowers that shed a golden dust, and he told <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> <b>story.</b> He had climbed and climbed into the mountains, and he had come to a wonderful slope under the crags.

6000|$|What {{were his}} impressions, I wonder, {{as he sat}} on a limb of the old apple tree and thought it all over? Do birds have romances? How much greater wonders had he seen than those of any romance! And do they have any means of {{communicating}} them, as they sing their love songs? What <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> <b>story</b> he could tell, a real story, of a magic palace full of strange wonders; of a glittering bit of air that made him see himself; of a giant, all in white, with only his head visible; of an enchanted beauty, stretching her wings in mute supplication for some brave knight to touch her and break the spell, while on high a fierce dragon-hawk kept watch, ready to eat up any one who should dare enter! ...|$|E
6000|$|It {{was an old}} leather-bound book {{filled with}} the record of his voyages and adventures. Anne thought what a {{treasure}} trove {{it would be to}} a writer. Every sentence was a nugget. In itself the book had no literary merit; Captain Jim's charm of storytelling failed him when he came to pen and ink; he could only jot roughly down the outline of his famous tales, and both spelling and grammar were sadly askew. But Anne felt that if anyone possessed of the gift could take that simple record of a brave, adventurous life, reading between the bald lines the tales of dangers staunchly faced and duty manfully done, <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> <b>story</b> might be made from it. Rich comedy and thrilling tragedy were both lying hidden in Captain Jim's [...] "life-book," [...] waiting for the touch of the master hand to waken the laughter and grief and horror of thousands.|$|E
5000|$|In 1989, {{the novel}} was adapted into a film called Old Gringo {{starring}} Gregory Peck, Jane Fonda, and Jimmy Smits. Before its release in theatres, {{the film was}} booed at the Cannes film festival. Roger Ebert in the Chicago Sun-Times said: [...] "There is <b>a</b> potentially <b>wonderful</b> <b>story</b> {{at the heart of}} Old Gringo, but the movie never finds it--the screenplay blasts away in every direction except the bulls-eye. ... It's heavy on disconnected episodes, light on drama and storytelling." [...] Janet Maslin in the New York Times said: [...] "... the film's version of romance is no less aimless than its battle scenes. ... The sly, cantankerous character of Ambrose Bierce, an aged cynic surprised and delighted to find himself vibrantly alive and at last in control of his own destiny, reveals in Mr. Peck something vigorous and new." [...] The film received mixed to negative reviews, with a 45% [...] "Freshness" [...] rating at the review aggregator site Rotten Tomatoes, and was a box-office failure.|$|R

Opposite page one, the reader finds a photograph of Jerome Lettvin sitting at his desk, bespectacled, smoking, with the ink from his pen bleeding through his shirt pocket.
