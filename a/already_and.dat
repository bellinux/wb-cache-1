5|$|In August 2015, Darabont {{requested}} to amend his original complaint that AMC further reduced his profits from Season 2 as his firing mid-season {{meant he was}} not fully vested in the season, allowing AMC to reduce the profits paid him. Darabont's amended request points {{out that he had}} written and produced all the episodes in that season <b>already</b> <b>and</b> was entitled to the proper profit share. The judge granted this amendment in February 2016, partially influenced by concerns raised in Darabont's deposition.|$|E
5|$|The case i = n {{has also}} been noted <b>already,</b> <b>and</b> is an easy {{consequence}} of the Hurewicz theorem: this theorem links homotopy groups with homology groups, which are generally easier to calculate; in particular, it shows that for a simply-connected space X, the first nonzero homotopy group πk(X), with k > 0, is isomorphic to the first nonzero homology group H'k(X). For the n-sphere, this immediately implies that for n ge& 2, πn(S'n) = H'n(S'n) = Z.|$|E

5|$|Outside North America {{it opened}} {{reasonably}} well. In Australia {{it was the}} highest-earning film in its opening weekend of October 9–12, 2008 with $2,104,319, ahead of Pixar Animation's Wall-E, which fell to second place, while Beverly Hills Chihuahua held third. In the United Kingdom, the film's earnings were the second-highest behind Quantum of Solace during November 21–23, its opening weekend. It earned £991,939 from 393 screens. Overall, while the film grossed only $40 million at the North American box office, it has grossed $115,097,286 worldwide. In the United States, contemporary war films have performed relatively poorly. Warner Bros. had hoped the large budget and Scott's direction could better them, but the film performed relatively poorly compared to his others; analysts attributed this to the film's Middle East setting and exploration of terrorism. Brandon Gray pointed out that people read these themes {{in the news media}} <b>already,</b> <b>and</b> there is a perception that Hollywood films are biased.|$|E
5|$|The plot {{begins on}} September 28, 1998, {{two months after}} the events of the first Resident Evil, in the Midwestern American {{mountain}} community of Raccoon City. Nearly all of its citizens have been transformed into zombies by an outbreak of the T-virus, a new type of biological weapon secretly developed by the pharmaceutical company Umbrella. The game's two protagonists are Leon S. Kennedy, a rookie police officer on his first day in the local force, and Claire Redfield, a college student looking for her brother Chris. Having just arrived in the city, Leon and Claire {{make their way to the}} Raccoon Police Department, seeking protection from the mutated population. There, they discover that most of the policemen have been killed <b>already,</b> <b>and</b> that Chris has left town to investigate the Umbrella headquarters in Europe. With no remaining motivation to stay, the two protagonists split up to look for other survivors and flee the city. While searching for an escape route, Claire meets a little girl named Sherry, who is on the run from an unknown creature, and Leon encounters Ada Wong, who claims to be looking for her boyfriend John, an Umbrella researcher.|$|E
5|$|The Angel of Darkness started {{development}} {{three years}} prior to its release under the working title Tomb Raider next generation. As part of the preparation for the game, the company conducted market research, and decided {{to create a new}} setting and story for the main character. One of the main drives behind the game was fully utilising the new platform's potential and reinventing the character of Lara Croft, including rebuilding her character model and allowing her to perform melee combat. It was the first game in the series to be made for the PlayStation 2 platform: the previous entry in the series, , had pushed the PlayStation to its technical limits, contributing to lower review scores and sales than previous titles in the series. Core Design separated into two teams, with a new team working on Angel of Darkness and series regulars on Tomb Raider: Chronicles. After the completion of Tomb Raider: Chronicles, lead programmer Richard Morton came over and found that the new team had gone off the rails, scrapping the entire project once <b>already</b> <b>and</b> completing only the game's basic story. The developers later admitted to being overambitious. Some of them also commented that none of the Core team were prepared for the added complexity of developing for the advanced PlayStation 2. Jonell Elliott returned as the voice of Lara Croft. This would be the last time she provided the voice, with Keeley Hawes taking over for Tomb Raider: Legend.|$|E

Although Urlus and his wife had several children <b>already,</b> <b>and</b> needed the money, he turned down the Frankfurt offer because the company would not grant him time off each summer to attend Bayreuth: he still hoped for a call from the festival's directors which, as it transpired, would not be forthcoming for another 13 years.|$|E
25|$|With Dr. McMullen as {{sole owner}} of the Astros, the team would now benefit in ways a {{corporation}} could not give them. The rumors of the Astros moving out of Houston started to crumble and the Astros were now able {{to compete in the}} free-agent market. McMullen showed the city of Houston that he too wanted a winning team, signing nearby Alvin, Texas native Nolan Ryan to the first million-dollar-a-year deal. Ryan had four career no-hitters <b>already</b> <b>and</b> had struck out 383 in one season.|$|E

25|$|They {{argue that}} as an Indian tribe in the United States, the Lakota people were <b>already</b> <b>and</b> always have been a {{sovereign}} nation as guaranteed under Article Six of the United States Constitution, bound to the United States Federal Government by treaty. As such, the legal basis of such a state's independence is argued to be the Lakota nation's withdrawal from the 1851 and 1868 Treaties of Fort Laramie, and the rejection of all United States federal laws, executive orders, and other government acts since then, in particular rejecting the Major Crimes Act, the General Allotment Act, the Citizenship Act of 1924, the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934, the Indian Claims Commission Act, Public Law 280 and the Termination Act.|$|E

When the MI6 agent Stewart Menzies appears to threaten Clarke, Turing reveals that Cairncross is a spy. Menzies reveals he knew this <b>already,</b> <b>and</b> planted Cairncross among {{them in order to}} leak messages to the Soviets for British benefit. Fearing for her safety, Turing tells Clarke to leave Bletchley Park, revealing that he is gay and lying about never having cared for her. After the war, Menzies tells the cryptographers to destroy their work and that they can never see one another again or share what they have done.|$|E

25|$|A {{meeting with}} the DNC was convened to discuss the results. The Fleming craft had few friends in the DNC, though their criticisms were not specific. They {{introduced}} representatives of three shipbuilding firms. The ISTDC were only interested in the Fleming design submitted <b>already,</b> <b>and</b> in trying the craft at a landing {{on the east coast}} of England in a matter of months. The DNC accepted this, but asked ISTDC to give their specifications to the firms present so that they could also submit designs. Two of the firms were unable to tender, the third, Messrs Thornycroft, had a proposal on the drawing board in forty-eight hours and ISTDC and the DNC agreed that construction of a prototype should be paid for. The craft might be constructed for experimental purposes on the understanding that the DNC held no responsibility.|$|E
25|$|On 1 January 2002, in {{accordance}} with the state policy of promoting Mandarin on local television channels have been banned from showing programmes in Cantonese and Hokkien dialects for 14 years. These programs, such as popular television serials from Hong Kong and Taiwan, which use both Hong Kong Cantonese and Hokkien respectively, have to be dubbed into Mandarin. Local television series or programmes cannot use any form of dialect and are subjected to tight censorship with the exception of Eat <b>Already?</b> <b>and</b> Happy Can Already!, a locally produced dialect drama and variety show respectively. Similarly, national newspapers were not allowed to carry listings for Malaysia's TV3, a member of Sistem Televisyen Malaysia Berhad (STMB), also broadcast a significant amount of Hong Kong Cantonese programmes. Ironically, Malaysia state-run Radio Televisyen Malaysia (RTM) currently operates five free channels in Malaysia: TV1 and TV2 did broadcast programmes in Cantonese for a period of time. Although these were not meant for viewers in Singapore, Singaporeans could still receive the television signals. TV2 is no longer free-to-air in Singapore due to its broadcasting of foreign copyrighted programmes, that includes in Chinese dialects. Hong Kong's TVB Jade is broadcasting in Hong Kong Cantonese and is now available only on StarHub TV. TV1 is officially the only free-to-air channel from Malaysia in Singapore.|$|E
25|$|Charles Luden {{had been}} the widely {{accepted}} unofficial resident poet for several years <b>already</b> <b>and</b> remains such to this day. Dr. Ron Robinson, a substantial Sioux Falls writer and professor of English at Augustana College, was consistently on the scene. Steve Boint; Charles Luden; Nicole Allen; Jason Freeman; Suzanne Sunshower lives converged in Sioux Falls, SD while performing poetry at Michelle's Coffee and at the Horsebarn Arts Center. Together, they published From the lonely cold : poems by Nicole Allen, Charles Luden, Jason Freeman, Suzanne Sunshower, Steve Boint. Jason Freeman, poet and disability advocate was born in Sioux Falls (son of artist-writer/neurologist Dr. Jerome Freeman) {{and has been a}} part of the literary arts scene since his youth. Tom Foster moved to Sioux Falls (from California), having already developed a presence in the California Slam scene and was integral to keeping public open-mics going strong. The Washington Pavilion continued to donate space for literary activities as well as the Siouxland Sioux Falls Library. Eventually, David Allan Evans returned to Sioux Falls as the current State of South Dakota Poet Laureate and enhanced the literary scene with his reintroduction to the Sioux Falls community and presence as the state poet. Patrick Hicks, poet/writer, came to the city to teach at Augustana College and published the anthology A Menagerie of Words: Contemporary South Dakota Poetry, later, in 2010. Rosalee Blunk was the initial organizer for the Poetry Out Loud state finals held annually in Sioux Falls. Maddie Lukomski, a Poetry Out Loud junior at Sioux Falls Lincoln High School in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, was named a winner in the National Endowment for the Arts Poetry Ourselves competition spoken category, most recently (May 2016).|$|E
