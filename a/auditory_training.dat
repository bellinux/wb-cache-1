Methods: Thirty-eight female students at the third grade of elementary schools of Khomeinishahr City, Iran, were selected by multistage cluster random sampling of them, 20 students which were diagnosed dyslexic by Reading test and Wechsler test, devided randomly to two equal groups of experimental and control.

We tested this prediction with two randomised trials of frequency discrimination training involving {{a total of}} 70 participants with chronic subjective tinnitus.

Secondary analyses also report the effects of different domains of tinnitus handicap on the psychoacoustical characteristics of the tinnitus percept (sensation level, bandwidth and pitch) and on duration of training.

Anecdotal reports have found improvements in sleeping patterns, balance, allergies, eyesight, eating patterns, depression and other seemingly unrelated physiological states. During the <b>Auditory</b> Integration <b>Training</b> (AIT) procedure dynamic music, {{with a wide range}} of frequencies, is processed through a system of filters in the AIT device. The volume and tone of the music is constantly and randomly modulated. The researcher explored Berard AIT as a possible intervention for learners between the ages of six and twelve years, who experienced problems with sustained attention and who have difficulty in shifting their attention from task to task. The aim was to investigate if Berard AIT method would enable the learner to stay calm, relaxed yet alert, with focused attention and thus concentration with appropriate reflection before action. An experimental quantative study, with a pretest-posttest control group design, was conducted to investigate the effect that Berard <b>Auditory</b> Integration <b>Training</b> has on learners with attention problems. Checklists and different measurements were conducted before the training started and repeated three months after the training was completed, to monitor if any change in the way that the learners pay attention, occurred the case group of ten learners was compared with ten learners in a control group who did not initially receive the intervention.

50|$|The P2 {{follows the}} visual N1 (or {{auditory}} N100) and P1 waveforms (negativity and positivity at 150 and 100ms respectively) and {{is followed by}} the N200, P3, and N400 waveforms. Other components may overlap with the P2 to some extent, making it difficult to distinguish clearly between them, depending on the location of measurement. Originally, the P2 was characterized as a sub-component of a complex involving the N1, P1 and P2, which was known as the vertex potential and which was classically studied as a unitary phenomenon. In particular, the relationship between the N1 and P2 was thought to be important. The difference between the N1 and P2, known as the vertex amplitude, was found to be significantly larger for target than non-target stimuli and for rapid attention switching task. Further studies have subsequently examined the P2 separately from the N1 and have found that the amplitude of the P2 itself is larger for target stimuli that are less frequent. This is similar to the P3, though the P2 is usually seen for more simple features than the P3. In the auditory domain, there is evidence of enhanced P2 amplitudes even when a target stimuli is not embedded in a series of identical stimuli. In these instances, enhanced P2 amplitudes have been associated with auditory learning and repeated stimulus exposure. Enhanced P2 amplitudes have been reported in musicians with extensive listening experience as well as laboratory based <b>auditory</b> <b>training</b> experiments. A significant finding is that P2 amplitude changes are sometimes seen independent of N1 amplitude changes, again suggesting some degree of independence of N1, and P2 latencies and amplitudes appear to be affected by old age.|$|E

Although it was not significant, a trend was found indicating that people are more accurate {{when asked if they}} heard a word than when asked if they saw a word. In Experiment 2, the spelling, pronunciation and meaning (picture and definition) of pseudowords were learnt.
