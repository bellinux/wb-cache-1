Rectangular spiral is printed on a finite sized dielectric substrate (εr= 3. 27) backed by a finite-sized conducting plane. Rectangular spiral radiates in Right Handed Circular Polarization (RHCP). Horizontal spiral arm length (HL) is varied from HL= 0. 8 λo to HL= 5. 2 λo to choose the length that yields the proper <b>axial</b> ratio and <b>gain.</b> HL is chosen to be three values: HL 1 = 1. 16 λo, HL 2 = 2. 63 λo and HL 3 = 4. 64 λo.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} the behavior of an equiangular spiral antenna using a mixture of numerical and measurement techniques. The antenna is studied as an isolated element and {{as a part of a}} spiral-based ground-penetrating radar (GPR) detection system. The numerical modeling was based on the parallelized finite-difference time-domain method and the model was validated by comparison with a prototype antenna and detection system. The intention is to isolate the effect of varying different geometrical parameters that define the spiral element or the spiral GPR system. With some notion of each parameter's effect, systems that use the spiral antenna can be designed more easily. The analysis of the spiral antenna in isolation provides a set of design graphs for the antenna. A set of design graphs are constructed that allow one to better understand the effect of the chosen dielectric substrate on the characteristic impedance of the antennas. A second set of design graphs give very specific data about the lower cut-off frequency possible for the antennas given a requirement on its minimum boresight <b>gain,</b> <b>axial</b> ratio, or voltage standing-wave ratio when matched with an appropriate transmission line. The analysis of the spiral antenna in the context of a detection system provides information on the effect of the ground on the GPR system and to what extent the circular polarization properties of the spiral antenna play a role in GPR. It is shown that a spiral antenna used in a monostatic radar configuration will reject a symmetric scatterer well into the near-field. The importance of a resistive loading to the spiral arms is demonstrated for this rejection to be optimal. In addition, it is shown that increasing the dielectric constant of the ground narrows the pattern and polarization properties, making the antenna more directive towards boresight when the spiral antennas radiate into a flat ground. In addition to this work, a method for reducing the truncation error when calculating the planewave spectrum of an antenna is described. Ph. D.

40|$|This thesis investigates a novel dual {{frequency}} range low profile antenna system containing two nested spiral antennas operating over 2 – 18 GHz and 30 – 40 GHz respectively. The {{exploration and development}} of a broadband microstrip spiral without cavity backing has been implemented {{in the range of}} 2 - 18 GHz. The relationship between the structural parameters of equiangular spirals and their performance is investigated by simulating a variety of spiral structures. The input impedance, <b>gain,</b> <b>axial</b> ratio and radiation patterns of spiral antennas on a grounded dielectric substrate are compared with that of a spiral in free space to demonstrate the shortcomings of such a structure (i. e. narrow impedance bandwidth and poor gain). An effective way to achieve a broad bandwidth is proposed by introducing an impedance profile to remove the residual current along the spiral arms. Initially a Thin Film Resistive Layer (TFRL) was incorporated into a microstrip equiangular spiral antenna to absorb the residual current along the arms. Four spiral antennas with TFRLs of different thickness were developed to explore the TFRL application technique. Measured results and the difficulties in both simulation and fabrication experienced are demonstrated, analysed and addressed. An alternative to the use of a TFRL as an impedance profile on microstrip spirals, an exploration of spirals with embedded chip resistors had been conducted. The radiation physics of microstrip equiangular spirals are examined in the time domain using the XFDTD simulation package. XFDTD is used to analyse the current density distribution on the spiral arms under the excitation of pulse and harmonic waves. An analysis of the current density distribution at steady state provides guidelines for arranging the chip resistors efficiently. Chip resistor loading rules have been developed from these outcomes. A two dual arm equiangular spiral antennas with embedded chip resistors has been simulated, fabricated and measured. The antenna has a compact tapered balun which is horizontally placed inside the spiral antenna substrate to reduce the volume of the completed spiral/feed structure. The spiral with embedded chip resistors and a compact balun is selected as the low frequency element (2 – 18 GHz) for a nested antenna system. A dual arm Archimedean spiral antenna with cavity backing (operating over 30 – 40 GHz) is developed to be nested within the aperture of the low frequency spiral. The high frequency antenna was integrated into the substrate of the low frequency element, in the opening between the spiral arms. An Electronic Band Gap (EBG) architecture was applied to the rim of the nested antenna substrate to mitigate the consequences of surface waves. The entire nested antenna system was fabricated and measured, and the results are presented and discussed...|$|R
