2500|$|In 1948, he {{returned}} to the U.S. to head the Strategic Air Command (SAC) at Offutt Air Force Base, replacing Gen George Kenney. When LeMay took over command of SAC, it consisted of little more than a few understaffed B-29 bombardment groups left over from World War II. Less than half of the available aircraft were operational, and the crews were undertrained. Base and <b>aircraft</b> <b>security</b> standards were minimal. Upon inspecting a SAC hangar full of US nuclear strategic bombers, LeMay found a single Air Force sentry on duty, unarmed. [...] After ordering a mock bombing exercise on Dayton, Ohio, LeMay was shocked to learn that most of the strategic bombers assigned to the mission missed their targets by one mile or more.

40|$|Commonly {{available}} items {{including a}} ball point pen, a plastic knife, a broken wine bottle, {{and a broken}} wine glass were used to inflict stab and incised wounds to the necks of 3 previously euthanized Large White pigs.

Despite precautions against the carrying of metal objects such as knives and nail files on board domestic and international flights, objects are still available within aircraft cabins {{that could be used}} to inflict serious and potentially life-threatening injuries. If airport and <b>aircraft</b> <b>security</b> measures are to be consistently applied, then consideration should be given to removing items such as glass bottles and glass drinking vessels. However, given the results of a relatively uncomplicated modification of a plastic knife, it may not be possible to remove all dangerous objects from <b>aircraft.</b> <b>Security</b> systems may therefore need to focus on measures such as increased surveillance of passenger behavior, rather than on attempting to eliminate every object that may serve as a potential weapon...|$|E
