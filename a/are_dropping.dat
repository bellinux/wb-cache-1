25|$|They {{deprive the}} sinner of his life; I shall truly {{tell you how}} this is done. The wicked (punishers) remind by (similar) {{punishment}} (their victims) of all sins they had committed in a former life. Being killed they are thrown into a hell which is full of boiling filth. There they stay eating filth, and they are eaten by vermin. And there is an always crowded, hot place, which men deserve for their great sins, and which is full of misery. (The punishers) put them in shackles, beat their bodies, and torment them (by perforating) their skulls with drills. They cut off the sinner's nose with a razor, they cut off both his ears and lips; they pull out his tongue a span's length and torment (him by piercing it) with sharp pikes. There the sinners dripping (with blood) whine day and night even as the dry leaves of a palm-tree (agitated by the wind). Their blood, matter, and flesh <b>are</b> <b>dropping</b> off while they are roasted, their bodies being besmeared with natron. Have you heard of the large, erected caldron of more than man's size, full of blood and matter, which is extremely heated by a fresh fire, in which blood and matter are boiling? The sinners are thrown into it and boiled there, while they utter horrid cries of 'Agony; they are made to drink molten lead and copper when they are thirsty, and they shriek still more horribly. Those evildoers who have here forfeited their souls' (happiness) {{for the sake of}} small (pleasures), and have been born in the lowest births during hundred thousands of million years will stay in this (hell). Their punishment will be adequate to their deeds. The wicked who have committed crimes will atone for them, deprived of all pleasant and lovely objects, by dwelling in the stinking crowded hell, a scene of pain, which is full of flesh.|$|E
500|$|Steinholt {{has stated}} that she feels the {{government}} should reduce unnecessary theory in the vocational education programme in upper secondary school; she believes {{it to be the}} main reason why an increasing numbers of pupils <b>are</b> <b>dropping</b> out of school. The Norwegian Government, Steinholt believes, should increase their funding for vocational education programmes and jobs; she states that people with this type of education [...] "are the cornerstone of our society". Steinholt believes there is a broad consensus in the labor movement that the Contractual Pension (...) bill holds a hostile policy towards the working class. Interpellations led to a debate in the City Council, mainly between Steinholt and County Cabinet leader Odd Eriksen. She believed it would be disrespectful towards workers to deprive them the right of a dignified work age, feeling that forcing them to quit their jobs at the age of 62 is too early.|$|E
500|$|The {{team could}} only manage a draw against Chelsea on 8 September 2001, {{in a game}} {{described}} by The Guardian writer David Lacey as one where [...] "the teams simply battered away at each other until one cracked." [...] Henry scored the winning goal away to newly promoted outfit Fulham; the 3–1 victory moved Arsenal {{to the top of}} the league for the first time in the campaign. Against Bolton Wanderers, Arsenal was held to a 1–1 draw after Jeffers' goal was cancelled out by Michael Ricketts. A win at Derby County, where Henry scored two goals was followed by an identical scoreline against Southampton at the new St. Mary's Stadium. At home to Blackburn Rovers, midfielder Keith Gillespie gave the visitors the lead, before Pirès equalised and Bergkamp put Arsenal in front. A mistake by Lauren presented David Dunn the chance to shoot [...] "from 25 yards" [...] and score. Henry's controlled effort looked to have been the winner for Arsenal, until a pass by Tugay caused goalkeeper Wright to [...] "race out of his goal" [...] – the loose ball was collected by Dunn who shot into the empty net. Although Wenger was disappointed with the manner of the defeat, he saw some encouragement: [...] "What's positive for everyone is that Manchester United <b>are</b> <b>dropping</b> points as well. But we need to rectify the fact we concede goals at home." [...] October ended with a draw against Sunderland, where notably former Arsenal player Stefan Schwarz equalised for the home side and Patrick Vieira missed a penalty.|$|E

2500|$|Ralph Bakshi {{majored in}} cartooning at the High School of Art and Design. He learned his trade at the Terrytoons studio in New York City, {{where he spent}} ten years animating {{characters}} such as Mighty Mouse, Heckle and Jeckle, and Deputy Dawg. At the age of 29, Bakshi was hired to head the animation division of Paramount Pictures as both writer and director, where he produced four experimental short films before the studio closed in 1967. With producer Steve Krantz, Bakshi founded his own studio, Bakshi Productions. In 1969, Ralph's Spot was founded as a division of Bakshi Productions to produce commercials for Coca-Cola and Max, the 2000-Year-Old Mouse, a series of educational shorts paid for by Encyclopædia Britannica. However, Bakshi was uninterested {{in the kind of}} animation he was producing, and wanted to produce something personal. Bakshi was quoted in a 1971 article for the Los Angeles Times as saying that the idea of [...] "grown men sitting in cubicles drawing butterflies floating over a field of flowers, while American planes <b>are</b> <b>dropping</b> bombs in Vietnam and kids are marching in the streets, is ludicrous." [...] Bakshi soon developed Heavy Traffic, a tale of inner-city street life. However, Krantz told Bakshi that studio executives would be unwilling to fund the film because of its content and Bakshi's lack of film experience.|$|E
2500|$|Clear Channel Communications, {{owner of}} many popular radio {{stations}} and affiliated with Super Bowl broadcaster CBS, had also censored or removed many songs from radio following the event, including blacklisting Jackson from receiving airplay as well as focusing on editing rock radio formats in particular. Rolling Stone stated [...] "Stations all over the country, the petition notes, <b>are</b> <b>dropping</b> or editing dozens of songs, including the Who's 'Who Are You,' Lou Reed's 'Walk on the Wild Side,' Pearl Jam's 'Jeremy' and John Mellencamp's 'Jack and Diane.' According to the petition, a Clear Channel programmer combed through the song database for five Denver stations and made changes to everything from Steve Miller's 'Jet Airliner' to Nine Inch Nails' 'Closer.' Cleveland classic-rock station WNCX 98.5 has yanked Warren Zevon's 'Lawyers, Guns and Money,' Pink Floyd's 'Money' and several other classics. 'It's absurd,' says Reed. 'It's like being censored by a squirrel. It's beneath me, it's beneath all these artists. It's done {{by people who are}} very pious and stupid.'" [...] Clear Channel Communications also removed talk-radio host Howard Stern from several of its large-market radio stations within a month of the incident, citing the raunchy content of Stern's show. The FCC fined Clear Channel over allegedly indecent content on the Bubba the Love Sponge radio show. As a result of the incident, some networks established regulations requiring time delays of as much as five minutes for live broadcasts such as awards shows and sporting events. In late 2004, the United States House of Representatives passed a bill to raise the maximum FCC fine penalty from said US$27,500 to US$500,000 per violation; the United States Senate voted to decrease it to US$275,000 per incident, with a cap of US$3 million per day. By June 2006, the two houses reconciled the differences in fine levels, settling for a fine of US$325,000 per violation in the Broadcast Decency Enforcement Act of 2005.|$|E

5000|$|Players first {{drop their}} pieces onto the board. Stewart Culin, H.J.R. Murray, and R.C. Bell {{unfortunately}} did not describe in detail how they <b>are</b> <b>dropped</b> onto the board.

Tiger pieces may not be moved or perform captures until all three tigers have <b>been</b> <b>dropped</b> onto the board which takes three turns. Likewise, oxen pieces may not be moved until all twelve oxen pieces have <b>been</b> <b>dropped</b> onto the board which takes twelve turns. Another method that could be employed is the one used in the Myanmar game of Tiger and Buffaloes. Four oxen pieces would <b>be</b> <b>dropped</b> first, followed by a tiger piece. Then four more oxen pieces would <b>be</b> <b>dropped,</b> followed by another tiger piece. Then the remaining four oxen pieces would <b>be</b> <b>dropped,</b> followed by the last tiger piece.|$|R
