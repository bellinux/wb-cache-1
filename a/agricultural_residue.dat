40|$|Using biomass as {{an energy}} source is often {{mentioned}} {{as an option}} to mitigate the enhancing greenhouse effect. Biomass for energy purposes {{can be obtained from}} dedicated energy crops and/or from <b>agricultural</b> <b>residues.</b> The available amount of residues is large and suggests a significant energy potential. However, most of these residues are currently used as livestock feed, which forms the basis for important proteins in the human diet. Use of residues for energy generation is likely to affect the supply of proteins in human diet, and therefore adaptations in the food system are required to compensate for this loss. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to indicate the adaptations required in the food system, if <b>agricultural</b> <b>residues</b> are used for energy generation instead of livestock feed. For this, three production systems that generate both protein and energy are compared. The difference consists in their production routes followed: (i) energy crops for energy and <b>agricultural</b> <b>residues</b> for feed, (ii) use of <b>agricultural</b> <b>residues</b> for energy and growing protein crops (e. g. beans and pulses) for a vegetarian human diet and (iii) use of <b>agricultural</b> <b>residues</b> for energy and growing feed crops (e. g. wheat) for livestock. The land requirements of the three systems are calculated. The system in which energy crops were used for energy generation and <b>agricultural</b> <b>residues</b> as feed required the smallest amount of land. From a land use perspective, therefore, it is better to produce energy from dedicated energy crops and use <b>agricultural</b> <b>residues</b> for livestock feed. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|The {{availability}} {{and distribution of}} biomass resources are important {{for the development of}} the bioenergy industry in a region. Biomass resources are abundant in China; however, the raw material is severely deficient, which makes the Chinese bioenergy industry an embarrassment and a contradiction. Unclear reserves and distribution and changing trends of biomass resources are the reason for this situation. A collection coefficient model of Chinese <b>agricultural</b> <b>residue</b> resources was established and the spatial and temporal pattern dynamics of <b>agricultural</b> <b>residue</b> resources in the last 30 years were analyzed. The results show that <b>agricultural</b> <b>residue</b> resources increased in stages from 1978 to 2011, including a rapid increase from 1978 to 1999, a significant fall from 2000 to 2004, and a slow increase from 2004 to 2011.

40|$|An {{integrated}} modeling {{strategy is}} developed {{to determine the}} potential for sustainable <b>agricultural</b> <b>residue</b> removal potential for bioenergy production. Agricultural residues {{have been identified as}} a significant potential resource for bioenergy production, but serious questions remain about the sustainability of harvesting residues. Agricultural residues {{play an important role in}} limiting soil erosion from wind and water and in maintaining soil organic carbon. Because of this, multiple factors must be considered when assessing sustainable residue harvest limits. Validated and accepted modeling tools for assessing these impacts include the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation Version 2 (RUSLE 2), the Wind Erosion Prediction System (WEPS), and the Soil Conditioning Index. Currently, these models do not work together as a single integrated model. This dissertation presents an integrated modeling strategy that couples existing datasets with the RUSLE 2 water erosion, WEPS wind erosion, and Soil Conditioning Index soil carbon modeling tools to create a single integrated residue removal modeling system. Using this computational tool, a series of studies were performed. The first investigates <b>agricultural</b> <b>residue</b> removal potential for the state of Iowa. The key conclusions of this study are that under current management practices and crop yields nearly 26. 5 million Mg of <b>agricultural</b> <b>residue</b> are sustainably accessible in the state of Iowa, and that through the adoption of no till practices residue removal could sustainably approach 40 million Mg. The next study provides a spatially comprehensive assessment of sustainable <b>agricultural</b> <b>residue</b> removal potential across the US. This type of assessment is needed to support development and investment decisions for an emerging bioenergy industry. Earlier assessments determining the quantity of <b>agricultural</b> <b>residue</b> that could be sustainably removed for bioenergy production at the regional and national scale faced a number of computational limitations. These limitations included the number of environmental factors, the number of land management scenarios, and the spatial fidelity and spatial extent of the assessment. The study presented here provides estimates of county average and state totals of sustainably available agricultural. The results of the assessment show that in 2011 over 150 million metric tons of agricultural residues could have been sustainably removed across the US. Projecting crop yields and land management practices out to 2030, the assessment determines that over 207 million metric tons of <b>agricultural</b> <b>residue</b> could be sustainably removed for bioenergy production at that time. The next study develops a computational strategy that utilizes data inputs from multiple spatial scales to investigate how variability within individual fields can impact sustainable residue removal. Increased availability of sub-field scale datasets such as grain yield data, high fidelity digital elevation models, and soil characteristic data provides an opportunity to investigate the impacts of sub-field scale variability on sustainable <b>agricultural</b> <b>residue</b> removal. Using three representative fields in Iowa, this paper contrasts the results of current Natural Resources Conservation Services (NRCS) conservation management planning analysis with sub-field scale analysis for rake and bale removal of <b>agricultural</b> <b>residue.</b> The results of the comparison show that the field average assumptions used in the NRCS conservation management planning may lead to unsustainable residue removal decisions for significant portions of some fields.

In this framework, the present study focuses on the quantification of primary <b>agricultural</b> <b>residues</b> in the European Union as a promising feedstock for the bio-based and bioenergy sectors. Harvest indices or residue-to-product ratios (RPRs), determined at crop level, usually enter the computation of primary <b>agricultural</b> <b>residues.</b> Comparing four different functional forms of RPRs in function {{of the level of}} crop yield, we show that exponential forms better simulate the production of crop residues for high levels of annual crop yields. We then complement the RPRs reported in the scientific literature with twenty two exponential forms of RPRs and four fixed RPRs for commodities (or group of commodities) not reported so far. Finally, we estimate that 395 million tonnes of dry matter (Tdm) of primary <b>agricultural</b> <b>residues</b> are produced in Europe in 2013 from more than 130 crop commodities. Out of them, 297 million Tdm should remain in the fields for the maintenance of ecosystem services (using conservative assumptions) and 37 million tonnes are collected for agricultural uses.
