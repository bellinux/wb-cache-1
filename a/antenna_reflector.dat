50|$|One of {{the major}} {{innovations}} of ATS-6 was an in-flight deployable antenna of more than 9 m in diameter. The <b>antenna</b> <b>reflector</b> was furled during launch under the launch vehicle fairing, and was deployed in orbit much like an umbrella. The <b>antenna</b> <b>reflector</b> was built from 48 aluminum ribs, supporting a metallized Dacron mesh.

The solar panels were rigidly mounted on two deployable masts. They were of hemi-cylinder shape, thus providing a relatively constant power (595 W beginning of life). Electric power was supplied during eclipses by two Nickel cadmium batteries of 15-A·h capacity, powering a regulated 30.5-V bus. The satellite dimensions in orbit were 15.8-m width by 8.2-m height.|$|E

40|$|The {{requirements}} for extremely precise and powerful large space <b>antenna</b> <b>reflectors</b> have motivated {{the development of}} a procedure for shape control of the reflector surface. A mathematical optimization procedure has been developed which improves antenna performance while minimizing necessary shape correction effort. In contrast to previous work which proposed controlling the rms distortion error of the surface thereby indirectly improving antenna performance, the current work includes electromagnetic (EM) performance calculations as an integral of the control procedure. The application of the procedure to a radiometer design with a tetrahedral truss backup structure demonstrates the potential for significant improvement.

40|$|Parabolic {{symmetric}} and offset <b>reflector</b> <b>antennas</b> adaptively illuminated using a novel triple-mode feedhorn (TE 11 +TM 01 +TE 21) {{with different}} mode combinations and impedance and radiation performances are presented. The {{combination of the}} radiating modes in a feedhorn with proper amplitude and fixed phase values helps in electronically pointing the main beam of the radiating patterns such as that obtained in a beam-steering antenna with limited beam-scan range. This type of radiation performance virtually creates a displaced phase center location for the feedhorn, which, consequently, adaptively illuminates the <b>reflector</b> <b>antenna</b> surface. Impedance-matching bandwidths are preserved for both <b>reflector</b> <b>antennas</b> similar {{to the case of}} feedhorn alone.

40|$|PhDThis thesis {{presents}} {{a study of}} the radiation characteristics of corner <b>reflector</b> <b>antennas.</b> The influence of the design parameters on the radiation characteristics are assessed using an analytical method and the Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) method. The FDTD method for corner <b>reflector</b> <b>antennas</b> which are electrically small to medium sized antennas is developed in detail. The important subject of the Absorbing Boundary Conditions (ABCs) is studied including a study of Mur ABC and Perfectly Matched Layers. It is shown that both methods reduce the reflections from the boundaries sufficient so that the far-field radiation pattern can be computed accurately. An analytical solution to compute the far-field radiation pattern for infinite comer <b>reflector</b> <b>antennas</b> is derived and used to understand the radiation mechanisms. Based on those results, the FDTD method is used to conduct a parametric study on finite sized comer <b>reflector</b> <b>antennas.</b> Experimental antennas have been built and measured in order to verify the computational predictions. Very good agreement is reported The novel idea of a variable beam-width comer <b>reflector</b> <b>antenna</b> is developed and practical designs of such an antenna are presented. The principle is to design the comer <b>reflector</b> <b>antenna</b> such that the beam-width of the antenna can be precisely modified. Data on the gain and beam-width are presented. This has been done both by computational and by an experimental model. The influence on the performance of the comer <b>reflector</b> <b>antenna</b> when substituting the solid reflector plates by rods has been investigated. The computational predictions have been verified by measurements of an experimental antenna. Very good agreement has been achieved.

Both the [...] "hemi" [...] and zone beams used an <b>antenna</b> <b>reflector</b> 3.2 m in diameter with a 4.2 m focal length.

50|$|In typical systems, {{the scanner}} would be mounted {{so that it}} could be quickly pointed at two {{different}} vertical angles. This could be accomplished by moving the main <b>antenna</b> <b>reflector</b> behind the scanner, or through a variety of electronic means. The system would rapidly switch the scanner between these two angles, while the scanner itself continued to deflect the signal left and right. The location of the shell horizontally was revealed by the timing of the returned signal compared to the rotation of the scanner at that instant. Using traditional pulse timing methods the range of the shell could be determined at the same instant. Simple trigonometry using the range and the known fixed vertical angle of the beam revealed the shell's vertical location. The time it took to cross one beam and then the other revealed the shell's speed.|$|E

50|$|Rain fade refers {{primarily}} to the absorption of a microwave radio frequency (RF) signal by atmospheric rain, snow or ice, and losses which are especially prevalent at frequencies above 11 GHz.

However, it {{does not need to be}} raining at a location for it to be affected by rain fade, as the signal may pass through precipitation many miles away, especially if the satellite dish has a low look angle.
