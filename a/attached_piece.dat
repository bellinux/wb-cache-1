5|$|At {{the same}} time, Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) is visited by her ex-boyfriend, Dennis Duffy (Dean Winters), who informs {{her that he}} is a sex addict, now atoning for his past errors. Liz is unimpressed and asks Dennis to leave, before going to work. Later, after {{arriving}} at work, Liz answers Jenna Maroney's (Jane Krakowski) cellphone, and is surprised to find that Dennis is calling Jenna. Liz pretends to be Jenna and discovers that Jenna and Dennis slept together. Liz is determined not to let this revelation affect her friendship with Jenna, so the two go to confront Dennis about his behavior. During the confrontation, Liz discovers that Jenna and Dennis actually slept together in her bed, leading her to resent Jenna's actions. As a result, she fails to tell Jenna about an improperly <b>attached</b> <b>piece</b> of equipment, leading Jenna to injure her leg.|$|E
25|$|The lyra {{depicted}} on the Byzantine ivory casket of Museo Nazionale, Florence (900 – 1100 AD) has two strings and pear-shaped body with long and narrow neck. The soundboard is depicted without soundholes {{and as a}} distinct and <b>attached</b> <b>piece,</b> however this {{might be due to}} stylistic abstraction. The lyras of Novgorod (1190 AD) are closer morphologically to the present bowed lyras (see gallery): they were pear-shaped and 40cm long; they had semi-circular soundholes and provision for three strings. The middle string served as a drone while fingering the others by finger or fingernail alone, downwards or sidewards against the string, for there was no fingerboard to press them against: a method which gives the notes as clearly as the violin and remains normal in lyras both in Asia as well as on present bowed instruments in post-Byzantine regions such as the Cretan lyra.|$|E
5000|$|In United States markets, {{pork chops}} are {{classified}} as [...] "center-cut" [...] or [...] "shoulder". Lamb chops {{are classified as}} shoulder, blade, rib, loin or kidney, and leg or sirloin chops. The rib chops are narrower, fattier, and tastier, while the loin chops are broader and leaner. Lamb chops are sometimes cut with an <b>attached</b> <b>piece</b> of kidney.|$|E
40|$|Fragment of yellowed woven wool fabric {{with several}} {{small pieces of}} woven fabric sewed on at right angles. Several <b>attached</b> <b>pieces</b> have yellowed warp and weft, others have yellowed warp and purple weft. The small <b>attached</b> <b>pieces</b> may {{have been part of}} the same fabric. One of the yellowed pieces has some purple wefts that wrap around one of the warps, {{possibly}} indicating tapestry. Some of the sewing yarn is red/purple.; Somewhat dirty and worn. There are areas of damaged or missing wefts that leave exposed warps. Some edges are matted. There is some edge fraying. Some luster is still visible, especially in the warp of the main fragment...|$|R
50|$|When a {{piece is}} beveled at both ends, {{such that the}} two <b>attached</b> <b>pieces</b> do not lie in the same plane, a {{three-dimensional}} structure is obtained. In that case, it is also necessary either to rotate the piece in its longitudinal axis, or, to tilt the saw blade before beveling the second end.|$|R
40|$|Fragment {{of brown}} woven wool fabric with {{a row of}} sewing on the {{diagonal}} that has very small pieces of another fabric (possibly the same fabric) caught in the stitches.; Very dirty, with some encrusted mud.

50|$|Puppies learn {{behaviors}} {{quickly by}} following examples set by experienced dogs. This form of intelligence is not particular to those tasks dogs have been bred to perform, {{but can be}} generalized to various abstract problems. For example, Dachshund puppies were set the problem of pulling a cart by tugging on an <b>attached</b> <b>piece</b> of ribbon {{in order to get}} a reward from inside the cart. Puppies that watched an experienced dog perform this task learned the task fifteen times faster than those left to solve the problem on their own.|$|E
50|$|These {{kinds of}} query strings {{are very similar}} to cookies in that both contain {{arbitrary}} pieces of information chosen by the server and both are sent back to the server on every request. However, there are some differences. Since a query string is part of a URL, if that URL is later reused, the same <b>attached</b> <b>piece</b> of information will be sent to the server, which could lead to confusion. For example, if the preferences of a user are encoded in the query string of a URL and the user sends this URL to another user by e-mail, those preferences will be used for that other user as well.|$|E
5000|$|There is no {{collector}} {{mark for}} Sir James Thornhill (1675 or 1676-1734) {{found on the}} drawing.James Thornhill was a painter of the Italianate baroque style. He was identified through an inscribed text on an <b>attached</b> <b>piece</b> of paper ( [...] is now lost due to re-mounting in 1964) on the verso side of the drawing. No 27 Given me by Sr Ja: Thornhill. Oct 1724. JR Jonathan Richard Senior The initials JR was misread as JC and incorrectly attributed to the art collection of Robert Clive, 1st Baron Clive. It was only after close inspection in 1988 that the inscription was attributed to Jonathan Richardson Senior.|$|E
50|$|A staple {{is a type}} of two-pronged fastener, usually metal, {{used for}} joining or binding {{materials}} together. Large staples might be used with a hammer or staple gun for masonry, roofing, corrugated boxes and other heavy-duty uses. Smaller staples are used with a stapler to <b>attach</b> <b>pieces</b> of paper together; such staples are a more permanent and durable fastener for paper documents than the paper clip.|$|R
50|$|The tape {{can be used}} {{to repair}} tears in paper, or to <b>attach</b> <b>pieces</b> of paper or {{cardboard}} together for modelling. On fragile paper surfaces the tape can only be used once, as removing it will either tear the paper or remove the top layer of rough cardboard; on smooth painted surfaces it can generally be removed without leaving any trace. It does not affix items to such surfaces permanently.|$|R
50|$|The {{back stitch}} {{can also be}} used as a hand sewing utility stitch to <b>attach</b> two <b>pieces</b> of fabric together.|$|R
50|$|A tea bag is a small, porous, sealed bag {{containing}} {{dried plant}} material, which is immersed {{in boiling water}} to make a tea or an infusion. Classically these are tea leaves (Camellia sinensis), but the term is also used for herbal teas (tisanes) made of herbs or spices. Tea bags are commonly made of filter paper or food-grade plastic, or occasionally of silk. The bag contains the tea leaves while the tea is steeped, {{making it easier to}} dispose of the leaves, and performs the same function as a tea infuser. Some tea bags have an <b>attached</b> <b>piece</b> of string with a paper label at the top that assists in removing the bag while also displaying the brand or variety of tea.|$|E
50|$|The Detour of this leg was {{a choice}} between Lock and Knock. In Lock, teams {{had to go to}} Al-Tamimi Curio Shop and look through artisanal wooden chests, each one carved with a secret {{compartment}} into the main drawer, for a key with an <b>attached</b> <b>piece</b> of paper showing a symbol. Once they found the key, they had to find a cabinet with the same symbol and unlock it to release their next clue. In Knock, teams had to travel through the streets of Stone Town to locate three royal doors and knock on each of them to receive a wooden carving of a lion, serpent and a falcon. Upon collecting all three carvings, they then had to deliver them to a marked shop on Gizenga Street and exchange the carvings for their next clue.|$|E

5000|$|The {{string trimmer}} {{was invented in}} the early 1970s by George Ballas of Houston, Texas, who {{conceived}} the idea while watching the revolving action of the cleaning brushes in an automatic car wash. His first trimmer was made by <b>attaching</b> <b>pieces</b> of heavy-duty fishing line to a popcorn can bolted to an edger. Ballas developed this into {{what he called the}} [...] "Weed Eater", since it chewed up the grass and weeds around trees.|$|R

50|$|The Byzantine lyra had rear tuning pegs {{set in a}} flat peg {{similarly}} to the medieval fiddle and unlike the rabāb and rebec.
