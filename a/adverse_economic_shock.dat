40|$|We use {{survey data}} to {{investigate}} how urban households in Ethiopia coped {{with the food}} price shock in 2008 and idiosyncratic shocks. Qualitative data indicate that the high food price inflation {{was by far the}} most <b>adverse</b> <b>economic</b> <b>shock</b> between 2004 and 2008, and that a significant proportion of households had to adjust food consumption in response. Difference-indifferences estimates of the effects on consumption indicate that assets improved households ‟ ability to cope with the shock, and that casual workers were particularly adversely affected by high food prices. Similar results are obtained from econometric analysis of self-reported data on the food price effects. In contrast, we find that household demographics and education matter little for the impact of the shock. Our analysis of idiosyncratic shocks further indicates that losing one‟s job is a serious, uninsurable shock. We interpret the results as pointing to the importance of growth in the formal sector so as to generate more well-paid and stable jobs.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} how dollarization affects the internal wage {{structure in the}} Mexican labor market, and alters the incentives of Mexican nationals to emigrate to the United States. A simple model shows that by adopting a fixed rate regime tied directly to the U. S. dollar, Mexican policy makers are in effect giving up “a degree of freedom” in their toolkit of policy remedies. If there are imperfections in the Mexican economy, such as downward wage rigidity, an <b>adverse</b> <b>economic</b> <b>shock</b> would generate more unemployment in a dollarized economy, further increasing the propensity of Mexican workers to migrate to the United States. The adverse effects of dollarization could be reversed if {{the adoption of the}} dollar as a medium of exchange signals a more stable Mexican economy, reduces political inefficiency in the monetary system, and helps to attract more foreign capital. The paper also investigates how legal and illegal flows of Mexican immigrants respond to relative changes in economic conditions between the two countries. It turns out that the illegal flow is very sensitive to relative economic conditions, but that the flow of legal immigrants is not. Dollarization will then have a relatively weak impact on the total number of immigrants because legal immigrants make up a relatively large part of the total flow and their numbers are insensitive to economic variables...|$|E
40|$|Some {{analysts and}} {{business}} executives are becoming concerned that recent {{increases in the}} consumer debt burden may foreshadow an economic slowdown. Higher debt increases the risk that a household may experience financial distress {{in the event of}} an <b>adverse</b> <b>economic</b> <b>shock,</b> such as the loss of a job or large uninsured medical expenses. As the risk of financial distress rises, households may become less willing to spend on consumer goods, particularly big ticket items such as automobiles and home computers, which in turn would hurt economic growth. > Different measures of the consumer debt burden are currently giving conflicting signals about the seriousness of the problem. It is not clear whether these measures have been useful indicators of consumer spending and economic growth in the past. Moreover, a measure of the debt burden that was useful in the past might be unreliable today if recent changes in the financial system, such as greater use of credit cards, are distorting the relationship between consumer debt and real economic variables. > Garner examines whether various measures of the consumer debt burden can reliably predict a slowdown in economic growth. He concludes that analysts should continue to monitor various measures of the consumer debt burden, but these measures are not highly reliable in predicting future economic slowdowns.

40|$|The {{impact of}} the recent global {{financial}} crisis on the global economy has highlighted the level of integration of economies and the potential spillover effects as a result thereof. The implications are that {{the negative effects of}} the crisis can quickly spread to other economies through numerous transmission mechanisms. The response of developing or emerging economies to these unpredictable exogenous shocks becomes a topical issue. The concepts of economic vulnerability to and resilience against adverse exogenous shocks for emerging economies have since taken centre stage in many economic forums. Policy makers for emerging economies have come to the realisation that the increased economic vulnerability and a lack of economic resilience in their economies can erode the hard-fought-for gains in economic growth over the past decade and potentially harm their prospects as attractive destinations for foreign direct investment (FDI). This research analysed the resilience and vulnerability of emerging economies against adverse shocks using the sub-Saharan African (SSA) region as a case. The research used previous literature on emerging economies’ vulnerability and resilience to formulate four hypotheses around the major overarching themes of vulnerability and resilience. Two hypotheses looked at two functions of vulnerability, i. e. trade openness and financial integration, and two functions of resilience, i. e. international reserves accumulation and economic concentration. The findings of this research study were that SSA economies were vulnerable and not resilient against adverse exogenous shocks, and that few economies in the SSA region were prepared to successfully manoeuvre in an economic crisis. The structure of these economies inherently rendered these economies vulnerable. However, these economic structures also allowed the SSA region to achieve the high economic growth experienced during the past decade. The output of the methodology utilised in this research study resulted in a model {{that can be used to}} reduce the likelihood of an SSA economy being severely affected by an <b>adverse</b> <b>economic</b> <b>shock.</b> Dissertation (MBA) [...] University of Pretoria, 2013. ccgibs 2014 Gordon Institute of Business Science (GIBS) MBAUnrestricte...|$|E

40|$|The recent low {{interest}} regime of most central {{banks in the}} world raises several questions. First, {{it appears that the}} interest rates may have been too low during periods of recessions. Second, the key policy rates seem to stay low even after signals of improved economic conditions. Considering this, we question whether monetary policy truly considers the optimal development of the domestic economy? Or are interdependencies between different central banks limiting the freedom for domestic optimal monetary policies? This thesis aim to highlight how monetary policy interdependencies and inflation targeting can be better understood using game theoretic intuition. Our point of departure is a static New Keynesian framework for optimal monetary policy. Then, we illustrate how an economy mainly considering its domestic economy will react to foreign interest rates. By extending the framework to allow for interdependencies, we illustrate how Nash-behavior drive two central banks to respond more aggressively to each other’s interest rate. This results in a “race to the bottom” in the key policy rate levels when the economies are hit by an <b>adverse</b> <b>economic</b> <b>shock.</b> Further, we argue that certain mechanisms might contribute to a prisoner’s dilemma hindering key policy rates to return to “normal” levels after an economic shock. We also derive a theoretical cooperative interest rate equilibrium between the two central banks. Here we illustrate how the central banks can facilitate each other’s monetary policy and thus reduce the aggregate loss of both economies. To shed empirical light on these mechanisms, we then compare the key policy rate of nine inflation targeting economies to the Taylor rate. Our analysis find some evidence of key policy rates being systematically below the Taylor rate during and after the Dotcom bubble recession. During and after the Financial crisis recession, there are stronger evidence for key policy rates deviating significantly from the Taylor rate. This, suggest that the interest rate levels were too low. At last we find some evidence of a negatively sloped trend in the key policy rates compared to the Taylor rate. This, we argue, might indicate that the monetary policy strategy has become more aggressive over time. If this is true, it calls for a revision of how inflation targeting is carried out, incorporating game theoretic intuition. Further, the discussion concerning global monetary policy coordination might also have to be revised...|$|E
40|$|Paper 1 : A Field Experiment of Discrimination in the Norwegian Housing Market: Gender, Class, and Ethnicity We {{test for}} gender, class, and ethnic {{discrimination}} in the Norwegian rental housing market using fake application letters. Females, individuals with high job status, and ethnic Norwegians {{are more likely to}} receive positive responses. For example, being an Arabic man and working in a warehouse is associated with a 25 percentage point lower probability of receiving a positive response when showing interest in an apartment as compared to an ethnically Norwegian female economist. We conclude that gender, class, and ethnic discrimination do exist in the Norwegian housing market, and ethnic discrimination seems to be the most prevalent form of discrimination. Paper 2 : Positional Concerns among the Poor: Does Reference Group Matter? Evidence from Survey Experiments In general, previous research on positional concerns suggests a lower degree of positional concerns among people from poor countries. Yet the evidence is limited and most often builds on the assumption that people’s reference groups are given, (often referring to other people in the society) and are the same across all individuals. In this paper, we test if low positional concerns found in the literature may be due to misspecification of the reference groups. We contribute to the limited literature by estimating the positional concerns in a low-income country considering various reference groups. We do so by testing the effect of different reference groups on the positional concerns of a representative sample of individuals in urban Ethiopia. We use a tailored survey experiment that is modified to include multiplicity of reference groups. The results show a low degree of positional concern for income, and that the degree of positional concern is highly stable across different reference groups. Paper 3 : Migration, Remittances and Household Welfare in Ethiopia This paper investigates the effect of international remittances and migration on household welfare in Ethiopia. We employ both subjective (a household’s subjective economic well-being) and objective measures (asset holdings and asset accumulation) to define household welfare. A matching approach is applied to address self-selection, and by exploiting information before and after the households began receiving remittances, the study sheds light on the changes in welfare associated with international migration and remittances. The results reveal that remittances {{have a significant impact on}} a welfare variable that has previously not received much attention in the migration literature, namely household subjective economic well-being. In addition, we find that remittances have positive effects on consumer asset accumulation, especially in rural areas, but no effect on productive assets. Paper 4 : Do International Remittances Stimulate Private Transfers? Panel Data Evidence from Urban Ethiopia International remittances can have important impacts on the households who receive them. However, the effects of remittances might also carry trickle-down effects on other households in the migrant origin country through informal systems of private transfers. Using rich panel data from urban Ethiopia spanning more than a decade, we investigate how international remittances affect the sending of private transfers. The results show that receiving international remittances increases the likelihood of sending internal transfers among low-educated households, while the same effect is not found for highly educated households. The difference in transfer response to remittances between low-educated and highly-educated households seems to be partly driven by differences in transfer behaviour during an <b>adverse</b> <b>economic</b> <b>shock...</b>|$|E
40|$|Five {{self-contained}} papers constitute this thesis. Paper 1 : Does fertilizer use {{respond to}} rainfall variability? Panel data evidence from urban Ethiopia In this article, we use farmers’ actual experiences {{with changes in}} rainfall levels and their responses to these changes to assess whether patterns of fertilizer use are responsive to changes in rainfall patterns. Using panel data from the Central Highlands of Ethiopia matched with corresponding village-level rainfall data, {{the results show that}} the intensity of current year’s fertilizer use is positively associated with higher rainfall levels experienced in the previous year. Rainfall variability, on the other hand, impacts fertilizer use decisions negatively, implying that variability raises the risks and uncertainty associated with fertilizer use. Abundant rainfall in the previous year could depict relaxed liquidity constraints and increased affordability of fertilizer, which makes rainfall availability critical in severely credit-constrained environments. In light of similar existing literature, the major contribution of the study is that it uses panel data to explicitly examine farmers’ responses to actual weather changes and variability. Paper 2 : Household-level consumption in urban Ethiopia: The effects of a large food price shock We use survey data to investigate how urban households in Ethiopia coped with the food price shock in 2008. Qualitative data indicate that the high food price inflation was by far the most <b>adverse</b> <b>economic</b> <b>shock</b> between 2004 and 2008, and that a significant proportion of households had to adjust food consumption in response. Regression results indicate that households with low asset levels, and casual workers, were particularly adversely affected by high food prices. We interpret the results as pointing to the importance of growth in the formal sector so as to generate more well-paid and stable jobs. Paper 3 : The impact of food price inflation on consumer welfare in urban Ethiopia: A quadratic almost ideal demand system approach This paper investigates the impact of food price inflation on consumer welfare in urban Ethiopia 2004 - 2009. A quadratic almost ideal demand system (QUAIDS) is estimated using data from 2000 to 2009. Statistical tests suggest the QUAIDS is preferred over the conventionally used AIDS model. Compensating variation calculated using estimated price elasticities shows that from 2004 to 2009, households in urban Ethiopia lost an equivalent of 15 percent of their food budget annually due to the unprecedented food price inflation. Poor households, who spend a higher proportion of their budget on food, were affected more adversely than non-poor households. Moreover, with a more or less uniform increase in the price of major food items, households in urban Ethiopia appear to have limited options for substitution. These findings can provide important information to policy makers and can help aid organizations design and implement better social assistance schemes in the future. Paper 4 : What do policy makers know about the factors influencing citizens’ subjective well-being? In light of the increased interest in using subjective well-being as an outcome variable beyond GDP, as for example argued by the Stiglitz Commission, there is an interest in analyzing policymakers’ knowledge on what variables influence citizens’ subjective well-being. We elicit what policymakers guess influence citizens’ subjective well-being with a focus on environmental variables. Our study, conducted on policymakers in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, shows large heterogeneity in their guesses. Overall, we find that the factors that correlate with citizens’ subjective well-being in Addis Ababa are similar to those found in rich Western countries. Moreover, there is a low correlation between what policymakers guess affects citizens’ subjective well-being and our empirical findings on the matter. As an alternative check for the similarities between citizens’ and policymakers’ preferences, we also undertook a ranking exercise of setting priority areas. Compared to the citizens, policymakers put more weight on longer-term projects. By and large, our study indicates that policymakers have a heterogeneous, and hence a non-negligible proportion of them have a fairly poor understanding of what correlates with citizens’ subjective well-being...|$|E

40|$|Rising {{levels of}} {{household}} indebtedness have created {{concerns about the}} vulnerabilities of households to <b>adverse</b> <b>economic</b> <b>shocks</b> and the impact on financial stability. To assess these risks, the author presents a formal stress-testing framework that uses microdata to simulate how various <b>economic</b> <b>shocks</b> affect {{the distribution of the}} debt-service ratio (DSR) for the household sector. Data from an Ipsos Reid Canadian Financial Monitor survey are used to construct the actual DSR distribution for households. Changes in the distribution are then simulated using a macro scenario describing the evolution of some aggregate variables, and micro behavioural relationships; for example, to simulate credit growth for individual households, cross-sectional data are used to estimate debt-growth equations as a function of household income, interest rates and housing prices. The simulated distributions provide information on vulnerabilities in the household sector. The author also describes a combined methodology where changes in the probability of default on household loans are used as a metric to evaluate the quantitative impact of negative employment shocks on the resilience of households and loan losses at financial institutions...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the vulnerability of}} labour markets to <b>adverse</b> <b>economic</b> <b>shocks.</b> We define labour market exposure as the cumulated amount of excess unemployment generated by a shock before unemployment returns to steady-state. We use a panel of 19 countries covering the period 1985 – 2010 to assess the influence of labour market policies on labour market exposure, which is also calcu-lated country by country. We find that less generous unemployment insurance, more active labour market policies or a lower minimum wage imply a trade-off between average unemployment and labour market exposure, as they help low-skilled workers {{to get out of}} unemployment at the cost of increased vulnerability to adverse shocks. On the other hand, reducing the tax wedge is conducive to both lower steady-state unemployment and labour market exposure. —Alain de Serres and Fabrice Murtin Un em plo ym en t a t ri...|$|R
