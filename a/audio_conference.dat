This paper presents {{the first study}} {{of the use of}} such a system. Drawing on log files collected over six weeks of use by over 1300 corporate employees, and interviews with 10 of them, we look at how and why various features of the system are used and what sorts of practices are supported. Our findings shed light on the factors that drive the use of visual enhancements to <b>audio</b> <b>conferencing,</b> and suggest further research topics.

40|$|Today, we are {{interconnected}} {{almost all}} over the planet. Large multinational companies operate worldwide, but also {{an increasing number of}} small and medium sized companies do business overseas. As people travel to meet and do businesses, the already exposed earth is subject to even more strain. <b>Audio</b> <b>conferencing</b> is an attractive alternative to travel, which {{is becoming more and more}} appreciated. <b>Audio</b> <b>conferences</b> can of course not replace all types of meetings, but can help companies to cut travel costs and to reduce the environmental strain. The continuously growing market for <b>audio</b> <b>conferencing</b> systems proves that <b>audio</b> <b>conferencing</b> will play an important part in future communication solutions. This thesis treats digital signal processing methods and algorithms for single microphone <b>audio</b> <b>conferencing</b> systems. Concrete real problems, all in relation to <b>audio</b> <b>conferencing</b> systems, are discussed. An intrinsic problem to an <b>audio</b> <b>conferencing</b> system is the acoustic echoes picked up by the microphone. Acoustic echoes are generally cancelled using adaptive fi ltering. In such adaptive filter systems, a major difficulty is to achieve robustness in situations where both participants in a conversation are talking simultaneously. This thesis presents methods and solutions, focusing on the use of parallel adaptive fi lters, which provides the desired robustness. <b>Audio</b> <b>conferencing</b> systems are consumer electronic products and the manufacturing cost is a constant issue. Therefore, it is desirable to implement solutions on low-cost fi nite precision processors. A method to reduce fi nite precision effects in parallel filter implementations is presented in he thesis. In order to run algorithms on low-cost processors it is necessary to keep the computational complexity low. The thesis proposes a number of different methods to reduce complexity,including specific methods targeted for wideband solutions and systems equipped with extension microphones. A high quality <b>audio</b> <b>conferencing</b> system should be equipped with some sort of noise reduction feature. In the end of the thesis a method for integrating such noise reduction with the acoustic echo cancellation is presented. The performance of the proposed methods and algorithms are demonstrated through simulations as well as on real acoustic systems...|$|R

40|$|The goal of {{this thesis}} was to {{optimize}} a <b>audio</b> <b>conferencing</b> system that communicate via the standard Wi-Fi network {{and to provide a}} maximum transmission delay of 5 ms (one way end to end delay of 10 ms) when coexisting with an interferer that use up to 50 % of the channel bandwidth. First the QoS performance provided by the existing 5 th generation Wi-Fi standard is analysed in detail. The performance provided by WMM feature in the standard did not satisfy the requirements of the <b>audio</b> <b>conferencing</b> system. This lead to designing a protocol at the application layer (WHAP) that provided scheduling and retransmission mechanism that made it possible to achieve the required performance. The WHAP based <b>audio</b> <b>conferencing</b> BSS was analysed under different interference scenarios both in theory and in simulated environment using network simulator OPNET. The results show the possibility to provide the required performance when coexisting with an interference of up to 50 % as targeted. Finally, it can be concluded that the performance of the <b>audio</b> <b>conferencing</b> setup configured with WHAP enabled stations provide much better performance compared to the available state-of-art standard techniques.
