40|$|Moral {{dilemmas}} engender {{conflicts between}} two traditions: consequentialism, which evaluates actions {{based on their}} outcomes, and deontology, which evaluates actions themselves. These strikingly resemble two distinct decision-making architectures: <b>a</b> model-based <b>system</b> <b>that</b> selects actions based on inferences about their consequences; and <b>a</b> model-free <b>system</b> <b>that</b> selects actions based on their reinforcement history. Here, I consider how these <b>systems,</b> along with <b>a</b> Pavlovian <b>system</b> <b>that</b> responds reflexively to rewards and punishments, can illuminate puzzles in moral psychology...|$|R

5|$|A second {{conflict}} emerged {{just before}} the end of his term, when in 1945, the Labour government sought to abolish the country quota, <b>a</b> <b>system</b> <b>that</b> gave additional electoral seats in rural areas. Farming groups – predominantly National-supporting – strongly opposed the move, and argued that such a major change could only be made after gaining approval in a general election. Newall sympathised, and advised Fraser to wait until after the election, but did not feel it was appropriate to intervene; he assented to the bill.|$|E
5|$|Although {{a primary}} {{concern of the}} Sprint missile was high speed, the design was not {{optimized}} for maximum energy, but instead relied on the first stage (booster) to provide as much thrust as possible. This left the second stage (sustainer) lighter than optimal, to improve its maneuverability. Staging was under ground control, with the booster cut away from the missile body by explosives. The sustainer was not necessarily ignited immediately, depending on the flight profile. For control, the first stage used <b>a</b> <b>system</b> <b>that</b> injected Freon into the exhaust to cause thrust vectoring to control the flight. The second stage used small air vanes for control.|$|E

Inevitably, Michael notices and tries to get Jim to admit that he's having a party, while Jim acts nonchalantly as if nothing is happening. In order to keep Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) from exposing the party, Jim tells him {{that it is a}} surprise party for Michael.|$|E

Insero Horsens, a Danish venture company, has provided a significant investment to help ECTunes fully develop its technology.|$|E
5|$|Early {{members of}} the group often proselytized on street corners for hours, and Clarence13X's assistants led classes about the group's teachings, {{strictly}} enforcing study habits. He instructed his followers to memorize his teachings on the significance of numbers and letters. Once they did so, they were said to gain an understanding of profound truths. These lessons were taught in a form that resembled catechisms. Rather than hold services in mosques, they gathered for monthly meetings known as parliaments, which were often held outdoors. Attendees were given wide freedom to speak in <b>a</b> <b>system</b> <b>that</b> Ted Swedenburg of the University of Arkansas has compared to Quaker meetings.|$|E
5|$|Horseshoe crabs convert {{nitrogenous}} wastes to ammonia {{and dump}} it via their gills, and excrete other wastes as feces via the anus. They also have nephridia ("little kidneys"), which extract other wastes for excretion as urine. Ammonia is so toxic {{that it must}} be diluted rapidly with large quantities of water. Most terrestrial chelicerates cannot afford to use so much water and therefore convert nitrogenous wastes to other chemicals, which they excrete as dry matter. Extraction is by various combinations of nephridia and Malpighian tubules. The tubules filter wastes out of the blood and dump them into the hindgut as solids, <b>a</b> <b>system</b> <b>that</b> has evolved independently in insects and several groups of arachnids.|$|E

5|$|In 1951, she ran {{again for}} city council, and was successful.

It also included provisions for civil service reform, requiring that city jobs be filled by merit selection rather than patronage. In the November elections, Democrats won control of city government from Republicans {{for the first time in}} 67 years. After narrowly winning a primary race against labor lawyer Harry Galfand, Dallas was elected as a part of that wave, winning 54% of the vote in the new 8th district (covering Chestnut Hill, Germantown, and Roxborough) over incumbent Republican councilman Robert S. Hamilton (the new charter did away with multi-member council districts).|$|E
5|$|In Europe, {{others were}} {{also working on}} the {{development}} of sound-on-film. In 1919, the same year that DeForest received his first patents in the field, three German inventors, Josef Engl (1893–1942), Hans Vogt (1890–1979), and Joseph Massolle (1889–1957), patented the Tri-Ergon sound system. On September 17, 1922, the Tri-Ergon group gave a public screening of sound-on-film productions—including a dramatic talkie, Der Brandstifter (The Arsonist) —before an invited audience at the Alhambra Kino in Berlin. By the end of the decade, Tri-Ergon would be the dominant European sound system. In 1923, two Danish engineers, Axel Petersen and Arnold Poulsen, patented <b>a</b> <b>system</b> <b>that</b> recorded sound on a separate filmstrip running parallel with the image reel.
