5|$|On {{account of}} his {{residency}} in England, Denny Fairfax appointed Martin <b>and</b> <b>Jones</b> as managers of the proprietary. Martin <b>and</b> <b>Jones</b> placed advertisements in newspapers petitioning proprietary tenants to bring their claims against the Lord Fairfax estate forward and prove them. The descendants of William Fairfax continued to assert back claims against the estates of Lord Fairfax, which had been rendered by William Fairfax prior to 1757. In order to absolve himself of these back claims, Denny Fairfax renounced his appointments of Martin <b>and</b> <b>Jones,</b> and instead appointed Bryan Fairfax, 8th Lord Fairfax of Cameron as the sole steward of the proprietary in an official transposition in London on September 21, 1784.|$|E
