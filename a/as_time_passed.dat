5|$|<b>As</b> <b>time</b> <b>passed,</b> {{a number}} of serious {{concerns}} confronted the company. Enron had recently faced several serious operational challenges, namely logistical difficulties in operating a new broadband communications trading unit, and the losses from constructing the Dabhol Power project, a large power plant in India. There was also increasing criticism of the company for the role that its subsidiary Enron Energy Services had in the California electricity crisis of 2000–2001.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} Marcos was campaigning to become President, Imelda's {{influence}} in Marcos's political career was crucial. Her husband {{may have been}} a good tactician, but it was Imelda's determination and popularity that ensured votes for him. Marcos heavily relied on Imelda, and <b>as</b> <b>time</b> <b>passed,</b> Imelda was no longer a clone of Marcos. Instead, she had become his political partner.|$|E
5|$|Outside of cricket, Barnes {{followed}} his mother into property development (see above) and {{at various times}} entered into partnerships with Keith Miller and Norman Von Nida.

5|$|The {{earliest}} records surrounding {{development of}} the Standard Schnauzer in Germany come from the late 19th century. They were originally bred to be medium-sized farm dogs in Germany, equally suited to ratting, herding, and guarding property. <b>As</b> <b>time</b> <b>passed,</b> farmers bred the Standard Schnauzer into a smaller, more compact size for ratting by combining it with the Affenpinscher and Miniature Poodle. The first recorded Miniature Schnauzer appeared in 1888, and the first exhibition was held in 1899.|$|E
5|$|The painting, {{the figures}} painted from life when possible, {{does not contain}} all the signers. Some had died and images could not be located. One figure {{had participated in the}} {{drafting}} but did not sign the final document; another refused to sign. In fact the membership of the Second Continental Congress changed <b>as</b> <b>time</b> <b>passed,</b> and the figures in the painting were never in the same room at the same time.|$|E
5|$|As {{the weeks}} {{extended}} well beyond his initial optimistic forecast, Wild established and maintained routines and activities {{to relieve the}} tedium. A permanent lookout was kept {{for the arrival of}} the rescue ship, cooking and housekeeping rotas were established, and there were hunting trips for seal and penguin. Concerts were held on Saturdays, and anniversaries celebrated, but there were growing feelings of despondency <b>as</b> <b>time</b> <b>passed</b> with no sign of the ship. The toes on Blackborow's left foot became gangrenous from frostbite, and on 15 June had to be amputated by the surgeons Macklin and James McIlroy in the candle-lit hut. Using the very last of the chloroform that had survived in the medical supplies, the whole procedure took 55minutes, and was a complete success.|$|E
50|$|Another {{controversy}} regarding Mr. Jaiswal arose when during {{attending a}} cultural event in Kanpur he made sexist remarks against women by saying '(A new victory {{and a new}} marriage have their own importance. But <b>as</b> <b>times</b> <b>passes,</b> the memories of a victory go old and <b>as</b> <b>time</b> <b>passes,</b> a wife gets old, the same charm is not there) although he later apologized. His remarks received nationwide criticism and even a petition was filed against him in the Court by Women Organizations.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe deteriorating job {{scheduling}} problems have received increasing attention recently. However, most researchers {{assume that the}} actual job processing time is a linear function of its starting time. In fact, in some situations, the deterioration rate might increase or decrease <b>as</b> <b>time</b> <b>passes.</b> For example, {{the temperature of the}} ingot in the rolling machine might drop at a slower pace as the surface cools down. Thus, the drop of the ingot temperature might have a decreasing rate. On the other hand, the time to control a fire might go dramatically <b>as</b> <b>time</b> <b>passes,</b> and the <b>time</b> to cease a fire might have an increasing rate. In this paper, we propose a new deteriorating model where the deterioration rate might be increasing or decreasing <b>as</b> <b>time</b> <b>passes.</b> Under the proposed model, we provide the optimal solutions for some single-machine problems and some flowshop problems...|$|R

5|$|Early 20th-century weight limits were enacted {{to protect}} dirt and gravel roads from {{damage caused by}} the solid wheels of heavy trucks. <b>As</b> <b>time</b> <b>passed,</b> truck weight limits focused {{primarily}} on gross weight limits (which had no prescribed limits on length). By 1974, bridges received special protection from increasing truck weight limits. The bridge formula law was enacted by the U.S. Congress to limit the weight-to-length ratio of heavy trucks, and to protect roads and bridges from {{the damage caused by}} the concentrated weight of shorter trucks. The formula effectively lowers the legal weight limit for shorter trucks, preventing them from causing premature deterioration of bridges and highway infrastructure.|$|E
5|$|Early in his career, Peart's {{performance}} {{style was}} {{deeply rooted in}} hard rock. He drew most of his inspiration from drummers such as Keith Moon and John Bonham, players {{who were at the}} forefront of the British hard rock scene. <b>As</b> <b>time</b> <b>passed,</b> he began to emulate jazz and big band musicians Gene Krupa and Buddy Rich. In 1994, Peart became a friend and pupil of jazz instructor Freddie Gruber. It was during this time that Peart decided to revamp his playing style by incorporating jazz and swing components. Gruber was also responsible for introducing him to the products of Drum Workshop, the company whose products Peart currently endorses.|$|E
5|$|For much of {{its early}} life, the school {{consisted}} only of Nathan Smith and a small class of students, operating in borrowed space at Dartmouth College. Students of Smith were educated as apprentices, and received a Bachelor of Medicine degree upon graduation. Like Dartmouth College as a whole, the medical school had continual funding shortages. <b>As</b> <b>time</b> <b>passed,</b> however, the popularity of both the medical instruction and the basic sciences taught at the school drew undergraduates and training physicians alike. Soliciting funds {{from the state of}} New Hampshire, Smith was able to obtain medical equipment and, by 1811, a dedicated physical plant for the school.|$|E

5|$|From 1881 on, Pedro II's health began failing. He {{gradually}} {{withdrew from}} public affairs <b>as</b> <b>time</b> <b>passed.</b> Weary of being {{tied to a}} throne which he doubted would survive his death, he persevered out of duty and because there seemed no immediate alternative. Nor did his daughter and heir, Isabel, exhibit a desire to assume the crown. Both, however, were overwhelmingly beloved by the Brazilian people, who still supported the monarchy. The indifference towards the Imperial system by the Emperor and his daughter allowed a discontented republican minority to grow more audacious and to eventually launch the coup that overthrew the Empire.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{the living}} {{conditions}} of the Robinsons varied according {{to whether or not}} they had had time to prepare. There were roughly three days between the signing of the capitulation and the deadline for civilians to leave the city, during which those who made the decision to stay could stockpile food and water, and camouflage their hiding places. <b>As</b> <b>time</b> <b>passed,</b> supplies ran out, and many Robinsons had to change their locations for security reasons. The situation soon became equally desperate for all who remained.|$|E
5|$|Iori is {{a violent}} and sadistic person {{who suffers from}} trauma because of his clan's past. In ancient times, the Yagami clan {{was known as the}} Yasakani. With the help of the Yata and Kusanagi clans, they sealed the demon Orochi. <b>As</b> <b>time</b> <b>passed,</b> the Yasakani, tired of living {{in the shadow of the}} Kusanagi, made a blood pact with Orochi. This gave them greater powers, but in return, they and their {{descendants}} were forever cursed. They renamed their clan the Yagami and set out to destroy the Kusanagi with their new powers. In response, the Kusanagi declared war on the Yagami, which led to many clan members on both sides being killed.|$|E

5|$|On {{the other}} side, {{there were still}} huge numbers of Roman Catholics. Some conformed, bending with the times, hoping {{that there would be}} a fresh reverse. Vestments were still hidden, golden candlesticks bequeathed, chalices kept. The Mass was still celebrated in some places {{alongside}} the new Communion service but was more difficult than before. Both Roman Catholic priests and laity lived a double life, apparently conforming, but avoiding taking the oath of conformity. Only <b>as</b> <b>time</b> <b>passed</b> did recusancy—refusal to attend Protestant services—became more common. Jesuits and seminary priests, trained in Douai and Rome to make good the losses of English priests, encouraged this.|$|E
5|$|The Princess {{was married}} by proxy to PedroII in 1843. Her spouse's {{expectations}} {{had been raised}} when a portrait was presented that depicted Teresa Cristina as an idealized beauty, but he was displeased by his bride's plain looks upon their first meeting later that year. Despite a cold beginning, the couple's relationship improved <b>as</b> <b>time</b> <b>passed,</b> due primarily to Teresa Cristina's patience, kindness, generosity and simplicity. These traits also helped her win {{the hearts of the}} Brazilian people, and her distance from political controversies shielded her from criticism. She also sponsored archaeological studies in Italy and Italian immigration to Brazil.|$|E
5|$|Yagan {{would have}} been about 35 years old in 1829 when British {{settlers}} landed {{in the area and}} established the Swan River Colony. For {{the first two years of}} the colony, relations between settlers and Noongar were generally amicable, as there was little competition for resources. The Noongar welcomed the white settlers as Djanga, the returned spirits of their dead. Historical reports noted the two groups shared fish. <b>As</b> <b>time</b> <b>passed,</b> conflicts between the two cultures gradually became more frequent. The settlers incorrectly thought that the Noongar were nomads who had no claim to the land over which they roamed. Colonists fenced off land for grazing and farming according to their traditional practices of land use.|$|E
