5|$|Self-managed work teams (also {{referred}} to as autonomous work groups) allow their members to make a greater contribution at work and constitute a significant competitive advantage for the organization. These work teams determine how they will accomplish the objectives they are mandated to achieve and decide what route they will take to complete the current assignment. Self-managed work teams are granted the responsibility of planning, scheduling, organizing, directing, controlling and evaluating their own work process. They also select their own members <b>and</b> <b>evaluate</b> <b>the</b> members' performance. Self-managed work teams have been favored for their effectiveness over traditionally managed teams due their ability to enhance productivity, costs, customer service, quality, and safety.|$|E
5|$|The Atlantis {{crew had}} two Florida return {{opportunities}} for the day, {{as well as two}} for a California landing, giving the managers time to evaluate the weather and use California if necessary. After choosing to pass on the first opportunity for KSC <b>and</b> <b>evaluate</b> <b>the</b> second, managers on the ground decided that the weather in Florida was too dynamic to risk bringing the orbiter in, and opted to land at Edwards Air Force Base instead. The de-orbit burn was initiated at 14:24 UTC, a burn of the shuttle's engines that brought it out of orbit to begin the orbiter's reentry into the Earth's atmosphere. Atlantis successfully landed at Edwards Air Force Base on Runway 22 at 8:39am PDT after 197 orbits in space and a distance of approximately 5.2million miles.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} cancers {{in the brain}} come from {{elsewhere}} in the body – most commonly the lung, breast and skin. Cancers of brain tissue can also occur, and originate from any tissue {{in and around the}} brain. Meningioma, cancer of the meninges around the brain, is more common than cancers of brain tissue. Cancers within the brain may cause symptoms related to their size or position, with symptoms including headache and nausea, or the gradual development of focal symptoms such as gradual difficulty seeing, swallowing, talking, or as a change of mood. Cancers are in general investigated through the use of CT scans and MRI scans. A variety of other tests including blood tests and lumbar puncture may be used to investigate for the cause of the cancer <b>and</b> <b>evaluate</b> <b>the</b> type and stage of the cancer. The corticosteroid dexamethasone is often given to decrease the swelling of brain tissue around a tumour. Surgery may be considered, however given the complex nature of many tumours or based on tumour stage or type, radiotherapy or chemotherapy may be considered more suitable.|$|E

25|$|The {{intended}} {{engine for}} the Type 148 was the Bristol Perseus, but the aircraft {{made its first}} flight on 15 October 1937 with a Mercury IX. It was re-engined with a Perseus XII after a landing accident during comparative trials with the Westland Lysander. Both aircraft met the specification, including the demanding low-speed requirements but the visibility offered by the Lysander's high wing and the security of its fixed undercarriage made it the competition winner. The second prototype, labelled the Type 148B flew in May 1938, powered by a Bristol Taurus II engine and the two machines were used to compare <b>and</b> <b>evaluate</b> <b>the</b> two engine types.|$|E
25|$|In 1885 the North-West Rebellion {{was begun}} by Louis Riel, which pitted the Métis {{people of the}} District of Saskatchewan against the {{government}} of Canada. Wheeler joined the Canadian militia as a lieutenant with the Dominion Land Surveyors Intelligence Corps under Captain J. S. Dennis and, {{with a group of}} other land surveyors, marched to help quell the rebellion. At the Battle of Batoche, one surveyor was killed and three others wounded. Wheeler was grazed in the shoulder by a sniper's bullet, but a few days later learned that his family in Ontario had been informed that he had been killed in action. After returning to Ottawa, Wheeler met Clara Macoun, daughter of famous Canadian botanist John Macoun who had made numerous trips to the northwest to survey the railway <b>and</b> <b>evaluate</b> <b>the</b> land for farming.

25|$|In 2000 the Local Administration Law No. 4 was passed, {{providing}} an impetus to decentralization. The first local corporation {{was created in}} the Sana'a region in February 2000, followed by Aden in the same year. Five more local corporations were established in 2001 in Taiz, Hodeida, Ibb, Wadi Hadramaut and Mukalla. Two more (Hajjah and Al-Bayda') were established in 2005, four (Sadah, Abyan, Lahj and Dhamar) in 2006, and 2 further (Amran and Ad Dali') in 2008. As of 2009 more than 95% of urban areas were served by 15 local corporations. In 2003, the newly created Ministry of Water and Environment introduced a Performance Indicators Information System (PIIS) to monitor <b>and</b> <b>evaluate</b> <b>the</b> performance of the urban water and sanitation service providers at the local and national levels. A regulation study was completed in 2006. On its basis a bill was prepared to establish an independent regulatory agency, but it has not been adopted so far.|$|E
25|$|A 2015 Cochrane review {{found that}} people who lay on high {{specification}} or high density foam mattresses were 60% less likely to develop new pressure ulcers compared to regular foam mattresses. Sheepskin overlays on top of mattresses were also found to prevent new pressure ulcer formation. There is unclear research on the effectiveness of alternating pressure mattresses. Pressure-redistributive mattresses are used to reduce high values of pressure on prominent or bony areas of the body. There are several important terms used to describe how these support surfaces work. These terms were standardized through the Support Surface Standards Initiative of the NPUAP. Many support surfaces redistribute pressure by immersing and/or enveloping the body into the surface. Some support surfaces, including antidecubitus mattresses and cushions, contain multiple air chambers that are alternately pumped. Methods to standardize the products <b>and</b> <b>evaluate</b> <b>the</b> efficacy of these products have only been developed in recent years through the work of the S3I within NPUAP. For individuals with paralysis, pressure shifting on a regular basis and using a wheelchair cushion featuring pressure relief components can help prevent pressure wounds.|$|E

500|$|The {{title track}} was a {{time-consuming}} project; Lindstrøm {{called it a}} [...] "nightmare to finish." [...] The song comprised over 70 layers of sound and spanned almost 30 minutes. Around half the sound consisted of live performances, which Lindstrøm found difficult to merge with the electronic portions. After changing the music, he would usually listen to the entire song <b>and</b> <b>evaluate</b> <b>the</b> change. The repeated listens took a toll: [...] "I needed to listen to 30 minutes of music every time I did something," [...] said Lindstrom [...] "So I'll never gonna [...] do it again."
