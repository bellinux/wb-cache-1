50|$|Quantum {{reflection}} {{makes the}} idea of solid-state atomic mirrors and atomic-beam imaging systems (<b>atomic</b> <b>nanoscope)</b> possible. The use of quantum reflection {{in the production of}} atomic traps has also been suggested. Up to year 2007, no commercial application of quantum reflection was reported.|$|E
50|$|Ridged mirrors {{can also}} reflect visible light; however, for light waves, the {{performance}} is not {{better than that}} of a flat surface. An ellipsoidal ridged mirror is proposed as the focusing element for an atomic optical system with submicrometre resolution (<b>atomic</b> <b>nanoscope).</b>|$|E
5000|$|The atomic de Broglie {{microscope}} (also <b>atomic</b> <b>nanoscope,</b> {{neutral beam}} microscope, or scanning helium microscope when helium {{is used as}} the probing atom) is an imaging system {{which is expected to}} provide resolution at the nanometer scale. Sometimes people call it the nano-scope.|$|E
30|$|The FT-IR (Fourier {{transform}} infrared spectroscopy) {{spectrum of}} the anion exchangers Amberlite IRA 458 and Amberlite IRA 402 {{before and after the}} sorption of Cr(VI) and As(V) ions was recorded over the interval 400 – 4, 000  cm− 1 by means of a Perkin-Elmer 1725 X. The samples were tabulated with KBr. Surface morphology of the anion exchangers was studied by means of the <b>atomic</b> force microscope <b>NanoScope</b> V (Veeco).|$|R
30|$|MFM {{measurements}} performed using {{scanning probe}} <b>atomic</b> force microscope <b>NanoScope</b> IIIa Dimension 3000 ™. Two-pass technique {{was used to}} eliminate relief influence on MFM data. The MFM tip lift height was 80  nm at second pass. Hard magnetic probes with coercivity of approximately 300  Oe (the NANOSENSORS™ PPP-MFMR probe) were used. MFM tips were magnetized before the measurement along the tip axis in the magnetic field of the permanent magnet. With the aim of better visualization of the samples features revealing the magnetic properties, surfaces were scanned with different polarities of the MFM probe.|$|R
30|$|Surface {{structure}} and roughness {{were analyzed by}} <b>atomic</b> force microscopy (<b>Nanoscope</b> IIIa (Veeco, Santa Barbara, CA, USA) at the Material Science Group, IUAC) in the tapping mode with an antimony-doped silicon tip. The crystal structure is studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD) carried out using a PW 3710 diffractometer (Phillips, Eindhoven, Netherlands; at the Crystal Growth Laboratory, Department of Physics, Jamia Millia Islamia, New Delhi) with nickel-filtered Cu Kα (λ = 1.5418 Å); the sample was scanned over 10 ° to 80 ° {{at the rate of}} 2 °/min. The composition of the as-deposited and irradiated samples is measured by Rutherford back scattering spectroscopy (RBS) using a He+ beam of 2 -MeV energy at the Inter University Accelerator Centre [25].|$|R
50|$|The use of {{electrons}} and X-rays {{in place of}} light allows much higher resolution - the wavelength of the radiation is shorter so the diffraction limit is lower. To make theshort-wavelength probe non-destructive, the atomic beam imaging system (<b>atomic</b> <b>nanoscope)</b> has been proposed and widely discussed in the literature, {{but it is not}} yet competitive with conventional imaging systems.|$|E
5000|$|In quantum mechanics, the {{interaction}} mentioned is called [...] "measurement" [...] because its {{result can be}} interpreted in terms of classical mechanics. Frequent measurement prohibits the transition. It can be a transition of a particle from one half-space to another (which {{could be used for}} atomic mirror in an <b>atomic</b> <b>nanoscope)</b> as in the time of arrival problem, a transition of a photon in a waveguide from one mode to another, and it can be a transition of an atom from one quantum state to another. It can be a transition from the subspace without decoherent loss of a qubit to a state with a qubit lost in a quantum computer. In this sense, for the qubit correction, it is sufficient to determine whether the decoherence has already occurred or not. All these can be considered as applications of the Zeno effect. By its nature, the effect appears only in systems with distinguishable quantum states, and hence is inapplicable to classical phenomena and macroscopic bodies.|$|E
40|$|Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) allows {{to probe}} matter at atomic scale by {{measuring}} the perturbation of a nanomechanical oscillator induced by near-field interaction forces. The quest to improve sensitivity and resolution of AFM has forced {{the introduction of a}} new class of resonators with dimensions well below the micrometer scale. In this context, nanotube resonators are the ultimate mechanical oscillators because of their one dimensional nature, small mass and almost perfect crystallinity, coupled to the possibility of functionalisation, these properties make them the perfect candidates as ultra sensitive, on-demand force sensors. However their tiny dimensions make the measurement of the mechanical properties a very challenging task in particular when working in cavity free geometry at ambient temperature. By using a highly focused electron beam, we show that the mechanical response of nanotubes can be quantitatively measured while approaching to a surface sample. By coupling electron beam detection of individual nanotubes with a custom AFM we can image the surface topography of a sample by measuring in real time the mechanical properties of the nanoresonators. The combination of very small size and mass together with the high resolution of the electron beam detection method offers unprecedented opportunities {{for the development of a}} new class of <b>Atomic</b> Force <b>Nanoscope</b> (AFN) ...|$|R
30|$|High-resolution {{transmission}} {{electron microscopy}} (HRTEM) (FEI Tecnai F 30, Frequency Electronics Inc., Mitchel Field, NY, USA) {{was employed to examine}} the morphology of the samples and the size and distribution of the magnetite nanoparticles. X-ray diffraction technique (X-ray diffractometer Philips X'Pert PRO, PANalytical B.V., Almelo, The Netherlands, Kα 1 [*]=[*] 1.54056  Å) was used to investigate the structure of the samples and to estimate the average size of magnetite nanoparticles. In order to study the thickness of obtained graphene oxide flakes and nanocomposite, <b>atomic</b> force microscopy (<b>Nanoscope</b> V Multimode 8, Bruker AXS, Mannheim, Germany) was employed. IR absorption spectra were collected on the Nicolet 6700 FTIR spectrometer (Thermo Nicolet Corp., Madison, WI, USA). In order to investigate the thermal behavior of the samples, thermogravimetric analysis was performed on the SDT Q 600 simultaneous TGA/DSC (TA Instruments Inc., Milford, MA, USA) under an air flow of 100  mL/min at heating rate of 5 °C/min. Raman spectra were acquired on the inVia Raman Microscope (Renishaw PLC, New Mills Wotton-under-Edge, Gloucestershire, UK) at an excitation wavelength of 785  nm.|$|R
40|$|It is {{believed}} {{that this is the}} first time that laser molecular beam epitaxy, i. e. pulsed laser deposition (PLD), deposited epitaxial indium zinc oxide (epi-IZO) thin films on float glass, n 100 m Si, GaAs and InP wafers have been applied to semiconductor – insulator – semiconductor type heterojunction solar cell structures as wide band gap transparent conducting oxides front electrode collector layers. In the present work, the effects of substrate temperatures, substrates and heavy indium oxide incorporation on epi-IZO thin film growth and novel surface morphological properties were analysed. Hitachi SEM and <b>nanoscope</b> <b>atomic</b> force microscopy revealed that the films were high quality nanostructures, which vary with different substrate temperatures and type of substrate. The morphological study is significant as reported so far. Increasing the substrate temperature causes the films to form a fine nanostructure. Better surface quality was observed on InP than Si and GaAs. Therefore, by the use of PLD with different substrate temperatures and substrates as control tools, a novel nano-architecture was developed for IZO thin films on glass, Si, GaAs and InP semiconductor single crystal wafers. Heavy indium oxide incorporation improves the surface quality of the thin films. The present work will be used, and these data may be helpful, as a scientific or technical basis in semiconductor processing and technology, such as nano-electronics (invisible security circuits) and nanomachining technology...|$|R
30|$|The {{structural}} {{properties of}} rGO and PtCo/rGO were studied by powder X-ray diffraction using Rigaku miniflex- 300 bench top X-ray diffractometer having Cu Kα (λ[*]=[*] 1.541 Å) X-ray source. The infrared spectra of synthesized support and catalyst were measured in ATR mode using Agilant Cary 360 Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer. Raman measurements {{were conducted on}} Ranishaw win-via reflex spectrometer within the spectral range of 500 – 3000 /cm. <b>Atomic</b> Force Microscope <b>nanoscope</b> (Veeco V) was used to identify the formation of single or few layers of graphene oxide by capturing topographical images in tapping mode. The morphology of rGO, commercial Pt/C and PtRu/C and PtCo/rGO anode catalysts and the dispersion nano-particles onto reduced graphene oxide nanosheets was studied using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Tecnai G 2 F 30 S-Twin (FEI; Super twin lens with Cs[*]=[*] 1.2  mm) instrument operated at accelerating voltage of 300  kV, having a point resolution of 0.2  nm and lattice resolution of 0.14  nm. The morphology of rGO was also imaged using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), FEI, and Quanta FEG 450. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed using monochromatic AlKα X-ray source and EA 125 HR electron analyzer from Omicron GmBH. Core levels were acquired using 20  eV pass energy. Overall experimental resolution is about 0.4  eV and binding energy (BE) calibration of spectrometer is done using Fermi edge position of a clean polycrystalline silver foil. Shirley background subtraction was performed on each core level. Uncertainty in determining the BE position and full width at half maximum (FWHM) {{is estimated to be}} ±[*] 0.05  eV. Uncertainty in determining relative percentage is estimated to be ±[*] 5 % of the base value.|$|R
