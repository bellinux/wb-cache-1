30|$|The logging cost is a {{function}} of harvested volume, productivity of felling, and on-site transport. Logging costs are composed of felling and haulage (transportation) costs and a fixed cost. The logging cost model by Kuitto et al. (1994) for timber production from commercial thinning and final felling is based on the time consumption equations for mechanized cutting and forest haulage specification. More detailed description of Kuitto’s logging model was presented in Cao et al. (2006). The productivity of mechanised cutting for energy wood from early thinnings (stem wood) is based on a time consumption model for a thinning harvester equipped with an <b>accumulating</b> <b>felling</b> <b>head</b> (Laitila et al. 2004). Laitila (2008) reported that such a two-machine system (harvester-forwarder) is currently the most cost competitive logging system for energy wood from early thinnings in Finnish conditions. The logging cost parameters were assumed as follows: terrain class one, average travel distance 200  m, felling cost 75.67 €∙h− 1, transportation cost 53.35 €∙h− 1, and fixed cost 100.00 €∙ha− 1 (Cao et al. 2010).|$|E

The productivity of cutting and bundling whole trees using the first prototype of a bundle-harvester comprised of a harwarder {{as the base}} machine, an <b>accumulating</b> <b>felling</b> <b>head,</b> and a compacting device was studied in three young stands {{in order to facilitate}} the further development of the concept. In addition, the removal and its composition were studied as a means of laying the foundations for developing methods for work rating and measurement on delivery. Bundling enables in-depth integration of pulpwood and energy wood procure-ment. Both energy wood (crown biomass) and pulpwood can be incorporated into the same bundles, and the subsequent separation of these fractions takes place at the debarking phase at the pulpmill. Bundle-harvesting productivities were relatively low (2. 8 – 3. 7 m 3 /E 0 -h) when compared to current harvesting technology. Improving working techniques, machine structure, and components showed great potential for increasing the efficiency of the concept. The bundles were dimensionally uniform. Their solid volume varied between 0. 350 m 3 and 0. 513 m 3, depending on the bundle assortment and stand properties. Integrating energy wood harvesting with pulpwood harvesting increased removal even by 59 per cent...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{feasibility}} of adapted tree section method using a conceptual bundle harvester for the integrated production of pulpwood and energy wood in first commercial thinning of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.). The harvester would operate on the site, {{and it would be}} comprised of a base machine, an <b>accumulating</b> <b>felling</b> <b>head,</b> and a compacting device. Separation of pulpwood and energy wood fractions would take place at a pulp mill. In this experiment, the trees were topped and the top sections were left at the site. The concept was evaluated from an ecological and eco-nomic point of view. Nutrient losses were significantly lower compared to whole-tree harvesting. The energy frac-tion increased by 150 % compared to the cut-to-length method, in which stem bark represents the energy frac-tion. In bundle transportation, the load-bearing capacity of standard trucks can be highly utilized. For short distance hauling by conventional forwarders, an expansion of the load space is required in order to improve the utilization of the load-bearing capacity. Due to insufficient compaction capability when deal-ing with large trees, the bundling concept seems to be more appealing in harvesting energy wood from dense stands characterized by small stem size. In energy wood procurement, the bundling concept has several indirect advantages compared to the conventional forest chip pro-duction. Standard vehicles, with minor modifications, can be used for transportation. Machines involved in the op-eration can work independently, increasing the reliability of the system. Bundling with accurate real-time informa-tion about the daily production and inventories creates favourable conditions for efficient process control.

40|$|Forage {{harvesters}} used in Short Rotation Willow Coppice (SRWC) plantations in Sweden {{suffer from}} {{an inability to}} efficiently harvest stems thicker than 6 – 7 cm at stump height. An alternative, when harvesting in such plantations, might be to use forest machines fitted with <b>accumulating</b> <b>felling</b> <b>heads.</b> This study aimed to measure the time consumption and to compare the costs of two forest machine systems in a normal (N) and an overgrown (O) SRWC, where the respective biomass densities were 36 and 56 Oven-Dry tones (OD t) per ha. The first machine system included a harvester and a forwarder and the second consisted of a harwarder (one-machine system). When harvesting and forwarding the biomass for 250 m, the productivity of the two and one-machine system was on average 2. 3 (sd = 0. 6) and 0. 9 (sd = 0. 2) OD t/Productive Work hour, respectively. Biomass density or stem sizes had a marginal effect on the time consumption per hectare for the two-machine system, but were significant for the one-machine system. The productivity for the two-machine and one-machine system in the O area, compared to the N area, was 40 %and 36 %higher, respectively. The net income was positive when using the harvester–forwarder system but it was negative for the harwarder. Increases in biomass density or stem sizes increased the profitability of themachine systems studied. Thus, if dealing with more overgrown plantations than those studied, forest machines, and especially a harvester-forwarder system, may offer an efficient and economical alternative to conventional forage harvesters...|$|R

In field studies, boom-corridor thinning using a conventional AFH gave a significant, 16 %, increase in productivity compared to a standard thinning from below treatment (II). The potential utility of a prototype <b>felling</b> <b>head</b> designed for continuous felling in boom-corridors in the field was also studied (III). The results show that felling speeds of about 1. 3 m×s- 1 can be achieved if cranes that allow higher movement speeds are used. Further, the performance of a prototype compression processing device was investigated in field studies, and the results show that the density of fresh Scots pine bunches could be increased by up to 160 %, while reducing their ash contents (and hence nutrient losses) by 50 % (IV). It was also found that load compression techniques can raise payloads (IV). In conclusion, if new techniques especially designed for boom-corridor thinning are developed and used in appropriate harvesting systems the productivity, cost-efficiency and profitability of the operation can be greatly increased...|$|R
