5|$|In February 1991, Icke {{visited a}} pre-Inca Sillustani burial ground near Puno, Peru, where he felt {{drawn to a}} {{particular}} circle of waist-high stones. As {{he stood in the}} circle, he had two thoughts: that people would be talking <b>about</b> <b>this</b> <b>in</b> 100 years, {{and that it would be}} over when it rained. His body shook as though plugged into an electrical socket, he wrote, and new ideas poured into him. Then it started raining and the experience ended. He described it as the kundalini (a term from Indian yoga) activating his chakras, or energy centres, triggering a higher level of consciousness.|$|E
5|$|Marx had {{a special}} concern with how people relate to their own labour power. He wrote {{extensively}} <b>about</b> <b>this</b> <b>in</b> terms {{of the problem of}} alienation. As with the dialectic, Marx began with a Hegelian notion of alienation but developed a more materialist conception. Capitalism mediates social relationships of production (such as among workers or between workers and capitalists) through commodities, including labour, that are bought and sold on the market. For Marx, the possibility that one may give up ownership of one's own labour—one's capacity to transform the world—is tantamount to being alienated from one's own nature and it is a spiritual loss. Marx described this loss as commodity fetishism, in which the things that people produce, commodities, appear to have a life and movement of their own to which humans and their behaviour merely adapt.|$|E

In 1788, Gray encountered Captain John Meares of England. Meares subsequently published reports and maps of the Pacific Northwest that included a voyage by Robert Gray through a large, imaginary inland sea between the Strait of Juan de Fuca and Dixon Entrance. When George Vancouver asked Gray <b>about</b> <b>this</b> <b>in</b> 1792, Gray said he never made such a voyage.|$|E
25|$|But Hecataeus did not record {{events that}} had {{occurred}} in living memory, unlike Herodotus, nor did he include the oral traditions of Greek history within the larger framework of oriental history. There is no proof that Herodotus derived the ambitious scope of his own work, with its grand theme of civilizations in conflict, from any predecessor, despite much scholarly speculation <b>about</b> <b>this</b> <b>in</b> modern times. Herodotus claims to be better informed than his predecessors by relying on empirical observation to correct their excessive schematism. For example, he argues for continental asymmetry {{as opposed to the}} older theory of a perfectly circular earth with Europe and Asia/Africa equal in size (Histories4.36 and 4.42). However, he retains idealizing tendencies, as in his symmetrical notions of the Danube and Nile.|$|E
25|$|When {{the vendor}} {{is aware of}} the {{customer}} request it will determine the customer needs. By checking what the customer current configuration is and what the customer desires. This process can also take place automatically by checking the customer configuration in the configuration management system. More information on this system is provided in the next chapter. When it is clear what product the customer needs and the possible modifications to this product it is necessary to determine if the customer current configuration suits the new product. The current configuration is compared to the constraints of the new product. This can also be done automatically by the configuration management system. When the configuration of the customer appears to be insufficient the customer is informed about this. For example the vendor can make clear to the customer that it will need an external product for this new product to run properly. Besides this the Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system of the vendor is updated. There is more information <b>about</b> <b>this</b> <b>in</b> the chapter about CRM.|$|E

25|$|Ian meets Karen Taylor (Lorraine Stanley) who {{has just}} moved into the Square with her family. Ian reluctantly employs Karen, who quits after Ian refuses to let her take burgers away for her children. Ian and Jane are later devastated when they learn that Steven has a brain tumour, {{but he has been}} {{secretly}} lying <b>about</b> <b>this</b> <b>in</b> a desperate attempt to stay with Lauren. Jane has been developing a Walford in Bloom event and {{on the day of the}} event, an unnoticed gas leak throws the whole Square into danger. Unbeknownst to Ian, Jane has discovered Steven's lie and that Max has not really forgiven them and is secretly planning revenge. In a bid to get rid of Jane, Max forces Steven to kill her. As a result, Steven sets fire to the restaurant, trapping Jane inside. Steven later has a change of heart and tries to save Jane, but is violently shoved into a table by Max, who leaves Jane to die. However, while Jane is rescued, Steven dies of a liver bleed. Ian, Kathy and Lauren are shocked when they learn that Steven did not really have a brain tumour. A disgusted Lauren declares that his funeral will not be taking place and only Abi attends. Ian is thrilled when Jane awakens from her coma. Max forces Jane to leave Walford with Ian. But, James Wilmott-Brown (William Boyde), who is working with Max and who also raped Kathy years ago, orders Max to ensure that Ian remains in Walford. Therefore, Max blackmails Jane into leaving Walford alone, threatening harm to Bobby if she does not. A heart-broken Jane leaves Walford without Ian, leaving him shattered. Ian allows Lauren and Louie to move back in with him. Ian tells Abi about making Beales into a franchise to pass onto Louie. Abi announces to Ian that he will have another grandchild as she is pregnant with Steven's baby, news that Ian does not take well. Ian informs Max of Abi's pregnancy.|$|E

A poll run by Daytime Confidential revealed that most audiences believe Summer is the daughter of Jack, with 79% of votes.|$|E
500|$|During Kwaśniewski's {{visit to}} Russia in September 2004, Russian {{officials}} {{announced that they}} were willing to transfer all the information on the Katyn massacre to the Polish authorities as soon as it became declassified. In March 2005 the Prosecutor-General’s Office of the Russian Federation concluded a decade-long investigation of the massacre. Chief Military Prosecutor Alexander Savenkov announced that the investigation was able to confirm the deaths of 1,803 out of 14,542 Polish citizens who had been sentenced to death while in three Soviet camps. He did not address the fate of about 7,000 victims who had not been in POW camps, but in prisons. Savenkov declared that the massacre was not a genocide, that Soviet officials who had been found guilty of the crime were dead and that, consequently, [...] "there is absolutely no basis to talk <b>about</b> <b>this</b> <b>in</b> judicial terms". 116 out of 183 volumes of files gathered during the Russian investigation were declared to contain state secrets and were classified.|$|E

[...] The first introduction of the speech as well as the series of lectures was given by Indira Nair, the Vice Provost for Education at Carnegie Mellon.

[...] He agreed that Roman numerals were ill-advised for the eagle, and on June 24, new models were sent to the Mint by Hering. [...] These models, along with a bronze casting which was produced privately, were used by Barber to prepare a die, and experimental pieces were struck on July 19. [...] These [...] "high relief" [...] pieces required multiple strikes of the press to fully bring up the design. [...] Saint-Gaudens wrote to the Mint in mid-July, [...] "I am waiting to know <b>about</b> <b>this</b> <b>in</b> order to proceed with the other reliefs", and he was sent one of the new pieces, along with a Liberty Head eagle for comparison, for which he paid by check.|$|E
500|$|In {{the period}} {{immediately}} after his return, Shackleton {{engaged in a}} strenuous schedule of public appearances, lectures and social engagements. He then sought {{to cash in on}} his celebrity by making a fortune in the business world. Among the ventures which he hoped to promote were a tobacco company, a scheme for selling to collectors postage stamps overprinted [...] "King Edward VII Land" [...] (based on Shackleton's appointment as Antarctic postmaster by the New Zealand authorities), {{and the development of a}} Hungarian mining concession he had acquired near the city of Nagybanya, now part of Romania. None of these enterprises prospered, and his main source of income was his earnings from lecture tours. He still harboured thoughts of returning south, even though in September 1910, having recently moved with his family to Sheringham in Norfolk, he wrote to Emily: [...] "I am never again going South and I have thought it all out and my place is at home now". He had been in discussions with Douglas Mawson about a scientific expedition to the Antarctic coast between Cape Adare and Gaussberg, and had written to the RGS <b>about</b> <b>this</b> <b>in</b> February 1910.|$|E
500|$|The Christian {{community}} of Mangalore accused the police of doing {{nothing to prevent}} attacks by Hindu radicals. Mangalore Police Superintendent N. Satheesh Kumar himself admitted that the police did have information that pro-Hindu organisations were planning to attack Christian places of worship in the district, but failed {{to do anything about}} it. The Christian community accused the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government under B. S. Yeddyurappa of involvement in the attacks and backing the anti-Christian campaigns. In response to the report that the police had information, Fr. Henry Sequeira, chancellor of the Mangalore Diocese said, [...] "If the police knew <b>about</b> <b>this</b> <b>in</b> advance and still could not prevent the attacks, then we have no hope." [...] However, Superintendent Kumar had made security arrangements near the New Life Prayer Centre in Kankanady and had successfully barred the miscreants from entering and vandalising the centre at that particular location, leading to a violent conflict with the police. The police were also criticised by Christians for using excessive force in suppressing the protests and aggressively subduing Christian protesters whilst failing to punish the offending Hindu nationalist perpetrators; photographs and video footage has emerged of the beating of some of the protestors with canes. Caning by the police was also reported at Panemangalore and Farangipet.|$|E
