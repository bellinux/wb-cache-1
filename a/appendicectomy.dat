40|$|BACKGROUND Traditional {{approach}} of {{high rate of}} negative <b>appendicectomies</b> is being questioned in today’s era of cost-effective healthcare. The goal of surgical treatment is removal of an inflamed appendix before it goes in for complications with minimal number of negative <b>appendicectomies.</b> Because of the high morbidity of complicated appendicitis, prompt diagnosis and treatment is imperative. The aim {{of the study is}} to study the relation between Alvarado score and C-reactive protein in predicting severity of acute appendicitis. MATERIALS AND METHODS Study was conducted in Government Medical College, Calicut. All patients with clinical diagnosis of acute appendicitis presenting to surgery casualty, qualifying the inclusion criteria of the study were evaluated with routine investigations. Patients were informed regarding the study and consent obtained. RESULTS CRP cannot replace clinical diagnosis, but is an useful adjunct in predicting the severity of <b>appendicectomies.</b> It has been found that negative <b>appendicectomies</b> belonged to group with 7. CONCLUSION Both Alvarado score and CRP are reliable indicators in predicting the severity of appendicitis. Comparing the two CRP is a better predictor of severity of acute appendicitis...|$|R

40|$|Background: Despite the {{reported}} advantages of laparoscopic appendectomy (LA), ongoing debate exists {{about a possible}} increase in postoperative infectious complication rates especially intraabdominal infections and wound infection, unless wound protection is utilized. Methods: All consecutive <b>appendicectomies</b> (open and laparoscopic) performed over 4 months were included in this prospective study. Demographic details, operative time, time to conversion, infective postoperative complications, and delay in discharge were recorded. The patients were divided into 2 groups, laparoscopic (LA) and open appendectomy (OA). Results: A total of 134 <b>appendicectomies</b> were performed, 80 in the LA group and 54 in the OA group...|$|R

50|$|When the {{appendix}} is retrocaecal and adherent or otherwise inaccessible, <b>appendicectomy</b> {{is done in}} a retrograde fashion. Firstly, the base is divided between artery forceps.

30|$|PMP is the {{clinical}} {{term for the}} debilitating syndrome of grossly apparent gelatinous ascites associated with peritoneal deposits of mucinous tumours. Most of this syndrome is mainly attributed to spread from the appendix and rarely from mucinous ovarian neoplasms. Mucocele of the appendix is a rare condition found in 0.2 - 0.3 % of <b>appendicectomies</b> and describes an abnormal mucous deposition in the lumen of the appendix [2]. PMP involving only the retroperitoneum was first described by Bonann in 1948 [3]. This was later termed as ‘pseudomyxoma extraperitonei’ by Moran [4] and later as ‘pseudomyxoma retroperitonei’ by Shelton et al. [5].|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess whether}} laparoscopic surgery lowers the {{threshold}} for surgical intervention, we examined whether {{the introduction of}} the laparoscopic technique at our institution in 1997 has resulted in an increase in antireflux surgery in children at our clinic. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The number of annual fundoplications between 1997 and 2008 at a single institution was assessed in children younger than 18 years. The number of fundoplications was compared with the number of pyloromyotomies and <b>appendicectomies</b> per year in the same period of time to prove or exclude a general increase in the referral of children. RESULTS: Since 1997, the proportion of laparoscopic fundoplications increased from 60 % in 1997 to 100 % in 2008. During this period, 109 laparoscopic fundoplications were performed: 31 in the period from 1997 to 2002 and 78 from 2003 to 2008. Regression analysis shows {{a significant increase in the}} number of performed fundoplications (slope: 1. 03 +/- 0. 28, P = 0. 0043), whereas both the number of pyloromyotomies and <b>appendicectomies</b> remained stable (slopes: - 0. 14 +/- 0. 40, P = 0. 73, and - 0. 75 +/- 0. 47, P = 0. 14, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Since the introduction of minimally invasive surgery at our tertiary referral center in 1997, the number of patients referred for an antireflux operation has increased. This cannot be explained by an increase of referrals from outside the region or a change in the indication for surgery. We conclude that laparoscopy lowers the threshold for the surgical treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease in children...|$|R
50|$|Many {{surgeons}} {{have attempted}} to reduce incisional morbidity and improve cosmetic outcomes in laparoscopic <b>appendicectomy</b> by using fewer and smaller ports. Kollmar et al. described moving laparoscopic incisions to hide them in the natural camouflages like the suprapubic hairline to improve cosmesis. Additionally, reports in the literature indicate that minilaparoscopic appendectomy using 2- or 3-mm or even smaller instruments along with one 12-mm port minimizes pain and improves cosmesis. More recently, studies by Ates et al. and Roberts et al. have described variants of an intracorporeal sling-based single-port laparoscopic appendectomy with good clinical results.|$|E

50|$|Stay sutures are {{temporary}} {{surgical sutures}} which are placed during operation to hold or manipulate the operating area. In cases of ocular surgery, tracheostomy, suprapubic cystolithotomy, <b>appendicectomy,</b> ureterolithotomy, or choledocholithotomy stay sutures can be given. They {{can be used}} to temporarily align a structure to stabilize it. This can allow a surgeon to work more safely around the area, without the possibility of a clamp slipping and falling out of place. Stay sutures can also limit bleeding in an area where key vessels may be disturbed. Usually they are removed {{at the end of the}} surgery prior to the closure of the incision, although they may be left in place if the surgeon feels they pose no risk to the patient. Stay sutures can sometimes be used in the management of surgical emergencies.|$|E
40|$|Sonography is an {{important}} clinical tool in diagnosing appendicitis in children as it can obviate both exposure to potentially harmful ionising radiation from computed tomography scans {{and the need for}} unnecessary <b>appendicectomies.</b> This review examines the diagnostic accuracy of ultrasound in the identification of acute appendicitis, with a particular focus on the the utility of secondary sonographic signs as an adjunct or corollary to traditionally examined criteria. These secondary signs can be important in cases where the appendix cannot be identified with ultrasound and a more meaningful finding may be made by incorporating {{the presence or absence of}} secondary sonographic signs. There is evidence that integrating these secondary signs into the final ultrasound diagnosis can improve the utility of ultrasound in cases where appendicitis is expected, though there remains some conjecture about whether they play a more important role in negative or positive prediction in the absence of an identifiable appendix...|$|R
30|$|Surgical {{conditions}} {{account for}} a significant burden of the district hospital work load in low income countries. This was quantified to be 19.4 and 19.8  % of all admissions for these two hospitals in two different countries in east and west Africa. The two hospitals in this study showed different types of procedures and volume based on the skills and facilities available. In Thyolo, few general surgical procedures were performed, but Thyolo did perform {{a large number of}} obstetric procedures which were not performed in Bo. This can largely be explained by local access to a larger centre specialising in areas of surgical practice. Conversely, in Bo, few maternal procedures were performed because of a local MSF hospital which offered these procedures free of charge. However Bo did have the facilities and skills to perform a large number of general surgical procedures, such as <b>appendicectomies</b> and non-gynaecological laparotomies which were not available in the same way in Thyolo.|$|R
40|$|Background: The study {{describes}} {{variations in}} use of surgical procedures by community {{income in the}} Netherlands. From the literature {{it is known that}} surgical rates have a socioeconomic gradient. Both positive and negative associations of socioeconomic factors of patients (for example, income, education) with surgical rates have been reported. The question raised here is: how do (possible) socioeconomic variations in surgery in the Netherlands compare with variations observed elsewhere? - Data and Methods: The data comprised Dutch hospital discharges and population estimates for 1999. Socioeconomic status was indicated by a patient’s income and based on the average family income of the postcode area of residence. Poisson regression was used to compute relative incidence (odds ratios) for 10 common surgical procedures. The model included age, gender, degree of urbanisation, and province of residence. - Results: The association between surgical rates and community level income is rather weak. For half of the surgical rates the authors observed higher utilisation rates in communities with low income levels, but the differences are small. The range of odds ratios in the lowest income quintile group (compared with the group with the highest income) observed is: 0. 87 to 1. 18. Men from a low income community received more <b>appendicectomies</b> (1. 18), cholecystectomies (1. 12), knee replacements (1. 06), and prostatectomies (1. 14) and less tonsillectomies (0. 90). Women from a low income community received more <b>appendicectomies</b> (1. 12), caesarean sections (1. 18), hip and knee replacements (1. 05, 1. 17), and hysterectomies (1. 14). Whereas they received less coronary artery bypass grafts (0. 92), cholecystectomies (0. 87), and tonsillectomies (0. 92). - Conclusions: Compared with findings reported in the international literature, this study indicates that variations in use of surgical procedures by community income in the Netherlands are comparatively small. Because of lack of data the authors could not study the influence of variations in need for surgical care by community income, but as the incidence of conditions requiring surgical interventions generally is higher in lower income groups, it is suspected some degree of underutilisation exists in these groups...|$|R
