5|$|Fortuny also {{states that}} dress codes <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> of a patriarchal {{organization}} because men are only forbidden from growing their hair long or wearing shorts in public. Women, at times, {{can be more}} autonomous {{than those in the}} general population in Mexico. Fortuny says that the growing trend of educated women having husbands in supporting roles is also seen within the Church both in the Guadalajara (Mexico), and Houston (Texas) congregations. Many young female members said they want to undergo post-secondary education, and some told Fortuny they were degree students. Both young men and women are equally encouraged to enter post-compulsory education. Fathers who are members of La Luz del Mundo are more likely than their mothers to direct their daughters towards attending university.|$|E

25|$|Some {{beliefs about}} Marian devotions have been {{asserted}} by the saints and theologians, {{but have not}} been dogmatically approved by the Church. An example {{is the belief that}} Marian devotions <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> of predestination, supported by Saint Bernard of Clairvaux, Saint Bonaventure, and Saint Alphonsus Ligouri as well as R. Garrigou-Lagrange.|$|E

25|$|Wrestling {{masks are}} used most widely in Mexican and Japanese wrestling. A wrestler's mask is usually {{related to a}} wrestler's persona (for example, a wrestler known as 'The Panda' might wear a mask with a panda's facial markings). Often, wrestlers will put their masks on the line against other wrestlers' masks, titles or an opponent's hair. While in Mexico and Japan, masks <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> of tradition, they are looked down upon in the United States and Canada.|$|E
25|$|The three escallop shells upon a fess {{were taken}} from the armorial {{bearings}} of the La Trobe family and signify the La Trobe name. What is also important about the escallops is that they <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> of a pilgrim and the journey that an individual must undertake to achieve spiritual, {{or in the case of}} the university, intellectual enlightenment. It is the idea of the journey that is particularly significant within the university's arms, as evidenced by the escallop shell clasped by the eagle in the crest.|$|E
25|$|After a {{traumatic}} experience, {{a person may}} re-experience the trauma mentally and physically, hence trauma reminders, also called triggers, can be uncomfortable and even painful. It can damage people’s sense of safety, self, self-efficacy, {{as well as the}} ability to regulate emotions and navigate relationships. They may turn to psychoactive substances including alcohol to try to escape or dampen the feelings. These triggers cause flashbacks, which are dissociative experiences where the person feels as though the events is reoccurring. They can range from distracting to complete dissociation or loss of awareness of the current context. Re-experiencing symptoms <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> that the body and mind are actively struggling to cope with the traumatic experience.|$|E

25|$|This is a {{book that}} contradicts itself a hundred times; {{but that is not}} a {{criticism}} of it, because its author thinks contradictions <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> of intellectual ferment and vitality. This {{is a book}} that systematically distorts and selects historical evidence; but that is not a criticism, because its author thinks that all interpretations are biased, and she regards it as her duty to pick and choose her facts to favor her own brand of politics. This is a book full of vaporous, French-intellectual prose that makes Teilhard de Chardin sound like Ernest Hemingway by comparison; but that is not a criticism, because the author likes that sort of prose and has taken lessons in how to write it, and she thinks that plain, homely speech is part of a conspiracy to oppress the poor.|$|E
25|$|Polygynous marriages can be {{distinguished}} between sororal polygyny, in which the co-wives are sisters, and non-sororal, where the co-wives are not related. For men, the benefits of polygyny are that {{it allows them to}} have more children, may provide them with more productive workers (where workers are family), and allows them to establish politically useful ties with a greater number of kin groups. Senior wives can benefit as well when their work load is lightened by the addition of junior wives to the family. Wives', especially senior wives', status in the community can be increased by the addition of other wives, who add to the family's prosperity or <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> of conspicuous consumption (much like a large house, domestic help, or expensive vacations would be in a western country). For such reasons, senior wives sometimes work hard or contribute from their own resources to enable their husbands to accumulate the bride price for a second wife.|$|E
25|$|The {{interior}} of the room has other signs of wealth; the brass chandelier is large and elaborate by contemporary standards, {{and would have been}} very expensive. It would probably have had a mechanism with pulley and chains above, to lower it for managing the candles (possibly omitted from the painting for lack of room). The convex mirror at the back, in a wooden frame with scenes of The Passion painted behind glass, is shown larger than such mirrors could actually be made at this date – another discreet departure from realism by van Eyck. There is also no sign of a fireplace (including in the mirror), nor anywhere obvious to put one. Even the oranges casually placed to the left <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> of wealth; they were very expensive in Burgundy, and may {{have been one of the}} items dealt in by Arnolfini. Further signs of luxury are the elaborate bed-hangings and the carvings on the chair and bench against the back wall (to the right, partly hidden by the bed), also the small Oriental carpet on the floor by the bed; many owners of such expensive objects placed them on tables, as they still do in the Netherlands.|$|E
50|$|Next, Cardwell {{noted that}} bearish divergence: 1) only occurs in uptrends, and 2) mostly only {{leads to a}} brief {{correction}} instead of a reversal in trend. Therefore, bearish divergence <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> confirming <b>an</b> uptrend. Similarly, bullish divergence <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> confirming <b>a</b> downtrend.|$|R

60|$|And now, my friends, we {{may find}} in St. John's example a {{wholesome}} lesson for ourselves. We may learn from it that noisiness is not earnestness, that violence is not strength.

500|$|During these events, in Paris, Nicole Collard {{prepares to}} meet and {{interview}} a hacker named Vernon Blier in his apartment, who recently decoded the Voynich manuscript, but is afraid for his life {{because of what he}} found out from it. [...] Unfortunately, Vernon is murdered in his home by a woman impersonating Nico, named Petra, just before the former gets there. When the two confront each other inside the apartment, Petra fails to kill Nico, and flees, leaving a few clues behind. [...] Nico quickly tries to find what she needs to prove her innocence, but after the police arrive to investigate the murder, the detective in charge chooses to arrest her, based on the witness account of Vernon's landlady. Following her arrest and subsequent release two days later, Nico decides {{to find out more about}} what Vernon had found out, and returns to his apartment, finding his girlfriend, Beatrice, residing inside, still coping with the loss of Vernon. [...] Finding and managing to open a hidden safe, Nico finds diagrams and a DVD, with the latter she plays back at her own apartment before showing it to Andre Lobineau, an old friend of hers, finding it contained a message from Vernon about what he found, believing the bizarre storms happening across the world <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> of a global catastrophe in the making. [...] Finding out about an abandoned theatre on the Ile St Louis in Paris, connected to a mask the killer had with her when she fled Vernon's murder, Nico heads out to investigate it but gets captured by Petra and her boss, Susarro.|$|E
2500|$|Cumuliform clouds {{generally}} {{appear in}} isolated heaps or tufts. [...] They {{are the product}} of localized but generally free-convective lift where there are no inversion layers in the atmosphere to limit vertical growth. In general, small cumuliform clouds tend to indicate comparatively weak instability. [...] Larger cumuliform types <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> of moderate to strong atmospheric instability and convective activity. Depending on their vertical size, clouds of the cumulus genus type may be low-level or multi-level with moderate to towering vertical extent.|$|E
2500|$|E. P. Sanders' {{publications}} {{have since}} been taken up by Professor James Dunn who coined the phrase [...] "The New Perspective on Paul". N.T. Wright, the Anglican Bishop of Durham, notes a difference in emphasis between Galatians and Romans, the latter being much more positive about the continuing covenant between God and his ancient people than the former. Wright also contends that performing Christian works is not insignificant but rather proof of having attained the redemption of Jesus Christ by grace (free gift received by faith). He concludes that Paul distinguishes between performing Christian works which are signs of ethnic identity and others which <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> of obedience to Christ.|$|E
50|$|That {{truth is}} the {{correspondence}} of a representation with its object is, as Kant says, merely the nominal definition of it. Truth belongs exclusively to propositions. A proposition has a subject (or set of subjects) and a predicate. The subject <b>is</b> <b>a</b> sign; the predicate <b>is</b> <b>a</b> sign; and the proposition <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> that the predicate <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> of that of which the subject <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign.</b> If it <b>be</b> so, it is true. But what does this correspondence or reference of the sign, to its object, consist in? (Peirce 1906, CP 5.553).|$|R

2500|$|Limerence {{involves}} intrusive {{thinking about}} the limerent object. Other characteristics include acute longing for reciprocation, fear of rejection, and unsettling shyness in the limerent object's presence. In cases of unrequited limerence, transient relief may be found by vividly imagining reciprocation from the limerent object. Tennov suggests that feelings of limerence can be intensified through adversity, obstacles, or distance—'Intensification through Adversity'. A limerent person may have acute sensitivity to any act, thought, or condition that can be interpreted favorably. This may include a tendency to devise, fabricate, or invent [...] "reasonable" [...] explanations for why neutral actions <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> of hidden passion in the limerent object.|$|E
2500|$|Sanders' publications, such as Paul and Palestinian Judaism in 1977 and Paul, the Law, and the Jewish People in 1983, {{have since}} been taken up by Professor James Dunn who coined the phrase [...] "The New Perspective on Paul" [...] and N.T. Wright, Anglican Bishop of Durham. Wright, noting the {{apparent}} discrepancy between Romans and Galatians, the former being much more positive about the continuing covenantal relationship between God and his ancient people than the latter, contends that works are not insignificant and that Paul distinguishes between works which are signs of ethnic identity and those which <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> of obedience to Christ.|$|E
2500|$|Khan-Magomedov barely {{mentions}} {{the role of}} State (or Joseph Stalin personally) in those events, presenting the demise of avant-garde as a natural evolution within the professional community. He admits that the profession was manipulated by the [...] "class of 1929" [...] youth, but does not study the forces that shaped and directed their assaults. Not a word on Stalin's personal influence, not a word on rising terror. Khan-Magovedov discusses the 1929–1931 political assaults by VOPRA at length, but fails to mention that {{they were part of}} an all-out national campaign. As Khmelnitsky summarized it, [...] "Postconstructivism was born by terror. The very term is misleading. Traces of the Constructivist style in the Postconstructivism of the 1930s <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> of indecision, not tradition. They banned constructivism, but didn't explain what to do; the result is an architectural pathology. Comparison with European parallels is useless. There were no European parallels, even Nazi architecture does not come close".|$|E
