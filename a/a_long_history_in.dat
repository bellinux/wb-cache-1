5|$|Although Gandhi {{was not the}} {{originator}} of {{the principle}} of nonviolence, {{he was the first to}} apply it in the political field on a large scale. The concept of nonviolence (ahimsa) has <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>history</b> <b>in</b> Indian religious thought, with it being considered the highest dharma (ethical value virtue), a precept to be observed towards all living beings (sarvbhuta), at all times (sarvada), in all respects (sarvatha), in action, words and thought. Gandhi explains his philosophy and ideas about ahimsa as a political means in his autobiography The Story of My Experiments with Truth.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} forms with <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>history</b> <b>in</b> many languages, many {{variations}} have been developed, including forms with a quasi-musical poetic diction in Urdu. Ghazals have a classical affinity with Sufism, {{and a number}} of major Sufi religious works are written in ghazal form. The relatively steady meter {{and the use of the}} refrain produce an incantatory effect, which complements Sufi mystical themes well. Among the masters of the form is Rumi, a 13th-century Persian poet.|$|E

However, the name 'lily' has historically been applied {{to a wide variety of}} plants other than the Lilium genus.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{southern}} cities at the time, Chicago did not segregate {{most public}} accommodations. According to Walter Francis White of the NAACP, pre-1915 Chicago {{had a good}} reputation for equitable treatment of African Americans. However, unofficially, early 20th-century Chicago beaches were racially segregated. African Americans had <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>history</b> <b>in</b> Chicago, the city sending its first African-American representative to the state legislature in 1876. However, the black population in 1900 was only about 1 percent, while it expanded dramatically {{in the early years}} of the century. Most Irish Americans and African Americans competed for low-end jobs, causing tension between the groups.|$|E

5|$|Biogeography has <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>history</b> <b>in</b> {{the natural}} {{sciences}} concerning the spatial distribution of plants and animals. Ecology and evolution provide the explanatory context for biogeographical studies. Biogeographical patterns result from ecological processes that influence range distributions, such as migration and dispersal. and from historical processes that split populations or species into different areas. The biogeographic processes that result in the natural splitting of species explains much of the modern distribution of the Earth's biota. The splitting of lineages in a species is called vicariance biogeography {{and it is a}} sub-discipline of biogeography. There are also practical applications in the field of biogeography concerning ecological systems and processes. For example, the range and distribution of biodiversity and invasive species responding to climate change is a serious concern and active area of research in the context of global warming.|$|E

5|$|Christianity has <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>history</b> <b>in</b> present-day Turkey, {{which is}} the birthplace of {{numerous}} Christian Apostles and Saints, such as Paul of Tarsus, Timothy, Nicholas of Myra, Polycarp of Smyrna and many others. Saint Peter founded {{one of the first}} churches in Antioch (Antakya), the location of which is regarded by tradition as the spot where he first preached the Gospel, and where the followers of Jesus were called Christians {{for the first time in}} history. The house where Virgin Mary lived the final days of her life until her Assumption (according to Catholic doctrine) or Dormition (according to Orthodox belief), and the tomb of John the Apostle who accompanied her during the voyage to Anatolia after the crucifixion of Jesus, are in Ephesus. The cave churches in Cappadocia were among the hiding places of early Christians during the Roman persecutions against them. The Eastern Orthodox Church has been headquartered in Constantinople (Istanbul) since the First Council of Constantinople in 381 AD. Two of the five major episcopal sees of the Pentarchy (Constantinople and Antioch) instituted by Justinian the Great in 531 AD were located in present-day Turkey during the Byzantine period.|$|E

5|$|In 1985, Neighbours {{started out}} with three {{families}} created by Watson – the Ramsays, the Robinsons and the Clarkes. Watson said {{that he wanted to}} show three families living in a small street, who are friends. Max Ramsay (Francis Bell), his wife Maria (Dasha Blahova) and their sons Shane (Peter O'Brien) and Danny (David Clencie) lived at No.24 Ramsay Street. Single father, Jim Robinson (Alan Dale) lived next door with his children, Paul (Stefan Dennis), Julie (Vikki Blanche), Scott (Darius Perkins) and Lucy (Kylie Flinker). His mother-in-law, Helen Daniels (Anne Haddy) also lived with him. Bachelor Des Clarke (Paul Keane) invited Daphne Lawrence (Elaine Smith) to live at No. 28 with him and they were later married.
