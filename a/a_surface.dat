5|$|A large {{tropical}} wave {{with minimal}} convection moved {{off the coast}} of Africa near Dakar between August 14 and August 15. It moved westward, and gradually developed thunderstorms across the wave axis. On August 21, while located about 450miles (725km) east of the Lesser Antilles, convection increased further within the system, though unfavorable upper-level wind shear prevented rapid development. It continued to become better organized, and though a Reconnaissance flight into the system reported strong winds, it lacked <b>a</b> <b>surface</b> circulation. Late on August 21 the wave passed through the northern Lesser Antilles, and subsequent to a decrease in wind shear the system became much better organized on August 22. <b>A</b> <b>surface</b> circulation formed, and the system developed into Tropical Storm Dean on August 22 near Saint Croix. Dean was upgraded directly to a tropical storm due to the presence of 50mph (80km/h) winds in the storm.|$|E
5|$|A soap bubble forms a sphere, <b>a</b> <b>surface</b> {{with minimal}} area — the {{smallest}} possible surface {{area for the}} volume enclosed.

5|$|Alpha Apodis is {{an orange}} giant of {{spectral}} type K3III located 447 ± 8 {{light years away}} from Earth, with an apparent magnitude of 3.8. It spent much of its life as a blue-white (B-type) main sequence star before expanding, cooling and brightening as it used up its core hydrogen. It has swollen to 48 times the Sun's diameter, and shines with a luminosity approximately 928 {{times that of the}} Sun, with <b>a</b> <b>surface</b> temperature of 4312 K. Beta Apodis is an orange giant 157 ± 2 light years away, with a magnitude of 4.2. It is around 1.84 times as massive as the Sun, with <b>a</b> <b>surface</b> temperature of 4677 K. Gamma Apodis is a yellow giant of spectral type G8III located 156 ± 1 light-years away, with a magnitude of 3.87.

Delta Apodis is a double star, the two components of which are 103 arcseconds apart and visible through binoculars. Delta1 is a red giant star of spectral type M4III located 760 ± 30 light years away. It is a semiregular variable that varies from magnitude +4.66 to +4.87, with pulsations of multiple periods of 68.0, 94.9 and 101.7 days. Delta2 is an orange giant star of spectral type K3III, located 610 ± 30 light years away, with a magnitude of 5.3. The separate components can be resolved with the naked eye.|$|E
5|$|Analysis of the {{spectrum}} can also reveal the surface gravity of the star.

5|$|Exposure {{to reduced}} {{atmospheric}} pressure {{during the period}} after a dive when the residual gas levels have not yet stabilized at atmospheric saturation levels can incur a risk of decompression sickness. Rules for safe ascent are based on extension of the decompression model calculations to the desired altitude, but are generally simplified to a few fixed periods {{for a range of}} exposures. For the extreme case of an exceptional exposure dive, the US Navy requires <b>a</b> <b>surface</b> interval of 48 hours before ascent to altitude. <b>A</b> <b>surface</b> interval of 24 hours for a Heliox decompression dive and 12 hours for Heliox no-decompression dive are also specified. More detailed surface interval requirements based on the highest repetitive group designator obtained in the preceding 24‑hour period are given on the US Navy Diving Manual Table 9.6, both for ascents to specified altitudes, and for commercial flights in aircraft nominally pressurized to 8000ft.|$|E
