5|$|Conwell died on April 22, 1842, at <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>age</b> of 94. Kenrick succeeded to {{the title}} of bishop of Philadelphia. Conwell's death led to one final controversy, as the old bishop's nephews and nieces sued for {{possession}} of the Bishop's Burial Ground, claiming it had been Conwell's private possession. After the threat of excommunication, they withdrew their claim. Conwell's remains were buried in St. Mary's churchyard. In 1864 the remains were transferred to the Cathedral Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul.|$|E
5|$|Thorium is weakly radioactive: {{all of its}} known {{isotopes}} are unstable. The {{most stable}} isotope of thorium, 232Th, has a half-life of 14.05billionyears, or <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>age</b> of the universe; it decays very slowly via alpha decay, starting a decay chain named the thorium series that ends at stable 208Pb. Thorium and uranium {{are the only two}} radioactive elements that still occur naturally in large quantities as primordial elements. It is estimated to be about three to four times more abundant than uranium in the Earth's crust, and is chiefly refined from monazite sands as a by-product of extracting rare-earth metals.|$|E
40|$|In this article, {{the authors}} {{consider}} {{the different approaches}} {{that can be used}} to examine the relationship between physical activity and aging. They propose that much is to be gained in our awareness of this dynamic relationship by drawing on multiple forms of knowledge that can generate diverse understandings regarding the impact of physical activity on physiological, psychological, and social aspects of aging. Accordingly, 3 different approaches to understanding the older physically (in) active body are presented. These are categorized as (a) <b>the</b> objective truth <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>aging,</b> physically active body; (b) <b>the</b> subjective truth <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>aging,</b> physically active body; and (c) "tales" <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>aging,</b> physically active body. The key underpinnings, strengths, and weaknesses of each approach are outlined. A number of examples from the literature are also offered to demonstrate where and how each approach has been used to contribute to our understanding about older people and physical activity. The more thorough, multidisciplinary, and wide spanning our knowledge of <b>the</b> <b>aging,</b> active body is, the more informed we might become in every dimension of its existence...|$|R

5|$|During the Second Great Awakening, {{the region}} was a hotbed of {{religious}} enthusiasm. Between 1817 and 1825, there were several camp meetings and revivals in the Palmyra area. Although Smith's parents disagreed about religion, the family {{was caught up in}} this excitement. Smith later said he became interested in religion by <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>age</b> of twelve. As a teenager, he may have been sympathetic to Methodism. With other family members, Smith also engaged in religious folk magic, which was a relatively common practice in that time and place. Both his parents and his maternal grandfather reportedly had visions or dreams that they believed communicated messages from God. Smith said that, although he had become concerned about the welfare of his soul, he was confused by the claims of competing religious denominations.|$|E
5|$|Gilbert Foliot (c.1110– 18 February 1187) was {{a medieval}} English monk and prelate, {{successively}} Abbot of Gloucester, Bishop of Hereford and Bishop of London. Born to an ecclesiastical family, {{he became a}} monk at Cluny Abbey in France at <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>age</b> of twenty. After holding two posts as prior in the Cluniac order he was appointed Abbot of Gloucester Abbey in 1139, a promotion influenced by his kinsman Miles of Gloucester. During his tenure as abbot he acquired additional land for the abbey, and may have helped to fabricate some charters—legal deeds attesting property ownership—to gain advantage in a dispute with the Archbishops of York. Although Foliot recognised Stephen as the King of England, he may have also sympathised with the Empress Matilda's claim to the throne. He joined Matilda's supporters after her forces captured Stephen, and continued to write letters in support of Matilda even after Stephen's release.|$|E
5|$|In 1864, Rodin {{began to}} live with a young {{seamstress}} named Rose Beuret (born in June 1844), with whom he would stay– with ranging commitment– {{for the rest of his}} life. The couple had a son, Auguste-Eugène Beuret (1866–1934). That year, Rodin offered his first sculpture for exhibition, and entered the studio of Albert-Ernest Carrier-Belleuse, a successful mass producer of objets d'art. Rodin worked as Carrier-Belleuse' chief assistant until 1870, designing roof decorations and staircase and doorway embellishments. With the arrival of the Franco-Prussian War, Rodin was called to serve in the National Guard, but his service was brief due to his near-sightedness. Decorators' work had dwindled because of the war, yet Rodin needed to support his family; poverty was a continual difficulty for Rodin until <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>age</b> of 30. Carrier-Belleuse soon asked Rodin to join him in Belgium, where they would work on ornamentation for the Brussels Stock Exchange.|$|E

5|$|On {{volunteering}} {{for service}} in the war, Hargest sought to serve abroad in command {{of one of the}} infantry brigades of the Second New Zealand Expeditionary Force (2NZEF). However, the newly appointed commander of the 2NZEF, Major General Bernard Freyberg was concerned <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>age</b> and command experience of some potential senior officers of the 2NZEF such as Hargest. A subsequent medical assessment deemed Hargest fit only for service on the Home Front as he was still prone to bouts of shell shock from his service during the First World War. Disappointed with this decision, he approached Peter Fraser, the acting Prime Minister of New Zealand, with a request for a brigade command in 2NZEF. Fraser disregarded official advice and arranged for Hargest to be appointed commander of the 5th Infantry Brigade. At the time, the Chief of the General Staff of the New Zealand Military Forces, Major-General John Duigan, wrote to Freyberg, disassociating himself from the decision.|$|E
5|$|Southwark Crown Court found Harris {{guilty of}} all twelve counts of indecent assault. During the trial, it was learned that, while making Kids Can Say No!, Harris was {{involved}} in a casual sexual relationship with his daughter Bindi's best friend; the relationship began when the victim was 13 years old and lasted for 15 years. Harris had committed nine of the twelve counts by the film's release, including the assault of fifteen-year-old Tonya Lee in London three months before the release. The first victim was <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>age</b> of the children in Kids Can Say No! The last assault of which Harris was convicted occurred several weeks after his meeting with officials in Western Australia to propose another film about child sexual abuse. A former child actor from the Barbara Speake Stage School who appeared in Kids Can Say No! said that Harris' behavior with older girls at the school made Harris' eventual arrest unsurprising.|$|E
5|$|The Haraldskær Woman (or Haraldskjaer Woman) is a bog {{body of a}} woman found {{naturally}} {{preserved in}} a bog in Jutland, Denmark, and dating from about 490 BC (pre-Roman Iron Age). Workers found the body in 1835 while excavating peat on the Haraldskær Estate. The anaerobic conditions and acids of the peat bog contributed to the body's excellent preservation. Not only was the intact skeleton found, but so were the skin and internal organs. Scientists settled disputes <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>age</b> and identity of this well preserved body in 1977, when radiocarbon dating determined conclusively that the woman's death occurred around the 5th century BC.|$|E

5|$|The {{lifespan}} of the Columbian mammoth {{is thought}} to have been about 80 years. The lifespan of a mammal is related to its size; Columbian mammoths are larger than modern elephants, which have a lifespan of about 60 years. The age of a mammoth can be roughly determined by counting the growth rings of its tusks when viewed in cross section. However, ring-counting does not account for a mammoth's early years; early growth is represented in tusk tips, which are usually worn away. In the remainder of the tusk each major line represents a year, with weekly and daily lines found in between. Dark bands correspond to summer, making it possible to determine the season in which a mammoth died. Tusk growth slowed when foraging became more difficult, such as during illness or when a male mammoth was banished from the herd (male elephants live with their herds until <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>age</b> of ten).|$|E
5|$|Although {{there is}} some debate within Islam over {{whether it is a}} {{religious}} requirement, circumcision (called khitan) is practiced nearly universally by Muslim males. Islam bases its practice of circumcision on the Genesis 17 narrative, the same Biblical chapter referred to by Jews. The procedure is not explicitly mentioned in the Quran, however, it is a tradition established by Islam's prophet Muhammad directly (following Abraham), and so its practice is considered a sunnah (prophet's tradition) and is very important in Islam. For Muslims, circumcision is also a matter of cleanliness, purification and control over one's baser self (nafs). There is no agreement across the many Islamic communities <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>age</b> at which circumcision should be performed. It may be done from soon after birth up to about age 15; most often it is performed at around six to seven years of age. The timing can correspond with the boy's completion of his recitation of the whole Quran, with a coming-of-age event such as taking on the responsibility of daily prayer or betrothal. Circumcision may be celebrated with an associated family or community event. Circumcision is recommended for, but is not required of, converts to Islam.|$|E
