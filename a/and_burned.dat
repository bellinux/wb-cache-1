40|$|Education {{can play}} a {{critical}} role in moving farmers in developing countries away from environmentally harmful slash <b>and</b> <b>burn</b> agriculture. The present research examines the extent to which extension education can promote adoption of cropping systems other than slash <b>and</b> <b>burn.</b> Choice of cropping system by farmers in Cameroon, whether slash <b>and</b> <b>burn,</b> multiple crops, or mono-cropping, is modeled as a function of farm size, farmer educational level, and visits by extension personnel. Results indicate that higher visitation rates by extension personnel reduce not only the likelihood of farmers choosing slash <b>and</b> <b>burn</b> agriculture, but also promotes movement into mono-cropping. Since mono-cropping represents a move toward export-oriented agriculture in Cameroon, this movement may assist in promoting greater economic development across western Africa. Continued efforts in extension education are, therefore, critical in both reducing the environmental damage from slash <b>and</b> <b>burn</b> agriculture <b>and</b> promoting adoption of more profitable cropping systems. conservation, slash <b>and</b> <b>burn,</b> production technology, economic development, Farm Management,...|$|R

It defines slash <b>and</b> <b>burn</b> agriculture too broadly and misrepresents the nature and causes of the 1997 – 98 fires by virtue of attributing them entirely to slash <b>and</b> <b>burn</b> agriculture. Its economic assessment of the costs of the fires is also problematic.
