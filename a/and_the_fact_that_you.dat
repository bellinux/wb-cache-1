500|$|After Maxwell's Urban Hang Suite was completed, the {{finished}} recordings {{were presented to}} Columbia Records in mid 1995. It was shelved for nearly a year, because of issues with Columbia's management, the label's extensive reorganization, and record executives' doubts regarding the album's commercial potential. The marketplace dominance of hip hop soul in 1995 was in contrast with Maxwell's monogamous themes and older soul influences, which Columbia worried would be interpreted as old-fashioned. The label's executives also feared that his romantic concept and image would not appeal to listeners. Maxwell made matters worse by refusing to allow his picture {{to be placed on}} the album's front cover; instead he preferred to have the track listing and other information he felt was more important about the album in place of his photo. Regarding the cover, Maxwell later said [...] "I wanted people to have the facts: the title, the selections <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> had to basically buy it. I wanted people to come to the music and not base any opinion on the image". Columbia reached a compromise with Maxwell and used a promotional shot of him as the back cover. The album's front cover art also features a picture of a pair of golden women's shoes {{on the floor of a}} hotel room, with the bar coding prominently displayed. In the period before its release, Maxwell wrote and demoed songs for a subsequent studio album, and embarked on an African American college tour with Groove Theory and the Fugees.|$|E

[...] "There's something about it– there were echoes of it in No Country for Old Men that were quite interesting for us", he said, [...] "because it was the idea of the physical work that somebody does that helps reveal who they are and is part of the fiber of the story.
