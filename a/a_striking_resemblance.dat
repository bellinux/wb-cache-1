5|$|Although van der Weyden did not {{adhere to}} the {{conventions}} of idealisation, he generally sought to flatter his sitters. He depicted his models in highly fashionable clothing, often with rounded—almost sculpted—facial features, some of which deviated from natural representation. He adapted his own aesthetic, and his portraits of women often bear <b>a</b> <b>striking</b> <b>resemblance</b> to each other.|$|E
5|$|The {{issue of}} piracy cropped up when a news article {{published}} in The Indian Express exposed {{the dark side of}} the film market. Hardly into weeks of the film's release, CDs were being sold at as low as Rs. 40. Another blemish was that Soumitra Dasgupta, a writer and close associate of Sarkar alleged that the film's story had <b>a</b> <b>striking</b> <b>resemblance</b> to his parallel work on the novella.|$|E
5|$|The party discovers a Somnia Castle in the “Phantom World” and {{learns that}} the prince is missing {{and that the}} Hero looks like him. They also meet Captain Rusty, who bears <b>a</b> <b>striking</b> <b>resemblance</b> to Captain Blade. Gaining {{entrance}} to the Moonmirror Tower, the party meets Ashlynn, {{a woman who was}} invisible in the “Phantom World” at first, too, and together they find the Mirror of Ra.|$|E
50|$|Ogi bears <b>a</b> <b>striking</b> {{physical}} <b>resemblance</b> to Eric Cartman of South Park, {{although this}} is presumably coincidental.|$|R
5000|$|The Chorus of [...] "Don't Cry for me, Argentina" [...] from [...] "Evita" [...] also bears <b>a</b> very <b>striking</b> <b>resemblance</b> to {{the main}} theme of the Final Movement of Brahms' Violin Concerto.|$|R
50|$|Maria Elandos Tabey, Chuck Tabey's mother, {{whom he has}} {{not seen}} for years. She was blackmailed into leaving by Calvin Bonner over her gay brother. She also bears <b>a</b> very <b>striking</b> <b>resemblance</b> to Omaha.|$|R
5|$|It {{has also}} been noted that the plot of Cars bears <b>a</b> <b>striking</b> <b>resemblance</b> to that of Doc Hollywood, the 1991 romantic comedy which stars Michael J. Fox as a hotshot young doctor, who, after causing a traffic {{accident}} in a small town, is sentenced {{to work at the}} town hospital, {{falls in love with a}} local law student and eventually acquires an appreciation for small town values. Some have gone so far as to say that the makers of Cars plagiarized the script of Doc Hollywood.|$|E
5|$|The Tempest {{may take}} its overall {{structure}} from traditional Italian commedia dell'arte, which sometimes featured a magus and his daughter, their supernatural attendants, {{and a number}} of rustics. The commedia often featured a clown known as Arlecchino (or his predecessor, Zanni) and his partner Brighella, who bear <b>a</b> <b>striking</b> <b>resemblance</b> to Stephano and Trinculo; a lecherous Neapolitan hunchback who corresponds to Caliban; and the clever and beautiful Isabella, whose wealthy and manipulative father, Pantalone, constantly seeks a suitor for her, thus mirroring the relationship between Miranda and Prospero.|$|E
5|$|As Ko and Aoba {{enter their}} summer break, {{a girl named}} Akane Takigawa with <b>a</b> <b>striking</b> <b>resemblance</b> to Wakaba moves in next door to Ko. This causes mixed {{feelings}} among the various characters, particularly Ko, Aoba, and Akaishi (who had also liked Wakaba). Akane soon becomes friends with Ko and Tsukishimas, and begins working in the Tsukishima cafe. As another year begins, the romantic subplots further solidify when Yūhei expresses an interest in Aoba. Meanwhile, Seishu gains a new assistant coach {{in the form of}} Yūhei's older brother Junpei, after Ichiyo agrees to marry him if Seishu makes it to Koshien.|$|E
50|$|The {{style of}} {{handwriting}} of this codex bears <b>a</b> <b>striking</b> general <b>resemblance</b> {{to that of}} three Gospel manuscripts of the 10th and 11th centuries: Codex Cyprius, Lectionary 296, and ℓ 1599.|$|R
50|$|Ridiearl (Ridiēru) is the {{commander}} of the paladin army that led the human invasion of Hell. She has a zealous hatred of devils, yet bears <b>a</b> <b>striking</b> physical <b>resemblance</b> to Jenarose, the master of Hell.|$|R
50|$|In 1990, Cox co-starred as Los Angeles Police Chief Roger Kendrick in the {{short-lived}} Cop Rock, presenting <b>a</b> <b>striking</b> physical <b>resemblance</b> to the real-world incumbent, Chief Daryl Gates. He also appeared as the antagonistic Mars Administrator Vilos Cohaagen in Total Recall the same year.|$|R
5|$|Cross-linguistically, the-ma suffix may {{be related}} to a coverbial suffix in Jaminjung, a {{language}} in which coverb roots occur without any aspect markers, but are then suffixed with -mayan, which marks continuous aspect. This coverb suffix bears <b>a</b> <b>striking</b> <b>resemblance</b> to the sum of the Wagiman -ma suffix and the continuous aspect suffix -yan, which always occur in tandem on coverbs. Together, -ma and -yan perform the same semantic function as Jaminjung -mayan. Precisely what the relationship holds between these suffixes; whether one language borrowed from the other, or whether each language inherited them from earlier languages, is not at all clear.|$|E
5|$|In 1991 Christiaan Schuckman {{discovered}} {{a set of}} signed plates in Madrid that {{can be attributed to}} the engraver of the First Folio portrait. These plates bear Droeshout's signature and are stylistically similar to his portrait of Shakespeare. (They include a portrait of the priest and writer Franciso de la Peña that has <b>a</b> <b>striking</b> <b>resemblance</b> to the English poet). On the evidence of these plates, which were made between 1635 and 1639, Schuckman attributed the portrait of Shakespeare to the younger Martin and suggested that the engraver had converted to Catholicism and emigrated to Spain in 1635, where he continued to work.|$|E
5|$|Archaeological {{investigations}} conducted unearthed square or circular Chera coins made {{of copper}} from near Cochin. This {{was for the}} first time, from a stratographic context, coins of Sangam Chera period {{have been found in}} Kerala. The coin, which is almost a square in shape, has an elephant facing to the right and some symbols towards the top of the coin. The symbols could not be identified as {{the upper part of the}} coin was partially corroded. A drawn bow and arrow was visible on the other side. Below the arrow is an elephant goad (a prod used to control elephants). These coins bear <b>a</b> <b>striking</b> <b>resemblance</b> to the ones excavated from Karur in Tamil Nadu, said the archaeologists.|$|E
50|$|In February 2004, an {{individual}} with <b>a</b> <b>striking</b> physical <b>resemblance</b> to Fisher was arrested in Vancouver, British Columbia by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. Fingerprints eventually confirmed {{that he was not}} Fisher. He was held by Canadian police for approximately one week until a family member correctly identified him.|$|R
5000|$|He {{has been}} both criticized and praised for having a similar voice and {{delivery}} to The Notorious B.I.G. and even pays homage to Biggie on his [...] "Real Niggaz Say Real Shit" [...] mixtape, on the track [...] "Letter to B.I.G." [...] Williamson also bears <b>a</b> <b>striking</b> physical <b>resemblance</b> to Biggie.|$|R
50|$|Soichiro Honda was {{the owner}} of a 1969 Pontiac Firebird, to which the Accord's predecessor, the Honda 1300, bore <b>a</b> <b>striking</b> frontal <b>resemblance.</b> Initial {{planning}} done by Honda for what would become the Accord was for a sporty competitor in the pony car market, at roughly the size of a contemporary Ford Mustang, powered by a six-cylinder engine.|$|R
5|$|He {{examines}} {{in detail}} the expression of evolutionary stages {{in the development of}} embryos, tracing from the process of cell division to the development of specific anatomical features. He finds <b>a</b> <b>striking</b> <b>resemblance</b> between the embryonic development of reptiles and birds, including details of the skeletal anatomy (with special attention to the hands and feet) and various organs. He notes that bird and reptile embryos develop visceral arches, hinting at their aquatic ancestry. Of more interest to his goal, Heilmann writes in a similar vein that the embryos of certain birds clearly show a three-clawed finger structure, at least one of which (the hoatzin) retains actual claws after hatching. He mentions other anatomical features of bird embryos that hint at their reptilian ancestry as well, such as the embryonic splitting of the pygostyle into distinct separate vertebrae.|$|E
5|$|The club crest {{has been}} a rampant lion since 1936, which was also {{introduced}} by Charlie Hewitt. There have been many variations of the lion; {{the first was a}} single red lion, often mistakenly said to be chosen because of the club's Scottish roots. The lion bore <b>a</b> <b>striking</b> <b>resemblance</b> to signs used by pubs named The Red Lion. From 1956 to 1974 Millwall's crest was two leaping red lions facing each other. Former chairman Theo Paphitis brought back the badge in 1999, where it was used for a further eight years. The current crest is a leaping lion, which first appeared on a Millwall kit in 1979. It remained until 1999 and was re-introduced again in 2007. The club mascot is a giant lion called Zampa, so named after Zampa Road, the postal address of The Den.|$|E
5|$|Another {{defense that}} often uses color or shape to deceive {{potential}} enemies is mimicry. A number of longhorn beetles (family Cerambycidae) bear <b>a</b> <b>striking</b> <b>resemblance</b> to wasps, which helps them avoid predation {{even though the}} beetles are in fact harmless. Batesian and Müllerian mimicry complexes are commonly found in Lepidoptera. Genetic polymorphism and natural selection give rise to otherwise edible species (the mimic) gaining a survival advantage by resembling inedible species (the model). Such a mimicry complex {{is referred to as}} Batesian and is most commonly known by the mimicry by the limenitidine viceroy butterfly of the inedible danaine monarch. Later research has discovered that the viceroy is, in fact more toxic than the monarch and this resemblance should be considered as a case of Müllerian mimicry. In Müllerian mimicry, inedible species, usually within a taxonomic order, find it advantageous to resemble each other so as to reduce the sampling rate by predators who need to learn about the insects' inedibility. Taxa from the toxic genus Heliconius form one of the most well known Müllerian complexes.|$|E
50|$|Izanagi's {{visit to}} his wife Izanami in Yomi-no-kuni {{somewhat}} parallels the Greek Orpheus's visit to Eurydice in the underworld, but <b>a</b> more <b>striking</b> <b>resemblance</b> is his wife's inability to return after eating the food in hell, matched by Persephone of Greek myth. There is also an odd resemblance to the myth of Adam and Eve, while one of China's Four Great Folktales, Baishe Zhuan, {{appears to be a}} modernized retelling.|$|R
5000|$|Frank James {{was said}} to have <b>a</b> <b>striking</b> {{physical}} <b>resemblance</b> to his father. His father named him after the famous American outlaw Frank James; his brother was named for Jesse James. When Bonanno soldier and enforcer Frankie Saggio years later asked Frank's brother, Jesse James Burke, why their father named them after the notorious outlaws, Jesse said [...] "Because he thought it was funny." ...|$|R
5000|$|The printer J.G Austin, {{responsible}} for a lithograph of St James {{in the year of}} Hill's death, also printed in the same year, [...] "a very correct likeness of this lamented gentleman, drawn on stone by Mr. Rodius, from a painting by Mr. Reid, the artist". This lithograph was lauded as [...] "one of the best colonial attempts in the Lithographic line of art ... yet witnessed. <b>A</b> more <b>striking</b> <b>resemblance</b> it would not be easy to pourtray".|$|R
5|$|Scully visits Kresge, {{wanting to}} look further into Roberta Sim's suicide, {{despite the fact}} that the police think it is a simple suicide. Scully finds <b>a</b> <b>striking</b> <b>resemblance</b> between the Sims' daughter, Emily, and her sister Melissa from when she was that age. Scully flashes back to a funeral she {{attended}} when she was a little girl but imagines Marshall Sim holding her hand. Scully insists on performing an autopsy on Roberta, thinking that she was murdered. Scully finds a needle puncture in Roberta's foot, causing her to believe that she was anesthetized and her suicide was staged. The police search the Sim's house and find a used hypodermic needle, which Marshall claims was used for injecting the anemic Emily with treatment. Scully spots the dark-suited men watching from a nearby car. Scully receives DNA data on Melissa, and matching it up to Emily's finds them nearly identical, causing her to believe that Emily is Melissa's daughter. Scully believes that Melissa gave birth to her while on the west coast and gave her up for adoption without ever telling the rest of the family. Scully flashes back to when she and Melissa were teenagers and were given cross necklaces from their mother for Christmas.|$|E
5|$|Temples {{built in}} and around the Kalyani region (in the Bidar district) were quite {{different}} from those built in other regions. Without exception, the articulation was nagara, and the temple plan as a rule was either stepped-diamond or stellate. The elevations corresponding to these two plans were similar because star shapes were produced by rotating the corner projections of a standard stepped plan in increments of 11.25 degrees, resulting in a 32-pointed interrupted plan in which three star points are skipped in the centre of each side of the shrine. Examples of stepped-diamond plans surviving in Karnataka are the Dattatreya Temple at Chattarki, the Someshvara Temple in Kadlewad, and the Mallikarjuna and Siddhesvara at Kalgi in the Gulbarga district. The nagara shrine at Chattarki is a stepped diamond of projecting corners with five projections per side. Because of the stepped-diamond plan, the wall pillars have two fully exposed sides, with a high base block decorated with a mirrored stalk motif and two large wall images above. The shapes and decorations {{on the rest of the}} wall pillar have <b>a</b> <b>striking</b> <b>resemblance</b> to the actual pillars supporting the ceiling.|$|E

25|$|In February 2004, an {{individual}} with <b>a</b> <b>striking</b> physical <b>resemblance</b> to Fisher was arrested in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. Fingerprints eventually confirmed {{that he was not}} Fisher. He was held by Canadian police for approximately one week until a family member correctly identified him. The FBI alerted local law enforcement in 2012 that Fisher may be living in the Payson area in Gila County.|$|R
5000|$|Eric Wood (born March 18, 1986) is an American {{football}} {{center for}} the Buffalo Bills of the National Football League (NFL). He was the team's second pick {{in the first round}} of the 2009 NFL Draft (28th overall). Wood played his collegiate football at the University of Louisville. He has been noted to bear <b>a</b> <b>striking</b> physical <b>resemblance</b> to <b>a</b> grown-up [...] "Thurman Merman" [...] (played by Brett Kelly) from the movie Bad Santa.|$|R
50|$|Double Diamond is a cheap popular {{brand of}} {{filtered}} cigars. These cigars are predominantly natural tobacco mixed {{with many other}} additives. The cigars have <b>a</b> similar <b>striking</b> <b>resemblance</b> to regular cigarettes and are sold in packs of 20 like most other major brands of cigarettes. Although there are many rumors that these cigars are healthier than regular cigarettes, they are actually much worse for the human body, especially the lungs. However, the nicotine content in Double Diamonds is very mild and nicotine addiction {{is less likely to}} occur if smoked in moderation.|$|R
25|$|The {{illustrations}} of the Lion and the Unicorn (also in Looking-Glass) bear <b>a</b> <b>striking</b> <b>resemblance</b> to Tenniel's Punch {{illustrations of}} Gladstone and Disraeli.|$|E
25|$|In May 2007, the Tamil Nadu Archaeology Department found pots with arrow-head symbols {{during an}} {{excavation}} in Melaperumpallam near Poompuhar. These symbols are {{claimed to have}} <b>a</b> <b>striking</b> <b>resemblance</b> to seals unearthed in Mohenjo-daro in present-day Pakistan in the 1920s.|$|E
25|$|Poirot also bears <b>a</b> <b>striking</b> <b>resemblance</b> to A. E. W. Mason's fictional detective, Inspector Hanaud of the French Sûreté, {{who first}} {{appeared}} in the 1910 novel At the Villa Rose and predates the first Poirot novel by ten years.|$|E
25|$|The {{style of}} {{handwriting}} of the codex bears <b>a</b> <b>striking</b> general <b>resemblance</b> {{to that of}} three Gospel lectionaries of the 10th and 11th centuries: Lectionary 296, ℓ 1599, and ℓ 3. The letters and words are not separated from one another (scriptio-continua). There is frequent insertion of a point as a mark of interpunction. This has been supposed to occur in an ancient stichometrical style of writing. A dot is always used to denote {{the end of the}} stichos.|$|R
50|$|In 1487, {{a priest}} named Richard Simon or Symonds {{appeared}} in Ireland {{with a young}} boy called Lambert Simnel, who, due to <b>a</b> <b>striking</b> physical <b>resemblance,</b> was passed off as Edward IV's nephew Edward, Earl of Warwick, whose claim to the throne as heir of the House of York was considerably stronger {{than that of the}} new Tudor dynasty. In fact the real Warwick was a prisoner in the Tower of London, where he remained until he was executed in 1499.|$|R
