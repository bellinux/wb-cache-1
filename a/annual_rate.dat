From William, who died in 1223, Royton passed to his son Thomas, who was still alive in 1254. Thomas's daughter Margery, who married Alexander Luttrell of Somerset, sold the majority of Royton and its outlying land to John de Byron in around 1260.

5|$|Hydraulic mining, which Pliny {{referred}} to as ruina montium ("ruin of the mountains"), allowed base and precious metals to be extracted on a proto-industrial scale. The total annual iron output is estimated at 82,500tonnes. Copper was produced at an <b>annual</b> <b>rate</b> of 15,000t, and lead at 80,000t, both production levels unmatched until the Industrial Revolution; Hispania alone had a 40% share in world lead production. The high lead output was a by-product of extensive silver mining which reached 200t per annum. At its peak around the mid-2nd century AD, the Roman silver stock is estimated at 10,000t, five to ten {{times larger than the}} combined silver mass of medieval Europe and the Caliphate around 800AD.

5|$|The advent in {{the mid-1990s}} of ’no-frills’ carriers, such as easyJet, has had a {{significant}} impact on air travel in the UK. In 2005 these airlines carried 77.5million passengers, up from just 4.3million in 1996. They are responsible for the growth of regional airports, operating from 35 airports in 2006 compared to 10 in 1996, and increasing the choice of international destinations, serving 150 in 2006, compared to 12 a decade earlier. The <b>annual</b> <b>rate</b> of growth in the overall demand for air travel has remained stable since 1975, averaging 5.8 per cent annually. Recent growth is being serviced by the no-frills airlines at the expense of traditional carriers which, since 2000, have experienced flat or declining traffic levels. In response, traditional carriers have lowered costs to compete more effectively on price, leading to lower prices on the short haul routes serviced by this sector, especially in business fares. They have also limited or reduced capacity and in some cases launched no-frills subsidiaries of their own.|$|E
5|$|The {{profitability}} {{of the agricultural}} sector attracted foreign capital for railways and industries. British capital investments went from just over £20 million in 1880 to £157 million in 1890. During the 1880s, investment began to show some diversification as capital began to flow from other countries such as France, Germany and Belgium, though British investment still accounted for two thirds of total foreign capital. In 1890 Argentina was the destination of choice for British investment in Latin America, a position it held until World War I. By then, Argentina had absorbed between 40% and 50% of all British investment outside the United Kingdom. Despite its dependence on the British market, Argentina managed a 6.7% <b>annual</b> <b>rate</b> of growth of exports between 1870 and 1890 {{as a result of}} successful geographic and commodity diversification.|$|E
5|$|African {{elephants}} {{were listed}} as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) in 2008, with no independent {{assessment of the}} conservation status of the two forms. In 1979, Africa had an estimated minimum population of 1.3million elephants, with a possible upper limit of 3.0million. By 1989, the population {{was estimated to be}} 609,000; with 277,000 in Central Africa, 110,000 in eastern Africa, 204,000 in southern Africa, and 19,000 in western Africa. About 214,000 elephants were estimated to live in the rainforests, fewer than had previously been thought. From 1977 to 1989, elephant populations declined by 74% in East Africa. After 1987, losses in elephant numbers accelerated, and savannah populations from Cameroon to Somalia experienced a decline of 80%. African forest elephants had a total loss of 43%. Population trends in southern Africa were mixed, with anecdotal reports of losses in Zambia, Mozambique and Angola while populations grew in Botswana and Zimbabwe and were stable in South Africa. Conversely, studies in 2005 and 2007 found populations in eastern and southern Africa were increasing by an average <b>annual</b> <b>rate</b> of 4.0%. Due to the vast areas involved, assessing the total African elephant population remains difficult and involves an element of guesswork. The IUCN estimates a total of around 440,000 individuals for 2012.|$|E

5|$|The nominal gross {{domestic}} product (GDP) of Uttar Pradesh grew at an <b>annual</b> <b>rate</b> of 8 to 12 percent between 2002–03 and 2006-07. When Mayawati began her five-year tenure as chief minister from May 2007, the average annual state GDP growth rate between 2007–08 and 2010-11 shot up to 17 percent. In financial year 2011, UP’s state GDP was predicted to grow by 11 per cent. Thus, UP’s nominal GDP growth in these four years (2007–11) was almost the same as what the entire country clocked in that period. State’s per capita income went up by 136 per cent from about Rs 11,000 in 2007 to Rs 26,000 in 2011. UP continued {{to be one of}} the few states with a revenue surplus and Mayawati has used this surplus to reduce the state’s fiscal deficit from 4 percent of state GDP in 2007-08 to a budgeted figure of 2.97 per cent for the financial year 2011. Mayawati also ensured that the state’s indebtedness came down from 43 percent of state GDP in 2007-08 to 32 percent in 2011-12. Mayawati in her five years added about 4,000 MW of generation capacity to the state’s power sector. Mayawati also planned to create 7,000 MW more generation capacity by the end of 2012 for achieving her target is to make state a power-surplus state by 2017 for which the state is already executing power projects with a total capacity of 10,000 MW.|$|E
5|$|In {{the field}} of {{statistics}} and applied probability, John Graunt published Natural and Political Observations Made upon the Bills of Mortality also in 1662, initiating the discipline of demography. This work, among other things, gave a statistical estimate {{of the population of}} London, produced the first life table, gave probabilities of survival of different age groups, examined the different causes of death, noting that the <b>annual</b> <b>rate</b> of suicide and accident is constant, and commented on the level and stability of sex ratio. The usefulness and interpretation of Graunt's tables were discussed in a series of correspondences by brothers Ludwig and Christiaan Huygens in 1667, where they realized the difference between mean and median estimates and Christian even interpolated Graunt's life table by a smooth curve, creating the first continuous probability distribution; but their correspondences were not published. Later, Johan de Witt, the then prime minister of the Dutch Republic, published similar material in his 1671 work Waerdye van Lyf-Renten (A Treatise on Life Annuities), which used statistical concepts to determine life expectancy for practical political purposes; a demonstration of the fact that this sapling branch of mathematics had significant pragmatic applications. De Witt's work was not widely distributed beyond the Dutch Republic, perhaps due to his fall from power and execution by mob in 1672. Apart from the practical contributions of these two work, they also exposed a fundamental idea that probability can be assigned to events that do not have inherent physical symmetry, such as the chances of dying at certain age, unlike say the rolling of a dice or flipping of a coin, simply by counting the frequency of occurrence. Thus probability could be more than mere combinatorics.|$|E
5|$|The central {{government}} soon observed the economic advantages of printing paper money, issuing a monopoly right {{of several of}} the deposit shops to the issuance of these certificates of deposit. By the early 12th century, the amount of banknotes issued in a single year amounted to an <b>annual</b> <b>rate</b> of 26million strings of cash coins. By the 1120s the {{central government}} officially stepped in and produced their own state-issued paper money (using woodblock printing). Even before this point, the Song government was amassing large amounts of paper tribute. It was recorded that each year before 1101 AD, the prefecture of Xinan (modern Xi-xian, Anhui) alone would send 1,500,000 sheets of paper in seven different varieties to the capital at Kaifeng. In that year of 1101, the Emperor Huizong of Song decided to lessen the amount of paper taken in the tribute quota, because it was causing detrimental effects and creating heavy burdens on the people of the region. However, the government still needed masses of paper product for the exchange certificates and the state's new issuing of paper money. For the printing of paper money alone, the Song court established several government-run factories in the cities of Huizhou, Chengdu, Hangzhou, and Anqi. The size of the workforce employed in these paper money factories were quite large, as it was recorded in 1175 AD that the factory at Hangzhou alone employed more than a thousand workers a day. However, the government issues of paper money were not yet nationwide standards of currency at that point; issues of banknotes were limited to regional zones of the empire, and were valid for use only in a designated and temporary limit of 3-year's time. The geographic limitation changed between the years 1265 and 1274, when the late Southern Song government finally produced a nationwide standard currency of paper money, once its widespread circulation was backed by gold or silver. The range of varying values for these banknotes was perhaps from one string of cash to one hundred at the most. In later dynasties, the use and enforcement of paper currency was a method undertaken by the government {{as a response to the}} counterfeiting of copper coins.|$|E
