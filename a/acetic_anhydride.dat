5|$|The {{synthesis}} of aspirin {{is classified as}} an esterification reaction. Salicylic acid is treated with <b>acetic</b> <b>anhydride,</b> an acid derivative, causing a chemical reaction that turns salicylic acid's hydroxyl group into an ester group (R-OH → R-OCOCH3). This process yields aspirin and acetic acid, which is considered a byproduct of this reaction. Small amounts of sulfuric acid (and occasionally phosphoric acid) are almost always used as a catalyst. This method is commonly employed in undergraduate teaching labs.|$|E
5|$|The {{synthesis}} of oligonucleotide phosphorothioates (OPS, see below) {{does not involve}} the oxidation with I2/water, and, respectively, does not suffer from the side reaction described above. On the other hand, if the capping step is performed prior to sulfurization, the solid support may contain the residual <b>acetic</b> <b>anhydride</b> and N-methylimidazole left after the capping step. The capping mixture interferes with the sulfur transfer reaction, which results in the extensive formation of the phosphate triester internucleosidic linkages {{in place of the}} desired PS triesters. Therefore, for the {{synthesis of}} OPS, it is advisable to conduct the sulfurization step prior to the capping step.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Two sensitive, selective, economic, and {{validated}} spectrofluorimetric {{methods were}} {{developed for the}} determination of ebastine (EBS) in pharmaceutical preparations depending on reaction with its tertiary amino group.

Because <b>acetic</b> <b>anhydride</b> is not stable in water, the conversion is conducted under anhydrous conditions.|$|E
