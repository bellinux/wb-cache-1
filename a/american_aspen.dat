50|$|Populus tremuloides is a {{deciduous}} tree {{native to}} cooler areas of North America, {{one of several}} species referred to by the common name aspen. It is commonly called quaking aspen, trembling aspen, <b>American</b> <b>aspen,</b> Quakies, mountain or golden aspen, trembling poplar, white poplar, popple, and even more names. The trees have tall trunks, up to 25 meters (82 feet) tall, with smooth pale bark, scarred with black. The glossy green leaves, dull beneath, become golden to yellow, rarely red, in autumn. The species often propagates through its roots to form large clonal groves originating from a shared root system. These roots are not rhizomes, as new growth develops from adventitious buds on the parent root system (the ortet).|$|E

5000|$|All of {{the species}} in section Populus {{typically}} grow in large clonal colonies derived from a single seedling, and spreading by means of root suckers; new stems in the colony may appear at up to 30-40 metres from the previous trees. Each individual tree can live for 40-150 years above ground, but the root system of the colony is long-lived, sending up new trunks as the older trunks die off above ground, spreading about a metre per year, sometimes eventually covering many hectares. They are able to survive forest fires because the roots are below {{the heat of the}} fire, and new sprouts can grow from the roots. One such colony of <b>American</b> <b>aspen</b> (P. tremuloides) in Utah, given the nickname of [...] "Pando", is estimated to be 80,000 years old, making it possibly the oldest living colony of aspens.|$|E
40|$|The {{ecological}} {{consequences of}} biodiversity {{have become a}} prominent public issue. Little is known {{on the effect of}} genetic diversity on ecosystem services. Here, a diversity experiment was established with European and North <b>American</b> <b>aspen</b> (Populus tremula, P. tremuloides) planted in plots representing either a single deme only or combinations of two, four and eight demes. The goals of this study were to explore the complex inter- and intraspecific genetic diversity of aspen and to then relate three measures for diversity (deme diversity, genetic diversity determined as Shannon index or as expected heterozygosity) to arthropod abundance. Microsatellite and AFLP markers were used to analyze the genetic variation patterns within and between the aspen demes and deme mixtures. Large differences were observed regarding the genetic diversity within demes. An analysis of molecular variance revealed that most of the total genetic diversity was found within demes, but the genetic differentiation among demes was also high. The complex patterns of genetic diversity and differentiation resulted in large differences of the genetic variation within plots. The average diversity increased from plots with only one deme to plots with two, four and eight demes, respectively and separated plots with and without <b>American</b> <b>aspen.</b> To test whether intra- and interspecific diversity impacts on ecosystem services, arthropod abundance was determined. Increasing genetic diversity of aspen was related to increasing abundance of arthropods. However, the relationship was mainly driven by the presence of <b>American</b> <b>aspen</b> suggesting that species identity overrode the effect of intraspecific variation of European aspen...|$|E
40|$|A new exposure-based metric {{approach}} to predict O 3 risk to North <b>American</b> <b>aspen</b> forests has been developed. The United States and Canada currently use exposure-based metrics to protect vegetation from O 3. Using 5 years (1999 e 2003) of co-measured O 3, meteorology and growth response, {{we have developed}} exposure-based regression models that predict Populus tremuloides growth change within the North American ambient air quality context. The models comprised growing season fourth-highest daily maximum 8 -h average O 3 concentration, growing degree days, and wind speed. They had high statistical significance, high goodness of fit, include 95 % con-fidence intervals for tree growth change, and are simple to use. Averaged across {{a wide range of}} clonal sensitivity, historical 2001 e 2003 growth change over most of the 26 M ha P. tremuloides distribution was estimated to have ranged from no impact (0 %) to strong negative impacts (e 31 %). With four aspen clones responding negatively (one responded positively) to O 3, the growing season fourth-highest daily maximum 8 -h average O 3 concentration performed much better than growing season SUM 06, AOT 40 or maximum 1 h average O 3 concentration metrics as a single indicator of aspen stem cross-sectional area growth...|$|E

40|$|Clonality is {{a common}} {{phenomenon}} in plants, allowing genets to persist asexually for much {{longer periods of time}} than ramets. The relative frequency of sexual vs. asexual reproduction determines long-term dominance and persistence of clonal plants at the landscape scale. One of the most familiar and valued clonal plants in North America is aspen (Populus tremuloides). Previous researchers have suggested that aspen in xeric landscapes of the intermountain west represent genets of great chronological age, maintained via clonal expansion in the near absence of sexual reproduction. We synthesized microsatellite data from 1371 ramets in two large sampling grids in Utah. We found a surprisingly large number of distinct genets, some covering large spatial areas, but most represented by only one to a few individual ramets at a sampling scale of 50 m. In general, multi-ramet genets were spatially cohesive, although some genets appear to be fragmented remnants of much larger clones. We conclude that recent sexual reproduction in these landscapes is a stronger contributor to standing genetic variation at the population level than the accumulation of somatic mutations, and that even some of the spatially large clones may not be as ancient as previously supposed. Further, a striking majority of the largest genets in both study areas had three alleles at one or more loci, suggesting triploidy or aneuploidy. These genets tended to be spatially clustered but not closely related. Together, these findings substantially advance our understanding of clonal dynamics in western North <b>American</b> <b>aspen,</b> and {{set the stage for a}} broad range of future studies...|$|E
40|$|This {{presentation}} (along with {{a similar}} Canadian perspective) will offer a context for subsequent papers in the Advances in North <b>American</b> <b>Aspen</b> Ecology session. Collectively, we hope to outline major areas of research in North America, especially {{as they relate to}} perceived management needs. There is a long and rich history of ecological research in aspen systems of the United States. Probably the most striking long-term change, from a managerial perspective, has been a shift toward biological benefits of aspen as opposed to past avoidance, or even active denudation, of these systems in favor of more commercial species. This talk will focus on important contributions of the past decade as it explores vital areas of needed research. Sources for this presentation include a review of salient literature and summation of researcher and manager conclaves that have taken place over the past year in the western U. S. The discussion will be structured around these broad topics which encompass recent advances and expected needs: 1) genetics and phytochemistry; 2) management practices; 3) wildlife interactions and diversity; 4) measuring and monitoring cover change; and 5) adaptive approaches to disturbance and climate. Though groupings present a convenient structure for discussion, they should not be construed as exclusive of one another. The overlap of ecological and social elements elevates the need for strategic and adaptive systems thinking in this field. The Western Aspen Alliance provides a mechanism for facilitating communication among researchers and managers, as well as a center for interdisciplinary fusion...|$|E

40|$|Background & aims: Multiple {{definitions}} for malnutrition syndromes {{are found}} in the literature resulting in confusion. Recent evidence suggests that varying degrees of acute or chronic inflammation are key contributing factors in the pathophysiology of malnutrition that is associated with disease or injury. Methods: An International Guideline Committee was constituted to develop a consensus approach to defining malnutrition syndromes for adults in the clinical setting. Consensus was achieved through a series of meetings held at the ASPEN and ESPEN Congresses. Results: It was agreed that an etiology-based approach that incorporates a current understanding of inflammatory response would be most appropriate. The Committee proposes the following nomenclature for nutrition diagnosis in adults in the clinical practice setting. ""Starvation-related malnutrition"", when there is chronic starvation without inflammation, ""chronic disease-related malnutrition"", when inflammation is chronic and of mild to moderate degree, and ""acute disease or injury-related malnutrition"", when inflammation is acute and of severe degree. Conclusions: This commentary is intended to present a simple etiology-based construct for the diagnosis of adult malnutrition in the clinical setting. Development of associated laboratory, functional, food intake, and body weight criteria and their application to routine clinical practice will require validation.

40|$|Understanding tree {{physiological}} responses {{to climate change}} is critical for quantifying forest carbon, predicting species 2 ̆ 7 range change, and forecasting growth trajectories. Continued increases in temperature could push trees into conditions {{to which they are}} ill adapted [...] such as decreased depth of winter snow cover, altered water regimes, and a lengthened effective growing season. A complicating factor is that in the northeastern United States, climate change is occurring on a backdrop of acid deposition and land-use change. In this dissertation, I used three studies to investigate the spatiotemporal nuances of resultant tree and sapling physiology to environmental change. First, I compared annual growth of co-occurring tree species (sugar maple, red spruce, red maple, yellow birch, and balsam fir) along an elevational gradient on Vermont 2 ̆ 7 s tallest peak: Mt. Mansfield. I found baseline differences in growth among species, and many annual variations were associated with species-specific events. Yet, protracted growth patterns, such as recent increases for red spruce and red maple, were correlated with increased temperature and cooling degree days (a heat index). For most species, temperature was positively associated with current growth, but negatively associated with growth the following year. This work demonstrated species 2 ̆ 7 differences in response to change and the complex relationships between growth and temperature. Next, I analyzed how climate, environmental parameters, and site and tree factors related to recent, regional increases in red spruce growth. While there was variability in response to climate and acid deposition by elevation and location, site and tree factors did not adequately explain growth. Higher temperatures outside the traditional growing season were positively related to growth, while nitrogen deposition was strongly negative. However, if nitrogen inputs decline as projected then the strength of this relationship may decrease over time. These results suggest continued favorable conditions for red spruce in the near term as acid deposition declines and temperatures increase, provided precipitation remains adequate to support growth. Lastly, I used a replicated micro-catchment study to examine how four species of tree saplings (paper birch, quaking <b>aspen,</b> <b>American</b> chestnut and black cherry) responded to experimentally elevated temperature (2 - 4 C above control) and reduced early winter snow (first six weeks of winter), depending on soil type. Soil and species characteristics strongly influenced sapling response. However, natural weather patterns during the treatment period were highly variable and muted or exacerbated results. Heating increased the potential photosynthetic period in the fall, causing an overall increase in leaf area. Many two- and three-way interactions of treatment factors were also detected. These outcomes demonstrate the variability in sapling response to a changing climate, as well as the complex interactions that occur among soil, species, and weather parameters...|$|R
