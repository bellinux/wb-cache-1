Studies pertaining to generalizing symmetry preference to real-world versus abstract objects allow us to further examine the possible influence meaning may have on preference for a given stimuli.

The findings suggest that an overall preference for symmetric features of visual objects existed. Furthermore, <b>a</b> <b>main</b> <b>effect</b> <b>for</b> gender preference existed in the males that consistently indicated a preference for symmetry in both abstract and real objects.

Subjects who were offered no prize, termed low-drive, were told [...] "We are doing pilot work on various problems in order to decide {{which will be the}} best ones to use in an experiment we plan to do later. We would like to obtain norms on the time needed to solve." [...] The remaining subjects, termed high-drive, were told [...] "Depending on how quickly you solve the problem you can win $5.00 or $20.00. The top 25% of the Ss subjects in your group will win $5.00 each; the best will receive $20.00. Time to solve will be the criterion used." [...] (As a note, adjusting for inflation since 1962, the study's publish year, the amounts in 2015's dollars would be approximately $ and $, respectively.) The empty-boxes condition was found to be easier than the filled-boxes condition: more subjects solved the problem, and those who did solve the problem solved it faster. Within the filled-boxes condition, high-drive subjects performed worse than low-drive subjects. Glucksberg interpreted this result in terms of [...] "neobehavioristic drive theory": [...] "high drive prolongs extinction of the dominant habit and thus retards the correct habit from gaining ascendancy". An explanation in terms of the overjustification effect is made difficult by the lack of <b>a</b> <b>main</b> <b>effect</b> <b>for</b> drive and by a nonsignificant trend in the opposite direction within the empty-boxes condition.|$|E

The behavioral and electrophysiological investigations of the SEM contribute significantly to the understanding of attentive patterns presented of neurological and psychiatric disorders and sports performance. Objective: The current study aimed to investigate absolute alpha power changes in sensorimotor brain regions and the frontal eye fields during the execution of a saccadic task. Methods: Twelve healthy volunteers (mean age: 26. 25; SD: +/- 4. 13) performed a saccadic task while the electroencephalographic signal was simultaneously recorded for the cerebral cortex electrodes. The participants were instructed to follow the LEDs with their eyes, being submitted to two different task conditions: a fixed pattern versus a random pattern. Results: We found <b>a</b> moment <b>main</b> <b>effect</b> <b>for</b> the C 3, C 4, F 3 and F 4 electrodes and <b>a</b> condition <b>main</b> <b>effect</b> <b>for</b> the F 3 electrode.

40|$|ABSTRACT Individual and Combined Effects of Hyperthermia, Dehydration and Fatigue on Balance. Megan M. VanSumeren, University of Connecticut Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this controlled, {{randomized}} laboratory {{study was to determine}} the effect of hyperthermia, dehydration and fatigue as both combined and individual factors on balance performance as tested with three separate balance assessment tools. Methods: 12 healthy male subjects (20 ± 2 yrs old, 181. 83 ± 7. 53 cm, 74. 09 ± 8. 43 kg) completed four trials in a randomized order. The four trials were Normothermic, Hydrated (HyN), Normothermic Dehydrated (DehyN), Hyperthermic, Hydrated (HyHot), and Hyperthermic, Dehydrated (DehyHot). Balance was assessed using three tests; static stance, clinical tool Balance Error Scoring System (BESS), and a dynamic stance. Subjects performed the balance assessments three times during each trial; before exercise (pre-test), immediately after exercise (post-test) and after an hour of recovery (rec). The exercise component required subjects to walk on a 5 % incline treadmill for 90 minutes at a pre-determined speed between 3. 0 mph- 4. 0 mph. During the recovery period, subjects sat in the heat chamber with a water perfused suit on in order to maintain their exercising rectal temperature. Subjects were required to wear a 20. 45 kg pack during the entirety of the trial with the exception of the seated recovery period. Dependent variables were: center of pressure (COP), mean sway velocity, mean COP sway path, and average elliptical sway area for both the static and dynamic tests, as well as BESS individual stance scores and BESS total score. Separate repeated measures analyses of variance were performed to evaluate the dependent variables between time (pre-post-rec) and trials (HyN, DehyN, HyHot, DehyHot). Results: For the BESS test, <b>a</b> <b>main</b> <b>effect</b> <b>for</b> time was observed for three of the four stances; SLFirm (F(2, 22) = 5. 37, p=. 01), TanFirm (F(2, 22) = 4. 64, p=. 02), TanFoam (F(2, 22) = 3. 44, p=. 05). The post-test held the highest number of errors on any stance compared with the pre-test and the recovery test. Both the TanFirm and TanFoam revealed <b>a</b> <b>main</b> <b>effect</b> <b>for</b> condition (F(3, 33) = 3. 05, p=. 04, F(3, 33) = 7. 14, p=. 001, respectively). Overall, the DehyHot condition caused the highest BESS scores. For the Dynamic stance, <b>a</b> <b>main</b> <b>effect</b> <b>for</b> time was noticed for the variables of mean COP sway path and velocity (F(2, 22) = 7. 60, p=. 003, F(2, 22) = 7. 61, p=. 003, respectively) with the post-test resulting in the longest and fastest measures. All three variables demonstrated <b>a</b> <b>main</b> <b>effect</b> <b>for</b> condition; sway area (F(1. 93, 21. 26) = 3. 56, p=. 048), sway path (F(3. 33) = 3. 39, p=. 029), velocity (F(3, 33) = 3. 58, p=. 024). The DehyHot trial caused the biggest changes in postural sway. Static results revealed <b>a</b> <b>main</b> <b>effect</b> <b>for</b> time in sway path and sway velocity (F(2, 22) = 4. 03, p=. 032, F(91. 2, 13. 5) = 5. 56, p=. 045, respectively). Post-test scores caused the biggest change in sway. Conclusions: For all three of the balance assessments, there was a decrease in balance ability at post-test. The highest values on any balance assessment took place in the DehyHot trial, suggesting that when combined, dehydration and hyperthermia affect balance. Overall, balance deficits were driven mostly by fatigue in the dehydrated and hyperthermic condition...|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 35 - 43) The {{purpose of}} this investigation was to observe the influence of ankle joint angle and ground contact time (GCT) on jump height performance (JH). Eighteen male junior college football players performed depth jumps in four distinct jump conditions: dorsiflexed-fast (DFF), dorsiflexed-slow (DFS), plantarflexed-fast (PFF) and plantar-flexed-slow (PFS). The four jump conditions were evaluated against the dependent variables GCT, JH, reactive strength index (RSI), ankle angle at contact (AAC), peak ankle flexion angle (PAFA), ankle range (AR), knee angle at contact (KAC), peak knee flexion angle (PKFA), knee range (KR), hip angle at contact (HAC), peak hip flexion angle (PHFA), hip range (HR), initial GRF and peak GRF. The fast conditions showed significant <b>main</b> <b>effects</b> <b>for</b> decreased GCT, decreased joint range for the knee and hip, decreased peak flexion at all 3 joints, as well as increased initial and peak GRF (all p <. 05). Contrary to our hypotheses, the foot condition was not related to <b>a</b> significant <b>main</b> <b>effect</b> <b>for</b> GCT or JH. However, the foot condition did result in <b>a</b> significant <b>main</b> <b>effect</b> <b>for</b> ankle angle at contact, ankle range, initial GRF and peak GRF. Neither the foot nor the speed conditions displayed <b>a</b> significant <b>main</b> <b>effect</b> <b>for</b> jump height. The results indicate that depth jump GCT can be reduced without a significant corresponding decrease in jump height. A ground contact time of 0. 3 s may be the minimal GCT possible to elicit maximum jump height. However, depth jumps over 45 cm may elicit eccentric loads that are too great for subjects to achieve fast stretch-shorten cycles, less than 250 ms. Increased dorsiflexion of the ankle at ground contact does not significantly affect ground contact time or jump height, thus, it is not recommended at this time. Future research should revisit these four jump conditions at depth jump heights above and below 45 cm. Additionally, the longitudinal effects of depth jump training should be examined...|$|R

This study tested the effectiveness of an experimental instructional strategy for solving simple rate problems whose numbers are non-integral, such as decimals less than one. The experimental strategy consisted of building an intermediate problem representation {{in the form of a}} data table and using proportional reasoning to determine the multiplicative relationship existing between the terms of the unit ratio and use that relationship to find the missing quantity. This strategy was compared with the traditional strategy of solving a similar problem with simpler numbers. A secondary question of whether students taught the experimental strategy would be able to solve missing-value proportion problems of a general nature at a higher rate than students not taught the strategy was also addressed. Five intact seventh-grade classes participated in the study: three as the experimental group and two as the control group. The two instructional strategies were taught to the respective groups over a two and a half week period. Initial instruction avoided the use of unusual numerical characteristics. Instruction during the last three lessons used problems with unusual characteristics. An intermediate test after initial instruction to test for transfer of the strategies to solving problems with unusual characteristics, a posttest, and a missing-value proportion test were administered. Treatment, gender and general mathematics ability were the independent variables; test scores were the dependent variables. Factorial analysis of variance was performed on each test's results. <b>A</b> significant <b>main</b> <b>effect</b> <b>for</b> treatment in favor of the experimental strategy was found to exist on the intermediate test and posttest (p $<$. 001). <b>A</b> significant <b>main</b> <b>effect</b> <b>for</b> ability level also was observed on both tests. No significant gender <b>main</b> <b>effect</b> and no significant interaction occurred. Only <b>a</b> significant <b>main</b> <b>effect</b> <b>for</b> ability level occurred on the proportion test. Implications for use of the experimental strategy in other multiplicative situations and recommendations for further research are discussed...|$|R
