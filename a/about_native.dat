5|$|Although a few hagiographies, or saints' biographies, <b>about</b> <b>native</b> British saints survive {{from the}} period of the mission, none {{describes}} native Christians as active missionaries amongst the Anglo-Saxons. Most of the information about the British church at this time is concerned with the western regions of the island of Great Britain and does not deal with the Gregorian missionaries. Other sources of information include Bede's chronologies, the set of laws issued by Æthelberht in Kent, and the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, which was compiled in the late 9th century.|$|E
5|$|According to the New England Historical Genealogical Society, {{several members}} of Warren's {{maternal}} family claim Cherokee heritage; the Society found a family newsletter that alluded to a marriage license application that listed Elizabeth Warren’s great-great-great grandmother as a Cherokee, but {{could not find the}} primary document and found no proof of Warren's Native American heritage. The Oklahoma Historical Society stated that finding a definitive answer <b>about</b> <b>Native</b> American heritage can be difficult because of intermarriage and deliberate avoidance of registration. Some members of the Cherokee Nation protested her claim to Native American ancestry and questioned whether she benefitted from it. Former colleagues and supervisors at the universities where she had worked (including Charles Fried, former Solicitor General under President Ronald Reagan) said Warren's ancestry was either not mentioned, or played no role in her hiring.|$|E
5|$|As of 2006, South Dakota has a total {{primary and}} {{secondary}} school enrollment of 136,872, with 120,278 of these students being educated {{in the public school}} system. There are 703 public schools in 168 school districts, giving South Dakota the highest number of schools per capita in the United States. The current high school graduation rate is 89.9%, and the average ACT score is 21.8, slightly above the national average of 21.1. 89.8% of the adult population has earned at least a high school diploma, and 25.8% has earned a bachelor's degree or higher. South Dakota's 2008 average public school teacher salary of $36,674, compared to a national average of $52,308, was the lowest in the nation. In 2007 South Dakota passed legislation modeled after Montana's Indian Education for All Act (1999), mandating education <b>about</b> <b>Native</b> American tribal history, culture, and heritage in all the schools, from pre-school through college, in an effort to increase knowledge and appreciation about Indian culture among all residents of the state, as well as to reinforce Indian students' understanding of their own cultures' contributions.|$|E

5|$|There is {{relatively}} little information <b>about</b> <b>native</b> Scottish artists {{during the late}} Middle Ages. As in England, the monarchy may have had model portraits used for copies and reproductions, but the versions that survive are generally crude by continental standards. Much more impressive are the works or artists imported from the continent, particularly the Netherlands, generally considered the centre of painting in the Northern Renaissance. The products of these connections included the delicate hanging lamp in St. John's Kirk in Perth; the tabernacles and images of St Catherine and St John brought to Dunkeld, and vestments and hangings in Holyrood; Hugo van Der Goes's altarpiece for the Trinity College Church in Edinburgh, commissioned by James III, the work after which the Flemish Master of James IV of Scotland is named, and the illustrated Flemish Bening Book of Hours, given by James IV to Margaret Tudor.|$|E

50|$|This story's {{main purpose}} is sharing the truth through tedious journalism and research. It is an {{important}} publication in Native literature in that it shares a story <b>about</b> <b>Natives</b> by a Native author.

500|$|Chicago {{businessman}} Michael Butler {{was planning}} {{to run for the}} U.S. Senate on an anti-war platform. [...] After seeing an ad for Hair in The New York Times that led him to believe the show was <b>about</b> <b>Native</b> Americans, he watched the Public's production several times and joined forces with Joe Papp to reproduce the show at another New York venue after the close of its run at the Public. [...] Papp and Butler first moved the show to The Cheetah, a discothèque at 53rd Street and Broadway. [...] It opened there on December 22, 1967 and ran for 45 performances. [...] There was no nudity in either the Public Theater or Cheetah production.|$|E
500|$|Whorf studied Biblical {{linguistics}} mainly at the Watkinson Library (now Hartford Public Library). This library had {{an extensive}} collection of materials <b>about</b> <b>Native</b> American linguistics and folklore, originally collected by James Hammond Trumbull. It {{was at the}} Watkinson library that Whorf became friends with the young boy, John B. Carroll, who later went on to study psychology under B. F. Skinner, and who in 1956 edited and published a selection of Whorf's essays as Language, Thought and Reality [...] The collection rekindled Whorf's interest in Mesoamerican antiquity. He began studying the Nahuatl language in 1925, and later, beginning in 1928, he studied the collections of Maya hieroglyphic texts. Quickly becoming conversant with the materials, he began a scholarly dialog with Mesoamericanists such as Alfred Tozzer, the Maya archaeologist at Harvard University, and Herbert J. Spinden of the Brooklyn Museum.|$|E
500|$|Hergé {{attempted}} greater {{research into}} the United States than he had done for the Belgian Congo or Soviet Union. [...] To learn more <b>about</b> <b>Native</b> Americans, Hergé read Paul Coze and René Thévenin's 1928 book [...] ("Customs and History of the Redskin Indians") and visited Brussels' ethnographic museum. As a result, his depiction of the Blackfoot Native Americans was [...] "essentially accurate", with artefacts such as tipis and traditional costume copied from photographs. To learn about Chicago and its gangsters, he read Georges Duhamel's 1930 book [...] ("Scenes from Future Life"). Written {{in the context of}} the Wall Street Crash of 1929, Duhamel's work contained strong anti-consumerist and anti-modernist sentiment, criticising the U.S.'s increased mechanisation and standardisation from a background of European conservatism; this would have resonated with both Wallez and Hergé's viewpoints. Many elements of Tintin in America, such as the abattoir scene, were adopted from Duhamel's descriptions.|$|E

500|$|In 2005, the American Psychological Association (APA) {{issued a}} {{resolution}} [...] "Recommending the Immediate Retirement of American Indian Mascots, Symbols, Images, and Personalities by Schools, Colleges, Universities, Athletic Teams, and Organizations" [...] {{due to the}} harm done by creating a hostile environment, the {{negative impact on the}} self-esteem of American Indian children, and discrimination that may violate civil rights. It also impacts non-natives by reinforcing mainstream stereotypes, preventing learning <b>about</b> <b>Native</b> American culture. The APA states that stereotyping is disrespectful of the beliefs, traditions and values of Native Americans. Similar resolutions have been adopted by the North American Society for the Sociology of Sport, the American Sociological Association, the American Counseling Association, and the American Anthropological Association. In a 2005 report on the status of Native American students, the National Education Association included the elimination of Indian mascots and sports team names as one of its recommendations.|$|E
500|$|Castle Lake {{was within}} the range of the Okwanuchu tribe, {{one of a number of}} small Shastan-speaking tribes of Native Americans who were closely related to the {{adjacent}} larger Shasta tribe. [...] The Okwanuchu occupied territory near Mount Shasta, including the nearby present-day cities of Mount Shasta and Dunsmuir, California, and the upper Sacramento River canyon (among other areas). The Okwanuchu were speakers of the older Hokan-speaking family of languages, with archaeological sites associated with their range dating back more than 5000 years. However, members of a tribe of the Penutian-speaking family of languages, the Wintu, who arrived in central Northern California about 1200 years ago, were out-competing their Hokan-language family neighbors, and were expanding Wintu territory. [...] It is unclear at the time of first contact with non-Native Americans in the 1820s which tribe was living nearest to Castle Lake. Little or no information is available <b>about</b> <b>Native</b> American use or beliefs regarding Castle Lake; for example, Castle Lake is not mentioned in a published collection of Wintu tales and legends.|$|E

Man Bites Town, published in 1993, is a collection of columns that he wrote for The Los Angeles Times between 1989 and 1992. Published in 1999, It's the Stupidity, Stupid analyzed the hatred some people had for then-President Bill Clinton. Shearer believes that Clinton became disliked because he had an affair with [...] "the least powerful, least credentialed women cleared into his official compound." [...] His most recent book is Not Enough Indians, his first novel. Published in 2006, it is a comic novel <b>about</b> <b>Native</b> Americans and gambling.
