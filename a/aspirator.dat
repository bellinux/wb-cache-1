25|$|The double trap siphonic toilet is a {{less common}} type that is {{exceptionally}} quiet when flushed. There is a device known as an <b>aspirator</b> which uses {{the flow of water}} on a flush to suck air from the cavity between the two traps, reducing the air pressure there to create the siphon which sucks water and waste from the toilet bowl. Towards the end of the flush the <b>aspirator</b> ceases being covered in water, thus allowing air into the cavity between traps to break the siphon without the noise while the final flush water fills the pan.|$|E
25|$|On 14 October 2010, {{engineers}} at {{the launch pad}} first discovered a small leak in a propellant line for Discoverys orbital maneuvering system (OMS) engines. The leak was detected after they noticed a fishy smell coming from the aft of the shuttle, {{thought of as a}} sign of fuel vapor in the air. Upon inspection, the leak was found at a flange located at the interface where two propellant lines met in Discoverys aft compartment. The line carried monomethyl hydrazine (MMH) propellant, one of two chemicals (the other is an oxidizer, nitrogen tetroxide) used to ignite the OMS engines. Engineers replaced an Air Half Coupling (AHC) flight cap. However, the new cap failed to solve the problem since vapor checks still showed signs of a leak. An <b>aspirator</b> was activated to collect the vapor at the leak-site allowing work to continue in other locations around the aft segment of Discovery.|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to determine whether significant differences in saturation levels existed among patients with aspiration and patients without and wether pulse oximetry can reliably detect aspiration in patients with dysphagia. We also examined the effects of gender and disease (neurologic versus non neurologic) on saturation levels. We studied 38 patients. They all underwent a videofluoroscopic study of swallowing (VFSS). Twenty patients aspirated on videofluoroscopic study of swallowing: ten patients were solid <b>aspirators,</b> ten patients were liquid <b>aspirators.</b> In each group (liquid <b>aspirators,</b> solid <b>aspirators</b> or non <b>aspirators)</b> we found no significant difference in saturation levels. We found however a significant difference in saturation levels between each group before, during and after videofluoroscopic study of swallowing. Both gender and disease had an effect on saturation levels. We conclude that pulse oximetry can not serve as a screening tool for detection of aspiration as saturation levels are dependent on many factors. Therefore one can not reliably predict aspiration with a single saturation screening. status: publishe...|$|R

500|$|When {{ambulance}} {{crew members}} Reg Jones and John Saua {{arrived at the}} Samarkand, {{the door to the}} flat was wide open, the gas fire was on, the curtains were drawn, and the apartment was dark. The crew called out several times, but after receiving no response, they entered and found Hendrix alone in bed. Dannemann was nowhere to be found. According to Jones: [...] "Well, we had to get the police, we only had [...] and an empty flat, so John ran up and radioed, and got the <b>aspirator...</b> It was horrific. He was covered in vomit. There was tons of it all over the pillowâ€”black and brown it was. His airway was completely blocked all the way down... We felt his pulse... showed a light in his eyes. But there was no response at all." [...] At 11:30a.m., police officers Ian Smith and Tom Keene responded to a call for police assistance from the ambulance control centre. Jones commented: [...] "Once the police arrived, which seemed like no time at all, we got [...] off to hospital as quick as we could." ...|$|E
500|$|Although Dannemann {{stated that}} Hendrix was alive when {{placed in the}} {{ambulance}} at approximately 11:30a.m. and that she rode {{with him on the}} way to the hospital, the ambulance crew later denied she was there. Statements from the paramedics who responded to the call support that they found Hendrix alone in the flat when they arrived at 11:27a.m., fully clothed and apparently already dead. Jones later commented: [...] " [...] we arrived at the flat, the door was flung wide open, nobody about, just the body on the bed." [...] Saua stated: [...] "There was just me and the casualty and Reg the driver. Nobody else." [...] Burdon stated: [...] " [...] didn't leave in the ambulance; she was with me". According to Jones, Hendrix's bowels and bladder had released some of their contents prior to the ambulance crew's arrival at the Samarkand. Saua stated that the vomit was dry when they arrived, making use of their <b>aspirator</b> ineffective. Saua commented: [...] "When we moved , the gases were gurgling, you get that when someone has died". According to police officer Smith: [...] "The ambulance men were there, but Jimi was dead... There was really nothing they could do for him." [...] Smith also disputes Dannemann's claim that she was there with Hendrix at the flat and in the ambulance: No, I remember quite clearly the doors shutting on the crew and Jimi... there was no one about. If she had been in the flat, they would never have called us to come... But because no one was there, he was dead, and circumstances were a little odd, suspicious, they radioed... us in. It wasn't until later in the day that I found out that it was Jimi Hendrix. In 1992, after having conducted an extensive review of the events of September 18, 1970, the London Ambulance Service issued an official statement: [...] "There was no one else, except the deceased, at the flat when they arrived; nor did anyone else accompany them in the ambulance to St. Mary Abbotts Hospital." ...|$|E

6000|$|But that is {{a scheme}} too {{comprehensive}} and rational for the ordinary student of the London traffic problem, whose mind runs {{for the most part}} on costly and devastating rearrangements of the existing roadways. Moreover, it would probably secure a maximum of effect with a minimum of property manipulation; always an undesirable consideration in practical politics. And it would commit London and England to goods transit by railway for another century. Far more attractive to the expert advisers of our various municipal authorities are such projects as a new Thames bridge scheme, which will (with incalculable results) inject a new stream of traffic into Saint Paul's Churchyard; and the removal of Charing Cross Station to {{the south side of the}} river. Then, again, we have the systematic widening of various thoroughfares, the shunting of tramways into traffic streams, and many amusing, expensive, and interesting tunnellings and clearances. Taken together, these huge reconstructions of London are incoherent and conflicting; each is based on its own assumptions and separate [...] "expert" [...] advice, and the resulting new opening plays its part in the general circulation as duct or <b>aspirator,</b> often with the most surprising results. The discussion of the London traffic problem as we practise it in our clubs is essentially the sage turning over and over again of such fragmentary schemes, headshakings over the vacant sites about Aldwych and the Strand, brilliant petty suggestions and--dispersal. Meanwhile the experts intrigue; one partial plan after another gets itself accepted, this and that ancient landmark perish, builders grow rich, and architects infamous, and some Tower Bridge horror, some vulgarity of the Automobile Club type, some Buckingham Palace atrocity, some Regent Street stupidity, some such cramped and thwarted thing as that new arch which gives upon Charing Cross is added to the confusion. I do not see any reason to suppose that this continuous muddle of partial destruction and partial rebuilding is not to constitute the future history of London.|$|E
6000|$|But {{not content}} with {{explaining}} the experiments of others, M. Pasteur went to work to satisfy himself completely. He said to himself: [...] "If my view is right, and if, in point of fact, all these appearances of spontaneous generation are altogether due to the falling of minute germs suspended in the atmosphere,--why, I ought not only {{to be able to}} show the germs, but I {{ought to be able to}} catch and sow them, and produce the resulting organisms." [...] He, accordingly, constructed a very ingenious apparatus to enable him to accomplish the trapping of the [...] "germ dust" [...] in the air. He fixed in the window of his room a glass tube, in the centre of which he had placed a ball of gun-cotton, which, as you all know, is ordinary cotton-wool, which, from having been steeped in strong acid, is converted into a substance of great explosive power. It is also soluble in alcohol and ether. One end of the glass tube was, of course, open to the external air; and at the other end of it he placed an <b>aspirator,</b> a contrivance for causing a current of the external air to pass through the tube. He kept this apparatus going for four-and-twenty hours, and then removed the dusted gun-cotton, and dissolved it in alcohol and ether. He then allowed this to stand for a few hours, and the result was, that a very fine dust was gradually deposited at the bottom of it. That dust, on being transferred to the stage of a microscope, was found to contain an enormous number of starch grains. You know that the materials of our food and the greater portion of plants are composed of starch, and we are constantly making use of it in a variety of ways, so that there is always a quantity of it suspended in the air. It is these starch grains which form many of those bright specks that we see dancing in a ray of light sometimes. But besides these, M. Pasteur found also an immense number of other organic substances such as spores of fungi, which had been floating about in the air and had got caged in this way.|$|E

50|$|Air {{injection}} {{can also}} be achieved {{by taking advantage of}} the negative pressure pulses in the exhaust system at engine idle. A sensitive reed valve assembly called the <b>aspirator</b> valve is placed in the air injection pumping, which draws its air directly from the clean side of the air filter. During engine idle, brief but periodic negative pressure pulses in the exhaust system draw air through the <b>aspirator</b> valve and into the exhaust stream at the catalytic converter. This system, marketed as Pulse Air, was used by American Motors, Chrysler, and other manufacturers beginning in the 1970s. The <b>aspirator</b> provided advantages in cost, weight, packaging, and simplicity compared to the pump, but the <b>aspirator</b> functions only at idle and so admits significantly less air within a significantly narrower range of engine speeds compared to a pump. This system is still used on modern motorcycle engines, e.g. the Yamaha AIS (Air Injection System).|$|E

5000|$|In {{the most}} common case, a gas stream, e.g., air, applies the heat by {{convection}} and carries away the vapor as humidity. Other possibilities are vacuum drying, where heat is supplied by conduction or radiation (or microwaves), while the vapor thus produced is removed by the vacuum system. Another indirect technique is drum drying (used, for instance, for manufacturing potato flakes), where a heated surface is used to provide the energy, and <b>aspirators</b> draw the vapor outside the room. In contrast, the mechanical extraction of the solvent, e.g., water, by centrifugation, is not considered [...] "drying" [...] but rather [...] "draining".|$|R
50|$|The ejector venturi {{is unique}} among {{available}} scrubbing systems since it {{can move the}} process gas {{without the aid of}} a fan or blower.

50|$|Because {{of the way}} {{the water}} is applied in a drip system, {{traditional}} surface applications of timed-release fertilizer are sometimes ineffective, so drip systems often mix liquid fertilizer with the irrigation water.

Fertilizer savings of up to 95% are being reported from recent university field tests using drip fertigation and slow water delivery as compared to timed-release and irrigation by micro spray heads.|$|R
