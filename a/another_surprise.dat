5|$|Prior to {{initiating}} a march on Fort Detroit, Clark used his own resources and borrowed from {{his friends to}} continue his campaign after the initial appropriation had been depleted from the Virginia legislature. He re-enlisted some of his troops and recruited additional men to join him. Hamilton waited for spring to begin a campaign to retake the forts at Kaskaskia and Cahokia, but Clark planned <b>another</b> <b>surprise</b> attack on Fork Sackville at Vincennes. He left Kaskaskia on February 6, 1779 with about 170 men, beginning an arduous overland trek, encountering melting snow, ice, and cold rain along the journey. They arrived at Vincennes on February 23 and launched a surprise attack on Fort Sackville. Hamilton surrendered the garrison on February 25 and was captured in the process. The winter expedition was Clark's most significant military achievement and became {{the basis of his}} reputation as an early American military hero.|$|E
5|$|When {{the second}} assault began, the Turks {{tried to break}} through the gate with their lances. After heavy casualties, the attackers retreated and Murad held for the next two days a council of all his generals. An {{immediate}} precaution was to guard the camp against <b>another</b> <b>surprise</b> attack, which was responded to by placing a force of men, under the command of Prince Mehmed, where the first attack had taken place. Moisi Arianit Golemi feigned an attack with about 500 horsemen: the alarm was given and the Turks prepared for his attack. Meanwhile, Skanderbeg and his forces moved around the camp and broke in where least expected. Before an organized counterattack could be made, Skanderbeg retreated from the camp. The attacks made by Skanderbeg caused the Turks to aim some of their cannons towards the expected guerrilla forces, instead of the fortress. A large force of Turkish cavalry was sent out, which Skanderbeg followed up to the mouth of the Ishëm River, until they turned back to Krujë.|$|E
5|$|The elected 10th Central Committee {{comprised}} 81 (52.5 percent) {{members from}} the 9th Central Committee, and 79 (47.5 percent) new members were elected. The candidate with the highest vote received 97.88 percent, while the candidate with the lowest vote received 63.41 percent. All the provinces, {{with the exception of}} Đắk Nông Province, elected officials to the 10th Central Committee. A number of surprises occurred during the election process; six ministers were not re-elected. <b>Another</b> <b>surprise</b> was that no officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs were elected as full members. However, Phạm Bình Minh, the Director of the International Organizations Directorate of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, was elected as an alternate member. None of the 34 self-nominated candidates at the congress were elected to the 10th Central Committee. It is unknown whether any of the self-nominees for alternate membership in the 10th Central Committee were elected. There was an increase in Central Committee officials working in the central government, the provinces, military and defence officials, public security officials and officials from mass organizations, but there was a decrease in officials from the sectors of information, social and cultural affairs, economics, business and financial affairs, and others.|$|E
5000|$|A similar {{phrase in}} Spanish, ¿Por qué no te callas? ("Why don't you shut up?"), was said by King Juan Carlos I of Spain to Venezuelan {{president}} Hugo Chávez, {{in response to}} repeated interruptions by Chávez at a 2007 diplomatic conference. The blunt comment from one head of state to <b>another</b> <b>surprised</b> many, and received [...] "general applause" [...] from the audience.|$|R

On October 11, 2009, he gave two surprise concerts at the Grand Palais. On October 12, he gave <b>another</b> <b>surprise</b> performance at La Cigale. On October 24, Prince played a concert at Paisley Park.|$|E
25|$|In 1077 Roger besieged Trapani, {{one of the}} two {{remaining}} Saracen strongholds in the west of the island. His son, Jordan, led a sortie which surprised guards of the garrison's livestock. With its food supply cut off, the city soon surrendered. In 1079 Taormina was besieged, and in 1081 Jordan, Robert de Sourval and Elias Cartomi conquered Catania (a holding of the emir of Syracuse) in <b>another</b> <b>surprise</b> attack.|$|E
25|$|The {{race was}} {{expected}} to be a duel between LaVerne Jones-Ferrette and Carmelita Jeter who had run some of the fastest times for many seasons at 6.97 and 7.02seconds, respectively. In the first round of competition Myriam Soumaré was the surprise winner of the first heat, Jones-Ferrette clocked the fastest of the day in her heat with 7.14seconds, while Veronica Campbell-Brown and Jeter topped their qualifiers comfortably. Ruddy Zang Milama of Gabon was <b>another</b> <b>surprise</b> in the final heat as she beat the more experienced Sheri-Ann Brooks and Mikele Barber.|$|E

60|$|He sat {{up with a}} groan, {{which was}} {{answered}} by an oath from the man into whose sides he had dug his flying feet. The two looked at one <b>another</b> in <b>surprise,</b> tempered with anger in the one and dismay in the other.|$|R
60|$|Hardly had he {{traveled}} a mile when Brandt's footprints covered <b>another's.</b> Nothing <b>surprised</b> the borderman; {{but he had}} expected this least of all. A hasty examination convinced him that Legget and his Indian ally had fled this way with Wetzel in pursuit.|$|R
25|$|The dirty Hungaroring near Budapest {{provided}} an almost gripless practice and qualifying, that {{eventually led to}} the first non-McLaren pole position of the year – Riccardo Patrese made a Senna-like performance with a 0.31 gap between him and Senna. <b>Another</b> <b>surprise</b> was the equally impressive Alex Caffi, who scored third with a time less than a second slower than that of Patrese – in a car that had been notoriously midfield. The Ferraris, however, suffered badly. Mansell was over two seconds off Patrese's time of an impressive 1:19.7, whilst Berger constantly complained of gear shift troubles – even asking the team to change the gearbox pre-race, which they didn't.|$|E
25|$|By 1982, the Black Hawks squeaked {{into the}} playoffs as the fourth seed in the Norris Division (at the time the top four teams in each {{division}} automatically made the playoffs), and {{were one of the}} league's Cinderella teams that year. Led by second-year Denis Savard's 32 goals and 119 points and Doug Wilson's 39 goals, the Hawks stunned the Minnesota North Stars and Blues in the playoffs before losing to <b>another</b> <b>surprise</b> team, the Vancouver Canucks, who made the Stanley Cup Finals. Chicago proved they were no fluke the next season, also making the third round before losing to the eventual runner-up Edmonton Oilers. After an off-year in 1984, the Hawks again faced a now fresh-off-a-ring Edmonton offensive juggernaut of a team and lost in the third round in 1985.|$|E
25|$|More {{surprising}} was {{the analysis}} of the rat-poison paste; {{it turned out to be}} nothing more than a mixture of flour, water and soda. This led to the possibility that Marie used the real arsenic to murder her husband. Any remaining doubts that may have lingered vanished when Emma Pontier turned over the small malachite box, and Dr. Lespinasse found it to contain arsenic. Marie was arrested and held in jail in Brive. A young French lawyer, Charles Lachaud, was appointed to her defence and was assisted by three others, Maîtres Théodore Bac (who later became mayor of Limoges during the 1848 Revolution), Paillet, and Desmont. Before they began their work, there was <b>another</b> <b>surprise</b> in store. The newspaper stories regarding Marie Lafarge turned up something from her past.|$|E
60|$|The {{children}} {{looked at}} one <b>another</b> in <b>surprise,</b> for they had forgotten all about the bread. And then one of them confessed, and told her {{the whole story of}} how they had frightened the baker-man for saying he would send them to the poor-house.|$|R

25|$|The Twenty20 International on 13 June saw England score 179 for 8, a total {{probably}} 20 {{above the}} par score at the Rose Bowl. The Australian innings {{was a dream}} for Darren Gough (3 wickets), Jon Lewis (4 wickets) and all Englishmen as the Aussies were reduced to 31 for 7. Ultimately they were dismissed for 79 – first blood to England by 100 runs. Lord's hosted a 50-over match between the next day {{as part of the}} World Cricket Tsunami Appeal to raise funds to help countries hit by the Indian Ocean tsunami of 26 December. An MCC side including Shaun Pollock, Sourav Ganguly and Stephen Fleming beat an International XI that included Brian Lara, Rahul Dravid, Shane Warne and Graeme Smith by 112 runs. Then on 15 June came <b>another</b> <b>surprise</b> – Australia were beaten in their final NatWest Series warm-up match by Somerset, or more specifically Graeme Smith and Sanath Jayasuriya, who put on 197 for Somerset's first wicket.|$|E
25|$|Australia {{had several}} series wins {{behind them and}} the {{selectors}} Sam Loxton, Neil Harvey and Phil Ridings picked the regulars; the batsmen Ian Chappell, Greg Chappell (despite recovering from influenza), Ian Redpath and Doug Walters, wicketkeeper Rod Marsh, fast bowler Max Walker and leg-spinner Kerry O'Keeffe. The fast bowler Dennis Lillee had demonstrated his fitness after his crippling back injury of 1973 and was brought back into the team along with the surprise choice of Jeff Thomson, an inaccurate fast bowler with a slinging, javelin throw action. His sheer pace would be the deciding factor in the series, though many pundits thought the left-arm Geoff Dymock {{would have been the}} better bet. The leg-spinner Terry Jenner was <b>another</b> <b>surprise</b> as Brisbane was not conductive to spin, but in the end the regular spinner Kerry O'Keeffe was made twelfth man and Jenner played in his stead. Wally Edwards and Ross Edwards were brought over from Western Australia. Wally was an angular opening batsman in the style of Bill Lawry and Ross had made his name by scoring 170 not out at Trent Bridge in the 1972 Ashes series.|$|E
25|$|The Redskins' {{fortunes}} {{continued to}} slide in 2009, as they lost {{two of the}} first four matches, {{one of which was}} a 19-14 defeat {{at the hands of the}} Lions, a team that had not won a game since December 2007. After that, they lost to Carolina on the road and Kansas City at home, the latter match handing another victory to a winless team. On Monday Night Football, the Redskins lost to Philadelphia in a game where Jim Zorn was temporarily relieved of his duties by offensive coordinator Sherman Lewis. In Week 10, they inflicted a surprise defeat on the Denver Broncos before losing two divisional matches to Dallas and Philadelphia. The Week 13 game against an undefeated Saints team proved <b>another</b> <b>surprise.</b> The Redskins managed to tie at the end of regulation, and in overtime had a chance to break New Orleans' winning streak. However, kicker Shaun Suisham missed a field goal that would have given them the victory. On their next possession, the Saints scored a FG and won the game 33-30. Suisham was cut after the game and signed with Dallas (his original team). The Redskins then routed Oakland in Week 14 before losing their last three games to finish 4-12. The second match with the Cowboys ended in a 16-0 shutout, making for only the second season since 1970 where Washington lost all of its divisional matches. Jim Zorn was fired and replaced by Mike Shanahan afterwards.|$|E

40|$|Most {{reviews of}} my recent biography, Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling, mention that I am a {{practicing}} Mormon. The Sunday New York Times titled its review, 2 ̆ 2 Latter-Day Saint: A practicing Mormon delivers a balanced {{biography of the}} church’s founder, Joseph Smith. 2 ̆ 2 Perhaps a little oversensitive, I wondered why this was news. Was a Mormon {{telling the story of}} the church’s founding prophet with a degree of objectivity something like man bites dog? Did the editor mean that a mind capable of embracing Mormonism would surely be incapable of a balanced portrayal? Or that Mormonism evokes loyalties so deep that a dispassionate approach to Joseph Smith would be impossible for a church member? One reviewer spoke of my walking a high wire between the demands of church conformity and the necessary openness of scholarly investigation. <b>Another,</b> <b>surprised</b> by the balance of the book but unwilling to trust me entirely, said it achieved a 2 ̆ 2 veneer of credibility. 2 ̆...|$|R
500|$|England {{experienced}} <b>another</b> <b>surprise</b> upset under Winterbottom's {{guidance in}} 1953 when Hungary defeated England 6–3 at Wembley Stadium. [...] Winterbottom said afterwards, [...] "...The press tended {{to think we}} would win easily, but I tried {{to point out that}} the Hungarians were actually a great side." [...] He guided England to first place in the 1954 British Home Championship, which qualified the team for the 1954 World Cup in Switzerland, but saw his side knocked out in the quarter-finals, going down 4–2 against Uruguay. Four wins from four matches enabled England's qualification for the 1958 World Cup only for Winterbottom's side to fail in the group play-off stage, losing 1–0 to USSR. [...] England lost to Brazil in the quarter-final of the 1962 World Cup in Chile and, under attack from the British press, Winterbottom resigned five months later. [...] He remains the longest serving manager of England.|$|E
500|$|As the 111th Congress began, Kennedy {{dropped his}} {{spot on the}} Senate Judiciary Committee to focus all his attentions on health care issues, which he {{regarded}} as [...] "the cause of my life". [...] He saw {{the characteristics of the}} Obama administration and the Democratic majorities in Congress as representing the third and best great chance for universal health care, following the lost 1971 Nixon and 1993 Clinton opportunities, and as his last big legislative battle. Kennedy made <b>another</b> <b>surprise</b> appearance in the Senate to break a Republican filibuster against the Obama stimulus package. As spring arrived, Kennedy appeared on Capitol Hill more frequently, although staffers often did not announce his attendance at committee meetings until they were sure Kennedy was well enough to appear. On March 4, 2009, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Gordon Brown announced that Kennedy had been granted an honorary knighthood by Queen Elizabeth II for his work in the Northern Ireland peace process, and for his contribution to UK–US relations, although the move caused some controversy in the UK due to his connections with Gerry Adams of the Irish republican political party Sinn Féin. Later in March, a bill reauthorizing and expanding the AmeriCorps program was renamed the Edward M. Kennedy Serve America Act by Senator Hatch in Kennedy's honor. Kennedy threw the ceremonial first pitch at Fenway Park before the Boston Red Sox season opener in April, echoing what his grandfather [...] "Honey Fitz"– a member of the Royal Rooters– had done to open the park in 1912. Even when his illness prevented him from being a major factor in health plan deliberations, his symbolic presence still {{made him one of the}} key senators involved.|$|E
2500|$|In Spain and in Portugal (where it {{is called}} Bolo-rei), the cake, which is ring-shaped, is most {{commonly}} bought, not baked, and it contains both a small figurine {{of one of the}} Magi (or <b>another</b> <b>surprise</b> depending on the region) and an actual dry broad bean. The one who gets the figurine is [...] "crowned" [...] (with a crown made of cardboard or paper), but whoever gets the bean has to pay the value of the cake to the person who originally bought it. In Mexico they also have the same ring-shaped cake Rosca de Reyes (Kings Bagel or Thread) with figurines inside it. Whoever gets a figurine is supposed to organize and be the host of the family celebration for the Candelaria feast on February 2.|$|E
6000|$|Entering {{the castle}} of Ellangowan by a postern doorway which showed {{symptoms}} {{of having been}} once secured with the most jealous care, Brown (whom, since he has set foot upon the property of his fathers, we shall hereafter call by his father's name of Bertram) wandered from one ruined apartment to <b>another,</b> <b>surprised</b> at the massive strength of {{some parts of the}} building, the rude and impressive magnificence of others, and the great extent of the whole. In two of these rooms, close beside each other, he saw signs of recent habitation. In one small apartment were empty bottles, half-gnawed bones, and dried fragments of bread. In the vault which adjoined, and which was defended by a strong door, then left open, he observed a considerable quantity of straw, and in both were the relics of recent fires. How little was it possible for Bertram to conceive that such trivial circumstances were closely connected with incidents affecting his prosperity, his honour, perhaps his life! ...|$|R

Together with Kendra, Alan manages to learn much more about Sam, and within the span of a few hours the treasure huntress has completely outclassed all of the detectives earlier hired by Mr. Zhao. They're flying above the Chinese harbor when Kendra notes that they've reached the point where there {{was supposed to be a}} clue, as one of the containers contain something which is connected to Sam's death. Once they open the container however, Alan and Kendra discover to their shock numerous dead Parademons heaped atop one <b>another.</b> <b>Surprised</b> by their findings and wondering how this got Sam killed, they decide to backtrack to their previous source, the mob leader Eddie Kai Lung.|$|R
2500|$|When {{operations}} ceased at the Pearl Brewery in 2001, {{many thought}} it would be the end for the brewery's buildings. [...] The brewery's proximity to the core of downtown San Antonio and the easy access to several highways led many to believe it would be a prime target to be razed and replaced. [...] However, these two attributes, along with <b>another</b> <b>surprise</b> development, actually saved the brewery facilities and helped to ensure its architecture would survive. [...] San Antonio has begun work to expand the River Walk north to where the river meets U.S. Route 281. [...] The Pearl Brewery is close to [...] a section of the river expansion, thus making it an attractive location and eligible for incentives by the city to assist business development.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are some}} obvious {{omissions}} from this list, notably {{a number of}} dioceses {{in the province of}} Mosul, but it is probably legitimate to conclude that all the dioceses mentioned in the list were still in existence {{in the last quarter of}} the 12th century. [...] If so, the list has some interesting surprises, such as the survival of dioceses for Fars and Kirman and for Najran at this late date. [...] The mention of the diocese of Kfar Zamre near Balad, attested only once before, in 790, is <b>another</b> <b>surprise,</b> as is the mention of a diocese for Pushtadar in Persia. [...] However, there is no need to doubt the authenticity of the list. [...] Its mention of dioceses for Nevaketh and the Islands of the Sea have a convincing topicality.|$|E
2500|$|As {{military}} defeats {{and growing}} casualties made the war {{more and more}} unpopular in Russia, and as the 1996 presidential elections neared, Yeltsin's government sought {{a way out of}} the conflict. Although a Russian guided missile attack assassinated the ChRI President Dzhokhar Dudayev on 21 April 1996, the separatists persisted. Yeltsin even officially declared [...] "victory" [...] in Grozny on 28 May 1996, after a new temporary ceasefire was signed with the ChRI Acting President Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev. While the political leaders were discussing the ceasefire and peace negotiations, military forces continued to conduct combat operations. On 6 August 1996, three days before Yeltsin was to be inaugurated for his second term as Russian president and when most of the Russian Army troops were moved south due to what was planned as their final offensive against remaining mountainous separatist strongholds, the Chechens launched <b>another</b> <b>surprise</b> attack on Grozny.|$|E
