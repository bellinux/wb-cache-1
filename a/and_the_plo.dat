5|$|In September 1993, {{leaders of}} Israel <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>PLO</b> signed the Oslo Accords calling for Palestinian {{administration}} of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank town of Jericho, which was implemented in May 1994. Israeli forces withdrew from Gaza, leaving a new Palestinian National Authority (PNA) to administer and police the city. Led by Yasser Arafat, the PNA chose Gaza as its first provincial headquarters. The newly established Palestinian National Council held its inaugural session in Gaza in March 1996.|$|E
5|$|The Intifada {{began as}} an {{uprising}} of Palestinian youth against the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. On June 7, 1986, about {{a year before the}} Intifada started, al-Wazir was deported from Amman to Baghdad, eventually moving to Tunisia days after King Hussein declared that efforts in establishing a joint strategy for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict between Jordan <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>PLO</b> were over.|$|E

50|$|The Venice Declaration (also {{known as}} the Declaration of the Venice Summit) was an {{agreement}} issued by the nine-member economic committee of the EEC, which met in June 1980 in conjunction with Palestinian Liberation Organization (<b>PLO).</b> <b>The</b> declaration called for the acknowledgment of Palestinians’ right to self-government <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>PLO’s</b> right {{to be connected to}} peace initiatives.|$|R
500|$|During the Black September clashes in Jordan, al-Wazir {{supplied}} the encircled Palestinian forces in Jerash and Ajlun with arms and aid, [...] but the conflict was decided in Jordan's favor. After Arafat {{and thousands of}} Fatah fighters retreated to Lebanon, al-Wazir negotiated an agreement between King Hussein <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>PLO's</b> leading organizer, calling for better Palestinian conduct in Jordan. Then, along with <b>the</b> other <b>PLO</b> leaders, he relocated to Beirut.|$|R
5|$|Aflaq {{moved to}} Baghdad {{following}} his reelection to the Secretary Generalship in February 1968. He stayed there until 1970, when Black September happened, he criticised the Ba'ath leadership of doing {{too little to}} help the Palestine Liberation Organisation during the conflict. During the conflict, Aflaq lobbied extensively for Yasser Arafat <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>PLO.</b> Aflaq wanted Iraqi intervention; al-Bakr, however, refused to get Iraq involved in such a conflict. Because of this, Aflaq returned to Lebanon in self-imposed exile. The government of Hafez al-Assad, the President of Syria, condemned Aflaq to death in absentia in 1971.|$|E
5|$|In 1971, the Israeli Army {{attempted}} to disperse the {{high concentration of}} Palestinian refugees in al-Shati camp and developed new housing schemes {{that resulted in the}} establishment of the northern Sheikh Radwan district. The United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>PLO</b> were vociferous in their opposition to the move, claiming it was forced resettlement. In 1972, Gaza's military governor dismissed the city's mayor, Rashad al-Shawa, for refusing to annex al-Shati camp to the municipality of Gaza. Since the 1970s, frequent conflicts erupted between Palestinians and the Israeli authorities in the city, leading to the First Intifada in 1987. Gaza became a center of confrontation during this uprising, and consequently, economic conditions in the city worsened.|$|E
5|$|In {{accordance}} with {{the terms of the}} Oslo agreement, Arafat was required to implement PLO authority in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. He insisted that financial support was imperative to establishing this authority and needed it to secure the acceptance of the agreements by the Palestinians living in those areas. However, Arab states of the Persian Gulf—Arafat's usual source for financial backing—still refused to provide him <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>PLO</b> with any major donations for siding with Iraq during the 1991 Gulf War. Ahmed Qurei—a key Fatah negotiator during the negotiations in Oslo—publicly announced that the PLO was bankrupt.|$|E

50|$|Following <b>the</b> Oslo Agreement <b>and</b> <b>the</b> {{establishment}} of the Palestinian National Authority in 1994, <b>the</b> <b>PLO</b> office was upgraded <b>and</b> renamed as <b>the</b> <b>PLO</b> Mission to <b>the</b> United States.|$|R
50|$|In February, 1982, {{prominent}} Palestinian communists held {{a conference}} <b>and</b> re-established <b>the</b> Palestinian Communist Party.

5|$|From 1983 to 1993, Arafat based {{himself in}} Tunisia, {{and began to}} shift his {{approach}} from open conflict with the Israelis to negotiation. In 1988, he acknowledged Israel's right to exist and sought a two-state solution to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. In 1994 he returned to Palestine, settling in Gaza City and promoting self-governance for the Palestinian territories. He engaged {{in a series of}} negotiations with the Israeli government to end the conflict between it <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>PLO.</b> These included the Madrid Conference of 1991, the 1993 Oslo Accords and the 2000 Camp David Summit. In 1994 Arafat received the Nobel Peace Prize, together with Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres, for the negotiations at Oslo. At the time, Fatah's support among the Palestinians declined with the growth of Hamas and other militant rivals. In late 2004, after effectively being confined within his Ramallah compound for over two years by the Israeli army, Arafat fell into a coma and died. While the cause of Arafat's death has remained the subject of speculation, investigations by Russian and French teams determined no foul play was involved.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the Gulf War in 1990–91, {{when the}} Intifada's {{intensity}} began to wear down, Arafat supported Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait and opposed the US-led coalition attack on Iraq. He made this decision {{without the consent}} of other leading members of Fatah <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>PLO.</b> Arafat's top aide Abu Iyad vowed to stay neutral and opposed an alliance with Saddam; On 17 January 1991, Abu Iyad was assassinated by the Abu Nidal Organization. Arafat's decision also severed relations with Egypt and many of the oil-producing Arab states that supported the US-led coalition. Many in the US also used Arafat's position as a reason to disregard his claims to being a partner for peace. After the end of hostilities, many Arab states that backed the coalition cut off funds to the PLO and began providing financial support for the organization's rival Hamas and other Islamist groups. Arafat narrowly escaped death again on 7 April 1992, when an Air Bissau aircraft he was a passenger on crash-landed in the Libyan Desert during a sandstorm. Two pilots and an engineer were killed; Arafat was bruised and shaken.|$|E

Musa publicly complained over corrupt practices within <b>the</b> <b>PLO,</b> especially <b>the</b> promotion of political appointees loyal to Arafat to important military posts. He was also known for hardline views on Israel, and outspoken in his opposition to {{what he saw as}} Arafat's attempt to reach a negotiated solution to the conflict (see Rejectionist Front).|$|R
25|$|While Yasser Arafat <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>PLO</b> had {{not officially}} taken a {{side in the}} conflict, several PLO members were {{fighting}} with the LNM. Assad attempted to steer Arafat <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>PLO</b> away from Lebanon, threatening him with a cutoff of Syrian aid. The two sides were unable to reach an agreement. When Frangieh stepped down in 1976, Syria pressured Lebanese members of parliament to elect Elias Sarkis president. One-third of the Lebanese members of parliament (primarily supporters of Raymond Edde) boycotted the election to protest American and Syrian interference.|$|E

After Israel withdrew from Lebanon, Fatah forces resumed firing rockets into the Galilee region of Israel. During the years following operation Litani, many diplomatic efforts were made which tried to end the war on the Israeli–Lebanese border, including the effort of Philip Habib, the emissary of Ronald Reagan who in the summer of 1981 managed to arrange a lasting cease-fire between Israel <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>PLO</b> which lasted about a year.|$|E
