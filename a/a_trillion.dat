It is thought to be composed of comets that were ejected from the inner Solar System by gravitational interactions with the outer planets. Oort cloud objects move very slowly, and can be perturbed by infrequent events, such as collisions, the gravitational effects of a passing star, or the galactic tide, the tidal force exerted by the Milky Way.|$|E

25|$|In mathematics, France {{uses the}} infix {{notation}} like most countries. For large numbers the long scale is used. Thus, the French {{use the word}} billion for the number 1,000,000,000,000, which in countries using short scale is called <b>a</b> <b>trillion.</b> However, there exists a French word, milliard, for the number 1,000,000,000, which in countries using the short scale is called a billion. Thus, despite {{the use of the}} long scale, one billion is called un milliard ("one milliard") in French, and not mille millions ("one thousand million"). It {{should also be noted that}} names of numbers above the milliard are rarely used. Thus, one trillion will most often be called mille milliards ("one thousand milliard") in French, and rarely un billion.|$|E

25|$|As {{described}} above, one {{can identify}} significantly regulated genes {{first and then}} find patterns by comparing the list of significant genes to sets of genes known to share certain associations. One can also work the problem in reverse order. Here is a very simple example. Suppose there are 40 genes associated with a known process, for example, a predisposition to diabetes. Looking at two groups of expression profiles, one for mice fed a high carbohydrate diet and one for mice fed a low carbohydrate diet, one observes that all 40 diabetes genes are expressed {{at a higher level}} in the high carbohydrate group than the low carbohydrate group. Regardless of whether any of these genes would have made it to a list of significantly altered genes, observing all 40 up, and none down appears unlikely {{to be the result of}} pure chance: flipping 40 heads in a row is predicted to occur about one time in <b>a</b> <b>trillion</b> attempts using a fair coin.|$|E
25|$|Very {{low mass}} stars are fully {{convective}} and {{may continue to}} fuse hydrogen into helium for up to <b>a</b> <b>trillion</b> years until {{only a small fraction}} of the entire star is hydrogen. Luminosity and temperature steadily increase during this time, just as for more-massive main-sequence stars, but the length of time involved means that the temperature eventually increases by about 50% and the luminosity by around 10 times. Eventually the level of helium increases to the point where the star ceases to be fully convective and the remaining hydrogen locked in the core is consumed in only a few billion more years. Depending on mass, the temperature and luminosity continue to increase for a time during hydrogen shell burning, the star can become hotter than the Sun and tens of times more luminous than when it formed although still not as luminous as the Sun. After some billions more years, they start to become less luminous and cooler even though hydrogen shell burning continues. These become cool helium white dwarfs.|$|E

500|$|Although {{more massive}} stars have more fuel to burn and might {{intuitively}} {{be expected to}} last longer, they also radiate a proportionately greater amount with increased mass. This is required by the stellar equation of state; for a massive star to maintain equilibrium, the outward pressure of radiated energy generated in the core not only must but will rise to match the titanic inward gravitational pressure of its [...] envelope. Thus, the most massive stars may remain on the main sequence {{for only a few}} million years, while stars with less than a tenth of a solar mass may last for over <b>a</b> <b>trillion</b> years.|$|E
