Hutson was classified I-A for the military draft, but had three daughters, so was able to avoid conscription. On the notion that Hutson exploited watered-down defenses, former Packers running back Paul Hornung responded as such: [...] "I'm a believer. <b>Am</b> <b>I</b> <b>a</b> believer!

ChaCha collectively ranked Phoebe, Rachel and Monica the 11th, 12th and 13th best female television {{characters of}} all-time, respectively. Maria Tallarico of Cosmopolitan observed {{that a number}} of Monica's storylines, specifically one in which the character unintentionally has sex with a high school senior, [...] "probably wouldn't fly on TV today". Writing for Mic.com, Samantha Allen believes that Monica helped [...] "set the standard for how sitcoms could and would talk about sex" [...] by both engaging in casual sex and dating a much older man. According to Dustin Levy of The Diamondback, Monica inspired [...] "any ensemble cast in a sitcom with a female character who is bossy or neurotic," [...] citing Scrubs’ Elliot Reid and Happy Endings’ Jane Kerkovich-Williams as examples of Monica's influence. Additionally, Levy identified Claire Dunphy from the sitcom Modern Family as Monica's modern-day equivalent, explaining that the character [...] "acts like Monica plus children". In spring 2015, TV Guide published an article entitled [...] "22 Spring Cleaning Tips From Monica Geller" [...] in recognition of the character's cleanliness. In her article [...] "5 Signs You’re A Real-Life Monica Geller", Ayn Bernos of Thought Catalog wrote that the character's personality is the reason [...] "all perfectionist fans of this iconic TV show have asked themselves this question at least once in their life: 'Oh my god, <b>am</b> <b>I</b> <b>a</b> Monica Geller?!'" [...] Emma Lord of Bustle expounded in her article [...] "13 Signs You Are The Monica Of Your Friend Group" [...] "that isn't to say life is easy for the Real Life Monicas of the world. First, there's all the name calling: 'neat freak' and 'sore loser', to name a few. Second, all of your elaborate, carefully-laid plans inevitably go haywire when people around you don't respect the obvious beauty and rightness of them." ...|$|E

However, in January 1916, he moved into a {{boarding}} house near the junior high school (comparable to a modern high school) {{to which he had}} formerly commuted by train. Through many of Kawabata’s works the sense of distance in his life is represented. He often gives the impression that his characters have built up a wall around them that moves them into isolation. In a 1934 published work Kawabata wrote: “I feel as though I have never held a woman’s hand in a romantic sense <b>Am</b> <b>I</b> <b>a</b> happy man deserving of pity?”. Indeed, this {{does not have to be}} taken literally, but it does show the type of emotional insecurity that Kawabata felt, especially experiencing two painful love affairs at a young age. One of those painful love episodes was with Hatsuyo Ito ( [...] , 1906-1951) whom he met when he was 20 years old. His unsent love letter to her was recently found at his former residence in Kamakura, Kanagawa Prefecture. According to Kaori Kawabata, Kawabata's son-in-law, an unpublished entry in the author's diary mentions that Hatsuyo was raped by a monk at the temple she was staying at, which led her to break off their engagement.|$|E
