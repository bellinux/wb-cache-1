In 1990, he staged {{one of the}} largest and most extravagant rock concerts in history, The Wall– Live in Berlin, with an official attendance of 200,000. As a member of Pink Floyd, he was inducted into the U.S. Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996 and the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2005. In the same year he released , an opera in three acts translated from Étienne and Nadine Roda-Gils' libretto about the French Revolution. Later that year, he reunited with Pink Floyd bandmates Mason, Wright and David Gilmour for the Live 8 global awareness event; it was the group's first appearance with Waters since 1981. He has toured extensively as a solo act since 1999 and played The Dark Side of the Moon in its entirety for his world tour of 2006–2008. In 2010, he began The Wall Live and in 2011 Gilmour and Mason appeared with him during a performance of the double-album in London. As of 2017, the tour is the highest-grossing of all time by a solo artist.|$|E
500|$|The Jesuit critic William F. Lynch, who {{believed}} that salvation happens within time and not outside of it, explained what Eliot was attempting {{to do in the}} Four Quartets when he wrote: [...] "it is hard to say no to the impression, if I may use a mixture of my own symbols and his, that the Christian imagination is finally limited to the element of fire, to the day of Pentecost, to the descent of the Holy Ghost upon the disciples. The revelation of eternity and time is of an intersection ... It seems not unseemly to suppose that Eliot's imagination (<b>and</b> <b>is</b> <b>this</b> not a theology?) is alive with points of intersection and of descent." [...] He continued with a focus on how time operated within the poem: [...] "He seems to place our faith, our hope, and our love, not in the flux of time but in the points of time. I am sure his mind is interested in the line and time of Christ, whose Spirit is his total flux. But I am not so sure about his imagination. Is it or is it not an imagination which is saved from time's nausea or terror by points of intersection? ... There seems little doubt that Eliot is attracted above all by the image and the goal of immobility, and that in everything he seeks for approximations to this goal in the human order." [...] Lynch went on to point out that this understanding of time includes Asian influences.|$|E

2500|$|At {{another point}} in the interview, De Carli {{mentions}} that Cardinal Ottaviani had once stated that the Third Secret was written on a single sheet of paper. He also mentions that one of Lúcia's memoirs contains the words, [...] "In Portugal, the dogma of the faith will always be preserved etc", words which some believe introduce the real Third Secret. Describing these observations as [...] "feeble bits of evidence that neither prove nor disprove anything", De Carli asks Cardinal Bertone {{about the possibility of}} there being two texts, where the [...] "first document" [...] contains the words of the Blessed Virgin Mary, and the other contains the description of the vision published by the Vatican. Bertone answers in part, [...] "There is no first document. There never was any such text in the archives of the Holy Office." [...] Bertone also says, [...] "So I'm not sure what Cardinal Ottaviani was talking about." [...] Bertone also states that, [...] "We have the word, better, the official confirmation of Sister Lúcia: 'Is this the Third Secret, <b>and</b> <b>is</b> <b>this</b> the only text of it?' 'Yes, this is the Third Secret, and I never wrote any other'." ...|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, while Gao was at Emperor Zhuangzong's court, Emperor Zhuangzong {{had asked}} for Gao's advice on {{which of the two}} main rival states — Former Shu and Wu — he should target next. [...] Gao, believing that Former Shu, well-protected by natural defenses, would be {{difficult}} to conquer, and not wanting Emperor Zhuangzong's empire to keep expanding, told Emperor Zhuangzong that he should attack Former Shu first. [...] When the Later Tang army commanded by Guo and Emperor Zhuangzong's son Li Jiji the Prince of Wei conquered Former Shu in 925, Gao was shocked to hear the news while he was dining, such that he dropped his chopsticks on the ground. [...] He stated, [...] "This is this old man's fault!" [...] Liang responded, [...] "You need not worry. [...] The Lord of Tang, after he conquered Shu lands, will be even more arrogant. [...] He will surely be destroyed soon, <b>and</b> <b>is</b> <b>this</b> {{not going to be a}} blessing to us?" [...] Subsequently, Emperor Zhuangzong's wife Empress Liu, believing that Guo had stripped the Shu territory of its wealth, ordered Guo killed, leading to the collapse of the Later Tang army morale and Emperor Zhuangzong's death in a mutiny. [...] It was said that when this news arrived at Jiangling, Gao was impressed with and became even more respectful of Liang. [...] It was also around this time that Liang recommended Sun Guangxian to Gao — [...] and Sun would eventually serve as chief strategist to the rulers of Jingnan who would succeed Gao (Gao's son Gao Conghui, grandsons Gao Baorong and Gao Baoxu, and great-grandson Gao Jichong).|$|E
2500|$|My next {{visit was}} to Pohick Church, in the {{vicinity}} of Mt. Vernon, the seat of General Washington. It was still raining when I approached the house, and found no one there. The wide open doors invited me to enter, as they do invite, day and night through the year, not only the passing traveller, but every beast of the field and fowl of the air. These latter however seemed to have reverenced the house of God, since few marks of their pollution were to be seen throughout it. The interior of the house, having been well built, is still good. The chancel, Communion table and tables of the law [...] are still there and in good order. The roof only is decaying; and at the time I was there the rain was dropping on these sacred places and on other parts of the house. On the doors of the pews, in gilt letters, are still to be seen the names of the principal Families which once occupied them. How could I, while {{for at least an hour}} traversing those long aisles, ascending the lofty pulpit, entering the sacred chancel, forbear to ask, <b>And</b> <b>is</b> <b>this</b> the House of God which was built by the Washingtons, the Mc.Cartys, the Lewises, the Fairfaxes?-the house in which they used to worship the God of our fathers according to the venerable forms of the Episcopal Church, and some of whose names are still to be seen on the doors of those now deserted pews? Is this also destined to moulder piecemeal away, or, when some signal is given, to become the prey of spoilers, and to be carried hither and thither and applied to every purpose under heaven? ...|$|E
