5|$|Dion Phaneuf (born April 10, 1985) is a Canadian {{professional}} {{ice hockey}} defenceman and an alternate captain for the Ottawa Senators of the National Hockey League (NHL). He has previously {{played for the}} Calgary Flames and Toronto Maple Leafs. He was drafted ninth overall in the 2003 NHL Entry Draft by Calgary and made his NHL debut in 2005 after a four-year junior career with the Red Deer Rebels of the Western Hockey League (WHL), {{in which he was}} twice named the Defenceman of the Year. He set a Flames record for most goals by <b>a</b> <b>first-year</b> defenceman and was named a finalist for the Calder Memorial Trophy as top rookie in 2005–06. Two years later, he was a finalist for the James Norris Memorial Trophy as top defenceman, though he did not win either award. Since going pro, Phaneuf has been involved in two blockbuster trades. The first came in late 2009, when he was involved in a seven-player trade that saw him move from Calgary to Toronto. Six years later, Phaneuf was the centrepiece of a 9-player deal that saw him sent from Toronto to Ottawa.|$|E
5|$|During a CNR hockey tournament held in December 1922 in Montreal, Morenz scored nine {{goals in}} a game for Stratford. A friend of Léo Dandurand, {{the owner of the}} Montreal Canadiens of the National Hockey League, {{refereed}} the game and told Dandurand how good Morenz was. Dandurand went to Stratford in January 1923 to watch Morenz play, and decided he wanted to sign him to the Canadiens. In April he met with William Morenz, because at the age of 20, Howie was still legally a minor. William told Dandurand that he wanted Howie to finish his apprenticeship at the CNR factory, which would take another two years. However, in July Dandurand learned that Morenz and his father had been in contact with the Toronto St. Patricks, a rival team in the NHL. Fearing that Morenz would sign in Toronto, Dandurand sent his friend, Cecil Hart, to Stratford with instructions to sign Morenz at any cost. On July 7, 1923, Morenz signed a contract with the Canadiens for three years with a salary of $3,500 per year and a $1,000 signing bonus, a considerable amount for <b>a</b> <b>first-year</b> professional.|$|E

5|$|Nao is <b>a</b> <b>first-year</b> {{student at}} Hoshinoumi Academy {{and is also}} its student council president.

She uses this ability to her advantage to attack others she believes deserve to be kicked, but this causes her to be shunned and bullied by her peers. Although she initially shows no attraction towards Yuu, she eventually falls in love with him and stays by his side even after he loses all of his memories of her. She is a fan of Zhiend, influenced by her older brother , who once had the ability to control air movements and vibrations, which he used when playing the guitar.|$|E
5|$|Rumours {{fly around}} the school {{regarding}} the Chamber of Secrets' history.

Slytherin believed that students of non-magical parentage should be refused entry to the school. When a Bludger, one of the balls involved in Quidditch, chases after Harry instead of zigzagging toward any player it can hit, breaking his arm, Dobby returns {{in the middle of the}} night to visit Harry in the hospital wing, revealing that it was he who charmed the Bludger and sealed the gateway at King’s Cross and that the Chamber of Secrets had been opened before. Another attack occurs, this time to <b>a</b> <b>first-year</b> Gryffindor named Colin Creevey who idolises Harry, and the school enters panic mode, setting up a dueling class for the students (led by Lockhart and Potions master/Head of Slytherin House Severus Snape), during which it is revealed that Harry is a 'Parselmouth', meaning he has the rare gift to speak to snakes.|$|E

5|$|Yuu is {{the protagonist}} of Charlotte.

Yuu is <b>a</b> <b>first-year</b> student at Hoshinoumi Academy, and he is forced to join its student council. Initially a fake honors student and chronic cheater, Yuu is reluctant to use his ability to aide the student council, but as time goes on, he becomes less narcissistic and much more selfless and caring towards others. Over the course of the story, he becomes a fan of the post-rock band Zhiend and falls in love with Nao. After Yuu travels worldwide to steal every ability user's power to protect them from being exploited, the strain of it causes him to lose all of his past memories. His older brother is Shunsuke and his younger sister is Ayumi.|$|E
5|$|A {{review of}} spectacled warbler records was {{initiated}} in 1984. This review {{resulted in the}} species being removed from the British list; of the three accepted records, one, at Spurn, Yorkshire in 1968, was re-identified as <b>a</b> <b>first-year</b> female subalpine warbler, while descriptions of the other two, at Porthgwarra, Cornwall in October 1969 and on Fair Isle in June 1979, were not considered sufficiently watertight to permit their continued acceptance. Spectacled warbler has since been re-added to the British list following an individual at Filey, Yorkshire in 1992, {{and there have been}} further subsequent records. In the late 1990s, BBRC reviewed some of the accepted records of moustached warbler, and concluded that one, from Sussex in 1979, was unacceptable, but that one other, from Buckinghamshire in 1965, should stand. Two further records, from Hampshire in 1951 and Kent in 1952, were reviewed as part of the 1950–1957 review (see below), and found to be unacceptable. Following these rejections, the Buckinghamshire record, and the remaining record, a breeding pair in Cambridgeshire in 1946, previously accepted as Britain's first, were scrutinised by the BOURC and found to be unacceptable, leading to the removal of moustached warbler from the British list; it has not re-occurred.|$|E
5|$|Howarth {{started his}} career with {{hometown}} club York City in their youth system, joining in 1996 on schoolboy terms. In the summer of 1998, he signed a three-year academy scholarship at York and became <b>a</b> <b>first-year</b> trainee. During May 1999, he played for York in the Candia-66 International Under-20s Tournament, a youth tournament hosted in Europe. York won the tournament after defeating Trenkvin Slowakigie in the final, in which Howarth saved two penalty kicks in the 4–2 penalty shoot-out victory. Aged 17, he made his first-team debut for Third Division York in a 1–0 victory at home to Swansea City in the opening match of the 1999–2000 season on 7 August 1999. He started the season as York's first-choice goalkeeper ahead of the experienced Bobby Mimms, keeping clean sheets {{in the first three}} matches. On 26 August 1999, two days after making his fifth successive appearance, Howarth signed a three-year professional contract with York. However, after conceding 11 goals in three matches, and having played in York's first six matches of the season, manager Neil Thompson dropped him for the more experienced Mimms. York's management team insisted Howarth's exclusion was to safeguard him, and was not based on merit. His next appearance came as a 72nd-minute substitute in York's 2–0 defeat away to Plymouth Argyle on 19 February 2000, following an injury to Mimms. Howarth was favoured over Mimms for the following match, a 0–0 draw at home to Exeter City on 26 February 2000. However, following the signing of Northern Ireland international Alan Fettis, Howarth was once again restricted to the substitutes' bench. His first season in senior football finished with eight appearances.|$|E
