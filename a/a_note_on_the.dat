It contains the entire text of Sherman's 1886 edition, together with annotations, <b>a</b> <b>note</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> text, and a detailed chronology of Sherman's life. Missing from this edition is the useful biographical material contained in the 1891 Johnson and Blaine editions.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, P. Mausfeld and D. Vrcibradic {{published}} <b>a</b> <b>note</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> nomenclature of the Noronha skink {{informed by}} a re-examination of Gray's original type specimens; despite extensive attempts to correctly name the species, they were apparently {{the first to}} do so since Boulenger in 1887. Based on differences {{in the number of}} scales, subdigital lamellae (lamellae on the lower sides of the digits), and keels (longitudinal ridges) on the dorsal scales (located on the upperparts), as well as the separation of the parietal scales (on the head behind the eyes) in maculata, they concluded that the two were not, after all, identical, and that Schmidt's name Mabuya atlantica should therefore be used. Mausfeld and Vrcibradic considered Mabouya punctatissima to represent a different species on the basis of morphological differences, but were unable to resolve the status of Trachylepis (Xystrolepis) punctata.|$|E

25|$|Paradise Lost is an epic poem in blank verse by the 17th-century English poet John Milton (1608–1674).

25|$|Especially in fansubs, the {{subtitle}} translator may translate both form and meaning. The subtitle translator may also choose {{to display a}} note in {{the subtitle}}s, usually in parentheses (“” and “”), or as a separate block of on-screen text—this allows the subtitle translator to preserve form and achieve an acceptable reading speed; that is, the subtitle translator may leave <b>a</b> <b>note</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> screen, even after the character has finished speaking, to both preserve form and facilitate understanding. For example, the Japanese language has multiple first-person pronouns (see Japanese pronouns) and each pronoun {{is associated with a}} different degree of politeness. In order to compensate during the English translation process, the subtitle translator may reformulate the sentence, add appropriate words and/or use notes.|$|E

500|$|<b>A</b> <b>note</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{autograph}} {{score of}} the cantata indicates that the work was commissioned by Georg Christian Eilmar, minister of the Marienkirche (St Mary's church) in Mühlhausen. [...] This allows the work to be dated to 1707–08, which is the period when Bach was living in Mühlhausen. [...] Bach was employed as organist at the city's other main church, Divi Blasii,. He was also involved to some extent with performances at the Marienkirche, where civic ceremonies were held. [...] One service there which Bach would have attended was that for the city council's inauguration in 1708 during which his cantata Gott ist mein Konig, BWV 71 had its premiere. He {{may have had a}} closer personal relationship with Eilmar than with the minister of his own church. Eilmar was godfather to his daughter Catharina Dorothea (born 1708).|$|E

Church received the letter from Springsteen's after a show on August 19, 2012.

500|$|One of {{the more}} notable events {{occurred}} on Midway when the pilot of a VNAF Cessna O-1 dropped <b>a</b> <b>note</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> deck of the carrier. The note read [...] "Can you move these helicopter to the other side, I can land on your runway, I can fly 1 hour more, we {{have enough time to}} move. Please rescue me. Major Buang, Wife and 5 child." [...] Midways CO, Captain L.C. Chambers ordered the flight deck crew to clear the landing area; in the process an estimated US$10 million worth of UH-1 Huey helicopters were pushed overboard into the South China Sea. Once the deck was clear Major Buang approached the deck, bounced once and then touched down and taxied to a halt with room to spare. Major Buang became the first VNAF fixed-wing pilot to ever land on a carrier. A second Cessna O-1 was also recovered by the USS Midway that afternoon.|$|E
500|$|In 1904, George Clinch {{published}} <b>a</b> <b>note</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Medway Megaliths in the Royal Anthropological Institute's journal, Man, {{in which}} {{he referred to the}} Coldrum Stones as [...] "at once the most remarkable and the least known of the whole series."

Ultimately, he ended his note by urging for the site to be protected under the Ancient Monuments Protection Act 1900. In that same issue, Lewis included an added note {{in which he}} rejected the idea that the monument had once been covered by an earthen tumulus because he could see [...] "no evidence that anything of that kind ever existed", and instead he interpreted the site as a stone circle, comparing it to the examples at Avebury, Arborlow, and Stanton Drew, suggesting that the central chamber was a shrine.|$|E
