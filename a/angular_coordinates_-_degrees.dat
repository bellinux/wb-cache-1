40|$|The {{microstructure}} {{of materials}} is usually described by size <b>coordinates</b> <b>-</b> xyz, reflecting the size, shape and {{the arrangement of}} the microstructural elements and by <b>angular</b> <b>coordinates</b> <b>-</b> ▫theta▫ 1 fi ▫theta▫ 2, which show the texture. Texture is defined as the orientation distribution of crystallites ina polycrystalline material and results from many kinds of anisotropic solid-state process which can affect the material 2 ̆ 7 s anisotropic properties. The texture can either be measured grain-by-grain or by diffraction from the crystalline material, with the majority of all texture studies being performed by X-ray diffraction. The function f(g), which describes the volume fraction of grains with a particular orientation g is discussed. In metallic materials the main features of texture are described by using adequate solutions of the three-dimensional orientation distribution function (ODF), which is usually calculated from two-dimensional X-ray pole figures. In the ODF the whole volume fraction of the crystals having a particular orientation is quantitatively described. The interpretation of the full ODF is difficult for a non-specialist and many not always be the most suitable way of presenting the texturebut it does allow the identification of texture fibres, their quantitative analysis, as well as the selective projection and plot of characteristic orientation fibres. Different methods for the presentation of textures are compared and discussed using the development of Goss and cube texture in electrical steel alloyed with Sn and Sb as an example. Mikrostrukturo materiala opišemo s koordinatami - xyz (velikost, oblika in razporeditev mikrostrukturnih elementov) in s kotnimi koordinatami - ▫theta▫ 1 fi ▫theta▫ 2 (ki opredeljujejo kristalografsko orientacijo v prostoru, teksturo). Tekstura je orientacijska porazdelitev kristalnih zrn v polikristalnem vzorcu. Pri vseh anizotropnih procesih v trdnem nastane tekstura, ki ima za posledico anizotropijo lastnosti materiala. Teksturo opredelimo z določanjem orientacije posameznih zrn ali z uklonom rentgenske svetlobe na polikristalnem vzorcu. Večina vseh teksturnih meritev je narejena z rentgensko uklonsko metodo (XRD - X-ray diffraction). Opisana je funkcija f(g), ki podaja volumski delež zrn z orientacijo g. S presekom tridimenzionalne orientacijske porazdelitvene funkcije (ODF), ki se ponavadi izračuna iz dvodimenzionalnih polovih figur, se lahko v primeru kovinskih materialov jasno in natančno opišejo glavne značilnosti določenega tipa teksture. Celotno ODF-funkcijo je zelo nerodno prikazovati, poleg tega pa je njena interpretacija zelo zahtevna. Omogoča identifikacijo teksture vlaken, kvantitativno analizo teksture, selektivno projekcijo in slike karakterističnih orientacijskih vlaken.

The gravitational deflection of null geodesics can then be obtained, in any other gauge, simply by expressing the <b>angular</b> <b>coordinates</b> of the given gauge in terms of the GLC <b>angular</b> <b>coordinates.</b> We apply this method to the standard Poisson gauge, including scalar perturbations, and give the full result for the deflection effect in terms of the direction of observation and observed redshift up to second order, and up to third order for the leading lensing terms. We also compare our results with those presently available in the literature and, in particular, we provide a new non trivial check of a previous result on the luminosity-redshft relation up to second order in cosmological perturbation theory.
