5|$|On 15 August 1998 the RIRA left a car {{containing}} 500lb of home-made explosives in {{the centre}} of Omagh, County Tyrone. The bombers could not find <b>a</b> <b>parking</b> <b>space</b> near the intended target of the courthouse, and the car was left 400 metres away. As a result, three inaccurate telephone warnings were issued, and the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) believed the bomb was located outside the courthouse. They attempted to establish a security cordon to keep civilians clear of the area, which inadvertently pushed people closer {{to the location of}} the bomb. Shortly after, the bomb exploded killing 29 people and injuring 220 others, in what became the single deadliest strike of the Troubles.|$|E
5|$|A 2009 study {{conducted}} by the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration found that crashes involving pedestrians and bicyclists have higher incidence rates for hybrid electric vehicles than internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles in low-speed vehicle maneuvers such as reversing or leaving a parking zone. These accidents commonly occurred in zones with low speed limits, during daytime and in clear weather. The study found that a HEV was two {{times more likely to be}} involved in a pedestrian crash than was a conventional ICE vehicle when a vehicle is slowing or stopping, backing up, or entering or leaving <b>a</b> <b>parking</b> <b>space.</b> Vehicle maneuvers were grouped in one category considering those maneuvers that might have occurred at very low speeds where the difference between the sound levels produced by the hybrid versus ICE vehicle is the greatest. Also the study found that the incidence rate of pedestrian crashes in scenarios when vehicles make a turn was significantly higher for HEVs when compared to ICE vehicles. Similarly, The NHTSA study also concluded that the incidence rate of bicyclist crashes involving HEVs for the same kind of maneuvers was significantly higher when compared to conventional vehicles.|$|E

40|$|Nowadays, peoples {{are facing}} problem to find <b>an</b> {{available}} <b>parking</b> <b>space</b> in <b>parking</b> lot {{due to the}} tremendous increase of occupancy of cars. When driver enters <b>a</b> certain <b>parking</b> lot, the driver takes along time just to find <b>an</b> available <b>parking</b> <b>space.</b> <b>A</b> Counting Available <b>Parking</b> <b>Space</b> using Image Processing (CAPSuIP) has been developed {{to solve the problem}} that driver faced with low cost. CAPSuIP use image processing to detect of existence of the car and also provide information such as number of available <b>parking</b> <b>space</b> and the location of that parking. The system captures image using surveillance camera and process the image to counting available <b>parking</b> <b>space.</b> The system use a modified Software D&velopment Life Cycle (SDLC) to plan, analyze, design, development and testing. Techniques of image processing have been embedded in each phase of methodology.

25|$|The Japan model {{included}} a rear-view monitor which displays {{an image of}} the area {{at the rear of the}} vehicle while backing up to reduce the burden on the driver while parking. Also, the optional Intelligent Parking Assist system supports steering operations when parallel parking and backing into <b>a</b> <b>parking</b> <b>space.</b> Ultrasonic sensors installed on the front of the vehicle detect other parked vehicles and, based on the results, estimate the physical dimensions of a vacant parking space and set the target parking position.|$|E
25|$|On {{the day of}} the bombing, {{they drove}} the car across the Irish border and at about 14:19 parked the vehicle outside S.D. Kells' clothes shop in Omagh's Lower Market Street, on the {{southern}} side of the town centre, near the crossroads with Dublin Road. They could not find <b>a</b> <b>parking</b> <b>space</b> near the intended target, the Omagh courthouse. The car had arrived from an easterly direction. The two male occupants then armed the bomb and upon exiting the car, walked east down Market Street towards Campsie Road. Two Spanish tourists stopped beside the car, and were photographed. The photographer died in the bombing, but the man and child in the photograph survived.|$|E
25|$|While other {{countries}} seem {{to use these}} spots to create a safe environment for women, there has been controversy across the media in regards to sexism, since China {{is the only country}} that has made these spots significantly bigger. At the Wonder Mall in Hebei, there is an entire parking garage reserved for women, which contains spaces that were 80 centimeters larger than regular parking spaces. If women have trouble parking in the significantly bigger lots, there are dancing parking-lot employees designated to park the cars for them. The walls in the women-only parking garage are designed with the 12 animals of the Chinese zodiac/horoscope as a precaution for female drivers who can remember a picture better than <b>a</b> <b>parking</b> <b>space</b> number.|$|E

In the car were found a quantity of Semtex, detonators, and equipment for a radio detonation device, which, [...] "O" [...] told the coroner, led MI5 {{to the conclusion that}} the IRA might use a similar device for the planned attack in Gibraltar. MI5 further believed that the IRA had been unlikely to use a [...] "blocking car" [...] (an empty vehicle used to hold <b>a</b> <b>parking</b> <b>space</b> until the bombers bring in the vehicle containing the explosives) as this entailed the added risk of multiple border crossings.

In the pilot, the car used was an orange 1969 BMC Morris Mini 1000 Mark 2 hardtop (registration RNT 996H), but this was destroyed in an off-screen crash {{at the end of}} the episode. From then on, the car was a 1976 model (registration SLW 287R), Green in colour with a matte black bonnet. Throughout the sitcom, Bean keeps it locked with a bolt-latch and padlock, rather than the lock fitted to the car, which formed a running joke in several episodes; in two episode, he demonstrated an additional, innovative security measure, in that he removes the steering wheel instead of the key, which in one episode deterred a car thief. In [...] "Back to School Mr. Bean", Bean's Mini is crushed by a tank as part of a demonstration, after he replaced an identical Mini (registration ACW 497V), meant for the demonstration, with his own to secure <b>a</b> <b>parking</b> <b>space.</b> Despite losing it, he later removes his padlock and bolt-latch from it, and finds another to use sometime after the episode.|$|E
