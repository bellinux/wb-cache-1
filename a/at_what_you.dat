Holland thought they were all funny, so he created a brief montage inter-cutting several of the lines into the same scene.|$|E

2500|$|By 2004, Wyatt had {{departed}} from MCA Records. She signed a contract, negotiated by her ex-husband/road manager Rahmat Morton, with Cash Money Records/Universal Motown Records, under {{the management of}} Cassandra Ware. Her second album Emotional Rollercoaster was originally set for release on May 31, 2005, but was postponed for release in early 2006. The set's first single, [...] "Put Your Hands on Me", became the #1 most added urban track to radio in April 2005.

Beyond the first single, other songs slated to appear on her second album included [...] "Look <b>at</b> <b>What</b> <b>You</b> Made Me Do," [...] "Insecurity" [...] written by Bryan Michael Cox, [...] "My Man," [...] "Six Questions" [...] featuring Avant, [...] "Cheaters," [...] "Who Knows" [...] written by Tank, [...] "Peace on Earth," [...] a remake of a Rachelle Ferrell single, and the title track [...] "Emotional Rollercoaster" [...] featuring Ginuwine.
