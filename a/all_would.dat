5|$|Maryland (ACC: 4–2) {{would have}} won the {{division}} title if they had either: (1) beaten both Florida State and Boston College; (2) beaten Florida State, while Boston College lost to Wake Forest; or (3) beaten Boston College, while Boston College lost to Wake Forest. That last scenario would have caused a three-way tie between Maryland, Florida State, and Wake Forest. <b>All</b> <b>would</b> have possessed a 5–3 conference record, and no head-to-head tiebreaker would have been possible. In that case, the winner would have been decided by divisional record, of which the Terrapins {{would have had the}} best (ACC Atlantic: 4–1).|$|E
5|$|The {{resulting}} reforms {{helped shape}} the cavalry's contribution to the British Expeditionary Force (BEF), which was established with one cavalry division supported by two brigades of horse artillery. <b>All</b> <b>would</b> be trained for the mounted charge but would also be armed with rifles, the only major power to do so. The cavalry regiments were armed with Maxim Machine Guns, although these were replaced by Vickers Machine Guns from 1912. More than anything else, the issue of entrenching tools that were carried on the troop packhorses demonstrated how much the cavalry's doctrine had changed since the Boer Wars.|$|E
5|$|In the Life of Probus, {{the author}} 'Flavius Vopiscus of Syracuse' {{states that the}} Emperor's {{descendants}} (posteri) fled from Rome and settled near Verona. There a statue of Probus was struck by lightning, a portent according to soothsayers 'that future generations of the family would rise to such distinction in the senate they <b>all</b> <b>would</b> hold the highest posts', though Vopiscus (supposedly writing under Constantine) says this prophecy has not yet come to pass. This {{is one of the}} strongest indications of the History's late 4th-century date, as {{it seems to be a}} fairly transparent allusion to the rich and powerful senator Sextus Claudius Petronius Probus (consul in 371) whose two sons held the consulship together in 395. Petronius Probus was born in Verona.|$|E

5|$|Seymour's {{operatives}} sought Johnson's support, but he long {{remained silent}} on the presidential campaign. It was not until October, with the vote already having taken place in some states, that he mentioned Seymour at all, and he never endorsed him. Nevertheless, Johnson regretted Grant's victory, {{in part because of}} their animus from the Stanton affair. In his annual message to Congress in December, Johnson urged the repeal of the Tenure of Office Act and told legislators that had they admitted their Southern colleagues in 1865, <b>all</b> <b>would</b> have been well. He celebrated his 60th birthday in late December with a party for several hundred children, though not including those of President-elect Grant, who did not allow his to go.|$|E
5|$|The victory {{claims that}} were made by each side in the {{immediate}} aftermath of the Battle of Hampton Roads, based as both were on misinterpretations of the opponent's behavior, have been dismissed by present-day historians. They agree that the result of the Monitor–Merrimack encounter was not a victory for either side. As the combat between ironclads was the primary significance of the battle, the general verdict is that the overall result was a draw. <b>All</b> <b>would</b> acknowledge that the Southern fleet inflicted far more damage than it received, which would ordinarily imply that they had gained a tactical victory. Compared to other Civil War battles, the loss of men and ships for the Union Navy would be considered a clear defeat. On the other hand, the blockade was not seriously threatened, so the entire battle can be regarded as an assault that ultimately failed.|$|E

25|$|The {{absence of}} {{pressure}} {{forces from the}} governing velocity equation demonstrates that the equation is not a dynamic one, but rather a kinematic equation where the divergence-free condition serves {{the role of a}} conservation equation. This <b>all</b> <b>would</b> seem to refute the frequent statements that the incompressible pressure enforces the divergence-free condition.|$|E
25|$|In these areas, {{hunting and}} {{poaching}} of wild bushmeat has declined dramatically. The approach holds promise {{for the area}} surrounding the park. Other ways to protect the endangered species include creating corridors or eco-ducts, highway diversion and improved policing. <b>All</b> <b>would</b> be expensive and depend on committed government officials {{at the state and}} federal levels.|$|E

25|$|On foundation, Olcott was {{appointed}} chairman, with Judge as secretary, and Blavatsky as corresponding secretary, although she remained the group's primary theoretician and leading figure.

So-on often was rough on Suzuki but gave him some latitude for being so young.|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless, the 1st and 5th Kentucky Rifle Regiments and the 1st Volunteers {{continued}} to hold out in Frenchtown. Losing 5 killed and 40 wounded, they had succeeded in taking a heavy toll on the British artillery. Their marksmen had kill or wounded all but {{one member of the}} gun crews manning the three cannon {{in the center of the}} British line, plus 13 of the 16-man howitzer crew. They had also brought down many infantrymen. Now, however, they were finally running out of ammunition, having repulsed three British assaults. Gen. Proctor demanded Winchester order his remaining men to surrender. Otherwise, <b>all</b> <b>would</b> be killed and Frenchtown burned. Procter insisted on an unconditional surrender and refused Winchester's counter-proposals, since Winchester was already his prisoner. Major George Madison, a United States officer still on the battlefield, persuaded Procter to accept a surrender on the promise that <b>all</b> <b>would</b> be protected as prisoners of war.|$|E

25|$|How Zehaf-Bibeau {{obtained}} his gun has {{not been}} determined. At {{the time of the}} shootings, Zehaf-Bibeau was legally prohibited from possessing or acquiring firearms. Additionally, his previous criminal charges and convictions, history of drug abuse, and lack of a fixed address <b>all</b> <b>would</b> have prevented him from receiving a Canadian Firearms Licence. A knife that Zehaf-Bibeau had with him on October 22 was determined to have originated from a relative's home.|$|E
25|$|In 1850 the Royal Commission {{appointed}} to organise the Great Exhibition {{were in a}} quandary. An international competition to design a building to house the Exhibition had produced 245 designs, of which only two were remotely suitable, and <b>all</b> <b>would</b> take too long to build and would be too permanent. There was an outcry by the public and in Parliament against the desecration of Hyde Park.|$|E
25|$|Instead, Bellamy's utopian {{society of}} the future was based upon the {{voluntary}} employment of all citizens {{between the ages of}} 21 and 45, after which time <b>all</b> <b>would</b> retire. Work was simple, aided by machine production, working hours short and vacation time long. The new economic basis of society effectively remade human nature itself in Bellamy's idyllic vision, with greed, maliciousness, untruthfulness, and insanity all relegated to the past.|$|E

25|$|Ruskin's {{developing}} {{interest in}} architecture, {{and particularly in}} the Gothic revival, led to the first work to bear his name, The Seven Lamps of Architecture (1849). It contained 14 plates etched by the author. The title refers to seven moral categories that Ruskin considered vital to and inseparable from all architecture: sacrifice, truth, power, beauty, life, memory and obedience. <b>All</b> <b>would</b> provide recurring themes in his work.|$|E
25|$|Mrs. Sutton {{began her}} {{several years of}} {{corresponding}} with Wright's studio by asking Wright to design an enlargement for the Suttons' existing house {{for no more than}} $2000. Besides Wright, she corresponded with many in Wright's Oak Park Studio, including Walter Burley Griffin, William Drummond, Barry Byrne, Isabel Roberts, and A.C. Tobin (brother of Wright's wife, Catherine). With the exception of Tobin, <b>all</b> <b>would</b> go on to independent careers as Prairie School architects.|$|E
25|$|The UK {{has a large}} {{variety of}} {{different}} intermediate- and high-level radioactive wastes, coming from national programmes {{to develop nuclear weapons}} and nuclear power. It is a national responsibility to pay for the management of these. In addition, new nuclear power stations could be built, the waste management from which would be the private sector's financial responsibility, although <b>all</b> <b>would</b> be stored in a single facility. Most of the UK's higher-activity radioactive waste is currently held in temporary storage at Sellafield.|$|E
