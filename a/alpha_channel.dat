25|$|PNG gives a {{much wider}} range of {{transparency}} options than GIF, including <b>alpha</b> <b>channel</b> transparency.|$|E
25|$|The {{number of}} {{channels}} depends on whether the image is grayscale or color and whether it has an <b>alpha</b> <b>channel.</b> PNG allows the following combinations of channels, called the color type.|$|E
25|$|Although {{support for}} PNG format came slowly, new web browsers {{generally}} support PNG. Older versions of Internet Explorer {{do not support}} all features of PNG. Versions 6 and earlier do not support <b>alpha</b> <b>channel</b> transparency without using Microsoft-specific HTML extensions. Gamma correction of PNG images was not supported before version 8, and the display of these images in earlier versions may have the wrong tint.|$|E
5000|$|Renderer {{supporting}} fog, infinite, {{local and}} spot lights, anti-aliasing, <b>alpha</b> <b>channels</b> and depth channels ...|$|R
5000|$|B44A: An {{extension}} to B44 where areas of flat color are further compressed, such as <b>alpha</b> <b>channels.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Anime Studio {{supports}} several file formats {{to import}} pictures and video. <b>Alpha</b> <b>channels</b> of PNG and video files are recognised.|$|R
25|$|PNG {{offers a}} variety of {{transparency}} options. With true-color and grayscale images either a single pixel value can be declared as transparent or an <b>alpha</b> <b>channel</b> can be added (enabling any percentage of partial transparency to be used). For paletted images, alpha values can be added to palette entries. The number of such values stored may be less than the total number of palette entries, in which case the remaining entries are considered fully opaque.|$|E
25|$|The {{standard}} allows indexed color PNGs to have 1, 2, 4 or 8 bits per pixel; grayscale {{images with}} no <b>alpha</b> <b>channel</b> may have 1, 2, 4, 8 or 16 bits per pixel. Everything else uses a bit depth per channel of either 8 or 16. The combinations this allows {{are given in}} the table above. The standard requires that decoders can read all supported color formats, but many image editors can only produce a small subset of them.|$|E
500|$|The Graphics Group, {{which was}} {{one-third of the}} Computer Division of Lucasfilm, was {{launched}} in 1979 with the hiring of Catmull from NYIT, where {{he was in charge}} of the Computer Graphics Lab. He was then reunited with Smith, who also made the journey from NYIT to Lucasfilm, and was made director of The Graphics Group. At NYIT, the researchers pioneered many of the CG foundation techniques—in particular the invention of the <b>alpha</b> <b>channel</b> (by Catmull and Smith). Years later, the CGL produced a few frames of an experimental film called The Works. After moving to Lucasfilm, the team worked on creating the precursor to RenderMan, called REYES (for [...] "renders everything you ever saw") and developed a number of critical technologies for CG—including [...] "particle effects" [...] and various animation tools.|$|E
50|$|In {{computer}} graphics, XOR-based drawing {{methods are}} often used to manage such items as bounding boxes and cursors on systems without <b>alpha</b> <b>channels</b> or overlay planes.|$|R
50|$|Although related (due {{to being}} used for the same purposes), {{transparent}} colors and <b>alpha</b> <b>channels</b> are techniques which do not involve the image pixel mixage by binary masking.|$|R
50|$|Critters {{see with}} a 16 x 16 retina grid by default, though this value may be changed. Each pixel in the grid {{is able to}} see red, green, blue and <b>alpha</b> <b>channels.</b>|$|R
2500|$|PNG {{supports}} palette-based images (with palettes of 24-bit RGB or 32-bit RGBA colors), grayscale images (with {{or without}} <b>alpha</b> <b>channel</b> for transparency), and full-color non-palette-based RGB/RGBA images (with or without <b>alpha</b> <b>channel).</b> PNG {{was designed for}} transferring images on the Internet, not for professional-quality print graphics, and therefore does not support non-RGB color spaces such as CMYK. [...] A PNG file contains a single image in an extensible structure of [...] "chunks", encoding the basic pixels and other information such as textual comments and integrity checks documented in RFC 2083.|$|E
2500|$|... bit value 4: {{the image}} samples also contain an <b>alpha</b> <b>channel</b> {{expressed}} as a linear measure of the opacity of the pixel. [...] This is not valid in combination with bit value 1.|$|E
2500|$|... tRNS {{contains}} transparency information. For indexed images, it stores <b>alpha</b> <b>channel</b> {{values for}} one or more palette entries. For truecolor and grayscale images, it stores a single pixel value {{that is to be}} regarded as fully transparent.|$|E
25|$|The dual link HD {{interface}} supports 1080/60p, 1080/59.94p, and 1080/50p, {{as well as}} 4:4:4 encoding, greater color depth, RGB encoding, <b>alpha</b> <b>channels,</b> and nonstandard resolutions (often {{encountered in}} computer graphics or digital cinema).|$|R
50|$|The GIF and PNG image formats use <b>alpha</b> <b>channels</b> on the World Wide Web {{to merge}} images on web pages {{so that they}} appear to have an {{arbitrary}} shape even on a non-uniform background.|$|R
50|$|Initially, GDI {{supported}} 16 and 256 color EGA/VGA display {{cards and}} monochrome printers. The functionality has expanded over the years, and now includes support {{for things like}} TrueType fonts, <b>alpha</b> <b>channels,</b> and multiple monitors.|$|R
2500|$|In August 2017, JTC1/SC29/WG1 {{issued a}} Call for {{proposals}} on JPEG XL - {{the next generation}} of image compression standard with substantially better compression efficiency (60% improvement) comparing to JPEG. The standard is expected to follow performance by HEVC HM, Daala and WebP. The core requirements include support for animated images, [...] 8-10 bits per component, and <b>alpha</b> <b>channel</b> coding. [...] The standard should also offer high-quality compression of synthetic images, such as bitmap fonts and gradients, higher bit depths (12-16 bit and floating point) for improved dynamic range, wide color gamut using different color spaces (including Rec.2020/2100 and LogC), and lossless <b>alpha</b> <b>channel</b> encoding. Any patented technologies would be licensed on a royalty-free basis. The proposals should be submitted by April 2018, with current target publication date in early 2020.|$|E
2500|$|Whereas GIF {{is limited}} to 8-bit indexed color, PNG gives a much wider range of color depths, {{including}} 24-bit (8 bits per channel) and 48-bit (16 bits per channel) truecolor, allowing for greater color precision, smoother fades, etc. [...] When an <b>alpha</b> <b>channel</b> is added, up to 64 bits per pixel (before compression) are possible.|$|E
2500|$|An image being edited in GIMP can {{consist of}} many layers in a stack. The user manual {{suggests}} that [...] "A {{good way to}} visualize a GIMP image is as a stack of transparencies," [...] where in GIMP terminology, each transparency is a layer. Each layer in an image {{is made up of}} several channels. In an RGB image, there are normally 3 or 4 channels, each consisting of a red, green and blue channel. Color sublayers look like slightly different gray images, but when put together they make a complete image. The fourth channel that may be part of a layer is the <b>alpha</b> <b>channel</b> (or layer mask). This channel measures opacity where a whole or part of an image can be completely visible, partially visible or invisible. Each layer has a layer mode that can be set to change the colors in the image.|$|E
50|$|In April 2004, Chasys Draw Artist was {{released}} to the public via the internet for the first time (version 1.27). The release was done via betanews). In 2005, Chasys Draw underwent major user interface changes as well as internal changes. By December of that year, the project had reached version 1.63. This was the first version to introduce advanced features such as anti-aliasing. It was also the first version with full support for <b>alpha</b> <b>channels.</b> The CD5 image format was also upgraded to version 2, adding advanced compression, full <b>alpha</b> <b>channels,</b> encryption and metadata. Version 1.63 was the first version to win an IEEE (Kenya chapter) award in ICT.|$|R
50|$|GD {{can create}} images {{composed}} of lines, arcs, text (using program-selected fonts), other images, and multiple colors. Version 2.0 adds support for truecolor images, <b>alpha</b> <b>channels,</b> resampling (for smooth resizing of truecolor images), {{and many other}} features.|$|R
50|$|Although related (due to {{they are}} used for the same purposes), image bit masks and <b>alpha</b> <b>channels</b> are {{techniques}} which not involve the use of palettes nor transparent color at all, but off-image added extra binary data layers.|$|R
2500|$|Skins: Skins are bitmap files which {{alter the}} {{aesthetic}} {{design of the}} Winamp graphical user interface (GUI) and can add functionality with scripting. Winamp published documentation on skin creation in 1998 {{with the release of}} Winamp 2 and invited Winamp users to publish skins on Winamp.com. [...] As of 2000 there were nearly 3,000 Winamp skins available. The ability to use skins contributed to Winamp's popularity early in MP3 development. With the increasing number of available skins, genres or categories of skins developed, such as [...] "Stereo", [...] "Anime", and [...] "Ugly". Online communities of skin designers such as 1001Skins.com and Skinz.org have contributed thousands of designs; also at GnomeArt. Designers see skins as an opportunity to be creative: nontraditional examples have included Klingon, iPod, and Etch-a-sketch designs. The Winamp skin format is the most popular, the most commonly adopted by other media player software, and is usable across platforms. One example is the XMMS player for Linux and Unix systems, which can use unmodified Winamp 2 skin files. Winamp 5 supports two types of skins– [...] "classic" [...] skins designed to Winamp 2 specifications (static collections of bitmap images), and more flexible, freeform [...] "modern" [...] skins per the Winamp3 specification. [...] Modern skins support true <b>alpha</b> <b>channel</b> transparency, scripting control, a docked toolbar, and other innovations to the user interface.|$|E
50|$|The <b>alpha</b> <b>channel</b> stores {{transparency}} information—the {{higher the}} value, the more opaque that pixel is. No camera or scanner measures transparency, although physical objects certainly can possess transparency, but the <b>alpha</b> <b>channel</b> is extremely useful for compositing digital images together.|$|E
50|$|The <b>alpha</b> <b>channel</b> is {{normally}} {{used as an}} opacity channel. If a pixel has a value of 0% in its <b>alpha</b> <b>channel,</b> it is fully transparent (and, thus, invisible), whereas a value of 100% in the <b>alpha</b> <b>channel</b> gives a fully opaque pixel (traditional digital images). Values between 0% and 100% {{make it possible for}} pixels to show through a background like a glass, an effect not possible with simple binary (transparent or opaque) transparency. It allows easy image compositing.|$|E
50|$|One of the {{features}} of Audion that set it apart from its rivals, particularly SoundJam, was its user interface, which featured transparency through a process that mimicked the functionality of <b>alpha</b> <b>channels</b> on Mac OS 9's QuickDraw, a graphics system that did not support them.|$|R
50|$|PNG and TIFF {{also allows}} partial transparency, which solves the edge {{limitation}} problem. However, support {{is even more}} patchy. Internet Explorer prior to version 7 does not support partial transparency in a PNG graphic. Very few applications correctly process TIFF files with <b>alpha</b> <b>channels.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The BMP {{file format}} {{is capable of}} storing {{two-dimensional}} digital images both monochrome and color, in various color depths, and optionally with data compression, <b>alpha</b> <b>channels,</b> and color profiles. The Windows Metafile (WMF) specification covers the BMP file format. Among others [...] defines BMP constants and structures.|$|R
50|$|The codec {{supports}} <b>alpha</b> <b>channel</b> information.|$|E
5000|$|One file {{container}} {{format that}} can be used to store JPEG XR image data is specified in Annex A of the JPEG XR standard. It is a TIFF-like format using a table of Image File Directory (IFD) tags. A JPEG XR file contains image data, optional <b>alpha</b> <b>channel</b> data, metadata, optional XMP metadata stored as RDF/XML, and optional Exif metadata, in IFD tags. The image data is a contiguous self-contained chunk of data. The optional <b>alpha</b> <b>channel,</b> if present, can be compressed as a separate image record, enabling decoding of the image data independently of transparency data in applications which do not support transparency. (Alternatively, JPEG XR also supports an [...] "interleaved" [...] <b>alpha</b> <b>channel</b> format in which the <b>alpha</b> <b>channel</b> data is encoded together with the other image data in a single compressed codestream.) ...|$|E
50|$|Google WebP {{also support}} Truecolor with <b>alpha</b> <b>channel</b> animation.|$|E
40|$|In {{vertebrate}} olfactory receptors, cAMP {{produced by}} odorants opens cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channels, which allow Ca(2 +) entry and depolarization of the cell. These CNG channels {{are composed of}} alpha subunits {{and at least two}} types of beta subunits that are required for increased cAMP selectivity. We studied the molecular basis for the altered cAMP selectivity produced by one of the beta subunits (CNG 5, CNCalpha 4, OCNC 2) using cloned rat olfactory CNG channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Compared with alpha subunit homomultimers (<b>alpha</b> <b>channels),</b> <b>channels</b> composed of <b>alpha</b> and beta subunits (alpha+beta channels) were half-activated (K(1 / 2)) by eightfold less cAMP and fivefold less cIMP, but similar concentrations of cGMP. The K(1 / 2) values for heteromultimers of the alpha subunit and a chimeric beta subunit with the alpha subunit cyclic nucleotide-binding region (CNBR) (alpha+beta-CNBRalpha channels) were restored to near the values for <b>alpha</b> <b>channels.</b> Furthermore, a single residue in the CNBR could account for the altered ligand selectivity. Mutation of the methionine residue at position 475 in the beta subunit to a glutamic acid as in the alpha subunit (beta-M 475 E) reverted the K(1 / 2,cAMP) /K(1 / 2,cGMP) and K(1 / 2, cIMP) /K(1 / 2,cGMP) ratios of alpha+beta-M 475 E channels to be very similar to those of <b>alpha</b> <b>channels.</b> In addition, comparison of alpha+beta-CNBRalpha channels with alpha+beta-M 475 E channels suggests that the CNBR of the beta subunit contains amino acid differences at positions other than 475 that produce an increase in the apparent affinity for each ligand. Like the wild-type beta subunit, the chimeric beta/alpha subunits conferred a shallow slope to the dose-response curves, increased voltage dependence, and caused desensitization. In addition, as for alpha+beta channels, block of alpha+betaCNBRalpha channels by internal Mg(2 +) was not steeply voltage-dependent (zdelta approximately 1 e(-)) as compared to block of <b>alpha</b> <b>channels</b> (zdelta 2. 7 e(-)). Thus, the ligand-independent effects localize outside of the CNBR. We propose a molecular model to explain how the beta subunit alters ligand selectivity of the heteromeric channels...|$|R
50|$|Game Editor recognizes <b>alpha</b> <b>channels,</b> {{to enable}} {{animation}} transparencies. In {{the case of}} all images, it recognizes the top-left pixel's color as the transparent color, and finally, there's a transparency value you can modify to set literally how transparent the actor will be overall, which gives various possibilities for adding visual effects to your game, e.g.: fog.|$|R
40|$|Introduction In this sketch {{we present}} a new method for {{rendering}} large-scale, high-resolution, non-repetitive textures in real-time using multi layer texturing. The basic idea of spectral texturing is to construct the final texture by multiple texture layers where each layer provides a certain range of the spectrum of the texture's spatial frequencies. <b>Alpha</b> <b>channels</b> are used to introduce statistical dependencies between the frequency bands. This approach extends a method called detail texturing, which does not use <b>alpha</b> <b>channels</b> to model higher statistical properties of the resulting texture. Other approaches to generate textures with specified statistical properties, like [DeBonet 1997], are not suitable for real-time use and would require storage of the generated texture. Spectral texturing {{is very easy to}} implement, runs on all contemporary 3 d graphics cards, and is especially suitable for naturalistic textures in real-time applications which are viewed from a large range of di...|$|R
