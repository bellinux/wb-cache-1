5|$|Instead {{of solving}} {{for the two}} hyperbolas, Newton {{constructs}} their directrix lines instead. For any hyperbola, the ratio of distances from a point Z to a focus A and to the directrix is a fixed constant called the eccentricity. The two directrices intersect at a point T, and from their two known distance ratios, Newton constructs a line passing through T on which Z must lie. However, the ratio of distances TZ/TA is also known; hence, Z also lies on a known circle, since Apollonius had shown that a circle {{can be defined as}} the set of points that have a given ratio of distances to two fixed points. (<b>As</b> <b>an</b> <b>aside,</b> this definition is the basis of bipolar coordinates.) Thus, the solutions to Apollonius' problem are the intersections of a line with a circle.|$|E
5|$|The {{writing of}} Wheelwright's Brief and Plain Apology may have {{commenced}} {{as early as}} 1644 when Short Story was published, but based on datable events the last part was written after his vindication by the Massachusetts court in 1654. In {{the first half of}} this work, Wheelwright refers to the author of Short Story as a singular person, clearly thinking that Thomas Weld had written the entire piece. Later in his Apology, however, Wheelwright refers to the authors (plural) of Short Story, realizing that Weld was not alone in writing the material. Though Wheelwright mentions no author of Short Story by name other than Thomas Weld, he certainly had come to realize that the other author was John Winthrop, since the 1648 books by both Cotton and Rutherford mentioned this fact <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>aside.</b> Winthrop had died in 1649 with a reputation as an effective colonial leader, respected in both England and the colonies, and there was no rational reason for Wheelwright to impugn his good name.|$|E

25|$|By late Saturday afternoon, {{concerns}} were rising about driver safety on the track. Patrick Carpentier {{went to the}} medical facility to have his wrist checked (a previous injury he had suffered in a crash at Long Beach.) <b>As</b> <b>an</b> <b>aside,</b> he mentioned {{that he could not}} walk in a straight line for at least four minutes after he got out of his car. An impromptu survey was taken during the private drivers' meeting and 21 of the 25 drivers in the starting field reported suffering disorientation and vertigo-like symptoms, including inner ear, or vision problems, after running more than 10 laps (or 20 laps). They also claimed that they had had virtually no peripheral vision and limited reaction time. This was due to sustained g-loads as high as 5.5--almost double what most persons can endure, and closer to what jet pilots usually experience in shorter time intervals.|$|E

25|$|The killing {{has been}} dated to 1016, {{as this is}} the year it falls under in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, the Chronicle of John of Worcester and the Historia Regum. Historian A. A. M. Duncan has argued that this date is unreliable. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, {{reflecting}} closely the source for the Historia Regum and the Worcester Chronicle on this entry, does not say that Uhtred died in this year, merely adding <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>aside</b> that Uhtred and Thurcytel were later killed despite having submitted to Cnut in this year. The location of this killing is given as Wiheal. This has been identified as Wighill, a place just north-west of the Roman road north of Tadcaster but south of York. This identity however is far from secure, an alleged weak point being that the early spellings of Wighill (e.g. Wichele) do not resemble De Obsessiones Wiheal very closely. Another possibility is Worrall near Sheffield, spelled Wihala and Wihale in the Domesday Book.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, the Analogic Corporation {{developed}} The APL Machine, {{which was an}} array processing computer designed to be programmed only in APL. There were actually three processing units, the user's workstation, an IBM PC, where programs were entered and edited, a Motorola 68000 processor that ran the APL interpreter, and the Analogic array processor that executed the primitives. At {{the time of its}} introduction, The APL Machine was likely the fastest APL system available. Although a technological success, The APL Machine was a marketing failure. The initial version supported a single process at a time. At the time the project was discontinued, the design had been completed to allow multiple users. <b>As</b> <b>an</b> <b>aside,</b> an unusual aspect of The APL Machine was that the library of workspaces was organized such that a single function or variable that was shared by many workspaces existed only once in the library. Several of the members of The APL Machine project had previously spent a number of years with Burroughs implementing APL\700.|$|E

500|$|Gibson {{finds it}} painful {{to try to}} connect with the Victorian Singapore, of which few vestiges remained. In an attempt to uncover Singapore's {{underlying}} social mechanisms, the author searches fruitlessly for an urban underbelly, rising at dawn for jetlagged walks on several mornings only to discover that the city-state's [...] "physical past ... has almost entirely vanished". He gives an overview of the history of Singapore from the founding of modern Singapore by Sir Stamford Raffles in 1819 to the Japanese occupation and the establishment of the Republic in 1965. He concludes that modern Singapore, effectively a one-party state and capitalist technocracy, is a product first and foremost of the vision of three-decade Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew. <b>As</b> <b>an</b> <b>aside,</b> he quotes a headline from the South China Morning Post detailing the trial of a cadre of economists, a government official (current Deputy Prime Minister, Tharman) and a newspaper editor for divulging a state secret by revealing the Singaporean economic growth rate.|$|E
