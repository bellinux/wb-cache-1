The rabbit‟s {{creation}} can be {{an alternative to the}} production far-reaching animals. The rabbit meat is consumed in different world regions, being Europe the principal market. It has an elevated protein content associate to low cholesterol. The European Union presents approximately 54 % of the world-wide consumption of rabbit meat, being Italy the biggest consumer. China is the biggest producer of rabbit meat, being Europe at second place. Portugal is opened to new implementations of explorations of rabbit meat production, since the capacity of the <b>auto-provision</b> does not reach 100 %. It exists at present countless rabbits breeds, divided in function of the adult weight in: giant or big breeds, middle breeds, small breeds, and dwarf breeds. Two of the principal meat production breeds are the Californian and the New Zeeland. In the current production are normally used hybrids of improved lines where were represented these two breeds. The three principal diseases of the rabbit are particularly Myxomatoxis, Viral Hemorrhagic Disease (VHD) and epizootic rabbit enteropathy. The animals must be subject to a plan of vaccines with the advice of a veterinarian. The rabbits can begin his sexual behavior approximately to 3, 5 - 4 month‟s age. The best zootechnic results are obtained with a photoperiod of 16 horas of darkness and 8 horas of light (for the females), with a room temperature of 14 - 24 º C and moisture of 60 - 80 %. The handling in animals groups and the use of artificial insemination allows an organization of work on the rabbit‟s farm with a fixed day weekly for the principal activities, and it allows to group females in the same physiological state. The intensive exploration system (rest period minimum) makes difficult the females maintenance in good physical conditions leaving them more vulnerable. The artificial insemination 11 days after the childbirth (semi-intensive system) allows the maintenance of reproducers more time in reproduction because so manages to restore his physical reserves before next artificial insemination. The environmental factors can influence the animal‟s productivity and the control of these factors is very important in the production. So, from the type of the building, his direction, the animal density, temperature, moisture, light, ventilation, the food, etc., it can affect the economical results of a rabbit‟s exploration. There are different types of accommodation; they may be open-air, in semi-free-air, ship and classic ship industry. The orientation of housing is very important when using natural ventilation. The structure of the pavilions can be metal or in cement, the covering in plate (metal or cement) or of the type sandwich, the walls from cement or the type sandwich panels. The manure produced by rabbits can be withdrawn by water (elevated consumption of water), surface pit (cleaning of manual), deep pit (great accumulation of gases) and semi-deep pit (that is more used nowadays). The cleaning of the pits in the great explorations is automatic. The density of rabbits for cage in the fattening is of 15 rabbits for m 2, in the maternity of 0, 25 - 0, 3 for m 2 and in the substitution 0, 2 for m 2. The cages can be type flat-deck, Californian, battery, floor 1 + 1 / 2 or of 1 floor (these last ones are most used) ...|$|E

In 2009, Billerica Public Schools manager Mark Bishop explained that the Dial-Office solution was the most comprehensive among the IP-PBX options they evaluated. “In less than a few weeks, and {{at one of the}} lowest cost per extension in the district school, {{we were able to get}} a complete infrastructure setup. From DID management, CPE <b>Auto-provisioning,</b> customer Web interface we were able to focus on adding new extensions and relying on Dial-Office to deliver the rest," [...] said Bishop.|$|R
40|$|As the Internet {{is quickly}} {{evolving}} from best-effort networks {{to a very}} critical communications infrastructure that requires higher quality Internet services and the delivery of such communications services become competitive, large-scale NSPs or ISPs have to concern {{much more on the}} performance and efficient resource usages of their networks. This situation naturally leads the providers to seek a possible solution from traffic engineering (TE) methodologies. Also MPLS VPN can take advantage of TE for more reliable and efficient usage of the managed network resources. In this paper, we propose an integrated TE and VPN management solution for a large-scale MPLS-based IP autonomous system, which addresses TE and VPN management requirements such as the <b>auto-provisioning,</b> measurement, characterization, modeling and control of Internet traffic...|$|R

While {{it is not a}} new concept, code mobility has reentered the limelight because of its potential uses for cloud computing—a megatrend in recent years. The strongest form of mobility allows the execution state of a computational component to be captured and restored on another node where execution is seamlessly continued. Computation migration can achieve dynamic load balancing, improve data access locality, and serve as the enabling mechanism for <b>auto-provisioning</b> of cloud computing resources. Therefore, it is worthwhile to study the concepts behind computation migration and its performance in a multi-instance cloud platform. This chapter introduces a handful of migration techniques working at diverse granularities for use in cloud computing. In particular, this chapter highlights an innovative idea termed stack-on-demand (SOD), which enables ultra-lightweight computation migrations and delivers a flexible execution model for mobile cloud applications...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Cloud {{computing}} {{has drawn}} increasing {{attention from the}} scientific computing community due to its ease of use, elasticity, and relatively low cost. Because a high-performance computing (HPC) application is usually resource demanding, without careful planning, it can incur a high monetary expense even in Cloud. We design a tool called CAP 3 (Cloud <b>Auto-Provisioning</b> framework for Parallel Processing) to help a user minimize the expense of running an HPC application in Cloud, while meeting the user-specified job deadline. Given an HPC application, CAP 3 automatically profiles the application, builds a model to predict its performance, and infers a proper cluster size that can finish the job within its deadline while minimizing the total cost. To further reduce the cost, CAP 3 intelligently chooses the Cloud’s reliable on-demand instances or low-cost spot instances, {{depending on whether the}} remaining time is tight in meeting the application’s deadline. Experiments on Amazon EC 2 show that the execution strategy given by CAP 3 is costeffective, by choosing a proper cluster size and a proper instance type (on-demand or spot).
