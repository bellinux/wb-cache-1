25|$|At some point, Madame Montour and {{her family}} {{migrated}} to the province of Pennsylvania. Exactly when <b>and</b> <b>why</b> <b>she</b> moved is unclear. She may have been traveling between New York and Pennsylvania as early as 1714, when her husband Carondawana was appointed as the Iroquois spokesman for the Shawnee living in Pennsylvania. By 1727, she and Carondawana were living at Otstonwakin, a village also known as Otstuagy or French Town. The site of previous Native American villages, Otstonwakin was located along the Great Shamokin Path, at the important confluence of Loyalsock Creek with the West Branch Susquehanna River, {{on the west bank}} of the river. The modern borough of Montoursville developed on the east bank after the American Revolutionary War.|$|E

She stated that she knew nothing about vaccines and only got them for her son because the doctor recommended it. Her 8-week old son had always been happy and calm, but became extremely upset immediately after his first vaccination shot, the doctor when asked said that this was normal behavior. The next day he was back to normal and she waited for his 4-month visit which included more vaccination shots. After this he vomited which Messenger says he had never done before. The doctor suggested stopping breast-feeding and switch to juice which she did. The next day he started having seizures and convulsions.|$|E
25|$|Because {{healing is}} Ultima's mission, Antonio's {{relationship}} with her includes accompanying her to gather the curative herbs she knows about through tradition and spiritual revelation. With her Antonio visits the sick and begins to grasp a connection between healing and nature even though he never receives an explicit scientific or grounded explanation for how she foretells future occurrences, heals the infirm, combats witches through casting spells, or when <b>and</b> <b>why</b> <b>she</b> decides not to intervene. Ultima's indigenous and experiential pedagogy allows Antonio to intuit that her approach to healing includes a sense of who the afflicted person is, what s/he believes, knowledge of the healing powers of her herbs, {{and the limits of}} her power. He learns through assisting Ultima in the cure of his uncle that healing requires making himself vulnerable to sickness and to the spiritual as well as physical needs of the sick. With Antonio, Ultima's relationship as healer is also one of teacher. Cynthia Park considers the relationship between those two roles, and abstracts a set of life-giving principles that form the basis for Ultima's way of knowing.|$|E

In 1966 Livia Pargentino became the first native Sardinian Bahá'í. In August 1968 Ciocca {{was buried in the}} cemetery of Cagliari. In 1968 there was a public meeting in Sardinia which was also the subject of the local newspaper article. In November 1975 the local assembly of Cagliari held a booth at a 10-day fair on Sardinia as well as an observation of United Nations Day. In November 1975 a television talk program called Ore Venti out of Cagliari reviewed the religion. The interviewer opened the program with a reading from Gleanings from the Writings of Bahá'u'lláh. Alessandro Bausani then spoke {{of the history of the}} religion and explained Bahá'í administration. Another guest, Manuela Fanti, explained how <b>and</b> <b>why</b> <b>she</b> joined the religion. During the 25-minute interview Bausani stressed the universality of the religion by describing his recent trip to Bolivia. By summer 1976 Bahá'ís had been invited to address a number of religious studies classes in Cagliari and Alessandria, hour-long interviews had been granted on two Cagliari radio stations and an assembly was formed in Quartu Sant'Elena. In 1978 the Bahá'ís of Cagliari and Quartu Sant'Elena pooled resources to support a booth at the Trade Fair in 1978.|$|E

500|$|The {{character}} {{made her}} {{first appearance in}} [...] "The Naked Time" [...] following a re-write of the script by Roddenberry. He had been inspired after Barrett read a proposal for the episode [...] "What Are Little Girls Made Of?" [...] and bleached her hair blonde to better fit a role in that episode. The change of color caused Roddenberry to believe that NBC executives might not notice that Barrett had returned against their wishes. However, the executives immediately recognized Barrett. The character was featured in several episodes covering several broad themes, such as showing her feelings for Spock (Leonard Nimoy), <b>and</b> <b>why</b> <b>she</b> joined Starfleet. By the time of The Motion Picture, Chapel was a doctor and during the events of The Voyage Home, she was stationed at Starfleet Command.|$|E
500|$|Reviewers praised how Stead {{made every}} small detail matter. Augusta Scattergood of the Christian Science Monitor [...] enjoyed the {{detailed}} work: [...] "The beauty of Stead's writing {{is found in}} the way she weaves subplots and settings together seamlessly. Richard's stolen shoe drops into place. A reference to forbidden grapes is tied up sweetly. Stolen $2 bills? Another part of the enigma explained by the end." [...] Edginer agreed, commenting that despite the small size of the novel compared to other popular books, When You Reach Me is a [...] "taut novel, every word, every sentence, has meaning and substance." [...] Publishers Weekly added that even the smallest of details—Miranda's name, her strange habits <b>and</b> <b>why</b> <b>she</b> carries A Wrinkle in Time with her—have a reason for their inclusion {{by the end of the}} novel.|$|E

Seated on her armchair she did gymnastics wearing her stereo headset. Her exercises included flexing and extending the hands ("a distinguished woman must have beautiful hands"), then the legs, and her carers noted that she moved faster than the other residents, who were 30 years younger, despite her blindness.

500|$|Some sources {{describe}} {{the subjects of}} Lichtenstein's tragic girls series as heroines (in {{the sense that they}} are the counterparts to the heroes), and others do not (in the sense that they are not heroic). Drowning Girl is a painting of a female subject who would prefer to give in {{to the power of the}} ocean than call for aid. Lichtenstein's version of the scene eliminates everything but the sea and a few body parts of the subject: her head, shoulder and hand, which are barely above the water. As her face is presented her eyes are shut with drops of what appear to be tears flowing from them. Because Lichtenstein only presents a single frame, the viewer does not know what happened before this moment and what is going to happen after it.

500|$|Many of the Topolino Snow White comics {{were the}} works of Romano Scarpa. His 1986 comic [...] "The Seven Dwarfs and King Arbor's Crystal" [...] (I Sette Nani e il cristallo di Re Arbor) {{provides}} explanation how the Queen would have survived her apparent death in the film (as some branches and bushes eased the fall and she was rescued by her loyal guards) <b>and</b> <b>why</b> <b>she</b> could not change back to her normal self (as her castle was burned down by the Huntsman and her book of magic is gone). In this story, Grimhilde (Grimilde) enlists the aid of her great admirer and past suitor, the evil King Arbor of Vegetalia, in a plot to use a magic crystal device to swap her old body with Snow White's. The intrigue is foiled by the dwarves who destroy the crystal, and the resigned Arbor allows the Witch to live with her, saying {{he will try to}} remember she was [...] "the most beautiful among queens". The uneasy relationship between Grimhilde and Abor continued in the comic [...] "The Seven Dwarfs and the Fountainhead" [...] (I Sette nani e la fonte meravigliosa), in which she desperately attempts to regain her youth, but instead only turns into a childlike version of her Witch form for a short time.|$|E
500|$|Batwoman {{appears in}} the miniseries Cry for Justice, a set-up for a new ongoing Justice League title. When the Justice League of America splits up {{following}} Bruce Wayne's death and a disastrous confrontation with the Shadow Cabinet, Green Lantern Hal Jordan leads a group of superheroes to Gotham in order {{to track down the}} supervillain known as Prometheus. Kate is shown stalking the heroes from the rooftops after they encounter Clayface. Batwoman later contacts both Leagues at the JLA Watchtower, informing them she encountered and engaged supervillain Delores Winters, who mysteriously collapsed and died right as she was about to be taken into custody. The heroes request that Kate bring the body up to them, but she declines, telling them that she is much too busy due to a rash of criminal uprisings going on in Gotham. Firestorm is then sent to retrieve the corpse from Kate and bring it to the team, who discover that Dolores was forced into fighting by means of a mind control device. In a text piece included in [...] #6, writer James Robinson revealed that Batwoman was initially intended to be part of his new Justice League line-up, but this plan fell apart after Cry For Justice was shortened into a miniseries rather than an ongoing title. This explains why Batwoman is present {{on the cover of the}} first issue, <b>and</b> <b>why</b> <b>she</b> was initially said to be a member of the team when the book was first announced.|$|E
500|$|In 2003, Katherine and Jill were {{believed}} to be mother and daughter after Katherine's friend, Charlotte Ramsey, provided factual proof. Of the storyline, Walton stated: [...] "She's [...] going down a bad road. In looking back over the past 16 years, she's gone down a lot of bad roads, for a lot of different reasons. She'll survive this one and, hopefully, maybe this time she'll learn something from it." [...] She also described Jill as being in a [...] "soul-searching period" [...] during the storyline, saying: [...] "Now she's numbing herself with the alcohol because all those feelings of love are coming up for her mother, and she doesn't {{know how to deal with}} them." [...] Walton said she felt Jill had been [...] "shaken to the very foundation" [...] upon the revelation that Katherine is her mother, stating: [...] "A big part of who she has been all these years has to do with her anger towards Katherine. She always shoved any feeling of love down. Now, she's questioning everything about herself. That's why she is in such pain <b>and</b> <b>why</b> <b>she</b> is drinking. That hate thing is baseless now." [...] While admitting to having been surprised with the maternity revelation, Walton thought it was [...] "fabulous and rich, and it's opened up a whole new facet to the story". However, in 2009, the characters' history was rewritten by Maria Arena Bell; Charlotte had made up this information for revenge against Katherine, and they were not mother and daughter.|$|E
