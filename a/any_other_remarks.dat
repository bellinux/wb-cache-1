40|$|When plenary {{dates for}} an SC and for JTC 1 {{are out of}} phase, the SC chairman’s use of this section for {{updating}} JTC 1 on SC status is required {{as a means to}} reflect developments since the business plan was approved. This section may also be used for <b>any</b> <b>other</b> <b>remarks</b> the chairman believes pertinent in regards to the SC’s Business Plan, its projects, opportunities, risks or new initiatives. The SC 32 Plenary meeting ends the Friday before the JTC 1 committee meeting, so this business plan does not reflect the results of that meeting. It is expected that the meeting will be well attended and will continue the excellent progress described in this report. 1. 1 JTC 1 SC 32 STATEMENT OF SCOPE JTC 1 / SC 3...|$|E
60|$|With these words, uttered {{with great}} {{emphasis}} and emotion, brother Charles {{put on his}} broad-brimmed hat, and, passing Ralph Nickleby without <b>any</b> <b>other</b> <b>remark,</b> trotted nimbly into the street. Ralph looked after him, but neither moved nor spoke for some time: when he broke what almost seemed the silence of stupefaction, by a scornful laugh.|$|R
60|$|Accordingly, when Mr. Peggotty {{came home}} about nine o'clock, this unfortunate Mrs. Gummidge was {{knitting}} in her corner, {{in a very}} wretched and miserable condition. Peggotty had been working cheerfully. Ham had been patching up a great pair of waterboots; and I, with little Em'ly by my side, had been reading to them. Mrs. Gummidge had never made <b>any</b> <b>other</b> <b>remark</b> than a forlorn sigh, and had never raised her eyes since tea.|$|R
6000|$|Neelie was too business-like to make <b>any</b> <b>other</b> <b>remark,</b> on her side, {{than the}} {{necessary}} remark in the pocket-book. She made another entry under {{the head of}} [...] "Good": [...] "I am old enough to consent, and so is Allan too. Go on," [...] resumed Neelie, looking over the reader's shoulder. [...] "Never mind all that prosing of Blackstone's, about the husband being of years of discretion, and the wife under twelve. Abominable wretch! the wife under twelve! Skip to the third incapacity, if there is one." ...|$|R
60|$|And, {{considering}} the circumstances, that remark, as Charteris was at some pains {{to explain to}} him at the time, contained--when you came to analyse it--more cynical immorality to the cubic foot than <b>any</b> <b>other</b> half-dozen <b>remarks</b> he (Charteris) had ever heard in his life.|$|R

2500|$|In their day, both ships {{offered the}} most luxurious {{first-class}} passenger accommodations available. According to maritime historian Basil Greenhill, {{in his book}} Merchant Steamships, the interiors of Campania and Lucania represented Victorian opulence at its peak – an expression of a highly confident and prosperous age that would never be quite repeated on <b>any</b> <b>other</b> ship. Greenhill <b>remarked</b> that later vessels' interiors degenerated into [...] "grandiose vulgarity, the classical syntax debased to mere jargon".|$|R
5000|$|Should {{the reader}} decide to {{disregard}} the novel's interactive nature and read through it as <b>any</b> <b>other</b> book, he is presented with both immediate outcomes of the first decision and perspective then switches to the two doctors who are observing Keith; one confirms that this is Keith Marion, [...] "of Marion syndrome", and the <b>other</b> <b>remarks</b> that although {{he is in a}} coma, he looks [...] "quite ordinary", considering his symptoms.|$|R

6000|$|She had not again, for weeks, had Mrs. Assingham so effectually in {{presence}} {{as on the}} afternoon of that lady's return from the Easter party at Matcham; but the intermission was made up as soon as the date of the migration to Fawns--that of the more or less simultaneous adjournment of the two houses--began to be discussed. It had struck her, promptly, that this renewal, with an old friend, of the old terms she had talked of with her father, was the one opening, for her spirit, that wouldn't too much advertise or betray her. Even her father, who had always, as he would have said, [...] "believed in" [...] their ancient ally, wouldn't necessarily suspect her of invoking Fanny's aid toward any special inquiry--and least of all if Fanny would only act as Fanny so easily might. Maggie's measure of Fanny's ease would have been agitating to Mrs. Assingham had it been all at once revealed to her--as, for that matter, it was soon destined to become even on a comparatively graduated showing. Our young woman's idea, in particular, was that her safety, her escape from being herself suspected of suspicion, would proceed from this friend's power to cover, to protect and, as might be, even showily to represent her--represent, that is, her relation to the form of the life they were all actually leading. This would doubtless be, as people said, a large order; but that Mrs. Assingham existed, substantially, or could somehow be made prevailingly to exist, for her private benefit, was the finest flower Maggie had plucked from among the suggestions sown, like abundant seed, {{on the occasion of the}} entertainment offered in Portland Place to the Matcham company. Mrs. Assingham, that night, rebounding from dejection, had bristled with bravery and sympathy; she had then absolutely, she had perhaps recklessly, for herself, betrayed the deeper and darker consciousness--an impression it would now be late for her inconsistently to attempt to undo. It was with a wonderful air of giving out all these truths that the Princess at present approached her again; making doubtless at first a sufficient scruple of letting her know what in especial she asked of her, yet not a bit ashamed, as she in fact quite expressly declared, of Fanny's discerned foreboding of the strange uses she might perhaps have for her. Quite from the first, really, Maggie said extraordinary things to her, such as [...] "You can help me, you know, my dear, when nobody else can;" [...] such as [...] "I almost wish, upon my word, that you had something the matter with you, that you had lost your health, or your money, or your reputation (forgive me, love!) so that I might be with you as much as I want, or keep you with ME, without exciting comment, without exciting <b>any</b> <b>other</b> <b>remark</b> than that such kindnesses are 'like' me." [...] We have each our own way of making up for our unselfishness, and Maggie, who had no small self at all as against her husband or her father and only a weak and uncertain one as against her stepmother, would verily, at this crisis, have seen Mrs. Assingham's personal life or liberty sacrificed without a pang.|$|R

30|$|Sanday {{proposed}} {{an explanation of}} the correlations in terms of cognitive tendencies linking characteristics in the four dimensions, with the (leftmost) subsistence variable viewed as imposed by the environment rather than influenced by <b>any</b> of the <b>other</b> three. Though Sanday’s (Sanday PR 1981, ch. 3) most explicit statement claims that the direction of causation goes only from left to right in Table 2, <b>other</b> <b>remarks</b> show that she thought there were feedback relations between most of the four variables.|$|R
