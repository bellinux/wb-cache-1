5|$|Steph was {{introduced}} as Zara Morgan's (Kelly Greenwood) bitchy friend with {{a penchant for}} humiliating and bullying others. She was touted as a new student for Hollyoaks High and was the first character from the Dean family to be introduced into the series. Over time the character was joined by an on-screen family. She was not initially particularly close to her brothers and sister, although for many years she tried to maintain a relationship with them. Generally, her mother Frankie never had much time for Steph or her life, usually preferring to involve herself in the lives of Steph's brothers, Craig and Jake, or to boast <b>about</b> <b>her</b> <b>daughter</b> Debbie's professional singing prowess; in contrast Steph had a very close relationship with her father Johnno, who continually supported the family through a number of tough times over the years; however, Steph was hit very hard when he left Hollyoaks in 2005 after discovering that he had an illegitimate baby son.|$|E

500|$|Following Kurt Cobain's {{suicide in}} 1994, public and media {{interest}} in Love heightened, and her erratic onstage behavior and suspected drug problems during Hole's 1994–1995 world tour significantly exacerbated the media's critical observations of her. On July 4, 1995, at the Lollapalooza Festival in George, Washington, she punched musician Kathleen Hanna {{in the face}} after alleging {{she had made a}} joke <b>about</b> <b>her</b> <b>daughter.</b> Love was charged with assault, to which she pleaded guilty, and was sentenced to anger management classes. [...] In 1995, she was arrested in Melbourne for disrupting a Qantas Airways flight after getting into an argument with a stewardess. In a retrospective interview, Love stated that she could [...] "not remember much" [...] from the band's 1994–1995 tour, noting that she had been using both heroin and Rohypnol heavily at the time.|$|E
500|$|... "Frozen", {{the ninth}} track and album's first single, is a mid-tempo {{electronic}} ballad {{which has a}} layered sound enhanced by synthesizers and strings. The song additionally contains ambient qualities, a moderate dance rhythm during the chorus and techno-influenced beats towards the end. Madonna's vocals throughout the song lack vibrato, and have drawn comparisons to medieval music. Lyrically, the song is about a cold and emotionless man; nevertheless, subtexts have been noticed. According to Jarman-Ivens, lyrics such as [...] "You're frozen, when your heart's not open" [...] reflected an artistic palette, [...] "encompassing diverse musical, textual and visual styles in its lyrics." [...] "The Power Of Good-Bye" [...] is an emotional ballad which lyrically meditates on loss and longing. It was released as the album's fourth single. [...] "To Have and Not to Hold" [...] is about a distant lover and [...] "Little Star" [...] is <b>about</b> <b>her</b> <b>daughter,</b> Lourdes. Both are superficially vibrant but with underlying subtlety and restrained arrangements prevailing. [...] "Mer Girl", the album's final track, is a surreal meditation on mortality {{and the death of}} Madonna's mother, in which she sings, [...] "And I smelled her burning flesh/Her rotting bones, her decay/I ran and I ran/I'm still running away." ...|$|E

Olivia welcomed H.D. to her home, but she witnessed the interactions between Dorothy, Pound, H.D. and Richard Aldington, whom H.D. married in 1913. In September 1912 Olivia wrote a stern letter to Pound, in which she pointedly told him to break off his friendship with Dorothy:You {{told me you were}} prepared to see less of Dorothy this winter. I don't know if you wd rather leave it to me to say I don't think it advisable she should see so much of you etc. or whether you wd rather do it in your own way.... I don't know if she still considers herself engaged to you—but she obviously can't marry you—it's hardly decent!

She must marry—She & I can't possibly go on living this feminine life practically à deux for ever, & we haven't money enough to separate... You ought to go away—Englishmen don't understand yr American ways, & any man who wanted to marry her wd be put off by the fact of yr friendship (or whatever you call it) with her.

Poniatowska's {{extended}} family includes an archbishop, the primate of Poland, a musician, several writers and statesmen including Benjamin Franklin. Her aunt was the poet Pita Amor. She was raised in France by a grandfather who was a writer and a grandmother who would show her negative photos about Mexico, including photographs in National Geographic depicting Africans, saying they were Mexican indigenes, and scaring her and her siblings with stories about cannibalism there.

2500|$|... "Joanne" [...] was {{featured}} in documentary film, , which chronicled the recording of the parent album and the singer's life. In one of the scenes, the singer and her father visits her grandmother at the nursing home, {{so that she can}} listen to the track <b>about</b> <b>her</b> <b>daughter.</b> While Gaga's dad was [...] "overcome with emotion, [...] steps out of the room during the visit", her grandmother reassures the singer that she [...] "got it right" [...] with the song. Spencer Kornhaber from The Atlantic named it [...] "the most memorable scene of the documentary". Bonnie Stiernberg from Billboard thought that [...] "the film reaches an apex during [...] key scene", calling it [...] "an intimate single-camera shot that moves from Gaga's grandmother's face to her father to Gaga, who plays the song on her cellphone." [...] Leslie Helperin from The Hollywood Reporter also highlighted this part of the biography, writing that [...] "the scene in which she plays 'Joanne'... to her aged grandmother is particularly fascinating. Gaga clearly craves approval and validation from the elderly lady and seems to be pushing to create a cathartic drama out of the scene, but her grandmother seems resistant to all this emotional hyperbole, insisting that the loss is well in the past now."
