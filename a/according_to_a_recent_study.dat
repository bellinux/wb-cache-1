25|$|The {{associated}} {{period of}} massive carbon injection {{into the atmosphere}} has been estimated to have lasted no longer than 20,000 years. The entire warm period lasted for about 200,000 years. Global temperatures increased by 5–8°C. The carbon dioxide was likely released in two pulses, the first lasting less than 2,000 years. Such a repeated carbon release {{is in line with}} current global warming. A main difference is that during the Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum, the planet was essentially ice-free. However, the amount of released carbon, <b>according</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>recent</b> <b>study,</b> suggest a modest 0.2 gigatonnes a year (at peaks 0.58 gigatonnes), humans today add about 10 gigatonnes a year.|$|E
25|$|Vaginally dosed {{progesterone}} {{is being}} investigated as potentially beneficial in preventing preterm birth in women at risk for preterm birth. The initial study by Fonseca suggested that vaginal progesterone could prevent preterm birth in women {{with a history of}} preterm birth. <b>According</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>recent</b> <b>study,</b> women with a short cervix that received hormonal treatment with a progesterone gel had their risk of prematurely giving birth reduced. The hormone treatment was administered vaginally every day {{during the second half of}} a pregnancy. A subsequent and larger study showed that vaginal progesterone was no better than placebo in preventing recurrent preterm birth in women with a history of a previous preterm birth, but a planned secondary analysis of the data in this trial showed that women with a short cervix at baseline in the trial had benefit in two ways: a reduction in births less than 32 weeks and a reduction in both the frequency and the time their babies were in intensive care.|$|E
25|$|The baby-boomers of the 18301840's started joining massively the Monk Orders. One {{major factor}} was {{the decline in}} the {{revenues}} derived from silk in Jebbet Bsharri region that started around 1845. In 18441845, silk revenues were covering 72% of the economic needs decreasing to 25% in 18511852 and further to 15% in 1857. Along with an increased centralization of the administration under the new regime of Qaym-maqiyamatayn (18421860), it contributed to the weakening of the political and economical powers of the sheikhs in the region in general leaving no economic perspectives to the young people. Also, the opening of a school in the neighbouring village of Bane in 1806 by the Lebanese Maronite Order for the basic instruction of the children of Kfarsghab and Bane served as a channel of detection and recruitment of talents and workforce for the Order. The effect was a reduction in the Kfarsghab population. <b>According</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>recent</b> <b>study,</b> 344 males lived in Kfarsghab in 1862, that is to say 1,720 inhabitants.|$|E

500|$|Bach led {{the first}} performance, but its {{date has been}} debated. Dürr {{concluded}} initially (in {{the first edition of}} his book Die Kantaten von Johann Sebastian Bach of 1971) that the cantata was first performed on 6 October 1715, but this date fell in a period of public mourning in Weimar. In August 1715 the brother of Duke Ernst August died, only 18 years old, and the duke proclaimed six months of mourning in the Duchy of Weimar. Cantata performances were resumed sooner, with the 21st Sunday after Trinity on 10 November 1715. Now, the first performance of the work is generally accepted as the same occasion the following year, when the 16th Sunday after Trinity fell on 27 September 1716, by Wolff, the publisher Carus-Verlag, and Dürr in the revised and translated edition of 2006. Richard D. P.

Among the most significant resources are the many museums – Musei Capitolini, the Vatican Museums and the Galleria Borghese and others dedicated to modern and contemporary art – aqueducts, fountains, churches, palaces, historical buildings, the monuments and ruins of the Roman Forum, and the Catacombs. Rome is the third most visited city in the EU, after London and Paris, and receives an average of 7–10million tourists a year, which sometimes doubles on holy years.

2500|$|In {{addition}} to environmental and health costs at home, China's dependence on coal {{is cause for}} concern on a global scale.
