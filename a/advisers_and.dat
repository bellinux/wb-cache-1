5|$|Eli Lilly {{experienced}} dramatic growth during Daniels' {{tenure at}} the company. Prozac sales made up 30–40% of Lilly's income during the mid-to-late 1990s, and Lilly doubled its assets to $12.8 billion and doubled its revenue to $10 billion during the same period. When Daniels later became Governor of Indiana, he drew heavily on his former Lilly colleagues to serve as <b>advisers</b> <b>and</b> agency managers.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{the regime}} {{leadership}} intended to remold Solidarity into a compliant union, {{stripped of its}} intelligentsia <b>advisers</b> <b>and</b> compatible with the state socialist system. The failure to incite most ranking Solidarity leaders to collaborate, especially Wałęsa's refusal to extend any cooperation along this course of action, resulted in the government adopting the goal of total liquidation of the union movement.|$|E
5|$|Kann {{asserts that}} she {{nevertheless}} possessed qualities appreciated in a monarch: warm heart, practical mind, firm determination and sound perception.

Joseph, however, was never able to establish rapport with the same advisers, even though their philosophy of government was closer to Joseph's than to Maria Theresa's.|$|E

Henrietta eventually married Thomas Pelham-Holles, first Duke of Newcastle-upon-Tyne, in April 1717, and the rest of Sarah's grandchildren went on to make successful marriages.|$|E
5|$|That year, {{relations}} with Israel soured. Although Israel had previously supplied Uganda with arms, in 1972 Amin expelled Israeli military <b>advisers</b> <b>and</b> turned to Muammar Gaddafi of Libya and the Soviet Union for support. Amin became {{an outspoken critic}} of Israel. In return, Gaddafi gave financial aid to Amin. In the 1974 French-produced documentary film , Amin discussed his plans for war against Israel, using paratroops, bombers, and suicide squadrons.|$|E

5|$|Henry {{placed a}} {{symbolic}} emphasis on rebuilding royal authority, but his rule was relatively circumscribed by Magna Carta. He generally acted within {{the terms of}} the charters, which prevented the Crown from taking extrajudicial action against the barons, including the fines and expropriations that had been common under his father, John. The charters did not address the sensitive issues of the appointment of royal <b>advisers</b> <b>and</b> the distribution of patronage, and they lacked any means of enforcement if the King chose to ignore them. The inconsistency with which he applied the charters {{over the course of his}} rule alienated many barons, even those within his own faction.|$|E

He made staff members job descriptions more flexible, encouraging staff members to take the initiative to perform a wide range of tasks. A corporate day care system was established, allowing staff to bring their children to work. Staff members were allowed to take off as much time as needed to reestablish themselves and corporate dress codes were relaxed. The company brought in counselors, insurance experts, tax consultants, child care <b>advisers</b> <b>and</b> construction companies to help the staff reorient themselves.

5|$|Roosevelt won the 1940 presidential election. After Minton {{left office}} in January 1941, {{he was given}} a {{position}} in the Roosevelt administration as a reward for his loyalty during the court packing failure. He served as one of the president's <b>advisers</b> <b>and</b> a liaison between the White House and Congress. The extent of his duties is not fully known; Linda Gugin has speculated that he may have managed Roosevelt's patronage system. Minton was responsible for getting several officials appointed to high offices in the federal bureaucracy and numerous others appointed to lower ranking positions. He also convinced Roosevelt to support the creation of a Senate defense committee chaired by Truman, a position that brought Truman into the national spotlight and helped him gain the vice presidency.|$|E

5|$|A {{total of}} {{approximately}} 16,000 German citizens {{fought in the}} Civil War, mostly as pilots, ground crew, artillery men, tank crew, and as military <b>advisers</b> <b>and</b> instructors. About 10,000 Germans was the maximum strength at any one time. Approximately 300 Germans were killed. During {{the course of the}} war, Germany sent 732 combat aircraft and 110 trainer aircraft to Spain. German aid to the Nationalists amounted to approximately £43,000,000 ($215,000,000) in 1939 prices. This was broken down in expenditure to: 15.5% used for salaries and expenses, 21.9% used for direct delivery of supplies to Spain, and 62.6% expended on the Condor Legion. No detailed list of German supplies furnished to Spain has been found. Franco had also agreed to sign over the output of six mines to help pay for German aid.|$|E
5|$|After {{the death}} of Muhammad, many {{powerful}} Arab tribes broke away in open revolt against the rule of Medina. Caliph Abu Bakr sent his armies to counter the rebels and apostates. Khalid was one of Abu Bakr’s main <b>advisers</b> <b>and</b> an architect of the strategic planning of the Riddah wars. He was given the command over the strongest Muslim army and was sent towards central Arabia, the most strategically sensitive area where the most powerful rebel tribes resided. The region was closest to the Muslim stronghold of Medina and was {{the greatest threat to}} the city. Khalid first set out for the rebel tribes of Tayy and Jalida, where Adi ibn Hatim—a prominent companion of Muhammad, and a chieftain of the Tayy tribe—arbitrated, and the tribes submitted to the Caliphate.|$|E
5|$|As a result, {{despite a}} {{symbolic}} emphasis on royal power, Henry's rule was relatively circumscribed and constitutional. He generally acted within {{the terms of}} the charters, which prevented the Crown from taking extrajudicial action against the barons, including the fines and expropriations that had been common under John. The charters did not address the sensitive issues of the appointment of royal <b>advisers</b> <b>and</b> the distribution of patronage, and they lacked any means of enforcement if the King chose to ignore them. Henry's rule became lax and careless, resulting in a reduction in royal authority in the provinces and, ultimately, the collapse of his authority at court. The inconsistency with which he applied the charters {{over the course of his}} rule alienated many barons, even those within his own faction.|$|E

5|$|At the convention, held August 5–8, Agnew {{abandoned}} his favorite son status, placing Nixon's name in nomination. Nixon narrowly secured the nomination {{on the first}} ballot. In the discussions that followed about a running mate, Nixon kept his counsel while various party factions thought they could influence his choice: Strom Thurmond, the senator from South Carolina, told a party meeting that he held a veto on the vice presidency. It was evident that Nixon wanted a centrist, though there was little enthusiasm when he first proposed Agnew, and other possibilities were discussed. Some party insiders thought that Nixon had privately settled on Agnew early on, and that the consideration of other candidates {{was little more than}} a charade. On August 8, after a final meeting of <b>advisers</b> <b>and</b> party leaders, Nixon declared that Agnew was his choice, and shortly afterwards announced his decision to the press. Delegates formally nominated Agnew for the vice presidency later that day, before adjourning.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time as the {{artillery}} bombardment at KSCB, an attack was launched against Khe Sanh village, seat of Huong Hoa District. The village, three kilometers south of the base, was defended by 160 local troops, plus 15 American <b>advisers</b> <b>and</b> heavy artillery provided from the base. At dawn of 21 January, it was attacked by a roughly 300-strong NVA battalion. Reinforcements were dispatched aboard nine UH-1 helicopters, but were wiped out after landing near the NVA, along with one helicopter. A small ground rescue force from the nearby combat base was repulsed, while the survivors from the village assault evacuated themselves to the combat base. The NVA fought throughout the day, into the next night, and finally completed the capture of Khe Sanh village at 09:30 on 22 January.|$|E
5|$|Australian {{forces were}} at times {{involved}} in heavy fighting, and significant actions included Operation Anaconda in 2002 and Operation Perth in 2006, {{as well as}} actions in Chora in 2007, Kakarak in 2009, the Shah Wali Kot and Derapet in 2010, and Doan in 2011; although others {{have yet to be}} publicly acknowledged due to operational security requirements.

Four Australians have been awarded the Victoria Cross for Australia, the first such decorations in forty years. Following a drawdown in forces, the last combat troops were withdrawn on 15 December 2013; however, approximately 400 personnel remain in Afghanistan as trainers and <b>advisers,</b> <b>and</b> are stationed in Kandahar and Kabul.
