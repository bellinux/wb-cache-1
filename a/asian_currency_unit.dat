The basket feature of the RCU yields benefits and costs. First, the use of the RCU central rate can make the intervention burden of a central bank less onerous than the use of a bilateral exchange rate. Also, for any given band of margins, a basket unit offers more flexibility than a bilateral exchange rate. Another advantage of using the RCU is that the variance of RCU exchange rates is smaller than the variance of exchange rates of component countries. However, the usefulness of the RCU as a unit of account for domestic transactions and contracts will be very limited because of information costs and uncertainty about the value of the RCU. Also, theintroduction of the RCU raises the important problem of asymmetry for foreign exchange market intervention. Once such a problem is solved, the RCU can be then used as a divergence indicator to monitor the exchange rates of <b>Asian</b> <b>currencies</b> between themselves and against the US dollar or the euro. The creation of the RCU {{is a good way to}} coordinate policies and assure exchange stability between <b>Asian</b> countries.

This paper examines the specific issue of the ACU which, in a general sense, is a weighted average of regional currencies a la the European Currency Unit (ECU) which was created in March 1979 under the European Monetary System (EMS). The paper critically examines the rationale for the ACU proposal and offers an initial attempt at computing optimal currency composition of the ACU. The optimal basket weights computed are aimed at ensuring a regional currency basket that has minimal variance. Hence it will deliver stability in intra-regional exchange rates for alternative configurations of currency baskets in the Asian and Pacific region.

In addition, the use of regional currency baskets for surveillance can lead to potentially serious N- 1 problems in circumstances when there is not agreement about which regional currencies will be the anchor currencies.
