5|$|Viruses are {{the most}} {{abundant}} biological entity in aquatic environments—there are about one million of them in <b>a</b> <b>teaspoon</b> <b>of</b> seawater—and they {{are essential to the}} regulation of saltwater and freshwater ecosystems. Most of these viruses are bacteriophages, which are harmless to plants and animals. They infect and destroy the bacteria in aquatic microbial communities and {{this is the most important}} mechanism of recycling carbon in the marine environment. The organic molecules released from the bacterial cells by the viruses stimulate fresh bacterial and algal growth.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>teaspoon</b> <b>of</b> {{seawater}} {{contains about}} 50 million viruses. Most {{of these are}} bacteriophages, which are harmless to plants and animals, and are in fact essential to the regulation of marine and freshwater ecosystems; however, they are also important mortality agents of phytoplankton, {{the base of the}} foodchain in aquatic environments. They infect and destroy bacteria in aquatic microbial communities, and {{are one of the most}} important mechanisms of recycling carbon and nutrient cycling in marine environments. The organic molecules released from the dead bacterial cells stimulate fresh bacterial and algal growth, in a process known as the viral shunt. Viral activity may also affect the biological pump, the process whereby carbon is sequestered in the deep ocean.|$|E

2500|$|Efamol {{continued}} to ship EPO into the United States and to market its products. In a 1989 article on [...] "health food frauds", the New York Times {{reported on the}} FDA's seizure of [...] "more than $1 million worth" [...] of illegal EPO. The FDA again accused Efamol of marketing the oil [...] "with unsubstantiated claims of treating {{a wide variety of}} illnesses". [...] Efamol's lawyers responded that the product was not dangerous and that it had not made unsubstantiated claims. The American Dietetic Association, representing over 50,000 nutritionists, questioned the value of Horrobin's product since [...] "one-tenth of <b>a</b> <b>teaspoon</b> <b>of</b> ordinary corn oil has as much of the fatty acids as a capsule of Evening Primrose Oil, {{at a fraction of the}} cost". In 1989, the FDA commissioned a report by investigator Stephen Barrett, a medical doctor and consumer protection advocate. Barrett advised the FDA that Horrobin's marketing of Efamol was done in [...] "a transparent attempt to evade the food and drug laws". In a report on the incident published by the consumer information organisation Quackwatch, Barrett also questions Horrobin's research ethics: [...] "Would someone that contemptuous of the law have any qualms about faking data?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Oral {{rehydration}} solution (ORS) (a slightly sweetened {{and salty}} water) {{can be used}} to prevent dehydration. Standard home solutions such as salted rice water, salted yogurt drinks, vegetable and chicken soups with salt can be given. Home solutions such as water in which cereal has been cooked, unsalted soup, green coconut water, weak tea (unsweetened), and unsweetened fresh fruit juices can have from half a teaspoon to full teaspoon of salt (from one-and-a-half to three grams) added per liter. Clean plain water can also be one of several fluids given. There are commercial solutions such as Pedialyte, and relief agencies such as UNICEF widely distribute packets of salts and sugar. A WHO publication for physicians recommends a homemade ORS consisting of one liter water with one teaspoon salt (3 grams) and two tablespoons sugar (18 grams) added (approximately the [...] "taste of tears"). Rehydration Project recommends adding the same amount of sugar but only one-half <b>a</b> <b>teaspoon</b> <b>of</b> salt, stating that this more dilute approach is less risky with very little loss of effectiveness. Both agree that drinks with too much sugar or salt can make dehydration worse.|$|E

Now unharness the remains of a once cow from the plow, insert them in a hydraulic press, and when you shall have acquired <b>a</b> <b>teaspoon</b> <b>of</b> that pale-blue juice which a German superstition regards as milk, modify the malignity of its strength in a bucket of tepid water and ring up the breakfast.

50|$|If {{a recipe}} calls for <b>a</b> level <b>teaspoon</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> dry {{ingredient}} (salt, flour, etc.), this {{refers to an}} approximately leveled filling of the spoon, producing the same volume as for liquids. <b>A</b> rounded <b>teaspoon</b> is <b>a</b> larger but less precise measure, produced without leveling the ingredient off or heaping it as high as possible. A heaping or heaped <b>teaspoon</b> is <b>a</b> larger inexact measure consisting of the amount obtained by scooping the dry ingredient up without leveling it off. For some ingredients, e.g. flour, this quantity can vary considerably.|$|R

Flavored milk advocates claim that many children will avoid the nutrition found in milk unless it has been flavored, with the benefits of milk outweighing <b>a</b> few <b>teaspoons</b> <b>of</b> sugar. Opponents say that with rising levels of obesity and heart disease, flavored milk should be removed from schools and children should be taught to drink regular milk.|$|R

25|$|Pure {{sucralose}} {{is sold in}} bulk, but not in quantities {{suitable for}} individual use, although some highly concentrated sucralose–water blends are available online. These concentrates contain one part sucralose for each two parts water. <b>A</b> quarter <b>teaspoon</b> <b>of</b> concentrate substitutes for one cup of sugar. Pure, dry sucralose undergoes some decomposition at elevated temperatures. In solution or blended with maltodextrin, it is slightly more stable.

50|$|Antibubbles usually pop {{when they}} touch the bottom or {{the side of}} the vessel {{containing}} the liquid. This can be prevented by tipping <b>a</b> few <b>teaspoons</b> <b>of</b> sugar into the soapy water and giving it some time to dissolve (but without stirring it). This will produce a denser layer of sugary water {{at the bottom of the}} container. Antibubbles made from sugar solution will then sink through the water and rest on top of the denser layer at the bottom. Antibubbles made this way can last for several minutes.|$|R

25|$|The {{storage of}} pasta {{depends on how}} far along it is processed. Uncooked pasta is kept dry and can sit in the {{cupboard}} for a year if airtight and stored in a cool, dry area.

Adding <b>a</b> couple <b>teaspoons</b> <b>of</b> oil helps keep the food from sticking to itself and the container. If the cooked pasta is not used in the five days it may be frozen for up to two or three months. The pasta will start to dry after a period of time, but it varies with the type of pasta.
