Considering the increasing concern of individual privacy nowadays, anonymous <b>password</b> <b>authentication</b> represents a promising privacy-preserving authentication primitive. How-ever, anonymous <b>password</b> <b>authentication</b> in the standard setting has several inherent weaknesses, making its practicality questionable. In this paper, we propose a new and efficient ap-proach for anonymous <b>password</b> <b>authentication.</b> Our approach assumes a different setting where users do not register their passwords to the server; rather, they use passwords to protect their authentication credentials.

Our experimental results confirm that conventional anonymous <b>password</b> <b>authentication</b> does not scale well, while our new scheme demonstrates very good performance.

40|$|Abstract — User {{authentication}} {{is essential}} for customized services and privileged access control in wireless sensor network. In 2009, Das proposed a novel two-factor authentication scheme for wireless sensor network, where a user must prove the possession of both a password and a smart card. His scheme is well-designed for sensor nodes which typically have limited resources {{in the sense that}} its authentication procedure requires no public key operations but it utilizes only cryptographic hash function. In this letter, we point out that Das’s protocol is vulnerable to an offline password guessing attack, and also show a countermeasure to overcome the vulnerability without sacrificing any efficiency and usability. Besides the patch, we suggest a method to protect query response messages from wireless a sensor node to a user, which is necessary in serving a user in a confidential and authentic way.

40|$|Abstract—It {{has become}} much easier to crack a {{password}} hash with the advancements in the graphicalprocessing unit (GPU) technology. An adversary can recover a user’s password using brute-force attack on password hash. Once the password has been recovered no server can detect any illegitimate user authentication (if there is no extra mechanism used). In this context, recently, Juels and Rivest published a paper for improving the security of hashed passwords. Roughly speaking, they propose an approach for user authentication, in which some false passwords, i. e., “honeywords” are added into a password file, in order to detect impersonation. Their solution includes an auxiliary secure server called “honeychecker ” which can distinguish a user’s real password among her honeywords and immediately sets off an alarm whenever a honeyword is used. In this paper, we analyze {{the security of the}} proposal and provide some possible improvements which are easy to implement.

The S/KEY scheme, which is closely based on a scheme devised by Lamport, [5], has been designed to provide users with `one-time passwords', which can be used to control user access to remote hosts. Of course, as with any such system, after the user authentication process is complete, i. e. after the one-time password has been sent across the network, no protection is offered against subversion of the link by third parties.
