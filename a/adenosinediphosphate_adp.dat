No other structurcs of the endothelial cell showed activity under the conditions employed. Thesc findings {{are discussed in}} relation to reccnt concepts of transport across the capillary wall. A number of histochemical studies have established that the nucleotide substrates, adenosinetriphosphate (ATP), <b>adenosinediphosphate</b> (<b>ADP),</b> and adenosinemonophosphate (AMP) are hydrolyzed in {{the walls of the}} small blood vessels (1 - 5).

40|$|The whole {{activity}} {{cycle of}} muscle can be reproduced in glycerol-extracted muscle fibers by suspending them in solutions containing adenosinetriphosphate (ATP) and certain ions, particularly Mg and Ca ions (1). Quantitatively, however, the {{agreement between the}} responses of normal and extracted muscle fibers is disappointing. Relaxation induced by ATP in extracted muscle fibers is too slow and {{is associated with a}} high rate of P liberation. Also, in the contracted state enzymatic activity is much lower in extracted than in normal muscle (2). In the search for a better reconstruction of muscular activity the action of phosphocreatine (PC) was investigated. Indeed, this substance was found to intensify the actions of ATP to a surprising degree, to increase the tension of contracted fibers, and to accelerate relaxation. The interpretation of these phenomena which will be presented here is based on the accepted view that PC does not directly furnish energy for contraction, but is important for the rapid phosphorylation of adenosinemonophosphate (AMP) and <b>adenosinediphosphate</b> (<b>ADP).</b> Beyond that, the study of the effects of PC has led to th...|$|E
40|$|Dual {{antiplatelet}} {{therapy with}} aspirin and thienopyridines {{is the cornerstone}} {{in the treatment of}} patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and in those undergoing PCI with stent-implantation. However, the magnitude of on-treatment platelet reactivity is not uniform among individuals, due to a multifactorial origin including clinical, pharmacologic and genetic factors. Clopidogrel is a prodrug that requires conversion by hepatic P 450 isoenzymes to its active metabolite. Most of the clopidogrel (85 %) is hydrolyzed by carboxylase to an inactive carboxylic acid metabolite, whereas the remaining 15 % is transformed rapidly into its active metabolite that is able to exert its antiplatelet response by irreversibly inhibiting the binding of <b>adenosinediphosphate</b> (<b>ADP)</b> to the P 2 Y 12 receptor. Recently, paraoxonase- 1 (PON 1) was identified as the crucial enzyme in clopidogrel bioactivation. Consistent findings across multiple investigations support the association between a lower degree of platelet inhibition, i. e. a high on-treatment platelet reactivity (HPR), and an increased risk for the occurrence of thrombo-ischemic events (Table 1). 9 - 14, 14, 15, 15 - 27 Multiple factors have been associated with high on-treatment platelet reactivity, among which genetic polymorphisms of cytochrome P 450 and of the P 2 Y 12 receptor as well as and drug-drug interactions. Consequently, the monitoring of the magnitude of platelet reactivity has gained widespread attention...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: Platelets {{are known}} blood cells differentiatedfrom megakaryocytes in bone marrow and they playa {{key role in}} {{coagulation}} mechanism. They live severaldays in blood circulation and they aggregate in respondto stimulants such as thrombin, collagen, <b>ADP</b> (<b>adenosinediphosphate)</b> and epinephrine. Although platelets areknown anucleated cells, {{it has been reported}} in vivo andin vitro that they undergo to apoptosis. In this study apoptoticeffects of ADP on the platelets was investigated. Materials and methods: P-selectin binding with flowcytometry,calcium levels with fluorometer, cytochrome-clevels with ELISA, caspase- 3 gene expression with qRTPCR,caspase- 3 releasing with western blotting were determinedin platelets. Results: Platelets were incubated for 1 hour at 37 °C with 10 μM ADP. P-selectin binding, calcium and cytochromeclevels, caspase- 3 releasing and gene expression aresignificantly increased compared to control in ADP stimulatedplatelets. Conclusions: Platelets can induce caspase- 3 gene expressionwhen stimulated with ADP which is a key enzymeplays an important role in apoptotic pathway.

40|$|In {{the course}} of {{studying}} synthetic processes associated with mitochondria of insects, {{it was found that}} the preparations contain enzymes which presumably could interfere with synthesis by breaking down ATP. 1 A systematic investigation of the dephosphorylating mechanisms was therefore undertaken in order to ascertain the significance of such opposing reactions. With the possible exclusion of the enzymes found in mammalian mnscles which split phosphate from ATP, the nature of this activity in tissues remains partially obscure. Dephosphorylation of ATP by liver mitochondria has been reported by Kielley and Kielley (1951) and Novikoff et al. (1952). Swanson (1951) characterized "soluble " ATPase obtained from the supernatant of liver fractions. A "soluble " ATPase from muscle has also been described by Kielley and Meyerhof (1948). Meyerhof and Ohlmeyer (1952) achieved a 50 -fold purification of yeast ATPase. Pyro-pase activity has also been found in yeast (Bailey and Webb, 1944), in liver (Swanson, 1952), and in other tissues. These few data are admittedly insufficient for a satisfactory resolution of the mechanism of dephosphorylation in mammalian tissues, and in insects practically nothing is known of adenine nucleotide breakdown; in fact, the mere presence of ATP in insects has only recently been affirmed by Albaum and Kletzkin (1948) and Calaby (1951), while the dephosphorylation of ATP has been but briefly noted. Gilmour (1948) found a soluble enzyme derived from grasshopper myosin extracts which splits both labile phosphates from the ATP molecule. He also noted that grasshopper muscle contains an enzyme which hydrolyzes inorganic Pyro-P. An apyrase was observed in cockroach muscle homogenates by Barton and Tahmisian (1948) and Chin (1951). The latter claimed that his preparation was specific for ATP in so far as no phosphorns was split from H-P or Gly-P. x The following abbreviations will be used: ATP, adenosinetriphosphate, <b>ADP,</b> <b>adenosinediphosphate,</b> AMP, muscle adenylic acid, Pyro-P, inorganic pyrophosphate, Gly-P, glycerol phosphate, H-P, hexose phosphate, G-l-P, glucose-l-phosphate...|$|R
40|$|Hexokinase {{was first}} {{described}} by Meyerhof (2), who prepared the enzyme from baker's yeast and demonstrated its stimulatory {{effect on the}} fermentation of hexoses by muscle extracts. Through the experiments of yon Euler and Adler (3), and Meyerhof (4), it was estabfished that this enzyme catalyzes a transfer of phosphate from adenosinetriphosphate (ATP) to hexoses, thus initiating the fermentation or oxidation of the latter. Colowick and Kalckar (5) showed that only the terminal phosphate group of ATP was transferred to hexose, and demonstrated that the primary products of the reaction were <b>adenosinediphosphate</b> (<b>ADP)</b> and hexose- 6 -phosphate. The reaction catalyzed by yeast hexokinase may thus be written as follows: [...] ATP + hexose [...] * ADP-t- hexose- 6 -phosphate In the present paper a method is described for the isolation of hexokinase in highly purified form from baker's yeast. Glucose, fructose, and mannose are all acted upon by the enzyme, but the rate of phosphorylation varies with the sugar used. The turnover number, when the phosphate aceeptor is glucose, is 13, 000 moles of substrate per 10 s gin. of protein per minute at 30 ° and pH 7. 5 and is not changed by repeated crystallization of the enzyme. The specific activity is approximately 30 {{times that of the}} crude yeast extract, indicating that hexokinase constitutes about 3 per cent of the extracted protein. Measurement of tIexokinase Activity The manometric method described by Colowick and Kalckar (5) was adopted. The method is {{based on the fact that}} one acid equivalent is liberated per mole of phosphate transferred from ATP to glucose.
