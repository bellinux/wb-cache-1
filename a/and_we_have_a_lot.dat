2500|$|The Huskies, with a 5–2–1 {{record to}} this point, entered their November 4–5 home series against Minnesota State ranked #16 in the USCHO.com poll. It {{was the first}} time the team had been nationally ranked in four years. The first game turned into a [...] "battle [...] two hot goaltenders", and the only goal {{occurred}} on a Michigan Tech power play when Ryan Furne's 90‑foot shot toward Mavericks goaltender Austin Lee [...] "took a strange hop just outside the crease" [...] and crossed the goal line. Minnesota State failed to score on six power play opportunities and Josh Robinson stopped all 29shots. In the second game, Huskies goals from Jacob Johnstone, Blake Pietila and Tanner Kero were matched by Minnesota State, and the game was tied 3–3 after two periods. The Mavericks took advantage of Michigan Tech's penalties and sloppy defensive play in the third period and scored two more goals against Josh Robinson, plus an empty-net goal, to win the game 6–3.

5000|$|For years, A&B Sound {{maintained}} a {{reputation in the}} western Canadian music market for having the lowest prices and best selection on records, cassettes, and later, CDs. Often, the chain would out-price other major retailers, including A&A Records and Tapes, as well as Toronto-based Sam the Record Man, which was unable to penetrate the Vancouver market with as much success {{as it had in}} eastern Canada. A downtown Vancouver location of Sam the Record Man was located next door to A&B Sound's Seymour Street location until late in 2000, when it was closed. In a 1993 article in The Georgia Straight newspaper, it is noted that A&B Sound's aggressive pricing policies resulted in Vancouver having the lowest record prices of any Canadian metropolis. These low prices were not only blamed for the failures of other chains, but may have been one reason for some chains not opening stores in Vancouver, including Tower Records, which had scouted Vancouver as a possible location to expand into Canada. When HMV finally opened stores in the Vancouver area in 1993, HMV Canada's then-president, Paul Alofs, said that breaking into the Vancouver market would be difficult.

40|$|The airport seems {{busier than}} usual. It is not {{actually}} crowded, but {{everyone seems to}} be moving faster. Announcements are so frequent as to be virtually continuous. They seem to wash over me like waves on a beach. As each one begins, there is a momentary feeling of anticipation, until it becomes clear that it does not concern my flight, {{and the rest of the}} announcement just continues on to the shore, crashing on the beach, producing only random noise. Images pass by as I hurry on. There are advertisements, TV monitors, views of airplanes landing and taking off. But I have seen them all before and no longer notice. Newsstands, souvenir shops, restaurants briefly assault me with images and sounds, but simply wash by on the fringe of consciousness. And people. A flight must have just arrived at a gate ahead of me, as a wall of people advances toward me like the tide coming in. As they approach, their individual personalities dissolve, becoming anonymous obstacles in my path. Moving against the flow, a vague feeling of recognition almost breaks the surface of my consciousness, but doesn’t quite make it. Still I turn to look without knowing exactly why. Then I see my friend. We recognize each other seemingly simultaneously. In a moment, I have all but forgotten my flight, and I am transported back to a time years ago. Somehow we completely lost contact. The crowd has thinned, and we approach each other. It is good to meet again. We wander into a restaurant I didn’t even notice as I passed it a few minutes earlier.

It certainly is swell of you folks {{to think of}} us fellows like that when you don’t even know us. The College paper arrived here last week and I read about your Service Club but didn’t expect that I’d ever hear from you. You folks are certainly doing your part to help win this war, if you’re doing work like that. It helps a fellow quite a bit when {{he knows that the}} people back home are taking an interest in his welfare. The army isn’t bad at all, once you get used to it. I’ve been in 15 months now and I don’t regret it even a little bit. It does a fellow a lot of good to get out on his own, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of fun too. Of course things are much more serious now than they were during my first ten months here, but still we have no complaints. Maybe you’d be interested in knowing just how and where I’ve spent my time. From Feb. 12 to May 30 of last year, I was stationed in Camp Blanding, Fla. Which is about 40 miles from Jacksonville. Then the army sent me to the Medical Service School at Fort Sam Houston, San Antonio, Texas, for two months. During August and September we were in Louisiana on maneuvers. In October I was home on furlough for ten days, and November found us in the Carolinas on more maneuvers. December and January we spent at Blanding with time out for another furlough, then in February we were transferred to this present camp. So you see, we do travel quite a bit {{at the expense of the}} government. As a whole, we eat pretty fair too, so what have we to complain about? It’s a great life, and although I don’t want to make a career of it, I’ve enjoyed army life. Once more I wish to extend my thanks for the package. By the way, it certainly came at the right time too, because as you probably know, the 10 th of each month is the time when most soldiers start to believe that they must have a hole in their pockets. Here’s wishing you all the best of luck and hoping you enjoy that nice long (???) vacation this summer. Sincerely, P. F. C. Willard Seaton 							Co. A 118 Med Bn.

40|$|It is {{with great}} {{pleasure}} that I herewith present the first African Library Summit Report, 2011. This Report {{is one of}} three significant publications that have seen the light as part of the African Library Summit endeavours to communicate and disseminate Summit information. It is presented in two parts, namely part one that contains the Summit background and details and part two which indicates the Summit outcomes. Two important sister documents are the Framework for African Library Development: Outcomes of the African Library Summit, and the Summit proceedings. The idea to host an African Library Summit was born from the continuous need expressed by Library colleagues that a forum should be established where leaders in our profession may collaborate, share, discuss and address the issues and realities confronting African librarianship. My work with IFLA and the international breadth of its vision further informed my reflection on how to address this need. These two factors, together with my experience of the cumulative speed of change in our profession over the last thirty years (the future is upon us) and the responsibility of steering several libraries through that change, was the inspiration for the African Library Summit. The Summit was conceived as a forum that would not only bring about the connection needed between library leaders across the continent, but as a forum for a practical outcome {{in the form of an}} action plan that would offer guidance and direction for the future of our profession and the quality of the services we deliver. The African Library Summit might have remained a visionary dream if it were not for the generosity of our donors who supported the Summit. It is therefore likely that our donors will hear us express our gratitude for many years to come. A seed was sown and in time it will grow into a mighty and fruitful tree with roots right across the African continent. Employees everywhere will tell you of the benefits gained when people meet together if only over a cup of mid-morning tea. However, as the Summit has shown, when people meet with intention the benefits are even greater. I would also like to thank all those who contributed to the organisation of the Summit. The efforts were deeply appreciated as the delegates’ standing ovation, received by those of you who could be present on the last day, will attest. Last but not least, I thank all our distinguished guests, speakers, provocateurs and delegates for their participation in this event and for taking time out from your demanding responsibilities to reflect and debate on the future direction of African librarianship. The candid and vibrant discussions, and the action plan we created together will stand us in good stead. Our work is just beginning <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> to do, but we take strength from making this journey together. I am sure we are all looking forward to continue the debate in a follow up Summit in future. IFLA, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Carnegie Corporation of New Yor...|$|E
40|$|In {{a country}} where 30 % of the {{population}} still believes that man made climate change is a myth, president Obama has made a daring effort to help fix the damage our country has already inflicted on our planet. By creating The Clean Power Plan (CPP) we’ve taken {{a step in the}} right direction as a country. The action that we take to limit our emissions within the next 10 years will likely determine the course of the rest of our existence. In our current situation humanity has no choice other than to act, and act quickly. We have passed the point of proactivity and have entered a time period of catching up. <b>And</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of catching up to do. Climate change is not only one of the most controversial topics of our generation, but also one of the most important problems we need to solve. Our window of opportunity to act is getting smaller everyday. Many of the projected consequences of climate change are predicted for 2050, a mere 34 years away. President Obama has created and proposed the CPP in an effort to take action. His plan aims to reduce America’s emissions by 32 % by 2030. This would put us below our emission levels from 2005. Reducing the carbon emissions from power plants in our country alone will prevent up to 3, 600 premature deaths, 1, 700 heart attacks, 90, 000 asthma attacks in children, and 300, 000 missed work and schooldays according to ucsusa. org. The economic impact will also be beneficial to our country. The transition to renewable energy will create tens of thousands of American jobs, which will come at a crucial time for our country. Renewable energy has also already proven to be economical and switching over to more renewable sources will lower the cost even more. Ucsusa. org estimates that the CPP could save the average American family nearly $ 85 per year on energy bills by 2030 and would save enough energy to power over 30 million homes. The CPP has been criticized for not being extensive enough. In {{a country where}} some of the most influential politicians believe that anthropogenic climate change is a hoax or that we’re just experiencing global cyclical warming periods, any progressive piece of legislation in the green energy sector is monumental. Obama has had to work across bipartisan lines and has shown great leadership and compromise skills in making this piece of legislation. We live in a country where we are given the opportunity to participate in the political process, and we should take pride in having the ability to support politicians that are working to reduce the damage humans are inflicting on our planet. President Obama’s plan has also been criticized for not being realistic, but many states have already proven that they are interested and dedicated to the idea of transferring over to green energy. Twenty-nine states already have policies in place to increase electricity from renewable sources like wind and solar. State level responsibility has proven to be crucial with other pieces of legislation such as the Clean Air Act. States are more familiar with the unique problems they face and can have a better understanding of how to solve them. The CPP allows for flexibility within the states and cooperation with other states to meet their goals. This is important and will increase the plan’s chance of success. The CPP quantifies the global social cost of carbon emissions, not just domestic costs. This behavior of global awareness will be the key to humanity’s continued survival on this planet. This global approach also sets a vital standard for the governments of other nations to consider the impacts of their greenhouse gas emissions on a planetary scale. The political impact alone of this plan has a magnitude that far outreaches the monetary value of reducing our carbon emissions. By allowing states to set flexible, unique goals for themselves but also allowing for cooperation amongst states it will do more than just reduce our global impact. I believe this plan allows for our country to unify and work towards a common goal while also imbedding a sense of patriotism that our country needs. Americans can take pride in being world leaders in the fight against global warming. We can proudly set the example for other nations to follow. Our planet’s climate has no boundaries and changes will affect everyone living here on Earth. Our world leaders need to step up and set the standard for global mindfulness and cooperation. Obama is making progressive strides towards this by implementing the Clean Power Plan. It is also vital that as constituents, we support government officials and legislation that promotes green energy and global awareness. I believe that the Clean Power plan will go down in history as one of the most impactful actions of our generation...|$|E
