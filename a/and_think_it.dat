And, you know, it was a major problem. A flat tire's nothing compared to that. And everybody who would pass would laugh <b>and</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> was so funny you know, me stumbling along.|$|E
500|$|LeMond has {{consistently}} questioned {{the relationship between}} riders and unethical sports doctors like Ferrari, and {{has pointed out that}} doping products ultimately victimize the professional cyclists who make use of them. Said LeMond: [...] "When I speak out about doping people could translate it <b>and</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> was about the riders. Actually I feel like I am an advocate for the riders. I look at them as being treated like lab rats that are test vehicles for the doctors. The doctors, the management, the officials, they're the ones that have corrupted riders. The riders are the only ones that pay the price." ...|$|E
500|$|Lazarus has {{received}} positive reviews since its debut. According to review aggregator Comic Book Roundup, critics gave {{the first issue}} an average score of 8.7/10 based on 32 reviews. The series as a whole averages 8.6/10 based on 284 reviews. Critics and fans often praise the world-building in Lazarus, but Lark and Rucka see it as secondary <b>and</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> receives too much focus. Publishers Weekly said Forever's [...] "fascinating complexity" [...] made Lazarus stand out from other graphic novels. Writing for Comics Alliance, KM Bezner said every character, including the diabolical ones, displayed humanity and [...] " [...] the lines between shades of morality". On Broken Frontier, Tyler Chin-Tanner described 'Lift', the series' second story arc, as [...] "a moving tale of family sacrifice". The series has appeared on many comic critics' [...] "best of" [...] lists. Since the series debut, the pace has been a frequent point of criticism.|$|E

500|$|In his {{autobiography}} released {{a few years}} later, Gerrard reflected that Liverpool were fortunate to win, but was critical of Arsenal's [...] "bitter" [...] reaction: [...] "Wenger and Ljungberg kept complaining about the hand-balls. Get real, boys. That's football. Grow up." [...] He reserved special praise for his opponent Vieira however, saying {{a few days after}} the game: [...] "It was my job to try and stop him, but he definitely got the better of me that day. He's such a great player. He's so fit, and he dictates the pace of a game. There are a lot of things you can learn just by watching him." [...] Assessing his career in a column for the Telegraph, Owen wrote that winning the cup was [...] "...the best day of my career, the game I look back on more than any other <b>and</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> was the most exhilarating experience I ever had playing football." ...|$|E
500|$|Included in the Australian squad to tour England in 1888, Trott was {{selected}} in the team for the First Test at Lord's. He had an inauspicious Test debut: he made a duck in the first innings and three runs in the second, and did not bowl. [...] The Australians won the game by 62runs, only their second Test match victory in England. [...] However, England retained The Ashes by winning the remaining two Tests and Trott's influence on the series was negligible: he did not pass 20 in an innings, and he failed to take a wicket. [...] Nevertheless, his performances in the other matches of the season prompted Wisden Cricketers' Almanack to write that he, [...] "...fully justif his selection by scoring the highly creditable total of 1,212runs, {{with an average of}} over 19 per innings", and that his fielding was [...] "excellent at point". [...] Wisden was less complimentary about his bowling: [...] "We have no great opinion of Trott's leg break bowling, <b>and</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> probably too slow to be effectual against good batsmen." [...] Trott's opportunities were limited as his teammates Charles Turner and John Ferris, [...] "monopolised the bowling".|$|E
500|$|Aston saw Time Team as an {{extension}} of his work as an extramural tutor, telling a 2013 interviewer that it was [...] "a way of reaching 3 million people rather than 30 people in the village hall." [...] Commenting on the popularity of Time Team, and its role in exposing the British public to archaeology, in a 2010 interview Aston remarked that [...] "My motive was to get {{as many people as possible}} interested in archaeology, because we [...] all enjoy it <b>and</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> interesting. That was my personal aim... and on that basis I think it is a success." [...] Time Team encouraged wider public interest in archaeology and led to increasing numbers of students applying to study archaeological courses at British universities, while subscriptions to Current Archaeology magazine quadrupled to 18,000 in the show's first five years. In autumn 1998, Channel 4 started a Time Team fan club, which had 16,000 members within a few months, while Aston became a supporter of the Council for British Archaeology's Young Archaeologists' Club (YAC), and with Harding gave regular talks to YAC branches. Aston found himself giving up to 20 public lectures a year on the subject of Time Team, describing the public feedback as [...] "embarrassingly encouraging".|$|E

[...] Meanwhile, another agent brings down Gay Wellington from upstairs, singing drunkenly. At that point, the fireworks in the basement go off, lit by De Pinna's discarded pipe, and everyone (aside from Grandpa and Wellington) panics, leaving the whole house in an uproar as Act II ends.|$|E

He was escorted on the death-walk by the prison chaplain, who was reading aloud from The Consolations of Religion about the fires of hell. Peace burst out [...] "Sir, if I believed what you and the church of God say that you believe, even if England were covered with broken glass from coast to coast, I would walk over it, if need be, on hands and knees <b>and</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> worth while living, just to save one soul from an eternal hell like that!" ...|$|E

[...] "This is probably better set up for nightclubs and other sorts of scenarios where {{the people that are}} receiving the message, one, would know what it's about, but also two, wouldn't be frightened," [...] he said. [...] "You know, if you put these in certain environments, like public spaces in this post-9/11 sensitivity, then of course you're going to wind up in trouble." [...] Make magazine editor Phillip Torrone said the advertisers should have used better judgment, but called the Mooninite board a [...] "neat electronic project." [...] As reported by Boing Boing, the media and the State of Massachusetts insisted on maintaining the use of the words [...] "bomb hoax" [...] when describing the event, despite Turner Broadcasting Systems' firm contentions that the devices were not intended to resemble bombs and the company had no intent to arouse suspicion or panic in approving the advertising campaign.|$|E
2500|$|It {{emerged during}} the trial that Nelson's sister Laura Anne had been shown Zoe's body by Bayne {{on the morning after}} her murder, but had kept this {{information}} from the police for five days. Laura Anne, who gave her evidence from behind a screen to prevent her from seeing Bayne, did not relay the information until she made her third statement to the police on 28 May, the day of Bayne's arrest. Laura Anne said that she had gone to Bayne's address on the morning after Nelson disappeared in order to return some articles of clothing to him. When she arrived she said he appeared [...] "jumpy" [...] and was drinking vodka. Shortly after that, the two had left the house and Bayne told her he had [...] "something to show her". She said that he led her to the area where he had killed Nelson and pointed out the blackened body. She said she knew it was her sister because she recognised a Rangers F.C. tattoo on her arm. In her statement she said: [...] "At Monkey Hill Rab said to me 'I hit her with my hands. She tried to hit me back.' Rab also said 'I burned her with petrol.'" [...] She testified in court that she had kept silent because she was terrified of Bayne, although Neil Murray QC, for the defence, produced other police statements in court in which she denied she had been threatened, admitted she had been out with Bayne on the day after the body was discovered, and had also subsequently visited Bayne and spent some time in his bedroom listening to music. She also spent about an hour on the telephone to him. A friend also [...] "described her as happy and normal" [...] during the period of silence. When asked why she hadn't told the police when she was first interviewed, she said: [...] "I did not tell them about this because I was scared my mum would not believe me <b>and</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> was me who killed Zoe." [...] Bayne's grandmother testified that on the day the body was discovered, Laura Anne did not visit and he did not leave the house except to go with her to a local supermarket.|$|E
