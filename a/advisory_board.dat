40|$|While <b>advisory</b> <b>boards</b> {{have been}} around for a long time, they have become rather commonplace in Silicon Valley (USA) in the past decade.

The purpose of this research is to explore and to discover how <b>advisory</b> <b>boards</b> operate in practice. A number of tentative conclusions arise from this investigation, which can provide guidance to entrepreneurs in the composition and disposition of <b>advisory</b> <b>boards,</b> and also offer clues to future researchers for topics requiring more focused and in‐depth inquiry...|$|R
