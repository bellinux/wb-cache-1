It was found, similar to 4 -hexylresorcinol, that oxyresveratrol could effectively inhibit browning in cloudy <b>apple</b> <b>juices</b> at a concentration as low as 0. 01 % and that mulberry twig extract also showed remarkable antibrowning effects on cloudy <b>apple</b> <b>juices.</b> However, for fresh-cut apples slices, mulberry twig extract and oxyresveratrol needed {{to be used in}} combination at least with ascorbic acid to exhibit their antibrowning effects. Apple slice samples treated by dipping in a solution containing 0. 001 M oxyresveratrol, 0. 5 M isoascorbic acid, 0. 05 M calcium chloride, and 0. 025 M acetylcysteine did not undergo any substantial browning reaction for 28 days at 4 °C.

5|$|Even a {{slightly}} dehydrated horse is {{at higher risk}} of developing impaction colic. Additionally, dehydration can lead to weight loss because the horse cannot produce adequate amounts of saliva, thus decreasing the amount of feed and dry forage consumed. Thus, {{it is especially important}} for horse owners to encourage their horses to drink when there is a risk of dehydration; when horses are losing a great deal of water in hot weather due to strenuous work, or in cold weather due to horses' natural tendency to drink less when in a cold environment. To encourage drinking, owners may add electrolytes to the feed, additives to make the water especially palatable (such as <b>apple</b> <b>juice),</b> or, when it is cold, to warm the water so that it is not at a near-freezing temperature.|$|E

The analyses encompassed 23 chemical parameters and phenolics profiles. The most important parameter, differentiating cloudy juice from clear juice, was turbidity. Cloudy juices were characterised by having an average total turbidity of 1, 210 Nephelometric Turbidity Units (NTU) and a stability of turbidity of 42 %. Some {{of the results}} deviated from the accepted ranges given in reference values for <b>apple</b> <b>juices</b> in the Code of Practice of the European Fruit Juice Association.
