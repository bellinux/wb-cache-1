Based on an extensive literature survey of corrosion data, three stainless steel alloys (304 L, 316 L, AL- 6 XN), four nickel-based alloys (825, 625, 690, G- 30), and titanium were selected for testing. The {{corrosion tests}} included vapor phase, liquid junction (interface), liquid immersion, and crevice corrosion tests on plain and welded samples of candidate materials. Tests were conducted at 80 {degrees}C for 45 days in two different test solutions: a nitric acid solution. to simulate evaporator conditions during the processing of the cesium ion-exchange eluant and a highly alkaline sodium hydroxide solution to simulate the composition of Tank 241 -AW- 101 during evaporation. All of the alloys exhibited excellent corrosion resistance in the <b>alkaline</b> <b>test</b> solution. Corrosion rates were very low and localized corrosion was not observed. Results from the nitric acid tests showed that only 316 L stainless steel did not meet our performance criteria. The 316 L welded interface and crevice specimens had rates of 22. 2 mpy and 21. 8 mpy, respectively, which exceeds the maximum corrosion rate of 20 mpy. The other welded samples had about the same corrosion resistance as the plain samples. None of the welded samples showed preferential weld or heat-affected zone (HAZ) attack.

40|$|The Hanford Waste Treatment and Immobilization Plant (WTP) Low Activity Waste (LAW) {{vitrification}} {{facility will}} generate an aqueous condensate recycle stream, LAW Off-Gas Condensate, from the off-gas system. The baseline plan for disposition of this stream {{is to send}} it to the WTP Pretreatment Facility, where it will be blended with LAW, concentrated by evaporation and recycled to the LAW vitrification facility again. Alternate disposition of this stream would eliminate recycling of problematic components, and would enable de-coupled operation of the LAW melter and the Pretreatment Facilities. Eliminating this stream from recycling within WTP would also decrease the LAW vitrification mission duration and quantity of canistered glass waste forms. This LAW Off-Gas Condensate stream contains components that are volatile at melter temperatures and are problematic for the glass waste form. Because this stream recycles within WTP, these components accumulate in the Condensate stream, exacerbating their impact on the number of LAW glass containers that must be produced. Approximately 32 % of the sodium in Supplemental LAW comes from glass formers used to make the extra glass to dilute the halides to be within acceptable concentration ranges in the LAW glass. Diverting the stream reduces the halides in the recycled Condensate and is a key outcome of this work. Additionally, under possible scenarios where the LAW vitrification facility commences operation prior to the WTP Pretreatment facility, identifying a disposition path becomes vitally important. This task examines the impact of potential future disposition of this stream in the Hanford tank farms, and investigates auxiliary evaporation to enable another disposition path. Unless an auxiliary evaporator is used, returning the stream to the tank farms would require evaporation in the 242 -A evaporator. This stream is expected to be unusual because it will be very high in corrosive species that are volatile in the melter (chloride, fluoride, sulfur), will have high ammonia, and will contain carryover particulates of glass-former chemicals. These species have potential to cause corrosion of tanks and equipment, precipitation of solids, release of ammonia gas vapors, and scale in the tank farm evaporator. Routing this stream to the tank farms does not permanently divert it from recycling into the WTP, only temporarily stores it prior to reprocessing. Testing is normally performed to demonstrate acceptable conditions and limits for these compounds in wastes sent to the tank farms. The primary parameter of this phase of the test program was measuring the formation of solids during evaporation in order to assess the compatibility of the stream with the evaporator and transfer and storage equipment. The origin of this LAW Off-Gas Condensate stream will be the liquids from the Submerged Bed Scrubber (SBS) and the Wet Electrostatic Precipitator (WESP) from the LAW facility melter offgas system. The stream {{is expected to be a}} dilute salt solution with near neutral pH, and will likely contain some insoluble solids from melter carryover. The soluble components are expected to be mostly sodium and ammonium salts of nitrate, chloride, and fluoride. This stream has not been generated yet, and, thus, the composition will not be available until the WTP begins operation, but a simulant has been produced based on models, calculations, and comparison with pilot-scale tests. This report discusses results of evaporation testing of the simulant. Two conditions were tested, one with the simulant at near neutral pH, and a second at alkaline pH. The neutral pH test is comparable to the conditions in the Hanford Effluent Treatment Facility (ETF) evaporator, although that evaporator operates at near atmospheric pressure and tests were done under vacuum. For the <b>alkaline</b> <b>test,</b> the target pH was based on the tank farm corrosion control program requirements, and the test protocol and equipment was comparable to that used for routine evaluation of feed compatibility studies for the 242 -A evaporator. One of the radionuclides that is volatile in the melter and expected to be in high concentration in this LAW Off-Gas Condensate stream is Technetium- 99 (99 Tc). Technetium will not be removed from the aqueous waste in the Hanford WTP, and will primarily end up immobilized in the LAW glass by repeated recycle of the off-gas condensate into the LAW melter. Other radionuclides that are also expected to be in appreciable concentrations in the LAW Off-Gas Condensate are 129 I, 90 Sr, 137 Cs, and 241 Am. The concentrations of these radionuclides in this stream will be much lower than in the LAW, but they will still be higher than limits for some of the other disposition pathways currently available. At this time, these scoping tests did not evaluate the partitioning of the radionuclides to the evaporator condensate, since ample data are available separately from other experience in the DOE complex. Results from the evaporation testing show that the neutral SBS simulant first forms turbidity at ~ 7. 5 X concentration, while the alkaline-adjusted simulant became turbid at ~ 3 X concentration. The major solid in both cases was Kogarkoite, Na 3 FSO 4. Sodium and lithium fluorides were also detected. Minimal solids were formed in the evaporator bottoms until a substantial fraction of liquid was removed, indicating that evaporation could minimize storage volume issues. Achievable concentration factors without significant insoluble solids were 17 X at alkaline pH, and 23 X at neutral pH. In both runs, significant ammonia carried over and was captured in the condenser with the water condensate. Results also indicate that with low insoluble solids formation in the initial testing at neutral pH, the use of Reverse Osmosis is a potential alternate method for concentrating the solution, although an evaluation is needed to identify equipment that can tolerate insoluble solids. Most of the ammonia remains in the evaporator bottoms during the neutral pH evaporation, but partitions to the condensate during alkaline evaporation. Disposition of both streams needs to consider the management of ammonia vapor and its release. Since this is an initial phase of testing, additional tasks related to evaporation methods are expected to be identified for development. These tasks likely include evaluation and testing of composition variability testing and evaluations, corrosion and erosion testing, slurry storage and immobilization investigations, and evaporator condensate disposition...|$|E
40|$|Texturing {{of silicon}} wafers is an {{important}} process step in fabrication of solar cells {{in order to reduce}} the reflection of incoming light radiation on the solar cell surfaces. The conventional wet chemical etching methods have clear limitations in etching and texturing of multicrystalline silicon (mc-Si) wafers. Chemical etching of mc-Si wafers in alkaline solutions results in a coarse and non uniform surface morphology since the dissolution rate depends on the grain orientation. In contrast to alkaline etching, textures formed by acidic etchants (HF+HNO 3) are uniform. However, acidic etching is difficult to control, the disposal of the waste is expensive and the method is in general environmentally hazardous. The aim of this thesis is to study an environmentally friendly etching method, which is supposed to be an alternative to acidic texturing of both single and multicrystalline B-doped silicon wafers. The method is based on anodic polarization of Si in alkaline solutions. In spite of the fact that silicon is one of the most studied elements due to its applicability in electronic devices, its electrochemistry in alkaline solutions at increased temperatures and at high potentials has been scarcely investigated. In the first part of the thesis monocrystalline (100) and (111) silicon samples were polarized in a strong alkaline solution at different temperatures and potentials in order to study anodic passivation mechanism. In the second part single- and multicrystalline Si-wafers were textured by utilizing electrochemical treatment in hot alkaline solutions. Anodic dissolution and passivation of Si (100) and Si (111) were studied by potentiodynamic and potentiostatic polarizations in 2 M KOH at temperatures ranging from 23 oC to 70 oC and at potentials from the open circuit potential (OCP) to 14. 5 V (with respect to Ag/AgCl reference electrode). Potentiostatic polarization experiments were performed on as-received (mechanically sawed or polished) and pre-etched (at OCP in the <b>alkaline</b> <b>test</b> solution) samples. The composition and thickness of the reaction products formed on the surfaces were analysed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The morphology of the surfaces was studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The oxide products formed during passivation was analyzed after polarization to the Flade potential at about 1 V. A thin (about 1 nm) homogeneous layer of Sioxyhydroxide (H 2 SiO 3) is formed at this potential. It is formed on both crystal orientations independent of temperature. The hydrated silica layer is gradually transformed into the stoichiometric oxide SiO 2 by polarizing Si (100) above the Flade potential at 23 oC or 30 oC. The phase change is indicated by an oxidation peak at around 4 V during potentiodynamic polarizations. Further, XPS analysis shows that both hydrated and dehydrated silica coexist at this potential. The oxide thickness formed during potentiodynamic polarization to 14. 5 V is 22 nm. Oxygen evolution is observed at about 4 V. At higher potentials the oxygen evolution is inhibited due to growth of thick oxide. The stoichiometric oxide SiO 2 forms and grows with increasing potential and exposure time on Si (111) at all temperatures irrespective of pre-etching. The thicknesses of the oxide are in the range 3 nm to 40 nm depending on the polarization method, potential and exposure time. The formation and growth of SiO 2 on Si (100) at 40 oC and higher temperatures depends on surface pre-etching. Polarization of pre-etched Si (100) at 40 oC and higher temperatures does not form SiO 2 on the surface. The compound present after polarization at all potentials was the thin, 1 nm thick hydrated silica layer. It was formed irrespectively of the polarization method or potential. Thus, pre-etching {{is an important}} parameter in the oxidation mechanism of Si (100). Oxide growth on non-pre-etched Si (100) at the high temperatures was similar to that of Si (111). However, pre-etching of Si (100) for more than 10 min at the high temperatures results in formation of pyramidal hillocks on the surface. During polarization at the high temperatures, the pyramidal hillocks are dissolved and the surface becomes flattened. Hydrated silica layer is the only detected oxidation product at all potentials. In the second part of the thesis a method is developed for electrochemical texturing of as-cut multicrystalline and single crystals, Si (111) and Si (100), in alkaline solutions. The wafers are potentiostatically polarized in 2 M KOH and 4 M KOH at temperatures in the range 30 oC to 70 oC. The applied potentials are varied from 20 V to 50 V (referred to Pt-counter electrode). Before the polarization, the samples are pre-etched in the test solution to remove the deformed zone on the as-cut surfaces. The morphology of the textured surfaces, the composition and thickness of the surface products and the light reflectivity are analyzed by utilizing SEM, XPS and Lambda UV/Vis/NIR spectrophotometer, respectively. Pre-etching of multicrystalline silicon (mc-Si) wafers results in anisotropic surface morphology with protrusions and valleys due to etching of different grains at different etch rates in alkaline solutions. During anodic polarization at potentials above 20 V and at temperatures at 40 oC and above, all the grains are uniformly textured. At 25 V and 30 V, micro-pits are formed on the protrusions. With increasing the potential to 40 V and 50 V, concave cavities are formed on the entire surface. Isotropic texturing is achieved. Isotropic texturing on mc-Si wafers is characterized by formation of the concave cavities of 1 to 10 μm. Inside the micropits and cavities, nano-pits are formed. Their lateral size is in the range 100 nm to 200 nm. At 50 V, the nano-pits are etched away and the cavities become shallower due to enhanced dissolution. The lowest average reflectivity, 17 %, is achieved on electrochemically textured surface after polarization at 40 V for 10 min in 4 M KOH at 50 oC, which is 50 % lower than the reflectivity on the pre-etched surface. A model for the isotropic texturing mechanism is proposed based on XPS analysis and electrochemical measurements. It is suggested that the formation of pits and concave cavities is due to local pH variations caused by oxygen evolution reaction, which control formation and dissolution of the surface oxide. Protons formed during oxygen evolution reduce the pH on the surface locally. Hereby, SiO 2 becomes stable and grows on the surface in the low pH area. For prolonged exposure the growth of the oxide passivates the surface and lowers the oxidation rate of Si and water. Due to high alkalinity of the electrolyte, oxide dissolves at weak points thus creating pits. Oxidation of silicon and oxygen evolution occurs at the oxide breakdown sites. Continuous formation and local dissolution of oxide causes the formation of micro-pitted surface. Formation of pits and concave cavities are not affected by changes in the electrolyte concentration and temperature. However, pre-etching is an important factor in obtaining the uniform textures on all the grains of the mc-Si wafers. This is due to the fact that pre-etching influences the formation of SiO 2 on (100) grains at high temperatures. Isotropic textures are not obtained on mc-Si wafers containing significant number of (100) grains when pre-etched for more than 10 min. On Si (111) wafer surfaces, pre-etching results in formation of steps and terraces. The terraces contain true (111) planes are stable and steps contain fast etching planes such as (100) and (110) are more reactive. During polarization, terrace planes are passivated by formation of a stable oxide, and pits are initiated at the step edges. With increasing potential, temperature and exposure time, pitting spreads over the terrace planes. The surface reflectance is decreased with increasing pit coverage. It is demonstrated that the electrochemical texturing method can effectively replace the present isotropic etching by acidic etchants. Both single crystal and multicrystalline materials have successfully been textured. PhD i materialteknologiPhD in Materials Science and Engineerin...|$|E

This method distinguishes socranskii from other species because its only positive <b>test</b> is the <b>alkaline</b> phosphatase <b>test,</b> while the other species are negative for this test.|$|R
40|$|A crucial, but {{limiting}} step in any MAS {{program is}} the reliable and efficient isolation of DNA. While there are numerous DNA extraction protocols and commercial DNA isolation kits available, their cost in barley breeding programs is not economically feasible. Breeders need high-through-put DNA isolation which can be performed on thousands of individuals. An <b>alkaline</b> method was <b>tested</b> for its suitability and {{it was found that}} the DNA samples are suitable for only PCR based procedures. Another limitation is that the extracted DNA needs to be processed immediately, and is not suitable for long-term storage...|$|R

Cells from four manufacturers were tested. The cells were subjected to simulated environmental and load conditions representative of those required for survival and operation. Battery cell characteristics that may contribute to ELT malfunctions and limitations were evaluated. Experimental results from the battery cell study are discussed, and an evaluation of ELT performance while operating under a representative worst-case environmental condition is presented...|$|R
40|$|Four {{management}} {{ideas that}} {{make it possible to}} grow soybeans on alkaline soils are covered here. Chlorosis (yellowing) in soybeans can be a problem wherever soybeans are grown on alkaline soils in Nebraska. Serious chlorosis is likely to occur when the pH of these alkaline soils is 7. 5 or higher. Soybean chlorosis problems occur in the Platte and Elkhorn River Valleys and, to a lesser extent, in the Republican and Loup River Valleys, and on high lime soils in central and western Nebraska. Not all high pH soils cause chlorosis of soybeans even though they are <b>alkaline.</b> Soil <b>tests</b> of the surface soil in chlorotic and non-chlorotic soybean areas of a field often are similar; however, the subsoils may be greatly different, particularly at the 16 - 24 inch depth. Subsoils in the chlorotic soybean area usually are poorly drained, are higher in pH, contain soluble salts and excess lime (carbonates), and may have a higher sodium saturation...|$|R
40|$|Background Recently, the {{clinical}} use of low power lasers has increased, {{and it is}} said that wound healing is accelerated by their irradiation. The aim of this study was evaluation of the effect of platelet-rich plasma on proliferation and differentiation of human dental pulp stem cells with or without Ga-Al-As laser. Methods: In this experimental study, human lower third molar dental pulp cells prepared from torabinejad research center located in isfahan. When cells reached to adequate extent, divided in 4 groups including PRP, PRP+Laser, Laser, and control for implementation of MTT <b>test</b> and <b>alkaline</b> phosphatase activity <b>test.</b> In Laser and PRP+Laser groups, each well irradiated 45 seconds for MTT test and 135 seconds for <b>alkaline</b> phosphatase activity <b>test.</b>   Results: Results demonstrated that PRP and PRP+Laser increased cell proliferation and viability up to 3 days but decreased cell proliferation and viability up to 5 days. Alkaline phosphatase activity was more in PRP+Laser, PRP and Laser, respectively, which all of them were less than control group. Alkaline phosphatase activity up-regulated in control group whereas in other groups down regulated.   Conclusion: Laser irradiation can induce cell proliferation and in this field better acted than PRP. However, for assessment of stimulatory effect of Laser and PRP more studies are warranted.   Keywords:Dental pulp stem cells, Ga-Al-As laser, Platelet-rich plasma...|$|R

40|$|A Fe-N-C non-noble metal (NNM) {{catalyst}} for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalyst was prepared via hard templating method using Fe(II) -phthalocyanine. Its electrochemical behavior towards the ORR was <b>tested</b> in <b>alkaline</b> conditions using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and rotating disk electrode (RDE) techniques. The kinetics of {{the reduction of}} the adsorbed oxygen, the selectivity, and the activity towards hydrogen peroxide reduction reaction (HPRR), were investigated. The ethanol tolerance and the stability in alkaline conditions were also assessed with the purpose to verify the good potentiality of this catalyst to be used in an alkaline direct ethanol fuel cell (DEFC). The results evidence that the ORR occurs mainly following the direct 4 e- reduction to OH-, and that the Fe-N-C catalysts is highly ethanol tolerant with a promising stability. The <b>alkaline</b> DEFC <b>tests,</b> performed after the optimization of the ionomer amount used for the preparation of the catalyst ink, show good results at low-intermediate currents, with a maximum power density of 62 mW cm- 2. The initial DEFC performance can be partially recovered after a purge-drying procedure...|$|R
