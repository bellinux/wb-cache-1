5|$|In March, Finance Minister Walter Harris, who was {{believed}} to be St. Laurent's heir apparent, introduced his budget. The budget anticipated a surplus of $258million, of which $100million was to be returned in the form of increased welfare payments, with an increase of $6 per month (to a total of $46) for old age pensioners—effective after the election. Harris indicated that no more could be returned for fear of increasing inflation. Diefenbaker attacked the budget, calling for higher old age pensions and welfare payments, more aid to the poorer provinces, and <b>aid</b> <b>to</b> <b>farmers.</b>|$|E

25|$|Zhu Yuanzhang, {{also called}} the Hongwu Emperor, was born of a peasant family and was {{sympathetic}} towards peasants. Zhu enacted a series of policies designed to favour agriculture {{at the expense of}} other industries. The state gave <b>aid</b> <b>to</b> <b>farmers,</b> providing land and agricultural equipment and revising the taxation system. The state also repaired many long-neglected canals and dikes that had aided agriculture. In addition, the Ming dynasty reinstated the examination system.|$|E

25|$|Next {{announced}} was Louisville Joint Stock Land Bank v. Radford. The 1934 Frazier-Lemke Farm Bankruptcy Act {{was designed}} <b>to</b> give <b>aid</b> <b>to</b> debt-ridden <b>farmers,</b> allowing them <b>to</b> reacquire farms {{they had lost}} from foreclosure, or to petition the Bankruptcy Court within their district to suspend foreclosure proceedings. The legislation's ultimate goal was <b>to</b> help those <b>farmers</b> scale down their mortgages.|$|R
25|$|Benson {{opposed the}} system of {{government}} price supports and <b>aid</b> <b>to</b> <b>farmers</b> which he was entrusted by Eisenhower to administer, arguing that it amounted to unacceptable socialism. Nonetheless, he served in his cabinet position for all eight years of Eisenhower's presidency. He {{was selected as the}} administrator-designate of the Emergency Food Agency, part of a secret group that became known as the Eisenhower Ten. The group was created by Eisenhower in 1958 to serve {{in the event of a}} national emergency.|$|E
500|$|In {{the wake}} of Cyclone Dina's devastation on January 23, then French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin ordered a relief team of 200 {{personnel}} to be dispatched to the island. He also expressed [...] "deep personal sympathy" [...] to the residents of Réunion. The following day, the Catholic Relief Services released immediate funds of €16,000 (US$14,000). An estimated 50,000 tonnes of debris was cleaned up across the island, the majority of {{which was in the}} Northwest Department, and cost waste management crews approximately €4.5 million (US$4 million) to process. Initially, the national disaster program was slow to react, with funding first being available on February 5. The first payments were made starting a month later. In the five months following the storm, the Government of France provided about €10.6 million (US$12 million) in <b>aid</b> <b>to</b> <b>farmers,</b> accounting for an overestimation of about 20 percent in needs. Based on meteorological statistics regarding wind speed and rainfall, Cyclone Dina was regarded as a 1-in-30 – 50 year event in Réunion.|$|E

30|$|For a long time, {{policy makers}} asked how the direct payments, and their related mechanisms, were {{to change in}} order to find a fair {{methodology}} for the <b>aid</b> distribution <b>to</b> <b>farmers</b> (Swinnen, 2009). Several estimates of the national ceiling <b>to</b> the Italian <b>farmers</b> have established a fairly clear picture regarding to potential problems, particularly related to the cultivation of durum wheat.|$|R
50|$|In Maguindanao, many {{rice and}} corn fields were {{destroyed}} by the drought brought by El Niño, and soon, the provincial government {{declared a state of}} calamity on the province. Earlier, North Cotabato declared a state of calamity, and the provincial government's <b>aid</b> <b>to</b> the <b>farmers</b> suffering from the drought caused a protest and a clash with police in Kidapawan.|$|R
50|$|Other {{policies}} of the Rajapaksa government include programs <b>to</b> <b>aid</b> <b>farmers</b> and agricultural production, such as the re-launch of the farmer’s pension scheme and subsidization of fertilizers.|$|R
2500|$|When Roosevelt {{began his}} {{run for a}} second term in May 1930, he reiterated his {{doctrine}} from the campaign two years before: [...] "that progressive government by its very terms, must be a living and growing thing, that the battle for it is never ending and that if we let up for one single moment or one single year, not merely do we stand still but we fall back in the march of civilization." [...] He ran on a platform that called for <b>aid</b> <b>to</b> <b>farmers,</b> full employment, unemployment insurance, and old-age pensions. His Republican opponent could not overcome the public's criticism of the Republican Party during the economic downturn, and Roosevelt was elected to a second term by a margin of 14%. With the Hoover administration resisting proposals to directly address the economic crisis, Governor Roosevelt proposed an economic relief package and the establishment of the Temporary Emergency Relief Administration to distribute those funds. Led first by Jesse I. Straus and then by Harry Hopkins, the agency assisted well over one third of New York's population between 1932 and 1938.|$|E

40|$|A new soybean {{variety that}} has “showed its heels” in {{yielding}} ability {{to every other}} bean with which it has been compared in Iowa for the last 5 years will be grown by a few Iowa farmers in 1944 {{and it should be}} in the hands of many who want to give it a try in 1945 and 1946.

50|$|The cost of {{agrarian reform}} was high. The {{government}} channeled {{large amounts of}} economic <b>aid</b> <b>to</b> organized <b>farmers.</b> Rural credit was greatly increased; farm machinery was made available; improved seeds and other inputs were supplied; and technical assistance was provided. Cooperative farm yields increased, but these higher yields were not impressive, considering the level of investment. Despite {{the high costs of}} the government programs, incomes of cooperative farmers remained low. After the mid-1970s, the government changed its policy toward cooperatives and stressed efficiency and productivity instead of equity.|$|R
50|$|Rice production, a key {{industry}} in Kedah and Perlis, was badly {{affected by the}} floods.

40|$|The Indian rural {{agriculture}} {{has been}} facing {{a lot of}} problems.

Therefore, we aim <b>to</b> provide the <b>farmers</b> with an interactive kiosk panel, using which they can get an easy and timely solution to their queries within 24 hours without being troubled to travel to distant places or make long-distance calls to gain information. Hence we focus towards development of software, which would provide immediate <b>aid</b> <b>to</b> the <b>farmers</b> in every possible manner.

5|$|The elderly Caxias, almost 72 and widowed since 1874, was in {{poor health}} and could serve {{only as a}} figurehead {{president}} of the government formed on 25 June 1875. Cotejipe was the de facto president. The Caxias-Cotejipe cabinet attempted to dissipate the discord created by the previous cabinet. Their measures included financial <b>aid</b> <b>to</b> coffee <b>farmers,</b> an amnesty for the convicted bishops, and, to please the pro-slavery Conservatives, the selection of new ministers and a call for elections. Caxias, who was a Freemason but also a staunch Catholic, threatened to resign if the Emperor did not grant the amnesty, which PedroII grudgingly issued in September 1875.|$|R
