5|$|A Bronze Age {{cemetery}} <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>remains</b> <b>of</b> an Iron Age settlement {{have been}} discovered in the village. Historians also believe Navenby was a significant staging point on the Roman Ermine Street, as the Romans are reported to have maintained a small base or garrison in the village. Navenby became a market town after receiving a charter from Edward the Confessor in the 11th century. The charter was later renewed by William Rufus, Edward III and Richard II. When the market fell into disuse in the early 19th century, Navenby returned to being a village.|$|E
5|$|Although its {{population}} had dropped below a thousand {{by the late}} 1920s, in 1927 the state replaced the stage road with what eventually became Highway 82. Unlike the stage road, it was closed during the winter months. While most of the old route {{was used for the}} new road, a portion of the original grade remains three miles below the pass on the east side. It includes the foundation of the gatekeeper's house <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>remains</b> <b>of</b> the gate.|$|E

5|$|At {{certain times}} in the {{geological}} past, corals were very abundant. Like modern corals, these ancestors built reefs, some of which ended as great structures in sedimentary rocks. Fossils of fellow reef-dwellers algae, sponges, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>remains</b> <b>of</b> many echinoids, brachiopods, bivalves, gastropods, and trilobites appear along with coral fossils. This makes some corals useful index fossils. Coral fossils are not restricted to reef remnants, and many solitary fossils may be found elsewhere, such as Cyclocyathus, which occurs in England's Gault clay formation.|$|E
5|$|Brancaster beach had a base {{including}} three pillboxes, Nissen huts and two gun emplacements, and another possible base, comprising about fifty different structures, {{was located in}} a salt marsh north-east of Burnham Overy Staithe. A wreck at {{the west end of}} Scolt Head Island was used as a bombing target, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>remains</b> <b>of</b> a Blenheim bomber were found at the north of the island in 2004.|$|E
5|$|During the Bronze Age fewer {{large stone}} {{structures}} were built although the great ceremonial circles continued in use as metalworking was slowly introduced to Britain from Europe over a lengthy period. There are relatively few Orcadian sites dating from this era {{although there is}} the impressive Plumcake Mound near the Ring of Brodgar and various islands sites such as Tofts Ness on Sanday <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>remains</b> <b>of</b> two houses on Holm of Faray.|$|E
5000|$|Jelšane is {{the site}} of six known mass graves or unmarked graves {{from the end of the}} Second World War. Most contain <b>the</b> <b>remains</b> <b>of</b> German {{soldiers}} from the 97th Corps that fell at the beginning of May 1945. The Cemetery Wall Mass Grave (Grobišče za pokopališkim zidom) is located next to the west side of <b>the</b> cemetery wall <b>and</b> contains <b>the</b> <b>remains</b> <b>of</b> an unknown number of soldiers.

5|$|In the High Middle Ages senior clergymen {{had their}} London palaces in the street. Place-names {{surviving}} with this connection are Peterborough Court and Salisbury Court after their respective Bishops' houses here; {{apart from the}} Knights Templars' establishment the Whitefriars monastery is recalled by Whitefriars Street <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>remains</b> <b>of</b> its undercroft have been preserved in a public display area. A Carmelite church was established on Fleet Street in 1253, but it was destroyed during the Reformation in 1545.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} that settlements have existed {{in the area around}} Rivington since the Bronze Age. Arrowheads, a flint knife, scrapers <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>remains</b> <b>of</b> cremations were excavated from a Bronze Age cairn at Noon Hill in 1958 and 1963–64. It {{is possible}} that the name Coblowe on the eastern bank of the Lower Rivington Reservoir derives from the Old English hlaw, a hill, which denoted an ancient barrow or burial place. Evidence for the existence of a settlement here in Anglo-Saxon times is found in the Rivington and Coblowe names.|$|E
5|$|Mining {{was carried}} out in Ruthwaite Cove, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>remains</b> <b>of</b> several levels and some shallow open {{workings}} are visible near Ruthwaite Lodge. These excavations were made in a search for lead-bearing galena, and are believed to have been worked in the 16th century. Further leases were taken out in 1784 and 1862; the last known operation was in 1880.|$|E
5000|$|Hlebce is {{the site}} of two known mass graves from the period {{immediately}} after the Second World War. Both are located near the freeway southeast of <b>the</b> settlement <b>and</b> contain <b>the</b> <b>remains</b> <b>of</b> Russian Liberation Army soldiers from the 29th Herzegovinian division that were murdered in mid-May 1945. The graves were excavated in late 2006 during freeway construction. The Lesce 1 Mass Grave (Grobišče Lesce 1) lies in an area covering 6 × 2.7 m <b>and</b> yielded <b>the</b> <b>remains</b> <b>of</b> at least 33 victims. The Lesce 2 Mass Grave (...) is located about 14 m from the first site. It lies in an area covering 2 × 1.5 m <b>and</b> yielded <b>the</b> <b>remains</b> <b>of</b> three victims.|$|R

5|$|Pennard Castle is {{a ruined}} castle, near the modern village of Pennard on the Gower Peninsula, in south Wales. The castle {{was built in}} the early 12th century as a timber ringwork {{following}} the Norman invasion of Wales. The walls were rebuilt in stone by the Braose family {{at the turn of the}} 13th and 14th centuries, including a stone gatehouse. Soon afterwards, however, encroaching sand dunes caused the site to be abandoned and it fell into ruin. Restoration work was carried out during the course of the 20th century <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>remains</b> <b>of</b> the castle are now protected under UK law as a Grade II* listed building.|$|E
5|$|Rick leads Evelyn and {{her party}} to the city, where the group {{encounters}} a band of American treasure hunters guided by Rick's cowardly colleague Beni Gabor. The expeditions are attacked by the Medjai, led by the warrior Ardeth Bay. Against Ardeth's advice to leave the city, the two expeditions continue to excavate. Evelyn searches for the famous Book of the Living, a book made of pure gold. Instead of finding the book, she, Rick, and Jonathan stumble upon the statue of Anubis <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>remains</b> <b>of</b> Imhotep buried underneath. The team of Americans, meanwhile, discover the black Book of the Dead, accompanied by canopic jars carrying Anck-su-Namun's preserved organs.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Wisconsin Heights {{had been}} {{a victory for the}} militia; no regular {{soldiers}} of the U.S. Army had been present. Atkinson and the regulars joined up with the volunteers several days after the battle. With a force of about 400 regulars and 900 militiamen, the Americans crossed the Wisconsin River on July 27 and resumed the pursuit of the British Band. The British Band was moving slow, encumbered with wounded warriors and people dying of starvation. The Americans followed the trail of dead bodies, cast off equipment, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>remains</b> <b>of</b> horses the hungry Natives had eaten.|$|E
5000|$|Jablanica is {{the site}} of three known mass graves or unmarked graves {{from the end of the}} Second World War. They all contain <b>the</b> <b>remains</b> <b>of</b> German {{soldiers}} from the 97th Corps that were killed at the beginning of May 1945. The Mountain Fields Mass Grave (Grobišče Njivce v gorah), also known as the Mountain Mass Grave (...) , lies in a meadow about 1.6 km northeast <b>of</b> Jablanica <b>and</b> contains <b>the</b> <b>remains</b> <b>of</b> 10 soldiers. <b>The</b> Solne Mass Grave (...) lies in a meadow about 150 m north of the chapel-shrine at Jablanica no. 13 <b>and</b> contains <b>the</b> <b>remains</b> <b>of</b> four soldiers. <b>The</b> Yard Grave (...) is located in a meadow near two spruce trees at the house at Jablanica no. 26 <b>and</b> contains <b>the</b> <b>remains</b> <b>of</b> one soldier.|$|R

5|$|The Blackdown Hills are crossed by {{a network}} of minor roads. There are several major roads {{including}} the A30, A303 and A35. The M5 motorway is at the northwestern boundary of the AONB. The Bristol to Exeter line <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>remains</b> <b>of</b> the Grand Western Canal run, quite close in places, {{to the west of}} the M5 motorway but do not pass through the Blackdown Hills. The West of England Main Line passes through the southern part of the hills between Axminster and Honiton, including a tunnel section east of Honiton.|$|E
5|$|The {{appearance}} {{and evolution of}} medieval warships {{is a matter of}} debate and conjecture: until recently, no remains of an oared warship from either ancient or early medieval times had been found, and information had to be gathered by analyzing literary evidence, crude artistic depictions <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>remains</b> <b>of</b> a few merchant vessels. Only in 2005–2006 did archaeological digs for the Marmaray project in the location of the Harbour of Theodosius (modern Yenikapi) uncover the remains of over 36 Byzantine ships from the 6th to 10th centuries, including four light galleys of the galea type.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} to the north-west of Exeter Hill, which formerly housed the water-powered bark mill, is now an antiques warehouse <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>remains</b> <b>of</b> the leat and tail race can still be seen.

5|$|The {{existing}} bedrock includes very ancient Archean gneiss, metamorphic beds {{interspersed with}} granite intrusions created during the Caledonian mountain building period (the Caledonian orogeny), commercially important coal, oil and iron bearing carboniferous deposits <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>remains</b> <b>of</b> substantial Paleogene volcanoes. During their formation, tectonic movements created climatic conditions ranging from polar to desert to tropical and a resultant diversity of fossil remains.|$|E
5|$|The foyer of {{the tower}} was {{originally}} planned to be an open-air forecourt between the building <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>remains</b> <b>of</b> the Palace Hotel, however extensive aeroelastic wind testing of the structure by the Institute of Environmental Sciences at Murdoch University forced this area to be covered with a glass canopy. Mocks of the curtain walls {{to be used in}} the tower were also tested to 1.5 times the proof load to ensure they could withstand cyclone-force weather and seismic shocks. The building is clad with green-tinted double-pane glass on windows, with the service core and structure of the building covered with aluminium sheeting skin coated with a light grey fluoropolymer paint.|$|E
5|$|The {{property}} {{contains the}} house and two outbuildings; the barn <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>remains</b> <b>of</b> an old windmill foundation. Constructed in 1861, the Glidden House adheres mostly to a French Colonial style of architecture. The raised basement and full-length porch {{are two of the}} architectural elements found on the Glidden House that are consistently found in French Colonial homes. The barn, a building of high historical significance, was not included as part of the National Register listing for the property until 2002, nearly 30 years after the original nomination was approved.|$|E
