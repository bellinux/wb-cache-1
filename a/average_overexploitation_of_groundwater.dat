25|$|Between 1985 and 2005 {{the level}} <b>of</b> <b>groundwater</b> in the Barada basin, on which Damascus sits, {{declined}} from 50 meters to 200 meters.

The main source of water for irrigation {{at the time were}} the various branches of the Barada River. Landlords ensured that irrigation canals were maintained, and surface water was distributed through an intricate system called whereby farmers took turns (Qirat) whose length varied depending on factors such as the size of their plots and distance from the canals. After a land reform in 1958 newly created cooperatives were unable to maintain the irrigation canals and to implement the distribution system. Furthermore, surface water was increasingly polluted. As a result, farmers drilled wells - usually without a permit - and thus began the <b>overexploitation</b> <b>of</b> <b>groundwater</b> that persists until today.|$|R
50|$|In {{contrary}} to a direct intervention approach, where either {{a government agency}} or a private actor (usually a non-profit organization) directly provides a defined target group with a specific service level, self-supply relies on establishing mechanisms to let people decide themselves on the level, the location and {{the timing of the}} service provided. This needs special attention to market development, to strengthening the capacities of the private sector (as a service provider) and government agencies (e.g., as quality monitoring agency). Thus, while not interacting directly with any households, self-supply does not imply that the poorest households and individuals are abandoned, but it optimizes the limited resources available at all levels. In cases where the government can not fulfil this role of a regulator and monitoring agencies, dynamic processes have led to <b>overexploitation</b> <b>of</b> <b>groundwater</b> resources (e.g., in the city of Lagos) and of increased public health problems due to the consumption <b>of</b> <b>groundwater</b> that is naturally contaminated with arsenic.|$|R

This resulted in <b>overexploitation</b> <b>of</b> <b>groundwater</b> resources due to excessive issuance of permits for deep wells and caused many Qanats to dry up. As such, the community distribution of water rights that has been provided and protected by Qanats over many centuries is now being replaced by demands, from individual farmers, for deep well permits. This has led to growing inefficiencies in irrigation water uses in a region affected by severe droughts and water scarcity.|$|R
50|$|Water {{management}} in Beijing, {{the capital of}} China, is characterized by intense water scarcity during the long dry season as well as heavy flooding during the brief wet season.

The difference is made up by the <b>overexploitation</b> <b>of</b> <b>groundwater.</b> Two thirds <b>of</b> the water supply comes from groundwater, one third from surface water. Average rainfall has substantially declined since the 1950s. Furthermore, one of the two main rivers supplying the city, the Yongding River, had to be abandoned as a source of drinking water because of pollution. Water savings in industry and agriculture have compensated for these losses and freed up water for residential uses.|$|R

Saline water intrusion in the coastal aquifers due to <b>overexploitation</b> <b>of</b> <b>groundwater</b> and other anthropogenic activities is a serious environmental issue nowadays. To protect the aquifers from quality degradation, geochemical assessment and monitoring is necessary. It is estimated that approximately one-third of the world’s population use groundwater for drinking purpose (Nickson et al. 2005). In India, more than 90  % of rural and nearly 30  % of urban population depends on groundwater for their drinking and domestic requirements (Jaiswal et al. 2003). According to Babiker et al. (2007), the chemistry <b>of</b> <b>groundwater</b> is not only related to the lithology of the area and the residence time the water is in contact with rock material, but also reflects inputs from the atmosphere, soil and weathering as well as pollutant sources such as saline intrusion, mining, and industrial and domestic wastes.

30|$|In this research, the Khanmirza {{agricultural}} plain in {{the southwest}} Iran has been selected as a study area due to its fragile physical conditions characterized by a traditional farming and the <b>overexploitation</b> <b>of</b> <b>groundwater.</b> Khanmirza agricultural plain is a typical area in the central mountain range of Zagros, Iran. It is also susceptible to land degradation and desertification due to the disregard of potential land sensitivity, the intensification of rural activities, and irrational development. Before the 1980 s, the central region of Khanmirza plain (low flat ground) was generally covered in rich meadow lands, and the groundwater level was approximately 1 meter near the surface (Zagarell 1982). Recently, most areas in this region have lost land quality due to the sharp depletion of the aquifer and extensive human activities (Taghipour Javi et al. 2014). Therefore, land sensitivity coupled with extreme land use and groundwater quantity negative change may turn into an irreversible process of environmental degradation.|$|R

30|$|Assessment <b>of</b> <b>groundwater</b> {{recharge}} {{is important}} in the management <b>of</b> <b>groundwater</b> resources (Hooji et al. 2011; Scanlon et al. 2006) because recharge is not a continuous process and is instead a sporadic event, observing and analysing it is extremely difficult. That has been a difficult challenge for hydrogeologists, made more difficult by the dual influence that human activities and climate change have had during the last three decades. Recent years have seen a growing trend in water consumption which corresponded to the continuous economic development (Dalin et al. 2017). <b>Overexploitation</b> <b>of</b> <b>groundwater</b> resources has led to water depletion, declining <b>of</b> <b>groundwater</b> levels, and deterioration of water quality (Custodio 2002; Blasch and Bryson 2007; Kumar 2007; Brunner et al. 2014; Unsal et al. 2014; Tamez-Meléndez et al. 2016). All those conditions are the threats to reliable water supplies and economic development. This is a serious situation, especially in semi-arid and arid areas because they often rely on groundwater as their main source for their irrigation, industrial, and domestic supply (Taylor et al. 2013). The role that it plays in the development of regional economy is so important that it becomes an indispensable source of water in those areas. Therefore, obtaining information about recharge mechanism is vital in being able to rationally use the groundwater resource.|$|R
40|$|Many {{regions of}} (semi) arid Mexico, {{such as the}} Valley of Toluca, face {{challenges}} due to rapid growth and the simultaneous <b>overexploitation</b> <b>of</b> <b>groundwater.</b> The water reform of the 1990 s introduced individual water rights concessions granted through the National Water Commission (Comisión Nacional del Agua, or CONAGUA). Since then, acquiring new water rights in officially 'water-scarce' aquifers is only possible through official rights transmissions from users ceding their rights. With the law prohibiting the sale of water rights, a profitable illegal market for these rights has emerged. The key actor in the water rights allocation network is the coyote, functioning as a broker between a) people wanting to cede water rights and those needing them, and b) the formal and informal spheres of water rights allocation. Actors benefitting from water rights trading include the coyote and his 'working brigades', water users selling surplus rights, and (senior and lower-level) staff in the water bureaucracy. The paper concludes that legally constructed water scarcity {{is key to the}} reproduction of illegal water rights trading. This has important implications regarding the current push for expanding regularisation <b>of</b> <b>groundwater</b> extraction in Mexico.

In particular, it identifies the subjective ways in which the assessment was interpreted and used by the state water resources agency to underpin water allocation decisions in accordance with its own interests, and the role that a desocialised assessment played in reproducing unequal patterns of resource use and configuring uneven waterscapes. Nevertheless, as Chile’s ‘neoliberal’ political-economic framework privileges the role of science and technocracy, producing other forms of environmental knowledge to complement environmental science is likely to be contentious. In conclusion, the paper considers the potential of mobilising the concept of the hydrosocial cycle to further critically engage with environmental science...|$|R
