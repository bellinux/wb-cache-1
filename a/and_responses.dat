Treatments for {{obsessive compulsive disorder}} typically consist of either exposure <b>and</b> <b>response</b> prevention or pharmacotherapy. particularly benzodiazepines. Combinations of {{these two types of}} treatment could lead to three possible outcomes. First, the combination of exposure <b>and</b> <b>response</b> prevention <b>and</b> benzodiazepines may show no better results than exposure <b>and</b> <b>response</b> prevention alone. Second, combination therapy may result in a better effect than exposure <b>and</b> <b>response</b> prevention alone [...] the drug will decrease anxiety during exposure without increasing the relapse rate after treatment.

40|$|Background: Despite {{significant}} resources {{allocated to}} disaster preparedness <b>and</b> <b>response</b> capabilities nationally, preparedness <b>and</b> <b>response</b> for vulnerable <b>and</b> special needs populations is still largely lacking. Public health agencies {{could not possibly}} meet the disaster preparedness <b>and</b> <b>response</b> needs of all vulnerable and special needs populations especially in inner cities where populations are often quite diverse. As a result, increased {{attention has been given}} to innovative and unique approaches to strengthen community-based organizations' (CBOs) capacities as partners in emergency preparedness, <b>response</b> <b>and</b> recovery. Just as preparedness <b>and</b> <b>response</b> strategies play key roles in agencies responding to public health emergencies and natural disasters, CBOs must have enough capacity for disaster preparedness <b>and</b> <b>response</b> that allows them to continue operations before, during and after crises and disasters. Capacity for disaster preparedness <b>and</b> <b>response</b> is rarely within the scope of most struggling nonprofit organizations; however, the relationships they have formed {{to meet the needs of}} their vulnerable clients may contribute to this capacity. Purpose: This study explored the relationship between the number and types of interorganizational relationships that CBOs use to serve clients, their disaster preparedness <b>and</b> <b>response</b> capacities. How these relationships may be leveraged is also explored as part of the strategy of enhancing the overall level of an organizations capacity for preparedness <b>and</b> <b>response.</b> Methods: Mixed methods were employed to investigate the potential number and type of interorganizational relationships, organizational capacities and communication mechanisms associated with and influencing the disaster preparedness <b>and</b> <b>response</b> capacities of CBOs serving the homeless. The percent potential leverage, an organization's potential for using interorganizational relationships for disaster preparedness <b>and</b> <b>response</b> related activities, is determined for each organization. Findings: Factors that contributed to disaster preparedness <b>and</b> <b>response</b> capacity for CBOs serving the homeless included: types of organizations CBOs had relationships with, leadership at the organization, evidence of a culture of preparedness, working with/support from external organizations, a tendency of continual improvement and proximity of collaborators and resources. A summary of survey results is provided. Conclusions: In the struggle to incorporate disaster preparedness <b>and</b> <b>response</b> activities into the organizational structure and functioning of CBOs serving vulnerable populations, CBOs may find it useful to look at their interorganizational relationships more closely to determine which ones may also be used for disaster preparedness <b>and</b> <b>response</b> activities. The results of this study offer opportunities for public health to build relationships with CBOs serving vulnerable populations before, during and after crises and likewise for CBOs to tap into many of the services provided by public health to build relationships that are more meaningful...|$|R

A series of written questions <b>and</b> <b>responses</b> between Republican members and Solis followed, during which she was more forthcoming. Republican Mike Enzi pressed her on whether her unpaid high-level positions at American Rights at Work constituted prohibited lobbying activity; Solis denied violation of rules of conduct and stated she had not helped lobbying. Solis did acknowledge that she had failed to report those positions on her annual House financial disclosure forms at the time, which a White House spokesperson argued was an unintentional oversight.

The condensed vibration equation is achieved by a simplified iterative scheme. By selecting the DOFs associated with the concerned element to be master DOFs, the response sensitivity is rapidly calculated from the derivatives of the master stiffness and mass matrices.
