5|$|Some sub-types of oil tankers {{have evolved}} to meet {{specific}} military and economic needs. These sub-types include naval replenishment ships, oil-bulk-ore combination carriers, floating storage and offloading units (FSOs) <b>and</b> <b>floating</b> production storage and offloading units (FPSOs).|$|E
5|$|After 1916, Roon was {{disarmed}} {{and used}} as a guard ship <b>and</b> <b>floating</b> barracks in Kiel {{until the end of}} the war. Design work commenced in 1916 to convert the ship into a seaplane carrier; work was planned to last from 1917 to 1918 during a period of 20 months. The ship was struck from the naval register on 25 November 1920 and scrapped the following year at Kiel-Nordmole.|$|E
5|$|From Han {{literary}} sources, it {{is known}} that wooden-trestle beam bridges, arch bridges, simple suspension bridges, <b>and</b> <b>floating</b> pontoon bridges existed in Han China. However, there are only two known references to arch bridges in Han literature, and only a single Han relief sculpture in Sichuan depicts an arch bridge.|$|E

They are used to calculate a number of object attributes, including link gap and object buffer, drift, <b>and</b> <b>float.</b> As objects <b>and</b> their relationships are added to or modified in the schedule, GPM continuously re-calculates and updates gap for all links <b>and</b> <b>float</b> for all dated objects. Link gaps are calculated from the dates of two related activities <b>and</b> <b>floats</b> are algorithmically calculated from gaps.|$|R

5|$|In 1904, E.V. Ramasamy went on {{a pilgrimage}} to Kasi to visit the revered Siva temple of Kashi Vishwanath. Though {{regarded}} as one of the holiest sites of Hinduism, he witnessed immoral activities such as begging, <b>and</b> <b>floating</b> dead bodies. His frustrations extended to functional Hinduism in general when he experienced what he called Brahmanic exploitation.|$|E
5|$|Substrates {{they are}} most {{commonly}} found on in their native habitats include beds <b>and</b> <b>floating</b> clumps of macroalgae like Sargassum muticum, Sargassum miyabei, Sargassum pallidum, Neorhodomela larix, Polysiphonia morrowii, Cystoseira crassipes, Laminaria japonica, Chondrusspp., and Desmarestia viridis; {{as well as in}} marine plants (like eelgrass of the genus Zostera), hydrozoans, and bryozoans.|$|E
5|$|Commercially viable natural {{deposits}} of graphite occur {{in many parts}} of the world, but the most important sources economically are in China, India, Brazil and North Korea. Graphite deposits are of metamorphic origin, found in association with quartz, mica and feldspars in schists, gneisses and metamorphosed sandstones and limestone as lenses or veins, sometimes of a metre or more in thickness. Deposits of graphite in Borrowdale, Cumberland, England were at first of sufficient size and purity that, until the 19th century, pencils were made simply by sawing blocks of natural graphite into strips before encasing the strips in wood. Today, smaller {{deposits of}} graphite are obtained by crushing the parent rock <b>and</b> <b>floating</b> the lighter graphite out on water.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{the strain}} on the oxygen supplies, the crew decides to abandon most of the {{equipment}} and to cut short the lunar stay. The repair work is completed slightly ahead of schedule, and the rocket cleared for lift-off. Halfway to Earth, Jorgen escapes his bonds thanks to the detectives' bungling and tries to kill Tintin and the others; Wolff seeks to prevent him, and in their struggle over a gun Jorgen is killed. When it is revealed that {{there will not be}} enough oxygen aboard for the crew to survive the journey, Wolff sacrifices himself by opening the airlock <b>and</b> <b>floating</b> out into space to his death. The crew fall unconscious but Tintin wakes long enough to set the rocket to auto-pilot and it arrives back in Syldavia safely.|$|E
5|$|Final reports {{indicate}} that the official death toll, according to the Louisiana Department of Health, was 1,464 people. The first deaths were reported shortly before midnight on August 28, 2005, as three nursing home patients died during an evacuation to Baton Rouge. On September 4, Mayor Nagin speculated that the death toll could rise as high as ten thousand after the clean-up was completed. Some survivors and evacuees reported seeing bodies lying in city streets <b>and</b> <b>floating</b> in still-flooded sections, especially in {{the east of the}} city. The advanced state of decomposition of many corpses, some of which were left in the water or sun for days before being collected, hindered efforts by coroners to identify many of the dead.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to Andrew Jackson's plea for volunteers {{to fight the}} British in the War of 1812, James and Rezin enlisted in the Louisiana militia in late 1814. The Bowie brothers arrived in New Orleans too late {{to participate in the}} fighting. After mustering out of the militia, Bowie settled in Rapides Parish, where he supported himself by sawing planks and lumber <b>and</b> <b>floating</b> them down the bayou for sale. In June 1819, he joined the Long Expedition, an effort to liberate Texas from Spanish rule. The group encountered little resistance and, after capturing Nacogdoches, declared Texas an independent republic. The extent of Bowie's participation is unclear, but he returned to Louisiana before the invasion was repelled by Spanish troops.|$|E

Scrapping took place in the same yard which was {{scrapping}} the Tuxedo Princess, a former ferry <b>and</b> <b>floating</b> nightclub that had been berthed underneath the Tyne Bridge. Following a decommissioning ceremony at Cardiff city hall, her bell was removed and is now mounted in the north aisle of St John's Parish Church in Cardiff. Calls were made for the conversion of the ship into a Cardiff tourist attraction by a Member of the National Assembly for Wales and former naval servicemen.|$|E
5|$|Production {{methods for}} the {{elements}} less frequently recognised as metalloids involve natural processing, electrolytic or chemical reduction, or irradiation. Carbon (as graphite) occurs naturally and is extracted by crushing the parent rock <b>and</b> <b>floating</b> the lighter graphite to the surface. Aluminium is extracted by dissolving its oxide Al2O3 in molten cryolite Na3AlF6 {{and then by}} high temperature electrolytic reduction. Selenium is produced by roasting the coinage metal selenides X2Se (X = Cu, Ag, Au) with soda ash to give the selenite: X2Se + O2 + Na2CO3 → Na2SeO3 + 2 X + CO2; the selenide is neutralized by sulfuric acid H2SO4 to give selenous acid H2SeO3; this is reduced by bubbling with SO2 to yield elemental selenium. Polonium and astatine are produced in minute quantities by irradiating bismuth.|$|E
5|$|Although Curtis was {{personally}} opposed to British possession of Gibraltar, he took command of a marine unit during the siege, {{and in the}} attack by Spanish gunboats <b>and</b> <b>floating</b> batteries in September 1782, Curtis took his men into the harbour in small boats to engage the enemy. During this operation, Curtis witnessed {{the destruction of the}} batteries by British fireships and was able to rescue hundreds of burnt and drowning Spanish sailors from the water. This rescue effort was carried out in close proximity to the enemy force and in constant danger from the detonation of burning Spanish ships, which showered his overcrowded boats with debris and caused several casualties amongst his crews. When Lord Howe relieved the siege, he brought the much-celebrated Curtis back to Britain, where he was knighted for his service and became a society figure, featuring in many newspaper prints. He came under attack however from Lieutenant Campbell, who published a pamphlet accusing him of indecision and a lack of nerve during his time in Brilliant.|$|E

5|$|The IUCN has {{assessed}} the sicklefin lemon shark globally as Vulnerable; it is harvested using anchored <b>and</b> <b>floating</b> gillnets, beach nets, and longlines. The meat is sold fresh or dried and salted for human consumption, the fins used for shark fin soup, and the liver oil is processed for vitamins. The sicklefin lemon shark is highly susceptible to local overfishing, {{due to its}} slow reproductive rate and limited movements. Off Southeast Asia, this shark has become scarce {{under the pressure of}} expanding, unmonitored, and unregulated fisheries, and has been assessed there as Endangered by the IUCN. Widespread habitat degradation, including pollution and blast fishing on coral reefs and deforestation in mangroves, poses an additional threat to the survival of this species in the region. Already, the sicklefin lemon shark has been extirpated in parts of India and Thailand, and has not been reported from Indonesian markets in recent years despite being historically abundant there. Off Australia, the sicklefin lemon shark is taken in only small numbers intentionally and as bycatch, and has been listed under Least Concern.|$|E
