They are not {{articulated}} relative {{to other parts of the}} locomotive and are driven via hydraulic transmission. The locomotive is powered by a four-stroke diesel engine.

5000|$|Limburgsche Tramweg Maatschappij (LTM) 53 was a {{locomotive}} built by Krupp, serial number 737, in 1924. [...] It entered service for Krupp factories in Essen in 1925. It {{was used as}} a plant switcher. The LTM purchased the locomotive in 1932, for coal service between Echt NS and Maasbracht Haven (harbour), which was operated by the LTM. This service terminated in 1936. Mining company Laura & Vereeninging (Eijgelshoven, The Netherlands) purchased the locomotive in 1937, and it entered service with the name Julia III at mine Julia. In 1962 the identifier was changed in LV 11.In 1944 it was temporarily rented out to the Staatsmijnen (SM), for a few months. The SM had rented <b>a</b> <b>C</b> <b>locomotive</b> to the NS workshops in Maastricht and used this locomotive as a replacement.|$|E

50|$|One of {{the more}} unusual {{appointments}} for <b>a</b> <b>C</b> class <b>locomotive</b> {{was the use of}} C 849 in 1963 as the oil-holding tank at Addington Workshops. The locomotive had been withdrawn but was instead converted to replace a modified UC tank wagon. Although only the tender was required for this conversion, the engine unit of C 849 remained attached until the boiler house was decommissioned and the locomotive was scrapped.|$|R
50|$|At the {{beginning}} of traffic, locomotives were distinguished by their names, and by 1865 also by their numbers. In 1887, the locomotives were given their original classification system. It {{was based on the}} wheel arrangement of the locomotives: each wheel arrangement was assigned a letter of the alphabet, which was followed by a serial number. The assignment of letters to different wheel arrangements was made when the first locomotive using it was brought into service; the letter A signified a 4-4-0 wheelbase in the Whyte notation, B signified <b>a</b> 0-4-2ST <b>locomotive,</b> <b>C</b> <b>a</b> 0-6-0 <b>locomotive,</b> and so on.|$|R
40|$|The C. elegans HIF- 1 proline hydroxylase EGL- 9 {{functions}} as an O[subscript 2] sensor in an evolutionarily conserved pathway for adaptation to hypoxia. H[subscript 2]S accumulates during hypoxia and promotes HIF- 1 activity, but how H[subscript 2]S signals are perceived and transmitted to modulate HIF- 1 and animal behavior is unknown. We {{report that the}} experience of hypoxia modifies <b>a</b> <b>C.</b> elegans <b>locomotive</b> behavioral response to O[subscript 2] through the EGL- 9 pathway. From genetic screens to identify novel regulators of EGL- 9 -mediated behavioral plasticity, we isolated mutations of the gene cysl- 1, which encodes <b>a</b> <b>C.</b> elegans homolog of sulfhydrylases/cysteine synthases. Hypoxia-dependent behavioral modulation and H[subscript 2]S-induced HIF- 1 activation require the direct physical interaction of CYSL- 1 with the EGL- 9 C terminus. Sequestration of EGL- 9 by CYSL- 1 and inhibition of EGL- 9 -mediated hydroxylation by hypoxia together promote neuronal HIF- 1 activation to modulate behavior. These findings demonstrate that CYSL- 1 acts to transduce signals from H[subscript 2]S to EGL- 9 to regulate O[subscript 2]-dependent behavioral plasticity in C. elegans.

As of 2011, two GE Dash 9-44CW locomotives remain on the UP with CNW logos and reporting marks, #8646 and #8701. Union Pacific has decided to leave these two locomotives in their current condition until either of them suffers a serious mechanical problem, in which they will be overhauled and repainted at Jenks Shop in North Little Rock, Arkansas or retired, depending on how bad the failure is. In addition to this, many former C units have received [...] "patches" [...] with a new road number and reporting mark to match their new owner's roster. Approximately 40 [...] "patched" [...] units remain on the Union Pacific and several others work under different owners. However, it is still possible to find untouched C units in service. For instance CNW 1518, CNW 411, CNW 414 (METX 308), CNW 4160, and CNW 6847 are preserved at the Illinois Railway Museum, CNW 4153 now works at a grain elevator in Fremont, Nebraska, and several other GP7s, GP9s, and <b>a</b> few other <b>C</b> <b>locomotives</b> are owned by various regionals, shortlines, or industries.|$|R
