5|$|Although congressional Republicans {{had opposed}} Clinton's Deficit Reduction Act of 1993, a key {{aspect of the}} 1994 Contract with America was {{the promise of a}} {{balanced}} federal budget. After the end of the government shutdown, Gingrich and other Republican leaders acknowledged that Congress {{would not be able to}} draft <b>a</b> <b>balanced</b> <b>budget</b> in 1996. Instead, they opted to approve some small reductions that were already approved by the White House and to wait until the next election season.|$|E
5|$|Following {{continued}} turmoil {{between the}} centre-right parties, {{there was even}} an independent petition in 1926 gaining some momentum that proposed for Nansen to head a centre-right national unity government on <b>a</b> <b>balanced</b> <b>budget</b> program, an idea he did not reject. He was the headline speaker at the single largest Fatherland League rally with 15,000 attendees in Tønsberg in 1928. In 1929 he went on his final tour for the League on the ship Stella Polaris, holding speeches from Bergen to Hammerfest.|$|E

5|$|By May 1997, Republican {{congressional leaders}} reached a {{compromise}} with Democrats and President Clinton {{on the federal}} budget. The agreement called for a federal spending plan designed to reduce the federal deficit and achieve <b>a</b> <b>balanced</b> <b>budget</b> by 2002. The plan included a total of $152billion in bipartisan tax cuts over five years. Other major parts of the spending plan called for $115billion to be saved through a restructuring of Medicare, $24billion set aside to extend health insurance to children of the working poor, tax credits for college tuition, and a $2billion welfare-to-work jobs initiative.|$|E
5|$|In the 1994 {{campaign}} season, in {{an effort}} to offer an alternative to Democratic policies and to unite distant wings of the Republican Party, Gingrich and several other Republicans came up with a Contract with America, which laid out ten policies that Republicans promised to bring to a vote on the House floor during the first hundred days of the new Congress, if they won the election. The contract was signed by Gingrich and other Republican candidates for the House of Representatives. The contract ranged from issues such as welfare reform, term limits, tougher crime laws, and <b>a</b> <b>balanced</b> <b>budget</b> law, to more specialized legislation such as restrictions on American military participation in United Nations missions.|$|E

5|$|Kemp was {{considered}} {{the star of the}} 1992 Republican National Convention. In 1992 and 1993, Kemp {{was considered}} the favorite or co-favorite for the 1996 Presidential nomination. At the time of the 1994 mid-term elections, Kemp was widely anticipated to announce his candidacy for 1996, and his supporters wanted a formal announcement {{by the end of the}} year. In January 1995, Kemp's stated reason for not entering the 1996 Republican Party presidential primaries was that his personal beliefs were out of balance with the contemporary Republican political landscape: Kemp opposed term limits, he always preferred tax cuts to anything resembling <b>a</b> <b>balanced</b> <b>budget</b> amendment and, unlike most Republicans, favored federal incentives to combat urban poverty. In 1995, Gloria Borger noted Kemp was not in step with the 1994 Contract with America. Kemp also noted a distaste for the vast fundraising necessary for a Presidential campaign. Gergen stated that by 1996 the selection process had become so expensive, mean and personally invasive that it discouraged several top Republicans from running. In 1995, while the world awaited the campaign decision announcement by Colin Powell, Kemp had positive thoughts on the prospect of such a campaign.|$|E
5|$|The bank bailouts and the {{economic}} downturn increased the country's deficit and debt levels {{and led to a}} substantial downgrading of its credit rating. To build up trust in the financial markets, the government began to introduce austerity measures and in 2011 it passed a law in congress to approve an amendment to the Spanish Constitution to require <b>a</b> <b>balanced</b> <b>budget</b> at both the national and regional level by 2020. The amendment states that public debt can not exceed 60% of GDP, though exceptions would be made in case of a natural catastrophe, economic recession or other emergencies. As one of the largest eurozone economies (larger than Greece, Portugal and Ireland combined) the condition of Spain's economy is of particular concern to international observers. Under pressure from the United States, the IMF, other European countries and the European Commission the Spanish governments eventually succeeded in trimming the deficit from 11.2% of GDP in 2009 to an 7.1% in 2013.|$|E

5|$|He {{was elected}} as chief {{executive}} officer of Dekalb County, Georgia in 2000, winning 64% of the vote, and was re-elected in 2004 with 54% of the vote. Jones is the first African American to serve as CEO of the county, and the youngest ever elected in the county. In April 2001, shortly after Jones became CEO, he voted, along with five other DeKalb County Commissioners, to offer life and health insurance benefits to the domestic partners of gay and unmarried County employees. DeKalb was the first county in Georgia to offer such benefits. During his administration, Dekalb County established the first local Homeland Security Office in 2001. Under Jones, DeKalb County approved creation of a new senior center, increased funding for roads, libraries, and park improvements while maintaining <b>a</b> <b>balanced</b> <b>budget,</b> and increasing the County's credit rating to AAA. As CEO, Jones promoted and achieved passage of a $125 million bond referendum that allowed for the acquisition of 2,735 acre expansion of the DeKalb County's green space, increasing the county's parks and green space by 70%. He requested and received Congressional designation of Arabia Mountain as a National Heritage Area. Jones was also primarily responsible for creation of Dekalb County’s first economic development department, which generated $4 billion in new investments.|$|E
5|$|In {{the turmoil}} of the Global Financial Crisis, the focus across all EU member states has been {{gradually}} to implement austerity measures, {{with the purpose of}} lowering the budget deficits to levels below 3% of GDP, so that the debt level would either stay below -or start decline towards- the 60% limit defined by the Stability and Growth Pact. To further restore the confidence in Europe, 23 out of 27 EU countries also agreed to adopt the Euro Plus Pact, consisting of political reforms to improve fiscal strength and competitiveness; 25 out of 27 EU countries also decided to implement the Fiscal Compact which include the commitment of each participating country to introduce <b>a</b> <b>balanced</b> <b>budget</b> amendment as part of their national law/constitution. The Fiscal Compact is a direct successor of the previous Stability and Growth Pact, but it is more strict, not only because criteria compliance will be secured through its integration into national law/constitution, but also because it starting from 2014 will require all ratifying countries not involved in ongoing bailout programmes, to comply with the new strict criteria of only having a structural deficit of either maximum 0.5% or 1% (depending on the debt level). Each of the eurozone countries being involved in a bailout programme (Greece, Portugal, and Ireland) was asked both to follow a programme with fiscal consolidation/austerity, and to restore competitiveness through implementation of structural reforms and internal devaluation, i.e. lowering their relative production costs. The measures implemented to restore competitiveness in the weakest countries are needed, not only to build the foundation for GDP growth, but also in order to decrease the current account imbalances among eurozone member states.|$|E
5|$|The group {{intentionally}} avoids {{any area}} where crime rates {{could result in}} frequent law enforcement interventions and commandos are instructed to be polite and are warned {{to stay away from}} illegal activities; association or deals with criminal organizations are prohibited. In keeping a discipline code, the organization also discourages the use of alcohol and prohibits the use of drugs. The EPB attempts to stay away from areas where other nationalist groups are based in order to avoid attention. There also settle away from military of police stations. Meetings are generally held in places with good reputation and in buildings that offer several access points, with heavy precautions being taken to reach their locations untailed. If different units are meeting, commandoes are instructed to place hoods or masks and use codenames in order to protect their identities, both to accomplish plausible denial and to root out any law enforcement plant. Information is segregated between groups and only shared in limited detail, when necessary. Incriminating or detailed documents or any other evidence is to be destroyed once the potential of a law enforcement intervention is apparent. While involved in a particular mission, the EPB commandoes regularly assume a faux name, but they usually use this to acquire legitimate documents and select a nondescript address in which to receive mail in a fashion that prevents surveillance, such a P.O. Box or an decoy address where mail is delivered to the community in general. Even ammunitions were given codes such as Manteca for firearms or Libretas for explosives to conceal their nature. Armories were specifically retrofitted to preserve the condition and to prepare new ammunition as needed. Funds are managed strictly and reports are constant in order to keep <b>a</b> <b>balanced</b> <b>budget.</b>|$|E
