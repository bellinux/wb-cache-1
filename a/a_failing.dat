5|$|Meanwhile, Ptolemy III of Egypt, who {{had been}} an ally of the Achaean League in their wars against Macedon, shifted his {{financial}} support to Sparta. Ptolemy made this decision after calculating that a resurgent Sparta {{would be a more}} valuable ally against Macedon than <b>a</b> <b>failing</b> Achaean League.|$|E
5|$|After the {{completion}} of the opera Britten went into the National Heart Hospital and was operated on in May 1973 to replace <b>a</b> <b>failing</b> heart valve. The replacement was successful, but he suffered a slight stroke, affecting his right hand. This brought his career as a performer to an end. While in hospital Britten became friendly with a senior nursing sister, Rita Thomson; she moved to Aldeburgh in 1974 and looked after him until his death.|$|E
5|$|Coexist {{features}} a minimalist musical style with spatial arrangements, loose song structure, little dynamism, and experimentation with tension. Its songs are characterised by sparse {{elements such as}} simple chord progression, keyboard ostinatos, and fading motifs, while Smith's production incorporates both programmed beats and live percussion instruments. Coexist touches on themes of heartbreak, loneliness, and intimacy. The lyrics, written by guitarist Romy Madley Croft and bassist Oliver Sim, address <b>a</b> <b>failing</b> relationship and changes in a romance with inner monologues and simple metaphors.|$|E

30|$|A search error {{occurs when}} the eyes fail to fixate a {{critical}} region of a visual scene, rendering a feature undetected; these have also been labeled as scanning errors because the critical feature {{was not in the}} scan path (Cain, Adamo, & Mitroff, 2013). For example, <b>a</b> radiologist <b>failing</b> to fixate <b>a</b> lung nodule (Manning, Ethell, Donovan, & Crawford, 2006), <b>a</b> pathologist <b>failing</b> to fixate large nucleoli in pleomorphic cells (Brunyé, Mercan, Weaver, & Elmore, 2017), or <b>a</b> neuro-radiologist <b>failing</b> to fixate <b>a</b> cerebral infarction (Matsumoto et al., 2011). Theoretically, if the diagnostician has not fixated a diagnostically relevant region of a medical image then successful search has not occurred, and without it, recognition and decision-making are not possible.|$|R
5|$|In {{the opening}} scene of the episode, Chris alerts his parents of <b>a</b> <b>failing</b> grade he {{received}} at school on a science test, causing his mother to suggest he receive help on his homework. Chris then asks his father, Peter, for help who ends up rejecting him, leading Chris to blame his bad grades on the Evil Monkey, and announces that he will prove the monkey is real. Peter then suggests that his son {{would have to do}} a better job than God when he created actresses Ellen Barkin and Kelly McGillis.|$|E

On June 13, 2014, KHAS-TV {{was shut down}} and its NBC programming {{was moved to the}} primary channel of KSNB-TV (channel 4). Gray had bought KSNB under <b>a</b> <b>failing</b> station waiver to form a duopoly with CBS station KOLN/KGIN, and operated the station as a MyNetworkTV/MeTV affiliate with local programming focused on central Nebraska; this existing programming was moved to KSNB-DT2 upon the transition. On August 27, 2014, the station was sold to Legacy Broadcasting.|$|E
5|$|Krabs' rival {{and former}} best friend Plankton {{operates}} the Chum Bucket, <b>a</b> <b>failing</b> restaurant {{across the street}} from the Krusty Krab. A major plot point throughout the series is Plankton's futile attempts to steal the Krabby Patty formula with the help of his computer sidekick Karen, under the assumption that they would be able to replicate the burgers and put the Krusty Krab out of business. To avoid this, Krabs goes to extreme lengths to prevent Plankton from obtaining the recipe; he even refuses to allow him to buy a Krabby Patty legitimately out of fear that Plankton might use Karen to reverse-engineer the formula. Krabs also makes it his duty to ensure that the Chum Bucket never has any business whatsoever.|$|E
25|$|The New Cannibalism is {{a phrase}} coined by {{anthropologist}} Nancy Scheper-Hughes in 1998 for an article written for The New Internationalist. Her argument {{was that the}} actual exploitation is <b>an</b> ethical <b>failing,</b> <b>a</b> human exploitation; a perception of the poor as organ sources which {{may be used to}} extend the lives of the wealthy.|$|R

5|$|Kriosian {{ambassador}} Briam (Tim O'Connor) {{comes on}} board the Enterprise with some cargo, ready for a peace ceremony with the Valtian. As the ship heads to the rendezvous, they save two Ferengi from <b>a</b> <b>failing</b> ship. Despite security being assigned, the Ferengi enter the cargo bay and deactivate the stasis field on Briam's cargo, revealing a young Kriosian woman named Kamala (Famke Janssen). With the Ferengi secured, it is revealed that she is an empathic metamorph who can sense what males around her desire and react appropriately. She was being brought as an arranged marriage to the Valtian representative. Kamala is generating pheromones that can affect males around her, which was why she was kept in stasis until the ceremony.|$|E
5|$|Players {{create a}} {{character}} {{from one of}} three character classes and explore the game's 84 locations, deciding whether to ally themselves {{with one of the}} four factions or remain neutral. The game's plot concerns an apprentice Shaper and an Agent (whose name is Shanti), both members of a secretive sect of wizards who can create life by using their own life energy. They are sent on a mission to investigate <b>a</b> <b>failing</b> Shaper colony called Drypeak. When they arrive not all is well, the player becomes drawn into a four-way war which has been hidden from the outside world.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{returning}} home, Edward {{becomes a}} travelling salesman and crosses paths with Winslow, unwittingly helping him rob <b>a</b> <b>failing</b> bank, inspiring the poet {{to work on}} Wall Street. In the present, Will investigates the truth behind his father’s tales and travels to Spectre. He meets an older Jenny, who explains that Edward rescued the town from bankruptcy and rebuilt it with help from his friends from Calloway Circus. Will suggests that Jenny {{had an affair with}} his father, but she reveals while she loved Edward, he remained loyal to Sandra. Will returns home but learns Edward has had a stroke and stays with him at the hospital.|$|E

5|$|Although {{dismissive of}} Young's work {{even before he}} had read it, Champollion {{obtained}} {{a copy of the}} Encyclopedia article. Even though he was suffering from <b>a</b> <b>failing</b> health, and the chicanery of the Ultras kept him struggling to maintain his job, it motivated him to return in earnest {{to the study of the}} hieroglyphs. When he was eventually removed from his professorship by the Royalist faction, he finally had the time to work on it exclusively. While he awaited trial for treason, he produced a short manuscript, De l'écriture hiératique des anciens Égyptiens, in which he argued that the hieratic script was simply a modified form of hieroglyphic writing. Young had already anonymously published an argument to the same effect several years earlier in an obscure journal, but Champollion, having been cut off from academia, had probably not read it. In addition Champollion made the fatal error of claiming that the hieratic script was entirely ideographic. Champollion himself was never proud of this work and reportedly actively tried to suppress it by buying the copies and destroying them.|$|E
5|$|Geneforge 2 is a {{role-playing}} {{game where}} the player's choice of answers during conversations with non-player characters affects how the player is regarded amongst the game's four factions. The player character is an apprentice Shaper, a feared and secretive group who can create life. Players create a character {{from one of}} three character classes and explore the area surrounding Drypeak, <b>a</b> <b>failing</b> Shaper colony, solving quests and gaining experience. Each of the three character classes has a particular playing style and can approach tasks in different ways. Guardians are fighters who excel in standard combat skills, especially hand-to-hand fighting. They are capable of shaping creations, but have little affinity for magic. Agents are the game's version of rogues, and excel in spell casting and are capable of hand-to-hand combat. The Shaper is a summoner, capable of creating living creatures by using their own life essence. Shapers rely on their creations for protection. Players can also convince certain non-player characters to join them.|$|E
5|$|Upon graduating, Harding had stints as {{a teacher}} and as an {{insurance}} man, and made a brief attempt at studying law. He then raised $300 in partnership with others to purchase <b>a</b> <b>failing</b> newspaper, The Marion Star, weakest of the growing city's three papers, and its only daily. The 18-year-old Harding used the railroad pass that came with the paper to attend the 1884 Republican National Convention, where he hobnobbed with better-known journalists and supported the presidential nominee, former Secretary of State James G. Blaine. Harding returned from Chicago to find that the paper had been reclaimed by the sheriff. During the election campaign, Harding worked for the Marion Democratic Mirror and was annoyed at having to praise the Democratic presidential nominee, New York Governor Grover Cleveland, who won the election. Afterward, with the financial aid of his father, the budding newspaperman redeemed the paper.|$|E

5000|$|Indeed, {{one might}} define the unary {{operator}} O {{in terms of}} the binary conditional one O(A/B) as , where [...] stands for an arbitrary tautology of the underlying logic (which, in the case of SDL, is classical). Similarly Alan R. Anderson (1959) shows how to define O {{in terms of the}} alethic operator [...] and a deontic constant (i.e. 0-ary modal operator) s standing for some sanction (i.e. bad thing, prohibition, etc.): [...] Intuitively, {{the right side of the}} biconditional says that <b>A's</b> <b>failing</b> to hold necessarily (or strictly) implies a sanction.|$|R

5|$|After Daniel parachutes from <b>a</b> <b>failing</b> {{helicopter}} {{onto the}} island, he uses Naomi's phone to contact George Minkowski (Fisher Stevens) {{on the ship}} that he came from. The next morning, on December 22, 2004, two of the flight 815 survivors – Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) and Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly) – help Daniel find his colleagues, as the rival group led by Locke attempts to do the same. Jack and Kate find Miles, who demands to see Naomi's body, and ascertains that Naomi was killed by Kate as Naomi said a code on the phone before dying. Kate confesses then that Naoimi was killed by John Locke. Locke's group finds Charlotte, takes her prisoner, and disposes of her tracking device. Daniel's third colleague, helicopter pilot Frank, fires a flare into the sky, leading Jack's group to him. Frank tells Jack's group that he managed to land the helicopter intact. After finding out that Juliet Burke (Elizabeth Mitchell) {{is one of the}} Others, Miles demands to know where Ben (Michael Emerson) is, as locating him is the freighter crew's primary objective. In Locke's group, several people become discontent with Locke's revelation that he is following the instructions of Walt Lloyd (Malcolm David Kelley), who had left the island a month earlier, and they also question why Ben is being kept alive. Locke holds him at gunpoint, and Ben starts to reveal information about the Kahana crew, specifically Charlotte's identity and that he has a spy aboard the ship.|$|E
5|$|The {{unlikely}} expedition team ends {{up on the}} Destiny, an Ancient starship located {{billions of}} light-years from Earth. The ship jumps to FTL shortly after the Stargate shuts down. Rush uses an Ancient communication device to contact Stargate command, taking control of Bill Lee (Bill Dow). When he returns, Rush claims that O'Neill put him {{in charge of the}} expedition, though the others are not quick to believe him. Meanwhile, the ship, having suffered millennia of wear and tear, has <b>a</b> <b>failing</b> life support system and an inadequately sealed hull breach in one of the shuttles, which can be sealed only from inside the shuttle. Senator Armstrong learns of this and, already badly injured, sacrifices his life to seal the shuttle off and buy the team time. However, the main life support is not so easily fixed. The CO2 scrubbers are decayed beyond repair, and within a day carbon dioxide poisoning will kill everyone. The Destiny, apparently aware of the problem, drops out of FTL and dials the Stargate to a desert planet with the necessary materials to repair the scrubbers. Four other locations are listed but locked out by the dialing computer. A 12-hour countdown begins, {{at the end of which}} the Destiny will continue on its journey automatically.|$|E
5|$|Valene's {{bitterness}} {{over her}} mother's indifference, {{and the subsequent}} loss of Lucy is not resolved until 1979 when she and Gary move to Knots Landing. Much of this early backstory is told through flashbacks in episodes of Knots Landing, and is only briefly referenced in Dallas. While working in a diner in 1978, Valene decided to wait for Lucy outside her school and they {{got to know each}} other. They stayed in contact with each other in secret for several months afterward. In the fall of 1978, Lucy arranges a reunion for her parents. Gary and Valene move back to Southfork for a short time, but their reunion is again undermined by J.R., who arranged for Gary to take charge of <b>a</b> <b>failing</b> company, hoping that the pressure would drive Gary away. Gary realized that he would fall off the wagon unless he left Southfork, so he departed. J.R. then turned on Valene, trying to bribe her, before ordering her to leave. In December 1979, Valene and Gary are reunited once more in Dallas, and get married for the second time. Gary's parents, Jock Ewing (Jim Davis) and Miss Ellie Ewing (Barbara Bel Geddes), as well as Gary's brother, Bobby (Patrick Duffy), and sister-in-law Pamela Barnes Ewing (Victoria Principal), attend the wedding. Shortly afterward, they move to California to live in a home that Miss Ellie had bought for them as a wedding gift. Valene also appears in the final episode of Dallas during J.R.'s dream, which showed how things would have turned out had J.R. never existed. In this dream, Val meets Gary for the first time when they are both middle aged and they take a liking to each other, highlighting the idea that Gary and Val were always destined to end up together one way or another.|$|E
