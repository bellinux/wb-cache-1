40|$|Of 8 {{insecticides}} tested (DDT, endosulfan, dimethoate, <b>azinphos‐ethyl,</b> metamidophos, deltamethrin, fenvalerate, permethrin) the pyrethroids fenvalerate and permethrin {{were the}} least selectively toxic to 2 parasites, O. lepidus and C. desantisi, of P. operculella. All the insecticides were more toxic to the parasites than to their host. The results indicate that P. operculella is again susceptible to DDT. Copyrigh...|$|E
40|$|Several {{triazine}} pesticides, such as atrazine, {{are much}} more soluble in several organic solvents, such as chloroform, than in water. Our recent research was aimed at analyzing this class of pesticides using tyrosinase OPEE (organic phase enzyme electrodes), exploiting their inhibiting action on the tyrosinase enzyme when operating in water-saturated chloroform medium. In this work we studied the response of a tyrosinase inhibition enzyme sensor to several triazinic (simazine, propazine, terbuthylazine) and benzotriazinic (<b>azinphos-ethyl</b> and azinphos-methyl) pesticides (LOD= 0. 5 x 10 (- 9) mol l(- 1)). Recovery trials were also performed in vegetal matrixes (corn, barley, lentils). Lastly, {{the effect of the}} solvent (chloroform or water) on the inhibition process was investigated via Hill's equation and the diffusion of analyte from the solvent to the enzyme membrane...|$|E
40|$|The global shrimp farming {{industry}} had a {{rapid growth in}} the 1980 s due to the high demand for shrimp. Apart from the destruction of mangroves and wetlands, the intensive operation of shrimp aquaculture deteriorated the water quality in the region. Variety of chemicals and biological products were used to prevent the outbreaks of diseases in the intensively managed shrimp ponds. Pesticides were used as disinfectands to kill unwanted organisms in the pond. SPME-GC-ECD method was developed for the determination of <b>azinphos-ethyl,</b> chlorphyrifos-methyl, diazinon, dichlorvos, endosulfan-I, endosulfan-II, endosulfan sulfate and malathion from water samples of shrimp aquaculture area in Manjung district, Perak. The optimum SPME method developed for GC-ECD analysis of selected analytes {{was found to be}} 30 min of extraction at 40 °C under continuous stirring condition; 12 min of desorption at 270 °C. No matrix modifications were applied in this study. Recoveries obtained ranged between 90. 64...|$|E
40|$|International audienceA flow {{injection}} system, incorporating an acetylcholinesterase (AChE) {{single bead}} string reactor (SBSR), for {{the determination of}} some organophosphorous (<b>azinphos-ethyl,</b> azinphos-methyl, bromophos-methyl, dichlorovos, fenitrothion, malathion, paraoxon, parathion-ethyl and parathion-methyl) and carbamate insecticides (carbofuran and carbaryl) is presented. The detector is a simple pH electrode with a wall-jet entry. Variations in enzyme activity due to inhibition are measured from pH changes when the substrate (acetylcholine) is injected {{before and after the}} passage of the solution containing the insecticide. The percentage inhibition of enzyme activity is correlated to the insecticide concentration. Several parameters influencing the performance of the system are studied and discussed. The detection limits of the insecticides ranged from 0. 5 to 275 ppb. The determination of these compounds was conducted in Hepes buffer and a synthetic sea water preparation. The enzyme reactor can be regenerated after inhibition with a dilute solution of 2 -PAM and be reused for analysis. The immobilized enzyme did not lose any activity up to 12 weeks when stored at 4 °C...|$|E
40|$|Pesticides in &# 8220;PERA&# 8221; orange samples (N = 57) from São Paulo City, Brazil were {{assessed}} and the pesticide intake contribution was estimated for chronic risk assessment. Seventy-six pesticides {{were evaluated by}} the gas chromatography multi-residue method, including isomers and metabolites (4. 332 determinations). The mean recoveries at the limit of quantification level were {{in the range of}} 72 - 115 % and the relative standard deviation for five replicate samples was 1 - 11 %. The limits of detection and quantification ranged from 0. 005 to 0. 4 mg. kg&# 8722; 1 and from 0. 01 to 0. 8 mg. kg&# 8722; 1, respectively. Pesticides were found in 42. 1 % of the samples at levels ranging from 0. 06 to 2. 9 mg. kg&# 8722; 1. Of the contaminated samples, 3. 5 % contained residues (bifenthrin and clofentezine) above the maximum residue level and 12. 3 % contained unauthorized pesticides (<b>azinphos-ethyl,</b> parathion, myclobutanil, profenofos, and fenitrothion). The estimated risk characterization for orange intake by adults and children, respectively, ranged from 0. 04 to 6. 6 % and from 0. 1 to 26. 5 % of the acceptable daily intake. The detection of irregular residues emphasizes the need for better implementation of Good Agriculture Practices and greater control of formulated products. Other pesticides surveyed did not pose a health risk due to consumption...|$|E
40|$|A {{bioassay}} {{technique was}} developed to test the efficacy of insecticides against potato moth (Phthorimaea operculella (Zeller)) on tomatoes. The technique tested efficacy against both larvae in mines and neonate larvae {{that had not yet}} penetrated the leaf, and explained the failure of some insecticides to control P. operculella infestations in commercial tomato crops. Neonate larvae placed on leaves of potted plants several days before treatment provided larvae for testing of insecticides against larvae in mines; other neonates were placed on leaves after treatment to test efficacy against larvae yet to penetrate the leaf. The plants were sprayed with the candidate insecticides, held for 5 - 7 days, and larval mortality assessed. Chlorfenapyr (100, 200 g a. i. ha- 1) and abamectin (8. 1 g a. i. ha- 1) were effective against neonate larvae and larvae in mines. Sulprofos (720 g a. i. ha - 1), methomyl (450 g a. i. ha- 1) and spinosad (96 g a. i. ha- 1) were effective against neonate larvae but not against larvae in mines. Methamidophos (1102 g a. i. ha- 1), endosulfan (700 g a. i. ha- 1) and Bacillus thuringiensis kurstaki (1000 g ha- 1) had some effect against exposed larvae but little against larvae in mines. Thiodicarb (525 g a. i. ha- 1), <b>azinphos-ethyl</b> (440 g a. i. ha - 1), imidacloprid (59. 5 g a. i. ha- 1), hexaflumuron (50 g a. i. ha- 1), methoxyfenozide (300 g a. i. ha- 1) and tebufenozide (200 g a. i. ha- 1) were ineffective. A field trial using chlorfenapyr (25, 50, 100, 150 and 200 g a. i. ha- 1) and methamidophos (1102 g a. i. ha- 1) validated the bioassay technique, with chlorfenapyr effective in reducing the numbers of larvae in mines in leaves...|$|E
