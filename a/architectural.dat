5|$|<b>Architectural</b> {{management}} can {{be defined}} as an ordered way of thinking which helps to realise a quality building for an acceptable cost or as a process function with the aim of delivering greater <b>architectural</b> value to the client and society. Research by Kiran Gandhi describes <b>architectural</b> management as a set of practical techniques for an architect to successfully operate his practice. The term <b>architectural</b> management has been in use since the 1960s. The evolution of the field of <b>architectural</b> management has not been a smooth affair. <b>Architectural</b> practice was merely considered a business until after the Second World War, and even then practitioners appeared {{to be concerned about the}} conflict between art and commerce, demonstrating indifference to management. There was apparent conflict between the image of an architect and the need for professional management of the <b>architectural</b> business. Reluctance to embrace management and business as an inherent part of <b>architectural</b> practice could also be seen in <b>architectural</b> education programmes and publications. It appears that the management of <b>architectural</b> design, as well as <b>architectural</b> management in general, is still not being given enough importance. <b>Architectural</b> management falls into two distinct parts: office or practice management and project management. Office management provides an overall framework within which many individual projects are commenced, managed, and completed. <b>Architectural</b> management extends between the management of the design process, construction, and project management, through to facilities management of buildings in use. It is a powerful tool that can be applied to the benefit of professional service firms and the total building processes, yet it continues to receive too little attention both in theory and in practice.|$|E
5|$|Although Maya cities shared many common features, {{there was}} {{considerable}} variation in <b>architectural</b> style. Such styles were influenced by locally available construction materials, climate, topography, and local preferences. In the Late Classic, these local differences developed into distinctive regional <b>architectural</b> styles.|$|E
5|$|Bristol, {{the largest}} city in South West England, has an eclectic {{combination}} of <b>architectural</b> styles, ranging from the medieval to 20th century brutalism and beyond. During the mid-19th century, Bristol Byzantine, an <b>architectural</b> style unique to the city, was developed, and several examples have survived.|$|E

5|$|Copper {{has been}} used since ancient times as a durable, {{corrosion}} resistant, and weatherproof <b>architectural</b> material. Roofs, flashings, rain gutters, downspouts, domes, spires, vaults, and doors have been made from copper for {{hundreds or thousands of}} years. Copper's <b>architectural</b> use has been expanded in modern times to include interior and exterior wall cladding, building expansion joints, radio frequency shielding, and antimicrobial and decorative indoor products such as attractive handrails, bathroom fixtures, and counter tops. Some of copper's other important benefits as an <b>architectural</b> material include low thermal movement, light weight, lightning protection, and recyclability.|$|E
5|$|Designed by the <b>architectural</b> firm of Deeter & Ritchey, {{the complex}} was {{completed}} in 1963 and was named for former chancellor Edward Litchfield following his death in an airplane crash in 1968. The complex consists of three towers, which during construction were designated A, B, and C in the <b>architectural</b> plans. The names stuck after the towers were completed, and the towers are still so named today.|$|E
5|$|Designed in {{accordance}} with the standards of Maharishi Vastu Architecture, it features a blend of <b>architectural</b> styles across India. It is entirely constructed from Rajasthani pink sandstone and Italian Carrara marble. Based on traditional Hindu <b>architectural</b> guidelines (Shilpa shastras) on maximum temple life span, it makes no use of ferrous metal. Thus, it has no support from steel or concrete.|$|E
5|$|Due to this blow to his reputation, {{he began}} running a {{stationery}} shop, {{working as a}} newspaper agent, and giving drawing lessons until 1857 to supplement his <b>architectural</b> work. It was during this period in the <b>architectural</b> wilderness that he developed a lifelong interest in photography and supplemented his meagre income by taking photographic portraits of his neighbours.|$|E

5|$|Its {{location}} on a strategic transport crossroad in Podolia made the castle a prime target for foreign invaders, who rebuilt the castle {{to suit their}} own needs, adding to its multicultural <b>architectural</b> diversity. Specifically, the complex consists of the Old Town fortified by King Casimir IV, the Old Castle rebuilt by Kings Sigismund I and Stephen Báthory, and the New Castle founded by Kings Sigismund III and Władysław IV. However, {{in spite of the}} many <b>architectural</b> and engineering changes to the original structure, the castle still forms a coherent <b>architectural</b> design, being one of the few medieval constructions in Ukraine that is relatively well preserved.|$|E
5|$|Mobile has antebellum <b>architectural</b> {{examples}} of Greek Revival, Gothic Revival, Italianate, and Creole cottage. Later <b>architectural</b> styles {{found in the}} city include the various Victorian types, shotgun types, Colonial Revival, Tudor Revival, Spanish Colonial Revival, Beaux-Arts and many others. The city currently has nine major historic districts: Old Dauphin Way, Oakleigh Garden, Lower Dauphin Street, Leinkauf, De Tonti Square, Church Street East, Ashland Place, Campground, and Midtown.|$|E
5|$|No <b>architectural</b> {{drawings}} {{survive for}} any English cathedral earlier than 1525 (although an engineer's {{design for a}} proposed new water supply at Canterbury cathedral priory exists in a 12th-century plan). <b>Architectural</b> details, such as window tracery designs, were not executed as scale drawings, but were incised full-size onto a large flat gypsum tracing-floor, examples of which survive at York and Wells.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{recognizable}} characteristic of Noh stage is its independent roof that hangs over the stage even in indoor theatres. Supported by four columns, the roof symbolizes {{the sanctity of the}} stage, with its <b>architectural</b> design derived from the worship pavilion (haiden) or sacred dance pavilion (kagura-den) of Shinto shrines. The roof also unifies the theatre space and defines the stage as an <b>architectural</b> entity.|$|E

5|$|Structure 5C-49 {{possesses}} a clear Teotihuacan-linked <b>architectural</b> style; it has balustrades, an <b>architectural</b> feature {{that is very}} rare in the Maya region, and a talud-tablero façade; it dates to the 4th century AD. It is located near to the Lost World pyramid.|$|E
5|$|The Corinthian {{order of}} <b>architectural</b> style {{originating}} from ancient Greece was the dominant <b>architectural</b> {{style in the}} age of Augustus and the imperial phase of Rome. Suetonius once commented that Rome was unworthy of its status as an imperial capital, yet Augustus and Agrippa set out to dismantle this sentiment by transforming the appearance of Rome upon the classical Greek model.|$|E

5|$|The {{building}} is of <b>architectural</b> interest because it still retains <b>architectural</b> elements from many previous centuries, including a 14th-century sacristy wall and 16th-century tower {{connected with the}} King's Council of the North. It {{is also one of}} only two intact 17th-century brick buildings that survive in the city, the other being Alderman Fenwick's House.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} {{was the result}} of an <b>architectural</b> design competition. In July 1971, a contest to design PUB's corporate headquarters was launched. Of 23 submissions, four were picked by a jury headed by then PUB chairman Lim Kim San. The proposal by the now-defunct Singapore <b>architectural</b> firm Group 2 Architects (1970–1978), formed by Ong Chin Bee and Tan Puay Huat, won.|$|E

5|$|The six storied Baden-Powell House is {{designed}} in the modern <b>architectural</b> style, as pioneered by the Swiss architect Le Corbusier from the late 1920s onwards, and predominating in the 1950s. At Baden-Powell House, Tubbs made the first floor overhang the ground floor, a LeCorbusier <b>architectural</b> design choice to free the building from the ground, such as seen in his Pavillon Suisse at the Cité Internationale Universitaire in Paris. Additionally, LeCorbusier's Sainte Marie de La Tourette priory in Lyon shows two floors of monk's cells with small windows, cantilevered over the more open floors below, another design choice used by Tubbs in the facade of Baden-Powell House. While Tubbs created Baden-Powell House in the modern <b>architectural</b> style of LeCorbusier, he used more <b>architectural</b> restraint in his own design choices. For example, he made the main visible building component brick rather than concrete. This heavier evolution of LeCorbusier's style was popular in England throughout the post-war years until replaced by the Brutalist style in the later 1960s.|$|E
5|$|There {{are certain}} <b>architectural</b> styles {{present in the}} game; <b>architectural</b> styles {{determine}} the appearance of in-game buildings. Each civilization is automatically assigned its <b>architectural</b> style. These three <b>architectural</b> styles are the Western European, which consists of classical styled wooden buildings and is shared by the British, French and Dutch; the Eastern European, which consists of wooden and straw structures and is shared by the Germans and Russians, and the Mediterranean, which consists of buildings made of stucco cement and dry brick, which is shared by the Spanish, Portuguese and Ottomans.|$|E

5|$|Coffin {{took the}} full range of <b>architectural</b> courses {{including}} studying engineering, physics, maths, mechanical drafting and freehand drawing in addition to <b>architectural</b> and landscape design. She also studied botany and horticulture under Charles Sprague Sargent at the Arnold Arboretum. One of her formative influences at MIT was Guy Lowell, the director of the landscape design program there, who was an advocate of the classical values of balance, order, proportion and harmony taught by the French Ecole des Beaux-Arts. Lowell was best known for his book American Gardens, published in 1902, which influenced many landscape architects to adopt his principles to design symmetrical, axial gardens that combined <b>architectural</b> features with classical garden ornaments with vegetation, following the tradition of Italian villas.|$|E

5|$|The BOK Tower, built {{during this}} period, is the 2nd tallest {{building}} in Oklahoma {{and the surrounding}} states of Missouri, New Mexico, Arkansas, and Kansas. Tulsa also has the third-, and fourth-tallest buildings in the state, including the Cityplex Tower, which is located in South Tulsa across from Oral Roberts University, far from downtown. One of the area's unique <b>architectural</b> complexes, Oral Roberts University, is built in a Post-Modern Futuristic style, incorporating bright gold structures with sharp, jetting edges and clear geometric shapes. The BOK Center, Tulsa's new arena, incorporates many of the city's most prominent themes, including Native American, art deco, and contemporary <b>architectural</b> styles. Intended to be an <b>architectural</b> icon, the building was designed by César Pelli, {{the architect of the}} Petronas Towers in Malaysia.|$|E
5|$|The North Acropolis of {{the ancient}} Maya city of Tikal in Guatemala is an <b>architectural</b> complex {{that served as a}} royal {{necropolis}} and was a centre for funerary activity for over 1300 years. The acropolis is located near the centre of the city {{and is one of the}} most studied of Maya <b>architectural</b> complexes. Excavations were carried out from 1957 to 1969 by the University of Pennsylvania, directed by Edwin M. Shook and William Coe.|$|E
5|$|The <b>architectural</b> {{designs of}} these {{projects}} have reflected not only the style currents of their time, but the societal debate over the purpose they were intended to serve. Nationalistic ambitions early on gave way to austere designs based on functionalism, and then to designs that emphasized human and ecological needs. To a great extent, Norwegian architects have found {{the opportunity to develop}} their signature styles through these projects, and thereby also a Norwegian <b>architectural</b> dialect.|$|E
