40|$|We {{previously}} reported that A/WySnJ mice vaccinated via a tail scratch with a recombinant raccoon poxvirus (RCN) expressing the rabies virus internal structural nucleoprotein (N) (RCN-N) were protected against a street rabies virus (D. L. Lodmell, J. W. Sumner, J. J. Esposito, W. J. Bellini, and L. C. Ewalt, J. Virol. 65 : 3400 - 3405, 1991). To improve {{our understanding of}} the mechanism(s) of this protection, we investigated whether sera of A/WySnJ mice that had been vaccinated with RCN-N but not challenged with street rabies virus had anti-rabies virus activity. In vivo studies illustrated that mice inoculated in the footpad with preincubated mixtures of anti-N sera and virus were protected. In addition, anti-N sera inoculated into the site of virus challenge protected mice. The antiviral activity of anti-N sera was also demonstrated in vitro. Infectious virus was not detected in cultures 24 h following infection with virus that had been preincubated with anti-N sera. At later time points, infectious virus was detected, but inhibition of viral production was consistently > or = 99 % compared with control cultures. The protective and antiviral inhibitory activity of the anti-N sera was identified as <b>anti-N</b> <b>antibody</b> by several methods. First, absorption of anti-N sera with goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin serum, but not normal goat serum, removed the activity. Second, radioimmuno-precipitation and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of sucrose density gradient-fractionated anti-N sera showed that antiviral activity was present only in the fraction containing <b>anti-N</b> <b>antibody.</b> Finally, absorption of anti-N sera with insect cells infected with a baculovirus expressing the N protein removed the protective activity. These data indicate that <b>anti-N</b> <b>antibody</b> is a component of the resistance to rabies virus infections...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Outbreaks of Hendra (HeV) and Nipah (NiV) viruses {{have been}} {{reported}} starting in 1994 and 1998, respectively. Both viruses are capable of causing fatal disease in humans and effecting great economical loss in the livestock industry. Results Through screening of hybridomas derived from mice immunized with γ-irradiated Nipah virus, we identified two secreted antibodies; one reactive with the nucleocapsid (N) protein and the other, the phosphoprotein (P) of henipaviruses. Epitope mapping and protein sequence alignments between NiV and HeV suggest the last 14 amino acids of the carboxyl terminus of the N protein is {{the target of the}} <b>anti-N</b> <b>antibody.</b> The anti-P antibody recognizes an epitope in the amino-terminal half of P protein. These monoclonal antibodies were used to develop two antigen capture ELISAs, one for virus detection and the other for differentiation between NiV and HeV. The lower limit of detection of the capture assay with both monoclonal antibodies was 400 pfu. The <b>anti-N</b> <b>antibody</b> was used to successfully detect NiV in a lung tissue suspension from an infected pig. Conclusion The antigen capture ELISA developed is potentially affordable tool to provide rapid detection and differentiation between the henipaviruses. </p...|$|E

After humoral and cellular immune response detection, different levels of SARS-CoV N protein specific antibodies and interferon-γ (IFN-γ) secretion are shown compared to controls. The humoral immune response was induced more effectively by the DNA priming and recombinant adenovirus boosting regimen. There is a significant difference between heterogeneous and homologous vaccinations. The heterogeneous combinations were all higher than those of the homologous combinations in the induction of <b>anti-N</b> <b>antibody</b> response. Among the three heterogeneous combinations, pcDNA 3. 1 -N/pcDNA 3. 1 -N/pcDNA 3. 1 -N/rAd-N induced the strongest antibody response. In the induction of IFN-γ production, the homologous combination of rAd-N/rAd-N/rAd-N/rAd-N was significantly stronger than that of pcDNA 3. 1 -N/pcDNA 3. 1 -N/pcDNA 3. 1 -N/pcDNA 3. 1 -N, but was relatively weaker than the heterogeneous combination of pcDAN 3. 1 -N/pcDAN 3. 1 -N/pcDAN 3. 1 -N/rAd-N.

Different levels of <b>anti-N,</b> dubius <b>antibodies</b> were detected in sera from these mouse strains; there was no correlation between antibody titre and numbers of worms recovered. Serum from donor wild and six laboratory strains of mice protected female Quackenbush (Q) recipients against N. dubius infections; donor mouse strain influenced the degree of protection conferred and donor serum antibody titre related {{to the degree of}} stunting of worm growth in recipient mice. Five laboratory strains of mice developed different levels of protective immunity following multiple experimental infections with N. dubius.

The frequency of <b>anti-N.</b> risticii <b>antibodies</b> was 16. 05 % (n= 113 / 704). The animal age and breeding region were the factors that influenced the seropositivity rate for N. risticii in the equids (p< 0. 05). Equids from the lowland region had higher seropositivity (p< 0. 05; OR= 5. 87) compared to those of the mountain region. The presence of snails on the farm was a factor associated with this result (p< 0. 05; OR= 2. 88). In the lowland region, age of the animal and site of breeding were protective factors for the detection of <b>antibodies</b> <b>anti-N.</b> risticii in equids, with lower frequency of seropositivity in younger animals (p< 0. 05; OR= 0. 06) and in animals raised in dry areas (p< 0. 05; OR= 0. 22). The presence of the target DNA of N. risticii by qPCR was not observed in any of the samples tested.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Bronchiolitis {{caused by}} the {{respiratory}} syncytial virus (RSV) in infants {{less than two years}} old is a growing public health concern worldwide, and there is currently no safe and effective vaccine. A major component of RSV nucleocapsid, the nucleoprotein (N), has been so far poorly explored as a potential vaccine antigen, even though it is a target of protective anti-viral T cell responses and is remarkably conserved between human RSV A and B serotypes. We recently reported a method to produce recombinant N assembling in homogenous rings composed of 10 - 11 N subunits enclosing a bacterial RNA. These nanoparticles were named sub-nucleocapsid ring structure (N SRS). METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The vaccine potential of N SRS was evaluated in a well-characterized and widely acknowledged mouse model of RSV infection. BALB/c adult mice were immunized intranasally with N SRS adjuvanted with the detoxified E. coli enterotoxin LT(R 192 G). Upon RSV challenge, vaccinated mice were largely protected against virus replication in the lungs, with a mild inflammatory lymphocytic and neutrophilic reaction in their airways. Mucosal immunization with N SRS elicited strong local and systemic immunity characterized by high titers of IgG 1, IgG 2 a and IgA <b>anti-N</b> <b>antibodies,</b> antigen-specific CD 8 (+) T cells and IFN-gamma-producing CD 4 (+) T cells.

Antibodies to N. caninum were found in 29 samples (7. 80 %). The present study was the first report of Neospora infection in this region and indicated that native cattle of Kurdistan province were exposed to this parasite...|$|R
40|$|Neospora caninum is a {{worldwide}} parasite {{recognized as one}} of the main parasites responsible for abortion in cattle. The objective of this study was to evaluate vertical transmission of N. caninum in dairy cows (Bos taurus) that were slaughtered at an abattoir in the state of Santa Catarina, southern Brazil. Blood samples (with and without EDTA) from 60 pregnant dairy cows and blood and tissue samples (brain, lung, heart and liver) from their fetuses were collected and used for PCR and serological evaluation. Blood samples from 60 non-pregnant cows were collected and used to detect <b>antibodies.</b> <b>Anti-N.</b> caninum <b>antibodies</b> were detected by indirect ELISA. Antibodies against N. caninum were observed in 41. 6 % (25 &# 8725; 60) of the pregnant cows and in 43. 3 % (26 &# 8725; 60) of the non-pregnant cows. Antibodies against the parasite were detected in sera from three fetuses (5. 5 %). PCR analysis revealed that 3. 3 % (2 &# 8725; 60) of the cows and 6. 6 % (4 &# 8725; 60) of the fetuses evaluated were positive for specific N. caninum primers. These positive fetuses were between 4 - 6 months of age. Therefore, considering PCR and serological tests to be indicative of vertical transmission in fetuses, 11. 6 % (7 &# 8725; 60) of the fetuses were infected by N. caninum during gestation...|$|R

40|$|AbstractMitochondria, microsomes and peroxisomes all express overt (cytosol-facing) {{carnitine}} palmitoyltransferase {{activity that}} is inhibitable by malonyl-CoA. The overt carnitine palmitoyltransferase activity (CPTo) associated with the different fractions was measured. Mitochondria accounted for 65 % of total cellular CPTo activity, with the microsomal and peroxisomal contributions accounting for the remaining 25 % and 10 %, respectively. In parallel experiments, rat livers were perfused in situ with medium containing dinitrophenyl (DNP) -etomoxir in order to inhibit quantitatively and label covalently (with DNP-etomoxiryl-CoA) the molecular species responsible for CPTo activity {{in each of the}} membrane systems under near-physiological conditions. In all three membrane fractions, a single protein with an identical molecular mass of approximately 88   000 kDa (p 88) was labelled after DNP-etomoxir perfusion of the liver. The abundance of labelled p 88 was quantitatively related to the respective specific activities of CPTo in each fraction. On Western blots the same protein was immunoreactive with three anti-peptide antibodies raised against linear epitopes of the cytosolic N- and C-domains and of the inter-membrane space loop (L) domain of the mitochondrial enzyme (L-CPT I). However, the reaction of the microsomal protein with the <b>anti-N</b> peptide <b>antibody</b> (raised against epitope Val- 14 –Lys- 29 of CPT I) was an order of magnitude stronger than expected from either microsomal CPTo activity or its DNP-etomoxiryl-CoA labelling. This suggests that the N-terminal domain of the microsomal protein differs from that in the mitochondrial or peroxisomal protein. This conclusion was confirmed using antibody back-titration experiments, in which the binding of <b>anti-N</b> and anti-C <b>antibodies</b> by mitochondria and microsomes was quantified...|$|R
40|$|Patients {{receiving}} hemodialysis therapy {{risk exposure}} to 'both disinfectants and sterilants. Dialysis equipment is disinfected periodically with strong solutions of hypochlorite or formaldehyde. More recently, reuse of dialyzers has introduced {{the use of}} additional sterilants, such as hydrogen peroxide and peracetic acid. The use of these sterilants is recognized by the center staffs and the home patient as a potential risk, and residue tests are carried out {{for the presence of}} these sterilants at the ppm level. Gross hemolysis resulting from accidental hypochlorite infusion has led to cardiac arrest, probably as a result of hyperkalemia. Formaldehyde is commonly used in 4 % solutions to sterilize the fluid paths of dialysis controllers and to sterilize dialyzers before reuse. It can react with red cell antigenic surfaces leading to the formation of <b>anti-N</b> <b>antibodies.</b> Such reactions probably do not occur with hypochlorite or chloramines. The major exposure risk is the low concentration of disinfectant found in municipal water used to prepare 450 L dialysate weekly. With thrice-weekly treatment schedules, the quality requirements for water used to make this solution must be met rigorously. Standards for water used in the preparation of dialysate have recently been proposed but not all patients are treated with dialysate meeting such standards. The introduction of sterilants via tap water is insidious and has led to more pervasive consequences. Both chlorine and chloramines, at concentrations found in potable water, are strong oxidants that cause extensive protein denaturation and hemolysis. Oxidation of the Fe 2 " in hemoglobin to Fe 3 " forms methemoglobin, which is incapable of carrying either 02 or CO 2. Chloramine can form not only methemoglobin, but can also denature proteins within the red cell, thus forming aggregates (Heinz bodies). Chloramines also inhibit hexose monophosphate shunt activity, a mechanism that makes the red cell even more susceptible to oxidant damage. These risks can only be minimized through close cooperation between the clinical staffs and the water carrier's technical personnel...|$|R

The objective of this study was to quantify the effect of Neospora caninum seropositivity on reproductive parameters in three dairy herds and the dynamics of <b>anti-N.</b> caninum <b>antibodies</b> during gestation in naturally infected cows. Blood samples from all animals were collected nine times on each of the three farms over a two-year period. Serum was tested for antibodies against N. caninum using the indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFAT) with a cutoff value of 1 : 100. The relative risk of abortion between N. caninum-seropositive and seronegative cows varied between samplings at all farms, but there was only a statistically significant difference (P 0. 05) were found regarding gestational age at abortion, repeated abortion, number of inseminations for conception and calving intervals, between seropositive and seronegative cows on all the farms...|$|R
40|$|Neorickettsia sennetsu {{has been}} {{described}} from Japan and Malaysia, causing a largely forgotten infectious mononucleosis-like disease. Because it {{is believed to be}} contracted from eating raw fish, frequently consumed in the Lao PDR, we looked for evidence of N. sennetsu among Lao patients and fish. A buffy coat from 1 of 91 patients with undifferentiated fever was positive by 16 S rRNA amplification and sequencing and real-time polymerase chain reactions (PCR) targeting two N. sennetsu genes. Lao blood donors and patients with fever, hepatitis, or jaundice (N = 1, 132) had a high prevalence (17 %) of immunofluorescence assay IgG <b>anti-N.</b> sennetsu <b>antibodies</b> compared with 4 % and 0 % from febrile patients (N = 848) in Thailand and Malaysia, respectively. We found N. sennetsu DNA by PCR, for the first time, in a fish (Anabas testudineus). These data suggest that sennetsu may be an under-recognized cause of fever and are consistent with the hypothesis that it may be contracted from eating raw fish...|$|R
40|$|Neosporosis, {{caused by}} an {{intracellular}} parasite, Neospora caninum, is an infectious disease primarily of cattle and dogs. It occurs worldwide and causes huge damages to dairy farms. In this study, we immunized mice with recombinant surface-associated protein 1 of N. caninum (rNcSAG 1) and developed two novel monoclonal antibodies, A 10 and H 3, against NcSAG 1 using phage-display technology. Both clones bound to purified rNcSAG 1 and the half maximal inhibitory concentrations of A 10 and H 3 are 50 and 72 nM of rNcSAG 1, respectively. In immunofluorescence assays, both A 10 and H 3 Fabs bound to N. caninum parasites. Direct detection of N. caninum parasites was developed firstly using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with A 10 and H 3. Binding of A 10 and H 3 antibodies to rNcSAG 1 was also inhibited by some certain <b>anti-N.</b> caninum <b>antibodies</b> in the neosporosis-positive cattle sera, suggesting they might bind to the same epitope...|$|R
40|$|The {{coagulant}} {{effects of}} Australasian black snakes (Pseudechis spp.) are poorly understood and differ to the procoagulant venoms of most dangerous snakes in Australia. This study aimed to investigate in vitro coagulant effects of Pseudechis venoms and {{the efficacy of}} commercial black snake antivenom (BlSAV), tiger snake antivenom (TSAV) and specific rabbit anti-snake IgG to neutralise these effects. Using a turbidimetric assay, all six Pseudechis venoms had anticoagulant activity, as well as phospholipase A₂ (PLA₂) activity. Inhibition of PLA₂ activity removed anticoagulant effects of the venoms. Pseudechis porphyriacus was unique and had procoagulant activity independent of PLA 2 activity. Both BlSAV and TSAV completely inhibited the coagulant and PLA 2 activity of all Pseudechis venoms. PLA 2 activity was also inhibited completely by p-Bromophenacyl bromide (pBPB) and partially by specific <b>anti-N.</b> scutatus IgG <b>antibodies.</b> <b>Anti-N.</b> scutatus IgG also completely inhibited anticoagulant activity of Pseudechis venom. All Pseudechis venoms showed immunological cross reactivity with specific anti-snake IgG antibodies to P. porphyriacus, Pseudechis australis and Notechis scutatus. Pseudechis venoms have in vitro anticoagulant activity {{that appears to be}} attributable to PLA₂ activity. Both antivenoms inhibited anticoagulant and PLA₂ activity at concentrations below those occurring in patients treated with one vial of antivenom. There was cross-neutralisation of Pseudechis venoms and N. scutatus antibodies that might be attributable to immunological similarities between the venoms...|$|R
