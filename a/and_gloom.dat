5|$|The next morning, the two {{armies of}} unequal {{strength}} {{faced each other}} across frozen fields fissured by ice-covered streams and ponds, which were in turn covered by snow and drifts. The snow <b>and</b> <b>gloom</b> meant that neither side {{was aware of the}} inequalities of men and artillery. Napoleon opened the engagement by sending Soult's's corps, which successfully pushed the Russian right flank back, nearly turning the Russian force. To follow up on this success, he ordered Pierre Augereau's force to attack the left center. No sooner had Augereau and VII Corps, plus St. Hilaire's division, sallied out when a sudden snow storm engulfed the battle field. In white-out conditions, Augereau's entire corps disappeared in a flurry of whirling snow. When the snow cleared, friend and foe alike discovered that the first units onto the field had wandered off course. The line of march should have taken them directly to the Russian flank; have no point of reference, they had instead followed the terrain and led the entire corps parallel to the Russian line, along a V-shaped formation in which the left and center merged, and directly into the face of the Russian 70–gun batteries. The artillery, although shocked to find a French Corps advancing straight toward them, immediately opened fire, as did the Russian infantry on both sides of Augereau's corps.|$|E
25|$|Similarly, Nystrom noted of the band's live performances: Well, {{it must be}} hard {{sometimes}} for Jonas to sing his heart out with lyrics referring to personal dark and depressive matters {{and at the same}} time also be accused of being a reluctant frontman. I actually think much of the stuff he sings about doesn't go in hand with running around on stage, throwing horns, smiling and firing up the audience. We're not an energetic power metal band. I think the withdrawn and shy aura actually does more justice to the concept of our songs than going wild, but we have some songs mainly on the two last albums that don't really fall into the doom <b>and</b> <b>gloom</b> category, but are still dark. And there the more aggressive approach fits better.|$|E
500|$|In 1907, {{journalist}} Lindsay Denison {{complained that}} Sunday preached [...] "the old, old doctrine of damnation", getting results by [...] "inspiring fear <b>and</b> <b>gloom</b> {{in the hearts}} of sinners."In spite of his conviction that the truly religious man should take his religion joyfully, he gets his results by inspiring fear <b>and</b> <b>gloom</b> {{in the hearts of}} sinners. The fear of death, with torment beyond it—intensified by examples of the frightful deathbeds of those who have carelessly or obdurately put off salvation until it is too late—it is with this mighty menace that he drives sinners into the fold. But Sunday himself told reporters [...] "with ill-concealed annoyance", that his revivals had [...] "no emotionalism." [...] Certainly contemporary comparisons to the extravagances of mid-nineteenth-century camp meetings—as in the famous drawing by George Bellows—were overdrawn. Sunday told one reporter that he believed that people could [...] "be converted without any fuss," [...] and, at Sunday's meetings, [...] "instances of spasm, shakes, or fainting fits caused by hysteria were few and far between." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Yodel It!", {{which is}} {{two minutes and}} 56 seconds in length, was made {{available}} for digital download on the iTunes Store on 30 January 2017 by Cat Music. On the same date, the label uploaded an audio video for the track to its YouTube channel. [...] "Yodel It!"

Alexandru eventually remixed the song and stretched it to three minutes and 41 seconds. An English language track, [...] "Yodel It!" [...] combines rock with pop and hip hop music. Ilinca yodels prominently during the chorus, while Florea provides rap vocals. The song runs at a moderate tempo of 87 beats per minute.

500|$|For {{the change}} from Ghost Rider to LMD, Joseph McCabe at Nerdist said that any doubts he had about the change [...] "are more or less eliminated" [...] by the series take on a robotic antagonist, which he called [...] "Avengers: Age of Ultron done right ... where it most {{obviously}} improves on the overstuffed second Avengers film is in the humor department". Schwartz called the transition smooth, and felt the series' ongoing Inhuman subplot complimented the LMD storyline well. Valentine said that the beginning of LMD [...] "doesn’t maintain the heights of [...] days with Ghost Rider in the driver’s seat, but it does manage to remain a solid entry on the airwaves." [...] He was very critical of the Inhuman subplot, calling the Watchdogs [...] "pretty much played out at this point" [...] and feeling the Inhumans had become stale after the previous two seasons. Fitzpatrick also criticized the [...] "flat" [...] Inhuman storyline, but felt the change to LMD [...] "got off to the best possible start" [...] given the [...] "obviously less of an immediate hook" [...] than Ghost Rider. Beginning the Agents of Hydra pod, Schwartz said [...] "this return episode more than delivered" [...] on the previous episode's cliffhanger. She was satisfied that the Framework reality was not undone within a single episode, and was hopeful that the remaining episodes of the season would offer [...] "similar surprises [...] our expectations". Valentine felt [...] "What If..." [...] "made for a very good start" [...] to the pod, feeling it [...] "continues {{to build on the}} goodwill created by season 4 of S.H.I.E.L.D. presenting an interesting concept and world to be explored". McCown-Levy continued the praise, saying [...] "This could’ve been a sodden slog through too-obvious reveals and portentous doom <b>and</b> <b>gloom.</b> Instead, S.H.I.E.L.D. kept its fleet and efficient pacing, but bent it to the service of a dark and compelling narrative arc already paying dividends in terms of rewarding long-time viewers with deep-pull references and stories". Fitzpatrick, however, felt the episode [...] "stumbled" [...] and was [...] "something of a bumpy reentry into season 4, and doubly so for anyone who lost sight of the Life Model Decoy conflict in play, or harbor concern ABC might not order a fifth season." [...] He found it difficult to determine the rules at play in the Framework, and felt the storyline was done more so because the [...] "producers missed working with Brett Dalton".|$|E

2500|$|With {{regard to}} the {{condition}} of healthy narcissism, {{it is suggested that}} this is correlated with good psychological health.

In certain social contexts such as initiating social relationships, and with certain outcome variables, such as feeling good about oneself, healthy narcissism can be helpful. In other contexts, such as maintaining long-term relationships and with other outcome variables, such as accurate self-knowledge, healthy narcissism can be unhelpful.|$|E

2500|$|Reynolds {{has spoken}} {{of a shift}} from early goth to gothic rock proper, {{advanced}} by the Sisters of Mercy. As journalist Jennifer Park put it, [...] "The original blueprint for gothic rock had mutated significantly. Doom <b>and</b> <b>gloom</b> was no longer confined to its characteristic atmospherics, but as the Sisters demonstrated, it could really rock". The Sisters of Mercy, who cited influences such as Leonard Cohen, Gary Glitter, Motörhead, the Stooges, the Velvet Underground, the Birthday Party, Suicide, and the Fall, created a new, harder form of gothic rock. In addition, they incorporated a drum machine. Reynolds identified their 1983 single [...] "Temple of Love" [...] as the quintessential goth anthem of the year, along with Southern Death Cult's [...] "Fatman". The group created their own record label, Merciful Release, which also signed the March Violets, who performed in a similar style. According to Simon Reynolds, the March Violets [...] "imitated Joy Division sonically". Another band, the Danse Society was particularly inspired by the Cure's Pornography period.|$|E
2500|$|James D. Séguin, in {{a tribute}} to Harry Nelson Pillsbury on page 127 of the July 1906 American Chess Bulletin (reprinted from the New Orleans Times-Democrat) remarked of Leonard: With the {{admitted}} exception of the king of chess kings, our own Paul Morphy, Pillsbury assuredly stands as the finest exponent of the game that America has yet produced – unless perhaps on a plane with him may be placed the natural (though never fairly developed) capacity of that remarkable if erratic and early eclipsed genius of the early sixties, James Leonard, of New York, whose life so soon disappeared amid the smoke <b>and</b> <b>gloom</b> of battle in the great Civil War. But, of course, lack of opportunity to attain development of genius on Leonard's side precludes fair comparison in this instance. Gustavus Reichhelm went even further, writing in 1898 that Leonard [...] "was, after Morphy, the most promising player America ever produced". In 2005, a biography of Leonard by chess historian John S. Hilbert was published, entitled The Tragic Life and Short Chess Career of James A. Leonard, 1841-1862.|$|E
2500|$|Australian {{literature}} was equally developing a distinct voice. The classic Australian writers Henry Lawson, Banjo Paterson, Miles Franklin, Norman Lindsay, Steele Rudd, Mary Gilmore, C J Dennis and Dorothea Mackellar were all forged by—and indeed helped to forge—this period of growing national identity. Views of Australia at times conflicted—Lawson and Paterson contributed {{a series of}} verses to The Bulletin magazine in which they engaged in a literary debate {{about the nature of}} life in Australia: Lawson (a republican socialist) derided Paterson as a romantic, while Paterson (a country born city lawyer) thought Lawson full of doom <b>and</b> <b>gloom.</b> Paterson wrote the lyrics of the much-loved folksong Waltzing Matilda in 1895. The song has often been suggested as Australia's national anthem and Advance Australia Fair, the Australian national anthem since the late 1970s, itself was written in 1887. Dennis wrote of laconic heroes in the Australian vernacular, while McKellar rejected a love of England's pleasant pastures in favour of what she termed a [...] "Sunburnt Country" [...] in her iconic poem: My Country (1903).|$|E

His loss of pride (resulting in theft of the residents Christmas club money) and the deterioration of his health as a result, was an important issue that Tony Holland wanted to get right. His character had [...] "to reach the gutter" [...] before he could be put on the [...] "straight and narrow again".

So, we just kind of wanted to change it up and do something a little different." [...] Further elaboration was also given on the 'science fiction concept album' idea, with Cronise explaining that [...] "It's psychedelic, in a way. It's not like Star Wars science fiction ... laser guns and action all the time. It's more cerebral in that it's still mythological in the way it's told. It's science fiction and there's spaceships and robots, but it doesn't take place in the future. It's just like another planet far away sort of thing. Otherworldly.
