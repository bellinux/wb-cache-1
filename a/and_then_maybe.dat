500|$|Prior to the {{production}} of season two, rumors circulated that upcoming episodes would feature a love interest for Kurt. Initial fan and media speculation suggested that Sam Evans (Chord Overstreet) was created to fill this role; however, according to Overstreet, Sam's storyline quickly paired him with Quinn Fabray (Dianna Agron) {{as a result of the}} chemistry the producers detected between him and Agron. In September 2010, it was confirmed that Criss would join the show in a [...] "much-talked-about new gay role". Media speculation suggested that Blaine would be Kurt's new love interest. His original character description was: [...] "a cute and charismatic gay student from a rival Glee club named the Dalton Academy Warblers—will maintain a strictly platonic friendship with McKinley High's most out and proud pupil. But could that change as the season progresses? Yes, it could." [...] Murphy stated that Blaine's arc would be a significant one. He explained, [...] "He sort of becomes Kurt's mentor <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>maybe</b> love [...] Kurt really admires him and respects him." ...|$|E
