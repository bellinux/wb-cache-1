50|$|As a cytological evidence, in first, {{mammalian}} X chromosomes {{in various}} species, including human and mouse, have {{nearly the same}} size, with the content of about 5% of the genome. Second, for individual gene loci, a number of X-linked genes are common through mammalian species. Examples are found in glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), a gene for polypeptide of <b>antihemophilic</b> <b>globulin</b> (AHG or Factor VIII) in hemophilia A and B, and plasma thromboplastin component gene (PTC or Factor IX). Moreover, no instances were found where an X-linked gene in one species was located on an autosome in the other species.|$|E

40|$|Experiments {{were carried}} out to {{determine}} whether a diet known to produce coronary thrombosis in rats (Hartroft, O'Neal and Thomas 6) could produce increases in <b>antihemophilic</b> <b>globulin</b> (AHG), Factor V, and other coagulation factors. In animals continuously fed the thrombogenic diet the concentration of AHG increased to 186 % of normal by two weeks and to 373 % by eight weeks. The concentration of Factor V rose to a lesser extent, reaching 138 % compared to a normal value of 100 %. The prothrombin time, stypven time and plasma clotting time also showed significant changes. After thrombin injections, the mortality from massive thrombosis was significantly higher in fat-fed rats. As a considerable number of rats on this diet were shown to develop spontaneous thrombosis, the coagulation disturbances here described acquire added importance...|$|E
40|$|Three {{different}} {{properties of}} factor VIII (<b>antihemophilic</b> <b>globulin)</b> were studied after infusion of 500 ml of six per cent Dextran 70 to healthy volunteers. This dose caused {{no change in}} the factor VIII coagulant activity while there was a significant but temporary decrease of factor VIII related antigen. The Ristocetin induced platelet aggregation analysed with native as well as with formalin-fixed platelets, also decreased significantly. The maximal decrease was found a few hours after the infusion. The decrease was seen only if Dextran was infused in vivo and not if Dextran was added to blood in vitro. The dysfunction of factor VIII caused by Dextran resembles that found in one variant of von Willebrand's disease. This finding probably explains the platelet function inhibiting properties of Dextran, and may be of significance for its antithrombotic effects...|$|E
40|$|Taldenstr# 246 m These {{abnormalities}} {{are most}} frequently at-tributed to abnormal platelet function, 1 and depression of specific clotting factors {{appears to be a}} rare occurrence. Nilehn 2 includes four instances of <b>antihemophilic</b> <b>globulin</b> (factor VIII) deficiency in a survey of macroglobulin-emia among other disorders, but does not elaborate on the mechanism. In contrast, other authors 3 ’ 4 have found high levels of factor VIII in the dyspro-teinemias, including macroglobulinemia. The present report is concerned with acquired deficiency of factor VIII occurring in a patient with macroglobulin-emia, in whom clinical and laboratory studies indicate that the macroglobulin behaved as an inhibitor of this factor.

40|$|<b>Antihemophilic</b> <b>globulin</b> (AHF, factor VIII) {{levels were}} {{measured}} by a standard coagulation assay and by an immunological technique before and serially after infusion of fresh frozen plasma or cryoprecipitate into patients with von Willebrand's disease. Initial levels of AHF, measured both as procoagulant and as antigen, were low. Immediately after transfusions, the rise in levels of AHF-like antigen was compatible with the quantity of antigen present in the infused plasma or cryoprecipitate. Thereafter, levels of antigen declined rapidly and reached preinfusion values in approximately 24 hr. In contrast, procoagulant activity remained elevated, and sometimes continued to rise, {{for longer periods of}} time. One possible explanation of this finding is that the AHF molecule produced by patients with von Willebrand's disease, in response to transfusion of as yet unidentified factors, lacks the antigenic site associated with the normal AHF molecule or the inactive molecule produced by patients with hemophilia A...|$|E
40|$|A {{study was}} made of the <b>antihemophilic</b> <b>globulin</b> (AHG) content of 16 units of freshly frozen, single-donor, type {{specific}} plasma prepared by the Los Angeles Red Cross Blood Center for the treatment of patients with coagulation disorders. Three specimens were examined for each unit—(1) a control sample taken from the donor in a separate small tube, (2) a plasma unit sample before storage, and (3) a plasma unit sample after storage for periods up to one year. From a comparison of the AHG content of Samples 1 and 2, it was found that little AHG was lost in preparing the plasma units. From a comparison of Samples 2 and 3, it was found that a moderate AHG loss (averaging about 20 per cent) occurs on storage. This varied unpredictably from bottle to bottle and was unrelated to the duration of storage. Good AHG activity was found in 4 units after storage for one year...|$|E

40|$|Triiodothyronine (liothyronine sodium) (400 - 500 μg/day for 14 days) {{was given}} to six normal subjects. Factor VIII (<b>antihemophilic</b> <b>globulin)</b> {{activity}} increased from 109 to 167 % (P < 0. 05); fibrinogen increased from 344 to 581 mg/ 100 ml (P < 0. 01). To test whether the increases in factor VIII activity and fibrinogen were mediated by beta adrenergic receptors, propranolol (20 mg every 6 hr) was given orally to four other normal subjects in addition to triiodothyronine for 14 days. Factor VIII increased from 100 to 161 %; fibrinogen increased from 374 to 564 % (P < 0. 01). Factor VIII activity did not change in a severe classical hemophiliac made hypermetabolic with triiodothyronine, but it increased from 39 to 82 % in a patient with von Willebrand's disease. Triiodothyronine-induced hypermetabolism increased the incorporation of selenomethionine- 75 Se into plasma fibrinogen. These {{results suggest that the}} increases in clotting factor activity during triiodothyronine-induced hypermetabolism reflect an effect of increased protein synthesis rather than enhanced stimulation of beta adrenergic receptors...|$|E
40|$|There is much {{evidence}} favoring {{the concept of}} coagulation as a continuous process in the normal subject. In order {{to learn more about}} the dy-namics of this process, we have been studying the survival of physiological amounts of the various clotting factors in the normal subject. With the development of isotope labeling, it has for the first time become possible to carry out such stud-ies. We (1 - 3) and others (1 - 10) have applied this technique to studies of platelet and fibrinogen turnover. These studies were possible because both platelets and fibrinogen are present in large amounts and can be separated in relatively pure form. Isotope techniques have not yet been ap-plied to a study of the other proteins involved in coagulation because they are present in relatively trace amounts and cannot yet be isolated in suffi-ciently pure form. In order to overcome these problems, we have developed a technique of in vivo labeling, sepa-rating, and counting two of the clotting proteins, Factor VIII (<b>antihemophilic</b> <b>globulin)</b> as an ex-ample of a protein consumed during coagulation and Factor IX (plasma thromboplastin compo-nent, Christmas factor) as an example of a clot-ting protein not consumed during coagulation. METHODS In vivo labeling. Because of the extremely labile na-ture of many of the clotting factors, we used a labeling method that involves minimal in vitro manipulation. W...|$|E
40|$|Hemostasis is {{essential}} to life; it {{is the ability of}} organism to stop bleeding and to maintain the fluidity of the blood in an intact vascular bed at one time. Factor VIII is called <b>antihemophilic</b> <b>globulin</b> or antihemophilic factor. It is a plasma glycoprotein composed of two noncovalently associated chains. One chain is a heavy one, comprising domains A 1 - A 2 - B and the light chain composed of the domains A 3 - C 1 -C 2. FVIII activity was measured in two ways from historical reasons a) a one-phase method, where a mixture of FVIII deficient plasma and patient plasma is analyzed using APTT assay; the absence of FVIII in the patient plasma leads to lengthening of the time, b) two-phase method, where the first step leads to formation of FVIIIa and FXa and in the second phase there are thrombin and fibrin created. Two-phase method is difficult to implement in routine laboratory, and therefore it was stopped using during time. This method was substituted by the chromogenic method after development of the chromogenic substrates, where there is in the first step created FVIIIa and FXa in the presence of FIXa, phospholipids and Ca 2 +, and in the second step there is formed a yellow coloration by the addition of the chromogenic substrate. FVIII deficiency causes a severe bleeding disorder, hemophilia A. I performed measurements from May to September 2013 at Coagulation laboratory at the Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion in Prague, where I was employed. I examined in total 76 patients, hemophiliacs A, who were at least 8 days without any treatment or substitution. I assigned numbers to patient's samples to ensure anonymity of patients. I worked with the automatic coagulation analyzer STA- R Evolution? from Diagnostica Stago, which works on the principle of photometry and chronometry. I determined the factor VIII by one-phase method and two-phase method and I compared the results. The genetic part of the work was analyzed in the genetic laboratory, which is part of our department. I worked up the results obtained from both methods in 76 patients to the table and the graph. The group included 14 (18 %) moderate and 56 (74 %) of mild hemophiliacs, then 6 (8 %) hemophiliacs who did not meet the criterion of a mild hemophilia A, but clinically they belonged into mild hemophiliacs. Based on the stated criteria, we found out that 15 (20 %) patients had a ratio of FVIII: C 1 st/FVIII: Chr or FVIII: Chr / FVIII: C 1 st 0. 6, they differed significantly in their values set by one-stage clotting FVIII and FVIII set by the chromogenic method. A total of 11 patients with FVIII activity were higher in the single-phase method. At three patients FVIII: C 1 st was even on the upper limit of the normal value, while FVIII chromogenic method gave on average 16 %. We managed to find a causal mutation in the FVIII in 14 patients with "the different results", we could not investigate 1 patient genetically because of the missing genetic material. Mutations in patients with lower activity of FVIII set up by the chromogenic two-phase method were concentrated predominantly into the A 3 domain; mutations in patients with FVIII a lower activity set up by one-phase clotting assay were concentrated in the A 2 domain. The results presented show, that diagnostic of any patient with mild or moderate hemophilia A should include determination of FVIII by both methods; FVIII: C 1 st and FVIII: Chr...|$|E
