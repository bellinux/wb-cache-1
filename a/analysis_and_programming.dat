5000|$|In general, Winograd's work at Stanford {{has focused}} on {{software}} design in a broader sense than software engineering. In 1991 he founded the [...] "Project on People, Computers and Design" [...] {{in order to promote}} teaching and research into software design. The book [...] "Bringing Design to Software" [...] describes some of this work. His thesis is that software design is a distinct activity from both <b>analysis</b> <b>and</b> <b>programming,</b> but it should be informed by both, as well as by design practices in other professions (textile design, industrial design, etc.).|$|E

50|$|Most DBMSs offer {{a number}} of {{transaction}} isolation levels, which control the degree of locking that occurs when selecting data. For many database applications, the majority of database transactions can be constructed to avoid requiring high isolation levels (e.g. SERIALIZABLE level), thus reducing the locking overhead for the system. The programmer must carefully analyze database access code to ensure that any relaxation of isolation does not cause software bugs {{that are difficult to}} find. Conversely, if higher isolation levels are used, the possibility of deadlock is increased, which also requires careful <b>analysis</b> <b>and</b> <b>programming</b> techniques to avoid.|$|E

50|$|Adel Abdul Jaleel Batterjee {{was born}} on March 11, 1946, to a {{prominent}} merchant family in the Hejaz region of Saudi Arabia. After completing his primary and secondary education in 1963, Adel A. Batterjee pursued mathematics at the University of Kansas at Lawrence, Kansas U. S. A., graduating in 1967 with a bachelor's degree. After working {{for over two years}} as a graduate assistant at King Fahd University for Petroleum & Minerals, he joined The Arabian Oil Company (Aramco) as a computer systems analyst where he spent approximately four years. He then started his own business in computer <b>analysis</b> <b>and</b> <b>programming</b> in Riyadh.

50|$|In {{the early}} sixties {{she moved to}} the private sector, working first with the American Research Bureau and later for a {{software}} company, Datatrol Corporation. Both jobs consisted of systems <b>analysis</b> <b>and</b> <b>programming,</b> but it was at Datatrol that Avram had her first professional experience with libraries. Asked to design a computer science library, she quickly read several library science text books in order to learn the appropriate jargon. She also hired a librarian to assist her in the design process. It was through this project that Avram was introduced to the Library of Congress Card Division Service. She also did consulting work with Frederick Kilgour, father of the Online Computer Library Center, on OCLC’s first attempt at computerizing bibliographic information. In March 1965, Avram heard of an opening at the Library of Congress, and was hired as a systems analyst in the Office of the Information Systems Specialist.|$|E
5000|$|Dr. Adel Batterjee {{started his}} {{professional}} life as a graduate assistance at King Fahad University for Petroleum and Minerals (KFUPM) in Dhahran Saudi Arabia. After almost three years in that position, he moved to Aramco, the national oil company as a systems analyst where he remained for four years. Having gained enough technical experience in systems <b>analysis</b> <b>and</b> <b>programming,</b> Dr. Batterjee moved to Riyadh where he established his private business in computer systems, serving both government and private entities. Although his business flourished and his company, Cap Saudi Arabia {{became one of the}} leading companies in the field in the country, his passion for education remained close to his heart. This passion prompted Dr. Batterjee to establish two private schools in Jeddah, his hometown, one for boys and the other for girls. Both school target middle to upper class sectors of the society and provide programs to nourish giftedness. Having realized the need for targeting the gifted and talented students, Dr. Batterjee pursued and received a PhD in Education Psychology. In his thesis, Dr. Batterjee developed a model to discover and nourish giftedness. Pursuant to his PhD, he worked on and published numerous papers on intelligence, education, and giftedness. Samples of his research is published on his web site: [...] and on http://www.researchgate.net/. Influenced by the philosophies of both Plato and Al Ghazali, Dr. Batterjee believes that education is the key factor to the development of societies. Better education generally improves the socio-economic output of societies (for further reading on this, refer to Dr. Batterjee’s paper on IQ and Education: Intelligence and Education: The Saudi Case). This can be recognized in various forms such as success in life, social complexity, technological innovation, attitudes and values, the nature of political system employed, the extend of the rule of law, health and environmental awareness and economic development.Furthermore, Dr. Batterjee believes that members of the intellectual elite of societies (99th percentile of IQ distribution) are major contributor to societies intellectual output, high earnings, educational attainment, socioeconomic status, and job proficiency (for further reading on this, refer to Dr. Batterjee’s paper on [...] ).|$|E
