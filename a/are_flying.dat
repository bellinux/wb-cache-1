5|$|Pilotwings 64 is a 3D amateur flight {{simulator}} {{that puts the}} player in control of one of six pilots {{as they try to}} earn pilot licenses through various forms of aviation. The events <b>are</b> <b>flying</b> an autogyro, using a jet pack, and hang gliding. Several bonus tasks are offered, such as skydiving and a human cannonball test. The game also puts focus on allowing the player to freely explore its detailed 3D environments, most notably a miniature representation of the United States.|$|E
5|$|Exasperated, Candace {{returns to}} the circus, where Jeremy has saved a spot for her, only for the boys to mistake her for Buford and include her in his act. She is sent flying through {{the roof of the}} tent, just as Doofenshmirtz and Perry <b>are</b> <b>flying</b> overhead. Doofenshmirtz's machine activates, giving {{everyone}} in the cirque audience high-pitched voices that cause the tent to rupture. The high velocity of Doofenshmirtz's flying machine propels the tent up into the air, destroying the machine and sending Doofenshmirtz flying off (with a high voice). Jeremy gives a CD to Candace, but Candace is not at the house, but Candace then gets the CD from Jeremy.|$|E
5|$|Launching a fresh assault, Pit {{succeeds in}} {{injuring}} Hades, but the Great Sacred Treasure is badly damaged {{during the battle}} leaving only its cannon intact. Hades attempts to launch a massive attack, but a revived Medusa injures him further, giving Palutena the chance to charge the Great Sacred Treasure's cannon with her power. Pit then uses the cannon to obliterate Hades' body, saving the world. At {{the start of the}} credits, Pit and Dark Pit <b>are</b> <b>flying</b> around as Palutena and Viridi have a brief argument.|$|E

5000|$|The four {{sentences}} in Torres Strait Creole carry a semantic difference difficult {{to show in}} the English translation. Plein i dhe go plai is the basic sentence — 'the plane <b>is</b> <b>flying</b> away over there'. Plein i plai dhe go is more {{along the lines of}} 'the plane <b>is</b> <b>flying</b> away that way'; plein i plai go dhea is 'the plane <b>is</b> <b>flying</b> away heading that way', and finally plein i dhe plai go is 'the plane <b>is</b> there <b>flying</b> away'.|$|R
5|$|The tremolo call—sometimes {{called the}} “laughing” call—is {{characterized}} by its short, wavering quality. It often uses this call to signal distress or alarm caused by territorial disputes or perceived threats. It emits a tremulous series {{of up to}} 10 rather high notes (hu)-heheheheheheha. It also uses the tremolo to communicate its presence to other loons when they arrive at a lake, often when they <b>are</b> <b>flying</b> overhead. It is the only vocalization used in flight. The tremolo call has varying three levels of intensities that correlate with a loon’s level of distress, and the types are differentiated by increasingly higher pitch frequencies added to the call.|$|E
5|$|Arthur and {{his mother}} Atlanna <b>are</b> <b>flying</b> over the Bermuda Triangle. As they get closer, Atlanna's {{necklace}} begins to glow and a surge of light and energy erupts from the ocean, causing cyclones which bring their plane down. Atlanna is kidnapped by a siren, but not before giving Arthur her necklace and calling him Orin. Ten years later, Arthur is charged for releasing dolphins from a marine park. His father bails him out of trouble, but gives him a stern lecture on responsibility. Later, Arthur tells his friend Eva that he felt like the dolphins were calling to him. While he's working, he is approached by a lighthouse keeper who identifies himself as McCaffery. The Coast Guard picks up an unidentified man floating in the Bermuda Triangle and pleading to warn Orin. Lt. Torres is sent to investigate the area. Arthur is also at the Triangle, and his necklace triggers another surge of light, which causes Torres to crash her jet. Brigman transports the John Doe to another facility, and persuades Torres to join his team. Brigman {{is looking for a}} connection between the disappearances of thousands of individuals, and their reappearance years later without ever aging a day.|$|E
5|$|By 11 a.m., it {{was clear}} that a {{breakthrough}} was not forthcoming and the advances by Sherman and McPherson were failures. Just then, Grant received a message from McClernand, which stated that he was heavily engaged, the Confederates were being reinforced, and he requested a diversion on his right from McPherson's corps. Grant initially refused the request, telling McClernand to use his own reserve forces for assistance; Grant was mistakenly under the impression that McClernand had been lightly engaged and McPherson heavily, although the reverse was true. McClernand followed up with a message that was partially misleading, implying that he had captured two forts"The Stars and Stripes <b>are</b> <b>flying</b> over them."—and that another push along the line would achieve victory for the Union Army. Although Grant once again demurred, he showed the dispatch to Sherman, who ordered his own corps to advance again. Grant, reconsidering, then ordered McPherson to send Quinby's division to aid McClernand.|$|E

50|$|El Oro {{entered the}} {{approach}} from the southwest, passing slightly {{west of the}} NDB, as opposed to directly over it. The pilot began the turn correctly, but <b>was</b> <b>flying</b> too fast; the aircraft <b>was</b> <b>flying</b> at 230 knots, rather than the required 180. This took the 727 wide of its intended course; {{by the time it}} came around to a westerly heading, it <b>was</b> <b>flying</b> not towards the runway, but {{into the side of the}} Cumbal Volcano.|$|R

5|$|To {{properly}} {{tell the}} international {{aspects of the}} story, filming for Sense8 took place almost entirely on location around the globe. In the first season they filmed in nine cities located in eight countries: Berlin, Chicago, London, Mexico City, Mumbai, Nairobi, Reykjavík, San Francisco, and Seoul. Production on the first season began on June 18, 2014 in San Francisco. The filmmakers successfully negotiated with {{the organizers of the}} Clarion Alley Mural Project and select artists to feature their artwork in the show. Shooting in Chicago began on July 9 and wrapped up on August 8, with filming taking place both on location and at the Cinespace Film Studios. They shot some scenes in the Superdawg drive-through restaurant, while customers were being asked not to stare at the filming. Lana and Lilly Wachowski are frequent customers of the place. During location scouting, the producers found the City Methodist Church in Gary, Indiana which is nearby Chicago, and changed one site's description in the scripts to a church accordingly in order to fit that particular site into the filming. They filmed in the church from July 25 to 28. Filming proceeded to London for a short shoot and then to Iceland, where between August 26 and September 6 they shot in Reykjavik and nearby places such as Akranes. Filming then started in Nairobi, where a sequence required a crowd of 700 extras, 200 cars and a helicopter. In Seoul they filmed from September 18 to 30. Next they moved to Mexico City and later to Germany, where they filmed in Berlin and inside Babelsberg Studio. Last place they visited was Mumbai where they also shot a Bollywood dance number that was choreographed by Slumdog Millionaires Longinus Fernandes. The writers wanted to feature an event in each city. They were able to schedule the Pride scenes with its Dykes on Bikes on the Dyke March in San Francisco, the Fourth of July fireworks celebration in Chicago, and the Ganesha Chaturthi Hindu festival in Mumbai. Additionally they recorded footage from the Fresh Meat Festival of transgender and queer performance in San Francisco, a club event taking place at the KOKO in London, and a real lucha libre (Mexican professional wrestling) event with the fighters wearing wrestling masks in Arena Naucalpan, in Mexico City. Lastly the scenes where characters <b>are</b> <b>flying</b> on an airplane were recorded during the real flights the cast and crew had to do to get from London to Iceland. On November 17, 2014 Straczynski wrote that the main unit shooting had wrapped, with only a few winter shots in Iceland remaining to be captured the next month. These scenes were further delayed to mid-January 2015, until Iceland had the necessary amount of snow, with the wrap party taking place in Reykjavík's Harpa Music and Concert hall on January 21. By the end of the shooting, the filmmakers had completed 100,000 miles of flight time, or four times around the globe.|$|E
25|$|The true {{measure of}} pilot ability and {{experience}} is usually shown by his final {{standing in a}} contest.

25|$|Opinions partly differ about {{sleep in}} migratory birds. The {{controversy}} is mainly {{about whether they}} can sleep while flying or not.

Currently {{a number of the}} DH.2 replicas <b>are</b> <b>flying</b> worldwide. Redfern's original replica is now on display at the Omaka Aviation Heritage Centre in Blenheim, New Zealand.|$|E
25|$|Since the {{invention}} of electrical telecommunication devices in the 19th century, players of a string quartet can even conduct a conversation when they <b>are</b> <b>flying</b> over the audience in four separate helicopters, as in the Helicopter String Quartet by Karlheinz Stockhausen. When the piece was performed in 1995, the players had earphones with a click track {{to enable them to}} play at the right time.|$|E

25|$|Tennis is a sport among Indians {{in urban}} areas. Tennis has gained {{popularity}} after {{the exploits of}} Vijay Amritraj. India's fortunes in Grand Slam singles have been unimpressive, although Leander Paes won a singles bronze medal at the 1996 Olympics. Since the late 1990s India has had impressive results in Grand Slam doubles, Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi have won many men's doubles and mixed doubles Grand Slam titles. Sania Mirza is the most notable Indian woman tennis player, having won a WTA title and breaking into the Top 30 WTA rankings, also winning three Grand Slam doubles events, the first at Wimbledon in 2015. On the men's side, young Somdev Devvarman and Yuki Bhambri <b>are</b> <b>flying</b> India's flag on the ATP Tour. Yuki was the Australian Open junior singles champion in 2009. Rohan Bopanna has won two mixed doubles titles.|$|E
25|$|When a note {{depicts a}} past prime minister, the Parliament {{buildings}} behind him <b>are</b> <b>flying</b> whichever flag Canada was using {{at the time}} of his tenure. The face of the Birds series featured images of prime ministers (or the Queen) and the houses of Parliament. However, as noted above, the $10 note featured the Red Ensign alongside Sir John A. Macdonald, who became prime minister 25 years before the Red Ensign was approved for use on the Merchant Marine and more than 50 years before it was used on government buildings. Also, the Union Flag is on the $100 with Sir Robert Borden, who came after Laurier who appears with the Red Ensign. This is sometimes explained by the fact that Borden governed during World War I. The views of the Houses of Parliament on the current Canadian Journey series do not feature any flag.|$|E
