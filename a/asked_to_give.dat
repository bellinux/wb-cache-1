When <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> security for his peaceful departure, he declined, but later realized the futility of defiance after spending a night in custody. When directed not to preach during his two weeks of preparation, he again refused, {{and this time the}} court determined that such an injunction was not worth pursuing.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} to Ayabe, Ueshiba began a regimen of spiritual training, regularly retreating {{to the mountains}} or performing misogi in the Nachi Falls. As his prowess as a martial artist increased, his fame began to spread. He was challenged by many established martial artists, some of whom later became his students after being defeated by him. In the autumn of 1925 he was <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> a demonstration of his art in Tokyo, {{at the behest of}} Admiral Isamu Takeshita; one of the spectators was Yamamoto Gonnohyōe, who requested that Ueshiba stay in the capital to instruct the Imperial Guard in his martial art. After a couple of weeks, however, Ueshiba took issue with several government officials who voiced concerns about his connections to Deguchi; he cancelled the training and returned to Ayabe.|$|E
5|$|Later studies {{investigated}} {{aspects of}} the effect. Koole, Dijksterhuis, and van Knippenberg sought to explore how automatic the preference process was. They did this with both numbers and letters. They divided participants into two groups. The first group was <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> quick, intuitive reactions stating preferences for the stimuli. The second group was asked to reason why they liked some numbers better than others and to analyse which features of the numbers they liked. As the researchers had predicted, they found that both the birthday-number effect and name-letter effect disappeared in the ‘thinking’ condition. They argued that thinking about reasons instigates deliberative overriding of implicit self-esteem effects. This conclusion was supported by looking at correlations between the effects: whereas in the feeling condition {{the strength of a}} participant's birthday-number effect was correlated to his or her name-letter effect, no such correlation was found in the thinking condition.|$|E

While the Frag Kit 6 was designed to meet the threat of EFPs, the MRAPII competition's purpose was to find a vehicle that did not need the upgrade kit. The U.S. Army Research laboratory worked to ensure the technologies used in Frag Kit6 would be available to MRAPII designers. The 2007 solicitation <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> the Joint Program Management Office greater flexibility.|$|E
25|$|People {{are more}} likely to {{cooperate}} on a task if they can communicate with one another first. This may be due to better assessments of cooperativeness or due to exchange of promises. They are more cooperative if they can gradually build trust, instead of being <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> extensive help immediately. Direct reciprocity and cooperation in a group can be increased by changing the focus and incentives from intra-group competition to larger scale competitions such as between groups or against the general population. Thus, giving grades and promotions based only on an individual's performance relative to a small local group, as is common, may reduce cooperative behaviors in the group.|$|E
25|$|Student {{involvement}} {{in the classroom is}} a key part of OBE. Students are expected to do their own learning, so that they gain a full understanding of the material. Increased student involvement allows students to feel responsible for their own learning, and they should learn more through this individual learning. Other aspects of involvement are parental and community, through developing curriculum, or making changes to it. OBE outcomes are meant to be decided upon within a school system, or at a local level. Parents and community members are <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> input in order to uphold the standards of education within a community and to ensure that students will be prepared for life after school.|$|E

His {{popularity}} rose quickly, and before long he was offered a position at the Dudley Street Church in Boston, Massachusetts. As his popularity on the pulpit grew, so did his demand as a lecturer. While preaching in Boston, Dixon was <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> the commencement address at Wake Forest University. Additionally, he was offered a possible honorary doctorate from the university. Dixon himself rejected the offer, but he sang high praises about a relative unknown who Dixon believed deserved the honor, his old friend Woodrow Wilson.

With Kurt {{constantly}} accusing Styles and Karen of an affair and both denying anything beyond friendship, Styles quit The Angle Alliance. In retaliation, Tomko cost Styles his King of the Mountain qualifying match against Booker T. At Slammiversary, Styles defeated Angle, but was beat-down by Angle and Tomko after the match. The feud continued through Hard Justice, with Styles and Angle trading wins {{and on the}} following episode of Impact! he defeated Angle for his Olympic gold medal. Styles also won the rematch ladder match the following week to end their feud, but he was later <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> Angle back his gold medal by Jeff Jarrett {{in an effort to}} try to mend things with Angle.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} 1916 a {{combined}} operation against Borkum, Ostend and Zeebrugge had been considered by Admiral Lewis Bayly, senior officer {{on the coast of}} Ireland. The plan was rejected due to the difficulty of supplying a landing force and the vulnerability of such a force to a land counter-attack; subsequent proposals were rejected for the same reasons. A bombardment of the Zeebrugge lockgates under cover of a smoke-screen, was studied by Vice Admiral Sir Reginald Bacon, commander of the Dover Patrol and the Admiralty in late 1915 but was also rejected, because the risks were considered excessive. In 1916, Commodore Reginald Tyrwhitt proposed an attack to block Zeebrugge, which was rejected. Tyrwhitt proposed a more ambitious operation to capture the mole and the town, as a prelude to advancing on Antwerp. Bacon was <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> his opinion and rejected the plan, as did the Admiralty.|$|E

25|$|Haughey was {{appointed}} by Fianna Fáil to run President Éamon de Valera's re-election campaign for the 1966 Irish presidential election. His interventions proved highly controversial. Fine Gael chose a comparatively young Teachta Dála and barrister, Tom O'Higgins (nephew of Kevin O'Higgins) to run against de Valera. Aware that de Valera's age (84) and almost total blindness might compare unfavourably to O'Higgins, whose campaign drew comparisons with the equally youthful United States president John F. Kennedy, Haughey launched what {{was seen as a}} political stroke. He insisted that it was beneath the presidency to actively campaign, meaning that de Valera would have a low profile. Therefore, in the interests of fairness the media was <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> O'Higgins an equally low profile, ignoring his speeches and publicity campaign. The print media, both nationally and locally, ignored Haughey's suggestion. But the state-run Telifís Éireann, facing criticism from Lemass' government for being too radical in other areas, agreed and largely ignored the O'Higgins campaign.|$|E
25|$|From the Tudor period, as {{evidenced}} by memorials in Seale church, the main landowner was the Woodroffe family (of whom two, David and Nicholas, father and son, were Sheriffs of London in 1554 and 1573 respectively), and later, by descent through a female line, the Chester family. They were seated at Poyle, Tongham, {{on the other side}} of the Hog's Back, which was originally part of the parish of Seale; their landholdings also extended south of the Hog's Back into what remained of the parish of Seale after Tongham was split off into a separate parish in 1866. As late as 1899, Henry Chester objected to being <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> up his pew in Seale Church when a new plan was circulated by the churchwardens. The mansion at Poyle Park is now demolished and its lands subdivided in the twentieth century – an interior from Poyle Park is on display in the Museum of London.|$|E

He was <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> the tactical vehicle a name as a formality {{when he was a}} guest in Indodefence 2012. The naming of the vehicle was because the Komodo dragon symbolizes Indonesia as a whole. President Yudhoyono was accompanied during the naming ceremony by various officials including Defense Minister Purnomo Yusgiantoro, Deputy Defense Minister Sjafrie, Police Chief General Timur Pradopo, Armed Forces Commander Admiral Agus Suhartono, Vice Governor of Jakarta Tjahaja Basuki Purnama and other high-ranking officials. A production plan of at least 240 Komodo tactical vehicles was planned after it was unveiled in Indodefence 2012.|$|E
