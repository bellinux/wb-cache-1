5|$|Due to {{the flat}} {{topography}} of Essex County, the land use surrounding Highway77 is almost entirely agricultural. Soil conditions in Essex <b>are</b> <b>ideal</b> for farming, {{and as a result}} very few natural areas {{can be found in the}} county. Many streams have been diverted to irrigate the endless farmland to either side of the highway. Relief from the plain is provided only by the few hamlets along the route. In addition, Lake Erie and Lake St Clair are both a short distance from Highway 77.|$|E
5|$|In the {{northern}} areas, the species {{can be found}} in Alaska, Iceland, northern Scandinavia, Greenland and Russia. These are not only particular, specialised species; according to an overview study, more than 150 species were found in the arctic and subarctic regions of Iceland, Greenland, northern Russia and Alaska. These distinctly exceed the tree line. In Greenland, the habitat may reach the 77th latitude line. The Myxogastria species reach their largest biodiversity and highest frequency in forests of temperate regions, which <b>are</b> <b>ideal</b> habitats because of the amount of rich organic material, suitable humidity (not too high) and long-lasting snow cover for snow-inhabiting species.|$|E
5|$|The Dorset is {{an ancient}} breed that was most likely {{developed}} from horned sheep that lived in the valleys and pastures of southwestern England. Dorset Horn sheep were imported into the United States in 1860, and the first U.S. national flock book was formed in 1891. Today, the Dorset is found in two varieties globally, Horned and Polled. In the Horn variety, both ewes and rams have horns, while the polled variety have no horns at all. Polled Dorsets <b>are</b> <b>ideal</b> for commercial settings {{because they do not}} have horns that can get caught in fencing or cause damage when they butt.|$|E

5|$|The Swiss {{climate is}} {{generally}} temperate, but can vary greatly between the localities, from glacial {{conditions on the}} mountaintops to the often pleasant near Mediterranean climate at Switzerland's southern tip. There are some valley areas {{in the southern part}} of Switzerland where some cold-hardy palm trees are found. Summers tend to be warm and humid at times with periodic rainfall so they <b>are</b> <b>ideal</b> for pastures and grazing. The less humid winters in the mountains may see long intervals of stable conditions for weeks, while the lower lands tend to suffer from inversion, during these periods, thus seeing no sun for weeks.|$|E
5|$|NuScale is {{expected}} to be the first SMR to market, because its cooling is similar to the systems used in conventional power plants. However, alternative cooling systems using molten metals are expected to operate at higher, more efficient temperatures once approved. The company estimates a twelve-unit NuScale plant would cost $5,000 per kilowatt. In comparison, the Energy Information Administration in 2011 estimated costs to be $4,700 per kilowatt for conventional nuclear power, $4,600 for a carbon sequestration coal plant and $931 at a gas-fired plant or in excess of $1,800 for a gas-fired plant with carbon sequestration. David Mohre, executive director of NRECA's Energy and Power Division, said SMR's like NuScale's <b>are</b> <b>ideal</b> for rural towns that need small power plants and do not have access to natural gas. NuScale power plants are also expected to take less time, materials and space to construct than other power sources and can be expanded incrementally to meet changing power needs.|$|E

Once established, these trees spread by suckering, thus creating a new aspen groves.|$|E
