40|$|To {{describe}} how inflammation on MRI of the sacroiliac joints {{in patients with}} recent-onset inflammatory back pain (IBP) evolves over time, and to study determinants of activity on MRI of the sacroiliac joint. A 2 -year follow-up study with annual MRI of the sacroiliac joints was conducted in patients with IBP of less than 2 years' duration. Images were scored for bone marrow oedema on short τ inversion recovery and enhancement after administration of gadolinium on T 1. Of the 68 patients (38 % male; mean age 34. 9 ± 10. 3 years) enrolled, 44 had <b>a</b> negative baseline <b>MRI.</b> Of these 44 patients, 39 patients {{had at least one}} follow-up MRI of whom six patients (15 %) developed activity on MRI during follow-up. 24 patients (35 %) had <b>an</b> abnormal <b>MRI</b> at baseline. In 23 of these 24 patients follow-up MRI was available. The MRI became negative in seven of these 23 patients (30 %) during follow-up. Human leucocyte antigen B 27 (HLA-B 27) positivity and male gender determined independently the likelihood of <b>a</b> positive <b>MRI</b> at any time point. In an HLA-B 27 -positive patient the likelihood of <b>a</b> positive <b>MRI</b> during follow-up is 88 % if the baseline MRI is positive and 27 % if the baseline MRI is negative.

5|$|After a May 23 neck surgery, Manning {{could not}} use the Colts' {{facilities}} for practice and workouts due to the NFL lockout. Reluctant to have witnesses to his recovery, he used the Colorado Rockies baseball team's trainers at Coors Field in Denver. Manning was unable to complete his throwing motion, and his arm strength had significantly diminished. Based on <b>an</b> <b>MRI,</b> doctors told him {{in the late summer}} that he needed spinal fusion surgery and that at his age they could not guarantee his return to the NFL. On September 7, the Colts officially ruled Manning out for the season opener against Houston, ending his consecutive starts streak of 208 games (227 including playoffs); the team signed Kerry Collins out of retirement and named him interim starting quarterback. After seeking other opinions, Manning had the second surgery on September 8.|$|E

5|$|Children who {{discontinue}} {{the diet}} after achieving seizure freedom {{have about a}} 20% risk of seizures returning. The length of time until recurrence is highly variable but averages two years. This risk of recurrence compares with 10% for resective surgery (where {{part of the brain}} is removed) and 30–50% for anticonvulsant therapy. Of those that have a recurrence, just over half can regain freedom from seizures either with anticonvulsants or by returning to the ketogenic diet. Recurrence is more likely if, despite seizure freedom, an electroencephalogram (EEG) shows epileptiform spikes, which indicate epileptic activity in the brain but are below the level that will cause a seizure. Recurrence is also likely if <b>an</b> <b>MRI</b> scan shows focal abnormalities (for example, as in children with tuberous sclerosis). Such children may remain on the diet longer than average, and {{it has been suggested that}} children with tuberous sclerosis who achieve seizure freedom could remain on the ketogenic diet indefinitely.|$|E
5|$|Fernández {{started his}} sophomore {{campaign}} as the Opening Day starter for the Marlins, {{making him the}} youngest Opening Day starting pitcher since Dwight Gooden in 1986. Fernández recorded nine strikeouts while walking none, and he joined Bob Gibson, Steve Carlton, Ferguson Jenkins, Walter Johnson, and Cy Young as the only pitchers to do so on Opening Day. On May 12, Fernández {{was placed on the}} 15-day disabled list due to a right elbow sprain. <b>An</b> <b>MRI</b> revealed that the elbow had a torn ulnar collateral ligament, which prematurely ended Fernández's 2014 season.

However, after being assessed by Canucks team doctors, his broken toe was judged to {{have not yet fully}} healed and he was not cleared for AHL assignment. Hodgson additionally believed that he had re-injured his back while colliding head-first into the boards during Game 7 of the opening playoff round. He underwent <b>an</b> <b>MRI</b> in the off-season, which uncovered the misdiagnosed bulging disc to be a muscle strain instead.

Afterward, Beckett told the team that he had experienced renewed discomfort in his injured hip. <b>An</b> <b>MRI</b> revealed that his hip impingement had resulted in a torn labrum and two cysts, possibly requiring season ending surgery. He was placed back on the 15-day disabled list on August 8. On September 3, 2014, Dodgers manager Don Mattingly told reporters that Beckett's season was likely over due to his injury. A couple of days later, Beckett confirmed that he would not pitch again in 2014 and added that he was also considering retirement. Beckett officially announced his retirement on October 7, 2014.|$|E

Leading up to this announcement, he had reflected upon his previous neck injury and cervical vertebral fusion, and felt numbness in his arms. This was diagnosed as cervical spinal stenosis, and doctors would not clear him to compete, for risk of neck-down paralysis or even death should he take a hard enough fall. Later that same week on the April 15 episode of SmackDown, Edge officially relinquished the World Heavyweight Championship, retiring as the World Champion {{in the process of}} recapping his announcement and expressing gratitude over this happening now rather than it being too late.|$|E

5|$|There is no {{requirement}} that other comorbid conditions (such as ADHD or OCD) be present, {{but if a}} physician believes {{that there may be}} another condition present that could explain tics, tests may be ordered as necessary to rule out that condition. An example of this is when diagnostic confusion between tics and seizure activity exists, which would call for an EEG, or if there are symptoms that indicate <b>an</b> <b>MRI</b> to rule out brain abnormalities. TSH levels can be measured to rule out hypothyroidism, which can be a cause of tics. Brain imaging studies are not usually warranted. In teenagers and adults presenting with a sudden onset of tics and other behavioral symptoms, a urine drug screen for cocaine and stimulants might be necessary. If a family history of liver disease is present, serum copper and ceruloplasmin levels can rule out Wilson's disease. Most cases are diagnosed by merely observing a history of tics.|$|E
