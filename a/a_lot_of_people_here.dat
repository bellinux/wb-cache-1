A June headlining {{tour of the}} UK and Ireland was also confirmed, and almost immediately after the announcement, some venues sold out.

2500|$|The two rulers {{concluded}} a treaty of alliance, by which John de la Roche's brother and heir, William, would marry John Doukas's daughter Helena and receive the fortresses of Gravia, Siderokastron, Gardiki, and Zetouni as her dowry. In return, de la Roche gave Doukas 300 or 500 horsemen (depending on the source) {{with whom he}} returned quickly to Neopatras. The Byzantine force there had been considerably weakened, with several detachments sent off to capture other forts or plunder the region, and was furthermore unwieldy and not very cohesive, given the many races that served in it. According to the Venetian historian Marino Sanudo, when John Doukas and John de la Roche climbed a height and saw the huge Byzantine encampment, de la Roche uttered, in Greek, a phrase from Herodotus: [...] "there are <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>here,</b> but few men." [...] Indeed, the Byzantine troops panicked under the sudden attack of the smaller but disciplined Latin force, and broke completely when a Cuman contingent abruptly switched sides. Despite John Palaiologos's attempts to rally his forces, they fled and scattered.|$|E

Then an old lady whom I detest tried to make me talk before everybody, and all I could do was to turn as red as a beet and stammer: [...] "Yes, ma'am," [...] "no, ma'am." [...] It made Mother furious, because it is so old-fashioned to say [...] "ma'am." [...] Our old nurse taught me to say it when I was small, and though it has been pretty well governessed out of me since then, it's sure to pop up when I get confused and nervous.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Howells--that poem of his is admirable; that's the way {{to treat}} a person. Howells has a {{peculiar}} gift for seeing the merits of people, and he has always exhibited them in my favor. Howells has never written anything about me that I couldn't read six or seven times a day; he is always just and always fair; he has written more appreciatively of me than any one in this world, and published it in the North American Review. He did me the justice {{to say that my}} intentions--he italicized that--that my intentions were always good, that I wounded people's conventions rather than their convictions. Now, I wouldn't want anything handsomer than that said of me. I would rather wait, with anything harsh I might have to say, till the convictions become conventions. Bangs has traced me all the way down. He can't find that honest man, but I will look for him in the looking-glass when I get home. It was intimated by the Colonel that it is New England that makes New York and builds up this country and makes it great, overlooking the fact that there's <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>here</b> who came from elsewhere, like John Hay from away out West, and Howells from Ohio, and St. Clair McKelway and me from Missouri, and we are doing what we can to build up New York a little-elevate it. Why, when I was living in that village of Hannibal, Missouri, {{on the banks of the}} Mississippi, and Hay up in the town of Warsaw, also on the banks of the Mississippi River it is an emotional bit of the Mississippi, and when it is low water you have to climb up to it on a ladder, and when it floods you have to hunt for it; with a deep-sea lead--but it is a great and beautiful country. In that old time it was a paradise for simplicity--it was a simple, simple life, cheap but comfortable, and full of sweetness, and there was nothing of this rage of modern civilization there at all. It was a delectable land. I went out there last June, and I met in that town of Hannibal a schoolmate of mine, John Briggs, whom I had not seen for more than fifty years. I tell you, that was a meeting! That pal whom I had known as a little boy long ago, and knew now as a stately man three or four inches over six feet and browned by exposure to many climes, he was back there to see that old place again. We spent a whole afternoon going about here and there and yonder, and hunting up the scenes and talking of the crimes which we had committed so long ago. It was a heartbreaking delight, full of pathos, laughter, and tears, all mixed together; and we called the roll of the boys and girls that we picnicked and sweethearted with so many years ago, and there were hardly half a dozen of them left; the rest were in their graves; and we went up there on the summit of that hill, a treasured place in my memory, the summit of Holiday's Hill, and looked out again over that magnificent panorama of the Mississippi River, sweeping along league after league, a level green paradise on one side, and retreating capes and promontories as far as you could see on the other, fading away in the soft, rich lights of the remote distance. I recognized then that I was seeing now the most enchanting river view the planet could furnish. I never knew it when I was a boy; it took an educated eye that had travelled over the globe to know and appreciate it; and John said, [...] "Can you point out the place where Bear Creek used to be before the railroad came?" [...] I said, [...] "Yes, it ran along yonder." [...] "And can you point out the swimming-hole?" [...] "Yes, out there." [...] And he said, [...] "Can you point out the place where we stole the skiff?" [...] Well, I didn't know which one he meant. Such a wilderness of events had intervened since that day, more than fifty years ago, it took me more than five minutes to call back that little incident, and then I did call it back; it was a white skiff, and we painted it red to allay suspicion. And the saddest, saddest man came along--a stranger he was--and he looked that red skiff over so pathetically, and he said: [...] "Well, if it weren't for the complexion I'd know whose skiff that was." [...] He said it in that pleading way, you know, that appeals for sympathy and suggestion; we were full of sympathy for him, but we weren't in any condition to offer suggestions. I can see him yet as he turned away with that same sad look on his face and vanished out of history forever. I wonder what became of that man. I know what became of the skiff. Well, it was a beautiful life, a lovely life. There was no crime. Merely little things like pillaging orchards and watermelon-patches and breaking the Sabbath--we didn't break the Sabbath often enough to signify--once a week perhaps. But we were good boys, good Presbyterian boys, all Presbyterian boys, and loyal and all that; anyway, we were good Presbyterian boys when the weather was doubtful; when it was fair, we did wander a little from the fold.|$|E

5000|$|Political street art was {{not common}} in Egypt {{prior to the}} 2011 revolution, however it has proliferated in public spaces in the post-revolution era. Artwork {{targeting}} the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, or SCAF, in particular has surged in popularity since the revolution because, according to The Christian Science Monitor, such [...] "anti-military graffiti {{is a reflection of}} Egyptian activists’ frustration with the military rulers, who they say replaced one autocracy with another." [...] Keizer has noted that, although much of his work is political in nature, much of it is also ambiguous or apolitical.

[...] Keizer has been described as an Arab nationalist, and much of his artwork targets capitalism and imperialism.

40|$|The Gilbert damping {{constant}} {{is an important}} phenomenological parameter for the description of magnetization dynamics of ferromagnets, as it characterizes the damping of magnetization precession. Recently, {{there has been a}} great deal of theoretical and experimental interest in current-induced magnetization dynamics and, in particular, current-driven domain wall motion that occurs via so-called spin transfer torques. Gilbert damping plays an important role in these phenomena. From a microscopic Hamiltonian which includes magnetic impurities we obtain the spin-density response function. Using this result, as well as the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation, we get a microscopic expression for αG. In the process of doing this we introduce the concept of disorder averaging, averaging over different configurations of impurities, and examine the linear response of a ferromagnet to small perturbations in electric and magnetic fields. ii Acknowledgements I would first like to thank my supervisor Dr. Rembert Duine. I was sceptical at first of working in the low energy field but you suggested a topic that was interesting and challenging. I really learnt a lot and enjoyed my time on this thesis and am looking forward to carrying on with you as a PhD student. To my parents, thank you. Your total support and encouragement were more than I could have ever asked for. There was also a little nagging and a lot of patience involved which I appreciate. <b>A</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>here</b> in the Netherlands and abroad have helped me along the way and I would mention you all but the list is a bit too long. I need to mention a couple of people though. To my friend Arnaud, you were always willing to give me a helping hand and sometimes it helped me more than you know so thank you. Liesbeth, I don’t think I can ever thank you enough for being there for me, I know I would never have made it this far without your support.
