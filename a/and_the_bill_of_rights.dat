In 1763, Member of Parliament John Wilkes was arrested for writing an inflammatory pamphlet, No. 45, 23 April 1763; he cited Magna Carta continually. Lord Camden denounced the treatment of Wilkes as a contravention of Magna Carta.

The victory for the Elaine defendants gave the NAACP greater credibility as the champion of African Americans' rights. Walter F.

25|$|Federalists and anti-federalists jostled {{for power}} {{in the early years}} as {{political}} parties became pronounced, surprising the Constitution's Founding Fathers of the United States. With the passage of the Constitution <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>Rights,</b> the Anti-Federalist movement was exhausted. Some activists joined the Anti-Administration Party that James Madison and Thomas Jefferson were forming about 1790–91 to oppose policies of Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton; it soon became the Democratic-Republican Party or the Jeffersonian Democrat Party and began the era of the First Party System. Thomas Jefferson's election to the presidency marked a peaceful transition of power between the parties in 1800. John Marshall, 4th Chief Justice of the Supreme Court empowered the courts by establishing the principle of judicial review in law in the landmark case Marbury v. Madison in 1803, effectively giving the Supreme Court a power to nullify congressional legislation.|$|E
25|$|Sinha and Richards both {{argue that}} the south only used states' rights when they {{disagreed}} with a policy. Examples given are a states' right to engage in slavery or to suppress freedom of speech. They argue that it was instead {{the result of the}} increasing cognitive dissonance in the minds of Northerners and (some) Southern non-slaveowners between the ideals that the United States was founded upon and identified itself as standing for, as expressed in the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution of the United States, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>Rights,</b> and the reality that the slave-power represented, as what they describe as an anti-democratic, counter-republican, oligarchic, despotic, authoritarian, if not totalitarian, movement for ownership of human beings as the personal chattels of the slaver. As this cognitive dissonance increased, the people of the Northern states, and the Northern states themselves, became increasingly inclined to resist the encroachments of the slave power upon their states' rights and encroachments of the slave power by and upon the federal government of the United States. The slave power, having failed to maintain its dominance of the federal government through democratic means, sought other means of maintaining its dominance of the federal government, by means of military aggression, by right of force and coercion, and thus, the Civil War occurred.|$|E
500|$|According to the Whig {{interpretation}} of history, the Glorious Revolution {{was an example}} of the reclaiming of ancient liberties. Reinforced with Lockean concepts, the Whigs believed England's constitution to be a social contract, based on documents such as Magna Carta, the Petition of Right, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>Rights.</b> [...] The English Liberties (1680, in later versions often British Liberties) by the Whig propagandist Henry Care (d. 1688) was a cheap polemical book that was influential and much-reprinted, in the American colonies as well as Britain, and made Magna Carta central to the history and the contemporary legitimacy of its subject.|$|E
50|$|In England and Wales, logbook {{loans are}} {{regulated}} by <b>the</b> <b>Bills</b> <b>of</b> Sale Act 1878 and <b>Bills</b> <b>of</b> Sale Act (1878) Amendment Act 1882. Logbook loans <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bills</b> <b>of</b> Sale Acts {{have been subject}} to much criticism. In 2009, a consultation by the Department for Business, Innovation <b>and</b> Skills examined <b>the</b> <b>Bills</b> <b>of</b> Sale Acts <b>and</b> proposed that <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> sale for consumer lending, such as logbook loans, should be banned. The government's response to the consultation was published in 2011.

500|$|Virginians were {{instrumental}} in writing the United States Constitution. James Madison drafted the Virginia Plan in 1787 <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>Rights</b> in 1789. Virginia ratified the Constitution on June 25, 1788. The three-fifths compromise ensured that Virginia, with its large number of slaves, initially had the largest bloc in the House of Representatives. Together with the Virginia dynasty of presidents, this gave the Commonwealth national importance. In 1790, both Virginia and Maryland ceded territory to form the new District of Columbia, though the Virginian area was retroceded in 1846. Virginia is called [...] "Mother of States" [...] because of its role in being carved into states like Kentucky, which became the 15th state in 1792, and for the numbers of American pioneers born in Virginia.|$|E
500|$|When {{interest}} in the Declaration was revived, the sections that were most important in 1776 were no longer relevant: {{the announcement of the}} independence of the United States and the grievances against King George. But the second paragraph was applicable long after the war had ended, with its talk of self-evident truths and unalienable rights. The Constitution <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>Rights</b> lacked sweeping statements about rights and equality, and advocates of groups with grievances turned to the Declaration for support. Starting in the 1820s, variations of the Declaration were issued to proclaim the rights of workers, farmers, women, and others. In 1848, for example, the Seneca Falls Convention of women's rights advocates declared that [...] "all men and women are created equal".|$|E
5000|$|Chattel {{mortgages}} in England and Wales {{are seen}} as a form of security interest (or [...] "collateral") for lenders in certain financing scenarios.
