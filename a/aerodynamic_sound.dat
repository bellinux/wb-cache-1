The motion blur is artificially added to visualize the motion of the swords. In computer graphics, most research focuses on creating images. However, there has been much recent work on the automatic generation of sound linked to objects in motion and the relative positions of receivers and sound sources. This paper proposes a new method for creating one type of sound called <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>sound.</b> Examples of <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>sound</b> include sound generated by swinging swords or by wind blowing. A major source of <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>sound</b> is vortices generated in fluids such as air.

40|$|A diverse {{array of}} birds {{apparently}} make mechanical sounds (called sonations) with their feathers. Few studies have established that these sounds are non-vocal, and the mechanics of how these sounds are produced remains poorly studied. The loud, high-frequency chirp emitted by a male Anna's hummingbird (Calypte anna) during his display dive is a debated example. Production of the sound was originally attributed to the tail, but a more recent study argued that the sound is vocal. Here, we use high-speed video of diving birds, experimental manipulations on wild birds and laboratory experiments on individual feathers {{to show that the}} dive sound is made by tail feathers. High-speed video shows that fluttering of the trailing vane of the outermost tail feathers produces the sound. The mechanism is not a whistle, and we propose a flag model to explain the feather's fluttering and accompanying sound. The flag hypothesis predicts that subtle changes in feather shape will tune the frequency of sound produced by feathers. Many kinds of birds are reported to create <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>sounds</b> with their wings or tail, and this model may explain a wide diversity of non-vocal sounds produced by birds...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} not {{intended}} to give an overview of defect correction methods but to use the basic concept of a defect correction in conjunction with fluctuations in flow field variables for sound and noise retrieval. Recall that sound waves - manifested as pressure fluctuations - are typically several orders of magnitude smaller than the pressure variations in the flow field that account for flow acceleration. Furthermore, they propagate at the speed of sound in the medium, not as a transported fluid quantity. A decomposition of variables was first introduced in [DLP 97] and has been further examined in [Dja 98] to include three types of components. These components include (1) the mean flow, (2) flow perturbations or <b>aerodynamic</b> sources of <b>sound,</b> and (3) the acoustic perturbation. We have demonstrated the accurate computation of (1) and (2) in [DLP 98]. Mathematically, the flow variable U may be written as u + u where u denotes the mean flow and part of <b>aerodynamic</b> sources of <b>sound</b> and u denotes the remaining part of the <b>aerodynamic</b> sources of <b>sound</b> and the acoustic perturbation. While flow perturbation or <b>aerodynamic</b> sources of <b>sound</b> may be easier to recover, it is not true for the acoustic perturbation because of its comparatively small magnitude. In fact, the solutions of the Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes equations reveal only a truncated part of the full physical quantities. This paper follows the basic principle of the defect correction as discussed above and applies the concept to the recovery of the propagating acoustic perturbation. The method relies on the use of a lower order partial di#erential equation defined on the same computational domai...|$|R

40|$|The {{acoustic}} prediction methodology discussed herein applies {{an acoustic}} analogy {{to calculate the}} sound generated by sources in an <b>aerodynamic</b> simulation. <b>Sound</b> is propagated from the computed flow field by integrating the Ffowcs Williams and Hawkings equation on a suitable control surface.

VH is a condition characterized by excessive laryngeal and paralaryngeal tension, and {{is assumed to be}} the underlying cause of the majority of voice disorders. Current clinical assessment of VH is subjective and demonstrates poor inter-rater reliability. Recent work indicates that a new acoustic measure, relative fundamental frequency (RFF) is sensitive to the maladaptive functional behaviors associated with VH and can potentially be used to objectively characterize VH. 	Here, we explored and enhanced the potential for RFF as a measure of VH in three ways.

Second, RFF was compared with the current state-of-the-art measures of VH – listener perception of vocal effort and the <b>aerodynamic</b> ratio of <b>sound</b> pressure level to subglottal pressure level. Third, an automated algorithm that utilized the optimized recording protocol was developed and validated against manual estimation methods and listener perception.

40|$|The idea of Defect Correction Method (DCM) {{has been}} around for a long time. It can be used in a number of {{different}} ways and can be applied to solve various linear and non-linear problems. Most defect correction related methods were used in conjunction with discretisation methods and two-level multigrid methods. This thesis examines how various iterative methods, both for linear and nonlinear problems, may be built into a unified framework through the use of defect correction. The framework is extended to the area of Computational Aeroacoustics (CAA) where sound waves generated by the pressure fluctuations are typically several orders of magnitude smaller than the pressure variations in the main flow field that accounts for flow acceleration. A decomposition of variables is used to break down the components of a typical flow variable into (1) the mean flow, (2) flow perturbations or <b>aerodynamic</b> sources of <b>sound,</b> and (3) the acoustic perturbation. The framework as discussed in this thesis would incorporate such variable decomposition. The basic principle of DCM can be applied to recover the propagating acoustic perturbation through a coupling technique. This provides an excellent concept in the re-use of existing commercial CFD software based on the framework and in the retrieval of acoustic pressure. Numerical examples demonstrating the defect correction framework for a typical car sun-roof problem was examined with promising numerical results. To this end the complete process of coupling Reynolds average Navier-Stokes and the Helmholtz equation is also presented using the DCM framework. The DCM framework is also extended to handle higher order numerical methods for the numerical solutions of partial differential equations leading to an easy re-use of existing software approximating derivatives with a lower order discretisation. Numerical experiments were performed to demonstrate the capability of the DCM framework. It is also used to a simplified 2 -D problems aiming at the understanding of Large Eddy Simulation (LES) and filtering techniques. To this end the framework of DCM leads to an efficient and robust software implementation for many CFD and aeroacoustic computation in a simple nutshell...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} and analyze {{a new technique}} for sonification of three-dimensional vector fields. This technique allows the user to use commodity hardware and widely available 3 D sound interfaces to map vectors in a listener’s local neighborhood into smooth wind-like sound (<b>aerodynamic</b> <b>sound).</b> The four types of information provided by this technique are flow direction, flow velocity, flow vorticity and local flow patterns. The result {{is a system that}} helps the user achieve an intuitive understanding of the data set by using their auditory sense. ...|$|E

In the present paper, the {{attention is focused on}} the effect of local porous material on <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>sound</b> radiated from two-dimensional airfoil. We measured the <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>sound</b> radiated from the airfoil with porous material, tripping wire and porous plate which are mounted locally {{on the surface of the}} airfoils near the leading edge. At the normal air-foil, discrete frequency noise is clearly observed at small attack angle. However, it is clear that its noise generated from the airfoil decreased with the local porous material on the surface of pressure side of the airfoil. The porous material is effective to reduce this noise compared with the others. And the sound absorbing coefficient and the air permeability were measured for test porous material. The sound absorbing coefficient increased at the high frequency band, and the air permeability became small for porous materials. As the attack angle increased, the discrete frequency noise was not generated from the normal airfoil. The broadband noises were almost same for all test airfoils...|$|E
