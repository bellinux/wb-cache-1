40|$|Background: Acetolactate synthase (ALS) -inhibiting {{herbicides}} <b>amidosulfuron</b> (Hoestar) is {{an efficient}} gametocide that can induce male sterility in rapeseed (Brassica napus L.). We conducted an integrated study of cytological, transcriptomic, and physiological analysis {{to decipher the}} gametocidal effect of <b>amidosulfuron.</b> Results: In the first several days after exposure to <b>amidosulfuron</b> at a gametocidal dose of ca. 1 μg per plant, the plants showed the earliest symptoms including short retard of raceme elongation, slight chlorosis on leaf, and decrease of photosynthesis rate. Chloroplasts in leaf and anther epidermis, and tapetal plastids were deformed. Both tapetal cell and uni-nucleate microspore showed autophagic vacuoles and degenerated quickly. The <b>amidosulfuron</b> treatment caused reduction of photosynthetic rate and the contents of leaf chlorophyll, soluble sugar and pyruvate, as well as content alteration of several free amino acids in the treated plants. A comparison of transcriptomic profiling data of the young flower buds of the treated plants with the control identified 142 up-regulated and 201 down-regulated differential expression transcripts with functional annotations. Down-regulation of several interesting genes encoding PAIR 1, SDS, PPD 2, HFM 1, CSTF 77, A 6, ALA 6, UGE 1, FLA 20, A 9, bHLH 91, and putative cell wall protein LOC 106368794, and up-regulation of autophagy-related protein ATG 8 A indicated functional abnormalities about cell cycle, cell wall formation, chloroplast structure, and tissue autophagy. Ethylene-responsive transcription factor RAP 2 - 11 -like was up-regulated in the flower buds and ethylene release rate was also elevated. The transcriptional regulation in the amidosulfuron-treated plants was {{in line with the}} cytological and physiological changes. Conclusions: The results suggested that metabolic decrease related to photosynthesis and energy supply are associated with male sterility induced by <b>amidosulfuron.</b> The results provide insights into the molecular mechanisms of gametocide-induced male sterility and expand the knowledge on the transcriptomic complexity of the plants exposure to sulfonylurea herbicide...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} the evaluation of spray volume and nozzle type effect on different formulation (water dispersible granules - WG and oil dispersion - OD) of two sulfonylurea herbicides: the mixture iodosulfuron methyl sodium + <b>amidosulfuron</b> and iodosulfuron methyl sodium + mesosulfuron methyl efficacy. There were investigated three levels of spray volume (125 l*ha- 1, 250 l*ha- 1 and 350 l*ha- 1) and two types of nozzle (extended range flat nozzle TeeJet XR 11003 -VS and drift guard flat nozzle TeeJet DG 11003 -VS). Each herbicide was used at recommended dose and reduced by half. Spray volume and nozzle type did not affect activity of the mixture iodosulfuron methyl sodium + <b>amidosulfuron,</b> but differentiated the efficacy of OD formulation of iodosulfuron methyl sodium + mesosulfuron methyl, when it was applied at lowered dose. As spray volume rose, herbicide efficacy decreased. Nozzle type influenced OD formulation of the mixture iodosulfuron methyl sodium + mesosulfuron methyl, independently on dose.

40|$|Three-year {{trials were}} {{conducted}} to study germination and emergence of prickly lettuce (Lactuca serriola L.) achenes, increments of shoot dry matter and susceptibility of the weed to selected herbicides. The germination rates of achenes at 10 °C (92 %), 20 °C (97 %) and 30 °C (95 %) did not indicate any significant differences within 20 days from sowing. The highest percentage emergence of prickly lettuce achenes was determined after their sowing into a depth of 1 mm. Differ-ences from the variants of sowing onto the soil surface (0 mm), into a depth of 10 and 20 mm were significant. There were no differences in the emergence rates from a depth of 10 and 20 mm. The highest increments of shoot dry matter were observed when prickly lettuce plants were grown for 4 – 7 weeks after sowing at 20 °C. The effect of selected herbi-cides on prickly lettuce plants treated at the stage of 2 – 3 true leaves was evaluated {{on the basis of}} a change in the content of shoot dry matter. A significant decrease in dry matter against the control was recorded in all variants after herbicide application. The effect (expressed by a lower dry matter content) was significantly higher after the combination ami-dosulfuron + iodosulfuron-methyl + mefenpyr-diethyl (10 + 2. 5 + 25 g/ha) was used than after the application of tribe-nuron (10. 85 g/ha) and picolinafen + cyanazine (120 g + 480 h).

40|$|Yield {{losses in}} cereal crops under {{temperate}} climate conditions due to weed-crop competition, namely Lolium rigidum G., can reach up to 80 %, {{depending on the}} season and infestation level. Nevertheless, the costs of chemical weed control and the environmental impact caused by herbicides recommend the search for strategies to reduce their input. Therefore, the aim of this work was to study the possibility of reducing the input of different post-emergence herbicides (diclofop-methyl + fenoxaprop–p-ethyl and <b>amidosulfuron</b> + iodosulfuron-methyl-sodium) to control Lolium rigidum G. and broad-leaf weeds in barley under no-till, and to monitor the effect on weed population levels and crop yields. A field experiment was carried out in 2007 - 2008 and 2008 - 2009, in an experimental farm in the south of Portugal, combining different herbicide doses applied at different weed development stages. Results show that, for all herbicide doses, the earlier application provides higher weed control efficacy and higher grain yields, indicating that the reduction of doses is possible while maintaining satisfactory crop grain yields...|$|E
40|$|We {{report on}} the {{development}} and validation under ISO 17025 criteria of a multi-residue confirmatory method to identify and quantify 17 widely chemically different pesticides (insecticides: Carbofuran, Methiocarb, Pirimicarb, Dimethoate, Fipronil, Imidacloprid; herbicides: <b>Amidosulfuron,</b> Rimsulfuron, Atrazine, Simazine, Chloroturon, Linuron, Isoxaflutole, Metosulam; fungicides: Diethofencarb) and 2 metabolites (Methiocarb sulfoxide and 2 -Hydroxytertbutylazine) in honey. This method {{is based on an}} on-column liquid liquid extraction (OCLLE) using diatomaceous earth as inert solid support and liquid chromatography (LC) coupled to mass spectrometry (MS) operating in tandem mode (MS/MS). Method specificity is ensured by checking retention time and theoretical ratio between two transitions from a single precursor ion. Linearity is demonstrated all along the range of concentration that was investigated, from 0. 1 to 20 ng g(- 1) raw honey, with correlation coefficients ranging from 0. 921 to 0. 999, depending on chemicals. Recovery rates obtained on home-made quality control samples are between 71 and 90 %, well above the range defined by the EC/ 657 / 2002 document, but in the range we had fixed to ensure proper quantification, as levels found in real samples could not be corrected for recovery rates. Reproducibility is found to be between 8 and 27 %. Calculated CC alpha and CC beta (0. 0002 - 0. 943 mg g(- 1) for CC alpha, and 0. 0002 - 1. 232 ng g(- 1) for CCP) show the good sensitivity attained by this rnulti-residue analytical method. The robustness of the method has been tested in analyzing more than 100 raw honey samples collected from different areas in Belgium, as well as some wax and bee samples, with a slightly adapted procedure.

The procedure combines a solid-phase extraction (SPE) with column liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry detection utilizing a pneumatically assisted and heat-assisted electrospray interface in negative mode. The extraction of analytes from filtered drainage or river water samples was performed using as sorbent a graphitized carbon. The recovery, for drinking water, ranged from 91 to 98 %, and from 84 to 95 % for river water. Excellent method precision was demonstrated with percent {{relative standard deviation}} of less than 10 % for all analytes at fortification level. Detection limits were at level of few nanograms per liter, except for 2, 4 -dichlorophenol and 4 -chloro- 2 -methylphenol, {{that was in the}} range of tens of nanogram per liter. The present methodology was used for searching in river and drainage waters of maize-grain fields of the Tiber valley, during a typical period of herbicides application from April to July 2001. The levels detected of four compounds were in the range of: non-detectable (ND) - 6. 1, ND- 27, ND- 1. 9 and ND- 0. 5 mug l(- 1), for MCPA, bentazone, 8 -hydroxybentazone and 2, 4 -D, respectively. Detectable amounts of bentazone- 8 -hydroxy at level of 0, 3 mug l(- 1) was found to be transported into river. The highly satisfactory results for all target analytes demonstrate the potential of liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry for the identification and the quantification of the polar and acidic herbicides at below 100 ng l(- 1) levels.

40|$|The term ‘emerging contaminants’ is {{generally}} {{used to refer}} to compounds previously not considered or known to be significant to groundwater (in terms of distribution and/or concentration) which are now being more widely detected. As analytical techniques improve, previously undetected organic micropollutants are being observed in the aqueous environment. Many emerging contaminants remain unregulated, but the number of regulated contaminants will continue to grow slowly over the next several decades. There is a wide variety of sources and pathways for these compounds to enter the environment and these include agriculture and urban areas. Some of these contaminants can have human or ecological health effects and {{there is a need for}} better understanding of their fate in environmental systems. This report provides a short review of the types of organic micropollutants which can be found in the aqueous environment. These include nanomaterials, pesticides, pharmaceuticals, industrial additives and by-products, personal care products and fragrances, water treatment by-products, flame/fire retardants and surfactants, as well as caffeine and nicotine metabolites and hormones. Many of the compounds are relatively small polar molecules which are not effectively removed by conventional drinking water treatment using activated carbon. Pesticides and some industrial compounds are presently covered by the Water Framework Directive, the Groundwater Regulations and the Drinking Water Directive. Additional parameters, such as bisphenol A and nonyl-phenol are anticipated to be covered by revisions to the Drinking Water Directive. Others are currently unregulated. In order to assess the hazards presented by such compounds, information on usage, persistence, leachability and a robust sensitive analytical method is required. The UK metaldehyde problem was not originally discovered due to lack of an analytical method and was exacerbated by recalcitrance in water treatment. For many pesticides these requirements are fulfilled and an assessment of risk of leaching to groundwater can be made. However, for pesticide metabolites this information can be sparse and for compounds such as pharmaceuticals it can be lacking. A simple hazard assessment for currently approved pesticides was made from information on UK usage, persistence, sorption to soil carbon and published leaching indices. The following compounds were assessed as having the greatest potential for leaching to water: 2, 4 -D, <b>amidosulfuron,</b> bentazone, clopyralid, dicamba, florasulam, fosthiazate, imazaquin, iodosulfuron-methyl-sodium, maleic hydrazide, MCPA, MCPP-P, metribuzin, metsulfuronmethyl, quinmerac, oxamyl, and triclopyr with a further 46 also having potential. Of these, 19 had an octanol/water partition coefficient (Kow) less than that of metaldehyde and therefore are likely to be incompletely removed by water treatment. A simple assessment for pesticide metabolites, based only on organic carbon/water partition coefficient (Koc) and persistence data, in this study gave results which agreed in principle with other studies. The different approaches indicate that the metabolites of chlorothalonil, cyanazine, diflufenican, flufenacet, iodosulfuron-methyl, metaldehyde, metazachlor and metsulfuron-methyl are likely to pose the greatest risk to drinking water. In many cases these metabolites are derived from parents which have a lesser risk. Other organic micropollutants, such as pharmaceuticals, cannot as yet be assessed in the same way due to a lack of persistence data since the majority of persistence studies have been directed at water treatment. A range of organic micropollutants from urban settings have been detected in ground and surface water. Commonly detected compounds include: bisphenol A, carbamazepine, galaxolide, ibuprofen, iopamidol, phthalates, phenyl ethoxylates, and sulfamethoxazole. Case studies show that a small number of contaminants may be used to characterise the contaminant loading and also be used to assess the migration pathways in urban areas. Data interpreted by BGS from the Environment Agency’s monitoring programme for organic pollutants indicates that the 30 most frequently detected compounds comprise both established and emerging compounds and include a number of polyaromatic hydrocarbons, petroleum compounds, triazine herbicides, chlorinated solvents, degradation products and THMs, caffeine, DEET and industrial compounds such as bisphenol A and tributyl phosphate. Specific determinands include a range of currently licensed and phased out pesticides with a few metabolites, pharmaceuticals including carbamazepine and triclosan, caffeine, nicotine and food additives and alkyl phosphates. These data exhibit hot spots which may indicate possible research areas. Future research should focus on a compound identified in the literature and detected by Environment Agency monitoring. Possible topics could be a study of migration through the unsaturated zone. In many cases the mechanism for migration of emerging contaminants from the surface to groundwater is very unclear...|$|E
