5|$|Back to the Egg is {{the seventh}} and final studio album by the British-American band Wings, {{released}} in 1979 on Columbia Records in America, and on Parlophone in the UK. Co-produced by Chris Thomas, the album reflects band leader Paul McCartney's embracing of contemporary musical trends such as new wave and punk, and marked the arrival of new Wings members Laurence Juber and Steve Holley. Back to the Egg adopts a loose conceptual theme around {{the idea of a}} working band, and its creation coincided with a period of considerable activity for the group, which included making a return to touring <b>and</b> <b>work</b> <b>on</b> several television and film projects.|$|E
5|$|Beilhart {{left his}} brother-in-law's home {{a year later}} and went to live <b>and</b> <b>work</b> <b>on</b> a sheep farm. The family he lived with were devout Seventh Day Adventists. During this time, he became {{convinced}} that {{their view of the}} Bible and its teachings were quite different than what he had been raised to understand, but he accepted their religion entirely.|$|E

5|$|Hitmaker {{had tried}} to develop an on-line version of Crazy Taxi, to be called Crazy Taxi Next {{exclusively}} for the Xbox, which, besides multiplayer game modes, would have included night and day cycles, each with {{a different set of}} passengers and destinations, while reusing and graphically updating the maps from Crazy Taxi and Crazy Taxi 2. Ultimately, both multiplayer and day/night cycles were dropped <b>and</b> <b>work</b> <b>on</b> Crazy Taxi Next was transferred to Crazy Taxi 3: High Roller, which included some of the nighttime driving concepts suggested by Next.|$|E
5|$|In 1898 the Westbury and Hagley Water Act was passed, {{providing}} {{for construction of}} a reticulated water scheme using water from the Meander River and other streams. Hagley was connected to mains water via the Westbury-Hagley water scheme in 1902. By 1923 residents of Hagley were asking for an upgrade of the system, as it was seen as inadequate by then. The Westbury Council took out loans in 1952 to extend the system, <b>and</b> <b>work</b> <b>on</b> this extension continued into 1954, still connected to Westbury although with larger diameter pipes.|$|E
5|$|In October 2010, the old visitor centre closed <b>and</b> <b>work</b> <b>on</b> a new visitor centre started. The new Jodrell Bank Discovery Centre {{opened on}} Monday 11 April 2011.

A large orrery was installed in 2013.|$|E

5|$|Initial {{plans for}} the new cathedral were drawn up <b>and</b> <b>work</b> <b>on</b> the {{foundation}} began in 1562. The decision to have the cathedral face south instead of east was made in 1570. In the same year, construction commenced, working from the Gothic designs and models created by Claudio de Arciniega and Juan Miguel de Agüero, inspired by cathedrals found in Spanish cities such as Valladolid and Jaén.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} fire, the {{government}} of Madagascar established the Direction nationale des opérations Rova (DNOR, or National Office of Rova Operations), a body directed by four national experts within Madagascar's Ministry of Culture who were tasked with developing and overseeing plans for {{the reconstruction of the}} Rova. Two years after the fire, several key milestones in the process had been achieved, with objects recovered from the fire inventoried, site excavations completed, preliminary restoration plans for Manjakamiadana developed, <b>and</b> <b>work</b> <b>on</b> the royal chapel initiated. A ramp was also built to enable site access for the necessary heavy construction vehicles. Prior to work commencing, a traditional ceremony was performed to restore the sanctity of the site, which had served a dual role as both a physical tomb and spiritual link to venerated ancestors.|$|E
5|$|The {{boundary}} line was nonetheless still {{fairly easy to}} cross. Local inhabitants were able to maintain fields on the other side, or even to live on one side <b>and</b> <b>work</b> <b>on</b> the other. Refugees were able to sneak across or bribe the guards, and the smuggling of goods in both directions was rife. The flow of emigrants remained large despite the increase in East German security measures: 675,000people fled to West Germany between 1949 and 1952.|$|E

5|$|The game {{is filled}} {{with a variety of}} puzzles that must be solved to advance the story. These include memory games and mazes. Others involve {{competing}} against a computer-controlled opponent, completing a sequence in a limited number of moves, operating mechanisms, or using an inventory item. Puzzles do not all have to be completed in a precise order; there is some flexibility in terms of being able to move through game areas <b>and</b> <b>work</b> <b>on</b> different challenges.|$|E
5|$|There are {{no known}} {{contemporary}} documents describing the design or methods of {{construction of the}} canal and nothing about its opening. However, a report from 1632 on alterations to the river noted that 600 men {{were involved in the}} work, so presumably there was sufficient labour locally for such tasks. Wigmore probably used handbills at local inns to recruit his workers, since there were no newspapers to carry advertisements. The work would have been done using pickaxes, shovels and wheelbarrows. The excavated ditch was then lined with blue clay to make it watertight. Excavations for a sewer in 1974 <b>and</b> <b>work</b> <b>on</b> a rubbish tip in 1979 revealed the layers of blue clay, and there were clay pits near Stamford, which supported a pottery industry, although their precise location is unknown.|$|E
5|$|To develop {{fight and}} sword choreography for the series, the filmmakers {{employed}} Hollywood sword-master Bob Anderson. Anderson worked {{directly with the}} talent including Viggo Mortensen and Karl Urban to develop the film's many sword fights and stunts. Bob Anderson's role in The Lord of the Rings series was highlighted in the film Reclaiming the Blade. This documentary on sword martial arts also featured Weta Workshop and Richard Taylor, The Lord of the Rings illustrator John Howe and actors Viggo Mortensen and Karl Urban. All discussed their roles <b>and</b> <b>work</b> <b>on</b> the series as related to the sword.|$|E

5|$|United States forces {{captured}} Guam, Saipan and Tinian in the Mariana Islands between June and August 1944, {{as part of}} the Mariana and Palau Islands campaign. These islands {{were needed}} to provide bases for USAAF Twentieth Air Force B-29 Superfortress heavy bombers to attack the Japanese home islands. Construction of the large air bases needed to support B-29s began on Saipan in June 1944, {{before the end of the}} Battle of Saipan, <b>and</b> <b>work</b> <b>on</b> air fields on Tinian and Guam commenced in July and August respectively. The B-29s of the XXI Bomber Command began to arrive at Saipan starting on October12, and the 73rd Bombardment Wing began flying warm-up missions against Japanese-held islands in the Pacific on October27 in preparation for operations against Japan itself.|$|E
5|$|Work on {{the stadium}} was {{expected}} to start in late 2007 and finish {{in time for the}} 2010 season. Planning permission for the first stage of developments was granted on 7 April 2008 <b>and</b> <b>work</b> <b>on</b> the new players' block was planned to commence in the summer of 2008. It was decided to not start building until permission had been received for all phases of the development including the rebuilding of the Cricket Field Stand. In October 2008, the project was put on hold by the club {{as a result of the}} global economic crisis restricting available funds. Revised plans were revealed in November 2009, with further announcements expected in early 2010. However further developments may be further delayed due to the club's relegation from the Premier League.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} 2005, The Greencards {{relocated}} from Austin to Nashville, to {{be closer}} to their production company and its staff. Coinciding with their move to Nashville <b>and</b> <b>work</b> <b>on</b> their second album Weather and Water, the changes in location and sound were observed by critics to be a deliberate move from the jam-style of their debut album Movin' On to instead concentrate on Americana-focused music. By 2006, The Greencards had an annual slot at Merlefest, held yearly in Wilkesboro, North Carolina. The band was nominated in the Americana Music Association Awards for 2006 in the category of New/Emerging Artist of the Year, winning the award. In December 2006, their tour van rolled over on a patch of ice after leaving a performance in Bryan, Texas {{on the way back to}} Austin, but with no serious injuries.|$|E
