5|$|Administrative or Economic (Polish: gospodarcze) sejmiks oversaw {{voivodeship}} self-government. Often, {{they were}} held on the day following the deputational sejmik. Their decrees were known as laudas. Some of the specific issues that these sejmiks addressed included: dealing with taxation (distribution of national taxes) and tax collectors, managing the local (voivodeship) taxes and treasury, recruiting local military and (from mid-1700s) election of deputies to the Treasury Tribunals. These sejmiks <b>arose</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early 16th century.|$|E

5|$|Electoral (Polish: elekcyjne) sejmiks elected higher {{voivodeship}} officials, {{judges in}} particular. They were convened irregularly, as such offices were usually held for life.

5|$|Narcissus {{appears to}} have arisen {{in the area of}} the Iberian peninsula, {{southern}} France and north-western Italy, and within this area most sections of the genus appeared, with only a few taxa being dispersed to North Africa at a time when the African and West European platforms were closer together.

AD 500 and gave way to the Kanem and its successor state, the Bornu Empire. Kingdoms, fondoms, and chiefdoms <b>arose</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> west.|$|E
5|$|A {{tradition}} of indigenous literacy in Ottawa <b>arose</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 19th century, as speakers of Ottawa on Manitoulin Island became literate {{in their own}} language. Manitoulin Island Ottawas who were Catholic learned to write from French Catholic missionaries using a French-influenced orthography, while Methodist and Anglican converts used English-based orthographies. Documents written in Ottawa by Ottawa speakers on Manitoulin Island between 1823 and 1910 include official letters and petitions, personal documents, official Indian band regulations, an official proclamation, and census statements prepared by individuals. Ottawa speakers from Manitoulin Island contributed articles to Anishinabe Enamiad ("the Praying Indian"), an Ojibwe newspaper started by Franciscan missionaries and published in Harbor Springs, Michigan between 1896 and 1902.|$|E
5|$|According to Herodotus, the Persian commanders were {{concerned}} {{that they would not}} be able to defeat the Ionian fleet and, therefore, would not be able to take Miletus. So they sent the exiled Ionian tyrants to Lade, where each tried to persuade his fellow citizens to desert to the Persians. This approach was initially unsuccessful, but in the week-long delay before the battle, divisions <b>arose</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Ionian camp. These divisions led to the Samians secretly agreeing to the terms offered by the Persians, but remained with the other Ionians for the time being.|$|E

5|$|Features at {{the park}} include a fountain, artworks, a cafe, and a {{distinctive}} glass canopy. Director Park was designed by Laurie Olin of the design firm OLIN, and the Portland-based architectural firm ZGF Architects. The park {{is part of what}} had originally been planned as a corridor of consecutive public parks stretching across downtown Portland. This plan included what are today the South Park Blocks and the North Park Blocks. Proposals to connect the two sets of park blocks <b>arose</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1970s, and in 1998 businessman Tom Moyer made a proposal for what became Director Park. Planning began in the mid-2000s, and construction began in 2008.|$|E

It was popular throughout the 1980s and the beginning of the 1990s, bringing to prominence bands including Poison, Skid Row, Cinderella, and Warrant. Glam metal was associated with flashy clothing and makeup. Poison, for example, had long shaggy or backcombed hair, accessories, metal studs, leather, and make-up during their live performances.|$|E
5|$|In 1964–65 {{a renewed}} {{interest}} in Shanina <b>arose</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Soviet press, largely due to the publication of her diary. The newspaper Severny Komsomolets asked Shanina's contemporaries to write what they knew about her. Streets in Arkhangelsk, Shangaly and Stroyevskoye were named after her, and the village of Yedma has a museum dedicated to Shanina. The local school where she studied in 1931–35 has a commemorative plate. In Arkhangelsk, regular shooting competitions were organized among members of the paramilitary DOSAAF sport organisation for the Roza Shanina Prize, while Novodvinsk organized an open shooting sports championship in her memory. The village of Malinovka in Ustyansky District started to hold annual cross-country ski races for the Roza Shanina Prize.|$|E
