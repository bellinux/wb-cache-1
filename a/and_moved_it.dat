5|$|Inn-yard theatres {{were first}} {{established}} in the Tudor period, with the Boar's Head Inn (1557) in Whitechapel, the George in Stepney and a purpose built, but short lived, John Brayne's Red Lion Theatre (1567), nearby. The first permanent theatres with resident companies were constructed in Shoreditch, with James Burbage's The Theatre (1576) and Henry Lanman's Curtain Theatre (1577) standing close together. On the night of 28 December 1598 Burbage's sons dismantled The Theatre, <b>and</b> <b>moved</b> <b>it</b> piece by piece across the Thames to construct the Globe Theatre.|$|E

5|$|Chris Hadfield, a Canadian Space Agency {{astronaut}} and STS-74 mission specialist, {{used the}} shuttle's robot arm to hoist the docking module {{out of the}} aft portion of the payload bay, rotated it to a vertical position, <b>and</b> <b>moved</b> <b>it</b> to within five inches of the Orbiter Docking System. At that point, the shuttle fired its downward steering jets and moved the shuttle toward the docking module. Once the two spacecraft were locked together, the docking ring on the Orbiter Docking System retracted, {{and a series of}} hooks and latches were engaged to ensure an airtight seal between the two spacecraft.|$|E
5|$|In 1910, {{the city}} {{installed}} a large boulder on the southeast {{portion of the}} grounds. The Oregon Railway and Navigation Company had found the 15,000-year-old boulder in 1897 <b>and</b> <b>moved</b> <b>it</b> to Portland. The ten ton Wallula Stone was discovered in the Columbia River Gorge, and was covered with petroglyphs. It was returned to the Umatilla tribe of Native Americans in Eastern Oregon in 1996. The old elevators inside were replaced again in 1946, and in 1948 a runaway truck destroyed part of the stone railing on the Fifth Avenue side, which was then fixed.|$|E
5|$|The Indiana Woman's Suffrage Association {{was founded}} in 1851 by {{important}} suffrage leaders such as Agnes Cook, Mary B. Birdsall, Amanda M. Way, and Mary F. Thomas. With the exception of Way, all these women {{were the first to}} address the Indiana State Legislature on January 19, 1859, with petitions calling for women's suffrage, temperance, and equal rights. In 1854 Birdsall had purchased The Lily, the first U.S. newspaper edited by and for women, from its founder, Amelia Bloomer, <b>and</b> <b>moved</b> <b>it</b> to Richmond, Indiana. The newspaper had begun as a temperance newspaper but was later used to campaign for women's suffrage and rights.|$|E

5|$|The Panic of 1837 {{hurt the}} Spirit's circulation, but Porter responded by buying out his main competition, the American Turf Register and Sporting Magazine <b>and</b> <b>moved</b> <b>it</b> to New York City. Porter edited the Turf Register until the paper stopped being {{published}} in 1844. Porter continued {{the publication of}} annual stallion lists and the publication of lists of horses owned by breeders. However, {{the purchase of the}} American Turf Register strained Porter's finances, and he sold the Spirit to another printer, John Richards, who retained Porter as editor. The 1840s were prosperous, but in the 1850s the magazine again encountered difficulties. Around 1855, Porter left Richards' paper, and in 1856, another printer, George Wilkes, began a new sporting newspaper, which he called Porter's Spirit of the Times, and employed Porter as editor.|$|E
5|$|Amanita regalis {{was first}} {{described}} as Agaricus muscarius β regalis by Elias Magnus Fries in his Systema Mycologicum, published in 1821. In 1887, Pier Andrea Saccardo treated it as {{a variety of}} Amanitamuscaria. Edmund Michael, in 1903, became the first to consider it a distinct species. In 1941, Jean-Edouard Gilbert suggested a complete reorganization of the genus Amanita in his world monograph of the genus, <b>and</b> <b>moved</b> <b>it</b> to Amanitaria as A.muscaria var. regalis. In his original (1949) version of Agaricales in Modern Taxonomy, Rolf Singer considered it a subspecies of A.muscaria, but noted {{that it may be}} regarded as a separate species; in the fourth edition (1986), he listed it as a distinct species. A.regalis is classified in a section of Amanita within the genus, a grouping of related Amanitas that have a ring on the stem (or remnants thereof), and a bulb at the base of it. More recently, a Japanese group studied the biogeography of A.muscaria and related species, and, using molecular phylogenetic analysis, concluded that the taxon should be considered a grouping of A.muscaria, rather than a distinct species. However, as of 2012, both Index Fungorum and MycoBank list the taxon as Amanita regalis.|$|E

Kamenev formulated a policy of conditional support of the newly formed Russian Provisional Government and a reconciliation with the Mensheviks.
