30|$|Self-efficacy beliefs {{refer to}} the beliefs that {{individuals}} hold about their abilities to successfully execute those activities necessary to achieve desired outcomes (Bandura 1977; Hutchison et al. 2006). An individual who has high self-efficacy would {{be more willing to}} engage, work harder, and persist longer in the face of failure, challenges, and difficulties than an individual who doubts his own abilities (Renninger <b>and</b> <b>Hidi</b> 2016). Self-efficacy is associated with the anticipated level of attainment required and with the strength of one’s belief that that level of attainment is achievable. As such, it differs from self-confidence, which refers only to the strength of a belief in one’s ability.|$|E
30|$|In {{the first}} phase, {{interest}} is “triggered” by specific characteristics of stimuli such as personal relevance, humor, and novelty (Sadoski 2001; Renninger <b>and</b> <b>Hidi</b> 2002). Triggered interest may also occur when learners encounter instructional activities that provide developmentally appropriate challenge and intensity. In this first phase, learners often demonstrate fleeting attention to content {{and higher levels}} of affect (both positive and negative emotions). For example, an activity that makes students either excited or frustrated may trigger their interest. This first phase of interest development is necessary to allow for more lasting individualized interest development (Renninger et al. 2008). However, although students may have their interest initially hooked, this interest may be temporary without further autonomy support, guidance, and opportunity for follow up exploration (Renninger and Su 2012).|$|E
40|$|More {{than half}} of Australian primary {{teachers}} have negative feelings about mathematics (Carroll, 1998). This research study investigates whether {{it is possible to}} change negative beliefs and anxieties about mathematics in preservice student teachers so that they can perceive mathematics as a subject that is creative and where discourse is possible (Ernest, 1991). In this study, sixteen maths-anxious preservice primary education student teachers were engaged in computer-mediated collaborative open-ended mathematical activities and discourse. Prior to, and after their mathematical activity, the students participated in a short thirty-second Online Anxiety Survey based on ideas by Ainley <b>and</b> <b>Hidi</b> (2002) and Boekaerts (2002), to ascertain changes to their beliefs about the various mathematical activities. The analysis of this data facilitated the identification of key episodes that led to the changes in beliefs. The findings from this study provide teacher educators with a better understanding of what changes need to occur in pre-service mathematics education programs, so as to improve perceptions about mathematics in maths-anxious pre-service education students and subsequently primary mathematics teachers...|$|E

40|$|The {{dissertation}} explores tourist {{encounters with}} two Arctic winter tourism contexts in Northern Norway. Through three ethnographic fieldworks on the coastal steamer Hurtigruten, {{and a small}} peninsula of eastern Finnmark called Ekkerøy, learning experiences are scrutinized. As tourists visit a region they know relatively little about beforehand, how important is the external scaffolding of these learning experiences? Through analyses of the emotion of interest (Silvia 2006), this work offer new insights for the domain of experience economy in tourism research (Dahl 2013). A spatial-emotional methodology is introduced combining knowledge from the disciplines of psychology and anthropology. As the candidate is an anthropologist this dissertation is a contribution in the social science domain, despite its obvious reliance upon psychological theory. It is argued that emotions are constructs that includes both heterogeneous and material environments and particular subjectively experiencing bodies (Lazarus 1991). As such, traditional ethnographic approaches {{to the study of}} emotions, which mainly emphasized the exogenic (environmental) aspect of the construct of emotion, needs to be expanded to include the endogenic (embodiment, subjective experience, motivation etc.). The dissertation thus contains a multi- method triangulation ethnography and an analytic autoethnography in addressing these demands as such approaches includes both self-reports as well as participant observation over time. Together they provide a temporal approach to the emotion of interest describing complex body-environment interplays that is previously not undertaken in interest research (Silvia 2006, Renninger <b>and</b> <b>Hidi</b> 2015) ...|$|E

5000|$|Keeping {{students}} {{motivated and}} interested are two important factors underlying content-based instruction. Motivation and interest are crucial in supporting student success with challenging, informative activities that support success and which help the student learn complex skills (Grabe & Stoller, 1997). When students are motivated {{and interested in}} the material they are learning, they make greater connections between topics, elaborations with learning material and can recall information better (Alexander, Kulikowich, & Jetton, 1994: Krapp, Hidi, & Renninger, 1992). In short, when a student is intrinsically motivated the student achieves more. This in turn leads to a perception of success, of gaining positive attributes which will continue a circular learning pattern of success <b>and</b> interest. Krapp, <b>Hidi</b> <b>and</b> Renninger (1992) state that, [...] "situational interest, triggered by environmental factors, may evoke or {{contribute to the development}} of long-lasting individual interests" [...] (p. 18). Because CBI is student centered, one of its goals is to keep students interested and motivation high by generating stimulating content instruction and materials.|$|R

30|$|Achievement {{emotions}} {{were also found}} to be associated with students’ situational interest. Specifically, quantitative results showed that excitement had a positive association with students’ interest in the makerspace course. These trends were also corroborated by qualitative accounts, where students’ positive {{emotions were}} clearly associated with maintaining student interest. Our results {{are similar to those of}} previous studies, which have found that positive emotions are closely linked to interest development (Ainley et al. 2002; <b>Hidi</b> <b>and</b> Renninger 2006). In their description of the four phases of interest development, <b>Hidi</b> <b>and</b> Renninger (2006) pointed out that positive emotions like excitement is particularly important for maintaining interest. In our qualitative accounts, students who experienced intense excitement of successfully solving a design issue also exhibited indicators of maintained interest, such as choosing to continue work on the project when it was no longer required. Examining implications of positive emotions on interest development after interest has already been triggered is an important avenue for additional research and would provide more insights into the close relationship between achievement emotions and interest development.|$|R
40|$|Students can be {{regarded}} as professional readers: they have to attend to, comprehend and remember the most important information in instructional texts, often about topics they are not readily interested in. Optimising such instructional texts {{has been the subject of}} much reading research. This research has shown robust effects for the influence of text structure: information highlighted by a strongly organising structure is retained better than seemingly less important information. <b>Hidi</b> <b>and</b> Baird (1986) suggest that such effects of structure are artefacts, because of the dullness of texts used in such experiments. They argue that readers mainly use interest instead of structure as their guide for attention and learning. In this article three related experiments using Dutch instructional texts are reported. Both interest and text structure were manipulated as within-item factors, and on-line as well as off-line methods were used to measure effects on the reading process and product. The outcomes show no support for the hypothesis of <b>Hidi</b> <b>and</b> Baird: students learn better from texts that are well structured, regardless of the interest of the text or its topic...|$|R
30|$|In {{addition}} to social cognitive theory, we also drew upon a prominent theory of interest development by <b>Hidi</b> <b>and</b> Renninger (2006).

30|$|In {{educational}} psychology, {{interest is}} now widely accepted {{as an important}} motivational variable that could contribute to unfolding the affective as well as cognitive aspects of learning.

40|$|Purpose: This paper {{addresses}} {{the management of}} undergraduate final year research dissertations. It intends to explain and clarify our experience of two models of delivery (student-led/academic-led) with reference to interest development theory (<b>Hidi</b> <b>and</b> Renninger, 2006). Approach: We focus on the advantages and drawbacks of each model {{within the context of}} the research literature, and describe a case study of the experiences of lecturers and students in one Division of a metropolitan UK University, running a leading programme in Speech & Language Therapy (Pathology). Recommendations are made which are intended to be of use to colleagues across disciplines and organisations. Findings: We argue that a delivery where students can choose their research topic from a limited set suggested by supervisors (academic-led model) is best placed to meet motivational challenges in <b>Hidi</b> <b>and</b> Renninger’s framework, and also increase feasibility for staff. We discuss how such a model might best be implemented. Originality: Describing case study experiences within a conceptual framework is important for the development of improved supervision methods. It is hoped that this case study paper will inform other institutions by providing clear theoretical underpinnings and practical recommendations; and that it will lead to further empirical research into models of organising final year dissertations...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In January 2001 the Hungarian {{government}} {{increased the}} minimum wage from Ft 25, 500 to Ft 40, 000. One year later the wage floor rose further to Ft 50, 000. The paper looks at the short-run impact of the first hike on small-firm employment and flows between employment and unemployment. It finds that the hike significantly increased labor costs and reduced employment in the small firm sector; and adversely affected the job retention and job finding probabilities of low-wage workers. While the conditions for a positive employment effect were mostly met in depressed regions spatial inequalities were amplified rather than reduced. Acknowledgement.

40|$|This article {{presents}} a research {{about the development}} of interest in teaching. The subjects of study were students of a public University of Paraná, Brazil, who integrated the a project in initial training called PIBID in scientific areas (Biological Sciences, Physics and Chemistry). The methodological procedures were based on the discursive textual analysis, from which it was possible to organize the data according to the Four-Phases Model of Interest Development (MDI) of <b>Hidi</b> <b>and</b> Renninger (2006). After analysis, it was possible to characterize the interest of these students in teaching, suggesting that this interest can be developed in students during initial training. Our data showed, moreover, that interest in teaching has two main characteristics: the desire to be a teacher and the curiosity of the students to know how is to be a teacher. In addition, {{it was found that the}} school teachers can directly influence the maintenance of student interest in following a teaching career...|$|R
40|$|Currently, {{there is}} no {{standard}} protocol to identify students who are gifted in science. If students are identified as gifted early on in elementary school, teachers and parents can foster their interest, increasing the students’ knowledge, value, and affect {{as well as their}} willingness to re-engage science (Eccles 2 ̆ 6 Wigfield, 2002; Gottfried 2 ̆ 6 Gottfried, 1996; Häussler 1987; Neber 2 ̆ 6 Schommer-Aikins, 2002; Osborne, 2003; Schunk, Pintrich, 2 ̆ 6 Meece, 2008). In this study, a brief student identification form was developed for elementary school teachers to complete. The form was based on <b>Hidi</b> <b>and</b> Renninger’s (2006) four-phase model of interest development. The form was one piece of a more comprehensive identification protocol. Students in grades second, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth from six Warren County elementary schools were asked to participate in this study. However, due to insufficient data, grades two and six were not used after collection. Few sixth grade teachers completed the forms and second graders did not take the ITBS. This study primarily focused on identifying students from underrepresented populations.

30|$|Our {{objective}} was to explore elementary school students’ self-efficacy trajectory through a semester-long makerspace course, and how changes in self-efficacy are associated with experiences {{of positive and negative}} achievement emotions. Additionally, we examined students’ situational interest trajectory, and how it is related to self-efficacy and achievement emotions. One important finding of this study is the result that students’ situational interest and self-efficacy remained moderately high overall, with most students scoring above the median score in situational interest and self-efficacy across all time points. In general, students also had more positive emotional reactions to makerspace activities compared to negative emotions. These results echoed the positive motivational benefits of design-based learning found in previous studies. Specifically, the overall moderate to high levels of self-efficacy and situational interest could be due to the increased student autonomy and ownership towards learning, as demonstrated by several studies (Doppelt 2009; Gerber et al. 2012). The present study also suggests that students’ overall positive emotional reactions towards makerspace activities are likely associated with relatively high self-efficacy and interest in the design-based makerspace program. Our findings echoed trends from previous research, which found positive relationships between positive emotions and self-efficacy (Bandura et al. 1996; Carrier 2009; Goetz et al. 2008; Ren 2000) and between positive emotions and interest (Ainley et al. 2002; <b>Hidi</b> <b>and</b> Renninger 2006).|$|R
30|$|One highly {{influential}} theory combining expectancy-value approaches {{with learning}} emotions is Pekrun’s (2006) control-value theory of achievement emotions. It integrates attributional theories of achievement emotions {{as well as}} theories of perceived control and assumptions concerning the effects of emotions on learning and performance (Pekrun 2006, pp 316). The theoretical framework considers the subjective impression of control over achievement activities and outputs {{as well as their}} value as the key determinants of emotions. Achievement emotions are by definition directly tied to either achievement activities or outcomes. Corresponding to this differentiation, boredom can also be understood as an activity-related achievement emotion, which is supposed to occur when achievement-related learning activities or situations do not offer any incentive value and when individuals lack the feeling of control (Pekrun 2006, pp 324; Pekrun et al. 2010, pp 532). In the framework of the control-value-theory, control refers to the subjective possibility of an individual to influence learning activities and outcomes and may include perceptions such as being adequately challenged in a learning situation (Frenzel et al. 2007). Concerning teaching and learning during class, the feeling of control is closely related to instructional pace and the degree of individualisation. Value, meanwhile, refers to one’s subjective perception {{of the importance of the}} learning contents, tasks and achievement goals (Eccles 2005) which may correspond with subjective interest during the teaching and learning process—interest by itself “can serve as a source of task value” (<b>Hidi</b> <b>and</b> Renninger 2006).|$|R
40|$|Multiple {{laboratory}} and epidemiological studies find secondhand smoke exposure causes adverse health outcomes. Additionally, {{an increasing number}} of studies at community, state and national levels identify significant reductions in hospital admission rate of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) after implementation of a smoke-free indoor air law. A more complete understanding of the health and other benefits related to implementation of community-wide smoke-free ordinances will increase evidence to support policy change in additional communities. Purpose: This project examines changes in hospital admissions for AMI before and after implementation of the comprehensive indoor air ordinance in Columbia, MO. Method: The Hospital Industry Data Institute (<b>HIDI)</b> <b>and</b> Harry S. Truman Memorial Veterans' Hospital provided incidence data for AMI admissions in Columbia, surrounding areas and a regional comparison city without a comprehensive smoke-free indoor air ordinance (Jefferson City, MO) for three years before and two years after implementation of Columbia's smoke-free policy. Poisson analyses tested differences in population-adjusted AMI rates before and after implementation in each population. Results: Implementation of a smoke-free ordinance in Columbia was associated with a 25 % reduction in the rate of acute myocardial infarction (p< 0. 05), compared to an 18 % decrease in areas surrounding Columbia (p< 0. 05) and a non-significant 11 % decline in Jefferson City. Conclusion: Implementation of a smoke-free ordinance in Columbia, MO is associated with a significant reduction in hospital admissions for AMI among those residing in city limits and surrounding areas...|$|R

Severe Se deficiency (0. 003 mg of Se/kg) caused almost total loss of GSH-Px activity and mRNA in liver <b>and</b> heart. 5 <b>'IDI</b> activity decreased by 95 % in liver and its mRNA by 50 %; in the thyroid, activity increased by 15 % and mRNA by 95 %. PHGSH-Px activity was reduced by 75 % in the liver and 60 % in the heart but mRNA levels were unchanged; in the thyroid, PHGSH-Px activity was unaffected by Se depletion but its mRNA increased by 52 %. Thus there is differential regulation of the three mRNAs and subsequent protein synthesis within and between organs, suggesting both that mechanisms exist to channel Se for {{synthesis of}} a particular enzyme {{and that there is}} tissue-specific regulation of selenoenzyme mRNAs. During Se depletion, the levels of selenoenzyme mRNA did not necessarily parallel the changes in enzyme activity, suggesting a distinct mechanism for regulating mRNA levels. Nuclear run-off assays with isolated liver nuclei showed severe Se deficiency to have no effect on transcription of the three genes, suggesting that there is post-transcriptional control of the three selenoenzymes, probably involving regulation of mRNA stability...|$|R

PATIENTS AND METHODS: From February to September 2007, 117 consecutive patients with lower urinary tract symptoms secondary to BPH were included; 62 patients were treated with 120 -W HPS laser vaporization and 55 with 980 -nm HiDi laser ablation of the prostate. We evaluated perioperative variables, and complications during and after surgery. Patients presenting for follow-up completed the International Prostate Symptom Score, and had their maximum urinary flow rate and postvoid residual urine volume measured. RESULTS: The mean (sd) age of the patients was 72. 3 (8. 8) years (<b>HiDi)</b> <b>and</b> 73. 1 (10. 8) years (HPS), with a mean preoperative prostate volume of 64. 7 (29. 7) and 67. 4 (46. 9) mL, respectively. The mean operative duration was comparable, at 56. 4 (20. 2) and 62. 7 (36. 3) min, respectively, whereas the mean energy delivery was significantly higher with the diode laser, at 313 (132) vs 187 (129) kJ (P > 0. 001). For patients treated with the HPS the rate of visual impairment from bleeding was higher (0 % vs 12. 9 %, P > 0. 01), as was prostate capsule perforation (0 % vs 4. 8 %, P 0. 05) was higher for the HiDi laser. During the follow-up there were higher rates of bladder neck stricture (14. 5 % vs 1. 6 %, P > 0. 01), re-treatment (18. 2 % vs 1. 6 %, P > 0. 01) and stress urinary incontinence (9. 1 % vs 0 %; P > 0. 05) for the HiDi laser group. CONCLUSION: Both systems investigated provide good tissue ablative properties. The HiDi laser at 980 nm is more favourable in terms of haemostasis. The penetration depths, resulting in coagulation necrosis and leading to increased re-treatment, bladder neck stricture and incontinence rates, were higher with the HiDi laser...|$|R
40|$|Comparing the {{mathematics}} performance of American students to {{their counterparts in}} other countries has been a common theme in recent literature, with conclusions generally finding that American students are falling far behind. One response to this problem may involve research which has shown a modest positive correlation between student interest and achievement in math (Koller, Baumert, 2 ̆ 6 Schnabel, 2001; Schiefele, Krapp, 2 ̆ 6 Winteler, 1992). Being able to identify students {{with high levels of}} interest in math may allow educators to provide advanced instruction to such students. Current measures of student interest in mathematics are lacking in that they often are not based on any one theory, they do not cover all characteristics of individual interest, and are based on a self-report format. Therefore, the goal of this thesis was to develop a teacher identification form of student interest in mathematics to add to the literature a psychometrically sound measure of student interest in math which is assessed by classroom teachers instead of the students themselves. The teacher identification form was developed based on the characteristics of individual interest as defined by <b>Hidi</b> <b>and</b> Renninger’s (2006) Four-Phase Model of Interest Development. To determine reliability and validity of the form, second through sixth grade math teachers in six elementary schools in Warren County, KY completed the form both in a pilot study and also later as part of an identification process for students to receive advanced math instruction. For the purposes of data analysis, results were separated by grade. Reliability estimates for the form, as indicated by Cronbach’s alpha, were found to be. 934 for third grade,. 925 for fourth grade, and. 901 for fifth grade. The overall Cronbach’s alpha for grades two through five was. 926. These high reliability coefficients indicate high consistency among the items. Validity of the identification form was established by correlating results with the Iowa Tests of Basic Skills (ITBS) math section, a standardized assessment taken by all students in the six schools. Correlations between teacher identification rating composites and ITBS math scores were as follows:. 379 for third grade,. 417 for fourth grade, and. 460 for fifth grade. The sixth grade data set was incomplete, and thus that correlation for was. 300. Each individual item on the identification form and the grade composite scores all correlated with ITBS math scores significantly at the. 01 level, indicating sufficient validity of the form. An important observation about the results is that the highest validity coefficients as well as the narrowest range of correlations were found for fifth grade data. The next highest correlations were found for fourth grade, and the lowest correlations and widest range of correlations were found for third grade data. The possibility that this pattern of results may be due to better developed individual interests of older students or that students’ individual interests are more easily identified by their teachers in higher grades is discussed...|$|R
