Although columnists Stacy Jenel Smith and Marilyn Beck {{reported}} in a 2002 article that producer Scott Rudin would refuse {{to work on a}} sequel, the actresses have made various statements to the contrary. In a Chicago Sun-Times interview in 2003, Keaton expressed her readiness to appear in a second film. A year later, writer Paul Rudnick reportedly started writing a draft, entitled Avon Ladies of the Amazon, and in 2005, Midler confirmed to USA Today that there was indeed a manuscript but that [...] "the strike kept it from happening." [...] However, as Hawn declared in a 2006 interview with the New York Daily News, Paramount Pictures declined the trio's services due to their demand for an increase in fees: [...] "I {{got a call from the}} head of the studio, who said, 'Let's try to make it work.

Now, if there were three men that came back to do a sequel, they would have paid them three times their salary at least." [...] On February 25, 2011, Goldie Hawn posted a picture on Twitter of the three at a lunch confirming that they had all signed on for a sequel, and the next day re-tweeted a message from Bravo TV confirming this again. In 2016, Hawn confirmed that Netflix was working on a sequel, though she also admitted that [...] "the script isn’t working.” ...|$|E
