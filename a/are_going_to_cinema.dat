2500|$|In 1962 Vertinskaya {{starred in}} the Amphibian Man, Gennady Kazansky and Vladimir Chebotarev's {{adaptation}} of Alexander Belyayev's science fiction novel of the same title. Cast as Gutierrez, {{a young woman in}} love with an amphibian man, Vertinskaya had to go through difficult late autumn underwater shooting sessions which she performed all by herself, without any stuntwomen involved. The film became the Soviet 1962 box-office blockbuster. [...] "Vertinskaya was now a brand. People <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> the <b>cinema</b> <b>to</b> watch her, specifically," [...] her future husband Nikita Mikhalkov later recalled. All this changed the teenage actress's life dramatically. [...] "In those days there weren't any bodyguards. I used to travel by tram to my studies. I had to queue for bread like everyone else. Not only was I recognized, they made a point of touching me too... It was in those days that I developed the fear of crowds... This immense psychic violence haunted me all through those years," [...] she later remembered.|$|R
50|$|In the meantime, Erwin is {{carrying}} {{out his own}} day job as a taxi driver. While he is fixing the car, his depot receives {{a phone call from}} his wife, Annie (a model in the real world), who wants to know if they <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> the <b>cinema</b> that evening. Erwin clearly is not keen to go - he simply comments that Greta Garbo is showing until the following Tuesday. (One of the running themes of the movie is to play down the importance of the cinema in the lives of these young Berliners.) At the end of the day, Erwin returns home to find Annie moping about - she seems to spend most of her time lying on the bed in a fairly threadbare apartment. The couple start to get ready to go <b>to</b> the <b>cinema,</b> but they continually bicker with each other. The first row is over the pictures of movie stars in their bathroom - it is clear that all the actors are there for Annie's benefit, while the actresses are there for Erwin, because they punish each other by tearing up each other's photos. Another row is over whether Annie should wear the brim of her hat up or down. (Another recurrent theme of the movie is the self-centred machismo represented by Erwin and Wolfgang.) Wolfgang arrives {{in the middle of this}} argument, so Annie never gets <b>to</b> the <b>cinema.</b> Instead, Erwin and Wolfgang drink beer and plan to go to the countryside the following day.|$|R

In 1963, assisted by Lyudmila Maksakova, her elder sister Marianna's friend, Vertinskaya enrolled into the Boris Shchukin Theatre Institute. The young actress' eagerness to act was, in her own words, [...] "next to maniacal." [...] Nikita Mikhalkov was one of her fellow students. They fell in love and married in 1966, only to be divorced three years later.|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{research}} is to identify the common traits of customer misbehaviour and the motives behind such deviant acts in Malaysia. It is also aims to find out which service industries are prone to customer misbehaviour. Services have become part of everyone’s life, <b>be</b> it <b>going</b> <b>to</b> the <b>cinema,</b> taking a train, or dining in the restaurant. Customers that are physically present in the service area for consumption of goods and services are given the opportunity to misbehave, be it in the form of vandalism, pilfering or other unpleasant deeds. ‘Aberrant Consumer Behaviour’, a conceptual theory by Ronald A. Fullerton and Girish Punj and Christopher Lovelock’s the ‘Jaycustomer’ theory was used as the basis of this research. After reviewing the existing literature, a quantitative research was conducted to address the issues highlighted in the questionnaire posted on the Internet. The findings from a sample of 78 were then analysed and discussed. The result of the study was deemed useful to provide insights on customer misbehaviour in the context of Malaysia. It identified customers as being afraid to admit to their deviant acts; however, it was able to provide insights on the motives behind those acts. Most of the customers think that their deviant acts are impromptu or spontaneous and motivated by the unhelpful, inattentive, impolite and not informative service personnel. Service industries, like restaurants and service centres were found to be more prone to customer misbehaviour than others and solutions were suggested to these organisations/firms to minimise or avoid such deviant acts...|$|R
