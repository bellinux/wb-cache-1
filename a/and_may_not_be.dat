5|$|A {{home run}} {{is a hit}} in which the player reaches home plate, and scores a run on the same play without being called out. Most often in modern baseball, this occurs when a player hits the ball over the outfield wall in fair territory. However, it can occur on a ball hit to the outfield with a fast runner when the ball does not leave the field of play; this is called an inside-the-park home run. Home-run hitters are often likely to be larger, slower players due to their strength, <b>and</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> fast enough to {{complete}} the triple. The MLB single-season and all-time leader in home runs is Barry Bonds, who hit 73 home runs in the 2001 season and notched 762 in his 22-season career. Bonds never hit for the cycle. The highest on the list {{to do so is}} Alex Rodriguez (fourth all-time; 696 home runs as of January 16, 2017), who hit for the cycle on June 5, 1997.|$|E
5|$|All the {{candidates}} in a GRC must either {{be members of}} the same political party or independent candidates standing as a group, and at least one of {{the candidates}} must be a person belonging to the Malay, Indian or some other minority community. A person is regarded as belonging to the Malay community if, regardless of whether or not he or she is of the Malay race, considers himself or herself to be a member of the community and is generally accepted as such by the community. Similarly, a person will belong to the Indian community or some other minority community if he or she considers himself or herself a member and the community accepts him or her as such. The minority status of candidates is determined by two committees appointed by the President, the Malay Community Committee and the Indian and Other Minority Communities Committee.

5|$|All three {{ships were}} {{initially}} assigned to various squadrons in the First Fleet {{and then became}} flotilla leaders in mid-1914. When the war began in August, Amphion and Fearless and their flotillas (the 3rd and 1st Destroyer Flotillas (DF), respectively) {{were part of the}} Harwich Force. The morning after Britain joined the war, the force sortied on a patrol to the Dutch coast. The 3rd DF encountered and sank a German minelayer, SMS Königin Luise, but not before she had laid many of her mines. While returning home the following morning, Amphion accidentally struck a mine on 6 August off the Thames Estuary and sank with the loss of 132 crewmen killed. She was the first ship of the Royal Navy to be sunk in the First World War.

Divers from the Smithsonian Institution recovered an anchor, dishes from the ship's dining hall {{and a variety of}} other artifacts during their 1967 expedition. Tecumseh′s engine room gong was also removed and is currently on display at the Hampton Roads Naval Museum.

5|$|The Safety Board {{believes}} that the flight crew of Flight 405 should have taken more positive steps to assure a contamination-free wing, such as entering the cabin {{to look at the}} wing from a closer range. Although the Safety Board acknowledges that the detection of minimal amounts of contamination, sufficient to cause aerodynamic performance problems, is difficult <b>and</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> possible without a tactile inspection, an observation from the cabin would have improved the chance of seeing some contamination and might have prompted the flight crew to return to the gate. The Safety Board {{believes that}} the flight crew’s failure to take such precautions and the decision to attempt takeoff while unsure of wing cleanliness led to this accident and is a cause of it.|$|E

There it was seized by the Federal Bureau of Investigation after being offered for sale to various institutions.

5|$|An {{individual}} player's turn batting or plate {{appearance is}} complete when the player reaches base, hits a home run, makes an out, or hits a ball {{that results in}} the team's third out, {{even if it is}} recorded against a teammate. On rare occasions, a batter may be at the plate when, without the batter's hitting the ball, a third out is recorded against a teammate—for instance, a runner getting caught stealing (tagged out attempting to steal a base). A batter with this sort of incomplete plate appearance starts off the team's next turn batting; any balls or strikes recorded against the batter the previous inning are erased. A runner may circle the bases only once per plate appearance and thus can score at most a single run per batting turn. Once a player has completed a plate appearance, that player may not bat again until the eight other members of the player's team have all taken their turn at bat. The batting order is set before the game begins, <b>and</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> altered except for substitutions. Once a player has been removed for a substitute, that player may not reenter the game. Children's games often have more liberal substitution rules.|$|E
5|$|Lesions can be transverse, {{occurring}} {{between the}} rings of the trachea, longitudinal or spiral. They may occur along the membranous {{part of the}} trachea, the main bronchi, or both. In 8% of ruptures, lesions are complex, occurring {{in more than one}} location, with more than one type of lesion, or on both of the main bronchi and the trachea. Transverse tears are more common than longitudinal or complex ones. The laceration may completely transect the airway or it may go only partway around. Partial tears that do not go {{all the way around the}} circumference of the airway do not allow a lacerated airway to become completely detached; tears that encircle the whole airway can allow separation to occur. Lacerations may also be classified as complete or incomplete. In an incomplete lesion, a layer of tissue surrounding the bronchus remains intact and can keep the air in the airway, preventing it from leaking into the areas surrounding the airways. Incomplete lacerations may require closer scrutiny to detect <b>and</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> diagnosed right away.|$|E
5|$|The {{ships which}} sail the {{southern}} sea {{and south of}} it are like houses. When their sails are spread they are like great clouds in the sky. Their rudders are several tens of feet long. A single ship carries several hundred men, and has in the stores a year's supply of grain. Pigs are fed and wine fermented on board. There is no account of dead or living, no {{going back to the}} mainland when once the people have set forth upon the caerulean sea. At daybreak, when the gong sounds aboard the ship, the animals can drink their fill, and crew and passengers alike forget all dangers. To those on board everything is hidden and lost in space, mountains, landmarks, and the countries of foreigners. The shipmaster may say 'To make such and such a country, with a favourable wind, in so many days, we should sight such and such a mountain, (then) the ship must steer in such and such a direction'. But suddenly the wind may fall, <b>and</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> strong enough to allow of the sighting of the mountain on the given day; in such a case, bearings may have to be changed. And the ship (on the other hand) may be carried far beyond (the landmark) and may lose its bearings. A gale may spring up, the ship may be blown hither and thither, it may meet with shoals or be driven upon hidden rocks, then it may be broken to the very roofs (of its deckhouses). A great ship with heavy cargo has nothing to fear from the high seas, but rather in shallow water it will come to grief.|$|E
