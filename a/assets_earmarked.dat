40|$|Total U. S. {{retirement}} {{assets were}} $ 16. 0 trillion at year-end 2009, up nearly $ 2. 0 trillion, or 14 percent, from year-end 2008. The increase in retirement assets largely {{was driven by}} investment returns. Nearly all asset classes experienced positive total returns in 2009. • Market performance exerted upward pressure on most retirement plan assets in 2009. Individual retirement account (IRA) assets rose $ 651 billion, or 18 percent; and defined contribution (DC) plan assets rose $ 635 billion, or 18 percent. Despite net outflows in 2009, state and local pension plan assets rose $ 341 billion, or 14 percent, and private-sector defined benefit (DB) plan assets rose $ 191 billion, or 10 percent. Total federal government pension assets, which were primarily invested in nonmarketable government securities, rose 8 percent in 2009. • <b>Assets</b> <b>earmarked</b> for retirement are {{a key component of}} households ’ balance sheets. At year-end 2009, retirement assets represented 35 percent of all U. S. households ’ financial assets. DC plan accounts were 9 percent of household financial assets and IRA assets were another 9 percent. • Employer-sponsored retirement plans {{play a key role in}} helping American workers save for retirement. The bulk (nearly two-thirds) of Americans ’ retirement assets were held in employersponsored retirement plans at year-end 2009. Furthermore, a significant portion of assets held in IRAs originated in employer plans and were then transferred (or “rolled over”) into IRAs. • DC plan and IRA assets invested in mutual funds constituted one-quarter of Americans ’ retirement savings at year-end 2009. More than half of Americans ’ retirement savings were held in DC plans and IRAs at year-end 2009. Mutual funds managed 51 percent of DC plan assets and 46 percent of IRA assets. How ICI Measures U. S. Retirement Assets Given the importance of retirement savings to mutual funds 1 and their investors, 2 the Investment Company Institute (ICI) publishes statistics on the U. S. retirement market every quarter as an information resource for mutual fund companies, the media, policymakers, and researchers. ICI combines data from its own mutual fund survey database, 3, 4 and from other trade associations with data from the U. S. Departmen...|$|E
50|$|In 2016 the European Commission {{assessed}} that European Union's nuclear decommissioning liabilities {{were seriously}} underfunded by about 118 billion euros, with only 150 billion euros of <b>earmarked</b> <b>assets</b> to cover 268 billion euros of expected decommissioning costs covering both dismantling of nuclear plants and storage of radioactive parts and waste.

5000|$|Achieving {{these goals}} {{requires}} projecting {{what they will}} cost, and when one needs to withdraw funds. A major risk to the household in achieving their accumulation goal is the rate of price increases over time, or inflation. Using net present value calculators, the financial planner will suggest a combination of <b>asset</b> <b>earmarking</b> and regular savings to be invested {{in a variety of}} investments. In order to overcome the rate of inflation, the investment portfolio has to get a higher rate of return, which typically will subject the portfolio to a number of risks. Managing these portfolio risks is most often accomplished using asset allocation, which seeks to diversify investment risk and opportunity. This asset allocation will prescribe a percentage allocation to be invested in stocks, bonds, cash and alternative investments. The allocation should also take into consideration the personal risk profile of every investor, since risk attitudes vary from person to person.|$|R

5000|$|Investment and {{accumulation}} goals: planning how {{to accumulate}} enough money - for large purchases and life events - {{is what most}} people consider to be financial planning.

50|$|In 2016, Reuters {{reported}} that the European Commission estimated that the EU's nuclear decommissioning liabilities were seriously underfunded by about 118 billion euros, with only 150 billion euros of <b>earmarked</b> <b>assets</b> to cover 268 billion euros of expected decommissioning costs covering both dismantling of nuclear plants and storage of radioactive parts and waste. Among EU member states still operating nuclear plants, only Britain's operators have enough dedicated assets to cover the expected costs, 63 billion euros, the Commission's draft working paper finds. France had the largest shortfall with only 23 billion euros of <b>earmarked</b> <b>assets</b> to cover 74 billion euros of expected costs, while a stress test carried out by Germany’s Economy Ministry late last year showed the provisions made by the country’s utilities - E.ON, RWE, EnBW and Vattenfall VATN.UL - were adequate. Decommissioning costs vary according to reactor type and size, location, the proximity and availability of disposal facilities, the intended future use of the site and {{the condition of the}} reactor at the time of decommissioning. Although decommissioning might gradually become cheaper, the cost of final waste depositories is largely unknown and costs could also grow, rather than shrink, over the many decades in question. The European Commission declined to comment on an unpublished document and has not confirmed when the report will be officially published.|$|R
30|$|In this vein, the {{investigation}} of the new approaches contributes to the RBV. As mentioned in the introduction, the RBV is divided into resources and capabilities where resources are the ‘stock of available factors’ and capabilities are the ‘capacity to deploy resources […] using organizational processes, to effect a desired end’ (p. 35). However, three of eight concepts remain low in taxonomy without any organizational process or systematic approach and four of eight are rather in the beginning of becoming systematic. The complex R&D top-down approach is replaced by a simple bottom-up approach through the combination of <b>earmarked</b> <b>assets.</b> Even though that it sounds trivial, the bottom-up approach creates marketable product solutions at a low cost level that usual market participants, i.e. foreign companies, could not reach. Hence, these concepts complement the RBV by adding ecological aspects as resources, i.e., the reintegration of obsolete resources/former technologies of other companies as replacement of missing (own) resources without additional costs. Another aspect is the setting of the civil society, here people at the BoP, as strategic industry factor. In a nutshell, the new approaches complement the RBV by considering the civil society as strategic industry factor as well as using obsolete resources by dint of the reintegration which is missed in the traditional RBV.|$|R
