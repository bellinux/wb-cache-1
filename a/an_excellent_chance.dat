5|$|In 1990, Wilkinson's wife, Martha, {{announced}} that she would seek the Democratic gubernatorial nomination in 1991. The move was widely seen as a surrogate candidacy so that her husband could continue his administration for a second consecutive term. Her challengers included Lieutenant Governor Jones, Lexington mayor Scotty Baesler, and Dr. Floyd G. Poore, the former Kentucky highway director. With polls consistently showing little support for her candidacy, Mrs. Wilkinson {{dropped out of the}} race in May 1991. Earlier in the year, Wallace Wilkinson was diagnosed with limited-stage Non-Hodgkin lymphoma. This diagnosis was also a factor in Ms. Wilkinson's withdrawal from the race. Wallace underwent surgery at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, then received radiation therapy at the University of Kentucky. These treatments eliminated all signs of the disease by 1993, and doctors gave Wilkinson <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> <b>chance</b> of recovery.|$|E

Celtic were drawn against Real Madrid, and goals from George McCluskey and Johnny Doyle gave Celtic a 2–0 win in the first leg at Parkhead. Goalkeeper Peter Latchford had an {{excellent}} match, and in particular his saves from England striker Laurie Cunningham and Spanish star Santillana were crucial in helping Celtic keep a clean sheet. The return leg took place two weeks later at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium in front of approximately 120,000 fans. Johnny Doyle missed <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> <b>chance</b> to score early in the first half, and then just before half-time Santillana pulled a goal back for Real.

5000|$|White's 3.Nxe5 is {{the main}} line. After the usual 3...Qf6, White chooses between 4.d4 d6 5.Nc4 fxe4 and the {{immediate}} 4.Nc4, which {{has the advantage of}} allowing White to open the center with d3, for example 4...fxe4 5.Nc3 Qg6?! 6.d3 exd3? 7.Bxd3 Qxg2? and now White is winning after 8.Qh5+ Kd8 (or 8...g6 9.Qe5+ and 10.Be4) 9.Be4. However, if 6... Bb4, white must be careful following the same line, e.g. 7. Bd2 exd3 8. Bxd3 Qxg2 9. Qh5+ Kd8 10. Be4 Nf6! because now if white plays Bg5, which would be necessary to win the queen in the earlier line, then Bxc3+ wins for black. The main line continues 5...Qf7 6.Ne3! Black usually responds with 6...c6!?, when White can either accept the pawn sacrifice with 7.Nxe4 d5 8.Ng5 Qf6 9.Nf3, or decline it with the more popular 7.d3 exd3 8.Bxd3 d5 9.0-0. The latter variation has been deeply analysed; the British Grandmaster Anthony Kosten analyses one line to move 32. One line discussed by International Master Jeremy Silman is 9...Bc5 10.Na4 Bd6 11.c4 d4 12.Nc2 c5 13.b4 Ne7 14.Nxc5 Bxc5 15.bxc5 Nbc6 16.Bb2 0-0 17.Nxd4 Nxd4 18.Bxd4 Bf5 19.Bxf5 Nxf5 20.Be3 Qxc4 21.Qb3 Nxe3!? 22.fxe3 Rxf1+ 23.Rxf1 Qxb3 24.axb3 Rc8 25.Rf5 and now 25...Rd8 or 25...Rc6 gives Black <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> <b>chances</b> to draw the pawn-down endgame.

The devastating African drought in 1984-1985 demonstrated that camel ownership can give pastoralists a competitive edge and <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> <b>chance</b> for survival.

25|$|Ledley {{scored in}} the first match of the 2006–07 season, the opener in a 2–1 win over Barnsley. He then scored several weeks later, as Cardiff City beat fellow {{promotion}} contenders Birmingham City, 2–0, to move top of the table. At this match Cardiff City had a full stadium, 20,000 fans, {{for the first time}} in over 45 years. This signalled their growing momentum in the league and the belief within the club that they were able to get promoted. Ledley was identified as one of the key players in Cardiff City's team, his pace on the left wing being vital to their tenacious style of play. On 25 September, Ledley scored in a 3–0 win over Southend United to confirm Cardiff's status as early season favourites. Cardiff entered the FA Cup at the third round and drew Tottenham Hotspur. The match ended 0–0 but Ledley had <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> <b>chance</b> to put Cardiff City in the lead after 55 miuntes, he got on the end of a cross but hit his shot just over the bar. The match went to a replay and Tottenham Hotspur won 4–0 at White Hart Lane on 17 January. On 2 February Ledley suffered a hamstring injury in a 2–0 win over Barnsley. At the end of the season he picked up the Football League goal of the season award for his strike against Barnsley.|$|E
25|$|The Whalers went to {{the playoffs}} for the final time in 1992 behind Jimmy Roberts' coaching, but faced the heavily-favored Montreal Canadiens in the Adams Division Semi-finals. The Whalers lost Game 1 by a score of 2–0 and Game 2 by a score of 5–2, {{creating}} the expectation that the Canadiens would sweep the Whalers out of the first round, {{as they did in the}} 1989 playoffs. However, the Whalers came back home to win Games 3 and 4 by scores of 5–2 and 3–1, respectively. The main turning point in the series came in the second period of Game 5 — the Whalers had a 3–1 lead midway through the second period, where the Canadiens began rushing the crease and getting in the face of Whalers goaltender Frank Pietrangelo to distract him. The strategy worked, as the Canadiens scored four unanswered goals in the final five minutes of the second period. These goals were not called back, since this was before the time when the NHL began strictly enforcing crease infractions on goals. The Whalers lost Game 5 by a score of 7–4. The Whalers came back to win Game 6 by a score of 2–1 just 24 seconds into overtime on a goal by Yvon Corriveau. The series went back to Montreal for game 7 and the Whalers lost a dramatic double overtime game by a score of 3–2, as Russ Courtnall scored on a turn-around shot against Pietrangelo. Corriveau had <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> <b>chance</b> for a second consecutive overtime winner in the first overtime period on a breakaway, but his shot missed the net.|$|E

In addition to important goals scored against Atromitos and Borussia Mönchengladbach, Duljević also developed a habit of scoring goals against difficult rivals in the Premier league. He netted the first goal of the game in the 3-1 win over Borac in Banja Luka (Sarajevo rarely wins there), and he also decided the biggest game there is in Bosnian football. Coming off the bench, Duljević scored a game-winning goal against city rivals Željezničar away from home. Even though he was supposed to be celebrated as a hero for his side, he was actually stripped of his wages for that week because of missing <b>a</b> host of <b>excellent</b> <b>chances</b> to completely humiliate the city rivals.

25|$|In 1964–65 Hearts fought out a {{championship}} title race with Waddell's Kilmarnock. In {{the era of}} two points for a win Hearts were three points clear with two games remaining. Hearts drew with Dundee United meaning the last {{game of the season}} with the two title challengers playing each other at Tynecastle would be a league decider. Kilmarnock needed to win by a two-goal margin to take the title. Hearts entered the game as favourites with both a statistical and home advantage. They also had a solid pedigree of trophy winning under Walker. Waddell's Kilmarnock in contrast had been nearly men. Four times in the previous five seasons they had finished league runners-up including Hearts’ triumph in 1960. Killie had also lost three domestic cup finals during the same period including the 1962 League Cup Final defeat to Hearts. Hearts had won five of the six senior cup finals they played in under Walker. Even the final they had lost was in a replay after drawing the first game. Hearts' Roald Jensen hit the post after six minutes. Kilmarnock then scored twice through Davie Sneddon and Brian McIlroy after 27 and 29 minutes. Alan Gordon had <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> <b>chance</b> to clinch the title for Hearts in second half injury time but was denied by a Bobby Ferguson diving save pushing the ball past the post. The 2–0 defeat meant Hearts lost the title by an average of 0.042 goals. Subsequently, Hearts were instrumental in pushing through a change to use goal difference to separate teams level on points. Ironically this rule change later denied Hearts the title in 1985–86.|$|E

Former National winner Neale Doughty took the mount on Gala's Image which started at 18/1 with the 1988 Lord Mildmay of Fleet winner, Smart Tar. Last year's third placed Monanore was considered <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> each-way <b>chance</b> at 20/1 [...] while fifth placed Attitude Adjuster started at the longer odds of 25/1 with Bob Tisdall and Gainsay, the latter of which being owned by Errol Brown, {{better known as the}} lead singer of the popular 1970s and 1980s pop group, Hot Chocolate. Little Polveir was allowed to go off at the modest odds of 28/1, despite having won the Scottish Grand National in 1987.

Jimmy Frost took the mount as his debut ride in the race with many newspaper tipsters suggesting that the pair would part company during the race. Frost kept Little Polveir among the leading dozen on the first circuit, moving up to take the lead as the field jumped the water at the end of the first circuit. They were never again headed and after the fall of Smart Tar at the twenty-first fence, maintained a lead of at least three lengths for the rest of the race.|$|R

Goalkeeper Romuald Peiser guessed correctly, but Ramirez found the top right corner of the net to open the scoring in the 7th minute. Ottawa pushed back as the half wore on, earning the majority of scoring opportunities but the score remained 1-0 United {{at the end of the}} half. The Fury broke through shortly after the restart as Heinemann found space just inside the Minnesota box and fired a low shot which Ndjock was able to get a hand to, but could not keep out. Ottawa again had most of the scoring chances in the second half, including a shot by Andrew Wiedeman which went off the left-hand post and out in the 62nd minute. The Loons also had <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> scoring <b>chance</b> in the 80th minute as Christian Ramirez nearly converted a cross from Justin Davis and was stopped only by Ottawa defender Mason Trafford. The score would remain level at the end of 90 minutes and the match would have to be decided in extra time. After the start of the second half of extra time, Heinemann would again find the back of the net in the 108th minute after receiving a long ball forward by Fury midfielder Siniša Ubiparipović.
