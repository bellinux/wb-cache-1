5|$|Due to {{the large}} masses of the W bosons, {{particle}} transformations or decays (e.g., flavour change) that depend on the weak interaction typically occur much more slowly than transformations or decays that depend only on the strong or electromagnetic forces. For example, <b>a</b> <b>neutral</b> pion decays electromagnetically, and so has a life of only about 10−16seconds. In contrast, a charged pion can only decay through the weak interaction, and so lives about 10−8seconds, or a hundred million times longer than <b>a</b> <b>neutral</b> pion. A particularly extreme example is the weak-force decay of a free neutron, which takes about 15minutes.|$|E
5|$|Grosz later {{testified that}} Brand's mission {{had been a}} cover for his own.

5|$|In 1992, the NHL {{expanded}} {{the season to}} 84 games, and each team played two games at <b>a</b> <b>neutral</b> site. After the 1995 lockout, the neutral site games were eliminated, and the season was reduced to 82 games.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 1950s, the US {{worked for the}} {{rearmament}} of West Germany and, in 1955, secured its full membership of NATO. In May 1953, Beria, by then in a government post, had made an unsuccessful proposal to allow the reunification of <b>a</b> <b>neutral</b> Germany to prevent West Germany's incorporation into NATO.|$|E
5|$|Navy {{dominated}} the series early {{by winning the}} first eight games, between 1905 and 1930, which remains the longest streak. Maryland secured its first win in 1931 at <b>a</b> <b>neutral</b> site in Washington, D.C. After two more meetings, the series was suspended in 1934 when the Maryland administration protested a play.|$|E

5|$|Systematic {{screening}} of traditional Chinese medical herbs {{was carried out}} by Chinese research teams, consisting of hundreds of scientists in the 1960s and 1970s.

5|$|The final was to {{be played}} at the Heysel Stadium in Brussels, Belgium. Liverpool had objected to the choice of venue as they were {{concerned}} about the condition of the stadium, which was crumbling, and the decision to allocate <b>a</b> <b>neutral</b> section for Belgian fans.|$|E
5|$|While {{some wild}} {{narcissi}} are specific {{in terms of}} their ecological requirements, most garden varieties are relatively tolerant of soil conditions, however very wet soils and clay soils may benefit from the addition of sand to improve drainage.

50|$|True Neutrals are not {{considered}} friendly to anyone. If any power attacks <b>a</b> True <b>Neutral,</b> every other True Neutral becomes friendly to the other side. For example, if the UK attacks the True Neutral Sweden, every other True <b>Neutral</b> becomes <b>a</b> Pro-Axis <b>Neutral.</b>|$|R

50|$|In {{economics}} and finance, risk neutral preferences are neither risk averse nor risk seeking. <b>A</b> risk <b>neutral</b> party's decisions are {{not affected by}} the degree of uncertainty {{in a set of}} outcomes, so <b>a</b> risk <b>neutral</b> party is indifferent between choices with equal expected payoffs even if one choice is riskier. For example, if offered either $50 or a 50% chance each of $100 and $0, <b>a</b> risk <b>neutral</b> person would have no preference. In contrast, a risk averse person would prefer the first offer, while a risk seeking person would prefer the second.|$|R
5|$|After World War I, Puerto Ricans {{fought on}} foreign shores {{as members of}} the United States Marine Corps. Civil war broke out in Nicaragua during the first months of 1926, and upon the request of the Nicaraguan government, 3,000 U.S. Marines were sent ashore to {{establish}} <b>a</b> <b>neutral</b> zone for the protection of American citizens. The American intervention was also known as the Banana Wars. Both Captain Pedro del Valle and Private Rafel Toro from Puerto Rico, participated in the Second Nicaraguan Campaign.|$|E
5|$|After {{a year of}} negotiation, Tiberius led {{a sizable}} force into Armenia, presumably {{with the goal of}} {{establishing}} it as a Roman client-state and ending the threat it posed on the Roman-Parthian border.

5|$|Although the U.S. {{command in}} Saigon and the {{politicians}} in Washington became increasingly aware of this arrangement during 19661967, they declined to overtly interfere due to the political ramifications of conducting military operations against <b>a</b> <b>neutral</b> country and the wishes of Sihanouk. Washington still had hopes of reopening a dialog with Sihanouk, and refrained from any actions that might alienate him further.|$|E

5|$|At Super Bowl XLVIII, Thunder led {{the team}} onto the field {{at the start of}} the game, making it the first Super Bowl where he was allowed to do so. Thunder was also allowed to run in the end zone after a touchdown, but because MetLife Stadium was {{considered}} <b>a</b> <b>neutral</b> zone for both teams, he was not allowed to run the length of the field.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of World War II, the United States was <b>a</b> <b>neutral</b> party {{just as it was}} at {{the beginning}} of World War I.

Ten of the 464 men who received the Medal of Honor for action in World War II were educated at USMA.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the 1998 season, CONMEBOL {{discontinued}} the Supercopa Sudamericana.

However, the introduction of the new Copa Sudamericana revitalized the competition with Olimpia winning the 2003 final in Los Angeles. Played on <b>a</b> <b>neutral</b> venue {{for the second year in}} a row, Cienciano defeated Boca Juniors on penalties to win their second international title. From 2005 onwards, the Recopa Sudamericana would be played on a home-and-away basis.|$|E
