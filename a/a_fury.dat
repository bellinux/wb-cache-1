5|$|A {{video game}} {{set in the}} Mad Max {{universe}} was mentioned by franchise creator George Miller in a 2008 interview. Miller joined God of War II director Cory Barlog to develop the game after Barlog left Sony Computer Entertainment. The project was originally intended as a tie-in with a Mad Max animated film which would be released simultaneously. The film's production was suspended to allow adequate production time for the game. After Barlog announced in 2008 that a publisher for the game was being sought, no further information about the project was forthcoming. In 2010, Barlog was a consultant for Avalanche Studios, leaving in 2012 for Crystal Dynamics. <b>A</b> <b>Fury</b> Road tie-in video game was in development by Interplay Entertainment, but was scrapped when Electronic Arts acquired the franchise's video-game rights for $20 million.|$|E
5|$|In Armida's palace garden, Almirena mourns her captivity. Argante joins her and, {{overcome}} by her beauty, confesses {{that he now}} loves her. He promises that as proof of his feelings he will defy Armida's wrath and secure Almirena's freedom. Meanwhile, Rinaldo is brought before the triumphant Armida. As he demands that Almirena be set free, Armida finds herself drawn to his noble spirit, and declares her love. When he angrily rejects her she uses her powers to assume Almirena's form, but Rinaldo suspects trickery, and departs. Armida, resuming her own appearance, is furious at her rejection yet retains feelings of tender love. She decides on another attempt to ensnare Rinaldo, and transforms herself back into Almirena's shape, but then encounters Argante. Believing her to be Almirena, Argante repeats his earlier promises of love and freedom. Swiftly resuming her own form, Armida denounces his infidelity and vows vengeance. Argante defiantly confirms his love for Almirena and declares {{that he no longer}} needs Armida's help. She departs in <b>a</b> <b>fury.</b>|$|E
5|$|Afterward, Andy grows {{determined}} {{to escape from}} Shawshank, and informs Red {{that he is going}} to Zihuatanejo in Mexico, telling him that if he should ever get out of prison, he should go to a hayfield in Buxton, Maine, and there will be a volcanic rock, and a gift for him under it. During an inspection the next day, Andy has disappeared without a trace. In <b>a</b> <b>fury,</b> Norton throws one of Andy's rocks at a suggestive poster of David Cassidy on the wall of Andy's cell, tearing a hole through Cassidy's rectum. Norton then pulls the poster off, discovering a tunnel that Andy had made his escape through the night before. Andy is then shown breaking into a sewage pipe while Norton is distracted by watching an episode of Friends, allowing him to crawl out to freedom. Sometime later, Red is brought before a parole board and complains that the concept of rehabilitation is just a way for the board members to make themselves feel important, and declares he will start killing people as soon as he is released; for no apparent reason, Red is put on parole anyway and released from Shawshank. Red goes to the field in Buxton with the volcanic rock to fulfill his promise to Andy, finding a box beneath the rock containing money and a postcard asking if he remembers the name of the Mexican village Andy told him about; unfortunately, to Red's annoyance, he does not. Andy is then shown preparing a boat on a beach in Zihuatanejo, eagerly waiting for Red to arrive, though Red never does.|$|E

25|$|The news of {{the victory}} itself was met with jubilation at Athens. Their joy was tempered, however, by the {{aftermath}} of the battle, in which a storm prevented the ships assigned to rescue the survivors of the 25 disabled or sunken Athenian triremes from performing their duties, and a great number of sailors drowned. <b>A</b> <b>fury</b> erupted at Athens when the public learned of this, and after a bitter struggle in the assembly six of the eight generals who had commanded the fleet were tried as a group and executed.|$|E

The Aero Asia started its aerial operations on 4 May 1993. The Aero Asia made a promising start after employing former managerial and corporate staff of Pakistan International Airlines, and hired <b>a</b> <b>fury</b> of former pilots of the PAF and the Navy. On immediate basis, the Aero Asia's corporate contracted two Romanian Airlines aircraft for wet-lease and lease-purchase of BAC 1-11 aircraft. Operations were started with wet-leased BAC 1-11 aircraft from the VIP fleet of Romania operated by Romanian Airlines, a sister company of the Romanian Air Force.|$|E
25|$|However, Sonia's arrest {{proved to}} be a red herring and it was later {{revealed}} that the killing blow had actually come from Pauline's husband Joe, who broke down and confessed to Dot Branning that he had rowed with Pauline on Christmas Day (off-screen) and, in <b>a</b> <b>fury,</b> struck her across the head with a frying pan, causing a brain haemorrhage that claimed her life. The plot's eventual climax in February 2007 led to the exits of several established characters connected with Pauline. This included Martin, Sonia and Joe, who was dramatically killed off after confessing to Pauline's murder—he fell out of the Fowlers' first floor window while trying to apprehend a hysterical Dot.|$|E
25|$|Everything is at last revealed, and Oedipus curses {{himself and}} fate {{before leaving the}} stage. The chorus laments how even a great man can be felled by fate, and {{following}} this, a servant exits the palace to speak {{of what has happened}} inside. When Jocasta enters the house, she runs to the palace bedroom and hangs herself there. Shortly afterward, Oedipus enters in <b>a</b> <b>fury,</b> calling on his servants to bring him a sword so that he might cut out his mother's womb. He then rages through the house, until he comes upon Jocasta's body. Giving a cry, Oedipus takes her down and removes the long gold pins that held her dress together, before plunging them into his own eyes in despair.|$|E

5|$|On 29 January 1951, Sydney {{was part}} of an eighteen-ship fleet present in Sydney Harbour to {{celebrate}} the 50th anniversary of Australia's Federation. Following this, the carrier joined a multinational training exercise in south-east Australian waters, then visited Hobart for the Royal Hobart Regatta. During the exercise, <b>a</b> Sea <b>Fury</b> accidentally fired four practice rockets into the superstructure of the New Zealand flagship, : although an inquiry concluded that the pilot had unintentionally pressed the fire button, it was later found that certain signal frequencies transmitted by Sydneys radio aerials could trigger <b>a</b> <b>Fury's</b> firing circuits. Sydney was presented with the Gloucester Cup in April 1951, recognising her as the most efficient ship in the RAN for 1950. The two CAGs were switched over in April, and on 3 May, <b>a</b> Sea <b>Fury</b> crashed during <b>a</b> rocket-assisted take off; the pilot became the carrier's first fatality.|$|R

25|$|The {{clearing}} of {{the city}} buildings by Sumner's infantry and by artillery fire from across the river began the first major urban combat of the war. Union gunners sent more than 5,000 shells against {{the town and the}} ridges to the west. By nightfall, four brigades of Union troops occupied the town, which they looted with <b>a</b> <b>fury</b> that had not been seen in the war up to that point. This behavior enraged Lee, who compared their depredations with those of the ancient Vandals. The destruction also angered the Confederate troops, many of whom were native Virginians. Many on the Union side were also shocked by the destruction inflicted on Fredericksburg. Civilian casualties were unusually sparse in the midst of such widespread violence; George Rable estimates no more than four civilian deaths.|$|E
25|$|Madeleine's body {{is found}} by her blind {{mother and the}} Abbé in the laundry vat. The Abbé is devastated by Madeleine's death and Bouchon is {{captured}} and imprisoned inside an iron dummy. The Abbé blames the Marquis for Madeleine's death and prods him into <b>a</b> <b>fury.</b> The Marquis claims he had been with Madeleine in every way imaginable, {{only to be told}} she had died a virgin. The Abbé has the Marquis' tongue cut out as punishment for his involvement, but is riddled with remorse and physically punishes himself. The Abbé then has a dream in which Madeleine comes alive and they have sex, but ultimately it ends with him holding her corpse. The Marquis' health declines severely, but he remains perverse as ever, decorating his dungeon with a story, using faeces as ink. As the Marquis lies dying, the Abbé reads him the last rites and offers him a crucifix to kiss. The Marquis defiantly swallows the crucifix and chokes to death on it.|$|E
25|$|Belle {{has learned}} that the monster that took Robin was <b>a</b> <b>Fury.</b> Someone had used magic in Camelot to save Robin and did not pay the price, which is a life, and the monster has arrived to collect Robin's soul as payment. It {{will return to the}} Underworld when the moon reaches its zenith, but can be stopped if someone gives their life in his place. Regina confronts Emma, believing that she had summoned the Fury, but Emma reveals that Regina was the one {{responsible}} for its appearance. That night near the pond, the Fury begins pulling out Robin's soul, and Charon the boatman appears as the moon reaches its zenith. Regina sacrifices herself for Robin, and is joined by Mary Margaret, David, Leroy and Arthur. As all five band together, they successfully pull Robin from the Fury (and since the price of a single soul was equally divided among them), which disappears back into the underworld with Charon. While everyone celebrates this latest victory at Granny's, a worried Mary Margaret notes that if they win, Emma will lose. At Granny's, Henry introduces himself to Violet again and shows her what a jukebox is, and plays the same song he had played in Camelot, which, somehow, seems familiar to her. At her house, Emma opens the locked door and goes downstairs, at the behest of Rumplestiltskin's manifestation, revealing the stone with the sword Excalibur in it. Rumplestiltskin, the manifestation of her darkness, says that she can make it whole again and use it to vanquish all of the light forever. Emma tries to pull the sword from the stone but fails, being repelled by the sword's magic. After this failed attempt, the Dark One taunts her, and tells her that in order to complete the task, she will have to pay the price, and it will cost someone dearly.|$|E

Pregnant at the time, Anne descended on Stirling with a force of [...] "well-supported" [...] nobles, intent on removing the nine-year-old Henry, whom she had hardly seen for five years; but Mar's mother and brother would allow her to bring no more than two attendants with her into the castle. The obduracy of Henry's keepers sent Anne into such <b>a</b> <b>fury</b> that she suffered another miscarriage: according to David Calderwood, she [...] "went to bed in anger and parted with child the tenth of May." ...|$|E
500|$|In Doctor Who Magazine, Graham Kibble-White {{gave it a}} {{positive}} review, describing it as [...] "zestful and exciting Doctor Who."

He noted that [...] "there's something pointless but pleasing in having Clara's charge, Artie, reading Summer Falls–a book written by Amelia Williams". Additionally, he described the Spoonheads as [...] "a very effective threat, albeit written {{as one of the}} foot soldiers of the Doctor Who world, with only the verbal facility to paraphrase back what's been said," [...] and stated that [...] "the revelation of the concave absence {{at the back of the}} skull is horrific." [...] However, he complained that to him, Clara's guess that the TARDIS was a [...] "snogging booth" [...] seemed like [...] "something a 13-year-old boy would conjure, not a 24-year-old woman".|$|E
500|$|Constantine sent Galerius an {{official}} notice of Constantius's death {{and his own}} acclamation. Along with the notice, he included a portrait of himself in the robes of an Augustus. The portrait was wreathed in bay. He requested recognition as heir to his father's throne, and passed off responsibility for his unlawful ascension on his army, claiming they had [...] "forced it upon him". Galerius was put into <b>a</b> <b>fury</b> by the message; he almost set the portrait on fire. His advisers calmed him, and argued that outright denial of Constantine's claims would mean certain war. Galerius was compelled to compromise: he granted Constantine the title [...] "Caesar" [...] rather than [...] "Augustus" [...] (the latter office went to Severus instead). Wishing {{to make it clear}} that he alone gave Constantine legitimacy, Galerius personally sent Constantine the emperor's traditional purple robes. Constantine accepted the decision, knowing that it would remove doubts as to his legitimacy.|$|E

500|$|The {{first session}} of the Ogle County Commissioners' Court took place on January 3, 1837, after the city of Oregon was picked as the county seat. The first {{courthouse}} was completed in 1840-1841, but it never saw use. The 1840-41 courthouse was constructed {{at a cost of}} $4,000, partially in response to [...] "a gang of villains" [...] harassing citizens. On March 21, 1841, the night before court convened in its new building, the bandits allegedly set the courthouse on fire, completely destroying it. The town, whipped into <b>a</b> <b>fury</b> by horse whipping and thievery and, even murder, later formed a band of [...] "Regulators" [...] to hunt down and bring the bandits to justice.
