Adoption of improved cultivars is a necessary precondition for plant breeding creating favorable impacts on farm households. Impacts may be obtained through yield increases, quality improvement, reduction in unit cost of production and reduced production risks. This chapter is a compilation {{of information about the}} level of adoption of improved sorghum cultivars and factors influencing it. Adoption of improved sorghum cultivars was measured as a percentage of improved sorghum area in the total sorghum area.

40|$|The serious water {{scarcity}} and groundwater over-exploitation {{problems of the}} North China Plain (NCP) have aroused worldwide concerns. Achieving a reduction in agricultural water use is critical, because agriculture is the largest water consumer in the NCP. New solutions to these problems may lie in changes in the <b>area</b> <b>sown</b> <b>to</b> winter wheat across the NCP. In this study, the water footprint (WF) was applied as an aggregative indicator to evaluate {{the impact of the}} changing <b>area</b> <b>sown</b> <b>to</b> winter wheat. A Chinese version of the AEZ model, the China-AEZ model, was used for the evaluation. The results showed: (1) Green water plays a more significant role in winter wheat production {{in the southern part of}} the NCP than in the north; about a half of the water requirements for winter wheat are met by green water in the southern part of the NCP, compared to only a third in the north. (2) As a result of the north-south shift in the <b>area</b> <b>sown</b> <b>to</b> winter wheat during the period 1998 - 2011, the WF, the green water footprint (WFgreen) and the surface water footprint (WFblues) for winter wheat increased, respectively, by 459 X 10 (6) m(3) yr(- 1) (0. 9 %), by 973 x 10 (6) m(3) yr(- 1) (4. 2 %) and by 47 X 106 m(3) yr(- 1) (0. 5 %), whereas the groundwater footprint (WFblueg) diminished by 561 x 10 (6) m(3) yr(- 1) (3. 4 %). The contribution of green water also increased, from 46. 3 % in 1998 to 47. 8 % in 2011, concurrent with the changes in the <b>area</b> <b>sown</b> <b>to</b> winter wheat. (3) The Hebei Plain, in the northern part of the NCP, conserved 1856 X 10 (6) m(3) yr(- 1) of blue water footprint (Whim) for winter wheat during the period 1998 - 2011, equivalent to about one third of the total amount of water supplied by the Middle Route of the South-to-North Water Transfer Project (MRP) in 2010. By comparison, WF and its components all increased in the southern provinces of the NCP. The diminishing requirement for groundwater and the increasing role of green water in winter wheat production encourage policies aimed at the further optimization of agricultural land use and the achievement of integrated blue-green water management in the NCP.

40|$|In {{irrigated}} cropping, as {{with any}} other industry, profit and risk are inter-dependent. An increase in profit would normally coincide {{with an increase in}} risk, and this means that risk can be traded for profit. It is desirable to manage a farm so that it achieves the maximum possible profit for the desired level of risk. This paper identifies risk-efficient cropping strategies that allocate land and water between crop enterprises for a case study of an irrigated farm in Southern Queensland, Australia. This is achieved by applying stochastic frontier analysis to the output of a simulation experiment. The simulation experiment involved changes to the levels of business risk by systematically varying the crop sowing rules in a bioeconomic model of the case study farm. This model utilises the multi-field capability of the process based Agricultural Production System Simulator (APSIM) and is parameterised using data collected from interviews with a collaborating farmer. We found sowing rules that increased the farm <b>area</b> <b>sown</b> <b>to</b> cotton caused the greatest increase in risk-efficiency. Increasing maize area also improved risk-efficiency but to a lesser extent than cotton. Sowing rules that increased the <b>areas</b> <b>sown</b> <b>to</b> wheat reduced the risk-efficiency of the farm business. Sowing rules were identified that had the potential to improve the expected farm profit by ca. 50, 000 Annually, without significantly increasing risk.

The findings are reported of a study undertaken to describe the adoption and impact of Russian wheat aphid (RWA) resistant cultivars developed by the South African Agricultural Research Council. The analyses employed farm-level data from surveys conducted in 1997 in the Central and Eastern Free State of South Africa. Rapid adoption of the cultivars was demonstrated since their first release in 1993. The <b>area</b> <b>sown</b> <b>to</b> the cultivars increased from 3 % in 1993 to 46 % in 1997. Correlation and multiple regression analyses suggested that adoption of the cultivars {{was influenced by the}} farmer's educational level, wheat area, and experience with RWA; the quality grades realized by resistant cultivars; and the combined weighted average yield of resistant and susceptible cultivars.

Our intention was to utilize these principles on a site-specific basis through an associated probabilistic framework to identify the likelihood that grain yield was limited by N supply. Yield and protein data were taken at harvest from sorghum, wheat and barley crops near Dalby, southern Queensland, in 1999. Considerable variation was found in grain yield for the 3 crops, but less so for grain protein. Frequency-response relationships, derived from historical multiple N field experiments, were applied to identify areas where grain yield was limited by N supply. This approach {{indicated that there was}} a 60 % or higher likelihood that plant-available N was yield-limiting for 17, 23, and 26 % of the <b>area</b> <b>sown</b> <b>to</b> sorghum, wheat and barley, respectively.

Calculation of N removal and N supply, using N transfer efficiency relationships, verified that those areas with a high likelihood of response to N had considerably lower supplies of N compared to other areas. The application of probability analysis offers a unique strategy to identify within-field areas where N supply could be yield-limiting, and provides a rationale for predicting the spatial variation and likely range of N supplies for successive seasons...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the major}} {{agricultural}} innovations on the Canadian Prairies over the last 40 {{years has been the}} introduction of conservation tillage (CT). Conservation tillage-a system that includes minimum and zero tillage (ZT) -was introduced as an alternative to traditional (conventional) tillage (TT) to control soil degradation and to promote agricultural sustainability. The development and adoption of CT systems involved pioneer farmers, engineers, scientists, and farmer associations. By the end of the 1970 s, CT started to take shape on the Prairies, but for a number of economic, technical, political and social reasons, the adoption of CT did not occur on any major scale before the 1990 s. Today, more than 75 % of the Prairie's cropland is under some form of CT with more than 50 % under ZT. In this paper, the factors behind the development and adoption of conservation tillage technology on the Prairies in the period between 1930 and 2011 are reviewed. Then, some of the benefits of the adoption of CT on the Prairies are highlighted.

Linear trend lines were fitted to data from six major wheat-growing states of India, namely, Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh for the ten-year period preceding 1964 - 65 and separately for the subsequent ten-year period. 22 % of the expansion in wheat acreage during the latter period could {{be accounted for by}} the reduction in the area of pulses. 8 % of the expansion in wheat was at the expense of winter rice and barley. The vast majority of the growth in the <b>area</b> <b>sown</b> <b>to</b> wheat in the six states was a result of increases in cropping intensities resulting from the HYVs, expansion in irrigation and an increase in net <b>sown</b> <b>areas.</b> Total trend foodgrain production in 1974 - 75 in the six states would have been 13. 4 % less had the HYVs of wheat not been introduced, taking into account the reduction in the production of pulses, winter rice, and barley, as well as the increased wheat production. Generally per caput reductions would have amounted to between one and two percentage points less than those figures. From a nutritional angle, the substitution of wheat for chickpea that occurred after the Green Revolution resulted not only in a vast increase in the production of energy from each hectare, but also of protein. The success of these wheats clearly illustrated how a plant breeding strategy which emphasized increased yield potential could result in significant improvements in aggregate nutritional well-being.

However, as less fertile and less physically stable soils were cropped for extended periods, farmers began to use contemporary farming and <b>sown</b> pasture technologies <b>to</b> rebuild and maintain their soils. This has typically involved sowing long-term grass and grass–legume pastures on the more marginal cropping soils of the region. In partnership with the catchment management authority, the Queensland Murray–Darling Committee (QMDC) and Landcare, a pasture extension process using the LeyGrain™ package was implemented in 2006 within two Grain & Graze projects in the Maranoa-Balonne and Border Rivers catchments in southern inland Queensland. The specific objectives were <b>to</b> increase the <b>area</b> <b>sown</b> <b>to</b> high quality pasture and to gain production and environmental benefits (particularly groundcover) through improving the skills of producers in pasture species selection, their understanding and management of risk during pasture establishment, and in managing pastures and the feed base better. The catalyst for increasing pasture sowings was a QMDC subsidy scheme for increasing groundcover on old cropping land. In recognising a need to enhance pasture knowledge and skills to implement this scheme, the QMDC and Landcare producer groups sought the involvement of, and set specific targets for, the LeyGrain workshop process. This is a highly interactive action learning process that built on the existing knowledge and skills of the producers. Thirty-four workshops were held with more than 200 producers in 26 existing groups and with private agronomists. An evaluation process assessed the impact of the workshops on the learning and skill development by participants, their commitment to practice change, and their future intent <b>to</b> <b>sow</b> pastures. The results across both project catchments were highly correlated. There was strong agreement by producers (> 90...|$|R
40|$|Understanding {{land use}} changes and their {{implications}} for grain production {{are important for}} the maintenance of food security. We analyzed changes in quantity and quality of cropland in the Huang-Huai-Hai Plain of China during the last 30 years and the implications for future grain production. Several categories of data were used, including long-term remote sensing images (1990 - 2005), spatial datasets of soil quality levels (1980 s), spatial datasets of irrigation area (2000), data from hydrological stations (1978 - 2003) and meteorological stations (1950 - 2007) and statistical datasets of grain production, grain yield, <b>area</b> <b>sown</b> <b>to</b> grain, fertilizer use and effective irrigation area (1978 - 2008). The results showed that annual grain production losses due to shrinkage of cropland area over the Huang-Huai-Hai Plain were 4. 30 and 2. 63 million tons during 1990 - 2000 and 2000 - 2005, respectively. The greatest decline in cropland area occurred {{as a result of the}} expansion of economically developed metropolises or in provinces with large areas of urbanization. Furthermore, more "above average" quality and irrigated cropland was abandoned, i. e. sacrificed to urbanization or other non-agricultural uses, than that obtained by reclamation. Conversion of fertile and irrigated land to non-agricultural uses due to rapid urbanization appears to be a potential threat to the food security of the Huang-Huai-Hai Plain - even the whole of China. Most of the increase of grain production in the Plain can be attributed to increase in yield per hectare, which was due to improvement of crop varieties, a similar to 400 % increase in fertilizer use and a similar to 20 % increase in effective irrigation area. Policies to optimize utilization of land resources to ensure the soil fertility of cropland and to maximize nitrogen and water use efficiency are required to sustain current grain production and to achieve further increases...|$|R
40|$|AS {{the world}} debates {{the costs and}} {{benefits}} of plant biotechnology, swinging between optimism generated by a long list of breakthroughs and pes-simism caused by a consumer backlash in some places, a new source of plant biotechnology discoveries is emerging in a most unlikely place: China. And the discoveries being made are more than cosmetic transformations. China’s research community has made a ma-jor investment into understanding the structure and function of the rice ge-nome, the use of agrobacterium to trans-form the rice plant, and new methods of transforming other crops, including a wide array of horticultural plants. China has one of the largest and most successful agricultural research systems in the developing world (Stone 1988). Historically, much of China’s research was focused on grain, and the government invested in re-search and development (R&D) as part of its pursuit of food self-sufficiency. Horticulture played only a small role in China’s development strategy. Economic growth, the rise of mar-kets and the opening up of China’s economy have resulted in a sharp shift in government policy and pro-ducer decision-making. As markets emerged in the 1990 s, farmers reduced their <b>area</b> <b>sown</b> <b>to</b> traditional grain and fiber crops and began to cultivate vast tracts of produce. Fruit and veg-etable area has nearly doubled in China, expanding by more than 20 million acres during the 1990 s, add-ing the equivalent of a “new California” every 3 years for the past 12 years. The Chinese re-search system has responded to the new demands. In the mid- 1990 s, top research administrators began allocating more funds to nontraditional crops. Research-ers, including those in a nascent private-sector seed company, were given more freedom to work on broader array of crops and provided with incentives to shift to horticultural crops. Research in modern plant biotech-nology began in the mid- 1980 s. Chi-nese scientists now apply advanced biotechnology tools to plant science, Chinese scientists now apply advanced biotechnology tools to plant science, reg-ularly working on the synthesis, isolation and cloning of new genes, and the genetic transfor-mations of plants...|$|R
40|$|In {{southern}} central Tibet, {{a network}} of valleys with intensive agriculture {{has been defined as}} Tibet’s ‘crop-dominated zone’. This chapter describes current systems of crop and livestock production in this zone, and considers possible ways to boost production. Most of Tibet’s 2. 7 million people live in this crop-dominated zone at altitudes between 3, 500 and 3, 900 m and on farms of 1 – 2 ha. Most of the grain and animal products from these farms is consumed on farm, and incomes are low (less than US$ 1 per adult per day). Winters are cold and dry but summer and autumn provide ideal conditions for crop growth, with plentiful sunlight and warmth, reliable rainfall and the potential to irrigate much of the land. Farming systems focus on the production of spring barley and winter wheat, with small <b>areas</b> <b>sown</b> <b>to</b> oilseed rape, pulses, winter barley and potatoes. Mechanisation is limited; most farmers plough using draught animals, and plant, harvest and thresh by hand. Typical grain yields are 2 – 3 t/ha for spring barley and 4 – 6 t/ha for winter wheat. The raising of livestock is also important with most valley-based farmers keeping two to six cattle tethered or corralled near the household. Cattle are fed diets based heavily on crop residues and weeds, but are generally malnourished, showing low growth rates, low milk production and high rates of mortality. It is suggested that research and extension in the areas of plant nutrition, weed control, seeding method and crop variety could help improve grain production, and that boosting cattle production will require better supply of good-quality fodder. Cereal/fodder intercrops or double crops sown using zero-till seeders are proposed here as strategies to enable the production of useful amounts of fodder without jeopardising food grain security. Programs to boost incomes and productivity on Tibetan farms need to involve farmers at every step, to ensure activities align with farmer priorities.
