Her music has been well received among conservative commentators {{and members of the}} Tea Party movement for its political message. The use of Branch's music in the campaigns of Cain and Santorum has been seen <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> its appeal among outsider candidates. She has released nine singles and an EP, and is working on her debut album for release in 2013.|$|E
5|$|Competition with {{fishermen}} {{also led}} to killer whales being regarded as pests. In {{the waters of the}} Pacific Northwest and Iceland, the shooting of killer whales was accepted and even encouraged by governments. <b>As</b> <b>an</b> <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> the intensity of shooting that occurred until fairly recently, about 25% of the killer whales captured in Puget Sound for aquarium through 1970 bore bullet scars. The U.S. Navy claimed to have deliberately killed hundreds of killer whales in Icelandic waters in 1956 with machine-guns, rockets, and depth charges.|$|E
5|$|Interest in {{the risk}} parity {{approach}} has increased since the late 2000s financial crisis as the risk parity approach fared better than traditionally constructed portfolios, {{as well as many}} hedge funds. Some portfolio managers have expressed skepticism about the practical application of the concept and its effectiveness in all types of market conditions but others point to its performance during the financial crisis of 2007-2008 <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> its potential success.|$|E

5|$|Rainivoninahitriniony's {{tenure as}} sole Prime Minister was short lived. His violent tendencies, {{irritability}} and insolence toward Rasoherina, {{in addition to}} lingering popular resentment over Rainivoninahitriniony's role in the violent end to Radama's rule, gradually turned {{the opinion of the}} nobles against him. As Commander-in-Chief, Rainilaiarivony attempted to counsel his brother, while simultaneously overseeing diplomatic and military efforts to re-pacify the agitated Sakalava and other peoples, who viewed the coup <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> weakening Merina control. The Prime Minister repaid these efforts by repeatedly castigating high-ranking officers and even threatening Rainilaiarivony with his sword.|$|E
5|$|That same year, in {{the general}} {{elections}} held in November, Romero Barceló lost his gubernatorial seat against former governor and opposing party rival Rafael Hernández Colón (PPD). It is widely accepted that Romero Barceló lost the elections because of this case, since his public opinion rating had deteriorated substantially during late 1984 as the investigations progressed, and since his political rivals used his defense of the officers <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> a possible conspiracy.|$|E

40|$|We {{show how}} the {{difference}} between the finite temperature T structure factors, called S_-, associated with spin and density, can be used <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> superfluidity in ultracold Fermi gases. This observation can be exploited in two photon Bragg scattering experiments on gases which undergo BCS- Bose Einstein condensation crossover. Essential to our calculations is a proper incorporation of spin and particle number conservation laws which lead to compatibility at general T with two f-sum rules. Because it is applicable to general scattering lengths, a measurement of S- can be a useful, direct approach for establishing where superfluidity occurs...|$|R
5|$|Many Jews observe kashrut partially, by abstaining from pork or shellfish, or by not {{drinking}} milk with a meat dish. Some keep kosher at home but will eat in a non-kosher restaurant. In 2012, one {{analysis of the}} specialty food market in North America estimated that only 15% of Kosher consumers were Jewish. A sizable non-Jewish {{segment of the population}} views kosher certification <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> wholesomeness. Muslims, Hindus, and people with allergies to dairy foods often consider the kosher-pareve designation as an assurance that a food contains no animal-derived ingredients, including milk and all of its derivatives. However, since kosher-pareve foods may contain honey, eggs, or fish, strict vegetarians cannot rely on the certification.|$|E
5|$|Sources {{are silent}} {{regarding}} the events following the first Persian campaign but the silence {{in itself is}} an indication of the peace that prevailed and that the Persians stopped being a threat to the Roman East. The evidence for the second campaign is meager; Zosimus is the only one to mention it specifically. A passage in the Sibylline Oracles is interpreted by Hartmann <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> the second invasion. The campaign took place in 266 or 267 and was aimed directly at Ctesiphon; Odaenathus reached the walls of the Persian capital but had to cancel the siege and march north to face the influx of Germanic riders attacking Anatolia.|$|E
5|$|Hydraulic mining, which Pliny {{referred}} to as ruina montium ("ruin of the mountains"), allowed base and precious metals to be extracted on a proto-industrial scale. The total annual iron output is estimated at 82,500tonnes. Copper was produced {{at an annual rate}} of 15,000t, and lead at 80,000t, both production levels unmatched until the Industrial Revolution; Hispania alone had a 40% share in world lead production. The high lead output was a by-product of extensive silver mining which reached 200t per annum. At its peak around the mid-2nd century AD, the Roman silver stock is estimated at 10,000t, five to ten times larger than the combined silver mass of medieval Europe and the Caliphate around 800AD. <b>As</b> <b>an</b> <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> the scale of Roman metal production, lead pollution in the Greenland ice sheet quadrupled over its prehistoric levels during the Imperial era, and dropped again thereafter.|$|E

40|$|SummaryMouth {{breathing}} {{can cause}} structural and functional alterations to the stomatognathic system. Aimthe {{aim of this}} investigation was to study breathing, chewing, swallowing and speaking alterations present in patients with allergic rhinitis and associate it to rhinitis symptom intensity. Materials and Methods 170 patients between the ages of 6 and 55 years were prospectively evaluated in this study, all of them underwent both otorhinolaryngological and speech evaluation. Resultsthe difference in signs and symptoms' score between GR and GC was significant. Conclusionpatients with allergic rhinitis have functional alterations in their stomatognathic system and an increase in nasal obstruction scores can be considered <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> such alterations...|$|R
