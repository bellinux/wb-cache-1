40|$|International audienceThis paper {{reports on}} post- 1991 census data {{and on the}} {{breeding}} phenology of seabirds of the Chesterfield-Bampton and Bellona groups of coral islets in the Coral Sea. In total, 13 resident bird species were observed [Wedge-tailed Shearwater (Puffinus pacificus), Masked <b>Booby</b> (<b>S.</b> dactylatra), Brown <b>Booby</b> (Sula leucogaster), Red-footed <b>Booby</b> (<b>S.</b> sula), Lesser Frigatebird (Fregata arid), Great Frigatebird (F. minor), Black Noddy (Anous minim's), Brown Noddy A. stolidus), Crested Tern (Sterna bergii), Sooty Tern (S. fuscata), Fairy Tern (S. nereis), Black-naped Tern (S. sumatrana), and Buff-banded Rail (Gallirallus philippensis) ]. Segregation for nesting habitat {{was similar to that}} previously observed on other coral-reef islets of the Coral Sea. Breeding periods were either in the winter (Masked and Red-footed Boobies, Frigatebirds, Fairy Tern) or in the summer (Wedge-tailed Shearwater, Black and Brown Noddies, Crested and Black-naped Terns) or year-round (Brown Booby). Sooty Terns bred twice a year (summer and spring), but this was not consistent across years. Estimates of breeding population sizes for the whole Chesterfield-Bampton and Bellona groups are proposed for Wedge-tailed Shearwater (90, 000 to 106, 000 breeding pairs), Masked Booby (280 - 500 pairs), Brown Booby (3, 800 - 5, 800 pairs), Red-footed Booby (7, 200 - 7, 300 pairs), Lesser Frigatebird (1, 600 pairs), Great Frigatebird (350 - 480 pairs), Black Noddy (29, 000 - 45, 000 pairs), Brown Noddy (15, 000 - 23, 000 pairs), Crested Tern (80 - 100 pairs), Sooty Tern (11, 000 - 46, 000 pairs), and Black-naped Tern (70 - 90 pairs). Interannual fluctuation in breeding population size was apparent in Wedge-tailed Shearwater. Over the last 30 yr, an increase in Brown Booby abundance was noted, whereas declines are suspected for the Fairy Tern and Buff-banded Rail. Among the threats to nesting seabirds are stress and other disturbances caused by human frequentation, including poaching of seabird chicks and introduced mice...|$|R
