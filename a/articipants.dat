Specifically, the value of integrating and unders standing the sensorimotor weighting mechanisms underlyin ng laparoscopic performance will be highlighted to develop future design, traiining and use of haptic feedback robotic surgery devices. TThe results presented in this study show that the sagittal distance estimate betw ween touched positions on the upper limb can be systematiccally biased by manipulating the touched position on the arm, although the s sagittal separation remains unaltered (12. 7 cm). These resu ults are somewhat surprising regarding the participants apparent neglect of pro oprioceptive input which would indicate limb position follo owing changes in elbow and shoulder joint angles and muscle length. If the pa <b>articipant</b> was optimizing the use of their proprioceptive inp put it would be expected that movement of the limb would translate into a com mputation {{to maintain the status quo}} of the perceived separattion of the probe and button.

40|$|Since {{language}} {{has an important}} role in the social context, it cannot be separated from the society because language is part of the society itself. People use language in order to be able to communicate with one to another in everyday life. They also can express their feelings, emotions and thought to others by using language. When people come to think about language and society, they should be remember as soon as they realize that Sociolinguistic focuses on the study of relationship between language and society and its purpose is to get a good understanding of its function as means of communication. (Wardhaugh, 1986 : 13). Based on the facts that sociolinguistic studies the relationship between language and society, the writer of this thesis wants to analyze the main character's language as found in O'Neill's The Hairly Ape, through Sociolinguistic approach. In this study, the writer focuses her analyzing on: (1) the kind and style of language that is used by the main character (2) the influence of (S) etting, (P) <b>articipant,</b> (E) nds and (K) eys to his language used, and (3) the factors causing the main character to use his language like that. The theories underlying this thesis are, four components of S-P-E-AK-I-N-G, namely Setting, Participant, Ends and Keys, and Language and Dialect. Due to the fact that language is unseparable from society, the writer tries to dig up the content of the play to get as much information as she can, in order to be able to know deeper about the main character's social background which can later be related to the language used by the character. Using the content analysis, the writer tries to identify and analyze the main character's language through his dialogues. After analyzing the content of the play, the writer finds out that : (1) Yank mostly uses a kind of language which is similar to Black Vernacular English when he speaks to other people. While his style of his language tends to be wild, rough and impolite. Besides he uses a lot of exclamatory and imperative sentences in the beginning of the play to show his power as the leader of firemen; however, toward the end of the play, he uses interrogative sentences. It may indicate that he begins to find his self identity. (2) The setting, Participant, Ends and Key are able to influence Yank's language since they are closely related to each other. (3) There are two factors causing Yank to use such kind of language like that, namely an internal factor and an external factor. For the internal factor, they are divided two reasons, firstly the social and educational background and secondly is Yank's self confidence and self-pride. For the external factor, Yank's environment experiences during living and surviving on the steam-boat in where he was isolated from outside the world is the major reason for him to use Black Vernacular English. The writer realizes that there are shortcomings in her study. Therefore, it is suggested that : (a) the future researches on analyzing main character's language found in the play by using theory of S-P-E-A-K-I-N-G, emphasized on all those components. (b) The conversation chosen are not only the main character's speeches but another speaker's speeches as well...|$|R

Data were gathered through semi-structured interviews, as well as short essays and demographic questionnaires completed by the participants. The results were examined within the context of Lent and Brown’s (2013) social cognitive career theory (SCCT). The application of SCCT led to the examination of how the women overcame real and perceived barriers to degree attainment. Data analysis using the lens of liberal feminist theory exposed some of the social constructs that existed as the p <b>articipants</b> pursued their bachelor’s degrees. The following primary themes were identified: (a) a sense of benevolence leads nontraditional-age female college students to choose psychology as a major, (b) family and community support is critical for degree attainment for nontraditional-age women who study in a distance format, (c) nontraditional-age women choose a distance program because of its practicality and flexibility, (d) specific skills and traits contribute to the success of nontraditional-age female college students, and (e) nontraditional-age women who completed their degrees in psychology in a distance program experience personal and professional transformation.

METHOD: Four groups (Schizophrenic participants in active psychotic phases, n= 6; stable participants in remission, n= 30; participants’ relatives, n= 32; and healthy controls, n= 64) were assessed with self-report questionnaires {{to determine how the}} reactions to paranoia of clinical patients differ from healthy individuals. Cognitive, emotional and behavioral dimensions of their reactions to these paranoid thoughts were examined. RESULTS: Paranoid individuals were present in all groups. Most <b>articipants</b> referred the rejection by others as an important trigger of paranoid ideations, while active psychotic were unable to identify triggering situations to their thoughts and reactions. This may be determinant to the different reactions and the different degree of invalidation caused by paranoid thoughts observed across groups. CONCLUSION: Clinical and non-clinical expressions of paranoid ideations differ in terms of their cognitive, emotional and behavioral components. It is suggested that, in socially ambiguous situations, paranoid participants (presenting lower thresholds of paranoid schema activation) lose the opportunity to disconfirm their paranoid beliefs by resourcing to more maladaptive coping strategies. Consequently, by dwelling on these thoughts, {{the amount of time spent}} thinking about their condition and the disability related to the disease increases. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|E
40|$|The {{presented}} study {{looked at}} 100 full-time and part-time college students. The <b>articipants</b> {{were divided into}} three groups, {{on the basis of}} their age and undertaking developmental tasks of early adulthood. Group 1. consisted of persons aged 20 – 23, the majority of whom were full-time students; group 2. – persons aged 24 – 29, chiefly extramural, part-time students; finally, group 3. was comprised of persons 30 – 40 years of age, solely extramural students. The subject of analysis was differences in the intensity of each of the five dimensions of identity as well as the sense of being adult and readiness to form intimate relationships. The results showed that commitment making and identifi cation with commitment were growing higher with age. Also, in groups 2. and 3. the intensity of problems related to forming identity (ruminative exploration) was signifi cantly lower. A linear relationship between the sense of being adult and actual age was observed as well. The participants characterized by achieved identity status or foreclosed identity status scored highest on sense of adulthood and readiness for intimate relationships scales.

40|$|People {{who belong}} to many groups tend to have better health, {{including}} less depression. Group membership appears to have this protective function because it fosters an individual ’s social identity: their sense of self {{in terms of their}} group memberships. However, there has been limited research regarding why social identity acts as a buffer against depression. This study proposed that social identity protects against depression because it leads to more positive attributions. The study involved 115 first year psychology students. The type of identity made salient was manipulated with four between - groups conditions (con trol, personal identity, social identity, multiple social ide ntities). In order to see whether social identity would be protective in times of hardship all participants experienced failure - p <b>articipants</b> received a score of zero on a purported problem - solving task. The central dependent variables were participant s’ attributions and mood following the failure. As hypothesis ed, those in th e social identity condition had more positive attributions and less negative mood following the failure compared to those in the control condition. A mediation analysis revealed that a change in attributions fully mediated the effect of social identity on mood. The personal identity and multiple social identities conditions were included for exploratory purposes. These conditions had comparable effects to the social identity con dition. Compared to a control condition, thinking about personal or social identity reduced negative mood by leading to more positive attributions. Possible reasons why both social identity and personal identity may influence mood through attributions we re considered. Implications for the treatment of depression were also discussed...|$|E
40|$|Background: Epilepsy {{is common}} in people with {{intellectual}} disability, yet clinicians and researchers seldom obtain information directly from the client. The development and preliminary validation of a novel measure for use with people with mild to moderate intellectual disabilities is described. Methods: Focus group methods (6 groups; 24 p <b>articipants)</b> identified issues of concern, and qualitative analysis (NUD*IST) was applied to derive items and themes for a draft scale. Psychometric scale development techniques were then used in a pilot study and subsequent field-testing to investigate validity and reliability (n = 46). Results : A total of 148 issues of concern was reduced initially to 52 and then to 42 items using these methods. The derived scale comprised sub-scales reflecting (1) concerns about having seizures; (2) about injury; (3) about issues during; and (4) after seizures; (5) about medication; (6) about what people think; and (7) about daily life. Cronbach α for the Glasgow Epilepsy Outcome Scale - Client version (GEOS-C) was 0. 92, and ranged from 0. 64 - 0. 81 for the sub-scales. Relatively weak associations (r≤ 0. 40), between client and family carer, staff carer or clinician views, suggests that proxy reports are not good predictors of how people with epilepsy themselves are feeling. Preliminary validation suggests that the GEOS-C can discriminate on variables of clinical importance. Conclusion: The GEOS-C complements ex isting GEOS measures, can be completed in 5 - 15 min depending upon the level of support required, and may provide a valuable clinical and research tool. Further validational work and appraisal of sensitivity are required. © 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd...|$|E
40|$|Aim: We {{investigated}} cross-sectional {{associations between}} circulating homocysteine, folate, biomarkers of vitamin B 12 status and brain volumes. We furthermore compared brain volumes of <b>articipants</b> who received daily folic acid and vitamin B 12 supplementation with participants who did not. Methods: Participants of the B-PROOF study (n = 2919) {{were assigned to}} 400 μg folic acid and 500 μg vitamin B 12, or a placebo. After two years of intervention, T 1 -weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were made in a random subsample (n = 218) to obtain grey and white matter volume, and total brain volume (TBV). Plasma homocysteine, serum folate, vitamin B 12, holotranscobalamin, and methylmalonic acid concentrations were measured. Results: Multiple linear regression analyses showed inverse associations between plasma homocysteine with TBV (β = - 0. 91, 95 % CI- 1. 85 - 0. 03, p = 0. 06) and between serum folate and TBV (β = - 0. 20, 95 % CI - 0. 38, - 0. 02, p = 0. 03). No significant associations were observed for serum vitamin B 12 and holotranscobalamin. Fully adjusted ANCOVA models showed that the group that received B-vitamins had a lower TBV (adjusted mean 1064, 95 % CI 1058 - 1069 mL) than the non-supplemented group (1072, 95 % CI 1067 - 1078 mL, p = 0. 03). Conclusions: Results were contradictory, with higher Hcy levels associated with lower TBV, but also with higher folate levels associated with lower TBV. In addition, {{the lack of a}} baseline measurement withholds us from giving recommendations on whether folic acid and vitamin B 12 supplementation will be beneficial above and beyond normal dietary intake for brain health...|$|E
40|$|This {{study is}} a {{strength}} based investigation that focuses on resilience and well - being among adults diagnosed with mental illness in Kerala. The present investigation {{is divided into two}} parts: (I) Translation and cultural adaptation of tools namely; the FS and CD - RISC and (II) Main study which was carried out on clinical population. In Study I, the tools were culturally adapted for the target population following WHO (2016) gu idelines. 42 participa nts (women = 18, m en = 24; mean age= 25. 45) who claimed to possess reading, writing, and speaking skills in both English and Malayalam participated in the study. Findings from the cognitive interview and the Cronbach alpha scores for FS (α= 0. 78) and CD - RISC Scale (α= 0. 91) led {{to the conclusion that the}} tools were suitable for use. In Study II, p <b>articipants</b> were recruited by mental health professionals from different mental health institutions in Kerala, using a self - developed screening check list. These par ticipants then answered the quantitative and qualitative questionnaires. A total of 48 responses (women= 26, men = 22; mean age= 42. 50) were collected and analyzed using basic statistical procedures and thematic analysis respectively. Following Braun and C larke’s (2006) six steps for thematic analysis, themes we re discovered under three major categories namely, (a) challenges, (b) protective factors and (c) positive outcomes among adults diagnosed with mental illness. In conclusion, it may be gathered that despite these challenges and cumulative risks, participan ts were able to function in different areas of life but many failed to acknowledge it...|$|E
40|$|The meat {{value chain}} {{is a complex}} {{organization}} with multiple participants performing numerous value added functions. Perhaps the most complex and least well understood segment is that downstream from the packer, e. g., the processor, wholesaler, exporter, retailer and food service (or restaurant) operator. One portion of the Livestock and Meat Marketing Study provided an overview of marketing and pricing methods used in this sector and, in particular, the results of analyses {{of the relationship between}} use of alternative marketing arrangements (AMAs) and the distribution and sales of meat products downstream from the packer. The analyses include both beef and pork products, are descriptive and focus on the relationships among industry <b>articipants</b> beyond the packing plant. The information used includes the results of the industry interviews, data from the industry surveys, and transactions data from meat processors. Primary conclusions related to meat processing, distribution, and sales, are as follows: • Firms differ greatly in the sales, purchase, and pricing methods for meat. Firms rely heavily on the spot market but also use other methods. They also mix-and-match purchase and pricing methods, e. g., buying on the forward market, but pricing on a formula. • Meat processors play an important distribution role in the meat value chain by purchasing large lots from a few sources and selling small lots to many firms. • Packers sort cattle purchased under various marketing arrangements {{to meet the needs of}} its buyers, but aggregate transactions data suggest that downstream marketing arrangements have little or no relationship to cattle purchase methods or branded beef sales programs.

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the existence of}} informal code switching between teenagers at home in Surabaya. As such, the objectives {{of this study are}} (1) to describe what languages are code-switching by the subjects at home during their conversation, (2) to describe the reasons of the existence of the code switching, that is to describe the factors that motivated the subjects under study to switch from one code (languages) to another code (language) at home, and (3) to describe the ways that the subjects code switch their conversations from one code (language) to another code (language) at home. In collecting the data, the writer records the conversations or writes them manually. There are seven conversations which are analyzed under the parameters namely (L) anguage used, (S) etting, (P) <b>articipants,</b> (E) nds, (A) ct sequence, and (P) ersonal emotions. Based on the data analyzed, the writer finds out that: (1) 	The language which is mainly used by the teenagers at home is non-standard Indonesian. (2) 	The language which is mainly code switched by the teenagers is Indonesian to English or English to Indonesian. (3) 	The teenagers’ reasons in switching from one code to another are to maintain the smoothness of the conversations, to keep their secrets because they do not want their conversation to be understood by others, the lack of vocabulary in one language, to express the teenagers’ habit and so on. The writer realizes that there are many shortcoming in this study. Therefore, it is suggested that: (1) 	The future researches of code switching are emphasized in formal situation such as at school during English lesson. (2) 	The subjects under the study are taken from various family backgrounds. For example some subjects have Indonesian background and others come from Chinese family...|$|E
