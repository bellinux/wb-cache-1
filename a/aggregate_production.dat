Their close connection with the construction industry places them among the most used materials worldwide, second only to water. Despite its significance, the sector suffers from the non-systematic register of production data, resulting in weakness to study the main features affecting the sector's structure and future capacity. The paper focuses on the <b>aggregates</b> <b>production</b> in 26 European countries. Data from available sources are gathered and combined for a 10 -year period (1997 - 2006), {{as an effort to}} provide {{a clear view of the}} major attributes of this vital industrial sector. Through a thorough analysis, the main drivers in <b>aggregates</b> <b>production</b> are revealed and existing correlations and trends are identified. New findings are also presented, for example the significance of GDP from construction and the strong connection of <b>aggregates</b> <b>production</b> per capita with the residential building sector.

40|$|The <b>production</b> {{of primary}} <b>aggregates</b> is {{considered}} an industrial activity that generates significant environmental burdens. This is because, by nature, the mining and minerals industry activities involve the removal of an underlying non-renewable resource and require both short-term and long-term use of the land. As a result, the sustainable development of mineral resources requires a delicate balance of economic, environmental and societal considerations. To respond to the challenge, the aggregate producers {{must be able to}} assess the performance of the production processes involved in the operation and ultimately be able to provide the eco-profile of their individual products. This would also allow the producers to identify the processes where improvements can be implemented to achieve maximum benefits through the lifetime of their operations. This research aimed to develop the necessary tools that assess the implementation of sustainable development concepts in primary <b>aggregates</b> <b>production.</b> The first part of the work focused on the development of a sustainability indicators framework, which can be used throughout the aggregate industry. The second part of the work aimed at developing a reliable and quantitative tool to measure and assess the full sustainability performance of primary <b>aggregates</b> <b>production</b> based on Life Cycle principles addressing both environmental and economic sustainability considerations. The holistic perspective offered by Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) enables decision makers to quantify significant environmental impacts throughout the primary aggregate life cycle and assess the trade-offs inherent in any change implemented to the production system. As LCA typically does not address the economical and social aspects of products/production systems sustainability, Life Cycle Costing (LCC) was used to complement the LCA tool developed. The LCC assessment tool evaluates all costs associated with the life cycle of <b>aggregates</b> <b>production,</b> covering initial capital costs, operating and maintenance costs as well as disposal costs. The optimisation of the trade-off between the life cycle cost factors and environmental impacts help in determining appropriate metrics to assess the sustainability of <b>aggregates</b> <b>production</b> operations.

2500|$|The Cambridge capital {{controversy}} [...] {{sometimes called}} [...] "the capital controversy" [...] or [...] "the two Cambridges debate" [...] {{refers to a}} theoretical and mathematical debate during the 1960s among economists concerning the nature and role [...] of capital goods and the critique of the dominant [...] neoclassical vision of <b>aggregate</b> <b>production</b> and distribution. The name arises because of {{the location of the}} principals involved in the controversy: the debate was largely between economists such as Joan Robinson and Piero Sraffa at the University of Cambridge in England and economists such as Paul Samuelson and Robert Solow at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

2500|$|Further, this {{formulation}} {{does not}} treat {{the rate of}} profit as a price determined by supply and demand. Rather, it fits more with neoclassical conceptions of [...] "normal" [...] profits. These refer to the basic profits that the owners of capital must receive {{in order to stay}} in business in their sector. Third, while neoclassical economics assumes that the [...] "normal" [...] rate of profit is determined by <b>aggregate</b> <b>production</b> (as discussed above), this formulation takes the rate of profit as exogenously given. That is because the whole neoclassical theory of profit-rate determination is being questioned: if we can go from the marginal product of capital to the profit rate, {{we should be able to}} go from the profit rate to the marginal product. In any event, few if any participants in the Cambridge Controversy attacked the Sraffian critique on these grounds.|$|E

It puts in jeopardy the neoclassical theory {{of capital and}} the notion of input demand curves, both at the economy and industry levels. It also puts in jeopardy the neoclassical theories of output and employment determination, as well as Wicksellian monetary theories, since they are all deprived of stability. The consequences for neoclassical analysis are thus quite devastating. It is usually asserted that only aggregate neoclassical theory of the textbook variety [...] and hence macroeconomic theory, based on <b>aggregate</b> <b>production</b> functions [...] is affected by capital reversing.

60|$|But (2.) {{though the}} {{artificial}} abstraction of {{a portion of}} profits would have a real tendency to accelerate improvements in production, no considerable improvements might actually result, or only of such a kind as not to raise general profits at all, or not to raise them {{so much as the}} tax had diminished them. If so, the rate of profit would be brought closer to that practical minimum to which it is constantly approaching. At its first imposition the tax falls wholly on profits; but the amount of increase of capital, which the tax prevents, would, if it had been allowed to continue, have tended to reduce profits to the same level; and at every period of ten or twenty years there will be found less difference between profits as they are and profits as they would in that case have been, until at last there is no difference, and the tax is thrown either upon the laborer or upon the landlord. The real effect of a tax on profits is to make the country possess at any given period a smaller capital and a smaller <b>aggregate</b> <b>production,</b> and to make the stationary state be attained earlier, and with a smaller sum of national wealth.|$|E
60|$|But, though {{credit is}} never {{anything}} more than a transfer of capital from hand to hand, it is generally, and naturally, a transfer to hands more competent to employ the capital efficiently in production. If there were no such thing as credit, or if, from general insecurity and want of confidence, it were scantily practiced, many persons who possess more or less of capital, but who from their occupations, or for want of the necessary skill and knowledge, can not personally superintend its employment, would derive no benefit from it: their funds would either lie idle, or would be, perhaps, wasted and annihilated in unskillful attempts to make them yield a profit. All this capital is now lent at interest, and made available for production. Capital thus circumstanced forms {{a large portion of the}} productive resources of any commercial country, and is naturally attracted to those producers or traders who, being in the greatest business, have the means of employing it to most advantage, because such are both the most desirous to obtain it and able to give the best security. Although, therefore, the productive funds of the country are not increased by credit, they are called into a more complete state of productive activity. As the confidence on which credit is grounded extends itself, means are developed by which even the smallest portions of capital, the sums which each person keeps by him to meet contingencies, are made available for productive uses. The principal instruments for this purpose are banks of deposit. Where these do not exist, a prudent person must keep a sufficient sum unemployed in his own possession to meet every demand which he has even a slight reason for thinking himself liable to. When the practice, however, has grown up of keeping this reserve not in his own custody, but with a banker, many small sums, previously lying idle, become aggregated in the banker’s hands; and the banker, being taught by experience what proportion of the amount is likely to be wanted in a given time, and knowing that, if one depositor happens to require more than the average, another will require less, is able to lend the remainder, that is, the far greater part, to producers and dealers: thereby adding the amount, not indeed to the capital in existence, but to that in employment, and making a corresponding addition to the <b>aggregate</b> <b>production</b> of the community.|$|E
