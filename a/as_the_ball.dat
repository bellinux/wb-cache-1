5|$|England reached 3/106 by stumps on {{the fourth}} day, but the final day started poorly when Compton edged the second ball of the day—bowled by Johnston—to a diving Miller at second slip; he knocked the ball upwards before falling {{on his back and}} {{completing}} the catch <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> went down. Just as in the first innings, Compton’s dismissal precipitated a collapse, and Australia dismissed England for 186 to complete victory by 409 runs.|$|E

5|$|On May 28, Bonds passed Ruth, {{hitting his}} 715th career home run to center field off Colorado Rockies pitcher Byung-hyun Kim. The ball was hit an {{estimated}} 445feet (140m) into center field where {{it went through}} the hands of several fans but then fell onto an elevated platform in center field. Then it rolled off the platform where Andrew Morbitzer, a 38-year-old San Francisco resident, caught the ball {{while he was in}} line at a concession stand. Mysteriously, radio broadcaster Dave Flemming's radio play-by-play of the home run went silent just <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> was hit, apparently from a microphone failure. But the televised version, called by Giants broadcaster Duane Kuiper, was not affected.|$|E

5|$|Tech's kickoff was {{returned}} to the Tennessee 25-yard line, but on the first play of the Volunteers' drive, Crompton was sacked by Jason Worilds and fumbled the ball. The loose ball was recovered by Virginia Tech's John Graves at the Tennessee 13-yard line. The Hokies' offense returned to the field and began running out the clock with running plays, which keep the game clock ticking as long <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> carrier is tackled {{in the field of}} play. Three rushing plays failed to gain a first down, but they drained more than two minutes from the game clock, and Tech's Waldron extended the Hokies' lead to 37-14 with a 22-yard field goal.|$|E
5|$|A return {{match against}} Surrey began on Thursday, 29 August, at Clifton College Close Ground and Gloucestershire were {{fortunate}} {{to get a}} draw after being forced to follow on. For once this season, Grace struggled to take wickets and could manage only 1–86 in Surrey's total of 232 which was made over two days because of rain. Gloucestershire struggled to 84–9 at the close on Friday, Grace out for 3, and were immediately dismissed for 84 on Saturday. Grace was out for 25 in the second innings but Fred again {{came to the rescue}} with 63 as Gloucestershire held on for the draw, scoring 161–4. An oft-recounted incident involving Grace occurred in this match. While he was batting, he had run three when a fielder's throw caused the ball to lodge in his shirt and he seized the opportunity to complete several runs before the fielders forced him to stop. He disingenuously claimed that he would have been out handled the ball if he had removed it and, following a discussion, the umpires agreed that only the initial three runs should be awarded <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> was dead (out of play) when it went into his shirt.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal {{started the}} match through {{kick-off}} Henry. There {{minutes into the}} match, captain Tony Adams attempted to clear the ball via a header, only for it to land at Arif Erdem, who attempted a volley shot outside the Arsenal area, deflecting off the goal post. As a result, Galatasaray were awarded a corner. Erdem took it, but failed to trouble the defense, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> was easily cleared away. Arsenal responded via Bergkamp, who received the ball from Marc Overmars; Bergkamp attempted to outrun Galatasaray defenders Capone and Gheorghe Popescu and into their area, only to be unable to keep the ball in match play. Arsenal even fashioned more chances, as Overmars won a one-on-one encounter against Capone, trying to reach Bergkamp, but the ball was easily read by Popescu for a corner. The corner was came to nothing, as Patrick Vieira tried to hit the ball, before it landed for an opportunity for Henry, whose shot went over the goal post. A third of the match played, Arsenal were awarded a free-kick opportunity, after Okan Buruk received a yellow card for committing a sliding tackle on Vieira.|$|E

5|$|England {{started their}} second innings 337 runs in arrears. Dewes took strike and {{got off the}} mark from Lindwall when he aimed a hook shot and was {{credited}} with a boundary when the ball came off his shoulder. Lindwall's steepling bouncer rose over his bat and narrowly missed his head. Soon after, Lindwall made the early breakthrough, bowling Dewes—who offered no shot—for 10 to leave England 20/1. Dewes had often committed to playing the ball from the front foot before the bowler delivered the ball, thereby putting himself into difficulty. This was because of his habit of leaning his weight onto his back foot <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> was being bowled, which meant that a forward lean would instinctively result. Edrich joined Hutton and the pair consolidated the England innings, which reached 54/1 at the close at the second day's play, which was hastened by bad light.|$|E
5|$|Galatasaray's Ergün Penbe {{stepped up}} {{to take the first}} spot kick and scored. He placed the ball inside the near {{right-hand}} corner, just past Seaman, who dived to his left. Davor Šuker was the first man up to take Arsenal's penalty kick. His effort proved to be unsuccessful, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> hit the left-hand post and bounced off the goal. Şükür became the next player to take Galatasaray's spot kick. He scored as he lobbed the ball in the right-hand corner. With Galatasaray leading 2–0, Arsenal's next penalty taker was Parlour. He placed the ball on the spot and successfully scored by burying the ball to Taffarel's right to make it 2–1. Ümit Davala calmly placed the goal, near the centre of the goal to make it 3–1 to Galatasaray. Arsenal's only hope now was Vieira, but the midfielder missed and hit the crossbar instead. Popescu then stepped up, and netted with a powerful shot, as Galatasaray won the penalty shoot-out 4–1.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the Second World War, Johnston was a slow-medium and left-arm {{orthodox}} spin bowler, {{but during}} a practice session, he bowled a quicker ball to Jack Ryder a former Australian captain and Test batsman, {{who was now}} a Victorian and national selector. This prompted Ryder to wage a personal campaign to induce Johnston to become a pace bowler. At the same time, Richmond captain Jack Ledward wanted him to bowl spin. Upon the resumption of first-class cricket in 1945–46, Johnston made his first-class debut against Queensland and was entrusted with the responsibility of opening the attack. His maiden wicket was that of leading Test batsman Bill Brown. Johnston took a total of 1/84 in a ten-wicket win. He felt that the fast bowling was only for short periods with the new ball, {{and that he would}} be allowed to revert to spin bowling <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> became older. He played a total of seven matches for the season and took 12 wickets at 35.08, with his best performance being 4/43 against arch-rivals New South Wales. As a result, he missed the national selection for the tour to New Zealand.|$|E

50|$|A knuckleball or knuckler is a {{baseball}} pitch thrown {{to minimize the}} spin of <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> in flight, causing an erratic, unpredictable motion.

This makes the pitch difficult for batters to hit, but also difficult for pitchers to control and catchers to catch; umpires are challenged <b>as</b> well, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball's</b> irregular motion through the air makes it harder to call balls and strikes.|$|R
5|$|The current match {{ball for}} the Recopa Sudamericana, {{manufactured}} by Nike, is named the Total 90 Omni CSF. It {{is one of}} the many balls produced by the American sports equipment maker for CONMEBOL, replacing the Mercurial Veloci Hi-Vis in 2009. The ball, approved by FIFA and weighing approximately 422 g, has a spherical shape that allows the ball to fly faster, farther, and more accurately. According to Nike, the ball's geometric precision distributes pressure evenly across panels and around the ball. The compressed polyethylene layer stores energy from impact and releases it at launch, and the 6-wing carbon-latex air chamber improves acceleration. Another feature of the ball is its rubber layer; it was designed to allow a better response while retaining the impact energy and releases it in the coup. Its support material of cross-linked nitrogen-expanded foam improves its retention and durability of its shape. Polyester support fabric enhances structure and stability.

5|$|The {{earliest}} definite {{reference to}} cricket is dated Monday, 17 January 1597 (i.e., a Julian date which is 1598 by modern reckoning under the Gregorian calendar). It is a deposition in {{the records of}} a legal case at Guildford, Surrey, re {{the use of a}} parcel of land c.1550 and John Derrick, a coroner, testified that he had at that time played cricket on the land when he was a boy. Derrick's testimony makes clear that the sport was being played c.1550, but its true origin is a mystery. All that can be said with a fair degree of certainty is that its beginning was earlier than 1550, somewhere in south-east England within the counties of Kent, Sussex and Surrey. Unlike other games with batsmen, bowlers and fielders, such as stoolball and rounders, cricket can only be played on relatively short grass, especially <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> was delivered along the ground until the 1760s. Therefore, forest clearings and land where sheep had grazed would have been suitable places to play.|$|E
5|$|The {{three types}} of {{scrimmage}} kicks are place kicks, drop kicks, and punts. Only place kicks and drop kicks can score points. The place kick is the standard method used to score points, because the pointy shape of the football {{makes it difficult to}} reliably drop kick. Once the ball has been kicked from a scrimmage kick, it can be advanced by the kicking team only if it is caught or recovered behind the line of scrimmage. If it is touched or recovered by the kicking team beyond this line, it becomes dead at the spot where it was touched. The kicking team is prohibited from interfering with the receiver's opportunity to catch the ball, and the receiving team has the option of signaling for a fair catch. This prohibits the defense from blocking into or tackling the receiver, but the play ends as soon <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> is caught and the ball may not be advanced.|$|E
5000|$|Putting <b>the</b> <b>Balls</b> Together: If both {{balls are}} caught {{at the same}} time, they may be [...] "put together," [...] at which point normal play stops. <b>The</b> <b>balls</b> may then be thrown {{according}} to {{the manner in which}} they are thrown when just two people are left. If the player trying to catch <b>the</b> <b>balls</b> fails, they receive an out. Note that <b>the</b> <b>balls</b> do not have to be put together, and that normal play could stop, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>balls</b> are put together, and then begin anew if a player makes the catch and opts to separate them again.|$|R
40|$|Amodal (redundant) and {{arbitrary}} cross-sensory feature associations {{involve the}} context-insensitive mapping of absolute feature values across sensory domains. Cross-sensory associations {{of a different}} kind, known <b>as</b> correspondences, involve <b>the</b> context-sensitive mapping of relative feature values. Are such correspondences in place at birth (like amodal associations), or are they learned from subsequently experiencing relevant feature co-occurrences in the world (like arbitrary associations) ? To decide between these two possibilities, human newborns (median age = 44 hrs) watched animations in which two balls alternately rose and fell together in space. The pitch of an accompanying sound rose and fell either congruently with this visual change (pitch rising and falling <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>balls</b> moved up and down), or incongruently (pitch rising and falling <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>balls</b> moved down and up). Newborns' looking behaviour was sensitive to this congruence, providing the strongest indication to date that cross-sensory correspondences can be in place at birth...|$|R

5|$|With only 4:25 {{remaining}} and a lead well in hand, Stanford {{began running}} down the clock by executing running plays, which keep the game clock running as long <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> carrier is downed {{in the field of}} play. Three rushes gained Stanford 16yards, but the effectiveness of this strategy was undermined by a 15-yard personal foul penalty against Stanford that prevented the Cardinal from gaining a first down. Stanford also accepted a delay of game penalty in order to squeeze as much time as possible from the clock before punting back to Virginia Tech. The final drive of the game began from the Tech 11-yard line with 2:10 remaining, and quarterback Taylor controlled the ball on all of its five plays. Taylor completed a five-yard pass to Coale, then ran for 18yards and a first down. He was then sacked for a 15-yard loss, but gained much of that back with an 11-yard run. On the game's final play, Taylor completed a 17-yard first-down pass to Wilson, who was tackled as the last second ticked off the clock and Stanford clinched a 40–12 victory.|$|E
5|$|After lunch, Australia scored {{slowly as}} Loxton {{struggled}} {{to come to}} grips with the bowling. Yardley took the new ball in an attempt to trouble the batsmen, but instead, Loxton began to settle in <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> came onto the bat more quickly. He lofted Pollard to the leg side, almost for six, and then hit three boundaries off another over from the same bowler. Harvey accelerated as well, and 80 minutes into the session, reached his century to a loud reception as Australia passed 250. On each occasion, umpire Frank Chester walked to the edge of the playing field and tried to inspect where the ball landed amongst the crowd, trying to see if the point of impact was beyond the original playing arena. They were ruled as sixes in any case and some thought Chester’s actions to be more for theatrical than umpiring purposes. Loxton then dominated the scoring with a display of power hitting. He brought up his 50 by hitting Cranston into the pavilion for six, eliciting spontaneous applause from the English players. It also brought up a century stand, which yielded 105 in only 95 minutes. Harvey was out for 112 from 183 balls, but not before the high run rate during the partnership had helped to swing the match back from England's firm control.|$|E
5|$|Granderson led off {{the first}} inning with a home run for the Mets, and scored the Mets' second run in the sixth inning. The Mets {{had a chance to}} break the game open in that sixth inning as they loaded the bases with no outs, but had to settle for one run after Céspedes lined a foul ball off his leg and was injured, leaving the game after popping up for the first out of the inning. Duda hit a {{sacrifice}} fly before d'Arnaud grounded out to end the inning. Harvey pitched eight shutout innings for the Mets, and convinced Collins to keep him in the game for the ninth. He then gave up a leadoff walk to Cain in the ninth inning, and the Royals got a run when Hosmer drove Cain in with a double, prompting Collins to call upon Familia to relieve Harvey. After a groundout by Moustakas advanced Hosmer to third base with one out, Pérez hit a ground ball to third baseman Wright, who after checking Hosmer at third, threw to first base for the second out; however, Hosmer broke for home as soon <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> was thrown, and Duda, who fielded the out at first, threw wide at home attempting to throw Hosmer out, and the latter scored the tying run, resulting in Familia blowing his third save of the postseason and the series; his eight save opportunities tied the postseason record set in 2002 by Robb Nen.|$|E

5|$|Just {{after the}} start of the second half of extra time Cardiff made their final substitution, {{replacing}} McNaughton with Darcy Blake. Two minutes later Kuyt made a run from deep in the Liverpool half, his initial shot was blocked, but the ball rebounded towards him. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> came back to him he shot again and the ball went past Heaton and into the Cardiff goal to give Liverpool a 2–1 lead. Cardiff were struggling after the goal with a number of their players suffering from cramp. Nevertheless, they had a chance in the 111th minute, when a Gunnarsson long throw was only half-cleared by Liverpool, but they were unable to convert the chance. Towards the end of the half Cardiff began to exert more pressure on Liverpool. Turner, who had been moved into the striker position won a corner for Cardiff, which was punched away by Reina for a throw-in. Cardiff won another from the throw, which found Kiss, whose shot was cleared off the line of the Liverpool goal by Kuyt for another corner. The subsequent corner was headed on by Gunnarsson to Turner, who beat Kuyt to the ball and put his shot past Reina into the Liverpool goal to level the score at 2–2. Turner was shown a yellow card for removing his shirt during the celebration of the goal. Liverpool won a corner with a minute remaining but they were unable to score and the referee brought extra time to an end with the scores level, resulting in a penalty shoot-out.|$|E
5|$|The next possession, Kansas' John Parker {{stole the}} ball and crossed half court when coach Harp called a timeout. Chamberlain {{received}} {{the ball in the}} post, went up for a shot and received some contact; however, no referee called a foul and the ball rolled out of bounds off Carolina. The next play, Elstun was run into by a Tar Heel and went to the line for two shots with 31 seconds remaining, where he missed the first and made the second shot. Out of timeouts, Kearns drove into the lane and put up a shot that was blocked out of bounds by Chamberlain. The following play, Quigg pumpfaked and went up for a shot that Chamberlain blocked; however, simultaneously King made contact with Quigg's body while shooting and the referees called a shooting foul. Quigg went to the free throw line for two shots with six seconds to go and made both, which gave the Tar Heels the lead 5453. Kansas called a timeout and in-bounded to Loneski who then passed the ball towards Chamberlain who was under the basket. The pass was under thrown and Quigg tipped the ball away from Chamberlain. Kearns grabbed {{the ball and}} got away from a defender before he threw the ball into the air to run out the clock. Time expired <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> was in the air and the Tar Heels won the National Championship.|$|E
