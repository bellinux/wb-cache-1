40|$|The ever-changing {{senses of}} {{consumption}} and fashion {{factor in the}} world have caused an ongoing increase on the demand towards hand woven textiles in recent years. Therefore, the prices of hand woven textiles, where the supply is limited, are on the rise. It is known that Buldan city, one of the centers of hand woven production in Anatolia, has a significant commercial potential in this respect. The {{purpose of this study is}} to provide an insight to the industry by comparing the profit margin of products woven in hand <b>looms</b> and <b>automatic</b> <b>looms</b> in textile industry in Buldan city and to raise awareness regarding the importance of production in hand looms. “Scarf”, which is the most produced textile item in Buldan, was preferred in the application study. In the study, the unit costs of the scarves woven with insect silk, floss silk, cotton and linen yarn, which are widely used in production, in hand <b>looms</b> and <b>automatic</b> <b>looms</b> were calculated and the profit margins to be calculated through the average sales prices were compared.

In October 1889, the very first operational trial of the Draper Northrop <b>automatic</b> <b>loom</b> was made at the Seaconnet Mills.

The most impressive of these was the 1924 Toyoda <b>Automatic</b> <b>Loom,</b> Type G, a completely automatic high-speed loom featuring the ability to change shuttles without stopping and dozens of other innovations. At the time it was the world's most advanced loom, delivering a dramatic improvement in quality and a twenty-fold increase in productivity.In 2007, this machine was registered as item No. 16 in the Mechanical Engineering Heritage of Japan as [...] "a landmark achievement that advanced the global textile industry and laid the foundation {{for the development of the}} Toyota Group." ...|$|E

50|$|A {{link between}} Platt Brothers and the Toyota company of Japan {{was made in}} 1929 when the company paid £100,000 for the patent rights for an {{innovative}} <b>automatic</b> weaving <b>loom</b> designed by Sakichi Toyoda. The Toyoda Model G loom had mechanical sensors that automatically shut down the loom if a warp thread snapped. The thinking behind this feature was jidoka which translates as automation with a human touch. Workers were freed from monitoring <b>automatic</b> <b>looms</b> and mill owners achieved {{a dramatic increase in}} labour productivity with one worker able to operate up to 30 machines. Money from the sale of rights provided the start-up capital for the Toyota automobile endeavour. The name change was done for phonetic reasons so although Toyota is now best known as an automotive company, it began as Toyoda the textile machinery manufacturer.|$|R
5000|$|... "Kissing the shuttle" [...] is {{the term}} for a process by which weavers used their mouths to pull thread through {{the eye of a}} shuttle when the pirn was replaced. The same {{shuttles}} were used by many weavers, and the practice was unpopular. It was outlawed in the U.S. state of Massachusetts in 1911 but continued even after it had been outlawed in Lancashire, England in 1952. The Lancashire cotton industry was loath to invest in hand-threaded shuttles, or in the more productive Northrop <b>automatic</b> <b>looms</b> with self-threading shuttles, which were introduced in 1902.|$|R

50|$|Habakkuk {{acknowledges}} that at first, technical progress was more empirical than scientific. The labor-saving innovations that he proposed were only modifications to older apparatuses, {{as opposed to}} a great leap of scientific knowledge that led to a new invention. He uses the different methods of spinning as an example: the spinning jenny, the water-frame, the spinning mule, the power loom, and finally the variations of the <b>automatic</b> <b>loom.</b> Each of the methods built on the previous one until the textile industry was satisfied with the efficiency of the <b>automatic</b> <b>loom.</b> However, he proposes that labor scarcity gave manufactures a greater incentive to explore and adopt “inventions of purely autonomous origin” in order to save labor and capital. Moreover, labor scarcity induced both a higher rate of technical progress and a greater willingness to forgo existing machinery.|$|E

5000|$|The {{history of}} Toyota started in 1933 {{with the company}} being a {{division}} of Toyoda <b>Automatic</b> <b>Loom</b> Works devoted {{to the production of}} automobiles {{under the direction of the}} founder's son, Kiichiro Toyoda. Kiichiro Toyoda had traveled to Europe and the United States in 1929 to investigate automobile production and had begun researching gasoline-powered engines in 1930. Toyoda <b>Automatic</b> <b>Loom</b> Works was encouraged to develop automobile production by the Japanese government, which needed domestic vehicle production, due to the war with China. [...] In 1934, the division produced its first Type A Engine, which was used in the first Model A1 passenger car in May 1935 and the G1 truck in August 1935. Production of the Model AA passenger car started in 1936. Early vehicles bear a striking resemblance to the Dodge Power Wagon and Chevrolet, with some parts actually interchanging with their American originals.|$|E
25|$|At this point, {{the thread}} is woven. Depending on the era, one person could manage {{anywhere}} from 3 to 100 machines. In the mid nineteenth century, four was the standard number. A skilled weaver in 1925 would run 6 Lancashire Looms. As time progressed new mechanisms were added that stopped the loom any time something went wrong. The mechanisms checked {{for such things}} as a broken warp thread, broken weft thread, the shuttle going straight across, and if the shuttle was empty. Forty of these Northrop <b>Looms</b> or <b>automatic</b> <b>looms</b> could be operated by one skilled worker.|$|R
