40|$|In {{these days}} the {{wireless}} communication requirements are increased according to customer requirements. The requirements are to have high voice quality, high data rates, multimedia features, low weight communication devices etc. But to provide these features to customers the wireless communication channel suffers from some problems. The main problem is fading which occurs due {{to the effect of}} multiple propagation paths, and the rapid movement of mobile communication devices. In a typical wireless communication environment, multiple propagation paths often exist from a transmitter to a receiver due to scattering by different objects. Signal travels in different paths can undergo different <b>attenuation,</b> <b>distortions,</b> delays and phase shifts. So, this is necessary to reduce the problem of fading.

50|$|After {{the turn}} of the century, DSL modems also made {{extensive}} use of automated echo cancellation. Though they used separate incoming and outgoing frequencies, these frequencies were beyond the voiceband for which the cables were designed, and often suffered <b>attenuation</b> <b>distortion</b> due to bridge taps and incomplete impedance matching. Deep, narrow frequency gaps often resulted, that could not be made usable by echo cancellation. These were detected and mapped out during connection negotiation.|$|E
50|$|In telecommunication, {{de-emphasis}} is the {{complement of}} pre-emphasis, in the antinoise system called emphasis. De-emphasis {{is a system}} process designed to decrease, (within a band of frequencies), the magnitude of some (usually higher) frequencies {{with respect to the}} magnitude of other (usually lower) frequencies in order to improve the overall signal-to-noise ratio by minimizing the adverse effects of such phenomena as <b>attenuation</b> <b>distortion</b> or saturation of recording media in subsequent parts of the system.|$|E
5000|$|Impedance {{discontinuities}} cause attenuation, <b>attenuation</b> <b>distortion,</b> standing waves, ringing {{and other}} effects because {{a portion of}} a transmitted signal will be reflected back to the transmitting device rather than continuing to the receiver, much like an echo. This effect is compounded if multiple discontinuities cause additional portions of the remaining signal to be reflected back to the transmitter. This is a fundamental problem with the daisy chain method of connecting electronic components.|$|E

50|$|Forward echo: In a {{transmission}} line, a reflection propagating {{in the same}} direction as the original wave and consisting of energy reflected back by one discontinuity and then forward again by another discontinuity. Forward echoes can be supported by reflections caused by splices or other discontinuities in the transmission medium (e.g. optical fiber, twisted pair, or coaxial tube). In metallic lines, they may be supported by impedance mismatches between the source or load and the characteristic impedance of the transmission medium. They may cause <b>attenuation</b> <b>distortion.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Digital {{subscriber}} lines (DSL) can {{be affected}} by a bridged tap, depending on where the tap is bridged. DSL signals reflect from the discontinuities, sending the signal back through the cable pair, much like a tennis ball against a brick wall. The echoed signal is now out of phase and mixed with the original, creating, among other impairments, <b>attenuation</b> <b>distortion.</b> The modem receives both signals, gets confused and [...] "takes errors" [...] or cannot sync. If the bridged tap is long, the signal bounces back only in very attenuated form. Therefore, the modem will ignore the weaker signal and show no problem.|$|E

5000|$|As {{an example}} of the second type, a {{standing}} wave in a transmission line is a wave in which the distribution of current, voltage, or field strength is formed by the superposition of two waves of the same frequency propagating in opposite directions. The effect is a series of nodes (zero displacement) and anti-nodes (maximum displacement) at fixed points along the transmission line. Such a standing wave may be formed when a wave is transmitted into one end of a transmission line and is reflected from the other end by an impedance mismatch, i.e., discontinuity, such as an [...] or a short.

30|$|From [19], we {{know that}} the perceptual effects of {{attenuation}} and amplification distortion on speech intelligibility are not equal. Amplification distortion in excess of 6.02 dB (region III) bears the most detrimental effect on speech intelligibility, while the <b>attenuation</b> <b>distortion</b> (region I) was found to yield the least effect on intelligibility. Region I+II constraints are the most robust in terms of yielding consistently large benefits in intelligibility independent of the SE algorithm used. However, in order to divide those three regions [19], the estimated magnitude spectrum needs to be compared with the clean spectrum which we usually do not have in real circumstances.|$|E

40|$|Left {{ventricular}} {{ejection fraction}} {{is an important}} cardiac-efficiency measure. Standard estimations are based on geometric analysis and modeling; they require time and experienced cardiologists. Alternative methods make use of indicator dilutions, but they are invasive due {{to the need for}} catheterization. This study presents a new minimally invasive indicator dilution technique for ejection fraction quantification. It is based on a peripheral injection of an ultrasound contrast agent bolus. Left atrium and left ventricle acoustic intensities are recorded versus time by transthoracic echocardiography. The measured curves are corrected for <b>attenuation</b> <b>distortion</b> and processed by an adaptive Wiener deconvolution algorithm for the estimation of the left ventricle impulse response, which is interpolated by a monocompartment exponential model for the ejection fraction assessment. This technique measures forward ejection fraction, which excludes regurgitant volumes. The feasibility of the method was tested on a group of 20 patients with left ventricular ejection fractions going from 10 % to 70 %. The results are promising and show a 0. 93 correlation coefficient with echographic bi-plane ejection fraction measurements. A more extensive validation as well as an investigation on the method applicability for valve insufficiency and right ventricular ejection fraction quantification will be an object of future study...|$|E
