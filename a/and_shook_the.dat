5|$|Historians {{consider}} India's {{modern age}} {{to have begun}} sometime between 1848 and 1885. The appointment in 1848 of Lord Dalhousie as Governor General of the East India Company {{set the stage for}} changes essential to a modern state. These included the consolidation and demarcation of sovereignty, the surveillance of the population, and the education of citizens. Technological changes—among them, railways, canals, and the telegraph—were introduced not long after their introduction in Europe. However, disaffection with the company also grew during this time, and set off the Indian Rebellion of 1857. Fed by diverse resentments and perceptions, including invasive British-style social reforms, harsh land taxes, and summary treatment of some rich landowners and princes, the rebellion rocked many regions of northern and central India <b>and</b> <b>shook</b> <b>the</b> foundations of Company rule. Although the rebellion was suppressed by 1858, it led to the dissolution of the East India Company and to the direct administration of India by the British government. Proclaiming a unitary state and a gradual but limited British-style parliamentary system, the new rulers also protected princes and landed gentry as a feudal safeguard against future unrest. In the decades following, public life gradually emerged all over India, leading eventually to the founding of the Indian National Congress in 1885.|$|E

25|$|The quarrel of the Ancients and the Moderns was a {{literary}} and artistic quarrel that heated {{up in the}} early 1690s <b>and</b> <b>shook</b> <b>the</b> Académie française. The opposing two sides were, the Ancients (Anciens) who constrain choice of subjects to those drawn from the literature of Antiquity and the Moderns (Modernes), who supported {{the merits of the}} authors of the century of Louis XIV. Fontenelle quickly followed with his Digression sur les anciens et les modernes (1688), in which he took the Modern side, pressing the argument that modern scholarship allowed modern man to surpass the ancients in knowledge.|$|E

25|$|In the 1975 World Championship cycle Korchnoi and Karpov, {{the newest}} star of Soviet chess, tied for {{first in the}} 1973 Leningrad Interzonal. In the 1974 Candidates' matches, Korchnoi first {{defeated}} the young Brazilian star GM Henrique Costa Mecking (who had won the other Interzonal in Petrópolis), by (+3−1=9) at Augusta, Georgia, in what he later described in his autobiography as a tough match. Korchnoi next played Petrosian again, at Odessa. The two were not on friendly terms, and it was even rumored that the two resorted to kicking each other under the table during this match; however, Korchnoi denies this. According to him, Petrosian just kicked his legs nervously <b>and</b> <b>shook</b> <b>the</b> table. Although the match {{was supposed to go}} to the first player to win four games, Petrosian resigned the match after just five games, with Korchnoi enjoying a lead of 3–1, with one draw.|$|E
25|$|The Ottoman Empire {{was also}} {{developing}} their own artillery pieces. Mehmed the Conqueror (1432-1481) was determined to procure large cannons {{for the purpose of}} conquering Constantinople and paid handsomely as well as allowed creative autonomy for cannon makers. One of the cannon makers that responded to his call was a Hungarian named Urban, who left Byzantium after being denied a raise by the Byzantine emperor. Urban labored for four months to create a six meter long cannon, which required hundreds of pounds of gunpowder to fire, and its stone projectiles weighed between 550 and 800 kilograms. The gun's projectiles were reported to have flown for a mile before landing, <b>and</b> <b>shook</b> <b>the</b> entire ground when fired, the roar blasting four miles away. It had to be transported by 30 wagons pulled by 60 oxen, with the assistance of 200 handlers. An additional 50 carpenters and 200 laborers helped in the transport by leveling terrain and building bridges. During the actual siege of Constantinople the gun proved to be somewhat underwhelming. The aiming process was laborious and after each shot it required hot oil ointment for cooling. Its rate of fire was once every three hours, and may have even suffered damage from cracks early on, never to be repaired.|$|E

Jack McCain's tour as CINCPAC ended in September 1972, despite his desire to have it extended {{so he could see}} the war to its conclusion. The old-time POWs cheered even more during the intense [...] "Christmas Bombing" [...] campaign of December 1972, when Hanoi was subjected {{for the first time to}} repeated B-52 Stratofortress raids. Although its explosions lit the night sky <b>and</b> <b>shook</b> <b>the</b> walls of the camp, scaring some of the newer POWs, most saw it as a forceful measure to compel North Vietnam to finally come to terms.|$|E
500|$|A student {{film society}} run by Kazuko Kawakita, the Cineclub Study Group, was {{planning}} to include Branded to Kill in a retrospective honouring Suzuki's works but Hori refused them and withdrew all of his films from circulation. With support from the Cineclub, similar student groups, fellow filmmakers and the general public—which included the picketing of the company's Hibiya offices {{and the formation of}} the Seijun Suzuki Joint Struggle Committee—Suzuki sued Nikkatsu for wrongful dismissal. During the three-and-a-half year trial the circumstances under which the film was made and Suzuki was fired came to light. He had been made into a scapegoat for the company's dire financial straits and was meant to serve as an example on the outset of an attempted company-wide restructuring. A settlement was reached on December 24, 1971, in the amount of one million yen, a fraction of his original claim, as well as a public apology from Hori. In a separate agreement Branded to Kill and his previous film, Fighting Elegy, were donated to the Tokyo National Museum of Modern Art's Film Centre. The events turned Suzuki into a legend <b>and</b> <b>shook</b> <b>the</b> film world. Branded to Kill, along with other of his films, played to [...] "packed audiences who wildly applauded" [...] at all-night revivals in and around Tokyo. However, Suzuki was blacklisted by the major studios and did not make another feature film until A Tale of Sorrow and Sadness (1977) ten years after Branded to Kill. In the meantime, he subsisted on commercial and television work and writing books of essays.|$|E

Despite the bombing, British production rose steadily throughout this period although there were significant falls during April 1941, probably influenced by the departure of workers of Easter Holidays, according to the British official history. The official history volume British War Production (Postan, 1952) noted that the greatest effect on output of warlike stores, was on the supply of components and dispersal of production rather than complete equipments.|$|E

2500|$|Perceptions {{of races}} [...] have {{drastically}} {{changed over the}} years dating {{all the way back to}} the medieval era referencing light and dark, good and evil. Hundreds of years later perceptions would be changed again with the Atlantic slave trade which left ideas of idealism for Caucasians and a negative idea of any other race. Caucasian nationalists also believed that all races originated from the 'white' race, [...] "Goldsmith maintained that all humans sprung from one common parent and attributed the variations in the human family to the influence of climate, culture, and custom". With this extreme racism of the time the black body was studied, displayed and scrutinized for any minor difference. [...] "The ideas about beauty we contend with in the twenty- first century draw in part on very old ways of thinking about human bodies and African difference." [...] In the 1960s the Black is Beautiful movement and Black Power movement took form <b>and</b> <b>shook</b> <b>the</b> world in a display of racial pride.

2500|$|It {{was then}} that the ship hit the first mine, {{triggering}} a huge explosion {{on the port side}} of the ship that caused the tailgate to fly open <b>and</b> <b>shook</b> <b>the</b> steamer. Shortly afterwards, a second explosion occurred, probably triggered by a boiler explosion. Baron Gautsch heeled hard to port and quickly began to run fully. Passengers on board began panicking, leading to general chaos. Passengers rushed to the lifeboats, which quickly became crowded before they were swung over the deck. In others, the holders were so tightly lashed or intricate that they could not be used. Many passengers jumped overboard and drowned. Heavy fuel oil was running out from the cracked oil tanks, [...] which irritated the nose, eyes and ears of those floating in the water and prevented them from breathing. Also, the oil caught fire and many of the passengers tragically burned alive. Passengers that survived testified afterwards that many members of the crew failed to care for the passengers, instead only caring about themselves. This is supported by the fact there were more crew members than passengers in many lifeboats. Baron Gautsch sank within about five to seven minutes after the first explosion. The Austro-Hungarian destroyers Csepel, Triglav and Balaton were nearby, so they were the first ships that came to the rescue of the victims. Together these ships saved 159 people from the water. However, 147 passengers, mostly women, children, and crew members, were killed. They were buried in the Military cemetery in Pula.|$|E

[...] The WGA rules allow only the credited writers to submit scripts for consideration, who may submit whichever draft of theirs that they may choose. It was up against another Star Trek episode, nominated by the production team; [...] "The Return of the Archons". Coon reportedly said at the time: [...] "If Harlan wins, I'm going to die", and that [...] "there are two scripts up tonight for the Writers' Guild Award, and I wrote them both." [...] On the night, Roddenberry and several of the crew were seated at a table which Desilu had purchased, while Ellison was at another. When he won, the Star Trek party rose to their feet and applauded, since they believed it would bring credibility to the series. Herbert Franklin Solow later recalled that this elation turned to horror when Ellison began talking about the interference of studio executives in the writing process, before holding aloft a copy of the original script and yelling [...] "Remember, never let them rewrite you!" [...] Ellison walked past the Desilu table as he left the podium, <b>and</b> <b>shook</b> <b>the</b> copy of the script at Roddenberry and his party.|$|E
