Wail presided over the ceremony, dubbing himself Abu Mossaeb al-Janubi after one of Muhammad's companions.|$|E
5|$|Sonnet 102 {{is one of}} the 154 sonnets {{written by}} English playwright and poet William Shakespeare. It {{is one of the}} Fair Youth sonnets, in which Shakespeare writes of an unnamed youth with whom the poet is enamored. Sonnet 102 is among a series of {{seemingly}} connected sonnets, from Sonnet 100 to Sonnet 103, in which the poet speaks of a silence between his Muse and himself. The exact date of writing is unknown, and there is contention among scholars <b>about</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> were written. Paul Hammond among other scholars believes that sonnets 61-103 were written primarily during the early 1590s, and then being edited or added to later, during the early 1600s (decade). Regardless of date of writing, it was published later {{along with the rest of}} the sonnets of the 1609 Quarto.|$|E
25|$|A {{study on}} {{examining}} sexual messages in popular TV shows found that 2 out of 3 programs contained sexually related actions. 1 out of 15 shows included scenes {{of sexual intercourse}} itself.

Some researchers believe that adolescents can use these messages as well as the sexual actions they see on TV in their own sexual lives.|$|E

25|$|The {{majority}} of women believe that antenatal care from a health professional is necessary to determine that their pregnancy is normal, {{to see that the}} fetus is well-positioned, to learn <b>about</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> were expected to deliver, to obtain a tetanus immunization, for the diagnosis and treatment of illnesses during pregnancy, and nutritional advice. The barriers to seeking antenatal care include travel time and distance from health care facilities, the high cost, and the inconvenient hours of operations of the clinics. Some women also did not want people to know they were pregnant until their third month of pregnancy, and would wait until then to seek antenatal care. Inexpensive care from traditional birth attendants included routine antenatal care, however untrained attendants and traditional healers did not provide antenatal care.|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Trey Parker and Matt Stone, and was {{directed}} by Parker. Parker and Stone considered [...] "Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride" [...] their favorite episode of the first season, and they credit it with helping elevate the credibility and relevance of South Park during {{the early days of}} the series. Although the first season of South Park received a lot of criticism from commentators who felt the show was disgusting and offensive, Parker specifically defended the episodes [...] "Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo" [...] and [...] "Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride", which he felt included moral values and a [...] "sweet side to it" [...] among the sophomoric humor. Stone also said those two episodes became the specific shows people would most talk <b>about</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> discussed South Park.|$|E

[...] He criticized the lack of plot and coherence in the musical numbers, feeling that storyline and character arcs were ignored in favor of showcasing Spears covers. Stack described the episode as a [...] "monumental television event,"; however, he also expressed his lingering sense of [...] "slight disappointment." [...] While he enjoyed the episode overall, Stack wrote that Spears' songs felt forced into the storyline, and that the episode was neither as iconic nor as exhilarating as Glee Madonna tribute. The Parents Television Council slammed the episode, accusing the presentation of Spears as a [...] "symbol of empowerment and self-esteem" [...] problematic, observing that the young audience [...] "basically witnessed an endorsement of narcotics abuse, public masturbation, and school-sanctioned burlesque." ...|$|E

500|$|The song's lyrics, {{written by}} Cyrus, Antonina Armato, Tim James and Devrim Karaoglu, have been mistakenly {{interpreted}} {{in a variety}} of ways. The song's protagonist sings in first person perspective while condemning an unspecified subject for wanting to invade her privacy. The majority of reviewers thought the protagonist was referring to a [...] "controlling boyfriend". Ben Ratliff of The New York Times sided with the boyfriend, and believed the song's protagonist was [...] "bullying some poor boy for the sin of wanting to know what she talks about with her friends." [...] Sarah Rodman of The Boston Globe believed the song could have described a number of subjects, such as [...] "a former boyfriend, the media, and even her fans." [...] However, in an interview with Jocelyn Vena of MTV News, Cyrus said the song was about [...] "the media" [...] and [...] "how they think they know everything <b>about</b> , <b>when</b> <b>they</b> don't.

500|$|... "Fly on the Wall" [...] {{was written}} by Cyrus {{with the aid of}} Armato, James, and Devrim Karaoglu. [...] "Fly on the Wall" [...] was {{intended}} for the media, regarding [...] "how they think they know everything <b>about</b> , <b>when</b> <b>they</b> don't. They want to be a fly on my wall and watch [...] 24/7." [...] Cyrus explained it was about attempting to avoid paparazzi but they appeared, [...] "not going away like little annoying flies." [...] Cyrus was inspired to write [...] "Bottom of the Ocean" [...] by her deceased fish, Lyric and Melody, who died when Cyrus was eleven years of age. She said the topic drifted drastically once she began writing. [...] "It's saying if there's someone you've loved but for some reason you can't love them anymore, you have to take your feelings, scoop them out, and put them {{at the bottom of the}} ocean." [...] Cyrus, Armato, James, Aaron Dudley co-wrote [...] "Wake Up America", a track about environmentalism. The song was directed towards [...] "the people in the back seat", children of today's generation; she said that, in the future, they would be the ones [...] "driving [...] Earth to what it's gonna be." [...] "It's the only one you got, so you gotta take care of it. And if you don't, there's gonna be, maybe not for you, right then, and your generation but your kids and their kids ... Every generation has a cycle that'll carry on for the rest of eternity", she concluded. Cyrus recorded a cover of Cheyenne Kimball's [...] "Four Walls" [...] from the album The Day Has Come (2006) for Breakout, titled [...] "These Four Walls".

2500|$|Schiller {{believes}} his pragmatism {{to be more}} developed because of its {{attention to the fact}} that the [...] "consequences" [...] which make up the meaning and truth of a statement, must always be consequences for someone's particular purposes at some particular time. Continuing his condemnation of the abstract, Schiller contends that the meaning of a concept is not the consequences of some abstract proposition, but what consequences an actual thinker hopes its use will bring about in an actual situation. The meaning of a thought is what consequences one means to bring <b>about</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> employ the thought. To Schiller, this is what a more sophisticated pragmatist understands by the term meaning.|$|E
2500|$|In The Creation of Patriarchy by Gerda Lerner, {{the author}} states that Aristotle {{believed}} that women had colder blood than men, which made women not evolve into men, the sex that Aristotle {{believed to be}} perfect and superior. Maryanne Cline Horowitz stated that Aristotle believed that [...] "soul contributes the form and model of creation." [...] This implies that any imperfection that is caused in the world must {{be caused by a}} woman because one cannot acquire an imperfection from perfection (which he perceived as male). Aristotle had a hierarchical ruling structure in his theories. Lerner claims that through this patriarchal belief system, passed down generation to generation, people have been conditioned to believe that men are superior to women. These symbols are benchmarks which children learn <b>about</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> grow up, and the cycle of patriarchy continues much past the Greeks.|$|E
