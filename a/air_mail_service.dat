5|$|Smith {{reported}} in his autobiography, during one run from Omaha to Cheyenne, {{that he had}} had to ditch into a pasture, landing on a cow. He sent a laconic telegram to his division supervisor at headquarters in College Park, Maryland, reporting the mishap. Crashes were part of the job. Engines were unreliable, and pilots were using road maps. Unpredictable, bad weather was a constant risk. In {{the first five years of}} US Post Office <b>air</b> <b>mail</b> <b>service</b> the average forced landing was every 800 miles and a pilot was killed about every 80,000 miles. Thirty-five pilots died during the Postal Service's operation of air mail flights; most deaths were between 1920 and 1925.|$|E
5|$|Smith was {{instrumental}} in the inauguration of the <b>air</b> <b>mail</b> <b>service</b> by the United States Postal Service (USPS) in the summer of 1919. He had logged 900 hours of flying time in the Army before he joined the U.S. Mail Service at age nineteen. His first assignment was to fly mail from Omaha, Nebraska, to California, essentially following the same route as the Oregon Trail. His mother had taken this trail by covered wagon from Council Bluffs, Iowa, to Cove, Oregon, in 1871. His mother and grandparents had taken two years to complete their trip, whereas Smith flew his route to California within a week with several stops along the way.|$|E

50|$|The Latécoère 28 was a {{successful}} French long-haul mail plane and passenger airliner of the 1930s.

25|$|Harold Frederick Pitcairn (1897–1960). Harold, {{a lifelong}} {{aviation}} enthusiast, started Pitcairn Aviation, an <b>air</b> <b>mail</b> <b>service</b> that ultimately grew into Eastern Airlines.

25|$|A 1922 {{graduate}} of the University of Illinois, {{he was one of}} the first university graduates to apply his degree to a career in aeronautics.

25|$|On March 19, 1976, the USPS {{issued a}} 13-cent First Class {{commemorative}} Postage Stamp (Scott #1684) honoring the 50th anniversary of U.S. commercial aviation launched with Contract <b>Air</b> <b>Mail</b> <b>service</b> over these two routes {{as well as}} on CAM-5 which was inaugurated next on April 6, 1926, over the 487-mile route between Pasco, Washington, and Elko, Nevada, with an intermediate stop in Boise, Idaho.|$|E

25|$|For {{several years}} the new field was used mainly for {{training}} and aerobatic flights. That would change in 1920 when the United States Postal Service (USPS) began <b>air</b> <b>mail</b> <b>service</b> to Salt Lake City.

25|$|During {{the survey}} {{he met the}} Federal Minister {{responsible}} for the Northern Territory, John McEwen, and discussed the role of air services in the region. Connellan agreed to a three-year trial of an <b>air</b> <b>mail</b> <b>service</b> between Alice Springs and Wyndham in Western Australia, which attracted a subsidy from the federal government. The mail run commenced on 11 July 1939 and was worked on a fortnightly return basis. Connellan also negotiated a contract to provide an Alice Springs-based Royal Flying Doctor Service.|$|E
25|$|Commercial <b>Air</b> <b>Mail</b> <b>service</b> {{commenced}} in the United Kingdom in 1919. By {{the early}} 1930s Imperial Airways was operating regular airmail services to Europe and the British colonies and dominions. To facilitate easy collection of air mail and its speedy onward transmission, {{a fleet of}} special vehicles and dedicated postboxes were introduced. To distinguish them from regular post boxes, they were painted Air Force blue, with prominent royal blue signage. The service ran successfully until the outbreak of war in 1939, when it was suspended. Although Air Mail re-commenced after the War, the postboxes and vehicles were no longer identifiable, as Air Mail could now be posted anywhere.|$|E
50|$|The {{airport was}} {{established}} in 1933 as Nairobi Aerodrome and was used by Imperial Airways Empire <b>air</b> <b>mail</b> <b>services</b> from the United Kingdom via Egypt and continuing in stages to South Africa.

50|$|In 1913 Albert S. Burleson was {{appointed}} Postmaster General by Woodrow Wilson. To his credit, he initiated the parcel post and <b>air</b> <b>mail</b> <b>services,</b> increasing <b>mail</b> <b>service</b> to rural areas. However, Burleson {{was one of}} the most reactionary politicians to have served as Postmaster General, which he demonstrated in ways that adversely affected national <b>mail</b> <b>service</b> and the government's civil service system based on merit. His term is often seen as one of the worst in the history of the post.|$|R

Their operation had the all-important landing rights for Havana, having acquired American International Airways, a small airline established in 1926 by John K. Montgomery and Richard B. Bevier as a seaplane service from Key West, Florida, to Havana. ACA met its deadline of having an <b>air</b> <b>mail</b> <b>service</b> operating by October 19, 1927 by chartering a Fairchild FC-2 floatplane from a small Dominican Republic carrier, West Indian Aerial Express.|$|E
25|$|Six large, {{long-range}} Boeing 314 flying {{boats were}} delivered to Pan Am in early 1939. On March 30, 1939, the Yankee Clipper, piloted by Harold E. Gray, {{made the first}} ever trans-Atlantic passenger flight. The first leg of the flight, Baltimore to Horta, took 17 hours and 32 minutes and covered 2,400 miles. The second leg from Horta to Pan Am's newly-built airport in Lisbon took 7 hours and 7 minutes and covered 1,200 miles. The Boeing 314 also enabled the start of scheduled weekly contract Foreign Air Mail (F.A.M. 18) service and later passenger flights from New York (Port Washington, L.I.) to both France and Britain. The Southern route to France was inaugurated for Air Mail on May 20, 1939 by the Yankee Clipper piloted by Arthur E. LaPorte flying via Horta, Azores and Lisbon, Portugal to Marseilles. Passenger service over the route was added on June 28, 1939 by the Dixie Clipper piloted by R.O.D. Sullivan. The Eastbound trip departed every Wednesday at Noon and arrived at Marseilles on Friday at 3 pm GCT with return service leaving Marseilles on Sunday at 8 am and arriving at Port Washington on Tuesday at 7 am. The Northern transatlantic route to Britain was inaugurated for <b>Air</b> <b>Mail</b> <b>service</b> on June 24, 1939 by the Yankee Clipper piloted by Harold Gray flying via Shediac (New Brunswick), Botwood (Newfoundland), and Foynes (Ireland) to Southampton. Passenger service was added on the Northern route on July 8, 1939 by the Yankee Clipper. Eastbound flights left on Saturday at 7:30 am and arrived at Southampton on Sunday at 1 pm GCT. Westbound service departed Southampton on Wednesday at Noon and arrived at Port Washington on Thursday at 3 pm. After the outbreak of World War II in Europe on September 1, 1939 the terminus became Foynes until the service ceased for the winter on October 5 while transatlantic service to Lisbon via the Azores continued into 1941. During the war Pan Am flew over 90 million miles (145 million kilometers) worldwide in support of military operations.|$|E
