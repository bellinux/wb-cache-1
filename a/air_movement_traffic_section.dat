50|$|RECAT Phase II is a {{continuation}} of the RECAT program that focuses on a larger variety of aircraft (123 ICAO type designators that make up more than 99% of US <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>movements</b> based on 32 US airports), as opposed to the 61 aircraft comprising 85% of operations from 5 US and 3 European airports that were used in RECAT Phase I. The fundamental underlying wake separations in RECAT Phase II are not defined per wake turbulence category, but actual individual pairs of make-model-series aircraft types (e.g. Boeing B747-400 leading Airbus A321). In the US, automation does not yet exist to allow air traffic controllers to utilize this pairwise separation matrix. Instead, RECAT Phase II takes advantage of the underlying matrix to redefine the RECAT Phase I-type categories (i.e. Categories A - F, with an additional Category G) for individual TRACONs. This allows further efficiency gains over RECAT I because it takes the fleet mix - which aircraft fly most often - into account for each site, rather than doing a global optimization for the US national airspace system as a whole. RECAT Phase II went operational on August 3, 2016 at Southern California TRACON and associated towers.|$|R

40|$|During {{the last}} decade, <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>movements</b> {{worldwide}} {{have experienced a}} tremendous growth. Future air traffic management concepts such as Free Flight have been proposed to provide {{a means by which}} traffic flow efficiency can be increased. Under Free Flight, the current methods of airways and way-points for separation assurance won’t exist, providing an aircraft pilot more flexibility to follow more optimized routes given the ever changing nature of a flight plan (bad weather, delays, special use airspace, and runway closure/emergencies etc.). In order to compensate for the loss of airway structure, automated conflict detection and resolution tools will be required to aid pilots in ensuring safety and smooth flow of air traffic. The main challenge is to develop a robust and efficient algorithm to achieve real time performance for large and complex scenarios in a Free Flight Airspace. This paper investigates preliminary design and implementation issues in two dimensions for evolutionary techniques in collision avoidance. Such techniques may find solutions in much a shorter time than classical collision avoidance algorithms.

The paper presents an overview of experimental and theoretical works on the cyclones having a particularly complex turbulent flow and focuses on three-dimensional transport differential equations for a non-compressible laminar and turbulent flow inside the cyclone. The equations have been solved applying the numerical finite volume method using the RNG (Re–Normalisation Group) k-ε turbulence model. The numerical simulation of the flow cyclone has been carried out. The height of the cyclone is 0. 80 m with 0. 33 m in diameter, {{the height of the}} spiral–cylindrical part – 0. 098 meters and that of the cone – 0. 45 m.
