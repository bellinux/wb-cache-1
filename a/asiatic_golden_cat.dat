50|$|Wild animals {{found in}} the park include Muntiacus Muntjak, wild boars, bears, langur, flying squirrel, gibbons, cobra, king cobra, rabbits, squirrels, tree shrews, red junglefowls, and <b>Asiatic</b> <b>golden</b> <b>cats.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{giant panda}} {{is the most}} famous species of the reserve. Other typical larger Carnivora are North-Chinese leopards, Ussuri dholes, Asian black bears, <b>Asiatic</b> <b>golden</b> <b>cats,</b> red pandas, hog badgers and yellow-throated martens. Hooved mammals are {{represented}} by Sichuan takins, wild boar, musk deer, mainland serows, Chinese gorals, tufted deer and sambar deer. Other noticeable mammals include golden snub-nosed monkeys, Tibetan macaques, complex-toothed flying squirrels, bamboo rats, and porcupines. Because the reserve comprises different altitudes, it includes tropical and temperate climate zones and harbors species typically for the tropics, like clouded leopards and sambar deer as well as species from temperate regions, like white-lipped deer, snow leopards and Turkestan lynxes.|$|R
40|$|There {{have been}} few {{targeted}} studies of small felids in Sumatra {{and there is little}} information on their ecology. As a result there are no specific management plans for the species on Sumatra. We examined data from a long-term camera trapping effort, and used Maximum Entropy Modeling to assess the habitat use and distribution of Sunda clouded leopards (Neofelis diardi), <b>Asiatic</b> <b>golden</b> <b>cats</b> (Pardofelis temminckii), leopard cats (Prionailurus bengalensis), and marbled cats (Pardofelis marmorata) in Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park. Over a period of 34, 166 trap nights there were low photo rates (photo events/ 100 trap nights) for all species; 0. 30 for <b>golden</b> <b>cats,</b> 0. 15 for clouded leopards, 0. 10 for marbled cats, and 0. 08 for leopard cats. There is overlap in the predicted distributions of clouded leopards, <b>golden</b> <b>cats,</b> and marbled cats; indicating areas of high conservation importance for these species within the park. The predicted distribution of leopard cats was discrete from the other species which is important to consider in the development of conservation strategies. This study provides important documentation of small felid distribution in Sumatra, information for the development of management strategies within the park, and a basis upon which to develop future research for the species...|$|R
50|$|This primate {{prefers to}} forage in larger trees {{of a tree}} species, and spends {{most of the time}} using primary forest and young forest, rarely uses shrub forest and does not use grassland. Even though they {{primarily}} forage in the trees and sometimes on the ground, they have several predators, including both mammals, such as dhole (Cuon alpinus), wolf (Canis lupus), <b>Asiatic</b> <b>golden</b> <b>cat</b> (Catopuma temmincki), and leopard (Panthera pardus), and birds, like golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos) and northern goshawk (Accipiter gentilis).|$|E

40|$|The dynamic {{geological}} and climatological {{history of}} Southeast Asia {{has spawned a}} complex array of ecosystems and 12 of the 37 cat species, making it the most felid-rich region in the world. To examine evolutionary histories of these poorly-known faunas, we compared phylogeography of six species (leopard cat Prionailurus bengalensis, fishing cat P. viverrinus, <b>Asiatic</b> <b>golden</b> <b>cat</b> Pardofelis temminckii, marbled cat P. marmorata, tiger Panthera tigris and leopard P. pardus) by sequencing over 5 kb of DNA each from 445 specimens at multiple loci of mtDNA, Y and X chromosomes. All species except the leopard displayed significant phylogenetic partitions between Indochina and Sundaland, with the central Thai-Malay Peninsula serving as the biogeographic boundary. Concordant mtDNA and nuclear DNA genealogies revealed deep Indochinese-Sundaic divergences around 2 MYA in both P. bengalensis and P. marmorata, which is comparable to some described interspecific distance in Felidae. The divergence coincided with serial sea-level rises during the late Pliocene and early Pleistocene, and was likely reinforced by repeated isolation events associated with environmental changes throughout the Pleistocene. Indochinese-Sundaic differentiations within P. tigris and P. temminckii were more recent at 72, 000 - 108, 000 y and 250, 000 - 1, 570, 000 y ago respectively. Overall these results illuminate the unexpected, deep vicariance events in Southeast Asian felids and provide compelling evidence of species-level distinction between the Indochinese and Sundaic populations in the leopard cat and marbled cat. Broader sampling and further molecular and morphometric analyses of these species will be instrumental for better defining conservation units and effectively preserving biodiversity in Southeast Asia...|$|E
50|$|The {{classification}} and phylogenetic {{relationships of}} the African <b>golden</b> <b>cat</b> has remained in dispute. It {{has historically been}} placed under Catopuma, Felis or Profelis. However, studies in 2006 and 2009 have showed that the African <b>golden</b> <b>cat</b> has a particularly {{close relationship with the}} caracal (Caracal caracal). These two species, together with the serval (Leptailurus serval), form one of the eight lineages of Felidae. This lineage evolved nearly 8.5 Mya. More recently, the African <b>golden</b> <b>cat</b> has been considered a species of Caracal. The African <b>golden</b> <b>cat</b> resembles the Asian <b>golden</b> <b>cat,</b> but are not closely related.|$|R

40|$|Background. The bay cat Catopuma badia is {{endemic to}} Borneo, whereas its sister species the Asian <b>golden</b> <b>cat</b> Catopuma temminckii is {{distributed}} from the Himalayas and southern China through Indochina, Peninsular Malaysia and Sumatra. Based onmorphological data, {{up to five}} subspecies of the Asian <b>golden</b> <b>cat</b> have been recognized, but a taxonomic assessment, including molecular data and morphological characters, is still lacking. Results. We combined molecular data (whole mitochondrial genomes), morphological data (pelage) and species distribution projections (up to the Late Pleistocene) to infer how environmental changes may have influenced the distribution of these sister species over the past 120 000 years. The molecular analysis was based on sequenced mitogenomes of 3 bay cats and 40 Asian <b>golden</b> <b>cats</b> derived mainly from archival samples. Our molecular data suggested a time of split between the two species approximately 3. 16 Ma and revealed very low nucleotide diversity within the Asian <b>golden</b> <b>cat</b> population, which supports recent expansion of the population. Discussion. The low nucleotide diversity suggested a population bottleneck in the Asian <b>golden</b> <b>cat,</b> possibly caused by the eruption of the Toba volcano in Northern Sumatra (approx. 74 kya), followed by a continuous population expansion in the Late Pleistocene/Early Holocene. Species distribution projections, {{the reconstruction of the}} demographic history, a genetic isolation-by-distance pattern and a gradual variation of pelage pattern support the hypothesis of a post-Toba population expansion of the Asian <b>golden</b> <b>cat</b> from south China/Indochina to PeninsularMalaysia and Sumatra. Our findings reject the current classification of five subspecies for the Asian <b>golden</b> <b>cat,</b> but instead support either a monotypic species or one comprising two subspecies: (i) the Sunda <b>golden</b> <b>cat,</b> distributed south of the Isthmus of Kra: C. t. temminckii and (ii) Indochinese, Indian, Himalayan and Chinese <b>golden</b> <b>cats,</b> occurring north of the Isthmus: C. t. moormensis...|$|R
40|$|Indonesia {{has one of}} {{the highest}} diversities of plants and animals in the world and nine of the eleven felid species present in Southeast Asia are found in Indonesia. Yet, Indonesia now leads the world in the number of {{threatened}} and endangered mammal and bird species, with new species constantly added to the list. The biggest factor driving the disappearance of wildlife in Indonesia is large-scale habitat loss and degradation. The country is losing its forests at the fastest rate of any nation in the world. In Sumatra alone, nearly 3. 1 million hectares of forest were lost in the past decade, and lowland forests have all but disappeared. In the face of continued habitat loss and fragmentation, and a continually increasing human population, it is becoming increasingly apparent that we have to gain some knowledge of these species on Sumatra in order to create effective conservation initiatives, else we risk losing them for good. ^ The present project was initiated to gain such information on small felids in Sumatra. There were three elements to our study: camera trapping, live trapping, and an analysis of human-felid conflict. The camera trapping portion of our study allowed the examination of the distribution, habitat preferences, and activity patterns of small felids on Sumatra. This is the first such information on these species from anywhere in their range and is invaluable to managers as they prioritize habitats for conservation. Our study was the first to attempt live trapping and collaring of small felid species in Sumatra, and one of a very few which had been conducted in the tropical forests of Asia. We were able to capture and collar the first golden cat ever collared in Indonesia, and only the third in the world. The information gained from tracking her movement once again provides invaluable information on the ecology of this species in Sumatra. Finally, we conducted surveys of human-small felid conflict around BBSNP. ^ Prior to our study, human conflict with small felids was not thought to be a major factor in their conservation in Southeast Asia because it was rarely reported to governmental officials. Our study is the first in Southeast Asia to characterize this conflict and its effect on the conservation of small felids in Sumatra. We also assessed the efficacy of simple education and mitigation techniques in reducing conflict, creating a successful model that can be replicated throughout the species range. Overall, this study provides valuable knowledge on the Sunda clouded leopard, the <b>Asiatic</b> <b>golden</b> <b>cat,</b> the marbled cat, and the leopard cat, generating information which may be used for their more effective conservation in Sumatra. ...|$|E
25|$|The Asian <b>golden</b> <b>cat</b> {{is similar}} to the bay cat of Borneo in both {{appearance}} and behavior. Genetic studies revealed that the two species are closely related. The Asian <b>golden</b> <b>cat</b> is found in Sumatra and Malaysia, which separated from Borneo only about 10,000 to 15,000 years ago. These observations led to the belief that the Borneo bay cat is an insular subspecies of the Asian <b>golden</b> <b>cat.</b> Genetic analysis has shown that the Asian <b>golden</b> <b>cat,</b> along with the bay cat and the marbled cat, diverged from the other felids about 9.4 million years ago, and that the Asian <b>golden</b> <b>cat</b> and bay cat diverged as long as four million years ago, suggesting that the bay cat was a different species long before the isolation of Borneo. Because of the evident close relationship with the marbled cat, it has recently been suggested that all three species should be grouped in the genus Pardofelis.|$|R
