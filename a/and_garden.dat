5|$|Sylvia warblers are {{unusual in}} that they vigorously defend their territories against other members of their genus as well as conspecifics. Blackcaps <b>and</b> <b>garden</b> warblers use {{identical}} habits in the same wood, yet aggressive interactions mean that their territories never overlap. Similar songs are {{a feature of the}} Sylvia warblers as a group, and {{it has been suggested that}} this promotes interspecific competition and helps to segregate territories between related species. It appears more likely from later studies that segregation of sympatric species, other than the blackcap <b>and</b> <b>garden</b> warbler, is due to subtle habitat preferences rather than interspecies aggression.|$|E

5|$|In some European countries, such as Belgium, France, and the Netherlands, the muskrat is {{considered}} an invasive pest, as its burrowing damages the dikes and levees on which these low-lying countries depend for protection from flooding.

5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that given its proportion of the waste stream and the lack of distinct collections, food waste is not currently being targeted appropriately. However proposals by the European Union, which would require local authorities to provide separate collection of food <b>and</b> <b>garden</b> waste, have been met with opposition; critics of the proposals argue that local authorities understand the specific needs of the areas they serve, and that they should decide waste policy. Advocates of the proposals say that it will ensure energy is not wasted in sorting biodegradable waste from other materials.|$|E
