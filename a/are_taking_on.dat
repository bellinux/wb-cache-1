2500|$|James and Steger {{assert that}} the concept of {{globalization}} [...] "emerged from the intersection of four interrelated sets of 'communities of practice' (Wenger, 1998): academics, journalists, publishers/editors, and librarians." [...] They note the term was used [...] "in education to describe the global life of the mind"; in international relations to describe the extension of the European Common Market; and in journalism to describe how the [...] "American Negro and his problem <b>are</b> <b>taking</b> <b>on</b> a global significance". They have also argued that four different forms of globalization can be distinguished that complement and cut across the solely empirical dimensions. According to James, the oldest dominant form of globalization is embodied globalization, the movement of people. A second form is agency-extended globalization, the circulation of agents of different institutions, organizations, and polities, including imperial agents. Object-extended globalization, a third form, is the movement of commodities and other objects of exchange. He calls the transmission of ideas, images, knowledge, and information across world-space disembodied globalization, maintaining that it is currently the dominant form of globalization. James holds that this series of distinctions allows for an understanding of how, today, the most embodied forms of globalization such as the movement of refugees and migrants are increasingly restricted, while the most disembodied forms such as the circulation of financial instruments and codes are the most deregulated.|$|E
2500|$|The Mother Jones {{magazine}} {{mentioned that}} the book's [...] "graphic and fast-paced history covers south-of-the-border trafficking from '60s-era shipments of Acapulco Gold to the decapitation-filled headlines wrought {{by the likes of}} kingpin (and alleged billionaire) Joaquín 'El Chapo' Guzmán and his rivals, the Zetas—special ops soldiers turned criminals". The progressive online magazine known as the Salon reported that the drug war violence in Mexico [...] "seldom makes the front page in the U.S" [...] newspapers. Nonetheless, they stated that many American officials are [...] "worried that the cartels <b>are</b> <b>taking</b> <b>on</b> aspects of an 'insurgency,' which could make them a threat to the Mexican government". The Salon noted that Grillo's book [...] "lays out the history of drug smuggling in the region over the past 100 years or so, and then homes in on the rise of the Northern Mexican cartels during the 2000s". Sylvia Longmire, a drug war analyst {{and author of the book}} Cartel: The Coming Invasion of Mexico's Drug Wars, said that one rarely comes across a writer like Grillo [...] "who really gets it". She said that Grillo also did an incredible job navigating Mexican politics and explaining the role of how the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) [...] " [...] and [...] along with the cartels, and how the transition to real democracy in 2000 dramatically altered that delicate balance". She also mentioned that Grillo proposes that the start of the Mexican Drug War did not start in 2006—a convenient historical marker because that's when Calderón took office, but rather in 2004 in Nuevo Laredo, where the Sinaloa cartel made incursions to fight off Los Zetas. Malcolm Beith, author of The Last Narco: Inside the Hunt for El Chapo, the World's Most Wanted Drug Lord, said that Grillo is the [...] "most intrepid and knowledgeable foreign journalist covering the drug war in Mexico today", and in El Narco, the author provides us with more than just a glimpse of Mexico's criminal underworld and its history. According to Beith, Grillo grants the readers [...] "access to the soul and mind of El Narco, as well as deftly explaining and providing new insight into this hemispheric war on drugs". Howard Campbell, professor in Anthropology at the University of Texas at El Paso and author of the book Drug War Zone: Frontline Dispatches from the Streets of El Paso and Juarez, said that Grillo [...] "puts a human face on the violent tragedy caused by U.S. drug demand and Mexican cartel criminality", and strongly recommends El Narco, a [...] "timely and troubling book".|$|E
