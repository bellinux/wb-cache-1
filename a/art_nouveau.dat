5|$|The Jugendstil, {{a variant}} of <b>Art</b> <b>Nouveau,</b> had a certain {{influence}} on {{much of the new}} construction in Norway {{around the turn of the}} 20th century. The city of Ålesund, after burning to the ground in 1904, was rebuilt almost entirely in this style and continues to be a prominent example, along with Riga and Brussels. Trondheim also has numerous <b>art</b> <b>nouveau</b> buildings. In the capital Oslo, few <b>art</b> <b>nouveau</b> buildings were erected, due to a local economic crisis and a stagnant building trade during the first decade of the century. However, some public buildings were constructed in this style, such as the Historical Museum and the Government office building. In Bergen, the main theatre Den Nationale Scene is a monumental example.|$|E

5|$|The {{building}} was {{designed in the}} <b>Art</b> <b>Nouveau</b> style, which {{was at that time}} a relatively new style and featured flowing, curvilinear designs often incorporating floral and other plant-inspired motifs. Horodecki featured such motifs in the building's exterior decor in the forms of mythical creatures and big-game animals. His work on the House with Chimaeras has earned him the nickname of the Gaudí of Kiev.|$|E
5000|$|Mission Design is {{characterized}} by straight, thick horizontal and vertical lines and flat panels. The most common material used in Mission furniture is oak.

5|$|Meanwhile, Norwich {{railway station}} had opened in 1844. Although many Norwich {{residents}} {{were reluctant to}} use the railway, and goods carriers initially found it more convenient to continue to collect goods from the coaching inns, as railway usage gradually {{increased the number of}} coaches and carts calling at the inns slowly dwindled, reducing congestion. In 1899 the Angel inn—renamed the Royal Hotel in 1840 on the occasion of Queen Victoria's wedding—finally closed, and was replaced with George Skipper's Royal Arcade, a shopping centre in the <b>Art</b> <b>Nouveau</b> style.|$|E

5|$|Architecture in Croatia {{reflects}} {{influences of}} bordering nations. Austrian and Hungarian influence {{is visible in}} public spaces and buildings {{in the north and}} in the central regions, architecture found along coasts of Dalmatia and Istria exhibits Venetian influence. Large squares named after culture heroes, well-groomed parks, and pedestrian-only zones, are features of these orderly towns and cities, especially where large scale Baroque urban planning took place, for instance in Osijek (Tvrđa), Varaždin and Karlovac. Subsequent influence of the <b>Art</b> <b>Nouveau</b> was reflected in contemporary architecture. Along the coast, the architecture is Mediterranean with a strong Venetian and Renaissance influence in major urban areas exemplified in works of Giorgio da Sebenico and Niccolò Fiorentino such as the Cathedral of St. James in Šibenik.|$|E
5|$|Levanger Station is {{the most}} {{spectacular}} station {{on the line and}} also the best preserved town station. Built entirely in stone, it has a dominant position in town and with a park in front of the station. It was designed in combined Medieval style, with strong elements of Gothic and Romanesque style. Steinkjer Station was the other station entirely built in stone. It has a combined Baroque Revival and <b>Art</b> <b>Nouveau</b> style, and is more anonymous than Levanger Station. Its characteristics were largely lost after it was connected with the bus station. Three stations, Langstein, Skogn and Levanger, have been preserved, while Skatval and Hell have been protected.|$|E

5|$|The <b>Art</b> <b>Nouveau</b> Chadderton Baths was {{a public}} {{swimming}} facility opened in 1937. Henry Taylor, the British Olympic freestyle swimming triple gold medallist and champion was an attendant at Chadderton Baths where many of his awards were displayed. Chadderton Baths were closed indefinitely in 2006 after a structural survey found faults which could have put the public at risk. Chadderton Sports Centre, built onto the Baths, was closed and replaced by the Chadderton Wellbeing Centre in January 2010. An application to demolish the Baths was made in March 2011, but is now in private ownership with conversion work due soon. The Wellbeing Centre is a multi-purpose facility with a swimming pool, dance studio, library, gym, meeting rooms, and café.|$|E
5|$|The {{stations}} {{were designed by}} Paul Due (1835–1919) and his son, Paul Armin Due (1870–1926). Original stations between Stjørdal and Levanger were designed by Paul Due, while those from Rinnan to Byafossen, as well as Hell Station, were designed by Paul Armin Due. The designs are characterized by the transition period between Dragestil and <b>Art</b> <b>Nouveau,</b> with early stations dominated more by the former and later stations more by the latter. Norway went through a nationalistic period during the construction, and Paul Due chose to replace his older buildings' foreign elements with traditional Norwegian elements. Røra and Byafossen were the only stations not custom designed, while Sunnan was designed by Peter Andreas Blix—as it was originally built at Hell in 1881.|$|E
5|$|When {{industrialisation}} {{spread across}} Europe, Classicism and a distinctive style of historism developed in Germany, {{sometimes referred to}} as Gründerzeit style, due to the economical boom years {{at the end of the}} 19th century. Regional historicist styles include the Hanover School, Nuremberg Style and Dresden's Semper-Nicolai School. Among the most famous of German buildings, the Schloss Neuschwanstein represents Romanesque Revival. Notable sub-styles that evolved since the 18th century are the German spa and seaside resort architecture. German artists, writers and gallerists like Siegfried Bing, Georg Hirth and Bruno Möhring also contributed to the development of <b>Art</b> <b>Nouveau</b> at the turn of the 20th century, known as Jugendstil in German.|$|E

40|$|Few {{months before}} he entered the art world by setting in plaster the {{remaining}} unsold copies of his book of poetry Pense-Bête, Marcel Broodthaers wrote in November 1963 the article Gare au défi! where he linked Pop Art’s concern with art and consumerism {{to the influence of}} Magritte’s works on American artists such as George Segal and Jim Dine. In the following years Broodthaers engaged in an ongoing reflection on Pop <b>Art</b> and <b>Nouveau</b> Réalisme that ended more or less with the exhibition Court Circuit in 1967. For the catalogue, Pierre Restany contributed the text J’attends ton coup de fil, Marcel! to which the artist replied ironically with the work Coup de Fil à Pierre Restany, a telephone wrapped in cotton. Departing from this mute ‘dialogue’ between the artist and the critic, the paper will discuss the ambiguous relationship that Broodthaers had with Pop <b>Art</b> and <b>Nouveau</b> Réalisme in relation to major concerns such as the commodity character of art and the concept of the ready-made...|$|R
