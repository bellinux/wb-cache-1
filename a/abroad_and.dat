5|$|The primary duty of {{the foreign}} {{ministry}} was directing the general line of Soviet foreign policy. The MER represented the country <b>abroad</b> <b>and</b> participated in talks with foreign delegations {{on behalf of the}} Soviet government. It also appointed diplomatic officers, with the exception of Soviet ambassadors, who were appointed by the Council of Ministers. The MER was responsible for taking care of the USSR's economic and political interests abroad, although economic interests were also the joint responsibility of the Ministry of Foreign Trade. The State Committee of the Council of Ministers on Cultural Links with Foreign Nations and the Ministry of Culture worked jointly with the MER in regards to the protection of Soviet citizens abroad, the exercise of overall Soviet consular relations <b>abroad</b> <b>and</b> the promotion of Soviet culture abroad. A less visible {{duty of the}} MER was its role in the coordination of Soviet intelligence operations abroad.|$|E

The only group of stones comparable in number to the Greece runestones are those that mention England, followed by the c. 26 Ingvar runestones raised {{in the wake of the}} fateful Ingvar expedition to Persia.|$|E

In 1922 she became a fellow of the French Academy of Medicine. She also travelled to other countries, appearing publicly and giving lectures in Belgium, Brazil, Spain, and Czechoslovakia.|$|E

5|$|In 1939, the Department of Justice {{created the}} Civil Rights Section, which focused {{primarily}} on First Amendment and labor rights. The increasing scrutiny of totalitarianism in the lead-up to World War II brought increased attention to issues of slavery and involuntary servitude, <b>abroad</b> <b>and</b> at home. The U.S. sought to counter foreign propaganda and increase its credibility on the race issue by combatting the Southern peonage system. Under the leadership of Attorney General Francis Biddle, the Civil Rights Section invoked the constitutional amendments and legislation of the Reconstruction Era {{as the basis for}} its actions.|$|E

The film was a moderate financial success in Japan, but a larger one <b>abroad</b> <b>and,</b> {{as he had done}} with Kagemusha, Kurosawa embarked on a trip to Europe and America, where he attended the film's premieres in September and October.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to this, the ACWF {{played an important}} role internationally for the CPC. As a communist country in the Cold War, China had difficulty establishing diplomatic connections. ACWF was able to reach out to women’s movements <b>abroad,</b> <b>and</b> even hosted 23 delegations {{from other parts of the}} world for the Asia Women’s Representative Conference in December 1949. This enabled the PRC to go around the diplomatic blockade and forge connections with other countries. However, soon the Cultural Revolution would begin in China, which forced the ACWF to discontinue many of its policies.|$|E

5|$|Into modern times, {{his legacy}} has {{remained}} {{more pronounced in}} Ireland and Scotland than in his native Norway. Among the few domestic developments known during his reign, Norway developed a more centralised rule and {{moved closer to the}} European model of church organisation. Popularly portrayed as a Viking warrior rather than a medieval monarch, Magnus was the last Norwegian king to fall in battle <b>abroad,</b> <b>and</b> he may in some respects be considered the final Viking king.|$|E
5|$|Kirchner {{also changed}} the {{extradition}} policy, allowing extradition for people prosecuted <b>abroad</b> <b>and</b> not facing charges in Argentina. He also supported the requests by {{human rights organizations}} to turn the former detention centers into memorials for the disappeared. Argentina became a signatory of the UN Convention on the Non-Applicability of Statutory Limitations to War Crimes and Crimes Against Humanity in 2003. A creative interpretation of the convention by the courts allowed them to circumvent the statutory limitations to crimes committed decades in the past, and also the ex post facto applicability of laws that were not in force {{at the time of}} the crimes.|$|E
