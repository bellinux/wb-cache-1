5|$|Cercaria mirabilis, a trematode, has <b>an</b> <b>especially</b> large {{larval stage}} (known as a cercarium) which looks {{much like a}} small {{crustacean}} or mosquito larva. It also mimics the locomotory behavior of such animals, allowing it to be eaten by predaceous fish.|$|E

5|$|English has {{a strong}} {{influence}} on the vocabulary of other languages. The influence of English comes from such factors as opinion leaders in other countries knowing the English language, the role of English as a world lingua franca, and {{the large number of}} books and films that are translated from English into other languages. That pervasive use of English leads to a conclusion in many places that English is <b>an</b> <b>especially</b> suitable language for expressing new ideas or describing new technologies. Among varieties of English, it is especially American English that influences other languages. Some languages, such as Chinese, write words borrowed from English mostly as calques, while others, such as Japanese, readily take in English loanwords written in sound-indicating script. Dubbed films and television programmes are <b>an</b> <b>especially</b> fruitful source of English influence on languages in Europe.|$|E

5|$|HMS Agincourt was a {{dreadnought}} battleship {{built in}} the United Kingdom in the early 1910s. Originally part of Brazil's role in a South American naval arms race, she held the distinction of mounting more heavy guns (fourteen) and more turrets (seven) than any other dreadnought battleship, {{in keeping with the}} Brazilians' requirement for <b>an</b> <b>especially</b> impressive design.|$|E

One of the younger Polish students at this gymnasium was the future Russian communist leader Feliks Dzierżyński, who later would become Piłsudski's arch-enemy.|$|E
5|$|Manasa is <b>an</b> <b>especially</b> {{important}} deity in Bengal for the mercantile castes.

5|$|While some LARPs {{are open}} to {{participants}} of all ages, others have a minimum age requirement. There are also youth LARPs, specifically intended for children and young people.

5|$|Back in Washington, both Scully and Mulder {{report to}} Section Chief McGrath, {{who does not}} believe their claims. McGrath offers <b>an</b> <b>especially</b> harsh {{reprimand}} to Mulder, and presents written testimony by Henderson claiming that Max's {{body was found in}} a cargo container. McGrath and his disciplinary board decide to shut down the X-Files and dismiss Mulder from the FBI, but the decision is vetoed by Deep Throat, who feels it would be more dangerous for them to allow Mulder to turn whistleblower than to let him continue his work.|$|E
5|$|Based on {{morphological}} features, the Alexandrine parakeet (Psittacula eupatria) {{has been}} proposed as the founder population for all Psittacula species on Indian Ocean islands, with new populations settling during the species' southwards colonisation from its native South Asia. Features of that species gradually disappear in species further away from its range. Subfossil remains of Newton's parakeet show that it differed from other Mascarene Psittacula species in some osteological features, but also had similarities, such as a reduced sternum, which suggests a close relationship. Skeletal features indicate <b>an</b> <b>especially</b> {{close relationship with the}} Alexandrine parakeet and the rose-ringed parakeet (Psittacula krameri), but the many derived features of Newton's parakeet indicates it had long been isolated on Rodrigues.|$|E
5|$|Buildings entirely {{designed}} by Palladio {{are all in}} Venice and the Veneto, with <b>an</b> <b>especially</b> rich grouping of palazzi in Vicenza. They include villas, and churches such as Redentore in Venice. In Palladio's architectural treatises he followed the principles defined by the Roman architect Vitruvius and his 15th-century disciple Leon Battista Alberti, who adhered to principles of classical Roman architecture based on mathematical proportions rather than the rich ornamental style also characteristic of the Renaissance.|$|E

5|$|In 1381 the Peasants' Revolt {{broke out}} in England, during which Gaunt was {{targeted}} by the rebels as <b>an</b> <b>especially</b> hated member of the administration. He found himself stranded {{in the north of}} England {{in the early part of}} the revolt but considered Dunstanburgh insufficiently secure to function as a safe haven, and was forced to turn to Alnwick Castle instead, which refused to let him in, fearing that his presence would invite a rebel attack.|$|E
5|$|La Blanca {{occupied}} a frontier zone between the northeastern and southeastern Petén regions {{and the site}} {{is dominated by the}} acropolis, <b>an</b> <b>especially</b> well built palace complex. The city appears to have been an administrative centre with comparatively little emphasis upon religious or ceremonial activity. It is likely that La Blanca was a subsidiary of a major Maya city such as Yaxha or Naranjo, given the complete absence of hieroglyphic texts and sculpted monuments, and archaeologists presume that La Blanca served as a frontier post or trading centre.|$|E
5|$|Monument 11 {{is located}} in the southwestern area of Terrace3, to the east of Structure8. It is a natural boulder carved with a {{vertical}} series of five hieroglyphs. Further left is a single hieroglyph and the glyphs for the number11.

5|$|Most of the {{enlargement}} of the primate brain comes from a massive expansion of the cerebral cortex, especially the prefrontal cortex and {{the parts of the}} cortex involved in vision. The visual processing network of primates includes at least 30 distinguishable brain areas, with a complex web of interconnections. It has been estimated that visual processing areas occupy {{more than half of the}} total surface of the primate neocortex. The prefrontal cortex carries out functions that include planning, working memory, motivation, attention, and executive control. It takes up a much larger proportion of the brain for primates than for other species, and <b>an</b> <b>especially</b> large fraction of the human brain.|$|E
5|$|Natural lead {{consists}} of four stable isotopes with mass numbers of 204, 206, 207, and 208, and traces of five short-lived radioisotopes. The high number of isotopes is consistent with lead's atomic number being even. Lead has a magic number of protons (82), for which the nuclear shell model accurately predicts <b>an</b> <b>especially</b> stable nucleus. Lead-208 has 126 neutrons, another magic number, {{which may explain why}} lead-208 is extraordinarily stable.|$|E
5|$|One point {{still at}} issue is the {{position}} of Ch'olan and Q'anjobalan–Chujean. Some scholars think these form a separate Western branch (as in the diagram below). Other linguists {{do not support the}} positing of <b>an</b> <b>especially</b> close relationship between Ch'olan and Q'anjobalan–Chujean; consequently they classify these as two distinct branches emanating directly from the proto-language. An alternative proposed classification groups the Huastecan branch as springing from the Ch'olan-Tzeltalan node, rather than as an outlying branch springing directly from the proto-Mayan node.|$|E
