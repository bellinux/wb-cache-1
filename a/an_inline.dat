5|$|Designs were {{submitted}} {{in response to}} the Navy's specifications by Vought-Sikorsky and Curtiss-Wright. The Vought design, designated Model 403 by the company, was similar to the company's OS2U Kingfisher, which was then under development to replace the SOC aboard U.S. Navy battleships, but had its monoplane wing moved higher on the fuselage than that of the Kingfisher, and differed in the attachment method used by its single-float landing gear. In addition, the radial engine of the OS2U was replaced by <b>an</b> <b>inline</b> Ranger V-770 in a squared-off cowling.|$|E
5|$|Next, {{the train}} passes through two {{consecutive}} horseshoe turns, {{first to the}} right and then to the left. As the name suggests, Horseshoe turns are highly banked horseshoe-shaped turns which feature track entering from roughly the same direction as where it exits. As the train exits the second horseshoe, it swoops down and begins a 270-degree helix to the right, which leads into the ride's second inversion, <b>an</b> <b>inline</b> twist. The inline twist sees riders perform a full rotation around the track, starting from a position where they are facing downward. After completing the twist, the train reaches the brake run and a final right-hand turn that leads back into the station.|$|E

5|$|Green Lantern Coaster {{begins with}} a u-turn out of the station. It ascends a chain lift hill before going down a small dip and into an s-bend {{followed}} by a u-turn. After a slight ascent, the car enters a 120.5° drop – the steepest in the southern hemisphere. The track then returns to approximately two thirds of its original height before entering {{the first set of}} block brakes. These brakes lead into a left turn with reverse or outward banking. It then drops under the block brakes and into the first inversion – a Dive Loop. The inversion begins with half of <b>an</b> <b>inline</b> twist which transitions into half of a vertical loop. Upon exiting the inversion the track inclines into a second set of block brakes. The train then goes around a right u-turn and into the second inversion – a downwards inline twist. This leads into a cutback-style turnaround before entering the final brake run and returning to the station.|$|E
5|$|The MiG-1 was {{designed}} {{in response to}} a requirement for a high-altitude fighter with <b>an</b> <b>inline</b> engine issued by the VVS in January 1939. Initially the aircraft, designated I-200, {{was designed}} in the Polikarpov construction bureau. Work started in June 1939, under the direction of Nikolai Polikarpov and his assistant M. Tetivikin. Polikarpov himself preferred radial engines and promoted his I-180 design at that time, but when the powerful Mikulin AM-37 inline engine became available, he decided to use it in a fighter. The approach that he selected was to build the smallest possible aircraft around the intended powerplant, thereby minimizing weight and drag — the philosophy of the light fighter. As specified, the aircraft was to be capable of reaching 670km/h (417mph). In August 1939, Polikarpov fell out of favor with Joseph Stalin and as a result, when Polikarpov went in November 1939 to tour Germany's aviation works, the Soviet authorities decided to scatter his construction team and create a new Experimental Construction Section (OKO), headed by Artem Mikoyan and Mikhail Gurevich, which remained formally subordinated to the Polikarpov bureau until June 1940. Further work upon the I-200 design was assigned to Mikoyan and Gurevich, who later became recognized — not with full justice — as its designers.|$|E

40|$|<b>Inlining</b> {{trials are}} <b>a</b> general {{mechanism}} for making better automatic decisions {{about whether a}} routine is profitable to inline.

The results of inlining trials are stored in a persistent database to be reused when making future inlining decisions at similar call sites.

40|$|<b>Inlining</b> is <b>an</b> {{important}} optimization {{for programs}} that use procedural abstraction. Because inlining trades code size for execution speed, {{the effectiveness of}} <b>an</b> <b>inlining</b> algorithm is determined not only by its ability to recognize inlining opportunities but also by its discretion in exercising those opportunities. This paper presents <b>a</b> new <b>inlining</b> algorithm for higher-order languages that combines simple analysis techniques with demand-driven online transformation to achieve consistent and often dramatic performance gains in fast linear time. Benchmark results reported here demonstrate that this inlining algorithm is as effective as and significantly faster than offline, analysis-intensive algorithms recently described in the literature...|$|R

25|$|In 1990, {{the base}} model was dropped {{in favor of}} a sedan version (replacing the 6000 which ended {{production}} the next year and the Canada-only Tempest), entering production on September 12, 1989. A notable introduction for the Grand Prix in 1990 is the new STE (Special Touring Edition) which replaced the STE model of the Pontiac 6000. In contrast to that model, it trades in all-wheel-drive for the available Turbo 3.1L V6. Standard features include a cassette stereo with equalizer and eight speakers (a compact disc player was optional), remote keyless entry, eight-way power driver's seat with multiple lumbar and sidewing adjustments for both front seat occupants, and a compass/trip computer that was more informative than the units in the SE and turbo coupes. An LE sedan was also available for 1990, standard with a 2.3L Quad 4 engine and a 3-speed automatic, the first use of <b>an</b> <b>inline</b> 4 cylinder engine in a Grand Prix. The 2.8L V6 engine was discontinued, while the 3.1L engine gained widespread availability and a standard five-speed manual transmission.|$|E

40|$|While {{inlining}} {{is one of}} {{the heavily}} used optimizations for compiling Java programs, its overly aggressive usage can actually hurt the program performance. Therefore, the inlining heuristics used in various Java virtual machines need to be appropriately tuned in order to maximize inlining benefits without introducing its potential cost. However, the current tuning process is usually performed manually, which can not achieve the optimal solution. Several algorithms (e. g., the genetic algorithm) have been developed to automate the tuning process, but most of them are very time-consuming due to the large number of parameters used in <b>an</b> <b>inlining</b> heuristic. In this paper, we use multivariate statistical methods to find the parameters which actually impact the performance of <b>an</b> <b>inlining</b> heuristic. By focusing on these ”effective ” parameters, we can greatly shorten the tuning process and further simplify the original inlining heuristic while maintaining the similar performance. ...|$|R
