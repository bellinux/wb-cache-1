5|$|Baleen whales, {{primarily}} juveniles and calves, are preyed on by killer whales. It {{is thought}} that annual whale migration occurs to protect the calves from the killer whales. There have also been reports of a pod of killer whales attacking and killing an adult bowhead whale, by holding down its flippers, covering the blowhole, and ramming and biting until death. Generally, a mother and calf pair, {{when faced with the}} threat of a killer whale pod, will either fight or flee. Fleeing only occurs in species that can swim away quickly, the rorquals. Slower whales must fight the pod alone or with a small family group. There has been one report of a shark attacking and killing <b>a</b> <b>whale</b> calf. This occurred in 2014 during the sardine run when a shiver of dusky sharks attacked a humpback whale calf. Usually, the only shark that will attack <b>a</b> <b>whale</b> is the cookie cutter shark, which leaves a small, non-fatal bite mark.|$|E

5|$|Day-to-day {{killer whale}} {{behaviour}} generally consists of foraging, travelling, resting and socializing. Killer whales engage in frequent behaviour {{at the surface}} such as breaching (jumping {{completely out of the}} water) and tail-slapping. These activities may have a variety of purposes, such as courtship, communication, dislodging parasites, or play. Spyhopping, a behaviour in which <b>a</b> <b>whale</b> holds its head above water, helps the animal view its surroundings.|$|E
5|$|In 1896, {{an article}} in The Pall Mall Gazette popularised a {{practice}} of alternative medicine that probably began in the whaling town of Eden, Australia {{two or three years}} earlier. It was believed that climbing inside <b>a</b> <b>whale</b> carcass and remaining there for a few hours would relief symptoms of rheumatism.|$|E
5|$|In autumn, Granpa and Emily went fishing, and {{imagined}} of catching <b>a</b> <b>whale</b> that haled {{them through the}} Thames and through London. At bedtime, Granpa tells Emily the story of The Three Knights, of which was imagined on a bed covers. Though as he reads, he begins to slow up as he begins to drop off. So he end it with his own version, just as Emily was finally going to sleep.|$|E

5|$|Portus Abonae was a Roman port at {{the mouth}} which {{provided}} an embarkation point for journeys across the River Severn to South Wales. In the 18th century there were short lived attempts at creating a port and <b>a</b> <b>whale</b> fishery here. The name Trym appears to have Anglo-Saxon roots. In recent years silting problems, caused by urban development have caused some difficulties, but alleviation works have helped reduce the problem.|$|E
5|$|Rorquals use throat pleats {{to expand}} their mouths, which allow them to feed more effectively. However, {{rorquals}} need to build up water pressure in order {{to expand their}} mouths, leading to a lunge-feeding behavior. Lunge-feeding is where <b>a</b> <b>whale</b> rams a bait ball (a swarm of small fish) at high speed. Rorquals generally have streamlined physiques to reduce drag in the water while doing this.|$|E
5|$|The Great New York City Fire of 1845 {{broke out}} on July 19, 1845.

It reached a warehouse on Broad Street where combustible saltpeter was stored and caused a massive explosion that spread the fire even farther.|$|E

5|$|Because she is <b>a</b> <b>whale</b> {{and most}} other {{characters}} are small tide pool organisms, Pearl is depicted as extraordinarily tall and heavy. Her size {{compared to the other}} characters is often used for visual gags; for example, she is able to shake the entire Krusty Krab when she jumps and can fill the entire building with tears when she cries. The floors of the Krabs' residence are equipped with drain plugs so the house can be emptied after Pearl cries or spouts water from her blowhole.|$|E
5|$|Pearl is {{a teenage}} sperm whale {{who lives in}} an anchor with her greedy father Mr. Krabs, {{the founder of the}} popular Krusty Krab {{restaurant}}. Pearl will inherit the restaurant and become its owner when she grows older. She is currently employed at the town shopping center, the Bikini Bottom Mall. The identity and whereabouts of Pearl's unseen mother have never been explained directly by the characters. While supplemental materials indicate her father married <b>a</b> <b>whale</b> who gave birth to Pearl, Hillenburg is strongly against revealing this in an episode.|$|E

5|$|Some teleosts are parasites. Remoras {{have their}} front dorsal fins {{modified}} into large suckers {{with which they}} cling onto a host animal such as <b>a</b> <b>whale,</b> sea turtle, shark or ray, but this is probably a commensal rather than parasitic arrangement because both remora and host benefit from the removal of ectoparasites and loose flakes of skin. More harmful are the catfish that enter the gill chambers of fish and feed on their blood and tissues. The snubnosed eel, though usually a scavenger, sometimes bores into the flesh of a fish, and has been found inside {{the heart of a}} shortfin mako shark.|$|E
5|$|The Koryak {{of eastern}} Siberia {{have a story}} about the fly agaric (wapaq) which enabled Big Raven to carry <b>a</b> <b>whale</b> to its home. In the story, the deity Vahiyinin ("Existence") spat onto earth, and his spittle became the wapaq, and his saliva becomes the warts. After {{experiencing}} the power of the wapaq, Raven was so exhilarated that he told it to grow forever on earth so his children, the people, could learn from it. Among the Koryaks, one report said that the poor would consume the urine of the wealthy, who could afford to buy the mushrooms.|$|E
5|$|Whale tail is the Y-shaped {{waistband}} of a thong or G-string when visible above the waistline of low-rise jeans, shorts, or a skirt {{that resembles a}} whale's tail. Intentionally or unintentionally, <b>a</b> <b>whale</b> tail is exposed above the trousers mostly when sitting or bending, or even while standing. The frequency or occasion depends on the style of trousers, the style of underwear, {{and the way they}} are worn. Displaying whale tails became popular in the early 2000s, together with the rise of low-rise jeans and thong underwear. The trend, popularized by a number of female celebrities including Christina Aguilera, Victoria Beckham, Mariah Carey, Paris Hilton and Britney Spears, waned within the decade.|$|E

5|$|When on the beach, most of {{them get}} stuck. Those that have {{remained}} too far in the water are dragged onto the beach by putting a hook in their blowhole. When on land, they are killed by cutting down to the major arteries and spinal cord at the neck. The {{time it takes for}} <b>a</b> <b>whale</b> to die varies from a few seconds Up to half a minute, depending on the cut. If the locals fail to beach the animals altogether, they are let free again.|$|E
5|$|After {{the second}} lacuna, Hymir {{is sitting in}} the boat, unhappy and totally silent, as they row back to shore. On shore, Hymir {{suggests}} that Thor should help him carry <b>a</b> <b>whale</b> back to his farm. Thor picks both the boat and the whales up, and carries it all back to Hymir's farm. After Thor successfully smashes a crystal goblet by throwing it at Hymir's head on Týr's mother's suggestion, Thor and Týr are given the cauldron. Týr cannot lift it, but Thor manages to roll it, and so with it they leave. Some distance from Hymir's home, an army of many-headed beings led by Hymir attacks the two, but are killed by the hammer of Thor. Although one of his goats is lame in the leg, the two manage to bring the cauldron back, have plenty of ale, and so, from then on, return to Ægir's for more every winter.|$|E
5|$|As marine {{creatures that}} reside {{in either the}} depths or the poles, humans {{knew very little about}} whales over the course of history; many feared or revered them. The Nords and various arctic tribes revered the whale as they were {{important}} pieces of their lives. In Inuit creation myths, when 'Big Raven', a deity in human form, found a stranded whale, he was told by the Great Spirit where to find special mushrooms that would give him the strength to drag the whale back to the sea and thus, return order to the world. In an Icelandic legend, a man threw a stone at a fin whale and hit the blowhole, causing the whale to burst. The man was told not to go to sea for twenty years, but during the nineteenth year he went fishing and <b>a</b> <b>whale</b> came and killed him.|$|E
