500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} {{addresses}} {{the end of}} a marriage between Beyoncé's parents Tina Knowles and Mathew Knowles.

He adds that its message could hopefully remind people that they have a choice when they arise in the morning whether to pursue their own choice of activities for the day, or to do what they should do or are obliged to do. Keira Knightley feels that the film's story is alarming, but has said that the film is [...] "more about humanity's ability to look the other way".

500|$|Originally, [...] "Castle Walls" [...] {{belonged to}} Diddy, who had {{commissioned}} the song for his fifth album Last Train to Paris with his group Dirty Money.

I think this speaks volumes to where you are, what you going through, what you living <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> feel." [...] Consequently, Christina Aguilera was chosen as the featured guest on the song, which appeared on T.I.'s album No Mercy. Alex da Kid, producer of the song, said about the collaboration, [...] "I love it. I think it's amazing. It's my sound, just kind of an evolution of that. I think it'll cater to a lot of different people." [...] T.I. told RapFix Live about the track's inspiration: ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Q magazine, lead singer Chris Martin stated that [...] "In My Place" [...] was a song Coldplay had left after recording their debut album Parachutes (2000). When the band finished recording their second album A Rush of Blood to the Head, Martin said that the album was complete. However, after guitarist Jonny Buckland played the song on his guitar, Martin said that they now needed to record it and include it on the album. Martin also said that: [...] "That's about where you're put in the world, and how you're given your position, {{and the way you}} look, <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> have to get on with it." [...] In {{an interview}}, Buckland revealed that the song was hard to record, as the band had played the song live. He also commented that when they started recording the song, they did not know how it should sound, due to the band members' contrasting ideas.|$|E

500|$|Vig {{recalled}} that the title [...] "Not Your Kind of People" [...] {{came to him}} when he was stuck in a traffic jam in Los Angeles; he texted Manson the idea for a title and she loved it. Manson wrote all the lyrics that night, and the next day the four of them gathered with acoustic guitars and wrote the music to the song in about half an hour. Manson explained that the album title Not Your Kind of People was [...] "a call to arms in a way to anyone who feels like we do about the world", saying that [...] "it can be great to be outsider." [...] She felt that this applied to them as the band [...] "never fit into a music scene" [...] and that [...] "in my life I've never been an insider." [...] Manson also described the title as [...] "a two-fingered salute to people who reject or criticize us", stating the band was [...] "only really interested in people who share our outlook" [...] as she considered that their fans were [...] "the people who connect with what you're saying <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> say it." ...|$|E
500|$|However, the {{commonly}} reported {{statement that the}} action scenes are continuous shots is not entirely true. [...] Visual effects supervisor Frazer Churchill explains that the effects team had to [...] "combine several takes to create impossibly long shots", where their job was to [...] "create {{the illusion of a}} continuous camera move." [...] Once the team was able to create a [...] "seamless blend", they would {{move on to the next}} shot. [...] These techniques were important for three continuous shots: the coffee shop explosion in the opening shot, the car ambush, and the battlefield scene. [...] The coffee shop scene was composed of [...] "two different takes shot over two consecutive days"; the car ambush was shot in [...] "six sections and at four different locations over one week and required five seamless digital transitions"; and the battlefield scene [...] "was captured in five separate takes over two locations". Churchill and the Double Negative team created over 160 of these types of effects for the film. [...] In an interview with Variety, Cuarón acknowledged this nature of the [...] "single-shot" [...] action sequences: [...] "Maybe I'm spilling a big secret, but sometimes it's more than what it looks like. The important thing is how you blend everything <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> keep the perception of a fluid choreography through all of these different pieces." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2010, Nas {{released}} his tenth studio album Distant Relatives, a collaboration with Damian Marley that reinvigorated the rapper creatively. He soon became distracted by tax problems and an expensive, highly publicized divorce {{from his wife}} Kelis months before their son's birth, events that influenced his direction for Life Is Good. His songwriting on the album was also influenced by adjusting back to life as a single man. Nas also wanted to write more original subject matter rather than another album [...] "about how you {{came up in the}} hood <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> had to make it out of the hood". Although he did not find his album [...] "quite so much about the marriage or the divorce", Nas likened Life Is Good to Marvin Gaye's 1978 album Here, My Dear, which was written by Gaye in response to his own deteriorating marriage and released as a financial settlement. For Life Is Goods album cover, a photo was taken of Nas in a polished white suit, sitting in a night club's VIP lounge, appearing forlorn, and holding over his knee Kelis' actual green wedding dress, which he said was the only item she left him. When writing the album, Nas also reflected on aging and maturation, fatherhood, and his 20-year experience in hip hop music. Nas discussed the album's personal subject matter in an interview for Billboard: ...|$|E

500|$|Another {{important}} {{theme in}} many of García Márquez's work is {{the setting of the}} village he calls Macondo. He uses his home town of Aracataca, Colombia as a cultural, historical and geographical reference to create this imaginary town, but the representation of the village is not limited to this specific area. García Márquez shares, [...] "Macondo {{is not so much a}} place as a state of mind, which allows you to see what you want, <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> want to see it." [...] Even when his stories do not take place in Macondo, there is often still a consistent lack of specificity to the location. So while they are often set with [...] "a Caribbean coastline and an Andean hinterland... otherwise unspecified, in accordance with García Márquez's evident attempt to capture a more general regional myth rather than give a specific political analysis." [...] This fictional town has become well known in the literary world. As Stavans notes of Macondo, [...] "its geography and inhabitants constantly invoked by teachers, politicians, and tourist agents..." [...] makes it [...] "...hard to believe it is a sheer fabrication." [...] In Leaf Storm García Márquez depicts the realities of the Banana Boom in Macondo, which include a period of great wealth during the presence of the US companies and a period of depression upon the departure of the American banana companies. As well, One Hundred Years of Solitude takes place in Macondo and tells the complete history of the fictional town from its founding to its doom.|$|E
500|$|The fifth track, [...] "The Other Side", has churning, chunky guitars, a double-bass {{drum and}} Lee's [...] "ethereal, widescreen" [...] vocals with {{elements}} of R. Lyrically, the song's theme is death. [...] "Erase This", formerly titled [...] "Vanilla", was noted by Mary Ouellette of Loudwire as an [...] "uptempo rocker" [...] similar to [...] "What You Want" [...] which would sound better played live {{rather than through}} earphones. [...] "Lost in Paradise" [...] is a symphonic rock ballad which begins with piano, strings and Lee's unlayered vocals before adding the band for the song's climax; its lyrics reflect Lee's past struggles, apologizing to her fans for the band's five-year absence. The song's musical structure was compared to [...] "Jóga", by the Icelandic recording artist Björk. [...] "Sick" [...] has a loose, lazy melody and a chanted chorus; {{one of the first}} songs written for the album, it [...] "set a heavy direction {{for the rest of the}} record." [...] "End of the Dream" [...] begins [...] "full bore with chunky guitar, then falls into a brooding grove with piano underpinning Lee's unmistakable vocals." [...] In the chorus, Lee sings [...] "Follow your heart 'til it bleeds," [...] evincing the track's [...] "seize the day" [...] message. Lee said about the song, [...] "It's about understanding that this life isn't forever, <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> have to live it, embrace even the pain, before it's all over. As much as it hurts, it just means you're alive. So don't be so afraid to get hurt that you miss out on living." [...] "Oceans" [...] begins with a big, low synth and a vocal before the band joins in. According to Lee, [...] "It's big and lush. We've been having a lot of fun playing that one especially." [...] "Never Go Back" [...] (originally called [...] "Orange") examines [...] "loss from the perspective of someone losing someone in a tragedy". Lee said that the song, with the lyrics [...] "It's all gone, the only world I've ever known", was inspired by the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami. [...] "Swimming Home" [...] is an electro-pop song with grinding guitars and a [...] "weeping" [...] piano.|$|E
