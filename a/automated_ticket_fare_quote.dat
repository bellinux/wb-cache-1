40|$|AbstractAs {{a public}} service facility, the social and {{economic}} benefits of urban rail transit <b>ticket</b> <b>fare</b> are both important, so reasonable <b>ticket</b> <b>fare</b> is a key for the solid development of urban rail transit. The social and economic benefits should be taken into account under the competitive condition led by various modes of transportation in order to get an optimal strategy in <b>ticket</b> <b>fare</b> pricing of urban rail transit on the premise of meeting the service quality standard. Here, the factors considered in the <b>ticket</b> <b>fares</b> fare pricing of urban rail transit in the domestic and foreign cities are summarized, after which the Logit model of the mode split within the public transit system is established. With considering both the respective benefits of the urban rail transit company and the travellers, a bi-level programming model is established together with the solution idea to the model with the particle swarm optimization algorithm. The example demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of the bi-level programming model and the related measures and the particle swarm ooptimization aalgorithm is fittable for the urban rail transit fare pricing. The suggestions proposed from the result of the example are helpful for the decision making of <b>ticket</b> <b>fare</b> pricing of urban rail transit...|$|R

40|$|High-speed rail (HSR) has {{developed}} rapidly in China over the recent years, {{for the less}} pollution, faster speed, comfort, and safety. However, there is still an issue {{on how to improve}} the seat occupancy rates for some HSR lines. This research analyzes the pricing strategy for HSR in Wuhan-Guangzhou corridor based on the competition among different transport modes with the aim of improving occupancy rates. It starts with the theoretical analysis of relationship between market share and <b>ticket</b> <b>fare,</b> and then disaggregate choice models with nested structure based on stated preference (SP) data are established to obtain the market share of HSR under specific <b>ticket</b> <b>fare.</b> Finally, a pricing strategy is proposed to improve the occupancy rates for Wuhan-Guangzhou HSR. The results confirm that a pricing strategy with floating fare should be accepted to improve the profit of HSR; to be specific, the <b>ticket</b> <b>fare</b> should be set in lower level on weekdays and higher level on holidays...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: Nowadays, governments {{around the}} world are active in {{constructing}} the high-speed railway. Therefore, it is significant to make research on this increasingly prevalent transport. Design/methodology/approach: In this paper, we simulate the process of the passenger’s travel mode choice by adjusting the <b>ticket</b> <b>fare</b> and the run-time based on the multi-agent system (MAS). Findings: From the research we get the conclusion that increasing the run-time appropriately and reducing the <b>ticket</b> <b>fare</b> in some extent are effective ways to enhance the passenger sharing of the high-speed railway. Originality/value: We hope it can provide policy recommendations for the railway sectors in developing the long-term plan on high-speed railway in the future. </p...|$|R
