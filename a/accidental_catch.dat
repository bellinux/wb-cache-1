50|$|The lined seahorse {{species was}} listed as {{vulnerable}} since 1996 and {{was listed as}} vulnerable in the 2003 IUCN assessment, indicating no significant improvements in protective factors. Due to loss or harm to their habitat by pollution and coastal development, <b>accidental</b> <b>catch,</b> or by purposeful catch, the lined seahorse's population is starting to dwindle, by values of at least thirty percent, probably since 1996 when changes in its population size were noted. The H. erectus is a very common species of the aquarium trade, which also affects the population remaining in the wild, though the vast majority {{for sale in the}} aquarium trade are captive-reared. The lined seahorse is also used for ornamental decoration and for Chinese medicine. Despite being a popular seahorse for aquarium trade and Chinese medicine, it is only suspected that the species could be a potential candidate for commercial aquaculture. If successful, this could positively affect the population of the lined seahorse.|$|E

2500|$|Beginning in the 1950s {{dams and}} {{thousands}} of kilometres of dikes were built for flood control, land reclamation, irrigation and for the control of diseases vectors such as blood flukes that caused Schistosomiasis. More than a hundred lakes were thus {{cut off from the}} main river. There were gates between the lakes that could be opened during floods. However, farmers and settlements encroached on the land next to the lakes although it was forbidden to settle there. When floods came, it proved impossible to open the gates since it would have caused substantial destruction. Thus the lakes partially or completely dried up. For example, Baidang Lake shrunk from [...] in the 1950s to [...] in 2005. Zhangdu Lake dwindled to one quarter of its original size. Natural fisheries output in the two lakes declined sharply. Only a few large lakes, such as Poyang Lake and Dongting Lake, remained connected to the Yangtze. Cutting off the other lakes that had served as natural buffers for floods increased the damage done by floods further downstream. Furthermore, the natural flow of migratory fish was obstructed and biodiversity across the whole basin decreased dramatically. Intensive farming of fish in ponds spread using one type of carp who thrived in eutrophic water conditions and who feeds on algae, causing widespread pollution. The pollution was exacerbated by the discharge of waste from pig farms as well as of untreated industrial and municipal sewage. In September 2012, the Yangtze river near Chongqing turned red from pollution. The erection of the Three Gorges Dam has created an impassable [...] "iron barrier" [...] that has led to a great reduction in the biodiversity of the river. Yangtze sturgeon use seasonal changes in the flow of the river to signal when is it time to migrate. However, these seasonal changes will be greatly reduced by dams and diversions. Other animals facing immediate threat of extinction are the Baiji Dolphin, finless porpoise and the Yangtze Alligator. These animals numbers went into freefall from the combined effects of <b>accidental</b> <b>catches</b> during fishing, river traffic, habitat loss and pollution. In 2006 the baiji dolphin became extinct; the world lost an entire genus.|$|R

Small-scale fishing {{plays an important role}} in the national economy of Senegal. The fishing gear used has a potentially direct or indirect impact on seabirds. To examine and evaluate this impact surveys were conducted on eight landing sites. Field surveys (2 - 3 days) took place in 2015 based on a standardized interview with questionnaire conducted with 225 small-scale fishermen. The results obtained indicate that longlines are the fishing gear that causes the highest rate of annual <b>accidental</b> seabird <b>catch</b> (63 % of seabird caugth (n = 702)), followed by handlines (16 %) and anchored gillnet (6 %). The Pomarine Skua (Stercorarius pomarinus) is the most captured bird annually (29 % of total captured birds), closely followed by the Cory's Shearwater (Calonectris diomedea) (28 % of captured birds) and the Northern Gannet (Morus bassanus) (13 % of captured birds). The village of Yoff is the landing site which has the highest rate of annual seabird catch with 39 % of the total catch indicated, followed by Kayar with 19 % and Saint Louis with 14 %, both situated on the Grande Côte. Further studies should be conducted in the entire Senegalese-Mauritanian coast in particular in the northern part of Senegal, to better evaluate the annual catch of seabirds.

40|$|Freshwater {{crayfish}} {{are found}} in 20 out of 53 Prefectures of Greece (38 %) and they form isolated populations in relatively pristine water bodies. Three indigenous crayfish species (ICS) occur in Greek waters: Astacus astacus, Astacus leptodactylus and Austropotamobius torrentium, {{as well as one}} non-indigenous crayfish species (NICS) Pacifastacus leniusculus. Greece represents probably the most southern natural distribution limit for A. astacus and A. torrentium in the world. Concerning NICS, P. leniusculus was imported, at least in two cases, from Sweden and Germany during the early and late 1980 ’s respectively, in order to replace A. astacus stocks impoverished by human activities. Recently, Cherax quadricarinatus specimens have been seen in a restaurant’s aquarium and pet shop, raising fears about uncontrolled imports of alien pet species. During our 2004 - 2005 survey, we found that P. leniusculus established not only a thriving population in the artificial Lake Agra (Region of Central Macedonia), but also they co-occur with A. torrentium there. It is also suspected that A. astacus may co-occur there with these two species, as three large male specimens of A. astacus were caught in a creek close to the lake. Concerning A. leptodactylus, there are three sets of preserved samples from the River Evros (state border with Turkey in Thrace today), dated back to the 19 th century, but no recent information about occurrence was available. But the <b>accidental</b> <b>catch</b> of six specimens of A. leptodactylus during May 2005 in that river re-documented the occurrence of the species.

40|$|Molluscs {{constitute}} one of {{the most}} diverse and best represented invertebrate groups in the marine environment. In the northern sectors of the Alborán Sea and Gulf of Cádiz 1200 spp. of the 1800 spp. occurring in the Mediterranean Sea, have been found so far highlighting the importance of this area for the european molluscan fauna (Gofas et al., 2011). Molluscs are also the second group in abundance and biomass in demersal fisheries and an important component of soft-bottom benthic communities, including ecologically important and/or commercial mollusc species that are also exposed to an increasing trawling impact (Snelgrove, 1998; Kaiser & De Groot, 1999). Previous studies on molluscs of the Alborán Sea has primarily focused on those from infralittoral habitats, with few studies focussing on the composition, structure and dynamics of circalittoral and bathyal molluscan assemblages (Rueda et al., 2015). The study of soft bottom molluscan assemblages where trawling fishing fleet operates is important for improving the fisheries evaluation and management, as well as the implementation of ecosystemic and biodiversity conservation measures {{in the context of the}} new Marine Strategy Framework Directive. In the present study, the distribution and inter-annual variability of molluscan assemblages of circalittoral and bathyal soft bottoms of the Alborán Sea have been analyzed as well as the relationships of fauna with different environmental variables. Samples were collected in 190 otter trawl hauls performed between “Punta Europa” and “Cabo de Gata”, including the Alborán Ridge, at depths from 30 to 800 m during four MEDITS-ES trawl surveys in spring between 2012 and 2015. Several environmental variables from the water column (temperature and salinity) and sediment samples were taken where each haul was performed in order to elucidate their relationships with the molluscan assemblages. Abundances of each species (individuals. h- 1) of each haul and trawl survey were pooled in a matrix for performing multivariate methods in order to contrast molluscan assemblages of different sites and years. The Bray-Curtis similarity index was then used to perform non-parametric multidimensional scaling ordinations (nMDS). A fourth root transformation pretreatment was applied on the quantitative data in order to minimize the contribution of the most abundant species to the analyses. Analyses of similarities (ANOSIM) were carried out for statistical comparisons of groups of samples according to different factors (e. g. year, location). Analyses of similitude percentage (SIMPER) were used to identify those species that contributed to the similarity and dissimilarity between groups of samples according to factors. These multivariate analyses were executed using the PRIMER v 6 (Plymouth Routines in Multivariate Ecological Research). Average values of abundance of molluscs (N), species richness (S), Shannon-Wiener diversity index (H’: log 2), evenness index (J’) and taxonomic distinctness index (Δ*) were calculated for each sample group. Statistical differences between these values were tested with the non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis using SPSS software. The relationships between environmental variables and molluscs abundance in the different hauls were only studied for the 2014 trawl survey using a correspondence canonical analysis (CCA). The statistical significance of the adjusted CCA was assessed using a Monte Carlo permutation test. Prior to this, the environmental variables were screened and those which presented a correlation higher than 0. 9 (after a Spearman correlation analysis) were not further considered. These analyses were executed using the R software. Three main molluscan assemblages were detected and belonged to the: I) Continental Shelf (30 - 200 m); II) Upper Continental Slope (201 - 350 m), and III) Middle Continental Slope (351 - 800 m). The multivariate analyses revealed geographical differences within the Alborán Sea, being these differences more acute between the Alborán Island, mainly in the shallower assemblages (30 - 200 m and 201 - 350 m) and the remaining locations considered. These differences were due to a lower abundance in the island of species that were dominant in the continental margin, such as Alloteuthis media, Sepietta oweniana and Turritella communis and a higher abundance in the island of species that were less abundant in the continental margin, such as Neopycnodonte cochlear, Arca tetragona, Loligo forbesii and Sepia orbignyana. No significant differences of the abundance, biomass, species richness and diversity index were detected in the assemblages over the four years. Nevertheless, significant abundance declines of A. media, S. oweniana, and increases of N. cochlear were detected in the continental shelf over the years as well as abundance declines of Bathypolipus sponsalis and Galeodea rugosa in the slope assemblages. Regarding the environmental variables, the shallower assemblage (30 - 200 m) showed a significantly higher temperature, lower salinity and wider variety of sediment types than the others, with a predominance of sandy mud textures followed by muddy sand. As depth increases the sedimentary heterogeneity decreases, with dominant muddy sediments. Depth, temperature and mud percentage were the key variables that better explained the variability of the molluscan assemblage in the CCA. In conclusions: (1) Acute geographical differences occurred between the Alborán Island and the locations of the continental margin, due to its location far from the continental influence and, therefore, with lower fisheries activity and a less muddy and more bioclastic sediment, (2) Inter-annual trends in the abundance, biomass, species richness and diversity of assemblages were not detected, but some species displayed inter-annual changes due to biological aspects or <b>accidental</b> <b>catch</b> of gregarious species and (3) depth and some sedimentological variables displayed the most significant relationships with the molluscan assemblages, as previously observed for other invertebrate assemblages in the Alborán Sea...|$|E
40|$|This {{issue of}} International Journal L&E (Labor & Engenho) {{is a special}} issue where were {{published}} the major papers presented at the XI Brazil-Japan International Workshop, which happened {{in the city of}} Caraguatatuba [Brazil] in the 11 th of past September, in the campus of IFSP (Federal Institute of Education, Science and Technology of Sao Paulo). The objective of this event has been to discuss about actual information of government, private and academic programs in the following areas: Energy, Biomass and Biofuel; Sustainable agriculture, Fishery and Coastal Management; Sanitary Engineering, Environment and Water Management; Immigration and Cooperation between Brazil and Japan: Education, Science and Technology. And it has been an important vehicle for researches and developments sharing among researchers from both the countries. In the immigration context, the event has regarded the historic relationship among both the countries: Brazil and Japan, their high-level technological shares and mainly the Brazilian program called Ciência sem Fronteiras (Science without borders), which reinforces the knowledge sharing among the academic institutions from both the countries and contributes to the innovation projects development. This issue of L&E was the first one entire written in English. And it presents a set of ten papers from Brazilian and Japanese researchers, which consolidates L&E as an International Journal once more. The first article written by Shirley Pacheco de Souza addresses the theme of “payment for environmental services” (PES), and she suggests the adoption of strategies involving interested fishers in bycatch monitoring programs, where fishers could collect local data on the critical areas and frequency of dolphins’ <b>accidental</b> <b>catches,</b> consequently increasing their awareness of the problem and providing a better baseline to support educational and regulatory measures related to cetaceans’ bycatch, which would contribute to cetaceans’ conservation and to the fishers' economic stability as well. In the second article, by Alessandra Carvalho, José Neto, Luciana Moura, Gisele Fernandes, Marilu Figueiredo and Elaine Faria, it is regarded to perform a diagnosis of the soil usage as well as the state of preservation of the water resources of Juqueriquerê River’s watershed, in Caraguatatuba, Estate of Sao Paulo. The analysis of the data allowed the contrast between the degradation areas {{and the quality of the}} water resources.   They have stated that safety policies, respect of the soil usage and the proper application of environmental management plans are essential to achieve the sustainable use of the natural resources. Vassiliki Boulomytis and Claudia Alves present in the third article a proper methodology for the assessment of potato plantation areas, taking the short time of procedure into consideration, as the period between the plantation and the harvest occurs in six months the furthest. Considering the availability of LANDSAT medium resolution images, methods for their appropriate classification were used to provide effective target detection for potato plantation areas in the city of Bueno Brandão, Estate of Minas Gerais. The fourth article written by Dante Junior, Geraldo Filho and Maria Seydell presents the potential for wind power generation in the town of Caraguatatuba, Estate of Sao Paulo. The statistical analysis of wind speed has contributed to this evaluation. The authors stated that the average power of the wind speed is favorable to the installation of wind turbines in all seasons. The fifth article presents the research conducted by Beatriz Antoniassi, Nathalie Miranda, Raúl Uribe and Márcia Chaves. They show the analyzes of water from the streams Água Comprida, Vargem Limpa, Ribeirão Vargem Limpa and Bauru River between the center and the industrial district of the city of Bauru, Estate of Sao Paulo. For this comparative analysis, they have conducted a quantitative and qualitative study in partnership with the Bauru Department of Water and Sewerage (DAE) in the Wastewater Laboratory. By the analysis of the water quality it was possible to evaluate the quality of water, thus informing the public about the serious problems that persist in the region and how an industrial district affects the water quality of a city. In the sixth article, Larissa Meira and Herlane Calheiros presents an overview of the use of the construction waste, which should receive special attention in the management of solid waste, the removal of this gas, presenting a potential field of study, given the high rates and low efficiency obtained cost of implementation and operation. Egont Schenkel, Eric Fujiwara, Murilo Santos, Eduardo Ono and Carlos Suzuki highlight in the seventh article the use of photocatalysts. The authors have aimed to the use of the Rietveld refinement for quantifying the mass fraction present in titania nanoparticles obtained by the flame aerosol method. They have observed that the methodology of flame aerosol is effective for controlling the growth of anatase and rutile phases by just controlling the gas flow in the burner: fraction of anatase / rutile with relative errors smaller than 10 % was obtained by Rietveld refinement. Finally, in the eighth article, Eliane Grigoletto and Araí Pécora present a literature review involving soldering processes and describes the lead toxicity from related residue. The main solder alloy that is nowadays used to substitute tin-lead and European Directives also presented in this work as well. We hope you enjoy this issue and join us in the upcoming issues.
