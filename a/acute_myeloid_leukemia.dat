5|$|<b>Acute</b> <b>myeloid</b> <b>leukemia</b> is a {{relatively}} rare cancer. There are approximately 10,500 new cases {{each year in the}} United States, and the incidence rate has remained stable from 1995 through 2005. AML accounts for 1.2% of all cancer deaths in the United States.|$|E

5|$|Base J (beta-d-glucopyranosyloxymethyluracil), a {{modified}} form of uracil, {{is also found}} in several organisms: the flagellates Diplonema and Euglena, and all the kinetoplastid genera. Biosynthesis of J occurs in two steps: in the first step, a specific thymidine in DNA is converted into hydroxymethyldeoxyuridine; in the second, HOMedU is glycosylated to form J. Proteins that bind specifically to this base have been identified. These proteins appear to be distant relatives of the Tet1 oncogene that is involved in the pathogenesis of <b>acute</b> <b>myeloid</b> <b>leukemia.</b> J appears to act as a termination signal for RNA polymerase II.|$|E
5|$|The disease-modifying {{treatments}} {{have several}} adverse effects. One {{of the most}} common is irritation at the injection site for glatiramer acetate and the interferons (up to 90% with subcutaneous injections and 33% with intramuscular injections). Over time, a visible dent at the injection site, due to the local destruction of fat tissue, known as lipoatrophy, may develop. Interferons may produce flu-like symptoms; some people taking glatiramer experience a post-injection reaction with flushing, chest tightness, heart palpitations, and anxiety, which usually lasts less than thirty minutes. More dangerous but much less common are liver damage from interferons, systolic dysfunction (12%), infertility, and <b>acute</b> <b>myeloid</b> <b>leukemia</b> (0.8%) from mitoxantrone, and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy occurring with natalizumab (occurring in 1 in 600 people treated).|$|E

40|$|Since the {{discovery}} of the BCR-ABL 1 fusion gene in chronic <b>myeloid</b> <b>leukemia,</b> many more fusion genes resulting from chromosomal rearrangements have been identified and characterized. The study of these fusion genes has been extremely important for our understanding of the role of chromosomal rearrangements in leukemogenesis and in oncology in general. In chronic <b>myeloid</b> <b>leukemia,</b> or related myeloproliferative malignancies caused by the expression of oncogenic fusion kinases, tyrosine kinase inhibitors are now successfully used to treat these diseases. In <b>acute</b> <b>myeloid</b> <b>leukemias,</b> the presence of chromosomal rearrangements, oncogenic fusion genes and point mutations in key oncogenic drivers has important prognostic value and determines the choice of therapy.

25|$|Development of {{secondary}} neoplasia after successful chemotherapy or radiotherapy treatment can occur.

25|$|There is {{evidence}} {{for the role of}} miR-1-2 as a modulator in <b>acute</b> <b>myeloid</b> <b>leukemia</b> via its transcription by the zinc-finger transcription factor, EVI1, ectopic virus expression site 1.

However, only miR-1-2 was involved in abnormal proliferation in EVI1 expressing cell lines.|$|E

40|$|Background: Occurrence of {{aberrant}} phenotype {{has been}} reported in acute leukemias with varying frequency though its prognostic importance remains controversial. In <b>acute</b> <b>myeloid</b> <b>leukemias,</b> aberrant phenotype, as high as 88 %, {{has been reported}}. To evaluate the occurrence of aberrant lymphoid phenotypes and to correlate their presence with various French American British classification, 100 cases of fresh <b>acute</b> <b>myeloid</b> <b>leukemias</b> were analyzed for lymphoid markers CD 4, 7, 8, 10 and 19. Materials and Methods: Whole blood or bone marrow aspirate collected in EDTA were processed by standard method and subjected to immunophenotyping for B Cells marker CD 19 and 10 and T cell marker CD 4, 7 and 8. Results: Aberrant lymphoid markers were seen in 35 (35 %) cases. All FAB subtypes except M 7 showed aberrancy for the markers studied. However it was the most common in M 0 (100 %), followed by M 2 (51. 9 %). T cell aberrancy was the most common, comprising 62. 8 % (22 / 35) of total aberrancy. CD 7 was the most common aberrantly expressed marker, seen in 20 % AML, followed by CD 4 (14 %) and CD 19 (8 %). Conclusion: Occurrence of lymphoid phenotypes is frequent in pediatric as well adult AML. Though T cell markers are more common, only B cell as well as both B and T cell markers may be co expressed.
