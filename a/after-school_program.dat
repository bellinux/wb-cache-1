The announcement of the new organization came just {{before the start of}} the foundation's first fundraiser, the Michael Vick Golf Classic. The inaugural event was held at the prestigious Kingsmill Golf Course in James City County near Williamsburg, Virginia in partnership with The Virginia Tech Alumni Association Tidewater Chapter, and raised more than $80,000 for charity. According to its 2006 federal tax return, the Michael Vick Foundation provided 100 backpacks to poor children in Newport News and paid for an <b>after-school</b> <b>program.</b> The foundation spent 12% of its 2006 budget – $20,590 of $171,823 – on charitable programs and paid its fundraiser, Susan Bass Roberts, a former spokeswoman for Vick, $97,000. The foundation ceased operations that year. One of Vick's financial advisors withdrew $50,000 – most of the remaining funds – from its checking account in 2008.|$|E

40|$|An Analysis of Student Achievement and the 21 st Century Community Learning Center <b>After-school</b> <b>Programs</b> in a Southeastern North Carolina School System (Under the {{direction}} of Virginia Dickens). ^ There {{is a need for}} working parents to find affordable, safe and structured after-school care for their children. Research has shown <b>after-school</b> <b>programs</b> are successful in providing recreational experiences, cultural activities, and in some programs, tutorial assistance (Delisio, 2001). Since the enactment of the No Child Left Behind Act in 2000 (Coleman Advisory, 2002), emphasis is being placed on developing <b>after-school</b> <b>programs</b> that focus on student academic achievement. The federally funded 21 st Century Community Learning Center (21 st CCLC) <b>after-school</b> <b>programs</b> offer support to schools with high numbers of students at risk for school failure (Lacey, 2000). These programs give participating students both a safe haven for after school hours and also additional time allocated to support their academic achievement. As school principals seek to ensure all students within their schools have maximum opportunities to perform well on accountability measures required of today 2 ̆ 7 s students, principals should have a keen interest in <b>after-school</b> <b>programs</b> that can supplement the efforts of school day programs. The {{purpose of this study was}} to analyze student achievement, as measured by the North Carolina End-of-Grade (EOG) tests scores in reading and mathematics, by student gender and minority status, in 21 st CCLC <b>after-school</b> <b>programs</b> in a southeastern North Carolina school system. This descriptive analytical study made use of a database compiled from the five schools participating in the 21 st CCLC <b>after-school</b> <b>programs</b> in the school system. The student sample population consisted of 400 students in grades three through eight who participated in the <b>after-school</b> <b>programs</b> during 2002 - 2004 and who had complete data in the database related to achievement tests scores, gender and minority status. Four hypotheses were analyzed using one-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). The analyses of the data revealed no statistically significant differences between male and female or minority and non-minority program participants in achievement tests scores in reading and mathematics. The results of this study add to the information and existing literature on the academic achievement of students participating in federally funded 21 st CCLC <b>after-school</b> <b>programs.</b> ...|$|R

Specifically, this study will investigate best practice components for <b>after-school</b> <b>programs</b> and will attempt to determine if select <b>after-school</b> <b>programs</b> in Rhode Island provide proven best practices for students in need. This study attempts to define and identify “best practices” by examining existing literature that has studied <b>after-school</b> <b>programs</b> as an intervention strategy for closing the achievement gap. In doing so, it will be determined if select <b>after-school</b> <b>programs</b> in Rhode Island are offering programs for students in need which fulfill the best practices proven to be effective in serving students and closing the achievement gap.
