60|$|The {{house of}} Suddhoo, near the Taksali Gate, is two-storied, with four carved windows of old brown wood, and a flat roof. You may {{recognize}} it by five red hand-prints arranged like the Five of Diamonds on the whitewash between the upper windows. Bhagwan Dass the grocer {{and a man}} who says he gets his living by seal-cutting live in the lower story with a troop of wives, servants, friends, and retainers. The two upper rooms used to be occupied by Janoo and Azizun and a little black-and-tan terrier that was stolen from an Englishman's house and given to Janoo by a soldier. To-day, only Janoo lives in the upper rooms. Suddhoo sleeps on the roof generally, except when he sleeps in the street. He used to go to Peshawar in the cold, weather to visit his son who sells curiosities near the Edwardes' Gate, and then he slept under a real mud roof.

6000|$|The bird then {{bent over}} its questioner, as a stork does over the {{nestling}} newly fed when it {{looks up at}} her, and then wheeling round, and renewing its warble, concluded it with saying, [...] "As my notes are to thee that understandest them not, so are the judgments of the Eternal to thine earthly brethren. None ever yet ascended into these heavenly regions that {{did not believe in}} Christ, either after he was crucified or before it. Yet many, who call Christ! Christ! shall at the last day be found less near to him than such as knew him not. What shall the kings of Islam say to your Christian kings, when they see the book of judgment opened, and hear all that is set down in it to their dishonour? In that book shall be read the desolation which Albert will inflict on Bohemia:[26]--in that book, the woes inflicted on Paris by that <b>adulterator</b> of his kingdom's money, who shall die by the hog's teeth:--in that book, the ambition which makes such mad fools of the Scotch and English kings, that they cannot keep within their bounds:--in that book, the luxury of the Spaniard, and the effeminate life of the Bohemian, who neither knows nor cares for any thing worthy:--in that book, the lame wretch of Jerusalem, whose value will be expressed by a unit, and his worthlessness by a million:--in that book, the avarice and cowardice of the warder of the Isle of Fire, in which old Anchises died; and that the record may answer the better to his abundant littleness, the writing shall be in short-hand; and his uncle's and his brother's filthy doings shall be read in that book--they who have made such rottenness of a good old house and two diadems; and there also shall the Portuguese and the Norwegian be known for what they are, and the coiner of Dalmatia, who beheld with such covetous eyes the Venetian ducat. O blessed Hungary, if thou wouldst resolve to endure no longer!--O blessed Navarre, if thou wouldst but keep out the Frenchman with thy mountain walls! May the cries and groans of Nicosia and Famagosta be an earnest of those happier days, proclaiming as they do the vile habits of the beast, who keeps so close {{in the path of the}} herd his brethren." ...|$|E
5000|$|William Hardaker, {{known to}} locals as [...] "Humbug Billy", sold sweets from a stall in the Greenmarket in central Bradford (now {{the site of}} Bradford's Arndale Centre). Hardaker {{purchased}} his supplies from Joseph Neal, who made the sweets (or [...] "lozenges") on Stone Street {{a few hundred yards}} to the north. The lozenges in question were peppermint humbugs, made of peppermint oil incorporated into a base of sugar and gum. However, sugar was expensive (6½d per pound) and so Neal would substitute powdered gypsum (½d per pound) — known as [...] "daff" [...] — for some of the required sugar. The adulteration of foodstuffs with cheaper substances was common at the time and the <b>adulterators</b> used obscure nicknames ("daff", [...] "multum", [...] "flash", [...] "stuff") to hide the practice.|$|R

In the new economy that puts anemphasis on the importance the information the smooth progress and capital accumulation, the information requiresaccess to everything that represents it and thus becomes an enabling tool for counterfeit products. But information ensures access to everything it represents and becomes a favored instrument for fraudulentwork of counterfeiting. Counterfeiting already represent a scourge that affects more and more domains of activity, putting in dangernot only economical activities, but also consumer’s health and safety. Among products that are more likely to becounterfeited we can identify alimentary products, drugs, automobiles, IT, electronics and house appliances, music,movies, cigarettes, textiles, cosmetics, toys, games, software etc. After integration in the European Union, Romaniamust follow the rules imposed and to fight against counterfeiting and intellectual theft. The disappearance of frontiersallowed <b>adulterators</b> to bring counterfeited product in most markets that in many situations generated real economicaland social catastrophes through the decline of local industries. In order to reduce substantially the international commerce with counterfeited products and to destroytransnational networks involved in this commerce, a series of measures for protection is needed at national andinternational level...|$|R
500|$|The pivot {{of central}} European saffron trade moved to Nuremberg. The merchants of Venice {{continued}} their {{rule of the}} Mediterranean sea trade, trafficking varieties from Sicily, France and Spain, Austria, Crete and Greece, and the Ottoman Empire. Adulterated goods also made the rounds: those soaked in honey, mixed with marigold petals, or kept in damp cellarsall to add quick and cheap bulk. Irritated Nuremberg authorities passed the Safranschou code to de-louse the saffron trade. <b>Adulterators</b> were thus fined, imprisoned, and executedby immolation. England was next to have its turn as a major producer. One theory {{has it that the}} crop spread to the coastal regions of eastern England in the 14th century AD during the reign of Edward III. In subsequent years saffron was fleetingly cultivated throughout England. Norfolk, Suffolk, and south Cambridgeshire were especially affected with corms. Rowland Parker provides an account of its cultivation in the village of Foxton during the 16th and 17th centuries, [...] "usually by people holding a small amount of land"; an acre planted in saffron could yield a crop worth a kingly 6, making it [...] "a very profitable crop, provided that plenty of unpaid labor was available; unpaid labor was one of the basic features of farming then and for another two centuries." ...|$|R
6000|$|Now it {{is evident}} that two {{religions}} having such contrary effects on mankind should not be confused as they are under a common name. There is not one word of Pauline Christianity in the characteristic utterances of Jesus. When Saul watched the clothes of the men who stoned Stephen, he was not acting upon beliefs which Paul renounced. There is no record of Christ's having ever said to any man: [...] "Go and sin as much as you like: you can put it all on me." [...] He said [...] "Sin no more," [...] and insisted that he was putting up the standard of conduct, not debasing it, and that the righteousness of the Christian must exceed that of the Scribe and Pharisee. The notion that he was shedding his blood in order that every petty cheat and <b>adulterator</b> and libertine might wallow in it and come out whiter than snow, cannot be imputed to him on his own authority. [...] "I come as an infallible patent medicine for bad consciences" [...] {{is not one of the}} sayings in the gospels. If Jesus could have been consulted on Bunyan's allegory as to that business of the burden of sin dropping from the pilgrim's back when he caught sight of the cross, we must infer from his teaching that he would have told Bunyan in forcible terms that he had never made a greater mistake in his life, and that the business of a Christ was to make self-satisfied sinners feel the burden of their sins and stop committing them instead of assuring them that they could not help it, as it was all Adam's fault, but that it did not matter as long as they were credulous and friendly about himself. Even when he believed himself to be a god, he did not regard himself as a scapegoat. He was to take away the sins of the world by good government, by justice and mercy, by setting the welfare of little children above the pride of princes, by casting all the quackeries and idolatries which now usurp and malversate the power of God into what our local authorities quaintly call the dust destructor, and by riding on the clouds of heaven in glory instead of in a thousand-guinea motor car. That was delirious, if you like; but it was the delirium of a free soul, not of a shamebound one like Paul's. There has really never been a more monstrous imposition perpetrated than the imposition of the limitations of Paul's soul upon the soul of Jesus.|$|E
6000|$|It {{sometimes}} {{happens that}} we are punished for our faults by incidents, in the causation of which these faults had no share: and this I have always felt the severest punishment. The wound indeed is of the same dimensions; but the edges are jagged, {{and there is a}} dull underpain that survives the smart which it had aggravated. For there is always a consolatory feeling that accompanies the sense of a proportion between antecedents and consequents. The sense of Before and After becomes both intelligible and intellectual when, and only when, we contemplate the succession in the relations of Cause and Effect, which, like the two poles of the magnet manifest the being and unity of the one power by relative opposites, and give, as it were, a substratum of permanence, of identity, and therefore of reality, to the shadowy flux of Time. It is Eternity revealing itself in the phaenomena of Time: and the perception and acknowledgment of the proportionality and appropriateness of the Present to the Past, prove to the afflicted Soul, that it has not yet been deprived of the sight of God, that it can still recognise the effective presence of a Father, though through a darkened glass and a turbid atmosphere, though of a Father that is chastising it. And for this cause, doubtless, are we so framed in mind, and even so organized in brain and nerve, that all confusion is painful. It is within the experience of many medical practitioners, that a patient, with strange and unusual symptoms of disease, has been more distressed in mind, more wretched, from the fact of being unintelligible to himself and others, than from the pain or danger of the disease: nay, that the patient has received the most solid comfort, and resumed a genial and enduring cheerfulness, from some new symptom or product, that had at once determined the name and nature of his complaint, and rendered it an intelligible effect of an intelligible cause: even though the discovery did at the same moment preclude all hope of restoration. Hence the mystic theologians, whose delusions we may more confidently hope to separate from their actual intuitions, when we condescend to read their works without the presumption that whatever our fancy, (always the ape, and too often the <b>adulterator</b> and counterfeit of our memory,) has not made or cannot make a picture of, must be nonsense,--hence, I say, the Mystics have joined in representing the state of the reprobate spirits as a dreadful dream {{in which there is no}} sense of reality, not even of the pangs they are enduring--an eternity without time, and as it were below it--God present without manifestation of his presence. But these are depths, which we dare not linger over. Let us turn to an instance more on a level with the ordinary sympathies of mankind. Here then, and in this same healing influence of Light and distinct Beholding, we may detect the final cause of that instinct which, in the great majority of instances, leads, and almost compels the Afflicted to communicate their sorrows. Hence too flows the alleviation that results from [...] "opening out our griefs: [...] "which are thus presented in distinguishable forms instead of the mist, through which whatever is shapeless becomes magnified and (literally) enormous. Casimir, in the fifth Ode of his third Book, has happily [85] expressed this thought.|$|E
50|$|The first {{establishment}} called Waldkater ("wildcat") {{was built}} in 1845 and subsequently altered many times. The name goes back to a story, according to which a wine <b>adulterator</b> had been changed into a cat as a punishment.
