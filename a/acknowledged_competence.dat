After an educational intervention in the Public Dental Service in a Swedish county, thematic in-depth interviews were conducted, with special reference to the participants' experience of the successful change. Interviews with four participants, were purposively selected on the basis of occupation (dentist, dental assistant, receptionist, clinical manager), for a phenomenological human scientific analysis. Four constituents were identified as necessary for the invariant, general structure of the phenomenon: 1) disclosed motivation, 2) allowance for individual learning processes, 3) continuous professional collaboration, and 4) a facilitating educator. The perceived requirements for achieving successful clinical and organizational change in endodontic practice were clinical relevance, an atmosphere which facilitated discussion and allowance for individual learning patterns.

Design/Methodology/Approach: Departing from the widely <b>acknowledged</b> HR <b>competence</b> studies of Ulrich and associates, we extended them with the continuous learning competence profile and HR professionals’ individual job performance. The empirical study is built on open interviews with HR leaders of ten large Dutch companies. Findings: The study offers {{a new set of}} HRM competences. This set includes six HRM profiles: Business Focus, Learning Focus, Strategic Focus, HR Technology, HR Delivery, and Personal Credibility. Several contingency factors are thought {{to play a role in}} supporting these HRM competences: company culture, strategy, size, sector, scope, and position of HR professionals. Practical Implications: Based on these contributions, we recommended conducting a quantitative study to gain understanding of the relevance of the individual HRM job performance and to find associations between the HRM competences and the individual HRM job performance.

This empirical paper builds on prior research on managing supply in interorganizational networks by identifying the skills, knowledge, traits, and behavioural indicators (collectively termed ‘competence’) associated with effective team performance. Within the wider context of a long-term action research programme on the strategic management of supply in supply networks, {{interviews were conducted with}} members of teams learning to undertake a variety of network management roles such as innovation facilitator and information broker. The findings are presented {{in the form of a}} competence framework, with the aim of capturing the developing, but still fragmented and largely tacit, understanding among the teams about the strategic management of supply. Competence indicators are organized into six themes: network understanding; developing network position; relationship management; learning, knowledge and knowledge management; strategy formulation; strategy implementation. The complete framework is presented. We advocate further research to evaluate the usefulness of the competence framework in practice and the generalisability of the framework. In particular we propose to investigate its applicability to examining boundary-spanning teams not directly involved with the purchasing function...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} ten years {{individual}} New Zealand instutions and successive Governments have increased their funding for the provision of professional development in Information and Communication Technologies (ICT). This funding <b>acknowledged</b> the <b>competence</b> and confidence of staff in the educational use of ICT directly impacted upon the capacity and capability of institutions to positively engage their learners in ICT-supported learning environments. Initially, the professional development offered to teachers followed conventional models of provision. In essence, a perceived need (i. e. teachers’ lack of personal ICT skills and theoretical knowledge to effectively use ICT) was centrally addressed. This was achieved by either, the creation of a range of professional development activities, provided within a defined timeframe, and facilitated by external experts or, by the funding of Advisory Services. The initial professional development, where external experts advised and/or delivered learning events to address the identified deficiencies in staff’ knowledge, is based upon a ‘deficit’ model of professional development. Influenced by the educational reforms of the early 1980 s a instution-focused model of professional development has been slowly developed. The ICT PD model encourages institutions to reflect upon staff capabilities and confidence in ICT and the impact of ICTs on their teaching and learning practices. In essence there is a shift from funding a ‘deficit’ approach to an ‘empowerment’ approach (i. e. institutional internal reflection and decision making on how, when and why ICTs could be integrated drive the creation, provision, timing and content of institution-focused professional development) This presentation illustrated both empowerment and deficit models of professional development. ...|$|R
40|$|It {{is widely}} <b>acknowledged</b> that {{language}} <b>competence</b> {{is central to}} educational success, primarily because literacy is inherently a language based activity. Vocabulary knowledge specifically, {{plays an important role}} in the acquisition of reading comprehension skills. Language in education practice in South Africa is currently highly controversial as the implementation of home language or bilingual instruction policies has not been achieved in many schools. The aim of this study was to investigate the development of language skills in foundation phase English Additional Language (EAL) learners attending schools where English is the language of learning and teaching. A three year longitudinal investigation of the acquisition of processes underlying language for academic purposes was undertaken using the semantic subtests of the Developmental Evaluation of Language Variation Criterion Referenced Edition (Seymour, Roeper, and De Villiers, 2003). The results indicated that the majority of EAL learners improved with increased exposure to English in the academic environment and by the time they were in grade 3, were performing at a higher level than English First Language learners in grade 2. However, the effects of this protracted period of development on literacy attainment should be investigated. The significant individual variation in the learners’ performance has implications for assessment and instruction of EAL learners and for the collaborative role of teachers and speech language therapists in the education system...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} decade, {{individual}} New Zealand schools and successive Governments {{have increased their}} funding for professional development in Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) (Ham, et al 2002). This funding <b>acknowledged</b> the <b>competence</b> and confidence of teachers in the educational use of ICT directly impacted upon the capacity and capability of schools to positively engage their learners in ICT-supported learning environments (Clayton, Elliott & Saravani 2009). Initially, the professional development followed conventional models of provision.

This was achieved by either {{the creation of a}} range of professional development activities, provided within a defined timeframe and facilitated by external experts or, by the funding of Advisory Services to provide guidance to individual schools (Ham, et al 2002). The initial professional development, where external experts advised and/or delivered learning events to address the identified deficiencies in teachers’ knowledge, was based upon a ‘deficit’ model of professional development (Clayton et al 2009). Influenced by the educational reforms of the 1980 s, a school-focused model of professional development was introduced. This was the Information Technology Professional Development (ICT PD) initiative (ICT Strategy Reference Group 1998) resulting in the establishment of a professional development model known as the ICT PD Clusters model (Ham et al 2005). The ICT PD model encouraged groups of schools to reflect upon teachers’ capabilities and confidence in ICT and the impact of ICTs on their teaching and learning practices. The introduction of the ICT PD model shifted investment in professional development from funding a ‘deficit’ approach to an ‘empowerment’ approach (i. e. schools’ internal reflection and decision making on how, when and why ICTs could be integrated drive the creation, provision, timing and content of school-focused professional development) (Vrasidas & Glass 2010 : Niess 2006; Clayton, et al 2009).

Indeed, cultural {{competence is}} vital to every program’s effectiveness, not just to those serving “minority ” groups. Culturally relevant programs and culturally competent individuals can better serve youth, and when cultural competence partners with social justice, society may finally achieve equality in health outcomes for all young people, regardless of their race/ethnicity, language, gender, religion, or sexual orientation. What Is Culture? Here, we define culture as a “system of interrelated values [that] influence and condition perception, judgment, communication, and behavior. ” 1 Everyone looks at the world through a lens, as though through a pair of glasses. While this lens is unique to each individual, the worldviews of people of similar background or social experience is often similar. This similar worldview creates a shared understanding of society.

40|$|Purpose – This study aims {{to examine}} the self-perceived {{competencies}} of 231 Italian students enrolled in a psychological degree program and involved in a practicum. It analyzes the subjective perception of the competences that students expect to develop, acknowledge as developed and that might be inferred from tasks performed during the practicum; the level of expertise (novice, intermediate or advanced) of these competences; and {{the relation between the}} practicum facility and the competences. Design/methodology/approach – This study administered an ad hoc survey comprising open-ended questions and used the Practicum Competencies Outline (Hatcher and Lassiter, 2007) as a framework for the content analysis. Findings – The results revealed poor perception of some competency domains, such as Diversity: Individual and Cultural Differences; Development of Leadership; Application of Research and Ethics; and a frequent acknowledgment of Psychological Assessment and Professional Development. Before the practicum, the students expected to develop competence mainly at a novice level of expertise; after the practicum, the intermediate level of <b>competences</b> <b>acknowledged</b> as developed and inferred from performed tasks increased. Research limitations/implications – The findings have implications for research on competence-based training, such as the necessity of self-assessment training evaluation. Practical implications – Undergraduate psychology students must reflect on the value of psychological competences during their formative training to re-orient their learning process and build a competent professional role. Moreover, psychological facilities and university must share common objectives in training undergraduate students.

40|$|The use {{of medical}} {{products}} differs from so-called everyday products in {{that people need}} them, rather than have a special desire to use them, and also because the use contexts often relate to care. For human-centered designers, {{it is essential to}} understand stakeholders as well as use contexts, and more research is needed about how products and services can facilitate improved healthcare experiences. In this article, an understanding of stakeholders and use contexts in the case of children’s medical treatment is attempted through a phenomenological hermeneutics approach inspired by the views of Heidegger, Gadamer, and van Manen. We chose this approach because it encourages gaining an understanding of care as a phenomenon through an interpretative dialogue. Based on an analysis of interviews conducted with nurses and parents who have experienced medical treatment of children aged 0 to 3 years, we present five themes capturing the perspectives of the phenomenon of care in the case of children’s medical treatment. Another outcome of this analysis is an appraisal of phenomenological hermeneutics as a human-centered design approach and its utilization for the design of medical products. We argue that its strength lies in the dedication toward lived experience, responding to a human-centered view that <b>acknowledges</b> human agency, <b>competence,</b> and participation. © 2015 Høiseth and Keitsch.

40|$|Competence {{is a vital}} {{facet of}} the {{informed}} consent process. In New Zealand, despite some ambiguity in health legislation, children (less than 16 years of age) may give legally binding informed consent {{so long as they}} are competent to do so. The judgement of a child's level of competence {{is the responsibility of the}} attending health professional. Research studies have shown clear benefits to <b>acknowledging</b> children's <b>competence</b> to be included in and contribute to health discussions and decisions (Doyle, Lennox, & Bell, 2013; Gerison, 1994 b). Unfortunately, New Zealand health legislation and policy do not give clear guidance on when or how to assess child competence and what makes a child a competent child. The purpose of this thesis was to analyse the meaning of competence and its effect on children's participation in, and consent to, health treatment. The aim of this research was to highlight the discourses that construct the idea of 'child competence'. Foucauldian discourse analysis was used to explore the meanings attributed to 'competent' and 'child competence' by New Zealand health professionals, government and society. In addition it aimed to highlight the possible effects this discourse has on children's participation in important health matters that affect them. Subsequently, it may assist in the development of theory, practice, and health policy related to competent children and their rights to participate in and give informed consent. Relevant New Zealand legislation, health policy and literature written from a historical standpoint have been analysed utilising Foucauldian theories of archaeology and genealogy; including the notions of power, knowledge, and the subject. The main findings of this study acknowledged the dominant subject positions held by health professionals and the legal system who imposed the legal version of the child competence discourse as authoritative. Factors contributing to the emergence of this discourse as authoritative in history included the requirement for children to be competent in order to enter adulthood and liberalism and individualism as the conditions required for its existence. The main innate conflict identified within this discourse included children's right to autonomous decision making versus adult's desire to protect them from undue harm. Through the analysis of what makes a child a competent child, life experience was noted as a marginalised discourse that had a large impact on the perceived level of children's competence. Adults' perception of competence as a binary with incompetence, rather than competence on a continuum, was noted as a possible barrier to children's participation in important health decisions. Lastly, and specific to New Zealand, the foundations of competence in individualism may have unexpected ramifications for many Māori and Pasifika children whose cultures are based on collectivism. Considerations for the implementation of competence assessments for this group of children are required so they too can realise the benefits of the recognition of competence. Further training for health professionals may be required to support the frequency and reliability of competence assessments. Research is required to develop a working definition of child competence in healthcare so that health professionals can more regularly, reliably and easily incorporate competence assessments into their practice. Inclusion of children's voices in the development of this working definition would demonstrate respect for their rights and perspectives on this matter...|$|R
40|$|Background: Huntington&# 39;s disease (HD) is an autosomal-dominant {{inherited}} {{neurological disease}} characterised by progressive cognitive, motoric and behavioural symptoms. HD results in loss of functions {{and an increasing}} need for health care services {{in the home and}} later in a nursing home and there is still no cure. There is a need for better understanding of the impact of HD on families and family caregivers and ways to develop constructive collaboration between families and health professionals. Aims of the study: The overall aim {{of this study is to}} contribute with knowledge to promote and support partnerships between health professionals and family caregivers managing HD. This thesis is based on three sub-studies with three specific aims. These were to explore 1) family caregivers’ experiences with the impact of HD on the family structure, dynamics and roles in the family, 2) coping strategies and behaviour patterns used by family caregivers to care for themselves while caring for a family member with HD, and 3) experiences and expectations of family caregivers&# 39; concerning collaboration with health professionals. Methods: We invited family caregivers to participate by request through hospital departments, health institutions in municipalities and the Norwegian Huntington Association. In a qualitative study, we conducted individual semi-structured interviews with 15 adult participants in caregiver roles. Data were analysed with systematic text condensation (STC). Results: Our results suggest that the family caregiver role is shaped by gradual changes in family dynamics as decreased functioning of the HD-affected family member and the corresponding needs for care develop. Family caregivers reported conflicts between the roles of caregiver and individual family member (a role wherein they had needs of their own). This was particularly evident when family caregivers described experiences as caregivers in childhood or young adolescence, burdened with care responsibilities normally provided by adult family members. Family caregivers experienced changes in the qualities of familiar relationships. Emotional challenges related to HD characteristics and family members&# 39; different reactions to the illness rendered families vulnerable to fragmentation and lack of social support. In the early stages of the disease, family caregivers searched for information about HD and wanted to establish trustful relationships with health professionals. To manage challenges in the illness situation, family caregivers tried to balance their own needs for daily activities and the family members&# 39; needs for care. In the later stages, family caregivers experienced HD as overshadowing other activities of everyday life and felt that their own lives were “on hold”. Participants wanted to take part in daily work outside the home because they felt valued as individuals and needed the social support. Family caregivers expected to be involved in collaboration with health professionals and desired acknowledgment for their competence in providing HD care in the home setting and changes in the family. Participants expected to encounter health professionals with knowledge of HD, and time to maintain trustful relationships and continuous knowledge sharing. However, in their encounters with health care services, family caregivers reported lack of coordination of care services and unclear roles and responsibilities among involved parties. Conclusions: Health professionals should assess family needs and must <b>acknowledge</b> the <b>competence</b> of family caregivers in the context of home care. The family caregiver role is important to recognise through establishment of partnerships based on shared knowledge, adjusted individual support and flexible health care. It is necessary to give children and young family members special attention related to needs and support. Health professionals should arrange for adjusted support that allows caregivers to combine caregiving with valued personal activities, and prevent family fragmentation. To improve the quality of care, health professionals should establish clarity of roles and distribution of responsibilities in a coordinated care course that includes the preferences of family caregivers. </p...|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} I seek {{to compare the}} {{premises}} for identification and communication among immigrant women in two French course groups at the Espace Couleurs Femmes, a sociocultural activity centre in Brussels. My point of departure is the potential {{success or failure of}} intercultural encounters. In discourses about ‘us’ and ‘them’ one often gets the impression that the Other is a distant figure, and that conceptions of otherness are grounded in political or ideological divisions on the macro level. It is my assertion that such conceptions are just as common in everyday encounters on the micro level. I examine the notions of otherness within what {{is considered to be a}} ‘minority group’ – immigrant women. My aims are both to study what role these notions play in communication and ascription and self-ascription of identity, and to show the diversity of immigrant women in order to contest stereotypical ideas of them as belonging to a homogeneous group. I have chosen to compare two French course groups with quite different levels of linguistic <b>competence,</b> <b>acknowledging</b> the importance of language for both identification and communication. Principally, I employ theories of ‘us’ and ‘them’; identity; ethnic and other forms of categorisation; language; and stereotyping. I also make use of theoretical approaches focusing on the form and content of communication in encounters, as well as on situational definitions. Besides differences in language skills between my two groups of study, one group is more cohesive and sociable while the other is rather fragmented. There is (generally under-communicated) discontent in both groups, manifested in the form of stereotypes and contest for social control. In both groups, Arabs/Muslims are perceived to exercise dominance as a group. They act as a group in many ways, but without acknowledging having much in common or exercising power. The Arab/Muslim dominance appears to be based primarily on language, and in the most cohesive group it is frequently expressed through food, meals providing a social meeting point. In the other group, the Arabs/Muslims are much more divided, but they are still perceived as unified by the others. Albeit one could imagine that those in power are also the ones performing stereotyping and alienation, in my groups of study these strategies seem to be employed mostly as protests by the powerless against those dominating. Management of cultural diversity is the main challenge of intercultural encounters. Cultural difference is not a problem as such, but it becomes problematic when it is transformed into otherness. Making people into Others is a means to protect and differentiate between the Self and Others. I contend that a priori it is difficult to predict the outcome of intercultural encounters, as social dynamics never follow any predestined pattern but are created situationally, in the encounter...|$|R
40|$|Young {{people in}} Norway have never {{experienced}} {{a world without}} the internet. This thesis explores uses of digital technology in children’s lives, and draws on fieldwork among eight- and nine-year olds in Kristiansand to identify emerging forms of sociality and play in online and offline literacy practices. In Norway, where internet access is near universal, children’s immersion into digital environments raises new questions concerning central theoretical concepts in anthropology. What conceptual tools are required for {{making sense of the}} ongoing merging of online and offline sociality? How can we deal analytically with the rapidly shifting contexts of children’s play? The thesis addresses these questions through an ethnographic investigation of how children employ avatars—or digital bodies—as they playfully inhabit online worlds with their friends. Play is an elusive phenomenon; easily recognizable, yet highly resistant to definitional attempts. This thesis employs a phenomenological approach to play, and draws on children’s engagement with masks, avatars, and toys to develop a concept of play understood as an attitude of openness to the new and unexpected. Far from being limited to non-serious activities, play has the capacity to bring people face to face with fundamental paradoxes of human existence. Taking children’s engagement with cosplay—or costume play—as a point of departure, the ethnographic data presented here shows how playful masking offers paradoxical viewpoints situated between human and non-human perspectives. Expanding on the anthropological literature on animism, the thesis argues that children’s contemporary play in Norway involves an oscillation between techno-animist and techno-naturalist perspectives. The thesis also suggests that the most relevant sites for understanding people’s engagement with the internet are not necessarily found online. The recent proliferation of online worlds has {{had a significant impact on}} children’s literacy practices in Norway. Alphabetic text suffuses online sociality, and familiarity with alphabetic literacy is frequently a prerequisite for participation online. Digital literacy practices often take place outside the adult gaze, where creativity and artful expression are valued above grammar and spelling conventions. The thesis explores the central role of alphabetic text in children’s online filmmaking. Through playful juxtapositions of images and text, filmmakers conjure up future images that emerge not as abstract horizons, but as fully real and with palpable effects. Starting from the premise that literacy, far from being a neutral set of skills, is an inherently social technology, this thesis contributes to our understanding of how children in Norway become literate during a period of rapid technological change. As young people increasingly surpass older generations with regards to digital <b>competence,</b> <b>acknowledging</b> children’s active part in shaping sociality appears more important than ever. Numerous scholars of childhood have pointed out that children, rather than being considered passive adults-in-the-making, should be taken seriously as social beings in their own right. While acknowledging the importance of viewing children as social beings, this thesis also suggests that the analytical shift in childhood studies from becoming to being has tended to ignore the multiple becomings in children’s lives that are not directly related to their imagined future adulthood. Facing the future, children grow outwards as well as up as they employ digital technologies to playfully create new worlds. As digital literacy practices accommodate new forms of sociality and play, young people in contemporary Norway experience a world where there is far more to the future than becoming adult. </p...|$|R
40|$|Communication {{impairments}} {{are common}} following acquired brain injury (ABI) {{and have a}} significant impact on a person’s quality of life (QOL) post-injury. While some treatments have improved communication skills, few have measured QOL, and even fewer have shown improved QOL for people with ABI following communication-based treatments. Project-based treatment is an alternative treatment approach that could have an impact on communication skills and QOL for people with ABI who are long-term post-injury. The treatment is embedded in a context of meaningful activities chosen by people with brain injury, whereby, as a group, they work collaboratively to plan and achieve a concrete goal or outcome that contributes others and/or the wider community. Project-based treatment has not been empirically evaluated for people with ABI. More specifically, no research has evaluated whether projects can improve both communication skills and QOL in people with ABI. Therefore, this research aims to evaluate the effectiveness of project-based treatment on the communication skills and QOL for people with ABI. An exploratory study was designed as a prospective quasi-randomised controlled trial with pre, post and follow-up assessments, using mixed methods, and feasibility testing to investigate the effect of project-based treatment. Twenty-one people with ABI were recruited from community settings, allocated to either a TREATMENT (n= 11) or WAITLIST group (n= 10). Treatment was completed over 6 weeks and comprised an individual session (to set specific communication goals with the person with ABI and their communication partner), followed by nine sessions conducted in groups of 2 - 3 people. These sessions involved a range of meaningful activities chosen by people with ABI that contributed to a tangible end product designed to help others (e. g. video, pamphlet, radio podcast, piece of art). Mixed methods were used to determine the effect of the treatment on people with ABI. The primary communication outcomes were: (1) Blind ratings of the person with ABI’s conversations on the Interaction and Transaction scales of the Adapted Measure of Participation in Conversation (MPC). The secondary communication outcomes were: (1) Blind ratings of the communication partner’s involvement in conversations on the <b>Acknowledging</b> and Revealing <b>Competence</b> scales of the Adapted Measure of Support in Conversation (MSC); (2) Blind ratings for the Impression scales that described how appropriate, rewarding, effortful, and interesting a conversation was; (3) La Trobe Communication Questionnaire (LCQ) as rated by the person with ABI, and their communication partner; and (4) Goal Attainment Scaling (GAS). The primary QOL outcome was the Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS), and the secondary QOL outcome was the Quality of Life in Brain Injury (QOLIBRI) measure. The qualitative data was drawn from semi-structured interviews conducted post-treatment. The first set of analyses for the primary and secondary outcome measures, compared the TREATMENT group with the WAITLIST group over two time points, between which only the TREATMENT group had received the treatment. This showed that people with ABI in the TREATMENT group had improved Interaction scores on the MPC, their communication partners had improved Revealing Competence scores on the MSC, and the conversation was perceived as less effortful, compared to the WAITLIST group. No changes were found for the remaining communication outcomes, or the QOL outcomes. The second analyses compared pre-treatment, post-treatment, and follow-up scores across all people with ABI (i. e. scores for both the TREATMENT and WAITLIST group were combined). This showed significant changes for communication partners on the MSC and LCQ, and significant achievement of communication goals on GAS, as rated by both the person with ABI, and their communication partners. Significant improvement on the QOLIBRI was found, with a trend towards significance on the SWLS. No other significant changes were found. Qualitative data was analysed using content analysis where the content and context of the interview transcripts were analysed and themes identified. People with ABI described overwhelmingly positive experiences of the treatment, the group, the project, and working on goals. They also described a range of positive benefits including improved awareness and skill, and positive feelings. Project-based treatment made modest improvements to both communication skills, and QOL. Moreover, people with ABI perceived positive experiences, and benefited from inclusion in the treatment. While this study was an exploratory trial, with feasibility testing, the results highlight that this treatment could be a potential alternative to other treatments available to people with ABI...|$|R
