Several key differences between the F model and the Nikkorex model helped keep the price low: the Nikkorex incorporated a selenium-cell meter mounted behind a honeycomb lens {{on the front of}} the camera rather than through-the-lens metering (as in the Nikon Photomic prism) and used a leaf shutter rather than the more expensive focal-plane shutter found in the Nikon F and similar higher-end SLRs. The Citizen MVL shutter had speeds from 1 second to 1/500th second that were set by a ring on the lens, rather than by the more conventional method of a dial on the top of the body of the camera.

40|$|Purpose. To {{determine}} {{the rates of}} microbial contamination of solutions and <b>lens</b> <b>accessories</b> of existing ortho-k lens wearers and the effect on contamination rates of monthly replacement and warnings. To investigate self-reported levels of compliance with care of the <b>lenses</b> and <b>lens</b> <b>accessories</b> and correlation of these levels with the rates of microbial contamination. Methods. Asymptomatic ortho-k lens wearers with at least 6 -month successful use were requested to bring their <b>lenses,</b> solutions, and <b>accessories</b> to their next aftercare visit. All items, except the lenses, were replaced at each data collection visit. Samples collected from the lens surface, solution, and accessories were cultured for pathogens. These procedures were repeated twice at 1 -month intervals. At the first visit, each subject and/or parent was interviewed about the care/use of the <b>lens</b> and <b>accessories.</b> Results. Thirty-eight subjects completed the study. Initial contamination rates of the lenses, lens cases, and tweezers were 29, 34, and 46 %, respectively. Rates of contamination dropped for lenses, suction holders, and tweezers during the three-visit intervention. Contact lens solutions, except lens cleaner were contaminated on all occasions with the most contaminated product being artificial tears [33 % (n = 18) ]. There was no improvement in the contamination rate of the lens cases. The most common pathogens isolated were Staphylococcus aureus and Serratia marcescens. Compliance was lowest for care of lens cases and highest for care of lenses. However, correlation between reported compliance and presence of pathogens failed to reach significance. Conclusions. Subjects' awareness {{of the importance of}} lens cleanliness is high and can be improved by regular reinforcements. However, attitudes toward cleaning of accessories was far less satisfactory and while replacement and warnings resulted in significant improvements of contamination rates of tweezers and suction holders, more emphasis should be placed on educating patients on correct care of <b>lens</b> <b>accessories.</b> Department of Health Technology and InformaticsSchool of Optometr...|$|R

H 577 P SO 2016 Shixxviii, 293 pages :color illustrationsMicrobial {{keratitis}} (MK) is a rare, but sight-threatening complication {{associated with}} contact lens wear. Various {{factors have been}} reported as being responsible for contact lens-related MK. Microbial contamination of the contact <b>lens</b> and <b>lens</b> <b>accessories</b> is frequently detected in contact lens wearers and is a known risk factor for MK. Staphylococcus species, which are not only commonly isolated from the periorbital region (including conjuctival sac, eye lids, and eyelashes), {{but also from the}} contact <b>lenses</b> and <b>lens</b> <b>accessories,</b> are the most common pathogens associated with MK. In published reports, the contamination rates of contact lenses, lens cases, and lens care solutions are high. Contact lenses are considered as vectors capable of transporting potential pathogens contaminating both the <b>lens</b> and <b>lens</b> <b>accessories</b> into the eyes. To reduce the incidence of ocular infections associated with contact lens wear, the use of contact lens disinfecting and cleaning systems are required. Multipurpose disinfecting solutions (MPS) are essential to inactivate microorganisms on the <b>lenses</b> and <b>lens</b> <b>accessories.</b> Some of the active ingredients of MPS, such as chlorhexidine gluconate (CHX) and benzalkonium chloride (BAK), which have been widely used in hospital and other clinical settings, can cause selective pressure on bacteria {{which is one of the}} main reasons for the development of resistance to disinfectants. There is an increased concern about the emergence of disinfectant-resistant microorganisms, notably in Staphylococcus. Antiseptic resistance in staphylococci is attributable to several genes that are mainly plasmid-borne and confer reduced susceptibility to cationic antiseptic agents including dyes, Quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs), and biguanides by coding for efflux pumps, which reduce disinfectant concentration in the cell. The distribution of QAC genes in staphylococci has been investigated not only in clinical isolates, but also in isolates from the general population. In addition, there is evidence that presence of QAC genes may contribute to the emergence of cross-resistance and co-resistance between widely used biocides and antibiotics. Currently, over 125 million people use contact <b>lenses</b> and <b>lens</b> <b>accessories.</b> More than 90 % contact lens wearers are using MPS to clean and disinfect their contact <b>lens</b> and <b>lens</b> <b>accessories.</b> In actual use, especially if not handled properly, MPS are inevitably diluted by water, saline, or other solutions, which will serve to decrease the effects of MPS. Some microorganisms may survive and be exposed to the selective pressure for a prolonged period. However, it is unknown whether long-term use of MPS can select for ocular pathogens harbouring QAC genes, having increased resistance to several antiseptics, antibiotics, and MPS. The purpose of this research was to provide significant and original contributions to the knowledge base of distribution of QAC genes in S. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) in selected orthokeratology (ortho-k) lens and spectacle wearers in Hong Kong and observe the trend of resistant organism acquisition over 6 months. It aimed to determine the antimicrobial susceptibility of S. aureus and CNS harbouring QAC genes and their association with the presence of QAC genes. It also aimed to investigate the effectiveness of four MPSs for RGP lenses against S. aureus and CNS harbouring QAC genes isolated in this research. This is the first study of the prevalence of QAC gene in staphylococci isolated from ortho-k lens wearers. Samples were collected from several sites in the periorbital region of all subjects, as well as from the <b>lenses</b> and <b>lens</b> <b>accessories</b> of ortho-k <b>lens</b> wearers and from the spectacle frames of controls. Following isolation and identification of bacterial species, all staphylococci were investigated for the presence of QAC genes by polymerase chain reaction. The higher prevalence of QAC genes in staphylococci isolated from ortho-k lens wearers and the gradually increasing prevalence of QAC genes in staphylococci isolated from ortho-k wearers over a 6 -month period supported the hypothesis that use of MPS may cause selective pressure to staphylococci to acquire QAC genes. For all staphylococcal isolates harbouring QAC genes, minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) to two disinfectants, CHX and BAK, and susceptibility to several antibiotics were determined by broth microdilution method and disc diffusion test, respectively. The results demonstrated that the presence of QAC genes in staphylococci commonly contributed to higher MIC and MBC to disinfectants and higher resistance rates to antibiotics. Four commonly used MPS for RGP lens were challenged with staphylococci harbouring QAC genes by the standalone test and MIC and MBC to each MPS were determined by broth microdilution method. The results demonstrated that the presence of QAC genes in staphylococci significantly decreased their susceptibility to MPS for rigid lenses and viability of some staphylococcal isolates, especially strains harbouring QAC genes, could not be reduced by the required 3 -logs after exposure to MPS. In conclusion, this study has demonstrated that staphylococci harbouring QAC genes are widely distributed in both ortho-k lens and spectacle wearers in Hong Kong, and use of contact lenses increases the likelihood of colonization and contamination with such strains. Use of MPS may contribute to higher carriage rate of gene-positive staphylococci as a result of increased tolerance to disinfectants (including MPS) and antibiotics. Further investigation may be required to investigate the risk of reduced antiseptic and antibiotic susceptibility to MK and its association in the control of MK. School of OptometryPh.

40|$|Abstract Background We {{studied the}} {{bacteriological}} profile of soft contact <b>lens</b> and its <b>accessories</b> among the asymptomatic subjects and monitored the compliance {{level with the}} lens use and its cleaning protocol. Findings A total of 115 (104 daily wear and 11 extended wear) subjects using contact lens were studied. Data regarding the duration of use and frequency and method of cleaning were recorded. Contact lens, lens cases, preserving solutions and tips of solution bottles were the samples collected. The isolates were identified {{on the basis of}} their phenotypic characters. Samples from 24 subjects (21 daily wear and 3 extended wear) were found contaminated. Of the 24 contaminated cases, 23 showed medium adherence to the cleaning protocol. Contamination rate was higher among the 56 daily wear lens users who used same lens for 2 years and more, than the 48 users who used their lenses for less than 2 years. Lens case contamination was found in all the 24 cases. The bacteria isolated were Citrobacter freundii, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus pneumoniae. In extended wear lens users, there was no change in microbial flora on repeating the cultures on day 7 and 14. Conclusion Non-compliance with contact lens use may lead to invitation of microbial flora. The accumulation of these bacteria may act as a precursor to biofilm formation, thus colonizing the <b>lens</b> <b>accessories</b> as well.

50|$|At long last, Rollei had {{a camera}} that could match the Hasselbad 500C. Indeed, {{had it been}} {{released}} earlier, around 1960 say, {{it could have been}} enormously successful. On top of that, despite declining profit margins and tough competition from the Japanese, Rollei continued to target its advertising at the amateur market. In contrast, other companies such as Leitz and Hasselblad had better understood how to promote their expensive cameras in photographic magazines - not just through paid advertising, but also through feature articles in the editorial pages. As a result, the SL66 never sold in the numbers that the company had hoped for or needed. Nevertheless, Rollei owes its survival as a company to the SL66 camera system, along with its enduring reputation for quality. Its successor, the SL66E, was released in 1984; externally the camera was largely unchanged, but it now had a built-in light meter. Additional lenses were released, such as the Fisheye-Distagon (f/3.5, 30 mm), the Distagon (f/4, 40 mm), and the Sonnar (f/4, 150 mm) with a between-the-lens shutter along with more <b>accessories</b> including close-up <b>lenses,</b> extension bellows, a Polaroid film cassette, a sheet film cassette, an underwater housing, and a ring flash unit. Its successor, the SL66-X, released in 1968 only had TTL flash metering, while the SL66-SE (Special Edition) also included a standard light meter. Prior to this, TTL metering required a special prism viewfinder with a built-in light meter. The release in 1992 of the SE Exclusive Professional incorporating selective gold-plating on the housing marked the end of the SL66 series.|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} normal flora {{of children}} with and without orthokeratology (ortho-k) treatment, and the associations between carriage of Staphylococcus aureus and Gram-negative rods with contamination of contact lenses and lens cases in ortho-k subjects and with spectacles of control subjects. Methods: Twenty-three ortho-k subjects (treatment > 12 months) and 20 control myopic subjects aged 7 - 14 years were recruited. Samples were collected from four sites surrounding the left eye (lower conjunctiva, upper and lower eyelids, and eyelashes) for all subjects, spectacles for control subjects and contact <b>lens</b> <b>accessories</b> for ortho-k subjects. Samples were cultured, total numbers enumerated, and isolates identified using chromogenic agars. Results: Ortho-k subjects had significantly less total isolates in the conjunctiva than controls (p = 0. 009). Otherwise, carriage rates in normal flora levels of the peri-orbital tissues {{were not significantly different}} between the two groups (p > 0. 19). The total isolates and carriage rates of normal flora on spectacles, contact lenses, and lens cases were similar to those identified on the skin tissues. Small numbers of bacteria were identified from the multipurpose solution of two ortho-k subjects. Although the association between the carriage of S. aureus with contamination of accessories was statistically significant only in control subjects (p = 0. 03), ortho-k subjects not yielding S. aureus and Gram-negative rods from samples of their peri-orbital tissues tended to be less likely to have these organisms in their accessories. No Pseudomonas was isolated from any of the sites sampled and no Acinetobacter was isolated from any of the accessories. Conclusions: Ortho-k may lower the total number of bacteria in conjunctiva due to the use of solution and lenses, but the physiologic effect of this treatment on the types of normal flora in children was minimal and should not increase the risk of microbial keratitis in children with good compliance.

40|$|Purpose: The aims were to {{determine}} the level of compliance of contact lens wearers, to identify which procedures have highest levels of non-compliance and to study {{the effectiveness of a}} compliance enhancement strategy on the level of compliance. Methods: The level of compliance for each subject was evaluated with a self-administered questionnaire together with microbiological examination of their contact lenses, lens cases and lens care solutions. The effect of an intervention to improve the level of compliance was determined by a controlled trial. A regular self-review exercise on proper lens handling was given to the test group once every three months for 12 months. The levels of compliance and contamination of contact lenses and <b>lens</b> care <b>accessories</b> between test and control groups were compared {{at the end of the}} 12 -month period to evaluate the effect of the intervention. Results: Sixty-five subjects who were experienced contact lens wearers were recruited and 60 completed the study. All showed some degree of non-compliance in the care of their contact <b>lenses</b> and <b>lens</b> <b>accessories.</b> Most (about 60 per cent) were non-compliant with at least six of a total of 15 lens care procedures. The most common non-compliant behaviour among contact lens wearers was associated with the care of the lens case. By the end of the study period, our compliance enhancement strategy did not appear to have had a significant effect on the behaviour of our subjects, except for improvement in the care of lens cases. Compliance for other procedures improved in both test and control groups. Conclusion: All subjects showed some degree of non-compliance and the spectrum of non-compliance was wide. The poorest levels of compliance were associated with care of the lens case, which was also the most frequently contaminated item. Our compliance enhancement strategy showed a significant difference in improvement in compliance between the intervention and control groups only in the care of lens cases.
