Since then bras have replaced corsets (although some women prefer camisoles) and a minority go without. The metal shortages of World War II encouraged {{the end of the}} corset. By the time the war ended, most fashion-conscious women in Europe and North America were wearing bras.

25|$|The {{application}} of Newton's law of gravity has enabled {{the acquisition of}} much of the detailed information we have about the planets in the Solar System, the mass of the Sun, and details of quasars; even the existence of dark matter is inferred using Newton's law of gravity. <b>Although</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> not traveled to all the planets nor to the Sun, we know their masses. These masses are obtained by applying the laws of gravity to the measured characteristics of the orbit. In space an object maintains its orbit because of the force of gravity acting upon it. Planets orbit stars, stars orbit galactic centers, galaxies orbit a center of mass in clusters, and clusters orbit in superclusters. The force of gravity exerted on one object by another is directly proportional to the product of those objects' masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.|$|E
25|$|According to Altekar, {{there is}} no mention of actual sati in the period of Brahmana {{literature}} (c. 1500–700 BCE) and the later Grhyusutras, roughly composed 600–300 BCE on a number of rituals, but sati is not described or mentioned. In fact, what is written about funeral customs, is that the widow is brought back from the funeral pyre, typically by a trusted servant. Altekar thinks it significant that Gautama Buddha, who castigated customs of animal sacrifice, and other customs where pain was inflicted, is entirely silent about burning women alive. Altekar takes these elements as proofs that burning widows alive had long ago died out as a practice. Nor do the authors of the Dharmasutras (c. 400 BCE–100 BCE) or Yajnavalkya (c. 100 CE–300 CE) say anything about it being commendable to burn a widow alive on her husband's funeral pyre. <b>Although</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> late fourth-century BCE evidence from Greek authors and the Mahabarata for the 'existence' of the custom of sati, Altekar thinks it did not really begin to grow in popularity before 400 CE, by the manner of which it is infrequently mentioned in the Puranas of that time. A very early attested case from 510 CE is that of the wife of Goparaja, who immolated herself with her dead husband, according to the Eran inscription of king Bhanugupta, with another similar case attested from 606 CE. As the custom grew in popularity, Altekar highlights as determined opponents of this aristocratic custom in particular 7th-century poet Bāṇabhaṭṭa, but also 9th-century theologian Medhātithi and 12th-century Devana Bhatta. In Altekar's view, their crusades against the custom were largely unsuccessful.|$|E

In September 2009 a team of six British Transport Police officers with specialist training in forensic search techniques spent two days examining the area {{in an attempt to}} recover the jewellery. Although the ground had been the subject of extensive redevelopment in previous years and recovery of the items was considered unlikely, detectives authorised the operation to ensure every attempt had been made to find and return them to her parents. None of the items was discovered. DCI McTavish said of the search: [...] "It is recognised that in the years since Teresa's murder {{there has been a lot}} of disturbance and redevelopment around the railway track, but there was still a possibility that items may have lain undisturbed. <b>Although</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> not been able to recover any items linked to either Teresa or the suspect it was important we did everything to explore this final aspect of the case." ...|$|E

500|$|Producer Wayne Young {{said his}} passion for the {{environment}} was his motivation for making the film, saying the film was [...] "blatantly environmental, <b>although</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> gone {{to a lot of}} trouble to avoid preaching. We also want it to be viewed as entertainment." [...] The inspiration for FernGully came from stories written by his former wife, Diana Young. Diana first wrote the story of FernGully 15 years before the film's release. Wayne said the couple planned a film adaptation for five years, then spent [...] "seven years of dreaming and hustling, followed by another three years of production". Wayne stated their dream was not possible until the success of Walt Disney Feature Animation's 1989 film The Little Mermaid, which brought popularity back to animation. Hand drawn scenes in the film were complimented by computer animation, which was used to create elements such as flocks of birds that would have taken much longer to animate traditionally. Kroyer states 40,000 frames of computer animation were used in the film, and that the use of such animation halved the production time. Most of the film's $24 million budget was spent on the animation and the soundtrack.|$|E

He said that [...] "Fighting is what {{a young man with}} good red blood in his veins joins for. It is the ultimate test for the professional soldier". He has continued to voice opinions on military matters in his retirement. He delivered the annual Richard Dimbleby Lecture four months after leaving the Army. In the lecture, titled The Defence of The Realm in the 21st Century, he criticised the Ministry of Defence and questioned the MoD's understanding of the fundamental ethos of the armed forces. He was critical of the treatment of soldiers, calling some soldiers' accommodation [...] "frankly shaming" [...] and saying that the [...] "Armed Forces' contract with the nation... must be a two-way one", going on to say that [...] "military operations cost in blood and treasure, because risk-free soldiering, which some seem to think is possible, is simply a contradiction in terms". The MoD responded by saying that [...] "while we do not agree with everything Sir Mike has said, we are always the first to recognise—for example in relation to medical services and accommodation—that <b>although</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> delivered real improvements, there is more we can do".|$|E

2500|$|Lancashire were {{promoted}} back to {{the first}} division of the county championship in 2005, winning the second division title in the process. They stayed up in the National League, progressed to the finals' day of the Twenty20 Cup and were knocked out in the semi-final of the C Trophy. Despite winning the second division title, there were concerns that the squad may have been getting too old and that there were limited opportunities for the younger players. Of Lancashire's performance over the season, Watkinson said [...] "I was not happy about our batting and, <b>although</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> achieved what we set out to do– get promoted– our performance left a lot to be desired". Lancashire are one of three teams, along with Middlesex and Surrey, never to have finished bottom in the County Championship. On their return to the first division in the 2006 season, Lancashire finished second in the Championship. They also finished as runners-up in the NatWest Trohpy.|$|E
2500|$|In many cases, {{a former}} ablauting {{paradigm}} was generalized in the daughter languages, but in different ways. For example, Ancient Greek dóru 'spear' < PIE nominative [...] 'wood, tree' and Old English trēo 'tree' < PIE genitive [...] reflect different stems of a PIE ablauting paradigm PIE , PIE nominative [...] and genitive , {{which is still}} reflected directly in Vedic Sanskrit nom. dā́ru 'wood', gen. drṓs.

As some of them have been forced to join the rebellion, they aren't necessarily as united as they seem. We should exploit their differences and make them split into 'good' and 'bad' camps. We shall then induce those in the 'good' camp to join us. This will boost our numbers and reduce theirs. Once we have increased our numbers, our morale will increase as well. By then, we should be able to defeat the rebels easily. If we do nothing now and wait for reinforcements to arrive, by then it'll be much more difficult to separate the rebels into 'good' and 'bad' camps and turn those in the 'good' camp to our side. <b>Although</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> no authorisation from the imperial court, given the current circumstances, I don't think it's unreasonable for us to exercise our own judgment and act accordingly." ...|$|E

Three years later, Robb was the only senator from a Southern state to oppose the Defense of Marriage Act. In stating his opposition to the bill, which his friends and supporters urged him to support, he said the following, [...] "I feel very strongly that this legislation is wrong. Despite its name, the Defense of Marriage Act does not defend marriage against some imminent, crippling effect. <b>Although</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> made huge strides in the struggle against discrimination based on gender, race, and religion, it is more difficult to see beyond our differences regarding sexual orientation. The fact that our hearts don't speak in the same way is not cause or justification to discriminate."

The restrictions of time, place, and manner can be allowed if they are (a) narrowly tailored (b) serve a substantial governmental interest and (c) there are alternative channels to communicate the information."Contrary to {{the conclusion of the}} Court of Appeals, the foregoing analysis demonstrates that the Park Service regulation is sustainable under the four-factor standard of United States v.

Justice White also makes clear that {{in the view of the}} majority the act of sleeping holds little value in being considered an act of expression. [...] "In the first place, we seriously doubt that the First Amendment requires the Park Service to permit a demonstration in Lafayette Park and the Mall involving a 24-hour vigil and the erection of tents to accommodate 150 people.

2500|$|Campaign slogan and {{advertisement}} by LSD and Civic party {{calling for}} [...] "uprising of the people" [...] (全民起義), attracted media attention and {{the ire of}} Beijing. Reception of the slogan was particularly negative by the pro-Beijing camp. [...] Rita Fan attacked the term saying it would set a dangerous precedent by misleading the public over {{the purpose of the}} by-elections. [...] She said anyone who has studied Chinese history would know that the word [...] "uprising" [...] convey an image of revolution, blood, and violence and that it would make people think of social turmoil, hardship and chaos. Maria Tam said an uprising usually refers to overthrowing the government through violence, and Former Secretary for Justice Elsie Leung warned of anarchy. Ip Kwok-him, Deputy Chairman of the DAB, said the slogan was seditious; but Audrey Eu said it was an attempt to intimidate the Hong Kong people. Eu said that the 4 Chinese characters do not refer to a violent revolution and that the resignation is not a ploy to seek independence of Hong Kong; Wong Yuk-man emphasised it as a [...] "peaceful uprising". Gordon Wu said the Civic Party and the LSD were destabilising Hong Kong by resigning, and likened the call for people to rise up to action taken by red guards during the Cultural Revolution. Wu said: [...] "Uprising is something very thrilling - <b>although</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> not reached the stage of armed struggle."
