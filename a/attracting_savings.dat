Data were collected through the use of questionnaire and documentary reviews. Quantitative data were analyzed statistically by the use of computer software (MS Excel) giving frequencies and percentages. The findings of the study concur with findings obtained from the studies by different researchers that revealed the role played by SACCOS in financial intermediation through mobilizing funds from the members with excess cash and channel the excess funds to the borrowers. The findings of the study also highlighted the challenges that are faced by SACCOS in their role in financial intermediation including their perceived significance by public. Based on the research findings, the study recommends that the government and SACCOS should address the challenges crippling the optimal performance of SACCOS.

40|$|MBA 2013 ABSTRACT This paper empirically {{examines}} the factors influencing savings {{as a driver}} of economic growth in emerging economies (BRICS) during the period 1997 - 2011. To perform this analysis, the study employed the real gross domestic product, financial development, terms of trade, real interest rate, dependency ratio, and inflation rate and government expenditure as determinants of savings. The study applied both time series analysis and balanced panel model data. For the times series, it used the Ordinary Least Square (OLS) while it used Least Square Dummy Variable (LSDV) and Random Effect Model (REM) econometric methodologies for the panel analysis. Country specific analysis {{for each of the}} BRICS countries indicate that more liberal policies and trade facilities present opportunities for increasing savings in Russia, large market growth <b>attracts</b> <b>savings</b> in all the countries except Brazil, increase inflation rate have unfavourable effects on savings in India and South Africa, higher real interest rates <b>attracts</b> <b>savings</b> in Brazil and China and a high level of dependency ratio decreases savings in China. This finding suggests that though these five most emerging nations in the world appear to be similar, referred to as a bloc using the acronym BRICS, their differences in institutional and governmental framework and policies influence the economy in diverse ways resulting in dissimilar drivers of economic conditions. However, further deepening through financial sector liberalization and trade liberalization in these countries will be an important instrument in stimulating investment through more savings and therefore more long-run economic growth...|$|R

EDUCATION PAPER The Study in Brief Since 1998, the government of Canada has substantially expanded its support for registered education savings plans (RESPs) {{as a means of}} subsidizing savings for young people’s education. This Commentary examines RESPs both analytically and statistically to gauge their effectiveness; it finds several flaws in the program. The primary economic effect of RESPs is to add needless complexity to Canada’s tax system. Through registered retirement savings plans (RRSPs) and other forms of tax-advantaged savings, Canadians already have access to tax-exempt accrual of income. The addition of extra contribution room through the RESPs may <b>attract</b> <b>savings</b> that were destined for another tax-advantaged form, but is unlikely t...|$|R

[...] The unacceptable situation was eventually brought to an end by legislation providing for indexation in 1979.

This does not assure MFIs existence but also guarantees continual provision of financial services to the poor. The overall objective {{of this study was}} to examine the financial performance of Saving and Credit Cooperative Societies (SACCOS) in achieving financial sustainability. Four variables, namely Savings mobilization pattern, levels of interest charged on loans, Loan portfolio looking at loan size, repayment terms and pattern, and institutional capacity were used to measure the sustainability and performance of Saving and Credit Cooperative Societies. The study involved 15 SACCOS in Mtwara Municipal. Primary data was collected using both questionnaire (Appendix 1) and semi structures interview. Apart from questionnaires and semi structured interview questions, another method that was used in data collection was documentation. The finding implies that savings mobilization indicated positive influence on the sustainability of SACCOS. SACCOS has managed to build up its lending base by influencing savings.

High deposit rates acts as incentives to <b>attract</b> <b>savings</b> while high lending rates discourage credit demand from potential borrowers. The margin between deposit rate and lending rate at a given time period forms an interest rate band which has implications on borrowing and deposit mobilization in the economy. In Kenya, the interest rate band has persistently remained wide despite the efforts to narrow it down. Several factors have been established that influence this wide interest rate band. However, this was before the financial reform period when commercial banks dominated the financial sector.

40|$|The {{development}} of the European Community {{is likely to be}} financed through expansion of tax sharing on VAT and by introducing general-revenue sharing indirectly. Tax sharing on VAT does not necessarily imply the harmonisation of tax rates, however. Other options for revenue equalisation schemes are the transfer of tax bases to the centre that exhibits implicit distributional effects. It is argued that capital taxation is the Achilles heel of any future tax system given the fact that [...] in globalised capital markets [...] effective marginal tax rates will more and more influence the international flow of capital, a phenomenon that forces governments into tax competition through market processes. A cash-flow corporation tax seems to be likely to become more and more prominent as an alternative to comprehensive capital income taxation. Applied at the Community level such a tax could serve as an implicit equalisation scheme that fosters developing regions by exempting new investment while taxing the proceeds from the more mature economic areas in the EC. It would also be neutral as to investment and financing decisions and it would <b>attract</b> <b>savings</b> funds from abroad to be invested in the Community. As far as explicit equalisation is concerned, it is argued that differentials among regions are best dealt with by a system of matching grants that concentrate on aspects of allocation rather than by general-revenue redistribution. Harmonisation of personal income taxation in Europe could also be achieved by introducing a piggyback tax onto the income tax system which taxes personal consumption at a flat rate. Shifting the centre of gravitation within these two-tiers of income - consumption taxation would allow national governments to maintain their sovereignty as regards allocative and distributive policy. The consumption tax part could also form the nucleus of a future supranational direct tax. ...|$|R

As it stands, Canada’s business investment taxes are the third highest in the world, using a representative selection of 20 industrialized and large developing countries. That is a potentially self-destructive status. Because {{of the importance of}} business capital investment for productivity improvement, technological advancement and the country’s standard of living, it is urgent that federal and provincial governments put together a new action plan to improve Canada’s business tax competitiveness. Many analysts define tax competitiveness using only one element of the business tax system — the statutory income tax rate that applies to corporate income. That approach can lead to an illusionary result that, more often than not, creates complacency among the nation’s governments. In fact, the taxes that businesses actually pay depend on the rules that define income, such as depreciation and inventory cost deductions, as well as many other taxes directly related to capital investment. A better measure of the overall business-tax structure is the marginal effective tax rate (METR) for investments. The METR is the amount of corporate income and other capital-related taxes as a percentage of pre-tax profits for marginal investments — investments that earn a rate of return on capital that is just sufficient to <b>attract</b> <b>savings</b> from international markets. The METR calculation takes account, for example, of the lower income taxes payable in countries that allow higher depreciation charges than other jurisdictions, even if the statutory rate is the same or higher. As well, a low statutory tax rate can produce a high effective tax rate if the definition of taxable income permits few deductions. A summary of the 2004 tax provisions is available upon request.

However, {{in many developing countries}} including Pakistan, administered interest rate, domestic credit controls, high reserve requirements, use of captive banking system to finance large budgetary requirements of the government and controls on international capital inflows have remained the main features of the monetary policy.

This paper reports on an experiment to examine whether order handling practices by traditional voice brokers and on-line brokerage firms lead to differences in the quality of trade execution. We test two hypotheses; the first is that execution quality differs among brokers and is positively related to commission rates, and the second is that total trading costs are converging as might be expected in a stable market. In the experiment, we conducted 196 trades, simultaneously purchasing or selling 100 share lots of stock using a voice-based broker, a "brand-name" online broker and a deep discount online broker in each trial. We found 36 percent of our orders received price improvement, a measure of execution quality. The differences among brokers in obtaining price improvements were (weakly) statistically significant for NYSE-listed shares only. The brokers do exhibit statistically significant differences in total trading costs; at a volume of 100 shares commission costs dominate execution quality. We discuss implications for larger lot sizes and speculate on the ability of full-service brokerage firms to maintain high commission charges.

40|$|This study {{examines}} the financial behaviour of Russian households from {{the collapse of}} communism to the financial melt down in August 1998. By transforming savings into investment, financial intermediaries are important to economic growth. In post-Soviet Russia, financial intermediaries were increasingly unable to <b>attract</b> new household <b>savings,</b> as people turned to foreign currency. What determined the allocation of household savings? The study considers the three main alternatives households could turn to: The state savings bank; commercial financial companies; and foreign currency, mainly dollars. But how do we go about to explain the behaviour of millions of individuals over time? Economists usually assume that people maximise returns on their assets. Financial behaviour would then reflect economic variables such as interest rate, exchange rate and inflation. Such a view fits uneasily with observed behaviour in post-Soviet Russia. However, why would people not allocate their savings in the most profitable way? This study holds that to understand why people do what they do, we should listen carefully - although not uncritically - to what they say and how they say it. On this view, we can explain the behaviour of individuals only if we can understand them. And - since social phenomena are constituted by the behaviour of individuals - such understanding is crucial to the causal explanation of macro level phenomena. The historical narrative thus becomes an important vehicle for explanation of the contemporary world. Through analysis of discourses on financial institutions, as they appeared in newspapers of the day and as I have been able to gather from interviews conducted in 2004, this study identifies certain dramatic events that altered the way Russians perceived different financial institutions and their view on trust, risk and profitability, and finds that such changes in perception {{go a long way to}} explain the changes in observed behaviour in this period...|$|R

In recent years the state budget of Ukraine has faced such a big problem as the deficit, due to the excess of spending over income of the state budget. The purpose of writing this article is to research into existing problems of the deficit of the state budget of Ukraine, substantiate causal relationships in the system of insufficient funding of state activities and development of ways of its optimization. During the study we analyzed scientific papers by Ukrainian scientists and experts who explore the problem of the deficit of the state budget, legislative and government materials. We used the following general scientific methods: method of cognition, method of analysis, method of analysis and synthesis, as well as the method of comparison. The essence of the deficit of the budget system and the reasons of its occurrence in Ukraine was considered. Underlying causes of budget deficit in Ukraine are slump in production, decrease in the efficiency of functioning of industries and businesses, unreasoned socio–economic policies, which led to a decline in the volume of gross domestic product and national income. This naturally caused a decrease in the volume of financial resources in the state and reflected in the indicators of the budget in the form of long–term deficit. We defined the dependence of the budget deficit on the government debt. It is established that there is a close relationship between the size of the budget deficit and state debt. Budget deficit increases national debt, and rising debt, in turn, requires additional expenditures for its service and thereby increases the budget deficit. The links of budget deficit to the country's economy were identified. We discovered the consequences of raising interest rate, which, on the one hand, reduces investment attractiveness in the domestic market of the country, on the other hand increases the attractiveness of the foreign financial investments in the country. Significant currency flows lead to the growth of the debt and, as a result, the growth of the currency exchange rate, reduction in the net exports of goods and decreased indicators of investment activity. This reduction is the reason for reducing the level of labour productivity and real income in all of its forms that provokes a decrease in investor confidence, and hence, reduces foreign investment programs and increases the withdrawal of capital abroad. The ways of overcoming budget deficit were substantiated that are based on improving the taxation system, <b>attracting</b> personal <b>savings</b> of the population to the investment sphere, providing financial support to small and medium businesses, enhancing the responsibility of businesses, strengthening control over the payment of state money, reforming taxation system, improving normative and legal support of the budget process. The scientific novelty of the research lies in the establishment of causal relationships of budget deficits for the scientific substantiation of budget management in {{the period of}} the structural transformation of the economy. The practical result is to identify ways of reforming the budget system of Ukraine and its transition to the investment model. A promising direction for further research in this area is developing a model of the budget process on the basis of causal relationships, which is capable of detecting the risks of deficiency and minimizing their impact...|$|R
40|$|In {{the wake}} of the great Recession, there is new urgency in America to address a {{pressing}} need for greater household financial security. From 2007 to 2010, Americans' median net worth fell 38. 8 %, and mean net worth fell 14. 7 %. Americans currently face a $ 6. 6 trillion retirement savings deficit. A bipartisan consensus is within political reach on the need to rebuild household balance sheets with policies that expand private savings and thus enhance middle-class opportunity and security. The decline in wealth from the housing and financial crises, the stagnation in wages, and the inadequacy of retirement <b>savings</b> <b>attract</b> new interest from industry leaders, advocates, and policy leaders on both the left and right. The urgency to enact policies now that improve financial security does not just apply to lower-income americans; these are policies that have the potential to impact most americans. Smart savings policies belong in a pro-growth agenda and can be pursued through modest investments or targeted reforms that policymakers should champion and implement. This report presents the findings from the 2012 Aspen Institute Financial Security Summit. An exclusive gathering of top business leaders, experts, advocates, and media. The summit advanced the dialogue on the public and private solutions that build more savings and wealth in American households, strengthen middle-class opportunity, and improve the economic future of the country. In an election year with a budgetary showdown looming, the Aspen Institute Initiative on Financial security (Aspen IFs) chose to host its first financial security summit in Aspen, Colorado to bring thoughtful leaders together to wrestle with the contours of a new strong and politically feasible financial security vision. With the American economy at crossroads, summit participants revealed compelling consensus around savings policies that have the power to enhance economic mobility and financial security while directing Americans away from a culture of unaffordable consumption. From acclaimed civil rights leaders such as Andrew Young and activists such as Marc Morial to leading conservative scholars such as Douglas Holtz-Eakin and prominent independents such as David Walker, the headlines emerge: Financial security is the key to America's promise to its middle class, and achieving a much greater measure of financial security is a goal that financial industry leaders and consumer advocates believe in and can advance...|$|R
