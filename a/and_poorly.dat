5|$|At 3400 ton, {{the vessel}} is argued to {{be a small}} frigate rather than a corvette, <b>and</b> <b>poorly</b> armed. It's also been alleged that the Indian Navy wanted a vessel with the {{endurance}} of a 3400-ton frigate and an armament of a 1200-ton corvette.|$|E
5|$|Inadequate <b>and</b> <b>poorly</b> {{maintained}} fire-fighting {{and rescue}} systems {{both on the}} vessel and on the jetty: Gulf and Total were held jointly to blame for this. A combination of human failings and financial constraints was the immediate cause.|$|E
5|$|On 6 April 1941, Axis forces invaded Yugoslavia. Poorly {{equipped}} <b>and</b> <b>poorly</b> trained, the Royal Yugoslav Army {{was quickly}} defeated. At this time, Dangić {{was assigned to}} command the gendarmerie unit that escorted King Peter II to Nikšić Airport {{as he left the}} country.|$|E

5|$|At {{the outset}} of the war, Frederick had one of the finest armies in Europe: his troops—any company—could fire at least four volleys a minute, and some of them could fire five. By the end of 1757, {{the course of the war}} had gone well for Prussia, <b>and</b> <b>poorly</b> for Austria. Prussia had {{achieved}} spectacular victories at Rossbach and Leuthen and reconquered parts of Silesia that had fallen to Austria.|$|E
5|$|Darjeeling {{has several}} British-style public schools, which attract pupils {{from all over}} India and a few {{neighbouring}} countries. The varied culture of the town reflects its diverse demographic milieu comprising indigenous Bengali, Nepali, Lepcha, Bhutia, Tibetan, and other mainland Indian ethno-linguistic groups. Darjeeling, alongside its neighbouring town of Kalimpong, was {{the centre of the}} Gorkhaland movement in the 1980s. The town's fragile ecology has been threatened by a rising demand for environmental resources, stemming from growing tourist traffic <b>and</b> <b>poorly</b> planned urbanisation.|$|E
5|$|Despite being outnumbered <b>and</b> <b>poorly</b> equipped, certain Bulgarian units offered fierce resistance, {{delaying the}} Entente advance in Zborsko. However, the {{collapse}} of the front line enabled the Allies to assault Bulgarian positions from multiple directions and eventually quell the last pockets of resistance. The Central Powers' defeat at the Dobro Pole {{played a role in the}} Bulgarian withdrawal from the war and opened the way for the subsequent capture of Vardar Macedonia.|$|E
5000|$|Polhemus {{started the}} 1887 season with Haverhill of the New England League. He hit [...]456 in 51 games and was then {{acquired}} by the major league Indianapolis Hoosiers. However, he hit <b>and</b> fielded <b>poorly</b> <b>and</b> only saw action in 20 games for the Hoosiers.|$|R
5000|$|The {{state machine}} / Paxos {{is used in}} a number of {{commercial}} products that power large scalable systems, such as Chubby, a locking service used by Google applications.

5|$|Despite the {{opposition}} he faced, Alderson transformed the ill-trained <b>and</b> <b>poorly</b> prepared Canadian recruits into tough, veteran soldiers {{and laid the}} foundations for later victories at Vimy Ridge and in other operations. An accomplished sportsman, Alderson wrote several books and was a keen proponent of hunting and yachting, pastimes he believed {{to be at risk}} from developments in motor sports.|$|E
5|$|In April 1940, Winston Churchill {{took control}} of the Military Co-ordination Committee, charged with {{overseeing}} all of the military services. He selected Ismay as his chief staff officer, which also gave Ismay the additional responsibility of serving on the Chiefs of Staff Committee. While serving under Churchill had been a life-long dream for Ismay, he was initially sceptical about the duties of his new position, which seemed unclear <b>and</b> <b>poorly</b> defined.|$|E
5|$|Interactions with divers {{show that}} the prickly shark behaves inoffensively towards humans, either tolerating contact or fleeing when closely approached. It is {{susceptible}} to incidental capture by commercial bottom trawls, gillnets, or line gear. It has little commercial value since the meat is soft <b>and</b> <b>poorly</b> regarded. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed the prickly shark as Near Threatened, citing its patchy known distribution and the continuing expansion of deepwater fisheries.|$|E

5|$|LACM 149371 was {{described}} in 2004 by Francisco Goin and colleagues, who tentatively interpreted the tooth as a left last upper molar. Although they saw similarities with South American ungulates, some early rodents, and multituberculates, they believed the tooth was most likely of a gondwanathere. Among gondwanatheres—a small <b>and</b> <b>poorly</b> known group otherwise known from the Cretaceous through Eocene {{of some of the}} southern continents (Gondwana)—they thought the Cretaceous Argentinian Ferugliotherium to be the most similar.|$|E
5|$|Lili caused {{extensive}} damage through the Caribbean, particularly to crops <b>and</b> <b>poorly</b> built homes. Mudslides were common {{on the more}} mountainous islands, particularly Haiti and Jamaica. In the United States, the storm cut off the production of oil within the Gulf of Mexico, and caused severe damage in parts of Louisiana. Lili was also responsible for severe damage to the barrier islands and marshes in the southern portion of the state. Total damage amounted to $925million (2002USD), and the storm killed 15people during its existence.|$|E
5|$|Stalin's {{willingness}} to expend recently conscripted armies, which were poorly trained <b>and</b> <b>poorly</b> supplied, illustrated a misconception of realities, {{both in the}} capabilities of the Red Army and the subordinate arms of the armed forces, and in the abilities of the Germans to defend themselves and successfully launch a counteroffensive. The latter proved especially true in the subsequent Case Blue, which led to the Battle of Stalingrad, though this was the battle in which Paulus faced an entirely different outcome.|$|E

5|$|The 2015 Fantastic Four {{film was}} the weakest {{reviewed}} of the series; it was criticised for its dark, humorless tone, its character arcs, designs (especially that of Dr. Doom), bland acting, <b>and</b> <b>poorly</b> written story. Josh Trank, {{who directed the}} film, was himself not satisfied, posting a message on Twitter stating he had a better version of the film, but was ruined by Fox; he later deleted the message.|$|E
5|$|The Go-Getter debuted on January 22, 2007 at the Sundance Film Festival and {{was given}} a limited {{theatrical}} release on June 6, 2008 by Peace Arch Entertainment. Its run lasted just three days, and it grossed only US$11,931. Critics were divided {{in reaction to the}} film; some praised the performances, the dialogue and the cinematography, while others thought it was unoriginal, forgettable, <b>and</b> <b>poorly</b> acted.|$|E
5|$|The {{characters}} were similarly well received. Bob Mackey of 1UP.com and Martin Robinson of Eurogamer called them believable and {{easy for the}} player to care about. IGN's Lucas M. Thomas was satisfied by development of each character, while Mike Manson of Nintendo Life considered each characters' motives to be unique and interesting. In contrast, Boosinger found the characters to be uncompelling <b>and</b> <b>poorly</b> written, and believed {{that there was little}} reason to care for them until their backstories were revealed.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{levels of}} protein {{carboxyl}} methyltransferase, an enzyme that methylates free carboxyl groups of proteins, were determined in normal human proliferative and secretory endometrium <b>and</b> in <b>poorly</b> <b>and</b> well-differentiated endometrial carcinoma. Protein carboxyl methyltransferase activity was 67 % {{higher in the}} well-differentiated carcinoma than in the normal tissues, while similar enzyme levels were observed in the two normal tissues <b>and</b> in the <b>poorly</b> differentiated carcinoma. The results suggest that in the well-differentiated tumor there is excessive protein methylation and offer a possible biochemical probe for distinguishing between {{the two types of}} tumor...|$|R
5|$|The {{experience}} reinforced Drake's {{decision to}} retreat from live appearances; the few concerts he did play around this time were usually brief, awkward, <b>and</b> <b>poorly</b> attended. Drake seemed reluctant to perform and rarely addressed his audience. As many of his songs were played in different tunings, he frequently paused to retune between numbers.|$|E
5|$|The {{series has}} been well received. The light novels {{appeared}} on Sugoi Japan's 2015 polls and since 2011, {{is one of the}} top selling series in Japan with 5.3 million copies sold as of 2014. In addition, its manga and anime adaptations also appeared on top selling charts. English reviewers had mixed to negative reception towards the anime adaptation. The complex technicality of magic within the series was received warmly but the exposition was criticized for being heavy, unclear, <b>and</b> <b>poorly</b> executed.|$|E
5|$|When first {{exhibited}} at the 1828 Royal Academy Summer Exhibition the painting attracted large crowds, and strongly divided critical opinion.

5000|$|With a low budget {{production}} and insufficient marketing, Psychotic Reaction peaked at #122 on the Billboard 200. Other singles, released between 1966 <b>and</b> 1969, sold <b>poorly</b> <b>and</b> did not chart (some {{not included in}} the original LP).|$|R
