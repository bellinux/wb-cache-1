40|$|A {{combination}} of factors lead to the widespread conversion of South African retirement funds from defined benefit to defined contribution across the 1980 ’s and early 1990 ’s. There were minimal legislative and regulatory constraints, particularly where the conversion was achieved by amendment {{to the rules of}} the fund rather than transfer to another fund. There were no South African professional guidance notes. Converting members received their <b>accrued</b> <b>liability</b> within the defined benefit fund using an ongoing fund valuation basis, often with a “sweetener ” to encourage conversion. Any share of the actuarial surplus or of the difference between the fair value of the assets and the actuarial value of the assets was left to be negotiated between stakeholders. In practice much if not all of the actuarial surplus and the difference between the market value and actuarial value was left behind in the conversion, releasing and concentrating actuarial surplus in the residual defined benefit scheme. These residual schemes were usually closed to new entrants. With the passage of time and the outsourcing of existing pensions payable from funds to insurers through the purchase of annuity policies, the membership of the residual schemes has dwindled.

40|$|ABSTRACT Earnings Management (EM) is {{an effort}} {{performed}} by company management as financial report issuer on purpose to influence the readers and stakeholders behavior who rely on financial reports as their primary information source, in accordance with firm managements’ direction.   EM motivations may vary, from remuneration reason, merger and acquisition event, to comply with particular requirement and regulation, to initial public offering (IPO) motivation. This study revealed EM effort in IPO event due to management motivation to demonstrate good performance to public before and during such activity. This study took 50 IPO firms listed at Jakarta Stock Exchange (JSX) within 1998 - 2002. EM detection adopted Modified Jones Model as a powerful model to detect EM. Test result proved that EM was occurred on JSX IPO firms as stated by positive discretionary accruals (DA).                  Further study tried to reveal accounts used as EM tools. This study utilized linear regression with DA as fixed variable to indicate EM and predicted accounts on financial reports used as way to do EM as explanatory variables. Such explanatory variables are account receivable, account payable, inventory, <b>accrued</b> <b>liability,</b> accumulated depreciation, expenses (selling and general administrative) and other income (expense). Test result showed that only two variables statistically significant to dependent variable, i. e. DA, they were account receivable and account payable. This result supports a study by Marquardt and Wiedman (2002) who found that EM during IPO activity was influenced by account receivable in positive direction. However, this study does not support Wiedyaningdyah (2001) who concluded IPO activity in JSX during 1994 - 1997 was significantly influenced by liability (leverage). This study recommends investors or any other parties who rely on firm financial report during IPO activity on JSX to behave more conservative on net income as reported by related firms and considers account receivable and account payable as accounts need to be reviewed prior to any economical decision making related to the financial reports.

40|$|In {{defined benefit}} pension plans, the primary {{function}} of the actuarial valuation is to determine appropriate contribution rates from the plan sponsor.

The concern about the unfunded liabilities of retiree health plans follows from a change in the public accounting rules issued by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB).

40|$|The {{developed}} word {{stands at}} the fore of a phenomenal demographic transition. Over the next 30 years the number of elderly in the U. S., the EU, and Japan will more than double. At the same time, {{the number of workers}} available to pay the elderly their government-guaranteed pension and health care benefits will rise by less than 10 percent. The fiscal implications of these two demographic trends are alarming. Paying promised benefits will, it appears, require a doubling or more of payroll tax rates. This paper asks if there is a silver lining in this dark cloud hanging over the developed world. Specifically, can the developed economies hope to be bailed out by either macroeconomic feedback effects of by increased migration? To address these questions, this paper develops and simulates a dynamic, intergeneration, and interregional demographic life-cycle model. The model has three regions the U. S. Japan which exchange goods and capital. The model features immigration, age-specific fertility, life span extension, life span uncertainty, bequests arising from incomplete annuitization, and intra-cohort heterogeneity. Other things equal, one would expect the aging of the developed economies to increase capital per worker as the number of suppliers of capital (the old) rises relative to the number of suppliers of labor (the young). But given the need to pay the elderly their benefits, other things are far from equal. According to our simulations, the tax hikes needed to finance benefits along the demographic transition path generate a major capital shortage that lowers real wages by 19 percent and raises real interest rates by over 400 basis points. Hence, far from mitigating the developed world's fiscal problems, macroeconomic feedback effects make matters significantly worse. The simulations also show that increased immigration does very little to mitigate the fiscal stresses facing the developed world. On the other hand, there are policies that can materially improve the developed world's long-term prospects. The one examined here is closing down, at the margin, existing government pension systems and using consumption taxes to pay off those program's <b>accrued</b> <b>liabilities.</b> This policy could be coupled with the establishment of a fully funded mandatory individual saving system. According to our simulations, this policy would impose modest welfare losses on current generations, but generate enormous welfare gains for future generations. Future Europeans and Japanese benefit the most. Their net wages almost triple, and their welfare levels double compared with the no-reform scenario. ...|$|E
