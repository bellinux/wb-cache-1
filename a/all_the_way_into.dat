5|$|On November 11, 1926, the United States Numbered Highway System was {{approved}} by the American Association of State Highway Officials (AASHO), and the new US27 replaced M-29 from the state line northward to Lansing. By the end of the next year, M-78 was extended from Charlotte north and east of Lansing to a junction with M-47 near Pittsburg, north of the modern I-69. The section of M-78 north of Lansing was changed in 1929; the segment from Dewitt to Pittsburg was redesignated M-104, and M-78 was rerouted along a more southerly path through East Lansing to Haslett. By 1936, M-78 was extended from Haslett <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> Flint to end at M-21. The first span of the Blue Water Bridge opened between Port Huron and Point Edward, Ontario, in 1938.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech {{began its}} first full drive {{of the fourth}} quarter at its 41-yard line with 10:21 {{remaining}} in the game. Tech transitioned into a running strategy, maximizing {{the amount of time}} used off the game clock between each play. On the drive's first play, Stith was tackled for a one-yard loss. On its second play, Stith regained the lost yard. The third-down play was an incomplete pass by Clark, and the Hokies punted after going three and out. The kick rolled into the end zone for a touchback, and Alabama's offense began at its 20-yard line. Alexander was tackled for a two-yard loss, then Zow threw an interception to Anthony Midget, who returned the ball <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> the end zone for a Virginia Tech defensive touchdown. The extra point was good, and Tech extended its lead to 387 with 7:33 remaining in the game.|$|E

5|$|When the {{original}} state highway system was designated , M-78 ran along a route similar that of today. It started north of Battle Creek at a junction with then M-79 and {{cut through the}} corner of Barry County to Bellevue, but it turned northeasterly to end at Charlotte at a junction with M-29. By 1927, M-78 was extended southward, replacing M-79 to the Indiana state line, connecting with State Road9 (SR9) south of Sturgis. At the same time, a northerly addition extended the highway concurrently along US Highway 27 (US27) to Dewitt and then solo to a junction with M-47 near Pittsburg. The section north of Lansing was changed in 1929. The section from Dewitt Pittsburg was redesignated M-104, and M-78 was extended through East Lansing to Haslett. By 1936, the highway was extended <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> Flint to end at M-21. Around the same time, a second routing through downtown Lansing for US27/M-78 was designated along Capitol Avenue; the former route along Main, Kalamazoo and Larch streets and Grand Avenue was given the Truck M-78 designation.|$|E
5|$|In 2012–13, Benfica's {{run in the}} Champions League run was not so successful, {{and they}} dropped again to the Europa League. In this tournament, however, the team excelled and reached their ninth European final, 23 years after their last appearance. On 17 May 2013, Benfica played the final against the Champions League holders Chelsea, losing 2–1 with an injury-time header from Branislav Ivanović and {{extending}} the club's run of European final losses to seven. In an almost identical 2013–14 season, Benfica competed in the Europa League after failing to overcome the Champions League group stage, and advanced <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> a second successive final. In the progress, they eliminated Juventus in the semi-finals, after a tense match in Turin, where the final was to be played. On 15 May 2014, Benfica faced the 2006 and 2007 winners Sevilla, missing usual starters Enzo Pérez, Lazar Marković and Eduardo Salvio, who were suspended due to yellow card accumulation. The match ended goalless after 120 minutes of play and was decided through a penalty shootout, which Benfica lost 4–2 after Rodrigo and Óscar Cardozo had their penalty kicks stopped by Beto. For the eight time – and second in two years – Benfica were unable to lift a European trophy. In the following season, they returned to UEFA's prime tournament, but did not progress further than the group stage {{for the fourth time}} since 2010. In 2015–16, Benfica reached their fourth knock-out stage of the Champions League. They eliminated Zenit Saint Petersburg in the last 16, and qualified for the quarter-finals for their 18th time, where they lost 3–2 on aggregate to Bayern Munich.|$|E
