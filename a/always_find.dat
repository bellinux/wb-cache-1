5|$|Eliot invokes {{images of}} {{original}} sin and Adam's fall when talking about the past and points out that such events can be forgotten but can still affect mankind. Eliot brings {{in the image of}} Krishna to discuss how the past and future are related: Krishna, speaking to Arjuna, claims that death can come at any time and that men should <b>always</b> <b>find</b> the divine will instead of worrying about what their actions will bring. If an individual were to follow Krishna's words then {{they would be able to}} free their self from the limitations of time. Even if it cannot be fully attained, the effort in attempting it is still important. The way for mankind to understand the divine will is through prayer and through the power of the Holy Spirit.|$|E
5|$|Kojima Productions have {{compared}} Raiden and Solid Snake {{as to their}} experiences and ways of thinking. During the game's climax, Raiden stays handcuffed until his final fight against Solidus Snake; Snake escapes from his handcuffs to follow Revolver Ocelot, emphasizing Raiden's lack of freedom. Hideo Kojima compared Raiden and Snake with movie monsters King Kong and Godzilla, respectively; the former was taken from his home and his nature changed upon meeting Rosemary, whereas the latter will continue fighting against mankind's menaces. Defeating Solidus, Raiden is encouraged by Snake to trust himself and believe in his own choices. This is further addressed by the staff's motivation {{to make a new}} sequel to Metal Gear without Kojima. Kojima has also likened him with John Rambo from the Rambo series as both characters <b>always</b> <b>find</b> themselves taking part in battles despite their desire for a peaceful resolution.|$|E
5|$|The {{main idea}} of the {{algorithm}} is to find pairs of clusters to merge by following paths in the nearest neighbor graph of the clusters. Every such path will eventually terminate at a pair of clusters that are nearest neighbors of each other, and the algorithm chooses that pair of clusters as the pair to merge. In order to save work by re-using {{as much as possible}} of each path, the algorithm uses a stack data structure to keep track of each path that it follows. By following paths in this way, the nearest-neighbor chain algorithm merges its clusters in a different order than methods that <b>always</b> <b>find</b> and merge the closest pair of clusters. However, despite that difference, it always generates the same hierarchy of clusters.|$|E

25|$|Some are so {{different}} {{that they do not}} even remotely resemble the original festival despite sharing the same name and date. There are also various local festivals (e.g. Tobata Gion) that are mostly unknown outside a given prefecture. It is commonly said that you will <b>always</b> <b>find</b> a festival somewhere in Japan.|$|E
25|$|The {{left hand}} tableau closes after only one rule {{application}} while {{the right hand}} one misses the mark and takes a lot longer to close. Clearly, we would prefer to <b>always</b> <b>find</b> the shortest closed tableaux {{but it can be}} shown that one single algorithm that finds the shortest closed tableaux for all input sets of formulae cannot exist.|$|E
25|$|One can <b>always</b> <b>find</b> in the {{vicinity}} of a matsuri booths selling souvenirs and food such as takoyaki, and games, such as Goldfish scooping. Karaoke contests, sumo matches, and other forms of entertainment are often organized in conjunction with matsuri. If the festival is next to a lake, renting a boat is also an attraction.|$|E

Though always part of the town, {{the soldiers}} (leathernecks) could <b>always</b> <b>find</b> opponents such as the fishermen (squids) and rivalries, not always healthy, resulted. However, many soldiers married Queenscliff lasses and there are frequent cases of whole families of men joining the Service, sometimes over three generations.|$|E
25|$|Most {{studies in}} {{neurology}} have too few test subjects to be scientifically sure. Those insufficient size studies {{are the basis}} for all domain-specific diagnoses in neuropsychiatry, since the few large enough studies there are <b>always</b> <b>find</b> individuals with the brain changes thought {{to be associated with}} a mental condition but without any of the symptoms. The only diagnoses that can be validated through large enough brain studies are those on serious brain damages and neurodegenerative diseases that destroy most of the brain.|$|E
25|$|Toroidal groups play an {{important}} part in the theory of compact Lie groups. This {{is due in part to}} the fact that in any compact Lie group G one can <b>always</b> <b>find</b> a maximal torus; that is, a closed subgroup which is a torus of the largest possible dimension. Such maximal tori T have a controlling role to play in theory of connected G. Toroidal groups are examples of protori, which (like tori) are compact connected abelian groups, which are not required to be manifolds.|$|E

25|$|There is a {{right and}} left side door {{on the front of}} the iconostasis, one {{depicting}} the archangel, Michael and the other Gabriel. The priest and altar boys enter and exit through these doors during appropriate parts of the Divine Liturgy. Immediately to the right of the main gate you will <b>always</b> <b>find</b> an icon of Jesus Christ, on the left, an icon of the Theotokos (Mother of God). Other icons depicted on the iconostasis are Saint John the Forerunner and the Saint after which the church is named.|$|E
25|$|With another battle won, Mueller {{still found}} {{that he could not}} <b>always</b> <b>find</b> the right people with the right skills. Using his {{background}} with Air Force projects, Mueller sought Webb's permission to bring in skilled Air Force program managers. He proposed Minuteman program director Colonel Samuel C. Phillips as Apollo program director in OMSF. Webb agreed, and so did AFSC chief General Bernard Schriever. Phillips in turn agreed and brought with him 42 mid-grade officers and eventually 124 more junior officers. Ultimately, over 400 experienced military officers worked on Apollo and other NASA programs during the 1960s.|$|E
25|$|This {{iteration}} method produces two {{roots of the}} quintic. The remaining three roots {{can be obtained by}} using synthetic division to divide the two roots out, producing a cubic equation. It is to be noted that due to the way the iteration is formulated, this method seems to <b>always</b> <b>find</b> two complex conjugate roots of the quintic even when all the quintic coefficients are real and the starting guess is real. This {{iteration method}} is derived by from the symmetries of the icosahedron and is closely related to the method Felix Klein describes in his book.|$|E

25|$|Any n-vertex forest has pathwidth O(logn).(2n+1) on the pathwidth of an n-vertex forest. For, in a forest, one can <b>always</b> <b>find</b> a {{constant}} number of vertices {{the removal of}} which leaves a forest that can be partitioned into two smaller subforests with at most 2n/3 vertices each. A linear arrangement formed by recursively partitioning each of these two subforests, placing the separating vertices between them, has logarithmic vertex searching number. The same technique, applied to a tree-decomposition of a graph, shows that, if the treewidth of an n-vertex graph G is t, then the pathwidth of G is O(tlogn). Since outerplanar graphs, series-parallel graphs, and Halin graphs all have bounded treewidth, they all also have at most logarithmic pathwidth.|$|E
25|$|Baiza {{buses and}} colour-coded orange-and-white taxis are unmetered, after several {{government}} initiatives to introduce meters were rejected. The fare is set {{by way of}} negotiation, although taxi drivers usually adhere to certain unwritten rules for fares within the city. In many countries, one is advised to negotiate a fare with the driver before getting into a taxi. However, in Oman, asking for the fare beforehand often demonstrates a passenger's newness and unfamiliarity with the area. One should <b>always</b> <b>find</b> out the normally accepted fare for one's journey from one's hotel or host before looking for a taxi. Taxis will also generally take passengers to locations out of the city, including Sohar, Buraimi and Dubai.|$|E
25|$|Following the Russian Revolution, the Russian Empire {{was broken}} up. In {{different}} parts of the former empire, several nations, including Ukrainians, developed a renewed sense of national identity. In the chaotic post-revolutionary years the Ukrainian language gained some usage in government affairs. Initially, this trend continued under the Bolshevik government of the Soviet Union, which in a political struggle to retain its grip over the territory had to encourage the national movements of the former Russian Empire. While trying to ascertain and consolidate its power, the Bolshevik government was by far more concerned about many political oppositions connected to the pre-revolutionary order than about the national movements inside the former empire, where it could <b>always</b> <b>find</b> allies.|$|E
