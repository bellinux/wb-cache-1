Lacorix {{wrote that the}} Super X Cup Final [...] "could have been a certified Match of the Year contender if someone in the back had not decided to make Daniels interfere in this contest." [...] He {{went on to say}} the match [...] "was <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>of</b> <b>beauty</b> that got stained." [...] Wade Keller of the Pro Wrestling Torch gave the Super X Cup Final four stars out of five, calling it a [...] "four star match that was begging to be given an extra ten minutes to be a match of the year candidate." ...|$|E
500|$|While {{reviewing}} a 1983 {{concert by}} the Smiths and the Go-Betweens at The Venue in London, Barney Hoskyns, {{writing for the}} NME, described [...] "Hand in Glove" [...] as [...] "one of the year's few masterpieces, <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>of</b> <b>beauty</b> and a joy forever". In the 1984 edition of The Rock Yearbook, Hoskyns said the song [...] "swept into my heart". Bill Black, writing for Sounds, {{described it as a}} [...] "daunting" [...] debut. Writing for Allmusic, Ned Raggett called the song a [...] "stunning, surprising debut" [...] and describes the music as [...] "sparkling," [...] highlighting Marr's [...] "careful overdubbing of acoustic and electric guitars". He also described Rourke's bass and Joyce's drumming as [...] "sparse but effective", and said that Joyce [...] "especially shone".|$|E

[...] And Norbert Lusk of the movie magazine Picture Play said Garbo's performance [...] "is <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>of</b> pure <b>beauty,</b> <b>an</b> inspiring blend of intellect and emotion, a tender, poignant, poetic portrait {{of a woman who}} thrusts love from her because she considers herself unworthy of the man who offers it." ...|$|R
2500|$|The Introduction closes with Arthur – still {{refusing to}} claim that the play is real – facilitating its {{publication}} anyway. Arthur meditates on the artificiality of endings, and points out that the reader's reaction to The Tragedy of Arthur rests on how they interpret the story told in the Introduction. He sums up the project by claiming that those [...] "who know [...] personally know to a fine degree how much of all this is true, how much an apology (and how sincere), how much a boast or a con job. To the rest of you, it's a muddle or it's <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>of</b> <b>beauty.</b> And if it pleased you, and you found in its candor and lies and sobbing cross-dressed confessions some hours' entertainment, then well and good." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hastings {{represents}} the traditional English gentleman—not too bright but absolutely scrupulous, {{a throwback to}} the Victorian-era gentleman who is always concerned about [...] "fair play". Hastings himself notes that he is somewhat old-fashioned. While Poirot, who is not above lying, surreptitiously reads other people's letters or eavesdrops, Hastings is horrified of such acts and usually refuses to perform them to help Poirot in one of his cases. Although he lacks Poirot's intellect, Poirot often compliments Hastings' ability to remember facts and details about their cases even if he deplores the manner in which Hastings tells the story at times. Hastings' physical appearance is rarely described in the novels because he is often the narrator. However, it is mentioned that he, like Poirot, has a moustache which becomes a target of the detective's criticism in Peril at End House: 'And your moustache. If you must have a moustache, let it be a real moustache, <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>of</b> <b>beauty</b> such as mine.' Although he has served in the army, Hastings is not a ruthless man by nature, with Poirot noting during his final letter to Hastings in Curtain that he knows that Hastings is not a murderer.|$|E

AllMusic write that [...] "Wainwright's husky voice has matured into <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>of</b> real <b>beauty,</b> and her ability to sound both majestic and totally wrecked helps to humanize each track".|$|R

[...] and [...] "It's <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>of</b> great <b>beauty</b> because it's a challenge, a desecration of something people hold sacred.

50|$|When he {{returned}} to Cornwall, beam engine designs were crude, shackled by outdated Watt patents and poor engineering. He learned from Bramah that to move forward meant adopting much improved engineering techniques, for it was Bramah who invented quality control. Woolf was chief engineer to Harvey & Co of Hayle, a leading engineering and foundry works. They eventually swallowed up the rival Copperhouse Foundry run by Sandys, Carne and Vivian. For very many years they were a leading firm worldwide for drainage engines, even supplying 6 eight-beamed pumping engines to the Dutch government to drain the Haarlemmermeer (see Museum De Cruquius). By the time Woolf retired in 1836 the Cornish engine, largely due to his efforts, was <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>of</b> magnificent <b>beauty</b> and efficiency.|$|R

The kindly dimness of the weak candle abstracted from her form and features the little blemishes which sunlight might have revealed--the stubble scratches upon her wrists, and the weariness of her eyes--her high enthusiasm having a transfiguring effect upon the face which had been her undoing, showing it as <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>of</b> immaculate <b>beauty,</b> with <b>a</b> touch of dignity which was almost regal. The little ones kneeling round, their sleepy eyes blinking and red, awaited her preparations full of a suspended wonder which their physical heaviness at that hour would not allow to become active.|$|R

2500|$|Tatar {{observes that}} [...] "The Emperor's New Clothes" [...] {{is one of}} Andersen's best-known tales and one that has {{acquired}} an iconic status globally as it migrates across various cultures reshaping itself with each retelling {{in the manner of}} oral folktales. [...] Scholars have noted that the phrase, [...] "Emperor's new clothes", has become a standard metaphor for anything that smacks of pretentiousness, pomposity, social hypocrisy, collective denial, or hollow ostentatiousness. [...] Historically, the tale established Andersen's reputation as a children's author whose stories actually imparted lessons of value for his juvenile audience, and [...] "romanticized" [...] children by [...] "investing them with the courage to challenge authority and to speak truth to power." [...] With each successive description of the swindlers' wonderful cloth, it becomes more substantial, more palpable, and <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>of</b> imaginative <b>beauty</b> for the reader even though it has no material existence. Its beauty, however, is obscured {{at the end of the}} tale with the obligatory moral message for children. Tatar is left wondering if the real value of the tale is the creation of the wonderful fabric in the reader's imagination or the tale's closing message of speaking truth no matter how humiliating to the recipient.|$|R

He used to tell me how he worked on the matches in his office, and of how a young pipe-smoking Englishman named Philby used to regularly visit him and peer over his shoulder and admire the progress he was making. Gardner was rather a sad figure by the late 1960s. He felt very keenly that the cryptanalytical break he had made possible was <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>of</b> mathematical <b>beauty,</b> and he was depressed at the use to which it had been put." [...] Wright revealed that Gardner was upset that his research had resulted in McCarthyism and the executions of Julius Rosenberg and Ethel Rosenberg. Wright quotes Gardner as saying: [...] "I never wanted it to get anyone into trouble." [...] Wright added that Gardner [...] "was appalled at the fact that his discovery had led, almost inevitably, to the electric chair, and felt (as I did) that the Rosenbergs, while guilty, ought to have been given clemency. In Gardner's mind, VENONA was almost an art form, and he did not want it sullied by crude McCarthyism." ...|$|R
