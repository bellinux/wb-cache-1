2500|$|On {{the centennial}} of Escrivá's birthday, Cardinal Ratzinger (who became Pope Benedict XVI) commented: [...] "I have always been {{impressed}} by Josemaría Escrivá's explanation of the name 'Opus Dei': an explanation ... gives {{us an idea of}} the founder's spiritual profile. Escrivá knew he had to found something, but he was also conscious that what he was founding was not his own work, that he himself did not invent anything and that the Lord was merely making use of him. So it was not his work, but Opus Dei (God's Work). [...] gives us to understand that he was in a permanent dialogue, a real contact with the One who created us and works for us <b>and</b> <b>with</b> <b>us...</b> If therefore St Josemaría speaks of the common vocation to holiness, {{it seems to me that}} he is basically drawing on his own personal experience, not of having done incredible things himself, but of having let God work. Therefore a renewal, a force for good was born in the world even if human weaknesses will always remain." ...|$|E
