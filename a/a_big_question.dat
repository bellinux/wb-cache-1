China summoned the Norwegian ambassador in Beijing [...] "to officially share their opinion, their disagreement and their protest." [...] A PRC foreign ministry spokesman accused politicians from [...] "some countries" [...] {{for using the}} award to further their own political agendas: [...] "This is not only disrespect for China's judicial system but also puts <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>question</b> mark on their true intention." [...] The ministry's statement, labelling the decision [...] "a blasphemy", was carried on Chinese state television.|$|E
500|$|Leaders of some {{countries}} reserved {{enthusiasm for the}} Obama inauguration, with coverage of the event even muted in some places. Cuban President Raúl Castro, brother of former Cuban president Fidel Castro, declared that [...] " [...] looks like a good man, I hope he is lucky", while Ricardo Alarcón, president of the Cuban legislature, admitted in his comments about Obama that [...] "the incoming [...] president 'is <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>question</b> mark.'" [...] Iranian Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki expressed hope for openness for a new direction, noting that [...] "if Obama chooses the right path, compensates the past, lifts hostility and U.S.hegemony, and revises the previous political mistakes, we will have no hostility." [...] State-owned Channel One Russia, Russia's flagship early evening news show, covered Obama's presidential inauguration as a minor news story, devoting much of the day's airtime instead to the gas war with Ukraine. The People's Republic of China covered the Obama inauguration live on its state‑controlled China Central Television, providing simultaneous translation into Mandarin Chinese with a brief delay to allow censoring of Obama's comments. When President Obama mentioned [...] "earlier generations faced down fascism and communism", Chinese state television officials cut away abruptly from the televised speech and switched to a discussion in the studio. State-controlled print, radio and television media in North Korea provided no coverage or mention of the Obama inauguration in the hours after the event, opting instead to cover news about Equatorial Guinea welcoming the North Korean ambassador.|$|E
500|$|Despite the acquittal, {{the broader}} public {{perception}} was strong that Thorpe had not behaved well, nor had he adequately explained himself. The Archdeacon of Barnstaple, who {{was critical of}} Hornby's melodramatic thanksgiving service, wrote: [...] "There {{is a great deal}} of unhappiness [...] about the result at the Old Bailey. [...] As far as most people are concerned, the trial ended with <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>question</b> mark over the case". Prevented by his party from a return to active politics, in 1982 Thorpe was appointed by Amnesty International as director of its British section, but after protests from the organisation's staff, he withdrew. Not long afterwards, Thorpe first showed signs of the Parkinson's disease that led to his almost complete withdrawal into private life in the mid-1980s. There was a political reconciliation when, in 1988, following the merger of the Liberals and the Social Democratic Party, the newly formed North Devon Liberal Democrat association made him their honorary president. When he attended the Liberal Democrat party conference in 1997 he received a standing ovation. In 1999, Thorpe published his political memoir, In My Own Time, in which he justified his silence at the trial, and stated that he had never doubted the outcome. Nine years later, in January 2008, Thorpe gave his first press interview in 25 years, to The Guardian. Referring to the affair he said: [...] "If it happened now I think the public would be kinder. Back then they were very troubled by it... It offended their set of values." [...] Thorpe died on 4 December 2014.|$|E

2500|$|In 1951, St. John's became coeducational, admitting {{women for}} the first time in its then-254-year history. There was some {{objection}} from students because they had not been involved in—nor even aware of—the decision before it was announced to the media, and from some who believed that the college could not remain a serious institution were it to admit women. Martin Dyer reported that women who were admitted quickly proved they were the academic and intellectual equals of their male counterparts. As enrollment grew during the 1950s, and facing the coming larger baby-boom generation, thoughts turned again towards opening another campus—but this time in addition to, not instead of, the one in Annapolis. Serious talk of expansion began in 1959 when the father of a student from Monterey, California, suggested to President Weigle that he establish a new campus there. Time (magazine) ran an article on the college's possible expansion plans, and, in addition to California, 32 offers came in to the college, from New Hampshire, Oregon, Georgia, Alaska, Florida, Connecticut, and other states. A group from the Monterey Peninsula told Weigle that they were definitely interested, though funding was a problem, and suitable land was <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>question.</b> There was also an offer of land in Claremont, California, but competition with the other colleges there for students and financial contributions was a negative. The Riverside Mission Inn (in Riverside, California) was another possibility, but with only [...] of land and lots of renovations needed to the inn, funding was again a major question. A negative factor for California in general was the cost of living for faculty.|$|E

60|$|I {{perceived}} we were embarked upon {{a discussion}} of the elements. We began an interesting little wrangle one of those crude discussions of general ideas that are dear to the heart of youth. I and Margaret supported one another as socialists, Gertrude and Sybil and the initial maintained an anti-socialist position, the curate attempted a cross-bench position with an air of intending to come down upon us presently with a casting vote. He reminded us of a number of useful principles too often overlooked in argument, that in <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>question</b> like this there was much to be said on both sides, that if every one did his or her duty to every one about them there would be no difficulty with social problems at all, that over and above all enactments we needed moral changes in people themselves. My cousin Gertrude was a difficult controversialist to manage, being unconscious of inconsistency in statement and absolutely impervious to reply. Her standpoint was essentially materialistic; she didn't see why she shouldn't have a good time because other people didn't; they would have a good time, she was sure, if she didn't. She said that if we did give up everything we had to other people, they wouldn't very likely {{know what to do with}} it. She asked if we were so fond of work-people, why we didn't go and live among them, and expressed the inflexible persuasion that if we HAD socialism, everything would be just the same again in ten years' time. She also threw upon us the imputation of ingratitude for a beautiful world by saying that so far as she was concerned she didn't want to upset everything. She was contented with things as they were, thank you.|$|E

6000|$|Count Otto {{wondered}} if the friend she had written to were her lover {{and if they had}} plighted their troth, especially when she alluded to him again as [...] "that gentleman who's coming down." [...] He asked her about her travels, her impressions, whether she had been long in Europe and what she liked best, and she put it to him that they had gone abroad, she and her family, for a little fresh experience. Though he found her very intelligent he suspected she gave this as a reason because he was a German and she had heard the Germans were rich in culture. He wondered what form of culture Mr. and Mrs. Day had brought back from Italy, Greece and Palestine--they had travelled for two years and been everywhere--especially when their daughter said: [...] "I wanted father and mother to see the best things. I kept them three hours on the Acropolis. I guess they won't forget that!" [...] Perhaps it was of Phidias and Pericles they were thinking, Vogelstein reflected, as they sat ruminating in their rugs. Pandora remarked also that she wanted to show her little sister everything while she was comparatively unformed ("comparatively!" [...] he mutely gasped); remarkable sights made so much more impression when the mind was fresh: she had read something of that sort somewhere in Goethe. She had wanted to come herself when she was her sister's age; but her father was in business then and they couldn't leave Utica. The young man thought of the little sister frisking over the Parthenon and the Mount of Olives and sharing for two years, the years of the school-room, this extraordinary pilgrimage of her parents; he wondered whether Goethe's dictum had been justified in this case. He asked Pandora if Utica were the seat of her family, if it were an important or typical place, if it would be an interesting city for him, as a stranger, to see. His companion replied frankly that this was <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>question,</b> but added that all the same she would ask him to [...] "come and visit us at our home" [...] if it weren't that they should probably soon leave it.|$|E

Agriculture produces approximately 10 % of greenhouse gasses (GHGs) (CO 2, CH 4, N 2 O).

It is suggested that such repetition is not an unforeseen by-product of the editing and collation process, nor is it simply an editorial desire to include all tried and tested texts regardless of overlap. Rather repetition serves a theological function, which comes into focus when we consider Old Testament texts {{as a form of}} testimony. In the light of Deuteronomy 19 : 15 and questions of trustworthy testimony, it is suggested that textual repetition in the Old Testament serves to foreground a claim to the nature of these texts as reliable witness to the God of Israel.
