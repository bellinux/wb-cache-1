25|$|We {{said this}} movie is a stylized movie, it’s not so {{different}} from the world of a musical. And there were <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>other</b> <b>things</b> that contributed to that direction. One was the decision on Universal’s part, a crazy decision, to shoot the movie almost entirely in the studio under a tarpaulin. They built this gigantic tarpaulin, and the Battery and all these other places were built as real places. The Richlands. And just so you know, this is the early ’80s and you had stylized films—like New York, New York—that were all done on set and that idea was in the air. That idea of a totally artificial universe. The point is that we had in mind one sentence inspired by George Lucas: “in a galaxy long ago,” a futuristic past. That was in our heads…there’s the past and there’s the future, sort of.|$|E
2500|$|The {{phonology}} of Danish {{is similar}} to that of the other Scandinavian languages such as [...] Swedish and Norwegian, but it also has distinct features setting it apart from the phonologies of its most closely related languages. For example Danish has a suprasegmental feature known as stød which is a kind of laryngeal phonation that is used phonemically. It also exhibits extensive lenition of plosives, which is noticeably more common than in the neighboring languages. Because of that and <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>other</b> <b>things,</b> spoken Danish is rather hard to understand for Norwegians and Swedes, although they can easily read it.|$|E

60|$|Watch {{comes into}} a story of an old woman {{employed}} at the farm at this period. She {{had been in the}} Warminster workhouse for a short time, and had there heard that a daughter of a former mistress {{in another part of the}} county had long been married and was now the mistress of Doveton Farm, close by. Old Nance thereupon obtained her release and trudged to Doveton, and one very rough, cold day presented herself at the farm to beg for something to do which would enable her to keep herself. If there was nothing for her she must, she said, go back and end her days in the Warminster workhouse. Mrs. Ellerby remembered and pitied her, and going in to her husband begged him earnestly to find some place on the farm for the forlorn old creature. He did not see what could be done for her: they already had one old woman on their hands, who mended sacks and did <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>other</b> trifling <b>things,</b> but for another old woman there would be nothing to do. Then he went in and had a good long look at her, revolving the matter in his mind, anxious to please his wife, and finally, he asked her if she could scare the crows. He could think of nothing else. Of course she could scare crows--it was the very thing for her! Well, he said, she could go and look after the swedes; the rooks had just taken a liking to them, and even if she was not very active perhaps she would be able to keep them off.|$|R
40|$|Investigation of {{the work}} of the Dutch {{mathematician}} Johannes Hudde (1628 - 1704) has always been marred by a lack of sources. Hudde published little (in fact, all his works known in the literature were published by others) and most of his manuscripts got lost after his death. In this article, attention is drawn to some informations which has up till now remained without notice: 1. In 1656, Hudde published anonymously a short treatise on dioptrics, more especially on spherical aberration: Specilla circularia. Printed copies have not been recovered, but the text is preserved by two manuscripts, in London and Hannover, and will be published shortly. 2. Equally in 1656, Hudde appears to have published two anonymous pamphlets in defence of Copernicanism. These pamphlets were part of a wider pamphlet-war on the issue. They were directed in particular against the Leiden minister Jacob du Bois. 3. The Amsterdam municipal archives keep a collection of notes by Hudde on the regulation of the water circulation in the Amsterdam canals. 4. In an appendix, the text of an (earlier noticed) memorandum by David Gregory on a visit to Hudde on 27 May 1693, is transcribed and translated with <b>a</b> <b>few</b> annotations. Among <b>other</b> <b>things</b> it appears that Hudde had undertaken an enumeration of curves of the third degree independently of Newton...|$|R
