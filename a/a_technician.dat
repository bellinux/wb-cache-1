The Philadelphia Fire Department nozzles allowed 100 psi nozzle pressure while One Meridian Plaza's pressure relief valves were giving less than 60 psi discharge pressure, which was not sufficient to fight the fire.

40|$|International audienceObjectives: The {{goals of}} this study were to develop and {{evaluate}} a joint ă theoretical/practical training course for radiology residents and <b>ă</b> <b>technicians</b> and to start a collaborative practice agreement enabling <b>ă</b> radiology <b>technicians</b> to perform PICC placement under the responsibility ă of an interventional radiologist. ă Materials and methods: A joint training session based on literature ă evidences and international recommendations was designed. Participants ă were assessed before and after training, and were also asked to evaluate ă the program one month after completion of the training course. Practical ă post-training mentoring guidelines were laid down for radiologists <b>ă</b> supervising <b>technicians.</b> <b>ă</b> Results: From January to April 2014, 6 radiology residents and 12 <b>ă</b> radiology <b>technicians</b> from the two interventional radiology departments ă of the University hospitals in Marseille took part in the training ă program. For both residents and technicians, significant improvement was ă observed between pretraining and post-training assessment. The majority ă of participants were satisfied with the program. ă Conclusion: Our experience suggests that combined theoretical and ă practical training in PICC placement allows improving technical skill ă and yields high degrees of satisfaction for both radiology residents and <b>ă</b> <b>technicians.</b> <b>A</b> collaborative practice agreement is now formally ă established to enable radiologists to delegate PICC placement procedures <b>ă</b> to radiology <b>technicians.</b> (C) 2016 Editions francaises de radiologie. ă Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.

However, seeing that O'Toole was killed after being mistaken for her, Tiffany changes her mind. She drives Bond to the airport, where the diamonds are given to Whyte's casino manager, Bert Saxby, who is followed to a remote facility. Bond enters the apparent destination of the diamonds: a research laboratory owned by Whyte, where a satellite is being built by Professor Metz, a laser refraction specialist. Bond fakes Metz by telling him he is Klaus Hergersheimer, <b>a</b> <b>technician</b> he met in the facility. His cover is blown when the real Hergersheimer shows up.

5|$|Airline EasyJet is {{interested}} in the inspection of aircraft with drones. It made a first inspection in 2015. Equipped with laser sensors and high resolution camera, the drone performs autonomous flight around the aeroplane. It generates a three-dimensional image of the aircraft and transmits it to <b>a</b> <b>technician.</b> The operator can then navigate in this representation and zoom to display a high-resolution picture of some parts of the aircraft. The operator must then visually diagnose {{the presence or absence of}} defects. This approach avoids the use of platforms to observe the upper parts of the aeroplane.|$|E
5|$|The Dayton Project {{developed}} {{techniques for}} extracting polonium-210 from the lead dioxide ore {{in which it}} occurs naturally, and from bismuth targets that had been bombarded by neutrons in a nuclear reactor. Ultimately, polonium-based neutron initiators were used in both the gun-type Little Boy and the implosion-type Fat Man used in the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki respectively. The fact that polonium {{was used as an}} initiator was classified until the 1960s, but George Koval, <b>a</b> <b>technician</b> with the Manhattan Project's Special Engineer Detachment, penetrated the Dayton Project as a spy for the Soviet Union.|$|E

5|$|Buoyed {{with regular}} {{donations}} from Lynch's childhood friend Jack Fisk and Fisk's wife Sissy Spacek, production continued for several years. Additional funds {{were provided by}} Nance's wife Catherine E.

During one of the many lulls in filming, Lynch was able to produce the short film The Amputee, taking advantage of the AFI's wish to test new film stock before committing to bulk purchases. The short piece starred Coulson, who continued working with Lynch as <b>a</b> <b>technician</b> on Eraserhead. Eraserhead production crew was very small, composed of Lynch; sound designer Alan Splet; cinematographer Herb Cardwell, who died during production and was replaced with Frederick Elmes; production manager and prop technician Doreen Small; and Coulson, who worked in a variety of roles.|$|E

5|$|From 1962-70, {{he worked}} as <b>a</b> <b>technician</b> at the Chester Beatty cancer {{research}} laboratory in Fulham, looking after animals used in experimentation. Most of the technicians were socialists, and Livingstone helped found {{a branch of the}} Association of Scientific, Technical and Managerial Staffs to fight redundancies imposed by company bosses. Livingstone's leftist views solidified upon the election of Labour Prime Minister Harold Wilson in 1964. With a friend from Chester Beatty, Livingstone toured West Africa in 1966, visiting Algeria, Niger, Nigeria, Lagos, Ghana and Togo. Interested in the region's wildlife, Livingstone rescued an infant ostrich from being eaten, donating it to Lagos children's zoo. Returning home, he took part in several protest marches {{as a part of the}} anti-Vietnam War movement, becoming increasingly interested in politics and briefly subscribing to the publication of a libertarian socialist group, Solidarity.|$|E

5|$|In 1983, Nolan Bushnell {{founded a}} new computer-guided {{animation}} studio called Kadabrascope as {{a subsidiary of}} his Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza Time Theatres company, {{which was founded in}} 1977. Only one major project was made out of the new studio, an animated Christmas movie for NBC starring Chuck E. Cheese and other PTT mascots. The animation movement would be made using Tweening instead of traditional cel animation. After the North American Video Game Crash of 1983, Bushnell started selling some subsidiaries of PTT to keep the business afloat. Sente Technologies (another division, was founded to have games distributed in PTT stores) would be sold to Bally Games and Kadabrascope would be sold to LucasFilm. The Kadabrascope assets would be combined with the Computer Division of LucasFilm. Coincidentally, Steve Jobs, a main Apple shareholder and former CEO, worked under Bushnell in 1973 as <b>a</b> <b>technician</b> at his other company Atari, which Bushnell sold to Warner Communications in 1976 to focus on PTT. PTT would later go bankrupt in 1985 and be acquired by ShowBiz Pizza Place.|$|E

5|$|On {{the night}} of 27 February, 'C' Company, 2nd Parachute Battalion, {{under the command of}} Major John Frost, parachuted into France {{a few miles from the}} installation. The force then {{proceeded}} to assault the villa in which the radar equipment was kept, killing several members of the German garrison and capturing the installation after a brief fire-fight. <b>A</b> <b>technician</b> that had come with the force partially dismantled the Würzburg radar array and removed several key pieces to take back to Britain, the raiding force then retreated to the evacuation beach. The detachment assigned to clear the beach had failed to do so, however, and another brief fire-fight was required to eliminate the Germans guarding the beach. The raiding force was then picked up by a small number of landing craft and transferred to several Motor Gun Boats which brought them back to Britain. The raid was entirely successful. The airborne troops suffered only a few casualties, and the pieces of the radar they brought back, along with a German radar technician, allowed British scientists to understand German advances in radar and to create counter-measures to neutralise those advances.|$|E
