40|$|This {{dissertation}} investigates {{second language}} learners' knowledge of reconstruction in English and Chinese. To tap Chinese learners' knowledge of reconstruction in English, experiments included sentences that are underdetermined (not directly available) in Chinese, namely, sentences with a reflexive (himself/herself) inside <b>a</b> <b>moved</b> NP (noun phrase) or predicate {{that contains a}} wh-element. To tap English learners' knowledge of reconstruction in Chinese, an experiment included sentences that are underdetermined in English, namely, sentences with ambiguity of antecedence of ziji 'self' inside <b>a</b> <b>moved</b> predicate and in non-movement sentences. Results of a timed judgment task indicate that in judging the grammaticality of English sentences with singular reflexives (himself/herself) inside <b>a</b> <b>moved</b> NP or predicate, Chinese learners' error rates were below the chance level. Results of a multiple-choice task, a task with a preceding context and a truth-value judgment task involving pictures indicate that Chinese learners distinguished between ambiguity of antecedence of a reflexive inside <b>a</b> <b>moved</b> NP and no ambiguity of antecedence of a reflexive inside <b>a</b> <b>moved</b> predicate. Results of a truth-value judgment task with English learners of Chinese indicate that they had knowledge of ambiguity of antecedence of ziji inside <b>a</b> <b>moved</b> predicate. These results point to second language learners' access to Universal Grammar, although evidence of L 1 effects was found with both Chinese learners of English and English learners of Chinese...|$|R

5|$|During the club's victory parade, {{with only}} one year left on his {{contract}} Chamakh declared {{that he would be}} staying at Bordeaux for the 2009–10 season, despite strong interest from Premier League club Arsenal. Despite the statement, rumors of <b>a</b> <b>move</b> to Arsenal continued to surface with negotiations reportedly having been ongoing throughout the summer. On 3 August 2009, president Jean-Louis Triaud declared that Arsenal had sent a bid of €7million for Chamakh and that he had rejected it, demanding that Arsenal improve its offer. The following day, Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger announced {{that he would not be}} offering a better deal and declared the possible transfer dead. The announcement subsequently led Chamakh to confirm his intent to remain at Bordeaux for the 2009–10 season. On 29 August, Chamakh reportedly snubbed <b>a</b> <b>move</b> to West Ham United. The club offered Bordeaux £18million for the player and offered Chamakh a four-year contract worth £3million a year.
