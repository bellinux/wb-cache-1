5|$|Before any troop {{transportation}} {{could be}} undertaken, {{all of the}} ships had to be hastily refitted. Of the fourteen ships, four, including El Occidente, were designated to carry animals and cargo; the other ten were designated to carry human passengers. The four ships designated to carry animals had to have ramps and stalls built. All the ships had to have gun platforms installed, before each ship docked <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Brooklyn</b> Navy Yard to have the guns themselves installed. All the ships were manned by merchant officers and crews but carried two U.S. Navy officers, Navy gun crews, quartermasters, signalmen, and wireless operators. The senior Navy officer on board would take control if a ship came under attack.|$|E

5|$|A {{prototype}} for the Kinetoscope {{was shown to}} a convention of the National Federation of Women's Clubs on May 20, 1891. The first public demonstration of the Kinetoscope was held <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Brooklyn</b> Institute of Arts and Sciences on May 9, 1893. Instrumental {{to the birth of}} American movie culture, the Kinetoscope also had a major impact in Europe; its influence abroad was magnified by Edison's decision not to seek international patents on the device, facilitating numerous imitations of and improvements on the technology. In 1895, Edison introduced the Kinetophone, which joined the Kinetoscope with a cylinder phonograph. Film projection, which Edison initially disdained as financially nonviable, soon superseded the Kinetoscope's individual exhibition model. Many of the projection systems developed by Edison's firm in later years would use the Kinetoscope name.|$|E

5|$|Before any troop {{transportation}} {{could be}} undertaken, {{all of the}} ships were hastily refitted. Of the fourteen ships, ten, including Henry R. Mallory, were designated to carry human passengers; the other four were designated as animal ships. The ten ships designated to carry troops had all of their second- and third-class accommodations ripped out and replaced with berths for troops. Cooking and toilet facilities were greatly expanded to handle {{the large numbers of}} men aboard. Gun platforms were installed on each ship before docking <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Brooklyn</b> Navy Yard to have the guns themselves installed.

5|$|Emeka Ogboh (born 1977) is a Nigerian {{sound and}} {{installation}} artist {{best known for}} his soundscapes of life in Lagos. Trained as an artist, he began working with sounds that characterize cities following an Egyptian multimedia art program. He presents unmodified field recordings from Lagos city lifefor instance, its danfo share taxi systemin gallery installations with headphones and speakers. His non-audio work uses iconography from Lagos city life. He participated in the DAAD Artists-in-Berlin Program and 2015 Venice Biennale, and received the 2016 Bremen Böttcherstraße Art Award. His work has exhibited <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Brooklyn</b> Museum, American National Museum of African Art, Menil Collection, Casino Luxembourg, and Kiasma. Critics noted his soundscapes' chaos and complexity, and his focus on recontextualizing rather than transforming the city's sounds.|$|E
5|$|In August 2017, NYC Ferry filed {{plans to}} build four ferry docks: one in Soundview, one in Yorkville, one near Stuyvesant Cove, {{and one on the}} Lower East Side. It also sought to add two more piers to its home port <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Brooklyn</b> Navy Yard. The Soundview route was revised so that it would stop at East 34th Street instead of at East 62nd Street, which would no longer be built. That month, Brooklyn {{politicians}} called for docks to be built in Coney Island and Canarsie, owing to the new system's popularity. The Astoria route was projected to carry 1,800 daily passengers upon opening, by which point the service had seen 1.4 million riders. Due to even more ridership demand, three extra ferries were ordered in September 2017, by which time over 2 million people had ridden the ferry.|$|E

5|$|Paoli kept busy {{performing}} in Italy, South America and the United States. He returned to Puerto Rico in 1923. At the time, Amalia Paoli was residing in San Juan (in the ward of Santurce) {{where she was}} running a singing school (Academia Paoli). Antonio conducted a few performances around the island and then departed to sing <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Brooklyn</b> Academy of Music, the Manhattan Opera House and the Metropolitan Opera House in Philadelphia. He had wanted to sing in the Metropolitan Opera House in New York, but apparently his competitor Enrico Caruso opposed this. Some attribute this {{to the fact that}} Caruso was a shareholder of the renowned opera house. From the U.S., the tenor would visit Curaçao, Cuba, Colombia, Haiti and Ecuador.|$|E
5|$|The {{club was}} unable to {{replicate}} its form in the 1947–48 season, occupying 11th place on its conclusion in May 1948. Despite that, Liddell reached double figures {{with a total of}} 11 goals. He accompanied the club when it embarked on its second exhibition tour of North America. His displays against Sweden's Djurgården, played <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Brooklyn</b> Dodgers' Ebbets Field, and North American teams earned him praise from journalists and gained him 13 goals in 11 matches. In the 1948–49 season, Liddell occupied left back and four forward positions. During his career, he would fill all ten outfield roles, mostly because of injuries to other players. His brother, Tom, became a teammate in 1949 after Liverpool signed him from Lochore Welfare. He never represented the club as a senior. The club finished in eighth in the 1949–50 season, going undefeated for a post-First World War record of 19 consecutive matches. Liddell scored ten goals in seven of those matches, including three braces.|$|E
5|$|The single's {{music video}} was filmed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Brooklyn</b> Academy of Music {{during the fall}} of 1998. The video begins with Houston {{entering}} a small arena as she begins to sing the song's first verse. As she finishes her part, Carey appears on the stage as well, performing the second verse and chorus. The video {{is set in a}} dark studio accented by Egyptian settings, backdrops, and scenes inspired by The Prince of Egypt. An audience is on hand to emulate a concert-like-setting, cheering on both singers. Occasionally, home video clips of Carey and Houston appear throughout the video, as well as clips of the final moments of the film, during the splitting of the Red Sea. The video ends as the room is illuminated, and the two singers are joined by a large choir. As they complete the song, Carey and Houston receive a standing ovation from the crowd, and exit the studio together, walking side by side as they disappear in the distance. For the video, Carey and Houston both donned similar low-cut black gowns, while Carey sported a long straight hairstyle, and Houston a pixie cut.|$|E
