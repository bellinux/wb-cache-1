5|$|As {{historian}} Dariusz Stola notes, the anti-Jewish campaign combined century-old conspiracy theories, recycled antisemitic {{claims and}} classic communist propaganda. Regarding the tailoring of the Żydokomuna sentiment to communist Poland, Stola suggested: Paradoxically, {{probably the most}} powerful slogan of the communist propaganda in March was the <b>accusation</b> that the Jews were zealous communists. They were blamed for a major part, if not all, of the crimes and horrors of the Stalinist period. The myth of Judeo-Bolshevism had been well known in Poland since the Russian revolution and the Polish-Bolshevik war of 1920, yet its 1968 model deserves interest {{as a tool of}} communist propaganda. This <b>accusation</b> exploited and developed the popular stereotype of Jewish communism to purify communism: the Jews were the dark side of communism; what was wrong in communism was due to them.|$|E
5|$|Cagney {{was accused}} of being a {{communist}} sympathizer in 1934, and again in 1940. The <b>accusation</b> in 1934 stemmed from a letter police found from a local Communist official that alleged that Cagney would bring other Hollywood stars to meetings. Cagney denied this, and Lincoln Steffens, husband of the letter's writer, backed up this denial, asserting that the <b>accusation</b> stemmed solely from Cagney's donation to striking cotton workers in the San Joaquin Valley. William Cagney claimed this donation was the root of the charges in 1940. Cagney was cleared by U.S. Representative Martin Dies Jr., on the House Un-American Activities Committee.|$|E

5|$|Conybeare's {{presentation}} {{followed the}} resolution of a controversy over the legitimacy {{of one of the}} fossils. The fact that the plesiosaur's long neck had an unprecedented 35 vertebrae raised the suspicions of the eminent French anatomist Georges Cuvier when he reviewed Anning's drawings of the second skeleton, and he wrote to Conybeare suggesting the possibility that the find was a fake produced by combining fossil bones from different kinds of animals. Fraud was far from unknown among early 19th-century fossil collectors, and if the controversy had not been resolved promptly, the <b>accusation</b> could have seriously damaged Anning's ability to sell fossils to other geologists. Cuvier's <b>accusation</b> had resulted in a special meeting of the Geological Society earlier in 1824, which, after some debate, had concluded the skeleton was legitimate. Cuvier later admitted he had acted in haste and was mistaken.|$|E
5|$|In 708, some monks at Hexham accused Bede {{of having}} {{committed}} heresy {{in his work}} De Temporibus. The standard theological view of world history {{at the time was}} known as the Six Ages of the World; in his book, Bede calculated the age of the world for himself, rather than accepting the authority of Isidore of Seville, and {{came to the conclusion that}} Christ had been born 3,952 years after the creation of the world, rather than the figure of over 5,000 years that was commonly accepted by theologians. The <b>accusation</b> occurred in front of the bishop of Hexham, Wilfrid, who was present at a feast when some drunken monks made the <b>accusation.</b> Wilfrid did not respond to the <b>accusation,</b> but a monk present relayed the episode to Bede, who replied within a few days to the monk, writing a letter setting forth his defence and asking that the letter also be read to Wilfrid. Bede had another brush with Wilfrid, for the historian himself says that he met Wilfrid, sometime between 706 and 709, and discussed Æthelthryth, the abbess of Ely. Wilfrid had been present at the exhumation of her body in 695, and Bede questioned the bishop about the exact circumstances of the body and asked for more details of her life, as Wilfrid had been her advisor.|$|E

40|$|<b>Accusations</b> {{are a very}} {{frequent}} type {{of speech}} act both in everyday life and in formal controversies, and answering <b>accusations</b> is a sophisticated type of linguistic practice well worth analysing from a pragmatic point of view. In my paper I shall first describe some basic properties of <b>accusations</b> and characteristic types of reactions to <b>accusations,</b> i. e. denying the alleged fact, making excuses, and giving justifications. I {{then go on to}} describe some fundamental functions of <b>accusations</b> in controversies. Using the basic patterns of <b>accusations</b> and reactions to <b>accusations</b> as an object of comparison, I then analyse some relevant exchanges from historical controversies (l 6 th to 18 th century), among them famous polemical interactions like the Hobbes-Bramhall controversy, but also less well-known debates from the fields of medicine and theology. The present paper is both a contribution to the theory of controversy and to the pragmatic history of controversies.

5|$|The first <b>accusation</b> against Sherwood came {{to court}} in early 1697. Richard Capps alleged {{that she had}} used a spell to cause {{the death of his}} bull. The court made no decision, and the Sherwoods filed a {{defamation}} suit against Capps that was resolved by a settlement. In 1698, Sherwood was accused by her neighbor John Gisburne of enchanting his pigs and cotton crop. No court action followed this <b>accusation,</b> and another suit for defamation by the Sherwoods failed. In the same year Elizabeth Barnes alleged that Sherwood had assumed the form of a black cat, entered Barnes' home, jumped over her bed, drove and whipped her, and left via the keyhole. Again the allegation was unresolved, and again the subsequent defamation action was lost. For each of the failed actions, Sherwood and her husband had to pay court-related costs.|$|E

5|$|A later fictional {{treatment}} of the historical episode, appeared as the first story of Edward Maturin's Sejanus, and Other Roman Tales (New York 1839). It also figures in Robert Graves' I, Claudius (1934). The novel was given new life when it was adapted for television as I, Claudius in 1976; in this Antonia sends the letter of <b>accusation</b> to Tiberius via Claudius, after discovering her daughter is plotting with Sejanus (Patrick Stewart). The Caesars (1968) was an earlier television series which featured Sejanus.|$|E
5|$|After {{the split}} with the Bahá'ís, some Azalis were {{very active in}} secular reform {{movements}} and the Iranian Constitutional Revolution (19051907), including Shaykh Ahmad Ruhi Kermani and Mirza Abd-al-Hosayn Kermani. However, the community was still suppressed as a heresy and the <b>accusation</b> of being an Azali was often enough for most to {{believe it to be}} true. Coupled with the Azali practice of taqiyya (dissimulation) determining whether or not a particular figure in Persian politics was an Azali is difficult.|$|E
5|$|Bramatnyo {{was accused}} of working for Muhammadiyah when {{creating}} the film, an <b>accusation</b> which he denied.

50|$|Tong is {{the author}} of three books and {{numerous}} publications on the topic of false abuse allegations. In 1992, Tong published his first book, Don't Blame ME, Daddy: False <b>Accusations</b> of Child Sexual Abuse. It was written after his legal battles to prove his innocence of <b>accusations</b> against him. The book detailed the increase of false <b>accusations</b> of child sexual abuse in relation to divorce and child custody cases. He followed up with the book Ashes to Ashes, Families to Dust in 1996. The book provided information for those falsely accused of abuse. In 2002, Tong published his third book, Elusive Innocence: Survival Guide for the Falsely Accused. The book, which targeted attorneys, detailed the difference between actual abuse and false <b>accusations</b> of abuse as well as domestic violence allegations. It included chapters on fighting false <b>accusations</b> and a summary of case studies involving false <b>accusations.</b> Tong also penned the Foreword to the 2009 book I'm Going to be a Dad, Now What? written by Craig Baird.|$|R

5|$|Following Reinboldt's death, {{around the}} time that the Mark Foley scandal broke in 2006, Burdge unsuccessfully {{attempted}} to bring the charges against Hastert to light; she contacted ABC News and the Associated Press on an off-the-record basis, and also contacted some advocacy groups. ABC News and the AP could not corroborate Jolene's allegation at the time, and Hastert denied the <b>accusation</b> to ABC News at the time, so the claim was not published.|$|E
