5|$|Calhoun's basic {{concern for}} {{protecting}} the diversity of minority interests is expressed in his chief contribution to political science—the idea of a concurrent majority across different groups as distinguished from a numerical majority. A concurrent majority is <b>a</b> <b>system</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> a minority group is permitted to exercise a sort of veto power over actions of a majority that are believed to infringe upon the minority's rights.|$|E
5|$|Depending on modality, {{language}} structure can {{be based}} on systems of sounds (speech), gestures (sign languages), or graphic or tactile symbols (writing). The ways in which languages use sounds or signs to construct meaning are studied in phonology. The study of how humans produce and perceive vocal sounds is called phonetics. In spoken language, meaning is produced when sounds become part of <b>a</b> <b>system</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> some sounds can contribute to expressing meaning and others do not. In any given language, {{only a limited number}} of the many distinct sounds that can be created by the human vocal apparatus contribute to constructing meaning.|$|E
5|$|English astrology {{had reached}} its zenith by the 17th century. Astrologers were theorists, researchers, and social engineers, {{as well as}} {{providing}} individual advice to everyone from monarchs downwards. Among other things, astrologers could advise on the best time to take a journey or harvest a crop, diagnose and prescribe for physical or mental illnesses, and predict natural disasters. This underpinned <b>a</b> <b>system</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> everything—people, the world, the universe—was understood to be interconnected, and astrology co-existed happily with religion, magic and science.|$|E
25|$|Common law courts usually use <b>an</b> {{adversarial}} <b>system,</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> {{two sides}} present their cases to a neutral judge. In contrast, civil law <b>systems</b> usually use <b>an</b> inquisitorial <b>system</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>an</b> examining magistrate serves two roles by developing {{the evidence and}} arguments for one side {{and then the other}} during the investigation phase.|$|R

5|$|Initially, Bain Capital {{focused on}} venture capital investments. Romney set up <b>a</b> <b>system</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> any partner could veto {{one of these}} {{potential}} opportunities, and he personally saw so many weaknesses that few venture capital investments were approved in the initial two years. The firm's first significant success was a 1986 investment to help start Staples Inc., after founder Thomas G. Stemberg convinced Romney of the market size for office supplies and Romney convinced others; Bain Capital eventually reaped a nearly sevenfold return on its investment, and Romney sat on the Staples board of directors for over a decade.|$|E
5|$|It {{replaced}} <b>a</b> <b>system</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> voter enumeration {{was conducted}} for each election once a writ of election was issued in the respective jurisdiction. Bill C-63 also reduced the minimum length of election campaigns from 47 days to 36 days, {{as the time}} required for voter enumeration was significantly reduced. Five provinces adopted similar provincial registers in the 1990s, joining British Columbia, which had relied on a permanent register for a long time.|$|E
5|$|Justice Hayne {{concluded}} that the detention scheme in the Migration Act did not contravene Chapter III because, fundamentally, it was not punitive. The Act did not make being in Australia without a visa an offence (although {{it had been in}} the past), and in reality he considered the mandatory detention scheme to be not that different from <b>a</b> <b>system</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> all people were prevented from entering Australia without permission at all.|$|E

5|$|Many traditions have {{stressed}} the grief of mothers over deprivation {{of their children}} but little has been said historically about young children's loss of their mothers; {{this may have been}} because loss of the mother in infancy frequently meant death for a breast-fed infant. In the 19th century, French society bureaucratised <b>a</b> <b>system</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> infants were breast-fed at the homes of foster mothers, returning to the biological family after weaning, and no concern was evinced at the possible effect of this double separation on the child.|$|E
5|$|In July 1969, the {{prominent}} Luo politician Mboya was assassinated by a Kikuyu, with suspicions being voiced that Kenyatta's government had been responsible. The killing sparked riots in Nairobi, and ethnic tensions were stoked across Kenya. In October 1969, Kenyatta visited Kisumu, located in Luo territory, {{in order to}} open a hospital financed with Soviet aid. He was greeted by a crowd shouting KPU slogans and he lost his temper. When members of the crowd started throwing stones, Kenyatta's bodyguards opened fire on them, killing and wounding several. In response {{to the rise of}} KPU, Kenyatta had introduced oathing, <b>a</b> <b>system</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> individuals came to Gatundu to swear their loyalty to him. Journalists were discouraged from reporting on the oathing system, and several were deported when they tried to do so. Many were pressured or forced to conduct the oaths, generating a condemnation from the country's Christian establishment. In response to the growing condemnation, the oathing was terminated in September 1969, and Kenyatta invited leaders from other ethnic groups to a meeting in Gatundi.|$|E
5|$|The Cubs {{began playing}} under the College of Coaches in 1961, <b>a</b> <b>system</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> {{decisions}} were made {{by a group of}} 12 coaches rather than by one manager. By the 1962 season, Banks hoped to return to shortstop but the College of Coaches had determined that he would remain at first base indefinitely. In May 1962, Banks was hit in the head by a fastball from former Cubs pitcher Moe Drabowsky and was taken off the field unconscious. He sustained a concussion, spent two nights in a hospital, sat out a Monday game, and hit three home runs and a double on Tuesday.|$|E

5|$|The academy {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{expensive}} in Europe, operating at a cost of £5million a year. The main cost is the dormitory, La Masia itself. The minimum age for the youth program is six years; each year, more than 1,000boys from the ages of six to eight try out for admittance. The best 200 are selected. The club also actively seeks for prospective students; it employs <b>a</b> <b>system</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> 15scouts are deployed in Catalonia, 15 in the rest of Spain and 10 scattered throughout the world. To alleviate the expenses of this scouting, the club has an agreement with 15 local clubs for them to train players who are not ready for entry into the youth academy. In return, FC Barcelona gives money, coaching and technical advice to these clubs for their services. While expanding its operations abroad, the club established five schools in Mexico and one in Egypt; successful applicants to these schools become full-time students, receiving academic education and football training.|$|E

25|$|Lewis (1991) went further, showing informally that mereology, {{augmented}} {{by a few}} ontological assumptions and plural quantification, and some novel reasoning about singletons, yields <b>a</b> <b>system</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> a given individual can be both a member and a subset of another individual.

40|$|The Kac {{model is}} a {{simplified}} model of <b>an</b> $N$-particle <b>system</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> the collisions of <b>a</b> real particle <b>system</b> are modeled by random jumps of pairs of particle velocities. Kac proved propagation of chaos for this model, and hence provided a rigorous validation of the corresponding Boltzmann equation. Starting with the same model we consider <b>an</b> $N$-particle <b>system</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> the particles are accelerated between the jumps by a constant uniform force field which conserves the total energy of the system.
