Where {{there are multiple}} detectors, the gas is passed through them in series, then led to waste. The gas is usually 90% argon, 10% methane ("P10"), although the argon may be replaced with neon or helium where very long wavelengths (over 5nm) are to be detected. The argon is ionised by incoming X-ray photons, and the electric field multiplies this charge into a measurable pulse. The methane suppresses the formation of fluorescent photons caused by recombination of the argon ions with stray electrons. The anode wire is typically tungsten or nichrome of 20–60 μm diameter. Since the pulse strength obtained is essentially proportional to {{the ratio of the}} detector chamber diameter to the wire diameter, a fine wire is needed, but it must also be strong enough to be maintained under tension so that it remains precisely straight and concentric with the detector. The window needs to be conductive, thin enough to transmit the X-rays effectively, but thick and strong enough to minimize diffusion of the detector gas into the high vacuum of the monochromator chamber. Materials often used are beryllium metal, <b>aluminised</b> PET film and <b>aluminised</b> polypropylene. Ultra-thin windows (down to 1 μm) for use with low-penetration long wavelengths are very expensive.

Alumina seems to be a promising coating material. However, an appropriate coating system must also have the potential for self healing since the ceramic alumina scale tends to fail if mechanical stress is applied. Hot-dip <b>aluminising</b> is an applicable technology to coat ferritic-martensitic steels which consists of two main process steps: firstly, hot dip <b>aluminising</b> of the steel (700 C, 30 s) Secondly, transformation of the very hard intermetallic scale Fe_ 2 Al_ 5 into FeAl and #alpha#-Fe(Al) phase during a subsequent heat treatment (1040 C, 30 min). The pressure chosen for the HIP experiment was 1000, 2000 and 3000 bar. Compared to a heat treatment without superimposed high pressure pores formation due to the Kirkendall effect could be suppressed successfully.

The experimental investigation showed that their efficiency was depending on both materials parameters and flow conditions, the latter affecting the pressure drop and the heat transfer behaviour. The microstructural characterisation of oxide surface morphologies formed on the open-cell Ni foams exposed to concentrated solar radiation is investigated by the use of SEM and EDXS.

40|$|Research to {{investigate}} advanced diffusion coatings for improved oxidation and hot corrosion resistance was conducted. The {{aim was to}} build on the performance of the standard aluminide on the nickel-base super alloy IN 738 LC. The main emphasis of this investigation was {{to examine the effects of}} adding small quantities of yttrium to the coating as well as to produce a platinum-modified aluminide diffusion coating which is accepted as the best industrial standard for diffusion aluminides at present. A pack diffusion process was used to produce the coatings in this current study. A standard aluminide coating was modified with a small YCI 3 (0. 5 Wt. %) addition to the pack, producing an aluminising-yttrising pack. In the platinum-modified altuninide coating process, a sample was coated with several microns of platinum using a sputtering technique prior to the <b>aluminising</b> process. The pack used in this platinum modified aluminide process was a standard <b>aluminising</b> pack. The performance of these modified coatings during oxidation and high temperature corrosion was evaluated. Promising results were obtained, which demonstrated that both platinum and yttrium modified aluminide coatings had beneficial effects on the oxidation performance of the coatings compared to the standard aluminide coating. However, they were found to work in different ways, to improve resistance to oxidation and hot corrosion resistance. The platinum modified aluminide extends the later stage of the coating life by reduces the amount of spall, whist yttrium modified aluminide reducing the amount of spall in the early stage of the coating life and increases the critical oxide thickness before the onset of spallation. From these results, the production of a combined platinum-yttrium modified aluminide coating would be expected to show improved oxidation and hot corrosion resistance throughout the life of the coating.

40|$|Worldwide, {{carbon dioxide}} {{emission}} reductions are in progress following the Kyoto Protocol implementation programme to mitigate climate change. More stringent reductions {{are expected to}} follow the present programme which ends in 2012. In addition to reducing carbon dioxide emissions, the major climate change mitigation policy is the elimination of waste. This project addresses both aspects, by facilitating the use of biomass and waste fuels in the gas turbines of highly efficient, integrated gasification combined cycle electricity generating units. Gases from the gasification of these fuels contain potentially damaging contaminants which, when combusted in gas turbines, will initiate hot corrosion. To resist hot corrosion, but still maximise gas turbine efficiency, the hot components of gas turbines require protective coatings. Five activities in this project required original research to meet the objectives. Firstly, to identify potentially damaging species in gasifier gases, which could remain after hot gas cleaning and, following combustion, initiate hot corrosion along the gas path of the gas turbine. Thermodynamic assessments, using MTDATA software, identified cadmium and lead species that could initiate hot corrosion in the gas turbine. The second research activity, involved Type II hot corrosion tests of the identified species on superalloys and typical commercial coatings. These tests simulated the same corrosion environment as in industrial high temperature gas turbine operation. Test results confirmed the thermodynamic assessments, with hot corrosion being initiated on all items tested, and was worse with lead and/or cadmium additions. The third research activity was to develop novel hot corrosion protective coatings. The approach was to develop the most economic coatings, which would provide comparable, or superior, hot corrosion performance to that provided by well proven commercial coatings already used with fossil fuel firing. From previous research at Cranfield, published literature, and after <b>aluminising</b> and silicon modified <b>aluminising</b> CVD trials, single-step silicon modified <b>aluminising</b> was adopted {{as the basis for}} novel coating development. The fourth research activity consisted of cyclic oxidation tests and, type II and type I hot corrosion tests, to assess the oxidation and hot corrosion protection provided by the novel coatings on IN 738 LC and CMSX- 4 substrates. Cyclic oxidation tests at 950 C and 1050 C showed the novel coatings produced by CVD, at a soak temperature of 1050 C and soak period of one hour, were superior for both substrates. Microstructurally, TCP phases were formed in CMSX- 4 samples which could reduce mechanical strength in service. The TCP phases were observed in the high silicon containing coatings through a reaction with refractory metals diffusing outward from the CMSX- 4. This was most noticeable in samples cyclically oxidised at 1050 C for long times. Results of hot corrosion tests undertaken at 700 C (type II) and 900 C (type I) showed novel coatings on IN 738 LC samples to be more resistant than commercial coatings. Those on CMSX- 4 samples had similar hot corrosion resistance to commercial coatings. The novel coatings provided high levels of hot corrosion resistance, which could be enhanced by improvements in deposition. The fifth research activity was to carry out EB-PVD TBC trials on an IN 738 LC turbine blade, which demonstrated that the novel coating provided an effective bond for the TBC. It is concluded that the novel, single-step silicon-aluminide coatings developed in this project, with identified improvements in quality, will provide effective hot corrosion resistance for gas turbines burning gasified biomass and waste fuels.
