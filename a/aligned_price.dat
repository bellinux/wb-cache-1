Hermann Diller and Imaan Bukhari perform a structural analysis of the pricing conditions in four industries in six EC countries and discuss the implications for pan-European pricing. The analysis reveals that existing structural differences between countries are too large to be ignored. However, the internationalization of the retail industry across Europe is putting increasing pressure on consumer goods firms to <b>align</b> their <b>prices.</b> Finally, the authors present two strategic approaches {{to deal with this}} dilemma. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the performance of}} Dutch drinking water utilities {{before and after the}} introduction of sunshine regulation, which involves publication of the performance of utilities but no formal price regulation. By decomposing profit change into its economic drivers, our results suggest that, in the Dutch political and institutional context, sunshine regulation was effective in improving the productivity of publicly organised services. Nevertheless, while sunshine regulation did bring about a moderate reduction in water prices, sustained and substantial economic profits suggest that it may not have the potential to fully <b>align</b> output <b>prices</b> with economic costs in the long run. In methodological terms, the DEA based profit decomposition is extended to robust and conditional non-parametric efficiency measures, so as to account better for both uncertainty and differences in operating environment between utilities. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{examine the}} effect of {{monetary}} policy and of exchange rate on stock price movements in Asia. We employ a Bayesian structural vector autoregression model and impose sign restrictions to simultaneously and uniquely identify contractionary monetary policy shocks and depreciation shocks in an integrated framework. This study covers Thailand, Malaysia and South Korea stock markets, over the period 1989 - 2008. Our main results acquired using sign restrictions show that monetary policy shocks result in a strongly persistent effect on market index real stock prices whereas the impact of exchange rate shocks is short-lived over the short-run. The variance de-composition suggests that exchange rate is as important as monetary policy for explaining the dynamics of market and financial sector index real stock prices. More precisely, for all countries examined, real exchange rate developments have been more important in the short-run. Based purely on our findings, two conclusions are made. Firstly, because of the mistimed and/or persis-tent effect of monetary policy on both real economy and financial markets, we argue that one needs to be cautious in using monetary policy to constrain asset price misalignment. Secondly, due to the evidence that exchange rates principally have a contemporaneous impact on equity prices, we suggest that, in the short-run, such incorrectly <b>aligned</b> asset <b>price</b> might be potentially corrected by focusing on exchange rate movements...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{argues that}} revenue sharing is a {{valuable}} instrument in vertically separated industries when there is intrabrand competition among the downstream firms, demand is stochastic or variable, and downstream inventory is chosen before demand is realized. In these environments, the upstream firm would like to simultaneously soften downstream competition and encourage efficient inventory holding. Traditional two-part tariffs cannot achieve both objectives {{in the presence of}} downstream competition. Raising the price of the inputs softens price competition but distorts the downstream firms' inventory decisions. We argue that revenue sharing, combined with a low input <b>price,</b> <b>aligns</b> the incentives in the vertical chain. The use of revenue sharing in video rental retailing is discussed. Blockbuster in particular has used revenue sharing in conjunction with heavy marketing of availability to grow significantly in the video rental retail industry. Many other outlets use revenue sharing as well. Some antitrust concerns have been raised by smaller firms suggesting that revenue sharing might be an anticompetitive vertical restraint. Although our model does not address retailer market power, we show that revenue sharing contracts can be used by upstream firms increase inventory holding and consumer welfare. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study is to examine the effects of the {{exchange}} rates, international prices, and the demand shocks on inflation in Fiji. How the domestic inflation in a pegged exchange rate system is <b>aligned</b> with international <b>price</b> shocks is an important monetarist idea, and this is tested in this study. This study employs annual data from 1975 to 2010. The multivariate cointegration tests are done after the unit root tests, and further, the Vector Error Correction (VEC) model shows that the changes in Fiji’s CPI are Granger caused by the long-term trends in all other variables, and the CPI in Australia, and devaluation-year dummies are used as exogenous variables in the VEC model, and the changes in exchange rate and changes in demand shocks are the independent variables but made endogenous in the VEC model. The impulse response function also shows that due to the exchange rate depreciation, inflation has increased for many years in Fiji. The policy implication of our study is that as a monetary policy instrument, the flexibility of the exchange rate policy is indispensable for Fiji to appropriately absorb the international supply and price shocks...|$|R
40|$|The Italian gas {{market is}} the third largest in Europe with strong demand growth {{especially}} in the power generation sector up to the mid 2000 s. But projections of demand growth from that era have not been realised. Clearly {{the impact of the}} financial crisis and subsequent recession has had a significant impact, exacerbated by the growth in wind and solar generation capacity. Market liberalisation in the 2000 s failed to achieve levels of competition in the mid and downstream sectors to the extent seen in North West European markets. This resulted not only in some of the highest European end-user gas prices, but also delayed development of a liquid trading hub. Only in late 2012 did prices at the Italian gas hub PSV <b>align</b> with the <b>prices</b> at the Dutch gas hub TTF and other North West European hubs after capacity availability issues in linking infrastructure were resolved.

40|$|Includes bibliographical referencesExchange Traded Products (ETPs) {{have become}} {{important}} {{members of the}} investment universe. They are praised by institutional and retail investors alike for their low cost, transparency and efficient pricing mechanisms. ETPs trade much like equity securities but with a unique creation and redemption mechanism which typically <b>aligns</b> quoted <b>prices</b> with the Net Asset Value (NAV) of the underlying securities. This dissertation examines a class of ETPs whose underlying reference basket consists of securities listed on stock exchanges operating in a time zone different to the time zone of the ETP instrument itself, and whose currencies of the underlying securities are different to the currency of the ETP instrument. The ETP instruments reviewed comprise of the iShares MSCI Country Series and are all listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). The ETPs are classified into three groups depending {{on the degree of}} overlap between the exchange operating times on which their underlying securities are traded and the exchange operating times of the NYSE. These groups are non-synchronous for no overlapping hours, partially synchronous for some overlapping hours and synchronous for overlapping hours. By assessing a measure of range-based volatility during 15 -minute intra-day intervals throughout the NYSE trading day, an understanding of the volatility profile of these ETPs is determined and analysed. It is found that non-synchronous ETPs do exhibit a higher relative level of volatility when compared to the partially synchronous group. Within the partially synchronous group, evidence of a regime-shift is observed during the period when the market of the underlying securities transitions from open to closed during the NYSE trading session. Another factor observed in the relative volatility profile is the impact of foreign exchange translation. ETPs with underlying securities priced in an emerging market currency show higher relative levels of range-based volatility. However, both emerging market and developed market denominated securities baskets exhibit relatively higher levels of volatility during the opening and closing periods of the US trading day. The results point to the need for caution and understanding of the underlying reference basket when transacting in these ETPs as investors may inadvertently transact at a price which does not reflect the fair-market value of the underlying securities basket due to price distortions as a result of volatility...|$|R
40|$|The Reserve Bank of Australia reduced {{interchange}} fees by almost half thereby eliminating a {{significant source of}} revenue to issuers of credit cards. The purpose of this intervention was to <b>align</b> the <b>prices</b> of using various payment instruments with their social costs and thus reduce the use of cards, which the RBA viewed as a socially less efficient payment method than cash, checks, and PIN debit cards. The short-run result of this regulatory intervention has been the following: (1) Bank issuers have increased the fixed prices for cards and thereby recovered between 30 and 40 percent of the loss of interchange fee revenue; this fraction is likely to increase over time as cards renew and new solicitations go out. Bank issuers have not changed the per-transaction fees for cards much. (2) Merchants experienced a very small reduction in their costs. Both theory and limited empirical evidence suggest that the highly concentrated merchant sector in Australia has captured the reduction in {{interchange fees}} as profits and has not passed it on in the form of lower consumer prices. (3) The per-transaction price at the point of sale has not changed significantly. Merchants have not generally availed themselves of their right to surcharge card transactions and the per-transaction price faced by consumers from their card issuers has not changed much. Holding the number of cards fixed, the regulatory intervention has not altered prices in a way that could achieve the intent of the intervention. (4) There is relatively little evidence thus far that the intervention has in fact affected the volume of card transactions in Australia as intended by the regulation. (5) In the short-run, the effect of the regulation has been to transfer significant profits to the Australian merchant sector with that transfer being borne partly by bank issuers and partly by cardholders. (6) Since proprietary systems such as American Express were not subject to the pricing regulations and since American Express can enter into deals with banks to issue cards, banks have shifted volume from the regulated association systems to the unregulated proprietary systems. ...|$|R
40|$|Low {{transport}} costs help sales and procurement markets to expand. Enlarging those markets allows exploiting economies of scale, an advantage that {{also applies to}} small businesses which focus on the large-scale production of single components and special products. In the past, vertical division of labour encouraged the development of supply networks, which in recent decades benefited road transport of goods. Lower {{transport costs}} promote not just vertical division of labour but also the development of spatial agglomerations. The transport costs burdening an economy depend essentially on its geographical location and transport situation. Locations at sea ports enjoy a cost-effective edge {{when it comes to}} direct overseas links. Ocean-going ships, inland waterway operators, railways and lorry transport have relative shipping rates vis-à-vis each other of 1 : 10 : 17. 5 : 25. Transporting a container across 9, 000 km from Rotterdam to New York costs 25 percent less than transporting it across 1, 200 km from Rotterdam to Vienna using the Rhine-Main-Danube waterway. Liberalisation of international goods transport in the course of creating the EU single market accelerated competition within the transport industry. This in turn promoted progress and ensured rapid implementation and utilisation of rationalisation potentials. Over the past 15 years, shipping rates declined compared to goods prices. The decline was particularly sharp in air freight rates. The Schengen Agreement facilitated cross-border goods transport by road within the EU. By doing away with the many hours of waiting at borders, it generated a productivity leap for road transporters. The railways lost their price lead in overland transport already back in the 1970 s and have been forced to <b>align</b> their <b>prices</b> to road transport rates. Since the late 1980 s, transport policies have been increasingly reflecting environmental concerns. Infrastructure expansions are made with a view to improving the rail system so as to strengthen the more "environmentally friendly" rail transport against road transport. In Austria, investment into federal roads has been showing a trend towards decline since 1983, even though road traffic as such continues to grow. Since 1988, more investment has been directed towards the rail than the road. If these trends in road building and traffic flows continue, bottlenecks in road transport will necessarily build up, which in turn would mean substantial cost increases for goods transport by road. By its transport policy, the European Union wants to internalise the external costs of traffic. Such a course would make goods transport by road significantly more expensive. Exporters in land-locked countries would find their competitiveness increasingly dependent on the supply of rail transport. If the quality and productivity of rail transport cannot be improved accordingly, inland production facilities would lose ground in competing against plants in the proximity of sea ports.

30|$|Finally, the {{interpretation}} of the results might suggest concrete indications for the design of the industrial policy of the Prosecco producer. It is important to highlight that the variables related to product differentiation (spanning from brand, to organoleptic, to bottle format) present estimated coefficients that are not statistically significant. Prosecco CDO is fresh, cheap and with a low alcohol content. These characteristics render the young DINKs the ideal consumers for this product. The main suggestion, therefore, is to use a simple pricing strategy. In fact we can corroborate this industrial policy suggestion by looking at the price trends of Prosecco with respect to other sparkling wines that could be considered substitutes for this product. As shown in section 3, the Prosecco price has increased over the studied period in order to <b>align</b> with the <b>prices</b> of the main substitutes. The competitive advantage of Prosecco relies {{in the fact that the}} Charmat method is relative cheaper with respect to the Champenoise, with which the other main Italian sparkling dry wines are produced. This represents an important insight for industrial policy since producers have to be very careful in their pricing strategy in order to avoid generating (marginal) losses of market shares. In particular, we can compute marginal effects and predict that a 1 % increase in the Prosecco CDO price will decrease the probability that a consumer buys the product by 0.36 %. In addition, a 1 % increase in the Prosecco CGDO price will decrease the probability that a consumer buys the product by 0.26 %. The different sensitivity to price changes is corroborated by the fact that Prosecco CGDO consumers express a preference for the product characteristics (brand and taste) and might be more loyal to the product than Prosecco CDO purchasers. The choice of the trade channel also impacts the pricing strategy. The LSRT can sell large stock of products at relatively low prices. This means that, especially for the smallest Prosecco wineries, it could be more convenient to look at other sales channels (e.g. HoReCa). This strategy seems to be already partially implemented by the firms, and is assessed in our data sample since only five brands (out of a total of 95) have sold almost 50 % of the Proseccos.|$|R
