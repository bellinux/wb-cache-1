40|$|AbstractDifferential cross {{sections}} {{as a function}} of transverse momentum pT are presented for the production of ϒ(nS) (n = 1, 2, 3) states decaying into a pair of muons. Data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 4. 9 fb− 1 in pp collisions at s= 7 TeV were collected with the CMS detector at the LHC. The analysis selects events with dimuon rapidity |y|< 1. 2 and dimuon transverse momentum in the range 10 <pT< 100 GeV. The measurements show a transition from an exponential to a power-law behavior at pT≈ 20 GeV for the three ϒ states.
