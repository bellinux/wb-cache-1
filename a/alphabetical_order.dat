5|$|In the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, both Spanish and Catalan were {{official}} {{languages of}} the games, {{but due to}} the political sensitivity surrounding the use of Catalan, the nations entered in French <b>alphabetical</b> <b>order.</b> For unknown reasons, all three games taking place in Japan had the nations enter in English <b>alphabetical</b> <b>order</b> instead of Japanese characters. In the 2008 Summer Olympics, teams were ordered {{by the number of}} strokes in the Chinese translation of the team name. In the 2010 Winter Olympics, teams entered in English <b>alphabetical</b> <b>order,</b> although the languages of the Olympics are also the languages of the host country, Canada, because English is the more dominant of the two in Vancouver and in the host province of British Columbia. In the 1980 Summer Olympics and the 2014 Winter Olympics, the countries entered in the Cyrillic <b>alphabetical</b> <b>order,</b> which is the Russian language's official script.|$|E

Introducing structure and order to the layout may ease the visual searching process. By means of a Metropolis algorithm with an added alphabetical bias term to the Fitts-digraph energy function previously used (Zhai, Hunter, & Smith, 2000), we designed a keyboard layout with <b>alphabetical</b> <b>ordering</b> tendency with little movement efficiency cost. In contrast to previous efforts that failed to find any <b>alphabetical</b> <b>ordering</b> advantage, our experiment demonstrated that the <b>alphabetical</b> <b>ordering</b> created by our design method indeed improves novice users’performance and was preferred by most participants...|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} trend {{and the author}} name-ordering rule in finance {{publication}} using the publication records of 21 core finance journals {{during the period from}} 1990 to 2004. We empirically model the underlying factors that affect the <b>alphabetical</b> <b>ordering</b> rule among multi-authored finance articles. We find that the choice of <b>alphabetical</b> <b>ordering</b> is based {{on the quality of the}} article, institutional heterogeneity, team size and cultural factors. The central argument rests upon the need to signal and the importance of signalling within the context of bargaining behaviour among coauthors. The probability of choosing <b>alphabetical</b> name <b>ordering</b> rule is associated with high article quality, higher ranked institutions, smaller research team and the presence of European authors. ...|$|R

5|$|If {{there are}} {{multiple}} different cations and/or anions, multiplicative prefixes (di-, tri-, tetra-,...) are often required to indicate the relative compositions, and cations then anions are listed in <b>alphabetical</b> <b>order.</b> For example, KMgCl3 is named magnesium potassium trichloride to distinguish it from K2MgCl4, magnesium dipotassium tetrachlorideMgCl4 and Cs2MgCl4|journal=Canadian Journal of Chemistry|date=January 1975|volume=53|issue=1|pages=114–118|doi=10.1139/v75-015}} (note that in both the empirical formula and the written name, the cations appear in <b>alphabetical</b> <b>order,</b> but the order varies between them because the symbol for potassium is K). When one of the ions already has a multiplicative prefix within its name, the alternate multiplicative prefixes (bis-, tris-, tetrakis-,...) are used. For example, Ba(BrF4)2 is named barium bis(tetrafluoridobromate).|$|E

5|$|During 1939 and 1940, {{a fourth}} batch of ten {{locomotives}} (Nos. 6235–6244) {{was built in}} streamlined form commencing with No. 6235 City of Birmingham.

These locomotives cost an average of £10,659 for the first five and £10,838 each for the second five. The names of the cities in this batch were in strict <b>alphabetical</b> <b>order.</b> This came to an end when No. 6244 City of Leeds was patriotically renamed King George VI in 1941.|$|E

Reverend Krishna Mohan Banerjee's (1813–1885) adaptation of Encyclopædia Britannica, Vidyakalpadruma or Encyclopædia Bengalensis (1846–51), and the 22-volume Bangla Visvakosh (1886–1911), edited by Nagendranath Basu (1866–1938) with contributions from many major personalities of contemporary Bengal, were published next.|$|E

40|$|Scientific {{communities}} have adopted different conventions for ordering authors on publications. Are these choices inconsequential, {{or do they}} have significant influence on individual authors, {{the quality of the}} projects completed, and research communities at large? What are the trade-offs of using one convention over another? In order to investigate these questions, we formulate a basic two-player game theoretic model, which already illustrates interesting phenomena that can occur in more realistic settings. We find that <b>alphabetical</b> <b>ordering</b> can improve research quality, while contribution-based ordering leads to a denser collaboration network and a greater number of publications. Contrary to the assumption that free riding is a weakness of the <b>alphabetical</b> <b>ordering</b> scheme, this phenomenon can occur under any contribution scheme, and the worst case occurs under contribution-based ordering. Finally, we show how authors working on multiple projects can cooperate to attain optimal research quality and eliminate free riding given either contribution scheme...|$|R
