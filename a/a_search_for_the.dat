5|$|American {{shipwreck}} hunter David Mearns {{first learned}} of the battle in 1996, and began to study it {{as a prelude to}} <b>a</b> <b>search</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> ships in 2001. Mearns, with the aid of other researchers, focused on primary sources (rediscovering several archive files and diaries in the process), and {{came to the conclusion that}} the German accounts were true, and that the ship would be found at the northern position. After attracting the interest of the RAN, Mearns entered into a partnership with HMAS Sydney Search, a not-for-profit company set up to administer and help fund an expedition to locate Sydney and Kormoran. State and Federal government grants totalling just under A$5 million, coupled with private and corporate donations, were used to fund a 45-day search from the end of February to early April 2008.|$|E
5|$|As Connecticut {{was only}} 55% {{complete}} {{when she was}} launched, missing most of her upper works, protection, machinery and armament, {{it was two years}} before Connecticut was commissioned on 29 September 1906. Captain William Swift was the first captain of the new battleship. Connecticut sailed out of New York {{for the first time on}} 15 December 1906, becoming the first ship in the US Navy to ever go to sea without a sea trial. She first journeyed south to the Virginia Capes, where she conducted a variety of training exercises; this was followed by a shakedown cruise and battle practice off Cuba and Puerto Rico. During the cruise, she participated in <b>a</b> <b>search</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> missing steamer Ponce.|$|E

5|$|On 1 September Sercey raided Banda Aceh, {{capturing}} {{a number}} of merchant ships and on 7 September seized the small merchant ship Favourite off the northeastern coast of Sumatra en route to attack the British port of Penang. The following morning, as his squadron transferred rice from the prize, two large sails appeared in {{the distance to the}} northeast. These sails belonged to the 74-gun British ships of the line HMS Arrogant under Captain Richard Lucas and HMS Victorious under Captain William Clark. These ships had been sent to the East Indies from the Cape at the start of August on orders from Elphinstone and were engaged in protecting British trade with China. When news reached Penang that Sercey was in the region, Lucas ordered Clark to join him in <b>a</b> <b>search</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> French in the Straits of Malacca.|$|E
5|$|On 24 August 2012, the University of Leicester and Leicester City Council, in {{association}} with the Richard III Society, announced that they had joined forces to begin <b>a</b> <b>search</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> remains of King Richard. The search for Richard III was led by Philippa Langley of the Society's Looking For Richard Project with the archaeological work led by University of Leicester Archaeological Services (ULAS). Experts set out to locate the lost site of the former Greyfriars Church (demolished during Henry VIII's dissolution of the monasteries), and to discover whether his remains were still interred there. By comparing fixed points between maps in a historical sequence, the search located the Church of the Grey Friars, where Richard's body had been hastily buried without pomp in 1485, its foundations identifiable beneath a modern-day city centre car park.|$|E
5|$|On May 3, men {{claiming}} to be {{acting on behalf of}} Baxter supporters hijacked a train from Memphis, Tennessee, and arrested federal Court Justices John E. Bennett and E.J.

For several days, their whereabouts were unknown to the public and federal officials began <b>a</b> <b>search</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Justices. Justice Bennett was able to send a letter to Captain Rose demanding to know why they were being held by the Governor of Arkansas. Upon receipt of the letter, troops were sent to Benton to retrieve the two Justices, but they had escaped by May 6 and made their way to Little Rock.|$|E

5|$|The Danish foreign {{ministry}} reviewed the 348documents that the BBC obtained in 2001 under the Freedom of Information Act. In January 2009, foreign minister Per Stig Møller commissioned {{a study by}} the Danish Institute for International Studies (DIIS) to compare the 348 documents with 317 documents released by the Department of Energy in 1994 in order to determine if the 348 documents contained any new information about an intact nuclear weapon at Thule. In August 2009, DIIS published its report, which contradicted the assertions of the BBC. The report concluded that there was no missing bomb, and that the American underwater operation was <b>a</b> <b>search</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> uranium-235 of the fissile core of a secondary. For the first time, the report was able to present an estimate of the amount of plutonium contained in the pits of the primaries.|$|E
5|$|The {{second of}} James Cook's {{historic}} voyages, 1772–1775, was primarily <b>a</b> <b>search</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> elusive Terra Australis Incognita {{that was still}} believed to lie somewhere in the unexplored latitudes below 40°S. Cook left England in September 1772 with two ships, HMS Resolution and HMS Adventure. After pausing at Cape Town, on 22 November the two ships sailed due south, but were driven to the east by heavy gales. They managed to edge further south, encountering their first pack ice on 10 December. This soon became a solid barrier, which tested Cook's seamanship as he manoeuvered for a passage through. Eventually, he found open water, {{and was able to}} continue south; on 17 January 1773, the expedition reached the Antarctic Circle at 66°20'S, the first ships to do so. Further progress was barred by ice, and the ships turned north-eastwards and headed for New Zealand, which they reached on 26 March.|$|E
5|$|About 19hours before landfall, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) {{issued a}} {{tropical}} storm warning from Apalachicola to Venice, Florida, which was preceded by {{a tropical storm}} watch six hours prior. As the storm intensified further, the NHC issued a hurricane warning from Apalachicola to Anclote Key, and extended the tropical storm warning westward to Fort Walton Beach. The agency later issued a tropical storm warning for the Atlantic coast from Cape Canaveral to Little River Inlet in South Carolina. Officials ordered evacuations for barrier islands in nine Florida counties along the gulf coast, and about 3,000people stayed in shelters. Government offices closed along the storm's projected path in the state. Later, the storm forced the cancellation of part of Bob Dole's bus tour through New York, and postponed <b>a</b> <b>search</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> wreck of TWA Flight 800. Game one of the 1996 World Series was postponed by one day due to the storm.|$|E

Hank and Jacob meet with Baxter and Carl at the police station. Sarah grows skeptical of Baxter, whom she later discovers to be an impostor; she contacts and warns Hank, who steals a handgun from Carl's office. The four men head {{into the woods and}} split up. When he finds the plane, Baxter kills Carl, and engages in a gunfight with Hank. Hank manages to kill Baxter with the gun he had stolen. Hank starts to concoct another story to tell the authorities. Jacob however announces that {{he does not want to}} live with these bad memories; he threatens to shoot himself to end it. He then encourages Hank to kill him instead and frame Baxter for the crime. After grappling with the decision, Hank kills Jacob.|$|E
5|$|Forgotten {{for nearly}} 13 years, the Changi Murals were accidentally rediscovered in 1958 by {{servicemen}} of the Royal Air Force (RAF) occupying the Roberts Barracks. The Chapel was again {{used as a}} store, and later as accommodation by the RAF. Once rediscovered, the distemper coating covering the murals was carefully removed – four complete murals and the top-quarter of a fifth were revealed. As there was no signature {{on any of the}} murals, <b>a</b> <b>search</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> artist was undertaken but failed after initial investigations. By a stroke of luck, the artist's name came to light in the RAF Changi Education Library of all places. A reader came across a book titled The Churches of the Captivity in Malaya, mentioning about the Chapel of St Luke in Roberts Barracks and the artist's name – Bombardier Stanley Warren. The Daily Mirror was notified and again went to work looking for the known artist. In February 1959, he was found living in London with his wife and son. He was shocked when he saw the photo of his mural of the Crucifixion, when a keen-eyed colleague of his showed him the papers.|$|E
5|$|Pressed by Franklin's wife, Jane, Lady Franklin, and others, the Admiralty {{launched}} <b>a</b> <b>search</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> missing expedition in 1848. Prompted {{in part by}} Franklin's {{fame and}} the Admiralty's offer of a finder's reward, many subsequent expeditions joined the hunt, which {{at one point in}} 1850 involved eleven British and two American ships. Several of these ships converged off the east coast of Beechey Island, where the first relics of the expedition were found, including the graves of three crewmen. In 1854, explorer John Rae, while surveying near the Canadian Arctic coast southeast of King William Island, acquired relics of and stories about the Franklin party from local Inuit. A search led by Francis Leopold McClintock in 1859 discovered a note left on King William Island with details about the expedition's fate. Searches continued through much of the 19thcentury. In 2014, a Canadian search team led by Parks Canada located the wreck of Erebus west of O'Reilly Island, in the eastern portion of Queen Maud Gulf, in the waters of the Arctic archipelago. Finally, two years later, the wreck of Terror was found south of King William Island in pristine condition by the Arctic Research Foundation.|$|E

5|$|Rodimus, {{being given}} {{half of the}} Matrix, decides to lead <b>a</b> <b>search</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> fabled Knights of Cybertron {{in the hope that}} they can help restore order to Cybertron. Taking to the stars on board the ship called the Lost Light, Rodimus is joined by Ultra Magnus and Drift as his second-and-third-in-commands, Ratchet, Chromedome, Rewind, Swerve, Brainstorm, Rung, Whirl and a {{reformed}} Cyclonus, among several others. Following an unexpected quantum jump upon launch, the Lost Light is hurled off into the depths of space, where the crew is joined by Skids and contends with a stowaway Sparkeater. A visit to Delphi by Ratchet to help cure a plague introduces the threat of the Decepticon Justice Division, who then feature in a Decepticon-dedicated story menacing a band of misfit Decepticons, and also brings the facility's surviving patients and staff onto the ship—including Fortress Maximus, whose post-traumatic stress causes him to snap and nearly kill Rung. Hoping to cure Rung's damaged brain, Rewind gathers a small group together to recount a shared story from their past about Orion Pax foiling a Senate plot to discredit the burgeoning Decepticon movement in the days of Functionism. Chromedome is manipulated by Drift into carrying out a plan laid out by Prowl: using his mnemosurgery skills to tap the memories and learn the secrets of mass-murdering Decepticon Overlord, secretly hidden on board the Lost Light. Unfortunately, Chromedome accidentally allows Overlord to escape, and Rewind has to sacrifice himself to jettison the monster from the ship before the section of the ship is blown up. Drift admits to responsibility for Overlord's actions, resulting in his exile, even though Rodimus later reveals he {{was a part of the}} plot as well. Ultra Magnus is also fatally wounded in the battle, but when his body disappears from the ship's Medibay, the crew track it to Luna 1, where they discover and foil a twisted plot by Chief Justice Tyrest to wipe out all those Transformers he sees as tainted by original sin.|$|E
