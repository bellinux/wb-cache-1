5|$|The song's {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{was directed by}} Joseph Kahn and produced by Danyi Deats-Barrett. The concept of the video was conceived by Clarkson and depicts her as a bride who experiences some dream-like hints that her husband-to-be is {{having an affair with}} a brunette ceremony attendee. The music video premiered online at MTV and it also received heavy rotation on Total Request Live. The song was performed live by Clarkson at numerous venues, including the Breakaway World Tour (2005) and the <b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>Ever</b> Wanted Tour (2009).|$|E
5|$|I {{longed for}} real companionship, for {{apart from that}} life had nothing to offer me in Darmstadt...So {{naturally}} I am bitterly disappointed with myself when I look back, and see {{that in spite of}} great ambitions, good intentions, and real effort, my hopes have nevertheless been completely ship-wrecked...You say, darling, that you would never have caused me hardship intentionally...I only regret the lack of any intention or desire – or rather insight – to be more to me, and that does not mean spending all your time with me, without wishing to share anything with me at the same time. But I am wrong to talk of these things. Your letters are so dear and kind – but so empty and bare – I feel myself through them that I have less to say to you than any other person. Rain – fine weather – things that have happened – that is <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> have to tell you about – so utterly cut off is my real self, my innermost life, from yours...I have tried again and again {{to talk to you about}} more serious things, when I felt the need to do so – but we never meet each other – we have developed separately...and that is why I feel true companionship is an impossibility for us – because our thoughts will never meet...I love you too so very much, my darling husband, and that is why it is so sad to feel that our life is nevertheless so incomplete...But you are never intentionally to blame for this – I never think that, never...|$|E

25|$|Clarkson's fourth album, <b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>Ever</b> Wanted, was {{released}} on March 10, 2009. Clarkson continued to co-write her own material, {{but this time she}} returned to a mainstream-oriented sound by reuniting with previous collaborators Dr. Luke, Martin, and DioGuardi, and new collaborators Howard Benson, Claude Kelly, Ryan Tedder, Glen Ballard, Matt Thiessen and Katy Perry in contributing tracks for the album. The release of <b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>Ever</b> Wanted was met with positive acclaim from music critics for its lighter themes. The album was a commercial success, debuting at number one on the Billboard 200 and staying there for two weeks. The album has sold 960,000 copies in the U.S. and garnered Clarkson a nomination for Best Pop Vocal Album at the 52nd Grammy Awards.|$|E
25|$|The {{music video}} {{for the song}} was {{directed}} by Wayne Isham and was shot in Los Angeles in December 2008. It is available for digital download on iTunes and is featured on the DVD of the Deluxe Edition of <b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>Ever</b> Wanted. A preview of the video was shown during a commercial break for American Idol on January 28, 2009. The full video then premiered via AT's website directly after the broadcast. The video was subsequently nominated for a 2009 MTV Video Music Award in the category for Best Female Video.|$|E

25|$|Clarkson {{began writing}} new {{material}} for the album in November 2009 while touring and finished recording in February 2011. Despite its original intent {{to be released in}} late 2010, the release date of the album was pushed back several times. The record is predominantly a pop rock album, with several music critics noting the predominant R and country influences Clarkson explored in Thankful (2003) and <b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>Ever</b> Wanted, as well as dance-pop themes which she had recently developed. The album's lyrical content mainly explores themes about heartbreak, vengeance, forgiveness and empowerment through metaphors about Clarkson's relationships around people.|$|E
25|$|Stronger is {{the fifth}} studio album by American singer Kelly Clarkson, {{released}} on October 21, 2011 by RCA Records. The thirteen-song track-list features Clarkson collaborating with various new producers {{as well as with}} Howard Benson, whom she collaborated with on her previous album, <b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>Ever</b> Wanted (2009). Wanting to stray away sonically from her previous albums, Clarkson's main objective was to record her vocal performances as it is heard in her live sets, and used as little auto-tune processing as possible. The album also marked the first release by Clarkson that did not cause a conflict with RCA; her previous records, most notably My December (2007), were released amidst conflict and controversy.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to the tired former prisoners and civilians, {{the majority of the}} Rangers had only slept for five to six hours over the past three days. The soldiers frequently had hallucinations or fell asleep as they marched. Benzedrine was distributed by the medics to keep the Rangers active during the long march. One Ranger commented on the effect of the drug: [...] "It felt like your eyes were popped open. You couldn't have closed them if you wanted to. One pill was <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> took—it was <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> needed." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of <b>all</b> <b>I</b> have <b>ever</b> known, Clare {{has always}} been the least altered in [...] {{everything}} from the excellent qualities and kind affections which [...] attached me to him so strongly at school. I should hardly have thought [...] it possible for society (or the world, as it is called) to leave a [...] being with so little of the leaven of bad passions. I do not speak [...] from personal experience only, but from <b>all</b> <b>I</b> have <b>ever</b> heard of him [...] from others, during absence and distance." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "It {{was because}} I loved them so," [...] {{she said at}} last, brokenly. [...] "That was why it was, even from the first--even before I knew that they--they were <b>all</b> <b>I</b> should <b>ever</b> have. And <b>I</b> loved them so!" ...|$|R
500|$|Despite her {{dissatisfaction with}} the song's release as a single, Clarkson began {{promoting}} it in July 2009, performing it live on the Late Show with David Letterman and other talk shows. In the fall, she performed the song on VH1 Divas and at the American Music Awards. She [...] included [...] "Already Gone" [...] in the encore set of her 2009 <b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>Ever</b> Wanted Tour. Clarkson has also performed the song in tours after. The song has received much praise from music critics, and is {{regarded as one of}} the highlights of <b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>Ever</b> Wanted. Critics have praised the song for its expressions of vulnerability, its emotional impact, and its successful use of the ballad form. It peaked at number13 on the Billboard Hot 100, and was certified Platinum in Canada and Gold in Australia.|$|E
500|$|... "Already Gone" [...] was co-written by Clarkson and OneRepublic {{lead singer}} Ryan Tedder. Tedder {{describes}} it as [...] "an emotional, heartbreaking breakup song." [...] Tedder and Clarkson wrote six songs together for inclusion on Clarkson's fourth studio album <b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>Ever</b> Wanted, and [...] "Already Gone" [...] {{is one of three}} of those that appear on the track list.|$|E
500|$|Soon after {{composing}} [...] "Halo", Tedder {{worked with}} Kelly Clarkson on her fourth studio album, <b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>Ever</b> Wanted (2009), {{for which they}} wrote [...] "Already Gone" [...] together. When the song came out, critics noted a resemblance to Beyoncé's [...] "Halo". Clarkson, however, initially stated that she was unaware of any similarities between the two songs. She eventually realized their resemblance when she listened to both recordings closely; the similarities are most notable in the backing tracks, which in both cases feature a melancholy piano, loud drums, and handclaps. Clarkson tried to prevent [...] "Already Gone" [...] from being included on <b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>Ever</b> Wanted, but the decision was out of her hands, as her album was already being printed when I Am... Sasha Fierce came out. She accused Tedder of using the same arrangement on both [...] "Already Gone" [...] and [...] "Halo", and complained that people would, incorrectly, assume she was stealing it from Beyoncé.|$|E

500|$|... "Already Gone" [...] {{is a song}} {{performed}} by American pop singer-songwriter Kelly Clarkson from her fourth studio album, <b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>Ever</b> Wanted. It is co-written by Clarkson and Ryan Tedder, who also produced it. The song was released as the album's third single in August 2009. Lyrically, [...] "Already Gone" [...] is about the breakup of a relationship; the music consists of an arrangement using a piano, drums, and string instruments.|$|E

Later in life Ellison claimed that at Te Aute he learned, [...] "nearly <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> knew of forward play".|$|E
500|$|Between 1971 and 1973, Sonny and Cher's {{recording}} {{career was}} revived with four albums released under Kapp Records and MCA Records: Sonny & Cher Live (1971), <b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>Ever</b> Need Is You (1972), Mama Was a Rock and Roll Singer, Papa Used to Write All Her Songs (1973), and Live in Las Vegas Vol. 2 (1973).

[...] After travelling at 400mph (644km/h), the 67-year-old Frenchman said [...] "C'était magnifique... It was <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> dreamed of in aviation—no propellers, no vibration." [...] The Daily Mail entertained him at the Royal Aero Club in London, where he was accompanied by his former rival, Claude Grahame-White.|$|E

Watts-Russell later said [...] "that's probably <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> heard Joey really say," [...] and by that time, Santiago's quietness had been noted by those close to the band. The Pixies' first release, Come On Pilgrim, featured his trademark angular lead guitar on tracks such as [...] "The Holiday Song" [...] and [...] "Vamos".|$|E
500|$|Before teaming with Clarkson {{to write}} [...] "Already Gone", Ryan Tedder had co-written Beyoncé's song [...] "Halo" [...] for her album I Am... Sasha Fierce.

She confronted Tedder about using the same arrangement, claiming that people would assume she had stolen it from Knowles. Clarkson tried to have the song removed from <b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>Ever</b> Wanted, {{but it was too}} late to make any changes; the album was already being pressed and it was not possible to make any changes to the track listing.|$|E
