25|$|One of {{the first}} things Tacitus {{mentions}} in his work Germania is that the Germanic people treasure their animals above all else. Tacitus also concludes that the Germanic people found cultivation repulsive. Instead, he states, the Germanic people devote themselves to food and sleep and besides that they prefer to remain idle. <b>All</b> <b>of</b> <b>this,</b> <b>to</b> certain extents, applied to Jämtland. When the people of Jämtland settled down they relied mostly on pastoralism (transhumance). Their animals were the source of wealth and they were therefore loved by their owners. This love for the livestock has manifested itself in the dialect, a male nipple is called bokkjen (the buck) and a female nipple is known as geita (the goat).|$|E
500|$|A natural goalscoring forward, Friday {{was also}} unselfish and would take {{just as much}} {{pleasure}} out of setting up a goal scored by a teammate as netting one himself. He possessed fine ball control and dribbling skills, and could also shoot with both great power and sharp accuracy. The strong physical aspect of his game and exceptionally competitive, combative spirit combined with <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>to</b> create a formidable forward player: such was his ability that his arrival transformed Reading {{into one of the}} division's best sides in a matter of weeks. Writing in 2010, Roger Titford stressed Friday's immediate and profound impact on the Reading team as a key factor in his lasting popularity: [...] "It was like the comic-book stories that kids from Robin's era would have read", he wrote. [...] "He was a ready-made star".|$|E

50|$|Also spurring {{the growth}} in the {{importance}} of Hojōjutsu was its use in the arrest of criminals and the codified methods of tying employed by various schools and agencies, which sometimes provided numerous different methods of binding prisoners on the basis of considerations as different as social status, profession, and sex <b>of</b> the prisoner—with <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> added <b>to</b> the methods devised by those directly in the employ of the court system in Edo itself.|$|R
