The initial appeal was {{dismissed}} by UEFA, but a second appeal {{from the club}} was upheld and a replay was ordered to take place at least 150 kilometres (90 miles) from Glasgow. The Celtic board acquiesced to this decision in spite of considered opinion that Celtic should withdraw from the tournament on principle. As such, the match at Parkhead was declared void and a third match was held in Manchester at Old Trafford. Celtic lost 0–1, the goal coming on 18 minutes when after Roy Aitken had hit the post with an effort for Celtic, Rapid immediately caught Celtic on the break to score the only goal of the game. Worse, two Celtic fans assaulted Rapid Wien players; one fan running onto the pitch and accosting the goalkeeper during the game, whilst at full-time another Rapid player was kicked by a fan. UEFA fined Celtic and ordered their next home European tie to take place behind closed doors.|$|E

[...] In addition, there is also no standing where the injury is not [...] "actual or imminent," [...] but is instead [...] "conjectural or hypothetical." [...] The court believed that the plaintiffs' <b>alleged</b> <b>injury</b> was [...] "conjectural or hypothetical," [...] because it required speculation that state legislators would respond to a reduction in revenue caused by the credit (a consequence the Court also found speculative, and unlikely) by increasing the plaintiffs' taxes.

2500|$|Chief Justice Roberts {{authored}} a dissenting opinion. First, {{the dissent}} condemns the majority's [...] "special solicitude" [...] conferred to Massachusetts as having {{no basis in}} Supreme Court cases dealing with standing. The dissent compares the majority opinion to [...] "the previous high-water mark of diluted standing requirements," [...] United States v. SCRAP (1973). Roberts then argues that the <b>alleged</b> <b>injury</b> (i.e., Massachusetts' loss of land because of rising sea levels) is too speculative and without adequate scientific support. The dissent also finds that {{even if there is}} a possibility that the state may lose some land because of global warming, the effect of obliging the EPA to enforce automobile emissions is hypothetical at best. According to Roberts, there is not a traceable causal connection between the EPA’s refusal to enforce emission standards and petitioners' injuries. Finally, the dissent maintains that redressability of the injuries is even more problematic given that countries such as India and China are responsible for the majority of the greenhouse-gas emissions. The Chief Justice concludes by accusing the majority of lending the Court as a convenient forum for policy debate and of transgressing the limited role afforded to the Supreme Court by the U.S. Constitution.|$|E

[...] On a similar note they cited Frothingham v. Mellon, 262 U.S. 447, 487 (1923) that [...] "a federal taxpayer’s interest in the moneys of the treasury 'is shared with millions of others; is comparatively minute and indeterminable; and the effect upon future taxation, of any payment out of the funds, so remote, fluctuating and uncertain, that no basis is afforded for an appeal to the preventive powers of a court of equity.'" ...|$|E

40|$|Specifically, this Article {{examines}} whether {{settlement agreements}} and consent decrees resulting from what {{would otherwise be}} immunized litigation are protected from antitrust scrutiny and liability under Noerr. In order to conduct this analysis, this Article develops a methodology for determining immunity by focusing the immunity examination upon the means used to petition government {{and the source of}} the <b>alleged</b> <b>injuries.</b> Ultimately, private conduct is immune from antitrust scrutiny when it represents a valid attempt to persuade an independent governmental decision-maker in an effort to solicit government action, and the <b>alleged</b> <b>injuries</b> result from that persuasive effort. The validity of any effort depends upon the forum in which the petitioning is conducted without reference to antitrust. By focusing upon the means used to petition government, this analysis ensures that Noerr immunity protects the people 2 ̆ 7 s right to petition their government for the redress of grievances without unnecessarily limiting the protection afforded by the antitrust laws...|$|R
