Eva's bitchiness should be enjoyed by an audience, but they should also be investing in the plight of a young girl's eviction. The narrative of this section is so well structured that it is obvious the journey of the mistress is complete by her exit. This allows the audience to invest in a single moment while also learning more about Eva and Peron's character as they move forward in the story.|$|E
25|$|Solon's {{economic}} reforms {{need to be}} understood {{in the context of}} the primitive, subsistence economy that prevailed both before and after his time. Most Athenians were still living in rural settlements right up to the Peloponnesian War. Opportunities for trade even within the Athenian borders were limited. The typical farming family, even in classical times, barely produced enough to satisfy its own needs. Opportunities for international trade were minimal. It has been estimated that, even in Roman times, goods rose 40% in value for every 100 miles they were carried over land, but only 1.3% for the same distance were they carried by ship <b>and</b> <b>yet</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> no evidence that Athens possessed any merchant ships until around 525 BC. Until then, the narrow warship doubled as a cargo vessel. Athens, like other Greek city states in the 7th Century BC, was faced with increasing population pressures and by about 525 BC it was able to feed itself only in 'good years'.|$|E

While making the film, Renoir knew a new world war was coming; he later said {{there was a sense of}} it in film, and wrote [...] "it is a war film <b>and</b> <b>yet</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> no reference to the war." [...] This sense of doom began just before shooting started in January when Barcelona fell to Franco and throughout the production when Prime Minister of France Édouard Daladier recognized Francoist Spain, Italy annexed Albania and Adolf Hitler prepared his Polish invasion.

500|$|Reviewing the CD-ROM based Saturn port, EGM {{commented that}} the {{graphics}} are identical to the arcade version but that there are missing sound effects and [...] "unbearable" [...] slowdown when first performing a special move. They rated it the best home version of the game to date but felt that with Mortal Kombat II having considerably aged by this point, any port needed to be near arcade perfect to stand out. Next Generation felt that the Saturn version was arcade perfect, but that the Mortal Kombat series {{as a whole was}} grossly overrated and lacked any gameplay innovations to make it stand out from other fighting games. They summarized that [...] "if you are a fan of the game (and you know who you are), then the Saturn version is everything you can hope for - an arcade-perfect translation - <b>and</b> <b>yet,</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> nothing outside of a flashy presentation and a little gore to recommend this game over a million others just like it." [...] Scary Larry of GamePro agreed that the Saturn port [...] "duplicates the arcade version perfectly", but argued that the slowdown and load times make the game frustrating to play. He concluded that the conversion would make a decent holdover until Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 hit the Saturn, but fails to measure up to Mortal Kombat 3 on the PlayStation. Sega Saturn Magazine was extremely disappointed with {{the final version of the}} Saturn port, calling it [...] "much worse than any of the versions seen on the cartridge format," [...] as opposed to the vastly superior pre-release version they had reviewed five months earlier.|$|E

[...] Here Madonna is a more human mother, with divinity only expressed through the halo. [...] The Christ child and Saint John are both children. [...] The painting is more reflective of natural circumstances. <b>And,</b> <b>yet,</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a severity of this Madonna that will ease into a greater naturalness, such as the Alba Madonna slightly later into Raphael's Roman period.|$|E

Despite this opposition, which eventually culminated in protests, [...] "the county proceeded to present the city of Camden with a check for $1 million in March 1989, {{in exchange for the}} eighteen acres of city-owned land where the new facility was to be built.....The $112 million plant finally fired up {{for the first time in}} March 1991".|$|E

2500|$|Positive {{analysis}} of the poem came from Leigh Hunt, in the 21 October 1821 Examiner when Hunt wrote a piece on Coleridge {{as part of his}} [...] "Sketches of the Living Poets" [...] series. When coming to [...] "Kubla Khan", he pointed out: [...] "instead of being content to have written finely under the influence of laudanum, recommends 'Kubla-Khan' to his readers, not as a poem, but as 'a psychological curiosity' ... Every lover of books, scholar or not, who knows what it is to have his quarto open against a loaf at his tea ... ought to be in possession of Mr. Coleridge's poems, if it is only for 'Christabel', 'Kubla Khan', and the 'Ancient Mariner'." [...] When talking about the poem on its own, Hunt claimed it [...] "is a voice and a vision, an everlasting tune in our mouths, a dream fit for Cambuscan and all his poets, a dance of pictures such as Giotto or Cimabue, revived and re-inspired, would have made for a Storie of Old Tartarie, a piece of the invisible world made visible by a sun at midnight and sliding before our eyes ... Justly is it thought that to be able to present such images as these to the mind, is to realise the world they speak of. We could repeat such verses as the following down a green glade, a whole summer's morning". The work went without major notice until John Bowring reviewed Coleridge's Poetical Works for the January 1830 Westminster Review. When discussing the work along with the origins of the poem, Bowring stated, [...] "The tale is extraordinary, but 'Kubla Khan' is much more valuable on another account, which is, that of its melodious versification. It is perfect music. The effect could scarcely have been more satisfactory to the ear had every syllable been selected merely for the sake of its sound. <b>And</b> <b>yet</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> throughout a close correspondence between the metre, the march of the verse, and the imagery which the words describe." [...] When concluding about the work, he declared, [...] "The elements of this melody are only the common and well-known ones of English versification; our author is always felicitous in their management, but no where has he blended them in so perfect a combination as in this instance." [...] Another emphasis on the musicality of the poem came in August 1834, with Henry Nelson Coleridge's analysis in the Quarterly Review: [...] "In some of the smaller pieces, as the conclusion of the 'Kubla Khan', for example, not only the lines by themselves are musical, but the whole passage sounds all at once as an outburst or crash of harps in the still air of autumn. The verses seem as if played to the ear upon some unseen instrument. And the poet's manner of reciting verse is similar." ...|$|E
