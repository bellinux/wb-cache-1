The politician Freeman Freeman-Thomas, the Marquess of Willingdon, became Lord Warden in 1936, followed by Sir Winston Churchill who followed him in 1941 during the Second World War.

25|$|In The Theory of the Leisure Class, Veblen writes {{critically}} of {{conspicuous consumption}} and its function in social-class consumerism and social stratification. Reflecting historically, he traces said economic behaviors {{back to the}} beginnings of the division of labor, or during tribal times. Upon the start of a division of labor, high-status individuals within the community practiced hunting and war, notably less labor-intensive and less economically productive work. Low-status individuals, on the other hand, practiced activities recognized as more economically productive and more labor-intensive, such as farming and cooking. High-status individuals, as Veblen explains, could instead <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> their lives leisurely (hence their title as the leisure class), engaging in symbolic economic participation, rather than practical economic participation. These individuals could engage in conspicuous leisure for extended periods of time, simply following pursuits that evoked a higher social status. Rather than participating in conspicuous consumption, the leisure class lived lives of conspicuous leisure as a marker of high status. The leisure class protected and reproduced their social status and control within the tribe through, for example, their participation in war-time activities, which while they were rarely needed, still rendered their lower social class counterparts dependent upon them. During modern industrial times, Veblen described the leisure class as those exempt from industrial labor. Instead, he explains, the leisure class participated in intellectual or artistic endeavors to display their freedom from the economic need to participate in economically productive manual labor. In essence, not having to perform labor-intensive activities did not mark higher social status, but rather, higher social status meant that one would not have to perform such duties.|$|E

2500|$|Nancy A. Denton and Douglass S. Massey {{devised a}} {{segregation}} index {{to measure the}} degree of segregation of African-Americans and whites according to income levels. [...] Their objective was {{to show that the}} discrimination of African Americans when it comes to housing was not related to income level, which many thought to be true. [...] Many have argued that continuing segregation is due to African Americans generally making less money, which means they cannot <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> in the same neighborhoods as affluent whites. [...] But as the segregation index by Denton and Massey showed, blacks still remained highly segregated from whites no matter what the income level was. For example, in 1980, black families earning $25,000 a year or less had an index level of 86 while those earning $50,000 or more had an index level of 83. This trend was common throughout most major metropolitan areas, especially prevalent in the northern cities. The goal of this index was to show that upward economic mobility did not affect the level of segregation in America’s cities. [...] It should be noted that Denton and Massey also surveyed Hispanics and Asians, and found on average the indices to be 64 which meant the poorest Hispanics and Asians were still less segregated than the most affluent blacks. Leslie Carr notes that in 1990, 74 percent of whites live in suburbs, while most African Americans and Hispanics live in urban areas, and that African Americans were a majority population in 14 cities (with populations over 100,000).

50|$|With the {{development}} of analog sound recording, though, a performance could be permanently fixed, {{in all of its}} elements: pitch, rhythm, timbre, ornaments and expression.
