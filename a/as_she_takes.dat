Unlike previous games in the series, separate difficulty settings for combat and puzzles are not available, changing the combat difficulty also affects the difficulty of puzzles. In {{the second half of}} the game Henry is accompanied and helped in combat by his neighbor Eileen Galvin; Eileen cannot die while she is with Henry, although <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>takes</b> damage she succumbs to possession. The damage Eileen takes in the game determines whether or not she dies during the final boss fight, directly affecting the ending achieved.|$|E

[...] The combination of frames captured at successive time intervals is given play, pictorially, in simultaneous conflation of moments in time throughout the work. The Cézannian volumes and planes (cones, cubes and spheres) extend ubiquitously across the manifold, merging the sitter and surroundings. The painting becomes a product of experience, memory and imagination, evoking a complex series of mind-associations between past present and future, between tactile and olfactory sensations (taste and touch), between the physical and metaphysical.|$|E
