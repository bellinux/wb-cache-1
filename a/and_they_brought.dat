5|$|The 6th Squadron, {{commanded}} by Major Charles Dick, were also sent forward {{to support the}} 2nd Squadron's attempt to break through to the post. Advancing along the ridge from No.2 Post, they reached {{a position on the}} open plateau to the north of No.3 Post, but neither of the relieving squadrons could break through the Turkish lines, and were confronted by heavy Turkish fire from the surrounding higher ground. They were blocked by the sheer number of Turkish troops. Around noon the Turks undermined and blew up part of the trench at No.3 Post, which they then occupied. Turkish attacks continued all day, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>brought</b> into action a mountain artillery gun from a nearby position. It was now estimated that around 3,000 Turkish troops were involved in the assault on No.3 Post.|$|E
5|$|The {{largest group}} of {{students}} during the first seven decades of the school were from Martha's Vineyard, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>brought</b> MVSL with them. There were also 44 students from around Henniker, New Hampshire, and 27 from the Sandy River valley in Maine, each of which had their own village sign language. Other students brought knowledge of their own home signs. Laurent Clerc, the first teacher at ASD, taught using French Sign Language (LSF), which itself had developed in the Parisian school for the deaf established in 1755. From this situation of language contact, a new language emerged, now known as ASL.|$|E

25|$|In the 12th century, Malay {{immigrants}} arrived. Most {{of their}} settlements were ruled by Malay chieftains. These people grew rice, ginger, coconuts, sweet potatoes, sugarcane and bananas.

25|$|As Great Britain became heavily wooded, {{movement}} {{between different}} areas was restricted, and travel between {{what was to}} become known as Wales and continental Europe became easier by sea, rather than by land. People came to Wales by boat from the Iberian Peninsula. These Neolithic colonists integrated with the indigenous people, gradually changing their lifestyles from a nomadic life of hunting and gathering, to become farmers, some of whom settled in the area that would become Glamorgan. They cleared the forests to establish pasture and to cultivate the land, developed new technologies such as ceramics and textile production, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>brought</b> a tradition of long barrow construction that began in continental Europe during the 7thmillenniumBC.|$|E
25|$|As the {{infantile}} Argentine {{wine industry}} became centralized {{in the western}} part of the country among the foothills of the mountains, the population centers of the country developed in the east. Transporting wine by means of a long wagon journey put a crimp in the growth of the wine industry that would not be eased till the 1885 completion of the Argentine railway that connected the city of Mendoza to Buenos Aires. Don Tiburcio Benegas, governor of the province of Mendoza and owner of El Trapiche wine estate, was instrumental in financing and pushing through the construction, convinced that in order for the Argentine wine industry to survive it needed a market. The 19th century also saw the first wave of immigrants from Europe. Many of these immigrants were escaping the scourge of the phylloxera epidemic that ravaged vineyards in their homeland <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>brought</b> with them their expertise and winemaking knowledge to their new home.|$|E
25|$|In the woods, David, Hook and Robin {{are ready}} to confront Arthur at his tent, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>brought</b> weapons along, just in case.

David demands to know who Nimue is and points his gun at Arthur. Arthur, however, decides to throw the threesome off with a table, then escapes into the wood with, the three in pursuit. After Arthur trips, he sees Hook and kicks him down and draws his sword on him, but just before he can kill Hook, Emma suddenly shows up and uses the now-reunited Excalibur stop Arthur's attack, telling a stunned Arthur that the sword no longer controls anyone, before sending him flying into a tree. Hook thanks Emma, but Emma says that there's no need to. Hook apologizes for what he said on his ship, and when Emma asks if he meant his saying that he didn't love her, or refusing to accept who she now was, {{he says that he}} still did and will always love her. When Emma asks Hook what he wants, he says that he wants to help her, and asks who Nimue is. She says that Nimue doesn't matter anymore, and that it will all be over tomorrow. Hook asks why she needs the sword. Emma walks away and Hook says he knows she has reasons for doing this, and Emma tells Hook that she does, and that sheâ€™s doing all of this for him, before disappearing.|$|E

It was turned down by ITV because it was [...] "old-fashioned" [...] and did not fit in with the network's existing portfolio of dramas.

By that time, the top levels of the ITV drama department had changed and due to Carlton's links with ITV, the BBC was unable to take the series.

500|$|The now three-piece Oasis {{chose to}} {{continue}} recording the album, with Noel Gallagher re-recording most of Arthurs' guitar and McGuigan's bass parts.

Finding a replacement bassist took more time and effort. The band were rehearsing with David Potts, but he quickly resigned, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>brought</b> in Andy Bell, former guitarist/songwriter of Ride and Hurricane No.1 as their new bassist. Bell had never played bass before and had to learn to play it (with Noel since saying that Liam said, [...] "If he can play the guitar, he can play the fookin' bass"), along with a handful of songs from Oasis' back catalogue, in preparation for a scheduled tour of America in December 1999.|$|E
500|$|The {{ancestors}} of today's African American population {{were brought to}} the United States as slaves, working primarily in the plantations of the South. They were from hundreds of tribes across West Africa, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>brought</b> with them certain traits of West African music including call and response vocals and complexly rhythmic music, as well as syncopated beats and shifting accents. The African musical focus on rhythmic singing and dancing was brought to the New World, and where it became part of a distinct folk culture that helped Africans [...] "retain continuity with their past through music". The first slaves in the United States sang work songs, field hollers and, following Christianization, hymns. In the 19th century, a Great Awakening of religious fervor gripped people across the country, especially in the South. Protestant hymns written mostly by New England preachers became a feature of camp meetings held among devout Christians across the South. When blacks began singing adapted versions of these hymns, they were called Negro spirituals. It was from these roots, of spiritual songs, work songs, and field hollers, that blues, jazz, and gospel developed.|$|E

500|$|The Zaian war {{continued}} {{for many years}} after El Herri with Henrys changing tactics from negotiation and bribery to [...] "submit or starve". [...] Subsequent victories in the Middle Atlas restored the French image of superiority in force and led to increasing submissions and {{the withdrawal of the}} Zaian deeper into the mountains. [...] By 1917 the French had managed to establish a military road straight through the Middle Atlas, limiting the free movement of the Zaian. [...] The end of the war came through political rather than military means with Hammou's sons submitting, on his advice, to the French in June 1920. [...] Their submission persuaded 3,000 tents of Zaian to follow and within six weeks just 2,500 tents remained opposed to French rule. [...] Hammou was killed in Spring 1921 by a Berber war party led by Hassan and soon after a combined French and Berber attack on Bekrit defeated the last remaining Zaian force, ending the seven-year-long war. [...] After the war, French expansion in the area continued <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>brought</b> almost the entire Middle Atlas under their control by June 1922.|$|E
