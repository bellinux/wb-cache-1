5000|$|Electronic Bells - Bells {{are quite}} {{hard to find}} at {{crossings}} now as many {{have been replaced by}} <b>audible</b> tone <b>alarm</b> <b>devices.</b> They were the first <b>audible</b> <b>alarm</b> warnings for crossings in the UK. Crossings had either an intermittent bell tone, where a bell would 'ding' about every second, (still operating at crossings such as at Canterbury (Kent), Charlton Lane (Greater London) or Chilworth (Surrey)), or a continuous bell, (still operating at crossings such as [...] (Staffordshire) [...] ). The only remaining crossings with bells are MCB type crossings. However Spatham Lane crossing in East Sussex {{is one of the few}} surviving half barrier type crossings in the UK with working bells.|$|R
5000|$|Yodalarm - These are {{the most}} used <b>audible</b> <b>alarm</b> <b>devices.</b> They are found at almost every MCB type {{crossing}} in Britain. Each alarm, at each crossing, has its own unique tone (usually a high pitch bleep, followed by a lower pitched bleep). The alarms have different volumes at different crossings, depending on how busy the crossing is, and whether residents are living nearby. The alarms sound for different durations at different types of crossings. Alarms sound from the activation of the crossing to when all barriers have fully lowered at MCB type crossings, alarms sound from the activation of the crossing to when the barriers raise at AHB (half barrier) type crossings and alarms sound for the whole time the crossing is active at non-barrier (AOCL) type crossings. At AHB and some AOCL crossings, {{the tone of the}} alarm often increases its speed, to alert pedestrians and drivers that a second train is approaching.|$|R

Fryers often come with {{features}} such as timers with an <b>audible</b> <b>alarm,</b> automatic <b>devices</b> to raise and lower the basket into the oil, measures to prevent food crumbs from becoming over cooked, ventilation systems to reduce frying odors, oil filters to extend the usable life of the oil, and mechanical or electronic temperature controls. Deep fryers are used for cooking many fast foods, and making them crisp.|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{increase}} in variety of equipment {{available for use}} {{in the intensive care unit}} and theatre has brought about the need to assess the role played by <b>audible</b> <b>alarm</b> during patient care. To assess the effects of <b>audible</b> monitor <b>alarm</b> on theatre and ICU personnel. Study design: Questionnaire designed to assess the effects of <b>audible</b> <b>alarms</b> on attention, workload and working memory were administered to theatre and ICU personnel. Results: Most respondents feel that <b>audible</b> <b>alarm</b> assist their attention; however 30 % of surgeons think otherwise. 20 % of the respondents feel that their workload is unnecessarily increased by audible alarm; physician anaesthetists make up a quarter of this group. When asked about the need to adjust the monitor alarms, about 60 % opined they adjust it to reduce the noise, while the others think it should only be adjusted to support identification of deranged parameters. About 10 % of the respondents feel their working memory is affected by the audible alarm; most people in this group are physician anaesthetists. Conclusions: Though <b>audible</b> monitor <b>alarm</b> is supporting attention of the user; it was incriminated as a cause of distractions, {{increase in}} workload and impairment of working memory. There is need to balance those advantages of the alarm system with measures to reduce the complaints of distraction by theatre users. This will make <b>audible</b> <b>alarm</b> in monitors more of a friend than a foe...|$|R

40|$|This paper surveys {{current work}} {{on the design of}} alarms for {{anesthesia}} environments and notes some of the problems arising from the need to interpret alarms in context. Anesthetists 2 ̆ 7 responses to <b>audible</b> <b>alarms</b> in the operating room were observed across four types of surgical procedure (laparoscopic, arthroscopic, cardiac, and intracranial) and across three phases of a procedure (induction, maintenance, and emergence). Alarms were classified as (a) requiring a corrective response, (b) being the intended result of a decision, (c) being ignored as a nuisance alarm, or (d) functioning as a reminder. Results revealed strong effects of the type of procedure and phase of procedure on the number and rate of <b>audible</b> <b>alarms.</b> Some alarms were relatively confined to specific phases; others were seen across phases, and responses differed according to phase. These results were interpreted in light of their significance for the development of effective alarm systems.

40|$|The Hartman Systems Integration Lab at Boise State University is {{currently}} maintaining and improving a wireless environmental sensor network {{for use in}} various applications by the FAA and Boeing. The devices which make up the network, called Personal Monitors (PMON), use various sensors to monitor and record data about {{the environment in which}} they are placed. The recorded data {{is currently}} stored on flash memory card (secured digital) and can be viewed in various formats by using computer software. This solution works well for analysis of data after it has been recorded. However, a system that can monitor incoming data (in real-time), as it is taken, would be desirable in order to alert a user to hazardous conditions. Our research has led us to design the solution known as the Personal Monitor <b>Alarm</b> Indication <b>Device</b> (PMON AID, or PAID). PAID is a compact device that will wirelessly monitor all active PMON units within its range and indicate if a hazard exists in the current environmental conditions. As it receives data, the PAID will compare the incoming value to a preset limit. If the incoming value is above this limit, the PAID will alert the wearer using an LED and an <b>audible</b> <b>alarm.</b> As an additional feature, the PAID will record the data from all units onto a micro secured digital memory card for off-line processing. Other features include the ability to turn off or silence the <b>audible</b> <b>alarm,</b> a rechargeable battery via USB, and an LED to indicate the operational status of the PAID...|$|R

40|$|Objective Four sets {{of eight}} <b>audible</b> <b>alarms</b> {{matching}} the functions specified in IEC 60601 - 1 - 8 were designed using known principles from auditory cognition {{with the intention}} {{that they would be}} more recognizable and localizable than those currently specified in the standard. Background The <b>audible</b> <b>alarms</b> associated with IEC 60601 - 1 - 8, a global medical device standard, are known to be difficult to learn and retain, and there have been many calls to update them. There are known principles of design and cognition that might form the basis of more readily recognizable alarms. There is also scope for improvement in the localizability of the existing alarms. Method Four alternative sets of alarms matched to the functions specified in IEC 60601 - 1 - 8 were tested for recognizability and localizability and compared with the alarms currently specified in the standard. Results With a single exception, all prototype sets of alarms outperformed the current IEC set on both recognizability and localizability. Within the prototype sets, auditory icons were the most easily recognized, but the other sets, using word rhythms and simple acoustic metaphors, were also more easily recognized than the current alarms. With the exception of one set, all prototype sets were also easier to localize. Conclusion Known auditory cognition and perception principles were successfully applied to an existing <b>audible</b> <b>alarm</b> problem. Application This work constitutes the first (benchmarking) phase of replacing the alarms currently specified in the standard. The design principles used for each set demonstrate the relative ease with which different alarm types can be recognized and localized...|$|R
