Two sites are selected for their natural significance: Alejandro de Humboldt National Park in the eastern provinces of Holguín and Guantánamo, and Desembarco del Granma National Park, named for the yacht which carried {{the members of the}} 26th of July Movement who started the Cuban Revolution. City landscapes include Old Havana, Trinidad, and Camagüey, all founded by early Spanish colonists in the 16th century. The sites also include historical <b>agricultural</b> <b>regions,</b> including the coffee plantations of southeastern Cuba, and the tobacco region of Viñales Valley.|$|E
5|$|Rich with sediments {{deposited}} by {{flooding and}} fed by prolific rainfall {{on the western}} side of the Cascades, the Willamette Valley {{is one of the most}} fertile <b>agricultural</b> <b>regions</b> in North America, and was thus the destination of many 19th-century pioneers traveling west along the Oregon Trail. The river was an important transportation route in the 19thcentury, although Willamette Falls, just upstream from Portland, was a major barrier to boat traffic. In the 21stcentury, major highways follow the river, and roads cross it on more than 50 bridges.|$|E

25|$|Thus, by the 1850s, Southern slaveholders and non-slaveholders alike felt {{increasingly}} encircled psychologically {{and politically}} {{in the national}} political arena because {{of the rise of}} free soilism and abolitionism in the Northern states. Increasingly dependent on the North for manufactured goods, for commercial services, and for loans, and increasingly cut off from the flourishing <b>agricultural</b> <b>regions</b> of the Northwest, they faced the prospects of a growing free labor and abolitionist movement in the North.|$|E
25|$|Agriculture {{is limited}} by the climate and soil {{conditions}} compared to southern regions of the state. However, there are significant potato and dry bean farms in the east. wine grapes, vegetables and cherries are produced in the west in the protected microclimates around Grand Traverse Bay. The Grand Traverse region has two of Michigan's four federally-recognized wine growing areas. The Grand Traverse Bay area is listed {{as one of the most}} endangered <b>agricultural</b> <b>regions</b> in the U.S. as its scenic land is highly sought after for vacation homes.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{its large}} size and {{wide range of}} {{geographic}} features, the United States contains examples of nearly every global climate. The climate is temperate in most areas, subtropical in the Southern United States, tropical in Hawaii and southern Florida, polar in Alaska, semiarid in the Great Plains west of the 100th meridian, Mediterranean in coastal California and arid in the Great Basin. Its comparatively favorable agricultural climate contributed (in part) to the country's rise as a world power, with infrequent severe drought in the major <b>agricultural</b> <b>regions,</b> {{a general lack of}} widespread flooding, and a mainly temperate climate that receives adequate precipitation.|$|E

25|$|The western {{slopes and}} plains fill a {{significant}} portion of the state's area and have a much sparser population than areas nearer the coast. Agriculture is central to the economy of the western slopes, particularly the Riverina region and Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area in the state's south-west. Regional cities such as Albury, Dubbo, Griffith and Wagga Wagga and towns such as Deniliquin, Leeton and Parkes exist primarily to service these <b>agricultural</b> <b>regions.</b> The western slopes descend slowly to the western plains that comprise almost two-thirds of the state and are largely arid or semi-arid. The mining town of Broken Hill is the largest centre in this area.|$|E
25|$|Northern California, often {{abbreviated}} NorCal, is {{the northern}} {{portion of the}} U.S. state of California. Spanning the state's northernmost 48 counties its main population centers include the San Francisco Bay Area (anchored by the cities of San Francisco, San Jose, and Oakland), the Greater Sacramento area (anchored by the state capital Sacramento), and the Metropolitan Fresno area (anchored {{by the city of}} Fresno). Northern California also contains redwood forests, along with the Sierra Nevada, including Yosemite Valley and part of Lake Tahoe, Mount Shasta (the second-highest peak in the Cascade Range after Mount Rainier in Washington), and most of the Central Valley, one of the world's most productive <b>agricultural</b> <b>regions.</b>|$|E
25|$|A minor {{nuclear war}} with each country using 50 Hiroshima-sized atom bombs as air-bursts on urban areas could produce climate change {{unprecedented}} in recorded human history. A nuclear {{war between the}} United States and Russia today could produce nuclear winter, with temperatures plunging below freezing in the summer in major <b>agricultural</b> <b>regions,</b> threatening the food supply {{for most of the}} planet. The climatic effects of the smoke from burning cities and industrial areas would last for several years, much longer than previously thought. New climate model simulations, which are said to have the capability of including the entire atmosphere and oceans, show that the smoke would be lofted by solar heating to the upper stratosphere, where it would remain for years.|$|E

25|$|A {{much larger}} number of firestorms, in the thousands, was the initial {{assumption}} of the computer modelers who coined the term in the 1980s. These were speculated to be a possible result of any large scale employment of counter-value airbursting nuclear weapon use during an American-Soviet total war. This {{larger number of}} firestorms, which are not in themselves modeled, are presented as causing nuclear winter conditions {{as a result of}} the smoke inputted into various climate models, with the depths of severe cooling lasting for as long as a decade. During this period, summer drops in average temperature could be up to 20°C (36°F) in core <b>agricultural</b> <b>regions</b> of the US, Europe, and China, and as much as 35°C (63°F) in Russia. This cooling would be produced due to a 99% reduction in the natural solar radiation reaching the surface of the planet in the first few years, gradually clearing over the course of several decades.|$|E
25|$|More {{and more}} Afghan tribal {{leaders have been}} {{requesting}} additional ADTs, which illustrates how important {{the use of public}} diplomacy has been in the efforts to win the trust of the Afghan people. The case study from Nangarhar Province in Afghanistan serves as an excellent example. This province {{is one of the most}} stable and secure provinces in Afghanistan. For example, over 100,000 Afghans have returned to province; the province has also been declared poppy-free in 2007 by the UN. Additionally, most districts within the province have all-weather paved roads and it is also one of the most productive <b>agricultural</b> <b>regions</b> in Afghanistan. ADT should further its progress within the provinces of Afghanistan in agricultural education, technical support, and logistics. To defeat the insurgency in Afghanistan public diplomacy is an essential force, ADTs help the US educate the population of Afghanistan with the hope of strengthening Afghan trust in the American mission in Afghanistan.|$|E
25|$|Five {{per cent}} of Canada's land area is arable, {{none of which}} is for {{permanent}} crops. Three per cent of Canada's land area is covered by permanent pastures.
