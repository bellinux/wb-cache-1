5|$|Some species, {{such as the}} Uruguayan Hippeastrum petiolatum, are sterile {{and unable}} to produce seeds. H. petiolatum is a sterile {{triploid}} that reproduces asexually, producing many bulbils around the mother bulb. These are light, and easily carried {{on the surface of}} water ensuring distribution of the species during the rainy season. Other species such as Hippeastrum reticulatum are self-pollinating, reproducing by distributing seed. Although this does not guarantee genetic diversity in natural populations, it is widely used by colonising species. These two examples are not however typical of the genus, which commonly reproduces through <b>allogamy.</b> One mechanism that limits self-pollination is that of self-incompatibility by which seeds are only produced by pollination from other plants. Furthermore, the plant generally releases its pollen about two days before its stigma is receptive, making cross-pollination more likely. Pollinators include Humming birds in subtropical areas, and moths.|$|E

25|$|Cross-pollination, {{also called}} <b>allogamy,</b> occurs when pollen is {{delivered}} from the stamen of one flower to {{the stigma of}} a flower on another plant of the same species.

25|$|Unlike organisms, a gene {{is passed}} down from a {{generation}} of organisms {{to the next generation}} either as perfect replicas of itself or as slightly mutated descendant genes. While organisms have ancestry graphs and progeny graphs via sexual reproduction, a gene has a single chain of ancestors and a tree of descendants. An organism produced by sexual cross-fertilization (<b>allogamy)</b> has at least two ancestors (its immediate parents), but a gene always has one ancestor per generation.|$|E

50|$|Although {{the great}} {{majority}} of Solanaceae exhibit poricidal pollen dehiscence, the bee-pollinated species in this genus use explosive dehiscence which is triggered when an insect lands on a flower; this ensures that the insect is covered in pollen.

5000|$|Dioecy (Greek: διοικία [...] "two households"; {{adjective}} form: dioecious) is {{a characteristic}} of a species, meaning that it has distinct male and female individual organisms. Dioecious reproduction is biparental reproduction. Dioecy is one method that excludes self-fertilization and promotes <b>allogamy</b> (outcrossing), and thus tends to reduce the expression of recessive deleterious mutations present in a population. Flowering plants have several other methods of excluding self-fertilization, called Self-incompatibility.|$|E
50|$|In {{dioecious}} plants, {{the stigma}} may receive pollen from several different potential donors. As multiple pollen tubes {{from the different}} donors grow through the stigma to reach the ovary, the receiving maternal plant may carry out pollen selection favoring pollen from less related donor plants. Thus post-pollination selection may occur {{in order to promote}} <b>allogamy</b> and avoid inbreeding depression. Also, seeds may be aborted selectively depending on donor-recipient relatedness.|$|E
50|$|The primary {{mechanism}} used by {{flowering plants}} to ensure outcrossing involves a genetic mechanism known as self-incompatibility. Various aspects of floral morphology promote <b>allogamy.</b> In plants with bisexual flowers, the anthers and carpels may mature at different times, plants being protandrous (with the anthers maturing first) or protogynous (with the carpels mature first). Monoecious species, with unisexual {{flowers on the}} same plant, may produce male and female flowers at different times.|$|E
5000|$|In plants, <b>allogamy</b> is used {{specifically}} {{to mean the}} use of pollen from one plant to fertilize the flower of another plant and usually synonymous with the term [...] "cross-fertilization" [...] or [...] "cross-pollination" [...] (outcrossing), though the latter term can be used more {{specifically to}} mean pollen exchange between different plant strains or even different plant species (where the term cross-hybridization can be used) rather than simply between different individuals.|$|E

50|$|Napa cabbage is {{an annual}} plant that reaches the {{generative}} {{period in the}} first year. It must be consumed in its vegetative period, {{so there is a}} challenge in cultivation not to reach the stadium of flowering. The stadium of flowering can be initiated by cold temperatures or the length of the day. Napa cabbage reproduces mainly by <b>allogamy.</b> Napa cabbage produces more leaves, bigger leaves and a higher biomass under long day conditions than under short day conditions.|$|E

5000|$|... "Allogamy" [...] (cross-fertilization) is a {{term used}} {{in the field of}} {{biological}} reproduction describing the fertilization of an ovum from one individual with the spermatozoa of another. By contrast, autogamy is the term used for self-fertilization. In humans, the fertilization event is an instance of <b>allogamy.</b> Self-fertilization occurs in hermaphroditic organisms where the two gametes fused in fertilization come from the same individual. This is common in plants (see Sexual reproduction in plants) and certain protozoans.|$|E

50|$|Outcrossing, cross-fertilization or <b>allogamy,</b> {{in which}} {{offspring}} are {{formed by the}} fusion of the gametes of two different plants, {{is the most common}} mode of reproduction among higher plants. About 55% of higher plant species reproduce in this way. An additional 7% are partially cross-fertilizing and partially self-fertilizing (autogamy). About 15% produce gametes but are principally self-fertilizing with significant out-crossing lacking. Only about 8% of higher plant species reproduce exclusively by non-sexual means. These include plants that reproduce vegetatively by runners or bulbils, or which produce seeds without embryo fertilization (apomixis). The selective advantage of outcrossing appears to be the masking of deleterious recessive mutations.|$|E

For each assay, branches containing from 10 to 84 inflorescences were used. These had previously been bagged in the budding phase to prevent natural pollination. Controlled pollinations were done at 1.5 – 2.0 -m height.|$|E

In this project the relationship between its mode of reproduction and its genetic diversity will be established. This relationship is particularly interesting as C. lanatus var. citroides has been evolving in a traditional farming system, under a low-anthropic selection. On the one hand, the accurate reproduction strategies of this species {{will be determined by}} studying the floral morphology, occurrence of autoincompatibility, rate of <b>allogamy.</b> On the other hand, the genetic structure inside different accessions, and the associated population genetic flow will be established. This genetic structure of the species, as well as the rate of <b>allogamy,</b> will be analyzed with the use of microsatellite (SSR) markers. The relevant microsatellite markers have been set up for the watermelon. The resolution of these SSR markers has been performed for the C. lanatus var. citroides, with optimal annealing temperature varying from 49 to 56 °C.

40|$|The {{degree to}} which stigmas are exserted above the stamen in flowers is a key {{determinant}} of cross-pollination (and hence <b>allogamy)</b> in many plant species. Most species in the genus Lycopersicon are obligate or facultative outcrossers and bear flowers with highly exserted stigmas. In contrast, the cultivated tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) bears flowers with flush or inserted stigmas promoting self-fertilization. It has been observed that a major QTL, se 2. 1, on chromosome 2 is responsible for {{a large portion of}} phenotypic variation for this trait and that mutation(s) at this locus were likely involved in the evolution from <b>allogamy</b> to autogamy in this genus. To understand the genetic and molecular basis of stigma exsertion, we have conducted a high-resolution mapping at the chromosome region harboring the se 2. 1 QTL. The results indicate that this is a compound locus, comprising at least five tightly linked genes, one controlling style length, three controlling stamen length, and the other affecting anther dehiscence, a taxonomic character used to distinguish Lycopersicon species from other solanaceous species. This cluster of genes may represent the vestiges of an ancient coadapted gene complex in controlling mating behavior...|$|E

40|$|Using marker genes the {{breeding}} system (mating type gene) {{and the structure}} (hairy stalk gene) of a zinc–lead mine population of Armeria maritima, an insect‐pollinated plant, was studied in situ. Strict <b>allogamy</b> occurs in the population in nature although this population shows self‐fertility in experimental garden plots. The population is divided into sub‐populations differing {{in the frequency of}} hairy stalked individuals. Gene flow between these sub‐populations is very low (if any) so that the differences, which are likely to have originated by chance, remain constant through generations.
