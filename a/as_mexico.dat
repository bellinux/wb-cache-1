5|$|Grasshoppers {{have had}} a long {{relationship}} with humans. Swarms of locusts can have devastating effects and cause famine, and even in smaller numbers, the insects can be serious pests.

5|$|Although more {{abundant}} in montane and northern coniferous woodlands {{such as the}} Sierra Nevada and the Cascade Range in northwestern North America, Gyromitra esculenta is found widely across the continent, as far south <b>as</b> <b>Mexico.</b> It is also common in Central Europe, less abundant in the east, and more in montane areas than lowlands. It has been recorded from Northern Ireland, from Uşak Province in Western Turkey, and from the vicinity of Kaş in the Antalya Province of Turkey's southern coast.|$|E
5|$|During {{the colonial}} period, present-day Argentina offered fewer {{economic}} advantages {{compared to other}} parts of the Spanish Empire such <b>as</b> <b>Mexico</b> or Peru, which caused it to assume a peripheral position within the Spanish colonial economy.

5|$|The bluntnose {{stingray}} {{is found}} in the western Atlantic Ocean, from Chesapeake Bay southward through the Florida Keys, the northern Gulf of Mexico, and the Greater and Lesser Antilles; on rare occasions it is found as far north as New Jersey and Massachusetts, as far south as Venezuela, and as far west <b>as</b> <b>Mexico.</b> It is absent from the southern Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean coast of Central America. Reports of this species from off Brazil and Argentina likely represent misidentifications of the groovebelly stingray (D.hypostigma).|$|E
5|$|With six wins in six matches, the Uruguayan coach Rubén Israel {{qualified}} {{the football}} team of El Salvador for {{the third round of}} the 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification (CONCACAF).

Four days later, a home defeat against Mexico (1–2) precipitated the departure of Rubén Israel whose poor relations with Jaime Rodríguez, president of the National Institute of Sport Salvador (INDES) were known all.|$|E
5|$|Boletus edulis has a {{cosmopolitan}} distribution, concentrated in cool-temperate to subtropical regions. It {{is common in}} Europe—from northern Scandinavia, south to the extremities of Greece and Italy—and North America, where its southern range extends as far south <b>as</b> <b>Mexico.</b> It is well known from the Borgotaro area of Parma, Italy, and has PGI status there. The European distribution extends north to Scandinavia and south to southern Italy and Morocco. In China, the mushroom can be found from the northeastern Heilongjiang Province to the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau and Tibet. It has been recorded growing under Pinus and Tsuga in Sagarmatha National Park in Nepal, {{as well as in}} the Indian forests of Arunachal Pradesh. In West Asia, the species has been reported from the northwest forests of Iran.|$|E

5|$|Hippeastrum {{species are}} {{concentrated}} in two centres of diversity, the main one in Eastern Brazil {{and the other in}} the central southern Andes of Peru, Bolivia and Argentina, on the eastern slopes and nearby foothills. Some species are found as far north <b>as</b> <b>Mexico</b> and the West Indies. The genus is thought to have originated in Brazil where at least 34 of the species have been found. Their habitat is mainly tropical and subtropical, though those species found south of the equator, or at sufficient altitude may be considered temperate. Hippeastrum is found {{in a wide range of}} habitats. Many are found in underbrush, while others prefer full sun. Hippeastrum angustifolium is an example of a species preferring flood areas, while other species prefer a drier habitat. There are also epiphytic species such as Hippeastrum aulicum, Hippeastrum calyptratum, Hippeastrum papilio and Hippeastrum arboricola, which require air circulation around their roots, which are in the subgenus Omphalissa.|$|E
5|$|The Church had its {{beginnings}} in 1926 just <b>as</b> <b>Mexico</b> {{plunged into a}} violent struggle between the anti-clerical government and Catholic rebels. The conflict centered in the west-central states like Jalisco, where González focused his missionary efforts. Given {{the environment of the}} time, La Luz del Mundo remained a small missionary endeavor until 1934 when it built its first temple. Thereafter the Church continued to grow and expand, interrupted only by an internal schism in 1942. Apostles: Aarón Joaquín is believed to be designated the ministry of the Lord by revelation of God, then his son Samuel; thereafter by his son Naasón. The Church is now present in 50 countries and has between 1 and 7 million adherents worldwide.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Dean, at {{its second}} landfall, dropped 4 to 8in (100 to 200mm) of {{rainfall}} across {{the western states}} of Jalisco and Nayarit. This rainfall trigged a mudslide in Jalisco which fell on 10houses and killed one of the occupants. Landslides in Puebla killed five people, and another was crushed when a wall in his house collapsed. One person in Veracruz was electrocuted after touching a power line while repairing his roof. In Michoacán, as the outer bands of the storm swept over the state, a man sheltering under a tree was struck by lightning. Two women died in Hidalgo when heavy rain collapsed their house's roof. Another man drowned while trying to cross a rain-swollen river in Tlacolula, Oaxaca. The heavy rains caused dozens of smaller landslides throughout the country, particularly in Veracruz and Tabasco, {{but most of them}} caused no fatalities. At least 50,000houses were damaged to varying degrees throughout the country. Although Dean's rains caused flooding as far inland <b>as</b> <b>Mexico</b> City, where they closed a portion of Puebla-Mexico highway, the damage was concentrated in the states of Quintana Roo and Veracruz.|$|E

5|$|The {{common loon}} or great {{northern}} diver (Gavia immer) is a large member of the loon, or diver, family of birds. Breeding adults have a plumage that includes a broad black head and neck with a greenish, purplish, or bluish sheen, blackish or blackish-grey upperparts, and pure whiteunderpartsexcept some black on the undertail coverts and vent. Non-breeding adults are brownish with a dark neck and head marked with dark grey-brown. Their upperparts are dark brownish-grey with an unclear pattern of squares on the shoulders, and the underparts, lower face, chin, and throat are whitish. The sexes look alike, though males are significantly larger and heavier than females. During the breeding season, they live on lakes and other waterways in Canada, the northern United States (including Alaska), {{as well as in}} southern parts of Greenland and Iceland. Small numbers breed on Svalbard and sporadically elsewhere in Arctic Eurasia. Common loons winter on both coasts of the US as far south <b>as</b> <b>Mexico,</b> and on the Atlantic coast of Europe.|$|E
5|$|The fruit {{bodies of}} A.abrupta grow on the ground, {{typically}} solitary, in mixed conifer and deciduous forests, usually during autumn. The {{frequency with which}} fruit bodies appear depends on several factors, such as season, location, temperature, and rainfall. The mushroom {{has been described as}} common in the Southeastern United States; in Texas, it has been called both infrequent, and common in the Big Thicket National Preserve. Like most other Amanita species, A.abrupta is thought to form mycorrhizal relationships with trees. This is a mutually beneficial relationship where the hyphae of the fungus grow around the roots of trees, enabling the fungus to receive moisture, protection and nutritive byproducts of the tree, and affording the tree greater access to soil nutrients. Amanita abrupta is widely distributed throughout eastern North America, where it has been found as far north as Quebec, Canada, and as far south <b>as</b> <b>Mexico.</b> Orson K. Miller claims to have found it in the Dominican Republic where it appeared to be growing in a mycorrizhal association with pine trees. Kuo also mentions a mycorrhizal relationship with both hardwoods and conifers, while Tulloss lists additional preferred tree hosts such as beech, birch, fir, tsuga, oak, and poplar. However, A.abrupta has been shown experimentally to not form mycorrhizae with Virginia Pine.|$|E
