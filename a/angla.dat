5000|$|Media Lengua {{was first}} {{documented}} in Salcedo, Cotopaxi about 100 km south of Quito, Ecuador, by Dutch linguist Pieter Muysken during fieldwork on Ecuadorian Kichwa. During Muysken's {{surveys of the}} language, he also described other highly relexified varieties of Kichwa, including Amazonian Pidgin, Kichwa-Spanish interlanguage, Saraguro Media Lengua, and Catalangu. A 2011 investigation of Salcedo Media Lengua, however, suggests that the language is no longer spoken by the locals in and around Salcedo Canton. Little {{is known about the}} current status of the other relexified varieties of Kichwa described by Muysken. Several investigations from 2005, 2008, and 2011, however, show that a variety of Media Lengua is currently being spoken in the northern province of Imbabura. The investigations estimate that Imbabura Media Lengua is spoken by 2,600 people, 600 in the community of Pijal aged 35 and roughly 2,000 in and around the community of <b>Angla,</b> typically 25-45 years of age, making Media Lengua an endangered language and moribund in Pijal. The variety of Media Lengua that is spoken in Pijal appears to have emerged {{at the beginning of the}} 20th century and had its first generation of native speakers in the 1910s. Pijal Media Lengua then spread to the nearby community of <b>Angla</b> in the 1950s and the 1960s through intercommunity marriages [...] and commerce.

50|$|Jarrín (2014) {{investigated}} sociolinguistic {{aspects of}} Media Lengua {{in the communities}} of <b>Angla,</b> Uscha, Casco-Valenzuela, and El Topo in the Province of Imbabura. With a series of surveys and interviews regarding language attitude and language usage, a complex linguistic environment emerged which changes from community to community. In the more urban communities of <b>Angla</b> and Casco-Valenzuela, Media Lengua is preferred and Quichua appears to be losing ground. In the more rural communities of Uscha and El Topo, Kichwa is still preferred and the usage of Media Lengua is frowned upon. Jarrín (2014) also reports that there are also cases of children acquiring Media Lengua from their parents and grandparents, {{which is not the}} case in Pijal. In Pijal speakers of Media Lengua are typically aged 35 and above, those aged 20-35 typically have a passive knowledge of the language, and speakers aged 20 and younger are often monolingual in Spanish. Estimates of the number of speakers vary widely. In Pijal, there is an estimated 300 to 500 speakers while in the communities of <b>Angla,</b> Uscha, Casco-Valenzuela, and El Topo, there may be as many 2000+ speakers.|$|E

5000|$|Several {{theories}} exist {{concerning the}} origins of Media Lengua. According to Muysken, Salcedo Media Lengua emerged through ethnic self-identification for indigenous populations, who no longer identified with either the rural Kichwa or the urban Spanish cultures. Gómez-Rendón claims <b>Angla</b> Media Lengua arose through prolonged contact between the Kichwa-speaking indigenous populations with the Mestizo Spanish speaking populations. Dikker believes Media Lengua was created by men who left their native communities to work in urban Spanish speaking areas. When the men returned to the communities, they had acquired a fluent level of Spanish and had been using Kichwa infrequently. Media Lengua then served as {{a link between the}} older monolingual Kichwa-speaking generation and younger monolingual Spanish speaking generations. Finally, Stewart claims that Media Lengua was either brought to Pijal from Salcedo or vice versa. He bases these claims on the [...] "striking resemblance" [...] between the Pijal and Salcedo varieties at both the phonological and the morphological level. The claim also includes testimonies of a large migration from Cotopaxi to Pijal {{at the beginning of the}} 20th century, which can be seen in the many Cotopaxi surnames in community.Most researchers agree, however, that Media Lengua developed linguistically through various processes of lexification (relexification, adlexification and translexification) in a relatively short period of time.|$|E

40|$|The {{educational}} {{situation of}} the Roma children in Poland is improving gradually. At present opportunities for financing various educational and cultural activities in Poland, created mostly by the Governmental Program for the Roma Community, are incomparably better than several years ago. There is, however, no debate about the model of education for the Gypsy children. Education in regular schools, advocated by {{the vast majority of}} Romani activists, raises the level of Roma education, but, on the other hand, it may bring very harmful outcomes. Roma children learn in such schools neither Romani language, nor history, and the language they speak undergoes rapid polonization. Books published in Romani in Poland are very rare. Moreover, the idea of introducing Romani to the school curricula is met with anger by more traditional Gypsies. In spite of that, however, it is necessary to have Romani language and history taught in schools if we want the language and culture of the Roma who live in Poland to survive.

Although airplanes are generally designed so that the propeller nsiz lies approximately in the direction of normal steady flight, the condition of yaw is found during such maneuvers as curved flight and in flight at high angle of attack. These maneuvers are usually of short durntion and, while the effect of yaw- from these causes may be, in apeciticoases, of interest, it is possibly of no great consequence. If, however, propellers are to be yawed in the steady-flight condition, the effects of yaw mny be important. Such a condition would arise in the case that a wing engine is placed, for struo-tuml or other reasons, with its axis at an angle to the longitudinal axis of the plane. Air propellers in yaw {{have been the subject of}} both theoretical and experimental invcatigation (references 1 to 6) but further information concerning the quanti-tative effect of 6 malIangles of yam upon thrust, power, cross-wind force, and efficiency seemed desirable and therefore the present study ma undertaken. While the study was made with the propeller axis in the hori-zontal plane and the angle between the propeller axis and the wind direction is thus called an angle of yaw, the results may be applied as well to angles of pitch Bincesuch body interference as was present would have been the s~me in either case.

40|$|A polemics with Michael Stewart’s article Remembering without commemoration: the {{mnemonics}} {{and politics}} of Holocaust memories among European Roma, „Journal of Royal Anthropological Institute” nr 10, 2004) In the recent years the traditional approach to Roma as „people without history and memory” has been challenged, among others, by a new perspective that assumes that even if Roma do not consciously reflect upon their past, the past is „remembered” for them {{due to the fact}} that it is in a way „stored” or „embedded” in the nature of the relations between Roma and non-Roma. Such an „implicit memory” approach, represented by Michael Stewart, means a step forward since it has assumed a more sophisticated concept of social memory. Nevertheless, it shares with the older approach the essentialized concept of Roma identity. With a help of Lech Mroz’s conception of Romani „non-memory that does not mean forgetting”, I am developing my criticism of Stewart’s argument as (1) treating the Roma as a passive and static group formed by external determinants; (2) homogenizing the diversity of Romani life; (3) presenting a monolithic picture of the non-Roma world; (4) seeing a firm borderline between Roma and non-Roma while we should rather speak here of a liminal frontier zone; (5) neglecting the actual cases of active remembrance among Roma, supported by Romani commemorative ceremonies. In the end, I am suggesting that in contemporary „postmodern condition” the Romani practices of memory and identity do not radically differ from the non-Romani ones, especially those influenced by traumatic historical experience.

40|$|The double {{exclusion}} and discrimination of Roma women concerns of all European Roma communities. The {{reasons for this}} lie in the issues of ethnic and gender equality issues. Discrimination and exclusion manifests itself {{in all areas of}} life. The situation of Roma women is worse than Roma men as well as women worse than mainstream European society. Roma Framework Strategy of the European Union insufficiently focused on their specific situation. Specifically refer to the other documents, but they are not binding, although delimit the future direction of the EU changes. The approach of the EU institutions presents to the Roma women in selected legislative documents allows to create an overall picture of this for which assistance from the EU, they can count on. Its scope covers many important aspects of Romani women. But this is not enough to help to fully remedy their {{exclusion and}} discrimination. As a complement to the problems perceived by the EU institutions should also take into account the fact that each external evaluation of cultural policies is always fraught with error transferring your own values. In addition, a major problem is the discrimination faced by Roma women from mainstream society and institutions. Therefore, a significant change and improvement in their situation depends on many factors. Undoubtedly very important are those that are associated with the cultural determinants of the Roma minority. However, do not underestimate the effort which must make the EU’s institutional system and society of Europe to reduce their level of exclusion and discrimination.
