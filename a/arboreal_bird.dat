50|$|An <b>arboreal</b> <b>bird,</b> the Ecuadorian cacique usually feeds alone but {{sometimes}} pairs of birds or small family groups move together through the tree canopy. It often visits flowering and fruiting trees and {{can sometimes be}} seen probing the petioles of Cecropia trees. Its diet is mainly insects such as ants, beetles and caterpillars, as well as fruit and possibly nectar.|$|E
50|$|The Réunion cuckooshrike {{is a small}} <b>arboreal</b> <b>bird.</b> The plumage is dimorphic {{between the}} sexes. The male is grey {{coloured}} with a darker back and lighter underside; the face is darker and has {{the impression of a}} mask. The female is quite different, being dark brown above and striped underneath with a white eye-line. The call of the species is a clear whistled tui tui tui, from which is derived its local Réunion Creole/French name, tuit-tuit.|$|E
50|$|The pygmy batis is an active, <b>arboreal</b> <b>bird</b> which {{lives in}} pairs or small family groups. Its habits are {{considered}} to be likely to be similar to other savannah batises. They feed mainly within the foliage and glean most of their insect prey from leaves and twigs, with a small proportion taken on the wing. It will join other bird species in mixed foraging parties. The breeding biology is almost unknown but egg laying probably occurs in February and March.|$|E

50|$|Nine {{families}} of largely <b>arboreal</b> <b>birds</b> {{make up the}} order Piciformes, the best-known of them being the Picidae, which includes the woodpeckers and close relatives. The Piciformes contain about 71 living genera with a little over 450 species, of which the Picidae (woodpeckers and relatives) make up about half.|$|R
50|$|The Barrow's {{goldeneye}} {{is considered}} an <b>arboreal</b> <b>bird</b> species because much of its nesting is done in cavities found in mature trees. The birds will also nest in burrows or protected sites on the ground. Barrow's goldeneyes tend not to share habitat with the much more numerous common goldeneye. Barrow's goldeneye tend to be territorial towards other birds venturing into their domain. This is especially true among the drakes. Confrontations may occur {{in the form of}} fighting. Drakes often do a form of territorial display along the boundaries of their territory. This is both true on land and in the water. These territorial displays average about 6 minutes in length and often trigger other males to perform their own show.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we report the {{discovery}} of non-plumage soft tissues in Confuciusornis, a basal beaked bird from the Early Cretaceous Jehol Biota in northeastern China. Various soft tissues are visualized and interpreted {{through the use of}} laser-stimulated fluorescence, providing much novel anatomical information about this early bird, specifically reticulate scales covering the feet, and the well-developed and robust pro- and postpatagium. We also include a direct comparison between the forelimb soft tissues of Confuciusornis and modern avian patagia. Furthermore, apparently large, fleshy phalangeal pads are preserved on the feet. The reticulate scales, robust phalangeal pads as well as the highly recurved pedal claws strongly support Confuciusornis as an <b>arboreal</b> <b>bird.</b> Reticulate scales are more rounded than scutate scales and do not overlap, thus allowing for more flexibility in the toe. The extent of the pro- and postpatagium and the robust primary feather rachises are evidence that Confuciusornis was capable of powered flight, contrary to previous reports suggesting otherwise. A unique avian wing shape is also reconstructed based on plumage preserved. These soft tissues combined indicate an <b>arboreal</b> <b>bird</b> with the capacity for short-term (non-migratory) flight, and suggest that, although primitive, Confuciusornis already possessed many relatively advanced avian anatomical characteristics...|$|E

We examined the effect of variation in habitat structural complexity on the predatory success of the semi-arboreal gray rat snake (Elaphe obsoleta spiloides) foraging for <b>arboreal</b> <b>bird</b> nest contents. Individual snakes searched for nests in enclosures containing one of five levels of vegetation density that reflected the range of structural complexity measured at a field site where predator and prey species are common. Subjects were most proficient at locating prey in enclosures having low levels of structural complexity, and experienced decreased predatory success in barren or highly-complex habitats.

40|$|Abstract: An {{incomplete}} postcranial avian skeleton {{is described}} from the Lower Cretaceous Jingchuan Formation of Otog Banner of western Inner Mongolia {{and referred to}} a new species of Cufhuyornis, C. chabuensis sp. nov. This is the first report of a Cathayornis from outside Liaoning Province. The new discovery indicates that Cafhayornis coexisted with Ofogornis genghisi, and a more detailed comparison between these two enantiornithine genera shows that Otogornis represents a more primitive genus than Cuthayornis. Our analyses further indicate that Cuthayomis is a n <b>arboreal</b> <b>bird.</b> The discovery of a Cufhuyornis from this region also confirms that the avian fossil-bearing Jingchuan Formation {{is comparable to the}} Jiufotang Formation of the upper Jehol Group in western Liaoning, and should be referred to the middle-late Early Cretaceous...|$|E
40|$|The {{tree species}} {{preferences}} by six <b>arboreal</b> <b>bird</b> species {{and their role}} in structuring the bird communities in woodland were investigated in two sites in County Durham. Each bird species showed a preference or avoidance {{for most of the}} tree species in both study sites. The patterns of tree preference were different for each bird species, and were the basis for efficient partitioning of the foraging niches in woodland. Bird species showed significantly less overlap in tree species choice than in any of the other four niche dimensions examined, making it the most important dimension of the foraging niche. The tree species preferences of the bird species were reflected in the distribution of the birds within the woods. For each pair of bird species the degree of similarity in tree species choice and birds' distribution in the wood were identical. Bird species richness was predictable from tree species richness. There were significant positive correlations between all pairs of the following factors: bird species diversity, tree species diversity, bird species richness, tree species richness, bird density, and the percentage of broadleaved trees. Bird density was negatively correlated with the size of the wood (or compartment), apparently due to an edge effect. Seasonal and year to year changes in the tree preference by birds were explicable in terms of changes in the relative abundance of arthropod prey and other foods available in the trees...|$|E

50|$|Musophagids are {{medium-sized}} <b>arboreal</b> <b>birds</b> {{endemic to}} sub-Saharan Africa, {{where they live}} in forests, woodland and savanna. Their flight is weak, but they run quickly through the tree canopy. They feed mostly on fruits {{and to a lesser}} extent on leaves, buds, and flowers, occasionally taking small insects, snails, and slugs. As their name suggests, turacos enjoy bananas and can become so tame as to be hand-fed. They are also partial to grapes and pawpaw (papaya).|$|R
50|$|Recent {{ecological}} {{studies have}} found the mistletoe producing a rich biodiversity in areas where it proliferates. The litter-fall under mistletoe infestation, {{where there is a}} high turnover of rich mistletoe leaves, has a diverse animal and plant life. Also, the denseness of the mistletoe bush and the characteristics of its leaves makes it a cool and safe place for birds to rest, hide and nest. In a recent study in Southern Australia, 217 species of Australian <b>arboreal</b> <b>birds</b> were reported nesting in mistletoe, including the mistletoebird.|$|R
50|$|Pigeons and doves are {{parasitised}} by {{two major}} groups of lice; wing lice and body lice. Most birds are host to both groups, which eat the downy parts of feathers that {{are close to}} the body. Body lice {{have been found to be}} more likely to be host specific than wing lice, possibly due to their host ecology where terrestrial pigeons feeding on the ground may create an easier transfer of lice and therefore be more likely to carry host specific body lice than <b>arboreal</b> <b>birds.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Overall the cuckooshrikes are {{medium to}} small <b>arboreal</b> <b>birds,</b> {{generally}} long and slender. The smallest species {{is the small}} minivet at 16 cm and 6 - 12 g, while the largest is the south Melanesian cuckooshrike at 35 cm and 180 g. They are predominantly greyish with white and black, although the minivets are brightly coloured in red, yellow and black, and the blue cuckooshrike of central Africa is all-over glossy blue. The four cuckooshrikes in the genus Campephaga exhibit sexual dimorphism, with males that have glossy black plumage and bright red or yellow wattles, the females having more subdued olive-green plumage. [...] The genus Coracina is not monophyletic.|$|R
5|$|As the long-tailed {{ground roller}} is remarkably silent and {{difficult}} to see during the non-breeding season, the local inhabitants of Madagascar once believed that this bird hibernated in its burrows. While not particularly tasty, this species is hunted for food due to its large size and the relative ease of capture compared with <b>arboreal</b> <b>birds.</b> In the early twentieth century, it was hunted by herdsmen with blowguns. In the 1950s and 1960s, natives trapped this ground roller and dug out its nesting burrows. This bird has been featured on several of Madagascar's stamps.

50|$|Both {{species of}} painted berrypecker are endemic {{to the islands}} of New Guinea, one of two {{families}} to be restricted to the island (the other being the berrypeckers and longbills). Both species are restricted to montane areas, usually above 2200 m, though the tit berrypecker does occur as far down as 850 on occasions, and that species has a generally lower distribution than the crested berrypecker. Both species are <b>arboreal</b> <b>birds</b> of montane forest, particularly mossy forest. At higher altitudes the crested berrypecker will also inhabit stunted alpine forest and alpine thickets. It is unknown if the two species make any migratory movements, {{although it has been}} suggested that the tit berrypecker may be partly nomadic.|$|R

50|$|These are <b>arboreal</b> <b>birds</b> that {{breed in}} {{northern}} forests (Witmer and Avery 2003). Their main food is fruit, which they eat from early summer (strawberries, mulberries, and serviceberries) through {{late summer and}} fall (raspberries, blackberries, cherries, and honeysuckle berries) into late fall and winter (juniper berries, grapes, crabapples, mountain-ash fruits, rose hips, cotoneaster fruits, dogwood berries, and mistletoe berries) (MacKinnon and Phillipps 2000, Witmer and Avery 2003). They pluck fruit from a perch or occasionally while hovering. In spring they replace fruit with sap, buds, and flowers. In the warmer {{part of the year}} they catch many insects by gleaning or in midair, and often nest near water where flying insects are abundant.|$|R

The pririt and pygmy batis survive in very arid environments with some cover, and the white-fronted wattle-eye favours mangrove forests in Angola. Many species in the family have adapted to human-altered habitats. The family has its highest diversity at equatorial latitudes, with half the known species native to Tanzania and almost half also ranging into the DRC and Kenya.|$|R
