The value of the relaxation time varies by cluster, but the mean value is on the order of 109 years.|$|E

40|$|This paper aims {{to explore}} the role of spillovers in the {{strategic}} choice for a MNE in a duopoly model, especially focusing on endogenous FDI spillovers with spillover-prevention costs. After discussing the exogenous spillover case, this paper shows that with a quadratic spillover-prevention cost function, the FDI-performing firm may choose a positive level of spillovers, which {{is lower than the}} exogenous level, and also shows the determinants of such optimal spillovers and how endogenizing spillovers affect the home firm’s decision on plant location. As extensions of the model, this paper explores a n FDI-performing firm case and a m-foreign firm case separately, and shows that <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> home firms goes infinity, the cutoff value of trade cost converges to that with exogenous spillovers. On the other hand, this paper shows that <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> foreign firms goes infinity, the cutoff value of trade cost can be either larger or smaller than that with exogenous spillovers...|$|R

The recent devaluation of the British pound had already triggered a financial crisis, and there was concern about how the markets would react to the news. Oppenheimer and Bacher saw the evidence of a nuclear test as conclusive, and Bacher in particular came down strongly {{on the side of}} making a public announcement, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> people who already knew made a leak almost inevitable.

5|$|As {{the houses}} in the Ghetto age, and <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> {{students}} wishing {{to live in the}} Ghetto expands, the university has begun a renovation and replacement program with the goal of keeping the current feel of the area intact. In 2000, construction began on several new duplexes to fill land that was unused, resulting in housing for several dozen additional students. The duplexes housed six students per side, for a total of 12 students each. In 2003, the university continued the project by tearing down several houses on Stonemill Road and replacing them with a new five-person design. Several more of these houses have now been built throughout the Ghetto.|$|E

Soegijapranata worked to ensure that the seminary would continue to produce new pastors and appointed the recently ordained Father Hardjawasita as its rector.
