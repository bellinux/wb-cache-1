40|$|Before 1950, {{history of}} science did not exist <b>as</b> <b>an</b> {{independent}} <b>academic</b> branch, but was instead pursued by practitioners across various humanities and scientific disciplines.

This essay outlines the development of {{history of science}} <b>as</b> <b>an</b> interdisciplinary <b>academic</b> field, and argues that it constitutes an obvious choice for inclusion in <b>an</b> interdisciplinary <b>academic</b> program, provided faculty and administrators learn how best to manage its advantages and pitfalls...|$|R

5|$|James E. Boyd, who {{had assumed}} the vice chancellorship of the University System of Georgia the {{previous}} month, was appointed Acting President of Georgia Tech by Chancellor George L.

The chancellor hoped this combination would help resolve a brewing controversy over whether the EES should be integrated into Georgia Tech's academic units to improve both entities' competitiveness for federal money.|$|E

5|$|On September 16, 1891, University Hall, the school's first brick {{building}}, {{caught on}} fire.

Additionally, a square tower was also built on top in lieu of the original cupola which included a school bell. From its construction until 1987, Waller Hall was used <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>academic</b> hall and hosted classes along with housing the school's chapel and as offices for the faculty.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{especially}} {{due to the}} vernacular language used, this work was largely neglected among the Greek scholars, especially by Adamantios Korais and Dimitrios Katartzis, and was never used <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>academic</b> work, or even as a school textbook. It was also negatively received by the Church hierarchy, as well as conservative Greek scholars, due to the vernacular language it used and the liberal views it expressed. It {{is worth noting that}} the work’s linguistic form disappointed even Dimitrios Katartzis, the intellectual mentor of the two authors, while Philippidis himself, never used such vernacular style language again in his future works. However, Geographia Neoteriki inspired a number of similar geographical works published in Greece during the 19th century.|$|E
