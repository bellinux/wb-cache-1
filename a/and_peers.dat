40|$|The goal of {{the current}} study was to {{investigate}} whether <b>peer</b> rejection <b>and</b> <b>peer</b> victimization mediated the relation between children’s aggressive behaviors and depressive symptoms. Participants were 533 fourth- and fifth-grade children (289 girls and 244 boys). Data on aggression <b>and</b> <b>peer</b> victimization were collected through teacher <b>and</b> <b>peer</b> report, whereas data on depressive symptoms were collected through self-, teacher, <b>and</b> <b>peer</b> report. Peer rejection was measured through peer nominations of liking and disliking. Through testing two competing concurrent structural models, results revealed that <b>peer</b> rejection <b>and</b> <b>peer</b> victimization jointly mediated the overall relation between aggression and depressive symptoms, although this mediation was only partial. Furthermore, peer rejection partially mediated the relation between aggression <b>and</b> <b>peer</b> victimization, <b>and</b> <b>peer</b> victimization partially mediated the relation between <b>peer</b> rejection <b>and</b> depressive symptoms.

Second, we examined {{the construct validity of}} justice climate <b>and</b> <b>peer</b> justice as two different factor structures. Third, we tested the hierarchical structure of justice climate <b>and</b> <b>peer</b> justice as second-order factors. Finally, we examined the predictive validity of second-order factors justice climate <b>and</b> <b>peer</b> justice within a nomological network composed of reciprocity with the supervisor and reciprocity with coworkers.

5|$|There are {{a number}} of {{different}} measures of adult attachment, the most common being self-report questionnaires and coded interviews based on the Adult Attachment Interview. The various measures were developed primarily as research tools, for different purposes and addressing different domains, for example romantic relationships, parental relationships or peer relationships. Some classify an adult's state of mind with respect to attachment and attachment patterns by reference to childhood experiences, while others assess relationship behaviours and security regarding parents <b>and</b> <b>peers.</b>|$|E
5|$|Critics in the 1990s such as J. R. Harris, Steven Pinker and Jerome Kagan were {{generally}} {{concerned with the}} concept of infant determinism (nature versus nurture), stressing the effects of later experience on personality. Building on the work on temperament of Stella Chess, Kagan rejected almost every assumption on which attachment theory's cause was based. Kagan argued that heredity was far more important than the transient developmental effects of early environment. For example, a child with an inherently difficult temperament would not elicit sensitive behavioural responses from a caregiver. The debate spawned considerable research and analysis of data from the growing number of longitudinal studies. Subsequent research has not borne out Kagan's argument, possibly suggesting that it is the caregiver's behaviours that form the child's attachment style, although how this style is expressed may differ with the child's temperament. Harris and Pinker put forward the notion that the influence of parents had been much exaggerated, arguing that socialization took place primarily in peer groups. H. Rudolph Schaffer concluded that parents <b>and</b> <b>peers</b> had different functions, fulfilling distinctive roles in children's development.|$|E

40|$|This paper explores an {{application}} of an online tool SPARKPLUS (Self <b>and</b> <b>Peer</b> Assessment Resource Kit) for the self <b>and</b> <b>peer</b> assessment on the group-based Honours’ research projects. The Honours’ research projects in School of Civil, Environmental Engineering at University of Adelaide are running in {{a small group of}} students (typically four students or less) working with an academic supervisor in a selected area for one year. Since the research project is self-directed study, {{it is very difficult to}} fairly assess the contribution of individual students to the group-based research project. The paper-based method of self <b>and</b> <b>peer</b> assessment for the Honour’s research projects was used in the previous years. The same mark was often distributed and no feedback was given. Both the students and academic staff were not satisfied with the paper-based method of self <b>and</b> <b>peer</b> assessment. Thus an online tool SPARK PLUS together with a set of assessment criteria was used for the self <b>and</b> <b>peer</b> assessment of the Honours’ research projects in 2010. Thirty-seven groups participated in the self <b>and</b> <b>peer</b> assessment of using SPARK PLUS in semester one 2010 and a series of results from the online self <b>and</b> <b>peer</b> assessment were obtained and analysed.

Growth curve modeling was used to estimate changes in substance use and sexual risk across adolescence and test their association with parent <b>and</b> <b>peer</b> factors. Parent <b>and</b> <b>peer</b> risk factors were strongly associated with increasing substance use as youth aged. Substance use and condom use were interrelated.

5|$|While {{humans have}} the ability to learn any language, they only do so if they grow up in an {{environment}} in which language exists and is used by others. Language is therefore dependent on communities of speakers in which children learn language from their elders <b>and</b> <b>peers</b> and themselves transmit language to their own children. Languages are used by those who speak them to communicate and to solve a plethora of social tasks. Many aspects of language use can be seen to be adapted specifically to these purposes. Due {{to the way in which}} language is transmitted between generations and within communities, language perpetually changes, diversifying into new languages or converging due to language contact. The process is similar to the process of evolution, where the process of descent with modification leads to the formation of a phylogenetic tree.|$|E
5|$|Further {{excavations}} were {{undertaken in}} the 1920s by C. R. Peers, who found that the nave of the original church had external doors on the north, south and west sides, and that the chancel had doors leading into {{the north and south}} porticus, which in turn had external doors on their eastern sides. Regarding the floor described by Dowker, Peers noted that the surface consisted of a thin layer of pounded brick, and believed that it was of the same date as the stone which Dowker described as the foundations for the stone cross. Excavations also revealed steps leading down to the burial vault reported by Dowker, although Peers did not refer to either the steps or the vault in his report. Extensions of the porticus to the west and around the original west front were dated to no more than 100years after the church was first built, <b>and</b> <b>Peers</b> observed that these extensions had been given the same type of floor as the original church. Drawing comparisons with the 7th-century chapel of St Peter-on-the-Wall at Bradwell-on-Sea, in Essex, and the abbey of St Augustine at Canterbury, Peers suggested that the original church at Reculver probably had windows set high in the northern and southern walls of the nave. Areas of wall found by archaeologists but now missing above ground are marked on the site by strips of concrete edged with flint.|$|E

40|$|Benchmarking <b>and</b> <b>peer</b> review are {{essential}} elements of the so-called EU open method of coordination (OMC) which has been contested in the literature for lack of effectiveness. In this paper we compare benchmarking <b>and</b> <b>peer</b> review procedures as used by the EU with those used by the OECD. Different types of benchmarking <b>and</b> <b>peer</b> review are distinguished and pitfalls for (international) benchmarking are discussed. We find that the OECD has a clear single objective for its benchmarking <b>and</b> <b>peer</b> review activities (i. e. horizontal policy transfers) whereas the EU suffers from a mix of objectives (a. horizontal policy learning; b. EU wide vertical policy coordination and c. multilateral monitoring and surveillance {{under the shadow of}} hierarchy). Whereas the OECD is able to skirt around most of the benchmarking pitfalls, {{this is not the case}} for the EU. It is argued that, rather than continue working with the panacea OMC benchmarking <b>and</b> <b>peer</b> review currently represents, EU benchmarking should take a number of more distinct shapes in order to improve effectiveness. Moreover, in some areas benchmarking <b>and</b> <b>peer</b> review are not sufficient coordination tools, and are at best additional to those means of coordination that include enforceable sanctions...|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 73 - 83). Feedback plays {{a central}} role in writing development. The immense studies conducted on the effectiveness of teacher feedback <b>and</b> <b>peer</b> feedback have resulted in inconsistent findings. While some found that teacher <b>and</b> <b>peer</b> feedback were futile and induced little revision, others found that they did enhance students’ writing skills. This research project reported on the study of the effect of teacher <b>and</b> <b>peer</b> feedback in writing among 10 th grade secondary L 2 students in one private school in Lebanon. Moreover, it examined students’ perception toward teacher <b>and</b> <b>peer</b> feedback. Both quantitative and qualitative data were obtained and triangulated.

40|$|Previous {{investigations}} of the longitudinal outcomes of childhood aggression, social withdrawal and likeability have relied on the reports of a single observer, or combined the results of several observers in the prediction of adult outcomes. By comparing self <b>and</b> <b>peer</b> perceptions of childhood behaviour, the present studies proposed to clarify {{the nature of the}} relation between childhood behaviours and adult outcomes. Four questions were examined being (1) how were childhood behaviour patterns related to adult outcomes; (2) how did self <b>and</b> <b>peer</b> perceptions compare in the prediction of adult outcomes; (3) was the relation between self <b>and</b> <b>peer</b> perspectives additive in the prediction of these outcomes; and (4) did concordance between self <b>and</b> <b>peer</b> perspectives predict adult outcomes? Data from the Concordia Risk Project were employed to determine the socioeconomic, personality, and substance abuse outcomes. Both self <b>and</b> <b>peer</b> perceptions of childhood behaviour were associated with adult outcomes, although generally, self perceptions as opposed to peer perceptions of childhood behaviours were more strongly associated with adult outcomes in women. Including both self <b>and</b> <b>peer</b> perceptions did not have an additive effect in the prediction of adult outcomes, although there was some support for the importance of concordance in education and income outcomes. The findings suggest that self <b>and</b> <b>peer</b> perceptions of childhood behaviour each provide some unique information. Future research examining the adult outcomes of childhood behaviours may wish to consider both the gender and the behaviour being examined in designing prospective, longitudinal studies...|$|R
