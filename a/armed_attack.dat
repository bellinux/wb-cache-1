5|$|Norway has {{a unified}} police, {{which means that}} there is a single police {{organization}} and that police power and prosecutor power is not granted to other agencies within Norway. The sole exception is the military police, albeit which only has jurisdiction over military personnel and on military installations, except during martial law. The police are decentralized and generalized to allow a more flexible resource allocation, while remaining under political control. This entails that police officers have no geographical or sector limitations to their powers. The Police Act and several special laws regulate the agencies and the officer's powers and responsibilities. The police are required to assist other public institutions, including the healthcare authorities, and can be asked by other agencies to assist when it is necessary to enact a decision by force. Conversely, the police can ask for assistance from the Coast Guard when necessary. The police are responsible for all responses against terrorism and sabotage unless Norway is under <b>armed</b> <b>attack.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Moncada Barracks was a {{military}} barracks in Santiago de Cuba, named after the General Guillermón Moncada, a hero of the War of Independence. On July 26, 1953, the barracks {{was the site of}} an <b>armed</b> <b>attack</b> by a small group of revolutionaries led by Fidel Castro. This <b>armed</b> <b>attack</b> is widely accepted as the beginning of the Cuban Revolution. The date on which the attack took place, July 26, was adopted by Castro as the name for his revolutionary movement (Movimiento 26 Julio or M 26-7) which eventually toppled the dictatorship of Fulgencio Batista on January 12th 1959.|$|E

25|$|As prime minister, Obote was {{implicated in}} a gold {{smuggling}} plot, together with Idi Amin, then deputy {{commander of the}} Ugandan armed forces. When the Parliament demanded an investigation of Obote and the ousting of Amin, he suspended the constitution and declared himself President in March 1966, allocating to himself almost unlimited power under state of emergency rulings. Several members of his cabinet, who were leaders of rival factions in the party, were arrested and detained without charge. Obote responded with an <b>armed</b> <b>attack</b> upon Mutesa's palace, which ended with Mutesa fleeing to exile. In 1967, Obote's power was cemented when the parliament passed a new constitution that abolished the federal structure of the independence constitution and created an executive presidency.|$|E
25|$|The initial design (then {{known as}} the Westland WG.13) was started in the mid-1960s as a {{replacement}} for the Westland Scout and Wasp, and a more advanced alternative to the UH-1 Iroquois. The design was to be powered by a pair of Bristol Siddeley BS.360 turboshaft engines. As part of the Anglo-French helicopter agreement signed in February 1967, the French company Aérospatiale were given a 30 per cent production work share in the programme, Westland performing the remainder. It was intended that France would procure the Lynx for its Navy and of a heavily modified armed reconnaissance variant for the French Army, with the United Kingdom in return buying Aérospatiale Gazelle and Puma for its armed forces. In October 1969, the French Army cancelled its requirement for the Lynx, thus development work of the dedicated <b>armed</b> <b>attack</b> variant was terminated early on.|$|E
25|$|As part of {{the growing}} {{political}} polarisation in Turkish politics, the election was marred by politically motivated acts of violence against party activists, candidates, vehicles and campaign offices. On 17 and 18 May, bombs exploded at the electoral rallies of the Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP) in Adana and Mersin, injuring three people, with the HDP accusing the government of being behind the attacks. HDP rallies and offices have also been subject to violence from Turkish nationalists, with HDP chairman Selahattin Demirtaş claiming that 41 HDP election offices had been subject to arson attacks since the party's establishment. Both AKP and CHP offices in İstanbul were subject to an <b>armed</b> <b>attack</b> before the election, while what {{was described as a}} 'lynching attempt' took place in Trabzon when AKP activists chased and threw stones at a CHP van for over an hour.|$|E

25|$|The Lynx {{features}} a two-man cockpit {{for a pilot}} and observer sitting side by side; the British Army typically operates their fleet with a three-man crew, a door gunner being the third member. The cabin, located behind the cockpit, is accessed through a pair of large sliding doors {{on each side of}} the fuselage; it can accommodate up to ten equipped troops depending upon seating configuration. An alternative configuration houses radio equipment in the cabin area when the aircraft is being used in the airborne command post role; the cabin can also be used to house additional fuel tanks for conducting long distance missions and ferry trips. The Lynx can perform a wide variety of mission types, including anti-submarine and anti-surface warfare, vessel replenishment, search and rescue, airborne reconnaissance, <b>armed</b> <b>attack,</b> casualty evacuation and troop transport; according to AgustaWestland, a Lynx can be converted from one mission-type to another within the space of 40 minutes.|$|E
25|$|In September 1695, English pirate Henry Every perpetrated one of {{the most}} {{profitable}} pirate raids in history with his capture of a Grand Mughal convoy near Surat. The Indian ships had been returning home from their annual pilgrimage to Mecca when the pirates struck, capturing the Ganj-i-Sawai, reportedly the greatest ship in the Muslim fleet, and its escorts in the process. When news of the piracy reached the mainland, a livid Aurangzeb nearly ordered an <b>armed</b> <b>attack</b> against the English-governed city of Bombay, though he finally agreed to compromise after the East India Company promised to pay financial reparations, estimated at £600,000 by the Mughal authorities. Meanwhile, Aurangzeb shut down four of the East India Company's factories, imprisoned the workers and captains (who were nearly lynched by a rioting mob), and threatened {{to put an end to}} all English trading in India until Every was captured. The Privy Council and East India Company offered a massive bounty for Every's apprehension, leading to the first worldwide manhunt in recorded history. However, Every successfully eluded capture.|$|E
25|$|The plunder of Emperor Aurangzeb's {{treasure}} {{ship had}} serious {{consequences for the}} English, coming {{at a time of}} crisis for the East India Company, whose profits were still recovering from the disastrous Child's War. The Company had seen its total annual imports drop from a peak of £800,000 in 1684, to just £30,000 in 1695, and Every's attack now threatened the very existence of English trade in India. When the damaged Ganj-i-sawai finally limped its way back to harbor in Surat, news of the pirates' attack on the pilgrims—a sacrilegious act that, like the raping of the Muslim women, was considered an unforgivable violation of the Hajj—spread quickly. The local Indian governor, Itimad Khan, immediately arrested the English subjects in Surat and kept them under close watch, partly as a punishment for their countrymen's depredations and partly for their own protection from the rioting locals. A livid Aurangzeb quickly closed four of the company's factories in India and imprisoned the officers, nearly ordering an <b>armed</b> <b>attack</b> against the English city of Bombay with the goal of forever expelling the English from India.|$|E
5000|$|In September 1995, survey {{participants}} were asked whether they supported, opposed or had no opinion with regard to [...] "armed attacks against Israeli army targets," [...] "armed attacks against Israeli settlers," [...] and [...] "armed attacks against Israeli civilian targets." [...] The majority supported the use of <b>armed</b> <b>attacks</b> against Israeli military targets and settlers in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Support crossed all party lines and groups, and was highest among the Islamic opposition (91% and 84%) and the leftists (90% and 89%), though a significant majority of those who supported the peace process also supported <b>armed</b> <b>attacks</b> on military targets and settlers (69% and 73%). To explain the apparent paradox in the latter position, Abusada quotes Shikaki (1996) who, [...] "contends that Palestinian support {{for the use of}} <b>armed</b> <b>attacks</b> against Israeli military targets and settlers does not indicate 'opposition to the peace process but Palestinian insistence that the process entails an end to occupation and settlements.'" [...] Palestinian support for <b>armed</b> <b>attacks</b> against Israeli civilian targets in Israel was 20% overall, with support being highest among those affiliated with the Islamic opposition (42%) and the leftists (32%), and lowest among supporters of the peace process (12%) and the National Independents (10%).|$|R

40|$|Use {{of force}} {{is one of}} the {{principles}} of international law wh ich has been banned by the UN Charter and modern constitutions. However, since the enforcement of the UN Charter, self-defense has become the preferred excuse for states to justify their use of force. But applying self-defense requires some conditions. Immediacy {{is one of the}} important conditions of self-defense. Immediacy defined as the time span between <b>armed</b> <b>attacks</b> and reaction to it, is the main discourse. This condition requires self defense immediately after the armed conflict or during a rational time span since its occurance. In this respect, the emerging Karabakh Conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan in the 1990 s is important. After Armenia’s <b>armed</b> <b>attacks,</b> Azerbaijan has acted within the scope of legitimate self-defense. But in accordance with UN Security Council cease-fire resolution Azerbaijan has suspended its self-defense actions. However, today, still twenty percent of Azerbaijani territory is still under Armenian occupation. Accordingly, after a long time the validity of Azerbaijan’s right to legitimate self-defense is still subject to arguments. In this article, by comparing two different approaches (strict and board interpretation approaches) on the temporal link between the measures of self-defense and the <b>armed</b> <b>attacks</b> (immediacy), the temporal link between the self-defense countermeasures of Azerbaijan and <b>armed</b> <b>attacks</b> by Armenia in Karabakh Conflict will be examined. </p...|$|R
