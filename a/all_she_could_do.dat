2500|$|Charlotte Rae {{initially}} reduced {{her role}} in seasons six and seven, and later {{decided to leave the}} series altogether, believing she had done <b>all</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> with her character and desired to move on to other projects. In season eight's heavily promoted one-hour premiere, [...] "Out of Peekskill" [...] Mrs. Garrett married the man of her dreams and joined him in Africa while he worked for the Peace Corps. Mrs. Garrett convinces her sister, Beverly Ann Stickle (Cloris Leachman), to take over the shop and look after the girls. Beverly Ann later legally adopted Over Our Heads worker Andy Moffett (Mackenzie Astin) in the episode [...] "A Boy About the House". Describing the new changes to The Facts of Life Brandon Tartikoff, NBC Entertainment President, said he [...] "was surprised that The Facts of Life performed well this season, as, with a major cast change and all, I thought it might not perform as it had in the past. Facts has been renewed for next season." ...|$|E
60|$|So <b>all</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> was {{to accept}} the hopeless task set her, and make her guesses and abide by the result.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Much more {{smoothly}} than a live horse,' Alice said, {{with a little}} scream of laughter, in spite of <b>all</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> to prevent it.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>could</b> teach dancing--but <b>she</b> couldn't dance {{particularly}} well. And {{that was}} <b>all</b> that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>do.</b>|$|R
6000|$|<b>All</b> that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> was {{to point}} tearfully at the baby, now wailing piteously in her arms, and repeat over and over, [...] "Fever--fever--fever." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{was killed}} on the spot," [...] said Ethel, {{speaking}} shortly, and abruptly. If she was to say it at <b>all,</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>do</b> so otherwise.|$|R
6000|$|It was <b>all</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> to hold in; and {{her eyes}} snapped, and her fingers worked like she wanted to scratch him; and she says: ...|$|E
60|$|In {{the days}} of her health and strength, she would have set him at defiance. <b>All</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> now was to appeal to his mercy.|$|E
60|$|<b>All</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> in {{the matter}} was that which she had already done at Bessie's bedside, and much more fully than when the little girl was {{listening}} to her.|$|E
60|$|A {{thought came}} to her, and she sprang towards the bulwark; {{but they were}} {{watching}} and held her, so that <b>all</b> that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> was to throw up her arms in token.|$|R
60|$|He {{came to her}} {{and took}} her hand and set it to his lips, and <b>all</b> that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> was to gaze with her great, dark eyes upon the hero of whom she had heard so many talk; the {{favorite}} of the Emperor; the wise young Otto of the Silver Hand.|$|R
60|$|For {{the time}} that these simple {{preparations}} of welcome endured, Elspat {{was in a state}} of troubled happiness. In fact, her only anxiety was that she might be able to complete <b>all</b> that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> to welcome Hamish and the friends who she supposed must have attached themselves to his band, before they should arrive and find her unprovided for their reception.|$|R
60|$|But it was {{not long}} before she found that it was {{impossible}} to turn his thoughts from that all-absorbing subject. <b>All</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> was to endeavor to guide them into quiet channels.|$|E
60|$|He {{did not try}} to talk {{any more}} to her, and when they reached the Pagoda, <b>all</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> was to hurry up stairs, and, {{throwing}} off her bonnet, bury her face in the pillow.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, you born fool!" [...] She {{took up the}} {{spinning}} stick, {{and it looked like}} it was <b>all</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> to keep from giving him a crack with it. [...] "What made you think I'd like it?" ...|$|E
60|$|All {{that was}} wise and gentle {{that she had}} {{intended}} to say, all that her clear intellect and experience had taught her, died upon her lips with that kiss. And <b>all</b> that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> of womanly dignity and high-bred decorum was to tuck her small feet under her chair, in the desperate attempt to lengthen her short skirt, and beg him {{not to look at}} her.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not at <b>all.</b> <b>She</b> <b>could</b> not <b>do</b> better. A {{girl like}} that in a town such as Thorbury, with nobody to marry her but the rector, is as much out of place as a canary bird in a poultry yard. I have advised her to visit her {{relatives}} in town, and go with them to Europe, where I hope she will marry a prince. Good conscience! Look at her! Imagine that girl in a sweeping velvet robe with one great diamond blazing on her breast." ...|$|R
60|$|There was no {{checking}} {{them now}} that they had come. She fled into church on the first sounds of arrival and hid herself in the friendly shelter of the great family pew; {{but she had to}} come out and take her place, though <b>she</b> <b>could</b> hardly utter a word, and it was <b>all</b> that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> to keep from sobbing aloud; <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not hand the babe, and the Canon had to take on trust the name 'Alwyn Headworth,' for he could not hear the words that were on her trembling lips.|$|R
60|$|Twinkle's heart almost stopped beating {{when she}} heard these awful words. <b>All</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> was to stand still and look imploringly at the giant. But she held the fairy mud-turtle clasped tight in her hand, so that the monster couldn't see it.|$|E
6000|$|... and, if Minerva had not appeared, {{and held}} his hand, he had {{executed}} his design; and it was <b>all</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> to dissuade him from it. The event was, that he left the army, and would fight no more. Agamemnon gives his character thus to Nestor; ...|$|E
60|$|There was a {{space of}} suffering, when Mary and Miss Mercy did all that love could do, and kept Mrs. Frost from the sight of what she could neither cheer nor alleviate, and when <b>all</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> was to talk over the past with Lord Ormersfield.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's Janie Mannering," [...] she said, {{pointing}} to a superb, white-haired dame, whose satin robes seemed strung with pearls. [...] "I must have told you how she found her cook drunk under the kitchen table when the Empress was coming to dinner, and tucked up her velvet sleeves (she always dressed like an Empress herself), cooked the whole meal, and appeared in the drawing-room as if she'd been sleeping on a bank of roses <b>all</b> day. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> anything with her hands--they all could--make a cottage or embroider a petticoat.|$|R
60|$|It {{filled her}} with uneasiness to find him harping on this string, but <b>all</b> that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>do,</b> was to lead him quickly to some other subject, and to dismiss it from his brain. To caution him against their visitor, to show any fear or {{suspicion}} in reference to him, would only be, she feared, to increase that interest with which Barnaby regarded him, and to strengthen his desire to meet him once again. She hoped, by plunging into the crowd, to rid herself of her terrible pursuer, and then, by journeying to a distance and observing increased caution, if that were possible, to live again unknown, in secrecy and peace.|$|R
60|$|It did indeed! When Dolly {{came downstairs}} it was <b>all</b> that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> {{to push her}} way through the porch. All along the horizon the sky was brassy-yellow, but above the wind screamed and stormed, and the torn, hurrying clouds were now huddled together, and now frayed off into countless tattered streamers. In the field near the house her father and three or four labourers were working with poles and ropes, hatless, their hair and beards flying, staving up a great bulging hayrick. Dolly watched them for a moment, and then, stooping her head and {{rounding}} her shoulders, with one hand up to her little black straw hat, she staggered off across the fields.|$|R
60|$|Smoke {{looked at}} Labiskwee, who smiled, {{though it was}} <b>all</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> to keep from sinking down. He nodded for her to push off, but she came near to him, and side by side, a dozen feet apart, they flew down through the {{stinging}} thickness of cold fire.|$|E
60|$|Of course Mrs. Morris felt {{relieved}} {{to think that}} her husband would recover, {{but she could not}} forget her little daughter, and as she thought of Nell {{in the hands of the}} Indians the silent tears would course down her cheeks in spite of <b>all</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> to stay them.|$|E
60|$|Only {{he could}} work out his own salvation, and until he had light, <b>all</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> was to stand by him, help him, cease to irritate him, watch, wait. Anyhow she could at least mend his socks as well as possible, so that the threads would not chafe him....|$|E
60|$|Then Jane, the nursery-maid, {{proceeded}} {{to explain that}} the ball had rolled in and had been carried down the stream to some bushes, {{and that it was}} caught there just out of reach of <b>all</b> that <b>she,</b> Jane, <b>could</b> <b>do</b> with a long stick for its recovery. Jim, the gardener, was not to be found; and they were in despair lest the ball should become wet through and should perish.|$|R
6000|$|... "Amy {{was with}} me when the letters came," [...] Madame de Melbain continued. [...] "She left at once for England to see this man. The sum he demanded was impossible. <b>All</b> that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> was to ask for time, and to arrange to pay him so much a month whilst we were {{considering}} how to raise the money. He accepted this, and promised to keep silence. He kept his word, but for a time only. He made inquiries, {{and he seems to}} {{have come to the conclusion}} that the money was on the other side. At any rate, he approached the advisers of my husband. He was in treaty with them for the letters--when he--when he met with his death!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course I have come," [...] said Madame Goesler, {{standing}} {{close by}} him and putting her left arm very lightly on his shoulder. It was <b>all</b> that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> for him, {{but it was in}} order that she might do this that she had been summoned from London to his side. He was wan and worn and pale,--a man evidently dying, the oil of whose lamp was all burned out; but still as he turned his eyes up to the woman's face there was a remnant of that look of graceful fainéant nobility which had always distinguished him. He had never done any good, but he had always carried himself like a duke, and like a duke he carried himself to the end.|$|R
60|$|When {{the boys}} {{returned}} to the farmhouse Minnie ran out to meet them, and from their manner saw at once {{that they had no}} news worth mentioning. They could see that the girl had been crying, and now it was <b>all</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> to keep from bursting into tears again.|$|E
60|$|Hermione looked {{long and}} slow at Ursula, seeming to accept {{confirmation}} from her. Then {{the two women}} were silent. As {{soon as they were}} in accord, they began mutually to mistrust each other. In spite of herself, Ursula felt herself recoiling from Hermione. It was <b>all</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> to restrain her revulsion.|$|E
6000|$|It was <b>all</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> {{to hinder}} her walk from losing its calm slowness, {{and before she}} could divest her {{intended}} reply of undignified sharpness, he continued: 'Who could have betrayed my presence? But for this, I meant that you {{should never have been}} aware that I was hovering near to watch over you.' ...|$|E
60|$|Abandoned, {{the girl}} {{stood in the}} middle of the room, so far more 'simple' than she had ever slept in, with its warm {{fragrance}} of rose-leaves and verbena, its Aubusson carpet, white silk-quilted bed, sofa, cushioned window-seat, dainty curtains, and little nickel box of biscuits on little spindly table. There she stood and sniffed, stretched herself, and thought: 'It's jolly--only, it smells too much!' and she went up to the pictures, one by one. They seemed to go splendidly with the room, and suddenly she felt homesick. Ridiculous, of course! Yet, if she had known where her father's room was, she would have run out to it; but her memory was too tangled up with stairs and corridors--to find her way down to the hall again was <b>all</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> have <b>done.</b>|$|R
60|$|The {{excitement}} increased. The leading nobles of {{the country}} began to flock to the monastery to declare their adhesion to Peter, and their determination to sustain and protect him. Sophia, at the same time, <b>did</b> <b>all</b> that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> to rally her friends. Both sides endeavored to gain the good-will of the Guards. The princess caused them to be assembled before her palace in Moscow, and there she appeared on a balcony before them, accompanied by the Czar John; and the Czar made them a speech--one, doubtless, which Sophia had prepared for him. In this speech John stated to the Guards that his brother Peter had retired to the Monastery of the Trinity, though for what reason he knew not. He had, however, too much reason to fear, he said, that he was plotting some schemes against the state.|$|R
6000|$|If, as the 'Blackwood' of July insinuates, {{the story}} told to Lushington was a {{malignant}} slander, meant to injure Lord Byron, why did she suppress the judgment of her counsel {{at a time when}} all the world was on her side, and this decision would have been the decisive blow against her husband? Why, by sealing the lips of counsel, and of <b>all</b> whom <b>she</b> <b>could</b> influence, <b>did</b> <b>she</b> deprive herself finally of the very advantage for which it has been assumed she fabricated the story? ...|$|R
