5|$|MIT's {{proximity}} to Harvard University ("the other school up the river") {{has led to}} a substantial number of research collaborations such as the Harvard-MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology and the Broad Institute. In addition, students at the two schools can cross-register for credits toward their own school's degrees without any <b>additional</b> <b>fees.</b> A cross-registration program between MIT and Wellesley College has also existed since 1969, and in 2002 the Cambridge–MIT Institute launched an undergraduate exchange program between MIT and the University of Cambridge. MIT has more modest cross-registration programs with Boston University, Brandeis University, Tufts University, Massachusetts College of Art and the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston.|$|E
5|$|Discussions {{regarding}} a potential SANDAG {{purchase of the}} road began in October 2010. On July 29, 2011, SANDAG agreed to purchase the lease of the freeway from South Bay Expressway LLC; even though a study suggested that the agency might have to {{spend millions of dollars}} to maintain and repair parts of the highway. Objections raised to the purchase during the negotiation phase included needing a loan from the federal government of $1.5 million to complete the purchase, and a possible increase in traffic through Lemon Grove. The sale of the franchise rights until the year 2042 was finalized on December 16, 2011, at a price of $341.4 million, and $10.2 million in <b>additional</b> <b>fees,</b> with $254 million from TransNet sales tax revenue, some of it to be repaid with toll revenue. SANDAG claimed at the time that they would reduce the tolls to attract increased use and decrease traffic on I-805, which would mean that additional lanes would not need to be constructed on that route. Despite this, the operator decided to increase tolls instead even with the low demand for using the road; the San Diego Union-Tribune criticized the decision. in mid-2011, it cost $4 to drive the entire toll portion of the road.|$|E
5|$|The actors' union Equity had {{actively}} {{fought against}} the introduction of TV recording since the 1950s, when it first became a practical proposition. Before workable television recording was developed, if a broadcaster wished to repeat a programme (usually a one-off play), he had to re-hire the actors to perform it again, live, for <b>additional</b> <b>fees.</b> Equity's concern was that if broadcasters kept recordings of the original performances, {{they would be able}} to re-broadcast them indefinitely, which would reduce the amount of new production and threaten the livelihoods of its members. Although Equity could not prevent recording altogether, it added standard clauses to its members' contracts that stipulated that recordings could only be repeated a limited number of times within a specific timeframe, and deliberately set the fees for further use so high that broadcasters would consider it unjustifiable to spend so much money repeating an old programme rather than making a new one. Consequently, recordings whose repeat rights had expired were considered to be of no further domestic use to the broadcasters.|$|E

25|$|Sisal: In 1928, the Societe Fonciere du Sud de Madagascar began {{testing the}} {{viability}} of growing Sisal near Ranopiso. While about 1,000 hectares were planted, by 1935 exports were only 65 tons. In 1932, this company obtained a 4,000 hectare concession in the Mandrare river valley where sisal was found to flourish. By 1947, five sisal companies had a total of 3,075 hectares planted and employed 1,470 people. In 1951, a station of the applied research institute IRCT - Centre de Recherches Sisalières du Mandrare - is set up {{in order to enhance}} sisal intensive farming and productivity. Production grew from 2,500 tons in 1950 to almost 29,000 tons produced in 1964. By 1959, due to the steel bridge erection easing the Mandrare right bank development, six companies had expanded the area, cultivated to 14,528 hectares and employed 4,502 people. Between 1953 and 1958, in part due to <b>additional</b> <b>fees</b> paid by France, these exports were worth 500 millions CFA. In 1962, there were 7,500 people (men and women) producing sisal and the value of sisal exports was just over 1 billion FMG (a year when 99 ships docked in Fort Dauphin) and while it was just over two billion FMG in 1964, by 1966 the value of exports was just under one billion FMG and the number of employees had dropped to 4,500 by 1967. By 1969, there were about 20,000 hectares planted producing about 25,000 tons per year (half of which went to France) which was the limit established for Madagascar by the FAO. However, in three years in the mid-1960s, the value of sisal decreased by more than 50 percent due to synthetic fibers which took sisal's place. In spite of this, production was almost 25,000 tons as late as 1970. Current production is appx. 3,000 tons per year from the Mandrare Valley.|$|E
