25|$|On 27 March 2012, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) {{signed an}} <b>agreement</b> <b>to</b> <b>lend</b> $250 million to BMRC to {{part-finance}} Phase 2 {{of the metro}} rail project. The loan marked the multilateral lending agency's foray into the urban transport sector in South Asia, the ADB said in a press release. The loan, approved by the ADB Board in March 2011, is the first ADB loan to the urban transport sector without recourse to sovereign guarantees. In 2016, the Agence Francaise De Development (AFD) sanctioned a 1,600 crore loan for the project. The rate of interest on the loan is linked to Euro Interbank Offered Rate (Euribor) + 130 basis points. In early 2017, the European Investment Bank agreed to loan 3,700 crore to the BMRCL, with a repayment period of 20 years {{at a rate of}} interest lower than the one on the AFD loan.|$|E

It {{consists of an}} <b>agreement</b> <b>to</b> <b>lend</b> a fixed amount of money, called the principal sum or principal, for a fixed period of time, with this {{amount to be repaid}} by a certain date. In commercial loans interest, calculated {{as a percentage of the}} principal sum per year, will also have to be paid by that date, or may be paid periodically in the interval, such as annually or monthly. Such loans are also colloquially called [...] "bullet loans", particularly if there is only a single payment at the end - the [...] "bullet" [...] - without a [...] "stream" [...] of interest payments during the life of the loan.|$|E

40|$|The Asian {{financial}} crisis (1997) and the European crisis (2009) have both {{contributed to the}} development and deepening of regional safety net arrangements. This paper analyses the relationships between global and regional financial safety nets, and uncovers the potential tensions and operational challenges associated with the involvement of several institutional players with potentially different interests, analytical biases and governance. The G 20 has acknowledged {{the importance of these}} new players for the international monetary system, but the principles for cooperation between the IMF and regional financing arrangements are far too broad and ad hoc to contribute to a coherent and effective architecture. This paper tries to establish some lessons learned from the Asian {{financial crisis}} in 1997 and the current European crisis in order to enhance the effectiveness, efficiency, equity and governance of these arrangements. In particular, it proposes changes to the IMF articles of <b>agreement</b> <b>to</b> allow for <b>lending</b> or guarantees <b>to</b> regional arrangements directly and it establishes some key desirable features and practices of regional mechanisms that should be adopted everywhere to ensure some global consistency, particularly in the field of macroeconomic surveillance, programme design and conditionality...|$|R
