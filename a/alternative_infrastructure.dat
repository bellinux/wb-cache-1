40|$|Reducing {{greenhouse}} gas emissions (GHGE) in urban energy systems requires the implementation of <b>alternative</b> <b>infrastructure</b> configurations across different geographical, technical and social scales. Furthermore, alternative configurations may improve systems resilience and democratization of service provision. However, unlike current centralised systems, which are well understood from the technical and social perspectives, {{there is a lack}} of knowledge on the socio-technical interplay across multiple intermediate scales of alternative infrastructures, defined as all the possible configurations in between off-grid and centralised infrastructure. There are various concepts in the literature describing decentralised, distributed and integrated systems using different primary energy resources and generating various energy carriers -for electricity, heating, and cooling. However, the information on alternative models is limited to the technical requirements leaving a gap in knowledge on the societal requirements. <b>Alternative</b> <b>infrastructure</b> models potentially reduce GHGE but they may require unique forms of social organisation structures to support their adoption and increase the pace towards decarbonisation. To obtain in-depth understanding of the socio-technical interplay of alternative infrastructures across scales, this paper draws on complexity theory, the concept of modularity and transitions modelling literature. This aid in the definition of the proposed conceptual framework and the Service Provision Modules (SPM). This conceptual framework serves as the basis for spatially specific modelling and simulation. The SPM may use different types of networks and can represent any type of conventional or <b>alternative</b> <b>infrastructure</b> configuration. The conceptual framework then uses the modules to construct the socio-technical layouts for the baseline and possible future configurations in a given area. The paper briefly outlines various concepts in the literature which technically define alternative energy systems, then presents a description of the conceptual framework and the definition of an SPM. Finally, the SPMs are used to represent the Australian electricity system. Open Acces...|$|E

Cloud Computing offers a promising, <b>alternative</b> <b>infrastructure</b> for using scalable on-demand off-premise resources. However, outsourcing whole applications {{is not a}} cost optimal solution in some scenarios, because the already existing on-premise resources are not considered. A flexible integration of additional resources from the cloud to compensate a shortage of suitable on-premise resources is a tradeoff between costs and efficiency.

40|$|Abstract—High-altitude {{platforms}} (HAPs) {{are one of}} {{the most}} promising <b>alternative</b> <b>infrastructures</b> for realizing next generation mobile communications networks. This paper utilizes a recently proposed three-dimensional (3 -D) reference multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channel model for HAPs and investigates the capacity of spatially and temporally correlated HAP-MIMO channels. The effect of several parameters, such as the elevation angle of the platform, the configuration and displacement of the antenna arrays, the Doppler spread, and the 3 -D non-uniform distribution of the local scatterers, on the capacity is studied. Based on the reference model, a 3 -D sum-of-sinusoids (SoS) deterministic simulation model for HAP-MIMO channels is proposed. The results show that the simulation model is a good approximation of the reference model.

40|$|Approaches to {{enhancing}} sustainability {{have largely}} focused on altering individual consumption behaviors. However, {{this focus on}} the individual consumer has been recently critiqued because the behavior of individuals is situated within wider socio-cultural contexts. Thus, the sustainability research agenda is shifting away from individual consumers towards understanding consumption practices, social networks, material infrastructures and organisations of various forms in which consumption is problematized and consumption choices are reflected upon and negotiated. These social spaces need to be understood if change is to be truly achieved. Drawing on ethnographic research conducted in an Irish ecovillage, we examine how ecovillage members negotiate sustainable consumption at the everyday level. Analysis reveals how members of the ecovillage employ tactics that encourage reflexivity in the everyday. Specifically, these reflexive tactics work together to confront routine consumption, create <b>alternative</b> <b>infrastructures</b> that support sustainability, and foster critical engagement.

Nonetheless, a sunset clause on regulation dilutes investment incentives.

We obtain similar results for incremental infrastructure projects in a short-run framework. But we also find that transportation infrastructure mega-projects could induce the spatial deconcentration of economic activity in the long run. Thus, {{it is clear that}} the choice of a “best” transportation infrastructure program depends on policy intentions. Trade-offs vary with the nature of transportation investment alternatives: timing of outcomes (short run vs. long run), spatial distribution of socio-economic effects (regional vs. national), and who benefits are just some of the trade-offs policymakers face.|$|E
