Civilians were to observe a blackout from 10:00pm. Japanese positions in the Bonin Islands were normally able to provide an hour's warning of American raids and air raid sirens were sounded in cities threatened by attack.|$|E

5|$|Historically, the South Lake Union {{neighborhood}} of Seattle, located {{to the north}} of downtown and east of the Seattle Center, was a manufacturing district whose electrical power was supplied by the Broad Street Substation. After the failure of the Seattle Commons plan in the 1990s, which proposed a large city park over the neighborhood, the land was opened for development by Paul Allen's Vulcan Real Estate, which envisioned it as a hub for biotech and high tech firms. Vulcan and Seattle City Light began talks of collaborating to build a $160 million substation in Interbay or South Lake Union in 2003, expecting the additional high tech firms to put a strain on the Broad Street substation <b>and</b> <b>neighborhood</b> lines laid in the early 2000s. In 2005, Seattle City Light determined that adding capacity at the Broad Street substation through new transformer banks would be sufficient for the area's needs until the mid-2010s.|$|E
5|$|Not only is {{the park}} historic, {{but so is the}} mostly {{residential}} surrounding neighborhood. Many architectural works line the streets facing the park, designed by some of the most famous architects of the late 19th century, including Henry Hobson Richardson. At least two governors of New York lived in buildings facing Washington Park outside of their term in office. Due to the historical and architectural significance of the park <b>and</b> <b>neighborhood</b> both were included in 1972 as the Washington Park Historic District; and in 1998 the park was named one of the nation's 100 most important parks by the American Association of Architects. In 2008 Boston-based composer Peter Child wrote an orchestral piece inspired by the park, entitled Washington Park.|$|E

5|$|Plans for {{increasing}} enrollment to 19,500 students and adding 1,500 {{faculty and staff}} by 2020, and the anticipated environmental impacts of such action, encountered opposition from the city, the local community, and the student body. City voters in 2006 passed two measures calling on UCSC {{to pay for the}} impacts of campus growth. A Santa Cruz Superior Court judge invalidated the measures, ruling they were improperly put on the ballot. In 2008, the university, city, county <b>and</b> <b>neighborhood</b> organizations reached an agreement to set aside numerous lawsuits and allow the expansion to occur. UCSC agreed to local government scrutiny of its north campus expansion plans, to provide housing for 67 percent of the additional students on campus, and to pay municipal development and water fees.|$|E
