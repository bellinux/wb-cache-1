5|$|In the sonnet, {{the poet}} writes {{of why he}} has stopped {{showering}} his muse with flowery praise and adoration. In his analysis of Shakespeare's Sonnets, David West suggests that the sequence of sonnets 100-103 <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>silence</b> described are {{a response to the}} infidelity of the Fair Youth in the Rival Poet sequence of sonnets (78-86), which has caused a rift between the poet and his Muse. He writes of how immediately following the Rival Poet sonnets, the Poet begins to speak of his lover being false and having forsaken him. West claims that this ultimately culminates in sonnets 100-103, where the Poet expresses his regret over what has transpired.|$|E

500|$|As a symbol, an urn cannot {{completely}} represent poetry, {{but it does}} {{serve as}} one component in describing the relationship between art and humanity. The nightingale of [...] "Ode to a Nightingale" [...] is separated from humanity and does not have human concerns. In contrast, being a piece of art, the urn requires an audience and is in an incomplete state on its own. This allows the urn to interact with humanity, to put forth a narrative, and allows for the imagination to operate. The images on the urn provoke the narrator to ask questions, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>silence</b> of the urn reinforces the imagination's ability to operate. This interaction {{and use of the}} imagination is part of a greater tradition called ut pictura poesis – the contemplation of art by a poet – which serves as a meditation upon art itself. In this meditation, the narrator dwells on the aesthetic and mimetic features of art. The beginning of the poem posits that the role of art is to describe a specific story about those with whom the audience is unfamiliar, and the narrator wishes to know the identity of the figures {{in a manner similar to}} [...] "Ode on Indolence" [...] and [...] "Ode to Psyche". The figures on the urn within [...] "Ode on a Grecian Urn" [...] lack identities, but the first section ends with the narrator believing that if he knew the story, he would know their names. The second section of the poem, describing the piper and the lovers, meditates on the possibility that the role of art is not to describe specifics but universal characters, which falls under the term [...] "Truth". The three figures would represent how Love, Beauty, and Art are unified together in an idealised world where art represents the feelings of the audience. The audience is not supposed to question the events but instead to rejoice in the happy aspects of the scene in a manner that reverses the claims about art in [...] "Ode to a Nightingale". Similarly, the response of the narrator to the sacrifice is not compatible with the response of the narrator to the lovers.|$|E

Verpleegsters is egter geneig om die negatiewe impak van sekondêre trauma te ontken,wat gevolglik tot stilswye en uitbranding kan lei. Hierdie artikel ondersoek en beskryf die teenwoordigheid en verwantskap tussen hierdie emosies. ‘n Kwantitatiewe benadering met ‘n nie-waarskynlikheidsteekproefmetode is gebruik.

2500|$|Similarly, in Anna Bikont’s {{investigation}} of “the massacre of Jews in wartime Jedwabne, Poland” in The Crime <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Silence,</b> she recognizes {{the presence of}} antisemitism {{as a result of}} religious influence that is blurred with anti-Judaism characteristics. Bikont’s explanation of life in Poland as a Jew post World War I reveals how {{it is often difficult to}} distinguish between anti-Judaism and antisemitism during this time of growing anti-Judaic ideology. Poles and Jews “lived separate lives and spoke different languages” which prevented Jews from fully assimilating into Poland culture. Jewish religious culture remained present and Jew’s “social and cultural life ran on a separate track” compared to Poles. The ethnic differences were made more obvious through the obvious differences in culture which fuel anti-Judaic acts. Although Jews ran separate lives from Poles, they coexisted for a long time. “Jews, especially the young, got along fine in Polish, but at home they spoke Yiddish.” Socially, Jews and Poles often participated in “picnics, festivities … but Jews [...] often met with an unfriendly response from Poles, and in the latter half of the thirties they were simply through own of these organizations.” Bikont believes that negative views towards Jews were reinforced through religious organizations like the Catholic Church and National Party in northern Europe. “The lives of Catholics revolved around the parish and the world of churchgoers, as well as events organized by the National Party, which was blatant in its exclusion of Jews. Bikont considers that the murderous actions towards Jews in Poland resulted from “ contempt and hostility towards Jews, feelings that were reinforced in the course of their upbringing.” These events are classified as antisemitic because of the change from increase of hostility and exclusion. The delusional perception of Jews escalated in 1933 when there was a “ swept up the whole town… ‘Shooting, windows broken, shutters closed, women shrieking, running home.” Bikont believes that these violent aggressions towards Jews are considered acts of antisemitism because they are performed as revolutionary acts that were a part of the National Party’s agenda. Much of the difference between defining anti-Judaism from antisemitism relies on the source of influence for beliefs and actions against Jews. Once Jews were viewed as the other from Poles, the discrimination transformed from ideology of religion to race which are shown through acts of violence.|$|E

40|$|Background: Cystic {{fibrosis}} trans-membrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is a cAMP-modulated chloride/bicarbonate channel {{with different}} functions in various organs and tissues. CFTR expression get decreasing from embryogenesis to adult/elder age and recent evidences show that some CFTR-regulating microRNAs, i. e, miR- 494, is up-regulated during cellular senescence. Cellular senescence {{is a permanent}} cell cycle arrest that can be induced in young cells by different stimuli such as the physiological shortening of telomeres, the activation of oncogenes as well as oxidative stress. Aims: To assess whether and how CFTR might be involved in cellular senescence. Methods: To induce premature senescence, IMR 90 young cells (PDL 34) were treated with 100 M diethylmaleate (DEM) for ten days. <b>The</b> over-expression <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>silencing</b> of CFTR in pre-senescent IMR 90 cells and young IMR 90 cells, respectively, were performed by lentiviral cell infection <b>and</b> cell counting. <b>The</b> CFTR <b>and</b> <b>the</b> microRNAs expression were assessed by Western Blot and RT-PCR analysis either in: i) IMR 90 cells at different population doubling levels (PDL); ii) IMR 90 cells at different days after DEM treatment. Results: We found that: a) the CFTR expression significantly decreased in IMR 90 cells during replicative senescence and after DEM treatment in an inverse relationship with miR- 494 expression; c) the over-expression of CFTR in IMR 90 pre-senescent cells significantly accelerate cellular senescence, while, <b>the</b> <b>silencing</b> of CFTR significantly slowed {{the appearance of the}} senescent phenotype. Conclusions: Our preliminary data show that CFTR is physiologically down-regulated during cellular senescence and this may (at least partially) depend on the up-regulation of miR- 494. <b>The</b> over-expression <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>silencing</b> of CFTR in IMR 90 cells have important effects on their cell cycle.

40|$|ABSTRACT WHERE WE CANNOT SPEAK The poetry {{collection}} Where We Cannot Speak <b>and</b> <b>the</b> accompanying critical essay “Borges <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Golem Paradox: a Rhetoric of Silence?” {{explore the}} theme of language <b>and</b> <b>silence.</b> <b>The</b> poetry collection is written {{in the voice of}} the imaginary (but published) poet, Gershon Holtz, who reflects my Jewish heritage <b>and</b> upbringing. <b>The</b> poems articulate <b>the</b> <b>silences</b> of those oppressed by war and persecution, <b>and</b> also <b>the</b> <b>silences</b> of meditation <b>and</b> <b>the</b> ineffable, which can reside in <b>the</b> presence, absence, <b>and</b> margins of <b>the</b> poet’s voice. The collection is comprised of two sections: (i) “The Mantelpiece”, which delves into culture, conflict, and memory; and (ii) “The Beautiful Salon”, which reflects upon themes of place, time, loss, and responses to silences represented in visual art <b>and</b> poetry. <b>The</b> critical essay is concerned with the cabalistic figure of the golem—a human being made in an artificial way by magic art, through the use of holy names. Argentinean writer Jorge Luis Borges (famous for creating fictitious authors and books) wished that, of all his work, the first stanza of his poem “The Golem”, might be remembered. The essay provides a reading that demonstrates how the poem embodies Borges’ views on the nature of signification, language, <b>and</b> knowledge. <b>The</b> paradoxical outcome is that, just as the golem did not have the power of speech, language conceived of as an instrument for textual golem-making is silent in its capacity to represent the world. The essay concludes with some thoughts on my own poetic practice <b>and</b> links <b>the</b> essay with the poetry collection via the figure of the textual golem, Gershon Holtz. This fictional poet becomes a symbol for the problem of language and representation—interpreted both as what we cannot speak about, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>silences</b> inherent in language itself...|$|R
