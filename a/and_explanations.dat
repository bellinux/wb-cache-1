25|$|Thomas Sprat {{wrote his}} History of the Royal Society in 1667 and set forth, {{in a single}} document, the goals of {{empirical}} science ever after.

In Sprat's account, the Royal Society explicitly rejected anything that seemed like scholasticism. For Sprat, as {{for a number of}} the founders of the Royal Society, science was Protestant: its reasons <b>and</b> <b>explanations</b> had to be comprehensible to all. There would be no priests in science, and anyone could reproduce the experiments and hear their lessons.
