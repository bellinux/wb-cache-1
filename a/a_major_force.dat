5|$|In critic Gary Giddins' view,Kelly {{was never}} able to exploit his gifts when he went out on his own. His quartet with Wes Montgomery should have {{developed}} into <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>force,</b> but the same commercial interests that shanghaied Montgomery saddled Kelly with the fashionable soul-funk of the mid-'60s. Unlike Montgomery, his career went nowhere, and he didn't live long enough to find himself again.|$|E
5|$|Real Madrid {{established}} {{itself as}} <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>force</b> in both Spanish and European football during the 1950s, winning five consecutive European Cups and reaching the final seven times. This success was replicated in the league, where the club won {{five times in}} the space of seven years. This team, which consisted of players such as Alfredo Di Stéfano, Ferenc Puskás, Francisco Gento and Raymond Kopa, is considered by some in the sport to be the greatest team of all time.|$|E
5|$|Röhm {{hoped to}} assume {{command of the}} army and absorb it into the ranks of the SA. Hindenburg and Defence Minister Werner von Blomberg {{threatened}} to impose martial law if the alarming activities of the SA were not curtailed. Hitler also suspected that Röhm was plotting to depose him, so he ordered the deaths of Röhm and other political enemies. Up to 200 people were killed from 30 June to 2 July 1934 in an event that became known as the Night of the Long Knives. After this purge, the SA was no longer <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>force.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{club was}} founded in 1892 and joined the Football League the {{following}} year. The club has played at Anfield since its formation. Liverpool established itself as <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>force</b> in both English and European football during the 1970s and 1980s when Bill Shankly and Bob Paisley led the club to 11 League titles and seven European trophies. Under the management of Rafa Benítez and captained by Steven Gerrard Liverpool became European champion for the fifth time, winning the 2005 UEFA Champions League Final against Milan in spite of being 3–0 down at half time.|$|E
5|$|FIAT owner Edoardo Agnelli {{gained control}} of the club in 1923 and built a new stadium. This helped the club to its second scudetto (league championship) in the 1925–26 season, after beating Alba Roma with an {{aggregate}} score of 12–1 (Antonio Vojak's goals were essential that season). The club established itself as <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>force</b> in Italian football since the 1930s, becoming the country's first professional club and the first with a decentralised fan base, which led it to win a record of five consecutive Italian championships (the first four under the management of Carlo Carcano) and form {{the core of the}} Italy national team during the Vittorio Pozzo's era, including the 1934 world champion squad, with star players such as Raimundo Orsi, Luigi Bertolini, Giovanni Ferrari and Luis Monti amongst others.|$|E

It was under Bernabéu's guidance that Real Madrid established itself as <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>force</b> in both Spanish and European football. The club won the European Cup five times in a row between 1956 and 1960, which included the 7–3 Hampden Park final against Eintracht Frankfurt in 1960. After these five consecutive successes, Real was permanently awarded the original cup and earning the right to wear the UEFA badge of honour.|$|E

5|$|In March 1961, Revie was {{appointed}} player-manager of Leeds United, then a Second Division club {{who had never}} previously won a major trophy. Under Revie's management, Leeds became <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>force</b> in English football, winning the Second Division in 1963–64, the First Division in 1968–69 and 1973–74, the FA Cup in 1972, the League Cup in 1968, the FA Charity Shield in 1969, and the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup in 1968 and 1971. Additionally, Leeds were First Division runners-up five times, thrice FA Cup runners-up and runners-up in the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup and the European Cup Winners' Cup. In July 1974 he accepted the job as England manager, but had an unsuccessful {{three years in the}} role before quitting in highly controversial circumstances to take up the management role with the United Arab Emirates.

5|$|Shankly {{took charge}} of Liverpool {{when they were in}} the Second Division and rebuilt the team into <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>force</b> in English and European football. He led Liverpool to the Second Division Championship to gain {{promotion}} to the top-flight First Division in 1962, before going on to win three First Division Championships, two FA Cups, four Charity Shields and one UEFA Cup. Shankly announced his surprise retirement from football a few weeks after Liverpool had won the 1974 FA Cup Final, having managed the club for 15 years, and was succeeded by his long-time assistant Bob Paisley. He led the Liverpool team out for the last time at Wembley for the 1974 FA Charity Shield. He died seven years later, aged 68.|$|E

He also sees her as being fettered by her own values, which are incompatible with those held by the general Indonesian populace.

5|$|Along {{with the}} king, royal family, and chief noblemen, {{the church was}} <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>force</b> in Northumbria. Churchmen were not only figures of spiritual authority, they were major landowners, who also {{controlled}} trade, centred at major churches and monasteries in a land without cities and towns. The bishopric of Lindisfarne was held by Cuthbert at Aldfrith's accession; Cuthbert was succeeded by the Irish-educated Eadberht, who would later be Abbot of Iona and bring the Easter controversy to an end, and then by Eadfrith, creator of the Lindisfarne Gospels. The bishops of Lindisfarne sometimes held the see of Hexham, but during Aldfrith's reign it was held by John of Beverley, a pupil and protégé of Theodore, the Archbishop of Canterbury. The bishopric of York was held by Bosa in 685. Wilfrid was given the see in 687, but removed in 691 with Bosa returning to York. The short-lived see at Abercorn, created in 681 for Bishop Trumwine, collapsed in the period after Ecgfrith's death and the first known Bishop of Whithorn was appointed in the reign of King Ceolwulf. Important monasteries existed at Whitby, where the known abbesses tended {{to be members of}} the Deiran royal family, at Monkwearmouth-Jarrow, where Bede was a monk, and at Ripon.|$|E
5|$|The Act was {{implemented}} by the NRA and the Public Works Administration (PWA). Very large numbers of regulations were generated under the authority granted to the NRA by the Act, {{which led to a}} significant loss of political support for Roosevelt and the New Deal. The NIRA was set to expire in June 1935, but in a major constitutional ruling the U.S. Supreme Court held Title I of the Act unconstitutional on May 27, 1935, in Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States, 295 U.S. 495 (1935). The National Industrial Recovery Act is widely considered a policy failure, both in the 1930s and by historians today. Disputes over the reasons for this failure continue. Among the suggested causes are that the Act promoted economically harmful monopolies, that the Act lacked critical support from the business community, and that it was poorly administered. The Act encouraged union organizing, which led to significant labor unrest. The NIRA had no mechanisms for handling these problems, which led Congress to pass the National Labor Relations Act in 1935. The Act was also <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>force</b> behind a major modification of the law criminalizing making false statements.|$|E
5|$|Though jazz {{had long}} since {{achieved}} some limited popularity, it was Louis Armstrong who {{became one of the}} first popular stars and <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>force</b> in the development of jazz, along with his friend pianist Earl Hines. Armstrong, Hines, and their colleagues were improvisers, capable of creating numerous variations on a single melody. Armstrong also popularized scat singing, an improvisational vocal technique in which nonsensical syllables (vocables) are sung. Armstrong and Hines were influential in the rise of a kind of pop big band jazz called swing. Swing is characterized by a strong rhythm section, usually consisting of double bass and drums, medium to fast tempo, and rhythmic devices like the swung note, which is common to most jazz. Swing is primarily a fusion of 1930s jazz fused with elements of the blues and Tin Pan Alley. Swing used bigger bands than other kinds of jazz, leading to bandleaders tightly arranging the material which discouraged improvisation, previously an integral part of jazz. Swing became a major part of African American dance, and came to be accompanied by a popular dance called the swing dance.|$|E

5|$|With the {{mechanization}} {{of transport}} {{and the military}} in the 20th century, the Anglo-Norman was no longer in demand as a carriage and military horse. In addition, World War II and the German occupation of France caused significant damage to the Norman homeland of the breed as fighting destroyed farms and killed half of the horses at the National Stud at Saint-Lô. Most of the surviving were of the Norman Cob breed, and horses lost their status as animals of luxury and leisure. Many farms were left in ruins, and breeders were left rethinking their breeding aims. Certain provisions of the Marshall Plan convinced them not to focus on breeding draft horses, and that type began to disappear. Instead, emphasis shifted toward producing horses for equestrian sports, and a stud book was created for the Anglo-Norman breed on December 7, 1950, at Saint-Lô. In the 1950s and 1960s, the Anglo-Norman became <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>force</b> in international equine competition. At the 1964 Summer Olympics, the Anglo-Norman Lutteur B won a gold medal in show jumping.|$|E
