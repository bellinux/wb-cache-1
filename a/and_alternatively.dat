5|$|The Western Chalukya Empire ruled most of {{the western}} Deccan, South India, between the 10th and 12th centuries. This Kannadiga dynasty is {{sometimes}} called the Kalyani Chalukya after its regal capital at Kalyani, today's Basavakalyan in Karnataka <b>and</b> <b>alternatively</b> the Later Chalukya from its theoretical relationship to the 6th-century Chalukya dynasty of Badami. The dynasty is called Western Chalukyas to differentiate from the contemporaneous Eastern Chalukyas of Vengi, a separate dynasty. Prior {{to the rise of}} these Chalukyas, the Rashtrakuta empire of Manyakheta controlled most of Deccan and Central India for over two centuries. In 973, seeing confusion in the Rashtrakuta empire after a successful invasion of their capital by the ruler of the Paramara dynasty of Malwa, Tailapa II, a feudatory of the Rashtrakuta Dynasty ruling from Bijapur region defeated his overlords and made Manyakheta his capital. The dynasty quickly rose to power and grew into an empire under Someshvara I who moved the capital to Kalyani.|$|E
5|$|White House Astronomy Night (<b>and</b> <b>alternatively</b> Astronomy Night on the National Mall) is {{an event}} first {{organized}} by the White House {{in conjunction with the}} Office of Science and Technology Policy to motivate interest in astronomy and science education. The original White House Astronomy Night was held in 2009 on the South Lawn. In 2010 the White House and the Office of Science and Technology Policy organized a similar event with help from Hofstra University, this time held on the National Mall. Between 2010 and 2014 annual events took place at the National Mall with coordination between Hofstra University and federal agencies including: the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum, NASA, and the National Science Foundation. In 2015 an event took place in June at the National Mall, and then back at the White House again on October 19.|$|E
25|$|Lactose-free {{milk can}} be {{produced}} by passing milk over lactase enzyme bound to an inert carrier. Once the molecule is cleaved, there are no lactose ill effects. Forms are available with reduced amounts of lactose (typically 30% of normal), <b>and</b> <b>alternatively</b> with nearly 0%. The only noticeable difference from regular milk is a slightly sweeter taste due to the generation of glucose by lactose cleavage. It does not, however, contain more glucose, and is nutritionally identical to regular milk.|$|E

25|$|Oman {{does not}} have an {{apostasy}} law. However, under Law 32 of 1997 on Personal Status for Muslims, an apostate's marriage is considered annulled and inheritance rights denied when the individual commits apostasy. The Basic Law of Oman, since its enactment in 1995, declares Oman to be an Islamic state and Sharia as the final word and source of all legislation. Omani jurists state that this deference to Sharia, <b>and</b> <b>alternatively</b> the blasphemy law under Article 209 of Omani law, allows the state to pursue death penalty against Muslim apostates, if it wants to.|$|E

The demonstrators claimed that the elections, which saw the governing Party of Communists of the Republic of Moldova (PCRM) win a majority of seats, were fraudulent, <b>and</b> <b>alternatively</b> demanded a recount, a new election, or resignation of the government. Similar demonstrations took place in other major Moldovan cities, including the country's second largest, Bălți, where over 7,000 people protested.|$|E
25|$|Lending {{criteria}} {{have been}} tightened following {{the passing of}} Money Laundry Law 80 in 2002 and Banking Law 88 in 2003. Interest rates {{are no longer the}} dominant factor in banks' lending decisions. In fact, both the inefficiency and absence {{of the role of the}} Central Bank of Egypt in qualitative and quantitative control as well as implementing banking procedures and standards was almost entirely responsible for the non-performing loans crisis. Banks steadily reduced credit from its peak of about EGP 30 billion in FY1999 <b>and</b> <b>alternatively</b> invested in more liquid no-risk securities such as treasury bills and government bonds. Improving private sector access to credit will critically depend on resolving the problem of non-performing loans with businesses and top government officials.|$|E

25|$|In Ado-Ekiti, {{the title}} of Ewi as a {{metropolitan}} sovereign is hereditary <b>and</b> <b>alternatively</b> contested {{by members of the}} two prominent ruling houses that had gained traditional preeminence within the royal household during period under review, whenever the stool of Ewi became vacant. Heads of subordinate towns in old Ado-Ekiti Kingdom may not be regarded as Baale (High Chiefs) as commonly seen in Yoruba communities of the Ibadan and Oyo country. Rather they were Traditional Rulers (Oba Ilu), though of lower status to the King-Emperor (Oba Alayeluwa or Oba lori Agbegbe) who resides in the main town, a position occupied by the Ewi of Ado-Ekiti in the 19th century. In the circumstances where subjected towns and their rebellion-prone rulers were faraway or near but troublesome by striving for autonomy or independence from Ewi’s influence as identified in case of the Alawe, the Olosi, the Olode, the Onijan and the Onimesi; rulers of other subordinate towns and Ewi’s chieftains were constantly on hand to check them against crisis that could create chaos or attract foreign invasions.|$|E
25|$|David Freidel and F. Kent Reilly III proposed, in 2010, that, {{rather than}} a unique script, the Cascajal Block in fact {{represents}} a special arrangement of sacred objects used in ancient times for magical purposes. They propose that the incised symbols on the block represent the contents of three sacred bundles arranged in three separate registers {{from top to bottom}}. These sacred bundles include well known objects used in magic and divination rituals. Many of these objects/signs, arranged horizontally within the registers, are present in all three registers. The whole block is to be read in boustrophedon fashion from top to bottom <b>and</b> <b>alternatively</b> left to right and right to left. Freidel and Reilly argue {{that the majority of the}} symbols on the block are found in the established corpus of Middle Formative art and many are otherwise part of iconographically comprehensible compositions that are designed to be read pictographically and not as script encoding spoken language. Rather than to regard the Cascajal Block as an epistemological dead-end—the conclusion if it is identified as a unique script—they identify the block as a key to understanding a special arrangement of sacred objects presented in the course of a religious ritual. The purpose of this may have been to memorialize the acts of divination or other magical rituals. This was a pervasive ritual practice well attested in the archaeology of Formative period Mesoamerica.|$|E

500|$|The Upanishads are {{commonly}} referred to as Vedānta. Vedanta has been interpreted as the [...] "last chapters, parts of the Veda" [...] <b>and</b> <b>alternatively</b> as [...] "the object, the highest purpose of the Veda".

Along with the Bhagavad Gita and the Brahmasutra, the mukhya Upanishads (known collectively as the Prasthanatrayi) provide a foundation for the several later schools of Vedanta, among them, two influential monistic schools of Hinduism.|$|E
500|$|Brainard Homestead State Park, <b>and</b> <b>alternatively</b> Brainerd Homestead State Park, is a [...] undeveloped {{state park}} {{located in the}} town of East Haddam, Connecticut, United States. A {{farmhouse}} was built on the site by Timothy Green in 1842 before being purchased by Selden Tyler Brainerd in March 1854. The ownership of the property was willed to Geraldine W. Hayden. Upon her death in 1929, the property was willed to the State of Connecticut with the condition that William Brainerd {{be able to use the}} property for life. William Brainerd died in 1936, the buildings were later dismantled, but the Brainard Homestead State Park was established prior to May 1, 1932. The undeveloped park is said to offer bird watching, sports fields and hiking according to the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection. As of 2012, the fields were noted to be farmed and there were no established trails for hiking.|$|E
500|$|Archaeopteryx {{continues}} {{to play an important}} part in scientific debates about the origin and evolution of birds. Some scientists see it as a semi-arboreal climbing animal, following the idea that birds evolved from tree-dwelling gliders (the [...] "trees down" [...] hypothesis for the evolution of flight proposed by O. C. Marsh). Other scientists see Archaeopteryx as running quickly along the ground, supporting the idea that birds evolved flight by running (the [...] "ground up" [...] hypothesis proposed by Samuel Wendell Williston). Still others suggest that Archaeopteryx might have been at home both in the trees and on the ground, like modern crows, and this latter view is what currently is considered best-supported by morphological characters. Altogether, it appears that the species was not particularly specialized for running on the ground or for perching. A scenario outlined by Elżanowski in 2002 suggested that Archaeopteryx used its wings mainly to escape predators by glides punctuated with shallow downstrokes to reach successively higher perches, <b>and</b> <b>alternatively,</b> to cover longer distances (mainly) by gliding down from cliffs or treetops.|$|E

500|$|Much of {{the game}} {{takes place in the}} Time-Twisting Machine, which allows the {{characters}} to travel to different periods in time. The levels that take place in the Middle Ages are populated by wizards, rams, knights and frogs that transform into princes upon being kissed. The prehistoric levels take place in a Jurassic swamp and feature a Tyrannosaurus hatchling that can be mounted and ridden, restless pterodactyls and a gigantic triceratops that pursues Crash throughout the level. The Arabian levels take place on the rooftops and are overrun with swordsmen, scorpions and genies who seek to stuff Crash into their lamps. The Egyptian levels are set during the heyday of the Great Pyramids and are populated by mummies, pyramid construction crews, scarabs and cobras; in addition to the various enemies, the tombs are also overrun with traps. The future levels take place in [...] "Neo York", a city under Cortex's rule that features laser cannons, robots, flying saucers, force fields and moving platforms. The [...] "Lost Highway" [...] levels, in which Crash pilots a motorcycle, take place in a 1950s America highway, where Crash must race against Cortex's hot rodders to win Crystals, avoiding construction barricades and cops along the way. The World War I levels take place in the skies of Europe <b>and</b> <b>alternatively</b> feature Crash and Coco as the player character. In these levels, Cortex's fleet of dirigibles must be shot down to obtain the Crystal. The Atlantis levels feature Crash in scuba gear who must find the Crystals in the Atlantean ruins, which are rife with sharks, depth charges and poisonous blowfish. Another water-themed group of levels take place during the Golden Age of Piracy and feature Coco as the player character, who must ride a jetski and gather the Crystals {{on the surface of the}} water, avoiding pirates and water mines as she does so. The Great Wall of China levels feature Coco as the player character and are played riding on the back of a tiger cub while avoiding doddery pan carriers and Chinese dragons.
