50|$|<b>Atiprimod</b> (INN, codenamed SK&F106615) is a {{substance}} being {{studied in the}} treatment of certain multiple myelomas and other advanced cancers. It may block the growth of tumors and the growth of blood vessels from surrounding tissue to the tumor. This drug is also being researched as a potential treatment for various autoimmune diseases. It was first developed by GlaxoSmithKline as a potential treatment for rheumatoid arthritis. The substance is also known as azaspirane, although this more properly refers to the class of chemicals to which <b>atiprimod</b> belongs.|$|E
50|$|<b>Atiprimod</b> {{has been}} shown to inhibit {{angiogenesis}} (growth of blood vessels) in a blood vessel model using chicken eggs. It is thought to inhibit the secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a growth factor that promotes angiogenesis.|$|E
40|$|Multiple myeloma (MM) {{accounts}} for 1 % of all cancer deaths. Although treated aggressively, almost all myelomas eventually recur and become resistant to treatment. <b>Atiprimod</b> (2 -(3 -Diethylaminopropyl) - 8, 8 -dipropyl- 2 -azaspiro[4, 5] decane dimaleate) has exerted anti-inflammatory activities and inhibited oeteoclast-induced bone resorption in animal models and been well tolerated {{in patients with}} rheumatoid arthritis in phase I clinical trials. Therefore, we investigated its activity in MM cells and its mechanism of action. We found that <b>Atiprimod</b> inhibited proliferation of the myeloma cell lines U 266 -B 1, OCI-MY 5, MM- 1, and MM- 1 R in a time- and dose-dependent manner. <b>Atiprimod</b> blocked U 266 -B 1 myeloma cells in the G 0 /G 1 phase, preventing cell cycle progression. Furthermore, <b>Atiprimod</b> inhibited signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 3 activation, blocking the signalling pathway of interleukin- 6, which contributes to myeloma cell proliferation and survival, and downregulated the antiapoptotic proteins Bcl- 2, Bcl-XL, and Mcl- 1. Incubation of U 266 -B 1 myeloma cells with <b>Atiprimod</b> induced apoptosis through the activation of caspase 3 and subsequent cleavage of the DNA repair enzyme poly(adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase. Finally, <b>Atiprimod</b> suppressed myeloma colony-forming cell proliferation in fresh marrow cells from five patients with newly diagnosed MM in a dose-dependent fashion. These data suggest that <b>Atiprimod</b> has a role in future therapies for MM...|$|E
40|$|Azaspirane (N-N-diethyl- 8, 8 -dipropyl- 2 -azaspiro [4. 5] decane- 2 -propanamine; trade name, <b>Atiprimod)</b> is an orally {{bioavailable}} cationic amphiphilic {{compound that}} significantly inhibits production of interleukin 6 (IL- 6) and inflammation in rat arthritis and autoimmune animal models. We here characterize {{the effect of}} <b>atiprimod</b> on human multiple myeloma (MM) cells. Azaspirane significantly inhibited growth and induced caspase-mediated apoptosis in drug-sensitive and drug-resistant MM cell lines, as well as patient MM cells. IL- 6, {{insulin-like growth factor 1}} (IGF- 1), or adherence of MM cells to bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) did not protect against atiprimod-induced apoptosis. Both conventional (dexamethasone, doxorubicin, melphalan) and novel (arsenic trioxide) agents augment apoptosis induced by <b>atiprimod.</b> Azaspirane inhibits signal transducer activator of transcription 3 (STAT 3) and a PI 3 -K (phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase) target (Akt), but not extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK 1 / 2), inhibits phosphorylation triggered by IL- 6, and also inhibits inhibitorκBα (IκBα) and nuclear factor κB (NFκB) p 65 phosphorylation triggered by tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α). Of importance, azaspirane inhibits both IL- 6 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) secretion in BMSCs triggered by MM cell binding and also inhibits angiogenesis on human umbilical vein cells (HUVECs). Finally, azaspirane demonstrates in vivo antitumor activity against human MM cell growth in severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice. These results, therefore, show that azaspirane both induces MM cell apoptosis and inhibits cytokine secretion in the BM milieu, providing the framework for clinical trials to improve patient outcome in MM...|$|E
40|$|We {{developed}} a novel in vivo multiple myeloma (MM) model by engrafting the interleukin 6 (IL- 6) –dependent human MM cell line INA- 6 into severe combined im-munodeficiency (SCID) mice previously given implants {{of a human}} fetal bone chip (SCID-hu mice). INA- 6 cells require either exogenous human IL- 6 (huIL- 6) or bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) to prolifer-ate in vitro. In this model, we monitored the in vivo growth of INA- 6 cells stably transduced with a green fluorescent pro-tein (GFP) gene (INA- 6 GFP cells). INA- 6 MM cells engrafted in SCID-hu mice but not in SCID mice {{that had not been}} given implants of human fetal bone. The level of soluble human IL- 6 receptor (shuIL- 6 R) in murine serum and fluorescence imaging of host animals were sensitive indicators of tumor growth. Dexamethasone as well as experimental drugs, such as <b>Atiprimod</b> and B-B 4 -DM 1, were used to confirm the utility of the model for evaluation of anti-MM agents. We report that this model is highly reproducible and allows for evaluation of investigational drugs target-ing IL- 6 –dependent MM cells in the hu-man bone marrow (huBM) milieu. (Blood...|$|E
