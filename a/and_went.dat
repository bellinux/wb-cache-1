Under conditions known to cause the dissociation of Gi <b>and</b> <b>Go</b> into their constituent subunits then phosphorylation of Gi <b>and</b> <b>Go</b> by the insulin receptor was abolished. The α-subunits of Gi <b>and</b> <b>Go</b> could be selectively phosphorylated by the insulin receptor tyrosyl-kinase using appropriate concentrations of Mg 2 + and GTP-γ-S...|$|R
