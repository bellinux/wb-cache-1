5|$|Emperor {{penguins}} are serially monogamous. They {{have only}} one mate each year, and stay faithful to that mate. However, fidelity between years is only about 15%. The narrow window of opportunity available for mating <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> influence, {{as there is a}} priority to mate and breed which often precludes waiting for the appearance of the previous year's partner.|$|E
5|$|In 499 CE, the Indian {{astronomer}} Aryabhata propounded {{a planetary}} model that explicitly incorporated Earth's rotation about its axis, which he explains {{as the cause}} of what <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> apparent westward motion of the stars. He also believed that the orbits of planets are elliptical.|$|E
5|$|In places, the {{seemingly}} at odds architectural styles {{can be viewed}} simultaneously; this is particularly so in the chimney stacks which resemble Islamic minarets. These coupled with the castellated parapets add what <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> almost Moorish element to the late English Renaissance air of the northern facade.|$|E
40|$|Photograph of an {{exterior}} {{view of the}} A. C. Burrage {{residence in}} Redlands, ca. 1900. This large light-colored, mission revival-style residence, at center, has two large bell towers, at least five chimneys, a row of arches framing what <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> wrap-around porch, and glass gazebo to the far right. In the foreground dozens of trees obscure what <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> driveway leading <b>to</b> the residence. A mountain ridge to the distance at left <b>is</b> above what <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> more dense residential area...|$|R

5|$|The MAM {{may also}} {{be part of the}} {{secretory}} pathway, in addition to its role in intracellular lipid trafficking. In particular, the MAM <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> intermediate destination between the rough ER and the Golgi in the pathway that leads to very-low-density lipoprotein, or VLDL, assembly and secretion. The MAM thus serves as a critical metabolic and trafficking hub in lipid metabolism.|$|E
5|$|In July 2006 a major {{community}} archaeological dig was organised in the grounds by the Museum of London Archaeological Archive and Research Centre, {{as part of}} the centenary celebrations of the opening of Bruce Castle Museum, in which large numbers of local youths took part. As well as large quantities of discarded everyday objects, the chalk foundations of what <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> earlier house on the site were discovered.|$|E
5|$|Many popular modern {{accounts}} of the war claim {{that there was a}} factional split in the escaped slaves between those under Spartacus, who wished to escape over the Alps to freedom, and those under Crixus, who wished to stay in southern Italy to continue raiding and plundering. This <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> interpretation of events based on the following: the regions that Florus lists as being raided by the slaves include Thurii and Metapontum, which are geographically distant from Nola and Nuceria.|$|E

Other residents of the estate appear in the house, but are caught by life-sized peg dolls that laugh and sing like children, and transform the residents into more dolls. Amy and Rory witness one transformation and try to flee, but Amy is caught and becomes a doll herself, joining the others in chasing Rory.|$|E
5|$|Takalik Abaj Monument23 {{dates to}} the Middle Preclassic period, and is found in Takalik Abaj, an {{important}} city {{in the foothills of}} the Guatemalan Pacific coast, in the modern department of Retalhuleu. It <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> Olmec-style colossal head re-carved into a niche figure sculpture. If originally a colossal head then it would be the only known example from outside the Olmec heartland.|$|E
5|$|The five Gefion {{passages}} seem {{to highlight}} the championing of a new order antagonistic to goddess worship. In light of what <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> elaborate thematic statement about patrilineage in the poem, the new order may also have entailed a change in kinship systems. Grendel and his mother may stand as types of earlier, matrilineal tribes. Further the hall which {{is the object of}} struggle between Beowulf and the first two monsters may symbolize the consolidation of new hierarchical social organization among the northern Germanic peoples.|$|E

The woman below him lies within a semicylindrical transparent shield, while her mouth is sealed, devices implying that she bears a secret. To their left, a man crowned by leaves lies on top of what <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> actual but gigantic strawberry, and is joined by a male and female who contemplate another equally huge strawberry.|$|E
5|$|There {{are some}} {{exceptions}} to this general rule. Gallium and germanium have higher electronegativities than aluminium and silicon respectively because of the d-block contraction. Elements of the fourth period immediately after the first row of the transition metals have unusually small atomic radii because the 3d-electrons are not effective at shielding the increased nuclear charge, and smaller atomic size correlates with higher electronegativity. The anomalously high electronegativity of lead, particularly when compared to thallium and bismuth, <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> artifact of data selection (and data availability)—methods of calculation other than the Pauling method show the normal periodic trends for these elements.|$|E

Later that night, they hear the sound of twigs snapping from all directions but assume the noises are from animals or locals. The following day, they attempt to hike back to the car, but are unable to find it before dark and make camp. That night, they again hear twigs snapping but fail to find the source of the noises.|$|E

5|$|An {{example of}} {{gravitational}} lensing {{is found in}} the radio galaxy 3C 324. First thought to be a single overluminous radio galaxy with a redshift of z=1.206, it was found in 1987 to actually be two galaxies, with the radio galaxy at the aforementioned redshift being lensed by another galaxy at redshift z=0.845. The first example of a multiply-imaged radio galaxy discovered, the source <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> elliptical galaxy with a dust lane obscuring our view of the visual and ultraviolet emission from the nucleus. In even shorter wavelengths, the BL Lac object PG 1553+113 is a heavy emitter of gamma rays. This object is the most distant found to emit photons with energies in the TeV range as of 2007. The spectrum is unique, with hard emission in some ranges of the gamma-ray spectrum in stark contrast to soft emission in others.|$|E
5|$|Patients {{and their}} guardians must be apprised of any serious risks {{and the common}} side effects of pain treatments. What <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> {{obviously}} acceptable risk or harm to a professional may be unacceptable {{to the person who}} has to undertake that risk or experience the side effect. For instance, people who experience pain on movement may be willing to forgo strong opioids in order to enjoy alertness during their painless periods, whereas others would choose around-the-clock sedation so as to remain pain-free. The care provider should not insist on treatment that someone rejects, and must not provide treatment that the provider believes is more harmful or riskier than the possible benefits can justify.|$|E
5|$|Stela 10 is on {{the north}} side of StructureA-3. It depicts Wat'ul Chatel, dressed in Terminal Classic Maya style, {{although}} his foreign-looking face bears a moustache, which is not a typically Mayan characteristic. The text on this stela displays the emblem glyphs of Tikal, Calakmul and Motul de San José, describing how he received visitors from those cities. Among the visitors are named Kan-Pet of Calakmul and Kan Ek' of Motul. Wat'ul Chatel wears a headdress associated with the patron gods of Seibal, the heron god and K'awiil, deities that were also the patrons of Palenque. This <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> attempt by this foreign king to identify himself more closely with the city he came to rule.|$|E

Quatermass and his newly appointed military superior at the British Experimental Rocket Group, Colonel Breen, {{become involved in the}} investigation when it becomes apparent that the object is an alien spacecraft. The ship and its contents have a powerful and malign influence over many of those who come in contact with it, including Quatermass. It becomes obvious to him that the aliens, probably from Mars, had been abducting pre-humans and modifying them to give them psychic abilities much like their own before returning them to Earth, a genetic legacy responsible for much of the war and strife in the world.|$|E
5|$|With a stocky, {{powerful}} build, the Exmoor pony {{is strong}} for its height, and {{noted for its}} hardiness and endurance. The chest is deep and the back broad, the croup level. The legs are short, with good bone and hard hooves. Although many sources state that the Exmoor has a distinctly different jaw structure from other horse breeds, which includes the beginnings of development of a seventh molar, this is a misunderstanding based on an incorrect translation of a German study. The study, when properly translated, refers to a feature, found in multiple horse breeds and perhaps all animals with sizable lower jaws, that <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> extra branch of blood supply in the area. While an extra tooth may have eventually developed from this extra blood supply, its frequency among the general horse population makes its appearance in the Exmoor pony unremarkable.|$|E
5|$|Back at the caves, after {{informing the}} {{survivors}} why {{they went into}} the jungle and that Dr. Arzt (Daniel Roebuck) is dead, Jack decides that he is going after Kate and Locke. Upon reaching the Hatch, he finds no one there and rappels down the shaft on his own. While exploring, he comes across a painted mural, and a wall where the key hanging around his neck is pulled by a strong magnetic force. Finally, after being surprised by a bright light and loud music, he enters what <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> underground geodesic dome with computer equipment, including an Apple II Plus computer with its prompt glowing and its shift key relabeled execute. As Jack is about to use it, Locke appears and tells Jack not to touch it. After Jack raises the gun and asks where Kate is, Locke is revealed to be at gunpoint. The gunman threatens that he will shoot Locke if Jack does not surrender. Jack refuses, instead taunting Locke about his destiny. Finally, the gunman steps out and Jack seems to recognize him. The gunman is Desmond.|$|E
