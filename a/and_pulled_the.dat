5|$|In the Philippines, chief censor Henrietta Mendez ordered cuts {{of three}} scenes {{depicting}} sexual intercourse and female nudity before the movie could {{be shown in}} theaters. Spielberg refused, <b>and</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>the</b> film from screening in Philippine cinemas, which prompted the Senate to demand {{the abolition of the}} censorship board. President Fidel V. Ramos himself intervened, ruling that the movie could be shown uncut to anyone over the age of 15.|$|E
5|$|William Bury {{was born}} in Stourbridge, Worcestershire, the {{youngest}} of four children of Henry Bury and his wife Mary Jane (née Henley). He was orphaned in infancy. His father, who worked for a local fishmonger called Joscelyne, died in a horse and cart accident in Halesowen on 10 April 1860. While on an incline, he fell beneath the wheels of his fish cart and was killed when the horse bolted <b>and</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>the</b> cart over his prone body. William's mother may have been suffering from post-natal depression {{at the time of}} her husband's death and was committed to the Worcester County Pauper and Lunatic Asylum on 7 May 1860 suffering from melancholia. She remained there until her death aged 33 on 30 March 1864.|$|E
5|$|The poor demand {{resulted}} in price cuts for various Windows RT products; in April 2013 {{the price of}} Dell's XPS 10 fell from US$450 US to $300, and Microsoft began offering free covers for its Surface tablet in some territories as a limited-time promotion—itself a US$130 value for the Type Cover alone. Microsoft also reportedly reduced the cost of Windows RT licenses for devices with smaller screens, hoping that this could spur interest in the platform. In July 2013, Microsoft cut {{the price of the}} first-generation Surface worldwide by 30%, with its U.S. price falling to $350. Concurrently, Microsoft reported a loss of US$900 million due to the lackluster sales of the device. In August 2013, Dell silently pulled the option to purchase the XPS 10 from its online store without a keyboard dock (raising its price back up to US$479), <b>and</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>the</b> device entirely in September 2013. Microsoft's discount on the Surface tablet did result in a slight increase of market share for the device; in late-August 2013, usage data from the advertising network AdDuplex (which provides advertising services within Windows Store apps) revealed that Surface usage had increased from 6.2 to 9.8%.|$|E

5|$|With Orton {{trapped in}} Bryan's {{submission}} hold, Triple H and Stephanie McMahon emerged from backstage <b>and</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>the</b> original referee {{out of the}} ring to prevent the match from ending. Triple H then sent in referee Scott Armstrong on his behalf, as Batista performed the Batista Bomb on a distracted Bryan. Armstrong made the count, but Bryan kicked out at two. A charging Batista was sent into the ring post when Bryan dodged. With no disqualifications in a triple threat match, Bryan kicked referee Armstrong in the head, following with a suicide dive {{out of the ring}} onto Triple H, Stephanie McMahon and Armstrong. Triple H tried to retaliate with a sledgehammer, but Bryan snatched it and used the sledgehammer on Triple H, knocking him off the ring apron. This ended Triple H and Stephanie McMahon's interference in the match.|$|E
5|$|The German {{troops were}} {{reluctant}} to attack head on once again, and Sergeant Vinz Kulbach pleaded with the officers of the 9th Fallschirmjäger Regiment to allow his men to flank the Americans in the dusk. Fifty men from Fusilier Regiment 27 of the 12th Volksgrenadier Division were dispatched to attack the American's southern flank through the woods. Just as Bouck was about to blow his whistle to indicate withdrawal, German soldiers penetrated their lines and began overrunning their foxholes. Several attackers were killed by grenades rigged to wires and triggered by Americans in their foxholes. Each of the positions spread out over the ridge top were overrun in turn. Surprisingly, the Germans did not simply kill the defenders in their foxholes. Bouck was pulled from his foxhole by an officer with a machine gun, {{and he thought he}} would be shot when the German put his weapon in his back <b>and</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>the</b> trigger; it was empty. Both Bouck and the German officer were then struck by bullets. The German fell seriously wounded, while Bouck was struck in the calf. Sergeant Kuhlbach asked Bouck who was in command, and Bouck replied that he was. Kuhlbach asked him why the Americans were still shooting, and Bouck said it was not his men doing it. Bouck surrendered and helped carry his wounded men down to the village.|$|E

25|$|In {{two nights}} after his 1846 pardon freeing all {{political}} prisoners, thousands of Romans with torches roamed to the Quirinal Palace, where Pius IX lived, celebrating the pope with Evvivas, speeches and music through both nights.

On the third day, when his horse-drawn carriage left the Palace {{to move to the}} Vatican, Romans unhitched the horses <b>and</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>the</b> papal carriage on their own.|$|E

Carr spread out his regiments facing north {{along the edge of}} the plateau near the tavern <b>and</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>the</b> 24th Missouri back to cover their left flank at the base of Big Mountain. The Fourth Division commander then sent the 1st Iowa Battery's four guns forward to slow the Confederate advance.|$|E
25|$|The first {{ascent of}} the Matterhorn {{was made by}} Edward Whymper, Lord Francis Douglas, Charles Hudson, Douglas Hadow, Michel Croz, and two Zermatt guides, Peter Taugwalder and his son of the same name, on 14 July 1865. Douglas, Hudson, Hadow and Croz were killed on the descent when Hadow slipped <b>and</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>the</b> other three with him down the north face. Whymper and the Taugwalder guides, who survived, were later accused of having cut the rope below {{to ensure that they}} were not dragged down with the others, but the {{subsequent}} inquiry found no evidence of this and they were acquitted.|$|E
25|$|The unique {{horizontal}} stabilizer design was free-floating; the attached small foreplane was directly {{controlled by the}} pilot <b>and</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>the</b> stabilizer up or down; so, it was aerodynamically, not mechanically controlled, and this resulted in sluggish pitch control, increasingly so at low speeds where airflow over the small foreplane was lessened, and if the project had developed further, {{it probably would have}} been replaced by a conventional all-flying tailplane. The unpredictable behavior of the design often caused pilot-induced oscillations, with the sudden and erratic deployment of leading edge slats causing the aircraft to be nearly uncontrollable much of the time.|$|E

For those who are familiar with the dark moods of certain of Marais' poems, there is a black irony here; in Zulu, Pelindaba means 'the end of the business' – although the more common interpretation is 'Place of great gatherings'.|$|E
25|$|In 1993, YTV {{obtained}} the Canadian broadcast {{rights to the}} action-adventure series Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, which aired weekday afternoons and Saturday mornings on the channel, trailing the American broadcast by several months. However, complaints {{were sent to the}} Canadian Broadcast Standards Council about the violent content, and YTV was pressured to remove the series from its lineup. Although {{not a member of the}} CBSC board, YTV complied <b>and</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>the</b> series before the end of its first season. While a phone-in poll was conducted to see if viewers wanted Mighty Morphin Power Rangers back on YTV, no further installments of the Power Rangers series aired on the channel.|$|E
25|$|In the {{meantime}} 4th Division also {{had made some}} progress. After the capture of Grosshau, the division was aided by the armored forces of the CCR. The division now headed for Gey, which was reached on 30 November, but heavily defended. Two days later the Germans mounted a counterattack out from Gey, which caused heavy casualties. The attack was only stopped by intense artillery fire. Since {{the beginning of the}} offensive, 4th Division had already lost about 6,000 men and was now unable to conduct further offensive operations. Subsequently, Collins decided to halt its offensive operations <b>and</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>the</b> division out to replace it with the 83rd Infantry Division on 3 December.|$|E

Liebeck was in the passenger's seat of a 1989 Ford Probe which did not have cup holders. Her grandson parked the car so that Liebeck could add cream and sugar to her coffee. Liebeck placed the coffee cup between her knees <b>and</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>the</b> {{far side of the}} lid toward her to remove it. In the process, she spilled the entire cup of coffee on her lap.

25|$|The grade on the {{electrified}} portion was downhill to Camden Station; therefore traffic heading southbound ("westbound", in B timetables), from Mount Royal Station, simply drifted {{through the}} tunnels. Since {{the engine was}} not working, the smoke produced was relatively light. Going upgrade northbound ("eastbound", in B timetables) the electric locomotives were coupled {{to the front of}} the train at Camden Station <b>and</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>the</b> entire train, including the steam locomotive, through the Howard Street tunnel. When northbound passenger trains stopped at Mt. Royal Station at the north end of the tunnel, the electric locomotive was uncoupled. Northbound freight trains were pulled by electric locomotives for another two miles, until reaching Huntingdon Avenue in east Baltimore. There the steam locomotive closed its cylinder cocks, took up the load, and the electric locomotive uncoupled on the fly, accelerating ahead to a pocket siding between the tracks.|$|E
25|$|By all accounts, Smith was a well-respected and even-tempered man. However Bogan's taunts {{began to}} wear on Smith, who {{eventually}} climbed down from his wagon and headed toward Bogan. As Smith walked toward Bogan, the latter stuck his hand into his coat. Smith told {{him that if he}} pulled his gun, he'd knock him to the ground. Bogan did pull his pistol, at which point Smith did knock him down with one punch. The two then wrestled briefly before Smith was able to take the young man's gun from him. As he did this, Kemp ran over producing his own handgun, and hit Smith {{in the back of the}} head. Smith then turned and pointed his pistol at Kemp, <b>and</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>the</b> trigger. However, the pistol misfired, according to witnesses, and Kemp fled at top speed. Smith turned Bogan's pistol over to the town marshal.|$|E
