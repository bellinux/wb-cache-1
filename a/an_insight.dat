5|$|Bohr and Wheeler {{set to work}} {{applying}} the liquid drop model to explain the mechanism of nuclear fission. As the experimental physicists studied fission, they uncovered puzzling results. George Placzek asked Bohr why uranium seemed to fission with both very fast and very slow neutrons. Walking to a meeting with Wheeler, Bohr had <b>an</b> <b>insight</b> that the fission at low energies {{was due to the}} uranium-235 isotope, while at high energies it was mainly due to the far more abundant uranium-238 isotope. They co-wrote two more papers on fission. Their first paper appeared in Physical Review on September 1, 1939, the day Germany invaded Poland, starting World War II in Europe.|$|E

5|$|Evidence of {{large-scale}} Mesolithic nut processing, radiocarbon dated to circa 7000BC, {{has been found}} in a midden pit at Staosnaig on Colonsay. The dig discovered the remains {{of hundreds of thousands of}} burned hazelnut shells and gives <b>an</b> <b>insight</b> into communal activity and forward planning in the period. The nuts were harvested in a single year and pollen analysis suggests that the hazel trees were all cut down at the same time. The scale of the activity, unparalleled elsewhere in Scotland, and the lack of large game on the island, suggests the possibility that Colonsay contained a community with a largely vegetarian diet for the time they spent on the island.|$|E
5|$|Following birth it was common, {{particularly}} among richer families, {{to employ a}} wet-nurse {{to care for the}} child, sometimes living in with the family. Few sources give <b>an</b> <b>insight</b> into the experiences of young children in this period. Some parents played with their children and parents demonstrated grief at their loss. The primary responsibility for bringing up young children fell on the mother. For older children, the major duty of parents was, according to the Kirk, to ensure the spiritual development of the child, with fathers leading daily family prayers, {{but it is not clear}} how widely these practices were adopted.|$|E

Gottesman and Shields have built models to explain the cause, transmission, and progression of the disorder, which is controlled by many genes acting {{in concert with the}} environment, with no cause sufficient by itself.|$|E

The main purpose of the council is to give the pastor <b>an</b> <b>insight</b> into what the parish community thinks and how it feels about different issues.

5|$|Race meetings, concert parties (including drag acts– good drag queens were {{in great}} demand), {{trips to the}} seaside and {{football}} matches were organised to keep men entertained.

5|$|The 27 {{minutes that}} had been played the {{previous}} day had given Liverpool manager Bill Shankly <b>an</b> <b>insight</b> into Borussia defensive vulnerability in the air.

In the 21st minute Peter Cormack's throw-in on the right fed Chris Lawler to cross to the back post. Toshack's header across the penalty area set up Kevin Keegan's headed opening goal.|$|E
