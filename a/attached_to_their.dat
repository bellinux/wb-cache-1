5|$|A glitch was {{observed}} by players on Xbox 360 where, {{if they were}} playing while online and had exactly 100 friends <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> account, the game would freeze and/or they {{would be unable to}} play online. Activision issued a patch to correct this a few days after release.|$|E
5|$|During {{his career}} he {{wrestled}} seven different world champions, including six time limit draws. At one point, he wrestled Giant Baba in Japan {{in front of}} a crowd of 45,000 people. He also participated in numerous chain matches, in which he and an opponent were joined together by a steel chain <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> wrists.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} portray the {{characters}} underwater, the actors wore Heelys wheeled footwear, which simulate the gliding action of swimming creatures. The actors playing Ariel and the other merfolk had wire-frame tails <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> hips. Subsequent productions feature different designs for Ariel and the merfolk; the Dutch and Japanese productions use wirework and aerial stunts {{to create the illusion}} of underwater swimming.|$|E

5|$|Active and cheerful, the Russian Toy was {{originally}} bred {{both as an}} anti-rat dog and a watch dog. The second quality is still active in the breed, {{and they can be}} very vocal. They can become quite <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> family, regardless of the ages of the family members. Russian Toys are usually very reserved with strangers, but very loyal to their owners, always ready to protect them from any perceived danger.|$|E
5|$|Christopher {{had three}} more {{children}} with Olivia. As money was now tight, Olivia insisted that her stepchildren {{put to work}} rather than receive schooling. The Colt brothers became <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> one surviving sister, Sarah Ann, who acted as a surrogate mother of sorts, until she was sent off to a relative's house {{to work as a}} menial. John was known to keep locks of hair belonging to her and Margaret all through his life.|$|E
5|$|Insects are {{the only}} {{invertebrates}} to have developed active flight capability, and this has {{played an important role}} in their success. Their muscles are able to contract multiple times for each single nerve impulse, allowing the wings to beat faster than would ordinarily be possible. Having their muscles <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> exoskeletons is more efficient and allows more muscle connections; crustaceans also use the same method, though all spiders use hydraulic pressure to extend their legs, a system inherited from their pre-arthropod ancestors. Unlike insects, though, most aquatic crustaceans are biomineralized with calcium carbonate extracted from the water.|$|E
50|$|Nematodes are {{infected}} by C. rosea when the fungus' conidia <b>attach</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> cuticle and germinate, {{going on to}} produce germ tubes which penetrate the host's body and kill it.|$|R

5|$|Monkey Fight: One to {{four players}} {{simultaneously}} engage in combat by rolling {{in any direction}} with the analog stick and using the A button to punch opponents with a boxing glove <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> monkey's ball. Points are awarded for knocking opponents {{off one of the}} three available arenas, with more points being awarded when the player currently in the lead is knocked off. The player with the most points is declared the winner of a round when the in-game timer reaches zero. Items can be used to extend the reach, size, and strength of one's boxing glove.|$|E
5|$|Olivia and Peter learn Greg {{was being}} treated for a sleep disorder, and that his dreams had {{involved}} demons until they stopped several months ago. Another hallucinating victim turns up in Seattle and dies. The Fringe team discover that both victims had a brainâ€“computer interface chip <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> thalamus, {{the part of the}} brain controlling dreams. Broyles (Lance Reddick) and Nina (Blair Brown) reveal new information leading to the sleep researcher Dr. Nayak (Ravi Kapoor) who implanted the chips. Another victim named Diana (Jovanna Huguet) hallucinates at a restaurant and kills a coworker before similarly dying of exhaustion.|$|E
5|$|Zoology is {{discussed}} in Books VIII to XI. The encyclopedia mentions different sources of purple dye, particularly the murex snail, the highly prized source of Tyrian purple. It describes the elephant and hippopotamus in detail, {{as well as the}} value and origin of the pearl and the invention of fish farming and oyster farming. The keeping of aquariums was a popular pastime of the rich, and Pliny provides anecdotes of the problems of owners becoming too closely <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> fish.|$|E
50|$|Tiznit is {{the place}} of {{manufacture}} of the finest jewels of the South of Morocco. There are daggers, horse saddles, Fantasia rifles, anklets, pendants that women <b>attach</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> chests or foreheads all decorated with semi-precious stones and enamels.|$|R
50|$|Structural {{adjustment}} policies {{emerged from}} two of the Bretton Woods institutions, the IMF and the World Bank. They emerged from the conditionality that IMF and World Bank have been <b>attaching</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> loans since the early 1950s. Initially, these conditions focused on a country's macroeconomic policy.|$|R
5000|$|Nubians are {{remarkable}} in temperate zones of agriculture {{in being able}} to deal with temperatures as low as [...] with open faced shelters.

5|$|Territory size {{is highly}} variable, ranging {{from less than}} 40km2 in the Ngorongoro Crater to over 1,000km2 in the Kalahari. Home ranges are defended through vocal displays, scent marking and {{boundary}} patrols. Clans mark their territories by either pasting or pawing in special latrines located on clan range boundaries. Clan boundaries are usually respected; hyenas chasing prey have been observed to stop dead in their tracks once their prey crosses into another clan's range. Hyenas will however ignore clan boundaries in times of food shortage. Males {{are more likely to}} enter another clan's territory than females are, as they are less <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> natal group and will leave it when in search of a mate. Hyenas travelling in another clan's home range typically exhibit bodily postures associated with fear, particularly when meeting other hyenas. An intruder can be accepted into another clan after {{a long period of time}} if it persists in wandering into the clan's territory, dens or kills.|$|E
5|$|The {{defense of}} Lima Site 85 was {{assigned}} to two CIA paramilitary officers who led about 1,000 Hmong soldiers, with 200 men guarding the ridge line and the remaining 800 in the valley below. They were reinforced by a Thai Border Patrol Police battalion of 300 men. In {{the first week of}} 1968, the combined North Vietnamese and Pathet Lao forces probed Royal Laos Army positions in the area by launching several artillery attacks. On 10January, a Pathet Lao patrol was driven from the area by the Hmong soldiers. Fearing the explosives <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> equipment could be detonated by incoming artillery rounds, U.S. technicians dismantled the charges and threw them over the cliff.|$|E
5|$|Alprazolam is classed as a high-potency triazolo{{benzodiazepine}}: a benzodiazepine with a triazole ring {{attached to}} its structure. As a benzodiazepine, alprazolam produces {{a variety of}} therapeutic and adverse effects by binding to the benzodiazepine receptor site on the GABAA receptor and modulating its function; GABA receptors are the most prolific inhibitory receptor within the brain. The GABA chemical and receptor system mediates inhibitory or calming effects of alprazolam on the nervous system. The GABAA receptor {{is made up of}} 5 subunits out of a possible 19, and GABAA receptors made up of different combinations of subunits have different properties, different locations within the brain, and, importantly, different activities with regard to benzodiazepines. Alprazolam and other triazolobenzodiazepines like triazolam that have a triazol ring <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> structure appear to have antidepressant properties, since the structure resembles that of tricyclic antidepressants, which also have rings. Alprazolam causes a marked suppression of the hypothalamicpituitary-adrenal axis. The therapeutic properties of alprazolam are similar to other benzodiazepines and include anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, muscle relaxant, hypnotic and amnesic; however, it is used mainly as an anxiolytic.|$|E
5000|$|Triphysaria pusilla is {{an annual}} herb {{producing}} a hairy brownish or purple-colored, multibranched stem {{up to about}} 20 centimeters in maximum height. Like many species in its family, it is a facultative root parasite on other plants, <b>attaching</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> roots via haustoria to tap nutrients.|$|R
25|$|Females {{make two}} types of {{foraging}} trips: to collect pollen or nesting materials. They typically forage for pollen in the morning, <b>to</b> provision <b>their</b> nests. They will also search for building materials for a nest, including bark and resin, which they <b>attach</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> corbicula when flying back to the nest.|$|R
50|$|Wooxie {{provides}} its own photo service. Users {{have the}} ability <b>to</b> upload <b>their</b> photo content <b>to</b> <b>their</b> updates and this will <b>attach</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> account. They will then {{have the chance to}} mark each photo as a business photo or one that is personal. These photos can then be restricted to certain individuals, helping to secure private photo content.|$|R
5|$|For grieving {{parents who}} form {{emotional}} bonds with reborn dolls, some child bereavement counselors advise against parents substituting their deceased child with the dolls. Reborn mothers contend {{that they are}} not replacing children but remembering them. Psychiatrist Sue Varma, teacher at the NYU school of medicine, says mothering reborn dolls rather than just collecting them can become a problem when it is used as prop and becomes the person's only form of socializing. Psychiatrist Gail Saltz with New York Presbyterian Hospital supports the use of reborns for people who do not want to make the commitment of having a real child, and also to comfort bereaved parents. She offers that in this case the reborn may symbolize a step in the grieving process. Concern should only come if someone who lost a baby grows too <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> reborn because it could indicate their grief is not getting resolved. In this case, the likeness of the doll to the deceased child risks being harmful as a permanent replacement for the grieving parents. Ian James, a doctor at the Centre for the Health of the Elderly at Newcastle General Hospital in the U.K., said that holding the dolls helps calm elderly residents, helping them feel peaceful and quiet.|$|E
5|$|Like {{those of}} other sauropods, the neck {{vertebrae}} are deeply bifurcated; they carried neural spines with a large trough in the middle, resulting in a wide, deep neck. The vertebral formula for the holotype of A.louisae is 15cervicals, 10dorsals, 5sacrals, and 82caudals. The caudal vertebra number may vary, even within species. The cervical vertebrae of Apatosaurus and Brontosaurus are stouter and more robust than {{those of other}} diplodocids and {{were found to be}} most similar to Camarasaurus by Charles Whitney Gilmore. In addition, they support cervical ribs that extend farther towards the ground than in diplodocines, and have vertebrae and ribs that are narrower towards the top of the neck, making the neck nearly triangular in cross-section. In Apatosaurus louisae, the atlas-axis complex of the first cervicals is nearly fused. The dorsal ribs are not fused or tightly <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> vertebrae and are instead loosely articulated. Apatosaurus has ten dorsal ribs {{on either side of the}} body. The large neck was filled with an extensive system of weight-saving air sacs. Apatosaurus, like its close relative Supersaurus, has tall neural spines, which make up more than half the height of the individual bones of its vertebrae. The shape of the tail is unusual for a diplodocid; it is comparatively slender because of the rapidly decreasing height of the vertebral spines with increasing distance from the hips. Apatosaurus also had very long ribs compared to most other diplodocids, giving it an unusually deep chest. As in other diplodocids, the tail transformed into a whip-like structure towards the end.|$|E
5|$|Nectar-eating bats have {{acquired}} specialized adaptations. These bats possess long muzzles and long, extensible tongues covered in fine bristles that aid them in feeding on particular flowers and plants. The tube-lipped nectar bat (Anoura fistulata) has the longest tongue of any mammal relative to its body size. This is beneficial {{to them in}} terms of pollination and feeding. Their long, narrow tongues can reach deep into the long cup shape of some flowers. When the tongue retracts, it coils up inside the rib cage. However, because of these features, nectar-feeding bats cannot easily turn to other food sources in times of scarcity, making them more prone to extinction than any other type of bat. Nectar feeding also aids a variety of plants, since these bats serve as pollinators (as pollen can get <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> fur while they are feeding). Around 500 species of flowering plant rely on bat pollination and thus tend to open their flowers at night. Rainforests are said to benefit the most from bat pollination, because of the large variety of plants that depend on it.|$|E
5000|$|DLDI (or Dynamically-Linked Device Interface) is a {{technology}} created by Michael [...] "Chishm" [...] Chisholm as an interface for libfat that developers <b>attach</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> projects. libfat is programmed {{in a single}} language, but different flashcarts, such as the R4DS, use different read/write commands. The DLDI Patch fixes this, as explained below.|$|R
50|$|These bats weigh 222-362 g. Their forearms are 120 mm long. Their fur is uniformly tan and thick, {{sometimes}} hiding their ears. Their {{eyes are}} distinctly orange, which helps distinguish this species from other Fijian megabats. <b>Their</b> wings <b>attach</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> bodies closer <b>to</b> the spine {{as opposed to}} lateral attachment. They lack tails.|$|R
5000|$|Those cadets of {{military}} academies, and military officers who have attended the Nunziatella have finally the right <b>to</b> <b>attach</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> uniforms a special triangular distinctive, blue, edged {{with red and}} marked [...] "Military School Nunziatella", the center of which is reported the historical kepi uniform worn by students for activities off duty and parade.|$|R
5|$|The {{next step}} is to apply hair. The hair can either be done in one of two ways; wigging, rooting or microrooting. when rooting hair is added 1-4 hair strands per plug. When microrooting, hair is added strand by strand. This can take up to 30 or more hours per head. Once the hair is finished, the {{original}} vinyl body is weighted with a soft stuffed body filled with pellets/fine glass beads/fiberfill.The weight corresponds with its age to achieve a real effect. Various additions also can be added to give the doll an even more life like appearance. Reborns heads are often weighted, so that owners have to support the head like one would a real newborn. Purchasers can have magnets attached inside the mouth or head for attaching a pacifier or hair bows. Electronic devices that mimic a heart beat, or make the chest rise and fall to simulate breathing are common. Reborns can come with an umbilical cord, baby fat, heat packs to make the reborn warm to the touch, or voice boxes that mimic infant sounds. For preemie dolls, they may come in incubators with a breathing apparatus <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> nose.|$|E
5|$|Wind {{dispersal}} of seeds, or anemochory, {{is one of}} the more primitive means of dispersal. Wind dispersal can take on one of two primary forms: seeds can float on the breeze or alternatively, they can flutter to the ground. The classic examples of these dispersal mechanisms include dandelions (Taraxacum spp., Asteraceae), which have a feathery pappus <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> seeds and can be dispersed long distances, and maples (Acer (genus) spp., Sapindaceae), which have winged seeds and flutter to the ground. An important constraint on wind dispersal is the need for abundant seed production to maximize the likelihood of a seed landing in a site suitable for germination. There are also strong evolutionary constraints on this dispersal mechanism. For instance, species in the Asteraceae on islands tended to have reduced dispersal capabilities (i.e., larger seed mass and smaller pappus) relative to the same species on the mainland. Reliance upon wind dispersal is common among many weedy or ruderal species. Unusual mechanisms of wind dispersal include tumbleweeds. A related process to anemochory is anemophily, which is the process where pollen is distributed by wind. Large families of plants are pollinated in this manner, which is favored when individuals of the dominant plant species are spaced closely together.|$|E
5|$|On April 22, 2008 {{the newly}} {{established}} tropical cyclone warning centre in Jakarta, Indonesia named its first system: Durga, before two sets of Indonesian names were established for their area of responsibility ahead of the 2008â€“09 season. At {{the same time the}} Australian Bureau of Meteorology, merged their three lists into one national list of names. The issue of tropical cyclones being renamed when they moved across 90Â°E into the South-West Indian Ocean, was subsequently brought up during October 2008 at the 18th session of the RA I Tropical Cyclone Committee. However, it was decided to postpone the matter until the following committee meeting so that various consultations could take place. During the 2009 Tropical Cyclone RSMCs/TCWCs Technical Coordination Meeting, it was reaffirmed that a tropical cyclone name should be retained throughout a system's lifetime, including when moving from one basin to another, to avoid confusion. As a result, it was proposed at the following year's RA I tropical cyclone committee, that systems stopped being renamed when they moved into the South-West Indian Ocean from the Australian region. It was subsequently agreed that during an interim period, cyclones that moved into the basin would have a name <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> existing name, before it was stopped {{at the start of the}} 2012â€“13 season. Tropical Cyclone Bruce was subsequently the first tropical cyclone not to be renamed, when it moved into the South-West Indian Ocean during 2013-14. During March 12, 2010, public and private weather services in Southern Brazil, decided to name a tropical storm Anita in order to avoid confusion in future references. A naming list was subsequently set up by the Brazilian Navy Hydrographic Center with the names Arani, Bapo and Cari subsequently taken from that list during 2011 and 2015.|$|E
5|$|In some colonial polyps, a chitinous {{periderm}} gives {{support and}} some protection to the connecting sections {{and to the}} lower parts of individual polyps. Stony corals secrete massive calcium carbonate exoskeletons. A few polyps collect materials such as sand grains and shell fragments, which they <b>attach</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> outsides. Some colonial sea anemones stiffen the mesoglea with sediment particles.|$|R
25|$|In 1990, FWP {{implemented}} Stage 2 of {{its management}} plan. Every float group {{now had to}} have a permit, obtained at Camp Baker, which they had <b>to</b> <b>attach</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> watercraft. By issuing permits only at Camp Baker, this system effectively limited the number of floaters to only those groups prepared to spend four days on the river.|$|R
50|$|At birth {{the species}} are {{equipped}} with distinctive milk teeth {{that appear to be}} useless as tools for eating solid food, but help them <b>attach</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> mother's teats.
