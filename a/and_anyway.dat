500|$|In June 1913, a sixteen-year-old Californian with {{no formal}} musical {{training}} wrote a solo piano piece, Adventures in Harmony, employing [...] "primitive tone clusters." [...] Henry Cowell would soon {{emerge as the}} seminal figure in promoting the cluster harmonic technique. Ornstein abandoned the concert stage in the early 1920s <b>and,</b> <b>anyway,</b> clusters had served him as practical harmonic devices, not {{as part of a}} larger theoretical mission. In the case of Ives, clusters comprised a relatively small part of his compositional output, much of which went unheard for years. For the intellectually ambitious Cowell—who heard Ornstein perform in New York in 1916—clusters were crucial to the future of music. He set out to explore their [...] "overall, cumulative, and often programmatic effects." ...|$|E
500|$|Julie Emery from Heat criticised Fatboy's fashion sense, {{especially}} from the episode broadcast on 12 May 2011, saying [...] "We know clashing prints are soooooo this season, but really, Fatboy, they do nothing for you. And while we're at it, stop wearing that tinny 'F' round your neck, for flip's sake. You're not a gangster rapper, <b>and</b> <b>anyway</b> your real name's Arthur." [...] Emery also said the storyline where Fatboy asks Mercy to marry him so she {{can stay in the}} country sounded [...] "somewhat familiar", as Coronation Street was featuring a similar storyline at the same time. Amy Duncan from the Metro said Fatboy was one of her favourite young characters in EastEnders and said that, with Poppy, he [...] "bring some much-needed light into the soap". Vicky Prior from the Metro said that Fatboy [...] "is easily one of the best characters in EastEnders, able to interact seamlessly with other characters, both young and old." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} immediately after Johnston finished the Britain's Got Talent live tour over a six-week period in London. The track listing, which contained both religious and popular songs, {{was chosen by}} Cowell; Johnston said [...] "I hadn't sung many of the tracks before. But I knew them all <b>and,</b> <b>anyway,</b> I like a challenge." [...] Johnston described recording the album as [...] "great", and said [...] "All I’ve ever wanted {{to do is go}} into a studio and record an album and it was everything I’ve ever dreamed of." [...] Johnson recorded [...] "Walking in the Air" [...] as a duet with fellow Britain's Got Talent contestant Faryl Smith, and the song was tipped as a potential Christmas number-one. The recording was finished by September 2008, after which Johnston began to make appearances to publicise the release, including appearances on GMTV, Channel 5 News, BBC Breakfast, This Morning and Radio 2's Friday Night Is Music Night. In preparation for the album's promotion, Johnston received confidence tutoring. He said that [...] "I've got no confidence and sometimes people get on at me for being moody so I've had some help with that." [...] Johnston also received vocal training from Yvie Burnett, who was, at the time, coaching Leona Lewis and Leon Jackson, and with whom Smith trained during Britain's Got Talent. The album was produced by Nigel Wright.|$|E

500|$|Wright {{initially}} rejected Lovecraft's [...] "The Call of Cthulhu", {{but eventually}} bought it, and printed {{it in the}} February 1928 issue. [...] This was the first tale of the Cthulhu Mythos, a fictional universe in which Lovecraft set several stories. [...] Over time other writers began to contribute their own stories with the same shared background, including Frank Belknap Long, August Derleth, E. Hoffman Price, and Donald Wandrei. [...] Robert E. Howard and Clark Ashton Smith were friends of Lovecraft's, but did not contribute Cthulhu stories; instead Howard wrote sword and sorcery fiction, and Smith produced a series of high fantasy stories, {{many of which were}} part of his Hyperborean cycle. [...] Robert Bloch, later to become well known as the writer of the movie Psycho, began publishing stories in Weird Tales in 1935; he was a fan of Lovecraft's work, and asked Lovecraft's permission to include Lovecraft as a character in one of his stories, and to kill the character off. [...] Lovecraft gave him permission, and reciprocated by killing off a thinly disguised version of Bloch in one of his own stories not long afterwards. Edmond Hamilton, a leading early writer of space opera, became a regular, and Wright also published science fiction stories by J. Schlossel and Otis Adelbert Kline. [...] Tennessee Williams' first sale was to Weird Tales, with a short story titled [...] "The Vengeance of Nitocris". This was published in the August 1928 issue under the author's real name, Thomas Lanier Williams.Weird Tales subtitle was [...] "The Unique Magazine", and Wright's story selections were as varied as the subtitle promised; he was willing to print strange or bizarre stories with no hint [...] of the fantastic if they were unusual enough to fit in the magazine. [...] Although Wright's editorial standards were broad, and although he personally disliked the restrictions that convention placed on what he could publish, he did exercise caution when presented with material that might offend his readership. [...] E. Hoffman Price records that his story [...] "Stranger from Kurdistan" [...] was held after purchase for six months before Wright printed it in the July 1925 issue; the story includes a scene in which Christ and Satan meet, and Wright was worried about the possible reader reaction. [...] The story nevertheless proved to be very popular, and Wright reprinted it in the December 1929 issue. [...] He also published [...] "The Infidel's Daughter" [...] by Price, a satire of the Ku Klux Klan, which drew an angry letter and a cancelled subscription from a Klan member. [...] Price later recalled Wright's response: [...] "a story that arouses controversy is good for circulation... <b>and</b> <b>anyway</b> it would be worth a reasonable loss to rap bigots of that caliber". [...] Wright also printed George Fielding Eliot's [...] "The Copper Bowl", a story about a young woman being tortured; she dies when her torturer forces a rat to eat through her body. [...] Weinberg suggests that the story was so gruesome {{that it would have been}} difficult to place in a magazine even fifty years later.|$|E

Armando Pinelli, the Leonardo da Vinci set out on her maiden voyage from Genoa to New York City, where she {{received}} the traditional festive welcome accorded liners arriving in the city for the first time. [...] Soon after she entered service, the Italian Line announced that by 1965 at latest the ship would be refit to run on nuclear power. [...] This however did not come to pass, <b>and</b> <b>anyway</b> {{at the time of the}} announcement it was already known to executives of the company that by 1965 the Leonardo da Vinci would be supplanted on the North Atlantic service by the new SS Michelangelo and SS Raffaello, the planning for which already had started in 1958.|$|E
2500|$|In 1808 Gallatin {{proposed}} a dramatic $20 million program of internal improvements—that is, roads and canals along the Atlantic seacoast {{and across the}} Appalachian mountain barrier to be financed by the federal government. This was something new, and many considered it outright unconstitutional. It {{was rejected by the}} [...] "Old Republican" [...] faction of his party that deeply distrusted the national government, <b>and</b> <b>anyway</b> there was no money to pay for it. Most of Gallatin's proposals were eventually carried out years later, but this was done not by the concerted federal action he proposed, but by local governmental and private action. Though often wasteful, this method enlisted local and private energies in large enterprises. While not a pacifist, he strongly opposed building up a navy and endorsed Jefferson's scheme of using small gunboats to protect major ports. The plan failed in the War of 1812 as the British, unhindered, landed behind the harbors.|$|E

2500|$|Abbess’s initial {{idea for}} the film was his fondness for the name ‘Gabriel.’ He and co-writer Matt Hylton Todd {{researched}} angels and demons in various religions, drawing figures from Christianity, Judaism, Zoroastrianism, and Islam as well as John Milton’s Paradise Lost. The writers chose their favourite seven angels and favourite seven demons to create an [...] "all-star" [...] supernatural battle. Abbess says, [...] "There hadn’t really been a movie about angels. Not like this. I hadn’t even seen Constantine at the time, nor the one with Christopher Walken (The Prophecy) in it, {{so as far as}} I knew – <b>and,</b> <b>anyway,</b> this is very different from those – it hadn’t been done before." [...] The writers were interested in the backstory and mythology of purgatory, and aimed to focus more on the characters than the special effects. Gabriel was deliberately designed to be commercial and [...] "franchiseable." [...] It was written as the first part of a trilogy, and, if financially successful, will be followed by two sequels that will explore the world outside purgatory.|$|E
2500|$|Castlereagh's {{challenge}} at {{the foreign}} office was to organise and finance an alliance to destroy Napoleon. He successfully brought Napoleon's enemies {{together at the}} Treaty of Chaumont in 1814. Thereafter he worked with Europe's leaders at the Congress of Vienna to provide a peace consistent with the conservative mood of the day. At Vienna he was largely successful in his primary goal of creating a peace settlement that would endure for years. He saw that a harsh treaty based on vengeance and retaliation against France would fail, <b>and</b> <b>anyway</b> the conservative Bourbons were back in power. He employed his diplomatic skills to block harsh terms. [...] He held the Chaumont allies together, most notably in their determination to finally end Napoleon's 100 Days in 1815. He {{had a vision of}} long-term peace in Europe the united efforts of the great powers. At the same time he was watchful of Britain's mercantile and imperial interests. He purchased the Cape Colony and Ceylon from the Netherlands. France's colonies were returned, but France had to give up all its gains in Europe after 1791. He also worked to abolish the international slave trade. He was unsuccessful in avoiding the War of 1812 with the United States; it ended in a stalemate in 1814, with no boundary changes. After 1815 Castlereagh was the leader in imposing repressive measures at home. [...] He was hated for his harsh attacks on liberty and reform. However, in 1919 diplomatic historians recommended his wise policies of 1814–1815 to the British delegation to the peace conferences that ended the First World War.

2500|$|I {{think it}} was the first summer I was at Harvard as a student, and I {{discovered}} a wonderful bookstore there where I could get modern poetry – which I'd never been able to lay my hands on very much until then – and they had the original edition of The Darkening Ecliptic with the Sidney Nolan cover. [...] I always had a taste for sort of wild experimental poetry – of which there really wasn't very much in English in America at the time – and this poet suited me very well. [...] I am obliged to give a final examination in my poetry writing course , which I'm always rather hard put to do, since we haven't really studied anything. The students have been writing poems of varying degrees of merit, and though I give them reading lists they tend to ignore them, after first demanding them. And the way the course is set up {{there is no way of}} examining them on their reading. <b>And</b> <b>anyway</b> they shouldn't have to pass an examination because they're poets who are writing poetry, and I don't like the idea of grading poems. So in order to pass the examination time I had to think of various subterfuges, and one of them is to use one of Malley's poems and another forbiddingly modern poem – frequently one of Geoffrey Hill's 'Mercian Hymns'. And asking them if they can guess which one is the real poem by a respected contemporary poet, and which one is a put-on intended to ridicule modern poetry, and what are their reasons. And I think they are right about fifty per cent of the time, identifying the fraud... fraudulent poem.|$|E
