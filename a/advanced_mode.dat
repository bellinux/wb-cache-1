25|$|The spadenose shark (Scoliodon laticaudus) is {{a species}} of requiem shark, {{and part of the}} family Carcharhinidae. It is common in the {{tropical}} Indian and western Pacific Oceans, where it forms large schools in shallow water. A small shark reaching a length of , the spadenose shark is named for its distinctively flattened, triangular snout. It is a predator of small bony fishes and invertebrates. This species exhibits the most <b>advanced</b> <b>mode</b> of viviparity of any fish, in which the developed embryos form a highly complex placental connection to the mother at a very small size. Females breed year-round, giving birth to six to 18 pups after a gestation period of five to six months. The spadenose shark is harmless to humans and is valued by artisanal and commercial fishers for its meat and fins. Its abundance ensures it forms a significant component of many fisheries in South and Southeast Asia. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed this species as Near Threatened.|$|E
500|$|GameSpot noted, in {{its initial}} review of Portal, that many {{solutions}} exist for completing each puzzle, {{and that the}} gameplay [...] "gets even crazier, and the diagrams shown in the trailer showed some incredibly crazy {{things that you can}} attempt." [...] Two additional modes are unlocked upon the completion of the game that challenge the player to work out alternative methods of solving each test chamber. Challenge maps are unlocked near the halfway point and Advanced Chambers are unlocked when the game is completed. In Challenge mode, levels are revisited with the added goal of completing the test chamber either with as little time, with the least number of portals, or with the fewest footsteps possible. In <b>Advanced</b> <b>mode,</b> certain levels are made more complex with the addition of more obstacles and hazards.|$|E

2500|$|Like most {{commuter}} railroads in the Northeastern United States, MBTA is a NORAC Railroad {{and uses}} the Rulebook promulgated by that organization. Much of the MBTA Commuter Rail system is Rule 251 territory, as the tracks are signalled for movement in one direction of travel only. [...] During the 1990s, parts of the system, such as the Framingham/Worcester Line, were re-signalled to allow a more <b>advanced</b> <b>mode</b> of operations known as NORAC Rule 261, which allows trains to operate in either direction on both tracks where double track is available.

Like in KOF '97, the player has a choice between two playing styles: Advance and Extra, with a few slight modifications to <b>Advance</b> <b>mode</b> (unlike in KOF '97, the character will resume to normal if the player performs a Super Special Move in MAX state). This time when one character loses a round, the losing team is given a handicap in its favor. In <b>Advance</b> <b>mode,</b> {{this means that the}} players stock capacity for Power Gauges is increased by one.

40|$|In {{order to}} reveal the factor impact on the <b>advanced</b> {{manufacturing}} <b>mode</b> diffusion, the influence of various factors in the diffusion process is studied {{from the perspective of}} system dynamics. To this end, firstly, factors in the <b>advanced</b> manufacturing <b>mode</b> diffusion are identified, which include both macro and micro factors from the perspective of whole industry and single enterprise respectively. Secondly, based on the factor analysis and system dynamics, both a macro and a micro system dynamic model of the <b>advanced</b> manufacturing <b>mode</b> diffusion are established. Then, the models are simulated by Vensim, and different parameter settings of the models are discussed. And then, the sensitivity analysis of factors is conducted.

40|$|Subject to a {{compressive}} membrane stress, {{an elastic}} film bonded on a substrate can become unstable, forming wrinkles, creases or delaminated buckles. Further increasing the compressive stress can induce <b>advanced</b> <b>modes</b> of instabilities including period-doubles, folds, localized ridges, delamination, and coexistent instabilities. While various instabilities in film-substrate systems under compression have been analyzed separately, a systematic and quantitative {{understanding of these}} instabilities is still elusive. Here we present a joint experimental and theoretical study to systematically explore the instabil-ities in elastic film-substrate systems under uniaxial compression. We use the Maxwell stability criterion to analyze the occurrence and evolution of instabilities analogous to phase transitions in thermodynamic systems. We show that the moduli of the film and the substrate, the film-substrate adhesion strength, the film thickness, and the prestretch in the substrate determine various modes of instabilities. Defects in the film-substrate system can facilitate it to overcome energy barriers during occurrence and evolution of instabil-ities. We provide a set of phase diagrams to predict both initial and <b>advanced</b> <b>modes</b> of instabilities in compressed film-substrate systems. The phase diagrams {{can be used to}} guide the design of film-substrate systems to achieve desired modes of instabilities. [DOI: 10. 1115 / 1. 4025828]...|$|R
