This means that instructors should first introduce the basic ideas that give life and form to any topic or subject area, and then revisit and build upon these repeatedly.

Having worked {{together}} twice before on The Good Life and Someone Like Me, Carey joined up with Helford {{and told him}} he wanted to develop his own show. They each came up with various ideas and created The Drew Carey Show. Carey later told a group of television critics at the network launch that the series was originally going to be called The Drew F...ing Carey Show, saying [...] "We were going to call it The Drew F.

500|$|The Frenchman took {{a sabbatical}} in 1992 after {{being fired from}} Ferrari for {{publicly}} criticizing {{the car and the}} team, while the Brazilian struggled as McLaren was no longer competitive with Williams. Prost announced his signing with Williams for the upcoming 1993 season. Senna had wanted to join Williams too, as they were the most competitive, but Prost had a clause in his contract forbidding the Brazilian as a teammate. An infuriated Senna called the Frenchman a [...] "coward" [...] during a press conference at Estoril, and decried his unwillingness to compete for the Drivers' Championship on equal sporting terms: I think if Prost wants to be called the sole champion, three-times world champion, come back in a sportive way, maybe win another championship, he should be sportive. The way he's doing, he's behaving like a coward. And if he wants to be sportive, he must be prepared to race <b>anybody,</b> <b>at</b> any condition, at equal terms.|$|E

500|$|In the 2012 presidential campaign, {{during which}} he {{acknowledged}} {{it was unlikely that}} he would win the Republican Party nomination, Paul again asserted that he was participating in the Republican Party on his own terms, trying to persuade the rest of the party to move toward his positions rather than joining in with theirs. He expressed doubt that he would support any of his rivals should they win the nomination, warning that, “If the policies of the Republican Party are the same as the Democrat Party and they don't want to change anything on foreign policy, they don't want to cut anything, they don't want to audit the Fed and find out about monetary policy, they don't want to have actual change in government, that is a problem for me." [...] On that same theme he said in another interview, [...] "I would be reluctant to jump on board and tell all of the supporters that have given me trust and money that all of a sudden, I'd say, [...] we've done is for naught. So, let's support <b>anybody</b> <b>at</b> all … even if they disagree with everything that we do." ...|$|E

We lived next door, {{and for a long time}} my mother never got to like it, and at first I disliked it, and then after about a year or so I got used to it, and then I got absorbed in it, then I got infatuated with it. Then I began to wonder if anyone had ever done it. Seriously, not one or two, but seriously; and it seemed to me by that time that it was a very fine industrial subject matter. And I couldn't see <b>anybody</b> <b>at</b> that time who had done it – and nobody had done it, it seemed." ...|$|E
2500|$|The film {{generated}} controversy for its {{depiction of}} the National Transportation Safety Board as antagonistic. In a promotional video preceding the release, Eastwood claimed that the NTSB had [...] "railroaded" [...] Sullenberger by [...] "trying to paint the picture {{that he had done}} the wrong thing." [...] After its release, NTSB investigators objected to their portrayal. Christine Negroni wrote in The New York Times that [...] "the film's version of the inquiry veers from the official record in both tone and substance", depicting the investigators as [...] "departing from standard protocol in airline accident inquiries" [...] and [...] "prosecutorial and closed-minded". NTSB lead investigator John Balzano disputed the depiction, saying that investigators [...] "weren't out to embarrass <b>anybody</b> <b>at</b> all", and a former NTSB investigator expressed concern that moviegoers would take it as evidence of [...] "government incompetence".|$|E

2500|$|Stewart's [...] "Rod the Mod" [...] image gained wider {{visibility}} in November 1965, {{when he was}} {{the subject}} of a 30-minute Rediffusion, London television documentary titled [...] "An Easter with Rod" [...] that portrayed the Mod scene. His parallel solo career attempts continued on EMI's Columbia label with the November 1965 release of [...] "The Day Will Come", a more heavily arranged pop attempt, and the April 1966 release of his take on Sam Cooke's [...] "Shake", with the Brian Auger Trinity. Both failed commercially and neither gained positive notices. Stewart had spent the better part of two years listening mostly to Cooke; he later said, [...] "I didn't sound like <b>anybody</b> <b>at</b> all ... but I knew I sounded a bit like Sam Cooke, so I listened to Sam Cooke." [...] This recording solidified that singer's position as Stewart's idol and most enduring influence; he called it a [...] "crossing of the water." ...|$|E
2500|$|Secretary of Defense Gates {{summarized}} fundamental {{concerns with}} the practicality {{of the program}} concept: [...] "I don't know <b>anybody</b> <b>at</b> the Department of Defense, Mr. Tiahrt, who thinks that this program should, or would, ever be operationally deployed. The reality is that you would need a laser something like 20 to 30 times {{more powerful than the}} chemical laser in the plane right now {{to be able to get}} any distance from the launch site to fire....So, right now the ABL would have to orbit inside the borders of Iran in order to be able to try and use its laser to shoot down that missile in the boost phase. And if you were to operationalize this you would be looking at 10 to 20 747s, at a billion and a half dollars apiece, and $100 million a year to operate. And there's nobody in uniform that I know who believes that this is a workable concept." ...|$|E
2500|$|Although the bananas {{were present}} at Maine Road matches, the bigger {{inflatable}} displays were generally reserved for away matches, most notably against West Bromwich Albion at the Hawthorns. This was an evening match which City lost 1–0. The drab match itself {{has largely been}} forgotten apart from Brian Gayle's original excuse for the mistake which cost the goal: [...] "I was blinded by the floodlights". The sheer array of inflatables staggered many, four City fans appeared carrying an inflatable paddling pool, and sharks, penguins, crocodiles were present and there was even an epic battle of the monsters. At {{one end of the}} terrace stood Godzilla. Six feet tall, green and mean, this dinosaur was a match for <b>anybody.</b> <b>At</b> {{the other end of the}} terrace stood Frankenstein's Monster. Slowly they began to converge towards the centre of the terrace. The crowd roared in anticipation. Eventually they met and the creatures joined in battle. The craze soon died down and come the 1990s the inflatable displays on a large scale were nowhere to be seen.|$|E

2500|$|A {{story that}} haunted Burton {{up to his}} death (recounted {{in some of his}} obituaries) was that he came close to being {{discovered}} one night when he lifted his robe to urinate rather than squatting as an Arab would. It was said that he was seen by an Arab and, in order to avoid exposure, killed him. Burton denied this, pointing out that killing the boy would almost certainly have led to his being discovered as an impostor. Burton became so tired of denying this accusation that he took to baiting his accusers, although he was said to enjoy the notoriety and even once laughingly claimed to have done it. A doctor once asked him: [...] "How do you feel when you have killed a man?", Burton retorted: [...] "Quite jolly, what about you?". When asked by a priest about the same incident Burton is said to have replied: [...] "Sir, I'm proud to say I have committed every sin in the Decalogue." [...] Stanley Lane-Poole, a Burton detractor, reported that Burton [...] "confessed rather shamefacedly that he had never killed <b>anybody</b> <b>at</b> any time." ...|$|E
2500|$|The film {{since its}} release, has been {{positively}} received by film critics. Toni Kan of ThisDay praised its cinematography, story and casting, concluding that: [...] "October 1 provokes {{a lot of}} questions and provides few answers but what is unequivocal is {{that at the end of}} the movie when the picture of the Queen is taken down, Kunle Afolayan, son of Ade Love, is crowned King". Onyeka Nwelue of The Trent, praised the artistic nature of the film, its subtle messages, and concluded: [...] "Mr. Afolayan incorporates facts into fiction to create an everlasting joy in this work. He is not one who is scared of exploring, and he does so beautifully. He takes his time to create. He takes his time to understand the people he is making films for. No matter how intellectually stimulating October 1 is, it can be enjoyed by <b>anybody.</b> <b>At</b> the end, one can easily say, Mr. Afolayan’s October 1 is for everyone who loves great films". Sodas and Popcorn, praised its production design, the performances from the actors, use of costumes, and also described the cinematography as [...] "the best work of art in Nigerian cinematic history". It commended the film for its attention to detail and concluded: [...] "Afolayan obviously had clear vision of what he set out to achieve and pushed his cast to give the best possible performance you could expect from them. The glory of the film, however, is in the fact that the story is not afraid to go there: explore the timeless themes of religion, ethnic rifts, corruption, abuse, pain and privilege. The film plays for 2 hours but there is enough suspense and laugh-till-your-sides-hurt humour to keep you at the edge of your seat".|$|E
