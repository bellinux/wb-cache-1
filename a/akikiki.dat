50|$|The <b>akikiki</b> {{is often}} {{compared}} to the nuthatches of North America because it forages by hopping along the trunks and branches of both live and dead trees, picking off arthropods. <b>Akikiki</b> often forage in pairs, family groups, or mixed-species flocks.|$|E
50|$|The <b>akikiki</b> (Oreomystis bairdi), {{also called}} the Kauai creeper, is a {{critically}} endangered Hawaiian honeycreeper endemic to Kauai, Hawaii.|$|E
50|$|The <b>akikiki</b> {{is small}} (13 cm length; 12-17 g mass), with gray plumage above and white below. It is not sexually dimorphic. Juveniles have large white eye rings; adults may retain a pale eyebrow for several years. Legs and bill are pink. The tail is short {{compared}} to other birds on Kauai, giving it a stocky appearance.|$|E
50|$|The <b>akikiki’s</b> habitat {{has been}} reduced to a {{fragment}} of its former range by deforestation and deterioration by invasive species. Avian malaria, to which most Hawaiian honeycreepers have little immunity, affects birds below approximately 1000 m elevation and further restricts the <b>akikiki’s</b> range. Introduced rats are thought to be major predators of eggs and nestlings. Competition for food and space with non-native birds, such as Japanese white-eye, may also impact its numbers.|$|R
50|$|Few <b>akikiki</b> nests {{have been}} found. Nesting occurs from March to June, with {{both males and}} females {{constructing}} nests of moss and lichen several meters up in the crowns of ohia trees. Only the female incubates the eggs, but both parents feed the nestlings and fledglings. The long juvenile dependency period means only a single brood per pair is typically raised each breeding season.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>akikiki</b> {{has been}} listed as {{critically}} endangered on the IUCN Red List since 2000. It {{has been a}} candidate for listing as an endangered species under the Endangered Species Act since 1993, but was not listed as such until 2010. [...] Because {{little is known about}} this species, the primary focus of recovery efforts so far have been estimating the population size and understanding its basic biology. Captive breeding, reintroduction, and habitat restoration are planned.|$|E
