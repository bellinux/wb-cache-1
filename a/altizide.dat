40|$|In sports. thiazide diuretics {{are used}} to flush out {{previously}} taken prohibited substances with forced diuresis and in sports where weight classes are involved to achieve acute weight loss. Thiazide diuretics include compounds which are very unstable and hydrolyse in aqueous media. Because information regarding the urinary detection of the hydrolysis products is limited, urinary excretion profiles for the hydrolysis product 4 -aniino- 6 -chloro- 1, 3 -benzenedisulphonamide were established in 6 healthy volunteers after oral administration of <b>altizide</b> (15 mg per tablet) and hydrochlorothiazide (25 mg per tablet). Additionally, the excretion profile of chlorothiazide, a metabolite of <b>altizide</b> and hydrochlorothiazide, was also determined. A quantitative liquid-chromatographic tandem mass spectrometric method to detect the 4 substances was developed and validated. The result of this work shows that <b>altizide</b> is eliminated within 48 h in urine whereas hydrochlorothiazide was detectable after 120 h. Chlorothiazide {{was determined to be}} a minor metabolite of <b>altizide</b> and hydrochlorothiazide and could be detected up to 120 h. The hydrolysis product, 4 -amino- 6 -chloro- 1. 3 -benzenedisulphonamide, was detectable 120 h after administration, with concentrations at least 10 times higher than the parent drug. Concentrations ranged between 41 - 239 and 60 - 287 ng/mL after <b>altizide</b> and hydrochlorothiazide administration, respectively. The study shows that 4 -amino- 6 -chloro- 1, 3 -benzenedisulphonamide is an important target compound for the long time detection of thiazide diuretics in urine. (c) 2009 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|In sports, diuretics {{are used}} for two main reasons: to flush {{previously}} taken prohibited substances with forced diuresis and in sports where weight classes are involved to achieve acute weight loss. A common property observed for thiazides is hydrolysis in aqueous media resulting {{in the formation of}} the degradation product aminobenzenedisulphonamide. This degradation product can be observed for several thiazides. Because there is limited information regarding the effect of pH, temperature and light on the stability of thiazides, these parameters were investigated for chlorothiaizide, hydrochlorothiazide and <b>altizide.</b> For all three compounds the degradation product could be detected after incubation at pH 9. 5 for 48 h at 60 degrees C. At lower pH and temperature the degradation product could not be detected for all compounds. When samples were exposed to UV-light <b>altizide</b> and hydrochlorothiazide were photodegraded to chlorothiazide. When the degradation rate between the different compounds was compared for a given temperature and pH, <b>altizide</b> is the most unstable compound. This study confirms that thiazide degradation products can be formed in urine during transport. Hence doping control laboratories shall include them into their routine testing methods as required by WADA. (C) 2008 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
