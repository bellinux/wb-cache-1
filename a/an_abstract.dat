5|$|Most of the Daddies' studio albums {{are written}} to varying extents as concept albums, {{featuring}} either recurring lyrical themes or <b>an</b> <b>abstract</b> progressive narrative. According to Perry, this lyrical interconnectedness is intended as means of providing an album with threads of thematic stability against wildly varying musical styles.|$|E

5|$|One {{proposed}} {{explanation for}} the existence of count-classifiers is that they serve more of a cognitive purpose than a practical one: in other words, they provide a linguistic way for speakers to organize or categorize real objects. An alternative account is that they serve more of a discursive and pragmatic function (a communicative function when people interact) rather than <b>an</b> <b>abstract</b> function within the mind. Specifically, it has been proposed that count-classifiers might be used to mark new or unfamiliar objects within a discourse, to introduce major characters or items in a story or conversation, or to foreground important information and objects by making them bigger and more salient. In this way, count-classifiers might not serve <b>an</b> <b>abstract</b> grammatical or cognitive function, but may help in communication by making important information more noticeable and drawing attention to it.|$|E
5|$|Some critics, however, responded {{favorably to}} Eureka. French writer Paul Valéry praised it for both its poetic and {{scientific}} merit, calling it <b>an</b> <b>abstract</b> poem based on mathematical foundations. Albert Einstein {{in a letter}} written in 1934, noted that Eureka was eine schöne Leistung eines ungewöhnlich selbständigen Geistes (a beautiful achievement of an unusually independent mind).|$|E

The proposed machine has <b>a</b> <b>abstract</b> data structure called <b>a</b> <b>abstract</b> adjacency matrix. An Euclidean space is extended using two automorphisms creating a Galois Field. The operation modes can emulate a set of NOR gates, a graph isomorphism tester, SKI Combinators, and a Blum Shub Smale machine...|$|R

5|$|By {{introducing}} {{a distinction between}} diachronic and synchronic analyses of language, he laid {{the foundation of the}} modern discipline of linguistics. Saussure also introduced several basic dimensions of linguistic analysis that are still fundamental in many contemporary linguistic theories, such as the distinctions between syntagm and paradigm, and the Langue-parole distinction, distinguishing language as <b>an</b> <b>abstract</b> system (langue), from language as a concrete manifestation of this system (parole).|$|E
5|$|Following the 1987 premiere, {{the opera}} {{received}} mixed reviews; some critics dismissed the work, predicting it would soon vanish. However, {{it has been}} presented on many occasions since, in both Europe and North America, and has been recorded twice. In 2011, the opera received its Metropolitan Opera debut, a production based on the original sets, {{and in the same}} year was given <b>an</b> <b>abstract</b> production in Toronto by the Canadian Opera Company. Recent critical opinion has tended to recognize the work as a significant and lasting contribution to American opera.|$|E

5|$|However, Gandhi had sound {{reasons for}} his decision. The salt tax was a deeply {{symbolic}} choice, since salt was used by nearly everyone in India, to replace the salt lost by sweating in India's tropical climate. An item of daily use could resonate more with all classes of citizens than <b>an</b> <b>abstract</b> demand for greater political rights. The salt tax represented 8.2% of the British Raj tax revenue, and hurt the poorest Indians the most significantly.|$|E
5|$|In XML, a {{namespace}} is <b>an</b> <b>abstract</b> domain {{to which}} a collection of element and attribute names can be assigned. The namespace name is a character string which must adhere to the generic URI syntax. However, the name is generally {{not considered to be}} a URI, because the URI specification bases the decision not only on lexical components, but also on their intended use. A namespace name does not necessarily imply any of the semantics of URI schemes; for example, a namespace name beginning with http: may have no connotation {{to the use of the}} HTTP.|$|E
5|$|Moore and Nash {{were on the}} organising {{committee}} of the International Surrealist Exhibition, {{which took place in}} London in 1936. In 1937, Roland Penrose purchased <b>an</b> <b>abstract</b> 'Mother and Child' in stone from Moore that he displayed in the front garden of his house in Hampstead. The work proved controversial with other residents and the local press ran a campaign against the piece over the next two years. At this time Moore gradually transitioned from direct carving to casting in bronze, modelling preliminary maquettes in clay or plaster rather than making preparatory drawings.|$|E

5|$|Some of {{the most}} recent stained glass is by Bristolian Arnold Wathen Robinson {{following}} damage during the Bristol Blitz of 1940 and 1941. These included depictions of local Civil Defence during World War II including St. John Ambulance, the British Red Cross and the fire services along with air raid wardens, police officers, the Home Guard and the Women's Voluntary Service. The most recent glass is <b>an</b> <b>abstract</b> expressionist interpretation of the Holy Spirit designed by Keith New in 1965 and installed in the south choir.|$|E
5|$|The 1949 trial {{defendants}} {{appealed to}} the Second Circuit Court of Appeals in 1950. In the appeal they raised issues {{about the use of}} informant witnesses, the impartiality of the jury and judge, the judge's conduct, and free speech. Their free speech arguments raised important constitutional issues: they asserted that their political advocacy was protected by the First Amendment, because the CPUSA did not advocate imminent violence, but instead merely promoted revolution as <b>an</b> <b>abstract</b> concept.|$|E

Here, Chhinnamasta is interpreted as the severed-headed one as well as the foreheaded-one. The central icon is a pindi, <b>an</b> <b>abstract</b> form of Devi. While householders worship the goddess as a form of the goddess Durga, ascetic sadhus view her as the Tantric severed-headed goddess.|$|E
5|$|The album title {{derives from}} the Dutch art {{movement}} of the same name; common elements of the De Stijl aesthetic are demonstrated on the album cover, which sets the band members against <b>an</b> <b>abstract</b> background of rectangles and lines in red, black and white. The White Stripes have cited the minimalist and deconstructionist aspects of De Stijl design {{as a source of}} inspiration for their own musical image and presentation. The album was dedicated to furniture designer and architect Gerrit Rietveld of the De Stijl movement, {{as well as to the}} influential Georgia bluesman Blind Willie McTell.|$|E
5|$|The {{mathematical}} {{concept of}} a Hilbert space, named after David Hilbert, generalizes the notion of Euclidean space. It extends the methods of vector algebra and calculus from the two-dimensional Euclidean plane and three-dimensional space to spaces with any finite or infinite number of dimensions. A Hilbert space is <b>an</b> <b>abstract</b> vector space possessing the structure of an inner product that allows length and angle to be measured. Furthermore, Hilbert spaces are complete: there are enough limits in the space to allow the techniques of calculus to be used.|$|E
