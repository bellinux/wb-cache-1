50|$|The LFV is the direct-injection 1.5L {{turbocharged}} {{variant of}} the SGE engine, with a 74mm bore and 86.6mm stroke for a total capacity of 1490cc. Compression ratio is 10.0:1 and the engine can run on regular unleaded grade gasoline. Maximum engine speed is 6500 RPM. <b>Automatic</b> <b>Start-Stop</b> is available with this engine. Assembly is in Toluca (Mexico), Springhill (Tennessee) and Flint (Michigan).|$|E
50|$|With {{the second}} generation, Smart {{introduced}} a version with <b>automatic</b> <b>start-stop,</b> marketed as the MHD, or Micro-Hybrid Drive—offered only in certain markets. A sport model, marketed as the Brabus model, {{has been available}} in both generations, and Daimler introduced the Smart electric drive, an all-electric version, in 2007. The Fortwo forms the basis for Daimler's Car2go fleet, the largest car-sharing enterprise worldwide.|$|E
5000|$|HYBUS {{is powered}} by an H-Series 6-cylinder diesel (BS IV compliant) engine that is not used to drive the vehicle ahead, but to charge the ultra-capacitors that powers the 150 kW {{electric}} motor. <b>Automatic</b> <b>start-stop</b> is used to decrease the overall engine idling time. The bus can restart using the stored energy when the engine is off. The fuel-efficiency of the engine thus increases and NVH (Noise-vibration-harshness) levels decrease.|$|E
40|$|This {{document}} {{illustrates a}} lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery solution {{as a replacement}} for leadacid batteries in the 12 V automotive powernet. The basic function of the system is covered by the Atmel ATmega 64 HVE 2. The microcontroller system basis chip provides an analog front end for precise measurement of battery voltage, current and temperature. Its microcontroller operates the ECU and includes a LIN communication interface. The intelligent battery system (IBS) device covers all the <b>automatic</b> <b>start-stop</b> functions in cars. Beside the several economic advantages offered by Li-ion cells, utilizing them instead of lead-acid batteries requires a higher degree of control and monitoring. The Atmel ATA 6870 includes all the features required for meeting these requirements: Precise cell voltage measurement and cell balancing of up to 6 Li-ion cells enables continuous monitoring of the cell states. Two temperature sensor interfaces help prevent overheating of the Li-ion cells. 9290 A–AVR– 10 / 12 1. Lead-Acid Batteries Compared to Li-ion Cells The reason Li-ion cells are superior to lead-acid batteries becomes more apparent by considering the advantages of Li-ion batteries in greater detail...|$|E
