5|$|Although the inflorescences of Banksia aquilonia {{are similar}} to B.integrifolia, the leaves are marked in their differences—the midrib on the leaves' undersides is distinctively covered in short reddish-brown hairs <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>leaves</b> are spirally {{arranged}} on the branches rather than in whorls as in all B.integrifolia subspecies. It was these differences that George felt were distinctive enough {{for it to be}} separate it as a full species from B. integrifolia. The overall habit of a Banksia aquilonia tree resembles that of B.integrifolia, though is generally smaller. The southernmost populations of B.aquilonia are separated from the northernmost B.integrifolia occurrence by , hence location is helpful in identification.|$|E
5|$|Known as baka or baka ni viti in Fiji, Ficus obliqua {{has many}} of its parts used in Fijian {{traditional}} medicine, and was previously held to be sacred there.

Liquid extracted from the root bark has been used for headaches or, when diluted, to improve health after childbirth, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>leaves</b> are applied to venereal lesions. The species has been traditionally used for boils in Samoa and Tonga.|$|E

5|$|Other common {{household}} {{substances that}} should be used with caution around cats include mothballs and other naphthalene products. Phenol-based products (e.g. Pine-Sol, Dettol/Lysol or hexachlorophene) are often used for cleaning and disinfecting near cats' feeding areas or litter boxes, but these can sometimes be fatal. Ethylene glycol, often used as an automotive antifreeze, is particularly appealing to cats, and {{as little as a}} teaspoonful can be fatal. Some human foods are toxic to cats; for example chocolate can cause theobromine poisoning, although (unlike dogs) few cats will eat chocolate. Large amounts of onions or garlic are also poisonous to cats. Many houseplants are also dangerous, such as Philodendron species <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>leaves</b> of the Easter lily (Lilium longiflorum), which can cause permanent and life-threatening kidney damage.|$|E
5|$|The thrips species Gynaikothrips australis {{feeds on}} the {{underside}} of new leaves of F. rubiginosa, as well as F. obliqua and F. macrophylla. As plant cells die, nearby cells are induced into forming meristem tissue and a gall results, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>leaves</b> become distorted and curl over. The thrips begin feeding when the tree has flushes of new growth, and live for around six weeks. At other times, thrips reside on old leaves without feeding. The species pupates sheltered in the bark. The thrips remain in the galls at night, wander about in the daytime and return in the evening, possibly to different galls about the tree. Psyllids have almost defoliated trees in the Royal Botanic Gardens in Sydney in spring.|$|E
5|$|Two plants {{found near}} Twilight Cove are {{regarded}} as hybrids between A.cuneatus and A.forrestii, the only two Adenanthos species {{to occur in the}} area. One was discovered by Nelson in 1972, the other by Alex George in 1974. They are about 5km apart, and differ somewhat. The leaves are triangular and flat like those of A.cuneatus, but the leaves of mature shoots are very long and narrow, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>leaves</b> of younger shoots are deeply lobed.|$|E

5|$|Koalas {{typically}} inhabit open eucalypt woodlands, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>leaves</b> {{of these}} trees make {{up most of}} their diet. Because this eucalypt diet has limited nutritional and caloric content, koalas are largely sedentary and sleep up to 20 hours a day. They are asocial animals, and bonding exists only between mothers and dependent offspring. Adult males communicate with loud bellows that intimidate rivals and attract mates. Males mark their presence with secretions from scent glands located on their chests. Being marsupials, koalas give birth to underdeveloped young that crawl into their mothers' pouches, where they stay {{for the first six}} to seven months of their lives. These young koalas, known as joeys, are fully weaned around a year old. Koalas have few natural predators and parasites, but are threatened by various pathogens, such as Chlamydiaceae bacteria and the koala retrovirus, as well as by bushfires and droughts.|$|E
5|$|Leaves of Ficus obliqua {{serve as}} a food source for the larvae of the {{butterfly}} species the common crow (Euploea core), the no-brand crow (Euploea alcathoe), and the Geometer moth species Scopula epigypsa. The thrips species Gynaikothrips australis feeds {{on the underside of}} new leaves of F. obliqua, as well as F. rubiginosa and F. macrophylla. As plant cells die, nearby cells are induced into forming meristem tissue. A gall results <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>leaves</b> become distorted and curl over.

5|$|The {{silver birch}} is a {{medium-sized}} deciduous tree that owes its common {{name to the}} white peeling bark on the trunk. The twigs are slender and often pendulous <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>leaves</b> are roughly triangular with doubly serrate margins and turn yellow in autumn before they fall. The flowers are catkins and the light, winged seed get widely scattered by the wind. The silver birch is a hardy tree, a pioneer species, {{and one of the}} first trees to appear on bare or fire-swept land. Many species of birds and animals are found in birch woodland, the tree supports a wide range of insects and the light shade it casts allows shrubby and other plants to grow beneath its canopy. It is planted decoratively in parks and gardens and is used for forest products such as joinery timber, firewood, tanning, racecourse jumps and brooms. Various parts of the tree are used in traditional medicine and the bark contains triterpenes which have been shown to have medicinal properties.|$|E

25|$|M. oleifera is a fast-growing, {{deciduous}} {{tree that}} can reach {{a height of}} 10–12 m (32–40ft) and trunk diameter of 45cm (1.5ft). The bark has a whitish-grey colour and is surrounded by thick cork. Young shoots have purplish or greenish-white, hairy bark.

25|$|The corms, {{which have}} a light purple color due to {{phenolic}} pigments, are roasted, baked or boiled, and the natural sugars give a sweet nutty flavor. The starch is easily digestible, and since the grains are fine and small it is often used for baby food.

25|$|The 2014 poetry book 'Spark In The Dark' is prefaced by Blake's epigram: “Without Contraries is no progression” - {{and this}} idea is {{implicit}} {{in many of the}} poems. The last part of the book, Spirit Songs, draws freely on British traditions like the Queen of the May at Beltane. By contrast, the final poem Queen of the Moon ('Queen of the vision revealed in the vine / <b>And</b> <b>the</b> <b>leaves</b> of the Shining Tree...') evokes the Brazilian Santo Daime tradition.|$|E
25|$|Like most root crops, taro and eddoes {{do well in}} deep, moist or even swampy soils {{where the}} annual {{rainfall}} exceeds 2,500mm. Eddoes are more resistant to drought and cold. The crop attains maturity within six to twelve months after planting in dry-land cultivation and after twelve to fifteen months in wetland cultivation. The crop is harvested when the plant height decreases <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>leaves</b> turn yellow. These signals are usually less distinct in flooded taro cultivation.|$|E
25|$|Following the harvest, {{the vines}} {{continues}} {{the process of}} photosynthesis, creating carbohydrate reserves to store in the vine's roots and trunks. It will continue doing this until an appropriate level of reserves have been stored. At that point the chlorophyll in the leaves begin to break down <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>leaves</b> change color from green to yellow. Following the first frost the leaves begin to fall as the vine starts to enter its winter dormancy period. The following spring, the cycle begins again.|$|E

25|$|Through the centuries, {{a variety}} of {{techniques}} for processing tea, and a number of different forms of tea, were developed. During the Tang dynasty, tea was steamed, then pounded and shaped into cake form, while in the Song dynasty, loose-leaf tea was developed and became popular. During the Yuan and Ming dynasties, unoxidized tea leaves were first pan-fried, then rolled and dried, a process that stops the oxidation process that turns the leaves dark, thereby allowing tea to remain green. In the 15th century, oolong tea, in which the leaves were allowed to partially oxidize before pan-frying, was developed. Western tastes, however, favoured the fully oxidized black tea, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>leaves</b> were allowed to oxidize further. Yellow tea was an accidental discovery in the production of green tea during the Ming dynasty, when apparently sloppy practices allowed the leaves to turn yellow, but yielded a different flavour as a result.|$|E
25|$|Short-term dwarfing {{of foliage}} can be {{accomplished}} in certain deciduous bonsai by partial or total defoliation of the plant partway through the growing season. Not all species can survive this technique. In defoliating a healthy tree of a suitable species, {{most or all of}} the leaves are removed by clipping partway along each leaf's petiole (the thin stem that connects a leaf to its branch). Petioles later dry up and drop off or are manually removed once dry. The tree responds by producing a fresh crop of leaves. The new leaves are generally much smaller than those from the first crop, sometimes as small as half the length and width. If the bonsai is shown at this time, the smaller leaves contribute greatly to the bonsai aesthetic of dwarfing. This change in leaf size is usually not permanent, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>leaves</b> of the following spring will often be the normal size. Defoliation weakens the tree and should not be performed in two consecutive years.|$|E
