5|$|One of the Wattle Birds, Anderson's {{seventh and}} final novel, was {{published}} in 1994. Set in Sydney, it details three days {{in the life of}} Cecily Ambruss. Although the novel is ostensibly set in the present, the final paragraph of the novel reveals that the three-day sequence has been devised by Cecily as a means of coping with the fact that a year earlier, her mother, Christine had died of breast cancer, while Cecily had been away on holiday. Throughout the novel, Cecily attempts to resolve two quandaries: she does not understand why her mother did not tell her about that fatal illness <b>and</b> <b>let</b> <b>her</b> go overseas, refusing to let family members call her back, even for the funeral, nor why Christine included the cruel stipulation in her will that Cecily must marry before she can inherit. In addition to its adept depiction of the intricacies of social and family life, One of the Wattle Birds speaks to the process of writing and creating, as Cecily is herself a writer.|$|E

5|$|Quatermass II {{received}} positive newspaper {{reviews in}} the Daily Mail and the Daily Express, although the BBC's Radio Times listings magazine published letters of both praise and criticism for the serial. The serial was also criticised internally at the BBC by Cecil McGivern, who felt {{it to be}} {{not as good as}} the original. One letter received by the production team before the transmission of episode five came from a woman in Haverfordwest who was concerned that she would never find out what happened in the end as the week before the final episode's transmission she was due to move to Ireland {{to spend the rest of}} her life in a convent; she wondered if the BBC could possibly write to her <b>and</b> <b>let</b> <b>her</b> know how the story resolved. After some debate as to whether the letter was a journalistic trick to uncover advance story details, Kneale eventually decided that it was genuine, and allowed Cartier to send a reply outlining the storyline's conclusion. Following episode six, some viewers wrote in to the BBC concerned at Quatermass's survival, as he had not been seen to definitely return to Earth in the experimental rocket ship.|$|E

25|$|Result: Zara was {{initially}} weak {{as a leader}} <b>and</b> <b>let</b> <b>her</b> teammates dictate the ideas for their campaign, but finally took control {{when it came to}} creating the advert. By contrast, Harry M. was much more autocratic and did not pay much attention to the advice his teammates were giving him, which eventually led to Gbemi and Lizzie (who were designing the can) deciding to return the favour and not pay attention to his ideas on the can design. Lord Sugar said that this was the closest decision in any of the advertising tasks since the UK Apprentice began, but ultimately gave Atomic their first (and only) win {{based on the fact that}} Kinetic's advert and can design were both badly made and did not stand out.|$|E

There are many more examples {{of infidelity}} in films and television, and real life, but the point is: if your partner cheats on you it is impossible to be completely unbothered.|$|E
