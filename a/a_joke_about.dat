5|$|The {{episode was}} written and {{directed}} by series co-creator Trey Parker, and was rated TV-MA L in the United States. The episode was conceived from a joke among Parker and fellow co-creator Matt Stone about a fish dressed as motorcycle daredevil Evel Knievel, which eventually turned into <b>a</b> <b>joke</b> <b>about</b> Kanye West not understanding <b>a</b> <b>joke</b> <b>about</b> why liking fishsticks made him a gay fish. The way Cartman tries to steal credit for the joke was inspired by real people Parker and Stone have worked with in the television business.|$|E
5|$|In an {{interview}} with ABC News, Esch and Lefkow stated that {{they came up with}} the original idea for bacon products and their first invention, Bacon Salt, while making <b>a</b> <b>joke</b> <b>about</b> the subject over a meal at a diner. The money for their startup came from the $5000 that Lefkow had obtained while on America's Funniest Home Videos. The idea to make bacon spreadable came from a customer's request. Together, they created interest in their products by going to numerous sporting events dressed in bacon costumes and used social networking sites to raise awareness of their company.|$|E
5|$|When Bart, Lisa, and Maggie are {{watching}} Itchy & Scratchy, Marge says {{they watch the}} same episodes all the time, while Lisa says that the Itchy & Scratchy cartoons are just pasted together from pieces of old episodes. This comment is <b>a</b> <b>joke</b> <b>about</b> the construction of this episode; the blackboard and couch gags are taken from other episodes, there are clips from past episodes, and the interstitials are actually clips from past episodes that feature the family members talking in the kitchen. These three aspects {{support the idea of}} this episode being a clip show to the extreme.|$|E

5|$|In {{the fall}} of 2009, Tonight Show host Conan O'Brien engaged in a satirical on-air and YouTube feud with Booker, with O'Brien jokingly {{insulting}} the City of Newark and Booker responding that he would ban O'Brien from the Newark airport. Then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called for the feud to end during a prepared comedy bit, telling Booker to {{chalk it up to}} a head injury suffered by O'Brien less than two weeks earlier. Booker then appeared on O'Brien's show and assured viewers that the feud was over and that he was actually a big fan of O'Brien, who agreed that every time he made <b>a</b> <b>joke</b> <b>about</b> Newark, he would donate $500 to the City of Newark, and also made a $50,000 donation to the Newark Now charity, which was matched by NBC Universal.|$|E
5|$|Bosanquet {{was one of}} the few bowlers in the MCC team not to {{have some}} success in the opening two matches of the tour, {{although}} he impressed Warner. In addition, he scored 79 runs with the bat in the second game. The third match of the tour was against New South Wales; Bosanquet took four for 60, and his googly caused many problems, particularly for Australia's opening batsman Reggie Duff. He continuously defeated the batsmen, maintaining his length effectively through the innings. By this stage of the tour, Warner believed that Bosanquet was potentially the best bowler in a strong attack if he could bowl a good length, particularly on hard, fast pitches which normally would favour the batsmen. However, Bosnaquet's bowling form remained erratic; in a minor match against a weak side, the opposing captain made <b>a</b> <b>joke</b> <b>about</b> his team's bowling being no worse than Bosanquet's.|$|E

25|$|While it was {{a popular}} {{destination}} for tourists, businesses such as delivery and taxicab services would not serve residents living on Butt Hole Road, believing that the name was simply a prank. Those living on the street would also receive phone calls from pranksters making <b>a</b> <b>joke</b> <b>about</b> the street name, and the residents eventually had their phone number removed from public listings. The name of the street inspired authors Ed Hurst and Rob Bailey to create the book Rude Britain, a compilation of inappropriate place names in Great Britain, after reading an article about a couple who purchased {{a house on the}} street.|$|E
25|$|In {{an episode}} of the {{television}} comedy The Office U.S., which aired in April 2007, an incompetent office manager (Michael Scott) is shown relying on a hypothetical Wikipedia article for information on negotiation tactics in order to assist him in negotiating lesser pay for an employee. The tactics he used failed, as <b>a</b> <b>joke</b> <b>about</b> the unreliability of Wikipedia and what anyone can do to change its contents. Viewers of the show tried to add the episode's mention of the page as {{a section of the}} actual Wikipedia article on negotiation, but this effort was prevented by other users on the article's talk page.|$|E

25|$|Laurinaitis' son, James Laurinaitis, played linebacker for Ohio State University. As a sophomore, James won the Bronko Nagurski Trophy, {{given to}} the best {{defensive}} player in the country, and was {{a finalist for the}} Butkus Award, which is awarded to the best linebacker in the country. In 2007, James won the Butkus Award. In fact, Sports Illustrated made <b>a</b> <b>joke</b> <b>about</b> borrowing his father's shoulder pads and later did an interview with him that included a picture of him wearing them. He was drafted by the St. Louis Rams in the 2nd round as the 35th overall pick in the 2009 NFL Draft, and played with the Rams through the team's final season in St. Louis in 2015, after which he moved to the New Orleans Saints.|$|E
25|$|Osbourne was criticised for her outbursts on the show, where {{before a}} live show in series three she {{reportedly}} {{spoke out against}} Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? presenter Chris Tarrant, {{who was in the}} show's audience prior to filming. Tarrant had made <b>a</b> <b>joke</b> <b>about</b> Ozzy Osbourne to which Sharon Osbourne took offence, but most of her outburst focused on criticising Tarrant's recent infidelity to his wife Ingrid from whom he {{was in the process of}} separating. It was rumoured that Simon Cowell, fellow judge and creator of the show, was displeased with her performance in series three, and was thinking of replacing her and Louis Walsh for the next series. However, it was confirmed that Osbourne had been contracted to return for the fourth series of the show.|$|E
25|$|In the 2010 Winter Olympics at Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, athletes Catriona Le May Doan, Steve Nash, Nancy Greene and Wayne Gretzky were to {{simultaneously}} light {{the base of}} poles, which would then carry the flames upwards to the cauldron. However, only {{three out of four}} poles came out of the ground due to mechanical problems, resulting in inadvertently excluding Le May Doan from lighting it with the other three athletes. Because the site of the ceremonies - BC Place - was a domed stadium, Gretzky was sent via the back of a pick-up truck to a secondary site— the Vancouver Convention Centre which served at the International Broadcast Centre for these Olympics— to light a larger cauldron of a similar design located outdoors, as Olympic rules state that the flame must be in public view for the entirety of the Olympics. In the closing ceremonies, Le May Doan took part in <b>a</b> <b>joke</b> <b>about</b> the mechanical glitch, and she was able to light the fully raised fourth pole and have the indoor cauldron relit.|$|E

25|$|At Bazarov's home, {{they are}} {{received}} enthusiastically by his parents, {{and the traditional}} moeurs of both father and mother, who adulate their son, are portrayed with a nostalgic, idealistic description of humble people and their fast-disappearing world of simple values and virtues. Bazarov's social cynicism, invariably on display with outsiders, is still quite clear as he settles back into his own family's ambiance. Interrupting his father as he speaks to Arkady, he proves rather abrupt and still the powerful center of attention despite being around his parents. Arkady, who has delighted Bazarov's father by assuring him that his son has a brilliant future in store, in turn reproves his friend for his brusqueness. Later, Bazarov almost comes to blows with Arkady after the latter makes <b>a</b> <b>joke</b> <b>about</b> fighting over Bazarov's cynicism. This once again shows the distance and changes within Arkady and Bazarov's relationship, as Arkady becomes more defiant against Bazarov's ideals. After a brief stay, much to the parents' disappointment, they decide to return to Maryino, stopping {{on the way to}} see Madame Odintsova, who receives them coolly. They leave almost immediately and return to Arkady's home.|$|E
25|$|NBC's {{requests}} {{became more}} unreasonable and the O'Brien camp refused them, {{such as the}} right to pull any of his final shows if the network objected to the content (i.e., <b>a</b> <b>joke</b> <b>about</b> the conflict/NBC). Jeffrey Immelt, GE chairman, questioned why they were paying so much for a performer destined to run to another network. Negotiations continued on into O'Brien's final week; he could not confirm on-air it was indeed his final week of shows, which produced difficulty in booking the guests he desired for his final show. On January 19, multiple media outlets reported that O'Brien and NBC were close to signing a deal between US$30 and US$40 million for the host {{to walk away from the}} network. Following his Wednesday, January 20 edition, O'Brien remained at the studio until the early hours of the morning, alongside Ross and the legal counsel, trying to finalize the settlement. O'Brien wandered off, playing his guitar alone and stepping out on the deserted Universal lot at midnight, attempting to make sense of the situation. Meanwhile, Ron Meyer passingly suggested to Zucker and Gaspin, based off the public outcry, that they should stick with O'Brien; the two executives agreed to send him on his way. O'Brien signed the agreement that night and the following day the terms were made public.|$|E

Willis also appeared in Japanese Subaru Legacy television commercials. Tying in with this, Subaru did a limited run of Legacys, badged [...] "Subaru Legacy Touring Bruce", in honor of Willis.|$|E

[...] The films that are watched by the family on the new cable are Jaws, Die Hard, and Wall Street. One of the X-rated films Bart and his friends watch on cable is called Broadcast Nudes.
