40|$|Abstract: Data fusion is a {{hot topic}} in data {{integration}} which at least includes the two stages: entity <b>resolution</b> <b>and</b> data <b>conflict</b> <b>resolution.</b> However, the existing fusion process is transparent and the fusion stages are isolated. So in this paper, we proposed a traceable data fusion mechanism based on data provenance which can trace the data sources of fusion re-sults and the evolutionary process. The mechanism mainly targets forwards entity <b>resolution</b> <b>and</b> data <b>conflict</b> <b>resolution</b> stage. We represented the provenance of data origin using PI-CS which is more accurate because PI-CS can record the in-termediate process of data evolution. In order to record the evolution process of data fusion, we proposed two transforma-tion provenances: entity <b>resolution</b> provenance <b>and</b> data <b>conflict</b> <b>resolution</b> provenance which record respectively the evo-lution process of entity <b>resolution</b> <b>and</b> data <b>conflict</b> <b>resolution.</b> Finally, we give an example to validate {{the availability of the}} traceable mechanism for data fusion...|$|R

25|$|The Seminar on Regional Security (SRS) is {{a three-week}} course that {{provides}} national security professionals with a comprehensive overview on security dynamics <b>and</b> <b>conflict</b> <b>resolution</b> strategies within the European-Eurasian region.

In contrast to the traditional global perspective, this seminar shifts the focus to a regional outlook on the analysis of approaches and best practice examples toward peace and security, in the context of comprehensive international missions and a multitude of local, regional and international actors.|$|E
25|$|Although many of peacebuilding's aims {{overlap with}} those of peacemaking, {{peacekeeping}} <b>and</b> <b>conflict</b> <b>resolution,</b> it is a distinct idea. Peacemaking involves stopping an ongoing conflict, whereas peacebuilding happens before a conflict starts or once it ends. Peacekeeping prevents the resumption of fighting following a conflict; it {{does not address the}} underlying causes of violence or work to create societal change, as peacebuiding does. It also differs from peacebuilding in that it only occurs after conflict ends, not before it begins. Conflict resolution does not include some components of peacebuilding, such as state building and socioeconomic development.|$|E

25|$|It was {{revealed}} in April 2012 that Johan Galtung, a Norwegian sociologist who pioneered {{the discipline of}} peace studies <b>and</b> <b>conflict</b> <b>resolution,</b> made antisemitic comments during public speeches and lectures. Galtung claimed {{that there was a}} possible link between the Mossad and Anders Behring Breivik. He also claimed that six Jewish companies control 96% of the media in the United States, a frequent statement made by antisemites. Galtung also claimed that 70% of the professors at the 20 most important American universities are Jewish, and recommended that people read the fraudulent antisemitic manuscript The Protocols of the Elders of Zion.|$|E
25|$|In the 1970s, Norwegian {{sociologist}} Johan Galtung first {{created the}} term peacebuilding through his promotion of systems {{that would create}} sustainable peace. Such systems needed to address {{the root causes of}} conflict and support local capacity for peace management <b>and</b> <b>conflict</b> <b>resolution.</b> Galtung's work emphasized a bottom-up approach that decentralized social and economic structures, amounting to a call for a societal shift from structures of coercion and violence to a culture of peace. American sociologist John Paul Lederach proposed a different concept of peacebuilding as engaging grassroots, local, NGO, international and other actors to create a sustainable peace process. He does not advocate the same degree of structural change as Galtung.|$|E
