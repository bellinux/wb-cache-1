40|$|Microfinishing, {{also known}} as {{superfinishing}} or short-stroke honing, is a commonly used process for generating technical surfaces focusing on tribological applications. Due to microfinishing processes high surface qualities are manufacturable regarding the surface roughness and bearing area ratio. While the required characteristics for tribological loaded workpieces are changing with their rising significance, the surface structuring {{is becoming more and}} more important. With the use of defined <b>abrasive</b> <b>belts,</b> the possibilities of surface structuring by microfinishing are enhanced. The possibilities and challenges concerning surface structuring by microfinishing applying defined <b>abrasive</b> <b>belts</b> are described in this research study. Therefore, a geometrical-kinematic simulation is used to predict the theoretical structures generated by microfinishing, while in experimental investigations the influences of kinematic parameters and a multi-stage process sequence are considered...|$|R

50|$|The belt {{grinding}} process is variable by adjusting certain parameters such as belt speed, grinding pressure, feed speed, durometer of the contact drum, {{size of the}} contact drum and the <b>abrasive</b> <b>belt</b> that is used. The machines {{can be made for}} wet or dry operation. Furthermore, a wide {{belt grinding}} machine can be constructed with single or multiple heads. The first head is used for coarse grinding and the next heads gradually make a finer finish. Wide belt grinding is also used as a high stock removal method for special metals (e.g. stainless steel, titanium, and nickel alloys).|$|E
40|$|Surface {{quality is}} an {{important}} characteristic commonly assessed in wooden products. Sanding relies on coated abrasives as tooling for both dimensioning and surface finishing but their performance is dependent on chip loading and grit wear. Traditionally, the useful life of <b>abrasive</b> <b>belts</b> in sanding operation has been manually assessed. This type of inspection is highly subjective and dependent upon individual expertise, consequently leading to under utilization or over utilization of the abrasive. This, in turn, affects the production costs {{and quality of the}} product. In this work, an intelligent classification method that determines the optimal replacement policy for a belt exposed to known manufacturing parameters is developed. Controlled experiments were conducted to develop <b>abrasive</b> <b>belts</b> of known exposure, followed with digital microscopy to capture images and process them with pattern recognition and classification algorithms. Grit size and machining time were the parameters of interest while response of the experiments included image information from the abrasive sheets after every experimental run. These images were used in training an artificial neural network that in turn, help in determining data to categorize the useful life of the abrasive. The results show a 95 % success rate in accurately classifying abrasive images of similarly conditioned abrasives. Also, the results show that the classification of interpolated and extrapolated times of abrasive usage are classified with a 95 % success rate. A classification of abrasive images is proposed to be used as one of the inputs to a decision system that would help in evaluating the life of the abrasive and replacement policies. Further research on the relationship between the different parameters affecting the useful life of the abrasive is proposed...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the common}} issues that arises in {{abrasive}} machining is the inconsistency of the surface roughness within the same batch and under identical machining conditions. Recent advances in engineered abrasives have allowed replacement of the random arrangement of minerals on conventional belts with precisely shaped structures uniformly cast directly onto a backing material. This allows for <b>abrasive</b> <b>belts</b> that are more deterministic in shape, size, distribution, orientation, and composition. A computer model based on known tooling geometry was developed to approximate the asymptotic surface profile that was achievable under specific loading conditions. Outputs included the theoretical surface parameters, R^sub q^, R^sub a^, R^sub v^, R^sub p^, R^sub t^, and R^sub sk^. Experimental validation was performed with a custom-made abrader apparatus and using engineered abrasives on highly polished aluminum samples. Interferometric microscopy was used in assessing the surface roughness. Results include the individual effects of pyramid base width, pyramid height, attack angle, and indentation depth on the surface descriptors...|$|R
50|$|This finish is {{commonly}} used for the medical and food industry and almost exclusively used on stainless steel. This finish is much finer than a #4 architectural finish. This finish enhances the physical appearance of the metal as well as increases the sanitary benefits. One takes great care to remove any surface defects in the metal, like pits, that could allow bacteria to grow. A #4 dairy or sanitary finish is produced by polishing with a 180-240 grit belt or wheel finish softened with 120-240 grit greaseless compound or a fine non woven <b>abrasive</b> <b>belt</b> or pad.|$|E

50|$|In woodworking, {{wide belt}} sanders use platens {{to press the}} sanding paper {{into contact with the}} wood being sanded. The platen sits between two steel rolls which deliver the moving force to the sanding belt. Sanding heads with a platen are used on finish sanding with papers of finer grits, when the coarser ones are {{typically}} used with contact drum type sanding heads. Stock is fed {{into and out of the}} machine on a conveyor belt. Since the <b>abrasive</b> <b>belt</b> creates a substantial pressure on the stock that tends to push the stock toward the infeed, the hold down shoes and rollers hold the workpiece down against the belt while it is moving through the machine in order to ensure uniform contact with the abrasive and continuous movement.|$|E

40|$|Abstract-Polishing is {{the process}} of {{creating}} a smooth and shiny surface by rubbing it or using a chemical action, leaving a surface with a significant spectacular reflection. When an unpolished surface is magnified thousands of times, it usually looks like mountains and valleys. By repeated abrasion, those "mountains " are worn down until they are flat or just small "hills. " The process of polishing with abrasives starts with coarse ones and graduates to fine ones. The surface of a metallographic specimen is prepared by various methods of grinding, polishing, and etching. After preparation, it is often analyzed using optical or electron microscopy. The process of polishing is divided into rough polishing and fine polishing. The wet grinding machine is used for rough polishing in which we use different grade emery papers.
