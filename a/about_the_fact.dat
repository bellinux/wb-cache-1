5|$|Caesar {{was assassinated}} in March 44 BC. The motives of the conspirators were both personal, as well as political. Many of Caesar's {{ultimate}} assassins were envious of him, and dissatisfied with the recognition that they had received from him. Most of the conspirators were senators, {{and many of them}} were angry <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that he had deprived the senate of much of its power and prestige. They were also angry that, while they had received few honors, Caesar had been given many honors. There were also rumors {{that he was going to}} make himself king, and transfer the seat of government to Alexandria. The grievances that they held against him were vague, and as such, their plan against him was vague. The fact that their motives were vague, and that they had no idea of what to do after his assassination, both were plainly obvious by the subsequent course of events.|$|E
5|$|Fatboy begins {{running the}} car lot when Charlie leaves Walford. His {{friendship}} with Donna Yates (Lisa Hammond) grows {{and they have}} a one-night stand, but, feeling it is making their friendship weird, he rejects her afterwards despite her thinking she might have deeper feelings for him. Things between them are awkward, and when Donna's foster brother Vincent Hubbard (Richard Blackwood) finds out, he confronts Fatboy and locks him a cupboard. He returns the next day to find that Fatboy has not been discovered, and from how scared Fatboy is, realises something is wrong. Fatboy opens up <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> his mother used to lock him up for extended periods of time, which led to him assuming the comedic persona of 'Fatboy'. Vincent convinces him to use his real name, Arthur, again, and gives him a job as DJ at his bar The Albert as long as he no longer puts on a false persona, starting with admitting to Donna that he will now be showing his true self to her. Over the coming weeks, Fatboy gets tangled in Vincent's vendetta against the Mitchell family and trying to kill Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden). Fatboy repeatedly tries to convince Vincent to stop, and interrupts Vincent when as he is about to throttle Phil. Fed up with his interference, Vincent threatens Fatboy with violence against Dot if he does not leave Walford forever. Fatboy tells Dot {{that he is going to}} see his father for Christmas, and shares a final dinner with her before saying goodbye. He confronts Vincent one last time, demanding that he stay away from Dot, and leaves Walford.|$|E

25|$|Colin was EastEnders first {{homosexual}} character. Introduced in August 1986, Colin {{was one of}} {{the more}} popular characters {{in the early years of}} the programme. At first the audience and the residents of Walford were kept in the dark <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that Colin was gay. This changed by the end of the year, at which time Colin acquired a young boyfriend named Barry Clark (Gary Hailes).|$|E
25|$|It's true to {{say these}} {{programmes}} {{about climate change}} are different, in that previously I have made programmes about natural history, and now you could say I have an engaged stance. The first is <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that there is climate change {{and that it is}} human-induced. So I'm glad that the BBC wanted some clear statement of the evidence as to why these two things are the case.|$|E
25|$|The Schweizerische Nordostbahn {{expanded}} its Zürich-Baden line to Brugg on September 29, 1856 and the cantonal capital of Aarau on May 15, 1858. The {{expansion of the}} railroad initially hurt the town’s economy, as the road over the Bözberg Pass was replaced by rail and the businesses serving these travelers lost their clientele. Brugg also found fault with {{the location of the}} train station, which was built ten minutes from the town itself. Windisch, on the other hand, complained <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that stationed was named for Brugg despite actually being located on its territory.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. When {{reasoning}} <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> of a case, we typically use {{stories to}} link the known events into coherent wholes. One way to establish coherence is to appeal to past examples, real or fictitious. These examples can be chosen and critiqued using the case-based reasoning (CBR) techniques from the AI and Law literature. In this paper, we apply these techniques to factual stories, assessing a story <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> using precedents. We thus show how factual and legal reasoning can be combined in a CBR model...|$|R
25|$|Bowlby's {{reliance}} on Piaget's theory of cognitive development {{gave rise to}} questions about object permanence (the ability to remember an object that is temporarily absent) and its connection to early attachment behaviours, and <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that the infant's ability to discriminate strangers and react to the mother's absence seems to occur some months earlier than Piaget suggested would be cognitively possible. More recently, it has been noted that the understanding of mental representation has advanced so much since Bowlby's day that present views can be far more specific than those of Bowlby's time.|$|E
25|$|Barry was {{one half}} of Walford's first {{homosexual}} couple. His boyfriend, Colin, had already been introduced to the show several months prior to Barry's arrival and he had proven to be an extremely popular addition to the cast. Both the audience and the residents of Walford had been {{kept in the dark}} <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that Colin was gay. This changed upon Barry's first scene on-screen, whereby the audience learnt that he had spent the night with Colin after picking him up the night before (off-screen) at a gay club.|$|E
25|$|Lindy Chamberlain was {{questioned}} about the garments that Azaria was wearing. She claimed that Azaria {{was wearing a}} matinee jacket over the jumpsuit, but the jacket was not present when the garments were found. She {{was questioned}} <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that Azaria's singlet, which was inside the jumpsuit, was inside out. She insisted that she never put a singlet on her babies inside out {{and that she was}} most particular about this. The statement conflicted with the state of the garments when they were collected as evidence. The garments had been arranged by the investigating officer for a photograph.|$|E

In Sana'a, the capital of Yemen, the case is a non-issue. Yemen is one of the poorest countries in the Arab world, and Shaher Abdulhak is the founder and owner of a Yemen-based company that is involved with regional trade and industry, he is the chairman for the hotel Taj Sheba in Sana'a, and is an executive with the Yemen franchise of Coca-Cola. He has big political influence in Sana'a, with close connections to the government.|$|E
25|$|Since Huygens was {{too small}} to {{transmit}} directly to Earth, it was designed to transmit the telemetry data obtained while descending through Titan's atmosphere to Cassini by radio, which would in turn relay it to Earth using its large 4-meter diameter main antenna. Some engineers, most notably ESA ESOC employees Claudio Sollazzo and Boris Smeds, felt uneasy <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that, in their opinion, this feature had not been tested before launch under sufficiently realistic conditions. Smeds managed, with some difficulty, to persuade superiors to perform additional tests while Cassini was in flight. In early 2000, he sent simulated telemetry data at varying power and Doppler shift levels from Earth to Cassini. It turned out that Cassini was unable to relay the data correctly.|$|E
25|$|Besides {{the above}} Quranic verses, there some {{authenticated}} references for this issue. For example, Ali Ibn Burhanu'd-din Halabi Shafi'i {{writes in his}} Siratu'l-Halabiyya, p.39 that at first Fatimah complained to Abu Bakr <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that she was given the fadak as a gift by the holy prophet of Islam, as the witnesses were unavailable {{she was forced to}} allege her right based on the inheritance law. Also it is mentioned in Mu'jam Al-Buldan of Yaqut al-Hamawi, Tafsir al-Kabir of Imam Fakhru'd-din Razi, Sawa'iq al-Muhriqa of Ibn Hajar p.21, Sharh al-Nahju'l-Balagha of Ibn Abi'l-Hadid Mu'tazali Vol 4, p.80 that Fatima firstly claimed she was given the fadak as a gift but they rejected her witnesses and she suffered and angrily said that she would not talk to Abu Bakr and Umar again.|$|E

40|$|Crombag, Van Koppen and Wagenaar have {{proposed}} the anchored narratives theory {{as a tool}} for establishing and identifying <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> of a criminal case. The theory emphasises the role of stories in reasoning <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>facts,</b> and <b>the</b> pivotal function of anchoring generalisations. Here the anchored narratives theory is reconstructed in terms of semi-formal argumentation schemes, a method borrowed from recent research crossing the fields of argumentation theory and artificial intelligence. Hence we provide an elaboration and refinement of the anchored narratives theory, and are able to show how stories can play an explicit role in reasoning <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>facts.</b> In <b>the</b> present approach, not only the elements of stories are part of argumentation, but also stories as wholes. We argue that accepting one story (typically <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> of <b>the</b> crime) can depend on the acceptance of other stories (typically about pieces of evidence) and that a more elaborate theory of story structures is required, one in which other story structures than only one for intentional crime is distinguished. ...|$|R
25|$|When Nina woke up {{from the}} cryosleep, she {{suffered}} heavy amnesia, a fate from which her sister Anna was spared. She was also controlled by the recently awakened Ogre, the God of Fighting who sent her to participate in The King of Iron Fist Tournament 3 to assassinate Jin Kazama - Heihachi Mishima's grandson. Near {{the end of the}} tournament, Jin managed to beat Nina back to her senses, allowing her to break free from Ogre's control. As an act of compassion, Anna wanted to end Nina's job of an assassin, however wanted to continue their rivalry. So Anna worked intensively with Dr. Boskonovitch to bring her sister's memories back. However, the project failed when Nina recovered the memory <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that she and her sister did not get along. After this, Nina left and did not contact Anna for some time.|$|E
25|$|On 20 April, the Hungarian I. and III. corps {{started their}} march towards Komárom. On 22 of April, the two Hungarian corps arrived to Komárom, {{breaking}} the Northern {{section of the}} imperial blockade around this fortress. In the same day, the garrison of Komárom, broke out from the Nádor defense line against the Sossay brigade in Csallóköz, forcing the imperials to retreat to Csallóközaranyos, than to Nyárasd. The imperials lost 50 men and 30 horses. Hearing <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that Lieutenant General Wohlgemuth, who after his defeat at Nagysalló, retreated to west from the river Vág, now advanced again towards East to Érsekújvár, Görgei ordered to the VII. corps, which just arrived, to take position at Perbete, to secure {{the rear of the}} Hungarian army from an eventual attack. Than he, together with General György Klapka, elaborated the plan for the next day.|$|E

25|$|With {{the capture}} of Bergen op Zoom, the French now had control of {{the entire length of}} the river Scheldt. The defeat caused a rift between the Dutch and British governments. It now dawned on the British that they had demanded too much of the {{military}} capability of the Dutch Republic and that its ability to resist the French had been exhausted. The Dutch on the other hand were furious <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that her allies were unwilling to relieve the city. The city was key to opening up the Dutch Republic and Hanover to a potential French invasion. Lowendal was made a Marshal of France for his exploit and the French now controlled the length of the Scheldt river. Along with the defeat at Lauffeld, the defeat at Bergen op Zoom forced the British to re-enter negotiations, and to take seriously the ongoing talks at the Congress of Breda, leading to a treaty in 1748.|$|E
25|$|In 1998, the Seattle Times {{reported}} that pistachio makers in California were unhappy <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that Israel imported {{most of its}} pistachio from Iran. The head of Iran-China economic room, Asadollah Asgaroladi said in the article that such transactions are easily possible. Based on the article Israel imports {{only a quarter of}} pistachios from US and about half of its pistachios from Britain and Germany, whereas these two countries are not producers of pistachio at all and the source is very likely to be from Iran. Furthermore, in 1998 Israeli government punished the Hamama Brothers Co. for illegally importing 105 tonnes of pistachio from Iran. Israeli newspaper Ynet reported in 2007 that US government once again asked Israeli government to stop importing pistachios from Iran. In 2008 US ambassador to Israel, Richard H. Jones wrote a letter to Israel's finance minister Ronnie Bar-on demanding Israel to stop importing Iranian pistachios from Turkey. Similar reports have been published by Haaretz.|$|E
25|$|In 2005, Akers-Jones briefly {{emerged from}} {{retirement}} to defend, before Hong Kong's Legislative Council, {{his role in}} zoning the Discovery Bay resort project on Lantau in the 1970s. Developers were allowed to build there with the stipulation that it would become a resort, {{but most of the}} units were later converted into luxury housing. Akers-Jones was involved in the original zoning decision as the then Secretary for the New Territories. With the new Hong Kong Disneyland having opened nearby and property prices having skyrocketed as a result, suspicions <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that the original zoning plan was never enforced have again come to the fore. He criticised the decision to call on an elderly man to testify on the matter, which happened some 30 years earlier. However, he revealed that colonial officials had abruptly changed the zoning of the Discovery Bay project, and gave it to new developers because they feared it would {{fall into the hands of}} the former Soviet Union.|$|E
