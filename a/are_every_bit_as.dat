500|$|While {{primarily}} {{inspired by}} {{the music of the}} Beatles and other British Invasion bands, acknowledging too the jangle pop and power pop of the period, Big Star also incorporated dark, nihilistic themes to produce a striking blend of musical and lyrical styles. The body of work resulting from the first era was a precursor of the alternative rock of the 1980s and 1990s, at the same time yielding material today considered an outstanding example of power pop. [...] The stylistic range is evident from modern day critiques. Bogdanov et al., commenting on #1Record in their All Music Guide to Rock, perceive in [...] "The Ballad of El Goodo" [...] a [...] "luminous, melancholy ballad", whereas John Borack's Ultimate Power Pop Guide singles out Radio Citys [...] "September Gurls" [...] as a [...] "glorious, glittering jewel" [...] of power pop. Borack notes too that Third/Sister Lovers is [...] "slower, darker and a good deal weirder" [...] than the first two albums, identifying [...] "Holocaust" [...] as [...] "Alex Chilton at his haunting best", yet finds [...] "Thank You Friends" [...] exemplifying [...] "left-field gems" [...] also present in which [...] "the hooks <b>are</b> <b>every</b> <b>bit</b> <b>as</b> undeniable" [...] as before. Jovanovic writes that when recording what Peter Buckley in his Rough Guide to Rock terms the [...] "snarling guitar rock" [...] of the first album's [...] "Don't Lie To Me", the band, deeming conventional instruments inadequate for the task, wheeled two Norton Commando motorcycles into the studio and gunned the engines to intensify the song's bridge. Bogdanov et al. reserve [...] "snarl" [...] for a Radio City song, [...] "Mod Lang"; here Buckley writes that [...] "the power of the performance and the erratic mix gave a sense of chaos which only added to the thrill".|$|E
2500|$|Some {{organizations}} {{objected to}} Daschle's selection, arguing {{that his work}} at Alston & Bird was tantamount to lobbying and therefore his selection violated Obama's promise to keep special interests out of the White House. According to Ellen Miller, {{executive director of the}} Sunlight Foundation, Daschle technically complies with the transition rules against lobbyists but [...] "many power brokers never register as lobbyists, but they <b>are</b> <b>every</b> <b>bit</b> <b>as</b> powerful." [...] Stephanie Cutter, a spokeswoman for the Obama transition, responded that Daschle's work [...] "does not represent a bar to his service in the transition" [...] since [...] "he was not a lobbyist, and he will recuse himself from any work that presents a conflict of interest." [...] Ron Pollack, executive director of Families USA, praised Daschle on his nomination to Secretary of Health and Human Services for his [...] "deep commitment to securing high-quality, affordable health care for everyone in our nation." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 2006, the American Psychological Association, American Psychiatric Association and National Association of Social Workers {{stated in}} an amicus brief {{presented}} to the Supreme Court of the State of California: Although it is sometimes asserted in policy debates that heterosexual couples are inherently better parents than same-sex couples, or that the children of lesbian or gay parents fare worse than children raised by heterosexual parents, those assertions find no support in the scientific research literature. [...] When comparing the outcomes of different forms of parenting, it is critically important to make appropriate comparisons. For example, differences resulting {{from the number of}} parents in a household cannot be attributed to the parents’ gender or sexual orientation. Research in households with heterosexual parents generally indicates that – all else being equal – children do better with two parenting figures rather than just one. The specific research studies typically cited in this regard do not address parents’ sexual orientation, however, and therefore do not permit any conclusions to be drawn about the consequences of having heterosexual versus nonheterosexual parents, or two parents who are of the same versus different genders. Indeed, the scientific research that has directly compared outcomes for children with gay and lesbian parents with outcomes for children with heterosexual parents has been remarkably consistent in showing that lesbian and gay parents <b>are</b> <b>every</b> <b>bit</b> <b>as</b> fit and capable as heterosexual parents, and their children are as psychologically healthy and well-adjusted as children reared by heterosexual parents. Amici emphasize that the abilities of gay and lesbian persons as parents and the positive outcomes for their children are not areas where credible scientific researchers disagree. Statements by the leading associations of experts in this area reflect professional consensus that children raised by lesbian or gay parents do not differ in any important respects from those raised by heterosexual parents. No credible empirical research suggests otherwise. Allowing same-sex couples to legally marry will not have any detrimental effect on children raised in heterosexual households, but it will benefit children being raised by same-sex couples.|$|E

60|$|James, {{going into}} the world, quickly {{realised}} {{that he had been}} brought up to a state of things which did not exist. He was like a sailor who has put out to sea in an ornamental boat, and finds that his sail is useless, the ropes not made to work, and the rudder immovable. The long, buoyant wind of the world blew away like thistle-down the conventions which had seemed so secure a foundation. But he discovered in himself a wonderful curiosity, an eagerness for adventure which led him boldly to affront every peril; and the unknown lands of the intellect <b>are</b> <b>every</b> <b>bit</b> <b>as</b> dangerously fascinating as are those of sober fact. He read omnivorously, saw many and varied things; the universe was spread out before him like an enthralling play. Knowledge is like the root of a tree, attaching man by its tendrils to the life about him. James found in existence new beauties, new interests, new complexities; and he gained a lighter heart and, above all, an exquisite sense of freedom. At length he looked back with something like horror at that old life in which the fetters of ignorance had weighed so terribly upon him.|$|E

You want a first-class Pullman car reserved for each two of you. Some of you have seen an omnibus in the distance, and have wondered what it was used for. To suggest that you should travel in such a plebeian conveyance, is to give you a shock that takes you two days to recover from.
