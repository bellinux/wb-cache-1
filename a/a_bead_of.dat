Located under the building was a tomb lined with slabs of schist, which contained an elite burial. The remains probably belonged to a male, the teeth were inlaid with jade, and <b>a</b> <b>bead</b> <b>of</b> the same material had been placed in the mouth. Associated ceramic offerings date this tomb to the Early Classic.|$|E
2500|$|PP can be melted using a speed welding technique. With speed welding, {{the plastic}} welder, {{similar to a}} {{soldering}} iron in appearance and wattage, is fitted with a feed tube for the plastic weld rod. The speed tip heats the rod and the substrate, {{while at the same}} time it presses the molten weld rod into position. <b>A</b> <b>bead</b> <b>of</b> softened plastic is laid into the joint, and the parts and weld rod fuse. With polypropylene, the melted welding rod must be [...] "mixed" [...] with the semi-melted base material being fabricated or repaired. [...] A speed tip [...] "gun" [...] is essentially a soldering iron with a broad, flat tip that can be used to melt the weld joint and filler material to create a bond.|$|E
2500|$|On 22 August, Frankel won the Juddmonte International Stakes at York. This {{race was}} over 10 furlongs {{and was the}} first time that he raced over more than a mile. Consequently, there was much {{anticipation}} as to whether he would stay the extra distance. Starting at odds of 1/10 against eight rivals, he barely came off the bridle to win easily by seven lengths from Farhh, who was a nose ahead of four-time Group 1 winner St Nicholas Abbey in third. Most striking, was the dominance Frankel's very high cruising speed gave him, particularly now upped in distance to 10 furlongs. Indeed, TV footage of the aftermath in the Winners' Enclosure, shows Cecil in genuine awe of his equine protégé, running his hands down the horse's back to demonstrate there was hardly <b>a</b> <b>bead</b> <b>of</b> sweat to be found. This was his eighth consecutive European Group 1 victory, breaking the previous record of seven in a row set by Rock of Gibraltar. After the race trainer Sir Henry Cecil said [...] "It's fantastic. It's great for Yorkshire and they deserved to see him." [...] He was attending the racecourse after missing Frankel's previous win due to ill health and said the win made him feel [...] "twenty years better.".|$|E

40|$|International audienceAn {{analysis}} of four 1 -ns molecular dynamics trajectories for two different 15 -bp oligonucleotides is presented. Our {{aim is to}} show which groups of atoms can be treated as rigid bodies within <b>a</b> <b>bead</b> representation <b>of</b> DNA, independently of the base sequence and for any conformations belonging to the A/B family. Five models with moderate intragroup deformations are proposed in which the groups are formed of atoms belonging to a single nucleotide or to a complementary nucleotide pair. The influence of group deformation in two of these models is studied using canonical correlation analysis, and it is shown that the internal DNA dynamics is indeed dominated by the rigid motion of the defined atom groups. Finally, {{using one of the}} models within <b>a</b> <b>bead</b> representation <b>of</b> duplex DNA makes it possible to obtain stretching, torsional, and bending rigidities in reasonable agreement with experiment but points to strongly correlated stretching motions.

60|$|I was {{standing}} quite near to Vincent Jopp, {{and at this}} moment I saw <b>a</b> <b>bead</b> <b>of</b> perspiration spring out on his forehead, and into his steely eyes there came a positively hunted look.

60|$|He {{held out}} his hand as he spoke, and I grasped it firmly, thumb to thumb, keeping my elbow high so as to bear all my force upon it. His own trick was, as I observed, to gain command of the other hand by a great output of {{strength}} at the onset. This I prevented by myself putting out all my power. For a minute or more we stood motionless, gazing into each other's faces. Then I saw <b>a</b> <b>bead</b> <b>of</b> sweat trickle down his forehead, and I knew that he was beaten.

I forget who was with him, but the pair were enjoying a deliberate talk over their pipes.

6000|$|Charles Fourier {{announced}} that [...] "the attractions of man are proportioned to his destinies;" [...] in other words, that every desire predicts its own satisfaction. Yet, all experience exhibits {{the reverse of}} this; the incompetency of power is the universal grief of young and ardent minds. They accuse the divine Providence of a certain parsimony. It has shown the heaven and earth to every child, and filled him with a desire for the whole; a desire raging, infinite; a hunger, as of space {{to be filled with}} planets; a cry of famine, as of devils for souls. Then for the satisfaction,--to each man is administered a single drop, <b>a</b> <b>bead</b> <b>of</b> dew of vital power per day,--a cup as large as space, and one drop of the water of life in it. Each man woke in the morning, with an appetite that could eat the solar system like a cake; a spirit for action and passion without bounds; he could lay his hand on the morning star; he could try conclusions with gravitation or chemistry; but, on the first motion to prove his strength--hands, feet, senses, gave way, and would not serve him. He was an emperor deserted by his states, and left to whistle by himself, or thrust into a mob of emperors, all whistling: and still the sirens sang, [...] "The attractions are proportioned to the destinies." [...] In every house, in the heart of each maiden, and of each boy, in the soul of the soaring saint, this chasm is found,-- between the largest promise of ideal power, and the shabby experience.|$|E
