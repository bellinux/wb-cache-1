We {{describe}} how the standard genotype-phenotype mapping process of Grammatical Evolution (GE) {{can be enhanced}} with an attribute grammar to allow GE to operate as a decoder-based Evolutionary Algorithm (EA). Use of an attribute grammar <b>allows</b> <b>GE</b> to maintain context-sensitive and semantic information pertinent to the capacity constraints of the 01 Multiconstrained Knapsack Problem (MKP). An attribute grammar specification is used to perform decoding similar to a first-fit heuristic. The results presented are encouraging, demonstrating that GE in conjunction with attribute grammars can provide an improvement over the standard context-free mapping process for problems in this domain. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{possibility}} of default limits available liquidity. If the potential default draws nearer, a liquidity crisis may ensue, causing a crash in asset prices, {{even if the}} probability of default barely changes, and even if no defaults subsequently materialize. Introducing default and limited collateral into general equilibrium theory (GE) allows for a theory of endogenous contracts, including endogenous margin requirements on loans.

When new information raises the probability and shortens the horizon over which a fixed income asset may default, its drop in price may be much greater than its objective drop in value for two reasons: the drop in value reduces the relative wealth of its natural buyers and also endogenously raises the margin required for its purchase.

40|$|The work {{presented}} in this thesis describes {{the development and implementation}} of a number of ideas and methods that allow flvIRI to be carried out using echo-planar imaging at ultra high field strength, despite the significant problems associated with this. In the first study, EPI is used to probe how the gradient echo (GE) and spin echo (SE) BOLD responses relate to the underlying neurological processes, whilst the brain is in both its active and resting states. These finding show that SE BOLD contrast is harder to detect but less localised to areas around large draining veins than GE BOLD contrast and thus potentially more localised to sites that represent true functional areas of activation. The second study describes how dynamic flBa mapping can be performed during flvIRI experiments with a hyperoxic challenge, in order to assess the magnitude and extent of flBa effects that arise due to susceptibility differences between air and tissue. Developing on this, this work describes the steps involved in the design and implementation of a dual echo GE/SE EPI sequence and how it can be used to enable off-resonance effects, such as image distortion and signal concentration/dilution, to be corrected on a dynamic basis for, simultaneously acquired, GE and SE data. The final study demonstrates how such a sequence can be used to detect resting state networks. Showing that the correspondingly low temporal separation of the GE and SE data <b>allows</b> <b>GE</b> and SE BOLD contrast mechanisms to be compared in a number of novels ways in different resting state networks.

40|$|Grammatical Evolution (GE) is {{a method}} of utilising a general purpose {{evolutionary}} algorithm to evolve programs written in an arbitrary BNF grammar. This thesis extends GE as follows: GE {{as an extension of}} Genetic Programming (GP) A novel method of automatically extracting information from the grammar is introduced. This additional information allows the use of GP style crossover which in turn <b>allows</b> <b>GE</b> to perform identically to a strongly typed GP system as well as a non-typed (or canonical) GP system. Two test problems are presented one which is more easily solved by the GP style crossover and one which favours the tradition GE Ripple Crossover. With this new crossover operator GE can now emulate GP (as well as retaining its own unique features) and can therefore now be seen as an extension of GP. Dynamically Defined Functions An extension to the BNF grammar is presented which allows the use of dynamically defined functions (DDFs). DDFs provide an alternative to the traditional approach of Automatically Defined Functions (ADFs) but have the advantage that the number of functions and their parameters {{do not need to be}} specified by the user in advance. In addition DDFs allow the architecture of individuals to change dynamically throughout the course of the run without requiring the introduction of any new form of operator. Experimental results are presented confirming the effectiveness of DDFs. Self-Selecting (or variable) crossover. A self-selecting operator is introduced which allows the system to determine, during the course of the run, which crossover operator to apply; this is tested over several problem domains and (especially where small populations are used) is shown to be effective in aiding the system to overcome local optima.

The main objective of the EHEA is to improve the international competitiveness of the universities of the European Union.

The adaptation of the university degrees to the new framework of the EHEA, demands that all Andalusian universities improve their quality by means of the substitution of excessively theoretical education by an active education, based on a more practical training and on the use of new technologies, with the participation {{of the students in the}} learning process also being of special interest.

50|$|The {{company and}} town were named for Francis J. Pelzer, who {{surveyed}} sites {{along the river}} and laid out the town and was along with William Lebby and Ellison A.

When Smyth decided to build the fourth mill, he initially selected a site four miles downriver from the town along a shoal, necessitating construction of a new mill town. Eventually, however, Smyth decided to build a new mill at Pelzer and began construction at the Upper Mill site, with power generation coming from the downsteam shoals and dam.

40|$|As high-k dielectrics are {{introduced}} into commercial Si CMOS (Complimentary Metal Oxide Semiconductor) microelectronics, the 40 year channel/dielectric partnership of Si/SiO 2 is {{ended and the}} door opened for silicon to be replaced as the active channel material in MOSFETs (Metal Oxide Semiconductor Field Effect Transistor). Germanium is a good candidate as it has higher bulk carrier mobilities than silicon. In addition, Si and Ge form a thermodynamically stable SiGe alloy of any composition, <b>allowing</b> <b>Ge</b> to be implemented as a thin layer {{on the surface of}} a standard Si substrate. This thesis is a practical investigation on several aspects of Ge CMOS technology. High-k dielectric Ge p-MOSFETs are electrically characterised. A large variation in interface state densities is demonstrated to be responsible for a threshold voltage shift and this is proportional to reciprocal peak mobility due to the Coulomb scattering of carriers by charged states. A theoretical mobility is fitted to that measured at 4. 2 K and confirms that interface states are the main source of interface charged impurities. The model demonstrates a reduction in the interface charged impurity density in p-MOSFETs that underwent a PMA (Post Metallisation Anneal) in hydrogen atmosphere and that the anneal also reduces the RMS (Root Mean Square) dielectric/semiconductor interface roughness, from an average of 0. 60 nm to 0. 48 nm. High-k strained Ge p-MOSFETs are electrically characterised and have peak mobilities at 300 K (470 cm 2 V- 1 s- 1) and 4. 2 K (1780 cm 2 V- 1 s- 1) far in excess of those measured for the unstrained Ge p-MOSFETs (285 cm 2 V- 1 s- 1, 785 cm 2 V- 1 s- 1 respectively). Strained Ge n-MOSFETs perform significantly worse than standard Si P, - MOSFETs primarily due to a high source/drain resistance.
