5|$|Securing an {{airstrip}} {{would be}} an important objective for the invader. Airfields, considered extremely vulnerable, were protected by trench works and pillboxes which faced inwards towards the runway, rather than outwards. Many of these fortifications were specified by the Air Ministry and defensive designs were unique to airfields—these would {{not be expected to}} face heavy weapons so the degree of protection was less and there was more emphasis on <b>all-round</b> <b>visibility</b> and sweeping fields of fire. It was difficult to defend large open areas without creating impediments to the movement of friendly aircraft. Solutions to this problem included the pop-up Picket Hamilton fort—a light pillbox that could be lowered to ground level when the airfield was in use.|$|E
5|$|A {{key feature}} of the F-16's cockpit is the {{exceptional}} field of view. The single-piece, bird-proof polycarbonate bubble canopy provides 360° <b>all-round</b> <b>visibility,</b> with a 40° look-down angle {{over the side of}} the aircraft, and 15° down over the nose (compared to the common 12–13° of preceding aircraft); the pilot's seat is elevated for this purpose. Furthermore, the F-16's canopy lacks the forward bow frame found on many fighters, which is an obstruction to a pilot's forward vision. The F-16's ACES II zero/zero ejection seat is reclined at an unusual tilt-back angle of 30°; most fighters have a tilted seat at 13–15°. The tilted seat can accommodate taller pilots and increases G-force tolerance; however it has been associated with reports of neck ache, possibly caused by incorrect head-rest usage. Subsequent U.S. fighters have adopted more modest tilt-back angles of 20°. Due to the seat angle and the canopy's thickness, the ejection seat lacks canopy-breakers for emergency egress; instead the entire canopy is jettisoned prior to the seat's rocket firing.|$|E
25|$|There {{were also}} designs for pillbox-like {{structures}} for various purposes including light anti-aircraft positions, observation posts and searchlight positions {{to illuminate the}} shoreline. In addition, the Air Ministry provided designs of fortifications intended to protect airfields from troops landing or parachuting. These would {{not be expected to}} face heavy weapons so that the degree of protection was less and there was more emphasis on <b>all-round</b> <b>visibility</b> and sweeping fields of fire. Many of these were later reinforced.|$|E
50|$|In {{competition}} with the Gloster for the requirement were the Bristol Type 146, Martin-Baker M.B.2 and the Vickers Venom, which would be tested by the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment.Flight Magazine (1 July 1937) shows the F.5/34 taking off from Hucclecote airdrome and mentions its appearance at the RAF Display of that year.By the time the F.5/34 began its flight tests, the 8-gun Hawker Hurricane was in service and the Supermarine Spitfire in production so that further development of the Gloster fighter was abandoned. However, compared to its contemporaries, test pilots found the F.5/34 prototypes had a shorter takeoff, better initial climb, were more responsive and manoeuvrable due to ailerons that did not become excessively heavy at high speed. Handling was considered very good and the <b>all-round</b> cockpit <b>visibility</b> was far {{better than the other}} designs. The Gloster F.5/34 debuted at the 1938 Hendon Air Show, but soon after, both prototypes (K5604 and K8089) were relegated to experimental flying and finally as instructional airframes until May 1941.|$|R
25|$|On 12 January 1944, {{the first}} Meteor F.1, serial EE210/G, {{took to the}} air from Moreton Valence. It was {{essentially}} identical to the F9/40 prototypes except for the addition of four nose-mounted 20mm (.79in) Hispano Mk V cannons and some changes to the canopy to improve <b>all-round</b> <b>visibility.</b> Due to the F.1's similarity to the prototypes, they were frequently operated in the test program to progress British understanding of jet propulsion, and it took until July 1944 for the aircraft to enter squadron service. EE210/G was later sent to the U.S. for evaluation {{in exchange for a}} pre-production Bell XP-59A Airacomet, the Meteor being flown first by John Grierson at Muroc Army Airfield on 15 April 1944.|$|E
25|$|Apart {{from its}} method of propulsion, the Djinn was a {{relatively}} conventional helicopter, featuring a two-seat side-by-side configuration in an enclosed cabin. The cockpit is provided {{with an array of}} plexiglas panels, which provide the occupants {{with a high level of}} <b>all-round</b> <b>visibility.</b> Directly to the rear of the cockpit was the rotorcraft's single Palouste engine. The engine lacked any electronics and had to be hand-started via a crank handle located on the starboard side of the fuselage. The Djinn possessed the ability to fly at high overload weights for around 5 sec by correctly harnessing the accumulated kinetic energy of the rotor; this 'jump' technique was successfully used to achieve certification for it to be operated to carry heavy payloads, some of which could represent up to 54 per cent of the rotorcraft's overall gross weight.|$|E

2500|$|A Mk VIII JF299 {{was used}} to {{experiment}} {{with the use of}} a new cut-back rear fuselage and a [...] "tear-drop" [...] canopy. This was intended to aid pilot visibility; many Spitfire pilots who were shot down were done so by enemies who approached in the aircraft's blind spot. In trials, the new hood design was found to bring about great improvements to <b>all-round</b> <b>visibility</b> and with several modifications, was standardised on later Spitfires.|$|E
2500|$|Camm's {{priority}} {{was to provide}} the pilot with good <b>all-round</b> <b>visibility.</b> To this end, the cockpit was mounted reasonably high in the fuselage, creating a distinctive [...] "hump-backed" [...] silhouette. Pilot access to the cockpit was aided by a retractable [...] "stirrup" [...] mounted below {{the trailing edge of}} the port wing. This was linked to a spring-loaded hinged flap which covered a handhold on the fuselage, just behind the cockpit. When the flap was shut, the footstep retracted into the fuselage. In addition, both wing roots were coated with strips of non-slip material.|$|E
2500|$|Earlier {{aircraft}} designs generally featured canopies {{consisting of}} small plates of perspex (called Plexiglas in the United States) {{in a metal}} framework, with {{the top of the}} canopy even with the rear fuselage. This design considerably limited visibility, especially to the rear. The introduction of vacuum forming {{led to the creation of}} the [...] "bubble canopy" [...] which was largely self-supporting, and could be mounted over the cockpit, offering greatly improved <b>all-round</b> <b>visibility.</b> Tank's design for the Fw 190 used a canopy with a frame that ran around the perimeter, with only a short, centerline seam along the top, running rearward from the radio antenna fitting where the three-panel windscreen and forward edge of the canopy met, just in front of the pilot.|$|E
2500|$|The car {{featured}} a low modern body {{line with a}} prominent waist level groove reminiscent of the then fashionable Chevrolet Corvair. [...] At a time when monocoque construction was becoming mainstream, the 24 sat on a separate and very strong tubular steel chassis: [...] it was therefore possible, even using the economically available materials of the time, to keep the window pillars relatively thin which gave the car an airy cabin and outstanding <b>all-round</b> <b>visibility,</b> while class leading structural rigidity for the body could nonetheless be claimed, thanks to the pleating and reinforcement of the roof panel. The tubular steel front and rear subchassis were bolted to a platform frame that comprised {{the floor and the}} flat steel sidemembers. Under the skin, the structural architecture was little changed from that of the Dyna 54.|$|E
2500|$|Following combat {{experience}} the P-51D series introduced a [...] "teardrop", or [...] "bubble", canopy to rectify problems with poor visibility {{to the rear}} of the aircraft. In America, new moulding techniques had been developed to form streamlined nose transparencies for bombers. North American designed a new streamlined plexiglass canopy for the P-51B which was later developed into the teardrop shaped bubble canopy. In late 1942, the tenth production P-51B-1-NA was removed from the assembly lines. From the windshield aft the fuselage was redesigned by cutting down the rear fuselage formers to the same height as those forward of the cockpit; the new shape faired in to the vertical tail unit. [...] A new simpler style of windscreen, with an angled bullet-resistant windscreen mounted on two flat side pieces improved the forward view while the new canopy resulted in exceptional <b>all-round</b> <b>visibility.</b> Wind tunnel tests of a wooden model confirmed that the aerodynamics were sound.|$|E
50|$|In 1962 Holden {{launched}} a completely new, lower-profile streamlined body with more interior space, new foam-padded seating and better <b>all-round</b> <b>visibility.</b>|$|E

5000|$|The high driving {{position}} and large glass area affords drivers with good <b>all-round</b> <b>visibility,</b> while the rear lamps are mounted {{high up on}} the structure so other road users can see them more prominently. Doors are fitted with anti intrusion bars with child locks at the rear.|$|E
5000|$|Contemporary reports {{praised the}} <b>all-round</b> <b>visibility</b> and the {{commanding}} driving position while recording {{that it was}} necessary to lean forward a little to engage first and third gears due to the long travel distance of the gear lever. [...] The large 40 cm tall luggage compartment was also commended.|$|E
50|$|A {{pilothouse}} yacht is {{one where}} the design and layout allow the crew to keep a safe and effective watch without having to be on deck. There must be <b>all-round</b> <b>visibility</b> from within the yacht's accommodation - somewhere for a crewmember to keep watch comfortably whilst fully protected from the elements.|$|E
50|$|The HA set new {{standards}} in its day for lightweight, easy to operate controls, a slick short gearchange, lightweight steering and clutch pedal, good <b>all-round</b> <b>visibility</b> and relatively nippy performance. It {{was one of}} the first cars to be actively marketed towards women, perhaps as a result of these perceived benefits for them.|$|E
50|$|On 16 May 1942, the USAAF {{recommended}} {{the construction and}} testing of 25 XP-77s. The aircraft featured a single-engine, low-wing monoplane with mainly wood construction, equipped with tricycle landing gear, a Bell trademark that bestowed good ground handling. A sleek bubble canopy also provided <b>all-round</b> <b>visibility</b> (except forward due to the extended nose); a key requirement for a fighter.|$|E
50|$|The FL-23 {{prototype}} {{was designed}} and built as a private venture, it was a high-wing cantilever monoplane with an all-moving tailplane mounted {{at the top of}} the fin. It had a fixed tricycle landing gear and powered a 225-hp (168 kW) Continental E225 piston engine. It had room for a pilot and observer in tandem; the observer had an unusual acrylic plastic enclosure to give an <b>all-round</b> <b>visibility.</b>|$|E

5000|$|The last {{development}} of this aircraft was the D.3803, with [...] Saurer YS-3 engine, and modified dorsal fuselage (with an <b>all-round</b> <b>visibility</b> canopy). The D.3803 was armed with three HS-404 20 mm cannon (one in the nose, two in the wings), plus up to 200 kg bombs and rockets. Despite not having a powerful engine, the type reached 680 km/h at 7000 m. The performance was impressive, but the last {{development of}} this 1935 fighter design had several shortcomings and was not entirely successful. Its development was halted as P-51D Mustangs became available.|$|E
5000|$|Tall by {{contemporary}} standards, the K70 {{benefited from the}} space saving characteristics of its front wheel drive layout and compact engine installation. The boxy cabin was unusually spacious and the luggage capacity class leading. The driver sat slightly higher than in competitor vehicles and the large window area conferred above average <b>all-round</b> <b>visibility.</b> [...] The relatively large glass area also led to the car carrying an above average proportion of its weight above waist height, however, rendering a wide track particularly important {{in order to ensure}} lateral stability.|$|E
50|$|The Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5 was a British biplane fighter aircraft. In {{spite of}} {{possessing}} a square-and-boxy appearance, {{it was an}} advanced aircraft for the era; amongst its features, the S.E.5 was the first aircraft to be equipped with a pilot-adjustable tail-plane and a steerable tailskid. The S.E.5 was composed of a wire-braced box girder structure while the wings were furnished with wooden spars and internal ribs. The fuselage was narrower than many contemporary aircraft, which provided the pilot with good <b>all-round</b> <b>visibility.</b> The aircraft had considerable structural strength, which was credited with improving the type's crashworthiness and survivability. It could also withstand high-g manoeuvres and was relatively resistant to battle-damage.|$|E
50|$|Lanby buoy is a {{contraction}} of Large Automatic Navigation BuoY. Lanby buoys were first {{made in the}} USA by General Dynamics and adapted by Hawker Siddeley Dynamics for use in British waters in the early 1970s. The buoys were intended to replace lightships and were constructed as a circular hull with a central light to provide <b>all-round</b> <b>visibility</b> and a foghorn. They may also contain radio and radio beacons. The navigation buoy was to be monitored remotely from onshore and was designed to run for extended periods without repair. The running costs were estimated to {{be as little as}} 10% of those of a lightship.|$|E
50|$|The de Havilland Canada DHC-1 Chipmunk is a two-seat, {{single-engine}} aircraft {{that has been}} heavily used as a primary trainer aircraft. The basic configuration of the aircraft included a low-mounted wing and a two-place tandem cockpit, which was fitted with a clear perspex canopy covers the pilot/student (front) and instructor/passenger (rear) positions and provided <b>all-round</b> <b>visibility.</b> The Chipmunk uses a conventional tailwheel landing gear arrangement and is fitted with fabric-covered flight control surfaces; the wing is also fabric-covered aft of the spar. In terms of handling, the Chipmunk exhibited a gentle and responsive flight attitude. Early production aircraft were only semi-aerobatic, while later production models were almost all fully aerobatic.|$|E
50|$|Development of the {{aircraft}} began in 1938 at the Yokosuka Naval Air Technical Arsenal as a carrier-based dive bomber to replace the Aichi D3A. The aircraft was a single-engine, all-metal low-wing monoplane, with a wide-track retractable undercarriage and wing-mounted dive brakes. It had a crew of two: a pilot and a navigator/radio-operator/gunner, seated under a long, glazed canopy which provided good <b>all-round</b> <b>visibility.</b> The pilot of bomber versions was provided with a telescopic bombsight. The aircraft was powered by an Aichi Atsuta liquid-cooled inverted V12 engine, a licensed copy of the German DB 601, rated at 895 kW (1,200 hp). The radiator was behind and below the three-blade propeller, as in the P-40 Warhawk.|$|E
50|$|In 1962, {{with the}} {{introduction}} of the Tu-22, it became increasingly clear that the aircraft was considerably inadequate in its role as a bomber. In addition to widespread unserviceability and maintenance issues, the Tu-22’s handling characteristics proved to be dangerous. Its landing speed was some 100 km/h greater than previous bombers and it had a tendency to pitch up and strike its tail upon landing. It was difficult to fly, and had poor <b>all-round</b> <b>visibility.</b> In 1962, Tupolev commenced work on major update of the Tu-22. Initially, the bureau planned to add a variable-sweep wing and uprated engines into the updated design. The design was tested at TsAGI’s wind tunnels at Zhukovsky.|$|E

50|$|The cockpit has two seats, {{arranged}} in tandem, outfitted with Martin-Baker GRU-7A rocket-propelled ejection seats, rated from zero altitude and zero airspeed up to 450 knots. The canopy is spacious, and fitted with four mirrors to effectively provide <b>all-round</b> <b>visibility.</b> Only the pilot has flight controls; the flight instruments themselves {{are of a}} hybrid analog-digital nature. The cockpit also features a head-up display (HUD) to show primarily navigational information; several other avionics systems such as communications and direction-finders are integrated into the AWG-9 radar's display. A significant feature of the F-14 was its Central Air Data Computer (CADC), designed by Garrett AiResearch, that formed the onboard integrated flight control system. It used a MOSFET-based Large-Scale Integration chipset, the MP944, making it possibly the first microprocessor in history.|$|E
50|$|The nest {{is often}} {{built in a}} {{roadside}} tree with good <b>all-round</b> <b>visibility</b> some 4 to 10 m off the ground. It is built by both birds out of the stems of various flowering plants such as cudweed (Gnaphalium) and (Filago), and thyme (Thymus), and lined with whisps of wool, hairs, roots and feathers. There are five to seven eggs in the clutch, usually bluish green blotched with greenish-brown. Sometimes the background colour is cream or buff with pinkish-brown blotches. Their average size is 26.1 x 18.2 mm. Incubation lasts about fifteen days and is chiefly done by the female though both parents take part. They both feed the young which are ready to leave the nest after about fourteen days. There is usually a single brood.|$|E
