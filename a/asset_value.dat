5|$|In 1982, Boddingtons {{bought the}} Oldham Brewery for £23million, hoping to combine Oldham's {{strength}} in lager and keg bitter {{with their own}} expertise in cask ales. After the acquisition, the company owned 272 public houses, 70 per cent of which were within 20 miles of its Manchester brewery. In 1983, Boddingtons Bitter was distributed in the Home Counties for the first time. In 1985 Boddingtons paid £27.5million for the 160,000 barrel capacity Higsons Brewery in Liverpool and its tied estate of 160 public houses to form a combine with a £65million turnover. The Guardian commented {{that the company had}} paid mere <b>asset</b> <b>value</b> for Higsons as the company had been reporting poor profits. There was virtually no overlap between the two companies, and the takeover brought Boddingtons to Merseyside for the first time. By this time Strangeways was producing only two beers, a bitter and a mild, with bitter constituting over 90 per cent of production. In 1986, the company employed 280 people and operated 530 tied houses, and while Strangeways Brewery had a capacity of 500,000 barrels a year, it was operating at around 50 per cent capacity. That year the company introduced its own lager, brewing Kaltenberg under licence.|$|E

25|$|An ETF {{combines}} the valuation feature of {{a mutual fund}} or unit investment trust, which can be bought or sold {{at the end of}} each trading day for its net <b>asset</b> <b>value,</b> with the tradability feature of a closed-end fund, which trades throughout the trading day at prices that may be more or less than its net <b>asset</b> <b>value.</b> Closed-end funds are not considered to be ETFs, even though they are funds and are traded on an exchange. ETFs have been available in the US since 1993 and in Europe since 1999. ETFs traditionally have been index funds, but in 2008 the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission began to authorize the creation of actively managed ETFs.|$|E

40|$|Because {{the assets}} held by {{publicly}} traded real estate companies are infrequently traded, their values must be estimated {{to determine the}} relationship between share prices and net <b>asset</b> <b>values</b> for investment purposes. Alternative modeling approaches may be followed to accomplish these valuations, including income-based and transaction-based models. The real estate values of publicly traded firms are estimated in this study using a hedonic pricing model that combines the market 2 ̆ 7 s valuation of the fundamental characteristics of the assets with the specific characteristics of each <b>asset</b> being <b>valued.</b> After converting <b>asset</b> <b>values</b> to estimates of net <b>asset</b> <b>values,</b> the net <b>asset</b> <b>values</b> are compared to the market valuations of firms 2 ̆ 7 equity claims.

25|$|Hedge fund {{administrators are}} {{responsible}} for operations, accounting, and valuation services. This back office support allows fund managers to concentrate on trades. Administrators also process subscriptions and redemptions, and perform various shareholder services. Hedge funds in the United States {{are not required to}} appoint an administrator, and all of these functions can be performed by an investment manager. A number of conflict of interest situations may arise in this arrangement, particularly in the calculation of a fund's net <b>asset</b> <b>value</b> (NAV). Some funds voluntarily employ external auditors, thereby offering a greater degree of transparency.|$|E
25|$|With the $38 million {{deficit of}} the Astrodome, {{control of the}} Astrodomain was passed from Judge Roy Hofheinz to GE Credit and Ford Motor Credit. This {{included}} the Astros. The creditors were just interested in preserving <b>asset</b> <b>value</b> of the team, so any money spent had to be found or saved somewhere else.

25|$|The {{decision}} by the European Commission (EC) in 2008 to accord secondary slot trading by European airlines – the practice of buying and selling take-off and landing slots at congested airports – legal recognition resulted in BMI valuing its Heathrow slot holding at £770million. Its first-time inclusion in BMI's 2007 annual report also resulted in a huge boost to the airline's net <b>asset</b> <b>value,</b> which stood at only £12million the year before. It can therefore {{be argued that the}} EC's decision to legalise this practice made BMI an attractive takeover target for other Heathrow-based airlines and helped it avert bankruptcy.|$|E
3000|$|Finally, the {{remaining}} notation {{to be used}} in the sequel is as follows. Let [...] V^i and Π ^i, for i={T,P}, be the <b>asset</b> <b>values</b> of a worker with contract i and of a firm with job i, respectively. Also V ^u and H denote the <b>asset</b> <b>values</b> for the outside options of workers being unemployed and of firms opening a vacancy (always consisting of a temporary job), respectively. To highlight in a tractable way the incentives’ channel explored here, we simplify the analysis by taking both of these <b>asset</b> <b>values</b> to be exogenously given. Thus, our approach is a partial equilibrium one where we focus on the short-term effects of changes in F on the endogenous variables in the model (effort, conversion rates, wages, and training). Rents to be shared arise in this setup because we consider those cases where the <b>asset</b> <b>values</b> of workers being employed and firms opening vacancies exceed the given values of their outside options.|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} {{a system where}} the <b>asset</b> <b>values</b> of firms are correlated with the default thresholds. We first evaluate the probability of default of a single firm under the correlated assets assumptions. This extends Merton’s probability of default of a single firm under the independent <b>asset</b> <b>values</b> assumption. At any time, the distance-to-default for a single firm is derived in the system, and this distance-to-default should provide a different measure for credit rating with the correlated <b>asset</b> <b>values</b> into consideration. Then we derive a closed formula for the joint default probability and a general closed formula for the default correlation via the correlated multivariate process of the first-passage-time default correlation model. Our structural model encodes the sensitivities of default correlations {{with respect to the}} underlying correlation among firms’ <b>asset</b> <b>values.</b> We propose the disparate credit risk management from our result in contrast to the commonly used risk measurement methods considering default correlations into consideration...|$|R

25|$|Management {{fees are}} {{calculated}} {{as a percentage}} of the fund's net <b>asset</b> <b>value</b> and typically range from 1% to 4% per annum, with 2% being standard. They are usually expressed as an annual percentage, but calculated and paid monthly or quarterly. Management fees for hedge funds are designed to cover the operating costs of the manager, whereas the performance fee provides the manager's profits. However, due to economies of scale the management fee from larger funds can generate a significant part of a manager's profits, and as a result some fees have been criticized by some public pension funds, such as CalPERS, for being too high.|$|E
25|$|ETF {{distributors}} only {{buy or sell}} ETFs {{directly from}} or to authorized participants, which are large broker-dealers with whom they have entered into agreements—and then, only in creation units, which are large blocks {{of tens of thousands}} of ETF shares, usually exchanged in-kind with baskets of the underlying securities. Authorized participants may wish to invest in the ETF shares for the long-term, but they usually act as market makers on the open market, using their ability to exchange creation units with their underlying securities to provide liquidity of the ETF shares and help ensure that their intraday market price approximates the net <b>asset</b> <b>value</b> of the underlying assets. Other investors, such as individuals using a retail broker, trade ETF shares on this secondary market.|$|E
25|$|ETFs are {{dependent}} on {{the efficacy of the}} arbitrage mechanism in order for their share price to track net <b>asset</b> <b>value.</b> While the average deviation between the daily closing price and the daily NAV of ETFs that track domestic indices is generally less than 2%, the deviations may be more significant for ETFs that track certain foreign indices. The Wall Street Journal reported in November 2008, during a period of market turbulence, that some lightly traded ETFs frequently had deviations of 5% or more, exceeding 10% in a handful of cases, although even for these niche ETFs, the average deviation was only a little more than 1%. The trades with the greatest deviations tended to be made immediately after the market opened.|$|E
