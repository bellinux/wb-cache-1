On an inspection tour to Semarang in 1814, he was informed about a big monument deep in a jungle near the village of Bumisegoro. He was not able to make the discovery himself and sent H.C.

5|$|The 9th Earl of Shaftesbury, {{prior to}} his death, {{invested}} and arranged financial matters so that his heirs would avoid death duties. When his grandfather died, the newly titled 10th Earl of Shaftesbury came into a vast fortune of the Shaftesbury estates and other properties, including the family's 17th-century home and large estate in Dorset, as well as residences in Hove, London, Versailles and the French Riviera. Shaftesbury also inherited a collection of art, <b>antiques,</b> <b>and</b> other valuables worth over £3m. By the 1990s, {{the wealth of the}} family estate remained well worth millions.|$|E

To his surprise, he finds a woman wrapped in a rug. His boss comes to check on him; while he is yelling for Anson, his mouth disappears. FBI agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) speak with the boss, Jay Gilmore, after surgery to fix his mouth, which has left him disfigured and with a speech impediment. They question Stokes' brother Leslie at their mobile home, which inexplicably has a large boat in its tiny front yard. The woman from the storage container is in the Stokes brothers' kitchen. Mulder and Scully search the container and find old <b>antiques</b> <b>and</b> {{a picture of the}} previous owner with the woman from the apartment.|$|E

After not hearing from Shaftesbury in a week, they remained concerned when he failed {{to return to his}} rented flat in Adelaide Crescent, Hove. Bensaude and Orche both expressed fears for his safety. Shaftesbury had been taking legal action in relation to the theft of some family <b>antiques</b> <b>and</b> artwork. Some friends and acquaintances mentioned that he had complained of money problems, so they surmised that his disappearance may {{have had something to do}} with the theft and financial loss.|$|E

5|$|Scientists at GCI {{viewed the}} CheMin {{instrument}} aboard the Curiosity rover, currently exploring the Gale crater on Mars, as a potentially valuable means to examine ancient {{works of art}} without damaging them. Until recently, only a few instruments were available to determine the composition without cutting out physical samples large enough to potentially damage the artifacts. The CheMin on Curiosity directs a beam of X-rays at particles as small as 400µm and reads the radiation scattered back to determine the composition of an object in minutes. Engineers created a smaller, portable version, named the X-Duetto. Fitting into a few briefcase-sized boxes, it can examine objects on site, while preserving their physical integrity. It is now being used by Getty scientists to analyze a large collection of museum <b>antiques</b> <b>and</b> the Roman ruins of Herculaneum, Italy.|$|E
