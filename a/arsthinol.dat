50|$|<b>Arsthinol</b> (INN) is an {{antiprotozoal}} agent. It was synthesized for {{the first}} time in 1949 by Ernst A.H. Friedheim by complexation of acetarsol with 2,3-dimercaptopropanol (British anti-Lewisite) and has been demonstrated to be effective against amoebiasis and yaws. It was marketed few years later by Endo Products (Balarsen, Tablets, 0.1 g).Among trivalent organoarsenicals, arthinol was considered as very well tolerated. Recently, it was studied for its anticancer activity.|$|E
40|$|International audienceOBJECTIVES: The organoarsenical <b>arsthinol</b> {{was used}} in the 1950 s in the {{treatment}} of amoebiasis and yaws and was considered as 'highly tolerated'. The aim of this work was to study its anti-leukaemic activity and to develop nanosuspensions of the drug, thereby limiting brain concentrations and the risk of encephalopathy. METHODS: <b>Arsthinol</b> nanosuspensions were produced by high-pressure homogenization. The anti-leukaemic activity was assessed on NB 4 acute promyelocytic leukaemia cells (vs solutions of <b>arsthinol,</b> As(2) O(3) and melarsoprol). In addition, a pharmacokinetics study was performed to compare the nanosuspensions and the solution of <b>arsthinol.</b> KEY FINDINGS: <b>Arsthinol</b> induced growth inhibition of NB 4 cells at lower concentration (IC 50 (concentration inhibiting growth by 50 %) = 0. 78 +/- 0. 08 micromol/l after 24 h) than As(2) O(3) (IC 50 = 1. 60 +/- 0. 23 micromol/l after 24 h) or melarsoprol (IC 50 = 1. 44 +/- 0. 08 micromol/l after 24 h). When formulated as nanosuspension, <b>arsthinol</b> remained cytotoxic (IC 50 = 1. 33 +/- 0. 30 micromol/l after 24 h). This formulation also reduced the drug's access to the brain (C(max) = 0. 03 micromol/g) whereas bone marrow concentrations remained very high (C(max) = 2 micromol/g). CONCLUSIONS: Nanosuspensions of <b>arsthinol</b> could be proposed for further studies in the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukaemia...|$|E
40|$|International audienceRecent {{investigations}} {{have shown that}} <b>arsthinol,</b> a trivalent organoarsenic compound (dithiarsolane), {{has been active in}} vitro on leukemia cell lines and offers a better therapeutic index than arsenic trioxide, as estimated by the ratio LD 50 /IC 50. To complete our understanding of its urinary excretion, a sensitive method using liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (LC-MS) was used. Mice were injected intravenously with a single dose of <b>arsthinol</b> at 0. 2 mmol/kg of body weight. The amount of total arsenic in tissues and body fluids was determined by a colorimetric method and urine metabolites were analyzed on a C 18 Acclaim PepMap 100 A column by LC-MS. Our results showed that only three arsenic species (acetarsol, acetarsol oxide and <b>arsthinol)</b> were detected in the first 24 -h urine. Overall, this study confirms that the hydrolysis of dithiarsolanes to arsenoxides (i. e. acetarsol oxide) can be followed by an oxidation in arsonic acids (i. e. acetarsol). All these compounds are excreted in the urine...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn this paper, we {{examined}} arsthinol–cyclodextrin complexes, which display an anticancer activity. The association constants were 17, 502 ± 522 M À 1 for hydroxypropyl-b-cyclodextrin and 12, 038 ± 10, 168 M À 1 for randomized methylated b-cyclodextrin. 1 H NMR experiments in solution also confirmed {{the formation of}} these complexes and demonstrated an insertion of the <b>arsthinol</b> (STB) with its dithiarsolane extremity into the wide rim of the hydroxypropyl-b-cyclodextrin cavity. Complexed <b>arsthinol</b> was more effective than arsenic trioxide (As 2 O 3) and melarsoprol on the U 87 MG cell line. Importantly, in the in vivo study, we observed significant antitumor activity against heterotopic xenografts after i. p. administration and did not see any signs of toxicity. This remains to be verified using an orthotopic model...|$|E
40|$|International audienceMelarsoprol and <b>arsthinol</b> {{have been}} shown to be {{effective}} on various leukaemia cell lines. Nevertheless, the tissue distribution of these compounds remains a key point since the bone marrow is considered as the site of action and the central nervous system as the site of the main toxicity. In this study, we have determined the exposure of each organ (blood, liver, bone marrow and brain) to arsenic, irrespectively of the exact nature of arsenic species contained by the organ. In the bone marrow, arsenic concentrations were very high, especially that of melarsoprol. However, the lower ability of <b>arsthinol</b> to concentrate in the bone marrow could be compensated by its higher antileukaemic activity. The brain concentrations were high, although lower than in the bone marrow; this fact is in very good accordance with the observation that the brain is mainly involved in the acute toxicity of trivalent organoarsenicals...|$|E
40|$|International audienceFor several decades, {{organometallic}} and organometalloid compounds {{have played}} {{an important part in}} anticancer chemotherapies, in particular those derived from platinum. Trivalent arsenic, in the form of arsenic trioxide (As 2 O 3; Trisenox(R)) is currently used in the treatment of refractory leukemias, but at the cost of major adverse effects. Moreover, recent studies showed that the trypanocide melarsoprol, could be more effective than arsenic trioxide on myelogenous leukaemias. We have synthesized a series of derivatives from 2 -phenyl-[1, 3, 2]dithiarsolan- 4 -yl) -methanol (AsIII). Our work shows that the substitution of the aromatic ring by an iodine atom in the ortho position or by an amino-dimethoxytriazin group in the para position increases very significantly the antileukemic activity and improves the therapeutic index (IT=LD 50 /IC 50) of these melarsoprol-derivatives molecules, as compared to arsenic trioxide. However, {{one of the most promising}} compounds seems to be <b>arsthinol,</b> an old drug used in the past as an amebicide. Nanoparticle carriers of melarsoprol were also prepared for the purpose of modifying its tissue distribution reduce its brain toxicity...|$|E
