5|$|The {{skirmish}} {{became a}} full-scale battle by 4:00p.m. After the Americans drove Captain Pipe's Delawares {{out of the}} woods and onto to prairie, the Delawares were reinforced by Dunquat's Wyandots. Elliott also arrived on the scene and coordinated the actions of the Delawares and the Wyandots. Pipe's Delawares skillfully outflanked the American position and then attacked their rear. A few Indians crept close to the American lines in the tall prairie grass. The Americans responded by climbing trees to get <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>shot</b> at them. Gunsmoke filled the air, making it difficult to see. After {{three and a half hours}} of incessant firing, the Indians gradually broke off the attack with the approach of nightfall. Both sides slept with arms at the ready, and surrounded their positions with large fires to prevent surprise night attacks.|$|E

In a controversial incident in game four, an Alfredsson slap shot hit Ducks captain Scott Niedermayer {{at the end of the}} second period, leading to speculation that Alfredsson intended to injure Niedermayer. Alfredsson dismissed the notion, saying that he had glanced up at the clock to see if he had time to move in for <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>shot,</b> and then quickly fired in the heat of an important game.|$|E

The initial offering consisted of an optional expansion card for Apple's new line of iBook notebooks and an AirPort Base Station. The AirPort card (a repackaged Lucent ORiNOCO Gold Card PC Card adapter) was later added as an option for almost all of Apple's product line, including PowerBooks, eMacs, iMacs, and Power Macs. Only Xserves do not have it as a standard or optional feature. The original AirPort system allowed transfer rates up to 11 Mbit/s and was commonly used to share Internet access and files between multiple computers.|$|E
25|$|In the 2010 Grand Slam of Darts, King played then-BDO player John Henderson in {{his last}} group game. Despite winning the game 5–4, he {{exchanged}} heated words with Henderson {{towards the end of}} the match and was visibly unhappy. Whilst refusing to reveal the precise reason to his actions, it was understood through television analysis that King felt Henderson, after having to move across the oche for <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>shot</b> with his third dart, had stepped across the oche line and thrown from a closer distance to the board, thus believing he had gained an unfair advantage. It was also discovered that King had complained to the match referee, George Noble, about the alleged infringement. Many pundits, most notably Chris Mason, pointed out that Henderson rarely checks his standing position before throwing, and publicly criticised King for insinuating that Henderson cheated. However, two days later King admitted that he had overreacted after watching the match again on television and apologised to Henderson during a pre-match interview. King was booed by the crowd while attempting to hit a double four to win in the deciding leg of the second round match against James Wade; he failed, and lost.|$|E

[...] Following the release of the album, the band remained on the road {{for an extended period of}} time. They chose to remain in Macon, despite suggestions from label executives to move to larger cities for <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>shot</b> at commercial acceptance.|$|E

While Norman is getting ready, Murphy steals his clothes, but Norman goes with Sue to see the Falls wearing a raincoat provided by the tour company. When a tour employee demands the raincoat, Norman is shown to have only a bath towel on underneath. Norman arranges a candle-lit dinner for two in Chicago, but Murphy invites all the other passengers. When the bus later has engine trouble, the passengers go to a nearby carnival, where Norman challenges Sue to a bow and arrow contest; the prize, if he wins, is a kiss, but she proves to be <b>a</b> much <b>better</b> <b>shot.</b> Later, though, Sue finally lets him kiss her.|$|R
50|$|The 1952 Democratic {{convention}} {{was the second}} political convention to be televised live, coast-to-coast (following the Republican Convention weeks earlier). Experiments in regionally broadcasting conventions {{took place during the}} Democratic and Republican conventions in 1948, however 1952 was the first year in which networks carried nationwide coverage of political conventions. After carefully watching the Republican Convention, the Democratic Party made last-minute alterations to their convention held in the same venue to make its broadcast more appealing to television audiences. They constructed a tower {{in the center of the}} convention hall to allow for <b>a</b> <b>better</b> camera <b>shot</b> of the podium, and they exercised more control over camera shots and the conduct of delegates in front of the cameras.|$|R

500|$|Weber {{was born}} on August 14, 1985, in Sicamous, British Columbia. His mother, Tracy, was a hairdresser, and his father, James Weber, a sawmill worker. Weber first played {{organized}} ice hockey {{at the age of}} six. Growing up he played in the Sicamous and District Minor Hockey Association, a division of the British Columbia Amateur Hockey Association (BCAHA), often switching between forward and defenceman positions. In Weber's second year of bantam, he permanently switched to defence. He credits his father for convincing him to make the switch because he thought Weber would [...] "have <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>shot</b> at a pro career as a defenceman". Between the ages of fourteen and fifteen, Weber grew 5inches, from 5-foot-9 (1.75 metres) to 6-foot-2 (1.88 metres).|$|E
500|$|NBC were {{positive}} about the project, {{but there was still}} some concern that the homosexual subject matter would cause alarm. Ellen DeGeneres' sitcom Ellen that aired on ABC was canceled the year before Will & Grace premiered because ratings had plummeted after the show became [...] "too gay". Despite the criticism ABC received for DeGeneres' coming out episode, [...] "The Puppy Episode", [...] "there's no question that show made it easier for Will & Grace to make it on the air," [...] said Kohan. He added, [...] "Will & Grace had <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>shot</b> at succeeding where Ellen failed, however, because Will has known about his homosexuality for twenty years. He's not exploring that awkward territory {{for the first time as}} Ellen did. The process of self-discovery and the pain most gay men go through is fascinating, but the average American is put off by it." [...] Kohan also commented that rather than concentrating on Will's sexuality, Will & Grace is using it as a device: [...] "It's like that When Harry Met Sally... line when Billy Crystal says, 'A man and woman can never be friends, because sex always gets in the way.' What we want to explore is what happens between a man and a woman when sex doesn't get in the way." ...|$|E

Joint custody of Little Adam is what both agree to.|$|E
60|$|The moment Sir John {{was alone}} he wrote an almost angry note {{to his friend}} Honybun, in {{conjunction}} with whom and another Member of Parliament he had the shooting in Suffolk. Honybun, {{who was also a}} lawyer, though less successful than his friend, was <b>a</b> much <b>better</b> <b>shot,</b> and was already taking the cream off the milk of the shooting. 'I cannot conceive,' he said {{at the end of his}} letter, 'that, after all my experience, I should have put myself so much out of my way to serve a client. A man should do what he's paid to do, and what it is presumed that he will do, and nothing more. But here I have been instigated by an insane ambition to emulate the good-natured zeal of a fellow who is absolutely willing to sacrifice himself for the good of a stranger.'

5000|$|The {{player who}} {{initially}} {{had the ball}} on that final play was Rod [...] "Hot Rod" [...] Hundley. And Hundley had in fact dreamt the night before {{that he would make}} the championship-winning shot. And further, after pump-faking his defender into the air, Hundley indeed briefly had an opening to take a shot. But rather than selfishly insisting upon attempting to play out his dream in real life, when Hundley noticed that Selvy was open for <b>an</b> even <b>better</b> <b>shot</b> [...] - [...] a shot that Selvy usually could be counted upon to make [...] - [...] Hundley gave up his own chance for glory and passed the ball. Selvy's miss, however, meant that Hundley's sacrifice had been for naught and that Hundley would never know if indeed he would have won the championship himself, had he taken the shot he had available. Because of this, Hundley would occasionally call Selvy and, when Selvy answered the phone, Hundley would simply say, [...] "Nice shot!" [...] and then hang up. For his part, Selvy has expressed some degree of irritation at Hundley's teasing.|$|R
2500|$|The NBL and the {{international}} UCI uses the [...] "Olympic" [...] or Moto System of advancing to the Main. In the Moto System, you must race all three times to make the main or if the race is a large one semi finals. It is a formula combining how well you do with all the registered participant riders in your class racing all three times. It cumulatively determines who will race in the finals. The higher your points total, {{the more likely you}} will advance. For instance if you come in 1st, 1st and 1st, 40+50+60, which is 150 points, you are a virtual certainty to race in the Main (or in large races you are merely transferred to the quarter/semi-finals) barring disqualification for some reason. If you come in Last, Last, First, which in a race with eight men in your class translates to 0+0+60 or 60 points, you MIGHT race in the main (or in larger races the 1/8/quarter/semi finals) determining how well the others did. The person who came in 3rd place in all three motos or 30+40+50=120p would have a much better shot at making the Main than you. Even the person who came in 2nd+6th+6th or 35+25+35=95 would have <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>shot</b> even if you won the final moto.|$|E
2500|$|He {{improved}} his fitness {{and was one}} of two wicket keepers selected for the 1957-58 tour of South Africa. Grout's competitor for the Test spot was Barry Jarman, and to make matters worse, he had sustained a hairline thumb fracture. Downplayed the injury, he picked up 95 in an innings at Benoni and was given the nod. He made his Test debut against in the first test against South Africa at Wanderers Stadium on 23–28 December 1957. Grout got off to a bad start, and allowed eight byes in the first innings in what he called [...] "a severe attack of the fumbles". During the second innings, he was helped by some inspired bowling from Alan Davidson and took what was then a record six catches behind the stumps. Grout was impressed at the grounds and the hospitality on the South African tour, yet it was not without its risks; early on, some of the Australians (not Grout) were quoted in the local press as being unimpressed with the South African opening bowlers Adcock and Heine, this fired them up and Grout and teammate Les Favell copped a barrage of fearsome bowling in a match against Transvaal. The two fired down numerous bouncers against the Australians in the last innings of the fifth test. Grout and Neil Harvey faced danger of a different kind as the two were chased by elephants and lions in Wanke Games Reserve after Harvey left the vehicle attempting to get <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>shot.</b>|$|E

They were still cursing him when <b>a</b> second <b>shot,</b> <b>better</b> aimed than the first, came to crumple one of the boats into splinters, flinging its crew, dead and living, into the water.|$|R
6000|$|Another hen turkey {{flew down}} from a rather low height. Then I made out grapevines, and I saw several {{animated}} dark patches among them. As I looked three turkeys flopped down to the ground. One was a gobbler of considerable size, with beautiful white and bronze feathers. Rather suspiciously he looked down our way. The distance was not {{more than a hundred}} yards. I aimed at him, feeling as I did so how Romer quivered beside me, but I had no confidence in Copple's rifle. The sights were wrong for me. The stock did not fit me. So, hoping for <b>a</b> closer and <b>better</b> <b>shot,</b> I let this opportunity pass. Of course I should have taken it. The gobbler clucked and began to trot up the ridge, with the others after him. They were not frightened, but they appeared rather suspicious. When they disappeared in the woods Romer and I got up, and hurried in pursuit. [...] "Gee! why didn't you peg that gobbler?" [...] broke out Romer, breathlessly. [...] "Wasn't he a peach?" ...|$|R
500|$|Reilly further {{added that}} the renewal was also {{prompted}} by the high risk of trying to replace Fringe with another show with unknown viewership metrics; he commented that they [...] "have <b>a</b> far <b>better</b> <b>shot</b> of sticking with a show that has an audience that [...] think [...] can grow". Prior to {{the onset of the}} fourth season, Reilly reiterated that they do not expect any significant growth in Fringes viewership within that season: [...] "It’s a pretty complex show. If Fringe can do exactly what Fringe did last year, we’re going to be very happy. They’re right in the pocket creatively once again." [...] Wyman stated in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter that the Fox network had been [...] "supportive throughout this process", and though the show's viewership [...] "wasn't exactly what they would've hoped for", aspects such as a loyal fan base and supportive critics were enough to take the show forward for another season. Pinkner commented that [...] "there were no creative conditions" [...] on the show's renewal, nor any cuts in the show's budget, though was unsure if the show will be moved to a different time slot. Noble, at the 2011 Comic-Con Fringe panel, reiterated that the fans were responsible for the livelihood of the show, stated, [...] "Seriously, without your efforts, your rabid support, we wouldn’t be here right now. You are the best fans that ever existed". The fourth season premiered on September 23, 2011.|$|R

50|$|Every {{mercenary}} {{has four}} attributes - health, agility, dexterity, wisdom, and four skills - medical, explosives, mechanical and marksmanship. Health determines the amount damage a mercenary can take, agility determines how many action points they have, dexterity helps in using weapons {{and other items}} in their various conditions, wisdom enables mercenaries to get experience quicker, medical helps to heal wounded characters, explosives helps to disarm bombs and activate the mercenary's own explosives, mechanical helps to pick locks and combine items together and marksmanship helps to get <b>a</b> <b>better</b> aim and <b>shot</b> on enemies. The mercenaries employed by the player gain experience from the actions they perform. For example, a mercenary that bandages a wound might improve his medical skill. Mercenaries may also permanently lose attribute points from an injury. For example, a {{hit in the head}} might reduce mercenary's wisdom or a hit in the leg might reduce his agility.|$|R

The mode & takes into account two essential beneficial effects that are: compressive residual stresses and the increase of cold work. It was demonstrated that the effect of cold work on fatigue strength is more important than that of residual stress. The fatigue limit criterion predicts that the crack origin is located into the region under the surface hardened layer. Comparison of predictions of this criterion against experimental fatigue limit data showed good agreement. The methodology followed to build this model could be adequately modified to derive models for other surface treatments...|$|R
