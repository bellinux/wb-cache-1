2500|$|It is {{not known}} for certain when the WCC was founded {{but it seems to}} have been after 1780 and {{certainly}} by 1785. According to Pelham Warner, it was formed in 1782 as an offshoot from a West End convivial club called the Je-ne-sais-quoi, some of whose members frequented the White Conduit House in Islington and played matches on the neighbouring White Conduit Fields. The famous batsman Billy Beldham was hired while still a young professional by the WCC in 1785 and he told James Pycroft, author of The Cricket Field (1851) that his farming employer concluded a deal with George Finch, 9th Earl of Winchilsea to allow Beldham time off his <b>agricultural</b> <b>duties</b> to go to the [...] "new cricket ground" [...] at White Conduit Fields and play for Hampshire (or more accurately, the Hambledon Club) against All-England. The score of this match has evidently been lost because there is no trace of an All-England v Hampshire game at White Conduit Fields in or about 1785. Beldham's first match in Scores & Biographies was for All-England v WCC at Lord's in 1787; but he was previously recorded as playing for Berkshire against Essex in 1785 (this match was recorded by H.

40|$|Without any tax {{sovereignty}} {{of its own}} and faced with a substantial decline in the volume of "traditional own resources" (customs <b>duties,</b> <b>agricultural</b> levies, sugar levies), the European Union is left with a very low level of revenue autonomy. The EU budget is financed primarily from national contributions by the member states. Hence, controversies {{are more and more}} likely to arise over the EU budget and, in the long run, the Union is at risk of being underfinanced. Moreover, there is a growing contradiction between the absence of EU {{tax sovereignty}}, on the one hand, and the intensified pace of European integration, on the other hand. Despite the associated increase of cross-border externalities (mainly environmental damage), no recourse is being taken to taxation at the European level as a steering instrument. Another point worth noting in this context is that EU funds are used to finance a range of "European public goods" and activities with positive cross-border externalities. This holds, in particular, for expenditure for research, education and the transport infrastructure, which is subject to decisions taken at the European level. With a view to fiscal equivalence, it would be appropriate also to collect the taxes required to finance such expenditure at the European level. Apart from that, any attempt to reform the EU's system of own resources should also be aimed at its simplification. EU Finanzrahmen 2006 - 2013 Finanzierung...|$|R

40|$|This {{exploratory}} rapid review {{finds that}} child labour in agriculture {{is a global}} issue, with the agricultural sector accounting {{for the majority of}} child labourers. Across regions and countries agriculture is usually the main sector for children’s economic activity. However, there is considerable variation in the prevalence of child labour between and within countries. Agricultural child labour is mainly unpaid work on smallholder family farms, but is also found on commercial farms and plantations as well as through forced and trafficked child labour. Child labour is involved in crop production, livestock (including herding) and forestry as well as fishing and aquaculture. There are more boys than girls in agricultural child labour, and both tend to start young, sometimes before 10 years old. Girls tend to combine <b>agricultural</b> and domestic <b>duties,</b> and their work is more invisible, while male adolescents {{are more likely to be}} in hazardous work in agriculture than their female peers. Children from poor households, ethnic minorities, migrants and families with HIV/AIDS or disabled members are particularly vulnerable to agricultural child labour. Other drivers include agricultural dependency, social norms and a lack of higher returns to basic schooling. Almost 60 per cent of girls and boys (aged 5 – 17 years) in hazardous work are found in agriculture. Situations of heightened harm and danger include forced and trafficked child labour for agriculture as well as conflict and emergency situations. Nevertheless age-appropriate tasks can contribute to children’s well-being and development – in particular in rural contexts with a lack of returns to formal education, labour-intensive agricultural livelihoods and social acceptance of child labour...|$|R

Occasionally, the yatiri's ritual helpers will indicate that she must treat the patient in person, or travel to a ritual place in order to give an offering. She will also practice outside her home if the patient requests such. The principal helper in the yatiri's curing ceremony is the riwutu or human skull.

Osteoporosis, another sign of a sedentary lifestyle, is present, but more rarely than on the continent in the same period. Life expectancy has been estimated at twenty years, with maximum ages reaching twenty-eight to thirty. Women tended to live less than men. A sexual division of labour seems to have existed. Women took care of children, harvesting, “light” <b>agricultural</b> <b>duties,</b> “small” livestock, spinning (spindle whorls have been found in women’s tombs), basketry and pottery. Men busied themselves with “masculine” chores: more serious agricultural work, hunting, fishing, and work involving stone, bone, wood and metal. This sexual division of labour led to a first social differentiation: the richest tombs of those found in cists are those belonging to men. Pottery was made without a lathe, judging by the hand-modelled clay balls; pictures were applied to the pottery using brushes, while incisions were made with the fingernails. The vases were then baked in a pit or a grinding wheel—kilns were not used and only low temperatures of 700˚-800˚C were reached. Small-sized metal objects have been found on Naxos. The operation of silver mines on Siphnos may also date to this period.|$|E

Any transgressors were held to account for their actions and any punishments carried out by the prior.* In winter, at the hour of Tierce, or 9 a.m., following on from the meeting of the chapter, the canons would proceed in pairs to the church for the singing of hymns. In summer, there was a longer interval before Tierce so that the abbey duties could be performed. The summer Tierce was a high mass.* High mass was performed at the hour of Sext, or mid-day, in winter.* The community ate at 1 p.m. where only two dishes were served except on certain occasions when an additional sweet dish, called a pittance was provided. If someone was late for the meal then unless he had an adequate excuse, he would have to sit at the most remote of the tables and perhaps with no wine or ale.* After the dinner, some canons rested while others conversed until the hour of Nones, or 3 p.m. when the canons proceeded to church for another service after which, the community were required to wash their hands and wait in the cloister until summoned to the refectory to drink.* At 6 p.m. the canons attended Vespers.* The Compline, the last of the day's worship was held after 7 p.m. followed by a light supper and then bed.* There were no sheets on the dormitory beds and the canons were required to sleep in their habit* in the Autumn, the agricultural canons would leave for the fields {{early in the morning and}} occasionally would not return until after vespers.

5000|$|The Chickasaw {{also held}} similar laws {{mimicking}} {{the culture of}} the American south. [...] After the Revolutionary War the Chickasaw like many other tribes were the targets of assimilation, they were pressed into giving up their trading of deerskins, and communal hunting grounds. The secretary of war Henry Knox under George Washington set two interrelated goals: peaceful land acquisitions and programs focused on assimilating Native Americans in the south. The Chickasaw became familiarized with chattel slavery through the British and French allies, and began to adopt this form of slavery in the early 19th century. The heavy decline of the white-tailed deer population aided in the pressure for the Chickasaw to adopt chattel slavery, the Chickasaw conceded that they could no longer rely primarily on hunting. It is unclear when the Chickasaw began {{to think of themselves as}} potential slave owners of African and African Americans as people they could own as property. The shift toward buying, selling, and exploiting slave labor for material gain accompanied broader, ongoing changes in the ways Chickasaw acquired and valued goods. The Chickasaw excelled in the production of cotton, corn, livestock, and poultry to not only feed their families, but to sell to American families. U.S. Indian agents tracked Chickasaw acquisition of slaves and didn't discourage it, federal officials believed the exploiting of slave labor might enhance Native Americans' understandings of the dynamics of property ownership and commercial gain. The Chickasaw obtained many slaves born in Georgia, Tennessee, or Virginia [...] In 1790 Major John Doughty wrote to Henry Knox, Chickasaws owned a great many horses & some families have Negroes & cattle. Among the Chickasaw who were slaveholders many had European heritage mostly through a white father and a Chickasaw mother. The continued assimilation heavily came through intermarriage as some assimilationists viewed intermarriage as another way to expedite natives' advancement toward civilization, and supported the underlying belief in white superiority. A number of Chickasaw with European heritage rose to prominence because they were related to already politically powerful members of the tribe, not because of racial makeup. Though the Chickasaw did not necessarily prize Euro-American ancestry they did embrace a racial hierarchy that degraded those with African heritage and associated it with enslavement. A further cultural change among the Chickasaw was to have enslaved men work in the fields along with enslaved women, within the Chickasaw tribe <b>agricultural</b> <b>duties</b> belonged to the women. Chickasaw legislators would later condemn sexual relationships between Chickasaw and black people; Chickasaws were punished for publicly taking up with an African American slave with fines, whippings, and ultimately expulsion from the nation. This legislation was also an attempt to keep boundaries between race and citizenship within the tribe. The Chickasaw were also unique among the other civilized tribes as they saw their control over slaves as a particular form of power that could, and should be enacted through violence. The Chickasaw in some cases also practiced the separation of families something not practiced among the other tribes.|$|E
40|$|The {{problems}} of financing the agriculture gain in importance {{in connection with}} its so-called „marketization". The article discusses the condition of agriculture and the {{problems of}} introducing market elements to agricultural production. The author explains misunderstanding connected with the above question. They are the consequence {{of the fact that}} in Poland {{little is known about the}} rules of market economy. The author is in favour of financial protection of agriculture in favour of cheap credits, subventions, tax exemptions and reliefs, and foundations of various kinds for agriculture. Without such protection agriculture would not be able to supply the market with sufficient volume of possibly cheap food. The reform of financing the agriculture should constitute the part of general reform of Polish economy. The author suggests that solutions adopted in the 1050 s by the EEC should be applied in that respect. The means to be used are: guaranteed prices of food produce, export subventions and <b>agricultural</b> <b>duties.</b> The system of financing the EEC agriculture is of interventionistic character. The introduction of fully developed market mechanisms to Polish agriculture is not possible due to the underdevelopment of agricultural industry and service sectors...|$|E
40|$|The article {{discusses}} {{the system of}} financing agriculture in European Communities. The vital instruments of the system are stressed: crop prices, subsidies and agricultural products' duties towards the third countries. Particular {{attention is paid to}} the agricultural prices as these have the crucial impact on the situation of agricultural market. They compose an instrument of interventional shaping of both, crop supplies and the level of farmer incomes. The <b>agricultural</b> <b>duties</b> are also influencing the crop supplies on the Communities' market. Yet, they are of a limited range, what results from the concluded agreements and adopted obligations by the Communities. The supplementary role is played by subsidies in case of crop exports. The agricultural prices in the Communities are higher from these prices at the world market, so in order to sell crops outside of the Communities, they must be subsidized. The common agricultural policy is financed from the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund. Most of the expenditures is intended to finance interventions on the agricultural market. Small amounts are to finance the structural reconstruction of the agriculture. The present system of agriculture financing resulted in an agricultural surplus production which became a financial burden. And the possibilities of increases in the agricultural policy financing are limited. It is aimed to limit expenditures for financing common agricultural policy in a gradual way, but solving that problem would call for the radical reform of that policy.
