5|$|Basing {{himself on}} revised data, Sampson in 1995 {{estimated}} that the layers investigated represented {{a longer period of}} time than the initially assumed 500,000 years: after the deposition of Gilmore's Brachyceratops quarry, 860,000 years would have passed, and after the Einiosaurus beds 640,000 years, until the maximal extent of the Bearpaw transgression. He did not adopt Horner's hypothesis of <b>anagenesis</b> but assumed speciation took place, with the populations splitting. These time intervals were still short enough to indicate that the rate of speciation must have been high, which might have been true of all centrosaurines of the late Campanian.|$|E
5|$|Daspletosaurus {{is usually}} {{considered}} to be closely related to Tyrannosaurus rex, or even a direct ancestor through <b>anagenesis.</b> Gregory Paul reassigned D. torosus to the genus Tyrannosaurus, creating the new combination Tyrannosaurus torosus, but {{this has not been}} generally accepted. Many researchers believe Tarbosaurus and Tyrannosaurus to be sister taxa or even to be the same genus, with Daspletosaurus a more basal relative. On the other hand, Phil Currie and colleagues find Daspletosaurus to be more closely related to Tarbosaurus and other Asian tyrannosaurids like Alioramus than to the North American Tyrannosaurus. The systematics (evolutionary relationships) of Daspletosaurus may become clearer once all the species have been described.|$|E
5|$|The {{process of}} <b>anagenesis</b> was {{confirmed}} by John Wilson and Jack Scannella in 2016, who studied the ontogenetic changes in horned dinosaurs. They compared a small Einiosaurus specimen, MOR4568-8-87-1, with Achelousaurus specimen MOR591. Both proved to be quite similar, with the main differences being a longer face in MOR4568-8-87-1, and a sharper supraorbital horncore in MOR591. They concluded that Achelousaurus was likely the direct descendant of Einiosaurus. The more adult Einiosaurus individuals approached the Achelousaurus morphology. The {{differences between the two}} taxa would have been caused by heterochrony – differential changes in the speed the various traits developed during the lifetime of an individual.|$|E
25|$|Extinction of {{a parent}} species where {{daughter}} species or subspecies are still extant is called pseudoextinction or phyletic extinction. Effectively, the old taxon vanishes, transformed (<b>anagenesis)</b> into a successor, or split into more than one (cladogenesis).|$|E
500|$|The exact {{composition}} of the fauna Achelousaurus was part of is uncertain, as its fossils have not been discovered in direct association with other taxa. Its intermediate anagenetic position suggests that Achelousaurus shared its habitat with forms roughly found in the middle or {{at the end of}} the time range of its formation. As with horned dinosaurs, Horner assumed he had found transitional taxa in other dinosaur groups of the Two Medicine Formation. One of these was a form in between Lambeosaurus and Hypacrosaurus; in 1994 he would name it Hypacrosaurus stebingeri. [...] Today, Hypacrosaurus stebingeri is no longer seen as having evolved through <b>anagenesis</b> because autapomorphies of the species have been identified. Horner saw some pachycephalosaur skulls as indicative for a taxon in between Stegoceras and Pachycephalosaurus; these have not been consistently referred to a new genus. Finally, Horner thought there was a taxon present that was transitional between Daspletosaurus and Tyrannosaurus. In 2017, tyrannosaurid remains from the Two Medicine Formation were named as a new species of Daspletosaurus: Daspletosaurus horneri. The 2017 study considered it plausible that D. horneri was a direct descendant of D. torosus in a process of <b>anagenesis,</b> but rejected the possibility that D. horneri was the ancestor of Tyrannosaurus.|$|E
500|$|Repeated {{formation}} of new species (speciation), change within species (<b>anagenesis),</b> {{and loss of}} species (extinction) throughout the evolutionary history of life on Earth are demonstrated by shared sets of morphological and biochemical traits, including shared DNA sequences. These shared traits are more similar among species that share a more recent common ancestor, {{and can be used}} to reconstruct a biological [...] "tree of life" [...] based on evolutionary relationships (phylogenetics), using both existing species and fossils. The fossil record includes a progression from early biogenic graphite, to microbial mat fossils, to fossilised multicellular organisms. Existing patterns of biodiversity have been shaped both by speciation and by extinction.|$|E
500|$|Within [...] the Ceratopsia, Achelousaurus {{lies within}} the clade Pachyrostra (or [...] "thick-snouts"). It has been {{suggested}} that it was the direct descendant of the similar genus Einiosaurus (which has spikes but no bosses) and the direct ancestor of Pachyrhinosaurus (which has larger bosses). The first two genera would be transitional forms, evolving through <b>anagenesis</b> from Styracosaurus. There has been debate about this theory, with later discoveries showing that Achelousaurus is closely related to Pachyrhinosaurus in the group Pachyrhinosaurini. Achelousaurus is known from the Two Medicine Formation and lived in the island continent of Laramidia. As a ceratopsian, Achelousaurus would have been a herbivore and it appears to have had a high metabolic rate, though lower than that of modern mammals and birds.|$|E
500|$|In 1992, {{the study}} by Horner [...] tried {{to account for the}} fact that within a limited {{geological}} period of time (about half a million years) there had been a quick succession of animal communities in the upper Two Medicine Formation. Normally, this would be interpreted as a series of invasions, with the new animal types replacing the old ones. But Horner noted that the newer forms often had a strong similarity to the previous types. This suggested to him that he had discovered a rare proof of evolution in action: the later fauna was basically the old one but at a more evolved stage. The various types found were not distinct species but transitional forms developed within a process of <b>anagenesis.</b> This conformed to the assumption, prevalent at the time, that a species should last about two to three million years. A further indication, according to Horner, was the failure to identify true autapomorphies – unique traits that prove a taxon is a separate species. The fossils instead showed a gradual change from basal (or ancestral) into more derived characters.|$|E
2500|$|Detailed fossil {{information}} on the distribution and rate of change of new equid species has also revealed that the progression between species was not as smooth and consistent as was once believed. Although some transitions, {{such as that of}} Dinohippus to Equus, were indeed gradual progressions, a number of others, such as that of Epihippus to Mesohippus, were relatively abrupt in geologic time, taking place over only a few million years. Both <b>anagenesis</b> (gradual change in an entire population's gene frequency) and cladogenesis (a population [...] "splitting" [...] into two distinct evolutionary branches) occurred, and many species coexisted with [...] "ancestor" [...] species at various times. The change in equids' traits was also not always a [...] "straight line" [...] from Eohippus to Equus: some traits reversed themselves at various points in the evolution of new equid species, such as size and the presence of facial fossae, and only in retrospect can certain evolutionary trends be recognized.|$|E
2500|$|The {{question}} of evolutionary advancement {{has quite a}} history. Of course, pre-Darwin, it was believed without question that Man stood {{at the head of}} a pyramid (scala naturae). The matter is not so simple with evolution by natural selection; Darwin's own opinion varied from time to time. In the Origin he wrote [...] "And as natural selection works by and for the good of each being, all corporeal and mental endowments will tend to progress towards perfection". This was much too strong; as Sober remarks, there is nothing in the theory of natural selection which demands that selection must produce an increase in complexity or any other measure of advancement. It is merely compatible with the theory that this might happen. Elsewhere Darwin admits that [...] "naturalists have not yet defined to each other's satisfaction what is meant by high and low forms" [...] (p.336); nor have they now – this is one of the problems. Other evolutionary biologists have had similar thoughts to Huxley: G. Ledyard Stebbins and Bernhard Rensch, for example. The term for progressive evolution is <b>anagenesis,</b> though this does not necessarily include the idea of improvement.The objective description of complexity was one of the issues addressed by cybernetics in the 1950s. The idea that advanced machines (including living beings) could exert more control over their environments and operate in a wider range of situations perhaps serves as a basis for making the terms such as 'advanced' amenable to more exact definition. This is a debate that continues today.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Anagenesis</b> {{suggests}} that evolutionary changes {{can occur in}} a species over time to a sufficient degree that later organisms {{could be considered a}} different species, especially in the absence of fossils documenting the gradual transition from one to another. This is in contrast to cladogenesis, in which a population is split into two or more reproductively isolated groups and these groups accumulate sufficient differences to become distinct species. The punctuated equilibria hypothesis {{suggests that}} <b>anagenesis</b> is rare and that the rate of evolution is most rapid immediately after a split which will lead to cladogenesis, but does not completely rule out <b>anagenesis.</b> Distinguishing between <b>anagenesis</b> and cladogenesis is particularly relevant in the fossil record, where limited fossil preservation in time and space makes it difficult to distinguish between <b>anagenesis,</b> cladogenesis where one species replaces the other, or simple geographic immigration/emigration patterns. [...] Recent evolutionary studies are looking at <b>anagenesis</b> and cladogeneis for possible answers in developing the hominin phylogenetic tree to understand morphological diversity and the origins of [...] "Australopithecus anamensis", and this case could possibly show <b>anagenesis</b> in the fossil record.|$|E
50|$|To {{determine}} whether a speciation event is cladogenesis or <b>anagenesis,</b> researchers may use simulation, evidence from fossils, molecular evidence from the DNA of different living species, or modelling. It has however been debated whether the distinction between cladogenesis and <b>anagenesis</b> is necessary at all in evolutionary theory.|$|E
50|$|Cladogenesis is in {{contrast}} to <b>anagenesis,</b> in which an ancestral species gradually accumulates change, and eventually, when enough is accumulated, the species is sufficiently distinct and different enough from its original starting form that it can be labeled as a new form - a new species.

5000|$|From {{a genetic}} perspective, pseudoextinction is the [...] "disappearance of a taxon {{by virtue of}} its being evolved by <b>anagenesis</b> into another taxon." [...] As all species must have an {{ancestor}} of a previous species, much of evolution is believed to occur through pseudoextinction. However, it is difficult to prove that any particular fossil species is pseudoextinct unless genetic information has been preserved. For example, it is sometimes claimed that the extinct Hyracotherium (an ancient horse-like animal commonly known as an eohippus) is pseudoextinct, rather than extinct, because several species of horse, including the zebra and the donkey, are extant today. However, it is not known, and probably cannot be known, whether modern horses actually descend from members of the genus Hyracotherium, or whether they simply share a common ancestor.|$|E
50|$|Pseudoextinction is {{an event}} that occurs much more {{frequently}} under the assumption of a Phyletic gradualism model of evolution, under which speciation is slow, uniform and gradual. The majority of speciation would occur through <b>anagenesis</b> under this model, resulting in a majority of species undergoing Pseudoextinction. However, the model of punctuated equilibrium is more widely accepted, with the proposal that most species remain in stasis, a state of very little evolutionary change, for {{a large proportion of}} the species' lifespan. This would result in increased cases of speciation through cladogenesis and true extinction, with fewer cases of Pseudoextinction. Nearly all species undergo true extinction under the model of punctuated equilibrium. Charles Darwin proposed the idea of stasis in his book, On the Origin of Species. He suggested that species spend the majority of their evolutionary lifespan in the same form, having undergone very little morphological or genetic change.|$|E
50|$|On May 11, 1940 {{she arrived}} in New York, where almost {{immediately}} after, she moved to Massachusetts {{to take a position}} at the Harvard Museum of Comparative Zoology, where she published her second seminal work, The Evolution of the Horse Brain in 1948, three years after becoming a citizen of the U.S. She took leave from Harvard for the 1944-1945 academic year to be a professor of comparative anatomy at Wellesley College, a position she resigned after her hearing deteriorated severely. Edinger's work on fossil horse brains showed that evolution was a branching process, as structures could evolve independently, such as the large forebrain found in advanced mammals. This challenged the prevailing theory of the time, <b>anagenesis,</b> and led to the modern understanding of cladogenesis. In 1963 and 1964, Edinger was elected the president of the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology, reflecting her prominence in the field. Tilly bones, thickened bones on the vertebral columns of some fish species, are named in honor of her.|$|E
5000|$|From a taxonomic perspective, pseudoextinction is [...] "within an {{evolutionary}} lineage, {{the disappearance of}} one taxon caused {{by the appearance of}} the next." [...] The pseudoextinction of a species can be arbitrary, simply resulting from a change in the naming of a species as it evolves from its ancestral form to its descendant form. [...] Taxonomic pseudoextinction {{has to do with the}} disappearance of taxa that are categorized together by taxonomists. As they are just grouped together, their extinction is not reflected through lineage; therefore, unlike evolutionary pseudoextinction, taxonomic pseudoextinction does not alter the evolution of daughter species. From {{an evolutionary}} perspective, pseudoextinction entails the loss of a species as a result of the creation of a new one. As the primordial species evolves into its daughter species, either by <b>anagenesis</b> or cladogenesis, the ancestral species can be subject to extinction. Throughout the process of evolution, a taxon can disappear; in this case, pseudoextinction is considered an evolutionary event.|$|E

5000|$|Another {{concept of}} {{species on the}} tree of life is the {{composite}} species concept. It sees one species as occupying all internodes of the tree that have the same combination of (morphological, ecological, etc.) characters. Here, a species starts with the acquisition of a character and ends when another change is fixed in its lineage. This process - of one lineage turning into what is afterwards seen as another species because of the fixation of a novel character - is often called <b>anagenesis.</b> But we have a similar situation here where a species is considered to end by definition but is not really extinct (it survived, after all, in the form of one descendent species with a different character combination), and so we could also consider it to be pseudoextinction. On the other hand, under the composite species concept a species continues through a lineage split if only one of the two resulting lineages acquires a new character, an event that is sometimes called speciation through [...] "budding". The one that has a new character is now a new species but the other lineage, the one that looks identical to the common ancestor, is considered to be the common ancestor. An example would be a widespread breeding group remaining unchanged while [...] "budding off" [...] a small isolated population that accumulates changes until it cannot interbreed with the others any more.|$|E
