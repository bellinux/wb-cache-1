60|$|The {{lines of}} {{fracture}} which remain between the coadjusted {{pieces of the}} skull, and <b>are</b> <b>faithfully</b> <b>displayed</b> in Schmerling's figure, are readily traceable in the cast. The sutures are also discernible, but the complex disposition of their serrations, shown in the figure, is not obvious in the cast. Though the ridges which give attachment to muscles are not excessively prominent, they are well marked, and taken together with the apparently well developed frontal sinuses, and {{the condition of the}} sutures, leave no doubt on my mind that the skull is that of an adult, if not middle-aged man.|$|E
60|$|The {{gradations}} of {{a wicked}} man in that evil age, from his cradle to his grave, are graphically set before the reader; {{it is all}} drawn from reality, and not from efforts of imagination. Every example {{is a picture of}} some real occurrence, either within the view of the author, or from the narratives of credible witnesses. 'All the things that here I discourse of, have been acted upon the stage of this world, even many times before mine eyes.' Badman is represented as having had the very great advantage of pious parents, and a godly master, but run riot in wickedness from his childhood. Lying and pilfering mark his early days; followed in after life by swearing, cheating, drunkenness, hypocrisy, infidelity and atheism. His conscience became hardened to that awful extent, that he had no bands in his death. The career of wickedness has often been so pictured, as to encourage and cherish vice and profanity--to excite the unregenerate mind 'to ride post by other men's sins.'[1] Not so the life of Badman. The ugly, wretched, miserable consequences that assuredly follow a vicious career, are here displayed in biting words--alarming the conscience, and awfully warning the sinner of his destiny, unless happily he finds that repentance that needeth not to be repented of. No debauchee ever read the life of Badman to gratify or increase his thirst for sin. The tricks which in those days so generally accompanied trading, are unsparingly exposed; becoming bankrupt to make money, a species of robbery, which ought to be punished as felony; double weights, too heavy for buying, and light to sell by, overcharging those who take credit, and the taking advantage of the necessities of others, with the abuse of evil gains in debauchery, and its ensuing miseries, <b>are</b> all <b>faithfully</b> <b>displayed.</b>|$|R

However, no quantification of the gain in resolution of fluorescence images is available.

It mixed the individuals' personality, emotional changes with the political atmosphere, social problems and history development, underscoring the theme.
