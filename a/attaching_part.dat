40|$|A endocardite infecciosa é uma complicação séria, em pacientes portadores de valvopatias, e, algumas vezes, apresenta dificuldades técnicas para sua correção. Uma dessas situações diz respeito a disfunções de próteses colocadas em posição aórtica, ou de valvas naturais aórticas, em que a endocardite leva à descontinuidade entre o ventrículo esquerdo e a aorta, por comprometimento da continuidade mitroaórtica, ou do septo muscular. No Instituto Dante Pazzanese de Cardiologia, operamos 3 pacientes, nos quais havia abscesso em fundo cego, mas provocando grande separação entre o ventrículo esquerdo e a aorta e nos quais a fixação da prótese não poderia ser feita pelas técnicas habituais, nem pela suspensão do folheto {{anterior}} da mitral. Nesses casos, reconstruímos a continuidade entre o ventrículo esquerdo e a aorta, empregando retalho de pericárdio bovino e fixando a prótese, em parte, no anel valvar ainda preservado e, em parte, em um anel criado pelos pontos passados no pericárdio implantado. Um desses pacientes faleceu com 26 dias de pós-operatório, por embolia pulmonar, e com a prótese normal. Os 2 outros receberam alta e estão assintomáticos, com 14 e 4 meses de evolução. O último tem discreto refluxo aórtico, ao ecocardiograma. Infectious endocarditis is {{a serious}} complication in patients with valve diseases and sometimes presents technical difficulties for its treatment. One of those situations concerns prosthesis dysfunctions placed in aortic position or of natural aortic valves, in which endocarditis causes partial descontinuity between the left ventricle and the aorta by the lesion of {{the continuity of the}} mitral-aortic or of the muscular septum. In the Instituto Dante Pazzanese de Cardiologia we operated three patients with closed abscesses but with a great separation between the left ventricle and the aorta in which the fixation of the prosthesis couldn't be done by the usual technique nor by the suspension of the anterior mitral leaflet. We reestablished continuity between the left ventricle and the aorta using a patch of bovine paricardium and <b>attaching</b> <b>part</b> of the prosthesis to the preserved valvar ring and the other part in a ring created by the mattress sutures passed in the implanted pericardium. One patient died with 26 days post-surgery due to pulmonary emboly. The other two were discharged and are without symptoms at 14 and 4 months of evolution. The last one has a slight aortic reflux...|$|E
