5|$|Jervis had the {{reputation}} as a disciplinarian and {{put in place a}} new system that would ensure that the men in the Mediterranean fleet did not mutiny. To begin with the admiral wrote a new set of standing orders. For example, Jervis divided the seamen <b>and</b> <b>marines</b> and berthed the two separately putting the marines between the officers aft and the men forward. Thus he created an effective barrier between officers and potentially unruly crews.|$|E

5|$|The {{events of}} 1811 gave the British {{dominance}} in the Adriatic {{for the remainder of}} the war. British and Greek expeditionary forces steadily captured fortified French islands and British raiding parties devastated the local trade across the region. As a result, French plans against the Ottoman Empire were cancelled, La Grande Armée turning towards Russia. British forces continued operations until the advancing armies of the Sixth Coalition drove the French from the shores of the Adriatic in early 1814, British troops <b>and</b> <b>marines</b> assisting in the capture of several important French cities, including Fiume and Trieste.|$|E

5|$|At 08:45 Rivoli, {{which had}} been {{struggling}} to reach the harbour of Trieste, lost her mizzenmast under fire from both Victorious and Weasel. Nearly at the same moment, two of her 36-pounder long guns exploded, killing or wounding 60 men, greatly disorganising and demoralising the others, and forcing Barré to transfer gunners from the upper gun deck to man his lower battery. Fifteen minutes later, with his ship unmanageable and battered, Commodore Barré surrendered. Rivoli had suffered over 400 killed and wounded from her crew of over 800, who had only assembled {{for the first time}} a few days before and had never sailed their ship in open water. Losses aboard Victorious were also heavy, with one officer and 25 sailors <b>and</b> <b>marines</b> killed and six officers (including Captain Talbot) and 93 men wounded.|$|E
5|$|In July 1877, {{a violent}} {{railroad}} strike began in Martinsburg, West Virginia, sparking riots in other American cities, such as Pittsburgh and Philadelphia. In response, President Rutherford B. Hayes authorized {{the use of}} the military to put down the rioting. During the crisis, Tilley was temporarily transferred to , sailing up the Potomac River to Washington, D.C. Military leaders feared that rioters from Baltimore could travel to Washington to seize or damage vulnerable government targets. The troops defending Washington, including army, navy, <b>and</b> <b>marines,</b> were organized into a battalion of seven companies (Naval Brigade) under the command of Captain Edward Barrett; Tilley was placed in command of Company C. The precautions proved to be unnecessary, as the expected wave of rioters never materialized following the military's suppression of the strikers in Baltimore. Within a short time, the riots in other cities were also quashed.|$|E

Four thousand were specifically earmarked for Anbar, which Bush acknowledged had become both an AQI haven and a center of resistance against AQI. Instead of deploying new units, the Marine Corps chose to extend the deployments of several units already in Anbar: 1st Battalion 6th Marines, 3rd Battalion 4th Marines, and the 15th Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU). The 15th MEU would later be replaced by the 13th MEU as the last surge unit.|$|E

5|$|Marshall {{insisted that}} Anvil {{required}} an experienced commander, and with Patton gone, Clark {{was the only}} one in the theater. Then Devers received a cable that IV Corps headquarters was on its way to the theater. It was commanded by Major General Alexander Patch, who had a distinguished combat record leading the soldiers <b>and</b> <b>marines</b> of XIV Corps in the Guadalcanal Campaign in the Pacific. With Marshall's concurrence, Devers appointed Patch to replace Patton as commander of the Seventh Army and Force 163 on 2 March. While Patch and his staff planned the operation, Devers ensured that the supplies accumulated for it were not dissipated.|$|E
5|$|Mathews and Cave {{also began}} to muster their forces, already {{commanding}} 900 Zanzibari askaris under Lieutenant Arthur Edward Harington Raikes of the Wiltshire Regiment who was seconded to the Zanzibar Army and held the rank of brigadier-general. 150 sailors <b>and</b> <b>marines</b> were landed from the Pearl-class protected cruiser Philomel and the gunboat Thrush, which were anchored in the harbour. The naval contingent, {{under the command of}} Captain O'Callaghan, came ashore within fifteen minutes of being requested to deal with any rioting caused by the general population. A smaller contingent of sailors under Lieutenant Watson of Thrush were put ashore to guard the British consulate, where British citizens were requested to gather for protection. HMS Sparrow, another gunboat, entered the harbour and was anchored opposite the palace next to Thrush.|$|E
5|$|Rather than {{disembark}} {{in nearby}} Mombasa, as originally thought by the evacuees, the ships were ordered back to Oman—a five-day journey.

When the chaplain of Guam asked crew to sign up as guides for the evacuees while aboard the vessel, two hundred signed up within an hour, {{and some of the}} sailors even dressed up as clowns to ease the ordeal for children. At the request of the ambassadors, a formal session with the ships' senior officers was held to express their thanks. On 11 January, the evacuees were offloaded at Muscat, Oman. That afternoon, the American evacuees were flown to Frankfurt, Germany, from where they continued home.|$|E

40|$|The Coastal <b>and</b> <b>Marine</b> Wiki (www. encora. eu/coastalwiki) is an Internet {{encyclopaedia}} providing up-to-date {{high quality}} information for coastal <b>and</b> <b>marine</b> professionals, which is continuously improved, complemented and updated by expert users. Main {{difference between the}} Coastal <b>and</b> <b>Marine</b> Wiki <b>and</b> the online Wikipedia are the procedures to maintain the quality, consistency and comprehensiveness of the information. The issue: taking better advantage of existing knowledgeMuch coastal <b>and</b> <b>marine</b> knowledge existing in research institutes and in practitioners organizations throughout Europe is not fully used and similar studies are carried out more than once. New knowledge dissemination practices are needed for Europe to take better advantage of existing knowledge, especially for use in practice and policy. The Coastal <b>and</b> <b>Marine</b> Wiki conceptThe Coastal <b>and</b> <b>Marine</b> Wikipedia is a professional Internet encyclopaedia that guarantees high quality information. Several procedures are implemented to ensure quality, consistency and comprehensiveness. A major difference with the general Wikipedia is the requirement of an editing authorisation for contributors. Anonymous contributions are precluded; authors and co-authors of articles or article revisions are explicitly acknowledged. The access to the Coastal <b>and</b> <b>Marine</b> Wikipedia is free to any coastal <b>and</b> <b>marine</b> stakeholder, but only experts registered in the Wiki Database are entitled to enter new information. This contact database has been developed in house and is managed at a marine datacentre. Editing authorisations will be granted only to users with a professional background, checked by the editorial team. This team will oversee {{the overall quality of}} the Coastal <b>and</b> <b>Marine</b> Wikipedia. Target user groupsThe primary users of the Coastal <b>and</b> <b>Marine</b> Wikipedia are professionals, usually with higher education, who are either generalists who need to update their knowledge about a broad range of subjects or specialists who need to gain an understanding of other sectors or disciplines in order to work in an integrated manner. Target user groups are policy makers, practitioners, scientists, students at academic institutions and trainees, public stakeholders with particular interest in coastal <b>and</b> <b>marine</b> information <b>and</b> the wider public. The way forward: integrating project-specific informationBesides internal linking, similar Wiki Articles can also be grouped together using different categories. The combination of internal linking and categorisation allows to create a web of linked information that can be organised and accessed in several ways. The Coastal <b>and</b> <b>Marine</b> Wiki is structured following a Coastal <b>and</b> <b>marine</b> ontology that starts from six main categories: the Natural Environment, Issues and Impacts, Human Activities, Locations, Coastal Management and People and Organisations in ICZM. Several Coastal <b>and</b> <b>Marine</b> European research projects like ENCORA Coastal System Assessment) <b>and</b> MarBEF (<b>Marine</b> biodiversity <b>and</b> ecosystem functioning) are contributing their project results to the Coastal <b>and</b> <b>Marine</b> Wiki. In this way the major outcomes of their research will be reflected in the Coastal <b>and</b> <b>Marine</b> Wiki enhancing the knowledge dissemination and integration of their project-specific information.

5|$|The Gloucester was {{the first}} ship to set anchor in the Bay of Guánica. Twenty-eight sailors <b>and</b> <b>Marines,</b> {{under the command of}} Lieutenants H. P. Huse and Wood, {{departed}} from the ship on rafts and landed on the beach. The Marines lowered the Spanish flag from the beach flagpole and replaced it with the American flag. They then proceeded to set up a machine gun nest and placed barbed wire around their perimeter. The first land skirmish in Puerto Rico between the Puerto Rican militia and the American forces occurred when Lt. Méndez López and his men attacked and opened fire on the Americans. During the small battle which followed, the Americans returned fire with their machine gun and the Gloucester began to bombard the Spanish position. Lt. Méndez López and three of his men were wounded and the militia unit was forced to retreat to the town of Yauco.|$|E
5|$|The commissioners of the Customs Board {{found that}} {{they were unable to}} enforce trade {{regulations}} in Boston, so they requested military assistance. Help {{came in the form of}} the HMS Romney, a fifty-gun warship which arrived in Boston Harbor in May 1768. Tensions escalated after the captain of the Romney began to impress local sailors. The situation exploded on June 10, when customs officials seized the Liberty, a sloop owned by John Hancock—a leading critic of the Customs Board—for alleged customs violations. Sailors <b>and</b> <b>marines</b> came ashore from the Romney to tow away the Liberty, and a riot broke out. Things calmed down in the following days, but fearful customs officials packed up their families and fled for protection to the Romney and eventually to Castle William, an island fort in the harbor.|$|E
