25|$|A typical HDD has two {{electric}} motors; {{a spindle}} motor that spins the disks and an <b>actuator</b> (<b>motor)</b> that positions the read/write head assembly across the spinning disks. The disk motor has an external rotor attached to the disks; the stator windings are fixed in place. Opposite the actuator {{at the end of}} the head support arm is the read-write head; thin printed-circuit cables connect the read-write heads to amplifier electronics mounted at the pivot of the actuator. The head support arm is very light, but also stiff; in modern drives, acceleration at the head reaches 550 g.|$|E
2500|$|In 1973, IBM {{introduced}} {{a new type of}} HDD code-named [...] "Winchester". Its primary distinguishing feature was that the disk heads were not withdrawn completely from the stack of disk platters when the drive was powered down. Instead, the heads were allowed to [...] "land" [...] on a special area of the disk surface upon spin-down, [...] "taking off" [...] again when the disk was later powered on. This greatly reduced the cost of the head actuator mechanism, but precluded removing just the disks from the drive as was done with the disk packs of the day. Instead, the first models of [...] "Winchester technology" [...] drives featured a removable disk module, which included both the disk pack and the head assembly, leaving the <b>actuator</b> <b>motor</b> in the drive upon removal. Later [...] "Winchester" [...] drives abandoned the removable media concept and returned to non-removable platters.|$|E
50|$|The {{electric}} motor in the actuator spins {{together with the}} intake camshaft as the engine runs. To maintain camshaft timing, the <b>actuator</b> <b>motor</b> will operate {{at the same speed}} as the camshaft. To advance the camshaft timing, the <b>actuator</b> <b>motor</b> will rotate slightly faster than the camshaft speed. To retard camshaft timing, the <b>actuator</b> <b>motor</b> will rotate slightly slower than camshaft speed. The speed difference between the <b>actuator</b> <b>motor</b> and camshaft timing is used to operate a mechanism that varies the camshaft timing. The benefit of the electric actuation is enhanced response and accuracy at low engine speeds and at lower temperatures as well as a greater total range of adjustment. The combination of these factors allows more precise control, resulting in an improvement of both fuel economy, engine output and emissions performance.|$|E

50|$|Electric power {{steering}} systems use electric motors {{to provide the}} assistance instead of hydraulic systems. As with hydraulic types, power to the <b>actuator</b> (<b>motor,</b> in this case) {{is controlled by the}} rest of the power-steering system.|$|E
50|$|Because of the under-designed cabling {{powering}} the <b>actuator</b> <b>motor,</b> it {{was possible}} for the voltage delivered to the motor to be too low to drive it under high loads. In these cases, the motor would stop turning even if the latches had not rotated over the pins. Since the operators listened for the motors to stop as an indication of their complete rotation, a failure in the drive system during operation would erroneously indicate that the door was properly latched.|$|E

25|$|The {{mechanical}} {{structure of}} a robot must be controlled to perform tasks. The control of a robot involves three distinct phases – perception, processing, and action (robotic paradigms). Sensors give information about the environment or the robot itself (e.g. the position of its joints or its end effector). This information is then processed to be stored or transmitted and to calculate the appropriate signals to the <b>actuators</b> (<b>motors)</b> which move the mechanical.|$|R
5000|$|To prevent this, the DC-10 used a [...] "fail safe" [...] {{latching}} system {{held in place}} by [...] "over top dead center latches", five C-shaped latches mounted on a common torque shaft that are rotated over fixed latching pins ("spools") fixed to the fuselage. Because of their shape, when the latches are in the proper position, pressure on the door does not place torque on the latches that could cause them to open, and actually further seats them on the pins. Normally the latches are opened and closed by a screw jack powered by an electric <b>actuator</b> <b>motor.</b>|$|E

50|$|To ensure this {{rotation}} {{had completed}} and the latches {{were in the}} proper position, the DC-10 cargo door also included a separate locking mechanism. The locks consisting of small pins that were slid horizontally through holes {{on the back of}} the latches, between the latch and the frame of the aircraft. When the pins were in place, they mechanically prevented movement back into the open position, so even the <b>actuator</b> <b>motor</b> could no longer open them. If the latches were not in their correct positions, the pins could not enter the holes, and the operating handle on the outside of the door would remain open and visually indicate that there was a problem. Additionally, the handle moved a metal plug into a vent cut in the outer door panel; if the vent was not plugged the door would not retain pressure, eliminating any force on the door. Lastly, there was an indicator light in the cockpit that would remain on if the door was not correctly latched.|$|E
5000|$|Decomposition {{within the}} {{analysis}} domain where system requirements are modelled, and grouped, around specific, disjoint, subject matters. To {{return to the}} earlier passenger train example, individual semantic models may be created based on door <b>actuators,</b> <b>motor</b> controls, and braking systems. Each grouping is considered, and modelled, independently. The only defined relationship between the groupings are dependencies e.g. a passenger train application may depend on both door actuation and motor control. Braking systems may depend upon motor control.|$|R
