A few of the transcription factors presented themselves more than once, on both the positive and negative strand. These transcription factors include MAX binding protein and Estrogen-related receptor alpha (secondary DNA binding preference) both of which are involved in cell growth.|$|E

50|$|In {{accordance}} with {{the responses to the}} questions in their questionnaire, the 14 countries were clustered into five main groups, which they labeled Nordic-European (Denmark, Germany, Norway, and Sweden), Latin-European (Belgium, France, Italy, and Spain), Anglo-American (England and the United States), Developing (Argentina, Chile, and India), and Japan (by itself). One important thing from this analysis is the various mean standardized scores that the five groups presented with respect to autonomy and self-actualization. For these figures, positive ones mean greater satisfaction of need than for the average manager across all 14 countries, while negative ones mean lesser satisfaction. Their results <b>are</b> <b>presented</b> <b>in</b> <b>Table</b> 1.|$|E
50|$|The sugar {{contents}} of common {{fruits and vegetables}} <b>are</b> <b>presented</b> <b>in</b> <b>Table</b> 1. In general, in foods that contain free fructose, the ratio of fructose to glucose is approximately 1:1; that is, foods with fructose usually contain about {{an equal amount of}} free glucose. A value that is above 1 indicates a higher proportion of fructose to glucose, and below 1 a lower proportion. Some fruits have larger proportions of fructose to glucose compared to others. For example, apples and pears contain {{more than twice as much}} free fructose as glucose, while for apricots the proportion is less than half as much fructose as glucose.|$|E

50|$|The minimum {{pressure}} ratios {{required for}} choked conditions to occur (when some typical industrial gases are flowing) <b>are</b> <b>presented</b> <b>in</b> <b>Table</b> 1. The ratios were obtained using the criterion that choked flow {{occurs when the}} ratio of the absolute upstream pressure to the absolute downstream pressure is equal to or greater than , where k is the specific heat ratio of the gas. The minimum pressure ratio may be understood as the ratio between the upstream pressure and the pressure at the nozzle throat when the gas is traveling at Mach 1; if the upstream pressure is too low compared to the downstream pressure, sonic flow cannot occur at the throat.|$|E
50|$|Whenever {{there are}} {{needs to be}} both explorative and exploitive, {{conflict}} occurs (Bledow, Frese, Anderson, Erez, & Farr, 2009). That's when ambidexterity is necessary. Actually, regulating the conflicting demands of innovation {{is not only a}} challenge for the upper echelon of an organization but also a phenomenon that spans all levels of an organization. Employees as individuals, collectives of employees such as work teams, and the organization as a whole all have to find strategies to deal with conflicting demands in order to succeed in innovation and adaption to changing markets. Some examples of strategies and tactics that could be implemented at all three levels of analysis were also listed out (Bledow et al., 2009). These examples <b>are</b> <b>presented</b> <b>in</b> <b>Table</b> 1, including a separation strategy (in the Separation column) or an integration strategy (in the last two columns).|$|E
