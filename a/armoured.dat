5|$|By July 1945 {{the only}} {{elements}} of the 4th <b>Armoured</b> Brigade in Australia were the unit's headquarters, the 2/5th and 2/6th <b>Armoured</b> Regiments and the 2/1st <b>Armoured</b> Amphibious Squadron. The two regiments were preparing for offensive operations, including a planned but later cancelled invasion of Java, but did not leave Australia.|$|E
5|$|By mid-1944 the 4th <b>Armoured</b> Brigade {{was located}} in Southport, Queensland. As of 1 June, the brigade had a {{strength}} of 4,719 men and {{was scheduled to be}} ready for offensive operations by October that year. During June it also established a training area at Nerang in Queensland, where <b>armoured</b> units could practice operating in tropical conditions. In September 1944 the brigade gained the 2/1st <b>Armoured</b> Brigade Reconnaissance Squadron when the 1st <b>Armoured</b> Brigade Group was disbanded; this unit was reorganised to become the <b>Armoured</b> Squadron (Special Equipment) in January 1945. The 2/6th <b>Armoured</b> Regiment was also reassigned to the 4th <b>Armoured</b> Brigade, but was stationed in the Sydney area. Following the disbandment of the 1st <b>Armoured</b> Brigade Group the 4th <b>Armoured</b> Brigade was the last remaining <b>armoured</b> brigade in the Australian Army.|$|E
5|$|Most of the 4th <b>Armoured</b> Brigade's {{units were}} rapidly disbanded {{following}} the war. The 2/1st <b>Armoured</b> Amphibious Squadron was dissolved in August 1945, and the <b>Armoured</b> Squadron (Special Equipment) followed in October that year. The 4th <b>Armoured</b> Brigade headquarters and 2/5th and 2/6th <b>Armoured</b> Regiments were disbanded in February 1946, and the 2/9th <b>Armoured</b> Regiment {{during the early}} part of the year. Only the 1st <b>Armoured</b> Regiment remained an active unit, and returned to its pre-war designation of the 1st Royal New South Wales Lancers in 1949. Volunteers from the 4th <b>Armoured</b> Brigade manned the 1st <b>Armoured</b> Car Squadron, which was established in 1946 for service with the British Commonwealth Occupation Force in Japan; in 1949 this squadron was expanded to form the 1st <b>Armoured</b> Regiment, which remains an active part of the Australian Army. A memorial to the 4th <b>Armoured</b> Brigade was dedicated at Caboolture in 1993.|$|E
5|$|Reaction forces: A {{modified}} 16 Air Assault Brigade and an <b>armoured</b> division (3rd Division (United Kingdom) {{of three}} <b>armoured</b> infantry brigades (1st, 12th and 20th <b>Armoured</b> Infantry Brigades). In 2020, this division will reorganise and consist of two <b>armoured</b> infantry brigades and two strike brigades.|$|E
5|$|The 4th <b>Armoured</b> Brigade was an <b>armoured</b> {{formation}} of the Australian Army established during the Second World War. It was formed in February 1943 to provide <b>armoured</b> support for infantry units operating in the South West Pacific Area. Its composition varied over time, but usually comprised several <b>armoured</b> regiments equipped with Matilda II or M3 Grant tanks {{as well as some}} support units.|$|E
5|$|The 4th <b>Armoured</b> Brigade was {{established}} in February 1943 {{as part of a}} reorganisation of the Australian Army's <b>armoured</b> units. As there was no longer any threat of Japanese forces invading Australia, the 2nd <b>Armoured</b> Division was disbanded to free up manpower for other purposes. However, it was decided to retain the headquarters of that division's 6th <b>Armoured</b> Brigade to command <b>armoured</b> units that were intended to take part in offensive operations in New Guinea and other locations in the South West Pacific. This specialised formation was designated the 4th <b>Armoured</b> Brigade. The need for <b>armoured</b> support of infantry forces had been demonstrated by the Army's experiences in the New Guinea Campaign during 1942 and early 1943.|$|E
5|$|The 7th <b>Armoured</b> Division and the 49th (West Riding) Infantry Division {{were the}} {{follow-up}} divisions of XXX Corps. The 22nd <b>Armoured</b> Brigade (the <b>armoured</b> {{component of the}} 7th <b>Armoured</b> Division) was scheduled to land during the evening of 6 June, but it was unable to land until the next day. The bulk of the division landed from 9–10 June, with some elements landing later. The 49th Division came ashore on 12 June.|$|E
5|$|The Australian 2nd <b>Armoured</b> Division was {{established}} on 21 February 1942 by redesignating and reorganising the 2nd Motor Division (which was previously the 2nd Cavalry Division). As an <b>armoured</b> division, {{it consisted of}} one <b>armoured</b> brigade of three <b>armoured</b> regiments, and one motor brigade consisting of three motor regiments, supported by an <b>armoured</b> car regiment. It was equipped with M3 Grant medium tanks and M3 Stuart light tanks. The 2nd <b>Armoured</b> Division was disbanded in Queensland on 19 February 1943. Similarly, the Australian 3rd <b>Armoured</b> Division {{was established}} on 15 November 1942 by redesignating the 1st Motor Division (which was previously the 1st Cavalry Division). As an <b>armoured</b> division the 3rd <b>Armoured</b> was equipped with M3 Grant medium tanks and M3 Stuart light tanks. The division's 3rd Motor Brigade was gradually disbanded between March to August 1943 and the 3rd <b>Armoured</b> Division was disbanded in Queensland on 19 October 1943 {{as a result of}} manpower shortages in the Australian Army.|$|E
5|$|The Australian 4th <b>Armoured</b> Brigade {{was formed}} in January 1943 to provide <b>armoured</b> support for Australian Army units {{operating}} in the South West Pacific Area. The brigade was never intended {{to serve as a}} single formation, rather its role was to provide a pool of <b>armoured</b> units from which units and sub-units could be provided to augment infantry forces. The brigade was also responsible for developing doctrine and specialised <b>armoured</b> vehicles for <b>armoured</b> warfare in tropical terrain. In keeping with the brigade's task of providing <b>armoured</b> units to other formations, its <b>armoured</b> regiments were organised into self-supporting regimental groups and the brigade did not possess the reconnaissance, infantry and other supporting elements which were common in World War II-era <b>armoured</b> brigades. Elements of the brigade saw action in the Huon Peninsula campaign of 1943–44 and attached to the Australian 6th Division during the Aitape–Wewak campaign from October 1944 {{until the end of the}} war.|$|E
5|$|The brigade's main role {{throughout}} its existence {{was to provide}} a pool of <b>armoured</b> units and sub-units that could be deployed to augment infantry forces. It was also responsible for developing specialised variants of <b>armoured</b> vehicles. Elements of the 4th <b>Armoured</b> Brigade were detached to support most of the Australian Army's major operations from 1943 {{until the end of the}} war, and from September 1944 it was the Army's only <b>armoured</b> brigade. The formation was disbanded, after the war, in February 1946.|$|E
5|$|The {{drive for}} Trun by Polish and Canadian <b>Armoured</b> Divisions began on 16 August, with {{preliminary}} attacks {{in preparation for}} an assault against Trun and Chambois. On 17 August, both <b>armoured</b> divisions of the Canadian 1st Army advanced. By early afternoon, the Polish 1st <b>Armoured</b> Division had outflanked the 12th SS Panzer Division, enabling several Polish formations to both reach the 4th <b>Armoured</b> Division's objectives and significantly expand the bridgehead northwest of Trun. Stanisław Maczek—the Polish divisional commander—split his forces into three battlegroups each of an <b>armoured</b> regiment and an infantry battalion. One of these struck southwest, cutting off Trun and establishing itself on the high ground dominating {{the town and the}} Dives river valley, allowing for a powerful assault by the Canadian 4th <b>Armoured</b> Division on Trun. The town was liberated on the morning of 18 August.|$|E
5|$|The {{units of}} the 4th <b>Armoured</b> Brigade were {{concentrated}} at Singleton, New South Wales, on 10 March 1943. As of April that year, the brigade formed part of the Land Headquarters Reserve. The 1st Army Tank Battalion was subsequently transferred to Caboolture in southern Queensland and reorganised as a self-supporting battalion group while remaining part of the 4th <b>Armoured</b> Brigade. The unit was redesignated the 1st Tank Battalion on 10 June 1943, and in August that year was shipped to Milne Bay in New Guinea. It subsequently supported the 9th Division during the Landing at Lae and Huon Peninsula campaign. The 1st Tank Battalion returned to Australia in June 1944 and was redesignated again to become the 1st <b>Armoured</b> Regiment. In the meantime the 2/4th <b>Armoured</b> Regiment {{was added to the}} 4th <b>Armoured</b> Brigade in October 1943; this unit had previously formed part of the 3rd <b>Armoured</b> Division and was re-equipped with Matilda II tanks. Also in October 1943, a party from the 4th <b>Armoured</b> Brigade armed with pistols was sent to Grovely Camp near Brisbane to put down a riot by soldiers being held under detention there, but did not need to use force. During March 1944 the 2/6th <b>Armoured</b> Regiment was transferred to the 1st <b>Armoured</b> Brigade Group, and the 2/5th <b>Armoured</b> Regiment was transferred from that formation to the 4th <b>Armoured</b> Brigade.|$|E
5|$|Upon formation, {{the main}} {{units of the}} 4th <b>Armoured</b> Brigade were the 1st Army Tank Battalion, 2/6th <b>Armoured</b> Regiment and 2/9th <b>Armoured</b> Regiment. The 1st Army Tank Battalion was {{equipped}} with Matilda II infantry tanks and had previously formed part of the 3rd Army Tank Brigade. The 2/6th <b>Armoured</b> Regiment had formed part of the 1st <b>Armoured</b> Division until August 1942 when it and its M3 Stuart light tanks were transferred to New Guinea. Elements of the regiment saw combat in the Battle of Buna–Gona, where the Stuart tanks were too lightly <b>armoured</b> to be effective. The 2/9th <b>Armoured</b> Regiment was transferred from the 3rd <b>Armoured</b> Division and equipped with M3 Grant medium tanks. The brigade also had several supporting engineer, medical, signals and services units. As the brigade {{was not intended to}} operate as a single unit, it lacked the <b>armoured</b> reconnaissance, artillery, combat engineer and infantry units which were standard elements of other Australian Army <b>armoured</b> brigades. The 4th <b>Armoured</b> Brigade's commander from its establishment until its disbandment was Brigadier Denzil Macarthur-Onslow.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the first}} day's {{progress}} was slower than expected, Operation Tractable resumed on 15 August; both <b>armoured</b> divisions pushed southeast toward Falaise. The Canadian 2nd and 3rd Infantry Divisions—with {{the support of}} the Canadian 2nd <b>Armoured</b> Brigade—continued their drive south towards the town. After harsh fighting, the 4th <b>Armoured</b> Division captured Soulangy but the gains made were minimal as strong German resistance prevented a breakthrough to Trun. On 16 August, the Canadian 2nd Infantry Division broke into Falaise, encountering minor opposition from Waffen-SS units and scattered pockets of German infantry. Although it would take two more days to clear all resistance in the town, the first major objective of Operation Tractable had been achieved. Simonds began to reorganize the bulk of his <b>armoured</b> forces for a renewed push towards Trun to close the Falaise Pocket.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} Plan Beersheba reorganisation, {{the unit}} {{has become one of}} three <b>Armoured</b> Cavalry Regiments (ACRs) {{assigned}} to the Army's multirole combat brigades in Brisbane, Darwin and Townsville. As an ACR, the unit is equipped with M1A1 tanks, ASLAV light <b>armoured</b> vehicles, and M113 <b>armoured</b> personnel carriers. Under the reforms announced in 2011 and confirmed in the 2013 Defence White Paper, the three Regular Army brigades will be restructured between 2014 and 2017 into three Combat Brigades with a similar structure and capabilities, each consisting of: a Brigade Headquarters, an <b>Armoured</b> Cavalry Regiment, two Standard Infantry Battalions, an Artillery Regiment, a Combat Engineer Regiment, a Combat Service Support Battalion and a Combat Signals Regiment. In 2015 it was reported that the Darwin-based elements of the 1st <b>Armoured</b> Regiment may be transferred to South Australia. In late 2015 one of the 1st <b>Armoured</b> Regiment's two tank squadrons was transferred to the Townsville-based 2nd Cavalry Regiment, with 14 of the tanks relocating.|$|E
5|$|As {{the column}} {{approached}} Villers-Bocage, an Sd.Kfz. 231 <b>armoured</b> car crew observed the British advance and escaped. At 08:30, having covered , the 22nd <b>Armoured</b> Brigade group entered {{the town to}} be greeted by celebrating residents; two German soldiers were spotted leaving at high speed in a Volkswagen Kübelwagen. The two Hussar regiments made contact with German forces {{on either side of}} the 22nd Brigade group route and the 8th Hussars engaged German eight-wheeler <b>armoured</b> cars. The Hussars reported German tanks heading towards Villers-Bocage, but Lieutenant Charles Pearce, of 4th CLY, thought that these were probably self-propelled guns.|$|E

5|$|By 17 August the encirclement was incomplete. The 1st Polish <b>Armoured</b> Division, {{part of the}} First Canadian Army, {{was divided}} into three battlegroups and ordered to make a wide sweep to the {{south-east}} to meet American troops at Chambois. Trun fell to the 4th Canadian <b>Armoured</b> Division on 18 August. Having captured Champeaux on 19 August, the Polish battlegroups converged on Chambois, and with reinforcements from the 4th Canadian <b>Armoured</b> Division, the Poles secured the town and linked up with the US 90th and French 2nd <b>Armoured</b> divisions by evening. The Allies were not yet astride the 7th Army escape route in any great strength, and their positions were attacked by German troops inside the pocket. An <b>armoured</b> column of the 2nd Panzer Division broke through the Canadians in St. Lambert, took half the village and kept a road open for six hours until nightfall. Many Germans escaped, and small parties made their way through to the Dives during the night.|$|E
5|$|David French {{wrote that}} the {{follow-up}} formations landing in Normandy were on average two days behind schedule and that had the 33rd <b>Armoured</b> Brigade, the 49th (West Riding) Infantry Division and the 7th <b>Armoured</b> Division's infantry brigade landed on time, XXX Corps {{might have been able}} to secure Villers-Bocage, before the arrival of substantial German forces. Other historians wrote that substantial British forces remained uncommitted during the battle. Mungo Melvin wrote that although the 7th <b>Armoured</b> Division changed its organisation to a flexible combined arms structure, which was not done by the other British <b>armoured</b> divisions until after Operation Goodwood, neither the 131st Infantry Brigade nor the balanced divisional reserve of an <b>armoured</b> regiment and an infantry battalion were employed well.|$|E
5|$|During 1945 two 4th <b>Armoured</b> Brigade regimental groups saw {{action in}} the Borneo campaign. C Squadron of the 2/9th <b>Armoured</b> Regiment was {{attached}} to the 26th Brigade Group during the invasion of Tarakan in May 1945. The remainder of this regiment subsequently supported the 9th Division during {{the early stages of the}} Battle of North Borneo from 10 June. The 1st <b>Armoured</b> Regiment and <b>Armoured</b> Squadron (Special Equipment) were attached to the 7th Division, and took part in the Battle of Balikpapan from 1 July.|$|E
5|$|From the northeast, the 2nd SS Panzer Division planned {{an assault}} in force against the four {{infantry}} battalions and two <b>armoured</b> regiments of the Polish 1st <b>Armoured</b> Division dug in on Hill 262. The 9th SS Panzer Division would {{attack from the}} north, while simultaneously preventing Canadian units from reinforcing the Polish <b>armoured</b> division. Having managed {{to break out of}} the Falaise Pocket, the 10th SS, 12th SS and 116th Panzer Divisions would then attack Hill262 from the southwest. If this major obstacle could be cleared, German units could initiate a full withdrawal from the Falaise Pocket.|$|E

5|$|General General Bernard Montgomery (commanding {{the ground}} forces in Normandy), wanted {{an attack on}} the eastern flank of the front to capture Falaise, {{intending}} that such a move would precipitate a general German collapse. The First Canadian Army (Lieutenant General Harry Crerar), held this part of the Allied front. It consisted of the British I Corps, responsible for the extreme eastern flank of the Allied lines and II Canadian Corps (Lieutenant General Guy Simonds) south of Caen. The II Canadian Corps, which was to launch Operation Totalize consisted of the 2nd Canadian Infantry Division, 3rd Canadian Infantry Division, 49th (West Riding) Infantry Division, 51st (Highland) Infantry Division, 4th Canadian (<b>Armoured)</b> Division, 1st Polish <b>Armoured</b> Division, 2nd Canadian <b>Armoured</b> Brigade and the British 33rd <b>Armoured</b> Brigade.|$|E
5|$|Graham {{subsequently}} held {{a series}} of regimental and staff appointments, serving in a number of infantry and <b>armoured</b> units. Volunteering for overseas service, he transferred to the Second Australian Imperial Force (2nd AIF) on 26 July 1941. He was subsequently posted to the 2/11th <b>Armoured</b> Car Regiment as the adjutant, followed by attendance at the Staff School. Promoted to captain in September 1942, Graham briefly served on the headquarters of the 1st <b>Armoured</b> Division before being attached to the British Army. Serving with the British 7th <b>Armoured</b> Division, he saw action with them in the North Africa and Italy 1943–44. Coming ashore {{on the first day of}} the Allied landing at Salerno, he was wounded but remained on duty. During this period he gained valuable operational experience in <b>armoured</b> warfare; while his service in North Africa may also have shaped his thinking about the use of tactical minefields which had been used extensively during the mobile infantry and <b>armoured</b> battles of 1941–42.|$|E
5|$|I must {{mention the}} {{magnificent}} fight {{put up by}} 9th <b>Armoured</b> Brigade — 3rd Hussars, Wiltshire Yeomanry, Warwickshire Yeomanry.... If the British armour owed any debt to the infantry of 8th army, the debt was paid on November 2nd by 9th <b>Armoured</b> Brigade in heroism and blood....|$|E
5|$|In April 2013, Djibouti {{presented}} the SNA with 15 <b>armoured</b> military vehicles. The equipment {{was part of}} a larger consignment of 25 military trucks and 25 <b>armoured</b> military vehicles.|$|E
5|$|On 28 May, the ZNG was {{presented}} to the public in a military parade at the Kranjčevićeva Street Stadium to boost morale. The parade featured approximately 800 soldiers, a dozen anti-aircraft systems, <b>armoured</b> cars and several <b>armoured</b> personnel carriers; the Presidential Guards and Alkars also participated.|$|E
5|$|One of the 4th <b>Armoured</b> Brigade's regimental groups {{supported}} Australian Army offensive {{operations in}} New Guinea and Bougainville during 1944 and 1945. The 2/4th <b>Armoured</b> Regiment {{was transferred to}} New Guinea in August 1944, and came {{under the command of}} the First Australian Army. From January 1945 {{until the end of the}} war, C Squadron of the 2/4th <b>Armoured</b> Regiment supported the 6th Division during the Aitape–Wewak campaign. The regimental headquarters and two other squadrons took part in the Bougainville Campaign from October 1944 until the end of the war as part of II Corps.|$|E

5|$|The 4th <b>Armoured</b> Brigade's {{structure}} {{continued to}} change during late 1944 and 1945. The 2/1st <b>Armoured</b> Amphibious Squadron was authorised {{to be raised}} {{as part of the}} brigade in October 1944, but not established until May the next year. This squadron was to operate troop-carrying Landing Vehicles Tracked, but they did not arrive in time for the unit to see action {{before the end of the}} war. In January 1945 the 2/6th <b>Armoured</b> Regiment was transferred to the direct control of Land Headquarters, and moved to Puckapunyal in Victoria the next month. This change proved short-lived though, as the 2/6th <b>Armoured</b> Regiment rejoined the 4th <b>Armoured</b> Brigade at Southport during July; B Squadron of this regiment had been transferred to the brigade in April ahead of the remainder of the regiment moving from Victoria to Queensland.|$|E
5|$|The 9th Battalion was, {{like the}} 8th Battalion, also {{initially}} raised as a training battalion, and {{was assigned to}} the 224th Independent Infantry Brigade (Home). The 9th Battalion was transferred to the Royal <b>Armoured</b> Corps in December 1941, becoming 154th Regiment Royal <b>Armoured</b> Corps, retaining their North Staffords cap badge on the black beret of the Royal <b>Armoured</b> Corps, as did all other infantry units converted in this way. The regiment was assigned to 36th Army Tank Brigade alongside RAC regiments converted from infantry battalions. However, the regiment was disbanded in July 1943.|$|E
5|$|The Australian 1st <b>Armoured</b> Division {{was raised}} in 1941 {{as part of the}} 2nd AIF. While the {{division}} was originally to be deployed to North Africa in late 1941, it was retained in Australia following the outbreak of the Pacific War. Universal Carriers were issued to the <b>armoured</b> regiments in 1941 and early 1942 for training purposes and to provide the Army with a minimal <b>armoured</b> capability as an emergency measure until the arrival of tanks ordered from the United States. The 1st <b>Armoured</b> Division's <b>armoured</b> regiments subsequently began re-equipping with M3 Grant medium tanks and M3 Stuart light tanks in April and May 1942. Following this, the division was concentrated in northern New South Wales where it completed its training with a series of large exercises around Narrabri. The 2/6th <b>Armoured</b> Regiment was the first unit of the division to see action, deploying to Port Moresby and Milne Bay in New Guinea in September. In December two of its squadrons were subsequently shipped to Buna on the north coast of Papua to help break the deadlock in the Battle of Buna–Gona and although the lightly <b>armoured</b> M3 Stuart tanks proved to be unsuited to jungle warfare and suffered heavy casualties, the regiment {{played an important role in}} the eventual Australian victory at Buna during fighting between December 1942 and January 1943. Meanwhile, in January 1943 the remainder of the division was moved to the area between Perth and Geraldton, Western Australia, where it formed part of III Corps, which was tasked to counter the perceived threat of a Japanese invasion of Western Australia. The 1st <b>Armoured</b> Division formed a key element of Australia's mainland defences, but after that threat passed it was disbanded in Western Australia in September 1943.|$|E
5|$|The Canadian II Corps—commanded by Lieutenant-General Guy Simonds—initially {{assigned}} two infantry {{divisions and}} one <b>armoured</b> brigade to {{the assault on}} the German positions around Verrières. The Canadian 3rd Infantry Division—having taken heavy casualties during the first six weeks of the Normandy campaign—was given a supporting role. The onus of the task therefore fell on the fresh, though relatively inexperienced, Canadian 2nd Infantry Division, along with the tanks of the Canadian 2nd <b>Armoured</b> Brigade. Additional forces were later made available in the shape of three divisions from the British I Corps: the 51st (Highland) Division, the Guards <b>Armoured</b> Division, and the British 7th <b>Armoured</b> Division. Despite having significantly more combat experience than their Canadian counterparts, the British units played a minor part in the battle.|$|E
5|$|The JNA {{evacuated}} 21 T-55 tanks, nine T-34s, an <b>armoured</b> recovery vehicle, an <b>armoured</b> vehicle-launched bridge, ten APCs (including an <b>armoured</b> command vehicle) and 50 vehicles carrying military equipment. Elements of the 110th Infantry Brigade {{entered the}} Logorište barracks {{on the morning}} of 6 November, removing some of the military hardware in the barracks before pulling out at 1:00p.m. after being informed that the JNA was planning an artillery attack. Captured equipment continued to be removed from the barracks until 13 November.|$|E
5|$|The first Tetrarchs were {{delivered}} to the Army in November 1940, and were initially deployed with the 1st <b>Armoured</b> Division (which was being refitted after losing {{the majority of its}} previous tanks during the Battle of France) and the newly formed 6th <b>Armoured</b> Division. However, the faults discovered with the Tetrarch cooling system precluded them from being integrated into units that were sent to the Middle East to participate in the North African Campaign. Shortly after, all light tanks were discarded from the establishments of British <b>armoured</b> divisions as not suitable for further service.|$|E
5|$|The main {{role of the}} 4th <b>Armoured</b> Brigade was {{to provide}} {{detachments}} of tanks to support infantry units. As it was not practical or necessary to deploy large <b>armoured</b> units in the jungle terrain common across the South West Pacific, the brigade was organised into several self-supporting regimental groups. These regimental groups could in turn provide sub-units with the necessary logistics support to form the <b>armoured</b> component of other units during combat operations. This held in practice; during combat deployments regiments from the 4th <b>Armoured</b> Brigade were attached to infantry divisions or brigades, and their squadrons and troops generally operated independently as part of combined arms forces.|$|E
