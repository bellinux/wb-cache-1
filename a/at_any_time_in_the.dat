5|$|The player's primary {{weapon is}} a ghostly {{version of the}} Soul Reaver sword, {{referred}} to as the wraith-blade. The wraith-blade is symbiotically bound to Raziel, and can be summoned or dismissed <b>at</b> <b>any</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> material world, but, if overused, the sword can turn against Raziel, siphoning his health. Other weapons include claws, swords and spears. As the game progresses, the player encounters magical forges which imbue the wraith-blade with elemental powers associated with darkness, light, air, and fire. These enhancements have various uses, but are only available in the material realm. If Raziel shifts, he loses his active elemental imbuement, and must re-forge the blade at locations scattered throughout the game world.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the game, the player has to allocate a number of American troops in order to establish a beachhead on one of the six beaches of the island. However, many of the beaches are scattered with land mines and may provide an initial disadvantage to the assault. Throughout the game, the player may call in air strikes and other assaults, however they are only available after the American forces are attacked or if the enemy retreats to an inaccessible location. <b>At</b> <b>any</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> game, the player is also able to request troop reinforcements from the fleet. Furthermore, Japanese air forces may sink American battleships throughout the game, although the player will {{be given the opportunity to}} shoot them down. In addition, a Japanese submarine will sink American gunboats at random intervals, and cannot be destroyed in any way. There is no save function in the game.|$|E

Recent research suggests that the Earth's oceans are a potentially important new source of Arctic methane.|$|E

By 1905, production reached 1 million bottles. As the business grew, Törley built a huge mansion above the factory.

25|$|Ukrainian {{linguist}} Stepan Smal-Stotsky went even further, {{denying the}} existence of a common Old East Slavic language <b>at</b> <b>any</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> past. Similar points of view were shared by Yevhen Tymchenko, Vsevolod Hantsov, Olena Kurylo, Ivan Ohienko and others. According to this theory, the dialects of East Slavic tribes evolved gradually from the common Proto-Slavic language without any intermediate stages during the 6th through 9th centuries. The Ukrainian language was formed by convergence of tribal dialects, mostly due to an intensive migration of the population within the territory of today's Ukraine in later historical periods. This point of view was also supported by George Shevelov's phonological studies.|$|E

25|$|The {{collection}} of the museum is mostly that of Franz Mayer himself, collected {{over the course of}} fifty years and is the largest {{collection of}} decorative arts in Latin America. The museum has 9,500 pieces of art, 1,400 pieces of ceramics and 10,000 books, with only 28% able to be shown <b>at</b> <b>any</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> museum proper. The collection includes silverwork, ceramics, furniture, textiles, fine arts and decorations made of pre Hispanic style feather work, lacquer, ivory, shell, glass and enamel, mostly of pieces from the 16th to the 19th centuries with a variety of places of origin, materials and styles. Most of the pieces are those used in everyday life, but finely handcrafted. A number of pieces come from Europe and Asia, but Mayer acquired a very large quantity of pieces from Mexico City, Puebla and Guanajuato. The collection of textiles {{is one of the most}} important in the country for its variety with about 260 pieces from the 15th to the 20th centuries. Many of his items are those which were susceptible to disappearing as they are everyday items often not considered worth preserving.|$|E
25|$|A study {{published}} in the journal Science in September 2009 determined that temperatures in the Arctic are higher presently than they have been <b>at</b> <b>any</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> previous 2,000 years. Samples from ice cores, tree rings and lake sediments from 23 sites were used by the team, led by Darrell Kaufman of Northern Arizona University, to provide snapshots of the changing climate. Geologists were able to track the summer Arctic temperatures {{as far back as the}} time of the Romans by studying natural signals in the landscape. The results highlighted that for around 1,900 years temperatures steadily dropped, caused by precession of earth's orbit that caused the planet to be slightly farther away from the sun during summer in the Northern Hemisphere. These orbital changes led to a cold period known as the little ice age during the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries. However, during the last 100 years temperatures have been rising, despite the fact that the continued changes in earth's orbit would have driven further cooling. The largest rises have occurred since 1950, with four of the five warmest decades in the last 2,000 years occurring between 1950 and 2000. The last decade was the warmest in the record.|$|E

25|$|Players are {{currently}} {{inducted into the}} Hall of Fame through election by either the Baseball Writers' Association of America (or BBWAA), or the Veterans Committee, which now consists of four subcommittees, each of which considers and votes for candidates from a separate era of baseball. Five years after retirement, any player with 10 years of major league experience who passes a screening committee (which removes from consideration players of clearly lesser qualification) is eligible to be elected by BBWAA members with 10 years' membership or more who also have been actively covering MLB <b>at</b> <b>any</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 10 years preceding the election (the latter requirement was added for the 2016 election). From a final ballot typically including 25–40 candidates, each writer may vote for up to 10 players; until the late 1950s, voters were advised to cast votes for the maximum 10 candidates. Any player named on 75% or more of all ballots cast is elected. A player who is named on fewer than 5% of ballots is dropped from future elections. In some instances, the screening committee had restored their names to later ballots, but in the mid-1990s, dropped players were made permanently ineligible for Hall of Fame consideration, even by the Veterans Committee. A 2001 change in the election procedures restored the eligibility of these dropped players; while their names will not appear on future BBWAA ballots, they may be considered by the Veterans Committee. Players receiving 5% {{or more of the}} votes but fewer than 75% are reconsidered annually until a maximum of ten years of eligibility (lowered from fifteen years for the 2015 election).|$|E
25|$|The cast {{were often}} {{contracted}} from anywhere {{between five and}} six years to the show, but starting with the 1999–2000 season, new hires were tied to a rewritten contract that allowed NBC to take a cast member in at least their second year {{and put them in}} an NBC sitcom. Cast are given the option of rejecting the first two sitcom offers but must accept the third offer, with the sitcom contract length dictated by NBC and potentially lasting up to six years. The move drew criticism from talent agents and managers who believed that a cast member could be locked into a contract with NBC for twelve years; six on SNL and then six on a sitcom. The contract also optioned the cast member for three feature films produced by SNL Films, a company owned by NBC, Paramount Pictures, and Michaels. The new contracts were reportedly developed after many previously unknown cast, such as Myers and Sandler, gained fame on SNL only to leave and make money for other studios. In a 2010 interview, Wiig was reported to be contracted to SNL for a total of seven years. The contracts also contain a network option which allows NBC to remove a cast member <b>at</b> <b>any</b> <b>time.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> first season of the show, cast were paid $750 per episode, rising to $2,000 by season two, and $4,000 by season four. By the late 1990s, new cast members received a salary between $5,000 and $5,500 per episode, increasing to $6,000 in the second year and up to $12,500 for a cast member in their fifth year. Performers could earn an additional $1,500 per episode for writing a sketch which made it to air. In 2001, Ferrell became the highest paid cast member, being paid $350,000 per season (approximately $17,500 per episode). In 2014, Sasheer Zamata was added as a cast member in mid-season after criticism of the show's lack of an African-American woman.|$|E
