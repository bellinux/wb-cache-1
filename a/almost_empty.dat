5|$|The Kaurava's {{learn about}} Kichaka's death {{due to a}} woman married to five Gandharvas in mysterious circumstances. They doubt that the Pandavas are hidden in Matsya and launch {{an attack on the}} kingdom's cattle. With all the {{soldiers}} engaged in war with Kauravas' allies, Virata's palace is <b>almost</b> <b>empty.</b> When Kauravas attack the remaining cattle, Uttara Kumara swears to fight against them. However, after watching their military troops, Uttara Kumara loses his confidence. Brihannala, who is his charioteer, volunteers to fight if Uttara Kumara handles the chariot, to which Uttara Kumara agrees.|$|E
5|$|The {{court was}} shown {{extensive}} video footage of Tomlinson and Harwood on the day. Harwood was seen trying to arrest {{a man who}} had daubed graffiti on a police van, then joining a line of officers who were clearing Royal Exchange Passage. Harwood pushed a man who blew a vuvuzela at him, then appeared to push a BBC cameraman who was filming the arrest of another man. The footage showed Harwood push a third man out of the way, and shortly after this (the passageway now <b>almost</b> <b>empty)</b> the officers reached Tomlinson.|$|E
5|$|This highly {{hypothetical}} {{picture of}} the flux tube exchange was partly confirmed by the Galileo spacecraft, which detected regions of sharply reduced plasma density and increased field strength in the inner magnetosphere. These voids may correspond to the <b>almost</b> <b>empty</b> flux tubes arriving from the outer magnetosphere. In the middle magnetosphere, Galileo detected so-called injection events, which occur when hot plasma from the outer magnetosphere impacts the magnetodisk, leading to increased flux of energetic particles and a strengthened magnetic field. No mechanism is yet known to explain the transport of cold plasma outward.|$|E

60|$|I was {{nevertheless}} able, after <b>almost</b> <b>emptying</b> my purse, {{to replace}} {{at least the}} vest and jacket at a rival establishment, whose proprietor promised to forward the borrowed articles to their legitimate owners. I afterwards discovered that they never received them.|$|R
50|$|Leo {{decided to}} sign a {{separate}} peace with Gaiseric. Anthemius lost his allies and, with the imperial treasury <b>almost</b> <b>emptied</b> by the failed operation, renounced taking Africa back. Instead he concentrated on the second problem of his Empire, keeping under his control the Western provinces targeted by Visigothic expansion.|$|R
5|$|After {{the move}} to Exeter, Leofric worked to {{increase}} the endowment of the diocese, and especially the cathedral library, which he found <b>almost</b> <b>empty</b> upon his arrival. He later claimed that there were only five books owned by the cathedral chapter when he became bishop. He still remained on good terms with the king, for he was present at Edward's Christmas court in 1065 that saw the consecration of Edward's Westminster Abbey church at Westminster. No evidence survives that Leofric was employed by the king in any diplomatic missions, nor does Leofric appear to have attended any papal councils or synods. He was {{a supporter of the}} cult of Leo IX, who was proclaimed a saint after Leo's death.|$|E
5|$|During the Mexican oil boom, Air France flew Concorde twice weekly to Mexico City's Benito Juárez International Airport via Washington, DC, or New York City, from September 1978 to November 1982. The {{worldwide}} {{economic crisis}} {{during that period}} resulted in this route's cancellation; the last flights were <b>almost</b> <b>empty.</b> The routing between Washington or New York and Mexico City included a deceleration, from Mach 2.02 to Mach 0.95, to cross Florida subsonically and avoid creating a sonic boom over the state; Concorde then re-accelerated back to high speed while crossing the Gulf of Mexico. On 1 April 1989, on an around-the-world luxury tour charter, British Airways implemented changes to this routing that allowed G-BOAF to maintain Mach 2.02 by passing around Florida {{to the east and}} south. Periodically Concorde visited the region on similar chartered flights to Mexico City and Acapulco.|$|E
5|$|On 22 April Wiggin and his brigade headquarters, {{with one}} {{squadron}} and one troop of Worcestershire Hussars, {{had arrived at}} Bir el Hamisah from Katia. Wiggin moved there {{in response to an}} intelligence report that an Ottoman force was at Bir el Mageibra some distance to the south and, with the agreement of his commander H. A. Lawrence, he prepared to launch a surprise attack. At dawn on 23 April, Wiggin found and destroyed a large but <b>almost</b> <b>empty</b> camp at Bir el Mageibra, capturing six prisoners. He was back at Bir el Hamisah by 09:00, having covered a distance of , when he heard news of Ottoman attacks.|$|E

The throat had been severed down to the spine, and the abdomen <b>almost</b> <b>emptied</b> of its organs. The heart was missing.|$|R
60|$|The {{next day}} was Sunday, and Anne felt almost as if deserting her cause, when going to the English service in Whitehall Chapel Royal, now <b>almost</b> <b>emptied</b> except of the Princess's suite, {{and some of these}} had the bad taste and profanity to cough and chatter all through the special prayer drawn up by the Archbishop for the King's safety.|$|R
25|$|Mangammal had {{frequent}} troubles {{from the}} time of her regency with Maratha King Shaji of Thanjavur. In the following year the Madurai forces under Dalavoy Narasappiah crushingly defeated the Tanjore Marathas near their capital, when they suddenly stormed into their capital. The disheartened King Shaji of Tanjore was only glad enough to buy off the invading army with an enormous bribe, after <b>almost</b> <b>emptying</b> his treasury.|$|R
5|$|The Holden Volt is {{available}} to purchase through 49 select Holden dealerships throughout metropolitan and rural Australia, with 18 in Victoria, 11 in New South Wales, 9 in Queensland, 7 in Western Australia and 4 in South Australia. A total of 80 Holden Volts were sold during 2012, and 101 units in 2013. A total of 246 Holden Volts had been sold in the country by mid April 2015, with the stock {{of the first generation}} <b>almost</b> <b>empty.</b> General Motors announced that it will not build the second generation Volt in right-hand-drive configuration, so the Volt will be discontinued in the country when the remaining stock is sold out.|$|E
5|$|Kane {{opened at}} the RKO Palace Theatre on Broadway in New York on May 1, 1941, in Chicago on May 6, and in Los Angeles on May 8. Welles said that at the Chicago premiere that he {{attended}} the theater was <b>almost</b> <b>empty.</b> It did well in cities and larger towns but fared poorly in more remote areas. RKO still had problems getting exhibitors to show the film. For example, one chain controlling more than 500 theaters got Welles's film {{as part of a}} package but refused to play it, reportedly out of fear of Hearst. Hearst's disruption of the film's release damaged its box office performance and, as a result, it lost $160,000 during its initial run. The film earned $23,878 during its first week in New York. By the ninth week it only made $7,279. Overall it lost money in New York, Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Washington, D.C., but made a profit in Seattle.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 28 August, Lambert {{received}} a message from Hamelin, promising to release all the prisoners under conditions of parole within one month if Île de la Passe and Iphigenia were both surrendered without resistance. The message also threatened that if Lambert refused, the French would attack and overwhelm the badly outnumbered British force. Recognising that food supplies were low, reinforcements had not arrived and that his ammunition stores were <b>almost</b> <b>empty,</b> Lambert agreed to the terms. Lambert later received a message from Decaen proposing similar terms and notified the French governor that he had surrendered to Hamelin. Decaen was furious that Hamelin had agreed terms without consulting him, but eventually agreed to accept {{the terms of the}} surrender as well. The wounded were treated by French doctors at Grand Port and later repatriated, although the remainder of the prisoners were placed in a cramped and unpleasant prison at Port Napoleon from which, despite the terms of the surrender, they were not released until British forces captured the island in December.|$|E

The Indians had retired enriched with British plunder, and the chief part of the French regulars were gone upon expeditions northward. My good Florac had left me upon his service, consigning me to the care of an invalided sergeant. Monsieur de Contrecoeur had accompanied one of these expeditions, leaving an old lieutenant, Museau by name, in command at Duquesne.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the {{population}} distribution in the Republic of Croatia {{as a part of}} general demographic and socio-economic conditions and processes. The present-day population distribution in Croatia {{has turned out to be}} unfavourable. The whole regions are underpopulated and exposed to depopulation, the rural areas are <b>almost</b> <b>emptied,</b> the population is condensed around the small number of central places, etc. Besides, the trends are unfavourable: many densely populated and over-populated regions record a further increase of the population number, while the underpopulated ones are exposed to a constant depopulation...|$|R
5|$|Overall {{damage was}} {{generally}} minor. There were {{no reports of}} wind damage, although tropical storm-force winds affected the northern coast of Tamaulipas. A newspaper in Mexico reported up to 24inches (600mm) of precipitation across much of Tamaulipas and Nuevo Leon; this figure is in dispute, however, as the rainfall database maintained by Mexico's National Weather Service shows the maximum amount to lie under 20inches (508mm). The heavy rainfall from the storm filled nearly half the reservoirs in Nuevo Leon and Tamaulipas, which were <b>almost</b> <b>empty</b> due to drought conditions in the region. As a result, dozens in southern Nuevo Leon were forced to evacuation their homes. Rains from Gabrielle flooded streets and destroyed bridges and highways in northern Mexico. No storm surge recordings were taken in Mexico, although it is estimated by the National Hurricane Center that a surge of a few feet took place {{to the north of}} the track. Six fatalities were reported in Mexico as a result of Gabrielle.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after winning}} their 14th League title, Louis Kilcoyne {{announced}} that the Kilcoynes were selling Glenmalure Park, which they had recently purchased from the Jesuits. The team played the entire 1987–88 season in an <b>almost</b> <b>empty</b> Tolka Park {{as a result of}} a boycott called for by the Shamrock Rovers Supporters Club and KRAM (Keep Rovers At Milltown), which was observed by the vast majority of Hoops fans. Following the completion of the boycott season in Tolka, the Kilcoynes sold the football club to Dublin businessman John McNamara, who put forward a controversial proposal to move in with Bohemians at Dalymount Park. KRAM congregated to vote on whether to lift the boycott and on the proposal to move to Dalymount. Both motions were passed and the club spent the next two seasons at the Phibsboro venue, with an unrecognisable side playing in front of small attendances.|$|E
25|$|In {{the year}} 1576 a great {{mortality}} and pestilence {{that lasted for}} more than a year overcame the Indians. It was so big that it ruined and destroyed almost the entire land. The place we know as New Spain was left <b>almost</b> <b>empty.</b>|$|E
50|$|Immediately {{prior to}} the {{construction}} of the Berlin Wall, the numbers of immigrants entering the camp rose sharply: from 19,198 in June 1961, to 30,444 in July (about 1,000 a day), and then more than 1,200 a day in the first days of August. On August 12 it reached 2,400. On 13 August 1961, East German authorities closed the buffer zone between the two parts of Berlin and started building the Berlin Wall. Overnight, the number of refugees in the camp decreased sharply and later on the camp <b>almost</b> <b>emptied.</b>|$|R
5000|$|She {{kept up the}} {{bombardment}} until the cliffside gunners found her range at 9:45. The gunboat then dropped 100 yards farther downstream and resumed her shelling. By 11:00, Galena and Monitor had <b>almost</b> <b>emptied</b> their magazines, prompting Rodgers to break off the action and then to retire downstream. Aroostook—which had [...] "[...] [...] received {{a shot at the}} waterline under the after part of the starboard forechains ..." [...] and another [...] "[...] [...] through the starboard bow one foot above the sheet hawse hole"—suffered no personnel casualties during the engagement.|$|R
5000|$|The U.S. {{eventually}} ceded {{the territory}} to Mexico with the Boundary Treaty of 1970, {{and it was}} formally annexed {{by the state of}} Tamaulipas. The handover took place in 1977. After one local resident filed a lawsuit to prevent the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service from deporting him, the US courts ruled that all residents born in the city prior to 1972 could retain their US citizenship. [...] The ruling <b>almost</b> <b>emptied</b> the city of residents as they were now able to move to other areas of the United States as full citizens.|$|R
25|$|For {{about two}} weeks, Captain John C. Phillips was the senior {{officer at the}} camp and in command. Between May 12, 1863 and August 18, 1863, Captain J. S. Putnam {{was in charge of}} the <b>almost</b> <b>empty</b> camp, which then held only about fifty prisoners.|$|E
25|$|Though Poland-Lithuania was at {{that time}} the largest {{and one of the most}} populous states of Europe, Sobieski became a king of a country devastated by almost half a century of {{constant}} war. The treasury was <b>almost</b> <b>empty</b> and the court had little to offer the powerful magnates, who often allied themselves with foreign courts rather than the state.|$|E
25|$|The {{north is}} a large sandy area known today as the Campine (Dutch Kempen). It was not highly fertile, or heavily populated. It {{contains}} marshy areas, and the water flows partly to the Scheldt {{in the west and}} partly towards the Meuse. In Latin this area {{came to be known as}} Toxandria, but in late Roman time it became <b>almost</b> <b>empty</b> of Romanized inhabitants, and was settled by incoming Franks.|$|E
50|$|Republican-Socialist Party (Parti républicain-socialiste) {{created by}} {{independent}} socialists who had refused {{the unification of}} the socialist movement in 1905 under the SFIO, which was, like the Independent Radicals, <b>almost</b> an <b>empty</b> shell by then.|$|R

The village may be an old village [...] But in 1800s the village was <b>almost</b> <b>emptied</b> because of an epidemic. The Ottoman government settled people from the eastern parts of the empire. The present name Doğlu may be a corrupt form of Doğulu (“of east”). The main agricultural products of the village are olive and citrus.|$|R
50|$|The next hotel {{he works}} at {{is a grand}} estate, but it is <b>almost</b> always <b>empty.</b> In one satirical scene, however, the hotel {{receives}} {{a visit from the}} President of the country (presumed to be Tomáš Masaryk) and his French lover.|$|R
25|$|Certain {{offerings of}} the Vieux-Colombier {{received}} critical and popular acclaim. To no one's surprise The Brothers Karamazov, with Dullin, who finally arrived in New York in March 1918, {{in the role}} of Smerdiakov and later in his well-received role as Harpagon, the miser, counted among the successes. Nuit des rois also burnished the company's reputation. But some plays such as Octave Mirbeau's Les Mauvais Bergers ("The Evil Shepherds") ended with an <b>almost</b> <b>empty</b> house as the audience stalked to the exits during the play before the final curtain.|$|E
25|$|The Nazi {{fascination with}} Wagner was largely {{inspired}} by Hitler, sometimes {{to the dismay}} of other high-ranking Nazi officials, including Joseph Goebbels. In 1933, for instance, Hitler ordered that each Nuremberg Rally open with a performance of the overture from Rienzi. He also issued one thousand free tickets for an annual Bayreuth performance of Meistersinger to Nazi functionaries. When Hitler entered the theater, however, he discovered that it was <b>almost</b> <b>empty.</b> The following year, those functionaries were ordered to attend, but they could be seen dozing off during the performance, so that in 1935, Hitler conceded and released the tickets to the public.|$|E
25|$|In the {{asteroid}} belt within 3.5 AU from the Sun, the major mean-motion resonances with Jupiter are locations of gaps in {{the asteroid}} distribution, the Kirkwood gaps (most notably at the 4:1, 3:1, 5:2, 7:3 and 2:1 resonances). Asteroids have been ejected from these <b>almost</b> <b>empty</b> lanes by repeated perturbations. However, there are still populations of asteroids temporarily present in or near these resonances. For example, asteroids of the Alinda family are in or close to the 3:1 resonance, with their orbital eccentricity steadily increased by interactions with Jupiter until they eventually have a close encounter with an inner planet that ejects them from the resonance.|$|E
50|$|Following World War I {{the town}} {{became part of}} Lithuania and was renamed to its current name. During World War II the town was {{occupied}} by Germany. On 1 September 1941, somewhere between 5,000 and 8,000 Jews from Marijampolė, Kalvarija and elsewhere - along with people from other backgrounds - were murdered. Their bodies were placed in mass graves near the Sesupe River. Most of the murderers were Lithuanian. In {{the effect of the}} war the town was heavily damaged and <b>almost</b> <b>emptied.</b> After the war it was rebuilt and repopulated with immigrants from other parts of Lithuania. Currently in Marijampolė, roughly 95% of its inhabitants are Lithuanians, with 4% being Russians and less than 1% being Poles.|$|R
50|$|He {{was born}} at Ottensen in Holstein-Pinneberg (today Hamburg) on 8 March 1607; {{the son of the}} Lutheran pastor of that place, Caspar Rist. He {{received}} his early training at the Gelehrtenschule des Johanneums in Hamburg and the Gymnasium Illustre in Bremen; he then studied theology at the University of Rinteln. Under the influence of Josua Stegman there, his interest in hymn writing began. On leaving Rinteln, he tutored the sons of a Hamburg merchant, accompanying them to the University of Rostock, where he himself studied Hebrew, mathematics, and medicine. During his time at Rostock, the Thirty Years War <b>almost</b> <b>emptied</b> the University, and Rist himself lay there for several weeks, suffering from pestilence.|$|R
50|$|A large dowry is {{sometimes}} expected, and given, in Afghanistan; some houses are <b>almost</b> <b>emptied</b> {{so that the}} daughter may make a grand show at the wedding. Items included in a dowry depend on {{the resources of the}} bride's family and the demands made by the groom's family. Embroidery is traditionally included in a dowry, as is land, money, jewelry such as necklaces and pazab, shoes, shawls, carpets, bedding, furniture, crockery, mirrors, clocks and such items. The dowry is transferred from bride's family house to the groom's family house one day before the wedding day in a ritual ceremony with band and a procession, which typically adopts the longest route in the residential area for the Afghan community to see the dowry being given by the bride's family.|$|R
