25|$|Each year, {{more than}} 2.5 {{million people in}} the United States develop {{pressure}} ulcers. In <b>acute</b> <b>care</b> <b>settings</b> in the United States, the incidence of bedsores is 0.4% to 38%; within long-term care it is 2.2% to 23.9%, and in home care, it is 0% to 17%. Similarly, there is wide variation in prevalence: 10% to 18% in acute care, 2.3% to 28% in long-term care, and 0% to 29% in home care. There is a much higher rate of bedsores in intensive care units because of immunocompromised individuals, with 8% to 40% of those in the ICU developing bedsores. However, pressure ulcer prevalence is highly dependent on the methodology used to collect the data. Using the European Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel (EPUAP) methodology there are similar figures for pressure ulcers in acutely sick people in the hospital. There are differences across countries, but using this methodology pressure ulcer prevalence in Europe was consistently high, from 8.3% (Italy) to 22.9% (Sweden). A recent study in Jordan also showed a figure in this range. Some research shows differences in pressure-ulcer detection among white and black residents in nursing homes.|$|E

At present, there are no evidence-based recommendations for physical exercise in the <b>acute</b> dementia <b>care</b> <b>settings.</b> Hence, this systematic review investigates the effects of short-term exercise trials on BPSD. Trials with a length up to three months investigating the effects of structured exercise interventions on BPSD in <b>acute</b> dementia <b>care</b> <b>settings</b> were included. Five trials, referring to a total of N =  206 patients, met the inclusion criteria. The trial durations ranged from three up to twelve weeks.

40|$|This {{report is}} an {{exploration}} of end-of-life care for older people in acute and longstay settings in Ireland. The focus is on end-of-life care {{for all types of}} illnesses and conditions in <b>acute</b> and residential <b>care</b> <b>settings</b> because this is where the majority of older people die in Ireland. End-of-life care is broader in scope than palliative care and allows a longer lead time to death. It takes into account the potential uncertainty surrounding dying and death, including the possibility that some people follow complex and non-linear pathways to death. End-of-life care is, therefore, intimately bound-up with quality of life issues for older people living in <b>acute</b> and long-stay <b>care</b> <b>settings.</b> Loss and decline are common and recurring features of life in long-stay <b>care</b> <b>settings,</b> from admission, through on-going care, to death.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Interprofessional care ensures {{high quality}} healthcare. Effective interprofessional {{collaboration}} {{is required to}} enable interprofessional care, although within the <b>acute</b> <b>care</b> hospital setting interprofessional collaboration is considered suboptimal. The integration of nurse practitioner roles into the <b>acute</b> and long-term <b>care</b> <b>settings</b> is influencing enhanced care. What remains unknown is how the nurse practitioner role enacts interprofessional collaboration or enables interprofessional care to promote high quality care. The study aim was to understand how nurse practitioners employed in <b>acute</b> and long-term <b>care</b> <b>settings</b> enable interprofessional collaboration and care. METHOD: Nurse practitioner interactions with other healthcare professionals were observed throughout the work day. These interactions were explored {{within the context of}} "knotworking" to create an understanding of their social practices and processes supporting interprofessional collaboration. Healthcare professionals who worked with nurse practitioners were invited to share their perceptions of valued role attributes and impacts. RESULTS: Twenty-four nurse practitioners employed at six hospitals participated. 384 hours of observation provided 1, 284 observed interactions for analysis. Two types of observed interactions are comparable to knotworking. Rapid interactions resemble the traditional knotworking described in earlier studies, while brief interactions are a new form of knotworking with enhanced qualities that more consistently result in interprofessional care. Nurse practitioners were the most common initiators of brief interactions. CONCLUSIONS: Brief interactions reveal new qualities of knotworking with more consistent interprofessional care results. A general process used by nurse practitioners, where they practice a combination of both traditional (rapid) knotworking and brief knotworking to enable interprofessional <b>care</b> within <b>acute</b> and long-term <b>care</b> <b>settings,</b> is revealed...|$|R

40|$|This {{study is}} {{designed}} to explore the usefulness of guided selfreflection in facilitating nursing students' learning in <b>acute</b> psychiatric <b>care</b> <b>settings.</b> During their one-month clinical placement, {{in a variety of}} <b>acute</b> in-patient psychiatric <b>care</b> <b>settings,</b> 28 first year mental health nursing students kept journals describing important daily events, reflecting on their attitudes towards the events and indicating what they could learn from them. The clinical practice coordinator (researcher) and two clinical mentors (psychiatric nurse specialists) supervised 5 - 6 students in groups, guided the development of their self-reflection, examined the content of their reflective journals and provided weekly feedback. All the students using guided reflection were able to apply a wide range of learned theories and the skills of mental health nursing to their self-reflection activities and clinical care. Major themes in the reflective journals coincided with the development of the students’ selfreflection skills, including nurse-patient relationships, meaningful selfreflection processes and identification with patients. These issues, together with other areas of learning, were discussed and clarified with the students.
