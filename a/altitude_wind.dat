500|$|Historically, {{the ancient}} Sinhalese of Anuradhapura {{and in other}} cities around Sri Lanka used the monsoon winds to power {{furnaces}} as early as 300 BCE. The furnaces were constructed {{on the path of}} the monsoon winds to exploit the wind power, to bring the temperatures inside up to [...] An early historical reference to a rudimentary windmill was used to power an organ in the first century CE. The first practical windmills were later built in Sistan, Afghanistan, from the 7th century CE. These were vertical-axle windmills, which had long vertical driveshafts with rectangle shaped blades. Made of six to twelve sails covered in reed matting or cloth material, these windmills were used to grind corn and draw up water, and were used in the gristmilling and sugarcane industries. Horizontal-axle windmills were later used extensively in Northwestern Europe to grind flour beginning in the 1180s, and many Dutch windmills still exist. High <b>altitude</b> <b>wind</b> power is the focus of over 30 companies worldwide using tethered technology rather than ground-hugging compressive-towers. Oil is being saved by using wind for powering cargo ships by use of the mechanical energy converted from the wind's kinetic energy using very large kites.|$|E

50|$|At high <b>altitudes</b> <b>wind</b> {{is often}} strong and {{continuous}} over long periods. Consequently, wind in alpine regions imposes severe mechanical stress on plants. As a consequence, alpine species require strong root systems to maintain anchorage in the soil. High winds {{also contribute to}} soil erosion by moving fine soil particles. These particles blown over the vegetation by high winds can effectively prune erect vegetation. Intense glazing winds occur in winter and late spring.|$|R

50|$|Although sudden stratospheric warmings {{are mainly}} forced by {{planetary}} scale waves which propagate {{up from the}} lower atmosphere, {{there is also a}} subsequent return effect of sudden stratospheric warmings on surface weather. Following a sudden stratospheric warming, the high <b>altitude</b> <b>winds</b> reverse to flow eastward instead of their usual westward. The eastward winds progress down through the atmosphere and weaken the jet stream, often giving easterly winds near the surface and resulting in dramatic reductions in temperature in Europe.|$|R
50|$|High {{aspect ratio}} wings, which usually have low wing loading and are {{far longer than}} they are wide, are used for slower flight. This may {{take the form of}} almost {{hovering}} (as used by kestrels, terns and nightjars) or in soaring and gliding flight, particularly the dynamic soaring used by seabirds, which takes advantage of wind speed variation at different <b>altitudes</b> (<b>wind</b> shear) above ocean waves to provide lift. Low speed flight is also important for birds that plunge-dive for fish.|$|R

While at Langley, he directed important aerodynamic research which led to increased high-speed performance of most of the combat aircraft of World War II. In 1944 he joined the High-Speed panel and advocated the supersonic wind tunnel, completed in 1949. Following World War II, Silverstein was responsible for the conception, design, and construction of America's first supersonic propulsion wind tunnels. The investigations in these facilities greatly contributed to the development of supersonic aircraft. He also directed research in propulsion aerodynamics in the <b>Altitude</b> <b>Wind</b> Tunnel that led to significant improvements in both reciprocating and early turbojet aircraft engines. He also pioneered research on large-scale ramjet engines.|$|E
