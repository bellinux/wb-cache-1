5|$|An old {{qualitative}} {{test for}} the presence of the <b>alkene</b> functional group is that alkenes turn brown aqueous bromine solutions colourless, forming a bromohydrin with some of the dibromoalkane also produced.

5000|$|This {{procedure}} generates epoxides {{with high}} enantiomeric excesses from trans-disubstituted <b>alkenes</b> and trisubstituted <b>alkenes.</b> Cis-disubstituted <b>alkenes</b> and styrenes are asymmetrically epoxidized using a similar catalyst. Generation of (R,R) epoxides from corresponding <b>alkenes</b> increases in stereoselectivity with increased steric bulk of substituent R groups (especially in trans-olefins).|$|R

5|$|The silicon-directed Nazarov {{cyclization}} {{reaction was}} subsequently {{employed in the}} synthesis of the natural product Silphinene, shown below. The cyclization takes place before elimination of the benzyl alcohol moiety, so that the resulting stereochemistry of the newly formed ring arises from approach of the silyl <b>alkene</b> anti to the ether.|$|E
5|$|Fatty acids {{are made}} by fatty acid synthases that {{polymerize}} and then reduce acetyl-CoA units. The acyl chains in the fatty acids are extended by a cycle of reactions that add the acyl group, reduce it to an alcohol, dehydrate it to an <b>alkene</b> group and then reduce it again to an alkane group. The enzymes of fatty acid biosynthesis are divided into two groups: in animals and fungi, all these fatty acid synthase reactions are carried out by a single multifunctional type I protein, while in plant plastids and bacteria separate type II enzymes perform each step in the pathway.|$|E
2500|$|The {{physical}} properties of <b>alkenes</b> and alkanes are similar. [...] They are colourless, nonpolar, combustable, and almost odorless. [...] The physical state depends on molecular mass: like the corresponding saturated hydrocarbons, the simplest <b>alkenes,</b> ethene, propene, and butene are gases at room temperature.

5|$|Ruthenium forms a {{wide range}} {{compounds}} with carbon-ruthenium bonds. Grubbs' catalyst is used for <b>alkene</b> metathesis. Ruthenocene is analogous to ferrocene structurally, but exhibits distinctive redox properties. The colorless liquid ruthenium pentacarbonyl converts {{in the absence of}} CO pressure to the dark red solid triruthenium dodecacarbonyl. Ruthenium trichloride reacts with carbon monoxide to give many derivatives including RuHCl(CO)(PPh3)3 and Ru(CO)2(PPh3)3 (Roper's complex). Heating solutions of ruthenium trichloride in alcohols with triphenylphosphine gives tris(triphenylphosphine)ruthenium dichloride (RuCl2(PPh3)3), which converts to the hydride complex chlorohydridotris(triphenylphosphine)ruthenium(II) (RuHCl(PPh3)3).|$|E
5|$|In animals, {{when there}} is an {{oversupply}} of dietary carbohydrate, the excess carbohydrate is converted to triglycerides. This involves the synthesis of fatty acids from acetyl-CoA and the esterification of fatty acids in the production of triglycerides, a process called lipogenesis. Fatty acids are made by fatty acid synthases that polymerize and then reduce acetyl-CoA units. The acyl chains in the fatty acids are extended by a cycle of reactions that add the acetyl group, reduce it to an alcohol, dehydrate it to an <b>alkene</b> group and then reduce it again to an alkane group. The enzymes of fatty acid biosynthesis are divided into two groups, in animals and fungi all these fatty acid synthase reactions are carried out by a single multifunctional protein, while in plant plastids and bacteria separate enzymes perform each step in the pathway. The fatty acids may be subsequently converted to triglycerides that are packaged in lipoproteins and secreted from the liver.|$|E
5|$|White silver nitrate, AgNO3, is a {{versatile}} precursor {{to many other}} silver compounds, especially the halides, and is much less sensitive to light. It was once called lunar caustic because silver was called luna by the ancient alchemists, who believed that silver {{was associated with the}} moon. It is often used for gravimetric analysis, exploiting the insolubility of the silver halides which it is a common precursor to. Silver nitrate is used in many ways in organic synthesis, e.g. for deprotection and oxidations. Ag+ binds alkenes reversibly, and silver nitrate has been used to separate mixtures of alkenes by selective absorption. The resulting adduct can be decomposed with ammonia to release the free <b>alkene.</b>|$|E
40|$|Several {{types of}} chiral hetero- and carbocyclic {{compounds}} have been synthesized {{by using the}} asymmetric hydrogenation of cyclic <b>alkenes.</b> N,P-Ligated iridium catalysts reduced six-membered cyclic <b>alkenes</b> with various substituents and heterofunctionality in good to excellent enantioselectivity, whereas the reduction of five-membered cyclic <b>alkenes</b> was generally less selective, giving modest enantiomeric excesses. The stereoselectivity of the hydrogenation depended more strongly on the substrate structure for the five- rather than the six-membered cyclic <b>alkenes.</b> The major enantiomer formed in the reduction of six-membered <b>alkenes</b> could be predicted from a selectivity model and isomeric <b>alkenes</b> had complementary enantioselectivity, giving opposite optical isomers upon hydrogenation.

50|$|The {{initial stage}} of the {{halogenation}} of aromatic compounds {{differs from that of}} the halogenation of <b>alkenes</b> in that <b>alkenes</b> do not require a catalyst to enhance the electrophilicity of the halogen. The formation of the arenium ion results in the temporary loss of aromaticity, which has a higher activation energy compared to halonium ion formation in <b>alkenes.</b> In other words, <b>alkenes</b> are more reactive and do not need to have the Br-Br or Cl-Cl bond weakened.|$|R

5000|$|Diimide {{reductions}} {{result in}} the syn addition of dihydrogen to <b>alkenes</b> and alkynes. This observation {{has led to the}} proposal that the mechanism involves concerted hydrogen transfer from cis-diimide to the substrate. The cis isomer is the less stable of the two; however, acid catalysis may speed up equilibration of the trans and cis isomers.(2)Diimide is typically generated either through the oxidation of hydrazine or the decarboxylation of potassium azodicarboxylate. Kinetic experiments suggest that regardless of its method of generation, the formation of diimide is rate-limiting. The transition state of the hydrogen transfer step is likely early; however, high stereoselectivity has been obtained in many reductions of chiral alkenes.(3)The order of reactivity of unsaturated substrates is: alkynes, allenes > terminal or strained <b>alkenes</b> > substituted <b>alkenes.</b> Trans <b>alkenes</b> react more rapidly than cis <b>alkenes</b> in general. The reactivity difference between alkynes and <b>alkenes</b> is usually not great enough to isolate intermediate alkenes; however, <b>alkenes</b> can be isolated from allene reductions.Diimide reduces symmetrical double bonds i.e.,C=C.
