Amendments to the school law, the Scottish legal system, and the railway laws were passed. Disraeli sent the successful expedition against Tewodros II of Ethiopia under Sir Robert Napier.|$|E

5|$|A trio {{of small}} Early Classic temples (Temples 29 to 31) stand upon a common {{platform}} {{at the east}} end of the terrace, facing west. It is likely that the platform was purposely built to support the three temples that were built more-or-less simultaneously. Neither the platform nor the temples have been investigated; it is therefore possible that <b>an</b> <b>early</b> <b>version</b> of the central temple (Temple 30) was built first, then decommissioned with the platform being built to cover the early version, followed by {{the construction of a new}} version plus the two additional flanking temples.|$|E
5|$|According to one theory, Shakespeare's {{main source}} is an earlier play—now lost—known {{today as the}} Ur-Hamlet. Possibly written by Thomas Kyd or even William Shakespeare, the Ur-Hamlet would have existed by 1589, and would have {{incorporated}} a ghost. Shakespeare's company, the Chamberlain's Men, may have purchased that play and performed a version for some time, which Shakespeare reworked. However, since no copy of the Ur-Hamlet has survived, {{it is impossible to}} compare its language and style with the known works of any of its putative authors. Consequently, there is no direct evidence that Kyd wrote it, nor any evidence that the play was not <b>an</b> <b>early</b> <b>version</b> of Hamlet by Shakespeare himself. This latter idea—placing Hamlet far earlier than the generally accepted date, with a much longer period of development—has attracted some support.|$|E
5|$|<b>An</b> <b>early</b> <b>version</b> of {{the modern}} {{self-help}} book, the 18th-century British conduct book drew on many literary traditions, such as advice manuals and religious narratives. There was {{an explosion in the}} number of conduct books published {{during the second half of}} the 18th century, and Wollstonecraft took advantage of this burgeoning market when she published Thoughts. However, the book was only moderately successful: it was favourably reviewed, but only by one journal and it was reprinted only once. Although it was excerpted in popular contemporary magazines, it was not republished until the rise of feminist literary criticism in the 1970s.|$|E

5|$|Before Lauper {{covered the}} song, the band The Cars {{produced}} <b>an</b> <b>early</b> <b>version</b> {{of it that}} was not released. Shear's version was originally a folk rock song, but Lauper instead {{turned it into a}} pop ballad for her album, with a heavy emphasis on a synthesizer. According to Lauper, she wanted it to be just like Shear's version, with a bit more of an acoustic sound. However, she changed her mind, saying that she wanted to sing it like herself. Unlike her other singles from the album, this one did not have a music video released with it.|$|E
5|$|His {{first major}} work, the poem London, {{contains}} <b>an</b> <b>early</b> <b>version</b> of Johnson's ethics and morality system. Within the poem, he combined {{attacks on the}} politics of Walpole and the British government with the immoral actions of the common Londoner to form a general satire of 18th-century London society. Johnson compares London to the Roman Empire in its decline and blames moral and political corruption for its fall. Although Johnson did not start his literary criticism career until later, London is an example of what Johnson thought poetry should be: it is youthful and joyous, but it also relies on simple language and easy to understand imagery.|$|E
5|$|The {{final version}} of Youth and Pleasure was painted between 1830 and 1832, but Etty had been contemplating a {{painting}} on the theme since 1818–19. In 1822 he had exhibited <b>an</b> <b>early</b> <b>version</b> at the British Institution titled A Sketch from One of Gray's Odes (Youth on the Prow); in this version the group of figures on the prow is reversed, and the swimmers around the boat are absent. Another rough version of the painting also survives, similar to the 1832 version but again with the figures on the prow reversed. This version was exhibited at a retrospective of Etty's work at the Society of Arts in 1849; it is dated 1848 but {{this is likely to}} be a misprint of 1828, making it a preliminary study for the 1832 painting.|$|E

5|$|The {{origins of}} the lemuriform toothcomb and the clade it characterizes have been the center of {{considerable}} debate {{for more than a}} century. In 1920, British palaeoanthropologist Wilfrid Le Gros Clark proposed that the toothcomb found in treeshrews (which he believed were primates) was <b>an</b> <b>early</b> <b>version</b> of the dental structure found in lemuriforms. Because he viewed the fossil lorisoids from the Miocene as not having fully developed the modern lemuriform toothcomb, he implied that lemurs and lorisoids had evolved the trait independently. This view was later overturned, and the monophyletic relationship between lemurs and lorisoids is now accepted.|$|E
5|$|Youth on the Prow, and Pleasure at the Helm (also {{known as}} Fair Laughs the Morn and Youth and Pleasure) is an oil {{painting}} on canvas by English artist William Etty, first exhibited in 1832 and currently in Tate Britain. Etty {{had been planning}} the painting since 1818–19, and <b>an</b> <b>early</b> <b>version</b> was exhibited in 1822. The piece {{was inspired by a}} metaphor in Thomas Gray's poem The Bard in which the apparently bright start to the notorious misrule of Richard II of England was compared to a gilded ship whose occupants are unaware of an approaching storm. Etty chose to illustrate Gray's lines literally, depicting a golden boat filled with and surrounded by nude and near-nude figures.|$|E
5|$|Basing {{the plot}} {{partially}} {{on a story}} told to her by a stranger, Kim began <b>an</b> <b>early</b> <b>version</b> of 12 Days as a sophomore in college to help herself cope {{with the end of}} a relationship. After moving on emotionally with her break-up, she stopped developing the comic and later left South Korea to attend the School of Visual Arts in Manhattan, New York, United States, from which she graduated with a Bachelor of Fine Arts in cartooning. Following her successful pitch of 12 Days to manga publisher Tokyopop, she resumed work on it in early 2005 and finished in the middle of August 2006. 12 Days focuses on Jackie Yuen, who decides to drink the ashes of her former lover for twelve days in beverages as a way to cope with her grief over her death.|$|E
