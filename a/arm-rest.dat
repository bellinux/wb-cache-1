500|$|At around 16:15, Linge ordered SS-Untersturmführer Heinz Krüger and SS-Oberscharführer Werner Schwiedel {{to roll up}} the rug in Hitler's {{study to}} burn it. Schwiedel later stated that upon {{entering}} the study, he saw {{a pool of blood}} the size of a [...] "large dinner plate" [...] by the <b>arm-rest</b> of the sofa. Noticing a spent cartridge case, he bent down and picked it up from where it lay on the rug about 1mm from a 7.65 pistol. The two men removed the blood-stained rug, carried it up the stairs and outside to the Chancellery garden. There the rug was placed on the ground and burned.|$|E
60|$|It was {{the first}} time since {{childhood}} that Conroy had prayed. They laughed hysterically when a curve threw them against an <b>arm-rest.</b>|$|E
6000|$|She {{drove her}} thumb {{deep into the}} <b>arm-rest.</b> 'And now,' she whined to him, 'now that we've stirred each other up this way, mightn't we have just one?' ...|$|E
50|$|There {{were two}} variants, those {{built for the}} Midland, Scottish, and Eastern / North Eastern regions had six seats per compartment, with fold-up <b>arm-rests</b> which folded into the seat-back, while those built for the Southern and Western regions, with their heavy {{commuter}} loadings into London, had eight seats in each compartment, and no <b>arm-rests.</b> Seating was of the interior sprung bench type. Over time, some SKs and BSKs were re-allocated from other regions to the Western, who tended to try to stitch the <b>arm-rests</b> in the up position.|$|R
50|$|Adirondack chairs (also {{known as}} Muskoka chairs) are {{comfortable}} with their high backs, their contoured seats and their wide <b>arm-rests.</b> The <b>arm-rests</b> provide ample room for food and beverages for comfortable meals while reclining with no table required, making them popular with outdoor cafés and bistros as they offer seating and a small place for food {{without the need for}} a table.|$|R
50|$|There {{were two}} variants; those built to Diagram 126 for the Midland, Scottish, and Eastern / North Eastern regions had six seats per {{compartment}} in 2nd class, with fold-up <b>arm-rests</b> which folded into the seat-back, while those built to Diagram 128 for the Southern and Western regions, with their heavy commuter loadings into London, had eight seats in each 2nd class compartment, and no <b>arm-rests.</b> 2nd class seating {{was of the}} interior sprung bench type.|$|R
6000|$|... 'What {{difference}} would that make?' He unbuttoned his ulster with a jerk. 'You're a sane woman. Can't {{you see the}} wicked--wicked--wicked' (dust flew from the padded <b>arm-rest</b> as he struck it) unfairness of it? What have I done?' ...|$|E
60|$|The tremor of hope did not {{comfort her}} long. Her mood was critical, {{and she saw}} that in this, her one accomplishment, she was, as in {{everything}} else, an amateur. She could not compete against professionals. She closed her eyes, and had a momentary vision of those professionals, keen of face, leathern of finger, rattling out myriads of words at a dizzy speed. And, at that, all her courage suddenly broke; she drooped forlornly, and, hiding her face on the cushioned <b>arm-rest,</b> she began to cry.|$|E
6000|$|... 'That's naught {{to do with}} it. I {{think all}} the world of him. I'm a foolish wench'--her speech wandered as she settled herself cosily, one elbow on the <b>arm-rest.</b> 'We'd been engaged--I couldn't help that--and he worships the ground I tread on. But it's no use. I'm not responsible, you see. His two sisters are against it, though I've the money. They're right, but they think it's the dri-ink,' she drawled. 'They're Methody--the Skinners. You see, their {{grandfather}} that started the Patton Mills, he died o' the dri-ink.' ...|$|E
50|$|In later years, as {{vehicles}} were re-allocated between regions, some had their <b>arm-rests</b> fixed in the folded position {{while on the}} Western region.|$|R
25|$|Planetaria {{occasionally}} include controls such as buttons or joysticks in the <b>arm-rests</b> {{of seats}} to allow audience feedback that influences {{the show in}} real time.|$|R
50|$|A {{standard}} corridor {{coach with}} a guard's brake compartment is designated BSK. The Mark 1 BSKs had 4 compartments, built as two variants {{with or without}} <b>arm-rests</b> depending on region, as with the SKs.|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{why do you}} object?" [...] she asked, {{looking at}} me steadily, and beating with her little hand the <b>arm-rest</b> by her side. [...] "If your {{behavior}} is not impertinence, pray what is it? We meet at the Opera. You look. It {{is not enough for}} you that you look once, but you look twice, three times. You come out on to the pavement to hear the address which my uncle gives the chauffeur. We go to a restaurant for supper, where only the few are admitted. You are content to be brought by a waiter, but you are there! You travel to England by the same train,--you walk up and down past my compartment. You presume to address me upon the boat. You give a fee to the guard that he should put us in your carriage. Yet you object to the term 'impertinence'!" ...|$|E
60|$|Gobind the one-eyed told me this. He was a {{holy man}} who lived on {{an island in the}} middle of a river and fed the fishes with little bread pellets twice a day. In flood-time, when swollen corpses {{stranded}} themselves at the foot of the island, Gobind would cause them to be piously burned, for the sake of the honour of mankind, and having regard to his own account with God hereafter. But when two-thirds of the island was torn away in a spate, Gobind came across the river to Dhunni Bhagat's Chubara, he and his brass drinking vessel with the well-cord round the neck, his short <b>arm-rest</b> crutch studded with brass nails, his roll of bedding, his big pipe, his umbrella, and his tall sugar-loaf hat with the nodding peacock feathers in it. He wrapped himself up in his patched quilt made of every colour and material in the world, sat down in a sunny corner of the very quiet Chubara, and, resting his arm on his short-handled crutch, waited for death. The people brought him food and little clumps of marigold flowers, and he gave his blessing in return. He was nearly blind, and his face was seamed and lined and wrinkled beyond belief, for he had lived in his time which was before the English came within five hundred miles of Dhunni Bhagat's Chubara.|$|E
50|$|The bike {{incorporated}} a gaming platform, an LCD screen, a gamepad and an <b>arm-rest</b> with a patented system that simultaneously raised {{the screen and}} <b>arm-rest</b> when the seat was raised ensuring correct posture in a single movement. The system was covered by two other patents: one for a motivational system to convert cycle speed into a virtual energy; a second covered the gearboxed resistance unit that dispensed {{with the need for}} a large, separate flywheel.|$|E
50|$|These long-distance trains {{operate with}} non-motorized {{passenger}} cars that have individual compartments. Second class compartments have two couches opposite each other, each couch offering 4 places. In first-class cars each compartment offers 2 x 3 places and foldable <b>arm-rests</b> divides the places. In 1st class each passenger has a reserved assigned seat.|$|R
50|$|The 77 oak stalls {{furnishing}} {{the choir}} {{date to the}} early 14th-century and are {{the oldest and most}} important in Brittany. The carvings are on the <b>arm-rests</b> of each stall rather than as at Tréguier and Saint Pol where they decorate the miséricords. At Dol, the wood-carvers have carved what is almost a complete cross section of the medieval population of the town.|$|R
5000|$|... 1999 (February) The test {{production}} of the new Daewoo-FSO Polonez Kombi 1.6 GSi MPI. (April) The mass {{production of}} the Daewoo-FSO Polonez Kombi in passenger (final drive ratio 3,9) and van version (final drive ratio 4,3) with 1.6 engine (MPI). The new steering wheel (From Daewoo Nubira), <b>arm-rests</b> introduced. Start of sale planned for June 1999. (May) Official premiere of the Daewoo-FSO Polonez Kombi 1.6 GSi MPI on the Poznan Motor Show.|$|R
50|$|This Hindu hermitage or Math {{dedicated}} to Shri Swami Samartha {{was established by}} Shri Gopalbuva Kelkar alias Shri Preetinand Swamikumar Maharaj who authored a book about miracles done by Shri Swami Samartha. The Math showcases Swami Samarthas silver slippers and wooden dand(meditation <b>arm-rest).</b>|$|E
50|$|A rear <b>arm-rest</b> will {{typically}} fold away {{between the}} back seats, {{to allow for}} the central (third) seating place to be used. In some designs where occupant safety is emphasised, including some Volvo models, the armrest doubles as a child seat, complete with specially adjustable seatbelt. As with the front, it is not unusual to have armrests built into rear doors, or the side of the car if there is no rear door.|$|E
50|$|While a {{mobility}} scooter eliminates {{much of the}} manual strength problems of an unpowered wheelchair, its tiller steering mechanism still requires upright posture, shoulder and hand strength, and some upper-body mobility and strength. The <b>arm-rest</b> mounted controller typical of powerchair designs may be more suitable for many users. Scooters also have fewer options for body support, such as head or leg rests. They are rarely designed for ease of patient transfer from seat to bed.|$|E
50|$|The S type {{carriage}} sitting cars {{all used}} a fairly straightforward arrangement, with eight compartments and a side corridor accessed by a vestibule {{at either end}} and inter-carriage diaphragms. First class carriages, later AS class, seated six passengers across two black leather benches in each compartment for a total capacity of 48, and each bench had two retractable <b>arm-rests</b> fitted. The second class carriages, later BS, used green leather seating with a single central retractable armrest, and were rated at 64 passengers with eight per compartment.|$|R
50|$|The Seated Woman of Çatalhöyük (also Çatal Höyük) is a baked-clay, nude female form, seated between feline-headed <b>arm-rests.</b> It is {{generally}} thought to depict a corpulent and fertile Mother Goddess {{in the process}} of giving birth while seated on her throne, which has two hand rests in the form of feline (leopard or panther) heads. The statuette, one of several iconographically similar ones found at the site, is associated to other corpulent prehistoric goddess figures, of which the most famous is the Venus of Willendorf.|$|R
60|$|Evidently Lakamba's mercy went so far--for in a {{short while}} he came {{out from behind the}} curtain--but it did not go to the length of {{inducing}} him to make an extensive toilet. A short red sarong tightened hastily round his hips was his only garment. The merciful ruler of Sambir looked sleepy and rather sulky. He sat in the arm-chair, his knees well apart, his elbows on the <b>arm-rests,</b> his chin on his breast, breathing heavily and waiting malevolently for Dain to open the important talk.|$|R
50|$|To serve {{a target}} {{market for a}} low-priced, basic pickup truck, Studebaker {{produced}} a Scotsman truck based on {{the lines of the}} 1949-53 style of grille and front-end sheetmetal, with a few modifications. Most trucks in the 1950s had as standard one tail-lamp, one interior sun visor, one windshield wiper, and one arm-rest—all on the driver's side. The Scotsman followed this philosophy with one exception: there was no <b>arm-rest.</b> Externally, the Scotsman had simple plaid decals and no chrome trim.|$|E
50|$|Controllers {{are most}} {{commonly}} an <b>arm-rest</b> mounted joystick {{which may have}} additional controls to allow the user to tailor sensitivity or access multiple control modes. The controller may be swing-away to aid in side-transfers. For users {{who are unable to}} use a hand controller various alternatives are available such as sip-and-puff controllers, worked by blowing into a sensor. In some cases the controller may be mounted for use by an aide walking behind the chair rather than by the user. Capabilities include turning one drivewheel forward while the other goes backward, thus turning the wheelchair within its own length.|$|E
5000|$|Despite {{sharing the}} modern - if to modern eyes heavy looking - {{body of the}} Vedette, the Vendôme {{featured}} a more elaborate front treatment involving a greater quantity of chrome. Inside the bench seats were covered by materials of two contrasting colours and the rear bench seat (though not the front one) featured a thick central foldable <b>arm-rest.</b> [...] These, along with detailed differences on the instrument panel, differentiated the Vendôme. [...] A distinguishing, {{and at the time}} in France novel, feature which only became apparent after dark was the inclusion of reversing lights which came on automatically when reverse gear was selected.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Travers {{got up to}} {{see what}} was wanted, and {{returned}} without uttering a single word to the folding armchair {{by the side of the}} bed-place, with an envelope in her hand which she tore open in the greenish light. Mr. Travers remained incurious but his wife handed to him an unfolded sheet of paper which he condescended to hold up to his eyes. It contained only one line of writing. He let the paper fall on the coverlet and went on reposing as before. It was a sick man's repose. Mrs. Travers in the armchair, with her hands on the <b>arm-rests,</b> had a great dignity of attitude.|$|R
60|$|This {{is as much}} {{almost as}} anyone need know to begin essay writing. Given your proper pen and ink, or pencil and paper, you simply sit down and write the thing. The value of an essay is not its matter, but its mood. You must be comfortable, of course; an easy-chair with <b>arm-rests,</b> slippers, and a book to write upon are usually employed, {{and you must be}} fed recently, and your body clothed with ease rather than grandeur. For the rest, do not trouble to stick to your subject, or any subject; and take no thought for the editor or the reader, for your essay should be as {{spontaneous}} as the lilies of the field.|$|R
5000|$|Golden throne In {{addition}} to the bone chair the showcase includes a throne of oriental workmanship executed in the late 16th century. Having been presented by Shah Abbas I to Tsar Boris Godunov it was called a [...] "Persian throne with stones". The form of the throne with its low back flowing into sloping <b>arm-rests,</b> reveals features typical of Iranian furniture of the 16th-17th centuries. The makers have used ornament beloved in the East, i.e. strips of gold decorated with a foliate pattern and coloured stones - blue turquoises and red rubies, tourmalines. The back of the seat, the arms and the whole lower section of the throne were covered with gold Persian fabric, replaced by French velvet in 1742 for the coronation of Empress Elizabeth. In total this throne is adorned 552 rubies and pink tourmalines, 825 turquoises, 177 pearls and 700 halves of pearls.|$|R

50|$|Launched in 2007, the Indigo XL was {{a variant}} of the 2006 Indigo, with its {{wheelbase}} increased by 200 mm, and a few upmarket features. The added wheelbase translated into increased legroom in the second seating row, and a bigger trunk. Tata Motors positioned this as a premium product, and equipped it with a few upmarket features such as the option for leather upholstery, rear air-conditioner vents located on the transmission tunnel bump, between the two front seats; a center <b>arm-rest</b> for the rear bench, with cup-holders, and a new 16-valve MPFI petrol engine option, with DOHC and a power output of 101 HP. It retained the 70 HP DICOR engine from the Indigo.|$|E
5000|$|Some guitar makers, like Greg Smallman propose an armrest {{integrated}} to the guitar. An armrest provides {{three primary}} benefits: it lessens damping {{of the top}} caused by the right forearm; it is potentially more comfortable for the player; and it absorbs the wear to the finish that would otherwise happen on the top, the binding, and the side. These benefits are of particular importance for ultra-thin-topped instruments, such as Smallman’s, but will subtly improve any guitar, including double-tops. The Rasgueo-Rest armrest additionally helps large and tall players avoid hunching-over the Guitar, since the Guitar's surface area is in effect, [...] "expanded" [...] using the <b>arm-rest,</b> giving the arm-height support needed for good playing posture.|$|E
60|$|She obeyed instantly, {{and with}} her small hands {{gripping}} the <b>arm-rests</b> of the rude seat cowered in silence, while the clambering monster rushed and roared over the level lands and labored up the grades, shrieking now and again, as if in mingled pain and warning. Johnson and the brakeman, for the most part, kept to the lookout in the turret, and the girl rode alone--rode far, passing swiftly from girlhood to womanhood, so full of enforced meditation were the hours of that ride. It seemed that she was leaving something sweet and care-free behind her, and it was certain that {{she was about to}} face death. She had one perfectly clear conception, and that was that the man who had been most kind to her, and to whom she had given her promise of marriage, was dying and needed her--was calling for her through the night.|$|R
60|$|Along the Embankment, you see, {{there are}} iron seats at regular intervals, seats you cannot lie upon because iron <b>arm-rests</b> prevent that, and each seat, one saw by the lamplight, {{was filled with}} {{crouching}} and drooping figures. Not a vacant place remained, not one vacant place. These were the homeless, and {{they had come to}} sleep here. Now one noted a poor old woman with a shameful battered straw hat awry over her drowsing face, now a young clerk staring before him at despair; now a filthy tramp, and now a bearded, frock-coated, collarless respectability; I remember particularly one ghastly long white neck and white face that lopped backward, choked in some nightmare, awakened, clutched with a bony hand at the bony throat, and sat up and stared angrily as we passed. The wind had a keen edge that night even for us who had dined and were well clad. One crumpled figure coughed and went on coughing--damnably.|$|R
40|$|We pose 3 D scene-understanding as {{a problem}} of parsing in a grammar. A grammar helps us capture the {{compositional}} structure of real-word objects, e. g., a chair is composed of a seat, a back-rest and some legs. Having multiple rules for an object helps us capture structural variations in objects, e. g., a chair can optionally also have <b>arm-rests.</b> Finally, having rules to capture composition at different levels helps us formulate the entire scene-processing pipeline as a single problem of finding most likely parse-tree [...] -small segments combine to form parts of objects, parts to objects and objects to a scene. We attach a generative probability model to our grammar by having a feature-dependent probability function for every rule. We evaluated it by extracting labels for every segment and comparing the results with the state-of-the-art segment-labeling algorithm. Our algorithm was outperformed by the state-or-the-art method. But, Our model can be trained very efficiently (within seconds), and it scales only linearly in {{with the number of}} rules in the grammar. Also, we think that this is an important problem for the 3 D vision community. So, we are releasing our dataset and related code...|$|R
