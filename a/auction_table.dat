40|$|We use {{empirical}} {{properties of}} market bid functions in Treasury bill auctions {{to analyze the}} Treasury auction mechanism. We propose an econometric method that exploits data from <b>auction</b> <b>tables</b> and we determine variables influencing the shape of market bid functions and their fluctuations across auctions. We apply the estimation procedure to discriminatory French Treasury bill auctions. We propose several applications of our empirical model. First, we provide a tool to forecast incoming auctions. Second, we measure, by simulations, the impact of different environments on auction rates. Third, we provide new empirical perspectives on {{the debate about the}} best procedure between the discriminatory and the uniform price auctions. © 2005 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|In this work, we {{investigate}} two combinatorial auction formats {{in which each}} bidding bidder may be represented by a collection of unit-demand or price-vector agents. In the first model, bidder preferences are aggregated in a Bid Table, through which a bidder in a combinatorial auction may express several forms of subadditive preferences. We show that the gross substitutes property holds for this model, and design a large-scale combinatorial <b>auction</b> using bid <b>tables</b> as a demand revelation stage, determining linear price signals for later stages. The constraints of this model coincide naturally with the restrictions of recently proposed FAA landing-slot auctions, and we provide a slot auction design based on this model. In a second model, we explore the more complex behavior possible when each bidder's collection of price-vector agents coordinate based on a bidder-specified ordering of the auction items. With this coordination each bidder is able to convey a rich set of preferences, including the ability to express both superadditive and subadditive bundle synergies (i. e., substitutes and complements). The instructions for this collection of agents are tabulated in a lower-triangular Matrix Bid, and we compare the use of matrix bids to other compact techniques for writing down {{a wide variety of}} bidding information. We show that the winner determination problem for this Matrix Bid Auction is NP-hard, provide results from a series of computational experiments, and develop IP techniques for improving run time. In addition to the results on price-vector agents, bid tables, and matrix bidding, we present a new technique for achieving bidder-Pareto-optimal core outcomes in a sealed-bid combinatorial auction. The key idea of this iterative procedure is the formulation of the separation problem for core constraints at an arbitrary point in winner payment space...|$|R
40|$|The consumer-to-consumer {{online auction}} markets have grown rapidly since the recent decade. Several famous auction websites, such as eBay, Yahoo! and Amazon, provide {{platforms}} for their members (auction sellers and buyers) {{to gather together}} and do economic transaction without meeting the trading partners face to face. In this research, {{we focus on the}} auction participants as our research target. Past issues about auction markets almost discussed the effect upon consumer behavior, trust, auction mechanism, bidding and pricing strategies…and so on. They, however, did not consider the society that was established by auction participants. Moreover, they omitted that individuals were affected and restricted by social group behavior when they act in the group. Therefore, we observe the emerging online market by using social perspective. In this paper, we combine social capital theory and expectation-confirmation theory to examine the auction participants' intention to continue using auction Website, and employ the structural equation modeling to test our research model. We suppose that social capital in auction Website is produced by network capital, cognitive capital, and relational capital, and it may associate with auction users' satisfaction and auction continuance intention. As the results show, the users' perceived cognitive capital is significant associated with auction continuance intention. For the relational capital, the perceived relational capital is significantly associated with auction users' satisfaction, and the perceived relational capital is also indirectly associated with auction users' satisfaction according to their relational capital confirmation. The standardized path coefficients of network capital have no significance in this paper. Furthermore, we compare the influence of social capital between Yahoo! Taiwan Auctions and eBay Taiwan. Results show in this research support that the significant paths are the same. However, Yahoo! Taiwan Auctions users are superior to eBay Taiwan users in perceiving social capital, and it corresponds with the fact that Yahoo! Taiwan Auctions is more popular than eBay Taiwan. It means that users perceived social capital have positively association with the popularity of Website. 近幾年來，以C 2 C方式經營的線上拍賣市場呈現蓬勃的發展。許多知名的網站，如eBay、Yahoo及Amazon等，提供免費或收費的線上平台讓網路使用者在網站上進行新品或二手商品的交易。一個蓬勃發展的新興市場，自然會產生許多吸引人研究的課題，因此，本研究即以此一市場作為主要研究的對象。 在過去的拍賣研究中，多數偏向探討消費者行為(Consumer Behavior) 、信任(Trust) 、評價(Reputation) 、下標(Bidding) 與定價(Pricing) 策略等使用者個人因素對拍賣績效所產生的影響。雖然，個人(Individuals) 的因素在行銷理論中扮演非常重要的腳色，然而，研究者似乎忽略了一點，當個人在群體社會中活動時，個人行為多半會受到群體的影響，因此，由個人所組成的社會(Society) 也是影響績效的關鍵。 本研究主要是以社會學觀點來觀察這個新興的線上市場，並且以社會資本(Social Capital) 理論為基礎，探究社會資本對線上拍賣網站會產生那些影響。根據過去社會資本理論的文獻，本研究提出拍賣網站的社會資本是由網絡資本(Network Capital) 、認知資本(Cognitive Capital) 以及關係資本(Relational Capital) 集結而生。在研究架構部分，本文參考消費者行為理論中的期望-確認理論(Expectation-Confirmation Theory) ，藉由整合社會資本與期望-確認理論所形成的結構方程模式(Structural Equation Modeling) 來驗證社會資本與拍賣使用者滿意度(Satisfaction) 與持續參與拍賣意願(Auction Continuance Intention) 之間的相關性。研究結果顯示拍賣使用者感受到的認知資本與其持續參與拍賣意願間具有正面的相關性存在;在關係資本方面，與滿意度相關的直接效果(感受到的關係資本直接與滿意度相關) 與間接效果(使用者所感受到的關係資本會經由期望確認的程序後與滿意度相關) 都有顯著影響，但間接效果的影響大於直接效果的影響。也就是說，使用者確認其所感受到的關係是符合期望後，會產生較高的滿意與持續參與拍賣的意願。而網絡資本與滿意度及持續參與拍賣意願則無顯著相關。 另外，本研究中亦比較國內排名前兩大的拍賣網站-Yahoo奇摩拍賣與eBay，比較它們之間所存在的社會資本對其網站績效(使用者滿意度與持續參與意願) 是否會產生不同的影響結果。結果顯示兩個網站顯著的路徑相同，但是Yahoo奇摩拍賣使用者所獲得的社會資本高於eBay的使用者，這與Yahoo奇摩拍賣較eBay受歡迎的事實相呼應，表示使用者獲得的社會資本與網站的熱絡程度有正面的關係。Table of Contents 中文摘要……………………………………………………………………………………………i Abstract…………………………………………………………………………………………ii Table of Content……………………………………………………………………………iv List of Tables………………………………………………………………………………vi List of Figures……………………………………………………………………………vii Chapter 1 Introduction 1. 1 	Background and Motivation…………………………………………………… 2 1. 2 	The Objectives …………………………………………………………………… 3 1. 3 	Research Procedure……………………………………………………………… 4 Chapter 2 Literature Review 2. 1 Online Auction Market ……………………………………………………………… 6 	 2. 1. 1 eBay vs. Yahoo! ………………………………………………………… 6 	 2. 1. 2 Relatives Issues About Online Auction………………………… 8 2. 2 Social Capital Theory ……………………………………………………………… 10 	 2. 2. 1 The Concept of Social Capital…………………………………… 10 	 2. 2. 2 The Perspectives in Social Capital…………………………… 13 	 2. 2. 3 Online Social Capital ……………………………………………… 14 2. 3 Expectation-Confirmation Theory ……………………………………………… 16 Chapter 3 Research Methodology 3. 1 Research Framework, Variables and Hypotheses…………………………… 20 	 3. 1. 1 Network Capital………………………………………………………… 21 	 3. 1. 2 Cognitive Capital……………………………………………………… 24 	 3. 1. 3 Relational Capital …………………………………………………… 25 	 3. 1. 4 Auction Satisfaction and Continuance Intention ………… 27 3. 2 Instrument Construction…………………………………………………………… 28 3. 3 Analysis Method………………………………………………………………………… 30 Chapter 4 Result 4. 1 Research Target………………………………………………………………………… 32 4. 2 Respondents' Profile………………………………………………………………… 33 4. 3 Research Design………………………………………………………………………… 35 4. 4 Data Analysis and Results………………………………………………………… 36 	 4. 4. 1 Scale Validation ……………………………………………………… 36 	 4. 4. 2 Hypotheses Testing …………………………………………………… 41 Chapter 5 Discussion and Conclusions 5. 1 Implications …………………………………………………………………………… 47 	 5. 1. 1 Cognitive Capital in Online Auction…………………………… 47 	 5. 1. 2 Relational Capital in Online Auction………………………… 48 	 5. 1. 3 Network Capital in Online Auction……………………………… 48 5. 2 Comparison between Yahoo!
