2500|$|Bull and Peel, {{by early}} 1867, had moved their {{operations}} on to Belmont, Nevada, {{and then to}} Salt Lake City, Utah. While in Salt Lake City, the two argued, {{and for a time}} separated. [...] However, by the summer of 1867 the two were working together again, by this time in Helena, Montana. On the night of July 22, 1867, Peel and Bull were seated <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>table</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> [...] "Greer Brothers Exchange Saloon", and for some reason the argument they had previously had was rekindled. Both men jumped to their feet and became arguing loudly.|$|E

2500|$|The {{earliest}} sketches feature two men {{inside the}} brothel; a sailor and {{a medical student}} (who was often depicted holding either a book or a skull, causing Barr and others to read the painting as a memento mori, a reminder of death). A trace of their presence <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>table</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> center remains: the jutting edge of a table {{near the bottom of}} the canvas. The viewer, Steinberg argues, has come to replace the sitting men, forced to confront the gaze of prostitutes head on, invoking readings far more complex than a simple allegory or the autobiographical reading that attempts to understand the work in relation to Picasso's own history with women. A world of meanings then becomes possible, suggesting the work as a meditation on the danger of sex, the [...] "trauma of the gaze" [...] (to use a phrase of Rosalind Krauss's invention), and the threat of violence inherent in the scene and sexual relations at large.|$|E

60|$|That same fear {{of being}} alone, which has driven many a man to his cups, sent me back to Brooks's for company.
