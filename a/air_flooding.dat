40|$|The {{development}} {{effect of}} water flooding in an ultra-low permeability reservoir is poor {{due to its}} poor physical properties and high shale content, so an experimental study of <b>air</b> <b>flooding</b> which helps to complement energy production was carried out. Based on the Accelerating Rate Calorimeter experimental results, the crude oil of N block in L oilfield can undergo low-temperature oxidation reactions, which are the basic condition for <b>air</b> <b>flooding.</b> Three groups of experimental natural cylinder cores designed for oil displacement, water flooding and <b>air</b> <b>flooding</b> were used respectively, {{and the relationship between}} differential pressure, oil recovery, injection capacity with injection volume was investigated. It is observed that the recovery efficiency increased 2. 58 %, the injection-production pressure difference dropped 60 % and the injection capability increased 60 % in the experiment of shifting <b>air</b> <b>flooding</b> after water flooding to 75 % moisture content, compared with water flooding alone. It has been shown in the results that the recovery efficiency improved sharply more than water flooding, the effect of depressurization and augmented injection was obvious, and the air displacement was thus validated. We suggest that other science and technology workers should perform further tests and verify this result through numerical simulation...|$|E
30|$|Whether air {{injection}} can extract additional oil in high water cut reservoirs {{is a big}} question. In this paper, long-core displacement experiment {{has been carried out}} to investigate the potential of low oxygen <b>air</b> <b>flooding</b> in high water cut reservoirs. Results indicate that implementing low oxygen {{air injection}} has potential to improve oil recovery in high water cut light oil reservoir. The reservoir with higher matrix permeability and or lower reservoir permeability contrast ratio is desirable to achieve higher oil recovery factor. In addition, the oil recovery factor for water/gas alternate injection (WAG) strategy is higher than that of continuous low oxygen <b>air</b> <b>flooding.</b> And the WAG strategy has the ability to delay gas breakthrough compared with the strategy of continuous low oxygen air injection under same experiment condition.|$|E
30|$|In this paper, we {{find that}} low oxygen air {{injection}} displacement efficiency ranges from 6.86 to 11.74 % for homogeneous porous medium which is impressive in high water cut reservoir. The pilot crude oil in this research mainly shows oxygen addition reaction with low oxygen consumption is less than 1.2 %. The reservoir with higher matrix permeability and or lower reservoir permeability contrast ratio is desirable to achieve higher oil recovery factor. The oil viscosity increased after oxidation which was helpful to prevent gas breakthrough. The existence of heterogeneity is sometimes favorable for oil recovery during low oxygen air injection in high water cut reservoir. The influence of permeability is greater than heterogeneous on oil recovery for low oxygen air injection in high water cut reservoir. Injection mode of WAG has better performance than that of consecutive low oxygen <b>air</b> <b>flooding.</b> WAG could prevent gas breakthrough due to the creative of water/gas slug and results in higher extent of oxidation reaction in high water cut reservoir.|$|E

30|$|The {{effluent}} gas {{has been}} analyzed, {{and the results}} are listed in Table  2. The effluent CO and CO 2 verifies the existence of LTO reactions during low oxygen <b>air</b> <b>flooding</b> in high water cut reservoir as the available literature indicates that CO 2 and CO are significant component evidence for bond scission and heat release process (Zhao et al. 2012; Jia et al. 2014; Montes et al. 2010). The maximum value of effluent CO 2 for long-core permeability of 2, 20 and 50  mD is 0.45, 0.83 and 1.21 %, respectively. And the effluent CO concentration for each test is 0.38, 0.51 and 0.58 %. The generation of flue gas is increased with the increasing of core permeability. Higher extent of LTO reaction in higher permeability long cores is responsible for this difference. However, the limit consumption of oxygen reflects the poor oxidation ability of the selecting crude oil in the high water cut condition. Lacking of contacting area for crude oil and gas and or serious heat loss in high water cut reservoir contributes to this weakness.|$|E
40|$|Accelerating {{growth of}} urban populations, {{especially}} in developing countries, {{has become a}} driving force of human development. Crowded cities are centres of creativity and economic progress, but polluted <b>air,</b> <b>flooding</b> and other climate impacts, means they also face major weather, climate and environment-related challenges. Increasingly dense, complex and interdependent urban systems leave cities vulnerable: a single extreme event {{can lead to a}} widespread breakdown of a city’s infrastructure often through domino effects. The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) recognizes that rapid urbanization necessitates new types of services which make the best use of science and technology and considers the challenge of delivering these as one of the main priorities for the meteorological community. Such Integrated Urban Weather, Environment and Climate Services should assist cities in facing hazards such as storm surges, flooding, heat waves, and air pollution episodes, especially in changing climates. The aim is to build urban services that meet the special needs of cities through a combination of dense observation networks, high-resolution forecasts, multi-hazard early warning systems, and climate services for reducing emissions, that will enable the building of resilient, thriving sustainable cities that promote the Sustainable Development Goals. A number of recent international studies have been initiated to explore these issues. The paper provides a brief overview of recent WMO and collaborators research programs and activities in urban hydrometeorology, climate and air pollution; describes the novel concept of urban integrated weather, climate and environment related services; and highlights research needs for their realisation...|$|E
40|$|Like much of Western Sydney, the Penrith Panthers {{league team}} was often sneered at by big-city sophisticates, argues David Burchell SYDNEY’S {{football}} pundits severely underestimated the Penrith Panthers, the premier sporting {{representatives of the}} city’s west, on Sunday night. Pundits usually do. The game’s defining moment came when lumbering Penrith lock Scott Sattler, the archetypal journeyman, somehow ran down his opponents’ fastest player, then pulled him neatly into touch. A veteran of several minor regional teams, Sattler had played two seasons with the club he {{faced on the field}} on Sunday without scoring a single appearance in the first-grade run-on side. But there were no cool-dude high-fives; he just packed without fanfare into the scrum. Very Penrith. Nearly every commentator in Sydney’s two daily newspapers had picked the team officially called the Sydney Roosters (but known to every football follower simply as Easts, in recognition of their prior name and geographical location) as big winners in Sydney’s footballing finale. One respected commentator even explained - apparently by algebra - how the Penrith Panthers couldn’t win, as if football was a compound equation. Penrith were described as likeable underdogs with a watchable but unsophisticated, ‘helter-skelter’ style of play. Their opponents, the Roosters, on the other hand, were rugby league virtuosos, a class act. The facts that Penrith had dominated the competition for much of the year, that they’d finished first {{at the end of the}} regular season, and that they were very obviously (in that most elusive but invaluable of football terms) ‘on a roll’, were overlooked. As so often before, the city’s outer reaches were treated with foolish condescension. Strangers to Australia’s largest and most self-absorbed city often struggle to make sense of the rancorous inter-regional dramas that underlie its tumultuous social life. Every city, after all, has its richer suburbs and its poorer suburbs, the innocent visitor muses. Why do Sydneysiders behave as if their city’s social divisions were part of some larger, especially Sydney-ish, divine plan? Why do inhabitants of the city’s eastern half persist in treating ‘the west’ as if it’s a different city, a kind of undifferentiated mass of naive 1950 s suburban mores and values untouched by the inexorable march of cosmopolitan culture and sophistication? The answers to these questions say a lot about Sydney. But they say something about Australia’s present political and cultural schisms, too. Ever since the ’ 40 s, when the inhabitants of Sydney’s old inner-city first began rolling westwards in search of the good life on the suburban frontier, the city has thought of itself as divided into two unequal halves, with different destinies. Sophistication in the world city supposedly spread on the ocean <b>air,</b> <b>flooding</b> over the city’s east, wafting over its northern reaches, then ebbing southwards, but hitting a contrary weather front at some point to the west. But that front has shifted with bewildering speed. When the Parramatta Eels contested their first grand finals in the late ’ 70 s, Parramatta - a mere 15 km from the city’s CBD - was thought of as the epicentre of the west. Eels supporters were widely parodied as members of the Ugh-boot tribe, carriers of the flag of suburban dagginess, with bad haircuts and out-of-date flares. Nowadays Parramatta is a boom town and its residents are starting to experiment with home coffee machines and designer kitchens. When Penrith won their first (and until Sunday, last) premiership in 1991, quite a lot of Sydney’s residents still weren’t exactly sure where Penrith was. Though Penrith is as flat as a billiard table, the Panthers were called ‘the Mountain Men’, since people from the east and north at least knew where the Blue Mountains were. Nowadays Panthers World of Entertainment, the licensed club that supports the Panthers out of its palatial headquarters on the Nepean River, is the knowing Sydneysider’s byword for the supposedly oversized, tacky and gauche tastes of the city’s hinterland. Penrith has become the city’s new id. In recent years this apparently light-hearted contempt has acquired a new, more complicated twist. For, in fact, large tracts of the city’s west aren’t poor any more. Rather, they’re the refuge of the upwardly mobile tradespeople and young suburban families who ‘want something better’ for their children than they had. There’s a boom in those large, tidy housing estates that have sent the urban sociologists gaga in recent years with moral anxieties about ‘white flight’ and ‘walled towns’. A modest but increasing number of houses have two storeys and a swimming-pool and the Falcons are mutating into four-wheel drives. The innocent outsider might think this would help the image of the west. If anything, the reverse is true. Ever since the nation’s great trauma over the Tampa asylum-seeker stand-off in mid to late 2001, western Sydney has been tagged as the epicentre of the nation’s supposed heartlessness. Now that they’re doing better for themselves, the story goes, the denizens of the west just want to hide in their big backyards and reject the world. So far as Sydney’s opinion-makers are concerned, it often seems the poor and the battling are funny, but objects of solicitude. The striving and the self-respecting are just crass or plain reprehensible. It’s a fatal formula. First, drum into western Sydney residents for decades that they’re second-class citizens without class. Then parody their desire for security and stability as paranoia and xenophobia. Then lecture them about how they need to develop a social conscience - as if this is something that comes with a university education, or from watching subtitled movies on SBS. At times, one could be forgiven for thinking that our contemporary advocates of compassion and the social conscience don’t really want to convert anyone. They’d rather alienate them, the better to parade themselves as moral martyrs. Certainly, that seems to have been the formula in the great social cauldron of contemporary Sydney. Whatever one’s views on the great moral issues of the day, though, it has to be said plainly that suburban stalwarts of national security and ‘border protection’ are not morally deficient. They’re just morally different from their critics. The Sydney Roosters hail from the heartland of Sydney cosmopolitanism. They do television ads for men’s fragrances and model fashion for the newspapers. Why, they’re veritable metrosexuals. Yet you’d struggle to spot an Easts supporter who has regularly turned up to matches for more than a few years. Easts isn’t a football club so much as a smart idea. Penrith’s support has gone up and down like a yo-yo over the years. A couple of years ago locals used to heckle the then wooden-spooners on their training ground. But everyone in the outer west knows, when a battle like Sunday’s grand final comes up, where their loyalties lie. It’s primal, and not always pretty, but it makes sense. This is no Sydney eccentricity. Empathy for ‘the other’ and compassion for the suffering of distant lands are noble ideals. On the other hand, the advocates of these high global ideals not infrequently combine them with a summary contempt for the ordinary striving citizens of their own nation. If you look around you and see your best and staunchest friends in your own street, suburb and locality, on the other hand, your moral universe will be a concrete one, rooted in place. And you’ll view cosmopolitan idealism with a sullen scepticism. If our advocates of conscience don’t want to become, once more, an Easts to the Penrith of suburban nationalism, they’d better learn some new plays.

Here a new high efficiency cooling technology—cryogenic pneumatic mist jet impinging (CPMJI) cooling technology is offered. In this technology, a little quantity of coolant is carried by high-pressure cryogenic air (– 20 ℃) and reaches the machining zone in the form of mist jet to enhance heat transfer in machining zone.

This research built on previous research conducted in these Atlanta communities. This research provides a prioritized list of environmental hazards and concerns of residents living in NPU-V and PCW, in order to inform further scientific research, education, and exposure reduction strategies. AIM: To understand and prioritize environmental health concerns in NPU-V and PCW as voiced by community residents. METHODS: With approval from the Georgia State University Institutional Review Board (IRB), we organized and conducted three community focus groups. Community organizations provided space for focus groups and assisted with recruitment of volunteers through posting flyers, electronic notices, and person-to-person outreach. The focus groups were held in June and July, 2016. The researchers asked {{a series of questions}} in an open-ended format and asked each participant to complete a short evaluation {{at the end of the}} focus group. Responses were recorded in Microsoft Excel. RESULTS: The community members identified air quality, water quality, drinking water, flooding, dust/pollution in homes and brownfields as their highest priorities. The top three prioritized health hazards identified by the community members were <b>flooding,</b> <b>air</b> quality/pollution, and brownfields. The health hazards that were discussed were cancer, asthma, other respiratory illnesses, emphysema, diabetes, and hypertension, with an emphasis on asthma and cancer. The community showed great interest in being provided data on their community’s brownfield composition and child asthma rates. The prioritized list of environmental hazards that were discussed most frequently by the residents were <b>flooding,</b> <b>air</b> pollution, and brownfields. DISCUSSION: The findings from this research suggest that while residents have many environmental health concerns, the three issues that resurfaced frequently were: <b>flooding,</b> <b>air</b> pollution, and brownfields. These are the prioritized environmental hazards that the community identified and are seeking solutions. The results of this focus group can inform future environmental health research in Atlanta and provide preliminary research for grant funding applications...|$|R
