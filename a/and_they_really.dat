Allison adds, [...] "The interesting, the most significant thing that did occur out {{of the fact that}} we didn't end up starting the album on that day of the rehearsal was that Chris Martin had not written 'Yellow' by that time".|$|E

500|$|By 2009, {{there had}} been four {{versions}} of the album released: a rare London Records promotional disc, a bootleg with cover art by Arik Roper, the Rise Above/Music Cartel Records album, and a release by Tee Pee Records. The Rise Above/Music Cartel release was an unauthorized edited version, released in 1999 under the title Jerusalem. Jerusalem runs at 52 minutes and is a single composition split into six identically named tracks.

Cisneros spoke most positively about the 2003 Dopesmoker release, saying [...] "I don't think the Dopesmoker thing is the exact version that we submitted, but that's the closest one that's {{come out of the}} four.

Jarmusch stated that he was a fan of Sleep and listed them along with Earth and Sunn O))) as an influence for creating the film: [...] "I love these kind of visual landscapes they make, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>really</b> inspired things for me for my film The Limits of Control".|$|E
500|$|... "Frozens success doesn't {{benefit from}} a general {{appetite}} for American films in Japan" [...] (as reported by the International Business Times), but according to Akira Lippit of the USC School of Cinematic Arts, there were several factors that constituted this phenomenon: besides the fact that animated films [...] "are held in great regard in Japan, and the Disney brand name {{with all of its}} heritage is extremely valuable", [...] "the biggest reason is the primary audience... 13- to 17-year-old teenage girls." [...] He further explained that audiences of this age range have a vital role in shaping Japanese pop culture and [...] "Frozen has so many elements that appeal to them, with its story of a young girl with power and mystique, who finds her own sort of good in herself." [...] He compared the film's current situation with a similar phenomenon which occurred with Titanic in 1997, [...] "when millions of Japanese teen girls turned out to watch Leonard DiCaprio go under– several times," [...] and thought the same would happen with Frozen. Another reason that contributed to the film's success in the market was that Disney took great care in choosing [...] "high quality" [...] voice actors for the Japanese-dubbed version, since Japan's pop music scene had an important role particularly with teenage audiences. Orika Hiromura, Disney Japan's marketing project leader for Frozen, {{said in an interview with}} The Wall Street Journal: [...] "We really put effort into finding actors who could not only play the role but also belt out the tunes as well. We found the perfect match in Takako Matsu and Sayaka Kanda, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>really</b> added a whole new dimension to the storytelling." ...|$|E

2500|$|On November 24, 2010, {{the day of}} the film's release, {{directors}} Nathan Greno and Byron Howard disputed {{reports that}} the title change was a marketing decision.

They {{went on to say that}} you cannot call Toy Story [...] "Buzz Lightyear," [...] <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>really</b> needed a title that represented what the film is, and that it's a duo, and it stars Rapunzel and Flynn Rider.|$|E

And what happened was, I saw Pong, and I said, well, that's the arena for him.
