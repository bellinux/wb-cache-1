6000|$|... "A {{glass of}} sugar-and-water. You know, I am not easily tired. <b>And,</b> <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>you,</b> {{it is better}} to come to {{business}} at once: so prepare them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "At any rate," [...] Harold said, [...] "the plan is {{a hopeful}} one, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> {{that it is a}} {{thousand}} times better to try it than it is to stop here with the certainty of being shot down before morning." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{understand}} precisely," [...] said Raybold, nodding {{his head}} sagaciously; [...] "of her own sex. Yes, I see your drift, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> absolutely. There {{is a little too}} much of that thing over there, and I don't wonder you are annoyed." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{understood}} perfectly, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> you," [...] Holder replied. [...] "I have come, quite recently, to {{the same}} conclusion myself." ...|$|R
60|$|Rectus {{thought this}} was {{the worst kind of}} injustice, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>with</b> him, {{although}} <b>I</b> didn't see {{what we were going to}} do about it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Shall I scream, William Adolphus?" [...] I {{demanded of}} that {{intelligent}} animal. William Adolphus shook his head. This is a fact. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>with</b> him.|$|R
6000|$|Frank nodded. [...] "I quite {{understand}} that, old fellow, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> thoroughly. A question might be asked any {{day that you}} could not reply to without saying how you came to be here; {{and for the sake of}} the count as well as yourself, that should be avoided if possible." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{hope that}} I {{may have the}} {{pleasure}} of introducing you to-night. I've had one or two little turns also with Mr. John Clay, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> that {{he is at the}} head of his profession. It is past ten, however, and quite time that we started. If you two will take the first hansom, Watson and I will follow in the second." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You {{come to the}} point, my dear,' said my aunt. 'They {{are not to be}} got rid of, for {{six months}} at least, unless they could be underlet, and that I don't believe. The last man died here. Five people out of six would die--of course--of that woman in nankeen with the flannel petticoat. I have a little ready money; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>you,</b> the best thing we can do, is, to live the term out here, and get a bedroom hard by.' ...|$|E
5000|$|... "I {{thought the}} world of Ross Perot. I put him up there with our {{founding}} fathers. I liked the way he talked. He’d say 'We’ve got {{to clean out the}} barn!' <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>with</b> everything he said." ...|$|R
60|$|Besides {{love and}} sympathy, animals exhibit other qualities {{connected}} with the social instincts, which in us would be called moral; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> Agassiz (16. 'De l'Espece et de la Classe,' 1869, p. 97.) that dogs possess something very like a conscience.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{was talking}} about it," [...] {{corrected}} Mr. Wilks, in a hoarse voice. [...] "You brought up the subject <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>with</b> you--not that it matters to me 'ow people get married. That's their affair. Banns or license, it's all one to me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "MY DEAR LYDIA--The cab {{is waiting}} at the door, and I have only a moment {{to tell you that}} I am obliged to leave London, on business, for three or four days, or a week at longest. My letters will be {{forwarded}} if you write. I got yours yesterday, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> that {{it is very important to}} put him off the awkward subject of yourself and your family as long as you safely can. The better you know him, the better you will be able to make up the sort of story that will do. Once told, you will have to stick to it; and, having to stick to it, beware of making it complicated, and beware of making it in a hurry. I will write again about this, and give you my own ideas. In the meantime, don't risk meeting him too often in the park.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{was an act}} {{for which}} you were not really {{responsible}}. Had {{you been able to}} think, you would not have done so. I do not take the view the Doctor does, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> that a man loving a woman should first of all think of her and of her safety. So you thought when you could think, but you were no more responsible for your action than a madman for a murder committed when in a state of frenzy. It was an impulse you could not control. Had you, after the impulse had passed, come down here, believing, as you might well have believed, that it was absolutely impossible to rescue me from my fate, it would have been different. But the moment you came to yourself you deliberately took every risk and showed how brave you were when master of yourself. I am speaking plainly, perhaps more plainly than I ought to. But I should despise myself had I not the courage to speak out now when so much is at stake, and after all you have done for me.|$|E
6000|$|... "If we are {{to emigrate}} at all," [...] Mr. Renshaw replied, [...] "I should {{certainly}} prefer New Zealand myself. The Maoris are a most interesting people. Their origin {{is a matter of}} doubt, their customs and religion are peculiar, and I have no doubt that I should, after studying them, be able to throw much new and valuable light upon the subject. Personally, I am sure that I am in no way fitted for the life of a settler. I know nothing of farming, and could neither drive a plough nor wield an axe; but if I could make the native subject my own, I might probably be able to do my share towards our expenses by my books, while Wilfrid could look after the men. The offer of these two young fellows to go with us has removed several of my objections to the plan, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> that it would be more advantageous for Wilfrid and Marion than to be living in wretched lodgings. Therefore, my dear, I have decided to fall in with your plan, and only hope that it will turn out as well as you seem to expect. It will be a great change and a great trial; but since you seem to have set your heart upon it, I am willing to adopt your plans instead of my own, and we will therefore consider it settled that we will go to New Zealand." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “She is, as Johnson says, sir, a square-rigged ship, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> him {{as to the}} cut of her sails. She is {{certainly}} a Frenchman, and evidently a large frigate. She is running down the coast as we are, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> expect hopes {{to get through the}} Straits at night.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{sooner the}} better, Harry," [...] Polly said, eagerly; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>with</b> her, for <b>I</b> really dreaded being by our two selves in that {{rambling}} old house, where every room, {{every piece of}} furniture, every act of our daily life would bring back some association of him who was gone.|$|R
60|$|Secondly, Marinetti {{is wrong}} when {{he claims that}} matter is the only mystery and the only reality. <b>I</b> say <b>and</b> as you, my reader, realize, I speak with authority--I say that matter is the only illusion. Comte called the world, which is {{tantamount}} to matter, the great fetich, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> Comte.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, maybe I might have, Mrs. Dr. dear, and I {{intended}} to, but one remark he made aggravated me {{beyond my}} powers of endurance. If {{it had not}} been for that I would not have chased him with my dye-pot. I will tell you the whole interview. Whiskers sat down, as I have said, and right beside him on another chair Doc was lying. The animal was pretending to be asleep but I knew very well he was not, for he has been Hyde all day and Hyde never sleeps. By the way, Mrs. Dr. dear, have you noticed that that cat is far oftener Hyde than Jekyll now? The more victories Germany wins the Hyder he becomes. I leave you to draw your own conclusions from that. I suppose Whiskers thought he might curry favour with me by praising the creature, little dreaming what my real sentiments towards it were, so he stuck out his pudgy hand and stroked Mr. Hyde's back. 'What a nice cat,' he said. The nice cat flew at him and bit him. Then it gave a fearful yowl, and bounded out of the door. Whiskers looked after it quite amazed. 'That is a queer kind of a varmint,' he said. I agreed with him on that point, but I was not going to let him see it. Besides, what business had he to call our cat a varmint? 'It may be a varmint or it may not,' I said, 'but it knows the difference between a Canadian and a Hun.' You would have thought, would you not, Mrs. Dr. dear, that a hint like that would have been enough for him! But it went no deeper than his skin. I saw him settling back quite comfortable, as if for a good talk, and thought I, 'If there is anything coming it may as well come soon and be done with, for with all these rags to dye before supper I have no time to waste in flirting,' so I spoke right out. 'If you have anything particular to discuss with me, Mr. Pryor, I would feel obliged if you would mention it without loss of time, because I am very busy this afternoon.' He fairly beamed at me out of that circle of red whisker, and said, 'You are a business-like woman <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>you.</b> There is no use in wasting time beating around the bush. I came up here today to ask you to marry me.' So there it was, Mrs. Dr. dear. I had a proposal at last, after waiting sixty-four years for one.|$|E
5000|$|On August 9, 2011, Burgess {{met with}} a Tea Party group in Keller, Texas to discuss his vote to raise the debt ceiling. When a {{constituent}} asked if the House of Representatives was considering impeaching President Barack Obama, Burgess responded, [...] "It needs to happen, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> it would tie things up... No question about that." ...|$|E
5000|$|In 2010, Archbishop of New Orleans Gregory Michael Aymond {{clarified}} that alligator is {{also considered}} seafood, saying [...] "Yes, the alligator's {{considered in the}} fish family, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> — God has created a magnificent creature {{that is important to}} the state of Louisiana, and it is considered seafood." [...] This was in response to a letter from a local alligator wrangler.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{think it}} right to deceive Mamma," [...] said Fanny. [...] "I know him well enough to be quite sure {{that he will not}} take the title, as he has no {{property}} to support it. He has talked it over with me again <b>and</b> again, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> him altogether." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{afraid that}} admonition hasn't had much effect, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> Mr. Grant that the Sachem is a {{gathering}} place for doubtful characters," [...] Hardie went on. [...] "What's worse, I've reasons for supposing that Beamish gets {{some of them}} to help him in supplying the Indians on the reservation with liquor." ...|$|R
60|$|Mr. Luker {{believed}} {{the story to}} be, as to all main essentials, true--on this ground, that Mr. Godfrey Ablewhite was too great a fool to have invented it. Mr. Bruff <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> Mr. Luker, in considering this test of {{the truth of the}} story to be a perfectly reliable one.|$|R
5000|$|Nelson himself {{wrote back}} to Ball from the Baltic on 4 June 1801: [...] "My dear, {{invaluable}} friend,... believe me, my heart entertains the very warmest affection for you, {{and it has}} been no fault of mine, and not a little mortification, that you have not the red ribbon and other rewards that would have kept you afloat; but as I trust the war is at an end, you must take your flag when it comes to you, for who is to command our fleets in a future war?... I pity the poor Maltese; they have sustained an irreparable loss in your friendly counsel and an able director in their public concerns; you were truly their father, <b>and,</b> <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>you,</b> they may not like stepfathers.... Believe me at all times and places, for ever your sincere, affectionate, and faithful friend." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "For {{the reasons}} set forth below, I am {{of the opinion}} that federal courts do have the power to award damages for {{violation}} of 'constitutionally protected interests' <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> the Court that a traditional judicial remedy such as damages is appropriate to the vindication of the personal interests protected by the Fourth Amendment." ...|$|R
40|$|I {{am quite}} pleased {{the result of}} the Proposition 8 litigation. I believe that gays {{should have the right to}} marry, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> District Judge Walker’s {{conclusion}} that Prop 8 violates the Equal Protection Clause, because there is no rational basis for it. But the process bothers me. An important party got lost in the shuffle: democracy...|$|R
5000|$|... "Everyone is {{entitled}} to their opinion. I {{have no problem with}} him doing so. He does make some valid points, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> him to an extent. But Sfakianakis should acknowledge that these are exceptions - those who lack talent are in the minority. My mantra is that it is better to be envied than to be pitied." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Withers {{came into}} the room early in the morning. [...] "My husband says you are not to think of getting up unless you feel quite equal to it, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> him; so if you like I will bring breakfast up to you, and then you can go off to sleep again for a bit." ...|$|R
60|$|Whether Auld Maitland {{be a good}} or a bad ballad is {{not part}} of the question. It was a {{favourite}} of mine in childhood, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> Scott in thinking that it has strong dramatic situations. If it is a bad ballad, such as many people could compose, then it is not by Sir Walter.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> {{everything}} Mr. Choate {{has said}} in his letter regarding Mr. Jerome; <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> everything Mr. Shepard has said; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> everything Mr. Jerome {{has said in}} his own commendation. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> thought Mr. Jerome was modest in that. If he {{had been talking about}} another officer of this county, he could have painted the joys and sorrows of office and his victories in even stronger language than he did.|$|R
40|$|In the August 1998 {{issue of}} this journal, Dianne Lewis wrote a {{critical}} article about organizational culture. She argues that the concept may not be useless, but it is ill-defined and its link with an organization's performance is tenuous. I read the paper <b>with</b> pleasure <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> the author on most points. However, I have a few comments to make...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{he told me}} that {{he would}} have given one of his eyes to kill me, only Colepepper wouldn't let him go on. He half quarrelled with his second, but the man told him that I had not fired at him, and the thing must drop. 'It's better as it is, you know,' he said. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>with</b> him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{see why we}} shouldn't march away, if we could," [...] Edwards said. [...] "Now {{that the}} game is quite lost here, I don't think anyone could blame you for saving the company, if possible, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> Nat that Montcalm will find it difficult, if not impossible, to keep his Indians in hand. The French have never troubled much on that score." ...|$|R
60|$|Mr. Sakari {{suggested}} that himself, <b>and</b> when <b>I</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>with</b> him {{he proceeded to}} demolish it. He has treated me dreadfully.|$|R
6000|$|... "'What the--' I {{started to}} yell, and 'Holy hell,' Seth says, as {{both of us}} looked at {{what was on the}} track. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>with</b> Seth entirely in his remark. It was an Indian girl--and take it from me, Indians ain't Spiggoties by any manner of means. Seth had managed to fetch a stop within twenty feet of her, and us bowling down hill at that! But the girl. She--" ...|$|R
