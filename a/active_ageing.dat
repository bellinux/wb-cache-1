40|$|IntroductionGovernments across Europe want {{to promote}} healthy and <b>active</b> <b>aging,</b> {{as a matter}} of both public health and {{economic}} sustainability. Designing policies focused on the most vulnerable groups requires information at the individual level. However, a measure of healthy and <b>active</b> <b>aging</b> at the individual level does not yet exist. ObjectivesThis paper develops the Selfie Aging Index (SAI), an individual-level index of healthy and <b>active</b> <b>aging.</b> The SAI is developed thinking about a tool that would allow each person to take a selfie of her aging status. Therefore, it is based entirely on self-assessed indicators. This paper also illustrates how the SAI may look like in practice. MethodsThe SAI is based on the Biopsychosocial Assessment Model (MAB), a tool for the multidimensional assessment of older adults along three domains: biological, psychological, and social. Indicators are selected and their weights determined based on an ordered probit model that relates the MAB indicators to self-assessed health, which proxies healthy and <b>active</b> <b>aging.</b> The ordered probit model predicts the SAI based on the estimated parameters. Finally, predictions are rescaled to the 0 – 1 interval. Data for the SAI development come from the Study of the Aging Profiles of the Portuguese Population and the Survey of Health, Aging, and Retirement in Europe. ResultsThe selected indicators are BMI, having difficulties moving around indoors and performing the activities of daily living, feeling depressed, feeling nervous, lacking energy, time awareness score, marital status, having someone to confide in, education, type of job, exercise, and smoking status. The model also determines their weights. ConclusionResults shed light on various factors that contribute significantly to healthy and <b>active</b> <b>aging.</b> Two examples are mental health and exercise, which deserve more attention from individuals themselves, health-care professionals, and public health policy. The SAI has the potential to put the individual {{at the center of the}} healthy and <b>active</b> <b>aging</b> discussion, contribute to patient empowerment, and promote patient-centered care. It can become a useful instrument to monitor healthy and <b>active</b> <b>aging</b> for different actors, including individuals themselves, health-care professionals, and policy makers...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Introduction: <b>Active</b> <b>aging</b> is {{the process}} of {{optimizing}} opportunities for health, participation and security, aiming to improve quality of life as people age. A series of studies had demonstrated that a lower prevalence of depression is found among more active elderly. Objective: To evaluate the association between indicators of <b>active</b> <b>aging</b> and depressive symptoms among the elderly (aged 60 years or more). Method: A population-based cross-sectional study was conducted with 1, 006 elderly people (aged 60 years or over) from a small-sized Brazilian municipality. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Geriatric Depression Scale - 15, with cutoff point ≥ 6 symptoms. <b>Active</b> <b>aging</b> was evaluated using indicators such as: active occupational situation, manual work, reading and physical activities. Data analyses used modified Poisson regression to obtain crude and adjusted prevalence ratios (PR). Results: Most of the elderly people were: white, women and aged between 60 and 74 years. All the indicators of <b>active</b> <b>aging</b> were associated with the outcome. After controlling for socioeconomic, demographic and health variables, elderly people who worked, participated in groups, did manual work and maintained interests such as reading and talking to friends had lower prevalence of depressive symptoms compared to those not doing these activities.

Vital Aging® is a program that considers <b>active</b> <b>aging</b> as the lifelong adaptation process of maximizing health and independence, physical and cognitive functioning, positive affect regulation and control, and social engagement. Through its different versions and editions, it has demonstrated being an effective program to promote <b>active</b> <b>aging.</b> The aim {{of this study is to}} determine the effectiveness of the “face-to-face” and “combined” versions of the program to promote <b>active</b> <b>aging</b> in Mexican older adults trial. Methods: Seventy-six older adults aged 60  years and over participated in a quasi-experimental study and were recruited in a senior center to participate in the two experimental conditions: Vital Aging face-to-face (VA-FF) (n= 35) and Vital Aging combined (VA-C; multimedia/face-to-face) (n= 15), and the remaining 26 adults were assigned to a control group. Pretest and posttest assessments were performed after the theoretical–practical intervention. Mean differences and size effects were calculated for estimating the effect of the program. Results: At the end of the study, participants showed improvements in the <b>active</b> <b>aging</b> outcome measures. Positive effects were observed in the frequency of intellectual, cultural – artistic, and social activities, perceptions of aging, satisfaction with social relationships, and self-efficacy for aging. Additionally, those who participated in VA-FF showed better memory performance, meta-memory, and a trend to report less memory problems, while older persons in VA-C showed a trend to have better life satisfaction. No effects were observed in physical activity, frequency of social relationships, and subjective health. Conclusion: Findings show that the Vital Aging program in face-to-face and combined versions encourages <b>active</b> <b>aging</b> in Mexican older persons. These results are in general similar to those found in editions performed in Spain, revealing its consistency as a cross-cultural practical initiative for promoting <b>active</b> <b>aging.</b> Keywords: Vital <b>Aging,</b> <b>active</b> <b>aging,</b> intervention program, successful agin...|$|R

Little is known about <b>active</b> <b>aging</b> in older Thai adults, and there has been no development of scales to measure the expression of <b>active</b> <b>aging</b> attributes. Purpose: The aim of this study was to develop a culturally relevant composite scale of <b>active</b> <b>aging</b> for Thai adults (AAS-Thai) and to evaluate its reliability and validity. Methods: Eight steps of scale development were followed: 1) using focus groups and in-depth interviews, 2) gathering input from existing studies, 3) developing preliminary quantitative measures, 4) reviewing for content validity by an expert panel, 5) conducting cognitive interviews, 6) pilot testing, 7) performing a nationwide survey, and 8) testing psychometric properties. In a nationwide survey, 500 subjects were randomly recruited using a stratified sampling technique. Statistical analyses included exploratory factor analysis, item analysis, and measures of internal consistency, concurrent validity, and test–retest reliability. Results: Principal component factor analysis with varimax rotation resulted in a final 36 -item scale consisting of seven factors of active aging: 1) being self-reliant, 2) being actively engaged with society, 3) developing spiritual wisdom, 4) building up financial security, 5) maintaining a healthy lifestyle, 6) engaging in active learning, and 7) strengthening family ties to ensure care in later life. These factors explained 69 % of the total variance. Cronbach’s alpha coefficient for the overall AAS-Thai was 0. 95 and varied between 0. 81 and 0. 91 for the seven subscales. Concurrent validity and test–retest reliability were confirmed. Conclusion: The AAS-Thai demonstrated acceptable overall validity and reliability for measuring the multidimensional attributes of <b>active</b> <b>aging</b> in a Thai context.
