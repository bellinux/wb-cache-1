5|$|At this time, the {{existing}} infantry battalions of the Citizens Force were redesignated {{to perpetuate the}} numerical designations of the AIF, and although {{an attempt was made}} to allocate these designations based on regional considerations, ultimately this was not <b>always</b> <b>possible</b> and ultimately when the 3rd Division was re-established, only two of its component battalions—the 37th and 39th Battalions—had previously been assigned to the division.|$|E

5|$|In {{practical}} terms, horses {{prefer to}} eat {{small amounts of}} food steadily throughout the day, {{as they do in}} nature when grazing on pasture.

5|$|American {{alligators}} {{are capable}} of killing humans. Mistaken identity leading to an attack is <b>always</b> <b>possible,</b> especially in or near cloudy waters. American alligators are often less aggressive towards humans than larger crocodile species, a few of which (mainly the Nile and Saltwater crocodiles) may prey on humans with some regularity. American alligator bites are serious injuries due to the reptile's sheer bite force and risk of infection. Even with medical treatment, an American alligator bite may still result in a fatal infection.|$|E
5|$|In a {{laboratory}} experiment, the average lifespan {{for a male}} Campbell's dwarf hamster in captivity was 278 days and for a female was 356 days. In a different experiment, hamsters kept in captivity born in the summer lived {{for an average of}} 2.0–2.5 years. Young hamsters provided widely varied diets early in life are less likely to suffer digestive problems as they mature, but this is not <b>always</b> <b>possible</b> in the wild due to lack of food; this causes the life expectancy of captive hamsters to be greater than that of wild hamsters.|$|E
5|$|Stefan Kieniewicz, {{in a more}} {{critical}} treatment in the Polish Biographical Dictionary, notes {{that a lot of}} her exploits are poorly documented, and it is not <b>always</b> <b>possible</b> to separate legend from facts. He notes it is not certain she ever commanded any unit, and that her role as the commander of the 25th Regiment was more honorary than real; he also notes that she is known to have fainted on the battlefield, distracting her comrades, and in at least one instance (at the battle of Šiauliai), she was purposefully held behind front lines, as her comrades tried to ensure she would not endanger herself.|$|E

Companies could apply for OT work or could be conscripted. Companies failing to complete their work on time, which was <b>always</b> <b>possible</b> as the OT controlled the material and manpower of each firm, could find themselves closed down, or more likely fined, or taken over or merged with another firm to make a more efficient larger unit, successful firms however could make attractive profits.|$|E
5|$|The {{diagnosis}} of epilepsy is typically made based on {{observation of the}} seizure onset and the underlying cause. An electroencephalogram (EEG) to look for abnormal patterns of brain waves and neuroimaging (CT scan or MRI) {{to look at the}} structure of the brain are also usually part of the workup. While figuring out a specific epileptic syndrome is often attempted, it is not <b>always</b> <b>possible.</b> Video and EEG monitoring may be useful in difficult cases.|$|E

5|$|An arc diagram or linear {{embedding}} places vertices of a graph along a line, {{and draws}} {{the edges of}} the graph as semicircles either above or below this line, sometimes also allowing edges to be drawn on segments of the line. This drawing style corresponds to a book embedding with either one page (if all semicircles are above the line) or two pages (if both sides of the line are used), and was originally introduced as a way of studying the crossing numbers of graphs. Planar graphs that do not have two-page book embeddings may also be drawn in a similar way, by allowing their edges to be represented by multiple semicircles above and below the line. Such a drawing is not a book embedding by the usual definition, but has been called a topological book embedding. For every planar graph, it is <b>always</b> <b>possible</b> to find such an embedding in which each edge crosses the spine at most once.|$|E
5|$|Like most European nations the Scots in {{this period}} began to covert from the bow to {{gunpowder}} firearms. Handguns were present in Scottish armies in small numbers from the fifteenth century and there are increasingly frequent references to handguns and arquebus in records. An account of the Scottish vanguard at Haddon Rig in 1542 suggests that half the troops were missile men and half of those were arquebusiers. Equal proportions of missile to melee troops {{seems to have been}} an aim of Scottish commanders for most of the century, although it was not <b>always</b> <b>possible</b> in the field. The main source of firearms were the French, who seem to have extensively rearmed the Scottish after the English invasions of the Rough Wooing.|$|E
5|$|A {{recurring}} theme in these myths is {{the effort of}} the gods to maintain maat {{against the forces of}} disorder. They fight vicious battles with the forces of chaos at the start of creation. Ra and Apep, battling each other each night, continue this struggle into the present. Another prominent theme is the gods' death and revival. The clearest instance where a god dies is the myth of Osiris' murder, in which that god is resurrected as ruler of the Duat. The sun god is also said to grow old during his daily journey across the sky, sink into the Duat at night, and emerge as a young child at dawn. In the process he comes into contact with the rejuvenating water of Nun, the primordial chaos. Funerary texts that depict Ra's journey through the Duat also show the corpses of gods who are enlivened along with him. Instead of being changelessly immortal, the gods periodically died and were reborn by repeating the events of creation, thus renewing the whole world. But it was <b>always</b> <b>possible</b> for this cycle to be disrupted and for chaos to return. Some poorly understood Egyptian texts even suggest that this calamity is destined to happen—that the creator god will one day dissolve the order of the world, leaving only himself and Osiris amid the primordial chaos.|$|E
