40|$|OBJECTIVE: This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to model the}} sequence of events that occurs after amnioreduction, laser therapy, and digoxin administration in twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) with and without <b>a</b> hydropic <b>recipient</b> twin. STUDY DESIGN: We added amnioreduction, laser therapy, and digoxin administration to our mathematical TTTS model and simulated combinations of these therapies. RESULTS: With <b>a</b> nonhydropic <b>recipient,</b> simulated amnioreduction delays the onset of hydrops. Conversely, with <b>a</b> hydropic <b>recipient,</b> amnioreduction aggravates the degree of hydrops. Furthermore, amnioreduction increases the transplacental fluid flow and may temporarily cause a hydropic donor. Laser therapy terminates the cause of recipient hydrops. Digoxin reduces the degree of recipient hydrops, but increases arteriovenous fetofetal transfusion. CONCLUSION: Laser therapy is superior in TTTS with <b>a</b> hydropic <b>recipient,</b> because simulated amnioreduction aggravates the recipient's cardiovascular status. Digoxin benefits <b>a</b> hydropic <b>recipient</b> but slightly worsens the donor's condition. Therefore, TTTS presenting with <b>a</b> hydropic <b>recipient</b> prior to fetal viability (approximately 26 weeks) may be best treated with laser therapy, whereas more advanced gestations may be offered digoxin administration plus amnioreduction, to delay the progression of TTT...|$|R
