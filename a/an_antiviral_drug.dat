25|$|All medical {{applications}} known so far involve not pure adamantane, but its derivatives. The first adamantane derivative {{used as a}} drug was amantadine – first (1967) as <b>an</b> <b>antiviral</b> <b>drug</b> against various strains of flu and then to treat Parkinson's disease. Other drugs among adamantane derivatives include adapalene, adapromine, amantadine, bromantane, carmantadine, chlodantane, dopamantine, memantine, rimantadine, saxagliptin, tromantadine, and vildagliptin. Polymers of adamantane have been patented as antiviral agents against HIV.|$|E
25|$|JK-05 is <b>an</b> <b>antiviral</b> <b>drug</b> {{developed}} by Sihuan Pharmaceutical along with Academy of Military Medical Sciences. In tests on mice, JK-05 shows efficacy against {{a range of}} viruses, including Ebola. It is claimed to have a simple molecular structure, which should be readily amenable to synthesis scale-up for mass production. The drug has been given preliminary approval by the Chinese authorities to be available for Chinese health workers involved in combating the outbreak, and Sihuan are preparing to conduct clinical trials in West Africa.|$|E

5000|$|An {{alternative}} way {{to treat}} viral infections would be antiviral drugs in which the drug blocks the virus's replication cycle.

50|$|In {{one of the}} {{original}} studies, a small molecule was shown to inhibit Ebola virus infection by preventing the virus glycoprotein from binding to NPC1. In the other study, mice that were heterozygous for NPC1 were shown to be protected from lethal challenge with mouse-adapted Ebola virus.

40|$|Despite the {{enormous}} disease burden associated with dengue virus infections, <b>a</b> licensed <b>antiviral</b> <b>drug</b> is lacking. Here, {{we show that}} the paracetamol (acetaminophen) metabolite AM 404 inhibits dengue virus replication. Moreover, we find that mutations in NS 4 B that were previously found to confer resistance to the antiviral compounds NITD- 618 and SDM 25 N also render dengue virus insensitive to AM 404. Our work provides further support for NS 4 B as a direct or indirect target for <b>antiviral</b> <b>drug</b> development...|$|R
40|$|Standard {{methods of}} virus {{diagnosis}} may take many days to complete. <b>As</b> <b>antiviral</b> <b>drugs</b> {{are being used}} with more effectiveness, it becomes more important to develop rapid diagnostic methods. It takes {{only a few minutes}} to prepare and examine a specimen for electron microscopy (EM), using the negative staining technique. Viruses in the specimen can readily be identified by their morphology. In order to be detected by EM there must be at least 10 (7) virus particles per milliliter of sample. This concentration is frequently found in certain types of specimens. The sensitivity of EM is increased 100 -fold if homologous antibody is used to aggregate the virus. Visualization of virus-antibody aggregates forms the basis for serotyping by immunoelectron microscopy (IEM) ...|$|R

50|$|A virucide (pronounced /ˈvī-rə-ˌsīd/ and {{alternatively}} spelled viricide and viruscide) is an agent (physical or chemical) that deactivates or destroys viruses. This differs from <b>an</b> <b>antiviral</b> <b>drug,</b> which inhibits {{the development of}} the virus.|$|E
