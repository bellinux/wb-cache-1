5000|$|Omega-agatoxin: {{in general}} type IA and type IIA affect the calcium {{channels}} of insects, while type IIIA and IVA affect the calcium channels in vertebrates. There {{are two major}} groups within the voltage <b>activated</b> calcium channels; the high voltage <b>activated</b> calcium channel and the low voltage <b>activated</b> calcium channel. [...] The low <b>activated</b> calcium channels are <b>activated</b> by a smaller depolarisation and they show a rapid voltage-dependent inactivation. High voltage <b>activated</b> channels are <b>activated</b> by a large depolarisation and inactivate more slowly. ω-agatoxin only blocks the P/Q type calcium channels which are a voltage <b>activated.</b>|$|R

5|$|Heparin-induced {{thrombocytopenia}} (HIT) is {{the development}} of thrombocytopenia (a low platelet count), due to the administration of various forms of heparin, an anticoagulant. HIT predisposes to thrombosis (the abnormal formation of blood clots inside a blood vessel) because platelets release microparticles that <b>activate</b> thrombin, thereby leading to thrombosis. When thrombosis is identified the condition is called heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis (HITT). HIT is caused by the formation of abnormal antibodies that <b>activate</b> platelets. If someone receiving heparin develops new or worsening thrombosis, or if the platelet count falls, HIT can be confirmed with specific blood tests.|$|E
5|$|Just like glucocorticoids, SEGRAMs bind to and <b>activate</b> GR. However, in {{contrast}} to glucocorticoids, SEGRAMs selectively <b>activate</b> the GR {{in such a way}} that they yield an improved therapeutic benefit. Generally, for specific inflammation-based diseases, SEGRAMs should more strongly transrepress than transactivate, or better yet solely transrepress and fail to transactivate. This type of selective GR activation should result in fewer side effects than the expected side effects that appear with a chronic treatment with classic glucocorticoids.|$|E

40|$|In {{this study}} {{impregnated}} almond shell <b>activated</b> carbon by Zn° and ZnSO 4 {{were used as}} adsorbent with a particle size of 10 - 20 mesh. The objective {{of this research was}} to determine the ability of impregnated <b>activated</b> carbon in nitrate removal. The modified <b>activated</b> carbon had 1 mm effective size, with a uniformity coefficient of 1. 18. Potassium nitrate solution was used in batch adsorption experiments for nitrate removal from water. The effects of nitrate concentration, <b>activated</b> carbon dosage and time of contact were studied. Experimental data showed that modified <b>activated</b> carbon by Zn° and ZnSO 4 was more effective than virgin almond <b>activated</b> carbon for nitrate removal. The maximum nitrate removal was 64 %- 80 % and 5 %- 42 % for modified <b>activated</b> carbon and virgin <b>activated</b> carbon, respectively. While virgin <b>activated</b> carbon used, nitrate-N decreased from 20 to 15 mg/L in 30 min reaction. The final nitrate concentration was not in the standard range of WHO recommendations for water quality; while impregnated <b>activated</b> carbons were used, nitrate drcreased to < 10 mg/L. Maximum removal was over 16 - 17 mg nitrate-N per 1 g <b>activated</b> carbon for impregnated <b>activated</b> carbon. The experiments were conducted at pH= 6. 2, 20 ºC and initial concentrations of 20 mg/L nitrate-N. Increase in modified <b>activated</b> carbon dosage increased the nitrate removal efficiency.

40|$|Nerve {{growth factor}} stimulated axonal {{outgrowth}} from explanted mouse {{dorsal root ganglia}} is dependent on mitogen <b>activated</b> protein kinase. PD 98059 ([2 -(2 'amino- 3 '-methoxyphenyl) -oxanaphthalen- 4 -one]) blocks mitogen <b>activated</b> protein kinase by inhibiting its immediate upstream activator, mitogen <b>activated</b> protein kinase kinase (also known as MEK). Here we used PD 98059 to study the role of mitogen <b>activated</b> protein kinase in the axonal outgrowth of adult dorsal root ganglia explants. Whereas PD 98059 at 50 μM left spontaneous axonal outgrowth unaffected, it markedly inhibited nerve growth factor stimulated axon growth when assessed after two days in culture. A mitogen <b>activated</b> protein kinase assay and immunoblotting using antibodies discriminating between <b>activated</b> and inactivated kinase, both confirmed that PD 98059 reduced the amount of <b>activated</b> enzyme in nerve growth factor stimulated preparations, while the total amounts of the kinase remained unchanged. Immunohistochemistry revealed the presence of neuronal mitogen <b>activated</b> protein kinase kinase and mitogen <b>activated</b> protein kinase itself.
