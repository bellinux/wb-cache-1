40|$|Background. Data on {{effectiveness}} of preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for {{human immunodeficiency virus}} (HIV) –uninfected women attempting conception with HIV-infected male partners are limited to observational studies. Methods. To explore the benefits of PrEP for conception, we developed a model to estimate the <b>average</b> <b>annual</b> <b>probability</b> of a woman remaining HIV-uninfected and having a child (“successful ” outcome) via condomless sex with an HIV-infected male. The outcome likelihood is dependent upon parameters defining HIV- 1 infectivity. We simulated 2 scenarios: optimal (condomless sex acts limited to the ovulation window), and suboptimal (acts not limited to ovulation). Results. In the optimal scenario when the male is on antiretroviral therapy (ART), the <b>average</b> <b>annual</b> <b>probability</b> of the successful outcome is 29. 1 %, increasing to 29. 2 % {{with the addition of}} PrEP (P =. 45). In the suboptimal sce-nario, the probability is 26. 8 % with ART alone versus 27. 3 % with ART/PrEP (P <. 0001). Older maternal age reduces the probability of success in both scenarios, particularly after age 30. Conclusions. In our model, PrEP provides little added benefit when the HIV-infected male partner is on ART, condomless sex is limited to the ovulation window, and other modifiable transmission risks are optimized. Older female age decreases the probability of success by increasing the number of condomless sex acts required for conception...|$|E
30|$|The reduced form {{parameters}} {{give the}} <b>average</b> <b>annual</b> <b>probability</b> of employment growth {{relative to the}} reference firm which is a nonEPZ firm with 14 employees in year t. Smaller EPZ firms are 9 percentage points more likely to add workers than the reference firm. In contrast, smaller nonEPZ firms are nearly 17 percentage points less likely to add workers than a reference firm! Therefore, the differential incentives to add workers {{inside and outside the}} EPZ clearly limit growth for firms well below the threshold. As indicated in the theory section, {{there is no reason to}} believe that the constrained optimal employment level for a firm facing a substantial added cost of employing 15 workers would be 14 workers. This finding suggests that potential TEWA costs result in substantially lower firm size in the nonEPZ sector, even for firms well below the 14 firm threshold.|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} the bushfire (wildland fire) {{risk to the}} built environment in Australia. The most salient {{result is that the}} annual probability of building destruction has remained almost constant over the last century despite large demographic and social changes as well as improvements in fire fighting technique and resources. Most historical losses have taken place in a few extreme fires which if repeated are likely to overwhelm even the most professional of fire services. We also calculate the <b>average</b> <b>annual</b> <b>probability</b> of a random home on the urban–bushland interface being destroyed by a bushfire to be of the order of 1 in 6500, a factor 6. 5 times lower than the ignition probability of a structural house fire. Thus on average and if this risk was perceived rationally, the incentive for individual homeowners to mitigate and reduce the bushfire danger even further is low. This being the case and despite predictions of an increasing likelihood of conditions favouring bushfires under global climate change, we suspect that building losses due to bushfires are unlikely to alter materially in the near future. 4 page(s...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} study, a new method for {{evaluating}} <b>annual</b> liquefaction <b>probability</b> was developed based on both Davies and Berrill’s seismic energy dissipation theory and Juang et al. ’s limit state methodology. The new method also involves {{use of the}} <b>average</b> <b>annual</b> liquefaction <b>probability</b> (AALP) of divided soil layers to represent the AALP at a site. The developed method is illustrated in a case study where the AALP in Yunlin, a town that suffered from widespread liquefaction in the 1999 Chi-Chi earthquake, is assessed and mapped. The results show that high AALP area is located between south of County road No. 148 and west of County road No. 137, where the AALP is approximately equal to 0. 01, indicating the cycle of liquefaction is about 100 years. The distribution of liquefaction probability is also discussed in this paper...|$|R
40|$|We {{examined}} climate-caused spatio-temporal {{variation of}} forest fire ignition probability in Finland based on empirical ignition experiments and 37 years of meteorological data from 26 meteorological stations scattered across Finland. First, meteorological data {{was used in}} order to estimate the variation in forest fuel moisture content with {{the model of the}} Finnish forest fire risk index. Second, based on data from empirical ignition experi-ments, fuel moisture content was linked with forest fire ignition probability. In southern Finland average forest fire ignition probability typically peaks in late May and early June, whereas {{in the northern part of}} the country the peak occurs at the end of June. There was a three-fold difference in the <b>average</b> <b>annual</b> ignition <b>probability</b> between the north-eastern part (3 %) and south-western part of the country (9 %). The observed differences in fire ignition probability suggest that the characteristics of the natural fire regime also vary considerably in the southern versus the northern part of the country...|$|R
50|$|Reproductive {{success of}} western tanagers varies widely between studies and across years. An <b>average</b> <b>annual</b> nest success <b>probability</b> {{estimate}} is 0.186 over 3 years, {{with a low}} of 0.035 and a high of 0.349. In a northern Arizona study area, an average of 43% (n=7) of nests succeeded to the nestling stage. In Boulder County, nesting success varied from 11.3% to 75.3%, {{with an average of}} 51.8% over a 3-year period. Daily nest survival rate on ungrazed sites in northeastern New Mexico was 0.955, which was not significantly (p<0.05) different from the 0.973 daily nest survival rate found on grazed sites. Nest predation {{is the leading cause of}} nest failure. Predation rates ranged from 30% (n=48) in a study in New Mexico pinyon-juniper woodland to 86% (n=14) in a mixed-conifer forest in Idaho.|$|R
40|$|The {{survivorship}} oftotal hip replacements {{in patients}} operated {{on at the}} Royal National Orthopaedlc Hospital has been analysed using standard actuarial methods. Between 1 % 3 and 1972 173 metal-on-metal prostheses of various developmental designs were inserted. Between 1969 and 1972 248 prostheses of one design using a metal femoral component and plastic cup were used. The patients were surveyed retrospectively and for each the actual follow-up period was determined {{as well as the}} eventual outcome. The criterion of “survival ” was that the prosthesis was still in situ and all such prostheses were regarded as “survivors”, regardless of whether the patients experienced pain or loss offunction. The survivorship was then determined by constructing life tables. The results indicate that for metal-on-metal prostheses the overall probability ofsurvival was only 53 per cent after 11 years and the <b>average</b> <b>annual</b> <b>probability</b> of removal, irrespective of cause, was 5. 5 per cent. The results were better for metal-on-plastic prostheses with figures of 88 per cent after eight years and 1. 5 per cent respectively. For both prostheses the predominant reason for failure was loosening and the annual rate of removal for loosening Increased as the follow-up time increased, suggesting that loosening was a wearing out process. The advantages ofthe survivorship method ofanalysis as compared with conventional methods are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Rain rate {{near the}} ground can be {{interpreted}} as a collection of random variables forming a random field parameterised by three co-ordinates: two spatial co-ordinates and one temporal. Interest among the radio propagation community has been focused on the first order statistics of these random variables, principally on the <b>average</b> <b>annual</b> <b>probability</b> distribution of rain rate as a function of location. However, increasingly interest is turning to second order statistics describing high-resolution rain rate variation in both time and space. This information is important for the design of fade countermeasures and for efficient spectrum management. In this paper radar data from a wide spread, slow moving and intense, convective rain event experienced by the South Eastern UK on 1 / 5 / 2001 are used to calculate the second order statistics of spatial-temporal log rain rate variation. It is demonstrated that log rain rate is self-similar in all three co-ordinates and that symmetry exists between the spatial and temporal variation. These data are used to develop an isotropic, spatial-temporal log rain rate model assuming that log rain rate is a homogeneous Gaussian random field. This model is developed further to yield closed form expressions for the second order statistics of the associated rain rate, specific attenuation and log specific attenuation random fields. Furthermore, expressions for the temporal covariance of the rain attenuation experienced by pairs of radio links are developed and these expressions are tested against measured rain attenuation data from an experimental link...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background HIV {{prevention}} in India {{has mostly}} focussed on heterosexual transmission. Data on homosexual transmission are {{not readily available}} from India. We therefore assessed the probability of acquiring and transmitting HIV for men who sell sex to men and compared this with women who sell sex in India. Methods Sexual behaviour characteristics of 6661 {{men who have sex}} with men and 6648 women who sell sex were obtained in the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh through confidential interviews. These, along with estimates of HIV rates among them and risk of HIV transmission per unprotected sex act from other sources, were used to calculate their annual probability of acquiring and transmitting HIV. Results Of 6661 {{men who have sex with}} men in this sample, 1776 (26. 7 %) had sold sex to men. For every 1000 men who sell sex to men, annually 146 (95 % confidence interval [CI] 116 – 179) would acquire HIV and HIV would be transmitted to 55 (95 % CI 42 – 71) men who do not sell sex or women. These estimates were higher by 6. 7 (95 % CI 4. 9 – 9. 2) times for acquiring HIV and 2. 5 (95 % CI 2. 0 – 3. 2) times for transmitting HIV to sex partners outside their group, as compared with similar estimates for women who sell sex. In this sample, the <b>average</b> <b>annual</b> <b>probability</b> of acquiring HIV was higher among men who have sex with men but do not sell sex as compared with women who sell sex. Conclusion These data indicate that men who sell sex to men are at much higher risk of acquiring and transmitting HIV than women who sell sex. Therefore, men who sell sex to men and their clients warrant substantial attention for comprehensive HIV prevention in India. </p...|$|E
40|$|We studied {{survival}} and cause-specific mortality of radio-marked capercaillie Tetrao urogallus females relative to habitat type in northern Sweden during 2000 - 2004. Our high-mountain area (1, 600 km 2) {{consisted of the}} alpine transition zone from Norway spruce Picea abies-dominated forest,mountain birch Betula pubescens and alpine heath. Our low-mountain areas consisted of two forest areas (300 and 160 km 2) dominated by Scots pine Pinus sylvestris and characterised by more intensive forestry than the first-mentioned area. Predation {{was the most common}} cause of mortality in both the highmountain (70 %) and low-mountain (90 %) areas. We attributed 10 % of mortality in both areas to hunting. Collisions with cars and power lines were only documented in the high-mountain area. A Cox-proportional regression model stratified by year suggested that hazard was lower for yearlings and birds using low-mountain areas, but these estimates were associated with large uncertainties. Pooling all individuals showed an <b>average</b> <b>annual</b> survival <b>probability</b> of 0. 68 (0. 62 - 0. 75; 95 %CI), with no tendency for hazard to vary among seasons. Because survival of females was comparable to those reported in other studies and the harvest mortality was low, we suggest that the capercaillie population in the Swedish high-mountain region does not need any changes in the present management strategy...|$|R
40|$|Banks {{using either}} the Foundation or Advanced option of the Internal Ratings Based {{approach}} to credit risk under Basel II must estimate long-run <b>annual</b> <b>average</b> default <b>probabilities</b> for buckets of homogeneous assets. The one-factor model underlying the capital calculations in Basel II {{has implications for}} the distribution of average (across assets) default rates over time. One of these implications is that the average default rate in any period is probably smaller than the overall average default rate (over time and assets). The lesson for practioners is that the short-term default experience of new, very safe assets is likely to underpredict the true long-run default rate for these assets. ...|$|R
40|$|Identifying {{individuals}} {{through time}} can {{provide information on}} population size, composition, survival and growth rates. Identification using photographs of distinctive physical characteristics {{has been used in}} many species to replace conventional marker tagging. We evaluated photographic records over 7 years of Vulnerable whale sharks Rhincodon typus, at an aggregation in the Seychelles, for estimation of population size and structure. We collected 11, 681 photographs of which only 1, 149 were suitable for comparison using semi-automated matching software (I³S) of individual spot patterns behind the gills. Photo-identification showed that there was considerable loss of marker tags and enabled an estimation of the rate of tag loss. The combination of photo-identification with marker tagging identified a total of 512 individual sharks over 2001 – 2007. Of these, there were 115 resightings in subsequent years with two sharks identified in 2001 resighted 5 years later in 2006 and another shark sighted in 2001 resighted in 2007. Estimates of abundance using conventional open mark–recapture models for 2004 – 2007 were 348 – 488 sharks (95 % confidence interval), {{with a high level of}} entry into the population by itinerants. <b>Annual</b> apparent survival <b>probability</b> was 0. 343 – 0. 781 over 2004 – 2007, with an <b>average</b> <b>annual</b> recapture <b>probability</b> of 0. 201.

40|$|At Rothera Research Station (67. 3 °S, 68. 1 °W), Antarctica, 296 h {{of day and}} {{nighttime}} Fe-Boltzmann temperature lidar {{data were}} accumulated in 2003. During this time, sporadic iron layers (FeS) were observed with an <b>annual</b> <b>average</b> occurrence <b>probability</b> of 14 %. The peak altitude of the FeS layers was highest during the summer, with a fitted value of 103 km while during the winter the layer decreased in height to 90 km with an <b>annual</b> <b>average</b> of 97 km. The atmospheric temperature perturbations and potential energy density profiles computed from the same lidar data exhibited increased temperature but constant-with-height potential energy density when sporadic Fe layer occurred. Once sporadic Fe layers disappeared, the potential energy density decreased with height, indicating an energy loss due to atmospheric gravity wave breaking. These results suggest a link between FeS and atmospheric dynamics...|$|R
40|$|Long-distance {{migrants}} wintering {{in tropical}} regions face {{a number of}} critical conservation threats throughout their lives, but seasonal estimates of key demographic parameters such as winter survival are rare. Using mist-netting-based mark-recapture data collected in coastal Costa Rica over a six-year period, we examined variation in within- and between-winter survivorship of the Prothonotary Warbler (Protonotaria citrea; 753 young and 376 adults banded), a declining neotropical habitat specialist that depends on threatened mangrove forests during the nonbreeding season. We derived parallel seasonal survivorship estimates for the Northern Waterthrush (Seiurus noveboracensis; 564 young and 93 adults banded), a cohabitant mangrove specialist that has not shown the same population decline in North America, to assess whether contrasting survivorship might contribute to the observed differences in the species' population trajectories. Although <b>average</b> <b>annual</b> survival <b>probability</b> was relatively similar between the two species for both young and adult birds, monthly estimates indicated that relative to Northern Waterthrush, Prothonotary Warblers exhibited: greater interannual variation in survivorship, especially within winters; greater variation in survivorship among the three study sites; lower average between-winter survivorship, particularly among females, and; {{a sharp decline in}} between-winter survivorship from 2003 to 2009 for both age groups and both sexes. Rather than identifying one seasonal vital rate as a causal factor of Prothonotary Warbler population declines, our species comparison suggests that the combination of variable within-winter survival with decreasing between-winter survival demands a multi-seasonal approach to the conservation of this and other tropical-wintering migrants...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Considering the {{uncertainties}} in structural capacities and seismic motions, a probabilistic-based seismic risk analysis approach for bridges is proposed in this paper. In this approach, the Total Probability Theory (TPT) {{is used to}} divide seismic risk analysis into three main steps: seismic hazard analysis; structure damage analysis; and failure probability analysis. The parameters of seismic risk analysis {{are assumed to be}} an independent and discrete Markov process, resulting in rigorous and consistent seismic risk functions for calculating the <b>annual</b> <b>average</b> <b>probability</b> of exceeding a designated limit state of structure under a specific level of seismic intensity. A case study of seismic risk analysis was performed on a three-span continuous rigid-frame bridge. The results show that the approach presented in the paper is applicable for the seismic risk analysis of bridge structures, and is an effective tool to assess the performance of bridge structures under earthquake actions...|$|R

40|$|Individual-based data {{on little}} terns Sterna albifrons at a post-breeding {{moulting}} area {{were used to}} investigate the spatial extent at which this site attract birds. Combining information collected on young terns, ringed at the natal colonies, with that on birds captured {{a few months later}} at the moulting site, we estimated a survival/movement parameter for each age-by-colony combination. This parameter is the product between the survival probability and the probability to visit the moulting site. The distance between the natal colony and the moulting site negatively influenced the probability of reaching the site in yearlings. Having corrected for the distance from the moulting area, colony characteristics explained only about 10 % of the spatial variation in the survival/ movement parameter of juveniles. In older birds that had visited the site at least once in their life, neither the colony nor the distance affected the survival/movement parameter significantly. The <b>average</b> <b>annual</b> adult survival/movement <b>probability</b> was 0. 90. Juvenile survival between June and September was 0. 60. Overall results suggest that the moulting area could act as a 'population funnel' within a system of moult migration that involves birds breeding up to 500 km away. However, other unknown moulting site must exist within this area that could be important for the conservation of the species. © Journal of Avian Biology. Peer Reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{contributes}} in {{a quantitative}} manner {{to the debate}} on macroprudential policy in three ways. First, it illustrates how macroprudential surveillance could have been better undertaken with a highly stable crisis-prediction model for 14 OECD countries estimated over 1980 - 1997. Second, in terms of macroprudential regulation, it uses the related estimates to calibrate the increase in capital and liquidity needed to reduce average crisis probabilities to a desired level, as is being discussed in Basel. We show that an international consensus on regulatory changes will generate “winners ” and “losers ” in terms of capital and liquidity adjustments, and we suggest that raising capital and liquidity standards by 3. 7 percentage points across the board will reduce the <b>annual</b> <b>average</b> <b>probability</b> of a financial crisis to around 1 %. Finally, we show that countercyclical macroprudential policy is best calibrated on house prices and current accounts rather than GDP and credit, as are widely recommended at present. Credit growth, for example, has neither a direct nor an indirect statistical impact on crisis risk. Our results {{have important implications for}} the next generation of international banking regulations...|$|R
