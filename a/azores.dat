Preliminary data from the northern Atlantic coast seem to support the <b>Azores</b> High hypothesis. A 3000-year proxy record from a coastal lake in Cape Cod suggests that hurricane activity increased significantly during the past 500–1000 years, just as the Gulf coast was amid a quiescent period of the last millennium.|$|E

5|$|After {{aftershocks}} {{from the}} quake had concluded, examination took place, producing a focal {{solution to the}} small events. Movement of these shocks {{was similar to that}} of previous earthquakes around the <b>Azores.</b> For these earthquakes, scientists had determined that the conjugate nodal plane was responsible, seeing shearing on the right-lateral (dextral) side. All faulting in this area is strike-slip-oriented, and on a rather large scale. Because of this research, information now points towards <b>Azores</b> volcanism being controlled by earthquake movement.|$|E

5|$|By 1500UTC on September 27, the National Hurricane Center {{declared}} Bonnie extratropical, {{since it}} was losing tropical characteristics. Bonnie re-acquired tropical characteristics, and the National Hurricane Center resumed advisories on the storm by 2100UTC on September 28. However, post-analysis indicated that Bonnie remained tropical during that time period. Bonnie re-strengthened to a strong tropical storm before vertical wind shear weakened it while approaching the <b>Azores.</b> Shortly before becoming extratropical on September 30, Bonnie passed through the <b>Azores</b> as a moderately weak tropical storm. One location in the <b>Azores</b> reported tropical storm force winds. In addition, one man {{was killed by a}} rock fall on the island of São Miguel. No damage was reported in association with Bonnie.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Bonnie was a {{long-lived}} {{storm in}} the 1992 Atlantic hurricane season. It {{was the third}} tropical storm (including the April subtropical storm) and second hurricane of the 1992 season. Bonnie formed at high latitudes in the central Atlantic on September 17. Devoid of any real steering currents for much of its lifespan, it was nearly stationary for over {{a week in the}} central Atlantic Ocean. On September 27, it began to slowly track east and northeast towards the <b>Azores.</b> Just before becoming extratropical, it affected the <b>Azores</b> on September 30, although no damage was reported.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Tanya was not {{considered}} a threat to land, as it did not move through the <b>Azores</b> while a tropical cyclone. The <b>Azores</b> were hit very hard by the storm, which had just been declared extratropical when it hit the region. Damage was particularly severe on the islands of Faial, Pico, Terceira and São Jorge. Extensive property damage was reported, including many sunk boats, many houses were damaged and some destroyed and significant agricultural damage. Many trees and power lines were also knocked down, cutting electricity and hampering communications in the area. The highest wind gusts reported in the <b>Azores</b> were around 105mph (170km/h). After the storm, a resolution was submitted to the European Parliament by the Government of Portugal and a disaster area was declared in the islands. One Spanish fisherman drowned and several people were injured.|$|E
5|$|In 1950, another strong {{earthquake}} had {{rocked the}} <b>Azores</b> Islands region, {{and this was}} the largest earthquake since.|$|E
5|$|Intermittent deep {{convection}} {{continued to}} fire up, keeping the storm afloat {{for the next}} day and turning it away from the <b>Azores.</b> Danielle also changed direction and meandered slightly to the northwest, away from the <b>Azores,</b> due to very weak steering currents. After holding on as a minimal tropical storm, Danielle finally lost its deep convection due to high upper-level vertical shear and was downgraded to a tropical depression on the afternoon of August 20. The depression turned once again to the north, and continued to lose organization over cooler water. It degenerated into a remnant low on the afternoon of August 21 as the convection was completely sheared away from the center of Danielle. The remnant low remained in the open ocean, remaining devoid of any deep convection, until August 24 when it dissipated west-southwest of the <b>Azores.</b>|$|E
5|$|Low, Harris {{and their}} ships left the <b>Azores</b> for the Carolinas. On 10 June 1723, they {{suffered}} a resounding defeat {{in a battle}} with , a heavily armed man of war. Greyhound had been dispatched {{under the command of}} Peter Solgard to hunt down Low and his fleet. Low fled in the Fancy with a skeleton crew and £150,000 in gold on board and headed back to the <b>Azores,</b> leaving Harris and the Ranger behind.|$|E

5|$|The 2005 <b>Azores</b> {{subtropical}} {{storm was}} the 19th nameable storm of the record-breaking 2005 Atlantic hurricane season. It was not officially {{named by the}} US National Hurricane Center as it was operationally classified as a non-tropical low. The storm developed in the eastern Atlantic Ocean out of a low-pressure area that gained subtropical characteristics on October4. The storm was short-lived, crossing over the <b>Azores</b> later on October4 before becoming extratropical again on October5. Neither damages nor fatalities were reported during that time. After being absorbed into a cold front, the system {{went on to become}} Hurricane Vince, which affected the Iberian Peninsula.|$|E
5|$|The {{subspecies}} Semicassis granulata undulata {{occurs in}} the Mediterranean Sea, {{and parts of the}} North Atlantic Ocean, including Portugal and the <b>Azores.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{weakening}} trend ended {{early on}} September26 and Bonnie regained tropical storm status that afternoon as deep convection re-established itself. Bonnie continued its change in direction, {{turning to the}} southeast at this point as it slowly redeveloped despite being in a high-shear environment. It had also briefly showed signs of becoming extratropical on September27 as it made the turn to the northeast as a weak tropical storm, and was operationally declared extratropical at that point until the afternoon of September28. During that period, Bonnie actually strengthened back into a high-end tropical storm. Bonnie roughly followed Hurricane Charley's path towards the <b>Azores</b> thereafter. The storm became entrenched in an environment with greater wind shear, although it only weakened slightly on September29 as it accelerated towards the northeast. The storm crossed over the <b>Azores</b> on September30 as a strong tropical storm with 65mph (100km/h) winds. After that, Bonnie quickly lost its tropical characteristics and was declared extratropical late that afternoon, {{just east of the}} <b>Azores.</b> The extratropical low drifted back to the southwest in a clockwise loop, actually approaching the <b>Azores</b> once again while dissipating. It dissipated on October2.|$|E
5|$|Thereafter, Charley turned eastward {{and then}} east-northeastward while {{tracking}} over decreasing sea surface temperatures (SST's). Early on September 27, Charley was downgraded to a tropical storm. Later that day, Charley crossed over Terceira Island in the <b>Azores</b> with winds of 65mph (100km/h). Charley gradually lost tropical characteristics, and by 1800UTC on September 27, it had transitioned into an extratropical storm. The remnant system accelerated northeastward toward the British Isles, where it merged with another extratropical low on September 29. While {{passing through the}} <b>Azores,</b> Charley produced tropical storm force winds, with the Lajes AFB reporting sustained winds of 53mph (85km/h) and gusts reaching 82mph (132km/h). No other effects from Charley were reported in the <b>Azores.</b>|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Delta {{formed with}} tropical-storm-force winds on November 23, when a strong non-tropical low near the <b>Azores</b> slowly drifted southward and {{attained}} tropical characteristics while entering increasingly warmer waters.|$|E
5|$|Tropical cyclone {{warnings}} and watches were issued on two separate occasions as Nadine approached the <b>Azores.</b> At 1000UTC on September18, {{a tropical storm}} watch was issued for the islands of Flores and Corvo. Although the tropical storm watch was discontinued at 2100UTC, a tropical storm warning was implemented at that time for the islands of Corvo, Faial, Flores, Graciosa, Pico, São Jorge, and Terceira. At 1500UTC on September19, a tropical storm warning was also issued for São Miguel and Santa Maria. All watches and warnings were discontinued by late on September21. After re-generating, Nadine posed {{a threat to the}} <b>Azores</b> again, and thus, a tropical storm watch was issued for the entire archipelago at 1500UTC on October1. Nine hours later, 0000UTC on the following day, the watch was upgraded to a tropical storm warning. After Nadine became extratropical, the warning was discontinued. On the storm's second approach toward the <b>Azores,</b> schools were closed and flight were cancelled.|$|E
5|$|U-43 was sunk on 30 July 1943 {{southwest}} of the <b>Azores</b> by a torpedo dropped by a United States Navy aircraft; all 55 hands were lost.|$|E

5|$|A Category1 {{hurricane}} {{was first}} observed about 585mi (940km) west-northwest of Corvo Island in the <b>Azores</b> on August5, based on reports from two ships, the Shelter and the A.Z.Greenland. Another ship that encountered the storm, the Magistrate, was abandoned.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} storm {{was present in}} the east-central Atlantic on October17. It moved northwestward at first before turning to the northeast on October19, when it was already a small, compact tropical cyclone. The storm steadily intensified as it tracked toward the <b>Azores,</b> and it reached a peak intensity of 70mph (110km/h) on October21. Maintaining its peak strength for 30hours, the storm began a steady weakening trend before crossing through the southern <b>Azores.</b> It turned to the southeast, weakening to tropical depression status on October24. Subsequently, the system turned {{to the south and}} quickly dissipated. This {{tropical storm}} {{was not included in the}} Monthly Weather Reviews summary of the 1950 hurricane season, and it was added to the Atlantic hurricane database in 1959.|$|E
5|$|After {{maintaining}} a nearly steady course for three days, Hurricane Debbie turned northward and slowed as it neared {{a break in}} the ridge previously steering it west-northwestward. During the evening of September 11, a United States Navy Aircraft reconnaissance mission into the storm found sustained winds of 110 – 120 mph (175 – 195 km/h) and a central pressure of 976 mbar (hPa; 28.82 inHg), reaching its peak intensity as a modern-day Category 3 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane scale with winds of 120 mph (195 km/h). After maintaining its windspeeds for over 24 hours, the system weakened and turned sharply towards the east-northeast in response to the upper-level westerlies. By the afternoon of September 13, Debbie was again a Category 1 storm as it quickly accelerated towards the <b>Azores.</b> Early on September 15, the storm passed over the easternmost <b>Azores</b> with winds estimated at 80 mph (130 km/h) before turning more northeasterly. Once past the <b>Azores,</b> there is an uncertainty over the structural changes that took place with Debbie. According to the United States Weather Bureau's preliminary report, the system acquired characteristics of an extratropical cyclone on September 15, though remained a strong system. This conflicts with the best track supplied by the Bureau and the National Hurricane Center's hurricane database maintains the system as a tropical cyclone until the afternoon of September 16.|$|E
5|$|An upper-level tropospheric trough {{persisted in}} the eastern Atlantic Ocean, {{developing}} a circulation by October 26 which quickly organized. On October 27, it developed into Tropical Depression Fourteen about 860miles (1380kilometers) south-southwest of the western <b>Azores.</b> Moving westward, the depression was forecast to attain winds of at least 60mph (95km/h), although it failed to reach that intensity. Banding features developed over the storm, and on October 30 it was upgraded to Tropical Storm Lorenzo. By early on October 31, convection had begun to separate from the circulation, {{and later in the}} day Lorenzo became extratropical; shortly thereafter, its remnants merged with a frontal system about 690mi (1,110km) west of the <b>Azores.</b>|$|E
5|$|Around {{the same}} time, the {{depression}} turned northeast into a warm sector ahead of an oncoming cold front, and strengthened into a subtropical storm. The system continued to track northeast and strengthened slightly, reaching its peak intensity of 50mph (85km/h) as it approached the <b>Azores</b> that evening. After tracking through the <b>Azores,</b> the storm weakened slightly {{as it moved}} to the north-northeast. Through an interaction with the cold front early on October5 the subtropical storm became extratropical. The system was fully absorbed by the front later that day. The newly absorbed system would separate from the dissolving frontal system and become Subtropical Storm Vince on October8.|$|E
5|$|Clathrus ruber was {{originally}} described by Micheli from Italy. It is considered native to southern and central continental Europe, {{as well as}} Macaronesia (the <b>Azores</b> and the Canary Islands), western Turkey, North Africa (Algeria), and western Asia (Iran). The fungus is rare in central Europe, and is listed in the Red data book of Ukraine.|$|E
5|$|Emmy passed within 135miles (215km) of the Lesser Antilles, {{though only}} minor effects were experienced. No damage was {{reported}} in the <b>Azores,</b> though strong winds from the hurricane caused a Venezuelan air force C-130 flight to crash near Lajes Field, killing all 68 aboard.|$|E
5|$|Maria became extratropical {{midway between}} Cape Race and the <b>Azores</b> on September 10. It never {{threatened}} land as a hurricane, but Maria became a strong extratropical storm, and actually intensified to hurricane strength once again while moving towards Iceland.|$|E
5|$|On 5 October, an operationally unnamed {{subtropical}} storm {{which had}} gone unnoticed by the NHC was absorbed by a temperate frontal low, which {{was moving to}} the southeast over the <b>Azores.</b> The low pressure system gained a more concentrated circulation and lost its frontal structure after absorbing the subtropical storm. The developing system became a subtropical storm itself early on 8 October 580miles (930km) southeast of Lajes in the <b>Azores.</b> However, the NHC decided not to name the system Vince at the time, because the water temperature was too low for normal development for a tropical cyclone. The storm gradually gained the tropical characteristics of symmetry and a warm inner core and became a tropical storm the next day. Its transformation to a tropical system occurred over water cooler than 24°C (75°F), much colder than the 26.5°C (80°F) usually required for tropical development.|$|E
5|$|Other {{operational}} {{incidents of}} note include a 1988 fire during a return voyage from Iceland to the United States which forced {{the ship to}} stop in Newfoundland for repairs, and a crane breakdown on 15 November 1991 during cargo operations that required repairs be made in Praia da Vitória, <b>Azores.</b>|$|E
