40|$|Racecadotril is an {{enkephalinase}} inhibitor, {{presented as}} a purely <b>antisecretory</b> <b>agent</b> with advantages over the opiate-receptor agonist loperamide {{in the treatment of}} diarrhea. A critical review of the literature and the models used was performed. Although pretreatment with high doses of racecadotril reduced cholera toxin-induced secretion and although clinical efficacy was demonstrated in young infants-a population characterized by 10 -fold higher plasma enkephalin concentrations compared with adults, the analysis calls into question the peripheral antisecretory selectivity and relative clinical efficacy. Conversely, loperamide can be proposed as an <b>antisecretory</b> <b>agent</b> at therapeutic concentrations. Its efficacy is well established in acute and chronic diarrhea. Current experimental and clinical comparative studies of both drugs have problems with regard to the selection of the doses, the validity of models, and/or the trial design. The conclusion is that more research is needed before reliable conclusions can be drawn on the place of racecadotril in diarrhea treatmen...|$|E

40|$|Peptic ulcer {{is one of}} {{the major}} public health {{problems}} affecting morbidity and mortality of thousands of people each year. Pathogenesis of peptic ulcer is due to imbalance between aggressive factor (gastric acid secretion) and protective factor (gastric mucus, mucosal blood flow, reepithelialization after injuries) and major risk factors affecting cause of disease are Helicobacter pylori infection and NSAIDs use(2). Many medications have been introduced aiming to reduce acid secretion (<b>antisecretory</b> <b>agent</b> namely H 2 receptor antagonist and proton pump inhibitor) or to improve protective factor (rebamipide, misoprostal, sucralfate) or eradication of Helicobacter pylori (antibiotics) (2).

40|$|Mucus {{glycoprotein}} {{is one of}} {{the major}} components of gastric mucus which plays an important role in mucosal defensive mechanisms as a mucus-bicarbonate barrier. Analysis of the mucus glycoprotein synthesis is a useful tool for evaluating gastric mucosal defensive factors. UDP-galactosyltransferase (UDP-Gal-T) {{is one of the}} regulating enzymes for the synthesis of the mucus glycoprotein. In the present paper, we studied assay methods for UDP-Gal-T activity in rat gastric mucosa using radiolabeled UDP-galactose and two different kinds of acceptor proteins, namely ovomucoid and asialomucin, and analyzed effects of <b>antisecretory</b> <b>agents</b> on the UDP-Gal-T activity. We used crude supernatants of homogenized scrapings of the fundic part of rat stomach as an enzyme preparation and determined optimal conditions. In each acceptor, Mn 2 + and the non-ionic detergent Triton X- 100 were required for the enzyme activity. With each acceptor molecule, the type of glycosidic linkages of galactose was beta-type linkage. With asialomucin as an acceptor, UDP-Gal-T activities of rat gastric mucosa decreased after intraperitoneal administration of <b>antisecretory</b> <b>agents,</b> while change of the enzyme activity was not observed with ovomucoid as an acceptor...|$|R
40|$|In the Rome III classification, {{functional}} dyspepsia (FD) has been further subcategorized into two different syndromes, namely, epigastric pain syndrome (EPS) and postprandial distress syndrome (PDS). Acid-related pathophysiology {{seems to be}} mainly responsible for EPS, and <b>antisecretory</b> <b>agents</b> such as proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) seem to be effective mainly against EPS. However, recent information as {{to the relationship between}} initial duodenal acid sensitization in the early postprandial phase and delayed gastric emptying in the later postprandial phase would suggest the amelioration of PDS by <b>antisecretory</b> <b>agents.</b> In the present review, we summarized the recent literature on the direct and indirect effect of PPIs in FD (including not only Rome III, but also Rome II criteria). The effects of PPIs against FD are heterogeneous, depending on the protocol of the clinical studies, and the inclusion criteria of each randomized controlled trial (primary care or tertiary care population). As the placebo effects cannot be ignored in this disease, a placebo-controlled study would be necessary, at least for the evaluation of the effect of each agent on symptom relief in patients with FD.

40|$|Effects of SCH 32651, a novel antisecretory and cytoprotective agent, on resting and stimulated acid {{secretion}} by the guinea-pig isolated fundic mucosa were studied. SCH 32651 inhibited resting acid secretion {{in proportion}} to concentrations in serosal solution (0. 1 - 10 microM), the IC 50 being 4. 4 microM. Cimetidine and atropine at concentrations up to 100 microM were inactive. Serosal application of SCH 32651 inhibited acid secretory responses to histamine (10 microM), methacholine (1 microM) or dibutyryl cyclic AMP (0. 5 mM) plus theophylline (1 mM) in a concentration-dependent manner. The IC 50 S against histamine, methacholine and db cyclic AMP plus theophylline were 4. 2 microM, 0. 71 microM and 2. 9 microM, respectively. In contrast, atropine and cimetidine each at 100 microM, a concentration that entirely abolished responses to methacholine and histamine, respectively, did not affect acid responses to db cyclic AMP plus theophylline. The inhibitory effects of SCH 32651 on resting and histamine-stimulated acid secretion were readily reversible upon washing. SCH 32651 0. 1 mM in the mucosal solution also greatly suppressed the resting and stimulated acid secretion. In the presence of histamine treatment, SCH 32651 concomitantly caused a marked rise in K+ entry into the mucosal solution in parallel {{to a decline in}} the appearance of H+ in the same solution. The various events demonstrated by SCH 32651 in the present study are shared by omeprazole, a potent <b>antisecretory</b> <b>agent</b> working through inhibition of gastric H+/K+-ATPase.

40|$|Summary Antacids {{have served}} us well {{for over a}} century. In terms of peptic ulcer disease, the {{attitude}} in the late 1950 s to 1970 s that antacids should be taken only on demand was unjustified and erroneous. 13 recent endoscopic controlled studies have confirmed the efficacy of antacids in the healing of duodenal ulcer, achieving about 75 % healing in 4 weeks. The efficacy of antacids in promoting gastric ulcer healing has been less well studied {{and the results are}} controversial. The most appropriate and economical antacid regimens for the treatment of duodenal ulcer disease should include tablets or liquid that have acid neutralising capacity of 400 mmol/day given at least an hour after meals. As a long term therapy, antacids appear to work, but need be taken in multiple daily doses, a regimen which is unlikely to meet with long term patient compliance. Patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux disorders or pregnancy-related reflux have also benefited from the usage of antacids ad libitum. Early previous studies have clearly demonstrated the efficacy of antacids in reducing gastro-oesophageal reflux and healing of reflux oesophagitis. The acidity of the gastric contents is the major determining factor in the outcome of the aspiration pneumonitis occurring during delivery. The prophylactic use of antacids during delivery has helped to reduce the severity of this complication. Similarly, the prophylactic administration of antacid aiming to maintain gastric pH between 3. 5 to 7. 0 has resulted in significant reduction of bleeding due to stress associated ulcers and/or erosive haemorrhagic gastritis in critically ill patients. Antacid therapy, however, is controversial in the management of nonulcer dyspepsia or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug related upper gastrointestinal mucosal damage. Undoubtedly, antacids have major roles to play in the treatment of gastric acid related disorders. They have clear advantages and disadvantages when compared with the <b>antisecretory</b> <b>agents.</b> New proton pump inhibitors in particular have certainly superseded antacids and even the H 2 -receptor antagonists in many respects. However, the long term safety record of antacids remains unsurpassed by any of the new <b>antisecretory</b> <b>agents.</b> link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Over half of {{patients}} with human immun-odeficiency virus (HIV) experience diarrhea that con-tributes negatively to {{quality of life and}} adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART). Opportunistic infectious agents that cause diarrhea in patients with HIV span the array of protozoa, fungi, viruses, and bacteria. With global use of ART, the incidence of diarrhea because of oppor-tunistic infections has decreased; however, the incidence of noninfectious diarrhea has increased. The etiology of noninfectious diarrhea in patients with HIV is multifacto-rial and includes ART-associated diarrhea and gastroin-testinal damage related to HIV infection (i. e., HIV enteropathy). A basic algorithm for the diagnosis of diar-rhea in patients with HIV includes physical examination, a review of medical history, assessment of HIV viral load and CD 4 ? T cell count, stool microbiologic assessment, and endoscopic evaluation, if needed. For patients with negative diagnostic results, the diagnosis of noninfectious diarrhea may be considered. Pharmacologic options for the treatment of noninfectious diarrhea are primarily support-ive; however, the use of many unapproved agents is based on unstudied and anecdotal information. In addition, these agents can be associated with treatment-limiting adverse events (AEs), such as drug–drug interactions with ART regimens, abuse liability, and additional gastrointestinal AEs. Currently, crofelemer, an <b>antisecretory</b> <b>agent,</b> is the only therapy approved in the USA for the symptomatic relief of noninfectious diarrhea in patients with HIV on ART...|$|E

40|$|The H+,K+-ATPase {{inhibitor}} omeprazole is {{a highly}} effective gastric <b>antisecretory</b> <b>agent,</b> both in animals and man, with a long duration of action. These properties are shared {{by a number of}} recently described histamine H,-receptor antagonists. In life-long oncogenicity studies of these H,-receptor antagonists, {{as well as with the}} H+,K+-ATPase inhibitor omeprazole, gastric enterochromaffin-like cell (ECL cell) hyperplasia and carcinoids have been found. The purpose of this paper is to summarize available evidence for the “Gastrin Hypothesis ” to explain the development of ECL-cell hyperplasia. The hypothesis may be outlined as follows: 1) Inhibition of gastric acid secretion leads to elevated antral pH and, secondarily, to release of gastrin from the antral gastrin cells into the blood stream. 2) Gastrin causes both general hypertrophy of the oxyntic mucosa and hyperplasia of the ECL cells in the oxyntic mucosa. That this sequence of events occurs not only with omeprazole but also with other effective gastric antisecretory agents has been verified in the rat by giving the H,-receptor antagonist ranitidine as a continuous infusion. Ranitidine caused a hypergas-trinemia of a similar magnitude as that seen after omeprazole, provided that the acid secretion was inhibited to a similar degree. At similar gastrin levels, ECL-cell hyperplasia of the same magnitude developed during both ranitidine and omeprazole treatment. Antrectomy prevented the development of ECL-cell hyperplasi...|$|E

Several randomized controlled trials have evaluated the efficacy of somatostatin and octreotide in reducing post-ERCP pancreatitis. The results of these trials vary due to different patient populations and experimental designs. Overall, the available evidence suggests that somatostatin reduces the incidence of post-ERCP pancreatitis, whereas octreotide does not. Whether the difference in efficacy between the two drugs is related to their differential effects on sphincter of Oddi motility or is due to other reasons remains unclear. Although there is some evidence supporting the use of somatostatin in reducing the frequency of post-ERCP pancreatitis, it is widely agreed that generalized treatment of all patients undergoing ERCP with prophylactic somatostatin may not be cost-effective.

40|$|We {{examined}} the effects of disulfide and thiol compounds on Escherichia coli heat-stable enterotoxin (ST) and cyclic GMP-induced secretion. Both cystamine and cystine (disulfide compounds) reduced the secretory responses to submaximal doses of ST in suckling mice (at 0. 5 mumol per mouse) and reduced ST activation of guanylate cyclase (by 33 to 73 % at 1 mM). In higher doses, cystamine completely eradicated a maximally effective ST dose as well. In addition, the sulfhydryl (thiol) compounds cysteamine, cysteine, and acetylcysteine strikingly reduced the secretory response and the guanylate cyclase response to ST. Neither the disulfide nor the thiol compounds tested reduced cyclic GMP-induced secretion. These studies suggest that disulfide and thiol compounds both block ST-induced secretion before its activation of guanylate cyclase. Taken with the work of others, these findings suggest that disulfide compounds may alter the oxidation reduction state of a cell or act directly on the guanylate cyclase enzyme, whereas thiol compounds may inactivate ST itself by breaking its disulfide bridges, or it may alter guanylate cyclase activation by ST.

40|$|Antiulcer agents, notably inhibitors of {{gastric acid}} secretion, {{have been the}} most {{successful}} category of drugs to be discovered in recent years; and moreover, there are currently four such agents in the world list of top 25 best selling drugs. Histamine H 2 antagonists have been the number one selling pharmaceutical product {{for more than a decade}} and inhibitors of the parietal cell HIC-ATPase, so called "proton pump inhibitors" (PPI), look set to continue this success. The proposed study was designed to establish the relative efficacy and mechanisms of action of three novel agents using both in vitro and in vivo models. The three compounds namely AG- 1749 (Lansoprazole), PD- 136450 and transforming growth factor alpha (TGF(x) were studied to evaluate their antisecretory and antiulccr activities. Lansoprazole, the second PPI to be developed for clinical use, is a non-competitive inhibitor of the H 1 C-ATPase and has recently been launched in a number of countries. PD- 136450 is a competitive antagonist of central and peripheral cholecystokinin-B (CCK-B) receptors (gastrin receptor) and it under clinical development as an anxiolytic but which has actions on the stomach and pancreas. Anxiolytic drug is otherwise known as anti-anxiety drugs, which are used to treat anxiety disorders, like depression, panic disorders, phobias and many personality disorders. TOFu is a polypeptide growth factor, which acts at the EGF receptor and displays potent mitogenic and antisecretory activity. The initial study deals with the comparison of the three compounds with omeprazole and ranitidine in terms of their ability to inhibit acid secretion and their activity in a range of experimental ulcer models. Potency, duration of action and activity against a range of stimulants of acid secretion (histamine, pentagastrin and basal) was determined in anaesthetized rat models by establishing dose-response relationships. The compounds represent a spectrum of activities in as much as lansoprazole is a potent, long acting inhibitor, PD- 136450 is an orally active but selective inhibitor, while TOFu has a very short duration and is only active after parenteral administration. In a view to find out the mechanism of action of these drugs on gastric acid secretion, isolated gastric glands from rabbits were employed as an in vitro technique using radiolabeled 14 C-aminopyrine as a marker. The results show that lansoprazole was the most potent <b>antisecretory</b> <b>agent</b> compared to other two drugs. The second phase of the study deals with the activity of the three compounds against gastric ulcers induced by acid hypersecretion, indomethacin and stress. This study enabled us to assess the extent to which antisecretory activity per se compared with other actions such as wound healing (TGFa) or anxiolytic activity (PD- 136450) contribute to ulcer healing. As other workers already established that prostaglandins and nitric oxide are involved in the cytoprotective activity, the present study investigated the influence of prostaglandin and nitric oxide by using indomethacin and L-NAME pretreatment on the cytoprotective activity of lansoprazole, PD- 136450 and TGFcz. Moreover, the three drugs were tested for their activities on the mucus and bicarbonate production in the stomach. It was found that lansoprazole and TGFc increased the gastric mucus secretion while PD- 136450 did not show any change. Moreover it was evidenced from this study that the protective activity of PD- 136450 is associated with the influence of bicarbonate secretion from the pancreas. In conclusion, the results of this study have indicated that lansoprazole, PD- 136450 and TGFct are potent antisecretory and antiulcer agents which have great therapeutic importance...|$|E

Results. Troxipide was found to be superior to Ranitidine for both, the complete resolution and improvement of endoscopic gastritis. Higher proportion of patients showed complete healing of erosions (88. 14 %), oozing (96. 77 %), and edema (93. 88 %) with Troxipide as compared to Ranitidine (<. 01). Patients receiving Troxipide also showed a greater improvement in the VAS scores for abdominal pain, bloating, and heartburn (<. 01). Both the drugs were found to be well tolerated. Conclusion. In patients with endoscopic gastritis, Troxipide, with its superior rate of improvement, resolution of signs, and subjective clinical symptoms, can be considered {{as an alternative to the}} commonly used <b>antisecretory</b> <b>agents...</b>|$|R
40|$|Background. Empirical {{therapy with}} <b>antisecretory</b> <b>agents</b> like PPIs and H 2 RAs {{has long been}} the {{traditional}} approach in the initial management of uninvestigated dyspepsia. Aim. The objective {{of the study was to}} examine relief of dyspepsia with lafutidine, a second-generation H 2 -RA, and rabeprazole and to compare their efficacy. Methods. This was a randomized, open, comparative trial in adult uninvestigated dyspeptic patients, who had at least moderate severity of symptoms, defined as a score of ≥ 4 on a 7 -point global overall symptom (GOS) scale, and were randomized to receive once daily either lafutidine 10 [*]mg or rabeprazole 20 [*]mg for 4 weeks. Results. A total of 236 patients were enrolled, out of which 194 patients were included in the analysis. At the end of week 4, a significant difference was observed for symptom relief (lafutidine 89. 90 % versus rabeprazole 65. 26 %, P <. 01) and symptom resolution (lafutidine 70. 71 % versus rabeprazole 25. 26 %, P <. 01). Both the drugs were well tolerated. Conclusion. Both lafutidine and rabeprazole provide symptom relief in patients with heartburn-dominant uninvestigated dyspepsia. The present study confirms the appropriateness of lafutidine as an empiric treatment and superior efficacy for primary care practice patients with dyspepsia...|$|R
40|$|Background : Gastric <b>antisecretory</b> <b>agents</b> may {{inhibit the}} {{synthesis}} or secretion of gastric mucin during acid suppression, which {{would interfere with}} mucosal protection and limit {{the efficacy of the}} agents. Methods : Rats were dosed with famotidine, omeprazole, or buffer control for 4 weeks. Mucin synthesis, mucin histochemistry, mucin carbohydrate composition and prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) release were measured during and after drug treatment. Results : PGE 2 release was maximally inhibited after 2 weeks of omeprazole or 4 weeks of famotidine. Total glycoprotein synthesis was inhibited at all times by omeprazole, but only after the cessation of dosing with famotidine. Sulphated glycoprotein synthesis was inhibited by both drugs at 2 weeks. PGE 2 release and sulphated glycoprotein synthesis were restored to control values or more by the 5 th day after the end of dosing, at which time total glycoprotein synthesis was significantly suppressed in both groups. Histologically, a reduction of PAS-positive surface mucus was observed after 2 weeks of dosing in both groups. Both famotidine and omeprazole reduced the sialic acid content during and after treatment. Conclusions : These results suggest that long-term anti-secretory therapy also affects the production of factors involved in primary gastric mucosal defence, which should be considered in the assessment of response to treatment in clinical trials...|$|R
40|$|For decades, {{millions}} {{of patients with}} acid-related disorders have had their acid inhibited effectively and safely first with H 2 -receptor antagonists (H 2 RAs) and then with proton pump inhibitors (PPI). As with any pharmacological agent, PPIs {{have been reported to}} be associated with some adverse events, but several recent large-scale observational studies have evidenced new and serious abnormalities generally linked to their chronic use. However, these studies have often important limitations for their frequent retrospective design and other methodological drawbacks, such as selection biases of the analyzed populations and the presence of various confounding factors. Overall, although the conclusions of these pharmacovigilant investigations {{must be taken into account}} and can generate important hypotheses for future research, they do not have to create panic among patients and alarmism among physicians. On considering the weakness of these studies, we suggest physicians should not refrain from continuing to use PPIs, if these drugs are given for medical indications clearly established in the literature and, more importantly, they should not be induced to shift to H 2 RAs, a class of <b>antisecretory</b> <b>agents</b> that are much less effective than PPIs. A return to the past is potentially dangerous for the patients, taking into account the well-known success of PPIs in the wide spectrum of all acid-related conditions...|$|R
40|$|The {{possible}} carcinogenic {{effects of}} <b>antisecretory</b> <b>agents</b> {{used in the}} treatment of gastric and duodenal ulcer were investigated in a population based cohort study of 16, 739 patients who were prescribed the H 2 -antagonist cimetidine between 1977 and 1981. An excess risk for gastric cancer was observed, with a relative risk of about 10 in the first year after beginning use of the drug, which decreased thereafter. A similar pattern was seen for cancers of the colon, pancreas and gall bladder, and for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. These increased risks probably represent cases in which a malignancy was misdiagnosed as a gastric ulcer. The excess risk for gastric cancer was unaffected by the method of diagnosis, the risk in those who had undergone an endoscopy being similar to those who had been diagnosed by an x-ray examination. A relative risk of 1. 5 - 2. 0 was observed for cancer of the respiratory organs, with no effect of latency, indicating that there are common risk factors for peptic ulcer and for lung cancer. Although the observed increases in cancer risk in persons receiving cimetidine is probably caused by factors other than a carcinogenic action of the drug itself, this possibility cannot be ruled out because of the short period of follow up...|$|R
40|$|Symptomatic {{gastro-oesophageal}} reflux disease is a common disorder characterized by pathological exposure of the distal oesophagus to acid. The management requires the control of symptoms, prevention of relapse and complications. Proton pump inhibitors are without doubt the most effective agents {{in the management of}} {{gastro-oesophageal reflux}} disease. In Helicobacter pylori-negative individuals the efficacy of ranitidine, but more pronounced of omeprazole, on the nocturnal intragastric acidity, is less than in Helicobacter pylori-positive patients. Curing the Helicobacter pylori infection in {{gastro-oesophageal reflux disease}} patients might, therefore, have the disadvantage of losing efficacy of antisecretory therapy. Conversely, several studies have shown that long-term use of proton pump inhibitors is associated with progression and worsening of body gastritis exclusively in Helicobacter pylori-positives. This observation makes Helicobacter pylori eradication indicated before starting long-term treatment with proton pump inhibitors for gastro-oesophageal reflux disease and other acid-related diseases. The data reported, so far, however, are not conclusive. The Federal Drugs Administration Advisory Committee concluded on available data, that {{there is no evidence that}} longterm proton pump inhibitors treatment leads to gastric atrophy, intestinal metaplasia or gastric cancer. Eradication of Helicobacter pylori infection might lead to reduction in the efficacy of <b>antisecretory</b> <b>agents,</b> but might prevent worsening of the gastric corpus gastritis. More data are needed to really answer these clinically relevant question...|$|R
30|$|Helicobacter pylori is a {{pathogen}} {{that causes}} peptic ulcer diseases (PUD), and a notable {{decrease in the}} global prevalence of PUD has been reported (Dutta et al. 2012; Xia et al. 2001 b). In this present study, the estimated prevalence of DU and GU was reduced almost by half from 12.65 to 6.57  % and from 7.51 to 3.78  %, respectively, during the ten year study period in the endoscopy-referral population. The recent decline in PUD, especially in DU, is slow compared to the total in H. pylori infection; which correlates with the key role of H. pylori infections for PUD. However, the gradual decrease of H. pylori infection rates in PUD patients emphasizes the role of other risk factors for PUD. It is well established that NSAIDs are independent risk factors for PUD (Chen et al. 2010), and the prolific use of <b>antisecretory</b> <b>agents</b> such as histamine- 2 -receptor blockers and proton pump inhibitors {{were likely to be}} related to the decrease of PUD (Groenen et al. 2009; Wu et al. 2009). Since non-NSAID non-H. pylori ulcers were present in 17  % of patients with DU; (Xia et al. 2001 a) it seems likely that with the decreased prevalence of H. pylori infection, the proportion of H. pylori-negative PUD would increase even if the use of those drugs mentioned above remains constant (Chen et al. 2010).|$|R

40|$|Acute {{diarrhea}} is a {{major cause}} of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Infants and pre-school children are the most vulnerable in whom there are 2 – 3 million deaths each year {{as a result of the}} associated dehydration and acidosis. Although oral rehydration therapy has reduced mortality during the past 30 years ago, the search for agents that will directly inhibit intestinal secretory mechanisms and thereby reduce faecal losses in patients with high-volume watery diarrhea has continued for more than 20 years. A variety of potential targets for <b>antisecretory</b> <b>agents</b> have been explored which include loci within the enterocyte (the chloride channel, calcium-calmodulin) and other sites such as enteric nerves and endogenous mediators (such as 5 -HT, prostaglandins). Although the potential of calcium-calmodulin inhibition has as yet not been realised, preliminary studies suggest that there are chloride channel blockers under development that will find a place in the management of secretory diarrheas. Recent work has highlighted the importance of neurohumoral mechanisms in the pathogenesis of acute diarrhea. Potentiation of the effects of endogenous enkephalin activity by enkephalinase inhibition has already produced a safe, effective anti-secretory drug, racecadotril. Speculative early work indicates that there may be a role for antagonists of 5 -HT, substance P, and VIP receptors. There now seems to be a real possibility that antisecretory therapy will become more widely available in the future...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} develop a model for {{secretory}} diarrhoea and to confirm the in vitro effects of cholera toxin in man in vivo the effect of intrajejunally administered cholera toxin was investigated in healthy volunteers. An intestinal perfusion technique with an occluding balloon proximal to the infusion site was used. The jejunum was perfused under steady state conditions with a plasma like electrolyte solution containing polyethylene glycol as a non-absorbable volume marker. After two control periods of one hour each, during which water was absorbed {{at a rate of}} 104 (14) (mean (SEM), n = 15) and 94 (15) ml/ 30 cm/h, respectively, three different doses of cholera toxin (6. 25 micrograms, 12. 5 micrograms, 25 micrograms) were administered by bolus into the lumen of the jejunum. Cholera toxin reduced absorption of water and electrolytes progressively over four hours and induced secretion in a dose dependent fashion. In the fourth hour net secretion amounted to 22 (23), 36 (24), and 88 (40) ml/ 30 cm/h (each n = five) with doses of 6. 25, 12. 5, and 25 micrograms cholera toxin, respectively. The movement of sodium, chloride, and bicarbonate paralleled water movement. Our results suggest that cholera toxin may serve as a secretory model in the human jejunum which might allow testing of new <b>antisecretory</b> <b>agents...</b>|$|R
40|$|Introduction: The major {{complication}} of aspirin and clopidogrel (A+C) co-therapy is upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). However, data are unavailable for real-life situations. Furthermore, the treatment effect of <b>antisecretory</b> <b>agents</b> is unknown. Aim: This cohort study aimed {{to determine the}} occurrence of UGIB. The treatment effect of H 2 -receptor antagonist (H 2 RA) and proton pump inhibitor (PPI) was also analyzed. Method: The records of 987 consecutive patients on A+C co-therapy between January 2001 and September 2006 were analyzed. The follow-up ended on the dates of a first occurrence of UGIB, stopping A+C co-therapy, {{a change in the}} antisecretory class, death, or March 2007. Results: After a follow-up of 5. 8 ± 6. 5 months, UGIB occurred in 39 (4. 0 %) patients. PPI, H 2 RA and control were prescribed in 213, 287 and 487 patients respectively. After adjustment for age, dose of aspirin, previous UGIB and duration of treatment, the risk was marginally reduced by H 2 RA (OR = 0. 43, 95 % CI 0. 18 - 0. 91, p = 0. 04) and significantly reduced by PPI (OR = 0. 04, 95 % CI 0. 002 - 0. 21, p = 0. 002), as compared to control. Conclusion: The occurrence of UGIB associated with A+C co-therapy for a median of 5. 8 months was 4. 0 %. Co-prescription with PPI was associated with a lower risk. Copyright © 2008 S.
