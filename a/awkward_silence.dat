5|$|The {{original}} script {{called for}} Michael to tell Andy about Angela's affair {{outside in the}} parking lot before getting into his car and driving away. When filming began, Holland considered filming the scene inside the car instead. Steve Carell suggested Michael get in the car and leave Andy outside, then tell him while driving away, which was how the scene was ultimately shot. During a scene when Andy returns to the office and confronts his co-workers; there is a long, <b>awkward</b> <b>silence,</b> and the script originally called for Kevin to pass gas and ruin the tension. During filming, it was changed so Phyllis would pass gas instead because it was decided it would be funnier if it were a woman. During the editing process, Holland decided the joke did not work very well and cut it, but a brief moment of Dwight reacting in a disgusted way to the flatulence, while maintaining a defensive fighting pose toward Andy, can still be seen in the finished episode.|$|E
5|$|Matthew Perry portrays Chandler Bing, an {{executive}} in statistical analysis and data reconfiguration for a large, multinational corporation. Chandler hates this job, although it pays well. He attempts to quit during season one, but is lured {{back with a}} new office and a pay raise. He eventually quits this job in season nine due to a transfer to Tulsa. He becomes a junior copywriter at an advertising agency later that season. Chandler has a peculiar family history being {{the son of an}} erotic novelist mother and a gay, cross-dressing Las Vegas star father. Chandler is known for his sarcastic sense of humor and bad luck in relationships. Chandler marries Monica in season seven, and they adopt twins {{at the end of the}} series. Before his relationship with Monica, Chandler dated Janice Hosenstein in season one and subsequently broke up with her many times. Matthew Perry has expressed his similarities to the character, such as his need to break an <b>awkward</b> <b>silence</b> with a joke and difficulties with women when first joining the show.|$|E
25|$|Heavy {{or light}} traffic within the ride system can cause speed {{variations}} as the vehicles {{try not to}} enter the specified safety distance between one another. On busy days, each vehicle may slow to a crawl at intervals within the ride path {{in order to allow}} the vehicle ahead to gain distance, then suddenly jerk back into higher speed. Because of these unexpected variations in speed, the soundtrack to the ride is not of a specific length, in fact, each scene of the attraction has a pre-selected score to play which is already of a certain length. If the vehicle finds itself remaining in one scene {{for an extended period of}} time, the score will play in full or until the vehicle leaves the scene. If the vehicle remains in a scene longer than the length of the score, then an exaggerated soundtrack of the vehicle's engine will fade-in and play to keep riders from experiencing <b>awkward</b> <b>silence.</b> Due to safety reasons, vehicles on the ride path cannot reverse. Contrary to the finale scene when the vehicle reverses away from the boulder, the vehicle is actually stationary while the motion base tilts backwards and the cave walls accelerate past the riders to give the illusion of reversing.|$|E

Michael attempts to reject Jan, but reverses himself immediately when he sees that she has had a breast augmentation. Jim and Karen drive to New York City together and spend the night before their interviews. Karen tells Jim that if either of them gets the job, both should move to New York. She promises to do so, but is met with <b>awkward</b> <b>silence</b> when she asks Jim to reciprocate. Meanwhile, Dwight begins his new regime, assigning Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) the role of his number two and asking Pam to be his secret [...] "Assistant to the Regional Manager."

500|$|Travis Fickett, a {{reviewer}} from IGN, praised {{both the}} {{writing and the}} acting of season 4. When speaking of the season finale [...] "Goodbye Toby", Fickett {{went on to say}} [...] "It's a great episode that ends a great season. There are more than a few questions raised that will have us eagerly tuning in when the show returns in the fall." [...] Aubry D'Arminio praised the season, but she also showed disapproval at what she felt was a lack of use for some of The Offices supporting cast in the episodes directly following the Writers' Strike, saying [...] "I just feel a bit sad that, minus Leslie David Baker's Stanley, these excellent actors/characters haven't been highlighted nearly enough since the series' return in April." [...] In a comprehensive review of the fourth season DVD, IGN reviewers Travis Fickett and Phil Pirrello both believed [...] "this season {{to be one of the}} show's best, [...] that 14 episodes across four discs gives way to crowding, especially when the season tries to tackle Jim and Pam dating, Angela and Dwight breaking up, Andy and Angela dating by way of <b>awkward</b> <b>silence,</b> Michael and Jan breaking up, Toby leaving the office and a new love interest for Michael joining the cast." [...] Fickett and Pirrello gave the season a total score of 8 out of 10.|$|E
500|$|The Maharishi had {{arranged}} a simple lifestyle for his guests, which included stone cottages and vegetarian meals taken outdoors in a communal setting. The days {{were devoted to}} meditating and attending lectures by the Maharishi, who spoke from a flower-bedecked platform in an auditorium. The Maharishi also gave private lessons to the individual Beatles, nominally due to their late arrival. The tranquil environment provided by the Maharishi – complete with meditation, relaxation, {{and away from the}} media throng – helped the band to relax. Harrison told Saltzman, [...] "Like, we're The Beatles after all, aren't we? We have all the money you could ever dream of. We have all the fame you could ever wish for. But, it isn't love. It isn't health. It isn't peace inside, is it?" [...] Lennon was respectful of the Maharishi but not in awe of him. At their first meeting Donovan remembers that the Maharishi was [...] "amiable but non-talkative", and during an <b>awkward</b> <b>silence</b> Lennon walked across the room and patted the Maharishi on the head, saying, [...] "There's a good little guru" [...] while the room erupted in laughter. Maharishi cancelled the formal lectures for a time and told students to meditate for as long as possible. One student meditated for 42 straight hours, and Pattie Boyd once meditated for seven hours. Boyd's sister Jenny meditated for long periods as well, but also suffered from dysentery (misdiagnosed as tonsilitis); she said Lennon also felt unwell, suffering from jet lag and insomnia. The lengthy meditation sessions left many students moody and oversensitive. Like the 60 other students at the ashram, the Beatles adopted native dress and the ashram had a tailor on the premises to make clothes for the students. The Beatles shopped in Rishikesh and the women bought saris for themselves and to be made into shirts and jackets for the men, which affected Western fashion when the Beatles wore them after going home.|$|E

2500|$|The <b>awkward</b> <b>silence</b> {{was broken}} when McNamara {{raised the issue}} of Madame Nhu. Diệm was a {{bachelor}} so Madame Nhu was the de facto First Lady, living in the palace. Dubbed the Dragon Lady due to her acerbic nature, she had a long history of anti-American remarks. McNamara complained about her [...] "ill-advised and unfortunate declarations". He removed a newspaper clipping from his pocket in which she was quoted as calling some US officers as [...] "acting like little soldiers of fortune" [...] which she claimed had caused the Americans to pursue a [...] "confused policy". McNamara said that such comment hurt the bilateral relationship and that the American public would be less generous in sending their officers to support the anti-communist counterinsurgency. One of the Americans lost his composure and asked Diệm whether [...] "there was not something the government could do to shut her up." ...|$|E
2500|$|Allen {{employed}} a writing staff but they served as his sounding boards and early draft consultants {{as much as}} actual writers; it was Allen who had the final edit and rewrite of each week's script, working as long as twelve {{hours a day in}} his own right on ideas or sketches. His ad-libbing ability caused many a show to fade away behind the ending network identification, because Allen often ate up air time. It was not as unusual for him as for others to sign off with [...] "We're a little late, so good night, folks." [...] Buxton and Owen believed the Allen show needed it more than anyone else of his era. Allen also [...] "died" [...] more eloquently than other radio comics, particularly in the later years. When a joke was greeted with an <b>awkward</b> <b>silence,</b> Allen would comment on the lack of response, with his ad-libbed [...] "explanation" [...] almost always funnier than the original joke.|$|E

500|$|Bobby Edner's {{portrayal}} of Vaan has been met with mostly positive reception. Cavin Smith praised his acting, stating that {{he sounds like}} an actual teenager without sounding whiny. Agustin praised the developers for giving Vaan a voice actor, commenting that it prevents any <b>awkward</b> <b>silences</b> from a silent protagonist. He added however that Vaan is [...] "decidedly quiet", owing {{to many of the}} conversations not requiring his input, which Agustin called a [...] "brilliant interactive storytelling device". His design change from Final Fantasy XII to Revenant Wings was criticized by RPGFan editor Patrick Gann, for going from a teenage design to {{what appears to be the}} design of a 10-year-old Vaan.|$|R

40|$|Encouraging {{debate on}} {{inclusion}} and equity can meet with <b>awkward</b> <b>silences,</b> particularly across disciplinary boundaries. In disability studies, for example, {{it can be}} difficult to build dialogue with other disciplines; as a consequence, the different disciplinary groups within the field of education often end up working in their own ‘‘equity’’ silos. In this essay Valerie Harwood addresses this concern by drawing on Hannah Arendt’s emphasis on the importance of opinion together with Michel Foucault’s work on truth-telling and critique. Following Arendt’s emphasis on opinion and the political, Harwood makes the case that political acts in education require that we recuperate the importance of opinion and to take account of how truth functions in our contemporary context...|$|R
