6000|$|... "I {{have been}} at him all the evening," [...] said Miss O'Callaghan, [...] "and Mrs. Conroy, too, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> he had a dreadful cold and couldn't sing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We met him {{on our way}} here, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> so," [...] said Mrs. Melbury. [...] "He {{had said}} {{something}} like it before. He seems very much upset altogether." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I don't know,' {{answered}} Dan, uncomfortably. 'I've seen a man take rabbits {{out of a}} hat, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> {{we could}} see how he did it, if we watched hard. And we did.' ...|$|E
60|$|IVY. There's beasts, and flowers, <b>and</b> waters, <b>and</b> <b>'e</b> <b>told</b> <b>us.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Hardyman {{seems to}} {{understand}} animals," [...] he said. [...] "He lifted the dog's eyelid {{and looked at}} his eyes, <b>and</b> then <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> the bath was useless." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Many {{women have}} kissed Krishna. They told him this to cheer their own hearts when the gray hairs came, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> has <b>told</b> <b>us</b> the tale," [...] said the Bull, below his breath.|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{looked in}} on the doctor who wrote to us about your injury before we came here, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> you were strong enough for a little quiet conversation. We haven't {{appointed}} another director yet." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'And then {{he would}} talk about the 'Varsity,' said Bobby. 'He got a degree there. <b>And</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> we weren't intellectual. He told the Adjutant so, sir. He was just that kind of chap, sir, if you understand.' ...|$|E
60|$|We {{travelled}} from Oberau with {{a tourist}} agent, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> all his troubles. It seems that a tourist agent is an ordinary human man, and has feelings {{just like we}} have. This {{had never occurred to}} me before. I told him so.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well met!" [...] {{the former}} exclaimed. [...] "We have {{just left the}} general, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> has <b>told</b> <b>us</b> what you have done, <b>and</b> that <b>he</b> has made you a captain in consequence. We were just coming to look for you to carry you off to supper in honour of your promotion." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>And</b> now <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> {{of the gay}} doings {{there had}} been in Piacenza for the {{occasion}} of the visit of the Duke's son Ottavio--that same son-in-law of the Emperor whom the latter befriended, yet not to the extent of giving him the duchy in his father's place when that father should have gone to answer for his sins.|$|R
60|$|<b>And</b> then <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> {{the real}} {{history of the}} fish. It seemed that he had caught it himself, years ago, when he was quite a lad; not by any art or skill, but by that unaccountable luck that appears to always wait upon a boy when he plays the wag from school, and goes out fishing on a sunny afternoon, {{with a bit of}} string tied on {{to the end of a}} tree.|$|R
6000|$|A day or {{two after}} that we picked up a Denver man at the cross roads, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> {{a good deal about}} the country and the Gregory Diggings. He seemed a very {{entertaining}} person and a man well posted in the affairs of Colorado. By and by he remarked: ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Yes, Parson told us that. Well, well! Why, it {{was only}} two days ago that Tom Stevens came in. He has growed to be a fine young fellow too, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> that you were well and hearty and had been through lots of fights. But he didn’t say nothing about your having come home.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very glad to {{find you}} safe, sir," [...] said Ormond. [...] "We met the Blackfoot who peddles moccasins, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> he had seen four men he thought were Stevens' gang heading for Carrington, so we pushed on {{as fast as we}} could. Perhaps if we three went on with rifles we might {{overtake}} them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{owner of}} the farm is a Boer, mother, <b>and</b> as <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>us,</b> a rebel. As he began the affair by putting a bullet through my hat, and abusing us and our nation heartily, we took the liberty of searching his house, with good success. I need not say {{that he did not}} give us this bread and the pail of milk of his own free-will, but I left the money for them." ...|$|R
60|$|We talked along, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> got out {{a little}} hand-bag and begun to open it, and <b>told</b> <b>us</b> to turn our backs. We done it, <b>and</b> when <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> to turn again he was {{perfectly}} different {{to what he was}} before. He had on blue goggles and the naturalest-looking long brown whiskers and mustashes you ever see. His own mother wouldn't 'a' knowed him. He asked us if he looked like his brother Jubiter, now.|$|R
6000|$|... "We said to {{him that}} it would be {{necessary}} to take the advice of an expert before we could make any movement; <b>and,</b> though <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> things about old Johnson and Linkheaton, which it seemed almost impossible that anyone but the right man could have known, we put him off till we had seen you, and could make an appointment for you to examine the tattooings. They must be dealt with first, before any other identification." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Right in the side, {{just above}} the hip. I am afraid it is all up with him; the long journey, {{and the loss of}} blood, have pretty well done for any chance he might have had. Still we could not let him die like a dog, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> he was sure you would come." ...|$|E
60|$|There {{was a very}} well-informed Belgian in the carriage, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> {{something}} interesting about nearly every town through which we passed. I felt that if I could have kept awake, and have listened to that man, and remembered what he said, and not mixed things up, I should have learnt {{a good deal about}} the country between Ostend and Cologne.|$|E
60|$|I {{never knew}} {{scientists}} could rise to such occasions. Old Mangum orally labelled and classified Goodloe and myself easily {{among the lowest}} orders of the vertebrates; and in English, too, without going any further into Latin than the simple references to Orgetorix, Rex Helvetii--which {{is as far as}} I ever went, myself. <b>And</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> that if he ever caught us around his house again he would add us to his collection.|$|E
2500|$|In December 2014, Zaken again {{provided}} new evidence, {{revealing that}} Olmert had offered her $10,000 for every month she would serve {{in jail for}} taking the blame in the Holyland case, to be paid in a foreign bank account. In {{one of the eight}} recordings revealed, Olmert can also be heard talking about buying Sheldon Adelson's, a Jewish-American billionaire's, testimony, <b>and</b> how <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>U.S.</b> President George W. Bush about Olmert's traitorship: [...] "Adelson – this dog, son of a dog – went to President Bush and said that I’m a traitor. Bush told me." ...|$|R
5000|$|... “The {{executive}} producer was, from the creative point of view, obviously key. We {{put together a}} list of candidates and George Dessart was our first candidate and the one we really went after. We tried to recruit him very strongly. George thought about it, <b>and</b> finally <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> that <b>he</b> just wasn't right for it. We were really despondent over that decision. He was exactly right. He {{probably would have been}} terrible. He was a fine producer, but for this job, he was not right for it although we thought he was.” ...|$|R

60|$|To {{put an end}} to the matter, we went upstairs, {{and asked}} the traffic superintendent, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> that he had just met a man, who said he had seen it at number three platform. We went to number three platform, but the {{authorities}} there said that they rather thought that train was the Southampton express, or else the Windsor loop. But they were sure it wasn’t the Kingston train, though why they were sure it wasn’t they couldn’t say.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's quite simple," [...] said Mrs. Savine, smiling. [...] "Did {{my husband}} {{tell you that}} {{when we were in}} England, we were held up by a storm there one night in your ancestral home? There was a man there who ought to belong to the feudal ages. He was called Musker, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> quaint stories about some of you. I fancy Geoffrey, who robbed the king's dragoons, must have looked just like you when you shut your fingers so, a few minutes ago." ...|$|E
60|$|When we got down-stairs {{we found}} our cycles waiting ready at the door, {{together}} with the stable man and the stable boy and the boy's helper and the cook and the chambermaid and the waiters and the other servants, waiting for their tips. Mr. Poplington seemed in a fine humor, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> {{he had heard the}} night before that there was to be a stag hunt that day, the first of the season. In fact, it was not one of the regular meets, but what they called a by-meet, and not known to everybody.|$|E
6000|$|... "Trevor {{told me to}} {{take care}} of her," [...] <b>he</b> said; <b>and</b> then <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> of Perrault's arguments, but we ought not to have let him talk of them that night, for it brought back the shuddering and sobbing, and the horror seemed to come upon him, so that there was no {{soothing}} him or getting him calm till the doctor mixed an anodyne draught; and let it go as it would with Hester, I never left my boy till I had crooned him to sleep, as in the old times.|$|R
6000|$|After the long, hard {{rides and}} the barren camp-sites what delight to awaken in this {{beautiful}} valley with the morning cool and breezy and bright, with smell of new-mown hay {{from the green}} and purple alfalfa fields, and the sunlight gilding the jagged crags above! Romer made a bee-line for the peach trees. He beat his daddy only a few yards. The kind rancher had visited us the night before <b>and</b> <b>he</b> had <b>told</b> <b>us</b> to help ourselves to fruit, melons, alfalfa. Needless to state that I made my breakfast on peaches! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's it, Thomas; and bachelors {{ought not}} to have children. Had our poor brother James escaped that mishap, {{he might have been}} sitting at your bed-side at this moment, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> could have <b>told</b> <b>us</b> all about it. St. James I used to call him; <b>and</b> well did <b>he</b> deserve the name!" ...|$|R
60|$|La plus belle was the Duchess of Longueville, {{who tried}} hard to persuade the people that she was one with them. Her second son had been born {{only a few days}} after her {{expedition}} to the Hotel de Ville, and she asked the City of Paris to stand godmother to him in the person of the provosts and echevins. Afterwards she had a great reception, which Clement Darpent attended, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> the next morning that it had been the most wonderful mixture of black gowns and cassocks, with blue scarfs and sword-knots, lawyers, ladies, warriors, and priests.|$|E
6000|$|He made {{a figure}} that was at once absurd and pitiful of his little Author making this raid upon the world, {{resolved}} to detect and exorcise these suspected Wild Asses, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> at great length of how steadily and inevitably the poor enthusiast entangled himself in feuds and false accusations, libels and denunciations, free fights, burglaries, and so to universal execration in a perpetually tightening coil. [...] "I'll stick to it," [...] he squeaks, with every fresh blow of Fate. Behind him, with a developing incurable bronchitis that could never be fatal, toiled the devil, more and more despondent, more and more draggle-tailed, voiceless and unhelpful.|$|E
60|$|I didn't {{think this}} was possible, but I didn't stop to make any conjectures about it. Rectus and I ran up on the forward deck, {{to see how this}} {{agreeable}} change had come about. The moment we got outside, we found the wind blowing fearfully and the waves dashing as high as ever, but they were not plunging against our sides. We carefully worked our way along to the pilot-house, and looked in. The captain was inside, and when he saw us {{he opened the door and}} came out. He was going to his own room, just back of the pilot-house, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> to come with him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Our new parson <b>told</b> me, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> is in {{my opinion}} a good authority, {{because he is a}} Christian, if ever a man was; <b>and</b> <b>he</b> is an elderly man, besides being uncommonly clever <b>and</b> well informed. <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> a great many strong facts at the temperance meeting we held last night. I wish you had been there, Miles. It would have warmed your heart, I think." ...|$|R
2500|$|Police {{said that}} he had been in {{psychiatric}} care, where he was treated for depression. Prosecutors {{said that he}} had been treated for two months in a mental care facility in 2015. De Maizière said that he may have been bullied by his peers, and police {{said that he had}} suffered [...] "bodily injury" [...] in an incident involving other young people in 2012. During the attack, Sonboly shouted that he had been bullied for seven years. A former classmate recalled, [...] "We always mobbed [...] him in school, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> always <b>told</b> <b>us</b> that <b>he</b> would kill us." ...|$|R
60|$|Synge {{was always}} ready to go {{anywhere}} with one, and when there to enjoy what came. He went with me to see an ordinary melodrama at the Queen's Theatre, Dublin, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> delighted {{to see how the}} members of the company could by the vehemence of their movements and the resources of their voices hold your attention on a play where everything was commonplace. He enjoyed seeing the contrite villain of the piece come up {{from the bottom of the}} gulch, hurled there by the adventuress, and flash his sweating blood-stained face up against the footlights; <b>and,</b> though <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>he</b> had but a few short moments to live, roar his contrition with the voice of a bull.|$|R
