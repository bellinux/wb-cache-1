Later in January 2010, Disney decided to shut down Miramax after downsizing Touchstone, but one month later, they instead began selling the Miramax brand and its 700-title film library to Filmyard Holdings. In March, ImageMovers Digital, which Disney had established as a joint venture studio with Robert Zemeckis in 2007, was shut down. In April 2010, Lyric Street, Disney's country music label in Nashville, was shut down. The following month, the company sold the Power Rangers brand, as well as its 700-episode library, back to Haim Saban. In January 2011, Disney Interactive Studios was downsized. In November, two ABC stations were sold.With the release of Tangled in 2010, Ed Catmull said that the [...] "princess" [...] genre of films was taking a hiatus until [...] "someone has a fresh take on it ... but we don't have any other musicals or fairytales lined up."

A two-sided empirical model is estimated which {{takes into account the}} demand from listeners as well as from advertisers. This paper follows a novel approach by specifying a nested logit model for listener demand in which markets are defined on the basis of sociodemographic characteristics such as gender and age. Moreover detailed firm-level information on advertising prices and quantities is available from a unique dataset. The results will indicate whether the demographic composition of a radio station’s audience is more important than simply the magnitude of a radio station’s audience. More specifically, this paper finds that <b>audience</b> <b>composition</b> is most important for different age groups and especially as the age gap widens. However the discounts and premiums on spot prices that advertisers receive do not depend on <b>audience</b> <b>composition</b> but on other radio station characteristics. 1...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In 2003, {{the alcohol}} {{beverage}} industry {{spent more than}} $ 1. 6 billion on advertising in measured media outlets, including $ 394 million on ads placed in magazines. Industry critics assert {{that some of these}} activities intentionally target adolescent audiences and thereby contribute importantly to social problems associated with underage alcohol consumption. Several recent studies attempt to demonstrate targeting of youth by evaluation of <b>audience</b> <b>compositions</b> for magazines and other media. Some of these studies claim that magazine audiences with more than 15 % underage youth result in “overexposure ” to alcohol ads, and critics allege that this exposure demonstrates targeting of underage youth. This paper examines annual count data for alcohol ads placed in 28 magazines in 2001 - 2003. Specifying a demand function for advertising space, Poisson and negative binomial regressions are estimated conditional on magazine characteristics and readership demographics, including the percent of youth in the audience. The explanatory variables also include real prices of standardized advertisements, a measure of audience size, and a control variable for “exposure ” in the count data model (annual issues). The analysis fails to demonstrate that alcohol advertisers are targeting youth. Adult audience size and price are key variables affecting advertising placement decisions. Implications of the findings for regulation of alcohol advertising are examined...|$|R

40|$|Social {{interaction}} involves performances across varied ‘stages ’ {{of space}} and time, where subject-authors use narrative conventions to communicate their beliefs, identities, and desires in order to influence the opinions and behaviour of others.

In this article I discuss how Filipina go-go dancers develop creative storylines that describe their biographical progression as young women in this modern, cosmopolitan setting.

The results seem to indicate that theater audiences are generally loyal to an institution. However, when controlling for more complex structural patterns, such as the co-attendance of identical plays, the tendency toward mobility across institutions becomes more pronounced. By integrating both attribute-specific patterns and more complex structural patterns in the same model social network analysis offers the possibility to investigate differences in co-attendance, loyalty and audience diversity...|$|E

While the speakers in this study make limited use of hallmark vernacular features of AAE (such as copula deletion and invariant be), they consistently draw from a black stylistic repertoire, specifically black preaching style, that allows them to take controversial political stances as they express their ethnic, religious, and philosophical affiliation with members of the black community...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the political speeches of the Greek dictator Georgios Papadopoulos {{from the time}} his regime [...] the self-titled 'Revolution of the 21 st April' [...] usurped power in 1967 until he himself was ousted in November 1973. The thesis proposes that the underlying aim of all of Papadopoulos's political speeches is {{the construction of a}} cyclical narrative of a past, present and future Greece. According to his political speeches, this construct proposes a 'dangerous', 'corrupt' and 'undemocratic' recent past that necessitated his 'Revolutionary' present; a 'revolutionary' present that strives to create the preconditions for a 'prosperous' future Greece; and a future Greece that shall embody the 'Helleno-Christian' ideals of the distant past, and detach itself from the failings of the recent past. The premise on which the research is founded is that patterns in his political speeches can be quantitatively identified and that, from these patterns, a qualitative interpretation can be developed. Thus, quantitative data were collated concerning the frequency of key terms and concepts, both literal and figurative, in all of Papadopoulos's political speeches and, then, cross-referenced with <b>audience</b> <b>composition</b> and date of delivery. These data were subsequently analysed holistically {{in the context of the}} political, social, economic and cultural aspects of Greece's recent history. The thesis developed from the data is divided into three parts. The first part {{examines the}} history immediately before and during the 7 -year dictatorship. The second and third parts consider specific lexical terms and concepts and medical and biological analogies, respectively, in Papadopoulos's political speeches. Some examples examined in the lexicon component are Revolution, distant past, communism, security. Some examples analysed in the medical and biological component are doctor, infection, cells and the plaster cast. Clear correlation can be discerned between certain lexical and figurative preferences and <b>audience</b> <b>composition</b> and/or time of delivery; however, while clear lexical and figurative transitions and shifts are noted over the 6 -year period, his underlying cyclical narrative is consistently present...|$|E
