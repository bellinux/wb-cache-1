5|$|This item, {{consisting}} of one painting and associated caption/text, was originally the third {{scene of the}} Matsudaira clan scroll before being reshaped into a hanging scroll by Masuda Donō in 1933. At some point it was in possession of the Ōkura clan　(大倉家), but it is now owned by the Agency for Cultural Affairs and in custody of the Tokyo National Museum. It was designated an Important Cultural Property on March 31, 1953. Like its preceding and successive scenes (scenes 2 and 3 from the Gotoh edition), the painting depicts the celebration for the 50th day {{of the birth of}} the Imperial Prince Atsuhira-shinnō, the later Emperor Go-Ichijō in the evening of Kankō 5, 11th month, 1st day (December 1, 1008). The main characters <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>full</b> dress in a room decorated with kichō partitioners and the prince's grandfather, Fujiwara no Michinaga at the bottom is offering rice cake (mochi) to the prince in a form of ceremonial ritual. The female servant at the bottom right is presumably the author of the diary Murasaki Shikibu.|$|E

New account books are opened after a pooja. Generally the traders {{do not make}} any payments on that day to preserve Lakshmi in home.

25|$|Public toilets {{are usually}} readily {{available}} all over Japan, {{and can be}} found in department stores, supermarkets, book stores, CD shops, parks, most convenience stores, and in all but the most rural train stations.

Beginning in the 1990s, there has been a movement to make public toilets cleaner and more hospitable than they had been in the past.|$|E

25|$|The major {{denomination}} in Moldova is Eastern Orthodox Christianity. The {{majority of}} Moldovan Orthodox Christians {{belong to the}} Moldovan Orthodox Church, {{a branch of the}} Russian Orthodox Church, while a minority belongs to the Metropolis of Bessarabia, a branch of the Romanian Orthodox Church. Both bodies <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>full</b> communion, the dispute between them being purely territorial and revolves around the legitimate succession of the interwar Metropolitan See of Bessarabia.

25|$|During the {{majority}} of the year caribou roam the tundra in small herds, but twice a year large herds of caribou cross the inland regions. Caribou have excellent senses of smell and hearing so that the hunters must be very careful when in pursuit. Often, Inuit hunters set up camp miles away from the caribou crossing and wait until they <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>full</b> view to attack. There are many ways in which the caribou can be captured, including spearing, forcing caribou into the river, using blinders, scaring the caribou, and stalking the caribou. When spearing caribou, hunters put the string of the spear in their mouths and the other end they use to gently spear the animal.|$|E

To avoid discrimination, some Zainichi Koreans have adopted Japanese names. Today, however, as {{the relationship between}} Japan and South Korea has improved, there also exist many Zainichi Koreans or former Zainichi Koreans with Japanese nationality who do not hide their origin and <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>full</b> activity, such as Yu Miri, an Akutagawa Prize-winning playwright and Tadanari Lee (Lee Chung-Sung), a Japanese football player of Korean origin.|$|E
