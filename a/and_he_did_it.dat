25|$|Going {{into the}} 2008 outdoor season, Tamgho {{achieved}} the Olympic qualifying mark (17.10m) but the tailwind of 2.1 m/s was slightly too strong {{to make his}} jump valid. He did not manage to achieve the requisite mark {{in time for the}} Olympic team selection and it was Colomba Fofana who took the only men's triple jump berth in the 2008 French Olympic team. Tamgho won the 2008 World Junior Championships gold medal with a jump of 17.33m in the final, but the mark was wind-aided (2.1m/s), just outside the legal limit of 2.0m/s. Tamgho was the only athlete to clear the 17m mark in that final, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> thrice.

It was an impressive debut by anyone's standards. Sheene had worked his way up to second place and threatening the leader, Mike Lewis, when the bike seized and spat its rider off over the handlebars. A rostrum position in the day's 250cc race was a great achievement, but an even better wasn’t very far away. Just one week later, and again at Brands, Sheene took his first race win, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> is style by an incredible 12 seconds.

However, as he was developing the plan, Baker had also had {{to take into account}} that Governor Cellucci was dead-set against any new taxes or fees. Former State Transportation Secretary James J.

In 2001, Norman won £30,000 in libel damages from The Sunday Times newspaper, which suggested that Barry was entirely responsible for the composition. The theme, as written by Norman and arranged by Barry, was described by another Bond film composer, David Arnold, as [...] "bebop-swing vibe coupled with that vicious, dark, distorted electric guitar, definitely an instrument of rock 'n' roll... it represented everything about the character you would want: It was cocky, swaggering, confident, dark, dangerous, suggestive, sexy, unstoppable. <b>And</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> in two minutes."

Monty Norman wrote the accompanying soundtrack, which included the [...] "James Bond Theme", heard in the gun barrel sequence and in a calypso medley over the title credits; the theme was described by another Bond film composer, David Arnold, as [...] "bebop-swing vibe coupled with that vicious, dark, distorted electric guitar, definitely an instrument of rock 'n' roll... it represented everything about the character you would want: It was cocky, swaggering, confident, dark, dangerous, suggestive, sexy, unstoppable. <b>And</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> in two minutes".

500|$|Once he and Harding were inaugurated, Herrick made ill-advised {{decisions}} that turned crucial Republican constituencies against him, alienating farmers by opposing {{the establishment of}} an agricultural college. On the other hand, according to Sinclair, [...] "Harding had little to do, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> very well". His responsibility to preside over the state Senate allowed him to increase his growing network of political contacts. Harding and others envisioned a successful gubernatorial run in 1905, but Herrick refused to stand aside. In early 1905, Harding announced he would accept nomination as governor if offered, but faced with the anger of leaders such as Cox, Foraker and Dick (Hanna's replacement in the Senate), announced he would seek no office in 1905. Herrick was defeated, but his new running mate, Andrew L. Harris, was elected, and succeeded as governor after five months in office on the death of Democrat John M. Pattison. One Republican official wrote to Harding, [...] "Aren't you sorry Dick wouldn't let you run for Lieutenant Governor?" ...|$|E

[...] During the 1997 season, when the long-departed Jackie Robinson's number 42 was being retired throughout baseball, and the still-living Doby was being virtually ignored by the media, an editorial in Sports Illustrated pointed out that Doby had to suffer the same indignities that Robinson did, and with nowhere near the media attention and implicit support.

500|$|Monty Norman {{was invited}} to write the soundtrack because Broccoli liked {{his work on the}} 1961 theatre {{production}} Belle, a musical about murderer Hawley Harvey Crippen. Norman was busy with musicals, and only accepted to do the music for Dr. No after Saltzman allowed him to travel along with the crew to Jamaica. The most famous composition in the soundtrack is the [...] "James Bond Theme", which is heard in the gunbarrel sequence and in a calypso medley over the title credits, and was written by Norman based on a previous composition of his. John Barry, who would later go on to compose the music for eleven Bond films, arranged the Bond theme, but was uncredited—except for the credit of his orchestra playing the final piece. It has occasionally been suggested that Barry, not Norman, composed the [...] "James Bond Theme". This argument {{has been the subject of}} two court cases, the most recent in 2001, which found in favour of Norman. The theme, as written by Norman and arranged by Barry, was described by another Bond film composer, David Arnold, as [...] "bebop-swing vibe coupled with that vicious, dark, distorted electric guitar, definitely an instrument of rock 'n' roll... it represented everything about the character you would want: It was cocky, swaggering, confident, dark, dangerous, suggestive, sexy, unstoppable. <b>And</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> in two minutes." ...|$|E
500|$|General Secretary Gorbachev said of {{his former}} rival's Cold War role: [...] " [...] {{a man who was}} {{instrumental}} in bringing {{about the end of the}} Cold War," [...] and deemed him [...] "a great president." [...] Gorbachev does not acknowledge a win or loss in the war, but rather a peaceful end; he said he was not intimidated by Reagan's harsh rhetoric. Margaret Thatcher, former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, said of Reagan, [...] "he warned that the Soviet Union had an insatiable drive for military power... but he also sensed it was being eaten away by systemic failures impossible to reform." [...] She later said, [...] "Ronald Reagan had a higher claim than any other leader to have won the Cold War for liberty <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> without a shot being fired." [...] Said Brian Mulroney, former Prime Minister of Canada: [...] "He enters history as a strong and dramatic player [...]" [...] Former President Lech Wałęsa of Poland acknowledged, [...] "Reagan was one of the world leaders who made a major contribution to communism's collapse." [...] That Reagan had little or no effect in ending the Cold War is argued with equal weight; that Communism's internal weakness had become apparent, and the Soviet Union would have collapsed in the end regardless of who was in power. President Harry S. Truman's policy of containment is also regarded as a force behind the fall of the USSR, and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan undermined the Soviet system itself.|$|E
