25|$|Over time, the {{terminal}} and added concourse began showing its age {{due to its}} layout and poor maintenance, hastened further by increased <b>aircraft</b> <b>traffic,</b> which it was not designed to handle efficiently. Despite this, more gates were added to Concourse C in a short-term expansion project in the early 1990s, making it 26 gates in length. This concourse was considered the worst by most travelers due to its long distance {{from the center of}} {{the terminal}}, and for its length.|$|E

2500|$|With {{the state}} given $994,938in 1960for airport {{improvements}} across Washington, the Omak City Council was granted $12,172for their Omak Airport. A radio navigation aid was {{proposed for the}} Omak Airport around 1961by affiliated city council members because it would increase <b>aircraft</b> <b>traffic</b> according to supporters, although the FAA suggested that nearby city Brewster gain an aid for their local airport: Anderson Field. The former now maintains a navigation aid, while the latter does not. In June1979, a terminal, air traffic controller and fuel tanks containing [...] of jet fuel, 100octanes of general aviation fuel and 6,000octanes of fuel for older aircraft costing approximately $237,000at the Omak Airport began to construct, having completed in August1979; its newly paved runway was [...] at that time. The terminal was dedicated to Arno Hopfer, a former city councilman who positively spoke for the airport when others considered {{it to be a}} stale project; the then-new Okanogan Valley Pilots Association, which is no longer existent, gave it an aircraft presentation on September30, 1979.|$|E

40|$|Asphalt trial mixes for {{rehabilitation}} of the 03 – 21 R runway of Johannesburg International Airport, were constructed after complying with laboratory test criteria. Subsequently, MMLS 3 field testing found rutting performance of the mixes suspect. Gyratory compaction and dynamic creep performances did not predict this. The design process was then reversed by conducting MMLS 3 tests on laboratory compacted briquettes to evaluate field performance. The selected mixes were plant produced, paving trials constructed and cores tested to evaluate performance. Protocols for evaluation were based on performance of full-scale pavements under MMLS 3 field trafficking, and actual performance data of similar pavements under conventional truck trafficking with adaptations for airport trafficking. Follow-up MMLS 3 tests on field cores were conducted to investigate early rutting under <b>aircraft</b> <b>trafficking</b> during hot weather conditions...|$|R

40|$|As part of {{a broader}} {{investigation}} into distress in the asphalt surface layer at a major Australian airport, significant testing was performed on cores taken from both trafficked and un-trafficked zones within two different asphalt mixes. Samples were compared for aggregate orientation, relative density, resilient modulus, wheel tracking, interface shear resistance and cyclic shear creep. There was {{a significant difference between the}} results from the trafficked and un-trafficked samples. It appeared that the changes to the asphalt caused by ‘straight-through’ <b>aircraft</b> <b>trafficking</b> increased the asphalt surface’s resistance to the severe shear forces induced by heavy braking and cornering of aircraft. It is suggested that where operationally practical, the surface should be exposed to frequent and heavy straight-through traffic for as long as possible prior to allowing harsh braking and turning operations. This would reduce the risk of early life horizontal deformations occurring in the heavy braking zones...|$|R

40|$|A {{further study}} {{consisting}} of acoustic and subjective measurements of 552 Chinese firemen at 12 fire stations in Hong Kong {{has been carried}} out. Annoyance with <b>aircraft</b> and <b>traffic</b> noise conditions, as expressed by the firemen, was found to correlate well with the acoustic measurements. For aircraft noise the correlation of annoyance with the Number and Noise Index (NNI) was slightly better than with the dB(A) peak value. For traffic noise the similar correlation with the mean sound pressure levels which exceeds 10 % of the sampling period (L 10) was slightly better than with the Noise Pollution Level and the Traffic Noise Index. The correlation of the arousal due to the <b>aircraft</b> and <b>traffic</b> noise was similarly found {{to depend on the}} NNI and L 10 values. However, traffic noise was responsible for more disturbance than aircraft noise.

40|$|Abstract Background Previous {{research}} suggests that children born prematurely or with a low birth weight are more vulnerable to the mental health effects of ambient neighbourhood noise; predominantly road and rail noise, at home. This study used data from the Road <b>Traffic</b> and <b>Aircraft</b> Noise Exposure and Children's Cognition and Health (RANCH) study {{to see if this}} finding extends to <b>aircraft</b> and road <b>traffic</b> noise at school. Methods Children and their parents from schools around three European airports were selected to represent a range of <b>aircraft</b> and road <b>traffic</b> noise exposure levels. Birth weight and gestation period were merged to create a dichotomous variable assessing 'early biological risk'. Mental health was assessed using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). Complete data were available for 1900 primary school children. Results Children who were 'at risk' (i. e. low birth weight or premature birth) were rated as having more conduct problems and emotional symptoms and poorer overall mental health than children not at risk. However, there was no interaction between <b>aircraft</b> or road <b>traffic</b> noise exposure at school and early biological risk. Conclusions Data from the RANCH study suggests that children with early biological risk are not more vulnerable to the effects of <b>aircraft</b> or road <b>traffic</b> noise at school on mental health than children without this risk; however {{they are more likely to}} have mental ill-health. </p...|$|R
