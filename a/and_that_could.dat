25|$|The Routemaster was {{developed}} between 1947 and 1956 {{by a team}} directed by AAM Durrant and Colin Curtis, with vehicle styling by Douglas Scott. The design brief was to produce a vehicle that was lighter (hence more fuel-efficient), easier to operate <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> be maintained by the existing maintenance practices at the recently opened Aldenham Works, but with easier and lower-cost servicing procedures. The resulting vehicle seated 64 passengers, despite being three-quarters of a ton lighter than buses in the RT family, which seated 56.|$|E
25|$|The factory at Sèvres was nationalized in 1793 {{after the}} French Revolution. After 1800 it stopped {{producing}} soft-paste and standardized on an unusually hard type of hard-paste using china clay from Saint-Yrieix, near Limoges. The factory produced many different painted designs for decoration. Later in the 19th century the art director Théodore Deck (1823–91) introduced manufacture of siliceous soft-paste pieces. The factory could make large objects {{that did not}} crack or split, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> be decorated in rich colors due to the low firing temperature.|$|E

25|$|The major {{competitor}} for the Panorama Elite III was the Duple Dominant launched at the 1972 Commercial Motor Show in London. The Duple was of all steel {{design and}} built at Duple's Blackpool factory. The Dominant had {{many of the}} design cues of the Panorama Elite <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> be because the managing director {{at that time was}} an ex Plaxton employee. The Dominant sold well but never caught up with the Elite. The mere fact that at the 1972 Commercial Motor Show only one Dominant was available due to a long strike at the Blackpool factory couldn't have helped much. The launch of the Dominant was at Lake Garda in Italy and was Duple's most important launch for years.|$|E
25|$|One folk belief {{concerning}} the bakeneko {{is that they}} would lick the oil of oriental lamps, and in the Edo period encyclopedia, the Wakan Sansai Zue, {{it is said that}} for a cat to lick this oil is an omen of some strange event about to occur. People in the early modern period used cheap oils from fish, like sardine oil, in the lamps, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> explain why cats would want to lick them. Also, the diet of Japanese people at that time was based mainly on grains and vegetables, and the leftovers would be fed to the cats. However, since cats are carnivores, such a diet would have been lacking in protein and fat, and therefore they would have been even more attracted to the oil in the lamps. Furthermore, the sight of a cat standing up its hind legs to reach the lamp, with its face lit up and eyes round with anticipation, could have seemed eerie and unnatural, like a yōkai.|$|E

25|$|Development of the 959 (originally {{called the}} Gruppe B) started in 1981, {{shortly after the}} company's then-new Managing Director, Peter Schutz, took his office. Porsche's head {{engineer}} at the time, Helmuth Bott, approached Schutz with some ideas about the Porsche 911, or more aptly, a new one. Bott knew that the company needed a sports car that they could continue to rely on {{for years to come}} <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> be developed as time went on. Curious as to how much they could do with the rear-engined 911, Bott convinced Schutz that development tests should take place, and even proposed researching a new all wheel drive system. Schutz agreed, and gave the project the green light. Bott also knew through experience that a racing program usually helped to accelerate the development of new models. Seeing Group B rally racing as the perfect arena to test the new mule and its all wheel drive system, Bott again went to Schutz and got the go ahead to develop a car, based on his development mule, for competition in Group B.|$|E
25|$|The {{seats of}} the disqualified Senators were filled by countbacks of the 2016 Senate {{election}} results in their states of Western Australia, Queensland and New South Wales. The countback results were announced on 10 November: in Western Australia, the Greens' Scott Ludlam {{was replaced by}} Jordon Steele-John; in Queensland, the Greens' Larissa Waters was replaced by former Australian Democrats leader Andrew Bartlett and One Nation's Malcolm Roberts was replaced by Fraser Anning. However, the court has delayed the appointment of Nationals' Fiona Nash's replacement Liberal Hollie Hughes due to concerns that Hughes may also be ineligible under s 44(iv) of the Constitution as a holder of an office of profit under the Crown, due to her reappointment to the Administrative Appeal Tribunal in the period following her apparent election defeat. If Hughes is found to not {{be eligible for the}} vacant Senate post, the spot could be filled by former general Jim Molan, who was a Liberal candidate at the 2016 election. But according to constitutional law professor George Williams, as Hughes was a valid candidate {{at the time of the}} July 2, 2016 election, if the High Court rules her out then a casual vacancy would be created <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> be filled as such, including by Nash.|$|E
25|$|In 1985, Yuji Horii and {{his team}} at Chunsoft began {{production}} on Dragon Quest (Dragon Warrior). After Enix published the game in early 1986, it became the template for future console RPGs. The game {{was influenced by the}} first-person random battles in Wizardry, the overhead movement in , and the mystery storytelling in Horii's own 1983 visual novel game Portopia Serial Murder Case. Horii's intention behind Dragon Quest was to create a RPG that appeals to a wider audience unfamiliar with the genre or video games in general. This required {{the creation of a new}} kind of RPG, that didn't rely on previous D experience, didn't require hundreds of hours of rote fighting, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> appeal to any kind of gamer. Compared to statistics-heavy computer RPGs, Dragon Quest was a more streamlined, faster-paced game based on exploration and combat, and featured a top-down view in dungeons, in contrast to the first-person view used for dungeons in earlier computer RPGs. The streamlined gameplay of Dragon Quest thus made the game more accessible to a wider audience than previous computer RPGs. The game also placed a greater emphasis on storytelling and emotional involvement, building on Horii's previous work Portopia Serial Murder Case, but this time introducing a coming of age tale for Dragon Quest that audiences could relate to, making use of the RPG level-building gameplay as a way to represent this. It also featured elements still found in most console RPGs, like major quests interwoven with minor subquests, an incremental spell system, the damsel-in-distress storyline that many RPGs follow, and a romance element that remains a staple of the genre, alongside anime-style art by Akira Toriyama and a classical score by Koichi Sugiyama that was considered revolutionary for console video game music.|$|E
