500|$|Fry and Dickinson flew to New York with promotional {{copies and}} met {{employees}} {{of a number}} of record labels, but could not generate interest in the album. When a similar promotion attempt failed in California, the album was shelved as it was considered not commercial enough for release. Fry recalled, [...] "We'd go in and play it <b>and</b> <b>these</b> <b>guys</b> would look at us like we were crazy". In late 1974, before the album was even named, the band broke up, bringing Big Star's first era to its end. Dickinson later said that he was [...] "nailed for indulging Alex on Big Star Third, but I think {{it is important that the}} artist is enabled to perform with integrity. What I did for Alex was literally remove the yoke of oppressive production that he had been under since the first time he ever uttered a word into a microphone, for good or ill." ...|$|E

When Carey and Boyz II Men got together to record [...] "One Sweet Day", {{they did not have}} enough time to re-unite and film a video. Instead, a filming crew was present during the song's recording, and filmed bits of Carey and Boyz recording the song. Walter Afanasieff later told Fred Bronson that shooting the video was [...] "crazy", stating [...] "They had film crews and video guys, while I'm at the board trying to produce. <b>And</b> <b>these</b> <b>guys</b> were running around having a ball, because Mariah and them are laughing and screaming and they're being interviewed.

[...] After the song's release, Carey expressed her content with the video. that she was happy a real music video was never filmed, fearing that no video could truly capture the song's [...] "precious message". Critics agreed, feeling that the song was a perfect match for the video and its message. Aside from the recording sessions, the video also shared bits of Carey and Boyz bonding and sharing their ideas in the studio, where Carey felt they [...] "bonded".|$|E
500|$|In 2010, Torres {{began the}} season as a backup outfielder again. On April 25, he {{replaced}} Eugenio Vélez (who had been filling in for the injured Aaron Rowand) as the Giants' center fielder, playing six games until Rowand's return on May 1. Upon Rowand's return, Torres returned to a reserve role until May 9, {{when he became a}} starting outfielder {{for the rest of the}} season after Mark DeRosa hurt his wrist.

5000|$|Tumatoe {{performed}} the songs weekly on air, {{and though they}} were a hit with fans, {{some of the players}} and coaches took umbrage to his lyrics, especially when Tumatoe couldn’t resist taking a dig. On a few different occasions, Tumatoe barely avoided physical altercations initiated by drunken quarterbacks or angry coaches. Says Tumatoe, “I think people miss a basic thing about the blues, and I don’t understand why they don’t get it. Blues is a light-hearted music. They’re stories that make fun of what goes on in your life. Don’t get me wrong, I’m a football fan. I enjoy these games. I watch them all. But the premise of all these guys getting {{millions and millions of dollars}} to play a kids’ game is in and of itself not serious.
