25|$|Living in Chadderton, Greater Manchester, Rachel Bailey is {{a detective}} constable on Syndicate 9, the Major Incident Team for Manchester Metropolitan Police. Upon the {{beginning}} of the first series, her lawyer boyfriend, Nicholas Savage (Rupert Graves), is revealed to be a philanderer, married with two sons in Wilmslow. Rachel, jeopardising her career, uses the Police National Computer (PNC) to locate the address his vehicle is registered to. Meanwhile, she discovers that she is pregnant with his child. Discovering his whereabouts, she reveals to Nick her plans to terminate her pregnancy and proceeds to blackmail him into allowing her to stay in his city centre apartment for free. Her personal and professional life becomes entangled when Savage is the defence barrister for Georgios Stelikos, a man on trial for murder and rape, at which Rachel has to give evidence. Savage uses information Rachel told him to his advantage, to which she denies. She later confides to Janet she perjured herself in court and that she had discussed details of the case to Nick. The jury finds Stelikos innocent, though the evidence points to the opposite. Savage, also upon seeing Rachel, realises that she has not gone through with the abortion, however, she later suffers a miscarriage. Nick's wife discovers his affair and telephones DCI Gill Murray (Amelia Bullmore), Rachel's boss. Murray quizzes Rachel regarding her relationship and whether it caused the collapse of the Stelikos case. She, taking Janet's advice, flatly denies the accusation. As Nick's wife knows of the affair, he evicts her from his apartment, as she has nothing to use against him. As there is no room <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>sister</b> Alison's (Sally Lindsay) home, stays with Janet until she can return to her old property.|$|E
500|$|Before Christmas in 1972, {{she met the}} then-divorced Cynthia at {{the funeral}} of Mimi's sister, Harriet, in Liverpool. Mimi sternly criticised Cynthia for divorcing Lennon—and letting him start a {{relationship}} with Yoko Ono—by saying she should have stopped him from making [...] "an idiot of himself". Even though Mimi was described as domineering, Ono later compared herself to her when describing her own relationship with Lennon. She later admitted that Ono was a good wife and mother. After Lennon's death, Ono and Sean Lennon visited Mimi in Liverpool, where she was staying <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>sister</b> Anne's house because of a heart condition. She said, [...] "Sean is like John in every way—looks and manner—and he has got John's sense of humour. As long as he keeps away from music, he will be all right".|$|E

2500|$|One Kennedy family biographer termed her [...] "absolutely beautiful" [...] with [...] "a {{gorgeous}} smile." [...] At twenty, she was [...] "a picturesque young woman, a snow princess with flush cheeks, gleaming smile, plump figure, and a sweetly ingratiating {{manner to}} almost everyone she met." [...] She enjoyed dancing, such as <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>sister</b> Kathleen's coming-out party. Kennedy's parents told Woman's Day {{that she was}} [...] "studying to be a kindergarten teacher," [...] and Parents was told that while she had [...] "an interest in social welfare work, {{she is said to}} harbor a secret longing to go on the stage." [...] The Boston Globe wrote requesting an interview which was refused, but her father's assistant Eddie Moore prepared a response, which Rosemary copied out laboriously, letter by letter: ...|$|E
2500|$|Kerry [...] "Care Bear" [...] Hennessy, {{portrayed by}} Amy Davidson, {{is the middle}} child, but is not very happy about it. She is often seen as unattractive when {{compared}} to her beautiful older sister, Bridget. She was accused by Bridget of stealing her (ex-) boyfriend, Kyle, though clearly Bridget's actions drove Kyle away. Kerry is sarcastic, often making snide remarks about essentially everybody, though less to her mother. She is also a passionate activist who cares about animal rights. She lost her virginity to Bruno (her boyfriend in Europe) later in the third season. She is often annoyed <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>sister</b> and is easily upset, yet frequently the two girls team up against their parents' authority or {{at the expense of}} their younger rascal brother. Kerry is also very artistic and keeps a sketchbook. She is the smart child, but often shows naiveté. After she starts dating Bridget's popular ex-boyfriend Kyle, her own popularity increases, and she begins to act a little more like her older sister.|$|E
2500|$|Kate (1844–1924) was {{the first}} of the Terry {{children}} to make the family name famous on the English stage, beginning her career as a small child. According to the academic Nina Auerbach, Kate may have been the most accomplished actor among her siblings, quickly gaining praise in the plays of Shakespeare, among others. Contemporary critics thought the same: The Manchester Guardian ended its report of her last performance before her retirement: [...] "In our unwilling acceptance of her farewell, we must now rest satisfied with the memory of the peerless beauty of her merry-hearted acting ... like the music of a bewitching melody piercing the stillness of the night, and ending just when the ear longed for the next note." [...] She gave up acting when she married the businessman Arthur James Lewis (1824–1901) in 1867 when she was 23. She made only two later stage appearances, the first in 1898, in a small role supporting her daughter Mabel in a new play in the West End; the second was in 1906 <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>sister</b> Ellen's jubilee celebrations at Drury Lane. Of her four children, all daughters, only the youngest, Mabel, followed her into the theatrical profession. The two middle daughters were Janet and Lucy. Kate's eldest daughter, also named Kate, married Frank Gielgud; their four children included Val and John Gielgud.|$|E
