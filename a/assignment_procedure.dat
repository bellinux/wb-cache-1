That’s the reason why this write up on paging looks too interwoven and cross refers to too many things. But the plus point with paging is by the time paging success rate in a network gets improved; almost all the other KPIs too stand improved. In response to an incoming call, the MSC initiates the paging process by broadcasting a [...] "paging request" [...] message on the paging sub channel (IMSI or TMSI of the MS and its Paging Group) and starts timer T3113. A [...] "paging message" [...] consists of the mobile identity (IMSI or TMSI) of the MS being paged and its [...] "paging group number". A Paging Request Message may include more than one MS identification. The maximum number of paged MS per message is 4 when using [...] "TMSI" [...] for identification of the MS (maximum number of paged MS per message is 2 when using IMSI). The BSC receives this page and processes the paging request and schedules it for transmission on the PCH at appropriate time. The MS on its part will analyse the paging messages (and immediate assignment messages) sent on the paging sub channel corresponding to its paging group.

The robotic assembly line balancing (RALB) problem is defined for robotic assembly line, where different robots may be assigned to the assembly tasks, and each robot needs different assembly times to perform a given task, because of its capabilities and specialization. The solution to the RALB problem includes an attempt for optimal assignment of robots to line stations and a balanced distribution of work between different stations. It aims at maximizing the production rate of the line. A genetic algorithm (GA) is used to find a solution to this problem. Two different procedures for adapting the GA to the RALB problem, by assigning robots with different capabilities to workstations are introduced: a recursive <b>assignment</b> <b>procedure</b> and a consecutive <b>assignment</b> <b>procedure.</b> The results of the GA are improved by a local optimization (hill climbing) work-piece exchange procedure.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to identify the relationships between activity patterns and route choice decisions. The focus is turned to the relationship between the purpose of a trip and the road categories used for the relocation. The data for this study were collected in 2006 and 2007 in Flanders, the Dutch speaking and northern part of Belgium. To estimate the relationship between he primary road category traveled on and the corresponding activity-travel behavior a multinomial logit model is developed. The results point out that route choice is a function of multiple factors, not just travel time or distance. Crucial for modeling route choices or in general for traffic <b>assignment</b> <b>procedures</b> is the conclusion that activity patterns have a clear influence on the road category primarily driven on. Particularly, it was shown that the likelihood of taking primarily through roads is highest for work trips and lowest for leisure trips.

In addition, it was shown that route choices were similar during peak and off-peak periods. This is an indication that car drivers are not necessarily utility maximizers.
