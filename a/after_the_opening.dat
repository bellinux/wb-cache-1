Currently, commuters are charged a second time when they make such transfers. He added that the Public Transport Council (PTC) will review distance-based fare transfer rules to ensure they continue to facilitate “fast, seamless” public transport journeys. The review of distance-based fare rules on MRT lines {{is expected to be}} completed in the first quarter in 2018.|$|E
5|$|<b>After</b> <b>the</b> <b>opening</b> up of China {{from the}} 1980s, tomb robbery was rampant and many {{artifacts}} were looted and smuggled {{across the border}} to Hong Kong, then a British territory.

On February 17, 2005, J-Air realized its dream and relocated to its new home at Nagoya Airfield. In order to strengthen the recognition of the JAL brand and improve customer convenience, the airline disposed its own flight numbers and changed to JAL flight numbers from April 1, 2005.|$|E

5|$|During {{the coming}} decades, however, the {{suitability}} of the tower {{for the work of}} the department came into question. The condition of the roof remained problematic, and steel girders had to be added to support the main timbers. Increasing traffic levels around the tower led to subsidence and high levels of vibration, effecting the operation of the delicate instruments, and worsened <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>opening</b> of Lambeth Bridge in 1932. Some of the department's work was transferred to their Bushy House facility in Teddington in the 1920s, and in 1938 the department relinquished the tower altogether.|$|E
5|$|Electric {{lighting}} {{was provided}} to illuminate the new road, but for one year <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>opening</b> the lights were kept switched off following objections from river pilots who argued that they would {{make it hard to}} distinguish the navigation lights of shipping and the signal lights on the shore. Eventually the electric lights were turned on at a reduced brilliance.|$|E

This blurring of the subjective and objective returns in the final scene.|$|E

5|$|Initially {{the railway}} was worked by GWR broad-gauge Metropolitan Class steam {{locomotives}} and rolling stock. Soon <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>opening</b> disagreement arose between the Met and the GWR over {{the need to}} increase the frequency, and the GWR withdrew its stock in August 1863.
