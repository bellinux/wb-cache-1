5|$|Both Crex crakes {{are mainly}} active during the day, {{especially}} at dawn, dusk, during light rain, or after heavier rain. The African crake is less skulking {{and easier to}} flush from cover than other crakes, and is often seen {{at the edges of}} roads and tracks, but the corn crake is <b>a</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> bird to see in its breeding sites, usually being hidden by vegetation and rarely emerging into the open. Both crakes are territorial on both the breeding and non-breeding grounds; the male threat displays involves the bird standing upright and spreading the feathers of the wings, flanks and belly like a fan. Fighting at territorial boundaries involves the male birds jumping at each other and pecking.|$|E
5|$|Communications signals {{can be sent}} {{either by}} analog signals or digital signals. There are analog {{communication}} systems and digital communication systems. For an analog signal, the signal is varied continuously {{with respect to the}} information. In a digital signal, the information is encoded as a set of discrete values (for example, a set of ones and zeros). During the propagation and reception, the information contained in analog signals will inevitably be degraded by undesirable physical noise. (The output of a transmitter is noise-free for all practical purposes.) Commonly, the noise in a communication system can be expressed as adding or subtracting from the desirable signal in a completely random way. This form of noise is called additive noise, with the understanding that the noise can be negative or positive at different instants of time. Noise that is not additive noise is <b>a</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> situation to describe or analyze, and these other kinds of noise will be omitted here.|$|E

Aerobraking, however, has become <b>a</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> method of velocity reduction since the full 1.0 release due to improved aerodynamics and optional heating during atmospheric entry.

For example, it is still not known whether S6 admits an integrable almost complex structure, despite a long history of ultimately unverified claims. Smoothness issues are important.

The Burmese command finally gave up, and the armies left Vientiane on 1 August 1565. They had installed a son-in-law of Setthathirath as vassal king.

25|$|Single-mother and lower-class {{families}} have <b>a</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> time negotiating childcare or finding sustainable childcare options. The breadwinner-homemaker family and economic model {{does not apply}} to single-parent families because the single-parent must be both roles at all times. Because child care services cost a substantial amount, low-income mothers spend a higher percentage of their income on child care than middle class mothers do.

Another explanation is that individual sounds do not easily translate into beats, which makes clapping individual phonemes <b>a</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> task than clapping syllables.

25|$|The {{number and}} nature of the post-oral {{segments}} in the insect head have rarely been questioned. <b>A</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> area, however, has been the nature of the preoral region. The obvious contradiction between a theory that no-preoral structures are segmental, and evidence, such as for the first antennae of crustaceans, that some such structures clearly are, led workers as long ago as Lankester to posit that there has been forward migration of segments in front of the mouth. Indeed, such a process can be seen in ontogeny of the tritocerebrum, which can be seen to migrate forward as the brain develops; furthermore, although in most insects and crustaceans its ganglia are part of the brain, its commissures still loop behind it, suggesting derivation from a more posterior position.|$|E

Both of their starting running backs from the previous year, future Pro Football Hall of Famers Paul Hornung and Jim Taylor, had left the team. Their replacements, Elijah Pitts and Jim Grabowski, were both injured early in the season, forcing Green Bay coach Vince Lombardi to use veteran reserve running back Donny Anderson and rookie Travis Williams. Fullbacks Chuck Mercein and Ben Wilson, who were signed as free agents after being discarded by many other teams, were also used to help compensate for the loss of Hornung and Taylor. Meanwhile, the team's 33-year-old veteran quarterback Bart Starr had missed 4 games during the season with injuries, and finished the season with nearly twice as many interceptions (17) as touchdown passes (9).|$|E
25|$|Spetsnaz units {{conducted}} numerous air-assault missions {{throughout the}} war, including ambushes and raids. The Spetsnaz often conducted missions to ambush and destroy enemy supply-convoys.

They said that the Spetsnaz-led air assault missions had changed the complexion of the war. They also credited the Spetsnaz with closing down all the supply routes along the Afghan-Pakistani border in 1986. In April 1986 the rebels lost one of their biggest bases, at Zhawar in Paktia Province, to a Soviet Spetsnaz air-assault. The Spetsnaz achieved victory by knocking out several rebel positions above the base, a mile-long series of fortified caves in a remote canyon.
