Yesterday and last night the sick were arriving here in long trains, all day and night. I was among the new-comers most of the night. One train of a thousand came into the depot, and others followed.

My supervisor, Simon Laughlin, provided much encouragement as well as a seemingly endless stream of inspiring ideas.

Rob Harris checked most of my mathematical ideas and lent me the music which kept me company <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>this</b> thesis.

60|$|Huge {{and mighty}} are our days, our republican lands--and most in their rapid shiftings, their changes, {{all in the}} {{interest}} of the cause. <b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>write</b> <b>this</b> particular passage, (November, 1868,) the din of disputation rages around me. Acrid the temper of the parties, vital the pending questions. Congress convenes; the President sends his message; reconstruction is still in abeyance; the nomination and the contest for the twenty-first Presidentiad draw close, with loudest threat and bustle. Of these, and all the like of these, the eventuations I know not; but well I know that behind them, and whatever their eventuations, the vital things remain safe and certain, and all the needed work goes on. Time, with soon or later superciliousness, disposes of Presidents, Congressmen, party platforms, and such. Anon, it clears the stage of each and any mortal shred that thinks itself so potent to its day; and at and after which, (with precious, golden exceptions once or twice in a century,) all that relates to sir potency is flung to moulder in a burial-vault, and no one bothers himself the least bit about it afterward.

I think I commenced my quarrels with the authorities there by having in my possession a watch which was always ten minutes late. I know that I very soon achieved a character for irregularity, and came to be regarded as a black sheep by men around me who were not themselves, I think, very good public servants. From time to time rumours reached me that if I did not take care I should be dismissed; especially one rumour in my early days, through my dearly beloved friend Mrs. Clayton Freeling,--who, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>write</b> <b>this,</b> is still living, and who, with tears in her eyes, besought me to think of my mother. That was during the life of Sir Francis Freeling, who died,--still in harness,--a little more than twelve months after I joined the office. And yet the old man showed me signs of almost affectionate kindness, writing to me with his own hand more than once from his death-bed.|$|E

And yet I smile <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>write</b> <b>this,</b> realizing full well that my strange and foreign surroundings and my unforeseen adventure had much to do with my state of mind. The lady in the miniature might have been eighteen, or thirty-five. Her features were of the clearest cut, the nose the least trifle aquiline, and by a blurred outline the painter had given to the black hair piled high upon the head a suggestion of waviness. The eyebrows were straight, the brown eyes looked at the world with an almost scornful sense of humor, and I marked that there was determination in the chin. Here was a face that could be infinitely haughty or infinitely tender, a mouth of witty--nay, perhaps cutting--repartee of brevity and force. A lady who spoke quickly, moved quickly, or reposed absolutely. A person who commanded by nature and yet (dare I venture the thought?) was capable of a supreme surrender. I was aroused from this odd revery by footsteps on the gallery, and Nick burst into the room. Without pausing to look about him, he flung himself lengthwise on the bed on top of the mosquito bar.|$|E

She was all right in every particular, they said, except that I'd never be able to run her before it in a stiff wind and sea. [...] "Her lines," [...] they explained enigmatically, [...] "it is the fault of her lines. She simply cannot be made to run, that is all." [...] Well, I wish I'd only had those crack sailors of the Bohemian Club on board the Snark the other night for them to see for themselves their one, vital, unanimous judgment absolutely reversed. Run? It is the one thing the Snark does to perfection. Run? She ran with a sea-anchor fast for'ard and a full mizzen flattened down aft. Run? At the present moment, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>write</b> <b>this,</b> we are bowling along before it, at a six-knot clip, in the north-east trades. Quite a tidy bit of sea is running. There is nobody at the wheel, the wheel is not even lashed and is set over a half-spoke weather helm. To be precise, the wind is north-east; the Snark's mizzen is furled, her mainsail is over to starboard, her head-sheets are hauled flat: and the Snark's course is south-south-west. And yet there are men who have sailed the seas for forty years and who hold that no boat can run before it without being steered.

40|$|The day Stephen Shapiro’s {{photographic}} study Bowie (2016) was published, I hastily took a snap {{to promote}} my good taste on social media. My phone’s camera spilled light across Shapiro’s beautiful cover, trapping my own reflection, a dark shape that by chance aligned perfectly with {{the shadow of}} Bowie cast by professional lighting. The serendipity became clear later that day <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>this</b> proposal deliberating on the uncanny “anti-narcissistic form of self-reflection” (Boym, 2001) that media offers fans. Fan Studies vacillates between theorising fans as media-consumers (Sandvoss, 2005), active users (Duffett, 2013) and projecting identity onto it (Gee, 2003) tending to frame the interaction around an active/passive reader dynamic (per Barthes, 1998). However, my aim is to identify and explore media as reflecting back {{the image of the}} fan at the moment of their most enchanted engagement with the fan object. I begin by outlining the concepts of remediation (Bolter and Grusin 2000) and seriality (repetition-with-variation or difference as per Deleuze 1994 and différance Derrida 1982) seeing Bowie as both mediated and media. This conceit is made possible via McLuhan’s claim that the medium is the message (1999) and, tangentially, through Colin Wilson’s claim that Bowie is a medium (Blanks, 2016). I then identify how Bowie-related media function as memory sites, looking at media-specific monuments as well as intermedial and remedial morphing between music papers, film, records and fan interactions. Finally, I explore the notion of media-as-mirror, one developed from Holmes’ observation of photography as “the mirror with a memory” (quoted in Ruchatz, 2010), Holdsworth’s account of domestic television as a black mirror (2011), and my own work on fan memories as augmented by intersensual listening experiences with Bowie (October, 2015 b). The character of Thomas Jerome Newton from The Man Who Fell to Earth (Roeg, 1976) is a cipher for these ideas, glancing ‘himself’ differently through multiple television screens (October, 2015 a) and re-emerging as Lazarus (2016). That Bowie could not let go of this character is evidenced by Shapiro’s photographic remediation of the film, and through fan reflection, one that engenders further reflections and serialit...|$|R
