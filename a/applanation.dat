25|$|Two {{types of}} A-scan {{ultrasound}} biometry {{are currently in}} use. The first is contact <b>applanation</b> biometry. This technique requires placing an ultrasound probe on the central cornea. While this is a convenient way to determine the axial length for most normal eyes, errors in measurement almost invariably result from the probe indenting the cornea and shallowing the anterior chamber. Since the compression error is variable, it cannot be compensated for by a constant. IOL power calculations using these measurements will lead to an overestimation of the IOL power. In shorter eyes, this effect is amplified. The second type is immersion A-scan biometry, which requires placing a saline filled scleral shell between the probe and the eye. Since the probe does not exert direct pressure on the cornea, compression of the anterior chamber is avoided. A mean shortening of 0.25–0.33mm has been reported between <b>applanation</b> and immersion axial length measurements, which can translate into an error of IOL power by approximately 1 D. In general, immersion biometry {{has been shown to}} be more accurate than contact <b>applanation</b> biometry in several studies. The main limitation with the A-scan ultrasound is the poor image resolution due to the use of a relatively long, low-resolution wavelength (10MHz) to measure a relatively short distance. In addition, variations in retinal thickness surrounding the fovea contribute to inconsistency in the final measurement.|$|E
2500|$|The {{association}} of elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) and the eye disease glaucoma was first described by Englishman Richard Bannister in 1622: [...] "...that the Eye be grown more solid and hard, then naturally it should be...". Angle-closure glaucoma {{was treated with}} cataract extraction by John Collins Warren in Boston as early as 1806. [...] The invention of the ophthalmoscope by Hermann Helmholtz in 1851 enabled ophthalmologists {{for the first time}} to identify the pathological hallmark of glaucoma, the excavation of the optic nerve head due to retinal ganglion cell loss. The first reliable instrument to measure intraocular pressure was invented by Norwegian ophthalmologist Hjalmar August Schiøtz in 1905. About half a century later, Hans Goldmann in Berne, Switzerland, developed his <b>applanation</b> tonometer which still today - despite numerous new innovations in diagnostics - is considered the gold standard of determining this crucial pathogenic factor. In the late 20th century, further pathomechanisms beyond elevated IOP were discovered and became the subject of research like insufficient blood supply – often associated with low or irregular blood pressure – to the retina and optic nerve head.|$|E

50|$|Goldmann <b>Applanation</b> Tonometer is an {{instrument}} {{that is based on}} Imbert-Fick law. It is considered to be the gold standard instrument for measurement of Intraocular pressure (IOP).|$|E
5000|$|Dynamic contour {{tonometry}} (DCT) {{uses the}} principle of contour matching instead of <b>applanation.</b> The tip contains a hollow the same shape as the cornea with a miniature pressure sensor in its centre. In contrast to <b>applanation</b> tonometry {{it is designed to}} avoid deforming the cornea during measurement and is therefore thought to be less influenced by corneal thickness and other biomechanical properties of the cornea than other methods but because the tip shape is designed for the shape of a normal cornea, it is more influenced by corneal curvature.|$|E
50|$|Non-contact {{tonometry}} (or air-puff tonometry) {{is different}} from pneumatonometry and was invented by Bernard Grolman of Reichert, Inc (formerly American Optical). It uses a rapid air pulse to applanate (flatten) the cornea. Corneal <b>applanation</b> is detected via an electro-optical system. Intraocular pressure is estimated by detecting {{the force of the}} air jet at the instance of <b>applanation.</b> Historically, non-contact tonometers were not considered to be an accurate way to measure IOP but instead a fast and simple way to screen for high IOP. However, modern non-contact tonometers have been shown to correlate well with Goldmann tonometry measurements and are particularly useful for measuring IOP in children and other non-compliant patient groups.|$|E
50|$|The Perkins {{tonometer}} {{is a type}} {{of portable}} <b>applanation</b> tonometer, which may be useful in children, anesthetised patients who need to lie flat, or patients unable to co-operate with a sitting slit lamp examination, that yields clinical results comparable to the Goldmann.|$|E

50|$|Huntly Millar's {{contributions}} to the non-invasive measurement of pulse pressure are well known. Michael F.

These catheter-tipped manometers made possible depiction of the changes in pulse pressure waveforms with age.|$|E
5000|$|He was {{the author}} of 74 medical papers, many of which {{concerned}} the eye's aqueous humor. He was also interested in uveitis; in 1964 he listed 130 different diseases in which uveitis may happen. The eponymous [...] "Amsler-Verrey sign" [...] bears his name; being defined as bleeding caused by <b>applanation</b> tonometry and cataract surgery in patients with Fuchs heterochromic iridocyclitis.|$|E
5000|$|In <b>applanation</b> {{tonometry}} the {{intraocular pressure}} (IOP) is inferred {{from the force}} required to flatten (applanate) a constant area of the cornea, for the Imbert-Fick law. The Maklakoff tonometer was an early example of this method, while the Goldmann tonometer is {{the most widely used}} version in current practice. [...] Because the probe makes contact with the cornea, a topical anesthetic, such as proxymetacaine, is introduced on {{to the surface of the}} eye in the form of an eye drop.|$|E
50|$|Goldmann <b>applanation</b> {{tonometer}} {{is based}} on theImbert-Fick principle, which states that for a dry thin-walled sphere, the pressure (P) inside the sphere equals the force (F) necessary to flatten its surface divided by the area (A) of flattening (i.e. P = F/A). It applies to surfaces which are perfectly spherical, dry, flexible, elastic and infinitely thin.Theoretically, average corneal rigidity (taken as 520 μm for GAT) and the capillary attraction of the tear meniscus {{cancel each other out}} when the flattened area has the 3.06 mm diameter contact surface of the Goldmann prism, which is applied to the cornea using the Goldmann tonometer with a measurable amount of force from which the IOP is deduced.|$|E
5000|$|Meanwhile, he {{continued}} to advance his research in refractive keratoplasty in his private home laboratory; in 1958 he published Method for cutting lamellar grafts in frozen corneas, new orientation for refractive surgery http://www.institutobarraquer.com/library/wp-content/Barraquer/Method%20for%20cutting%20lamellar%20grafts%20in%20frozen%20corneas.pdf and Cinematography of ocular operations http://www.institutobarraquer.com/library/wp-content/Barraquer/Cinematography%20of%20ocular%20operations.pdf. In the mean time between 1962 and 1964 he designed and hand made several precision surgical instruments including the “Microkeratome”, the“Neumatic fixation rings”, “the <b>applanation</b> tonometers” “the <b>applanation</b> lenses” to measure {{the diameter of the}} resection made with the microkeratome, and perfectioned “the Lathe to cut spherical surfaces”. In 1963 he published Two level keratoplasty http://www.institutobarraquer.com/library/wp-content/Barraquer/Two%20level%20keratoplasty.pdf,Modification of corneal refraction by means of intracorneal inclusions http://www.institutobarraquer.com/library/wp-content/Barraquer/Modificación%20de%20la%20refracción%20por%20medio%20de%20inclusiones%20intracorneales.pdf.

In 1965 he published 19 articles including “Our approach in Pterigium surgery” explaining the free conjunctival graft technique; The corneo-conjuntival limbal reconstruction before a corneal transplant in which {{for the first time a}} graft of limbus tissue was recommended, and Foundations of Refractive Keratoplasty http://www.institutobarraquer.com/library/wp-content/Barraquer/Bases%20de%20la%20Queratoplastia%20Refractiva.pdf with a foreword dedicated to his father, where he explains all his research, findings, the microkeratome and the surgical technique of Keratomileusis and Keratophakia. In this article he explains [...] "The Law of Thickness'" [...] discovered through his research work, and that is nowadays the foundation of LASIK (Laser assisted Keratomileusis) and of every corneal refractive technique that is being performed worldwide. [...] In 1967 he published A new operating microscope for ocular surgery http://www.institutobarraquer.com/library/wp-content/Barraquer/A%20new%20operating%20microscope%20for%20ocular%20surgery.pdf describing a microscope developed jointly with his brother Joaquin Barraquer Moner and the physicist Hans Littmann from Zeiss.

Methods: Sixty eyes from 60 subjects (30 men and 30 women) aged 22 &plusmn; 1 (range 20 &ndash; 24) years participated in this study. Triplicate intraocular pressure measurement of a randomly selected eye was obtained by a noncontact tonometer in a handheld and slit lamp-mounted position in a randomized order, with the Goldmann <b>applanation</b> tonometer always performed last. A second measurement session was carried out after one week to assess repeatability. Results: The mean &plusmn; standard deviation of intraocular pressure readings in the first and second session, respectively, with the three techniques were: handheld position, 14. 52 &plusmn; 3. 28 mmHg and 15. 26 &plusmn; 2. 11 mmHg; slit lamp-mounted position, 14. 01 &plusmn; 2. 80 mmHg and 15. 16 &plusmn; 2. 34 mmHg; and Goldmann <b>applanation</b> tonometer, 14. 86 &plusmn; 3. 26 mmHg and 15. 16 &plusmn; 2. 42 mmHg. There were no significant differences (P &gt; 0. 05) between the techniques in the intraocular pressure measurements returned (Goldmann <b>applanation</b> tonometer vs handheld and Goldmann <b>applanation</b> tonometer vs slit lamp-mounted). The Goldmann <b>applanation</b> tonometer measured intraocular pressure 0. 34 mmHg higher than handheld and 0. 85 mmHg higher than slit lamp-mounted in session 1, and in session 2 Goldmann <b>applanation</b> tonometer intraocular pressure measurement was the same as with the slit lamp-mounted method but lower than with the handheld method by 0. 11 mmHg. In PT 100 handheld vs slit lamp-mounted comparisons, there were no significant differences (P &gt; 0. 05) between intraocular pressure measurements returned by both techniques in sessions 1 and 2. Intrasession and intersession repeatability coefficients for Goldmann <b>applanation</b> tonometer intraocular pressure and slit lamp-mounted intraocular pressure were similar, and better in comparison with those for handheld intraocular pressure. Conclusion: The Goldmann <b>applanation</b> tonometer and PT 100 noncontact tonometer in both positions studied here are reliable, consistent techniques for measurement of intraocular pressure, and can be used interchangeably for obtaining intraocular pressure values in young normal subjects. Repositioning of the PT 100 tonometer from hand-held to slit lamp-mounted improved its precision and reduced variation with respect to the Goldmann <b>applanation</b> tonometer.

Methods: 100 eyes of 100 patients underwent Perkins and Goldmann <b>applanation</b> tonometry, with a randomized order of modality, {{performed by a}} masked observer. The right eye was measured, for all subjects, and the data used in statistical analysis. The comparability of results given by the two instruments was evaluated using the Bland–Altman method. Results: IOP measurements for 100 eyes were obtained (range: 10 – 44 mmHg). The mean GAT reading was 21. 63 mmHg, with standard deviation (SD) 5. 69 mmHg. The mean PAT reading was 21. 40 mmHg, with SD 5. 67 mmHg. The mean difference between readings from Goldmann versus Perkins tonometry was 0. 22 mmHg (SD: 0. 44 mmHg). The limits of agreement were calculated to be - 0. 64 –+ 1. 08 mmHg (1. 96 SD {{either side of the}} bias). Conclusion: The Perkins <b>applanation</b> tonometer yields IOP measurements that are closely comparable with GAT. Therefore, PAT may be used in routine clinical practice, as part of the implementation of national guidelines, or preferred practice patterns, for glaucoma and ocular hypertension.

40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} {{the accuracy of}} and to establish reference values for a rebound tonometer (Tonovet) in normal feline eyes, to compare it with an <b>applanation</b> tonometer (Tonopen Vet) and to evaluate the effect of topical anesthesia on rebound tonometry. Procedures: Six enucleated eyes were used to compare both tonometers with direct manometry. Intraocular pressure (IOP) was measured in 100 cats to establish reference values for rebound tonometry. Of these, 22 cats were used to compare rebound tonometry with and without topical anesthesia and 33 cats to compare the rebound and <b>applanation</b> tonometers. All evaluated eyes were free of ocular disease. Results: Both tonometers correlated well with direct manometry. The best agreement with the rebound tonometer was achieved between 25 – 50 mmHg. The <b>applanation</b> tonometer was accurate at pressures between 0 and 30 mmHg. The mean IOP in clinically normal cats was 20. 74 mmHg with the rebound tonometer and 18. 4 mmHg with the <b>applanation</b> tonometer. Topical anesthesia did not significantly affect rebound tonometry. Conclusions: As the rebound tonometer correlated well with direct manometry in the clinically important pressure range and was well tolerated by cats, it appears suitable for glaucoma diagnosis. The mean IOP obtained with the rebound tonometer was 2 – 3 mmHg higher than that measured with the <b>applanation</b> tonometer. This difference is within clinically acceptable limits, but indicates that {{the same type of}} tonometer should be used in follow-up examinations in a given cat...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND—Several authors {{reported}} incorrect high {{intraocular pressure}} (IOP) values in {{eyes with a}} thick cornea using <b>applanation</b> tonometry. This hypothesis was checked by comparing <b>applanation</b> tonometry with direct intracameral manometry.  METHODS— 73 patients, scheduled for intraocular surgery, were enrolled. Immediately before surgery, the following were registered: (i) central corneal thickness (CCT), (ii) applanatory IOP (Perkins/Tonopen), and (iii) intracameral IOP.  RESULTS—The difference between applanatory and intraocular measurements was completely independent of CCT (y=− 3. 43 + 3. 8 x; where y {{is the difference between}} applanatory and intracamerally measured IOP (mm Hg) and x is CCT (mm); r 2 = 0. 002; p= 0. 72).  CONCLUSIONS—There is no systematic error of <b>applanation</b> tonometry with increasing CCT. Therefore it is inadequate to recalculate IOP based on regression formula of applanatory IOP versus CCT. ...|$|E

Methods: A prospective comparative clinical study was conducted between February and September 2011 on 30 eyes divided into four groups, i. e. 20 corneas of 10 patients before LASIK (group A), 20 corneas of the same patients 2 months postoperatively (group B), 10 corneas of five patients before Epi-LASIK (group C), and 10 corneas of the same patients 2 months postoperatively (group D). Patient age ranged from 20 to 50 years. IOP was measured using Goldmann <b>applanation</b> and air puff tonometry, ORA corneal compensation, and Pentacam correction (which also measured central corneal thickness). Results: Significant positive linear correlations were found between IOP values measured by Goldmann <b>applanation</b> tonometry and other techniques, and with preoperative pachymetry in group A. The correlation between preoperative Pentacam-corrected and preoperative ORA corneal-compensated IOP was strongest for Goldmann <b>applanation</b> tonometry (r = 0. 97 and r = 0. 858 respectively, P &lt; 0. 001). Compared with preoperative values, postoperative IOP measured by the four methods were significantly lower. The difference was statistically significant when IOP was measured using Goldmann <b>applanation</b> and air puff tonometry compared with the ORA and Pentacam methods (P &lt; 0. 001 for LASIK patients and P = 0. 017 for Epi-LASIK patients). Nonsignificant correlations were found between the degree of lowering of postoperative IOP and postoperative pachymetry in groups B and D. Conclusion: Refractive surgery causes significant lowering of IOP as measured using Goldmann <b>applanation</b> tonometry, air puff tonometry, ORA compensation, and Pentacam correction. LASIK has a greater effect than Epi-LASIK on IOP measurement error following refractive surgery.

Materials and methodsThis prospective study enrolled 55 (68 eyes) consecutive patients scheduled for cataract surgery at Dhahran Eye Specialist Hospital (DESH). Every eye underwent two measurements each with an optical biometer and with <b>applanation</b> ultrasound. Only patients with cataract and no other ophthalmic pathology or disease were enrolled. Comparison, correlation and repeatability of axial length with both devices were analyzed. Agreement between devices was evaluated. A regression formula to convert measurements between devices was investigated. A p value less than 0. 05 was statistically significant. ResultsThere was strong repeatability (99. 4 %) and agreement (r= 0. 987) between both devices (p< 0. 001); the difference between devices was mainly in short eyes (p= 0. 031).

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{determine}} the measurement reliability of CorVis ST, a dynamic Scheimpflug analyser, in virgin and post-photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) eyes {{and compare the}} results between these two groups. METHODS: Forty virgin eyes and 42 post-PRK eyes underwent CorVis ST measurements performed by two technicians. Repeatability was evaluated by comparing three consecutive measurements by technician A. Reproducibility was determined by comparing the first measurement by technician A with one performed by technician B. Intraobserver and interobserver intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were calculated. Univariate analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) {{was used to compare}} measured parameters between virgin and post-PRK eyes. RESULTS: The intraocular pressure (IOP), central corneal thickness (CCT) and 1 st <b>applanation</b> time demonstrated good intraobserver repeatability and interobserver reproducibility (ICC ≧ 0. 90) in virgin and post-PRK eyes. The deformation amplitude showed a good or close to good repeatability and reproducibility in both groups (ICC ≧ 0. 88). The CCT correlated positively with 1 st <b>applanation</b> time (r = 0. 437 and 0. 483, respectively, p< 0. 05) and negatively with deformation amplitude (r = - 0. 384 and - 0. 375, respectively, p< 0. 05) in both groups. Compared to post-PRK eyes, virgin eyes showed longer 1 st <b>applanation</b> time (7. 29 ± 0. 21 vs. 6. 96 ± 0. 17 ms, p< 0. 05) and lower deformation amplitude (1. 06 ± 0. 07 vs. 1. 17 ± 0. 08 mm, p < 0. 05). CONCLUSIONS: CorVis ST demonstrated reliable measurements for CCT, IOP, and 1 st <b>applanation</b> time, as well as relatively reliable measurement for deformation amplitude in both virgin and post-PRK eyes. There were differences in 1 st <b>applanation</b> time and deformation amplitude between virgin and post-PRK eyes, which may reflect corneal biomechanical changes occurring after the surgery in the latter...|$|E

Methods: The separation force of a tonometer prism adhered by a tear film to a simulated cornea was measured to quantify an isolated tear film adhesion force. Acrylic hemispheres (7. 8  mm radius) used as corneas were lathed over the apical 3. 06  mm diameter to simulate full <b>applanation</b> contact with the prism surface for both GAT and CATS prisms. Tear film separation measurements were completed with both an artificial tear and fluorescein solutions as a fluid bridge. The <b>applanation</b> mire thicknesses were measured and correlated with the tear film separation measurements. Human cadaver eyes were used to validate simulated cornea tear film separation measurement differences between the GAT and CATS prisms. Results: The CATS prism tear film adhesion error (2. 74 ± 0. 21  mmHg) was significantly less than the GAT prism (4. 57 ± 0. 18  mmHg, p< 0. 001). Tear film adhesion error was independent of <b>applanation</b> mire thickness (R 2 = 0. 09, p= 0. 04). Fluorescein produces more tear film error than artificial tears (+ 0. 51 ± 0. 04  mmHg; p< 0. 001). Cadaver eye validation indicated the CATS prism’s tear film adhesion error (1. 40 ± 0. 51  mmHg) was significantly less than that of the GAT prism (3. 30 ± 0. 38  mmHg; p= 0. 002). Conclusion: Measured GAT tear film adhesion error is more than previously predicted. A CATS prism significantly reduced tear film adhesion error by ~ 41 %. Fluorescein solution increases the tear film adhesion compared to artificial tears, while mire thickness has a negligible effect.

40|$|AIMS: To compare supine {{nighttime}} {{intraocular pressure}} measurements with Perkins <b>applanation</b> tonometry to 24 -h sitting intraocular pressures with Goldmann <b>applanation</b> tonometry. METHODS: A prospective, untreated, uncontrolled, observational cohort of qualified consecutive ocular hypertensive or primary open-angle glaucoma patients. Patients underwent sitting intraocular pressure measurements over 24 -h by Goldmann and patients had their supine nighttime intraocular pressure measurements by Perkins. RESULTS: In 100 completed patients, the mean intraocular pressure at 1000, 2200, 0200 and 0600 hours while sitting was 22. 5 +/- 3. 7 mm Hg, {{and in the}} supine position, 23. 5 +/- 4. 3 mm Hg (P< 0. 001). The mean sitting Goldmann intraocular pressures across the three daytime points was 23. 3 +/- 3. 4 mm Hg and across three nighttime points was 21. 5 +/- 4. 0 mm Hg (P< 0. 001). In contrast, the mean daytime sitting Goldmann intraocular pressure was not different than the mean nighttime supine intraocular pressure evaluated with Perkins (22. 8 +/- 4. 4 mm Hg, P= 0. 07). However, only 70 % of patients were within 1. 0 mm Hg of the highest daytime reading for all nighttime supine and sitting intraocular pressures. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that with Perkins <b>applanation</b> tonometry the untreated mean supine intraocular pressures are not higher at night than daytime sitting Goldmann <b>applanation</b> tonometry. However, the highest daytime sitting intraocular pressure measurement does not consistently predict the highest nighttime sitting or supine intraocular pressure value...|$|E
40|$|Background: Several authors {{believe it}} is {{necessary}} to randomise the order in which contact and non-contact tonometers are used in comparison studies. This study was carried out to investigate the effect of repeated <b>applanation</b> on the measured intraocular pressure. Methods: One set of measurements per session was made on each of three sessions (one session per day) with the Goldmann and two non-contact tonometers (Topcon CT 80 and Keeler Pulsair EasyEye), in a pre-determined order, on one randomly selected eye of 120 subjects randomised to one of two groups. For session one, only the non-contact tonometers were used to assess the intraocular pressure of both groups. For session two, either non-contact or Goldmann tonometry was performed first and this order was reversed for session 3. Average intraocular pressures were compared between sessions to determine {{the presence or absence of}} effects on the intraocular pressure caused by prior repeated <b>applanation</b> with the Goldmann or either one (or both) of the non-contact tonometers. Results: Prior <b>applanation</b> with a non-contact tonometer did not cause a significant (p > 0. 05) reduction of the mean pressure measured with either non-contact tonometer. The mean pressure was slightly but significantly (p 0. 05) between the pressures measured with the Goldmann tonometer prior to and subsequent to non-contact tonometry, in both subject groups.  Conclusion: A small but statistically significant reduction in the intraocular pressure was found following <b>applanation</b> with the Goldmann tonometer but not with either one of two non-contact tonometers...|$|E
