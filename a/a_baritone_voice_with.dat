50|$|Amir Khan had <b>a</b> rich <b>baritone</b> <b>voice</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> three-octave range, {{and could}} move equally {{effortlessly}} in any octave. He developed his own gayaki (singing style), {{influenced by the}} styles of Abdul Waheed Khan (vilambit tempo), Rajab Ali Khan (taans) and Aman Ali Khan (merukhand). This unique style, known as the Indore Gharana, blends the spiritual flavor and grandeur of dhrupad with the ornate vividness of khyal. Amir Khansahib presented an aesthetically detailed badhat (progression) in ati-vilambit laya (very slow tempo) using bol-alap with merukhandi patterns, followed by gradually speeding up sargams with various ornamentations, taans and bol-taans with complex and unpredictable movements and jumps while preserving the raga structure, and finally a madhyalaya or drut laya (medium or fast tempo) chhota khyal or a ruba'idar tarana. He helped popularize the tarana, as well as khyalnuma compositions in the Dari variant of Persian. While he was famous for his use of merukhand, {{he did not do}} a purely merukhandi alap but rather inserted merukhandi passages throughout his performance.|$|R
500|$|According to The Atlantic, {{the four}} most {{influential}} grunge singers were: Alice in Chains' Layne Staley, who {{was called the}} [...] "most memorable voice" [...] of the genre for his skill at getting across [...] "power and vulnerability", Cobain, who could both scream and sing melodically in the same song like John Lennon, Soundgarden's Chris Cornell, who could wail and sing high-pitched notes like Robert Plant, and Vedder, who mixed <b>a</b> Jim Morrison-influenced <b>baritone</b> <b>voice</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> blend of punk and rock styles. Jeff Stetson praises Cobain and Mark Lanegan for the distinctiveness of their singing voices and he calls Cornell, Staley and Carrie Akre [...] "...some of the greatest voices...to be heard in modern rock"; he also states that these singers achieved their vocal level without the 2010s-era [...] "industry standard air brushing" [...] of Auto Tune pitch correction.|$|R
5000|$|Robert Anderson {{began his}} solo career in 1939 with R. L. Knowles. They formed the Knowles and Anderson Singers and {{traveled}} together until 1941, when Anderson rejoined the Roberta Martin Singers and stayed with them until 1943. Anderson possessed <b>a</b> <b>baritone</b> <b>voice</b> coupled <b>with</b> <b>a</b> style often {{compared to that}} of Bing Crosby or Billy Eckstine. Unlike many of his Chicago gospel contemporaries, Anderson was not known for stage antics, shouting, or other movements while singing. Anderson's style contained very little physical movement, with much attention paid to phrasing, tone, and dynamic style. In 1942, he formed Good Shepherd Music House, which he based in Gary, Indiana. Good Shepherd Music House published his compositions, such as [...] "Prayer Changes Things", [...] "Why Should I Worry", and [...] "Oh Lord, Is It I?" [...] In 1943, he performed [...] "Something Within" [...] at the National Baptist Convention. After that performance, his career began to take off. In 1947, Anderson formed a group that would back him and share lead vocals. This group was known as his Gospel Caravan, which would later be renamed The Caravans in 1951. Anderson and The Caravans' first recordings were made in August 1949 and released in September 1949 on the Miracle Records label. In 1951, Anderson and The Caravans joined the United Records label. During an April 18, 1952 recording session, Anderson and The Caravans split ways. After the breakup, Anderson continued to record with a new group of singers called The Robert Anderson Singers. In 1954, Anderson and the Anderson singers joined Apollo Records. In 1955, Anderson began recording as a solo artist, recording and performing sporadically through the mid-1990s for labels such as Vee Jay Records and Savoy Records. Anderson served as choir director at the Hertzell United Methodist Church until his death in 1995.|$|R
