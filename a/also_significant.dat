5|$|Islam is {{the largest}} non-Christian {{religion}} (estimated at around 75,000, which is about 1.4% of the population), and there are <b>also</b> <b>significant</b> Jewish, Hindu and Sikh communities, especially in Glasgow. The Samyé Ling monastery near Eskdalemuir, which celebrated its 40th anniversary in 2007, is the first Buddhist monastery in western Europe.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{resistance}} was focused in the French-speaking areas of Belgium (Wallonia {{and the city of}} Brussels), although Flemish involvement in {{the resistance}} was <b>also</b> <b>significant.</b> Around 70 percent of underground newspapers were in French, while 60 percent of political prisoners were Walloon.|$|E

5|$|There was <b>also</b> <b>significant</b> condescension towards COBOL in the {{business}} community from users of other languages, for example FORTRAN or assembler, implying that COBOL could be used only for non-challenging problems.|$|E
5|$|Vampire bats also {{engage in}} social {{grooming}}. It usually occurs between females and their offspring, {{but it is}} <b>also</b> <b>significant</b> between adult females. Social grooming is mostly associated with food sharing.|$|E
5|$|Winds and {{currents}} are <b>also</b> <b>significant</b> for navigation. While no identifications {{have been}} made for currents, Dietrich offers a tentative sub-grouping of wind-related glyphs (see: Gallery).|$|E

5|$|A {{few of the}} {{closely related}} mites also infest humans, some causing intense itching by their bites and others by {{burrowing}} into the skin. Species that normally infest other animals such as rodents may infest humans if their normal hosts are eliminated. Three species of mite are a threat to honey bees and one of these, Varroa destructor, has become the largest single problem faced by beekeepers worldwide. Mites cause several forms of allergic diseases, including hay fever, asthma and eczema, and they aggravate atopic dermatitis. Mites are <b>also</b> <b>significant</b> crop pests, although predatory mites {{may be useful in}} controlling some of these.|$|E
5|$|After the {{reconversion}} of Scandinavian Scotland in {{the tenth}} century, Christianity under papal authority was the dominant {{religion of the}} kingdom. The process of Christianisation was <b>also</b> <b>significant</b> {{in the development of}} Scottish national identity, the Hiberno-Scottish mission to Continental Europe, the development of Insular art, and the introduction of Latin and formal education.|$|E
5|$|Confusion among Jordanians was as {{important}} as among Israelis with the attack on Hill 315 and those of diversion. With the incoming morning and unable to evaluate properly the situation, the Israeli HQ gave orders at 5.30 am for the soldiers to retreat to Bad al-Oued. The losses were <b>also</b> <b>significant.</b> Indeed, the 400-strong Harel battalion numbered 16 dead and 79 injured, and the Yiftach an handful of dead and injured. The Legion numbered several dozen victims.|$|E

5|$|In Fakaofo, {{the storm}} surge from Percy damaged a sea wall and caused major beach erosion. One house was {{destroyed}} while others were severely damaged. Percy also damaged much of the coconut harvest and 50% of the livestock {{were killed by the}} cyclone. Atafu also suffered similar damage as the storm damaged a UHF tower and several storage sheds. Damage to crops was <b>also</b> <b>significant</b> as the storm damaged much of the banana and pandanus harvests. The schools in Atafu suffered only minimal damage (mostly wind damage).|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} religion, Byzantine Greek Macedonia is <b>also</b> <b>significant</b> {{as being the}} home of Saints Cyril and Methodius, two Greek {{brothers}} from Thessaloniki (Salonika) who were sent on state-sponsored missions to proselytize among the Slavs of the Balkans and east-central Europe. This involved Cyril and Methodius having to translate the Christian Bible into the Slavs' own language, for which they invented an alphabet that became known as Old Church Slavonic. In the process, this cemented the Greek brothers' status as the pioneers of Slavic literature and those who first introduced Byzantine civilization and Orthodox Christianity to the hitherto illiterate and pagan Slavs.|$|E
5|$|In {{the modern}} era, Cluj's {{population}} experienced two phases of rapid growth, {{the first in}} the late 19th century, when the city grew in importance and size, and the second during the Communist period, when a massive urbanisation campaign was launched and many people migrated from rural areas and from beyond the Carpathians to the county's capital. About two-thirds of the population growth during this era was based on net migration inflows; after 1966, the date of Ceaușescu's ban on abortion and contraception, natural increase was <b>also</b> <b>significant,</b> being responsible for the remaining third.|$|E

5|$|Jay Wolpert {{developed}} a script {{based on the}} theme park ride in 2001, and Stuart Beattie rewrote it in early 2002. Around that time, producer Jerry Bruckheimer {{became involved in the}} project; he had Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio work on the script, adding the supernatural curse to the storyline. Filming took place from October 2002 to March 2003 in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and on sets constructed around Los Angeles, California. It was <b>also</b> <b>significant</b> in being the first film released under the Walt Disney Pictures banner to be rated PG-13 by the MPAA.|$|E
5|$|Reviews of {{the episode}} varied widely, {{but there was more}} {{positive}} reaction than not. The greatest enthusiasm was for Rachel's fathers, though Principal Figgins (Iqbal Theba) was complimented on his brief scenes, and the scene with Kurt (Chris Colfer) and Karofsky (Max Adler) was also praised. The episode was <b>also</b> <b>significant</b> because it featured an on-screen kiss by Santana (Naya Rivera) and Brittany (Heather Morris), which was the show's first lesbian kiss.|$|E
5|$|Rodents are <b>also</b> <b>significant</b> vectors of disease. The black rat, {{with the}} fleas that it carries, plays a primary role in {{spreading}} the bacterium Yersinia pestis responsible for bubonic plague, and carries the organisms responsible for typhus, Weil's disease, toxoplasmosis and trichinosis. A number of rodents carry hantaviruses, including the Puumala, Dobrava and Saaremaa viruses, which can infect humans. Rodents {{also help to}} transmit diseases including babesiosis, cutaneous leishmaniasis, human granulocytic anaplasmosis, Lyme disease, Omsk hemorrhagic fever, Powassan virus, rickettsialpox, relapsing fever, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, and West Nile virus.|$|E

5|$|Ruffed lemurs {{are active}} {{primarily}} {{during the day}} (diurnal), during which time they feed primarily on fruits and nectar, often adopting suspensory postures while feeding. The seeds of the fruit they eat pass through their digestive tract and are propagated throughout the rainforests in their feces, helping to ensure new plant growth and a healthy forest ecosystem. These lemurs are <b>also</b> <b>significant</b> pollinators of the traveller's tree (Ravenala madagascariensis). Without destroying the inflorescence, they lick the nectar from deep inside the flower using their long muzzles and tongues, collecting and transferring pollen on their snouts and fur from plant to plant. This relationship {{is thought to be}} a result of co-evolution.|$|E
5|$|The Bristol County Jail {{was added}} to the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. The jail is {{significant}} as a relatively unaltered historic jail that was important to the 18th-century Bristol County. It is <b>also</b> <b>significant</b> in that it currently serves as the home of the Bristol Historical and Preservation Society. The Society also houses its library and collections in the jail and runs a small museum shop from the building.|$|E
5|$|The K–Pg {{extinction}} had {{a profound}} effect on the evolution of life on Earth. The elimination of dominant Cretaceous groups allowed other organisms to take their place, spurring a remarkable series of adaptive radiations in the Paleogene. The most striking example is the replacement of dinosaurs by mammals. After the K–Pg extinction, mammals evolved rapidly to fill the niches left vacant by the dinosaurs. <b>Also</b> <b>significant,</b> within the mammalian genera, new species were approximately 9.1% larger after the K–Pg boundary.|$|E
