5|$|The U.S. Army's 75th Ranger Regiment: Regimental Reconnaissance Company (formerly {{known as}} Regimental Reconnaissance Detachment/RRD) is <b>a</b> <b>unit</b> <b>that</b> has {{rumored to be}} the newest {{operational}} member of the Joint Special Operations Command. The unit {{is believed to have}} been formally invited to join JSOC in 2007 due to its extensive training and unique capabilities to conduct special reconnaissance and close target reconnaissance (CTR) operations.|$|E
5|$|The brigade draws {{its origins}} {{back to the}} 174th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment, <b>a</b> <b>unit</b> <b>that</b> served during the American Civil War. The 174th, also called the 5th National Guard, was {{recruited}} in New York City {{under the auspices of}} the Metropolitan police; it was organized at Riker's Island, and there mustered into the U.S. service for three years on 13 November 1862. The regiment sailed to Louisiana that December. Upon arrival, it was assigned to the 2nd brigade of Major General William Emory's division.|$|E

5|$|Authorities rapidly {{ruled out}} the {{possibility}} that ETA had a cell in the island, with police believing the attack had been carried out by <b>a</b> <b>unit</b> <b>that</b> had travelled to the island specifically to carry it out. Initial reports stated that the bombers had set the bomb off with a remote control. Once the second bomb was spotted, police announced that it had a timer device, which could have allowed the members of ETA to plant the bomb several days before the attack and leave the island. Earlier, Government delegate for Majorca, Ramon Socías, had said that security forces believed that the bombers had not left Majorca, and were hiding on the island, waiting for the situation to cool down before attempting to leave.|$|E
5|$|When his {{re-election}} in 1975 seemed unsure, Kreisky proposed that his Social Democratic Party should form a coalition with the Freedom Party, headed by Friedrich Peter. Wiesenthal was {{in possession of}} information proving that Peter {{had been a member}} of the 1 SS Infantry Brigade, <b>a</b> <b>unit</b> <b>that</b> had exterminated over 13,000 Jewish civilians in Ukraine in 1941–42. He decided not to reveal this information to the press until after the election, but forwarded his dossier to President Rudolf Kirchschläger. Peter denied having participated in, or having knowledge of, any atrocities. In the end, Kreisky's party won a clear majority and did not form the coalition.|$|E
5|$|Halo Wars 2 {{features}} {{a number of}} multiplayer modes that can be played online with up to six players. Skirmish is a cooperative or solo play mode against AI opponents. Deathmatch involves eliminating the opponent's army. Stronghold and Domination are territorial modes centered around controlling bases or nodes on the map. Blitz is a mode that combines elements from collectible card games with RTS gameplay by replacing the base building and resource management with a card-and-deck mechanic for unit deployment. Players create decks from card packs that are earned by playing the campaign mode and completing daily challenges. Each card features <b>a</b> <b>unit</b> <b>that</b> is deployed on the battlefield. Energy is the resource for using cards; more powerful units have a higher energy cost. Energy generates automatically throughout a match and more can be collected as additional energy supplies are dropped onto the map periodically. There is single-player and cooperative variant of Blitz named Firefight, which pits players against waves of AI enemies.|$|E

5|$|In 1921, the {{decision}} was made to perpetuate the numerical designations and battle honours of the AIF by re-raising the AIF units as part of the Citizens Force. This was done by reorganising the existing Citizens Forces units so that they would adopt the identity of the AIF units that had been recruited within their regions and in which many of the pre-war citizen soldiers had served. This was designed so as to maintain the regional identity of the Citizens Forces units, as well as the honours and traditions of the AIF units. In this time the 6th Battalion was re-raised from personnel drawn from six existing units: all of the 2nd Battalion, 6th Infantry Regiment; as well as part of the 29th Light Horse Regiment; the 2nd Battalion, 46th Infantry Regiment; the 2nd Battalion, 60th Infantry Regiment; the 5th Battalion, 5th Infantry Regiment and the 5th Battalion, 21st Infantry Regiment. Through these units, the battalion gained a complex lineage, including that of the 64th Infantry, <b>a</b> <b>unit</b> <b>that</b> could trace its lineage back to 1854 and claimed to be the oldest infantry unit in Australia.|$|E
5|$|Munnerlyn {{played in}} 16 games with 11 starts for Carolina in the 2012 season. He {{tied for the}} team lead with two interceptions and tied the team record for interceptions {{returned}} for scores in a season as he returned both interception for touchdowns, a record that was previously accomplished by Eric Davis in 1998 and Mike Minter in 2003. He produced more tackles than the previous season with 61 tackles. He also batted down six passes and was credited with two quarterback pressures, contributing to <b>a</b> <b>unit</b> <b>that</b> ranked 10th in the NFL in total defense. He started 11 of the last 12 games at left cornerback after Chris Gamble suffered a season-ending injury in Week 7. As a punt returner, he averaged 5.1 yards on a team-high 14 punt returns with a long of 20 yards. In Week 5 against the Seattle Seahawks, he intercepted a pass by quarterback Russell Wilson and returned it 33 yards for a touchdown. In Week 10 at the Denver Broncos, he matched a career-high in tackles with seven. In Week 11, he picked off a pass by Buccaneers quarterback Josh Freeman and returned it 74 yards for a touchdown, his second of the year. In {{the final game of}} the season at New Orleans Saints, he equaled his previous career-high of seven tackles.|$|E
5|$|Upon formation, the 2/15th {{was placed}} {{under the command of}} Lieutenant Colonel Robert Marlan, an Australian Staff Corps officer of the Permanent Military Forces who arrived on {{promotion}} from major, having previously served in World War I with the 20th Battalion. The colours initially chosen for the battalion's Unit Colour Patch (UCP) were the same as those of the 15th Battalion, <b>a</b> <b>unit</b> <b>that</b> had served during World War I before being raised as a Militia formation in 1921. These colours were initially purple and red in a diamond shape, but after representations from World War I veterans the colour patch was changed to brown over dark blue, in a rectangle shape. The patch was placed inside a grey diamond border added to distinguish the battalion from its Militia counterpart; this would change following the unit's involvement in the fighting at Tobruk, when it adopted a 'T'-shaped UCP consisting of blue and green.|$|E

25|$|The {{fundamental}} principle of radiosurgery {{is that of}} selective ionization of tissue, by means of high-energy beams of radiation. Ionization is the production of ions and free radicals which are usually deleterious to the cells. These ions and radicals, which may be formed from {{the water in the}} cell or biological materials, can produce irreparable damage to DNA, proteins, and lipids, resulting in the cell's death. Thus, biological inactivation is carried out in a volume of tissue to be treated, with a precise destructive effect. The radiation dose is usually measured in grays (one gray (Gy) is the absorption of one joule of energy per kilogram of mass). <b>A</b> <b>unit</b> <b>that</b> attempts to take into account both the different organs that are irradiated and the type of radiation is the sievert, <b>a</b> <b>unit</b> <b>that</b> describes both the amount of energy deposited and the biological effectiveness.|$|E
