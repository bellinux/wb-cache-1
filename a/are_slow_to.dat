5|$|Propagation is by seed, {{though these}} can be {{difficult}} to extract from the follicles. Seeds do not require any treatment before sowing, and take 12 to 48 days to germinate. Cultivars require propagation by cutting for progeny to grow true. Cuttings <b>are</b> <b>slow</b> <b>to</b> strike. Attempts to graft B.coccinea have met with little success.|$|E
5|$|It is {{not known}} if C.tuberosa is {{strictly}} parasitic, and needs the host to be living, {{or whether it is}} saprobic. Either way, the fruit bodies of the fungus are found growing solitarily or in dense clusters on the decomposing, often blackened remains of other mushrooms. Hosts include agarics (particularly Lactarius and Russula), boletes, hydnums, and polypores. In the Pacific Northwest region of the United States, Russula crassotunicata is a common and abundant species that has been definitively identified as a host of both C.tuberosa and Dendrocollybia racemosa. The Russula fruit bodies <b>are</b> <b>slow</b> <b>to</b> decay, and are available nearly year-round as a substrate for the saprobes. Based on field observations, the authors suggest that C.tuberosa may produce fruit bodies on less decayed mushrooms, while D.racemosa produces them on much more heavily decayed mushrooms.|$|E
50|$|The Athenians {{managed to}} survive for several reasons. First, their foes were lacking in initiative. Corinth and Syracuse <b>were</b> <b>slow</b> <b>to</b> bring their fleets into the Aegean, and Sparta's other allies <b>were</b> also <b>slow</b> <b>to</b> furnish troops or ships. The Ionian states that rebelled {{expected}} protection, and many rejoined the Athenian side.

5|$|Nickel is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Ni and atomic number 28. It is a silvery-white lustrous metal {{with a slight}} golden tinge. Nickel belongs to the transition metals and is hard and ductile. Pure nickel, powdered to maximize the reactive surface area, shows a significant chemical activity, but larger pieces <b>are</b> <b>slow</b> <b>to</b> react with air under standard conditions because an oxide layer forms {{on the surface and}} prevents further corrosion (passivation). Even so, pure native nickel is found in Earth's crust only in tiny amounts, usually in ultramafic rocks, and in the interiors of larger nickel–iron meteorites that were not exposed to oxygen when outside Earth's atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|The AWS has {{a mind of}} its own {{at times}} and reaches peak {{performance}} with the owner who is dedicated to teaching the dog just what is expected of it. The breed takes well to training, and especially excels at training that offers some variety rather than routine training drills. However, members of the breed can may have issues with food possessiveness. They can be stubborn, and mentally <b>are</b> <b>slow</b> <b>to</b> mature from puppyhood. Some lines of the breed still retain dominant and aggressive temperaments; other than these lines, the AWS gets on well with children and enjoys playing with them. Even though they were originally bred to hunt, due to their size, they are suitable for apartment living as long as they receive enough exercise.|$|E
5|$|Like all Lactarius species, L.argillaceifolius is mycorrhizal. The fruit {{bodies of}} Lactarius argillaceifolius grow {{scattered}} or in {{groups on the}} ground under hardwoods, especially oak, from July to October. It is often {{one of the first}} mycorrhizal mushrooms to fruit in forests dominated by oak and hickory. The fruit bodies <b>are</b> <b>slow</b> <b>to</b> develop and are long-lasting. The species is found from eastern Canada south to Florida, and west to Minnesota and Texas. It is common in northeast Mexico. The mushroom has also been reported from southern Brazil (state of Santa Catarina) growing in association with pine (Pinus elliottii) plantations, where it has probably been introduced with pine seedlings brought by settlers. L.argillaceifolius var. megacarpus has been collected from Baja California, California, Oregon, and Washington, where it grows in association with coast live oak and tanoak.|$|E

5|$|Loggerhead {{sea turtles}} {{observed}} in captivity {{and in the}} wild are most active during the day. In captivity, the loggerheads' daily activities are divided between swimming and resting on the bottom. While resting, they spread their forelimbs to about midstroke swimming position. They remain motionless with eyes open or half-shut and are easily alerted during this state. At night, captives sleep {{in the same position}} with their eyes tightly shut, and <b>are</b> <b>slow</b> <b>to</b> react. Loggerheads spend up to 85% of their day submerged, with males being the more active divers than females. The average duration of dives is 15–30 min, but they can stay submerged for up to four hours. Juvenile loggerheads and adults differ in their swimming methods. A juvenile keeps its forelimbs pressed to the side of its carapace, and propels itself by kicking with its hind limbs. As the juvenile matures, its swimming method is progressively replaced with the adult's alternating-limb method. They depend entirely on this method of swimming by one year old.|$|E
5|$|Marine mammals were hunted by coastal {{aboriginal}} humans historically {{for food}} and other resources. These subsistence hunts still occur in Canada, Greenland, Indonesia, Russia, the United States, and several nations in the Caribbean. The effects of these are only localized, as hunting efforts were on a relatively small scale. Commercial hunting took this to a much greater scale and marine mammals were heavily exploited. This led to the extinction of the †Steller's sea cow (along with subsistence hunting) and the †Caribbean monk seal. Today, populations of species that were historically hunted, such as blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus) and the North Pacific right whale (Eubalaena japonica), are much lower than their pre-whaling levels. Because whales generally have slow growth rates, <b>are</b> <b>slow</b> <b>to</b> reach sexual maturity, and have a low reproductive output, population recovery has been very slow.|$|E
5|$|The {{nestling}} period also {{varies by}} species size, with larger species having longer nestling periods. It is also affected by season {{and environmental factors}} and by competition with siblings in species with clutch sizes greater than one. Much {{of what is known}} about the nestling period of some species is dependent on aviary studies– aviary cockatiels can fledge after 5weeks and the large palm cockatoos after 11weeks. During this period, the young become covered in juvenile plumage while remaining in the hollow. Wings and tail feathers <b>are</b> <b>slow</b> <b>to</b> grow initially but more rapid as the primary feathers appear. Nestlings quickly reach about 80–90% of adult weight about two thirds of the time through this period, plateauing before they leave the hollow; they fledge at this weight with wing and tail feathers still to grow a little before reaching adult dimensions. Growth rate of the young, as well as numbers fledged, are adversely impacted by reduced food supply and poor weather conditions.|$|E

25|$|Commercial {{harvesting}} {{of painted}} turtle {{from the wild}} is controversial and, increasingly, restricted. Worldwide, many turtle species are endangered and turtle trapping has been implicated as a cause. Since turtles <b>are</b> <b>slow</b> <b>to</b> sexually mature and are long-lived, they generally have poor replacement rates when hunted.|$|E
25|$|An {{alternative}} to hydrides {{is to use}} regular hydrocarbon fuels as the hydrogen carrier. Then a small hydrogen reformer would extract the hydrogen as needed by the fuel cell.

25|$|The poultry {{industry}} produces {{a large amount}} of feathers as waste, which, like other forms of keratin, <b>are</b> <b>slow</b> <b>to</b> decompose. Feather waste has been used in a number of industrial applications as a medium for culturing microbes, biodegradeable polymers, and production of enzymes. Feather proteins have been tried as an adhesive for wood board.|$|E
40|$|Autism Spectrum Disorder (ADS) is {{a severe}} {{developmental}} disability characterized by impairments in social interaction and communicative skills. Despite a growing research {{interest in the}} field, the causes of these impairments remain unknown. Two lines of research, Theory of Mind (ToM) and Central Coherence (CC), using experimental tasks such as visuo-spatial perspective Taking (VPT) and the local and global levels have suggested that visuo-spatial attention and spatial variables in the self-versus other recognition, may {{be the basis of}} the cognitive processes underlying social interaction. According to spatial attention, such as observed in the Unilateral spatial neglect (USN) may contribute to explain the differences in the spatial attention and the brain activation of autistic children in these two tasks. Participants with ASD in the CC experiment <b>were</b> <b>slower</b> <b>to</b> respond to the left hemifield in the global level.

25|$|Geoducks are {{broadcast}} spawners. A female geoduck produces about 5 billion eggs in her century-long lifespan. However, {{due to a}} {{low rate}} of recruitment and {{a high rate of}} mortality for geoduck eggs, larvae, and post-settled juveniles, populations <b>are</b> <b>slow</b> <b>to</b> rebound. In the Puget Sound, studies indicate that the recovery time for a harvested tract is 39 years.|$|E
25|$|Light {{has been}} shown to be a {{requirement}} for chloroplast division. Chloroplasts can grow and progress through some of the constriction stages under poor quality green light, but <b>are</b> <b>slow</b> <b>to</b> complete division—they require exposure to bright white light to complete division. Spinach leaves grown under green light have been observed to contain many large dumbbell-shaped chloroplasts. Exposure to white light can stimulate these chloroplasts to divide and reduce the population of dumbbell-shaped chloroplasts.|$|E
25|$|In 2017, {{a drop in}} {{the number}} of Chinese donkeys, {{combined}} with the fact that they <b>are</b> <b>slow</b> <b>to</b> reproduce, meant that Chinese suppliers began to look to Africa. As a result of the increase in demand, and the price that could be charged, Kenya opened three donkey abattoirs. Concerns for donkey's wellbeing, however, have resulted in a number of African countries (including Uganda, Tanzania, Botswana, Niger, Burkina Faso, Mali, and Senegal) banning China from buying their donkey products.|$|E

25|$|Hyperkalemic {{periodic}} paralysis is an {{autosomal dominant}} clinical condition {{where there is}} a mutation in gene located at 17q23 that regulates the production of protein SCN4A. SCN4A is an important component of sodium channels in skeletal muscles. During exercise, sodium channels would open to allow influx of sodium into the muscle cells for depolarisation to occur. But in hyperkalemic periodic paralysis, sodium channels <b>are</b> <b>slow</b> <b>to</b> close after exercise, causing excessive influx of sodium and displacement of potassium out of the cells.|$|E
