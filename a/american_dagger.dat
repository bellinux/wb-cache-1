5000|$|Wilson {{blamed the}} Irish Americans and German Americans {{for the lack}} of popular support for his {{unsuccessful}} campaign to have the United States join the League of Nations, saying, [...] "There is an organized propaganda against the League of Nations and against the treaty proceeding from exactly the same sources that the organized propaganda proceeded from which threatened this country here and there with disloyalty, and I want to say—I cannot say too often—any man who carries a hyphen about with him a hyphenated <b>American</b> carries a <b>dagger</b> that he is ready to plunge into the vitals of this Republic whenever he gets ready." ...|$|R
25|$|Confusion, however, did {{not rest}} on the American side alone. The Filipinos also succumbed to indecision. Colonel Lucio Lucas, who was under Luna's direct command, had responded {{immediately}} after hearing the signal for attack. His objective was to march into the Meisic police station, which the Americans {{had turned into a}} barracks. However, en route Lucas' troops were met by a large American contingent at Azcarraga Street. Thinking of retreat, Lucas had reconsidered the belief that it was better to die fighting than die burning. The houses at their rear were already on fire, so he ordered his men to attack the <b>Americans</b> with only <b>daggers</b> in their hands. In the ensuing fight three Filipinos and eight Americans were killed.|$|R
50|$|The <b>American</b> <b>dagger</b> moth can be {{seen from}} April to September {{throughout}} its range. Caterpillars {{can be seen}} from July to October. It has one brood in the north and two to three broods in the south.|$|E
50|$|The <b>American</b> <b>dagger</b> moth has a {{wingspan}} of 50 to 65 mm. It is gray to gray-brown with darker markings. It {{usually has}} a sharp, double postmedian line, with white {{in between the}} two lines. There is a black dash on the anal area of the fore wing. The hind wing is gray with a faint, darker gray median line in the male. The female is similar, except the hind wing is completely dark.|$|E
50|$|Control of the <b>American</b> <b>Dagger</b> Nematode {{presents}} {{problems because}} X. americanum {{is hard to}} completely remove. Nematicides generally remove up to 95% of the nematodes in soil, however the 5% that remain can reproduce asexually and the viruses that they carry can still infect the roots of young plants. Therefore, to eliminate the nematodes, nematicides should be used along with having a bare soil field {{for at least a}} 2-year period. This ensures that the X. americanum has no food source. At the end of this 2-year period the nematodes should be eradicated.|$|E
50|$|X. americanum {{is found}} widely {{throughout}} most of the world and is found on all of the continents, except for Antarctica. The region with the highest population of X. americanum is thought to be the Eastern United States. The states with the highest population of the <b>American</b> <b>Dagger</b> Nematode are Arkansas, California, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Virginia. Other countries where X. americanum is found include Australia, Belize, Brazil, Chile, Guatemala, India, Japan, Korea Democratic People's Republic, Korea Republic, Mexico, New Zealand,Pakistan, Panama, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Uruguay, and areas of the Caribbean as well.|$|E
5000|$|Xiphinema americanum (<b>American</b> <b>dagger</b> nematode) is a plant {{pathogenic}} nematode. It {{is one of}} {{many species}} that belongs to the genus Xiphinema. It was first described by N. A. Cobb in 1913, who found it {{on both sides of the}} United States on the roots of grass, corn, and citrus trees. Not only is Xiphinema americanum known to vector plant viruses, but also X. americanum has been referred to as [...] "the most destructive plant parasitic nematode in America", and one of the four major nematode pests in the Southeastern United States.|$|E
50|$|X. americanum is a plant {{parasite}} that lives {{entirely in the}} soil and is attracted to young, growing roots due to source-sink dynamics. These nematodes are migratory ectoparasites {{and all of the}} life stages of the <b>American</b> <b>Dagger</b> Nematode feed at the root tips of plants. Since it is a migratory ectoparasite, they remain outside the root or other feeding areas and feed on epidermal cells or on cells deeper in the root. This ectoparasitism allows the nematode to move freely to different hosts throughout its life cycle. This nematode is considered to be an obligate parasite. It can survive within plant debris, however it needs living plant tissue to feed.|$|E
