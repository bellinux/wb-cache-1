5|$|In {{southeast}} Broken Arrow, the Creek Turnpike {{crosses the}} county line into Wagoner County <b>and</b> <b>swings</b> towards the north-northeast. It then meets SH-51, {{followed by the}} Muskogee Turnpike (SH-351) near that highway's western terminus. The Creek Turnpike passes through {{the third and final}} barrier toll after re-entering Tulsa. From the toll plaza, the turnpike proceeds north to end at the I-44/US-412 interchange, which straddles the Wagoner–Rogers County county line. The portion of the interchange that sits in Rogers County also lies in the town of Fair Oaks. The mainline Creek Turnpike becomes the Will Rogers Turnpike as eastbound I-44 merges onto the roadway.|$|E
5|$|The Kootenay rises on the {{northeast}} slopes of the Beaverfoot Range of southeastern British Columbia, and flows initially southeast through the valleys of Kootenay National Park. Its first few kilometers (miles) are quiet, threading slowly {{through a series of}} marshes and small lakes. The river becomes significantly enlarged as it reaches the confluence with the Vermilion River, which is actually the larger of the two where they meet near the settlement of Kootenay Crossing. It continues southeast, receiving the Palliser River from the left, <b>and</b> <b>swings</b> southwards into a gorge at the confluence with the White River.|$|E
5|$|Disaster {{strikes at}} the press event. The craft {{apparently}} draws power from the broadcasting equipment, and its influence is magnified. The streets of London erupt into violence as those affected go on a rampage. Breen becomes drawn towards the craft and is killed. Quatermass falls under the alien control as well, but is snapped out of it by Roney, who is unaffected. The two men realise that {{a small portion of}} the population are immune. The psychic energy becomes stronger, ripping up streets and buildings, and the spectral image of a Martian towers above the city, centred on Hobbs End. Recalling stories about how the Devil could be defeated with iron and water, Roney theorises the Martian energy could be discharged into the earth. Roney climbs to the top of a building crane <b>and</b> <b>swings</b> it into the spectre. The crane bursts into flames as it discharges the energy, killing Roney, but the image disappears.|$|E

5|$|On {{the third}} and final day, Bhuvan passes his century, while most of the later wickets fall. Ismail returns to bat {{with the help of a}} runner and passes his half-century, {{reducing}} the required runs to an attainable total. The game comes down to the last over with Kachra on strike. With one ball remaining and the team down five runs, Kachra knocks the ball a short distance, managing a single. However, the umpire signals no ball. Bhuvan returns to bat <b>and</b> <b>swings</b> extremely hard at the next ball, hitting the ball high in the air towards the boundary. Russell backpedals and catches it, gleefully believing that the British team has won — until he realises that he has caught the ball beyond the boundary, giving six runs, and therefore victory, to Bhuvan's team. Even as they celebrate the victory, the drought ends as a rainstorm erupts.|$|E
5|$|David (Nolan North) is {{the leader}} of a group of cannibals that Ellie runs into at the Lakeside Resort where she is {{sheltering}} Joel while he recovers from a grievous wound. Initially, Ellie runs into him and a fellow hunter after killing a deer, and he offers to trade the deer for some penicillin for Joel. After he and Ellie are forced to fend off a swarm of infected, David reveals that he is actually the leader of the gang of hunters that Ellie and Joel had killed previously at the University of Eastern Colorado, when Joel was injured. He allows Ellie to get away, but later tracks her down and kidnaps her, taking her to his base in the town. There, Ellie discovers that David's gang are cannibals. She resists their attempts, manages to kill his assistant and flees into the town, while David and his gang stalk her. David eventually corners her in a restaurant, and stalks her for several minutes, as it burns down. Eventually, he manages to pin her down and tries to strangle her, but she catches hold of his machete <b>and</b> <b>swings</b> it, knocking him off her, and brutally hacks him to death, before Joel arrives and pulls her off.|$|E

25|$|Moore Homestead Park {{is located}} between Broadway and 45th Avenue.

The park is named after a nearby homestead owned by Clement Clarke Moore, whose ancestor John Moore helped negotiate Newtown's land area with the Native American population there. The park, originally acquired by the Independent Subway System and then turned into a playground, was renovated in the 1990s.|$|E
25|$|The {{manner in}} which the bolas is swung differ between the three genera. Mastophora holds the bolas {{stationary}} with a front leg until a moth approaches, and then cocks the leg <b>and</b> <b>swings</b> the bolas towards the prey with a rapid pendulum-like stroke. Ordgarius begins to whirl the bolas rapidly when detecting an incoming moth. Cladomelea akermani whirls the bolas immediately after it is prepared for about 15 minutes, even when there is no moth present. Ordgarius sometimes has smaller droplets above the terminal one, whereas the other genera produce only one terminal globule.|$|E
25|$|In 1811, a {{show was}} added to promote Bavarian agriculture. In 1813, the festival was {{canceled}} due to the involvement of Bavaria in the Napoleonic Wars, after which the Oktoberfest grew from year to year. The horse races were accompanied by tree climbing, bowling alleys, <b>and</b> <b>swings</b> and other attractions. In 1818, carnival booths appeared; the main prizes awarded were of silver, porcelain, and jewelry. The city fathers assumed responsibility for festival management in 1819, and {{it was decided that}} Oktoberfest be made an annual event. Later, it was lengthened and the date pushed forward because days are longer and warmer at the end of September. The horse race continued until 1960, and the agricultural show still exists today and is held every four years {{in the southern part of}} the festival grounds.|$|E

25|$|The sweep {{method is}} quick {{and works in}} most cases, as the DV usually just drops down on the diver's right side. In this method the diver is usually face down to upright, and sweeps the right hand across the waist from left to right, around to the back, {{in contact with the}} body or scuba set, and round as far back as {{possible}} against the cylinder, the straightens the arm backwards <b>and</b> <b>swings</b> it around outwards and forwards in an arc until it is pointing forwards. This will normally capture the hose {{to the front of the}} arm, where the left hand can find it by sweeping along the arm from the right hand to the neck. This method will fail if the DV has been swept over to the left side of the cylinder.|$|E
25|$|Copulation is {{typically}} {{initiated by the}} male bringing an attractive prey item to the female. With both giving begging calls, they approach until they are side by side. The male then raises <b>and</b> <b>swings</b> his body left and right a few times, and passes the prey to the female, followed by the actual copulation. The gatherings of neighbour groups (see above) cease when nesting is underway, and when the eggs are nearly ready to lay, the male guards his partner closely, perching higher than her to watch for threats and frequently feeding her. This apparently ensures her physical well-being rather than preventing extra-pair copulations, as neighbouring males will stray through each other's territory to snatch a quick fling with the resident females. In this, they have almost a one-in-three chance of success, and consequently the average grey shrike nest is very likely to contain offspring {{of more than one}} male. Females may deposit their eggs in neighbours' nests, but this seems to occur more rarely; in general, mated females are fairly reclusive after their eggs have started developing. A full clutch of eggs can be produced by a female in about 10–15 days.|$|E
