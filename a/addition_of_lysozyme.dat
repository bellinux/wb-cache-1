We characterized Pgd-minus, Oat-minus and double mutants to determine the specific role of L. monocytogenes peptidoglycan acetylation in conferring lysozyme sensitivity and during infection of macrophages and mice. Pgd-minus and Pgd-minus/Oat-minus double mutants were attenuated approximately 2 and 3. 5 logs respectively, in vivo.

40|$|Abstract – Pannerone {{cheese is}} a cow raw milk cheese {{obtained}} without starter and salt addition, {{which can be}} classified as a semi-soft cheese with a high fat content. Prolonged holding of moulded curds at warm room temperatures (~ 30 °C) was identified as having {{a key role in}} the cheese microbiological and chemical composition. Microbial populations were numerous and diverse with high numbers of lactic acid bacteria and coliforms. Pathogenic bacteria were not detected, while propionic bacteria and spores of lactate-fermenting clostridia were detected in all samples. Changes in microbial populations corresponded with key changes in chemical composition. During the first 2 days in the warm room at 30 °C, pH decreased to 4. 9 and lactose was completely fermented to lactic acid. Over the next 4 days, metabolism of lactate to butyric (7. 5 g·kg− 1) and propionic (1. 7 g·kg− 1) acids with a consequent increase in pH to 5. 7 occurred.

The spores were heated at 105 to 120 C by the capillary-tube method. The {{media were}} about equally efficient for the enumeration of heat-activated spores. Efficiency {{of the media}} for the recovery of spores surviving heat treatments at ultrahigh temperatures varied as follows: TSC ≥ SFP > BASE > SPS > TSN. Greater recovery when survivors were enumerated on TSC or SFP was attributed to germination of injured spores by the lysozyme present in the egg yolk emulsion used in these media. Low recovery of survivors on TSN and SPS was due to both the absence of lysozyme and inhibition of injured spores by the selective agents of these media. Recovery of heated spores was reduced greatly by polymyxin, neomycin, and kanamycin, and slightly by sulfadiazine and D-cycloserine. The <b>addition</b> <b>of</b> <b>lysozyme</b> to SPS or TSN did not improve the percentage of heat-injured spores recovered because the selective agents of these media interfered with the action of lysozyme. The suitability of the selective media for the enumeration of survivors was greatly affected {{by the presence of}} certain foods...|$|E
40|$|International audienceSodium caseinate-based edible/biodegradable films {{containing}} lysozyme {{were prepared}} directly by extrusion processes to obtain antimicrobial films. Thermoplastic pellets containing I% (w/w) lysozyme were blown by an industrial-like blown-film-extruder to obtain thermoplastic thin films. Lysozyme stability depended mainly on processing temperature and glycerol content. A correct choice of these parameters allowed obtaining pellets and films with 40. 8 +/- 0. 5 % and 26. 4 +/- 0. 6 % lysozyme residual activity, respectively. Whatever the storage temperature (- 20 degrees C or room temperature), lysozyme activity of pellets remained constant {{for at least}} 5 weeks of storage. Antimicrobial activity against Micrococcus luteus was assayed in Tryptone Soya Broth (TSB) : no bacterial growth was observed for 25 h at 37 degrees C {{in the presence of}} 0. 05 g. L- 1 pellets, while a 2. 4 log increase of bacterial population was observed in the presence of control pellets without lysozyme. Traditional properties of films such as their water sorption and mechanical properties were also investigated and proved that <b>addition</b> <b>of</b> <b>lysozyme</b> at a 1 % concentration did not affect these properties as well as their ultimate aerobic biodegradability. The application potential of such edible antimicrobial films is discussed in relation with these properties...|$|E
40|$|The ability <b>of</b> <b>lysozyme</b> to {{aggregate}} and lyse the gram-negative capnophilic periodontal microorganism Capnocytophaga gingivalis 2010 was monitored optically at 540 nm. Both hen egg white and chromatographically purified human lysozymes had significant but similar aggregation potentials for both logarithmic- and stationary-phase bacteria. In general, {{an increase in}} enzyme concentration resulted in a graded increase in both the initial and maximum changes in turbidity which occurred during the reaction period. The greatest change in turbidity occurred within the initial minutes <b>of</b> interaction <b>of</b> <b>lysozyme</b> and the cells, {{and the extent of}} aggregation paralleled a rapid depletion <b>of</b> <b>lysozyme</b> by the suspensions during the first minute of its incubation with the bacteria. Interestingly, the muramidase inhibitors N-acetyl-D-glucosamine and histamine did not block aggregation, whereas maleylation <b>of</b> <b>lysozyme</b> completely inhibited its aggregating ability. Demaleylation, however, restored aggregation activity comparable to the native enzyme, indicating that maleylated lysozyme retained its integrity and that aggregation was primarily dependent on charge. The <b>addition</b> <b>of</b> up to physiological concentrations of NaHCO 3 and NaCl to cell aggregates resulted in varying degrees of deaggregation and lysis. Surprisingly, ultrastructural analysis of lysozyme-treated cells revealed morphological changes with or without the <b>addition</b> <b>of</b> salt. Damage appeared to occur at the blunted polar end of the cells where there was a large spherical outpouching bordered by a damaged cell envelope. Damaged cells uniformly contained dense granular cytoplasmic debris. In effect, the cationic enzyme lysed C. gingivalis 2010, which was not apparent in the spectrophotometric assay. The paradoxical finding that during bacterial aggregation there was lysis may be of significance to the further elucidation <b>of</b> <b>lysozyme's</b> antibacterial role in the gingival sulcus...|$|R
40|$|Amyloid {{proteins}} are {{a distinct}} class of proteins that can misfold into β-sheet rich structures that later mature {{to form the}} characteristic species known as amyloid fibrils, and accumulate in tissues in the human body. The misfolding event is often caused by mutations (or outer factors such as changes in pH) that destabilize the native protein structure. The mature amyloid fibrils were initially believed {{to be associated with}} diseases connected to protein misfolding such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease, transthyretin amyloidosis and lysozyme amyloidosis. However, now it is known that many different factors are involved in these diseases such as failure in protein clearance, lysosomal dysfunction and formation of intermediate misfolded protein species, which possess cytotoxic properties, preceding the formation of mature fibrils. In this thesis the amyloidogenic protein lysozyme has been examined in vivo by using Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly) as a model organism. The effects <b>of</b> over-expressing human <b>lysozyme</b> and amyloidogenic variants in Drosophila have been investigated both in the absence and presence of the serum amyloid P component (SAP), a protein known to interact with amyloid species. In <b>addition,</b> the role <b>of</b> <b>lysozyme</b> in AD has been investigated by  co-expressing human lysozyme and amyloid β in Drosophila. The lysozyme protein is an enzyme naturally found in bodily fluids such as tears, breast milk and saliva. It is engaged in the body’s defense and acts by hydrolyzing the cell wall of invading bacteria. Certain disease-associated point mutations in the gene encoding lysozyme destabilize the protein and cause it to misfold which results in systemic amyloidosis. To investigate the in vivo misfolding behavior <b>of</b> <b>lysozyme</b> we developed and established a Drosophila model <b>of</b> <b>lysozyme</b> amyloidosis. SAP is commonly found attached to amyloid deposits in the body; however, the role of SAP in amyloid diseases is unknown. To investigate the effect <b>of</b> SAP in <b>lysozyme</b> misfolding, these two proteins were co-expressed in Drosophila. The amyloid β peptide is involved in AD, building up the plaques found in AD patient brains. These plaques trigger neuroinflammation and since lysozyme is upregulated during various inflammation conditions, a possible role <b>of</b> <b>lysozyme</b> in AD was investigated by overexpressing lysozyme in a Drosophila model of AD. Interaction between lysozyme and the amyloid β protein was also studied by biophysical measurements. During my work with this thesis, the dual nature <b>of</b> <b>lysozyme</b> emerged; on the one hand a villain, twisted by mutations, causing the lysozyme amyloidosis disease. On the other hand a hero, delaying the toxicity and maybe the neurological damage caused by the amyloid β peptide...|$|R
40|$|Incubating {{and shaking}} Staphylococcus aureus in liquid whole egg causes {{a decline in}} viability. During the period of agitation, the natural pH of the egg rises from about 7. 2 to between 8. 0 and 8. 2 {{as a result of}} a loss of carbon dioxide. However, if the pH of the egg is {{prevented}} from rising, either by not shaking or by <b>addition</b> <b>of</b> a buffer, S. aureus will grow. The cause of death is traced to the presence <b>of</b> <b>lysozyme</b> <b>of</b> egg white. Interestingly, the action <b>of</b> <b>lysozyme</b> is not attributable to its bacterial lytic property but, instead, to the basicity <b>of</b> the <b>lysozyme</b> molecule. This conclusion is supported by the fact that the lytic property <b>of</b> <b>lysozyme</b> is known to have its optimal activity near neutrality and by the finding that protamine sulfate, a nonenzymatic basic polypeptide, also caused death of S. aureus at pH 8. 0 but not at 7. 0. It was postulated that the rise in pH renders the bacterial cells more negatively charged, so that in the presence of positively charged molecules like lysozyme or protamine sulfate a complex is formed, agglutinating the cells...|$|R
