5|$|Nicks {{writes that}} Manning would travel back to Washington, D.C., for visits. An ex-boyfriend helped her {{find her way}} around the city's gay community, {{introducing}} her to lobbyists, activists, and White House aides. Back at Fort Drum, she continued to display emotional problems and, by August 2009, had been referred to an Army mental-health counselor. <b>A</b> <b>friend</b> <b>told</b> Nicks that Manning could be emotionally fraught, describing an evening they had watched two movies together—The Last King of Scotland and Dancer in the Dark—after which Manning cried for hours. By September 2009 her relationship with Watkins was in trouble; they reconciled for a short time, but it was effectively over.|$|E
5|$|The raid on bin Laden's {{compound}} in Abbottabad, Pakistan was launched from Afghanistan. U.S. military {{officials said that}} after the raid U.S. forces took bin Laden's body to Afghanistan for identification, then buried him at sea within 24 hours of his death in accordance with Islamic tradition. According to Carlotta Gall, a Pakistani official (to whom she later clarified {{that she did not}} speak, the information coming through <b>a</b> <b>friend),</b> <b>told</b> her that a senior U.S. official had told him that the United States had direct evidence that Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) chief, Lt. Gen. Ahmad Shuja Pasha, knew of bin Laden's presence in Abbottabad, but ISI, Pasha and officials in Washington all denied this.|$|E
5|$|Following {{rumors of}} cast members from Beverly Hills, 90210 {{appearing}} on the spin-off, The CW confirmed that Shannen Doherty, Jennie Garth, Tori Spelling and Joe E. Tata would be returning in recurring roles as their original characters. Sachs was familiar with Garth, and talked to her about a possible role in the series. Garth agreed to star on the series without reading a script after brainstorming ideas with Sachs. The producers offered Garth a role as a series regular, but she opted to sign on as a recurring character. Doherty decided to appear after talking with Sachs, but her appearance {{was moved to the}} second episode. Sachs described Tata's casting as an accident; <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> <b>told</b> Sachs that he had seen Tata in a store, which led to the offer of a recurring role in the series. Sachs said that Tata was ecstatic about the idea and agreed. After reading the script, Spelling expressed interest in returning, and the writers decided to give her character her own fashion line. Spelling was scheduled to appear in the premiere, but due to personal reasons and the birth of her daughter, she opted to appear later in the season. On August 11, it was reported that Spelling had pulled out of the series after discovering that she was receiving less pay than Garth and Doherty. Spelling asked for her salary of $20,000 per episode to be increased to match their salaries—$40,000 to $50,000 per episode—but when denied she left the show altogether.|$|E

25|$|A {{prominent}} Connecticut official, State Senator George Gunther, and Andy Kosch, a {{high school}} science teacher, pilot, and Whitehead researcher, said that they heard about yet another photograph. They were told that a sea captain named Brown had made a logbook entry describing Whitehead flying over Long Island Sound and had even photographed the airplane in flight. <b>A</b> <b>friend</b> <b>told</b> Kosch {{that he had found}} the captain's leather-bound journal containing a photo of Whitehead in flight and a description of the event. After some difficulty Kosch made contact with the owners of the journal, but they told him it was lost.|$|E

500|$|Duane L. Weber was a World War II Army {{veteran who}} served time {{in at least}} six prisons from 1945 to 1968 for {{burglary}} and forgery. He was proposed as a suspect by his widow, based primarily on a deathbed confession: Three days before he died in 1995, Weber told his wife, [...] "I am Dan Cooper." [...] The name meant nothing to her, she said; but months later, <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> <b>told</b> her of its significance in the hijacking. She went to her local library to research D.B.

50|$|CSM Elder {{emphasized}} {{that there was}} a gap in knowledge among the enlisted ranks. He created the NCO site to fill this void. The NCO site provided tools and discussions on how to use them, how to find what they needed, and how to digest it all. It was all about what to do and how to do your job. <b>As</b> <b>friends</b> <b>told</b> <b>friends,</b> the site became popular. At one point, the NCO site was used by many NCOs in the Army. Dedicated and passionate volunteers gave their personal time and resources to develop, grow, and make the NCO site relevant. Each NCO had a full-time day job. It was a team effort with many unsung heroes. On August 28, 2003, Cmd Sgt Maj. Dan Elder was awarded the first-ever AKM Pioneer Award by the US Army Chief Information Officer.|$|R
500|$|James Madigan, {{the visual}} effects supervisor, {{approached}} the series as a feature film, observing that [...] "every {{aspect of the}} production took meticulous care with every detail, the costumes, the set dressing, the acting, and the attention to historical fact. As you worked on it, you really got the feeling that Rome was {{going to look like}} something we had never seen on TV before, so our vfx approach very much wanted to respect that." [...] Madigan attempted to seamlessly mesh the visual effects with the physical sets and depend less on CGI. <b>A</b> <b>friend</b> <b>told</b> Madigan that after seeing the pilot, [...] "he didn’t see any vfx shots, even though there are dozens of shots throughout episode 1. That means we did our job well." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{author was}} further {{prompted}} {{to write about}} grace when <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> <b>told</b> him about encountering a homeless prostitute in Chicago who began to cry as {{she told him that}} she had raised money for drugs by prostituting her two-year-old child. When Yancey's friend asked the woman if she had sought help at a local church, she answered, [...] "Church? Why would I ever go there? I was already feeling terrible about myself. They'd just make me feel worse." [...] This story convinced Yancey that Christians are doing a poor job of communicating the message that God is willing to accept people, regardless of what they have done; the story haunted him, he said, because the woman was [...] "the type of person who would have gone to Jesus. The more unrighteous a person was, the more comfortable they felt around Jesus".|$|E
500|$|... "I {{think she}} has been very rude {{to a lot of}} people in the past, on her way up – very terse," [...] <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> <b>told</b> the Observer. [...] "She doesn't do small talk. She is never going to be friends with her {{assistant}}." [...] A former assistant said, [...] "You definitely did not ride the elevator with her." [...] Unwritten rules imposed by Wintour at the Vogue offices forbid junior staff from initiating conversation with her; an editor who greeted her on the elevator was reprimanded by one of Wintour's assistants. (She calls that an exaggeration.) A visiting reporter saw a junior staff member appear visibly panicked when she realised she would have to be in the elevator with Wintour. Once a junior editor saw her trip in the hallway, walked past without offering assistance, and was later told she [...] "did absolutely the right thing." ...|$|E

60|$|It {{would not}} {{surprise}} {{me to find}} that many persons have some such material image or presentment of the spiritual entities they are taught to believe in at too tender an age.

2500|$|Many urban legends are {{essentially}} extended jokes, told {{as if they}} were true events. Urban legends typically include common elements: the legend is retold on behalf of the original witness or participant; dire warnings are often given for those who might not heed the advice or lesson contained therein (this forms a typical element of many e-mail phishing scams); and the tale is often touted as [...] "something <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> <b>told</b> me", while the friend is identified by first name only or not identified at all.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{because of}} Eiseley's intense and poetic writing style and {{his focus on}} nature and cosmology, he was not {{accepted}} or understood by most of his colleagues.

You like scholarship, but the scholars, some of them, anyhow, are not going to like you because you don’t stay in the hole where God supposedly put you. You keep sticking your head out and looking around. In a university that’s inadvisable." ...|$|E

She has dated Spin founder and {{publisher}} Bob Guccione, Jr., and conservative writer Dinesh D'Souza. In October 2007, she began dating Andrew Stein, {{the former president of}} the New York City Council, a liberal Democrat. When asked about the relationship, Stein told the paper, [...] "She's attacked a lot of my friends, but what can I say, opposites attract!" [...] On January 7, 2008, however, Stein told the New York Post that the relationship was over, citing irreconcilable differences.

2500|$|<b>A</b> <b>friend</b> <b>told</b> me {{the world}} was shaking. I believe it is, not only the {{physical}} world, but the mental world. There never {{was a time when}} mind was so agitated as the present, not only in this continent, but the Old World is shaken. Witness the revolution in Spain. [...] Human bondage soon will exist only in history, and religious intolerance be a dream of the past, and mind will constitute manhood, not physical types or color of skin. And happy are they who live in this agitation, and assist in its development! How strange that great lessons of truth must be forced upon the mind by error as the contrast, and a startling wrong perpetrated to ensure right, and a long lethargic sleep to produce a full awakening! ...|$|E
