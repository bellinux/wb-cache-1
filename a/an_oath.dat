5|$|Béla was {{the oldest}} son of King Andrew II of Hungary by his first wife, Gertrude of Merania. He {{was born in the}} second half of 1206.

5|$|Count Geoffrey died in 1151 before finalizing the {{division}} of his realm between Henry and Henry's younger brother Geoffrey, who would have inherited Anjou. According to William of Newburgh, who wrote in the 1190s, Count Geoffrey decided that Henry would receive England and Anjou {{for as long as}} he needed the resources for the conflict against Stephen. Count Geoffrey instructed that his body should not be buried until Henry swore <b>an</b> <b>oath</b> that the young Geoffrey would receive Anjou when England and Normandy were secured. W. L. Warren cast doubt on this account on the grounds that it was written later based on a single contemporary source, it would be questionable that either Geoffrey or Henry would consider such <b>an</b> <b>oath</b> binding and it would break the inheritance practice of the time. The young Geoffrey died in 1158, before receiving Anjou, but he had become count of Nantes when the citizens of Nantes rebelled against their ruler. Henry had supported the rebellion.|$|E

5|$|To ease tensions, Grant {{signed the}} Amnesty Act of 1872 on May 23, 1872 that gave amnesty to former Confederates. This act allowed most former Confederates, who {{before the war}} had taken <b>an</b> <b>oath</b> to uphold the Constitution of the United States, to hold elected public office. Only 500 former Confederates {{remained}} unpardonable and therefore forbidden to hold elected public office.|$|E
5|$|To {{prevent any}} action against his testament's {{provisions}} for his son's succession and the regency, Theodore {{on his deathbed}} demanded <b>an</b> <b>oath</b> to be taken by Senate, army, people and clergy, both those present at court and those absent elsewhere in the state. Immediately after his death, George Mouzalon, aware of his vulnerability and his complete lack of support, called an assembly of the leading nobles, officials, and military commanders. He offered to resign from his post in favour of any person that the assembly chose, but the dignitaries, led by Michael Palaiologos, dissuaded him and encouraged him to stay on and even accepted to take <b>an</b> <b>oath</b> of loyalty to him {{as well as to}} the young emperor. It was a sham, as a conspiracy by the leading aristocratic families was well under way to depose him, in which Palaiologos apparently played a covert but leading role.|$|E

5|$|Around 1210, Theodore {{was invited}} by his {{half-brother}} Michael I Komnenos Doukas to Epirus, where Michael had founded an independent Greek principality. Michael wanted Theodore's aid, as his only son, the future Michael II Komnenos Doukas, was underage and illegitimate, while Michael's other half-brothers {{were considered to}} lack the ability to rule. Laskaris allowed Theodore to leave, but bound him with <b>an</b> <b>oath</b> of allegiance to himself and his heirs. Before going to Epirus, Theodore had married Maria Petraliphaina, {{with whom he had}} four children.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the 14th century, Conwy Castle was {{involved}} in the downfall of Richard II. Richard returned from Ireland in August 1399 and took shelter in the castle from the forces of his rival, Henry Bolingbroke. Henry Percy, Bolingbroke's emissary, went into the castle to conduct negotiations with the king. Henry Percy took <b>an</b> <b>oath</b> in the castle chapel to protect the king if he agreed to leave the castle, but when Richard left he was promptly taken prisoner, and was taken away to die later in captivity at Pontefract Castle.|$|E

To further ensure impartiality, {{one third of the}} membership was to be renewed every two years (article 10).|$|E

5|$|Despite {{presiding}} over the conversions of Muslims in his wife's Castilian lands, Ferdinand II did not extend the conversions to his Aragonese subject. Kings of Aragon, including Ferdinand, were required to swear <b>an</b> <b>oath</b> of coronation to not forcibly convert their Muslim subjects. He repeated the same oath to his Cortes (assembly of estates) in 1510, and throughout his life he was unwilling to break it. Ferdinand died in 1516, and was succeeded by his grandson Charles V, who also swore the same oath at his coronation.|$|E
5|$|Emeric, Stephen's {{only son}} to survive infancy, {{died in an}} {{accident}} in 1031. Stephen's cousin Vazul had the strongest claim to the throne, but the King overlooked him and named Peter as his heir. On Stephen's order, Vazul was blinded shortly thereafter and his three sonsLevente, Andrew and Béla exiled, which strengthened Peter's right of succession. The King asked Peter to take <b>an</b> <b>oath</b> respecting the property of his wife, Queen Giselle, suggesting that Peter's relationship with his aunt was tense.|$|E

On September 18, 1865, Hawes took <b>an</b> <b>oath</b> of allegiance to the United States, and was allowed to return to his previous career as a lawyer.|$|E

5|$|In 1833, the Tolpuddle Martyrs {{founded the}} Friendly Society of Agricultural Labourers.

Dorchester Prison was constructed in the town during the 19th century and was used for holding convicted and remanded inmates from the local courts until it closed in December 2013.

5|$|In January 1861, Missouri {{called a}} {{convention}} {{to determine whether}} it would follow the lead of other pro-slavery states and secede from the Union.

Knott resigned his position as attorney general rather than take <b>an</b> <b>oath</b> of allegiance required by the federal government. As a result of his refusal, he was disbarred from practice in the state of Missouri and imprisoned for a short time.|$|E

While Ivan stuck to the plan and signed <b>an</b> <b>oath</b> that he had come with peace to persuade the Byzantines, he promptly retreated to Bulgarian territory upon receiving that order from Michael Shishman.|$|E
