40|$|The {{excessive}} hunt {{of endangered}} animal species {{is the cause of}} their disappearance in the nature. Some African artiodactyls are included in CITES appendixes in order to regulate trade with them to a certain level. This work evaluates a hunting trophy trade with the group of 9 species of African artiodactyls between 2005 and 2010. Registered data from the internet database CITES Trade, which is administered by UNEP - WCMC, was used as a basis. African artiodactyls were traded with in order to get trophies and other parts of their bodies. Specimens of species Hippopotamus amphibius and Kobus leche were traded with the most. North America was the most frequent <b>aiming</b> <b>field</b> for import of specimens from the open nature. Specimens of species Gazella dorcas were traded with the least...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{analyses}} {{a part of}} {{the linguistic}} picture of the world in Czech by means of methods of cognitive and cultural linguistics. It deals with an analysis of the linguistic picture of wind in contemporary Czech. Individual chapters illustrate how native-born Czech speakers perceive phenomena around themselves, how they think and speak about wind (and air as a related phenomenon). The analysis is divided into two parts. The first part analyses the linguistic picture of wind {{from the point of view}} of the system. It examines its lexical definitions, derivatives and its paradigmatic and syntagmatic relationships. The first part deals likewise with etymology of selected words and discusses the designation of wind in Czech dialects and idioms and in old Czech, thereby contributes to a great degree in illuminating the current vocabularies pertaining to wind and related phenomena. The excerptions of historical semantics based on contemporary literary and lexicographic products can also demonstrate the changes and shifts of meaning. The second part examines the linguistic picture of wind in contemporary Czech. It aims, first of all, at the analysis of metaphors adherent to wind. Primarily it observes wind as an <b>aiming</b> <b>field.</b> Chapter 2. 4 shows that we comprehend the very abstract notion of wind metaphorically, [...] ...|$|E

40|$|Boosting {{nonlinear}} {{frequency conversion}} in extremely confined volumes remains a key challenge in nano-optics, nanomedicine, photocatalysis, and background-free biosensing. To this <b>aim,</b> <b>field</b> enhancements in plasmonic nanostructures are often exploited to effectively {{compensate for the}} lack of phase-matching at the nanoscale. Second harmonic generation (SHG) is, however, strongly quenched by the high degree of symmetry in plasmonic materials at the atomic scale and in nanoantenna designs. Here, we devise a plasmonic nanoantenna lacking axial symmetry, which exhibits spatial and frequency mode overlap at both the excitation and the SHG wavelengths. The effective combination of these features in a single device allows obtaining unprecedented SHG conversion efficiency. Our results shed new light on the optimization of SHG at the nanoscale, paving the way to new classes of nanoscale coherent light sources and molecular sensing devices based on nonlinear plasmonic platforms.

The American Kaiju was defeated by forcing it back into human form. Rick Jones got cold feet about throwing in with A.I.M. and fled, and as a result S.H.I.E.L.D. successfully detained Hawkeye.
