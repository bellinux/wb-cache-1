5|$|On September 4, 2007, {{charges against}} Carwin Jones and Theo Shaw {{were reduced to}} aggravated second-degree battery <b>and</b> <b>conspiracy,</b> as were those of Robert Bailey, Jr. on September 10. Bryant Purvis was arraigned on reduced charges of aggravated battery <b>and</b> <b>conspiracy</b> to commit aggravated battery on November 7, 2007, and pleaded not guilty. Because Louisiana law {{considers}} seventeen-year-olds to be adults for purposes of criminal culpability, the charges for these four were unaffected by the appellate ruling overturning Bell's conviction.|$|E
5|$|Flight 739 {{was one of}} two Flying Tiger Line flights with {{military}} connections that were destroyed under similar circumstances on the same day. This led both airline officials and the media to offer suggestions of sabotage <b>and</b> <b>conspiracy.</b>|$|E
5|$|In January 1993, {{a federal}} {{conviction}} followed, on 73 counts of fraud, racketeering <b>and</b> <b>conspiracy.</b> In July 1993, Keating {{was given a}} 12½ year sentence. The judge ordered Keating to pay restitution of $122 million to the government, but Keating said he was $10 million in debt and had no assets to sell.|$|E

5|$|The {{authenticity}} of the head has long been debated, and has resulted in several scientific analyses. The most notable and detailed of these was Karl Pearson and Geoffrey Morant's study conducted in the 1930s, which concluded that the Wilkinson head was that of Cromwell. Rumours <b>and</b> <b>conspiracy</b> theories have circulated since Cromwell's head fell from Westminster Hall.|$|E
5|$|The {{official}} conclusions {{were still}} being debated by academics <b>and</b> <b>conspiracy</b> theorists more than 50 years after the assassination. One such theorist, Texas author Jim Marrs, wrote that most researchers were ready to accept Lovelady as the man in Altgens' photograph. He later wrote that others were resisting any such acceptance.|$|E
5|$|Fastow and his wife, Lea, both {{pleaded guilty}} to charges against them. Fastow was {{initially}} charged with 98 counts of fraud, money laundering, insider trading, <b>and</b> <b>conspiracy,</b> among other crimes. Fastow {{pleaded guilty to}} two charges of conspiracy {{and was sentenced to}} ten years with no parole in a plea bargain to testify against Lay, Skilling, and Causey. Lea was indicted on six felony counts, but prosecutors later dismissed them in favor of a single misdemeanor tax charge. Lea was sentenced to one year for helping her husband hide income from the government.|$|E

5|$|Nominally {{based in}} Alaska, the Sea-based X-band Radar (SBX-1) arrived on Ford Island in 2006 for {{maintenance}} and repairs and has returned several times since. Primarily used as a warhead-detection radar system on a self-propelled floating platform in the Pacific, its presence on the island has been controversial. The platform, with a cost reaching nearly , has never actually made it to Alaska <b>and</b> <b>conspiracy</b> theorists argue that the platform is a mobile version of the High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program.|$|E
5|$|On {{the first}} day one {{prisoner}} pleaded guilty to charges of riot <b>and</b> <b>conspiracy</b> to riot, and was also acquitted of the murder charge. The other defendants were also acquitted of murder due to the unreliability of eyewitness testimony {{and the possibility that}} White had died from a pre-existing thrombotic condition. On 16 April, four defendants including Paul Taylor were convicted of rioting, and the remaining four including Alan Lord were acquitted.|$|E
5|$|The {{remaining}} twelve defendants {{pleaded not}} guilty to conspiracy to commit grievous bodily harm with intent <b>and</b> <b>conspiracy</b> to riot. On 7 December 1992 David Bowen and Mark Azzopardi escaped from the prison van transferring them from HM Prison Hull to the court. Azzopardi was recaptured, before escaping from the court on 17 February 1993 along with five of the other defendants.|$|E

5|$|Upon its publication, {{the book}} {{received}} favorable comments from book reviewers. Thompson later {{claimed that the}} Navy tried to suppress sales by banning the book from Navy exchange stores on Navy bases throughout the world. In 2001, five Navy servicemen named in Thompson's book sued Thompson, the book's publisher, and one of Thompson's sources for libel, false light privacy, <b>and</b> <b>conspiracy.</b> The suit was settled out-of-court in 2007 for undisclosed terms.|$|E
5|$|Within {{days of the}} murder, D.C. police {{alleged that}} the crime scene had been {{tampered}} with, but no charges were filed for over two years. In late 2008, police charged Price, Zaborsky and Ward with obstruction of justice <b>and</b> <b>conspiracy</b> related to alleged tampering with the crime scene. The men were acquitted of the charges in June 2010. No one {{has been charged with}} Wone's killing. In November 2008, Wone's widow filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Price, Zaborsky and Ward; the suit was settled on August 3, 2011 for an undisclosed sum and agreement.|$|E
5|$|Economic {{conditions}} in 1817 {{led to a}} group who became known as Blanketeers to organise a march from Manchester to London so they could petition the Prince Regent for parliamentary reform. A crowd of 25,000 including 5,000 men who intended to march gathered in St Peter's Fields. After the magistrates read the Riot Act, the crowd was dispersed by the King's Dragoon Guards. The ringleaders were arrested and subsequently released when serious charges against them were not forthcoming. In April 1819 three leading Blanketeers were convicted of sedition <b>and</b> <b>conspiracy</b> when witnesses alleged they had advocated the principal towns of the kingdom should elect representatives to a National Convention to demand their rights and if refused enforce them 'sword in hand' during a meeting in Stockport in September 1818.|$|E

5|$|Gordimer's {{homage to}} Fischer extends to using {{excerpts}} from his writings and public {{statements in the}} book. Lionel Burger's treason trial speech from the dock is taken from the speech Fischer gave at his own trial in 1966. Fischer {{was the leader of}} the banned SACP who was given a life sentence for furthering the aims of communism <b>and</b> <b>conspiracy</b> to overthrow the government. Quoting people like Fischer was not permitted in South Africa. All Gordimer's quotes from banned sources in Burger's Daughter are unattributed, and also include writings of Joe Slovo, a member of the SACP and the outlawed ANC, and a pamphlet written and distributed by the Soweto Students Representative Council during the Soweto uprising.|$|E
5|$|In July 1963, police raided Liliesleaf Farm, arresting {{those they}} found there and {{uncovering}} paperwork documenting MK's activities, {{some of which}} mentioned Mandela. The Rivonia Trial began at Pretoria Supreme Court in October, with Mandela and his comrades charged with four counts of sabotage <b>and</b> <b>conspiracy</b> to violently overthrow the government; their chief prosecutor was Percy Yutar. Judge Quartus de Wet soon threw out the prosecution's case for insufficient evidence, but Yutar reformulated the charges, presenting his new case from December 1963 until February 1964, calling 173 witnesses and bringing thousands of documents and photographs to the trial.|$|E
5|$|In United States v. Price (1965), {{eighteen}} Ku Klux Klan {{members were}} charged with murder <b>and</b> <b>conspiracy</b> {{for the deaths of}} James Chaney, Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner, but the charges were dismissed by the trial court. A unanimous Supreme Court, which included Black, reversed the dismissal and ordered the case to proceed to trial. Seven of these men, including fellow Klansmen Samuel Bowers, Cecil Price and Alton Wayne Roberts were found guilty of the crime; eight of them, including Lawrence A. Rainey, were found not guilty; and three of them, including Edgar Ray Killen, had their cases end in a mistrial.|$|E

5|$|In {{parallel}} with the second investigation, a case was being prepared against Det Ch Supt Melvin and Det Insp Dingle. In July 1992 Melvin was charged with perjury <b>and</b> <b>conspiracy</b> to pervert the course of justice, and Dingle with conspiracy. In 1994 their lawyers applied for access to information from Nove's inquiry, {{on the grounds that}} it might help their clients; anything that implicated Winston Silcott would support the detectives' contention that their interview notes were genuine and that Silcott really had, in effect, confessed. The lawyers also argued that the detectives should not be prosecuted until all related criminal proceedings had concluded.|$|E
5|$|Mary Celeste {{was built}} in Spencer's Island, Nova Scotia, and {{launched}} under British registration as Amazon, in 1861. She transferred to American ownership and registration in 1868, when she acquired her new name, and thereafter sailed uneventfully until her 1872 voyage. At the salvage hearings in Gibraltar, following her recovery, the court's officers considered various possibilities of foul play, including mutiny by Mary Celestes crew, piracy by the Dei Gratia crew or others, <b>and</b> <b>conspiracy</b> to carry out insurance or salvage fraud. No convincing evidence supported these theories, but unresolved suspicions led to a relatively low salvage award.|$|E
5|$|Moshe Malul {{pleaded guilty}} to a charge of {{racketeering}} conspiracy, admitting to conspiracy to commit murder <b>and</b> <b>conspiracy</b> to import the drug Ecstasy to the U.S. In his plea agreement, he acknowledged {{that as part of}} the Abergil crime family, he hired members of the Vineland Boyz street gang based in North Hollywood, to kill Sami Atias in retaliation for stealing Ecstasy that belonged to the Abergil organization. He was sentenced to 15 years in prison on June 21, 2012 with credit for time served. He was also ordered to serve three years under supervised release after his release from federal prison.|$|E
