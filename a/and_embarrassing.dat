5|$|Susan's accident-proneness is {{commonly}} used throughout the series to provide comic relief. Her susceptibility to bad luck <b>and</b> <b>embarrassing</b> situations have created some of the series' most memorable moments, including accidentally burning down Edie's house and being locked out of her own house completely naked. Susan's poor cooking skills have also become a running gag in the series.|$|E
5|$|Triple H and Shawn Michaels revived D-Generation X (DX) {{and as a}} team began a {{feud with}} the Spirit Squad. DX played various sophomoric pranks on the Squad and the McMahons (Vince and his son Shane), {{including}} DX dumping green slime onto the group <b>and</b> <b>embarrassing</b> the team afterwards, by defeating them, and dumping feces on the Spirit Squad and the McMahons. DX defeated the Spirit Squad in handicap tag matches at Vengeance, and scoring a clean sweep in an elimination handicap match at Saturday Night's Main Event.|$|E
5|$|Reinforced by {{aircraft}} from Sweden, United Nations peacekeepers {{completed the}} first phase of the operation, securing the Katangese capital, Élisabethville, and destroying much of the Katangese Air Force by the end of the year. In early January the United Nations forces turned their attention towards remaining strongholds in southern Katanga. Indian peacekeepers surpassed their orders and crossed the Lufira River ahead of schedule, generating panic behind the Katangese lines <b>and</b> <b>embarrassing</b> the United Nations leadership. Tshombe, realising that his position was untenable, sued Thant for peace. On 17January 1963, he signed an instrument of surrender and declared the Katangese secession to be over. The central government reorganised the provincial administration of Katanga to weaken its political structure. Tshombe initially participated but feared his arrest and fled to Europe.|$|E

5|$|Throughout the poem, Gawain {{encounters}} numerous trials testing {{his devotion}} {{and faith in}} Christianity. When Gawain sets out on his journey to find the Green Chapel, he finds himself lost, and only after praying to the Virgin Mary does he find his way. As he continues his journey, Gawain once again faces anguish regarding his inevitable encounter with the Green Knight. Instead of praying to Mary, as before, Gawain places his faith in the girdle {{given to him by}} Bertilak's wife. From the Christian perspective, this leads to disastrous <b>and</b> <b>embarrassing</b> consequences for Gawain as he is forced to reevaluate his faith when the Green Knight points out his betrayal. Another interpretation sees the work in terms of the perfection of virtue, with the pentangle representing the moral perfection of the connected virtues, the Green Knight as Christ exhibiting perfect fortitude, and Gawain as slightly imperfect in fortitude by virtue of flinching when under the threat of death.|$|E
25|$|Eventually, Gilmer {{was removed}} from office after many of his orders were seen as abuses of power <b>and</b> <b>embarrassing</b> to the Navy. After his removal from his post, Gilmer {{resigned}} his Navy commission.|$|E
25|$|In the Weekly Maqam, Sephardi Jews {{each week}} base {{the songs of}} the {{services}} {{on the content of}} that week's parashah. For Parashah Ki Tisa, Sephardi Jews apply Maqam Hijaz, the maqam that expresses mourning and sorrow, as the parashah contains the episode of the Golden Calf, a sad <b>and</b> <b>embarrassing</b> episode {{in the history of the}} Israelite people.|$|E

25|$|In mid-1865, {{his public}} {{behaviour}} became irritating <b>and</b> <b>embarrassing</b> to his associates. He {{also began to}} drink immoderately; he spent progressively more time away from his family, sometimes {{in the company of}} a prostitute; and his wife noticed changes in his sexual behavior. On July 13, 1865, the Semmelweis family visited friends, and during the visit Semmelweis's behavior seemed particularly inappropriate.|$|E
25|$|In 2003, Valenti {{found himself}} {{at the center of}} the {{so-called}} screener debate, as the MPAA barred studios and many independent producers from sending screener copies of their films to critics and voters in various awards shows. Under mounting industry pressure and a court injunction Antidote Int'l Films Inc. et al. v MPAA (November 2003), Valenti backed down in 2004, narrowly avoiding a massive <b>and</b> <b>embarrassing</b> antitrust lawsuit against the MPAA.|$|E
25|$|It also {{occasionally}} mocks Australian {{and international}} mass popular culture, such as popular reality television shows Big Brother and Australian Idol. It sometimes makes statements about Australian politics. The crass <b>and</b> <b>embarrassing</b> behaviour of the characters, and their gaudy, out-dated fashion sense are popular {{features of the}} show. Processed and widely recognised Australian foods, such as Jatz crackers, Tim Tams and Fruiche yoghurt are frequently referenced in the series.|$|E

25|$|Several {{members of}} the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests (SNAP) flew to Rome to protest saying Cardinal Law's place of honour was painful to sexual abuse victims <b>and</b> <b>embarrassing</b> to Catholics. Just as the group's members arrived at St. Peter's Basilica, led by founder Barbara Blaine, police {{officers}} escorted them outside the confines of St. Peter's Square. Blaine was unable to pass out fliers to people walking into the Mass offered by Cardinal Law.|$|E
25|$|The {{first episode}} of Broadchurch series one {{was seen by}} an average of 9.1 million viewers (31 percent {{audience}} share). This included 6.15 million live viewers (25.2 percent audience share), with another 716,000 viewers (4.4 percent) on time-delayed viewing via digital video recorder, timeshifted channels (+1), and similar media and technologies. It won its time-slot beating Mayday <b>and</b> <b>Embarrassing</b> Bodies. This was the best premiere episode of a weekday new drama series in the United Kingdom since ITV's Whitechapel debuted in January 2009. Only two other dramas, Life Begins (2002) and Doc Martin (2004), debuted with higher numbers since 2002.|$|E
25|$|Each {{culture of}} human society has {{developed}} social norms {{relating to the}} presence or absence of body hair, which has changed from one time to another. Different standards can apply to females and males. People whose hair falls outside a culture's aesthetic standards may experience real or perceived social acceptance problems. For example, for women in several societies, exposure in public of body hair other than head hair, eyelashes and eyebrows is generally considered to be unaesthetic, unattractive <b>and</b> <b>embarrassing.</b> In Middle Eastern societies, removal of the female body hair has been considered proper hygiene, necessitated by local customs, for many centuries.|$|E

25|$|Casaubon has {{a romance}} with a Brazilian woman named Amparo. He leaves Italy {{to follow her}} and spends a few years in Brazil. While living there, he learns about South American and Caribbean spiritualism, and meets Agliè, an elderly man who implies {{that he is the}} mystical Comte de Saint-Germain. Agliè has a {{seemingly}} infinite supply of knowledge about things concerning the Occult. While in Brazil, Casaubon receives a letter from Belbo about attending a meeting of occultists. At the meeting Belbo was reminded of the Colonel's conspiracy theory by the words of a young woman who was apparently in a trance. Casaubon and Amparo also attend an occult event in Brazil, an Umbanda rite. During the ritual Amparo falls into a trance herself, an experience she finds deeply disturbing <b>and</b> <b>embarrassing,</b> as she is Marxist by ideology and as such disbelieves and shuns spiritual and religious experiences. Her relationship with Casaubon falls apart, and he returns to Italy.|$|E
25|$|In December 1968, Imlach {{was asked}} by Stafford Smythe to give the {{coaching}} job to John McLellan, but Imlach refused and told Smythe to fire him or leave him alone. During the season, Mike Walton walked out on the team, saying he wouldn't play for Imlach again. He returned about a week later. On April 6, 1969, minutes after an early <b>and</b> <b>embarrassing</b> playoff elimination {{at the hands of}} the Boston Bruins, Imlach was fired by the Leafs. He still had a year remaining on his contract, which paid him about $35,000 a year. In the dressing room after the announcement was made, veteran Leafs Johnny Bower and Tim Horton both said they would leave with Imlach (they both returned the following season, although neither would remain with the Leafs for long). Imlach's assistant, Clancy, had previously said that he would walk away if Imlach was fired, but he was persuaded to stay with the team. Jim Gregory was immediately announced as Imlach's replacement as general manager.|$|E
25|$|Following an {{untimely}} <b>and</b> <b>embarrassing</b> death, Kazuma Satō, a Japanese teenage shut-in NEET, meets {{a goddess}} named Aqua, who offers to reincarnate {{him in a}} parallel world with MMORPG elements, where he can go on adventures and battle monsters. Despite being offered a superpowered item or ability to use in this new world, Kazuma, following some provocation, chooses Aqua herself to accompany him {{to the town of}} Axel, quickly finding her absent-mindedness to be less than beneficial. With Aqua unable to return to the afterlife until the Devil King is defeated, the two form a party and recruit two other members; an explosion-obsessed magician named Megumin and a masochistic crusader named Darkness. Due to the party's dysfunctional abilities, Kazuma quickly gives up on the idea of defeating the Devil King and tries to live a luxurious lifestyle, only to find the circumstances of his daily life are forcing him and his party to encounter and battle the Devil King's generals.|$|E

500|$|Until the 1990s, {{literary}} critic William Zinsser says, memoir writers tended to conceal their most personal <b>and</b> <b>embarrassing</b> memories. [...] In the 1970s Satin {{wrote a book}} revealing many such memories as a neopacifist activist during the years 1964–66, Confessions of a Young Exile, published by Gage, a Toronto publishing house soon to merge with Macmillan of Canada. [...] Confessions is [...] "a remarkable exercise in self-exposure", playwright John Lazarus says in a review. [...] "The insights into the hero's motives and fears are so honest, and so mortifyingly true, that it soon becomes evident that the [...] tone is deliberate." ...|$|E
