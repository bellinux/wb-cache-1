5|$|LeRoy King, one of {{the members}} of the Coolidge Mission, wrote in his report that the {{authorities}} in Maribor were suspicious of the work of the mission and apparently feared that it had uncovered information they would have preferred to conceal.

5|$|When {{two species}} {{are similar in}} a {{particular}} character, evolution is defined as parallel if the ancestors were also similar, and convergent if they were not.

5|$|Older {{accounts}} of the Whiskey Rebellion portrayed it as being confined to western Pennsylvania, yet there was opposition to the whiskey tax in the western counties of every other state in Appalachia (Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia). The whiskey tax went uncollected throughout the frontier state of Kentucky, where {{no one could be}} convinced to enforce the law or prosecute evaders. In 1792, Hamilton advocated military action to suppress violent resistance in western North Carolina, but Attorney General Edmund Randolph <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was insufficient evidence to legally justify such a reaction.|$|E
5|$|Rutherford's {{relationship}} with organized labour was never easy. Historian L.G.

McNabb was the first Labour MLA elected in Alberta (he was defeated in his 1909 re-election bid).|$|E

5|$|The 1980s {{also saw}} the birth of Cyc, the first attempt to attack the commonsense {{knowledge}} problem directly, by creating a massive database that would contain all the mundane facts that the average person knows. Douglas Lenat, who started and led the project, <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is no shortcut ― {{the only way for}} machines to know the meaning of human concepts is to teach them, one concept at a time, by hand. The project was not expected to be completed for many decades.|$|E
5|$|The {{residents}} gained {{legal aid}} {{to launch the}} judicial review and <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> were flaws in the planning process. The review took place on 18–19 December 2012 in Manchester {{to decide whether the}} council's planning process was legal. The judge reserved his decision for a month, but decided to reject RURA's claim to quash the planning permission. The final legal action from RURA came to an end after an unsuccessful challenge was made to the Court of Appeal in March 2013.|$|E
5|$|Von Neumann {{was asked}} to write an essay for the layman {{describing}} what mathematics is, and produced a beautiful analysis. He explained that mathematics straddles the world between the empirical and logical, arguing that geometry was originally empirical, but Euclid constructed a logical, deductive theory.

5|$|According to Kuhn, {{science is}} an {{inherently}} communal activity {{which can only}} be done as part of a community. For him, the fundamental difference between science and other disciplines {{is the way in which}} the communities function. Others, especially Feyerabend and some post-modernist thinkers, have <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is insufficient difference between social practices in science and other disciplines to maintain this distinction. For them, social factors play an important and direct role in scientific method, but they do not serve to differentiate science from other disciplines. On this account, science is socially constructed, though this does not necessarily imply the more radical notion that reality itself is a social construct.|$|E
5|$|Appeals to nonviolent {{resistance}} were unsuccessful. On September 11, 1791, {{a recently}} appointed tax collector named Robert Johnson was tarred and feathered by a disguised gang in Washington County. A man sent by officials to serve court warrants to Johnson's attackers was whipped, tarred, and feathered. Because {{of these and}} other violent attacks, the tax went uncollected in 1791 and early 1792. The attackers modeled their actions on the protests of the American Revolution. Supporters of the excise <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was a difference between taxation without representation in colonial America, and a tax laid by the elected representatives of the American people.|$|E
5|$|Furthermore, {{in their}} 1987 sequel The Messianic Legacy, Lincoln, Baigent and Leigh {{suggested}} {{that there was a}} current conflict between the Priory of Sion and the Sovereign Military Order of Malta, which they speculated might have originated from an earlier rivalry between the Knights Templar and Knights Hospitaller during the Crusades. However, for the dramatic structure of The Da Vinci Code, Brown chose the controversial Roman Catholic prelature Opus Dei as the Assassini-like nemesis of the Priory of Sion, despite the fact that no author had ever <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is a conflict between these two groups.|$|E

5|$|However, {{there is}} no {{contemporary}} Byzantine account of the Tabuk expedition, {{and many of the}} details come from much later Muslim sources. It has been <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is in one Byzantine source possibly referencing the Battle of Mu´tah traditionally dated 629, but this is not certain. The first engagements may have started as conflicts with the Arab client states of the Byzantine and Sassanid empires: the Ghassanids and the Lakhmids of Al-Hirah. In any case, Muslim Arabs after 634 certainly pursued a full-blown invasion of both empires, resulting in the conquest of the Levant, Egypt and Persia for Islam. The most successful generals were Khalid ibn al-Walid and 'Amr ibn al-'As.|$|E
5|$|In 1969, Lethbridge {{published}} The Monkey's Tail, {{in which}} he discussed Darwinian evolution. Although agreeing that the evolution of species was an objective fact, he nevertheless <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was a blueprint for existence and that genetic memory was a reality. In a sequel published in 1969, The Legend of the Sons of God – A Fantasy?, Lethbridge argued that extraterrestrials had been responsible for aiding Earth's evolutionary development. Echoing many of the claims made by Erich von Däniken in Chariots of the Gods (1968), Lethbridge argued that the late prehistoric stone circles of the British Isles had been beacons for extraterrestrial spacecraft. In this, his work has been cited as an anticipation of the Earth mysteries movement that expanded across Britain in the following decade.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, Carmen Velazquez lost welfare {{benefits}} from the government under {{the provisions of the}} Temporary Assistance for Needy Families Act (TANF). An attorney from an LSC grantee, Bronx Legal Services, litigated her claim. Bronx Legal Services, on behalf of Velazquez, filed suit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York seeking a declaration that the provision of the act prohibiting challenges to existing welfare law was unconstitutional under the First Amendment. It <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was no way to help Velazquez without challenging the welfare system itself, and sought to challenge the provisions of TANF under which Velazquez lost her benefits; a challenge they could not make due to the 1996 restrictions. The district court denied an injunction.|$|E

5|$|In {{the first}} {{superstring}} revolution in 1984, many physicists turned to string theory {{as a unified}} theory of particle physics and quantum gravity. Unlike supergravity theory, string theory was able to accommodate the chirality of the standard model, and it provided a theory of gravity consistent with quantum effects. Another feature of string theory that many physicists were drawn to in the 1980s and 1990s was its high degree of uniqueness. In ordinary particle theories, one can consider any collection of elementary particles whose classical behavior is described by an arbitrary Lagrangian. In string theory, the possibilities are much more constrained: by the 1990s, physicists had <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> were only five consistent supersymmetric versions of the theory.|$|E
5|$|Subsequently, {{there was}} {{considerable}} confusion over the difference between columbium (niobium) and the closely related tantalum. In 1809, English chemist William Hyde Wollaston compared the oxides derived from both columbium—columbite, with a density 5.918g/cm3, and tantalum—tantalite, with a density over 8g/cm3, {{and concluded that the}} two oxides, despite the significant difference in density, were identical; thus he kept the name tantalum. This conclusion was disputed in 1846 by German chemist Heinrich Rose, who <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> were two different elements in the tantalite sample, and named them after children of Tantalus: niobium (from Niobe) and pelopium (from Pelops). This confusion arose from the minimal observed differences between tantalum and niobium. The claimed new elements pelopium, ilmenium, and dianium were in fact identical to niobium or mixtures of niobium and tantalum.|$|E
5|$|The exact terms {{by which}} Libya gained Aouzou remain partly obscure, and are debated. The {{existence}} of a secret agreement between Tombalbaye and Gaddafi was revealed only in 1988, when the Libyan President exhibited an alleged copy of a letter in which Tombalbaye recognizes Libyan claims. Against this, scholars like Bernard Lanne have <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> never was any sort of formal agreement, and that Tombalbaye had found it expedient {{not to mention the}} occupation of a part of his country. Libya was unable to exhibit the original copy of the agreement when the case of the Aouzou Strip was brought before the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in 1993.|$|E
