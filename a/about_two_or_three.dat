5|$|In February 1975, {{during the}} midst of Tet New Year celebrations, a North Vietnamese deserter {{surrendered}} himself to the ARVN 2nd Brigade Headquarters. Through extensive interrogations, the North Vietnamese soldier revealed the whereabouts of North Vietnamese units; the 10th Infantry Division had encircled Duc Lap, while the 320A Infantry Division had arrived in Ea H’leo and were gearing up for an assault on Thuan Man, and an unknown unit was heading towards Ban Me Thuot. In late February, North Vietnamese artillery shells began to rain down on Pleiku, which convinced General Phu that the North Vietnamese would attack Pleiku instead of Ban Me Thuot. South Vietnamese military intelligence and information received from the American Embassy in Saigon showed the presence of <b>about</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> North Vietnamese combat divisions positioned about 20kilometres away from Kontum and Pleiku. Indeed, the movements around Pleiku and Kontum {{during the month of}} February were designed by the North Vietnamese Tay Nguyen Front to fool South Vietnamese military commanders in the Central Highlands.|$|E
5|$|John Wilson (1847) {{writes that}} the tomb lies <b>about</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> hundred yards {{to the north of}} Jacob's Well, across the valley. He {{describes}} it as 'a small solid erection {{in the form of a}} wagon roof, over what is supposed to be the patriarch’s grave, with a small pillar or altar at each of its extremities, sometimes called the tombs of Ephraim and Manasseh, and the middle of an enclosure without a covering. Many visitors names, in the Hebrew and Samaritan characters, are written on the walls of this enclosure.' One of the inscriptions is said to intimate the tomb's repair by a Jew from Egypt, Elijah son of Meir, around 1749. Wilson adds that 'The Jews of Nablus take upon themselves the duty of keeping the tomb in order. They applied to us for a subscription to aid in making some repairs and we complied with their request'. These Hebrew and Samaritan inscriptions were still visible on the white plastered walls as late as 1980, as were small lamps in an internal recess, probably donated by Jews during the 18th and 19th centuries.|$|E
25|$|Quicksort (sometimes called partition-exchange sort) is an {{efficient}} sorting algorithm, {{serving as a}} systematic method for placing the elements of an array in order. Developed by Tony Hoare in 1959 and published in 1961, {{it is still a}} commonly used algorithm for sorting. When implemented well, it can be <b>about</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> times faster than its main competitors, merge sort and heapsort.|$|E

25|$|The {{government}} decided {{to rebuild a}} fort in stone near the first forts rather than at Kaskakia. Construction began in 1753 and was mostly completed in 1756; however, construction continued at the site for another four years. The limestone fort had walls 15-ft (3m)-high and 3-ft (1m)-thick, enclosing an area of 4 acres (16,000m²). The stone for construction was quarried in bluffs <b>about</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> miles (4km) distant {{and had to be}} ferried across a small lake.|$|E
25|$|Priddy Meeks {{was born}} in 1795. His father, Athe Meeks, moved the family from South Carolina to Grayson County, Kentucky when Meeks was <b>about</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> years old. The family lived there for about 12 years, until they moved to Indiana. Athe Meeks was killed by Native Americans in 1812. After the Native American attack on the family, they moved to French Island, Indiana on the Ohio River. Meeks was married and owned a farm.|$|E
25|$|Three {{surveillance}} officers, codenamed Hotel 1, Hotel 3 and Hotel 9, followed Menezes {{onto the}} train. According to Hotel 3, Menezes {{sat down with}} a glass panel to his right about two seats in. Hotel 3 then took {{a seat on the}} left with <b>about</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> passengers between Menezes and himself. When the firearms officers arrived on the platform, Hotel 3 moved to the door, blocked it from closing with his left foot, and shouted 'He's here!' to identify the suspect's location.|$|E

[...] But the sixteen oarsmen still {{continued}} their talk; and, after pulling <b>about</b> for <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> hours, we spied the recall-signal at the frigate's fore-t'-gallant-mast-head, and returned on board, having seen no sign {{even of the}} life-buoys.|$|R

25|$|There were 21 known mansas of the Mali Empire after Mari Djata I, and {{probably}} <b>about</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> more {{yet to be}} revealed. The names of these rulers come down through history via the djelis and modern descendants of the Keita dynasty residing in Kangaba. What separates these rulers from the founder, other than the latter's historic role in establishing the state, is their transformation of the Manden Kurufaba into a Manden Empire. Not content to rule fellow Manding subjects unified by the victory of Mari Djata I, these mansas would conquer and annex Fula, Wolof, Bamana, Songhai, Tuareg and countless other peoples into an immense empire.|$|E
25|$|Archaeological dissent {{from this}} view {{began with the}} work of Carlo Maria Rosini in 1797, to be {{followed}} by a succession of archaeologists putting forward evidence to the contrary, though mainstream scholarly opinion has long been in favour of August 24. Discussion on the subject has increased somewhat in recent years. Some of the archaeological evidence from Pompeii does suggest that the town may likely have been buried <b>about</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> months later. For example, people interred in the ashes appear to be wearing warmer clothing than the light summer clothes that would be expected in August. The fresh fruit, olives, and vegetables in the shops are typical of October, and conversely the summer fruit that would have been typical of August was already being sold in dried, or conserved form. Wine fermenting jars had been sealed over, and this would have happened around the end of October. The coins found in the purse of a woman buried in the ash include a commemorative coin that should have been minted at the end of September.|$|E
25|$|On 21 May Cruiser was {{south of}} St Abb's Head when at 11a.m. she sighted two luggers further south. Wollaston set off after them, but {{the weather was}} too {{unsettled}} for him to keep them continually in sight. Still, by correctly estimating where they were headed {{he was able to}} catch up by 4:30, only to have a sudden gust of wind take away Cruizers main-top-gallant=mast. Cruizer was not able to catch up with them again until 9p.m. Wollaston was not able to close and lost sight of them again. However, at daylight, as Cruizer was <b>about</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> leagues off Scarborough Castle, Wollaston again sighted one of the luggers about eight miles away. After a six-hour chase, Cruizer captured the privateer, {{which turned out to be}} Deux Freres, Captain Jacques Bellet, 14 guns (12 of which she had thrown overboard during the chase), and 50 men. She was from Calais and had been cruising since 16 April. Captain Bellet informed Wollaston that the second lugger was Tipoo Sahib, of 12 guns. Tipoo Sahib had thrown all her guns and her boat overboard during the chase and had gone either to France or Norway. Wollaston decided that as 26 of his crew were away in prizes, and he had 50 prisoners on board, that he would come into Yarmouth to land the prisoners before returning to his station.|$|E

50|$|On January 16, 2012, George turned 75 and {{formally}} submitted {{his resignation}} to Pope Benedict XVI. George noted he is a rarity among Chicago's bishops for having {{lived to see}} the possibility of retirement. He named the Very Reverend Father Peter F. Śnieg, Rector of St. Joseph's Seminary at Loyola University Chicago, the Moderator of the Curia for the Archdiocese. At that time George anticipated remaining in office for <b>about</b> another <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> years.|$|R
500|$|Jazz drummer Jimmy Chamberlin was {{recommended}} {{by a friend}} of Corgan's. Chamberlin knew little of alternative music and immediately changed {{the sound of the}} nascent band. As Corgan recalled of the period, [...] "We were completely into the sad-rock, Cure kind of thing. It took <b>about</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> practices before I realized that the power in his playing was something that enabled us to rock harder than we could ever have imagined." [...] On October 5, 1988, the complete band took the stage {{for the first time at}} the Cabaret Metro.|$|E
500|$|In early 1977, {{outgoing}} Mint Director Mary Brooks sent {{a list of}} 117 nominees to the new president, Jimmy Carter, {{from which}} {{it was expected that}} <b>about</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> dozen names would be selected. Carter refused to make any public appointments, feeling the Assay Commission was unneeded given that the Mint performed the same work through routine internal checks and that the $2,500 appropriated each year was a poor use of taxpayer money. Only government members served on the Assay Commission in 1977–1980. [...] Even so, hundreds of numismatists applied to be on the 1978 commission. [...] Carter made no appointments that year; the only members were those designated by statute.|$|E
500|$|Novgorod {{was armed}} with two 20-calibre 11-inch rifled muzzle-loading guns. The guns could {{penetrate}} 11 inches of armour {{at a range}} of their [...] shells had a muzzle velocity of [...] Their rate of fire was very slow, about one round every 10 minutes. The guns were mounted on separate revolving turntables that could be moved independently or locked together. Each turntable took <b>about</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> minutes to rotate 180°. Gunnery trials in November 1874 showed that the locks for the turntables were too weak; {{so much so that}} the gun's recoil could cause them to rotate, leading to the persistent myth that the whole ship rotated when a gun fired. Reinforcement of the locks solved the problem, but the myth persisted.|$|E
60|$|The {{others had}} looked on curiously when the lads first came down, but they soon turned away indifferently {{and took up}} their former pursuits. Some were playing cards, others lying <b>about</b> half-asleep. <b>Two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> who were {{fortunate}} enough to be possessed of tobacco were smoking. In all there were some forty men. When the evening meal was served out the sailor placed {{one of the boys}} on each side of him, and saw that they got their share.|$|R
5000|$|William Elder came to Harlansburg <b>about</b> 1807-8, <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> {{years after}} his father, John Elder, settled in the township. He soon after opened a small general store, in a space of about five by ten feet, where the bar now is in the [...] "Benard House." [...] A postoffice was {{established}} in the village, probably about 1811-12, and Mr. Elder also had the honor of being the first postmaster, so far as can be learned from those who remember.|$|R
60|$|One evening, I went up into my room, having {{absolutely}} {{nothing else to}} do, and there I found Colbert, writing. I suppose he was writing a letter, {{but there was no}} need of doing this at night, as the mail would not go out for several days, and there would be plenty of time to write in the daytime. He hadn't done anything but lounge <b>about</b> for <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> days. Perhaps he came up here to write because he had nothing else to do.|$|R
500|$|After {{the release}} and minor {{success of the}} band's debut album, Gish, The Smashing Pumpkins were being hyped as [...] "the next Nirvana". However, the band was {{experiencing}} several difficulties at the time. Drummer Jimmy Chamberlin was undergoing an increasingly severe addiction to heroin; James Iha and D'arcy Wretzky had recently broken up their romantic relationship; and Billy Corgan had become overweight, depressed {{to the point of}} contemplating suicide, and plagued by writer's block. Corgan recalled that [...] "after the first album, I became completely suicidal. It was an eight-month depression, give or take a month, and I was pretty suicidal for <b>about</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> months." [...] Under the pressure and other complications, the Pumpkins entered the Triclops Sound Studios in Atlanta to record the follow-up to Gish.|$|E
500|$|When {{playing for}} Bermuda, Goater {{was often the}} only {{professional}} player in the team. Bermudian journalist Chris Gibbons described the difference between Goater and his teammates: [...] "He's a class above every other player on the island. Before he went to England he was just quick, but now he's a totally different player, a lot more aggressive and a much better header of the ball. The problem has been that he sets up chances for the others without them being on the same wavelength." [...] However, Goater noted that this had a detrimental aspect: [...] "My fitness dropped off while I was with Bermuda. It was like being on holiday. The team just ate what they liked. I kept to my professional diet for <b>about</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> weeks until peer pressure took over." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the text}} {{accompanying}} the first recording of Sonatas and Interludes, Cage specifically {{stated that the}} use of preparations is not a criticism of the instrument, but a simple practical measure. Cage started composing for prepared piano in 1940, when he wrote a piece called Bacchanale for a dance by Syvilla Fort, and by 1946 had already composed a large number of works for the instrument. However, in Sonatas and Interludes the preparation is very complex, more so than in any of the earlier pieces. Forty-five notes are prepared, mostly using screws and various types of bolts, but also with fifteen pieces of rubber, four pieces of plastic, several nuts and one eraser. It takes <b>about</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> hours to prepare a piano for performance. Despite the detailed instructions, any preparation is bound to be different from any other, and Cage himself suggested that there is no strict plan to adhere to: [...] "if you enjoy playing the Sonatas and Interludes then do it so that it seems right to you".|$|E

500|$|Two {{distinct}} {{types of}} prey capture behavior {{have been observed}} in the marbled electric ray. The first is [...] "jumping", used by the ray to attack prey fish that swim close to its head, typically no farther than [...] In the [...] "jump", the ray pulls back its head and then thrusts its disc upwards, reaching <b>about</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> times {{as high as the}} prey fish is from the bottom. Simultaneously, it makes a single tail stroke and produces a high-frequency (230–430 Hz, increasing with temperature) burst of electricity. The initial electric burst is very short, containing only 10–64 pulses, but is still strong enough to cause tetanic contraction {{in the body of the}} prey fish, often breaking its vertebral column. As the ray glides forward, the motion of the jump sweeps the now-paralyzed prey beneath it, whereupon it is enveloped by the disc and maneuvered to the mouth. Electric bursts continues to be produced during this process; the total number of electric pulses over a single jump increases with size, ranging from 66 in a newborn [...] long to 340 in an adult [...] long. The jump lasts no more than two seconds.|$|E
