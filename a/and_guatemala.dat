5|$|Prior {{to making}} {{landfall}} near the El SalvadorGuatemala border as a tropical depression, the precursor disturbance dropped heavy rainfall over Nicaragua, which later spread into El Salvador <b>and</b> <b>Guatemala.</b> Many rivers {{in the region}} burst their banks after five days of rainfall, causing severe flooding and multiple mudslides. Throughout Central America, at least 1,432people were killed, {{with most of the}} fatalities occurring in El Salvador <b>and</b> <b>Guatemala.</b> Another 225deaths were attributed to floods from the depression in southern Mexico. In addition, Paul was responsible for moderate damage and 24fatalities in northwestern Mexico, where it made landfall at hurricane strength.|$|E

5|$|A {{year after}} González Dávila's {{discovery}} of the Gulf of Fonesca, various Spanish expeditions set out to conquer the territory of Honduras. These expeditions were launched southwards from Mexico <b>and</b> <b>Guatemala,</b> and northwards from Panama and Nicaragua; their rival captains clashed in Honduras, resulting in attempts at conquest of the natives being punctuated by battles between competing Spanish forces, and infighting within individual Spanish groups. The various Spanish groups also fielded indigenous auxiliaries to support their efforts.|$|E
5|$|Although Panama and Costa Rica {{were not}} in the direct path of Hurricane Beta, storm {{warnings}} were issued for the two countries on October27 as heavy rains, up to 20in (508mm), from the outer bands of Beta were possible. The Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in Panama alerted officials in Nicaragua, Honduras, Costa Rica, El Salvador <b>and</b> <b>Guatemala</b> about the possible impacts from Beta. Civil defence officials in El Salvador declared a pre-emptive alert due to the possibility of rain-triggered mudslides from the outer bands of Beta.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Francelia brought {{significant}} flooding to Central America, especially Belize <b>and</b> <b>Guatemala.</b> The sixth named {{storm and}} fourth hurricane of the 1969 Atlantic hurricane season, Francelia developed from a tropical wave {{in the southeastern}} Caribbean Sea on August29. It moved west-northwestward and strengthened into a tropical storm on the following day. On September1, Francelia reached hurricane status, shortly before re-curving west-southwest. While approaching Central America, the storm intensified and peaked as a 115mph (185km/h) Category3 hurricane on September2. Francelia weakened slightly before making landfall near Punta Gorda, Belize (then British Honduras) late on September3. The storm quickly weakened inland and dissipated by the following day.|$|E

5|$|Petén {{was first}} {{penetrated}} by Hernán Cortés with a sizeable expedition that crossed the territory {{from north to}} south in 1525.

5|$|During his {{successful}} {{campaign for the}} U.S. presidency, Dwight Eisenhower pledged to pursue a more proactive anti-communist policy, promising to roll back communism, rather than contain it. Working {{in an atmosphere of}} increasing McCarthyism in government circles, Eisenhower was more willing than Truman to use the CIA to depose governments the U.S. disliked. Although PBFORTUNE had been quickly aborted, tension between the U.S. <b>and</b> <b>Guatemala</b> continued to rise, especially with the legalization of the communist PGT, and its inclusion in the government coalition for the elections of January 1953. Articles published in the U.S. press often reflected this predisposition to see communist influence; for example, a New York Times article about the visit to Guatemala by Chilean poet Pablo Neruda highlighted his communist beliefs, but neglected to mention his reputation as the greatest living poet in Latin America.|$|E
5|$|Independent Maya {{frequently}} attacked Christianised Maya {{settlements and}} encouraged such settlements {{to abandon their}} new religion and resist the Spanish. As Spanish military expeditions were launched against the Maya with increasing frequency, independent Maya communities began to request the presence of missionaries to avoid armed conflict. The Itza attempted to use neighbouring Maya groups, such as the Yalain, as a buffer against Spanish encroachment; they may also have instigated rebellions by neighbouring groups that were already undergoing incorporation into the Spanish Empire. With Spanish attempts to penetrate the region divided between mutually independent colonial authorities in Yucatán <b>and</b> <b>Guatemala,</b> at times the Itza would be making peaceful overtures on one front while fighting on the other.|$|E
5|$|Late on October29, Mitch {{weakened}} to {{tropical storm}} status. It moved slowly across Honduras, {{turning to the}} west. The large circulation dropped heavy rainfall throughout Central America, particularly in Honduras and Nicaragua, causing widespread flooding. While over land, Mitch initially maintained an area of deep convection, which allowed it to maintain tropical storm force winds. On October31, the circulation became poorly defined while moving over increasingly mountainous terrain; however, the strongest convection persisted over the adjacent Pacific Ocean, and the NHC noted the potential for Mitch to become a Pacific tropical cyclone. Later that day, Mitch weakened into a tropical depression near the border of Guatemala and Honduras. An approaching trough weakened the ridge in the western Gulf of Mexico, allowing Mitch to make the long-intended turn to the northwest. Convection gradually diminished, and the surface circulation of Mitch dissipated on November1 near the border of Mexico <b>and</b> <b>Guatemala.</b>|$|E

5|$|Late on September 17 when Greta's eye {{was just}} {{offshore}} Honduras, the country's government issued a hurricane warning {{for the eastern}} coastline. Around the same time, the Mexican government issued a hurricane warning for the eastern Yucatán peninsula, and on September 18 a hurricane warning was issued for the Belize <b>and</b> <b>Guatemala</b> coastlines. These advanced warnings helped reduce fatalities. In Puerto Castilla, Honduras, about 2,000 people were evacuated {{in advance of the}} storm. The Honduran government put its military, police, and Red Cross on standby in advance of the storm, due to fears of a repeat of Hurricane Fifi in 1974. However, unlike Fifi, which caused deadly floods in the region four years prior and took a similar track, Greta did not cause as significant river flooding in Honduras.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Andres is {{one out of}} two {{tropical}} cyclones {{on record}} to strike El Salvador. The first named storm of the active 1997 Pacific hurricane season, Andres formed on June 1 {{off the coast of}} Mexico. It initially moved toward the coast, although a change in steering winds turned the storm toward Mexico <b>and</b> <b>Guatemala.</b> After passing just offshore, Andres again changed direction toward the southeast, gradually weakening in the process. On June 7, it turned toward and hit El Salvador before dissipating. The storm brought rainfall to coastlines along much of its path, destroying some houses and inflicted damage. Two fishermen were reported missing in Nicaragua due to high seas, and there were four deaths in El Salvador.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Barbara was {{the first}} {{tropical}} cyclone to make landfall during the 2007 Pacific hurricane season. The second storm of the season, Barbara developed from a small low pressure area on May 29 about 235miles (380km) southeast of Acapulco, Mexico. The system drifted southward before turning to a steadily eastward motion, and quickly intensified into a tropical storm. Increased wind shear weakened Barbara, though it re-organized to attain peak winds of 50mph (85km/h) before moving ashore {{just west of the}} border of Mexico <b>and</b> <b>Guatemala.</b> It rapidly weakened over land, and on June 2 the National Hurricane Center discontinued advisories on the storm. Despite expectations that the storm would attain hurricane status, Barbara moved ashore as a small, weak tropical storm. It produced locally heavy rainfall and gusty winds, and in most locations damage was minor. However, in southern Mexico, the rainfall destroyed large areas of cropland, with crop damage totaling 200million pesos (2007MXN, $55million 2007USD). In El Salvador, four people were killed by storm-induced floods.|$|E

5|$|Tropical Storm Olaf was an erratic and {{long-lived}} {{tropical cyclone}} that brought heavy rainfall to regions of Mexico, {{which would be}} devastated by Hurricane Pauline a week later. The sixteenth named storm of the 1997 season, Olaf formed on September 26 off the southern coast of Mexico. It moved northward and quickly intensified, reaching peak winds of 70mph (120km/h) before weakening and hitting Oaxaca as a tropical depression. In Mexico, El Salvador, <b>and</b> <b>Guatemala,</b> the system brought heavy rainfall, which killed 18 people and caused flooding and damage. It was originally thought that Olaf dissipated over Mexico, although its remnants continued westward for a week. It interacted with Hurricane Pauline, which caused Olaf {{to turn to the}} southeast and later to the north to strike Mexico again, finally dissipating on October 12.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on September 29, 1998 and on October 5, an area of convection along the wave developed into Atlantic Hurricane Lisa. The wave axis continued westward, and after crossing Central America a low-level circulation developed on October 13, about 170miles (275km) south of the border between El Salvador <b>and</b> <b>Guatemala.</b> The system drifted northwestward, and as convection increased around the center a banding featured began to develop. At 0000UTC on October 15, the National Hurricane Center designated it as Tropical Depression Fourteen-E. The depression contained a large envelope of convective activity, and under favorable conditions including warm water, low vertical wind shear and good outflow, it gradually began to intensify. Initially, the exact direction of forward movement was somewhat uncertain, although a northwestward track was predicted. On the morning of October 15, visible satellite imagery suggested that the center of circulation was located northeast of the previous estimates. Thunderstorm activity organized close to the center by 1400UTC, and by 1800UTC the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Lester.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time as Cerezeda was {{establishing}} a new base of operations in the west, Cristóbal de la Cueva entered Honduras from Guatemala with 40 men, under orders from Jorge de Alvarado, brother of Pedro de Alvarado, who was acting as governor while Pedro was fighting in Ecuador. De la Cueva was looking to establish a suitable Caribbean port and a connecting road to Santiago de los Caballeros de Guatemala. Cerezeda intercepted the Guatemalan captain, and the two came to an arrangement whereby Cerezeda would take command of de la Cueva's detachment of soldiers, who would assist him in his efforts to explore and conquer the area around Buena Esperanza. In return, Cerezeda would establish the port and road inland to Santiago de Guatemala. The original plan was to reestablish either Puerto de Caballos or San Gil de Buena Vista, but de la Cueva changed his mind, and instead argued for a new inland colony, which was opposed by Cerezeda. De la Cueva's men became rebellious and refused to recognise Cerezeda's command, and de la Cueva abandoned Higueras and marched south to reinforce San Miguel (in modern El Salvador), near the Gulf of Fonseca. This brought San Miguel within the jurisdiction of Guatemala; Cerezeda considered it to be within the territory of Honduras-Higueras, and vociferously protested to the Crown. Jurisdiction over San Miguel remained a source of contention between Honduras <b>and</b> <b>Guatemala</b> for some years to come.|$|E
