5|$|After {{his army}} crossed the Euphrates, {{following}} a route opened up by Lucullus {{over a hundred}} years before, he received envoys from Tiridates and Vologases. At the approach of such a large force, and aware of Corbulo's ability as a general, the two Arsacids were anxious to negotiate. Indeed, Corbulo, no doubt on instructions from Nero, reiterated the old Roman position: if Tiridates would accept his crown from Rome, then renewed war could be averted. Tiridates readily <b>agreed</b> to negotiations, and Rhandeia, the scene of last year's Roman defeat, was <b>agreed</b> upon as a meeting place. To the Armenians, this place was intended as a reminder of their strength, while Corbulo <b>agreed</b> to it because there he hoped to expunge the earlier disgrace, by peace or war. Once there, Corbulo put Paetus' son, who served under him as a legate, in charge of a party that was to gather the remains of the Roman soldiers and ensure them a proper burial. On the <b>agreed</b> day, both Tiridates and Corbulo, each accompanied by 20 horsemen, met between the two camps. Tiridates <b>agreed</b> to travel to Rome and seek confirmation of his crown from Nero. In sign of this agreement, a few days later, both armies put on a display, arrayed in full parade gear. Tiridates approached the Roman camp, where a statue of the Emperor Nero had been erected upon a raised platform, and placed his royal diadem at its feet in submission.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Clinical {{practice}} guidelines play {{an important}} role in practitioner and patient decisions regarding appropriate clinical health care and in health policy formation. In the guideline development process, inappropriate methodologies and development strategies significantly influence the quality of guidelines; therefore, research and evaluation of guidelines have great significance. The original Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (<b>AGREE)</b> instrument was published in 2003 by a group of international guideline developers and researchers. <b>AGREE</b> has important significance for the quality guarantee and successful implementation of guidelines, and has extensively achieved endorsement since 2003. In 2009, The <b>AGREE</b> Collaboration has developed the <b>AGREE</b> Ⅱ by refining the original <b>AGREE</b> instrument. At present, the <b>AGREE</b> Ⅱ has already replaced the original <b>AGREE</b> instrument; however, related introduction regarding <b>AGREE</b> Ⅱ has not been found in China. The authors of this article briefly introduce the <b>AGREE</b> Ⅱ, and believe that it will add value to research and evaluation of the guidelines...|$|R
