500|$|Ted Shackelford, {{who plays}} Gary, {{described}} the love story, [...] "I can't complain. I mean, Gary spent {{six or seven}} years being led down the primrose path by one stupid broad after another. So with Val... You'd think after 13 years, at the age they are [...] and the amount of bullshit they've been through, they would have learned something! They'd probably have a very comfortable life by now. But it makes for a dead story line." [...] When asked about working with Van Ark, he said: [...] "I don't know how it could get any better. [...] She's remarkable, and I'm not blowing smoke up your ass. I'd tell you if I thought she was <b>a</b> <b>pain</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ass,</b> although sometimes she is <b>a</b> <b>pain</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ass.</b> But my best work is done with Joan." [...] Van Ark also discussed Valene's relationship with her daughter, Lucy Ewing. She said, [...] "The spine or the beginning of the series was Gary and Val, coming over from Dallas, so maybe there should have been more Lucy. I do know that CBS and the producers of both shows wanted to keep the two shows separate but in the beginning you had Larry Hagman and others going over to Knots." ...|$|E
500|$|Moore doubletracked his vocals, but {{apart from}} {{occasional}} use of delay did not use any effects on his vocals. He used an Elektron Monomachine and a Minimoog Voyager with computer software to produce the keyboard sounds on the album. Matheos detuned his guitars to C# and sometimes B instead of using a seven-string guitar because he prefers {{the sound of a}} detuned guitar: [...] "To me, they sound totally different if you have those nice loose, floppy strings," [...] he said. [...] "It's a real bitch to keep them in tune, stopping every couple measures, retuning and punching back in. Especially for [...] song that's in B, or even C# is a problem sometimes, especially if you're doing a lot of fast moving around or high up on the neck. It's <b>a</b> <b>pain</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ass,</b> but I really like that sound. I don't think I would ever go to a 7-string." ...|$|E

2500|$|La Torre {{wrote the}} lyrics to [...] "Don't Look Back", {{predominantly}} basing them on a poem about moving on, which he wrote many years prior when he was [...] "in a really weird place personally". He explains that the song is about [...] "taking charge of [...] own life and not making up excuses for why life is such <b>a</b> <b>pain</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ass</b> sometime," [...] because La Torre believes that we control our own destiny, and are responsible for our own successes and failures. He has also said: [...] "It's about scenarios of despair, but people are finding the beauty in the very simple things in life." [...] Looking for [...] "some kind of resolver or conclusion" [...] to make the lyrics make sense, {{he came up with}} a chant: [...] "Magnetize what you conceptualize because your thoughts become things", a thought process based on the law of attraction from the book The Secret. The chant is repeated three times {{near the end of the}} song; La Torre says [...] "it used to build up even more" [...] in the original demo.|$|E
2500|$|He {{is listed}} as Vice President at Algae Systems, a Nevada-based company with a working demo-scale pilot plant in Daphne, Alabama, {{dedicated}} to commercializing novel methods at the water-energy nexus for growing microalgae offshore as a second-generation biofuels feedstock and converting it to useful crude via hydrothermal liquefaction, while simultaneously treating wastewater, reducing carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere, and producing biochar. At Startup Grind Jackson Hole on March 13, 2015, Barlow {{said that he was}} motivated to team up with Algae Systems after undergoing back surgery to address pain from an old ranching injury, while he had been an advisor to Herb Allison (president of Merrill Lynch at the time) and working to completely [...] "electronify" [...] financial transactions and speculative asset assembly (Barlow was named [...] "One of the 25 Most Influential People in Financial Services" [...] in the June 1999 issue of FutureBanker Magazine). The surgery successfully alleviated the pain and catalyzed Barlow to change his focus from building wealth to building infrastructure in order {{to do something about the}} “amount of alterations we are already enacting on Planet Earth... We are not necessarily making it warmer, but weirder.” At Startup Grind Jackson Hole, Barlow also explained how once over tea with “Grandmother of the Conservation Movement” Mardy Murie, he was inspired by her words, “Environmentalists can be <b>a</b> <b>pain</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ass...</b> But they make great ancestors.” Adopting this philosophy, Barlow says, “I want to be a good ancestor." ...|$|E

5000|$|... "Accident of Birth" [...] is {{the first}} single from Bruce Dickinson's fourth solo album, Accident of Birth, {{released}} in 1997 and peaking at number 54 in the UK Singles Chart. Dickinson described the song as [...] "about a family from Hell. Except they're in Hell {{and one of them}} has accidentally been born, and they want him back and he doesn't want to go. For all the same reasons that you wouldn't {{want to go back to}} your family if they're <b>a</b> <b>pain</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ass,</b> he doesn't want to go back to his family.

5000|$|... "What <b>A</b> <b>Pain</b> <b>In</b> <b>The</b> <b>Ass</b> It Is…" [...] is {{a scathing}} track {{although}} Reyne {{has no intention}} of unveiling just who might be the song’s unnamed protagonist. “When it started off there was someone who inspired it, in the beginning, but not really, It quickly becomes just the usual amalgam of stuff and then you make up stuff, and then it just becomes a matter of playing with the words — you start enjoying yourself just playing with the words to make little twists and turns and rhymes and things like that. But there’s a rough basis in something, although I don’t want to say who it is obviously. And I wouldn’t want to qualify the person." ...|$|E

[...] Sherlock Holmes director Guy Ritchie describes the couple as [...] "the greatest illustration of a symbiotic marriage that I've ever seen.

5000|$|Lane {{appeared}} {{in more than}} 250 films and hundreds of television shows and was uncredited in many of them. On his busiest days, Lane said he sometimes played more than one role, getting into costume and filming his two or three lines, then hurrying off to another set for a different costume and a different role. As for being typecast, Lane described it as [...] "... <b>a</b> <b>pain</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ass.</b> You did something that was pretty good, and the picture was pretty good. But that pedigreed you into that type of part, which I thought was stupid and unfair, too. It didn't give me a chance, but it made the casting easier for the studio." [...] In the years 1940 through 1942, Charles Lane is recorded as having {{appeared in}} sixty-seven parts.|$|E
5000|$|The {{point of}} ango is: Sessa-takuma. I used this term {{a number of}} times in the past. It {{consists}} of four Chinese characters: 切磋琢磨 The first means to cut (a bone or elephant tusk), the second to rub, the third to crush (a stone or gem), the fourth to polish. As a whole, it describes how various hard materials grind each others and during this process are all refined ... Ango is important exactly because it can be <b>a</b> <b>pain</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ass</b> to live with others who go on our nerves, occupy our space and demand our time, have different habits and different vies, different outlooks on life etc. They often show us a mirror because life in the monastery forces them to do so, when people in the world would just step out off our way.|$|E
