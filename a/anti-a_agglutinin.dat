40|$|The <b>anti-A</b> <b>agglutinin</b> of {{the snail}} Otala lactea, {{the most potent}} non-immune source of anti-A thus far discovered, was {{partially}} purified and studied serologically. Studies were made {{of the effect of}} chemical alteration on the specificity. Coupling diazotized p-aminophenyl-Î±-N-acetyl-[14 C]galactoside to the purified lectin greatly enhanced the agglutinating activity of the lectin for group B erythrocytes, without significantly affecting its activity for A 1, A 2 or 0 (no anti- 0 activity) cells. Treatment of the lectin with phenylazo-benzoyl [14 C] (PAB) chloride did not significantly alter its activity or specificity. The anti-B activity conferred by the first of these treatments could be inhibited by sufficient amounts of galactose...|$|E
