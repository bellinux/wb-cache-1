5|$|Barry Island, just offshore, {{was popular}} with day trippers. They could reach it over {{stepping}} stones <b>at</b> <b>low</b> <b>tide</b> or by boat at other times.|$|E
5|$|The {{lighthouse}} {{is managed}} {{as part of}} the Tomaree National Park. Access to the lighthouse is difficult, either through a narrow spit of sand <b>at</b> <b>low</b> <b>tide</b> or by boat.|$|E
5|$|The {{wreck of}} the SS Vina, a cargo steamer built in 1894, can be seen <b>at</b> <b>low</b> <b>tide.</b> In 1944, she was {{anchored}} offshore for use as an RAF target when a gale dragged her to her present location and sank her. After the war, some of the wreck was salvaged as scrap. The remains of the Vina are accessible <b>at</b> <b>low</b> <b>tide,</b> but visiting them is potentially hazardous as the wreck is quickly cut off and submerged by the incoming tide. A warning sign on the wreck advises anyone reaching it {{to return to the}} beach immediately.|$|E
50|$|A Phoenix breakwater, a {{concrete}} caisson that {{was intended to}} be part of a wartime Mulberry Harbour, is visible in the bay <b>at</b> <b>low</b> <b>tides.</b>|$|R
50|$|Typically seen <b>at</b> <b>low</b> <b>tides,</b> Zubof Rock {{is about}} 400 yd long {{from north to}} south. It is about 0.375 mi {{southwest}} of Crow Island.|$|R
50|$|Ko Man Nok-Ko Man Nai (เกาะมันนอก-เกาะมันใน) {{are small}} islands {{opposite}} Hat Kai Bae with surrounding beaches <b>at</b> <b>low</b> <b>tides</b> and golden seaweed {{in the nearby}} shallows.|$|R
5|$|The atoll {{consists}} of four islets: Acadia, Pandora, Westward and Edwards. The last three of these can be accessed on foot from Acadia <b>at</b> <b>low</b> <b>tide.</b> The islets were named by Harald Rehder and John Randall, who visited the atoll during an expedition by the Smithsonian Institution in 1975.|$|E
5|$|The beach of Weston Bay lies on {{the western}} edge of the town. The upper part is sandy, but the sea retreats a long way <b>at</b> <b>low</b> <b>tide,</b> exposing large areas of mud flats (hence the colloquial name of Weston-super-Mud). The tidal range in this part of the Bristol Channel is great, and since beach and mud flats are on a gentle slope, it is inadvisable to try to reach the sea <b>at</b> <b>low</b> <b>tide,</b> as the sand gives way to deep mud which has often {{resulted}} in loss of life over the years. Driving on the beach is permitted in certain areas, but occasionally the drivers are caught unawares as they drive too close to the sea and break through the sand into the underlying mud, and are then stuck.|$|E
5|$|After {{the closure}} of Dunston Staithes in 1980, the Swing Bridge {{downstream}} of the stations seldom had to be opened. (Because Bessie Surtees was low lying, {{it was able to}} pass underneath the bridge <b>at</b> <b>low</b> <b>tide.)</b> However, on 15 December 1975, Bessie Surtees collided with the Swing Bridge, forcing it to close for the rest of that weekend.|$|E
50|$|Additionally, Lands End {{contains}} {{the ruins of}} the Sutro Baths. Other historic sites include numerous shipwrecks, which are visible <b>at</b> <b>low</b> <b>tides</b> from the Coastal Trail and Mile Rock.|$|R
50|$|The village overlooks two {{sandy beaches}} {{and is one}} of Ceredigion's holiday destinations. Rock pools are exposed <b>at</b> <b>low</b> <b>tides</b> and the cliff top walks along the Ceredigion Coast offer views.|$|R
50|$|The inner islands {{comprise}} Mataora (Round Rock), Pararaki (Seagull Rock) and Motuotamatea (Snapper Rock). Mataora {{connects to}} the mainland <b>at</b> <b>low</b> <b>tides,</b> as does Motuotamatea on very <b>low</b> spring <b>tides.</b> Pararaki is separated from Mataora by a 20 meter wide channel.|$|R
5|$|By the 17th century, {{coastal erosion}} had {{undermined}} the castle's walls. In 1627, Charles I {{announced that he}} would repair the fortification but instead the ruins were dismantled in 1631 by Sir John Oglander. A new fortification, Sandown Fort was built in its place, positioned further inland, but the possible remains of the foundations of the original castle are still visible along the shore <b>at</b> <b>low</b> <b>tide.</b>|$|E
5|$|On {{the east}} coast are Goat Cave and Clamshell Cave. The latter is 10m high, about 6m wide at the entrance, and some 45m long, and {{on one side of}} it the ridges of basalt stand out like the ribs of a ship. Near this cave is the {{pyramidal}} rock islet of Am Buachaille ('The Herdsman'), a pile of basalt columns seen fully only <b>at</b> <b>low</b> <b>tide.</b> Other outlying rocks include Eilean Dubh to the north-west and a series of skerries stretching for half a kilometre to the south-west. On the southwest shore are Boat Cave and Mackinnon's Cave (named after a 15th-century abbot of Iona), which has a tunnel connecting it to Cormorant Cave. These caves lie to the south-west and can be accessed from the bay of Port an Fhasgaidh <b>at</b> <b>low</b> <b>tide.</b> In 1945 a mine exploded near Boat Cave, causing damage to the cliff face which is still visible. Mackinnon's Cave is 107 metres long.|$|E
5|$|The {{beach is}} popular with summer tourists, {{and has a}} {{campsite}} on the nearby fields. The beach has a snack bar and restaurant and associated amenities to cater for the increased public demand in recent years. There is an expansive rocky beach <b>at</b> <b>low</b> <b>tide,</b> with a stretch of sand towards the far west, and views of the Bristol Channel and the coastline of Somerset, with the landmark white roof of Butlins, Minehead.|$|E
50|$|Pulau Sekudu (Chinese: 青蛙岛), or Frog Island, is an islet {{located just}} off Chek Jawa on Pulau Ubin, Singapore. It {{lies in the}} Serangoon Harbour {{opposite}} Changi. Despite its proximity, it is only reachable by boat, even <b>at</b> <b>low</b> <b>tides.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The name of {{the village}} refers to the stone reef visible <b>at</b> <b>low</b> <b>tides</b> <b>at</b> the black sand beach (vato meaning [...] "stone"). In the local {{language}} Daakie, the village is called Langievot, meaning [...] "at {{the end of the}} stones".|$|R
50|$|Elizabeth Reef, atoll about 8.2 by 5.5 km, area 51 km2 {{including}} lagoon, one islet: Elizabeth island (Elizabeth cay), no vegetation, 600 m by 400 m (area 0.2 km2), {{highest point}} 0.8 m. <b>At</b> <b>low</b> <b>tides</b> {{much of the}} reef flat is exposed.|$|R
5|$|The {{three main}} {{islands of the}} Monach Islands (Heisgeir), Ceann Iar, Ceann Ear and Shivinish are {{connected}} at low tides. It is said {{that at one time}} it was also possible to walk all the way to Baleshare, and on to North Uist, five miles away <b>at</b> <b>low</b> <b>tide.</b> In the 16th century, a large tidal wave was said to have washed the route away.|$|E
5|$|A new wooden {{northern}} jetty {{was added}} in 1872 which allowed {{the removal of}} the original western landing place. Another jetty was built on the south west corner in 1898 which reached deep water even <b>at</b> <b>low</b> <b>tide,</b> thus allowing steamers to use the pier at all states of the tide. This was damaged in a gale in 1903, and although it was rebuilt in 1909, it closed in 1916 and was dismantled in 1923. The northern jetty had also been damaged in the 1903 storm but was replaced by the present steel structure in 1905.|$|E
5|$|A salvage {{attempt was}} ordered by Secretary of State William Paget only {{days after the}} sinking, and Charles Brandon, the king's brother-in-law, took charge of {{practical}} details. The operation followed the standard procedure for raising ships in shallow waters: strong cables were attached to the sunken ship and fastened to two empty ships, or hulks. <b>At</b> <b>low</b> <b>tide,</b> the ropes were pulled taut with capstans. When the high tide came in, the hulks rose and with them the wreck. It would then be towed into shallower water and the procedure repeated until the whole ship could be raised completely.|$|E
50|$|Middleton Reef, atoll about 8.9 by 6.3 km, area 37 km2 {{including}} lagoon, one islet: The Sound, 100 by 70 m (area 5,000 m2), {{highest point}} {{close to the}} Northern end 1.5 m. <b>At</b> <b>low</b> <b>tides</b> much of the reef flat is exposed.|$|R
50|$|Other attractions are the mussels, {{which can}} be {{gathered}} from offshore rocks <b>at</b> <b>low</b> <b>tides,</b> surf fishing, and beach fires. An occasional surfer may be seen, as well as paragliders who, now that there is safe access, sometimes land on the beach.|$|R
5000|$|A {{large wooden}} {{platform}} known as 'McKenzie's Landing' was constructed and at high tide, boats would unload goods {{onto the platform}} and <b>at</b> <b>low</b> <b>tides</b> horse and cart {{would be used to}} collect the items. The same would be done to load boats.|$|R
5|$|<b>At</b> <b>low</b> <b>tide</b> {{extensive}} {{areas of}} mudflats (the Steart and the Berrow Flats) are exposed, providing important feeding and over-wintering grounds for waders (shorebirds). Invertebrate fauna including six nationally rare species and eighteen nationally scarce species {{can be found}} in the ditches and ponds around the shores. Consequently, Bridgwater Bay is a National Nature Reserve, and is managed by Natural England. Some of the potential risks to wildlife are highlighted in the local Oil Spill Contingency Plan.|$|E
5|$|Because the self-anchored {{structure}} {{relies on}} the roadway itself to absorb stresses, the suspension cables could not be installed until the roadway was built; however, until the cables were in place the roadway could not be supported. To resolve this problem, Topham had the roadway built in sections, supported on very tall barges. The barges were floated into place <b>at</b> <b>low</b> <b>tide,</b> and the rising tide was used to lift the sections above {{the height of the}} piers. As the tide ebbed, the roadway dropped into place.|$|E
5|$|Determined to {{make one}} last show of defiance, Maxwell ordered the marines to wade towards the proas <b>at</b> <b>low</b> <b>tide</b> and open fire on them. This {{achieved}} no hits, but did persuade the Dayaks to move further offshore, and they departed entirely when the Ternate was spotted. The following day the survivors embarked on board Ternate, Maxwell having lost not one man on either the shipwreck or the island. At Batavia the crew were reunited with Amherst and his party, who had sent Ternate to search for them and subsequently chartered the East Indiaman Caesar {{for the remainder of}} the journey to Britain.|$|E
50|$|There {{is also an}} {{area just}} to the East of the Marina that is known as Black Rock. Here <b>at</b> <b>low</b> <b>tides</b> a vast area of Black rocks {{can be seen that}} are {{excellent}} for nature observations for the likes of ecologists.|$|R
50|$|Gantheaume Point {{is located}} at the extreme {{southern}} end of the beach. The Gantheaume Point lighthouse is a good place for observing dolphins and migrating whales during their migration seasons. Dinosaur footprints estimated at 130-million-years-old are visible in the rocks <b>at</b> <b>low</b> <b>tides.</b>|$|R
50|$|Elizabeth Reef at 8.2 by 5.5 km is {{slightly}} smaller than Middleton. Its cay, Elizabeth Island, measures about 400 m {{in length and}} is up to 400 m in width. <b>At</b> <b>low</b> <b>tides</b> much of the reef flat is exposed by the receding waters.|$|R
5|$|Fish are {{plentiful}} {{in the waters}} surrounding the island, where one may encounter trevallies (Carangidae), Giant African threadfins (Polydactylus quadrifilis), great barracudas (Sphyraena barracuda), or African red snappers (Lutjanus agennes). The mangroves are home to many crustaceans such as southern pink shrimp (Farfantepenaeus notialis), sand fiddler crabs (Uca pugilator), and molluscs. The shellfish population consists mostly of mangrove oysters (Crassostrea gasar), which cling to uncovered mangrove roots <b>at</b> <b>low</b> <b>tide.</b> The red-headed agama and monitor lizard make up the reptilian population of the island.|$|E
5|$|She {{remained}} in service until 14 June 1936, {{when she was}} placed in reserve. Her name was reused for the new battleship Strasbourg, so the old cruiser was renamed Strassbourg II. The cruiser was subsequently used as a barracks ship in Lorient until 1944, when she was seized by the Germans and scuttled in the harbor to protect the U-boat pens in the harbor from torpedo attack. Barrage balloons and anti-torpedo nets were attached to the ship to strengthen the defenses of the U-boat pens. Her wreck remains in the harbor, and is visible <b>at</b> <b>low</b> <b>tide.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Severn Estuary {{has one of}} {{the highest}} tidal ranges in the world, up to , second only to the Bay of Fundy in Eastern Canada. The estuary's funnel shape, its tidal range, and the {{underlying}} geology of rock, gravel and sand, produce strong tidal streams and high turbidity, giving the water a notably brown colouration. The tidal range means that the legs of the pier are largely exposed <b>at</b> <b>low</b> <b>tide</b> and hidden at high tide and the landing stage at the end of the pier has several levels to allow boats to dock at all stages of the tide.|$|E
50|$|Gores Island is {{an island}} in Strangford Lough, County Down, Northern Ireland. It is {{connected}} to the main land by a narrow roadway (causeway) that is passable only <b>at</b> <b>low</b> <b>tides.</b> It had a few residents in the early 19th century but is now uninhabited.|$|R
5000|$|The Cheynies are a {{group of}} reefs and small islands, between Oxna and Hildasay in the Shetland Islands. They have been {{considerably}} eroded in the historic past, {{and some of the}} islands are still connected <b>at</b> <b>low</b> <b>tides.</b> They are about twenty hectares in area.http://shetlopedia.com/Cheynies ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{remains of}} two XT-class craft are {{present on the}} beach at Aberlady Bay in East Lothian, Scotland. They were towed there in 1946 and moored to a large {{concrete}} block <b>at</b> the <b>low</b> <b>tide</b> level and were used as targets for aircraft. Much of the structure remains, semisubmerged in the sand, and can be reached <b>at</b> <b>low</b> spring <b>tides.</b>|$|R
