25|$|Anthropologists {{claim that}} many of the Dongba rituals show strong {{influences}} from the Bön religion, and are not native in origin. Bön lamas are believed to have settled among the Nashi as farmers, and to have begun to practise exorcisms as a way of earning <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>money</b> on the side; they were thus in competition with the native ritual specialists, locally known as Llü-bu, or Ssan-nyi. This is disputed, largely because the Bon religion is so adulterated by Tibetan Buddhism today {{that it is difficult to}} find pure and authentic practitioners to use as a basis for comparison.|$|E
25|$|In prison, Bunyan had {{a copy of}} the Bible and of John Foxe's Book of Martyrs, as well as writing materials. He {{also had}} at times the company of other preachers who had been imprisoned. It was in Bedford Gaol that he wrote Grace Abounding and started work on The Pilgrim's Progress, as well as penning several tracts that may have brought him <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>money.</b> In 1671, while still in prison, he was chosen as pastor of the Bedford Meeting. By that time there was a mood of {{increasing}} religious toleration in the country and in March 1672 the king issued a declaration of indulgence which suspended penal laws against nonconformists. Thousands of nonconformists were released from prison, amongst them Bunyan and five of his fellow inmates of Bedford Gaol. Bunyan was freed in May 1672 and immediately obtained a licence to preach under the declaration of indulgence.|$|E

2500|$|Brown was {{introduced}} to Harold Prince through his association with Daisy Prince, and was hired to write songs for the Broadway musical Parade, based on the trial and lynching of Leo Frank.

2500|$|The {{prosecutor}} provided embarrassing {{details of}} the crime to the jury.

Williamson said he wanted to leave the marshal but was not allowed to, being forced to leave his hat with him and receiving <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>money</b> in return. According to Williamson's testimony he was persuaded to follow the marshal into the room, where he [...] "did all that a beastly appetite could prompt him to". Williamson reported going to his relative, Joseph Cockrost, who took him back to the tavern and asked to be informed as soon as the prisoner appeared, which happened the following Saturday. In his testimony Cockrost mentioned knocking at the door after seeing [...] "filthy actions" [...] through the keyhole. When opening the door he took the marshal by the collar and threatened him, saying, [...] "I'll whip you through the Gills" [...] when he laid his hand on the sword. Testimonies were given by a servant of the tavern proving to have seen the same scene with the prosecutor, a constable, John Carter, watchmen and some character witnesses. Interestingly, the constable opposed the watchmen, who were probably trying to accuse Williamson of inventing the story. At last, the prisoner was acquitted of actual sodomy and found guilty on the second charge, assault.
