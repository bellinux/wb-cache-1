50|$|There {{was a major}} revamp of the ZX-6R in 1998 {{with the}} Launch of the G series. The G series saw no {{increase}} in displacement but power went from 100 BHP to 108 BHP thanks to the newly designed airbox. Fairing was revamped, but retained a similar design {{as far as the}} headlight, <b>air</b> <b>intakes</b> and <b>screen</b> were concerned. In 2000, the first J series replaced the G, increasing power to 112 BHP by increasing the compression ratio from 11.8:1 to 12.8:1. The J series sported a couple of modernisations including a 180 section rear tyre, second headlight, uprated generator and stick coils (coil on plug) replacing the traditional coil with HT lead.|$|R
40|$|AbstractA {{distress}} {{was observed}} in a distortion screen during testing. This screen is positioned {{in front of an}} aero engine during testing to check the engine performance with a distorted <b>air</b> <b>intake.</b> To ensure a distorted <b>air</b> <b>intake,</b> the <b>screen</b> contains dense meshes in some areas whereas in other areas they are less dense. Non-uniformity in the mesh density results in distorted air flow into the engine thereby facilitating evaluation of the engine performance with disturbed aerodynamic inlet. The component, i. e. the distortion screen was under development and was subjected to aerodynamic tests on the test bench. It was found to have fractured from a rib connecting two meshes. Loose end of the mesh had detached and resulted in permanent deformation of the adjoining ribs and meshes. The fractured surface exhibited glossy crystalline appearance. Scanning electron microscope revealed striations at higher magnifications (> 500 X) as {{was observed in}} the case of fatigue failure. Two crack fronts were adjacent and near to one corner of the rib, and the third crack front had originated from the other corner placed diagonally opposite to the other two crack fronts. This observation indicated failure of the screen under reverse bending fatigue condition. Design and material condition were reviewed. After modification {{it was found that the}} newly modified distortion screen did not show any sign of deformation after testing...|$|R

40|$|We {{compared}} the size selectivity of the <b>intake</b> <b>screens</b> at the P. H. Robinson generating station on Galveston Bay, Texas {{with that of}} a 3 -m otter trawl hauled in the intake waters and evaluated a means of predicting size selectivity of the <b>intake</b> <b>screens.</b> We did this for brown shrimp (Penaeus aztecus), white shrimp (Penaeus setiferus), gulf menhaden (Brevoortia patronus), bay anchovy (Anchoa mitchilli), sand seatrout (Cynoscion arenarius), and Atlantic croaker (Micropogonias undulatus). The trawl generally caught smaller individuals than the <b>intake</b> <b>screens,</b> with the relative frequency of catch by size gradually increasing to a peak at an indeterminate length of a species, then decreasing as its length increased. Conversely, the relative frequency of collection at the <b>intake</b> <b>screens</b> increased abruptly at a predictable threshold length. Above this threshold, catches decreased gradually, presumably because larger individuals were both less abundant and less susceptible to capture than smaller ones. Based on our results, we concluded that <b>intake</b> <b>screens</b> are a practical means of sampling fish populations and provide data that are as useful as trawl data for most fishery analysis...|$|R

50|$|Most {{vehicles}} manufactured {{from the}} mid-1970s until the mid-1990s have thermostatic <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> systems that regulate {{the temperature of}} the air entering the engine's intake tract, providing warm air when the engine is cold and cold air when the engine is warm to maximize performance, efficiency, and fuel economy. With the advent of advanced emission controls and more advanced fuel injection methods modern vehicles do not have a thermostatic <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> system and the factory installed <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> draws unregulated cold air. Aftermarket cold <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> systems are marketed with claims of increased engine efficiency and performance. The putative principle behind a cold <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> is that cooler air has a higher density, thus containing more oxygen per volume unit than warmer air.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The flow {{characteristics}} of an aerator inserted on the chute with a concave surface {{is more complex}} than that of on the straight chute. The area of the <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> of the aerator is a very important factor which influences the cavity size of jet flow after the aerator, the air pressure in the cavity and air concentrations in high-speed flows along the chute. The present project focused on the <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> of an aerator inserted on a model chute with a concave surface. How the area of the <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> of the aerator and the radius of chute arc affect {{flow characteristics}} are investigated. The air pressure in the cavity was indirectly derived from the jet trajectory equation. It is demonstrated that the cavity length increases with, and the air pressure in it decreases with the increasing of the <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> area at first, and then it remains unchangeable for a discharge even though the <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> area continues to increase...|$|R

Ageing treatments and tensile testing was conducted on samples of the new material, as well as on the currently used PA 66 to evaluate mechanical response of each material to treatments made to simulate the <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> environment. Furthermore, understanding of the chemical setup is lacking and needs to be studied. Experiments was performed to study the chemistry of the intake environment.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the current research was to analyze the flow through the <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> system of 1. 6 L Proton Waja engine by adding guide vane. The pressure drop across the <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> system {{is known to have}} a significant influence on the indicated power of the SI engine. The pressure drop along the intake system is proportional to the engine speed and cross sectional area. The guide vane is placed in the system to reduce the pressure drop across the system. It was found that the guide vane help to reduce pressure drop across the <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> system where it increases the capabilities of air induction system to suck more air to the engine. The geometry of <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> system of Proton Waja 1. 6 L engine was used in the modeling approach. The study was focused on different engine speed. This analysis was done in CFD using a model setup with appropriate speed of the Proton Waja 1. 6 L engine from maximum speed to minimum speed. The CFD results of <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> system with the guide vane are validated against the CFD result of real <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> system of Proton Waja 1. 6 L which do not have guide vane...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis study {{discusses}} on {{the fuel}} economy and exhaust emissions at variations of <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> pressure. The <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> pressure {{is influenced by}} the degree of opening throttle plate and venturi effect which draw the fuel to the combustion chamber in carbureted engine. The experimental work is conducted at variations of engine speed and load using a single cylinder four stroke SI engine attached with 5 kW dynamometer. Gas analyzer was used to measure exhaust emissions compositions and to identify the quality of combustion. The results show that the standard <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> system resulted in rich combustion which led to the incomplete combustion due to less availability of air. By eliminating the air filter, the air flow restriction through the <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> system was reduced. Hence, better combustion and less unburned components are achieved because of higher air availability. A higher <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> pressure is required to increase air density in allowing for better combustion within a limited time to improve fuel economy, power output and exhaust emissions. Complete combustion also lead to the reduction of unburned components such as carbon (C), hydrogen (H 2), carbon monoxide (CO) and hydroxide (OH) that resulted in less hazardous emissions...|$|R
