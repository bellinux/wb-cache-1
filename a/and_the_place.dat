5|$|The church {{features}} two stories: {{while the}} upper story {{was certainly the}} church proper <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>place</b> of liturgy, {{the role of the}} lower story is unclear. Its construction may have been necessitated due to the unfavourable rocky terrain, or it may have served as a tomb or a storage facility. The latter is considered more likely because no human remains have been discovered inside, even though the lower stories of similar churches were commonly used as tombs.|$|E

5|$|According to legend, Shiva's wife Sati immolated {{herself in}} the yajna-fire of her father Daksha, as a protest against Shiva's dishonor. The God became furious and started to dance the Tāndava with Sati's body on his shoulders. Knowing that the dance of {{destruction}} was about to annihilate the world, Vishnu cut the body of Sati to pieces with Sudarshana Chakram, his celestial weapon, thereby appeasing Shiva. Each of 51 pieces of the body fell to earth, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>place</b> where each piece fell became a holy center of pilgrimage or Shakti Peetha. The legend goes that Sati's right arm fell near a now-extinct hot spring at the Chandranth peak in Sitakunda. The site is marked by the temple of Sambhunath just below the Chandranath temple {{on top of the}} peak, and it is a major tirtha for Hindus in Bangladesh.|$|E
5|$|Although no {{explanation}} {{is provided in}} the biographies of the Ridwan family, it is evident they chose Gaza as their home <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>place</b> for their castle. Ridwan Pasha's son Ahmad Pasha succeeded him and governed Gaza for thirty years, sometimes incorporating the sanjaks of Nablus and Jerusalem. He became Governor of Damascus Eyalet in 1601 after bribing several viziers and bureaucrats in Istanbul and died in 1607. Next in line was Hasan Pasha ibn Ahmad who became known 'Arab Hasan ("Hasan the Bedouin") because by then, the Ridwans were identified with the control {{and knowledge of the}} Bedouin. He successfully led his pro-Ottoman Bedouin troops against the army of the rebel Fakhr ad-Din in a series of battles. He was later appointed Governor of Tripoli in Lebanon, but he was deposed in 1644. 'Arab Hasan had many wives and concubines and 85 children. He led the Ridwans successfully militarily, however, he burdened the dynasty with heavy debt.|$|E

They travel to Godric's Hollow, Harry's birthplace <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>place</b> where his parents died, and meet the elderly magical historian Bathilda Bagshot, but she {{turns out to be}} Nagini in disguise, awaiting their arrival. The snake attacks Harry and again they barely escape, but Harry's wand is destroyed. Their luck finally appears to turn in the Forest of Dean. A mysterious silver doe Patronus appears and guides Harry to an icy pond containing the Sword of Hogwarts co-founder Godric Gryffindor, one of the few objects able to destroy Horcruxes. During Harry's attempt to recover the sword, the Horcrux attempts to kill him. He is saved by Ron, who was guided back by the Deluminator, and they realise Dumbledore's gifts may be meaningful. Ron takes the sword and uses it to destroy the locket.|$|E
5|$|Some of {{the caves}} around Adams {{were subject to}} {{commercial}} ventures. In the 1860s, ice was gathered from the Ice Cave and shipped to Portland and The Dalles in years of short supply elsewhere. Oddly, a “claim” to the cave using mining laws was used {{in order to gain}} exclusive access to the ice. Cheese Cave was used for potato storage in the 1930s and later was home to the Guler Cheese Company, which produced, {{for a number of years}} in the 1950s, a bleu cheese similar to the Roquefort produced in Roquefort-sur-Soulzon, France. A legend from the Klickitats regarding the formation of the caves, involves a man and his wife who were of gigantic stature. The man left his wife and married a mouse, which became a woman. His wife was furious and because she threatened to kill the man and the “mouse-wife,” they hid farther up the mountain at a lake. The man’s wife assumed they were underground and began digging for them. In the process, she dug out the many caves in the area. Eventually, she reached the place where they were and the man allowed her to kill the “mouse-wife” to save his own life. Her blood colored the rocks of the lake red <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>place</b> was known as Hool-hool-se, which is from the Native American word for mouse. Eventually, the wife killed the man as well and lived alone in the mountains.|$|E
5|$|The {{traditional}} {{design was}} a highly symbolic variety of sacred architecture. It was a greatly elaborated variant {{on the design of}} an Egyptian house, reflecting its role as the god's home. Moreover, the temple represented a piece of the divine realm on earth. The elevated, enclosed sanctuary was equated with the sacred hill where the world was created in Egyptian myth and with the burial chamber of a tomb, where the god's ba, or spirit, came to inhabit its cult image just as a human ba came to inhabit its mummy. This crucial place, the Egyptians believed, had to be insulated from the impure outside world. Therefore, as one moved toward the sanctuary the amount of outside light decreased, and restrictions on who could enter increased. Yet the temple could also represent the world itself. The processional way could therefore stand for the path of the sun traveling across the sky, and the sanctuary for the Duat where it was believed to set and to be reborn at night. The space outside the building was thus equated with the waters of chaos that lay outside the world, while the temple represented the order of the cosmos <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>place</b> where that order was continually renewed.|$|E
