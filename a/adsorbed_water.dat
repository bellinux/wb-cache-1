25|$|With {{increasing}} attention {{being paid}} to saving energy, many methods have been proposed that avoid distillation altogether for dehydration. Of these methods, a third method has emerged and has been adopted {{by the majority of}} modern ethanol plants. This new process uses molecular sieves to remove water from fuel ethanol. In this process, ethanol vapor under pressure passes through a bed of molecular sieve beads. The bead's pores are sized to allow adsorption of water while excluding ethanol. After a period of time, the bed is regenerated under vacuum or in the flow of inert atmosphere (e.g. N2) to remove the <b>adsorbed</b> <b>water.</b> Two beds are often used so that one is available to adsorb water while the other is being regenerated. This dehydration technology can account for energy saving of 3,000 btus/gallon (840 kJ/L) compared to earlier azeotropic distillation.|$|E

After HMDS treatment the silicon surface oxide becomes silated, leaving a non-polar surface. The pristine silicon (100) face has a surface energy value of 56.9 mN/m, which is reduced to a value of 44.1 mN/m after HMDS treatment The molecular formula for hexamethyldisilazane is C6H19NSi2.|$|E

40|$|The wetting {{properties}} of graphene have proven controversial {{and difficult to}} assess. The presence of a graphene layer {{on top of a}} substrate does not significantly change the wetting {{properties of}} the solid substrate, suggesting that a single graphene layer does not affect the adhesion between the wetting phase and the substrate.
