25|$|Perhaps {{the most}} famous item found is the Nuzi map, which is the oldest known map ever discovered. It is unknown exactly what the Nuzi map charts, even though the {{majority}} of the tablet is preserved. The Nuzi map is actually one of the so-called Gasur texts, and predates the invasion of the city of Gasur by the Hurrians, who renamed it Nuzi. The cache of economic and business documents among which the map was found date to the Old Akkadian period (ca. 2360-2180 BC). Gasur was a thriving commercial center, and the texts reveal a varied business community with far reaching enterprises. It is possible that Ebla was a trading partner, and that the tablet, rather than a record of land-holdings, might indeed be <b>a</b> <b>road</b> <b>map.</b> The tablet, which is approximately 6 x 6.5cm., is inscribed only on the obverse. It shows the city of Maskan-dur-ebla in the lower left corner, as well and a canal/river and two mountain ranges.|$|E

He praised Redding's version of [...] "You Send Me", considering it [...] "the least stylized of any of his renditions of [...] Cooke's songs", but criticized Redding's restraint, compared to future recordings, and the [...] "somewhat less than memorable" [...] writing, except on [...] "Security", [...] "These Arms of Mine" [...] and [...] "That's What My Heart Needs". The reviewer concluded by saying [...] "Redding exudes astonishing power, energy and boldness".|$|E

500|$|In {{its final}} years, the Wirgman Building housed office and mercantile spaces {{on its first}} floor, and its second floor was divided into apartments. In 1937, the National Park Service Historic American Buildings Survey (HABS) photographed and {{documented}} the architectural details of the Wirgman Building. At {{the time of its}} documentation by HABS, the building was under the ownership of Mrs. W. F. Wirgman, whose family's surname likely gave the structure its local toponym. HABS referred to the Wirgman Building as the [...] "Valley Bank Building" [...] in its supplemental documentation, which was completed by Archie A. Biggs. In September 1937, the West Virginia State Road Commission released <b>a</b> <b>road</b> <b>map</b> highlighting the history of the Potomac Highlands through photographs, which included a feature on the Wirgman Building and Lieutenant John Blue's escape during its tenure as a military prison during the American Civil War.|$|E
500|$|Hail to the Thief's artwork {{was created}} by Stanley Donwood, who has created the artwork for every Radiohead release since The Bends. The cover art, titled [...] "Pacific Coast", is <b>a</b> <b>road</b> <b>map</b> of Hollywood with words and phrases taken from Los Angeles's {{roadside}} advertising, such as [...] "God", [...] "TV" [...] and [...] "oil", in place of buildings. Donwood said: [...] "Advertising {{is designed to be}} seductive and attractive and, in a lot of ways, it's very beautiful. But there's something unsettling about being continually sold something. I liked taking the elements of roadside advertising out of context because it removes the imperative and just goes to the essence of it – the pure heart of advertising." [...] Other words in the artwork were provided by Yorke, taken from political discussion surrounding the War on Terror. Among them is the phrase [...] "burn the witch", the title of song Radiohead worked on during the Hail to the Thief sessions but did not complete until their ninth album, A Moon Shaped Pool (2016).|$|E
500|$|David Browne of Entertainment Weekly {{gave the}} album a B+. Browne said, [...] "Few bands since Led Zeppelin have so crisply mixed {{instruments}} both acoustic and electric." [...] He praised several songs as being [...] "as powerful as anything the band has done." [...] Browne criticized the album's production, saying [...] "like many self-produced efforts, it shows." [...] He added, [...] "With arrangements that crest and {{fall to the}} point where <b>a</b> <b>road</b> <b>map</b> would have helped, the overlong (16-song) album is often unwieldy and could have benefited from judicious trimming." [...] Allmusic staff writer Stephen Thomas Erlewine gave the album three out of five stars, saying that [...] "it might seem like nothing more than heavy metal, but a closer listen reveals that Soundgarden haven't tempered their ambitions at all." [...] The reviewer for Melody Maker said that [...] "their roots don't matter now. All I care for now is the immediacy of their pop moments." [...] Critic Robert Christgau gave the album an honorable mention of one star, describing it as [...] "brutal depression simplified" [...] and highlighted by the songs [...] "Ty Cobb" [...] and [...] "Applebite", while Jason Josephes from Pitchfork Media called it a [...] "double shot of grunge, no foam but plenty of caffeine." ...|$|E

500|$|Many critics {{specifically}} praised Duvall's performance. Sterritt {{called it}} [...] "one {{of the most}} finely wrought achievements to reach the screen in recent memory." [...] In Corliss's description, [...] "Duvall's aging face, <b>a</b> <b>road</b> <b>map</b> of dead ends and dry gulches, can accommodate rage or innocence or any ironic shade in between. As Mac he avoids both melodrama and condescension, finding climaxes in each small step toward rehabilitation, each new responsibility shouldered." [...] Ansen said, [...] "Robert Duvall does another of his extraordinary disappearing acts. He vanishes totally inside the character of Mac Sledge." [...] Maslin said he [...] "so thoroughly transformed into Mac that he even walks with a Texan's rolling gait"; she also complimented the performances of the supporting cast. According to a review in People, [...] "Duvall gives it everything he has, which is saying a great deal. His beery singing voice is a revelation, and his unfussy, brightly burnished acting is the kind for which awards were invented." [...] The review also described Betty Buckley as [...] "bitchy and brilliant". Duvall was praised as well for pulling off his first true romantic role; the actor said of the response, [...] "This is the only film where I've heard people say I'm sexy. It's real romantic. Rural romantic. I love that part almost more than anything." ...|$|E
