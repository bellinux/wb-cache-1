In the prequel, the Doctor {{is sitting at}} the swings of a children's playground when he meets a little girl. They talk about losing things, and the Doctor states that he has lost someone twice and he hopes {{he might be able}} to find her again. The girl tells him that, when she loses something, she goes to <b>a</b> <b>quiet</b> <b>place</b> for a think, and then can remember where she put it. As the girl leaves, it is revealed that she is Clara Oswald.|$|E
5|$|Baker {{separated}} from her second husband, Jack Garfein, in 1967, and moved to Europe with her two children {{to pursue a career}} there after struggling to find work in Hollywood. Eventually settling in Rome, Italy, Baker became fluent in Italian and spent the next several years starring in hard-edged Italian thrillers, exploitation, and horror films. In 1966, Baker had been invited to the Venice International Film Festival, where she met director Marco Ferreri, who asked her to play the lead role in Her Harem (1967). This was followed with the horror films The Sweet Body of Deborah (1968) and The Devil Has Seven Faces (1971). Baker also starred in So Sweet... So Perverse (1969), Paranoia (1969), <b>A</b> <b>Quiet</b> <b>Place</b> to Kill (1970), and Il coltello di ghiaccio (Knife of Ice) (1972), all horror films directed by Italian filmmaker Umberto Lenzi.|$|E
5|$|To {{allow the}} lord to {{concentrate}} on his duties regarding administration, he had a household of servants {{to take care of}} chores such as providing food. The household was run by a chamberlain, while a treasurer took care of the estate's written records. Royal households took essentially the same form as baronial households, although on a much larger scale and the positions were more prestigious. An important role of the household servants was the preparation of food; the castle kitchens would have been a busy place when the castle was occupied, called on to provide large meals. Without the presence of a lord's household, usually because he was staying elsewhere, a castle would have been <b>a</b> <b>quiet</b> <b>place</b> with few residents, focused on maintaining the castle.|$|E

25|$|Twain {{moved his}} family to Hartford, Connecticut, where he {{arranged}} {{the building of a}} home starting in 1873. In the 1870s and 1880s, the family summered at Quarry Farm in Elmira, the home of Olivia's sister, Susan Crane. In 1874, Susan had a study built apart from the main house so that Twain would have <b>a</b> <b>quiet</b> <b>place</b> in which to write. Also, he smoked cigars constantly, and Susan did not want him to do so in her house.|$|E

25|$|Ennio Morricone's eclecticism and {{knack for}} {{creating}} highly poignant, melodic and emotional music found great scope also in horror movies, {{such as the}} baroque thrillers of Dario Argento, from The Bird with the Crystal Plumage (1969), The Cat o' Nine Tails (1970) and Four Flies on Grey Velvet (1971) to The Stendhal Syndrome (1996) and The Phantom of the Opera (1998). His other horror scores include Nightmare Castle (1965), <b>A</b> <b>Quiet</b> <b>Place</b> in the Country (1968), The Antichrist (1974), Autopsy (1975) and Night Train Murders (1975).|$|E
25|$|Held in {{high regard}} in avant-garde music circles, they are {{considered}} to be the first experimental composers collective, their only peers being the British improvisation collective AMM. Their influence can be heard in free improvising ensembles from the European movements including Evan Parker Electro-Acoustic Ensemble, the Swiss electronic free improvisation group Voice Crack, John Zorn and in the techniques of modern classical music and avant-garde jazz groups. The ensemble's groundbreaking work informed their work in composition. The ensemble did also perform in varying capacities with Morricone adding noise to some of his '60s and '70s Italian soundtracks, including <b>A</b> <b>Quiet</b> <b>Place</b> in the Country (1969) and Cold Eyes of Fear (1971).|$|E
25|$|St Paul's {{charges for}} the {{admission}} {{of those people who}} are sightseers, rather than worshippers; the charge is £18 (£16 when purchased online). Outside service times, people seeking <b>a</b> <b>quiet</b> <b>place</b> to pray or worship are admitted to St Dunstan's Chapel free of charge. On Sundays people are admitted only for services and concerts and there is no sightseeing. The charge to sightseers is made because St Paul's receives little regular or significant funding from the Crown, the Church of England or the state and relies on the income generated by tourism to allow the building to continue to function as a centre for Christian worship, as well as to cover general maintenance and repair work.|$|E

For example, young women are {{encouraged}} to throw their handkerchiefs to the crowd, and the young man who catches and returns the handkerchief has a chance at romance. In Daguang, in northeast Guizhou Province, young {{men and women of the}} Dong people would make an appointment at a certain place. The young women would arrive early to overhear remarks made about them by the young men. The young men would praise their lovers in front of their fellows, in which finally the listening women would walk out of the thicket. Pairs of lovers would go off to <b>a</b> <b>quiet</b> <b>place</b> to open their hearts to each other.|$|E
25|$|The rate {{at which}} {{sediment}} is deposited differs depending on the location. A channel in a tidal flat can see the deposition of a few metres of sediment in one day, while on the deep ocean floor each year only a few millimetres of sediment accumulate. A distinction can be made between normal sedimentation and sedimentation caused by catastrophic processes. The latter category includes all kinds of sudden exceptional processes like mass movements, rock slides or flooding. Catastrophic processes can see the sudden deposition of {{a large amount of}} sediment at once. In some sedimentary environments, most of the total column of sedimentary rock was formed by catastrophic processes, even though the environment is usually <b>a</b> <b>quiet</b> <b>place.</b> Other sedimentary environments are dominated by normal, ongoing sedimentation.|$|E
25|$|In 1964 Bernstein {{conducted}} Franco Zeffirelli's {{production of}} Verdi's Falstaff at the Metropolitan Opera in New York. In 1966 {{he made his}} debut at the Vienna State Opera conducting Luchino Visconti's production of the same opera with Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau as Falstaff. During his time in Vienna he also recorded the opera for Columbia Records and conducted his first subscription concert with the Vienna Philharmonic (which {{is made up of}} players from the Vienna State Opera) featuring Mahler's Das Lied von der Erde with Fischer-Dieskau and James King. He returned to the State Opera in 1968 for a production of Der Rosenkavalier and in 1970 for Otto Schenk's production of Beethoven's Fidelio. Sixteen years later, at the State Opera, Bernstein conducted his sequel to Trouble in Tahiti, <b>A</b> <b>Quiet</b> <b>Place.</b> with the ORF orchestra. Bernstein's final farewell to the State Opera happened accidentally in 1989: following a performance of Modest Mussorgsky's Khovanshchina, he unexpectedly entered the stage and embraced conductor Claudio Abbado in front of a cheering audience.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{the fact}} that he was a popular success as a composer, Bernstein himself is {{reported}} to have been disillusioned that some of his more serious works were not rated more highly by critics, and that he himself had not been able to devote more time to composing because of his conducting and other activities. Professional criticism of Bernstein's music often involves discussing the degree to which he created something new as art versus simply skillfully borrowing and fusing together elements from others. In the late 1960s, Bernstein himself reflected that his eclecticism was in part due to his lack of lengthy periods devoted to composition, and that he was still seeking to enrich his own personal musical language in the manner of the great composers of the past, all of whom had borrowed elements from others. Perhaps the harshest criticism he received from some critics in his lifetime though was directed at works like his Kaddish Symphony, his MASS and the opera <b>A</b> <b>Quiet</b> <b>Place,</b> where they found the underlying message of the piece or the text as either mildly embarrassing, clichéd or offensive. Despite this, all these pieces have been performed, discussed and reconsidered since his death.|$|E

The painter Johann Zoffany, a protégé of Garrick, painted a number of scenes of the actor, his wife and their friends on the lawn and in front of the temple. One of his guests, the letter-writer Mrs Delany, described the scene at one such entertainment in a letter of 1770: ...|$|E

500|$|The {{images of}} the poem operate in a {{circular}} pattern, and the poem begins and ends with the Stowey dell where Coleridge lived. The peaceful home at the beginning is a parallel to the [...] "Valley of Seclusion" [...] in Coleridge's Reflections on Having Left a Place of Retirement, which is <b>a</b> <b>quiet</b> <b>place</b> that allows for a pleasant life. The ideas about nature also found in [...] "The Eolian Harp" [...] are brought up, following Coleridge's familiar Plotinian view. The poem also includes Coleridge's views on the unity of mankind and nature and the fear that an invasion would destroy this unity. To safeguard it, the narrator protects his family and the dell, {{along with the rest}} of Britain. There is also an emphasis on simple living, and the poem's conclusion, a return to the dell, represents a return of Coleridge to his own family.|$|E
