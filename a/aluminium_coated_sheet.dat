Experiments {{are carried out}} using confocal microscopy and colorimetry. It is found that surface roughening of <b>coated</b> <b>aluminium</b> <b>sheets</b> during plastic deformation is a pronounced function of strain. Different strain regimes and loading modes can lead to different roughening mechanisms. This is indicated by changes in {{the slope of the}} roughness-strain curves. The roughening behavior of <b>coated</b> <b>aluminium</b> <b>sheets</b> can substantially differ from that of uncoated sheets of the same substrate material owing to the mechanical properties of the coatings. The coatings which differ in lightness and color values due to their layer thickness and chemical composition can in part undergo substantial changes in these values during straining.

40|$|Laser welding of {{aluminium}} alloys typically results in porosity in the fusion zones, leading to poor mechanical and corrosion performances. Mechanical and chemical cleaning of surfaces has been used previously to remove contaminants for weld joint preparations. However, these methods are slow, ineffective (e. g. due to hydrogen trapping) or lead to environmental hazards. This paper reports the effects of short pulsed laser surface cleaning on porosity formation and reduction in laser welding of AC- 170 PX (AA 6014) <b>aluminium</b> <b>sheets</b> (<b>coated</b> with Ti/Zr and lubricated using a dry lubricant AlO 70) with two types of joints: fillet edge and flange couch, using an AA 4043 filler wire for automotive component assembly. The effect of laser cleaning on porosity reduction during laser welding using a filler wire has not been reported before. In this work, porosity and weld fusion zone geometry were examined prior to and after laser cleaning. The nanosecond pulsed Nd:YAG laser cleaning was found to reduce porosity significantly in the weld fusion zones. For the fillet edge welds, porosity was reduced to less than 0. 5 % compared with 10 – 80 % without laser cleaning. For flange couch welds, porosity was reduced to 0. 23 – 0. 8 % with laser cleaning from 0. 7 % to 4. 3 % without laser cleaning. This {{has been found to}} be due to the elimination of contaminations and oxide layers that contribute to the porosity formation. The laser cleaning is based on thermal ablation...|$|R

40|$|In the {{manufacturing}} of metal components both wear and corrosion {{have to be}} considered. In particular, corrosion is a primary problem in the aeronautic field, where the aluminium alloys are affected by several corrosion typologies. Furthermore, nowadays carbon fibre reinforced plastics (CFRP) are finding an increasing use, but they can induce galvanic corrosion phenomena when coupled with aluminium alloys. To overcome this problem, corrosion resistant coatings are used on aluminium components. On these premises, the realization of a titanium <b>coating</b> on <b>aluminium</b> components could allow the coupling of CFRP and aluminium alloys, improving the corrosion resistance. Cold Spray Deposition is a recent technology to realize these coatings. This technology allows the production of near fully dense coatings on metallic surfaces. In many applications the <b>coated</b> <b>aluminium</b> <b>sheets</b> have to be machined (cut or drilled). Machining with conventional cutting methods leads to both tool wear and damages in the coating. Laser cutting represents a promising alternative: it does not involve any mechanical cutting force or tool wear and, thanks to the small laser beam spot, it allows to realize complex shapes. In this paper, laser cutting of an Al alloy sheet (0. 6 mm thick) coated with Ti Alloy, was studied. The adopted laser source was a 150 W, lamp pumped Nd:YAG, specifically developed for micro-machining operations on metals. During the tests, the process parameters (cutting speed, pulse duration and entrance side) were changed and the kerf geometry was analysed {{as a function of}} the process parameters...|$|R

The chloroform fractions were pooled, chloroform was removed under vacuum and the residue was re-dissolved in an appropriate volume of chloroform. These solutions were filtered through 0.2  μm membrane filters and their absorbance was measured spectroscopically (Spectrascan UV 2600, Chemito, Mumbai, India) and bikaverin was quantified from the peak absorption log €: 3.95, at 518  nm as described by Giordano et al. (1999). The chloroform extract was then reduced in volume and an equal volume of diethyl ether was added, to get a red precipitate. The precipitate was taken in appropriate volume of chloroform and used for thin layer chromatography (TLC) using <b>aluminium</b> <b>sheets</b> <b>coated</b> with silica gel 60 (Merck Life Science, Mumbai, India) and a mobile phase composed of chloroform:methanol:formic acid (85 : 15 : 1, v/v) as described by Bell et al.

Organic coating could fail prematurely and result in corrosion progression from coating failure. This paper will discuss the overall framework of experiments to justify the performance of thermal arc spray <b>aluminium</b> <b>coating.</b> In this research 99. 5 % aluminium was used as the coating material in wire form of 2. 3 mm diameter using wire arc spray method. Six samples were prepared with different thickness of coating from 200 to 400 microns. Mechanical tests such as Pull-off Test and Bend Test were performed to evaluate the coating performance. The tests indicated that all samples had passed the minimum requirement with an average of 10 MPa for Pull off Test and no crack appeared in Bend Test. Hardness Test and Surface Morphology Analysis were also performed with coating thickness ranged between 350 - 400 microns to inspect and evaluate the coating properties. The hardness test showed an average value of 209. 7 HV. Surface morphology analysis using FE-SEM indicated low porosity structures and high content of oxide.

The steel is usually coated {{as a necessary}} preparation for further processing.

40|$|Polymer <b>coated</b> <b>sheet</b> metal {{components}} find diverse applications in many industries. The manufacturing {{of the components}} generally involves forming of sheet metal into the desired shape and coating of the formed part with organic coating. An alternative manufacturing route is to <b>coat</b> the <b>sheet</b> metal first before forming. The change in the manufacturing sequence can potentially improve cost and reduce environmental impact. This approach, however, requires the coating to survive the deformation process. Thus, the effect of plastic deformation on coating adhesion is of primary interest to many engineers and researchers. This research aims at developing a methodology to predict the adhesion of coating after metal forming processes. A pull-off apparatus that measures the coating pull-off stress was used to indicate the coating adhesion strength. Several types of specimen were designed to obtain uniaxial tension, biaxial tension, and tension-compression deformation modes on pre-coated sheet by using a uniaxial tensile tester. Experimental results from two selected polymer <b>coated</b> <b>sheet</b> metals show that coating adhesion was affected by plastic deformation. An analytical model based on a virtual interface crack concept was developed to indicate the adhesion potential of the coating-substrate interface. From interfacial fracture mechanics, the initial adhesion potential {{is defined as the}} energy release rate characterized by the virtual interface crack and the initial pull-off stress. The analytical model was used to predict coating adhesion loss after deformation in uniaxial tension mode. The analytical model predictions agreed well with experimental results. Finite element analysis tool was applied to simulate more complex deformation modes in stamping of <b>coated</b> <b>sheet</b> meals. The stress field near the interface crack tip was used to calculate the energy release rate and predict the adhesion loss under different deformation modes.
