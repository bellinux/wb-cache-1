5|$|Many mutagens {{fit into}} the space between two {{adjacent}} base pairs, this is called intercalation. Most intercalators are aromatic and planar molecules; examples include ethidium bromide, acridines, daunomycin, and doxorubicin. For an intercalator to fit between base pairs, the bases must separate, distorting the DNA strands by unwinding of the double helix. This inhibits both transcription and DNA replication, causing toxicity and mutations. As a result, DNA intercalators may be carcinogens, {{and in the case}} of thalidomide, a teratogen. Others such as benzopyrene diol epoxide and <b>aflatoxin</b> form DNA adducts that induce errors in replication. Nevertheless, due to their ability to inhibit DNA transcription and replication, other similar toxins are also used in chemotherapy to inhibit rapidly growing cancer cells.|$|E

40|$|<b>Aflatoxins</b> {{are very}} potent mycotoxins produce by molds. Molds are very common pre-harvest and post harvest {{contaminant}} of cereals/cereal products. Despite improved handling, processing and storage of cereals, <b>aflatoxins</b> still remain {{a major problem}} in the cereal processing industry causing both health hazards and economic losses. Therefore, some researchers have suggested that {{in order to avoid the}} toxicity, the levels of <b>aflatoxins</b> and similar toxic compounds in foodstuffs have to be monitored closely, and be kept under control continuously. Otherwise, related health effects like acute and chronic intoxications, and even deaths, will still be an issue. Therefore, in this research the microbial and total <b>aflatoxins</b> analysis of selected cereal flours processed and sold in Abakaliki metropolis was carried out. A total of four cereal samples (maize, millet, sorghum and wheat) were studied. The total <b>aflatoxins</b> were analyzed using highly sensitive competitive Enzyme Link Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) reader. The cereal samples were also analyzed for total fungal count using digital colony counting machine (CCM China). The result showed that all the cereal flours (wheat, sorghum, millet and maize) analyzed were heavily contaminated with fungal cells. The flours also contain unacceptable levels of <b>aflatoxins.</b> The total <b>aflatoxins</b> were above the minimum acceptable limits (10 ppm) according to National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC).

40|$|<b>Aflatoxins</b> family {{includes}} {{a great number}} of lipophilic molecules produced by aerobic microscopic fungi belonging to the genus Aspergillus.

Focus is given to the different foodstuffs that may be at risk of contamination by Aspergillus and the subsequent accumulation of <b>aflatoxins</b> in the food chain. Bioavailability and bioaccessibility of <b>aflatoxins</b> will be discussed considering that these unwanted molecules can be assumed by the humans with the diet. Bioaccessibility, that deals with the fraction of micro-nutrients released from the food matrix during digestion and gastro-intestinal available for absorption, will be discussed with reference to <b>aflatoxins</b> bioaccessibility of during the digestion process, considering the relationships between the food matrix and its influences on <b>aflatoxins</b> fate. Bioavailability of the <b>aflatoxins</b> assumed from the diet depends on their stability during digestion, since they are released from the food matrix (bioaccessibility) and on the efficiency of their passage through the gastro-intestinal mucosa. The term bioavailability includes the concepts of availability to the absorption, metabolism, distribution of nutrients to tissues and bioactivity and indicates the fraction of micro-nutrients absorbed by the body and the speed with which these molecules are absorbed and made available at their site of action. Despite of the practical difficulties in measuring the distribution and bioactivity of <b>aflatoxins</b> on a specific human body organ, the bioavailability is the fraction of an oral dose of a compound or precursor of an active metabolite that reaches the bloodstream.
