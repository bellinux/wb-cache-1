5|$|Plants {{are readily}} {{propagated}} from seed. As seed {{is surrounded by}} irritating hairs within the pod, extraction requires care. Stem cuttings of semi-mature growth can be taken in late summer <b>and</b> <b>require</b> the application of rooting hormones and bottom heat.|$|E
5|$|After {{an episode}} of {{pituitary}} apoplexy, 80% of people develop hypopituitarism <b>and</b> <b>require</b> some form of hormone replacement therapy. The most common problem is growth hormone deficiency, which is often left untreated but may cause decreased muscle mass and strength, obesity and fatigue. 60–80% require hydrocortisone replacement (either permanently or when unwell), 50–60% need thyroid hormone replacement, and 60–80% of men require testosterone supplements. Finally, 10–25% develop diabetes insipidus, the inability to retain fluid in the kidneys {{due to a lack}} of the pituitary antidiuretic hormone. This may be treated with the drug desmopressin, which can be applied as a nose spray or taken by mouth.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the main}} {{objective}} is to navigate through seven worlds to {{reach the end of}} the game, the player can beat the game much faster by using secret Star Road routes. To access hidden worlds, the player will need to locate portals which are scattered throughout the game's levels. Portals are usually locked <b>and</b> <b>require</b> keys to open. Furthermore, the exploration of these secret stages can lead to other stages, such as Special World. Completion of Special World permanently alters some sprites and the overworld map's colour scheme.|$|E
5|$|Because DUI in New Jersey is a non-criminal traffic violation, state DUI {{laws are}} not subject to the Assimilative Crimes Act. Members of the Armed Forces can be court martialed for drunk driving, {{military}} bases can enforce New Jersey traffic law on civilians, and it is a misdemeanor under federal law to drive while intoxicated on land administered by the National Park Service, the Department of Veterans Affairs, or the Postal Service. Similar to New Jersey, federal DUI statutes prohibit the operation of a motor vehicle while having a BAC of 0.08% or greater, <b>and</b> <b>require</b> a driver to give a breath sample if requested by a law enforcement authority.|$|E
5|$|Birds need {{to alter}} their {{metabolism}} {{to meet the demands}} of migration. The storage of energy through the accumulation of fat and the control of sleep in nocturnal migrants require special physiological adaptations. In addition, the feathers of a bird suffer from wear-and-tear <b>and</b> <b>require</b> to be moulted. The timing of this moult – usually once a year but sometimes twice – varies with some species moulting prior to moving to their winter grounds and others molting prior to returning to their breeding grounds. Apart from physiological adaptations, migration sometimes requires behavioural changes such as flying in flocks to reduce the energy used in migration or the risk of predation.|$|E

5|$|Closed-circuit: A second rebreather {{containing}} one or {{more independent}} diving cylinders for its gas supply. Using another rebreather as a bail-out is possible but uncommon. Although the long duration of rebreathers seems compelling for bail-out, rebreathers are relatively bulky, complex, vulnerable to damage <b>and</b> <b>require</b> more time to start breathing from, than easy-to-use, instantly available, robust and reliable open-circuit equipment.|$|E
5|$|Colletid bees of {{the genus}} Leioproctus {{subgenus}} Cladocerapis exclusively forage on and pollinate flowers of many species of Persoonia. Bees of subgenus Filiglossa in the same genus that also specialise in feeding on Persoonia flowers {{do not appear to}} be effective pollinators. Particular species recorded on P.levis include the longtongue bee Leioproctus carinatifrons. Weighing 1700mg (0.60oz), the fruit are adapted to be eaten by vertebrates, such as kangaroos and possums, as well as currawongs and other large birds. The flowers of P.levis are self-incompatible—that is, they are unable to fertilise themselves <b>and</b> <b>require</b> outcrossing to another plant.|$|E
5|$|Conveyor belts offer a very {{efficient}} method of loading, with standard loading rates varying between 100 and 700tons per hour, although {{the most advanced}} ports can offer rates of 16,000tons per hour. Start-up and shutdown procedures with conveyor belts, though, are complicated <b>and</b> <b>require</b> time to carry out. Self-discharging ships use conveyor belts with load rates of around 1,000tons per hour.|$|E

5|$|Deck {{decompression}} chambers {{are used}} for surface decompression, described in a previous section. Most deck decompression chambers are fitted with built in breathing systems (BIBS), which supply an alternative breathing gas to the occupants (usually oxygen), and discharge the exhaled gas outside the chamber, so the chamber gas is not excessively enriched by oxygen, which would cause an unacceptable fire hazard, <b>and</b> <b>require</b> frequent flushing with chamber gas (usually air).|$|E
5|$|During the {{breeding}} season, the adult male Eurasian sparrowhawk loses {{a small amount}} of weight while feeding his mate before she lays eggs, and also when the young are large <b>and</b> <b>require</b> more food. The weight of the adult female is highest in May, when laying eggs, and lowest in August after {{the breeding}} cycle is complete. A study suggested that the number of eggs and subsequent breeding success are dependent on the female maintaining a high weight while the male is feeding her.|$|E

5|$|In 2010, some {{manufacturers}} (notably Samsung) introduced SSD controllers that extended {{the concept of}} BGC to analyze the file system used on the SSD, to identify recently deleted files and unpartitioned space. Samsung claimed that this would ensure that even systems (operating systems and SATA controller hardware) which do not support TRIM could achieve similar performance. The operation of the Samsung implementation appeared to assume <b>and</b> <b>require</b> an NTFS file system. It is not clear if this feature is still available in currently shipping SSDs from these manufacturers. Systematic data corruption has been reported on these drives {{if they are not}} formatted properly using MBR and NTFS.|$|E
