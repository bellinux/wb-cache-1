5|$|The {{definitive}} {{treatment for}} cholangitis is relief {{of the underlying}} biliary obstruction. This is usually deferred until 24–48hours after admission, when the patient is stable and has shown some improvement with antibiotics, but may need to happen <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>emergency</b> in case of ongoing deterioration despite adequate treatment, or if antibiotics are not effective in reducing the signs of infection (which happens in 15% of cases).|$|E

Between March and June 1940 the airfield was used by No. 15 Elementary Flying Training School at RAF Redhill as a relief landing ground. Knotley Hall was again requisitioned for use as the officers' quarters, although the tennis courts were off-limits.|$|E

5|$|Osea was {{the second}} {{tropical}} cyclone to impact French Polynesia during the season; Cyclone Martin had impacted the islands a few weeks earlier.

President Gaston Flosse, accompanied by technicians, arrived in Maupiti to help repair the island's electrical and hydraulic systems. A Latter-Day Saint meeting house was used <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>emergency</b> shelter, though the house itself sustained minor damage from the storm.

5|$|Oxygen {{first aid}} {{has been used}} <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>emergency</b> {{treatment}} for diving injuries for years.
