Utilizing a high-effort survey appended with recent <b>activity</b> <b>flags</b> from both Targus and Marketing Systems Group’s Cell-WINS, we find that between 5 and 6 percent of cell phone households would be excluded by utilizing these appends. Furthermore, the bias inherent in excluding either Targus “unknown ” sample or Cell-WINS “inactive ” sample is t near negligible in dual-frame surveys. Excluding such sample can reduce the amount of labor hours needed for telephone interviewing by as much as 20 percent. As with the adoption of list-assisted techniques for landline samples, we find that using recent <b>activity</b> <b>flags</b> substantially improves survey interviewing productivity rates without causing a meaningful increase in bias. In the mid- 1970 s, telephone surveys suffered from an inherent lack of efficiency. As a direct result, survey costs were considerable both in terms o...|$|R

By their functions, Servers are further divided as web, email, file server, compute, or multiple, and Workstations are further divided into teller, loan, or office. Every 15 minutes each computer generates a status log. Within the 48 hour period, the network accumulated approximately 160 million logs. Each log contains a time stamp, IP address, <b>activity</b> <b>flag,</b> policy status, and number of connections (NOC). Policy status has a value range from 1 to 5 to represent healthy status from normal to severe condition. Value 1 means the machine is healthy. 2 means the machine is suffering from mild policy deviation. 3 means the machine has non-critical patches failing and is suffering from serious policy deviations. 4 means critical policy deviations and many patches are failing. 5 means the machine may be infected by virus or unknown files are found. <b>Activity</b> <b>flags</b> also have 5 possible values range from 1 to 5.

The effect of subsoiling in fallow period on soil water storage, accumulation of proline, and formation of grain protein after anthesis were determined. Our results showed that subsoiling in fallow period could increase water storage in the 0 – 300 cm soil at pre-sowing stage and at anthesis stage with low or medium N application, especially for the 60 – 160 cm soil. However, the proline content, glutamine synthetase (GS) activity, glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) <b>activity</b> in <b>flag</b> leaves and grains were all decreased by subsoiling in fallow period. In addition, the content of albumin, gliadin, and total protein in grains were also decreased while globulin content, Glu/Gli, protein yield, and glutelin content were increased.

High N application resulted in the increment of proline content and GS activity in grains. Besides, correlation analysis showed that soil storage in 40 – 160 cm soil was negatively correlated with proline content in grains; proline content in grains was positively correlated with GS and GDH <b>activity</b> in <b>flag</b> leaves.

40|$|In this paper, a {{new family}} of shape {{descriptors}} called Free Shape Contexts (FSC) is introduced to generalize the existing 3 D Shape Contexts. The FSC introduces more degrees of freedom than its predecessor by allowing the level of complexity to vary between its parts. Also, {{each part of the}} FSC has an associated activity state which controls whether the part can contribute a feature value. We describe a method of evolving the FSC parameters for the purpose of creating highly discriminative features suitable for detecting specific objects in sparse point clouds. The evolutionary process is built on a genetic algorithm (GA) which optimizes the parameters with respect to cross-validated overall classification accuracy. The GA manipulates both the structure of the FSC and the <b>activity</b> <b>flags,</b> allowing it to perform an implicit feature selection alongside the structure optimization by turning off segments which do not augment the discriminative capabilities. We apply the proposed descriptor to the problem of detecting single standing dead tree trunks from ALS point clouds. The experiment, carried out on a set of 285 objects, reveals that an FSC optimized through a GA with manually tuned recombination parameters is able to attain a classification accuracy of 84. 2 %, yielding an increase of 4. 2 pp compared to features derived from eigenvalues of the 3 D covariance matrix. Also, we address the issue of automatically tuning the GA recombination metaparameters. For this purpose, a fuzzy logic controller (FLC) which dynamically adjusts the magnitude of the recombination effects is co-evolved with the FSC parameters in a two-tier evolution scheme. We find {{that it is possible to}} obtain an FLC which retains the classification accuracy of the manually tuned variant, thereby limiting the need for guessing the appropriate meta-parameter values...|$|R

Activity declined during the period in apparent associating with the senescence of tissues. In contrast, when NR estimates were made by a modified assay in which no exogenous nitrate was supplied, activity was consistently low. This suggested that relatively little nitrate was available for reduction in these tissues although NR enzyme appeared to be there. The cultivars accumulated approximately 85 % of their total reduced N before anthesis. Nitrogen accumulation, when nitrate was induced was substantially greater than the accumulation actually observed. So the results suggested that the minimal accumulation of reductase N after anthesis by the cultivars in this study should not {{be attributed to the}} level of NR enzyme.

This study focused on comparisons of the apparent recovery efficiency of nitrogen fertilizer (REN) in rice grown under OF and conventional farming (CF). Thirty-two representative conventional Japonica rice varieties were field grown under five different treatments: control check (CK); organic farming with low, medium {{and high levels of}} organic fertilizer (LO, MO and HO, respectively); and CF. Comparisons of REN between OF and CF classified the 32 genotypes into four types: high REN under both OF and CF (type-A); high REN under OF and low REN under CF (type-B); low REN under OF and high REN under CF (type-C); and low REN under both OF and CF (type-D). Though the yield and REN of all the rice varieties were higher with CF than with OF, organic N efficient type-A and B were able to maintain relatively high grain yield under OF. Physiological <b>activities</b> in <b>flag</b> leaves of the four types from booting to maturity were subsequently investigated under OF and CF. Under OF, high values of soil and plant analyzer development (SPAD) and N were observed in type-B varieties, while in contrast, both indexes slowly decreased in type-C varieties under CF. Moreover, the decline in N content in type-C and D varieties was greater under OF than CF. The decrease in glutamine synthetase (GS), glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (GPT) and glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT) <b>activity</b> in <b>flag</b> leaves was smaller under OF than CF in type-A and B varieties, while in contrast, type-C and D varieties showed an opposite trend. The findings suggest that OF slows the decline in key enzymes of N metabolism in organic N-efficient type rice, thus maintaining a relatively high capacity for N uptake and utilization and increasing yield during the late growth period. Accordingly, we were able to screen for varieties of rice with synergistically high REN and high grain yield under OF...|$|R

Both authorities and fishermen are aware of the contemporary coastal commercial fisheries in decline, but based on different knowledge basis and views of the future of fisheries. Secondly, in service work discourses from participant observations in fisheries service enterprising, “experienced authenticities” are negotiated, between fishermen and their customers. Third, in fishing discourses from interviews and observations in relation to colleagues and fishing, the fishery is constructed and negotiated between sets of “we” and “them”, to establish work identity.
