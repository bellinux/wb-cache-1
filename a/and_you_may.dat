25|$|A {{wide variety}} of wild animals and birds have been {{observed}} in the area. The ones you might see when rambling around the countryside are wild boar, deer, foxes, hares and rabbits. The birds in your garden will include sparrows, swallows, starlings, crows, rooks, magpies, pigeons, finches and robins <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>may</b> be lucky enough to see flocks of migrating wild geese flying by. In the forest, you will hear - and sometimes see - owls and woodpeckers. Some species have suffered from hunting in recent years but there are now considerable efforts to protect flora and fauna. An area of the commune's forest is now a nature reserve.|$|E
500|$|In April 2005, while captaining the Crusaders, McCaw again {{suffered}} a concussion. He was stretchered {{off the field}} two minutes into the game after attempting a tackle on Bulls prop Richard Bands. After the incident, McCaw visited a young boy in hospital who had broken his neck playing rugby and started to question whether he should be playing the game. Another paraplegic in the ward {{told him he had}} broken his neck swimming on holiday in Fiji, convincing McCaw that it could happen anywhere, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>may</b> as well [...] "do what you enjoy". A month later, in May 2005, McCaw returned to training with the Crusaders and led them in their semi-final and final victories.|$|E

500|$|In {{the year}} between his {{swearing-in}} and the 1898 Spanish–American War, Foraker was an enthusiastic supporter of Cuban independence from Spain. [...] A special session of Congress, called {{at the request}} of President McKinley, met beginning in March 1897 to consider new tariff legislation; hawkish senators, including Foraker (who was made a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee), took the opportunity to press resolutions in support of the Cuban insurgents. [...] Foraker was impatient with McKinley's policy towards Spain, decrying the President's State of the Union communication to Congress in December 1897 and his so-called [...] "war message", which some deemed insufficiently bellicose, in April 1898. [...] The senator stated to a reporter of the latter, [...] "I have no patience with the message <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>may</b> say so. [...] I have heard nothing but condemnation of the message on all hands." ...|$|E
500|$|Matsoukas {{initially}} {{planned the}} music video to visualize Beyoncé winning the contest, {{where she would}} {{realize that it was}} meaningless to her. However, Beyoncé suggested that an albino should serve as the contest's winner instead. Speaking to MTV News, Matsoukas elaborated: [...] "We thought it was really important and interesting to break those ideas of what the classic beauty standards would be and to do this with this beautiful albino woman, I thought was really great. And to show 'Yeah she's not perfect, she doesn't always win and you put your best foot forward <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>may</b> still lose.'" [...] The video's ending was originally intended to depict archival footage of American actresses Halle Berry and Vanessa A. Williams, to promote beauty for African-American women. However, Beyoncé sent a note to Matsoukas suggesting that footage from her childhood should be interpolated {{at the end of the}} song in order to connect it to the second music video from the album, [...] "Ghost".|$|E
500|$|When we now {{heard many}} {{disputes}} about the inheritance, I brought King Æthelwulf's will to our assembly at Langandene, {{and it was}} read before all the councillors of the West Saxons. When it had been read, I urged them all for love of me– and gave them my pledge that I would never bear a grudge against {{any one of them}} because they declared what was right– that none of them would hesitate, either for love or fear of me, to expound the common law, lest any man should say that I had treated my young kinsmen wrongfully, the older or the younger. And then they all pronounced what was right, and said that they could not conceive any juster title, nor could they find one in the will. [...] "Now everything has come into your possession, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>may</b> bequeath it or give it into the hand of kinsman or stranger, whichever you prefer." ...|$|E

500|$|This {{wall map}} has no title {{but it is}} {{normally}} referred to as Orbis Imago (from the first sentence of the central legend, below). Size: [...] Dedicated to Johannes Drosius. Two copies extant: [...] one at the American Geographical Society Library (link above), and another at the New York Public Library. The first map identifying North American and South America. [...] The map was a slightly modified copy of a [...] (and its text) by Oronce Fine. The double cordiform projection, {{may well have been}} chosen because of its relationship to aspects of Lutheran beliefs. A notice to the reader (...) {{at the top of the}} map says: [...] "Let America, Sarmatia and India bear witness, Dear Reader, that the image of the world you see here is newer and more correct than those that have been circulated hitherto. We propose with regard to the different parts of the world to treat, successively, particular regions more broadly, as we are already doing with Europe, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>may</b> soon expect a universal map, which will not be inferior to that of Ptolemy. Farewell. 1538".|$|E
500|$|On 10 August, Patton {{entered the}} {{receiving}} tent of the hospital, {{speaking to the}} injured there. Patton approached Bennett, who was huddled and shivering, and asked what the trouble was. [...] "It's my nerves," [...] Bennett responded. [...] "I can't stand the shelling anymore." [...] Patton reportedly became enraged at him, slapping him across the face. He began yelling: [...] "Your nerves, hell, you are just a goddamned coward. Shut up that goddamned crying. I won't have these brave {{men who have been}} shot at seeing this yellow bastard sitting here crying." [...] Patton then reportedly slapped Bennett again, knocking his helmet liner off, and ordered the receiving officer, Major Charles B. Etter, not to admit him. Patton then threatened Bennett, [...] "You're going back to the front lines <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>may</b> get shot and killed, but you're going to fight. If you don't, I'll stand you up against a wall and have a firing squad kill you on purpose. In fact, I ought to shoot you myself, you goddamned whimpering coward." [...] Upon saying this, Patton pulled out his pistol threateningly, prompting the hospital's commander, Colonel Donald E. Currier, to physically separate the two. Patton left the tent, yelling to medical officers to send Bennett back to the front lines.|$|E
500|$|The Author's Farce {{is not a}} {{standard}} comedy; rather, it is a farce, and as such employs petty forms of humour like slapstick. Instead of relying on rhetorical wit, Fielding incorporates dramatic incongruities. For example, actors play puppets in a life-size version of a puppet play. Fielding's purpose in relying on the farce tradition was specifically to criticise society as a whole. Like others, Fielding believed {{that there was a}} decline in popular theatre related to the expansion of its audience, therefore he satirises it, its audiences, and its writers throughout The Author's Farce. Speaking of popular entertainment in London, Fielding's character Luckless claims, [...] "If you must write, write nonsense, write operas, write entertainments, write Hurlothrumbos, set up an Oratory and preach nonsense, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>may</b> meet with encouragement enough." [...] Luckless's only ambition is to become successful. Many of the characters in the play believe that the substance of a play matters little as long as it can earn a profit. Harriot believes that the only important characteristic of a lover is his merit, which, to her, is his ability to become financially successful. Fielding later continues this line of attacks on audiences, morality, and genres when he criticises Samuel Richardson's epistolary novel Pamela, in which a nobleman makes advances upon a servant-maid with the intent of making her his mistress.|$|E

500|$|Following {{the retreat}} of the Confederate army, the Banu Qurayza {{neighbourhood}}s were besieged by the Muslims, in revenge. After a 25-day siege of their neighbourhood the Banu Qurayza unconditionally surrendered. When the Banu Qurayza tribe surrendered, the Muslim army seized their stronghold and their possessions. On {{the request of}} the Banu Aus, who were allied to the Qurayza, Muhammad chose one of them, Sa'ad ibn Mu'adh, as an arbitrator to pronounce judgment upon them. Sa'ad, who would later die of his wounds from the battle, decreed the sentence according to the Torah, in which the men shall be killed and women and children enslaved. [...] says: [...] When you march up to attack a city, make its people an offer of peace. If they accept and open their gates, all the people in it shall be subject to forced labor and shall work for you. If they refuse to make peace and they engage you in battle, lay siege to that city. When the Lord your God delivers it into your hand, put to the sword all the men in it. As for the women, the children, the livestock and everything else in the city, you may take these as plunder for yourselves. <b>And</b> <b>you</b> <b>may</b> use the plunder the Lord your God gives you from your enemies. [...] Muhammad approved of this decision, and the next day the sentence was carried out.|$|E
500|$|The {{physicians}} {{could not}} agree on a diagnosis. Radcliffe thought he had scarlet fever, while others thought it was smallpox. They administered [...] "cordial powders and cordial juleps". Gloucester was bled, to which Radcliffe strongly objected. He told his colleagues, [...] "you have destroyed him <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>may</b> finish him". He prescribed blistering, which was no more effective. In great pain, Gloucester passed the evening of 28 July [...] "in great sighings and dejections of spirits... towards morning, he complained very much of his blisters." [...] Anne, who had spent an entire day and night by her son's bedside, now became so distressed that she fainted. However, by midday on 29 July, Gloucester was breathing more easily and his headache had diminished, leading to hopes that he would recover. The improvement was fleeting, and that evening, he was [...] "taken with a convulsing sort of breathing, a defect in swallowing and a total deprivation of all sense". Prince William died close to 1 a.m. on 30 July 1700, with his parents beside him. In the end, the physicians decided {{the cause of death}} was [...] "a malignant fever". An autopsy revealed severe swelling of the lymph nodes in the neck and an abnormal amount of fluid in the ventricles of his brain: [...] "four and a half ounces of a limpid humour were taken out." [...] A modern diagnosis is that Gloucester died of acute bacterial pharyngitis, with associated pneumonia. Had he lived, though, it is almost certain the prince would have succumbed to complications of his hydrocephalus.|$|E

2500|$|Myers {{was born}} in Decatur, Illinois on January 23, 1930. At age 10, he learned to play chess from Lasker's Manual of Chess, a famous {{treatise}} by former World Champion Emanuel Lasker. The book had a lasting influence on him, including Lasker's [...] "encouragement regarding the openings, 'the ground trodden above is yet rather new, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>may</b> explore {{it as well as}} anyone else.'" [...] After his father brought home the December 1943 issue of Chess Review, Myers began visiting the Decatur Chess Club weekly. In 1946, he played in his first chess tournament, finishing second in the Decatur high school championship.|$|E

[...] John Nova Lomax said that the Heights, which he describes as [...] "Houston's own mini-Austin," [...] had many [...] "low-key" [...] restaurants and beer gardens. The Houston Heights Association describes the Heights as being bounded by Interstate 10 on the south, North Shepherd Drive on the west, Interstate 610 on the north and both North Main and Studewood Streets on the east.|$|E

Although he did not believe Harris intentionally broke any laws, [...] "her story kept changing. Our great concern was that you get into trouble when you don't tell the same story twice ... Maybe you don't think you did anything wrong, but then maybe you start getting questioned about it and so forth, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>may</b> perjure yourself. ...

2500|$|Johann Wolfgang von Goethe says, [...] "Treat {{people as}} they were {{that they ought to}} be <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>may</b> help them to become what they are capable of being". As a leader, there are two qualities that you need to focus on in an organization: the {{structure}} of the organization and how followers are involved. The type of leadership you want in an organization would be a democratic approach. A democratic leader does not feel threatened when followers make suggestions, but instead accepts the contributions to help improve the overall quality of decision-making. Having a democratic system allows for the followers to set goals for the organization, and this creates two-way communication that openly flows between the leader and followers. The leader wants to have more interaction with the followers. Through interaction it allows followers to be engaged in the organization, but they also have a higher participation rate. The democratic style of leadership communication is often most effective. Generally, the benefits derived from democratic communication far outweigh any potential cost.|$|E
2500|$|In 2004, Knight reprised {{the role}} of Ruth in Pirates with the Lyric Opera of Chicago. [...] Chicago radio host Bruce Duffie, {{interviewing}} Knight after seeing that production noted, [...] "Gillian Knight {{is one of those}} great personalities who simply go about their business season after season, giving splendid renditions of various roles, and adding luster to their home companies while not going far afield very often and, thus, passing up the opportunity for real world-wide stardom". During that interview, Knight said, [...] "I'm getting a bit controversial here, but there is a snobbish attitude towards Gilbert and Sullivan in the opera world.... I believe in excellence. [...] Now I believe that if Gilbert and Sullivan is done well... then it is excellent, and it should be in a [...] house". [...] She advised audiences, [...] "Don't close your mind to anything because somebody has said, 'Oh, this is Gilbert and Sullivan,' or, 'This is modern music.' [...] Just keep an open mind <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>may</b> be surprised at how much you get out of it".|$|E
