40|$|A CSP-C {{continuous}} sampling plan is a new single-level {{continuous sampling}} procedure developed by Govindaraju & Kandasamy (2000) by incorporating the concept of acceptance number to the CSP- 1 plan {{for the application of}} continuous production processes. In this new plan, the sampling inspection phase is characterized by a maximum allowable number of non-conforming units, c, and a constant sampling rate, f. Govindaraju & Kandasamy (2000) derived the performance measures such as <b>average</b> <b>outgoing</b> <b>quality</b> (AOQ), <b>average</b> fraction inspected (AFI) etc, of the CSP-C plan using a Markov chain model for long run production processes. Yang (1983) has observed that the AOQ and AFI, being long run average measures, are not satisfactory measures of performance for short run production processes. Hence, formulas are derived in this paper, using the renewal theory approach enabling one to compute AOQ and AFI for both long run and short run production processes.

40|$|Abstract: All {{classical}} {{acceptance sampling}} plans were constructed with {{the proportion of}} defective that is crisp value. In the manufacturing processes, this parameter in a production lot may not be precis ely known. Hence it is meaningful to treat such parameter as fuzzy quantities. In this paper we have argued for the acceptance double sampling plan when the proportion of defective items is a fuzzy number and it is being modeled based on the fuzzy Poisson distribution. The calculation of the Operating Characteristic (OC) curves, Average Sample Number (ASN) curves, <b>Average</b> <b>Outgoing</b> <b>Quality</b> (AOQ) curves and Average Total Inspection (ATI) curves of the plan will be presented for double plan by using the concept of fuzzy probability. The results show that these four curves are like band having high and low bounds with their width depending on the ambiguity proportion parameter in the lot, when the size and acceptance numbers of the samples are fixed. We have als o shown that in this plan, if the process quality is perfect or poor, then the ASN and AOQ bands will be of lower value.

40|$|A {{considerable}} {{portion of}} quality control managers lime in a production system {{is spent in}} routine and complex decision-making processes that have significant impact on <b>average</b> <b>outgoing</b> <b>quality,</b> quality improvement, and quality cost.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{classification}} of judgement in attribute acceptance sampling plan {{is based on}} binary classification such as defective or non-defective. However, in many practical cases {{it is difficult to}} classify the item as strictly conforming or nonconforming when quality data related to various items are expressed as good, almost good, bad, not so bad and so on. This introduces vagueness in the value of proportion defective in the lot / process. Fuzzy sets and fuzzy logic are powerful mathematical tools for modeling uncertain systems which has incomplete and imprecise information. Hence, in this paper special double sampling plan under fuzzy environment is studied. The performance measures operating characteristic (OC) function and <b>average</b> <b>outgoing</b> <b>quality</b> (AOQ) functions under fuzzy and non fuzzy environment are evalu-ated and presented...|$|R
40|$|In {{this article}} the {{outgoing}} {{quality and the}} total inspection for the chain sampling plan ChSP- 4 (c 1, c 2) are introduced as well-defined random variables.

The aim {{of this article is}} to develop procedures for minimum variance ChSP- 4 (c 1, c 2) sampling plans and their determination. In addition to minimum variance sampling plans, a procedure is developed for designing plans with a designated maximum variance, a VOQL (Variance of Outgoing Quality Limit) plan. The VOQL concept is analogous to the AOQL (<b>Average</b> <b>Outgoing</b> <b>Quality</b> <b>Limit)</b> except in the VOQL plan, it is the maximum variance which is established instead of the usual maximum AOQ...|$|E

This paper describes a methodology for the design of appropriate V-masks for cusum control charts in case of a combined production and conformity control, satisfying multiple criteria such as the average run length (ARL) and the <b>average</b> <b>outgoing</b> <b>quality</b> <b>limit</b> (AOQL). Monte Carlo simulations are used in order to calculate operating characteristic curves (OC-curves) associated with different cusum charts. The influence of autocorrelation between test results is investigated and discussed. As a result, proper design guidelines for a combined production and conformity control of concrete are presented...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In 1986 Taguchi {{presented}} the quadratic function for describing {{the loss of}} quality due to deviation from the production value. The objective then is to improve quality by minimizing the quadratic loss function which reflects the loss of both, the producer and the consumer. Subsequently, Kapur et al. (1987, 1988, 1994) addressed the problem of deriving a loss function to be applied for determining the design of specification limits. This article further explores the problem of determining an integrated design of a Type I continuous sampling plan (CSP- 1) and the specification limits. By modifying Kapur and Wang’s (1987) model, we not only obtain economic specification limits, but also obtaib an optimal CSP- 1 plan for inspection.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} Skip-lot {{sampling}} {{is to reduce}} the Average Sample Number (ASN) and Average Total Inspection (ATI) as well as inspection costs.

This paper presents the comparison of skip lot sampling plan SkSP- 2 and SkSP-V in terms of Probability Accepting, (Pa), <b>Average</b> <b>Outgoing</b> <b>Quality</b> (AOQ), ASN, ATI and also cost reduction. The results indicated that SkSP- 2 and SkSP-V were not significant different on the Pa and AOQ. However, SkSP-V gave lowest cost significantly both from ASN and ATI. This property shows the advantage of SkSP-V for the lowest cost inspection but SkSP- 2 for easier implementation because of the smaller parameters in actual operation...|$|R
40|$|A Continuous Sampling Plan, CSP-CUSUM, is {{proposed}} {{based on the}} use of Cumulative Sums (CUSUMs) for deciding when to switch between the phases of sampling inspection and 100 % inspection. The Geometric CUSUM, also termed the Run-length CUSUM, is chosen for this purpose, and two separate CUSUMs are to be operated, one for each inspection phase. The conventional measures of performance for CSPs such as <b>average</b> <b>outgoing</b> <b>quality,</b> <b>average</b> fraction inspected, and average proportion passed under sampling inspection are evaluated for CSP-CUSUM, and comparisons with some standard CSPs are presented. An additional performance-measure, Average Cycle Length, {{is proposed}}. A table is provided to aid the choice of parameters for the operation of CSP-CUSUM. It is recommended that a Geometric CUSUM control chart be maintained in parallel with CSP-CUSUM to detect significant upward shifts in the incoming fraction defective. ...|$|R
40|$|When {{screening}} {{a production}} process for nonconforming items {{the objective is}} to improve the <b>average</b> <b>outgoing</b> <b>quality</b> level. Due to measurement errors specification limits cannot be checked directly and hence test limits are required, which meet some given requirement, here given by a prescribed bound on the consumer loss. Classical test limits are based on normality, both for the product characteristic and for the measurement error. In practice, often nonnormality occurs for the product characteristic {{as well as for the}} measurement error. Recently, nonnormality of the product characteristic has been investigated. In this paper attention is focussed on the measurement error. Firstly, it is shown that nonnormality can lead to serious failure of the test limit. New test limits are therefore derived, which have the desired robustness property: a small loss under normality and a large gain in case of nonnormality when compared to the normal test limit. Monte Carlo results illustrate that the asymptotic theory is in agreement with moderate sample behaviour...|$|R
