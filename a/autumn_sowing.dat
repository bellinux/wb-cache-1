Dry matter (DM) {{accumulation}} {{was dependent on}} the duration of crop growth which {{was influenced by the}} time of <b>sowing.</b> <b>Autumn</b> <b>sown</b> crops which flowered latest had a longer duration of vegetative growth and consequently produced the highest dry matter yields. In the establishment year, <b>autumn</b> <b>sown</b> crops produced up to 17. 5 t DM/ha for balansa, 12. 5 t DM/ha for Persian, 11. 0 t DM/ha for gland and 9. 4 t DM/ha for arrowleaf at physiological maturity (P< 0. 05). Crops that were sown in winter produced the lowest yield, because reproductive development commenced earlier and therefore they matured earlier. ‘Bolta’ balansa clover had the highest radiation use efficiency of 2. 1 g DM/MJ photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) absorbed followed by gland (1. 6 g DM/MJ PAR), arrowleaf and Persian (1. 3 g DM/MJ PAR) clovers. In the second year, regenerated dry matter production at full flower was up to 11. 6 t/ha in balansa, 8. 3 t/ha in Persian, 2. 9 t/ha in gland but only 0. 5 t/ha in arrowleaf clover (P< 0. 05). Thus, over the two years ‘Bolta’ balansa and ‘Mihi’ Persian clovers were the highest yielding and easiest to regenerate from seed in monocultures. ‘Cefalu’ arrowleaf failed to regenerate in the second year due to low population of seedling emergence. ‘Prima’ gland clover was low yielding because it flowered and matured without fully utilising the growing season...|$|R

However, a comprehensive understanding of the effects and mode of action of Rht 12 is lacking. In the present study, the effects of Rht 12 were characterized by analyzing its effects on seeding vigour, seedling roots, leaf and stem morphology, spike development and carbohydrate assimilation and distribution. This {{was carried out in}} the four genotypes of F 2 : 3 lines derived from a cross between Ningchun 45 and Karcagi (12) in two experiments of <b>autumn</b> <b>sowing</b> and spring sowing. Rht 12 significantly decreased stem length (43 %, 48 % for peduncle) and leaf length (25 %, 30 % for flag leaf) while the thickness of the internode walls and width of the leaves were increased. Though the final plant stature was shortened (40 %) by Rht 12, the seedling vigour, especially coleoptile length and root traits at the seedling stage, were not affected adversely. Rht 12 elongated the duration of the spike development phase, improved the proportion of spike dry weight at anthesis and significantly increased floret fertility (14 %) in the <b>autumn</b> <b>sowing</b> experiment. However, Rht 12 delayed anthesis date by around 5 days and even the dominant Vrn-B 1 allele could not compensate this negative effect. Additionally, grain size was reduced with the ability to support spike development after anthesis decreased in Rht 12 lines.

Journal of Agricultural Science, 145 (04), 329 - 342 Three experiments conducted {{over two years}} (2002 ? 04) at the Crops Research Unit, University of Reading, investigated competition between <b>autumn</b> <b>sown</b> oilseed rape cultivars (Brassica napus L. ssp. oleifera var. biennis (DC.) Metzg.) and Lolium multiflorum Lam., L. ?boucheanum Kunth and Alopecurus myosuroides Huds., sown as indicative grass weeds. Rape cultivar (cv.) had a substantial effect on grass weed seed return. Over the six cultivars tested, L. multiflorum spikelet production ranged from just under 400 spikelets/m 2 {{in the presence of}} cv. Winner to nearly 5800 in competition with cv. Lutin. Cultivar competitiveness was associated with high biomass, large dense floral layers and early stem extension. There was some evidence of differential competitive tolerance between rape cultivars. The results suggested that rape cultivars could be screened for competitiveness by measuring floral layer interception of photosynthetic active radiation. L. ?boucheanum cultivars varied in ability to compete with rape. In the absence of inter-specific competition, spikelet density was similar for Aberecho and Polly (circa 31 000 spikelets/m 2) but when grown with rape Polly outyielded Aberecho (i. e. 12 090 and 7990 spikelets/m 2 respectively).
