40|$|A {{manually}} operated cashew juice extractor operating on screw press principle was designed, constructed and tested. <b>Apple</b> <b>crushing</b> was by pressing a wooden piston against a steel reinforced end plate. Juice output was 1. 02 litres/hr {{and the average}} juice extraction efficiency was 85. 38 %. Three samples of the juice (fresh juice, juice stored under ambient conditions for 24 hrs and refrigerated juice at 5 oC) were tested for sensory evaluation. The results indicated a significant difference (p< 0. 05) between the colour, taste and general acceptability of juice under ambient storage when compared with fresh juice; {{but there was no}} significant difference in the mouth feel. There was no significant difference between the colour, taste and mouth feel of the refrigerated juice and fresh juice; but the difference in general acceptability was significant. The refrigerated juice had the highest general acceptability by the panelists. The physico-chemical characteristics show that appearance, specific gravity, pH and total soluble solids of the juice are affected significantly (p< 0. 05) by storage under ambient conditions but only the specific gravity changed significantly (p< 0. 05) during refrigeration. The vitamin C content of the refrigerated juice was higher than juice stored under ambient conditions. A device of this nature can be manufactured in small machine shops in the cashew producing developing countries for village level applications...|$|E

2500|$|HCN is {{obtainable}} from fruits {{that have}} a pit, such as cherries, apricots, apples, and bitter almonds, from which almond oil and flavoring are made. Many of these pits contain small amounts of cyanohydrins such as mandelonitrile and amygdalin, which slowly release hydrogen cyanide. One hundred grams of <b>crushed</b> <b>apple</b> seeds can yield about 70mg of HCN. Some millipedes release hydrogen cyanide as a defense mechanism, as do certain insects, such as some burnet moths. Hydrogen cyanide is contained in the exhaust of vehicles, and in smoke from burning nitrogen-containing plastics.

50|$|The cider-makers {{originally}} {{beat the}} strikers alternatingly on the cider press {{in order to}} <b>crush</b> <b>apples,</b> adopting a playful and rhythmic pattern {{as a means to}} enlivening the long process. The pattern remains similar: two or three people {{standing in front of the}} board beat it each with a striker, they may move along the board in search of different sounds and try faster/slower and harder/softer beats on it. When there are three people playing, the rhythmic pattern is a ternary one (3/8 time or simple triple). Optionally, a player may choose not to strike on the board on their turn (rest). Alongside the beating performance, the players may engage in singing.|$|R

40|$|International audienceInitial {{crushing}} {{and pressing}} operations {{have a major}} influence on the polyphenolic composition of apple juice, therefore, we have tested the impact of variations of this step using three cider apple cultivars of contrasting polyphenolic composition: Guillevic, Kermerrien and Dous Moen. Under inert atmosphere, increased temperature (between 5 °C and 24 °C), increased the extraction of procyanidins from fruit to juice. The <b>crushed</b> <b>apples</b> were also subjected to four conditions of oxidation: preserved from oxidation as above, short contact with air, short contact with air and mixing, long contact with air and mixing. Oxidation decreased the concentrations of native polyphenols in the juices, especially for flavan- 3 -ols. The golden colour of the juices was initially enhanced with increases in saturation C * and a shift of the hue angle from yellow to orange. However, for the highest oxidation state the colour became paler and more yellow. Bitterness and astringency decreased upon oxidation, probably due to increased retention of oxi-dised moieties...|$|R
50|$|Savanna Dry is a South African cider {{introduced}} by the Distell Group Limited in May 1996.

Savanna is available in three variations: Savanna Dry, Savanna Light and the recently added Savanna Dark and Savanna Gold. Savanna Gold also has a seasonal flavor with tequila. Savanna Dry is the first cider produced by Savanna and contains an alcohol level of 6% ABV. Savanna Light was launched in May 2000 and contains an alcohol level of 3% ABV.|$|R
6000|$|Jane Eyre, who {{had been}} an ardent, {{expectant}} woman--almost a bride, was a cold, solitary girl again: her life was pale; her prospects were desolate. A Christmas frost had come at midsummer; a white December storm had whirled over June; ice glazed the ripe <b>apples,</b> drifts <b>crushed</b> the blowing roses; on hayfield and cornfield lay a frozen shroud: lanes which last night blushed full of flowers, to-day were pathless with untrodden snow; and the woods, which twelve hours since waved leafy and flagrant as groves between the tropics, now spread, waste, wild, and white as pine-forests in wintry Norway. My hopes were all dead--struck with a subtle doom, such as, in one night, fell on all the first-born {{in the land of}} Egypt. I looked on my cherished wishes, yesterday so blooming and glowing; they lay stark, chill, livid corpses that could never revive. I looked at my love: that feeling which was my master's--which he had created; it shivered in my heart, like a suffering child in a cold cradle; sickness and anguish had seized it; it could not seek Mr. Rochester's arms--it could not derive warmth from his breast. Oh, never more could it turn to him; for faith was blighted--confidence destroyed! Mr. Rochester was not to me what he had been; for he was not what I had thought him. I would not ascribe vice to him; I would not say he had betrayed me; but the attribute of stainless truth was gone from his idea, and from his presence I must go: that I perceived well. When--how--whither, I could not yet discern; but he himself, I doubted not, would hurry me from Thornfield. Real affection, it seemed, he could not have for me; it had been only fitful passion: that was balked; he would want me no more. I should fear even to cross his path now: my view must be hateful to him. Oh, how blind had been my eyes! How weak my conduct! ...|$|R
5000|$|Because the IBM PC {{was based}} on {{relatively}} standard integrated circuits, and the basic card-slot design was not patented, the key portion of that hardware was actually the BIOS software embedded in read-only memory. This critical element got reverse engineered, and that opened the floodgates to the market for IBM PC imitators, which were dubbed [...] "PC clones". At the time that IBM had decided to enter the personal computer market in response to Apple's early success, IBM was the giant of the computer industry and was expected to <b>crush</b> <b>Apple's</b> market share. But because of these shortcuts that IBM took to enter the market quickly, they ended up releasing a product that was easily copied by other manufacturers using off the shelf, non-proprietary parts. So in the long run, IBM's biggest role {{in the evolution of}} the personal computer was to establish the de facto standard for hardware architecture amongst a wide range of manufacturers. IBM's pricing was undercut to the point where IBM was no longer the significant force in development, leaving only the PC standard they had established. Emerging as the dominant force from this battle amongst hardware manufacturers who were vying for market share was the software company Microsoft that provided the operating system and utilities to all PCs across the board, whether authentic IBM machines or the PC clones.|$|R
40|$|Carotenoids and {{ergosterol}} are industrially significant metabolites probably {{involved in}} yeast stress response mechanisms. Thus, controlled physiological and nutrition stress including {{use of waste}} substrates {{can be used for}} their enhanced production. In this work two red yeast strains of the genus Sporobolomyces (Sporobolomyces roseus, Sporobolomyces shibatanus) were studied. To increase the yield of metabolites at improved biomass production, several types of exogenous as well as nutrition stress were tested. Each strain was cultivated at optimal growth conditions and in medium with modified carbon and nitrogen sources. Synthetic media with addition of complex substrates (e. g. yeast extract) and vitamin mixtures as well as some waste materials (whey, <b>apple</b> fibre, wheat, <b>crushed</b> pasta) were used as nutrient sources. Peroxide and salt stress were applied too, cells were exposed to oxidative stress (2 - 10 mM H 2 O 2) and osmotic stress (2 - 10 % NaCl). During the experiment, growth characteristics and the production of biomass, carotenoids and ergosterol were evaluated. In optimal conditions tested strains substantially differed in biomass as well as metabolite production. S. roseus produced about 50 % of biomass produced by S. shibatanus (8 g/L). Oppositely, production of pigments and ergosterol by S. roseus was 3 - 4 times higher than in S. shibatanus. S. roseus was able to use most of waste substrates, the best production of ergosterol (8. 9 mg/g d. w.) and beta-carotene (4. 33 mg/g d. w.) was obtained in medium with crushed pasta hydrolyzed by mixed enzyme from Phanerochaetae chrysosporium. Regardless very high production of carotenes and ergosterol, S. roseus is probably not suitable for industrial use because of relatively low biomass production...|$|R
