The planet designated as P3X-984, in the storyline unknown to the Goa'uld, was shot in a gravel pit at Mount Seymour in North Vancouver. The set designers used a number of sets from season 4's [...] "Prodigy" [...] for the façade and filled the remaining gaps with the set decorator and transportation tents.

As seen in season 6's [...] "Allegiance", several of Earth's allies, mainly the Tok'ra and Rebel Jaffa, use this site as a secure location to hide from the Goa'uld. The <b>Alpha</b> <b>Site</b> also serves as the temporary home for any large groups of people that are evacuated from their own planets, and a testing facility for Earth's new prototype spacecraft.

By systematic variation {{of the value of}} adsorbate chemical potential in the simulations, the adsorption isotherms are determined, It is found that adsorption follows the Langmuir mechanism only up to a rather low relative pressure value in every case. In this range specific surface <b>sites,</b> called <b>alpha</b> <b>sites,</b> to which adsorbate molecules can be bound particularly strongly in specific orientation, are occupied. In these <b>alpha</b> <b>sites,</b> presumably the dangling OH bonds of the ice surface form O-H-center dot center dot center dot center dot pi-type hydrogen bonds with the delocalized pi electrons of the adsorbed aromatic molecule lying parallel with the ice surface. Once these <b>alpha</b> <b>sites</b> are saturated, lateral interactions become increasingly important, leading to large fluctuations of the lateral density of the adsorption layer and an increasing deviation of the adsorption isotherm from the Langmuir shape. The adsorption layer is found to be strictly monomolecular and even unsaturated in every case, as condensation well precedes the saturation of this monolayer for all four aromatic adsorbates considered in this study...|$|R

40|$|International audienceWe have {{evaluated}} {{the effect of}} rabies virus infection on interleukin- 1 alpha (IL- 1 alpha) production and its receptors in mouse brain. Study of virus dissemination in {{the central nervous system}} (CNS) showed a massive infection of main brain structures from day 4 post infection (p. i.) up to the agony stage on day 6 p. i. At the same time, IL- 1 alpha concentrations increased in cortical and hippocampal homogenates, whereas no change was detected in serum. In non-infected mice, IL- 1 <b>alpha</b> binding <b>sites</b> were observed in the dentate gyrus, the cortex, the choroid plexus, the meninges and the anterior pituitary. During rabies virus infection, a striking decrease in IL- 1 <b>alpha</b> binding <b>sites</b> was observed on day 4 p. i. with a complete disappearance on day 6 p. i., except in the pituitary gland where they remained at control level. In conclusion, concomitantly with the early rabid pathological signs, brain IL- 1 alpha production and IL- 1 <b>alpha</b> binding <b>sites</b> are specifically and significantly altered by brain viral proliferation.
