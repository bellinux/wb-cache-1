5|$|The captive {{breeding}} program, {{led by the}} San Diego Wild <b>Animal</b> <b>Park</b> and Los Angeles Zoo, {{and with}} other participating zoos around the country, including the Oklahoma City Zoo and Botanical Garden, {{got off to a}} slow start due to the condor's mating habits.

Another eleven animals believed to be Barbary lions were found in Addis Ababa zoo, descendants of animals owned by Emperor Haile Selassie. WildLink International, in collaboration with Oxford University, launched their ambitious International Barbary Lion Project with the aim of identifying and breeding Barbary lions in captivity for eventual reintroduction into a national park in the Atlas Mountains of Morocco.|$|E
