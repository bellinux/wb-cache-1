40|$|<b>Assignment</b> <b>of</b> <b>Contract</b> The {{purpose of}} this master's thesis is to analyze the {{assignability}} of contracts under Czech law {{in the light of}} comparative, historical and theoretical aspects of this phenomenon. Relevance of this subject matter was recently highlighted by adoption of the new Czech Civil Code, which expressly authorizes this operation but leaves important issues open to interpretation. The thesis is composed of an introduction, two main parts and a conclusion. First two chapters of the first part deal with historical development of this legal concept. In the roman law, a contractual obligation was conceived as a "bond of law" (iuris vinculum), which implied a strictly personal nature of this relationship. However, this view started to change as soon as the roman economy shifted from agriculture towards trade and business, resulting in assignability of a contractual right. In the codification era of the 19 th century, the concept of a delegation of contractual duty came in, establishing a theoretical foundation for the <b>assignment</b> <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> as such. The third chapter moves our attention to the modern times, focusing primarily on the assignement of contract in various European countries, United States and Japan. The emphasis is put on the theoretical discussions this legal concept has seen in [...] ...|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} the legal {{institution}} of <b>assignment</b> <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> from comparative point of view. The core of contract assignment lies in the replacement of a contractual party by a third person during {{the existence of a}} contractual relationship. As a new institution in Czech civil law introduced by the Civil Code as of 1. January 2014, the topic has not been sufficiently covered in legal theory and therefore its academic elaboration is highly actual. Before the 1 January 2014, the <b>assignment</b> <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> was not expressly recognised by the Civil Code 1964 or the Commercial Code, however the practice often pointed out the lack of legal regulation and looked for other ways to achieve the replacement of the contractual party. The goal of this thesis is to identify the diversities between the chosen legal regulations and to provide an evaluation of the Czech regulation based on comparison with foreign approaches. Comparison with the Italian civil law concept of cessione del contratto was chosen because of its major influence on other European codifications of contract law including the Civil Code 2012. Other regulations, such as the Civil Code of Netherlands, European Contract Code, Principles of European Contract Law, Draft Common Frame of Reference or UNIDROIT Principles of International [...] ...|$|E

40|$|The textile {{industry}} achieves economic benefits through outsourcing to low cost markets. Today, reshoring is an emerging trend due to rising cost and unemployment concerns. This problem is {{primarily due to}} an industry-wide focus on economic benefits only. Cost saving is a basic reason for international outsourcing while domestic outsourcing provides capacity flexibility. Moreover, outsourcing risk has {{a major impact on}} strategic location of the production destinations. Therefore, the merging of capacity flexibility and outsourcing risk comprises a sustainable outsourcing strategy. This paper suggests a sustainable outsourcing strategy in which a textile manufacturer outsources to international markets for cost savings and outsources to the domestic market for capacity flexibility. The manufacturer reserves some capacity with domestic suppliers, and pays a unit penalty cost if this capacity flexibility is not utilized. The manufacturer seeks minimum risk in international markets. Operational cost, penalty cost, and outsourcing risk are considered to be objective functions. Decisions include the <b>assignment</b> <b>of</b> <b>contracts</b> to suitable facilities, the quantity <b>of</b> each <b>contract,</b> and allocation <b>of</b> reserved capacity flexibility among domestic suppliers. Multi-objective problem of this research was solved using three variants of goal programming. Several insights are proposed for outsourcing decision making in the current global environment...|$|R

Following enactment of the Defense Acquisition Workforce Improvement Act in 1990 the Army created the Army Acquisition Corps (AAC). A review of the billets available for Functional Area 97 contracting officers, however, reveals that well over half of the positions are coded for branch immaterial officers, meaning any officer from any branch can fill the slot. The objective of this thesis is to examine the rationale behind the current organization <b>of</b> <b>contracting</b> personnel in an attempt to determine whether there should be more FA 97 positions coded to require branch, or branch-type, specific officers, as well as to identify where the billets should be. A survey of 175 senior officers in the AAC was conducted in order to gauge the level of command preference for user experience on the part <b>of</b> <b>contracting</b> officers. Respondents indicated that: an increase in the level of emphasis placed on branch coding FA 97 billets should be beneficial but that a determination as to the cost of an increased reliance must first be made; the best level for branch coding decisions is at the organizational level; and there does exist a relationship between the Career Management Fields and the AMC MACOM commodity group organization.

40|$|Purpose – In the USA, private {{insurance}} companies {{serve as an}} integral part of the delivery and risk sharing of the federal crop insurance program. Governed by the Standard Reinsurance Agreement (SRA), private crop insurance companies must designate an eligible crop insurance contract to the assigned risk, developmental, or commercial funds. While the SRA restricts the private sector delivery system in a number <b>of</b> ways, the <b>assignment</b> <b>of</b> <b>contracts</b> to crop insurance funds, however, is left solely to the discretion of individual crop insurance companies. Thus, as to the companies' profitability viewpoint, the optimal selection of the crop insurance funds is the most important task. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to provide a decision framework for crop insurance companies to make optimal decisions regarding the purchases of crop reinsurance. This information and framework may also be useful for crop insurance firms in China when considering crop reinsurance decisions. Design/methodology/approach – The paper studied three commonly used parametric loss distributions and presented a general guideline to choose the most profitable fund within the company's risk bearing level. Findings – The paper finds many important features in the commonly used loss distributions, which are useful to maximize the company's underwriting returns. Originality/value – The paper provides a general decision framework for optimally ceding risks to reinsurance. While this paper focused on agricultural insurance decisions by firms, the concept could be applied to general reinsurance decisions.

The <b>assignment</b> <b>of</b> 2 ̆ 2 moneys due and to become due 2 ̆ 2 under a building or construction contract has been institutional for nearly a hundred years: the contractor (or subcontractor) at the outset assigns to his bank the money he will earn by future performance as security for the present loan which enables him to undertake the job.

The financing <b>of</b> government procurement <b>contracts</b> during World War II probably furnished the major stimulus for the spread of the device into other industries. The sudden and enormous increase of industrial production dictated by the war effort required a huge volume of new financing. That task could have been undertaken by the United States, but was instead delegated, to the extent possible, to private financing institutions. As one method of encouraging the banks to do their bit, the United States, reversing its long-standing policy, agreed, by the <b>Assignment</b> <b>of</b> Claims Act of 1940, to recognize <b>assignments</b> <b>of</b> moneys to become due under contracts with the federal government or its agencies.

We also examine whether misalignment between transaction and supplier characteristics and the control structure is associated with ex post performance problems. Characteristics associated with hazards are found to be positively related to contract extensiveness. Factor analysis of the use <b>of</b> 24 <b>contract</b> terms reveals four groups <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> terms that are commonly used in combination. We interpret these factors as "dimensions of management control" and label them: <b>assignment</b> <b>of</b> rights, product and price, after-sales service, and legal recourse. Characteristics associated with hazards are positively related to the use of all four dimensions of management control, with different hazards associated with different controls.
