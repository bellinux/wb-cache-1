25|$|As a {{hypothetical}} document, the Q source is still only a hypothesis. Prior {{to the discovery}} of the Gospel of Thomas in 1945 it was thought that a Gospel without a narrative that only contained sayings was out of the question. The find of the Gospel of Thomas in Nag Hammadi changed the possibility of a gospel of sayings. The possibility of the Q source being an <b>ancient</b> <b>document</b> has become closer to reality with the discovery of Thomas.|$|E
25|$|Numerous older tablets {{have been}} found in the region with similar scripts written in other Semitic languages, for example Protosinaitic. It is {{believed}} that the original shapes of the script go back to Egyptian hieroglyphs, though the phonetic values are instead inspired by the acrophonic principle. The common ancestor of Hebrew and Phoenician is called Canaanite, and was the first to use a Semitic alphabet distinct from Egyptian. One <b>ancient</b> <b>document</b> is the famous Moabite Stone written in the Moabite dialect; the Siloam Inscription, found near Jerusalem, is an early example of Hebrew. Less ancient samples of Archaic Hebrew include the ostraca found near Lachish which describe events preceding the final capture of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar and the Babylonian captivity of 586 BCE.|$|E

2500|$|In late 2007 two amateur archaeologists on an ecclesiastical {{archaeology}} {{course at}} the University of Sussex unexpectedly found an <b>ancient</b> <b>document</b> giving {{the dedication of the}} church, which had been unknown since the English Reformation or before. Tony and Lesley Voice were examining documents at The National Archives in Kew, London, when they found a piece of vellum stuck to the back of one. It was a letter written by the Bishop of Chichester Stephen Bersted to King Edward I in 1275, indicating that the church was dedicated to Mary the Virgin. Accordingly, a rededication ceremony was held at the now redundant church on 8 December 2007, at which it was officially renamed from North Stoke Church to St Mary the Virgin Church. [...] Other discoveries made at the same time included the involvement of William FitzAlan, 16th Earl of Arundel in the medieval life of the church.|$|E

[Footnote: THE BOLDEN BOOK. As this <b>ancient</b> <b>document</b> gives the first trace of the Washington family, it merits especial mention.
