5000|$|According to the Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 6 DVD set the {{subtitles}} {{for that}} scene read, [...] "The dirty fox!", despite that [...] "The dirty fuck!" [...] can clearly be heard. Fans have theorized that {{the inclusion of}} a really nasty curse word was most likely a parting shot by Harman <b>and</b> Ising to <b>Warner</b> Bros. animation head Leon Schlesinger, with whom they disputed over various matters, though this seems unlikely as both Schlesinger <b>and</b> <b>Warners</b> would have reviewed the cartoon prior to release and edited out the offending line (unless both Schlesinger <b>and</b> <b>Warners</b> misheard the line as [...] "The dirty fox!", which is most likely what happened in this case, after the recent revelation).|$|R
5|$|Warner was an {{aspiring}} bluegrass musician (which was unusual in Australia) after {{learning of the}} music from his father, an early Australian bluegrass pioneer. The winner of the Australian National Bluegrass Mandolin Championship for four consecutive years, Warner had toured with country music artists including Gina Jeffreys, and with Young in Kasey Chambers's band. Young <b>and</b> <b>Warner</b> knew each other previously, and according to Warner, had been drawn to bluegrass and American roots music through an appreciation of George Jones and Merle Haggard. Warner and Young {{made the decision to}} emigrate to America to pursue musical careers in that country, after they met. Young <b>and</b> <b>Warner</b> later lived together in Sydney while trying to find work in the moribund Australian bluegrass scene. After leaving Australia, they spent time in West Texas before relocating to Austin.|$|E

The forest's rivers support populations of trout, and the lakes contain fish such as the largemouth bass. The forest is inhabited by avian species such as mallards, American bald eagles, Canada geese, and whistling swans. Peregrine falcons <b>and</b> <b>Warner</b> suckers also infrequently enter its boundaries.|$|E
5|$|After {{negotiations}} with Mančevski fell through, Mark Rydell was contracted {{to direct the}} biopic in February 1996. Rydell was also close friends with Dean; the two studied together at Actors Studio in Manhattan, New York during the early 1950s. DiCaprio {{dropped out of the}} lead role entirely when his asking price was determined to be too high after the actor's success with Romeo + Juliet (1996) and Titanic (1997). Meanwhile, Rydell worked with Horovitz on another rewrite, <b>and</b> <b>Warner</b> Bros. planned to fast track production. Don Was was hired to write and compose the film score, but he was later replaced by John Frizzell. Shortly after Rydell's hiring, Stephen Dorff entered discussions to portray James Dean. Ethan Hawke would later turn down the role.|$|E

Penguin Putnam wanted to delay publishing the novel in order to release it concurrent with the anticipated film release. Warner Bros. hired Monahan to write the screenplay adaptation of Light House.|$|E
5|$|After {{the success}} of the films and books, Universal <b>and</b> <b>Warner</b> Brothers {{announced}} they would create The Wizarding World of Harry Potter, a new Harry Potter-themed expansion to the Islands of Adventure theme park at Universal Orlando Resort in Florida.

5|$|Although the 1915 {{season was}} a success, the next year's team {{was one of}} the {{greatest}} of Warner's career. The Panthers were again undefeated and, like the previous year, six of the eight games were shutouts. Thirty-two of their 35 players were from Western Pennsylvania, near Pittsburgh. The team scored 255 points, conceding 25. Warner considered the team an improvement because its defense was more dominant than the previous year's. The Panthers were the consensus national champions, <b>and</b> <b>Warner</b> became recognized as one of football's greatest coaches.|$|E
