The classifier classifies data according to the fuzzy membership values of the reference set inside the prespecified radius β.

The successful classification by the classifier depends on the parameters β and on the selected prototypes to the reference set.

40|$|Abstract: To improve {{recognition}} results, {{decisions of}} multiple neural networks can be aggregated into a committee decision. In {{contrast to the}} ordinary approach of utilising all neural networks available to make a committee decision, we propose creating adaptive committees, which are specific for each input data point. A prediction network is used to identify classification neural networks to be fused for making a committee decision about a given input data point. The j th output value of the prediction network expresses the expectation level that the j th classification neural network will make a correct decision about the class label of a given input data point. The proposed technique is tested in three aggregation schemes, namely majority vote, averaging, and aggregation by the median rule and compared with the ordinary neural networks fusion approach. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated on three well known real data sets and also applied to fault identification of the <b>actuator</b> <b>valve</b> at one sugar factory within the DAMADICS RTN...|$|E

A simulation environment is developed that emulates the building thermal dynamics assuming parameters identified through experimental testing. Multiple testing scenarios are considered where the inter-room dynamics are physically altered between tests (by opening and closing windows and doors).

Electro-Hydraulic <b>valve</b> <b>actuators</b> are used to eliminate the camshaft of an existing Internal Combustion(IC) engine and to control the valve timing of intake and exhaust valves, valve duration independently. This paper presents a research activity like hydraulic <b>valve</b> <b>actuator</b> design, dynamic simulations, analysis and adaptive valve timing control of Camless Engine <b>Valve</b> <b>Actuator.</b> Electro-Hydraulic <b>valve</b> <b>actuator’s</b> main function is to provide fully variable open/close valve timing. The Camless Engine <b>Valve</b> <b>Actuator</b> (CEVA) system has been modeled {{by means of a}} powerful hydraulic simulation tool, AMESim, which is useful for the dynamic simulations and analysis of hydraulic systems. The designed model has been validated through comparison with mathematical model and experimental results obtained in a prototype test bench. This research is focused on Adaptive valve timing control of Camless Engine <b>Valve</b> <b>Actuator</b> (CEVA) system. A proposed valve timing control in this paper is used to robustly control opening timing, duration, closing timing regardless of fluid temperature variations without high-cost sensors.

40|$|A bi-layer {{structure}} comprising a thin gold layer and a polypyrrole (PPy) film is {{developed as a}} valve. To create such structures, the thin metal layer {{is used as a}} working electrode, and the polypyrrole film is electrochemically deposited on the metal electrode. A layer of Cr deposited under a stationary part of the bi-layer flap adheres strongly to the gold layer and anchors the hinge of the flap, while the layer of polyimide deposited under a movable part of the flap adheres weakly to the gold layer of the flap. This bi-layer flap structure functions as an <b>actuator</b> <b>valve</b> for the opening and closing of an aperture. The actuation mechanism of the valve is based on a volume change in the PPy layer as cations move {{in and out of the}} polymer film during reduction and oxidation reactions. A bias of 1. 2 V is used to actuate the flap. A method is proposed to increase the drug release system's functionality by placing the drug release flap within a protective enclosure that also serves as a drug reservoir. This integrated protection ensures reliable operation of the drug release flap unencumbered by surrounding tissues when used in vivo. A prototype system using a PDMS drug reservoir has been successfully tested in PBS buffer solution. The proposed integrated protection system holds promise for implantable biomedical devices. close 71...|$|E

The experiments have been conducted in a small-scale combustor followed by a M= 3 nozzle. Two electrodes placed in a supersonic flow downstream of the combustor, with a voltage bias applied to them, {{have been used to}} measure chemi-ionization current in the flow. Results of previous chemi-ionization current and flame emission measurements demonstrated that the current {{can be used as a}} flame indicator. The present experiments show that in lean fuel-oxidizer mixtures, the current is nearly proportional to the equivalence ratio. Chemi-ionization current signal from the combustion product flow have been used for feedback combustion control, to maintain the equivalence ratio in the combustor at the desired level and adjust it, if necessary. In particular, chemi-ionization current was used to control an <b>actuator</b> <b>valve</b> in the fuel delivery line and to vary the fuel mass flow rate. This approach has also been used to counter external perturbations used to deliberately change the equivalence ratio in the combustor. The results suggest that the present method can be used to operate a combustor at fuel lean conditions and to prevent flame extinction by increasing the fuel flow rate before the blow-off occurs. This approach can be used to develop a simple and straightforward combustion control technique...|$|E

If this continues to happen, then it could be considered less effective and less efficient. Overall this tool is divided into three blocks of the system, namely input, processing units, and output. Input consists of infrared sensors with an infrared LED as a signal sender (transmitter) and photransistor as a signal receiver (receiver), processing unit consists of microcontroller AT 89 S 51, and the output consists of relays.
