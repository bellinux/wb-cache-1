5|$|Each {{season of}} the series is played as a nine-episode tournament with six episodes of opening rounds, two semi-finals, and a final. Each opening round starts with three teams of three contestants <b>answering</b> <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> the Bible. The teams then {{nominate}} their strongest contestants to answer questions by themselves without any assistance from their teammates. After {{this part of the}} round, the third-placed team is eliminated and the two highest-scoring teams compete in a final round with the scores being reset to zero. The remaining teams answer as many questions correctly as possible within one minute, and the highest-scoring team from this round wins a $20,000 prize which is given to the team's nominated charity. The winning team then advances to a semi-final game against two other winning teams; the winning team from this game advances to a final game where the grand prize is raised to $100,000. Thus, the team that wins the season-long tournament earns a total of $140,000 for their charity.|$|E

500|$|In mid-2013, a {{relatively}} unknown artist Boots, signed a publishing deal with Jay-Z's Roc Nation. In {{an interview for}} Pitchfork after the album's release, Boots was coy when <b>answering</b> <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> how Beyoncé discovered his demo or of his work previous to the project, only confirming his signing. In June 2013, they met in person {{for the first time}} and Boots presented Beyoncé with material he felt would resonate with her. However, Beyoncé was more interested in his experimental material, and he reluctantly played her his song [...] "Haunted" [...] on his cellphone. She refused to ignore its potential. At a later meeting, he played her a stream of consciousness rap called [...] "Ghost", which he wrote after an exasperating meeting with a potential record label. Boots began by composing a melody that reminded him of a hypnotic state, then layering guitar arpeggios to resemble the work of English electronic musician Aphex Twin. Subsequently, [...] "Ghost" [...] became the first half of [...] "Haunted"; he later described Beyoncé as the [...] "only visionary in the room" [...] for her ability to find potential in scraps of songs. Following these sessions, Boots would go on to work on eighty percent of Beyoncé.|$|E
500|$|Miliband {{paid tribute}} to Lamont shortly after she {{announced}} that she intended to relinquish the leadership role, saying she had [...] "led the Scottish Labour Party with determination". McLeish and McConnell both indicated that Lamont's sudden departure following weeks of speculation could have implications for Miliband's leadership. McLeish said that Miliband's chance of becoming Prime Minister could be affected if Labour returned fewer Scottish MPs in 2015, something he called a problem of “historic, epic proportions”, while McConnell {{said that he was}} [...] "very, very angry" [...] and suggested Miliband had questions to answer about the circumstances surrounding the resignation. Salmond echoed the views of his predecessor, arguing that Miliband [...] "should be <b>answering</b> <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> why Labour in Scotland is run as an extension of his Westminster office, and why he has effectively forced the resignation of a Labour leader in Scotland." [...] Ed Balls, the Shadow Chancellor, rejected Lamont's claims about UK Labour's treatment of its Scottish counterpart. Ian Davidson claimed that supporters of Murphy, who subsequently announced his intention to stand in the leadership contest to succeed Lamont, had conducted a whispering campaign against her. He further suggested that those on the right of the party had resented her election as leader and ignored her, treating her as a [...] "wee lassie".|$|E

[...] One author suggests a common question adoptive parents have is: [...] "Will we love the child even though he/she is not our biological child?" [...] A specific concern for many parents is accommodating an adoptee in the classroom. Familiar lessons like [...] "draw your family tree" [...] or [...] "trace your eye color back through your parents and grandparents to see where your genes come from" [...] could be hurtful to children who were adopted and do not know this biological information. Numerous suggestions have been made to substitute new lessons, e.g., focusing on [...] "family orchards." ...|$|E
2500|$|Much of {{the study}} of the history of science has been devoted to <b>answering</b> <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> what science is, how it functions, and whether it {{exhibits}} large-scale patterns and trends. The sociology of science in particular has focused on the ways in which scientists work, looking closely at {{the ways in which they}} [...] "produce" [...] and [...] "construct" [...] scientific knowledge. Since the 1960s, a common trend in science studies (the study of the sociology and history of science) has been to emphasize the [...] "human component" [...] of scientific knowledge, and to de-emphasize the view that scientific data are self-evident, value-free, and context-free. [...] The field of Science and Technology Studies, an area that overlaps and often informs historical studies of science, focuses on the social context of science in both contemporary and historical periods.|$|E
2500|$|While she {{was helping}} at the British Museum in 1950, where the Greek and Roman {{department}} had suffered severe bomb damage, she met Denys Haynes (1913-1994), later Keeper of Greek and Roman Antiquities, whom she married in January 1951. She had {{also come to}} know the previous Keeper, Bernard Ashmole, who offered her a voluntary position in the department where her work included <b>answering</b> <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> Etruscan subjects and handling correspondence in German and Italian.

In 1985 she published Etruscan Bronzes, an Etruscan novel called The Augur's Daughter in 1987 (first published in German in 1981) and Etruscan Civilization in 2000 (and an enlarged German edition in 2005). She also published regularly in international journals and was made a foreign member of the Istituto di Studi Etruschi ed Italici in 1965.

After Kat is robbed, Stacey discovers that Kat has been overdosing on Tommy's medicine. Kat admits to drinking the medicine to numb out her thoughts about Harry, but promises to stop. When Stacey tells Mo that the money would not be good for Kat, Mo has a change of heart and has Harry's money transferred to her own account. Kat later finds out about this, and then, after burning the money, falls into a depression and tries to kill herself. Alfie finds her and calls an ambulance, at the hospital he admits that he is still in love with her.
