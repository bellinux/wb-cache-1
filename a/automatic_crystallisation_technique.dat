40|$|X-ray {{crystallography}} is {{the most}} powerful technique for structural determination of proteins, a vital research tool, enabling insight at the atomic level, of the three dimensional structure of key protein receptors for potential drug compounds. To be successful, single, high quality crystals of the compound in question are required. Current methods to produce crystals involve frustratingly long timescales, extensive trial and error using large amounts of material, and have no guarantee of success. Polymorphic compounds add another level of frustration, requiring the thermodynamic control of crystallisation in order to overcome Ostwald’s rule of stages, which considers crystallisation from bulk solution to be under kinetic control with metastable polymorphs often crystallising initially. These factors have led to what is currently referred to as the “bottle-neck” of protein crystallisation, an acute problem motivating the rapid development of protein <b>crystallisation</b> <b>techniques.</b> This thesis aims to alleviate the bottle-neck found in protein crystallisation by exploring protein crystallisation using microemulsions; a technique, which until now, has only been successfully applied to the thermodynamic control of crystallisation for small compounds, such as 5 -methyl- 2 -[(2 -nitrophenyl) amino]- 3 -thiophenecarbonitrile (commonly known as ROY) and glycine. Through the application of several different surfactant systems for the crystallisation of model protein, Lysozyme, this thesis explores the use of microemulsions with the aim of producing high quality single crystals suitable for X-ray diffraction experiments. Numerous, large, high quality, single crystals of Lysozyme were successfully grown using a TritonX- 100 / 1 -hexanol surfactant system in which an anti-solvent, mixed microemulsion method was applied. Small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) was effectively used to confirm formation of microemulsions and led to the determination of droplet sizes using generalised indirect Fourier Transform (GIFT) analysis. X-ray diffraction experiments showed single crystals grown from microemulsions to have a high internal order, with the resultant data sets of a publishable quality and of a comparative quality to data sets collected from crystals grown using standard vapour diffusion <b>crystallisation</b> <b>techniques.</b> This thesis demonstrates, for the first time, that microemulsions can be successfully used to produce high quality, single crystals of the protein, Lysozyme, shining light on this novel technique as a potential means of relieving the bottle-neck of protein crystallisation. Future directions of this work include exploring the robustness of the microemulsion <b>crystallisation</b> <b>technique</b> with other proteins such as insulin, glucose isomerase and albumin. Expanding this novel <b>technique</b> to the <b>crystallisation</b> of membrane proteins may be initially explored through the crystallisation of a 25 residue, membrane spanning part of the M 2 protein of the influenza virus. This would provide an interesting starting point due to the proteins’ biological importance as a target of anti-influenza drugs. ...|$|R

In comparison to commercial lactose, engineered lactose particles exhibited less elongated and more irregular shape (large aggregates composed of smaller sub-units), rougher surface texture, higher specific surface area, and different anomer form. Engineered lactose powders demonstrated smaller bulk density, smaller tap density, and higher porosity than commercial lactose powder. Dry powder inhaler (DPI) formulations containing engineered lactose and salbutamol sulphate {{as a model}} drug demonstrated improved drug content homogeneity and higher amounts of drug delivered to lower airway regions. Higher fine particle fraction of drug was obtained {{in the case of}} lactose powders with higher porosity, higher specific surface area and higher fine particle content (< 5 μm). The results indicated that the higher the saturation degree of lactose solution used during crystallisation the smaller the specific surface area, the higher the amorphous lactose content, and the higher the β-lactose content of engineered lactose particles. Also, lactose powders obtained from lactose solution with higher degree of saturation showed higher bulk and tap densities and smaller porosity. Engineered lactose powders crystallized from lower saturation degree (20 % and 30 % w/v) deposited higher amounts of drug on lower airway regions.

40|$|Crystallisation, one of {{the oldest}} unit operations, is of major {{economic}} importance in the hydrometallurgical industry for the separation and/or production of inorganic metal compounds in the form of good quality crystals, both in terms of purity and size. However, industrial <b>crystallisation</b> <b>techniques</b> usually have high energy requirements (e. g. evaporative crystallisation) and the residual solutions are often extremely corrosive, resulting in elevated operating and maintenance costs. Additionally, the majority of industrial crystallisation methods do not render to the appropriate supersaturation control, therefore the produced salts are agglomerates of fine crystallites with heavy solution entrainment and contamination. In this work, the Solvent Displacement <b>Crystallisation</b> (SDC) <b>technique</b> is investigated as an attractive alternative to the conventional crystallisation methods. SDC involves the addition of low-boiling point, water-miscible organic solvents (MOS) to aqueous solutions to cause salt precipitation based on the salting out effect. The crystals are separated by filtration whereas the solvent is subsequently recovered for reuse by low-temperature distillation. The present work was initiated with the main objective to develop a solid scientific understanding of the SDC process and propose specific applications to hydrometallurgical systems of practical interest. Criteria for the selection of organic solvents with suitable physical and chemical properties have been established and various compounds screened to determine their amenability to SDC; 2 -propanol was selected as an effective salting out agent to cause precipitation of most metallic sulphates of practical interest from acidic solutions and opted for use in further studies. Differences in crystallisation behaviour among the various metal sulphates were attributed to differences in hydration energy (the energy required for a hydrated ion to be separated from its bound water). N{{one of the}} tested metal chlorides could be successfully separated from HCl-H 2 O system with 2 -propanol. This was explained in terms of enhanced metal chlorides solubilities in non-aqueous solvents relative to water by formation of chloro-complexes of larger stability constants.

40|$|Photosynthesis is the {{procedure}} of light capture and converting {{it into a}} chemical energy source for the cell. The work-horse of this process are photosynthetic reaction centres, which capture photons {{with the help of}} their antenna complexes and use these photons to drive charge separation reactions, and ultimately chemiosmotic coupling. It is twenty five years since the first structure of the bacterial photosynthetic reaction centre from Blastochloris viridis was solved, which also earned the Noble prize in chemistry. In this thesis we aimed to perform time-resolved Laue diffraction studies of photosynthetic reaction centres. Numerous technical challenges presented themselves. First and foremost, excellent quality crystals were essential. Thus, we investigated the crystallisation process of the Rhodobacter sphaeroides bacterial reaction centre and discovered that these crystals grew from a lipidic-sponge phase, rather than a lipidic cubic phase as thought. From here we developed a screen for lipidic-sponge phase crystallisation potentially applicable to any membrane protein. The major advantage of this novel <b>crystallisation</b> <b>technique</b> is the implementation of a liquid lipid phase that allows the application of a hanging-drop vapour diffusion experiment. Crystals of the reaction centre from Bl. viridis thus obtained were optimised, and a structure to 1. 95 Å resolution determined. From this structure we observed an ancient memory of a putative enzymatic activity in ubiquinone biosynthesis. Finally, time-resolved Laue diffraction experiments on both the R. sphaeroides and Bl. viridis crystals were tried, with the latter being more successful. We observed that 3 ms following photo-activation at room temperature, a tyrosin (Tyr 162) of Bl. viridis undergoes a 1. 05 Å movement towards the special pair.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a detailed study {{into the role}} of surface chemistry in the high shear granulation of organic pharmaceutical solids. Crystalline materials with markedly different surface chemistries were selected as model compounds which were granulated with a polymeric binder. The surface wettability of primary powders was evaluated by employing the sessile drop contact angle measurements to evaluate the facet-specific surface energetics of macroscopic crystals, obtained via a solvent-mediated or a temperature-controlled <b>crystallisation</b> <b>technique.</b> A novel methodology using inverse gas chromatography (IGC) at finite concentrations (FC) was developed to evaluate surface energy distributions of the powder samples. The surface energetics of organic macroscopic crystals was found to be facet-specific, consistent with the local surface chemistry of the facet under examination. The rank order of hydrophilicity of specific facet was in good agreement with concentration of hydroxyl groups determined from X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. IGC-FC was applied to measure [gamma]d/SV profile, which were in good agreement with the [gamma]d/SV values measured from contact angle on the corresponding single crystals. This technique was shown to be able to distinguish surface energy heterogeneity, homogeneity as well as subtle changes in the [gamma]d/SV distributions, due to variations in the crystal habits. The wettability of the model compounds was ranked based on the contact angle polarity and IGC surface energy heterogeneity distributions, and the spreadability of binder solution was assessed based on the thermodynamic spreading coefficients. The increase in surface wettability led to the increase in granule mean size and granule strength. Formulations with similar wetting behaviour resulted in similar granule size, whilst those formulations with dissimilar surface wettability were found to exhibit substantially different granulation behaviour. In conclusion, the materials surface chemistry plays a crucial role in granulation processes. Its thorough characterisation and understanding may lead to more controllable product attributes and improved final performances.

2500|$|Businesses, and {{the banks}} who had {{previously}} enjoyed uncompromised priority for their security, increasingly looked for ways to circumvent {{the effect of the}} insolvency legislation's scheme of priorities. A floating charge, in order for its value to be ascertained, must have [...] "crystallised" [...] into a fixed charge on some particular date, usually set by agreement. Before the date of crystallisation (given the charge merely [...] "floats" [...] over no particular property) there is the possibility that a company could both charge out property to creditors with priority, or that other creditors could set-off claims against property subject to the (uncrystallised) floating charge. Furthermore, other security interests (such as a contractual lien) will take priority to a crystallised floating charge if it arises before in time. But after crystallisation, assets received by the company can be caught by the charge. One way for companies to gain priority with floating charges originally was to stipulate in the charge agreement that the charge would convert from [...] "floating" [...] to [...] "fixed" [...] automatically on some event before the date of insolvency. According to the default rules at common law, floating charges impliedly crystallise when a receiver is appointed, if a business ceases or is sold, if a company is would up, or if {{under the terms of the}} debenture provision is made for crystallisation on reasonable notice from the charge holder. However an <b>automatic</b> <b>crystallisation</b> clause would mean that at the time of insolvency - when preferential creditors' claims are determined - there would be no floating charge above which preferential creditors could be elevated. The courts held that it was legitimate for security agreements to have this effect. In Re Brightlife Ltd Brightlife Ltd had contracted with its bank, Norandex, to allow a floating charge to be converted to a fixed charge on notice, and this was done one week before a voluntary winding up resolution. Against the argument that public policy should restrict the events allowing for crystallisation, Hoffmann J held that in his view it was not [...] "open to the courts to restrict the contractual freedom of parties to a floating charge on such grounds." [...] Parliament, however, intervened to state in the Insolvency Act 1986 section 251 that if a charge was created as a floating charge, it would deem to remain a floating charge at the point of insolvency, regardless of whether it had crystallised.|$|R

For this reason, knowledge on the rheological properties and crystallisation behaviour of filling fat is crucial. Two filling fats, which mainly differ in POP (1, 3 -dipalmitoyl- 2 -oleoyl-glycerol) and SOS (1, 3 -distearoyl- 2 -oleoyl-glycerol) triacylglycerol compositions, were used in this study. Rheological properties of the two filling fats, namely Creamelt 601 and Creamelt 701, were first studied using oscillatory rheology under static and slow cooling conditions to obtain genuine information about the crystallisation behaviour in which a viscoelastic system was evident for both filling fats. Oscillatory rheology was also used to simulate certain manufacturing conditions in which the filling fats are used to show the effects of processing conditions on the crystallisation behaviour of the filling fats. Application of shear during the cooling process at high and low temperatures indicated an enhancement of the crystallisation process and damage to the crystal aggregates respectively. Nevertheless, there was no evidence of a significant impact of the point at which shear was applied on the final rheological properties. The viscoelastic properties of the filling fats at every step of the processing conditions were assessed using an oscillation frequency sweep. Development of a weak crystal network was shown by a reduced frequency-dependent profile as soon as the filling fats reached the first crystallisation temperature. Similarly, the application of shear at higher temperatures showed enhancement of the crystallisation process by secondary nucleation and rearrangement of the crystal network whereas at lower temperatures, shear application may result in destruction of the network. In addition, other <b>crystallisation</b> <b>techniques</b> of analysis such as x-ray diffraction (XRD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and polarised light microscopy (PLM) were also used to study the crystallisation behaviour of the filling fats...|$|R
40|$|Arsenic {{disposal}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} important environmental issues the mining and metallurgical industries are faced with. This problem has worsened in recent years because of the increasing arsenic content of the low-grade and complex ores currently processed by the mining industry and the introduction of stricter environmental regulations. This Ph. D. thesis sought to develop a novel concept for arsenic fixation suitable for the long-term safe disposal of arsenic generated and disposed by the minerals industry. In particular this research project investigates the encapsulation of scorodite, a well characterized Fe(III) -As(V) compound having the following formula FeAsO 4 · 2 H 2 O, with phosphate coatings, materials potentially not prone to reductive decomposition. Reductive decomposition is known to be responsible for the release of arsenic into the environment form arsenate solids such as scorodite. The subject matter of this thesis is the application of heterogeneous <b>crystallisation</b> <b>techniques</b> to produce stable phosphate coatings on scorodite particles. The experimental work reported in this thesis involved three different types of studies, namely (1) production of a number of synthetic minerals; (2) evaluation of their stability; and (3) encapsulation of scorodite with two of these synthetic minerals. The synthesis work involved the production of aluminium and calcium phosphates via homogeneous, heterogeneous and seeded crystallisation. The stability work involved the study of the dissolution of hydrated aluminium phosphate (AlPO 4 · 1. 5 H 2 O), dicalcium phosphate dihydrate (CaHPO 4 · 2 H 2 O), and calcium-deficient hydroxyapatite (Ca 10 -x(HPO 4) x(PO 4) 6 - x(OH) 2 -x, x < 2). Finally, the encapsulation work involved the deposition of hydrated aluminium phosphate and calcium-deficient hydroxyapatite on scorodite particles and the evaluation of their stability in simulated oxic and anoxic environments. The directed deposition of phosphate on scorodite particles was achieved via the control of supersaturation. For the directed deposition of aluminium phosphate, the supersaturation was controlled via pH adjustment. On the other hand, for the controlled deposition of calcium-deficient hydroxyapatite on scorodite particles supersaturation was controlled via regulated mixing of two Ca(II) and P(V) solutions at constant pH. Both encapsulation techniques appeared to enhance scorodite stability under simulated oxic and anoxic environments by reducing the arsenic release rate up to one order of magnitude...|$|R
2500|$|Especially as <b>automatic</b> <b>crystallisation</b> {{ceased to}} make {{floating}} charges an effective form of priority, {{the next step}} by businesses was to contract for fixed charges over every available specific asset, and then take a floating charge over the remainder. It attempted to do this as well over book debts that a company would collect and trade with. In two early cases the courts approved this practice. In Siebe Gorman & Co Ltd v Barclays Bank Ltd it {{was said to be}} done with a stipulation that the charge was [...] "fixed" [...] and the requirement that proceeds be paid into an account held with the lending bank. In Re New Bullas Trading Ltd the Court of Appeal said that a charge could purport to be fixed over uncollected debts, but floating over the proceeds that were collected from the bank's designated account. However the courts overturned these decisions in two leading cases. In Re Brumark Investments Ltd the Privy Council advised that a charge in favour of Westpac bank that purported to separate uncollected debts (where a charge was said to be fixed) and the proceeds (where the charge was said to be floating) could not be deemed separable: the distinction made no commercial sense because the only value in uncollected debts are the proceeds, and so the charge would have to be the same over both. In Re Spectrum Plus Ltd, the House of Lords finally decided that because the hallmark of a floating charge is that a company is free to deal with the charged assets in the ordinary course of business, any charge purported to be [...] "fixed" [...] over book debts kept in any account except one which a bank restricts the use of, must be in substance a floating charge. Lord Scott emphasised that this definition [...] "reflects the mischief that the statutory intervention... was intended to meet and should ensure that preferential creditors continue to enjoy the priority that section 175 of the 1986 Act and its statutory predecessors intended them to have." [...] The decision in Re Spectrum Plus Ltd created a new debate. On the one hand, John Armour argued in response that all categories of preferential would be better off abolished, because in his view businesses would merely be able to contract around the law (even after Re Spectrum Plus Ltd) by arranging loan agreements that have the same effect as security but not in a form caught by the law (giving the examples of invoice discounting or factoring). On the other hand, Roy Goode and Riz Mokal have called for the floating charge simply to be abandoned altogether, {{in the same way as}} was recommended by the Minority of the Loreburn Report in 1906.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a detailed study into the thermodynamic stability and dehydration kinetics {{of a model}} pharmaceutical channel hydrate: carbamazepine dihydrate. The model compound of different crystal habits and particle size distributions was prepared via solventmediated <b>crystallisation</b> <b>technique</b> and agitated hydration method. The causal relationship between key drying process parameters (i. e. temperature, pressure, relative humidity and organic solvent partial pressure) and dehydration behaviour of this model compound was established using Dynamic Vapour Sorption instruments. Solid state phase transformation mechanisms under these drying conditions were elucidated through the evolution of crystal structural determined by X-ray Powder Diffraction technique. Dehydration kinetics of carbamazepine dihydrate {{were found to be}} markedly influenced by increasing temperature, reducing pressure, low humidity and higher organic solvent partial pressure, providing that the drying environment stays below the critical humidity and partial pressure for the dihydrate and acetone solvate formations. Activation energy determined from the kinetic study allows differentiation between the physically bound water in the bulk and water of crystallisation. Agglomerated dihydrate however possessed a high free water retention capacity when it exceeded a certain particle size distribution. This type of agglomerate exhibited distinct closed structure characteristics, leading to a relatively more stable form of carbamazepine dihydrate, than those without inclusion of unbound water. The agglomeration effect can thus be potentially controlled and exploited to expand the environmental stability envelope of the desired hydrated forms during manufacturing processes. Subtle changes in the drying environment were able to induce polymorphic anhydrates of different stabilities. The solid state phase transformation pathway of carbamazepine dihydrate to the four polymorphic anhydrates and an amorphous form was strongly correlated to types of dehydration mechanism, and specifically to the accessibility of and interaction with surrounding solvent vapours (i. e. hydrogen bonding propensity). Alkanol solvent vapourmediated dehydration process was found to facilitate the formation of the thermodynamically stable anhydrate, without any loss in product crystallinity. Dipolar aprotic solvents however induced the (intermediate) formation of least metastable anhydrate, depending on the local chemical environment of solute-solvent system. In conclusion, the surrounding solvent vapour plays a crucial role in drying strategies for a channel type hydrate, as it provides potential to predict and tailor the polymorphism of the desired forms which could have profound implications on the quality and performance of the final product.

It is well known that DMAN will readily protonate – forming the DMANH+ – leaving the second molecule in a DMAN complex negatively charged. In addition to the preparation of materials by <b>crystallisation</b> <b>techniques,</b> full characterisation was carried out using X-ray diffraction of the single crystal samples obtained. Neutron diffraction was also carried out on some of the samples for which the hydrogen atom information was most important to obtain, though this was restricted by the amount of beamtime available on the central facilities used. Several families of DMAN complexes were studied, including DMAN : benzoic acid (chapter 4), DMAN with a wide series of halo-substituted benzoic acids (Chapter 4), DMAN with hydroxyl-, nitro- and methyl- substituted benzoic acids (Chapter 5), and its complexes with a selection of other organic acids (Chapter 6). Several general patterns are found in this work, including the following: • The DMAN is usually protonated (DMANH+), with the hydrogen atom held in a short N−H···N intramolecular hydrogen bond, as observed previously; • The carboxylic acids tend to form dimers, but with a carboxyl and a deprotonated carboxylate group involved, these DIMER− units are formed through a single, very short, strong, charge-assisted O−H···O hydrogen bond; • a wide range of C−H···O and C−H···π weaker hydrogen bonds are present, together with consistent stacking of the DMAN rings, including π···π interactions, but with additional stacking at a range of interplanar distances; • the overall packing in several complexes includes chains or sheets of DIMER− units with DMANH+ included in pockets in the structure. There are some exceptions to these patterns, for example: • varying stoichiometry, resulting in the first example of the occurrence of both protonated (DMANH+) and unprotonated DMAN in a single complex • the inclusion of solvent water in some hydrated complex, which interrupts some of the patterns of intermolecular interactions In addition to the studies of DMAN, a ternary hydrogen bonded complex was studied using X-ray and neutron diffraction and the new molecular porous material 4 -phenoxyphenol, containing a range of solvents, was fully characterised using these diffraction techniques as well as the thermal methods TGA and DSC.

In order to better understand the cellular role and mechanism of action of these proteins, I carried out structural and functional studies on two different systems: the archaeal MCM proteins, that forms a homomeric ring representing a simplified model of the eukaryotic complex, and the less well studied human MCM 8, whose exact role in eukaryotic cells has not been elucidated. MCM interacts in two ways with the DNA: the canonical "loaded" mode where the MCM protein is encircling the DNA, and a "associated" mode where the DNA is wrapped around the enzyme. Using the protein from the archaeon Methanothermobacter thermautotrophicum, I biochemically shown that binding of MCM proteins affect the degree of supercoiling of dsDNA and that subdomain A is crucial for this interaction. To determine the structure of the C-terminal domain of the MCM proteins, the less studied region, I produced three different constructs corresponding to the C terminus of the MCM proteins from M. thermoautotrophicum and Sulfolobus solfataricus. Despite a large effort using “high throughput” <b>crystallisation</b> <b>techniques,</b> no well diffracting crystals could be reproducibly obtained. An alternative structural biology approach has been adopted, using NMR analysis. Preliminary data are compatible with the bioinformatics prediction of a winged helix domain, but further work on isotope-labelled proteins is necessary for a full 3 D characterisation. Two other MCM proteins have been more recently described (MCM 8 and MCM 9) : they are present in a variety of eukaryotic organisms, do not interact with the MCM 2 - 7 complex and their function in the cell is still unknown. These protein are co-evolutionary related and it is conceivable that they have a functional link. I cloned and expressed in E. coli cells a large number of hMCM 8 fragments: two of them (the N-terminus and the AAA+ domain) can be successfully expressed in soluble form and have been purified and used for biochemical assays. Both proteins forms dimers, bind ssDNA and the AAA+ catalytic domain displays ATPase activity. Further effort will be done to optimise the purification protocol to obtain proteins suitable for structural studies. In order to assess the hypothesis of a functional relationship between MCM 8 and MCM 9 proteins, a similarly extensive cloning strategy was applied to human MCM 9, with the aim of obtaining constructs expressing a variety of fragments, to be co-expressed with the equivalent hMCM 8 domains, and to test the formation of functional complexes...|$|R

For directors of a company... little or no personal discredit falls upon them if their company fails to pay a dividend to its trade creditors. It is, therefore, {{all the more important}} that the amount and manner of borrowing by a corporation should be upon a satisfactory basis... We do not consider that a company should have any greater facility for borrowing than an individual, and we think that while a company should have unrestricted power to mortgage or charge its fixed assets and should be allowed to contract that other fixed assets substituted for those charged should become subject to the charge, and the company should also be capable of charging existing chattels and book debtsor other things in action, it ought to be rendered incapable of charging after acquired chattels, or future book debts, or other property not in existence {{at the time of the}} creation of the charge.’ Minority of the Loreburn Committee, Report of the Company Law Amendment Committee (1906) Cd 3052, 28 Especially as <b>automatic</b> <b>crystallisation</b> ceased to make floating charges an effective form of priority, the next step by businesses was to contract for fixed charges over every available specific asset, and then take a floating charge over the remainder. It attempted to do this as well over book debts that a company would collect and trade with. In two early cases the courts approved this practice. In Siebe Gorman & Co Ltd v Barclays Bank Ltd it was said to be done with a stipulation that the charge was [...] "fixed" [...] and the requirement that proceeds be paid into an account held with the lending bank. In Re New Bullas Trading Ltd the Court of Appeal said that a charge could purport to be fixed over uncollected debts, but floating over the proceeds that were collected from the bank's designated account. However the courts overturned these decisions in two leading cases. In Re Brumark Investments Ltd the Privy Council advised that a charge in favour of Westpac bank that purported to separate uncollected debts (where a charge was said to be fixed) and the proceeds (where the charge was said to be floating) could not be deemed separable: the distinction made no commercial sense because the only value in uncollected debts are the proceeds, and so the charge would have to be the same over both. In Re Spectrum Plus Ltd, the House of Lords finally decided that because the hallmark of a floating charge is that a company is free to deal with the charged assets in the ordinary course of business, any charge purported to be [...] "fixed" [...] over book debts kept in any account except one which a bank restricts the use of, must be in substance a floating charge. Lord Scott emphasised that this definition [...] "reflects the mischief that the statutory intervention... was intended to meet and should ensure that preferential creditors continue to enjoy the priority that section 175 of the 1986 Act and its statutory predecessors intended them to have." [...] The decision in Re Spectrum Plus Ltd created a new debate. On the one hand, John Armour argued in response that all categories of preferential would be better off abolished, because in his view businesses would merely be able to contract around the law (even after Re Spectrum Plus Ltd) by arranging loan agreements that have the same effect as security but not in a form caught by the law (giving the examples of invoice discounting or factoring). On the other hand, Roy Goode and Riz Mokal have called for the floating charge simply to be abandoned altogether, in the same way as was recommended by the Minority of the Loreburn Report in 1906.|$|R

40|$|Fermentation {{products}} are gaining more {{attention in the}} last years {{due to the fact that}} the metabolic and genetic engineering field has been developing techniques to enhance fermentation yields and make biochemical processes competitive compared to traditional chemical production. However, as fermentation productivities are becoming higher, many fermentation processes suffer from product inhibition and/or toxicity. Moreover, besides the inhibition/toxicity problem, the complexity of the fermentation media makes the process recovery an important step in the development of the whole production process. In this thesis, product recovery applying <b>crystallisation</b> <b>techniques</b> was studied for two organic acids: fumaric acid and 7 aminodeacetoxycephalosporanic acid (7 -ADCA). In the case of fumaric acid one of the main problems of the conventional fermentation is that it is carried out at a pH in the range of 4. 5 – 6. 5, leading to fumarate salts instead of undissociated fumaric acid. Stoichiometric amounts of bases such as NaOH and CaCO 3 are added during fermentation to control the pH. To recover fumaric acid, the supernatant has to be acidified, for example with stoichiometric amounts of sulphuric acid, so that undissociated fumaric acid can precipitate. Stoichiometric amounts of waste salts such as sodium or calcium sulphate are formed in this manner. A similar problem is present in the 7 -ADCA production. Here the fermentation and deacylation are working in a pH range of 6. 0 – 8. 0 while the crystallisation recovery needs to be at pH 4. 0. This implies the addition of mineral acids to decrease the pH, and hence waste salts are produced. To overcome these problems, we integrated fermentation and cooling crystallisation to recover the product. At lower temperature the fermentation product should become partly insoluble, so that it can be filtered off, thus avoiding acidification and waste salts production. In this thesis Chapter 1 presents general aspects of the In-Situ Product Recovery (ISPR) techniques and their development as process integration tools. Additionally, a general overview of the fumaric acid and 7 -ADCA systems is presented to show the concept that is developed in this research. Chapters 2 - 5 deal with the fumaric acid system and chapter 6 with the 7 -ACDA system. Chapter 2 reviews the production of fumaric acid by fermentation. Here the metabolism of Rhizopus oryzae (the strain used in this study for fumaric acid production) and the importance of CO 2 fixation in this mechanism are described. Future options for improvement in the fermentation and recovery are also discussed here. Fermentation development for low pH values is presented in Chapter 3. This chapter shows that delay of pH control during the fermentation until a low pH has been reached at the end of the batch cycle does not affect fermentation productivities and allows the fermentation unit to be integrated with product crystallisation without pH shifting. Nonetheless, because it is very important to understand the conditions leading to crystallisation of fumaric acid or its sodium salts, the solubility behaviour of fumaric acids and its sodium salts are studied and presented in Chapter 4. The findings here showed that the integration should be performed in a pH range of 2. 5 – 3. 5 in order to get only fumaric acid crystals and avoid the crystallisation of one of the sodium fumarate salts. Integration of fumaric acid production by fermentation and cooling crystallisation is proven to work in an experimental set-up that is described in Chapter 5. In this chapter it is also shown that the integration of these two units can be done while avoiding pH shifting. Consumption of neutralising agent is reduced as compared to the base case system, which uses sulphuric acid to precipitate the fumaric acid out of the fermentation broth thus reducing the associated production of waste salts. A perspective of industrial scale-up of the experimental set up is presented, showing that the studied process may become competitive at industrial levels if the some elements in the concept (like lower pH) are improved further. In Chapter 6 the production of 7 -ADCA is investigated. A new integrated process option for ?-lactam nuclei production is proposed, which is an integration of fermentative production and enzymatic deacylation of adipyl- 7 -aminodeacetoxycephalosporanic acid (adADCA) in one reactor, thus producing 7 ADCA directly from glucose. The outcome of this study proves that according to mathematical modelling it is possible to recover 7 -ADCA via cooling crystallisation and in this way the number of downstream steps can be reduced. This new process option avoids the use of mineral acids and bases for pH shifts and leads to a reduction in waste salt production. In Chapter 7 the outlook of this thesis and recommendations for future work are presented. BiotechnologyApplied Science...|$|R
40|$|Internationally about 400000 tons of Chrome {{tanning agents}} are used annually. The {{efficiency}} of {{the present state of}} the art tanning technology would suggest that about 60000 tons of chrome tanning agents remain unutilised during the chrome tanning and might be discharged into the environment. Apart from environmental problems, this costs the industry ninety million dollars worth of valuable chrome tanning agents annually. The research was aimed at minimising the environmental impact of chrome tanning by the improvement of the {{efficiency of the}} classical system through the addition of auxiliary chemicals during chrome tanning, changing the present technology and by modifying the chrome tanning agent itself. Two different chemicals were synthesised. These were included in a detail study with six other commercial auxiliary chemicals to improve the classical system. Here the possibilities of improving the availability of carboxylic groups for better efficiency of chrome tanning were explored. A considerable improvement, about 90 - 93 % for hides and 95 - 96 % for lamb skins was obtained with these two synthesised chemicals. A novel chrome terming technique for tanning of lamb skins was developed where conventional acid-salt pickling was completely eliminated and tanning conducted after deliming at pH 7 to 8. 5. This novel technique also did not require basification and masking agents for the completion of chrome tanning and saved considerable amount of money for the tanner. This new approach of tanning gave higher exhaustion of chrome to the extent of 96 - 97 % with improved physical properties and yield of leather. The mechanism of the new tanning system was also postulated. Seventy percent of sodium sulphate, one of the pollutants of chrome tanning, was removed from the commercial sulphur dioxide reduced 33 % basic chrome sulphate by <b>crystallisation</b> <b>technique.</b> Attempts were made to separate various species of chrome complexes with HPLC, Gel filtration (Saphadex G 25) and Ion exchange chromatography (SP Saphadex C 25) and finally six species of chrome complexes were separated from the commercial sulphur dioxide reduced 33 % basic chrome sulphate liquor with ion exchange columns (Dowex 50 W x 8 and Dowex IX 8 - 50). It was interesting to find that about 20 % of the commercial basic chrome sulphate were anionic and nonionic complexes. In an attempt to understand their reactivity, separated species of complexes were studied for their ageing and tanning characteristics. This showed {{that as long as the}} pH of the liquor was kept constant, there was no significant change in these complexes due to ageing. Tanning affinity of each of these complexes was studied on pickled lamb skins at three different temperatures, namely 20, 30 and 40 °C. In general, anionic complex had no reactivity and the noniontc species was less reactive at normal tanning pH between 3. 0 and 4. 2. Similar tanning trials with cationic complexes showed that the affinity of these complexes with skin collagen increased progressively with the cationic charge of the complexes up to (Cr) 4 +, and then remained constant for complexes with higher charges than (Cr) 4 +. The reactivity of the combined cationic complexes was studied against standard commercial chrome control on similar pickled and degreased lamb skins. It was found that this combined cationic fraction tanned leather rapidly and more efficiently. The exhaustion of chrome, established through the analysis of chrome in the exhaust chrome liquor with the atomic absorption spectrophotometer, was 95. 11 % against 72. 25 % for the control. The quality of leather obtained was shown to meet the requirements of leather prescribed in the European Commission's guide lines. A polyamide resin was synlhcsised. Initially 0. 75 g to 1. 25 g resin/mole of Cr 2 O 3 was used to modify the 33 % basic chrome sulphate liquor. The ageing characteristics of these complexes were also studied over a six month period. It was clear that the polyamide formed a stable complex with basic chrome sulphate and the ageing did not alter their characteristics significantly. Ion exchange separation (Dowex 50 W x 8) of the chrome-polyamide complex showed that this complex had an ionic distribution closer to phthalate masked basic chrome sulphate. Tanning trials with chrome-polyamide complex on pickled lamb skins and cow hides at low pH like the conventional chrome tanning showed slightly better chrome exhaustion for lamb skin but no significant improvement for side leather. But when lamb skins were tanned according to the newly developed chrome tanning process, a significant improvement in chrome tanning was obtained. The exhaustion of chrome was more than 99 % and leather stood boil within two hours, shortening the chrome tanning process considerably. The quality of leather obtained was shown to meet the requirements of leather prescribed in the European Commission's guide lines The novel process without pickling was tried successfully in the industry. The principle of this no-pickle novel chrome tanning system was extended to the pretanned lamb skins where chrome tanning was successfully carried out at high pH after degreasing without readjusting the pH of the tanning bath with acid to 3. 0 - 3. 5 and tanning completed without basification...|$|R
40|$|The {{structural}} pathway from {{a single}} molecule to clustering through to nucleation during a crystallisation process is not fully understood. As such the solution state structure, nucleation kinetics and phase transformation kinetics of p-Aminobenzoic (PABA) acid are probed {{using a combination of}} in-situ <b>crystallisation</b> characterisation <b>techniques</b> and nucleation kinetic analysis methods. The solubility of alpha PABA is measured in a number of solvents where van’t Hoff analysis shows that solute-solute interactions are probable in all solvents. Solution state FTIR studies reveal the presence of a distribution of solvated monomer and carboxylic acid dimer species in acetonitrile solutions. This provides a link between solution state structural synthons and the carboxylic acid dimer structural synthon of the alpha PABA solid phase. Isothermal nucleation kinetic analysis reveals that calculated interfacial tension, γeff, values are found to be low for an organic material; where γeff values are 0. 85 – 1. 31 mJ/m 2 in ethanol and 2. 36 – 2. 60 mJ/m 2 in water. Due to this the critical cluster sizes are in the region of 0. 48 – 1. 98 nm. Poly-thermal kinetic analysis reveals a nucleation mechanism change from instantaneous to progressive as a function of decreasing solubility in ethanol, acetonitrile and water. This is caused by an increase in attachment frequency due to decreasing de-solvation free energy of PABA found from molecular dynamics simulations, this in combination with increasing γeff causes the thermodynamic component of the nucleation rate to become limiting. Isothermal and poly-thermal X-ray scattering studies of PABA nucleation reveal the formation of large liquid-like clusters of PABA, > 40 nm, in the under-saturated state. These Nano-scale assemblies increase in size and structural ordering, indicated by an increase in fractal dimensionality from 1 – 2 as a function of driving force. The Guinier region of the high q structures is found to increase from Rg = 0. 46 nm to 0. 53 nm which indicates a population of monomers and dimers of PABA in the supersaturated state. This was confirmed as the carboxylic acid dimer structure from form factor fitting of known structural synthons of the alpha phase. In-situ XRD studies of the polymorphic phase transformation of the beta-alpha phase, indicates that the dissolution and growth processes are consistent with zero order nucleation kinetics and first and zero order kinetics respectively with the latter seemingly temperature dependant. UV/Vis analysis in combination with the XRD data reveal the transformation is a dissolution controlled process explained by particle morphology.

40|$|During {{the last}} decade the use of 8162 as gate {{dielectric}} layers in {{complementary metal oxide semiconductor}} (CMOS) microelectronic devices has become increasingly problematic due to leakage resulting from the electron tunnelling with gate oxide thickness approaching 1 nm. Approaches to deal with these problems have focused on increasing the dielectric constant (k) of the material, initially though nitridation of the oxide layer and more recently the application of high-A: materials such as Hf based dielectrics. The work described in this thesis concerns the physical characterisation of thin high-A: multilayered samples using medium energy ion scattering (MEIS). A MEIS computer simulation model was applied and adapted to enable the interpretation of depth profiles from MEIS energy spectra. Forming part of an EU collaborative project, results obtained were compared to those of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and X-ray fluoresence (XRF) to provide a better overall understanding of the characteristics of the layers. Nanometre thin SiC> 2 layers nitrided using a novel plasma nitridation technique were investigated, demonstrated the nitridation of, and yielded the N distributions in the SiC> 2 samples as well as demonstrating plasma damage. An improved k value was found, leading to an increased equivalent oxide (EOT) thickness. Studies of HfO 2 and HfSiOx nanolayers, both with and without subjection to a decoupled plasma nitridation (DPN) process were carried out, characterising the layer structures with an accuracy of 0. 1 nm in excellent agreement with the additional <b>techniques.</b> <b>Crystallisation</b> of the HfO 2 layers, but not of the HfSiOx layers, after DPN was demonstrated.

Layer structures were again determined with sub-nm resolution and diffusion between the Sr and Ti layers was observed after annealing.

40|$|Recent advancements in applied, medical {{materials}} engineering sciences and micro/nano technology have stimulated increasing demand for novel, high quality and precisely-shaped particles. As {{most of the}} materials that are used by these scientific fields are in crystalline forms, {{it is evident that}} crystallization, in particular micro-scale crystallisation is a very useful tool to satisfy this demand. This research charts the investigation and optimisation of micro-scale continuous crystallisation of a fine and commonly used compound, i. e. paracetamol, with attempts to overcome the limitations of such process, for instance to produce particles with narrow particle size distribution and maintain a smooth and continuous operation without microchannel blockage. In this thesis, efforts have been directed to design and test a micro scale continuous crystalliser using two different crystallisation techniques; namely: cooling down of saturated solution and adding antisolvent agent. The former technique was not so successful due to the difficult thermal control of such microfluidic system with available resources, as well as due to the inherent nature of such crystallisation mode, which required long induction time to start <b>crystallisation.</b> The latter <b>technique,</b> on the other hand, was successful due to the short induction time required to drive crystallisation and it does not require any thermal management, as it is performed at ambient temperature. Using the antisolvent technique require very short mixing time to mix the mother liquor with an antisolvent agent to produce supersaturated solution. This was achieved by proposing a novel microfluidic design consisting of baffled microchannel devices operated by superimposing a fully reverse oscillatory flow to facilitate fast non-axial mixing regardless of the very low axial flow rate that is typical to microfluidic devises. Computational fluid dynamics simulations in addition to microfluidic flow visualisation experiments were carried out to examine the non-axial mixing performance for the proposeddesign. Subsequently, the proposed design was tested as a con- tinuous crystalliser and showed very good performances by producing sub-micrometre particles with a very narrow particle size distribution. Finally, the performance of the micro scale continuous crystalliser was optimised to produce particle with minimum particle size using custom design of experiment technique. Results of this optimisation process were successful and produced paracetamol particles having average Z-Ave = 99. 89 nm with standard deviation equivalent to 7. 315 nm.

Blends of Poly(ethylene Terephthalate) with Bisphenol-A-Polycarbonate The objective {{of the study was}} to determine the extent to which bisphenol-Apolycarbonate (PC) influences the rheology, processing behaviour and subsequent crystallinity and mechanical properties of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PETP) in the 'compatible' region, when the polycarbonate is the minor blend component. Also, further characterisation of this blend system, in terms of miscibility and micro- structure development was required. After careful drying in a desiccant-type hopper drier melt-phase, blending was carried out using a twin-screw extruder with a purpose-designed screw configuration. Blends were made up at three levels (PETP/PC); 85 / 15, 80 / 20 and 75 / 25 using three different molecular weights of PC, and virgid-materials were also included in the study. The extrudates were then dried and injection moulding was carried out under various conditions, which were chosen to modify the degree of order in the crystallisable phase. The effects of PC on the shear-flow behaviour of the blends was examined, and in general the PETP/PC 80 / 20 blends demonstrated lower shear viscosities than expected from additivity. Otherwise the shear flow behaviour was generally consistent with blend composition. Thermal analysis and crystallisation behaviour of the blends were investigated to determine the effects of PC on the crystallisability of the blend and the PETP T. Solid state isothermal crystallisation behaviour was studied using a modified thermal analysis <b>technique.</b> <b>Crystallisation</b> of the PETP portion of the blend was shown to be impeded by PC. A specific and rapid technique has been developed to determine depth-dependent orientation distributions Three dimensional analyses of birefringence were obtained for moulded plaques of various PETP/PC blends. The orientation distribution was in accordance with the flow pattern during processing and was noticeably planar in nature. However, the level of orientation in the mouldings investigated was very low. Thermal analysis and microscopy techniques indicate there is no evidence for miscibility in the blends. The effect of PC molecular weight and content on mechanical properties of the blend was investigated. Generally, the PETP/PC blends exhibited improved toughness, in terms of total energy absorbed, and the properties were influenced further by the degree of crystallinity. It has been shown that mechanical properties of the blend deteriorate rapidly when samples are stored for extended periods in water at 70 'C. Due to the PET? portion in the blends crystallising, and hydrolysis, the samples pass into the brittle mode. The addition of PC to PETP was found to modify the thermoelastic behaviour.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the influence of alumina increase on the functioning of casting powder during continuous casting. Two aspects of the powder's performance were experimentally measured, namely the influence of alumina on the viscosity and the crystallisation behaviour. These two aspects were then related to the in-mould functioning of the casting powder with the aid of literature references. Casting slag must provide lubrication between the mould surface and the thin steel shell. Alumina increase will cause viscosity increase in casting slags and will hinder lubrication when the inflow of casting slag into the mould/strand gap deteriorates. Heat transfer across the gap is determined by the amount of solid casting slag and the form (glass or crystalline) thereof. Heat transfer across a crystalline material may be up to seven times lower than that across a glass phase. The increased alumina will serve to increase the ratio of glassy phase to crystalline phase in the gap, so increasing the heat transfer. To determine the true extent of alumina increase with modern clean steel practice, samples were taken from the moulds of both the VI and V 2 continuous casters at ISCOR Vanderbijlpark. The influence of this alumina increase on the viscosity and the crystallisation behaviour of the casting slag were experimentally measured. Viscosity measurements were done with a rotating bob viscometer (in a vertical tube furnace) on two commercial casting powders (with increasing AI 2 O 3 content). Viscosity prediction models were evaluated with the data from the measured viscosity values. Crystallisation measurements were done by quench experiments with the aid of the hot thermocouple <b>technique.</b> <b>Crystallisation</b> behaviour after a specified heat cycle was presented as the percentage opaque material (crystalline) to vitreous material (glassy) measured with an optical microscope. For the seven sequence casts during which samples were collected from the mould, it was found that the alumina content of the casting slag reached a steady-state value within the first ladle (first 40 minutes) with an increase of 3 to 4 mass %. The influence of a 4 mass % alumina increase on the measured viscosity is small enough that proper lubrication function of the slag will not be negatively affected. Viscosity prediction models vary in their accuracy and are limited with respect to the composition range of the casting powder and the temperature range for which they are valid. The increased alumina content was found to have a strong influence on the percentage crystalline material present. After the sample was heated to 1300 °C, kept there for 10 s, and then quenched, the crystalline material will decrease from 60 % to 30 % for 5 mass % alumina added. This decreased crystalline material present may notably increase heat transfer. Full crystallisation does not occur at a single temperature, and crystallisation occurs over a temperature interval (of up to 200 °C). This means that crystallisation temperature values quoted by casting powder manufacturers depend on the heat cycle and the <b>technique</b> used during <b>crystallisation</b> measurements. Several crystalline phases are usually present in solidified casting slag and these crystalline phases are strongly influenced by the alumina content: the stable crystalline phases may change as alumina content increases. For the current alumina increase in casting powders the effect on viscosity is small, while crystallisation behaviour may be influenced to a greater extent.

40|$|The {{research}} {{detailed in}} this dissertation expands {{the field of}} knowledge {{in the area of}} numerical modelling of cooling crystallisation processes in stirred vessels. The paracetamol and ethanol solution system was chosen as the model system, which represents a typical Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient (API) cooling crystallisation process. This solution system exhibits three competing crystallisation mechanisms of primary nucleation, secondary nucleation and crystal growth. The primary nucleation rate as a function of absolute supersaturation was successfully evaluated using two approaches, namely Meta-Stable Zone Width (MSZW) and induction time experiments. The induction time was observed to be independent of the solution temperature, a novel finding, as suggested by Kubota 2 ̆ 7 s theory. The growth kinetics of paracetamol in ethanol solutions, were evaluated by means of isothermal seeded batch experiments. The growth kinetics of paracetamol crystals were evaluated in isolation, with the growth rate assumed to be size independent, using a method previously suggested by Schöll et al. (2007 a) which was modified for cooling <b>crystallisation</b> processes. The <b>technique</b> utilises a combination of in-situ Process Analytical Technologies (PAT), ex-situ analysis methods and population balance modelling to determine growth kinetics of the solute crystals. A quantitative approach to the evaluation of the minimum seed loading was employed, to ensure negligible nucleation occurred. Initial Particle Size Distributions (PSDs) were used in conjunction with desupersaturation profiles to determine the growth rate as a function of temperature and supersaturation. The secondary nucleation kinetics were determined in a similar manner, by means of isothermal under-seeded batch experiments. In this case, insufficient seed loadings were employed, so that nucleation and growth of secondary nuclei contributed significantly to the mass of the final product. With knowledge of the primary nucleation and crystal growth kinetics, the secondary nucleation kinetics were evaluated in isolation {{for a wide range of}} experimental conditions. The Method of Moments (MOM) approach was utilised to solve the population balance equation. However, this method does not conserve the actual PSD, with a reconstruction technique required to produce the PSD from its respective moments. A recently suggested (Hutton et al. 2012) PSD reconstruction method, involving the generation of moment surfaces as a function of the distribution parameters was employed in this thesis. A wide range of conditions for supersaturation, solution temperature and cooling mode were employed to evaluate the robustness of the nucleation (both primary and secondary) and growth rate kinetics. The numerical model was subsequently employed to optimise the temperature cooling profile for certain process objectives, such as improved product PSD, with reduced fine particles. Experimental validation of optimised processes were conducted to verify simulated improvements to the final crystallised product, which served to further validate the estimated process kinetics. Finally, the MOM and Method of Classes (MOC) approaches to modelling crystallisers were compared. The outputs of the numerical model developed in this thesis were compared to a commercially available crystallisation modelling software gCRYSTAL®, which employed the MOC approach, comparing corresponding simulated concentrations, final yields and PSDs. The effects of impeller type, material and blade width on the measured secondary nucleation rate were also investigated in a qualitative manner. A significant finding from this work was the major quantifiable effects of impeller material, in particular stainless steel, on the secondary nucleation kinetics. In combination with a different mixing regime, this effect largely explained the observed differences in the secondary nucleation kinetics measured in this thesis and the available literature data. Finally, a novel method which allows for the rapid and accurate calibration of the ATR-FTIR spectral data for the prediction of dissolved solution concentration, was also outlined and verified using the paracetamol and ethanol solution system...|$|R
