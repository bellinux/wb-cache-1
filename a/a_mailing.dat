25|$|The Debs Memorial Radio Fund {{launched}} its fundraising campaign with <b>a</b> <b>mailing</b> of 15,000 letters soliciting {{funds for the}} establishment of a Socialist Party-owned radio station. This first round of solicitation brought in just over $2650 — barely more than 1% of the declared goal $250,000 sought for the project. The Radio Fund's trustees estimated cost of launching a station at $100,000 and hoped to invest the balance to generate sufficient interest income to allow for perpetual operations. While this grand vision of substantial funding proved overly optimistic, the necessary funds for the acquisition of a station were successfully raised from party members and sympathetic labor unions during the first half of 1927.|$|E
50|$|LMTP is {{designed}} {{as an alternative}} to normal SMTP for situations where the receiving side does not have <b>a</b> <b>mail</b> queue, such as <b>a</b> <b>mail</b> storage server acting as <b>a</b> <b>Mail</b> Delivery Agent (MDA). <b>Mail</b> queues are <b>an</b> inherent requisite of SMTP. In situations in which mail queues are not possible, LMTP is desirable, since <b>a</b> <b>mail</b> storage server should manage only its mail store without having to allocate more storage for <b>a</b> <b>mail</b> queue. This is not possible with SMTP when there are multiple recipients for <b>a</b> <b>mail</b> message. SMTP can only indicate successful delivery or failure for all or none of the recipients, creating the need for a separate queue to handle the failed recipients. LMTP, on the other hand, can indicate success or failure to the client for each recipient, allowing the client to handle the queueing instead. The client in this case would typically be <b>an</b> Internet-facing <b>mail</b> gateway. LMTP is not intended for use over wide area networks. In other words, the Message transfer agent (MTA) still handles all outgoing mail, including the mail stream from the LMTP, to another mail server located somewhere on the Internet.|$|R

MRAs may be external applications by themselves or be built into a bigger application like an MUA. Significant examples of standalone MRAs include fetchmail, getmail and retchmail.|$|R
25|$|In mid-September 2014, Milo Yiannopoulos, vocal {{critic of}} {{feminism}} and left-wing ideologies, published leaked discussions from <b>a</b> <b>mailing</b> list for gaming journalists called GameJournoPros on the Breitbart News website. Yiannopoulos and Gamergate supporters saw the mailing list {{as evidence of}} collusion among journalists. The list's founder acknowledged suggesting that journalists write an open letter of support to Quinn {{in response to the}} harassment she was facing, but said other members of the list had rejected his suggestion and helped him understand why his idea was inappropriate. Commentators did not consider the list to represent collusion, observing that it is a standard practice across professions to adopt informal venues for discussing matters of professional interest. Following the leak, the mailing list was closed.|$|E

25|$|Before John Reed {{left for}} Russia, the Espionage Act was passed on June 15, 1917, which fined and imprisoned anyone who {{interfered}} with the recruiting of soldiers and prohibited the mailing of any newspaper or magazine that promoted such sentiments. The U. S. Postal Service was also given leave to deny any mailing that fitted these standards from further postal delivery, and then to disqualify a magazine because it had missed <b>a</b> <b>mailing</b> and hence, was no longer considered a regular publication. Because of this, The Masses was forced by the United States federal government to cease publication {{in the fall of}} 1917, after refusing to change the magazine's policy against the war. The Liberator, founded by Max Eastman under his and his sister's private control, published Reed's articles concerning the Russian Revolution instead. In an effort to ensure the magazine's survival, Eastman compromised and tempered its views accordingly.|$|E
