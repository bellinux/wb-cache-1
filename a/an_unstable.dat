The {{scalar potential}} for a scalar field canonically normalized is given by the sum of exponential potentials.

In the case of Λ< 0, the scalar potential has <b>a</b> <b>unstable</b> local maximum at the origin and a stable local minimum, it is shown that the positive cosmological constant in brane is reduced by negative potential energy of scalar at minimum...|$|R

Dafoe was cast as Osborn in November 2000, after Nicolas Cage, John Malkovich, and John Travolta turned down the role.

5|$|Around the {{beginning}} of the mating season, adult females move from the periphery towards the central male territories where they become part of short-term ‘harems’ that consist of a male and <b>an</b> <b>unstable</b> group of up to five females. Centrally located males are polygamous, while males on the periphery are monogamous or single. The mating system of the grey-headed flying fox is best described as a lek because males do not provide any essential resources to females and are chosen {{on the basis of their}} physical location within the roost, which correlates with male quality.|$|E
5|$|Finnish {{society had}} {{experienced}} rapid population growth, industrialization, pre-urbanization {{and the rise}} of a comprehensive labor movement. The country's political and governmental systems were in <b>an</b> <b>unstable</b> phase of democratization and modernization, while the people's socioeconomic condition and national-cultural status gradually improved. World War I led to the collapse of the Russian Empire and a power struggle, militarization and escalating crisis between the left-leaning Finnish labor movement and the Finnish conservatives.|$|E
5|$|Following the Fourth Crusade, the Byzantines {{were left}} in <b>an</b> <b>unstable</b> position.

Although this weakening of power gave the Empire of Nicaea a temporary free hand, it {{was nothing more than}} a small respite not capitalized as much as it could have been.|$|E

5|$|A {{radiographic}} evaluation {{using an}} X-ray, CT scan, or MRI can {{determine if there}} is damage to the spinal column {{and where it is}} located. X-rays are commonly available and can detect instability or misalignment of the spinal column, but do not give very detailed images and can miss injuries to the spinal cord or displacement of ligaments or disks that do not have accompanying spinal column damage. Thus when X-ray findings are normal but SCI is still suspected due to pain or SCI symptoms, CT or MRI scans are used. CT gives greater detail than X-rays, but exposes the patient to more radiation, and it still does not give images of the spinal cord or ligaments; MRI shows body structures in the greatest detail. Thus it is the standard for anyone who has neurological deficits found in SCI or is thought to have <b>an</b> <b>unstable</b> spinal column injury.|$|E
5|$|After his {{election}} to parliament in 1934, Davies was a consistent {{advocate for the}} interests of Merthyr Tydfil and the Welsh mining community. Largely indifferent to party discipline, he defied official Labour policy by championing such causes as disarmament and Welsh nationalism. His persistence in doing so brought him several suspensions from the party, and he was never offered ministerial office. An immensely popular figure locally, he was regularly returned at general elections with large majorities. In 1966, after <b>an</b> <b>unstable</b> colliery spoil tip collapsed on the village of Aberfan {{with the loss of}} 144 lives, Davies controversially stated that he had long thought that the tip was unsafe. He had not reported his suspicions, for fear that an inquiry would cause the closures of local pits. Not long after his unexpected 1970 electoral triumph, Davies died early in 1972 aged at least 85 and possibly 90 or more.|$|E

5|$|After the {{six years}} of absolutism that {{followed}} Ferdinand's return to the throne on 1 January 1820, Rafael del Riego initiated an army revolt {{with the intent of}} restoring the 1812 Constitution. By March, the king was forced to agree, but by September 1823, after <b>an</b> <b>unstable</b> period, a French invasion supported by an alliance of the major powers had removed the constitutional government. The last prints were probably not completed until after the Constitution was restored, though certainly before Goya left Spain in May 1824. Their balance of optimism and cynicism makes it difficult to relate them directly to particular moments in these rapidly moving events.|$|E
5|$|<b>An</b> <b>unstable</b> area {{developed}} a circulation {{and became a}} tropical depression on July 4. It headed west- northwest and became a tropical storm on July 7. The next day, it was a hurricane {{and turned to the}} west. Continuing to strengthen, it reached Category4 intensity on July 9. This windspeed was the highest of the season. The hurricane turned to the southwest and gradually weakened. By July 11 it was nearly stationary. It then headed northwestward again and continued weakening, becoming a tropical storm on July 13. It weakened into a depression on July 14 and dissipated immediately thereafter. Denise brought winds of near-gale force to parts of Mexico, but otherwise caused no damage or casualties.|$|E
5|$|As an example, the {{execution}} scene in The Kingdom of This World puts European and autochthonous cultures in opposition {{through the use}} of the spectator-performer relationship. In this spectacle situation, Carpentier is able to juxtapose the Europeans' experience of Macandal's body falling into the flames with the autochthonous (Afro-Haitian) experience of Macandal's body flying off the stake. Through the different, mutable views of the performance that he creates, Carpentier is able to represent <b>an</b> <b>unstable</b> cultural identity. As a second example, the scene that Ti Noel constructs around himself after the sacking of the Sans-Souci Palace presents the reader with a dramatic rehearsal in which Ti Noel represents culturally mobile subjectivity by performing different identities on his own.|$|E

5|$|Both {{medications}} and neurorehabilitation {{have been shown}} to improve some symptoms, though neither changes the course of the disease. Some symptoms have a good response to medication, such as <b>an</b> <b>unstable</b> bladder and spasticity, while others are little changed. For neurologic problems, a multidisciplinary approach is important for improving quality of life; however, it is difficult to specify a 'core team' as many health services may be needed at different points in time. Multidisciplinary rehabilitation programs increase activity and participation of people with MS but do not influence impairment level. There is limited evidence for the overall efficacy of individual therapeutic disciplines, though there is good evidence that specific approaches, such as exercise, and psychology therapies, in particular cognitive behavioral approaches are effective.|$|E
5|$|Early on March28, an upper-level low tracked eastward {{into the}} Southern United States {{along with its}} {{associated}} shortwave trough, sending the subtropical jet through Texas and bringing along with it strong west-northwesterly winds in the upper-levels of the troposphere. Concurrently, a cold front extended zonally tracked south across the Great Plains before eventually stalling near the Red River valley, providing an additional focus area for storm development. Favorable conditions for severe weather were expected ahead of the upper-level low over areas of North Texas; accordingly, the Storm Prediction Center(SPC) issued a moderate risk for severe weather for the region, citing <b>an</b> <b>unstable</b> atmosphere caused by steep lapse rates of 7.5-8.0°C/km and high convective available potential energy values. The environment {{was expected to be}} conducive for the development of supercells as the warped subtropical jet produced strong wind shear over Texas.|$|E
5|$|Examining the {{symbolism}} in Bosch's art"the freakish riddles … the irresponsible phantasmagoria of an ecstatic"Fränger concluded that his interpretation applied to Bosch's three altarpieces only: The Garden of Earthly Delights, Temptation of Saint Anthony, and The Haywain Triptych. Fränger distinguished these {{pieces from the}} artist's other works and argued that despite their anti-cleric polemic, they were nevertheless all altarpieces, probably commissioned for the devotional purposes of a mystery cult. While commentators accept Fränger's analysis as astute and broad in scope, they have often questioned his final conclusions. These are regarded by many scholars as hypothesis only, and built on <b>an</b> <b>unstable</b> foundation and {{what can only be}} conjecture. Critics argue that artists during this period painted not for their own pleasure but for commission, while the language and secularization of a post-Renaissance mind-set projected onto Bosch would have been alien to the late-Medieval painter.|$|E
