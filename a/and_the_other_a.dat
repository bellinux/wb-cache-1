5|$|After {{the success}} of Mayabazar (1957), {{directed}} by Kadiri Venkata Reddy, B. Nagi Reddy and Aluri Chakrapani of Vijaya Vauhini Studios planned to make a contemporary drama. Chakrapani {{came up with an}} idea about conflict between two older men who are polar opposites: one a debtor evading his creditors, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>a</b> wealthy gentleman with an inflated sense of prestige. L. V. Prasad was chosen to direct the film; he, Chakrapani and Vempati Sadasivabrahmam developed a script entitled Appu Chesi Pappu Koodu, after a popular Telugu idiom. It was the only film from Vijaya Vauhini Studios with dialogue written by Sadasivabrahmam.|$|E

5|$|As a crop, the {{blackcurrant}} {{suffers from}} several pests and diseases. The most serious disease is reversion, {{caused by a}} virus transmitted by the blackcurrant gall mite. Another is {{white pine blister rust}} which alternates between two unrelated hosts, one in the genus Ribes (blackcurrant included) <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>a</b> white pine. This fungus caused damage to forests when the fruit was first introduced into North America, where the native white pines have no genetic resistance to the disease. As a result, the blackcurrant has for most of the 20th century been subject to restrictions in parts of the United States as a disease vector. The effectiveness of these restrictions is questionable, since other Ribes species also host the disease and are native to North America.|$|E

The central area of the galaxy does appear brighter in an amateur instrument, which shows it to be tilted northeast-southwest.|$|E
5|$|During {{the evening}} of 1 May 1991, four Croatian policemen entered Borovo Selo in an {{unauthorised}} attempt to replace a Yugoslav flag in the village with a Croatian one. The attempt resulted in an armed clash. Two of the policemen were wounded and taken prisoner, {{and the other two}} fled after sustaining minor injuries (one a wounded foot <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>a</b> grazing wound to the head). According to the Croatian Ministry of the Interior, the police had been patrolling the Dalj–Borovo Selo road {{at the time of the}} incident. Even though the officers were assigned to the Osijek police administration, the Vinkovci police administrationwhich was assigned authority over the Vukovar municipalityasked the Vukovar police station to contact Šoškoćanin about the incident. Vukovar police contacted him at 4:30a.m., but Šoškoćanin reportedly said he knew nothing. At 9:00a.m., Vinkovci police chief Josip Džaja telephoned Šoškoćanin and received the same answer. When Reihl-Kir contacted Šoškoćanin half an hour later, the latter confirmed the incident and said the police had shot at members of the local population, wounding one.

Hendrix was fatigued and suffering from poor health, due in part to severe exhaustion caused by overworking, a chronic lack of sleep, and a persistent illness assumed to be influenza-related. Lacking trusting personal relationships, his insecurities about the future and disillusionment with the music industry contributed to his frustration.|$|E

5|$|In {{the final}} part, titled Payback, Atwood {{examines}} ecological debt. She recounts {{the journey of}} Scrooge in A Christmas Carol but placed in a modern setting. The modern-day Scrooge is visited by the spirits of Earth Day. In the past Scrooge witnesses debts to nature being repaid through animal and human sacrifices and through pestilence in over-crowded or unsustainable populations. In the present Scrooge witnesses current unsustainable practices, over-fishing and deforestation, creating a debt to nature being repaid through effects on the climate and impacts on people. Finally, in the future, Scrooge is shown two versions: one, an eco-friendly human society balanced with environmental systems, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>other,</b> <b>a</b> dystopian future with a disaster affecting the fuel or food resources {{in such a way}} that hyperinflation sets in and renders money useless.|$|E

5|$|Tarr was {{selected}} to play Wales the following week in Cardiff. Although England played better than expected, Wales were favourites to win and beat the visitors 8–0. Two weeks later, on 30 January, England played France with a half back combination of Frank Hutchinson, earning his first cap, and Williamson; Poulton making his debut at centre alongside Tarr; and Mobbs and Tom Simpson on the wings. France was not yet part {{of what was to}} become the Five Nations tournament (now the Six Nations) and was a relatively easy side to play. England won the game comfortably 22–0, with Tarr scoring two tries, one through good interplay with Mobbs <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>other,</b> <b>a</b> fine individual run. Despite the tries, Tarr was dropped from the England squad.|$|E

5|$|At {{the age of}} seven, Bede was sent, as a puer oblatus, to {{the monastery}} of Monkwearmouth by his family to be educated by Benedict Biscop and later by Ceolfrith. Bede does not say whether it was already {{intended}} {{at that point that}} he would be a monk. It was fairly common in Ireland at this time for young boys, particularly those of noble birth, to be fostered out as an oblate; the practice was also likely to have been common among the Germanic peoples in England. Monkwearmouth's sister monastery at Jarrow was founded by Ceolfrith in 682, and Bede probably transferred to Jarrow with Ceolfrith that year. The dedication stone for the church has survived to the present day; it is dated 23 April 685, and as Bede would have been required to assist with menial tasks in his day-to-day life it is possible that he helped in building the original church. In 686, plague broke out at Jarrow. The Life of Ceolfrith, written in about 710, records that only two surviving monks were capable of singing the full offices; one was Ceolfrith <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>a</b> young boy, who according to the anonymous writer had been taught by Ceolfrith.
