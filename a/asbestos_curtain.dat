60|$|He flitted off, and the stage-director {{leaned back}} against the <b>asbestos</b> <b>curtain.</b> He was exhausted, and his throat was in agony, but {{nevertheless}} he was conscious of a feeling of quiet happiness. His life had been lived {{in the shadow of the}} constant fear that some day Mr. Goble might dismiss him. Should that disaster occur, he felt there was always a future for him in the movies.|$|E
6000|$|The stalls {{had not yet}} entirely {{lost their}} self-control. Alarm was in the air, {{but for the moment}} they hung on the razor-edge between panic and dignity. Panic urged them to do {{something}} sudden and energetic; dignity counselled them to wait. They, like the occupants of the gallery, greatly desired to be outside, but it was bad form to rush and jostle. The men were assisting the women in their cloaks, assuring them the while that it was [...] "all right" [...] and that they must not be frightened. But another curl of smoke had crept out just before the <b>asbestos</b> <b>curtain</b> completed its descent, and their words lacked the ring of conviction. The movement towards the exits had not yet become a stampede, but already those with seats nearest the stage had begun to feel that the more fortunate individuals near the doors were infernally slow in removing themselves.|$|E
60|$|In {{these days}} when the {{authorities}} who watch over {{the welfare of the}} community have taken the trouble to reiterate encouragingly in printed notices that a full house can be emptied in three minutes and that all an audience has to do in an emergency is to walk, not run, to the nearest exit, fire in the theatre has lost a good deal of its old-time terror. Yet it would be paltering with the truth to say that the audience which had assembled to witness the opening performance of the new play at the Leicester was entirely at its ease. The <b>asbestos</b> <b>curtain</b> was already on its way down, which should have been reassuring: but then asbestos curtains never look the part. To the lay eye they seem just {{the sort of thing that}} will blaze quickest. Moreover, it had not yet occurred to the man at the switchboard to turn up the house-lights, and the darkness was disconcerting.|$|E
50|$|A {{second result}} of the fire was the {{requirement}} that an <b>asbestos</b> fire <b>curtain</b> (or sheet metal screen) be raised before each performance and lowered afterward to separate the audience from the stage.|$|R
50|$|An {{automatic}} <b>asbestos</b> safety <b>curtain</b> fronted the entr'acte drop, {{which was}} decorated with a damask valance separated into three sections, fringed with galloons. The centre of each section was embroidered with an embossed wreath, giving them a rich effect, materially enhanced by a highlight gold border running the full width of the curtain.|$|R
50|$|The theatre was {{designed}} by architect John Eberson {{with the concept of}} creating the impression of a garden in old Andalusia. Its entire design, including that of the <b>asbestos</b> fire <b>curtain,</b> was that of a Spanish garden or courtyard. The Orpheum Wichita {{was an integral part of}} the famous Orpheum Circuit and in its heyday virtually every major star of vaudeville graced its stage, including such luminaries as Eddie Cantor and Fannie Brice.|$|R
60|$|They {{passed through}} {{on to the}} stage, and found {{themselves}} in a world of noise and confusion compared with which the auditorium which they had left had been a peaceful place. Smoke was everywhere. A stage-hand, carrying a bucket, lurched past them, bellowing. From somewhere out of sight {{on the other side of}} the stage there came a sound of chopping. Jill's companion moved quickly to the switchboard, groped, found a handle, and turned it. In the narrow space between the corner of the proscenium and the edge of the <b>asbestos</b> <b>curtain</b> lights flashed up: and simultaneously there came a sudden diminution of the noise from the body of the house. The stalls, snatched from the intimidating spell of the darkness and able to see each other's faces, discovered that they had been behaving indecorously and checked their struggling, a little ashamed of themselves. The relief would be only momentary, but, while it lasted, it postponed panic.|$|E
50|$|At {{the time}} of the 1981 NRHP designation, the {{building}} stood vacant due a fire that had destroyed much of the interior in 1979 and rendered the <b>asbestos</b> <b>curtain</b> beyond repair. An April 1981 voter bond referendum approved $9.1 million for restoration. The renovated auditorium was rededicated in 1985.|$|E
5000|$|A fire in 1920 {{completely}} gutted {{the stage}} area, but the remainder was {{saved by the}} fireproof <b>asbestos</b> <b>curtain.</b> Subsequent renovations moved the orchestra pit behind the curtain and raised the boxes. Heavy clear-span beams replaced columns supporting the balconies, and the Jim Crow-era ticket booth for [...] "coloreds" [...] and its separate entrance were removed.|$|E
5000|$|After {{completing}} {{work on the}} Riverside Studio, Goff invited Hrdy {{to collaborate}} on a project he had been awarded to redesign the interior of Tulsa's Brady Theater, (then known as Convention Hall). Hrdy created a 50 foot m long <b>asbestos</b> fire <b>curtain</b> for the stage and a mural for the entrance. According to the biography by Wall, these two works, [...] "...solidified Hrdy's understanding of abstraction and her position as a modern artist." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{wrought steel}} front {{railings}} {{of the boxes}} and balconies were designed by Trost & Trost Architects. The interior was finished in the Italian renaissance style. On the <b>asbestos</b> stage <b>curtain</b> was a copy of Fernand Cormon's painting, Les Vainqueurs de Salamine. The stage itself was 68 feet wide and 45 feet deep. The roof was constructed {{for use as a}} theater in the summer months, with seating up to 1,500. The basement was used primarily for a Turkish bath, but did include a barber shop and restrooms.|$|R
5000|$|The {{lobby and}} {{mezzanine}} were decorated with Hindu deities and [...] "the main staircase {{leading to the}} balcony was flanked {{by a pair of}} huge dragons," [...] while the auditorium was topped by a vast dome, lit indirectly by 2400 light bulbs, as well as a 2000 lb [...] "tree-sized Far Eastern style chandelier" [...] including 3000 light bulbs in seven colors, costing $7000. The <b>asbestos</b> drop <b>curtain</b> was blue with gold fringes and tassels and included a hand-painted royal procession scene, with [...] "towering snow-capped mountains in the background and a misty blue apparition of the seated Buddha." [...] The Historic American Buildings Survey noted the [...] "remarkably early extensive use of neon lighting" [...] in the sign and sheet-metal marquee.|$|R
5000|$|The curtain was not fireproof. Curtains {{made with}} {{asbestos}} interwoven with wire create {{a strong and}} effective barrier against fire. The <b>asbestos</b> <b>curtain</b> at the Iroquois not only failed to lower but also proved to be both weak and flammable. Chemist Gustave J. Johnson of the Western Society of Engineers analyzed {{a piece of the}} material after the fire: [...] "It was largely wood pulp. By mixing pulp with asbestos fiber, the life of the curtain is prolonged, the cost is cheapened, and the wire foundation may be dispensed with... It results in a curtain that may get inside city ordinances, but is of no value in a fire." ...|$|E
50|$|On January 15, 1934, a fire caused {{considerable}} {{damage to the}} theatre. The fire {{is believed to have}} started from a burning cigarette thrust against the motion picture screen. The fires started at the lower right corner of the picture screen and spread rapidly to the scenery. The people at the theatre were unaware that there was a fire. The <b>asbestos</b> <b>curtain</b> was dropped hurriedly and kept the flames back stage. Firemen battled the flames for more than an hour. The Betsy Ross scenery, two complete scenery sets and 56 sets of line were destroyed. Sound equipment and screens were destroyed at a cost of estimated at 5,000. Insurance covered the cost of the damages.|$|E
5000|$|The dancers {{on stage}} were also forced to flee, {{along with the}} {{performers}} backstage and in the numerous dressing rooms. When the performers and stagehands {{went out of the}} back exit, an icy wind rushed in and made the fire substantially bigger. Many escaped from the theater through the coal hatch and through windows in the dressing rooms, and others tried to escape via the west stage door, which opened inwards and became jammed as actors pressed toward the door frantically trying to get out. By chance a passing railroad agent saw the crowd pressing against the door and unfastened the hinges from the outside using tools that he normally carried with him, allowing the actors and stagehands to escape. Someone else opened the massive double freight doors in the north wall, normally used for scenery, allowing [...] "a cyclonic blast" [...] of cold air to rush into the building and create an enormous [...] As the vents above the stage were nailed or wired shut, the fireball instead traveled outwards, ducking under the stuck <b>asbestos</b> <b>curtain</b> and streaking toward the vents behind the dress circle and gallery 50 ft away. The hot gases and flames passed over the heads of those in the orchestra seats and incinerated everything flammable in the gallery and dress circle levels, including patrons still trapped in those areas.|$|E
5000|$|The {{structure}} was built of polished gray granite {{in the classic}} Grecian order style. Its frontage was 76 feet wide and 176 feet deep. The steel frame building, equipped with the latest fireproof rigging {{of the time and}} using an <b>asbestos</b> stage <b>curtain,</b> was advertised is being absolutely fireproof. The main entrance was thirty-six feet wide, and opened directly to the sidewalk on Madison Place. The lobby was finished in mahogany with mosaic tile flooring. Broad marble staircases on either side led to the upper floors. The main floor rose five tiers, constructed on the cantilever, with two Ionic columns on the main floor and three in the balconies. The mezzanine was divided into 31 stalls, one for each President of the United States at that time, each seating four to eight people. The theater had 1,800 seats, [...] "not one from which actors can not be seen." ...|$|R
5000|$|At about 3:15 that afternoon, {{shortly after}} the {{beginning}} of the second act, eight men and eight women were performing In the Pale Moonlight. Sparks from an arc light ignited a muslin curtain, probably {{as a result of an}} electrical short circuit. A stagehand tried to douse the fire with the Kilfyre canisters provided, but it quickly spread to the fly gallery high above the stage. There, several thousand square feet of highly flammable painted canvas scenery flats were hung. The stage manager tried to lower the <b>asbestos</b> fire <b>curtain,</b> but it snagged. Early reports state that it was stopped by the trolley-wire that carried one of the acrobats over the stage, but later investigation showed that the curtain had been blocked by a light reflector which stuck out under the proscenium arch. A chemist who later tested part of the curtain stated that it was mainly wood pulp mixed with asbestos, and would have been [...] "of no value in a fire".|$|R
50|$|The 6 acre {{on which}} the {{auditorium}} is built was purchased from different entities, including a garden area from the Ursuline Academy. The 12-sided shape of the arena features carved stone and an arcade entrance complimented by a domed tower on each side. Red stone tile and metal are used on the roof. The original interior featured two-level horseshoe-shaped seating. The design on the 36 by 75 ft 5600 lb <b>asbestos</b> auditorium stage <b>curtain</b> was the painting Founding of San Antonio by artist Hugo D. Pohl. The painting depicted the artist's vision of the 1718 founding of Presidio San Antonio de Bexar, and also included the Battle of the Alamo defenders James Bowie, Davy Crockett, William B. Travis and James Butler Bonham.|$|R
