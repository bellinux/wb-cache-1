5|$|Lactuca sativa is {{a member}} of the Lactuca (lettuce) genus and the Asteraceae (sunflower or <b>aster)</b> <b>family.</b> The species was first {{described}} in 1753 by Carl Linnaeus in the second volume of his Species Plantarum. Synonyms for L.sativa include Lactuca scariola var. sativa, L.scariola var. integrata and L.scariola var. integrifolia. L.scariola is itself a synonym for L.serriola, the common wild or prickly lettuce. L.sativa also has many identified taxonomic groups, subspecies and varieties, which delineate the various cultivar groups of domesticated lettuce. Lettuce is closely related to several Lactuca species from southwest Asia; the closest relationship is to L.serriola, an aggressive weed common in temperate and subtropical zones in much of the world.|$|E
25|$|Ragweeds are {{flowering}} {{plants in the}} genus Ambrosia in the <b>aster</b> <b>family,</b> Asteraceae. They are distributed in the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, especially North America, where the origin and center of diversity of the genus are in the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. Several species have been introduced to the Old World and some have naturalized and have become invasive species. Ragweed species are expected to continue spreading across Europe {{in the near future}} in response to on-going climate change.|$|E

50|$|Aster is best {{described}} as an anti-missile missile {{that is capable of}} intercepting all types of high performance air threats such as; aircraft, UAVs, ballistic missiles, cruise missiles and anti-ship missiles at ranges of up to 120 km. There are currently two versions of the <b>Aster</b> missile <b>family,</b> the short-medium range version, Aster 15, and the long range version, Aster 30. The missile bodies are identical; Their difference in range and intercept speed is because Aster 30 uses a much larger booster. Total weights of the Aster 15 and Aster 30 are 310 kg and 450 kg respectively. Aster 15 has a length of 4.2 meters, rising to just under 5 meters for Aster 30. Aster 15 has a diameter of 180mm. Given the larger dimensions of the Aster 30, a naval based system requires the longer tubes of the Sylver A50 or A70 vertical launching system (VLS). Additionally the American Mark 41 Vertical Launching System can accommodate Aster 30.|$|R

"China Aster {{was a young}} candle-maker of Marietta, at {{the mouth}} of the Muskingum--one whose trade would seem a kind of {{subordinate}} branch of that parent craft and mystery of the hosts of heaven, to be the means, effectively or otherwise, of shedding some light through the darkness of a planet benighted.

40|$|Canada thistle is a {{herbaceous}} perennial in the <b>aster</b> (Asteraceae) <b>family</b> {{which may}} {{grow up to}} five feet in height. It is characterized by sharp, bristly, dark green leaves which are often woolly on the undersides. The purple, occasionally white, flowers are to 1 inch long. Plants bear either male or female flowers. Both male and female plants must be present in an area to produce viable seed. The fragrant flowers attract honeybees, the primary pollinator for this species. A single plant may produce up to 1, 500 seeds annually, however, the plantâ€™s main means of reproduction is its well developed lateral root system. These roots can grow up to 18 feet in one growing season and send up new shoots every 3 to 6 inches. Canada thistle may be confused with native thistle species. Therefore, consult a natural resource expert for accurate identification before attempting control measures. Habitat Canada thistle grows in most soil conditions except saturated soils. It prefers an open site with full sun. It is found in open disturbed areas such as roadsides, ditch banks and pastures. It will also invade barrens, glades, savannahs, meadows and dunes.
