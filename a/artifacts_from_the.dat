5|$|The Royal Stoa was {{destroyed}} by the Roman army during the sack of Jerusalem in 70 CE. Its site on the Temple Mount esplanade is currently inaccessible to archaeologists.

5|$|After {{several hundred}} years of no {{permanent}} habitation, the second wave of migration arrived from Canada, bringing the Dorset people to western Greenland. The first wave of immigrants, known as Dorset I, arrived around 500 BCE, inhabiting the region for the next 700 years. The early Dorset people were followed later by the Dorset II people, although no artifacts have been discovered from the later era around Sisimiut, and few <b>artifacts</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> era of Dorset I have been uncovered in archaeological sites, with the finds often limited to harpoon heads and numerous animal bones. The largest number of Dorset culture artifacts can be found further north in the Disko Bay region, while the further to the south, the poorer the finds, disappearing completely {{on the coast of}} Labrador Sea in southwestern Greenland.|$|E
5|$|Apollo set major {{milestones}} {{in human}} spaceflight. It stands alone in sending manned missions beyond low Earth orbit, and landing humans on another celestial body. Apollo 8 {{was the first}} manned spacecraft to orbit another celestial body, while Apollo 17 marked the last moonwalk and the last manned mission beyond low Earth orbit to date. The program spurred advances {{in many areas of}} technology peripheral to rocketry and manned spaceflight, including avionics, telecommunications, and computers. Apollo sparked interest in many fields of engineering and left many physical facilities and machines developed for the program as landmarks. Many objects and <b>artifacts</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> program are on display at various locations throughout the world, notably at the Smithsonian's Air and Space Museums.|$|E
5|$|In 1951 the Israeli army summoned {{representatives of}} the World Lutheran Church to remove {{religious}} <b>artifacts</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> orphanage church; church representatives removed bells, windows and a pipe organ, but left the heavy marble altar encased in a wooden chest. The church was then converted into a basketball arena for the soldiers. In October 2009, {{on a tour of}} the facility after the army had vacated the grounds, the provost of the Evangelical German Lutheran Church of the Redeemer noticed the chest and asked for it to be opened, exposing the altar. The Lutherans negotiated for it to be moved to the Lutheran church at Augusta Victoria Hospital, where it was inaugurated in November 2010.|$|E

5|$|Like {{many films}} from the silent era, The Carpet from Bagdad was {{believed}} completely lost, but in 1982 an Oceaneering International diving expedition salvaged {{a number of}} <b>artifacts</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> wreck of the RMS Lusitania, including one reel of film. With the assistance of BBC technical advisor Laurie Ward, the BFI National Archive was able to recover images from several feet of the film, sufficient to identify the title, but not to restore any of the film to projectable condition. Although there was a theater on the Lusitania, this print of The Carpet from Bagdad was probably being taken to London as a film distributor's preview, {{as was the case}} for several other films known to have been on board.|$|E

She rides on a hanging chain from the ceiling and smashes a mirror across the wall. The black Madonna breaks open a dark room by throwing the white Madonna against the wall. Different <b>artifacts</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Bond films {{are present in the}} room and the two Madonna's fight through them. Meanwhile, the Madonna in the torture chamber wears phylacteries around her arm while hiding behind an electric chair.|$|E

5|$|Crimson Echoes {{features}} all the playable {{characters of}} the original game, and is set {{five years after the}} events of Chrono Trigger. Crono and Marle are junior regents of the Kingdom of Guardia; Lucca continues her scientific endeavors. The three struggle to ease tensions with Porre, which has modernized its military and seeks to end Guardia's economic hegemony. Frog lives in 605A.D., restored to his human form, though this was not implemented before the cease and desist letter. Magus searches for Schala in the still-frozen 11,995B.C., and feuds with Dalton, obsessed with finding <b>artifacts</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> lost Kingdom of Zeal. Ayla dwells in 64,999,995B.C., and has given birth to her tribe's successor. Robo assists the Guru of Time Belthasar, who has established a clandestine temporal research facility named Chronopolis in 2305A.D. Belthasar claims it will be a guardian of time to ensure a threat such as Lavos will never arise. He nonetheless harbors darker wishes to leave a grand legacy in history, and is almost recklessly pragmatic. He fixes the Epoch during the story's course, which returns as the Neo-Epoch (akin to its design in Chrono Cross).|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} earlier {{renovation}} attempts, authorities were considering the complete demolition of the 130-year-old Christchurch Cathedral. The building had become structurally compromised {{due to the}} collapse of its western wall, and the strong vibration had shattered its stained glass rose window. Similar damage was inflicted to the Christchurch Arts Centre, although it had been in a precarious state prior to the event. A three-month reconstruction project was scheduled to take place starting in October 2011, with associated costs estimated at NZ$30 million (US$24 million). The tower of the historic Lyttelton Timeball Station, which sustained damage from the February 2011 earthquake, collapsed after plans to dismantle the building had been initiated. Lyttelton Port, a major harbour in the region, suffered additional damage from the tremors and opted to initiate full engineering assessments. The multi-story HSBC Tower shook considerably during the quake, though damage was limited to cracks and broken roof tiles. <b>Artifacts</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Canterbury Museum collection were thrown into disorder by the aftershocks, several days after reordering work had been completed since the February 2011 earthquake. In all, experts believed the earthquake would increase reconstruction costs in Christchurch by approximately NZ$6 billion (US$4.83 billion).|$|E
