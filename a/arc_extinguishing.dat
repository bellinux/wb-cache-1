40|$|Islanded operation, protection, {{reclosing}} and <b>arc</b> <b>extinguishing</b> {{are some}} of the challenging issues related to the connection of converter interfaced distributed generators (DGs) into a distribution network. The isolation of upstream faults in grid connected mode and fault detection in islanded mode using overcurrent devices are difficult. In the event of an arc fault, all DGs must be disconnected in order to extinguish the arc. Otherwise, they will continue to feed the fault, thus sustaining the arc. However, the system reliability can be increased by maximising the DG connectivity to the system: therefore, the system protection scheme must ensure that only the faulted segment is removed from the feeder. This is true even {{in the case of a}} radial feeder as the DG can be connected at various points along the feeder. In this paper, a new relay scheme is proposed which, along with a novel current control strategy for converter interfaced DGs, can isolate permanent and temporary arc faults. The proposed protection and control scheme can even coordinate with reclosers. The results are validated through PSCAD/EMTDC simulation and MATLAB calculations...|$|E

40|$|Abstract:- Recently, {{owing to}} a high demand of and high {{dependence}} on electric power, {{the reliability of the}} distribution voltage of electric power systems has become more important. 22 kV high voltage cutout fuses have been used widely, but some melting accidents have occurred due to pollution/contamination of bushings. As the number of contaminants in bushings increases, the electric fields on the fuse element surface rise to a critical level, triggering corona discharge. A fuse element material that is more resistant to corona discharge than the Ag element is desired. A new type of current-limiting fuse made of stainless steel wires, which is low-cost and simple in design has been developed. Characteristics tests, including a blocking test with a high surge current when a voltage is applied, have been conducted. Using a model fuse, it was confirmed that this new type of fuse possesses similar performance characteristics to those with an Ag element.

At the open and closed position, the PMs generate holding force for the moving iron-core to keep the static state. Then, the finite element method(FEM) and prototype test are adopted to study the properties of PM and characteristics of the actuator. The simulation concludes that the material type and structure size of PM, end cap material and processing deviation of the actuator will impact the static characteristic of the actuator. The results of the test on prototype show that MFA using NdFeB can achieve the high power output, which is conductive for electronic control as well as the displacement tracking.

In the tandem pulsed GMA welding system, newly developed by the authors, pulse peak currents are fed simultaneously to the leading and trailing electrodes in principle and a unique pulse timing control is employed in which the end of a pulse peak current for the trailing wire is delayed by 0. 5 ms from that for the leading wire to prevent the <b>arc</b> <b>extinguishing</b> By using the tandem pulsed GMA welding system, the effects of the inter-wire distance, inclination angle and welding current (wire feed rate) ratio between the two wires have been investigated to study the essential requirements for the welding torch configuration and the allocation of welding currents to obtain sound weld beads with the absence of undercut and humping in the high speed welding of steel sheets. When the welding speed was 3 m/min, a sound weld bead with uniform width was obtained with the trailing wire set at 9 -degree push angle regardless of the inclination angle of the leading wire. The inter-wire distance greatly affected the weld bead formation in high speed welding. That is, the maximum welding speed was improved with the proper inter-wire distance in the range 9 to 12 mm. In the proper range of welding current ratio, IT/IL= 0. 31 to 0. 5, the maximum welding speed achieved was 4 to 4. 5 m/min, which is 275 % higher at the maximum when compared with single wire pulsed GMA welding (at a maximum welding speed of 1. 2 m/min) ...|$|E

40|$|A {{contactor}} is an electronically controlled switch {{used for}} switching a power circuit. The principles {{have been the}} same for a hundred years, i. e. there is a contact system that does the job. The contactor is operated by a control voltage that causes it to open or close. Common applications include starting and stopping of short-circuited motors, purely resistive loads, and bypass applications. These are all usually AC applications. The recent emergence of solar energy applications has increased the demand for products that can also handle DC. The difficulty with DC is to break the current. Unlike a direct current, an alternating current will have a zero-crossing point at every half cycle. During this period of low current, the arc can be extinguished with relative ease by preventing re-ignition of the arc. For DC however, the current remains constant over time and the breaker needs to attenuate the ow of current. When the contacts are separated an electric arc occurs between them which has to be extinguished in some way for the current to be broken. This makes DC breaking extra difficult and special features need to be implemented in order to extinguish the arc and break the current ow. High voltage electric arcs causes significant damage to the electrodes and shorten the lifetime of the contactor. Therefore, minimizing the arc duration time is an important engineering challenge. This thesis is a pre-study of <b>arc</b> <b>extinguishing</b> techniques for a DC contactor. The goal {{is to be able to}} break 1500 VDC using 4 -poles connected in series. This thesis projet is divided into two parts. In the first part of the project, permanent magnets were used to suppress the arc and the simulations were performed in ANSYS Maxwel This report deals with the choice of material for a thermal management product at Mölnlycke Health Care. The aim with the product is to prevent hypothermia during surgery. The goal with this project was to investigate which material parameters that was of interest. The material parameters that were found most interesting were the thermal conductivity, the thermal diffusivity and the ability to keep a stable temperature over time. A model was built in Comsol to study the impact of different materials on the temperature on and in human skin. The simulations showed that water based materials could not spread the heat outside of the heater. In an environment that was not thermally and water isolated, the use of a water based material even led to a decrease in skin temperature. Measurements showed that different types of heaters had different requirement on the interface material. Some different commercial materials were tested and Hollywog, Medema and T ex were found to be most suitable on an iron heater and Hollywog, Medema and Heat sink were found to be most suitable on a an electrical heater. A hydrogel containing 67 % water could also be used on the electrical type of heater if the water was not allowed to evaporate. Different types of conductive particles could be used to increase the thermal conductivity and thermal diffusivity in the material. Of the evaluated conductive particles, Carbon Black and Potassium Chloride were most suitable. l. The method considered all possible wirings of the contactor and compared the results to an existing 3 -pole DC contactor. The proposed optimal solution uses steel plates surrounding the magnet and contact system to increase the magnetic ux density. Results show an increased efficiency of the magnets used by 164. 8 %. In the second part of the projects, a DC arc model was implemented in the computer program ANSYS Simplorer using theory found in literature.

For safety reasons, many metal-halide fixtures have a backup tungsten-halogen incandescent lamp that operates during cool-down and restrike.
