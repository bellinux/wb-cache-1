500|$|Justin Sevakis, {{writing for}} Anime News Network, and Erica Friedman, founder of Yuricon, {{consider}} the series a [...] "true" [...] shōjo. Friedman wrote, [...] "As {{a representative of}} early shoujoai, Ace wo Nerae is a spectacular example, but expect a fair dollop of cheesy-ness, as the character designs, music, art, etc <b>are</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> 30 years old. The op art graphics and laughable opening theme are delightfully retro now. The {{most important thing is}} that the characters are genuinely likeable and their motivations fathomable." [...] Sevakis praised the story as having [...] "purity", as [...] "There are no manufactured obstacles to overcome." [...] He also declared, [...] "Despite being Western-looking and ostensibly about universally accessible sport of tennis, it's a fascinating look at Japanese personal motivation, interaction and decorum," [...] playing [...] "like a catalog of Japan's most interesting cultural quirks." [...] Art-wise it was compared to Dear Brother and The Rose of Versailles by Anime News Network's Lynzee Lamb, who said it [...] "reinforces a lot of the dangerous work ethic that permeates sports series, like battling through a serious injury or abandoning emotional 'dalliances' like romance." ...|$|E
500|$|In North America, Walmart made a {{deal for}} the {{exclusive}} distribution of Black Ice, though a few independent music shops ordered copies of the album from foreign outlets. Angus declared that the band chose Walmart because the company is the biggest physical music retailer in America, which they believed to be [...] "the best alternative to iTunes". He also said, [...] "There aren't as many record stores these days, and Walmarts <b>are</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> America. New York and Los Angeles and Chicago may be covered, but in the heartland of America, Walmart {{may be the only}} gig in town." [...] Walmart created over 3000 [...] "Rock Again AC/DC Stores" [...] with displays showcasing the band's albums, branded clothing, the No Bull DVD, the video game , and products from sponsors. Gary Severson, a Walmart senior vice president, said that AC/DC was one of the rare artists whose loyal fan-base allowed them to display other merchandise along with the music. In October, MTV, Walmart and Columbia created [...] "AC/DC Rock Band Stores" [...] in cities without regular Walmart retail locations–New York's Times Square and Los Angeles. [...] "Black Ice" [...] trucks were dispatched on the streets of these cities after the release, playing tracks and making stops each day to sell merchandise. Advertising agency Arnold Worldwide was awarded both Best Activity Generating Brand Volume by the Marketing Agencies Association, and Best Retail/Co-Marketing Campaign by Promo Magazine for Black Ices marketing campaign.|$|E
500|$|Several reviewers re-watched {{the episode}} {{after the end}} of the series. Keith DeCandido {{reviewed}} the episode for Tor.com in June 2011. He summed it up by saying [...] "What a dreadful episode. While it's important in the grand scheme of things in what it establishes about Data's background, the episode itself is horrendously bad, from the clumsy script to the embarrassingly inept body-double work." [...] He thought the ending was anticlimactic, and that the characters all acted [...] "as dumb as posts" [...] in the episode. The most positive thing he said of the episode was that [...] "Spiner's teeth marks <b>are</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> the scenery when he's onscreen as Lore". DeCandido gave [...] "Datalore" [...] a score of four out of ten. Cast member Wil Wheaton watched the episode for AOL TV in December 2007. While he credited the art direction of the episode, he criticised the story, saying that [...] "it comes down to lazy writing that has things happen because they're supposed to happen, rather than having them happen organically. The characters are credulous when they should be skeptical, the audience isn't surprised by anything after the second act, and there are story problems that should have never gotten past the first draft." [...] He remembered really enjoying the episode as a child, but felt that it didn't hold up on repeat watchings as an adult, and stated that Spiner's [...] "fantastic job creating distinctly different characters in Data and Lore" [...] wasn't enough to remedy the other faults in the episode. He gave it a D grade.|$|E

2500|$|There {{were several}} {{incidents}} {{during the trial}} where Saddam showed defiance against the court's authority. At one point, Saddam's legal defense team {{stormed out of the}} court after questioning the tribunal's legitimacy, and asking about return of defence papers seized by US Army troops and security issues regarding the protection of the defense. Saddam, along with his co-defendants, railed against Chief Judge Amin and the tribunal. The next day, after listening to hours of testimony against him, he lashed out at the judge. He said that he was exhausted, he did not intend on returning to the trial, and to [...] "go to hell". Later, on 7 December 2005, Saddam refused to enter court, complaining of the conditions in which he was being held and the conduct of the trial. Saddam's complaints included, among other things, that he {{had not been able to}} change his clothes for four days. On 12 December 2005, instead of cross-examining witnesses, Saddam accused his American captors of torturing him, saying, [...] "I have been beaten on every place of my body, and the signs <b>are</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> my body." ...|$|E

2500|$|Rousey {{appeared}} nude on {{the cover}} of ESPN The Magazines 2012 Body Issue and in a pictorial therein. Touching upon the strategic cropping, poses, and arm placement used in the photos to make them less revealing, Rousey explained: [...] "With all these ring girls and their vaginas – all of this goes back to advice my mom gave me. She gave me this one piece of advice, which I still hold dear. She said, 'Look, whatever pictures you put out there are gonna be out there forever, so just think that one day your 12 or 13-year-old son or daughter is going to see those pictures. Whatever you want your son or daughter, or even your 13-year-old little sister to see, keep that in mind.' So, whatever I’m not gonna show on a beach, I'm not gonna show in a magazine. These girls {{are going to have to}} explain to their kids one day why mommy's ass and vagina <b>are</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> the place." [...] Her rival Miesha Tate criticized Rousey's comments as [...] "hypocritical", arguing that Rousey's comments about ring girls constituted a double standard.|$|E
2500|$|The song {{received}} polarizing {{reviews from}} music critics. Amanda Dobbins of New York magazine praised {{the composition of}} the song, writing [...] "Harris's electro fingerprints <b>are</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> this one — it plays like a straight house track, with some dreamy Rihanna vocals added in over the beat." [...] Robbie Daw of Idolator commented on the song's lyrics, with particular emphasis on the line [...] "We found love in a hopeless place", writing that it is possibly the best lyric in pop music so far in 2011. A reviewer for Instinct magazine praised the song, writing that [...] "We Found Love" [...] does not mark a departure from the dance-floor oriented material Rihanna debuted on Loud, but it certainly boasts [...] "a higher-energy, peak-hour vibe". Similarly, Michael Cragg of The Guardian commented that the song takes the dance direction Rihanna hinted at on [...] "Only Girl (In the World)" [...] and continues releasing similar songs, making reference to [...] "We Found Love". Cragg also likened the song to Leona Lewis's recent single, [...] "Collide", but criticized the song's structure, writing [...] " [...] is slightly odd". He ended his review writing, [...] "Either way, she could have recited Nick Clegg's conference speech from Wednesday over the sound of Harris cracking his knuckles {{and it would be a}} hit." ...|$|E
2500|$|Another {{system that}} runs in {{parallel}} with the public educational system {{is known as the}} Al-Azhar system. It consists of [...] six years of primary stage, a three-year preparatory stage and finally three years of secondary stage. The Ministry of education reduced the number of secondary school years from four to three years in 1998, so as to align the Al Azhar system with the general secondary education system. [...] In this system as well, there are separate schools for girls and boys. Al Azhar education system is supervised by the Supreme Council of the Al-Azhar Institution. The Azhar Institution itself is nominally independent from the Ministry of Education, but is ultimately under supervision by the Egyptian Prime Minister.Al Azhar schools are named [...] "Institutes" [...] and include primary, preparatory, and secondary phases.All schools in all stages teach religious subjects and non-religious subjects, to a certain degree- not as intensively as the state schools. The bulk of the curriculum, however, consists of religious subjects as described below. All the students are Muslims. Al-Azhar schools <b>are</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> the country, especially in rural areas. The graduates of Al-Azhar secondary schools are eligible to continue their studies at the Al-Azhar University. [...] As of 2007 and 2008, there are 8272 Al-Azhar schools in Egypt. In the early 2000s, Al-Azhar schools accounted for less than 4% of the total enrollment. The graduates of this system [...] are then automatically accepted into Al-Azhar University.In 2007, the Pre-University enrollment in Al- Azhar institutes is about 1,906,290 students.|$|E
