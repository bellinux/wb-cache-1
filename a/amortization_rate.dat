40|$|The current {{accounting}} {{measurement and}} reporting system is ill-equipped to provide intangible investment {{information that is}} decision useful for stakeholders in the information economy. Potentially relevant intangible items are not reported on the balance sheet, since current standards mandate the immediate expensing of these intangible items. Presumably FASB 2 ̆ 7 s uncertainty with the fundamental issues of extent and timing of future benefits to the firm has led to concerns with relevance, reliability, and objectivity of capitalizing some intangibles, which results in potential long term value generating expenditures being immediately expensed on the income statement. Prior research has demonstrated extent and timing of some income statement intangibles, such as advertising and research and development, however the potential value of IT intangibles as an asset has not been investigated. This dissertation addresses issues on the accounting treatment for information technology (IT) expenditures and includes two parts. The first part contains an essay discussing the business value of IT expenditures using a rational economic argument to propose the capitalization of IT expenditures as an appropriate accounting treatment. The second part is composed of an essay that proposes statistically reliable <b>amortization</b> <b>rates</b> for intangible IT expenditures followed by a value analysis of the proposed accounting treatment.

40|$|At {{the request}} of the Western Area Power Administration (Western), an audit of 17 areas was {{conducted}} with respect to possible overcharges on a power contract between Western and Basin Electric Power Cooperative (Basin), Contract No. DE-MP 65 - 82 WP- 19001. The contract for Western`s purchase of electric power from Basin was entered into on April 15, 1982, and was in effect from January 1, 1986, through October 31, 1990. During this 58 -month period, Basin billed Western approximately $ 197. 6 million. Overall, it was found that Basin overcharged Western approximately $ 23. 8 million. These overcharges occurred because Basin: (1) did not recognize or amortize as gain its overestimate of completion and correction costs for Antelope Valley Station (AVS) Unit 2; (2) did not amortize the gain on the sale/leaseback of AVS Unit 2 as an offset to lease costs; (3) billed Western prematurely for lease and interest costs; (4) overcharged for the cost of coal by including administrative and general expenses and profit, as well as incorrectly calculating discounts, royalty payments, and imputed interest costs; (5) made faulty calculations of <b>amortization</b> <b>rates</b> for deferred costs; (6) used a shorter depreciation period for AVS common facilities than it had used for other power plants; (7) retained tax benefit transfers; and (8) charged Western for interest and depreciation that had been paid by others.

40|$|Title: The {{amortization}} requirements' {{impact on}} banking operations organization and credit assessment Authors: Annie Majlöf and Therese Hasselgren Supervisor: Titti Eliasson Examiner: Eva Berggren Keywords: Credit assessment, organization change, banks, amortization requirement Purpose: The {{purpose of our}} study {{is to increase the}} understanding and to find out how a regulation change, as the amortization requirement, may affect and change the organization and credit assessment in various banks. Problem background: Swedish households are currently highly leveraged where the high indebtedness is partly a result of low <b>amortization</b> <b>rate.</b> Measures to reduce debt may therefore be necessary to reduce households' sensitivity to economic disruptions. If the <b>amortization</b> <b>rate</b> increases, the high leverage of households would attenuate. For this reason, an amortization requirement is introduced with the purpose of reduce debt and increase households’ resistance. If the market requires change it is necessary that organizations change accordingly. As a result of new regulations and requirements the need of change arises and directly affects organizations, such as adaptation of procedures and processes, internal systems and skill development. Research problem: How can the amortization requirement affect and change the organization and credit assessment in banks? Method: This study is of qualitative character since the empirical material consists of qualitative interviews. The intention is to acquire increased comprehension rather than to make generalization possible. We derived our empirical study based on our theoretical framework in order to later analyze the two parts. Based on the analysis {{we have been able to}} draw conclusions and to bring discussion. Conclusion: The study came out into that the amortization requirement creates a rational and a saner repayment culture. As a result of the regulation change there has been some change in the banks’ organization in various aspects. A conclusion is that the credit assessment when granting credit is more restrictive and limited as a result of the requirement claim. However, the amortization requirement constitutes a varied impact on banks’ organization and credit assessment process...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The paper {{concerns}} {{the case of}} the insured loan based on an amortization schedule at variable interest rates. Basing on the cash flow structure, the aim is to evaluate the mathematical provision of a portfolio in a fair value approach. In this environment, the complexity of a life insurance contract management practically involves the choice of the most suitable mortality table and discounting process; in the paper the tool is treated in a stochastic scenario for interest rates and in random hypotheses for the mortality <b>rates.</b> The <b>amortization</b> schedule used for the loan repayment is considered at variable interest rates, hooked at opportune rate indexes. A numerical application of the model is presented and a comparison between the behaviour of the fair values of the insured loan portfolio reserve in the two cases of an amortization schedule at fixed and at variable interest rates is reported. The fair reserve sensitivity to the changes of the <b>amortization</b> interest <b>rate</b> is studied and showed with illustrations...|$|R

40|$|Household debt in South Korea is {{high and}} still rising. Household debt to GDP ratio had risen at the similar pace with that in the US until 2007 but it has still been rising whereas it has been falling since 2017 in the US. As a result, it is now higher in South Korea than in the US. There was a {{dramatic}} growth in household debt in the US preceding the recent Great Recession and high level of household debt was viewed to amplify the severity of economic recession in the US constraining consumer spending. In this context, high and continuously rising household debt could be a potential risk factor for the South Korean economy. Macroprudential policy, which indicates policy aims to reduce financial systemic risk pre-emptively, is a crucial measure {{to slow down the}} pace of household debt growth in South Korea. However, there is no established tool to analyse or evaluate its effects and relationship to monetary policy. The second chapter presents the trend and distribution of household debt in South Korea, and brief history of policy responses to continuously increasing household debt. The third chapter shows how macroprudential policy works by using a simple heterogeneous DSGE model with collateral constraint. The model is based on so-called borrower-saver model. Despite of its simplicity, the model can clearly explain how macroprudential policy affects household debt and related variables in South Korea. In addition, dynamics of this model imply increasing amortisation rate is superior measure to decreasing LTV ratio because it induces less volatility in economy. The collateral constraint in this thesis is designed to distinguish household debt (stock) and borrowing (flow). As a result, it is more realistic than the one mostly used in literature. This collateral constraint setting contributes to the better results especially when we analyse the phase of tightening household credit conditions. Furthermore, it enables us to see how <b>amortization</b> <b>rate</b> affects the South Korean economy. The fourth chapter extends the model mainly to see how credit tightening and monetary policy work differently and how they interact. Habit formation in non-durable good consumption, price rigidity in non-durable good producers, fixed cost in intermediate good production and monetary policy are added in the model. Not only the newly added elements themselves but also inflation make model's responses different from those in the previous chapter. Nominal and real rigidities make dynamics last longer and more realistic. Due to the structure of collateral constraint, a rise in inflation can reduce the level of real household debt whereas there is no inflation effect on real household debt with the common type of collateral constraint. This also influences responses to monetary policy shock. The results demonstrate credit tightening is better than monetary policy in slowing down the growth rate of household debt. Among all policy measures considered, decreasing <b>amortization</b> <b>rate</b> is the most effective and increasing LTV ratio is the second. These implies that ongoing policy efforts to slow down the growth rate of household debt in South Korea is on the right track. The fifth chapter shows welfare effects of macroprudential policy. The results illustrate it is impossible to get social welfare gains in a situation given in South Korea when discretionary macroprudential policy comes into effect. If government adopts countercyclical macroprudential rule, it is possible to improve social welfare but it requires welfare loss either of borrower or saver...|$|E
40|$|This study {{utilizes}} firm-specific {{time-series data}} {{to estimate the}} economic value of {{the research and development}} (R&D) expenditures that investors consider an asset to the firm. The study uses a modification of the Ohlson (1995) model to estimate the persistence of abnormal earnings, the proportion of current R&D expenditures that represents a source of future benefits to the firm and the <b>amortization</b> <b>rate</b> of that asset. The parameters are estimated from time-series data of market and book values of equity, earnings and R&D expenditures. The study further compares the firm-specific estimates with those resulting from an application of a cross-sectional estimation procedure based on all available companies in the sample and industry-specific sub-samples. Results indicate the existence of significant differences in some two-digit SIC code industries between the time-series and the cross-sectional estimates of the parameters and the economic value of the R&D asset. Differences in the capitalization parameter are associated with the growth in R&D, the profitability of the firm, R&D intensity and the concentration of the industry. Differences in the persistence of earnings are related to the concentration ratio. Finally, differences in the estimated economic value of the R&D asset are associated with the profitability of the company as measured by its return on assets. We further compare the associations between the three different estimates of the R&D asset and subsequent stock returns, as well as the contemporaneous difference between the market and book value of companies. Results indicate that the time-series estimates of the R&D asset show stronger associations with both variables, followed by the intra-industry and the cross-industry cross-sectional estimates. Overall, our results provide evidence that market participants behave as if R&D expenditures have significant future economic benefits to the firm, and show that the cross-sectional and time-series approaches followed when assessing its economic value provide significantly different estimates. ...|$|E

40|$|The Great Recession renewed {{focus on}} {{various stages of}} a mortgage's life [...] -how they are originated, why borrowers default on them, and how default is {{ultimately}} resolved. More specifically, the chapters of this dissertation {{shed light on the}} factors determining the success of mortgage renegotiation, and on the rise in the origination of complex mortgage instruments. Features of the securitized mortgage market are either explicitly studied, or provide the foundation for the empirical methodologies I develop. During the housing crisis regulators faced impediments in their unprecedented intervention to promote large-scale mortgage renegotiation. What hampered renegotiation {{in the wake of the}} crisis? To answer this question, in Chapter 1, The Limited Benefits of Mortgage Renegotiation, I study the expected gains from renegotiation for both sides of a mortgage contract: investors and borrowers. To overcome selection bias, I use plausibly exogenous variation in the propensity of intermediaries to renegotiate mortgages. I find that loan modification helped investors recover 3. 5 % more of the principal balance outstanding at the time of delinquency relative to foreclosing upon the borrower. However, there was substantial variation around this mean [...] -a 12. 5 % (3. 6 times the mean) standard deviation [...] -which highlights the high degree of uncertainty about the realization of these gains. Thus, despite expected gains to borrowers [...] -higher credit scores and a $ 115 increase in monthly consumption [...] -regulators' attempts to promote mortgage renegotiation have proven to be ineffective, exacerbating debt overhang and its consequences. The setting of Residential Mortgage Backed Securitization (RMBS) provides an ideal testing ground for theories of debt-structure, agency problems and their effect on debt renegotiation. Via the tranching of cash flows from underlying mortgages, an RMBS transaction creates multiple securities with claims to the underlying collateral. Moreover, tax law mandates the hiring of an agent, the Servicer, to manage the underlying collateral. In Chapter 2, Multiple Tranches, Information Asymettry and the Impediments to Mortgage Renegotiation, I first develop a simple conceptual framework to outline the channels via which multiple claim-holders induce fewer than optimal loan modification by worsening the agency problem between mortgage Servicers and RMBS Sponsors. Then, using within deal variation in the number and structure of tranches, I find that loans in pools collateralizing fewer tranches are more likely to be modified conditional upon being seriously delinquent. I also find that modified loans in such loan pools were likely to receive more aggressive loan modifications. The results provide evidence for one channel via which the securitization of mortgages inhibited the renegotiation of delinquent mortgages in the wake of the housing crisis, and complement the results of Chapter 1. In Chapter 3, Partial Deregulation and Competition: Evidence from Risky Mortgage Origination, co-authored with Amir Kermani (University of California, Berkeley) and Marco Di Maggio (Harvard University), we exploit the OCC's preemption of national banks from state laws against predatory lending as a quasi-experiment to study the effect of deregulation and its interaction with competition on the supply of complex mortgages. Following the preemption ruling, national banks significantly increased their origination of loans with prepayment penalties by comparison with national banks in states without predatory-lending laws. We highlight a competition channel: in counties where OCC-regulated lenders had larger market shares, non-OCC lenders responded by increasing their use of riskier contract features, such as deferred <b>amortization,</b> adjustable <b>rates</b> and interest-only payments, which were not restricted by the state predatory-lending laws...|$|R
