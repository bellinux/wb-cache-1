50|$|During {{the high}} speed taxi, the pilot raised {{the nose of}} the {{airplane}} and it became airborne. The airplane climbed with a high angle of attack to approximately 100 feet. The pilot then reduced the power to idle and lowered the <b>airplane</b> <b>nose.</b> The airplane collided with the ground as the pilot attempted to recover from the inadvertent flight. During the collision with the ground the ballistic recovery parachute was deployed, and the airplane was dragged 200 feet off the runway.|$|E

The FAA report stated, “Witnesses watched as the pilot/owner maneuvered his homebuilt airplane at a low altitude. Some witnesses reported the engine sounds stopped before impact. The <b>airplane's</b> <b>nose</b> dropped down and it descended until ground impact and was destroyed during a post crash fire. Witnesses reported observing the airplane on numerous other occasions performing low level maneuvering. Examination of the airframe and engine did not reveal anomalies. The propeller blades were not damaged.” ...|$|R

At first, there it is put an {{overview}} of recent construction layouts at different airplane types. The second part is devoted to particular aircraft EV- 55 Outback produced by Czech company Evektor. The aim of this work is to suggest adjustments and changes to current configuration, trying to make the mechanism open and close the door during the extension of the nose landing gear, with respect to the recent state of the fuselage and minimal changes to it...|$|E
40|$|A {{study was}} {{performed}} to determine the feasibility of establishing if a 'shaped' sonic boom signature, experimentally shown in wind tunnel models out to about 10 body lengths, will persist out to representative flight conditions of 200 to 300 body lengths. The study focuses {{on the use of}} a relatively large supersonic remotely-piloted and recoverable vehicle. Other simulation methods that may accomplish the objective are also addressed and include the use of nonrecoverable target drones, missiles, full-scale drones, very large wind tunnels, ballistic facilities, whirling-arm techniques, rocket sled tracks, and <b>airplane</b> <b>nose</b> probes. In addition, this report will also present a background on the origin of the feasibility study including a brief review of the equivalent body concept, a listing of the basic sonic boom signature characteristics and requirements, identification of candidate vehicles in terms of desirable features/availability, and vehicle characteristics including geometries, area distributions, and resulting sonic boom signatures. A program is developed that includes wind tunnel sonic boom and force models and tests for both a basic and modified vehicles and full-scale flight tests...|$|E
40|$|The {{use of an}} all-flush-pressure-orifice array as a subsonic air data {{system was}} {{evaluated}} in flight and wind tunnel tests. Two orifice configurations were investigated. Both used orifices arranged in a cruciform pattern on the <b>airplane</b> <b>nose.</b> One configuration also used orifices {{on the sides of}} the fuselage for a source of static pressure. The all-nose-orifice configuration was similar to the shuttle entry air data system (SEADS). The flight data were obtained with a KC- 135 A airplane. The wind tunnel data were acquired with a 0. 035 -scale model of the KC- 135 A airplane. With proper calibration, several orifices on the vertical centerline of the vehicle's nose were found to be satisfactory for the determination of total pressure and angle of attack. Angle of sideslip could be accurately determined from pressure measurements made on the horizontal centerline of the aircraft. Orifice pairs were also found that provided pressure ratio relationships suitable for the determination of Mach number. The accuracy that can be expected for the air data determined with SEADS during subsonic orbiter flight is indicated...|$|E
5000|$|The {{example of}} {{miscommunication}} between the pilots {{was when the}} plane was in a critical stalling condition, the co-pilot misunderstood the captain's command [...] "pull down"; instead of pushing the <b>airplane's</b> <b>nose</b> down (pushing forward on the stick to regain speed and escape the stall), he pulled the stick back, which would have ordered the plane to climb more steeply. Because the captain was also pushing the stick forward and because Airbus has a dual-input system, the two stick inputs cancelled each other out, {{which led to the}} plane remaining in a stall condition {{until the end of the}} black box recording.|$|R
5000|$|The {{aircraft}} continued {{past the}} end of the runway, traveling another 800 feet and striking a security fence and an ILS localizer array. The aircraft then collided with a structure built to support the landing lights for runway 22L, which extended out into the Arkansas River. Such structures are usually [...] - i.e. designed to shear off on impact - but because the approach lights were located on the unstable river bank, they were firmly anchored. The collision with the nonfrangible structure crushed the <b>airplane's</b> <b>nose</b> and destroyed {{the left side of the}} plane's fuselage, from the cockpit back to the first two rows of coach seating. The impact broke the aircraft apart into multiple large sections, which came to a rest short of the river bank.|$|R
50|$|Although {{all of the}} European {{powers were}} {{unprepared}} for modern air warfare {{in the beginning of}} the conflict, Austria-Hungary was one of the most disadvantaged due to the empire's traditionalist military and civilian leadership combined with a relatively low degree of industrialisation. The Empire's agricultural economy mitigated against innovation. Such industry as it possessed was used to full extent for aircraft manufacture; instead of producing single types of aircraft from dedicated assembly lines, contracts were let to multiple factories, and individual factories were producing multiple types of aircraft. Shortage of unskilled labor also hampered production. Technological backwardness was not limited to the usage of handicraft construction instead of assembly lines. For instance, the most widely used Austro-Hungarian fighter, the Hansa-Brandenburg D.I, lacked the gun synchronization gear that would allow aiming the <b>airplane's</b> <b>nose</b> and firing its weaponry through the propeller.|$|R

2500|$|The plane {{suddenly}} {{shook and}} its airspeed dropped precipitously. The left wing dropped {{and the plane}} began {{to turn to the}} left. Flight Engineer Forbes noted that the fuel flow meter was not indicating any flow to the No. 4 engine. Captain Claude quickly applied full throttle and ordered Forbes to apply the booster pump, which increases the fuel flow to the engines in emergencies. The captain applied full right aileron in an attempt to raise the dropping left wing, and ordered First Officer Lewis to raise the flaps and landing gear, intending to circle the airport and attempt another landing (known as a go-around). Lewis raised the landing gear but did not raise the flaps, stating later that he “was afraid” to raise them because he assumed that the airplane would immediately stall if he complied. [...] Lewis noticed that the No. 4 engine’s fuel pressure was zero and its RPM was dropping, and he feathered the prop, hoping that the resulting reduction in drag would help the airplane accelerate and climb. However, with the flaps down and only two of the four engines working, the DC-6 did not accelerate; it continued to drop, headed on a path crossing Runway 36 approximately 40 degrees to the left. The captain raised the <b>airplane's</b> <b>nose</b> in a futile attempt to climb, but the airliner stalled instead, striking the runway tail-first.|$|R
5000|$|When the {{wreckage}} was found some 42 hours later, {{it was discovered}} the <b>airplane's</b> engine and <b>nose</b> were buried in the ground due {{to the impact of}} the crash. The crash site was in a wooded area north-northeast of Brentwood approximately at the junction of Baxter Lane and Franklin Pike Circle, just east of Interstate 65, and southwest of Nashville International Airport where Reeves planned to land.|$|R
50|$|For CAT IIIc, {{the flight}} control {{computer}} will continue to accept deviations from the localizer and use the rudder to maintain the aircraft on the localizer (which is aligned with the runway centerline.) On landing the spoilers will deploy (these are surfaces {{on the top of}} the wing towards the trailing edge) which causes airflow over the wing to become turbulent, destroying lift. At the same time the autobrake system will apply the brakes. The anti-skid system will modulate brake pressure to keep all wheels turning. As the speed decreases, the rudder will lose effectiveness and the pilot will need to control the direction of the <b>airplane</b> using <b>nose</b> wheel steering, a system which typically is not connected to the {{flight control computer}}.|$|R
50|$|The flight {{took off}} from Chiang Kai-shek International Airport at 16:53 Taiwan Standard Time bound for Nagoya Airport. The {{en-route}} flight was uneventful and the descent started at 19:47, and the airplane passed the outer marker at 20:12. Just 3 nmi km from the runway threshold at 1000 ft AGL, the airplane levelled off for about 15 seconds and continued descending until about 500 ft where there were two bursts of thrust applied in quick succession and the <b>airplane</b> was <b>nose</b> up in a steep climb. Airspeed dropped quickly, the airplane stalled, and struck the ground at 20:15:45. 31-year-old Noriyasu Shirai, a survivor, said that a flight attendant announced that the plane would crash after the aircraft stalled. Sylvanie Detonio, who had survived by 27 April, said that passengers received no warning prior to the crash.|$|R
5000|$|A {{spiral dive}} {{is not a}} spin; it starts, not with a stall or from torque but with a random, {{increasing}} roll and airspeed. Without prompt intervention by the pilot, {{this can lead to}} structural failure of the airframe, either as a result of excess aerodynamic loading or flight into terrain. The aircraft initially gives little indication that anything has changed. The pilot's [...] "down" [...] sensation continues to be with respect {{to the bottom of the}} airplane, although the aircraft actually has increasingly rolled off the true vertical. Under VFR conditions, the pilot corrects for this deviation from level automatically using the true horizon, while it is very small; but in IMC or dark conditions it can go unnoticed: the roll will increase and the lift, no longer vertical, is insufficient to support the <b>airplane.</b> The <b>nose</b> drops and speed increases: the spiral dive has begun.|$|R
40|$|The National Tire Modeling Program (NTMP) {{is a joint}} NASA/industry {{effort to}} improve the {{understanding}} of tire mechanics and develop accurate analytical design tools. This effort includes fundamental analytical and experimental research on the structural mechanics of tires. Footprint local forces, areas, and aspect ratios were measured. Local footprint forces in the vertical, lateral, and drag directions were measured with a special footprint force transducer. Measurements of the local forces in the footprint were obtained by positioning the transducer at specified locations within the footprint and externally loading the tires. Three tires were tested: (1) one representative of those used on the main landing gear of B- 737 and DC- 9 commercial transport <b>airplanes,</b> (2) a <b>nose</b> landing gear tire for the Space Shuttle Orbiter, and (3) a main landing gear tire for the Space Shuttle Orbiter.

5000|$|The XP-54 {{was unique}} in {{numerous}} ways. The pressurized cockpit required a complex entry system: the pilot’s seat acted as an elevator for cockpit access from the ground. The pilot lowered the seat electrically, sat in it, and raised {{it into the}} cockpit. Bail-out procedure was complicated by the pressurization system and necessitated a downward ejection of the pilot and seat in order to clear the propeller arc. Also, the nose section could pivot through the vertical, three degrees up and six degrees down. In the nose, two 37 mm T-9 cannon were in rigid mounts while two [...]50 cal machine guns were in movable mounts. Movement of the nose and machine guns was controlled by a special compensating gun sight. Thus, the cannon trajectory could be elevated without altering the flight attitude of the <b>airplane.</b> The large <b>nose</b> section gave rise to its whimsical nickname, the Swoose Goose, inspired by a song about Alexander who was half swan and half goose: [...] "Alexander was a swoose." ...|$|R
40|$|A {{ditching}} {{investigation was}} made of a l/l 2 -scale dynamically similar model of the Douglas F 4 D- 1 airplane to study its behavior when ditched. The model was landed in calm water at the Langley tank no. 2 monorail. Various landing attitudes, speeds, and configurations were investigated. The behavior of the model was determined from visual observations, acceleration records, and motion-picture records of the ditchings. Data are presented in tables, sequence photographs, time-history acceleration curves, and attitude curves. From {{the results of the}} investigation, it was concluded that the airplane should be ditched at the lowest speed and highest attitude consistent with adequate control (near 22 deg) with landing gear retracted. In a calm-water ditching under these conditions the <b>airplane</b> will probably <b>nose</b> in slightly, then make a fairly smooth run. The fuselage bottom will sustain appreciable damage so that rapid flooding and short flotation time are likely. Maximum longitudinal deceleration will be about 4 g and maximum normal acceleration will be about 6 g in a landing run of about 420 feet, In a calm-water ditching under similar conditions with the landing gear extended, the airplane will probably dive. Maximum longitudinal decelerations will be about 5 - 1 / 2 g and maximum normal accelerations will be about 3 - 1 / 2 g in a landing run of about 170 feet...|$|R
40|$|Local flow {{conditions}} were measured underneath the National Aeronautics and Space Administration F- 15 B airplane to support development of future experiments on the Propulsion Flight Test Fixture (PFTF). The local Mach number and flow angles were measured using a conventional air data boom on a cone-cylinder mounted under the PFTF and {{compared with the}} <b>airplane</b> air data <b>nose</b> boom measurements. At subsonic flight speeds, the airplane and PFTF Mach numbers were approximately equal. Transonic Mach number values were up to 0. 1 greater at the PFTF than the airplane, which is a counterintuitive result. The PFTF local supersonic Mach numbers were as much as 0. 46 less than the airplane values. The maximum local Mach number at the PFTF was approximately 1. 6 at an airplane Mach number near 2. 0. The PFTF local angle of attack was negative at all Mach numbers, ranging from - 3 to - 8 degrees. When the airplane angle of sideslip was zero, the PFTF local value was zero between Mach 0. 8 and Mach 1. 1, - 2 degrees between Mach 1. 1 and Mach 1. 5, and increased from zero to 1 degree from Mach 1. 5 to Mach 2. 0. Airplane inlet shock waves crossed the aerodynamic interface plane between Mach 1. 85 and Mach 1. 90...|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation was}} conducted to determine the performance characteristics an underslung nose-scoop air-induction system for a supersonic <b>airplane.</b> Five different <b>nose</b> shapes, three lip shapes, and two internal diffusers were investigated. Tests were made at Mach numbers from 0 to 1. 9, angles of attack from 0 deg to approximately l 5 deg, and mass-flow ratios from 0 to maximum obtainable. It {{was found that the}} underslung nose-scoop inlet was able to operate at Mach numbers from 0. 6 to 1. 9 over a large positive angle-of-attack range without adverse effects on the pressure recovery. Although there was no one inlet configuration that was markedly superior over the entire range of operating variables, the arrangement having a nose designed to give increased supersonic compression at low angles of attack, and a sharp lip (configuration designated N 3 L 3) showed the most favorable performance characteristics over the supersonic Mach number range. Inlets with sizable lip radii gave satisfactory performance up to a Mach number of 1. 5; however, {{as a result of an}} increase in drag, the performance of such inlets was markedly inferior to the sharp-lip configuration above Mach numbers of 1. 5. Throughout the range of test Mach numbers all inlet configurations evidenced stable air-flow characteristics over the mass-flow range for normal engine operation. Analysis of the inlet performance on the basis of a propulsive thrust parameter showed that a fixed inlet area could be used for Mach numbers up to 1. 5 with only a small sacrifice in performance...|$|R

At an aviation meet in St. Louis fellow enthusiasts discussed the possibility of holding an air meet in Los Angeles. This group, which included Charles Willard, Roy Knabenshue, and Glenn Curtiss, followed through on the proposed project and sent Dick Ferris to Los Angeles to make the preliminary contacts and finalize the plans for the proposed Air Meet. After arriving in Los Angeles Ferris met with various contacts and an International Air Meet was proposed which would include Louis Paulhan-a renowned French aviator. The location was selected, Dominguez Field, which was part of one of the original Spanish land grants-The Rancho San Pedro. Publicity was begun, grandstands were erected and an expanded passenger platform was constructed at the Pacific Electric Station located closest to the Air Meet site to accommodate the large number of spectators expected to attend the event. Dates for the Air Meet were agreed upon. Commencing on January 10 th, 1910 and lasting ten days until January 20 th the air meet would invite a variety of participants and would include not only aeroplanes but also hot air balloons and dirigibles. Cash prizes would be awarded to those participating in scheduled events, which would include altitude, speed, and endurance competitions. " [...] Peter Bergen (part 1 of 2).; "Over the ten-day period of the air meet spectators were thrilled by the performances of aviators Louis Paulhan, Glenn Curtiss, Charles Willard, and others. Paulhan was the 'star attraction' at the air meet. Invited by the organizers to participate, Paulhan brought with him to the event two Bleriot Monoplanes, Two Farman Biplanes, and an entourage, which included his wife and black poodle dog. At the air meet he set a new altitude record (4164 ft.), endurance record (64 miles in 1 hr. 49 mins. 40 secs.), and won $ 14, 000 in prize money. Glenn Curtiss won two events-fastest speeds with a passenger (55 mph) and quickest start (6 2 / 5 secs. covering 98 ft.). Curtiss took home $ 6500 in prize money. Charles Willard was credited with the most accurate take off and landing skills for which he receive a prize totaling $ 250. Attendance at the air meet reached and surpassed all expectations. During the ten-day period of the air meet an estimated 226, 000 spectators converged on Dominguez Field. Gate receipts for the event equaled over $ 137, 500. The air meet was considered a phenomenal success and helped to alleviate a perceived economic drought in the Los Angeles area. " [...] Peter Bergen (part 2 of 2) ...|$|R
