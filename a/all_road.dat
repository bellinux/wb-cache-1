5|$|Allenby's {{plan was}} to avoid {{fighting}} in or near Jerusalem but to cut <b>all</b> <b>road</b> access {{to the city and}} force the Ottoman Army to evacuate it. He ordered two infantry divisions; the 52nd (Lowland) (Major General J. Hill) and the 75th Division (Major General P. C. Palin), and two mounted divisions; the Yeomanry and the Australian Mounted Divisions to begin the advance. They were to move eastwards from Latron, which had been captured on 16 November, {{in the same direction as}} the Jaffa to Jerusalem road.|$|E
5|$|The District {{is divided}} into four {{quadrants}} of unequal area: Northwest (NW), Northeast (NE), Southeast (SE), and Southwest (SW). The axes bounding the quadrants radiate from the U.S. Capitol building. <b>All</b> <b>road</b> names include the quadrant abbreviation to indicate their location and house numbers generally correspond {{with the number of}} blocks away from the Capitol. Most streets are set out in a grid pattern with east–west streets named with letters (e.g., C Street SW), north–south streets with numbers (e.g., 4th Street NW), and diagonal avenues, many of which are named after states.|$|E
50|$|<b>All</b> <b>roads</b> lead to Rome. In Ancient Rome, {{this was}} {{literally}} and metaphorically true. <b>All</b> <b>roads</b> did radiate {{out from the}} capital of the Empire and all tribute and authority was owed to the Emperors. This is a form of cognitive mapping which associates inspiring ideology and strong leadership with a particular location. Hence, Hitler promoted Munich as the place where <b>all</b> <b>roads</b> must leadgeography materializing the ideology of fascism.|$|R

5|$|Under Lon Nol (and with American assistance), the Cambodian Army was {{enlarged}} and reorganized in to FANK (Forces Armees Nationales Khmeres) {{and then}} launched into offensives against PAVN. Hanoi responded by launching Campaign X, an operation {{to widen the}} buffer zones around its lines of communication. Using economy of force, as few as 10,000 PAVN troops routed FANK forces in western and northeastern Cambodia, taking or threatening 16 of the country's 19 provincial capitals and interdicting, for various periods, <b>all</b> <b>road</b> and rail links to the capital. They also kept a wary eye on U.S. and South Vietnamese forces, which they fully expected would {{take advantage of the}} situation.|$|E

25|$|In 2006, Kirkland was {{the first}} city in Washington to adopt a Complete Streets ordinance, whereby {{pedestrian}} and bicycle facilities are addressed {{as a part of}} <b>all</b> <b>road</b> construction and improvement planning projects.|$|E
25|$|Shared space schemes {{extend this}} {{principle}} further {{by removing the}} reliance on lane markings altogether, and also removing road signs and signals, allowing <b>all</b> <b>road</b> users to use {{any part of the}} road, and giving <b>all</b> <b>road</b> users equal priority and equal responsibility for each other's safety. Experiences where these schemes are in use show that road users, particularly motorists, undirected by signs, kerbs, or road markings, reduce their speed and establish eye contact with other users. Results from the thousands of such implementations worldwide all show casualty reductions and most also show reduced journey times. After the partial conversion of London's Kensington High Street to shared space, accidents decreased by 44% (the London average was 17%).|$|E
25|$|The {{continuous}} power {{delivery of the}} DCT minimises the loss of torque and forward motion by the powertrain during gear shifts, resulting in more decisive acceleration and a smoother drive.

25|$|Other European {{countries}} {{have their own}} mandates limiting consumption of conventional fossil fuels by substituting to cleaner fuels {{in order to reduce}} greenhouse gas emissions, such as the United Kingdom Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation Program (RTFO), requiring transport fuel suppliers to ensure that 5% of <b>all</b> <b>road</b> vehicle fuel comes from sustainable renewable sources by 2010.|$|E
25|$|In the USA, {{two-thirds of}} cyclists {{admitted}} to hospital have a head injury. Ninety percent of cyclist deaths {{are caused by}} collisions with motor vehicles. For cyclists admitted to hospital in Western Australia before the helmet law, about 30% of cyclists and 30% of pedestrians had head injuries. Trends and proportions of cyclists admitted to hospital with head injury were similar for <b>all</b> <b>road</b> users.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of the loss of <b>all</b> <b>road</b> and {{footbridges}} in Workington, it was announced that a new temporary railway station, Workington North, would be built on waste land leased for two years from Allerdale Council. The station was scheduled to open by 28 November with services provided by Northern Rail. Workington North opened on 30 November 2009 and remained open for a year.|$|E

50|$|County councils gained {{increased}} {{powers as}} the ultimate highway authority for <b>all</b> <b>roads</b> in the county.

25|$|The {{success of}} the {{currency}} reform angered the Soviets, who cut off <b>all</b> <b>road,</b> rail, and canal links between the western zones and West Berlin. This was the Berlin Blockade, which lasted from 24 June 1948 to 12 May 1949. In response, the U.S. and Britain launched an airlift of food and coal and distributed the new currency in West Berlin as well. The city thereby became economically integrated into West Germany.|$|E
25|$|Since 1993 the London Air Quality Network of King's College London has {{coordinated the}} {{monitoring}} {{of air pollution}} across 30 London boroughs and Heathrow, and has noted that in 2005–06 almost <b>all</b> <b>road</b> and curbside monitoring sites across greater London exceeded the annual average limits for nitrogen dioxide of 40 μgm-3 (21 ppb), with eleven sites exceeding the hourly limits of 200 μgm-3 (105 ppb) on at least 18 occasions each.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} parking {{buildings}} for car-owned {{people working in}} downtown. Taxi cabs are also available for people working in downtown. Because it is the leading business district in the metropolis, it sometimes experience traffic congestion. The Metropolitan Manila Development Authority is responsible for traffic regulation in the metropolis. In 1995, they implement road space rationing called Unified Vehicular Volume Reduction Program to reduce the traffic congestion. In Makati, they implement the number coding to <b>all</b> <b>road</b> vehicles from 7:00a.m. to 7:00p.m. with window hours of 10:00a.m. to 3:00p.m., except on freeways.|$|E

25|$|Historically a Dutch-speaking city, Brussels {{has seen}} a {{language}} shift to French from the late 19th century onwards. Today, the majority language is French, and the Brussels-Capital Region is an officially bilingual enclave within the Flemish Region. <b>All</b> <b>road</b> signs, street names, and many advertisements and services are shown in both languages. Brussels is increasingly becoming multilingual, being home to many international institutions. English is spoken {{as a second language}} by {{nearly a third of the}} population, while a large number of migrants and expatriates speak other languages, namely Arabic, Spanish, German and Italian.|$|E
25|$|The {{song was}} written in October 1968, {{intended}} for the album The Beatles, but left off because of time constraints. It was rehearsed again three months later, in January 1969, at Twickenham film studios during the Get Back sessions but would not be recorded for another six months. The film features two brief rehearsal takes compiled together showing the band's progress on the song {{up to that point}} in time. Lennon is shown to be participating on electric guitar despite not featuring on the recording for Abbey Road at <b>all.</b> <b>Road</b> manager and Beatles associate Mal Evans participates by providing the anvil hits.|$|E
25|$|The {{introduction}} of the new currency was intended to protect western Germany from a second wave of hyperinflation and to stop the rampant barter and black market trade (where American cigarettes acted as currency). Although the new currency was initially only distributed in the three western occupation zones outside Berlin, the move angered the Soviet authorities, who regarded it as a threat. The Soviets promptly cut off <b>all</b> <b>road,</b> rail and canal links between the three western zones and West Berlin, starting the Berlin Blockade. In response, the U.S. and Britain launched an airlift of food and coal and distributed the new currency in West Berlin as well.|$|E
