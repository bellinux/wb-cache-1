In the IAC (internal auditory canal) decompression, a middle fossa approach is employed to expose the bony roof of the IAC without any attempt to remove the tumor. The bone overlying the <b>acoustic</b> <b>nerve</b> is removed, allowing the tumour to expand upward into the middle cranial fossa. In this way, pressure on the cochlear nerve is relieved, {{reducing the risk of}} further hearing loss from direct compression or obstruction of vascular supply to the nerve.|$|E

40|$|AIM: The {{long-term}} effects of radiosurgery of vestibular schwannomas were investigated {{in a group of}} consecutively treated patients. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between 1995 and 2001, 26 patients (median age: 67, range: 30 - 82) with a vestibular schwannoma were treated by Linac-based stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). The median follow-up was 49 months (16 - 85 months). Only progressive tumours were treated. The median size of tumours was 18 mm (range 9 - 30 mm). Before SRS, 11 patients had a useful hearing (Gardner-Robertson classes 1 and 2). Single doses of 10 - 14 Gy were prescribed at the 80 % isodose at the tumour margin. The follow-up consisted of regular imaging with MRI the first 3 - 6 months after the intervention, followed by additional yearly MRIs, a hearing test and a neurological examination. RESULT: The 5 -year-probability of tumour control (defined as stabilization or decrease in size) was 95 %. Five-year-probability of preservation of hearing and facial nerve function was 96 % and 100 %, respectively. Hearing was preserved in 10 out of 11 patients who had a normal or useful hearing at the time of treatment. Mild and transient trigeminal toxicity occurred in 2 (8 %) patients. It appeared to be significantly correlated to the dose used (p= 0. 044). However, only a tendency to significance could be demonstrated in {{the relationship between the two}} factors when using the Cox analysis (hazard ratio= 1. 7; 95 % CI: 0. 7 - 3. 9; p= 0. 23). CONCLUSIONS: With the doses used, our study demonstrates that SRS provides an equivalent tumour control rate when compared to surgery, as well as on a long-term basis, an excellent preservation of the facial and the <b>acoustic</b> <b>nerves.</b> Although no permanent trigeminal toxicity was observed, our data confirm that doses below 14 Gy can avoid transient dysesthesias.

In 1989, to alleviate the condition, he underwent surgery after which he suffered a cerebellar hemorrhage and a subsequent stroke. [...] Jon awoke from the surgery deaf in one ear, his vision splintered, and his balance permanently skewed.

5000|$|The {{mechanisms}} of subjective tinnitus are often obscure. While {{it is not}} surprising that direct trauma to the inner ear can cause tinnitus, other apparent causes (e.g., temporomandibular joint dysfunction and dental disorders) are difficult to explain. Research has proposed there are two distinct categories of subjective tinnitus: otic tinnitus, caused by disorders of the inner ear or the <b>acoustic</b> <b>nerve,</b> and somatic tinnitus, caused by disorders outside the ear and nerve, but still within the head or neck. It is further hypothesized somatic tinnitus may be due to [...] "central crosstalk" [...] within the brain, as certain head and neck nerves enter the brain near regions known to be involved in hearing.|$|E
40|$|In {{a series}} of 179 cerebellopontine angle (CPA) tumors, the authors present nine cases (5 %) that were {{cochlear}} nerve neuromas. There were six men and three women (mean age, 51 years). Preoperative magnetic resonance imaging confirmed the diagnosis in one case with a labyrinthine extension and raised suspicions in the other four cases, which were confirmed during surgery.

40|$|Objective To perform {{quantitative}} {{comparison of}} microanatomical features between subtemporal and presigmoidal minimally invasive approaches for exposing petrous apex {{on the basis}} of virtual reality image model.   Methods CT and MRI were performed on 15 adult cadaver heads (30 sides) to establish virtual reality three-dimensional anatomical model of petrous apex. The superior edge of the root of temporal bone zygomatic process and the mastoidale on the calvaria were selected as landmark points of craniotomy through subtempral and presigmoidal approaches. Petrous apex was selected as exposure landmark point on the skull base. The lines between craniotomy and exposure landmark points were used as axis to outline a cylinder simulating surgical routes of subtemporal and presigmoidal approaches. Anatomical exposures in two surgical routes were observed and measured. Statistical comparison was launched by paired t test.   Results Surgical route of subtemporal approach passed through middle skull base and temporal lobe, and then reached petrous apex. Petrous bone drilling was performed to expose internal <b>acoustic</b> meatus, facial <b>nerve</b> and labyrinth. Then, trigeminal nerve, superior petrous sinus and cavernous sinus were exposed. Surgical route of presigmoidal approach was performed by drilling petrous bone through mastoid and passing vertical segment of facial nerve. Then, glomus jugulare, the lower cranial nerves, ossicular chain, labyrinth and internal carotid artery (ICA) were exposed in turn.  Reaching internal acoustic meatus, the route exposed anterior inferior cerebellar artery (AICA) and facial-acoustic nerve complex. Reaching petrous apex, the route involved superior cerebellar artery, superior petrous sinus, inferior petrous sinus, cavernous sinus, trigeminal nerve and partial temporal lobe. The volumes of route, osseous structures, facial-acoustic complex, labyrinth and vein involved in presigmoidal approach were more than those in subtemporal approach (P = 0. 000, for all). Volumes of temporal lobe, trigeminal nerve and ossicular chain involved in subtemporal approach were more than those in presigmoidal approach (P = 0. 000, for all). Volume of lower cranial nerve and artery involved in presigmoidal approach was (32. 38 ± 2. 86) mm 3 and (262. 74 ± 16. 93) mm 3 respectively, but above structures were not involved in subtemporal approach.   Conclusions Exposure of structures in and around petrous bone in presigmoidal approach is more than that in subtemporal approach. Thus, more attention should be paid to protect critical structures in presigmoidal approach. Subtemporal approach can reach petrous apex through temporal lobe, thus it is suitable to treat lesions in middle skull base which implicate petrous bone and push temporal lobe upward.   DOI: 10. 3969 /j. issn. 1672 - 6731. 2016. 07. 008 </p...|$|R
