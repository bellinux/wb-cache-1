40|$|Objective: We {{aimed to}} report the prevalence, age-of-onset and {{comorbidity}} of mood and anxiety disorders in an age-stratified representative sample of Australian women aged 20 years and over. Method: Mood and anxiety disorders were diagnosed utilising a clinical interview (SCID-I/NP). The lifetime <b>and</b> <b>current</b> <b>prevalence</b> <b>of</b> these disorders was determined from the study population (n = 1095) and standardized to 2006 census data for Australia. Results: Approximately one in three women (34. 8 %) reported a lifetime history of any mood and/or anxiety disorder, with mood disorders (30. 0 %) being more prevalent than anxiety disorders (13. 5 %). Of these, major depression (23. 4 %), panic disorder (5. 5 %) and specific phobia (3. 5 %) were the most common. The lifetime prevalence of other disorders was low (≤ 3 %). A total of 14. 4 % of women were identified as having a current mood and/or anxiety disorder, with similar rates of mood (8. 9 %) and anxiety disorders (8. 0 %) observed.  The median age-of-onset for mood disorders was 27. 0 years and 18. 5 years for anxiety disorders. Conclusions: This study reports the lifetime <b>and</b> <b>current</b> <b>prevalence</b> <b>of</b> mood and anxiety disorders in the Australian female population.

The same cumulative sequence of drug use appeared in the survey data for French and Israeli adolescents as in comparative data for adolescents in the United States [...] cigarette and alcohol use preceded the use of illicit drugs. Striking cross-cultural differences appeared in the overall lifetime <b>and</b> <b>current</b> <b>prevalences</b> <b>of</b> use of all drugs, in the frequency of use, and in the age- and sex-specific rates for adolescents in Israel and in France. French youths uniformly reported greater lifetime <b>and</b> <b>current</b> use of all alcoholic beverages, cigarettes, and illegal drugs, more extensive involvement, and smaller sex differences than the Israeli youths. <b>Prevalence</b> <b>of</b> the use of drugs in a culture appears to be associated with four social processes: higher number of times each drug has been used; greater persistence of involvement, as reflected by the proportions of current users among those who ever tried a particular drug; earlier age of first use; and a spread of the phenomenon throughout all groups in society that attenuates group differences in drug experiences. These cross-cultural results suggest a relatively conservative position with regard to accessibility and availability of substances: reducing availability may be one way to reduce individual consumption by impinging not on individual persons directly but on society...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Given {{the burden}} of common {{psychiatric}} disorders and their consequent service and planning requirements, {{it is important to}} have a thorough knowledge of their distribution and characteristics in the population. Thus, we aimed to report the prevalence and age of onset of mood, anxiety and substance-use disorders in an age-stratified representative sample of Australian men. METHOD: Psychiatric disorders (mood, anxiety and substance-use disorders) were diagnosed utilising a structured clinical interview (Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-Fourth Edition, Non-Patient Edition) for 961 men aged 24 - 98  years enrolled in the Geelong Osteoporosis Study. The lifetime <b>and</b> <b>current</b> <b>prevalence</b> <b>of</b> these disorders was determined from the study population and standardised to 2006 census data for Australia. RESULTS: Approximately one in three men (28. 8 %, 95 % confidence interval [CI] = [26. 8 %, 30. 8 %]) reported a lifetime history of any psychiatric disorder, with mood disorders (18. 2 %, 95 % CI = [15. 2 %, 21. 2 %]) being more prevalent than anxiety (7. 2 %, 95 % CI = [5. 0 %, 9. 4 %]) and substance-use disorders (12. 9 %, 95 % CI = [9. 7 %, 16. 0 %]). Approximately 8. 7 % (95 % CI = [7. 5 %, 10. 0 %]) were identified as having a current disorder, with 3. 8 % (95 % interquartile range [IQR] = [2. 2 %, 5. 4 %]), 2. 4 % (95 % CI = [1. 1 %, 3. 8 %]) and 3. 4 % (95 % CI = [1. 8 %, 4. 9 %]) meeting criteria for current mood, anxiety and substance-use disorders, respectively. The median age of onset for mood disorders was 37. 5  years (IQR =  27. 0 - 48. 0  years), 25. 0  years (IQR =  20. 0 - 40. 3  years) for anxiety and 22. 0  years (IQR =  18. 0 - 34. 3  years) for substance-use disorders.

Associations among injuries, PTSD, and postconcussive symptoms were explored. In February 2005, a postal survey was sent to Iraq/Afghanistan veterans who had left combat theaters by September 2004 and lived in Maryland; Washington, DC; northern Virginia; and eastern West Virginia. Immediate neurologic symptoms postinjury were used to identify mild TBI. Adjusted prev-alence ratios and 95 % confidence intervals were computed by using Poisson regression. About 12 % of 2, 235 respondents reported a history consistent with mild TBI, and 11 % screened positive for PTSD. Mild TBI history was common among veterans injured by bullets/shrapnel, blasts, motor vehicle crashes, air/water transport, and falls. Factors associated with PTSD included reporting multiple injury mechanisms (prevalence ratio 3. 71 for three or more mechanisms, 95 % confidence interval: 2. 23, 6. 19) and combat mild TBI (prevalence ratio 2. 37, 95 % confidence interval: 1. 72, 3. 28).

Method: A cross-sectional study {{of a total of}} 65 HIV sero-negative (HIV-) and 164 HIV sero-positive men (HIV+) (79 CDC stage II/III and 85 CDC stage IV) was conducted in three centres. Lifetime <b>and</b> <b>current</b> <b>prevalence</b> rates <b>of</b> psychiatric disorder were evaluated using the Diagnostic Interview Schedule Version IIIR (DIS-IIIR). Results: Elevated <b>current</b> <b>and</b> lifetime rates of major depression were detected in both HIV negative and HIV positive homosexual/bisexual men. Lifetime rates of alcohol abuse/dependence were significantly elevated in HIV positive men (CDC group IV) when compared with HIV negative men. Among the HIV positive group the majority of psychiatric disorders detected were preceded by a pre-HIV diagnosis of psychiatric disorder. Major depression represented the disorder most likely to have first onset after HIV infection diagnosis. Conclusions: Lifetime rates of major depression were elevated in this sample of HIV-negative and HIV-positive men. In the HIV-positive men, psychiatric disorder was significantly associated with the presence of lifetime psychiatric disorder prior to HIV infection diagnosis.

40|$|Over {{the past}} 20 years the {{combined}} effects of El Niño-induced droughts and land-use change have dramatically increased {{the frequency of}} fire in humid tropical forests.

Overall, this study supports predictions that rates of tree mortality and changes in forest structure are strongly linked to burn severity. The potential consequences for biomass loss and carbon emissions are explored. Despite the paucity of data on faunal responses to tropical forest fires, some trends are becoming apparent; for example, large canopy frugivores and understorey insectivorous birds appear to be highly sensitive to changes in forest structure and composition during the first 3 years after fires.

Research, mostly conducted in developed countries, has identified some likely factors responsible for violence and has also explored attitudes that could be supportive of abuse. However, developing countries around the world, especially those in Africa, are still far behind in making tangible impact on exploring these issues. Considering this paucity of information and with the aim of contributing to the IPV knowledge base in the developing world, a cross-sectional population-based survey involving 719 Nigerian women (aged 18 years and above, currently or previously in cohabiting or non-cohabiting relationships) was conducted using a detailed pretested questionnaire to solicit data on demographics, socioeconomic, attitudinal, and behavioral characteristics, as well as those pertaining to experiences of IPV. On performing relevant descriptive statistical analyses on the data collected, the results show that lifetime <b>and</b> <b>current</b> <b>prevalence</b> <b>of</b> IPV are 25. 5 % and 16. 7 %, respectively. There is also an indication that women across urban and rural areas have a relatively high level of acceptance towards IPV (wife-beating).

Data were collected by a school survey among a sample of 6, 787 9 th-grade students in Switzerland. Roughly 56 % of the adolescents (females 56. 6 %; males 55. 7 %) reported having experienced at least 1 TE. Non-Swiss nationality (OR = 1. 80), not living with both biological parents (OR = 1. 64), and lower parental education (OR = 1. 18) were associated with a higher risk of trauma exposure.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To review {{repeated}} {{surveys of}} the rising prevalence of obstructive lung disease among {{children and young adults}} and determine whether systematic biases may explain the observed trends. DESIGN: Review of published reports of repeated cross sectional surveys of asthma and wheezing among children and young adults. The repeated surveys used the same sampling frame, the same definition of outcome variables, and equivalent data collection methods. SETTING: Repeated surveys conducted anywhere in the world. SUBJECTS: All repeated surveys whose last set of results were published in 1983 or later. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Lifetime and current prevalences of asthma <b>and</b> <b>current</b> <b>prevalence</b> <b>of</b> wheezing. The absolute increase (yearly percentage) in the prevalences of asthma and wheezing was calculated and compared between studies. RESULTS: 16 repeated surveys fulfilled the inclusion criteria. 12 reported increases in the current prevalence of asthma (from 0. 09 % to 0. 97 % a year) and eight reported increases in the current prevalence of wheezing (from 0. 14 % to 1. 24 % a year). Changes in labelling are likely to have occurred for the reporting of asthma, and information biases may have occurred for the reporting of wheezing. Only one study reported an increase in an objective measurement. CONCLUSIONS: The evidence for increased prevalences of asthma and wheezing is weak because the measures used are susceptible to systematic errors. Until repeated surveys incorporating more objective data are available no firm conclusions about increases in obstructive lung disease among children and young adults can be drawn...|$|E
40|$|Background: This study {{presents}} estimates <b>of</b> 12 month <b>and</b> <b>current</b> <b>prevalences</b> <b>of</b> DSM-IV disorders, <b>and</b> {{the related}} comor-bidity, disability and service utilization, {{derived from a}} national probability sample in Australia. Methods: The DSM-IV psychiatric disorders among persons aged 18 and over in the Australian population were assessed with data collected by lay interviewers using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview, other screening interviews and measures of disability and service utilization. The response rate was 78. 1 % and the final sample size was 10, 641 adults. Results: Close to 20 % reported at least one twelve month disorder and 13 % a disorder current within the past 30 days. ICD- 10 diagnoses were also derived, DSM-IV was the more conservative classification {{whether or not the}} new clinical significance criteria was applied. Major depression, any personality disorder, and alcohol dependence were the three most common twelve month disorders, generalized anxiety disorder replaced alcohol dependence as the third most common current disorder. The sexes has similar rates of any disorder, but women had higher rates of affective and anxiety disorders, men higher rates of substance use disorders. <b>Prevalence</b> <b>of</b> most disorders declined with age and education, and were lower among those employed or married. Respondents whose symptoms met criteria for three or more disorders in the past year had greatly increased rates of disability and of mental health consultations. The affective and somatoform disorders were associated with the highest rates of disability. Only 36 % of people with a mental disorder this year had consulted for a mental problem, and most had seen a general practitioner. We identified those with a current disorder who were disabled or multiply comorbid - only half had consulted and of those who had not, more than half said they did not need treatment. Conclusions: The 12 month prevalence was lower than reported in the US National Comorbidity Survey but method factors might account for this. The relationships between prevalence and demographic variables, and between comorbidity, disability and service utilization were similar to those found in the US survey. Australia has a national health insurance scheme with total coverage and access to medical help is available to all, commonly at little or no cost. We identify the high rate of not consulting among those with a <b>current</b> disorder, <b>and</b> additional disability or multiple comorbidity, as an important public health problem.

40|$|AbstractThe {{average age}} of the global human {{population}} is increasing, leading to increased interest in the effects of chronic disease and multimorbidity on health resources and patient welfare. It has been posited that the {{average age of}} the general veterinarian-attended horse population of the UK is also increasing, and therefore it could be assumed that chronic diseases and multimorbidity would pose an increasing risk here also. However, evidence for this trend in ageing is very limited, <b>and</b> the <b>current</b> <b>prevalence</b> <b>of</b> many chronic diseases, and of multimorbidity, is unknown. Using text mining of first-opinion electronic medical records from seven veterinary practices around the UK, Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazard modelling, we were able to estimate the apparent prevalence among veterinarian-attended horses of nine chronic diseases, and to assess their relative effects on median life expectancy following diagnosis. With these methods we found evidence of increasing population age. Multimorbidity affected 1. 2 % of the study population, and had a significant effect upon survival times, with co-occurrence of two diseases, and three or more diseases, leading to 6. 6 and 21. 3 times the hazard ratio compared to no chronic disease, respectively. Laminitis was involved in 74 % of cases of multimorbidity. The population of horses attended by UK veterinarians appears to be aging, and chronic diseases and their co-occurrence are common features, and as such warrant further investigation...|$|R

Factors that were significantly associated with thumb problems included: working in orthopaedic outpatients (OR 3. 2, 95 % CI 1. 8 to 5. 8); using manual therapy (OR 2. 3 to 3. 4, 95 % CI 1. 7 to 5. 1), trigger point therapy (OR 2. 3, 95 % CI 1. 7 to 3. 0) and massage (OR 2. 1, 95 % CI 1. 6 to 2. 8); having thumb joint hypermobility (OR 2. 2 to 2. 6, 95 % CI 1. 4 to 4. 5); or an inability to stabilise the joints of the thumb whilst performing physiotherapy techniques (OR 4. 2, 95 % CI 2. 9 to 5. 9). Of those respondents who reported thumb problems, 19 % had changed their area of practice and 4 % had left the profession {{as a result of their}} thumb problems. ConclusionThe prevalence of thumb problems in Australian physiotherapists appears to be high and can be of sufficient severity to impact on careers...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} whether Screening, Brief Intervention and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) {{can reduce the}} prevalence of tobacco use in rural and semi-rural settings. Method: Design and participants: A non-randomized clinical trial with assessments at baseline and post-intervention assessments at 3 and 6 months was conducted in a rural and semi-rural district in South-West of Nigeria. A representative sample of 1203 persons consented to the study and had ASSIST administered to them by trained community healthcare extension workers between October, 2010 and April, 2011. Follow-up participation was more than 99 % at all points. Intervention: Participants received a single ASSIST linked brief intervention (BI) and referral for treatment (RT) at entry, and a booster ASSIST BI and RT at 3 months. Main outcomes and measures: The primary outcome was self-reported scores on ASSIST. Results: At baseline, out of 1203 respondents, lifetime prevalence <b>and</b> <b>current</b> <b>prevalence</b> <b>of</b> any tobacco products was 405 (33. 7 %) and 248 (20. 6 %) respectively. Of the current users, on the ASSIST, 79 (31. 9 %) scored 0 - 3 (low health risk), 130 (52. 4 %) scored 4 - 26 (moderate risk), 39 (15. 7 %) scored 27 + (high risk). At 3 months, out of 1199 respondents, prevalence of current users was 199 (16. 5 %) and out of 1195 respondents, was 169 (14. 1 %) at 6 months. Prevalence of tobacco use reduced significantly at 3 months Z = - 3. 1, p = 0. 01 and at 6 months when compared with baseline Z = 4. 2, p = 0. 001, but not at 6 months compared with at 3 months, Z = 2. 1, p = 0. 09. Multivariate analysis revealed that age at initiation of tobacco use, gender, marital status, setting of dwelling and socioeconomic status were the only variables that were associated with current tobacco use at baseline, 3 months and 6 months. Conclusion: A one-time BI with a booster at 3 months {{had a significant effect}} on tobacco use in persons living in community settings. This finding suggests a need for promoting the adoption of this intervention for tobacco use in rural and semi-rural community settings...|$|E
40|$|Over {{almost the}} past 3 decades, the {{prevalence}} ofobesity, {{defined by a}} body mass index (BMI) of 30 or higher, has increased {{in many parts of}} the world. In Canada, the prevalence of obesity began to increase steadily in the 1980 s. According to the 1985 Canadian Health Promotion Survey, about 6. 1 % of Canadian adults were found to be obese, compared with 18. 1 % reported from the findings of the 2010 Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS). 1 – 3 These national figures mask the substan-tial provincial variations that exist. 4, 5 Obese people are at an increased risk of hypertension, type 2 diabetes, sleep apnea and cancer. 6 – 8 Excess body weight can also affect quality of life, education and income potential, 9 – 11 and increase the risk of premature death. 12, 13 Obesity is often categorized by BMI to reflect the increasing health risk of excess weight: class I (BMI 30. 0 – 34. 9), class II (BMI 35. 0 – 39. 9) and class III (BMI ≥ 40. 0). 14, 15 The latter 2 categories are linked to much higher levels of morbidity, increased demands on the health care system and premature death. 16 – 19 There has been a disproportionate increase in people within obesity classes II and III in Canada. 2, 20 Taking into account figures for the past 2 decades, the annual economic burden of obesity is now estimated to be between $ 4. 6 billion and $ 7. 1 billion, 21, 22 and it has been suggested that obesity contributes as much as, if not more than, smoking to the onset of disease. 23 The purpose of this paper is to present the data for the past (10 yr) <b>and</b> <b>current</b> <b>prevalence</b> <b>of</b> adult obesity in Canada, together with future estimates. These data are important in monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness of population-and community-wide interventions aimed at reducing obesity, as well as in estimating the future burden on the health care system of disease associated with excess body weight.

40|$|Coloured filters, in {{the form}} of plastic {{overlays}} or tinted spectacle lenses, are in widespread use to alleviate visual stress (also known as Irlen Syndrome), a disorder posited to be a major cause of reading disability (Irlen, 1991; Wilkins, 2003). However, a recent systematic review (Albon et al., 2008) concluded that the evidence for the efficacy of coloured filters is insufficient to recommend the treatment. The existence of visual stress as a diagnostic entity has also been questioned (Royal College of Opthalmologists, 2009). This thesis first describes the various theoretical perspectives behind the use of coloured filters, and provides an in-depth review of the current evidence. A combined crossover study and randomised controlled trial of the coloured filters used by the Irlen Institute, the major proponent of the treatment, is then described. This experiment, which set out to avoid the methodological problems observed in previous trials - most importantly, double-blinding was employed - failed to find any evidence of visual stress, or for the statistically or clinically significant benefit of coloured overlays for reading rate or comprehension on two separate reading tests, in a sample of 61 Primary School-age children with reading problems. This was despite 77 % of the sample having been diagnosed with visual stress by an Irlen diagnostician and prescribed coloured overlays. Visual stress theory <b>and</b> the <b>current</b> <b>prevalence</b> <b>of</b> the coloured filter treatment are discussed in the light of this new evidence...|$|R
40|$|Background: recent {{research}} shows that severe/very severe post-migration living difficulties (PMLD) {{have a negative impact}} on the mental health and social integration of refugees and asylum seekers. This study focuses on the role of PMLD in primary care “ordinary” immigrants. Methods: 443 primary care immigrants were asked to complete a self-administered questionnaire measuring the number and severity of pre-migratory potentially traumatic events (PTE), PMLD, <b>and</b> the <b>current</b> <b>prevalence</b> <b>of</b> a post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The frequency of PMLD was assessed in the whole sample and compared in patients with and without PTSD. The effect of the number of PMLD on the risk of having a PTSD was studied by means of a regression analysis, adjusted by the number of PTE. Results: 391 patients completed the questionnaire and were enrolled into the study. The <b>prevalence</b> <b>of</b> PTSD was 10. 2 %. In the whole sample the most frequent PMLD were “no permission to work” (38. 6 %) and “poverty” (34. 5 %). All PMLD (except “communication difficulties”) were more frequent in patients with a PTSD. The number of PMLD significantly increased the likelihood to have a PTSD independently from PTE. Conclusions: severe/very severe post-migration living difficulties (PMLD) increase significantly the risk of PTSD in primary care “ordinary” migrants. Our hypothesis is that they have a retraumatizing effect on individuals who are already vulnerable and with a low capacity to handle resettlement stress due to their previous traumatic history. The implications in clinical practice and for immigration policies are discussed...|$|R
40|$|A {{cross-sectional}} study {{was performed to}} investigate the <b>prevalence</b> and predictors <b>of</b> suicidal ideation and past suicide attempt in an Australian sample of human imumunodeficiency virus (HIV) -positive and HIV-negative homosexual and bisexual men. Sixty-five HIV-negative and 164 HIV-positive men participated. A suicidal ideation score was derived from using five items selected from the Beck Depression Inventory and the General Health Questionnaire (28 -item version). Lifetime <b>and</b> <b>current</b> <b>prevalence</b> rates <b>of</b> psychiatric disorder were evaluated with the Diagnostic Interview Schedule Version-III-R. The HIV-positive (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] Stage IV) men (n = 85) had significantly higher total suicidal ideation scores than the asymptomatic HIV-positive men (CDC Stage II/III) (n = 79) and the HIV-negative men. High rates of past suicide attempt were detected in the HIV-negative (29 %) and HIV-positive men (21 %). Factors associated with suicidal ideation included being HIV positive, the presence of current psychiatric disorder, higher neuroticism scores, external locus of control, <b>and</b> <b>current</b> unemployment. In the HIV-positive group analyzed separately, higher suicidal ideation was discriminated by the adjustment to HIV diagnosis (greater hopelessness and lower fighting spirit), disease factors (greater number of current acquired immunodeficiency syndrome [AIDS]-related conditions), and background variables (neuroticism). Significant predictors of a past attempted suicide were a positive lifetime history of psychiatric disorder (particularly depression diagnoses), a life-time history of injection drug use, and {{a family history of}} suicide attempts. The findings indicate increased levels of suicidal ideation in symptomatic HIV-positive men and high-light the role that multiple psychosocial factors associated with suicidal ideation and attempted suicide play in this population...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND [...] The {{prevalence}} and morbidity of asthma vary greatly among different ethnic communities and geographical locations, but {{the roles of}} environmental and genetic factors are not fully understood. The differences in prevalence of adult asthma among Chinese, Malay, and Indian ethnic groups in Singapore were examined, {{and the extent to}} which these could be explained by personal and environmental factors were investigated. METHODS [...] A stratified disproportionate random sample (n = 2868) of Chinese (n = 1018), Malays (n = 967), and Indians (n = 883) of both sexes was drawn from households in five public housing estates, and an interviewer administered questionnaire was used to determine cumulative <b>and</b> <b>current</b> <b>prevalence</b> <b>of</b> "physician diagnosed asthma" (symptoms with a physician diagnosis of asthma). RESULTS [...] Lifetime cumulative prevalence (standardised to the general population) of "physician diagnosed asthma" was 4. 7 % in men and 4. 3 % in women; 12 month period prevalences were 2. 4 % and 2. 0 %, respectively. Cumulative prevalence of asthma was significantly higher in Indians (6. 6 %) and Malays (6. 0 %) than in Chinese (3. 0 %); period prevalences of asthma were 4. 5 % in Indians, 3. 3 % in Malays, and 0. 9 % in Chinese. Ownership of cats or dogs was more frequent in Malays (15. 4 %) and Indians (11. 2 %) than in Chinese (8. 8 %). Rugs and carpets were also more frequently used by Malays (52. 2 %) and Indians (40. 7 %) than by Chinese (8. 9 %). Current smoking prevalences were higher in Malays (27. 3 %) than in Indians (19. 4 %) and Chinese (23. 0 %). Malays and Indians did not have higher rates of atopy (11. 1 % and 15. 2 %, respectively) than Chinese (15. 4 %). Adjustment for these factors in multivariate analyses reduced the greater odds of asthma in Malays and Indians, but not to a significant extent. CONCLUSIONS [...] There are ethnic differences in the prevalence of asthma in Singapore which are not entirely explained by differences in smoking, atopy, or other risk factors. Other unmeasured environmental factors or genetic influences are likely to account for residual differences in the prevalence of asthma...|$|E
40|$|Objective: Prisoners with {{intellectual}} disability {{who have a}} coexisting mental health issue often have unmet health needs {{and are more likely}} to reoffend than those with {{intellectual disability}} alone. The aims of this study were to estimate the prevalence of co-occurring mental disorder among prisoners with intellectual disability and to explore the association between intellectual disability and mental disorder. Methods: Cross-sectional study of adult prisoners within 6 weeks of release from custody in seven prisons in Queensland, Australia between August 2008 and July 2010. Intellectual disability was assessed using a practical composite screening tool. Prisoners who scored < 85 on the Hayes Ability Screening Index and reported either having attended a special school or having been diagnosed with intellectual disability were identified as having an intellectual disability. Mental health was assessed using self-reported psychiatric diagnoses, the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K- 10), and the Mental Component Summary score of the Short-Form- 36 health survey version 2. The association between intellectual disability and mental health was assessed using univariate and multivariate logistic regression. Results: Overall, 1279 prisoners completed the HASI: 316 (24 %) scored below the recommended cut off for further diagnostic assessment of intellectual disability, 181 (14 %) reported attending a special school, and 56 (4 %) reported that they had been diagnosed with an intellectual disability. On our composite measure, 115 (9 %) participants were identified as having an intellectual disability. Among prisoners with intellectual disability, the estimated lifetime <b>and</b> <b>current</b> <b>prevalence</b> <b>of</b> co-occurring mental disorders was 52. 5 % (95 % CI 43. 3 - 61. 5) and 37. 2 % (95 % CI 28. 8 - 46. 5), respectively. Of those with intellectual disability, 13. 5 % (95 % CI 8. 3 - 21. 1) reported very high psychological distress, as measured by the K 10. Prisoners with intellectual disability were significantly more likely than their non-disabled peers to report a current diagnosis of depression [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 1. 8, 95 % CI 1. 1 - 3. 2] or substance dependence (AOR 3. 7, 95 % CI 1. 6 - 8. 4], after adjusting for potentially confounding variables. Prisoners with intellectual disability were also significantly more likely than their non-disabled peers to use antipsychotic medication (AOR 1. 7, 95 % CI 1. 0 - 2. 8). Conclusions: Prisoners with an intellectual disability were more likely than their non-disabled peers to have elevated rates of psychiatric comorbidity and unmet treatment needs. There is a need for enhanced collaboration between specialist intellectual disability psychiatric services and mainstream prison mental health services, to ensure coordinated service delivery for this dually disadvantaged group.

40|$|Magister Scientiae (Physiotherapy) - MSc(Physio) Playing related {{musculoskeletal}} disorder (PRMD) is common among instrumentalists, professionals, amateurs and music {{students with a}} prevalence ranging from 39 - 47 % with an impact on playing and performance. This is synonymous to the prevalence of {{musculoskeletal disorder}}s among other work population. Risk factors such as lack of warm ups, awkward posture, long playing hours and bad techniques has been consistently indicated as risk factors influencing the incidence of PRMDs among instrumentalists. The {{aim of this study}} is to design a warm up programme for instrumentalists. The study population and sample are instrumentalists at the Centre for Performing Arts, University of the Western Cape. A cross sectional study design with a quantitative approach was utilized in this study to determine the prevalence, severity, distribution of PRMDs and its association with quality of life. All the instrumentalists learning or playing a musical instrument of the Centre for Performing Arts was approached to participate in this study. In the first phase of the study, a self administered questionnaire was used to collect data regarding prevalence, distribution and the severity of PRMDs and health related quality of life. The instruments for this study are the standard NORDIC questionnaire for musculoskeletal disorders to determine pain distribution and prevalence, the visual analogue scale to determine the pain severity and the WHOQOL –BREF, a quality of life questionnaire and an adapted questionnaire to determine the knowledge of instrumentalists about injury prevention strategies. The second phase of the study, a systematic review of evidence was done on the pattern of warm up and practice habits of instrumentalists. The third phase of the study to design the content of the study was done using a Delphi study. The Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) was used for descriptive and inferential statistics. Chi square was used to determine the association of prevalence, distribution and severity on quality of life. Alpha level was set at 0. 05. Ethical clearance and permission to conduct study was sought, written informed consents from participants was sought clearly stating the right to participate and withdraw from study was respected and anonymity and confidentiality was be ensured. The results of the study show that 82. 4 % lifetime prevalence <b>and</b> <b>current</b> <b>prevalence</b> <b>of</b> 23. 5 % among instrumental musicians in a Centre for Performing Arts. The shoulder (41. 2 %), neck (29. 4 %) and the wrists and hands (29. 4 %) are the mostly affected region on the body. The most common symptoms are tightness and soreness. However, the results of the systematic review shows that there is a lack of operational term for warm up in the performing arts and this therefore could be responsible for the variations in the influence of warm up on the prevention of PRMDs. The content of the warm up programme was designed using a Delphi study and stretching and postural awareness were included with musical warm up as part of a regular warm up exercise, although, consensus was not reached on the duration of the warm up programme. Strengthening and conditioning were included to in a different exercise program done three times per week. Education on injury prevention strategies were also included in the programme and the mode of instruction agreed on was active learning and group instruction in classroom. The role of warm up exercise in the prevention of PRMDs using this model could reduce the incidence of PRMDs. However, it is important to note that the programme should be tested in order to determine the overall effect it has on PRMDs. South Afric...|$|E
40|$|Objectives To {{quantify}} {{the burden of}} disease attributable to smoking in South Africa for 2000. Design The absolute difference between observed lung cancer death rate and the level in non-smokers, adjusted for occupational and indoor exposure to lung carcinogens, was used to estimate the proportion of lung cancer deaths attributable to smoking and the smoking impact ratio (SIR). The SIR was substituted for smoking prevalence in the attributable fraction formula for {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD) and cancers to allow for the long lag between exposure and outcome. Assuming a shorter lag between exposure <b>and</b> disease, the <b>current</b> <b>prevalence</b> <b>of</b> smoking was used to estimate the population-attributable fractions (PAF) for the other outcomes. Relative risks (RR) from the American Cancer Society cancer prevention study (CPS-II) were used to calculate PAF. Setting South Africa.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: This study {{examined}} the relationship between binge eating disorder (BED), a newly proposed eating disorder, and bulimia nervosa (BN). METHOD: Three groups recruited from the community were compared: women with BED (n = 150), women with purging BN (n = 48), and women with nonpurging BN (n = 14). RESULTS: The three groups did not differ significantly in education, weight or shape concern, <b>and</b> <b>current</b> or lifetime <b>prevalence</b> <b>of</b> nine major mental disorders. Women with BED, compared with women with purging BN, were older, less likely to have a history of anorexia nervosa, and less likely to have been treated for an eating disorder. Obesity was more commonly associated with BED than with either subtype of BN. DISCUSSION: Our results lend some support to BED as an eating disorder distinct from purging BN. More research is needed to clarify the position of nonpurging BN relative to BED and purging BN...|$|R
40|$|The {{increasing}} <b>prevalence</b> <b>of</b> infections {{attributed to}} antibiotic-resistant bacteria has prompted {{renewed interest in}} exploiting the antibacterial properties of Ag+ to treat such infections. However, the antibacterial mode of action (MOA) and bactericidal activity of Ag+ are poorly understood, and there are concerns that the prolific and unrestricted use of Ag+ in consumer products will select bacterial Ag+ resistance, thus limiting the clinical utility of Ag+. Ag+ resistance already exists, although aspects of the molecular basis of Ag+ resistance, <b>and</b> the <b>current</b> <b>prevalence</b> <b>of</b> Ag+-resistant pathogens are unclear. This thesis sought to address these issues. Ag+ {{was found to be}} bacteriostatic in culture media and bactericidal in buffer, and was unable to eradicate Staphylococcus aureus biofilms in vitro. MOA studies indicated that the primary antibacterial target of Ag+ is the cell membrane. Evidence was obtained suggesting that Ag+ does not interfere with the phospholipid component of the membrane, but instead probably damages integral membrane proteins to produce an antibacterial effect. A survey of hospital staphylococcal isolates (n= 1006) found universal susceptibility to Ag+, and Ag+ resistance could not be selected in S. aureus and several other pathogens in vitro. However, in Escherichia coli, high-level Ag+ resistance arose rapidly and was not associated with a fitness cost likely to prevent its emergence in the clinical setting. Ag+-resistant strains contained mutations in genes regulating expression of an Ag+ efflux mechanism and outer membrane porins. A detailed characterisation of a known Ag+-resistance determinant (the sil operon), was also conducted to provide further insights into the mechanism of Ag+ resistance conferred by this determinant. Collectively, these studies provide further insights into the MOA of Ag+ and the mechanisms of Ag+ resistance, which could potentially be applied to optimising the future uses of Ag+ as an antibacterial agent...|$|R
