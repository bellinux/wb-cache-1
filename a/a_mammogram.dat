5|$|The decay {{products}} of 232Th include more dangerous radionuclides such as radium and radon. Although relatively little of those products is created {{as the result}} of the slow decay of thorium, a proper assessment of the radiological toxicity of 232Th must include the contribution of its daughters, some of which are dangerous gamma emitters, and which are built up quickly following the initial decay of 232Th due to the absence of long-lived nuclides along the decay chain. As the dangerous daughters of thorium have much lower melting points than thorium dioxide, they are volatilised every time the mantle is heated for use. In the first hour of use large fractions of the thorium daughters 224Ra, 228Ra, 212Pb, and 212Bi are released. Most of the radiation dose by a normal user arises from inhaling the radium, resulting in a radiation dose of up to 0.2millisieverts per use, about a third of the dose sustained during <b>a</b> <b>mammogram.</b>|$|E

25|$|Mammographic density {{refers to}} the {{relative}} proportions of radiodense area compared to the radiolucent area on <b>a</b> <b>mammogram,</b> which is basically an x-ray of the breast. The radiodense area on <b>a</b> <b>mammogram</b> is white and is associated with ductal and lobular epithelium, connective tissue and fluid in the breast.

25|$|About 1% of {{hospital}} admissions {{result in an}} adverse event due to negligence. However, mistakes are likely much more common, as these studies identify only mistakes that led to measurable adverse events occurring soon after the errors. Independent review of doctors' treatment plans suggests that decision-making could be improved in 14% of admissions; many of the benefits would have delayed manifestations. Even this number may be an underestimate. One study suggests that adults in the United States receive only 55% of recommended care. At the same time, a second study found that 30% of care in the United States may be unnecessary. For example, if a doctor fails to order <b>a</b> <b>mammogram</b> that is past due, this mistake will not {{show up in the}} first type of study. In addition, because no adverse event occurred during the short follow-up of the study, the mistake also would not show up in the second type of study because only the principal treatment plans were critiqued. However, the mistake would be recorded in the third type of study. If a doctor recommends an unnecessary treatment or test, it may not show in any of these types of studies.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{identify}} factors as-sociated with diagnostic follow-up after <b>an</b> abnormal <b>mammogram</b> in <b>a</b> national sample of women in the U. S. The sample was selected from the year 2000 National Health Interview Survey and included 1901 women aged 30 and above who reported ever having <b>an</b> abnormal <b>mammogram.</b> The outcome measure was receipt of at least some diagnostic follow-up after <b>an</b> abnormal <b>mammogram.</b> Bivariate and multivariate lo-gistic regression analyses were used to explore the associations between sociodemographic characteristics, general health and health behaviors, cancer risk and risk perceptions, and health care utilization character-istics and follow-up. Approximately 9 % of women who reported ever having abnormal mammograms reported not completing any additional diagnostic follow-up. Controlling for all other factors, women with less than a high school education were less likely to report follow-up after <b>an</b> abnormal <b>mammogram</b> than were women who had at least completed college (odds ratio = 0. 56; 95 % confidence interval: 0. 32, 0. 98). Younger women and women in poorer health were also less likely to report follow-up. Women who perceived a high versus low level of cancer in their family were more likely to report follow-up (odds ratio = 1. 65; 95 % confidence interval: 1. 04, 2. 62), controlling for all other factors. In a national sample of women with abnormal <b>mammograms,</b> <b>a</b> substantial number did not complete any diagnostic follow-up, potentially reducing the effectiveness of mammography screening programs in the U.

2500|$|Breasts {{are made}} up of breast tissue, {{connective}} tissue, and adipose (fat) tissue. [...] The amount of each of the three types of tissue varies from woman to woman. [...] Breast density is a measurement of relative amounts of these three tissues in a woman's breasts, as determined by their appearance on an X-ray image. [...] Breast and connective tissues are radiographically denser (they produce a brighter white on an X-ray) than adipose tissue on <b>a</b> <b>mammogram,</b> so a woman with more breast tissue and/or more connective tissue is said to have greater breast density. Breast density is assessed by mammography and expressed {{as a percentage of the}} mammogram occupied by radiologically dense tissue (percent mammographic density or PMD). About half of middle-aged women have dense breasts, and breasts generally become less dense as they age. On the one hand, higher breast density is associated with higher breast cancer risk in both premenopausal and postmenopausal women. On the other hand, women with extremely low densities have been recently shown to hold a significantly worse prognosis irrespective of patients' age, BMI and menopausal status.|$|E
