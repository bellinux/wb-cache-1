With a total of 64 temples, over forty reading rooms across the world and thousands of members, it remains the only religion established in Belgium whose notoriety and success has reached outside the country. Mainly active in France, the religious movement {{is characterized by a}} decentralized structure, simple rites, discretion and tolerance towards other faiths.|$|E

5|$|The four {{churches of}} the IRSSA– the United, Roman Catholic, Anglican and Presbyterian churches– agreed to {{participate}} in the reconciliation process between Indigenous and settler Canadians. They have been involved in funding various projects and services that assist former residential school students and their families in healing from the trauma caused by the schools. The Anglican Church of Canada set up the Anglican Healing Fund in the 1990s to respond to the ongoing need for healing related to residential schools. In the 2000s the United Church established the Justice and Reconciliation Fund to support healing initiatives and the Presbyterian Church has established <b>a</b> <b>Healing</b> & Reconciliation Program.|$|E
5|$|In 1845, James Howlett, a boy {{living in}} Canada, {{witnesses}} his father {{being killed by}} groundskeeper Thomas Logan. The anxiety activates the boy's mutation: bone claws protrude from his knuckles, and he impales Thomas, who reveals that he is James's birth father before dying. James flees along with Thomas's other son Victor Creed, who is thus James's half-brother and has <b>a</b> <b>healing</b> factor mutation like James. They spend the next century as soldiers, fighting in the American Civil War, both World Wars, and the Vietnam War. In Vietnam, the increasingly violent Victor attempts to rape a Vietnamese woman, and kills a senior officer who tries to stop him. James happens upon the fight and defends Victor, resulting in the pair being sentenced to execution by firing squad, which they survive due to their mutant healing abilities. Major William Stryker approaches them in military custody and offers them membership in Team X, a group of mutants including Agent Zero, Wade Wilson, John Wraith, Fred Dukes, and Chris Bradley. They join the team for a few years, with James now using the alias Logan, but Victor and the group's lack of empathy for human life causes Logan to leave.|$|E
5|$|Scully {{contacts}} Mulder, {{who is now}} resting at home. He {{believes that}} the artifact proves that humanity was created by aliens. Diana Fowley, who is with Mulder, contacts the Cigarette Smoking Man. <b>A</b> <b>healing</b> ceremony is held for Albert, but Scully is forced to leave when Skinner contacts her, telling her Mulder is in the hospital. Mulder {{is being held in}} a padded cell and is displaying abnormal brain activity. Scully, after learning that Skinner knows about their earlier conversation with Burks, calls him and Fowley liars and leaves. Scully is about to find a surveillance camera in the X-Files office when she is called by Sandoz telling her that the artifact contains information on human genetics. Sandoz is killed by Krycek shortly afterwards. Scully then heads to the West African Coast where she discovers that the artifact is part of a large spacecraft partially buried in the beach.|$|E

5|$|Kadaj confronts Rufus Shinra, who reveals he {{possesses}} the box containing Jenova's remains. He attempts to destroy it, but Kadaj manages {{to save it}} and flees the city with his companions. Yazoo and Loz are apparently destroyed along the way by an explosive planted by Shinra's agents. Cloud chases Kadaj down and engages him in battle, ultimately subduing him. Outmatched, Kadaj opens Jenova's box and fuses with its contents, transforming into Sephiroth. He then tells Cloud {{that he will be}} able to use the life essences of Geostigma sufferers to achieve complete domination over the planet. He and Cloud then fight, and throughout the whole encounter, Sephiroth appears to have the upper hand, flinging Cloud repeatedly into walls and finally impaling him through the shoulder. He asks Cloud to tell him what he most cherishes so that he can have the pleasure of taking it away. To this, Cloud replies that he cherishes everything, then pulls out Sephiroth's sword and deals him a hail of devastating blows. Sephiroth's spirit departs, leaving behind the mortally wounded Kadaj. As he lies dying in Cloud's arms, <b>a</b> <b>healing</b> rain starts falling across the land, curing the people of their Geostigma. Yazoo and Loz appear and confront Cloud; he charges at them, and they set off a massive explosion engulfing the three.|$|E
5|$|There {{are small}} {{enclosed}} chambers {{to either side}} of the centre chapel. The chapel of St Padarn is on the left, with an imitation pointed vault and slate slab floor. In the entrance to the chapel there is a window on the left side depicting scenes from the manuscript Life of Padarn. The single-light window with various figures, scenes and motifs is by Elizabeth Edmundson, and dates from 1988. It includes Teilo, Padarn and Dewi (David) at the top, <b>a</b> <b>healing</b> by St Samson, Maelgwn, Arthur and Caradog, two kings of Ireland on horseback and a figure with the Virgin and Child. The figures are mostly modelled on figures from the Book of St Chad. In the chapel itself, which has a low slate altar stone and seat, is a porcelain relief sculpture by Gillian Still showing a story from the Life, the ordeal by boiling water. The chapel is lit only by two small windows (one with red glass, the other green) into the central chapel. Neither the altar stone in the larger room nor that in the chapel of St Padarn have been consecrated so neither are strictly speaking altars, and neither can be used for a Eucharistic service.|$|E

40|$|AbstractMode of death, {{frequency}} of <b>a</b> <b>healed</b> or <b>an</b> acute myocardial infarct, or both, {{number of major}} epicardial coronary arteries severely narrowed by atherosclerotic plaque, and heart weight were studied at necropsy in 889 patients 30 {{years of age or}} older with fatal atherosclerotic coronary artery disease. No patient had had a coronary bypass operation or coronary angioplasty. The 889 patients were classified into four major groups and each major group was classified into two subgroups: 1) acute myocardial infarct without (306 patients) or with (119 patients) <b>a</b> <b>healed</b> myocardial infarct; 2) sudden out of hospital death without (121 patients) or with (118 patients) <b>a</b> <b>healed</b> myocardial infarct; 3) chronic congestive heart failure with <b>a</b> <b>healed</b> myocardial infarct without (137 patients) or with (33 patients) a left ventricular aneurysm; and 4) sudden inhospital death without (20 patients) or with (35 patients) unstable angina pectoris. The mean age of the 687 men (77 %) was 60 ± 11 years, and of the 202 women (23 %), 68 ± 13 years (p = 0. 0001). Although men included 77 % of all patients, they made up approximately 90 % of the out of hospital (nonangina) sudden death group. The {{frequency of}} systemic hypertension and angina pectoris was similar {{in each of the four}} major groups. The frequency of diabetes mellitus was least in the sudden out of hospital death group and similar in the other three major groups. The mean heart weight and the percent of ptients with a heart of increased weight were highest in the chronic congestive heart failure group; values were lower and similar in the other three major groups. All patients in the chronic congestive heart failure group (by definition) had <b>a</b> <b>healed</b> left ventricular infant, which was similar in frequency in the other three major groups. The percent of patients in whom three or four of the four major coronary arteries were severely narrowed (> 75 % in cross-sectional area) by atherosclerotic plaque was highest in the unstable angina subgroup and similar in all other major groups...|$|R
