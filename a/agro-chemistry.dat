40|$|The {{provision}} of pure enantiomers is of increasing importance {{not only for}} the pharmaceutical industry but also for <b>agro-chemistry</b> and biotechnology. In drug discovery and development, the enantiomers of a chiral drug depict unique chemical and pharmacological behaviors in a chiral environment, such as the human body, in which the stereochemistry of the chiral drugs determines their pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic and toxicological properties. We present a number of challenging case studies of up-to-kilogram separations of racemic or enriched isomer mixtures using preparative liquid chromatography and super critical fluid chromatography to generate individual enantiomers that have enabled the development of new candidate drugs within AstraZeneca. The combination of chromatography and racemization as well as strategies on when to apply preparative chiral chromatography of enantiomers in a multi-step synthesis of a drug compound can further facilitate accelerated drug discovery and the early clinical evaluation of the drug candidates...|$|E
40|$|Biocompatible {{microencapsulation}} is {{of widespread}} {{interest for the}} targeted delivery of active species in fields such as pharmaceuticals, cosmetics and <b>agro-chemistry.</b> Capsules obtained by the self-assembly of polymers at interfaces enable the combination of responsiveness to stimuli, biocompatibility and scaled up production. Here, we present a one-step method to produce in situ membranes at oil-water interfaces, based on the hydrogen bond complexation of polymers between H-bond acceptor and donor in the oil and aqueous phases, respectively. This robust process is realized through different methods, to obtain capsules of various sizes, from the micrometer scale using microfluidics or rotor-stator emulsification up to the centimeter scale using drop dripping. The polymer layer exhibits unique self-healing and pH-responsive properties. The membrane is viscoelastic at pH = 3, softens as pH is progressively raised, and eventually dissolves above pH = 6 to release the oil phase. This one-step method of preparation paves {{the way to the}} production of large quantities of functional capsules...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{attachment}} of perfluoroalkyl groups onto {{organic compounds}} {{has been a}} major synthetic goal over the past several decades. Previously, our group reported phenanthroline-ligated perfluoroalkyl copper reagents, (phen) CuRF, which react with aryl iodides and aryl boronates to form the corresponding benzo-trifluorides. Herein the perfluoroalkylation of a series of heteroaryl bromides with (phen) CuCF 3 and (phen) CuCF 2 CF 3 is reported. The mild reaction conditions allow the process to tolerate many common functional groups. Perfluoroethylation with (phen) CuCF 2 CF 3 occurs in somewhat higher yields than trifluoromethylation with (phen) CuCF 3, creating a method to generate fluoroalkyl heteroarenes that are less accessible from trifluoroacetic acid derivatives. The trifluoromethyl group is present in numerouspharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and materials. As a result, there has been considerable interest in developing practical reactions to incorporate perfluoroalkyl groups into organic compounds under mild conditions. In medicinal and <b>agro-chemistry,</b> the introduction of a trifluoromethyl group can lea...|$|E
40|$|Development of {{information}} and computer technologies induces changes into research concept, leading {{to the development of}} many in silico analytical and experimental methods [1, 2] used in determination and prediction of drug metabolism [3]. These methods have some advantages, from which the most important are: allows determination of metabolic profile in early stages of drug design; experiments are done into a shorter time and with fewer expenses [2]. Mathematical approach on structure-activity relationship (SAR) for biological active compounds (begun in nineteen century) lead to the concept of quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR, a mathematical approach that allows the identification of the quantitative link between structure and biologic activity of investigated compounds – [4]). SAR studies have been published since 1868, when Crum-Brown & Fraser stipulated the idea that the compounds activity is o function of structure and chemical composition [5]. This paradigm found its usefulness in <b>agro-chemistry,</b> pharmaceutical chemistry, toxicology and other chemistry related domains ten years later after the introduction of the QSAR concept [6]. A mathematical approach developed starting with the information obtained from the 2 D and 3...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of the research {{is to find out}} the influence of manure and inorganic fertilizer on the efficiency of N uptake and the yield of rice plant (Oryza sativa L.). Using inorganic fertilizer continuously can deacrease of rice production which resulted by saturated <b>agro-chemistry</b> material and the lower efficiency of N uptake by plant. To overcome to the problem, it is necessary to fertilize equally, both manure and inorganic fertilizer. The research is conducted at rice field Palur Sukoharjo and Soil Chemistry and Fertility Laboratory of Agruculture Faculty, Sebelas Maret University, Surakarta. This research represents experimental research by using randomized completely block design (RAKL) factorial with two factors. There are three factors manure i. e. O 1 (non manure), O 2 (manure 3 ton/ha.), O 3 (manure 6 ton/ha.) and three factors inorganic fertilization i. e. A 1 (non inorganic fertilizer), A 2 (Urea 15 - kg/ha. + ZA 50 kg/ha. + SP- 36 75 kg/ha. + KCl 50 kg/ha.), A 3 (Urea 300 kg/ha. + ZA 100 kg/ha. + SP- 36 150 kg/ha. + KCl 100 kg/ha.). The statistic analysis of the research uses F test, Kurscal-Wallis Test, and DMR test 5...|$|E
40|$|A plant growing under field {{conditions}} {{is not a simple}} individual; it is a community. We now {{know that there is a}} community of microbes associated with all parts of the plant, and that the root associated community is particularly large. This microbial community, the phytomicrobiome, is complex, regulated and the result of almost half a billion years of evolution. Circumstances that benefit the plant generally benefit the phytomicrobiome, and vice versa. Members of the holobiont modulate each other's activities, in part, through molecular signals, acting as the hormones of the holobiont. The plant plus the phytomicrobiome constitute the holobiont, the resulting entity that is that community. The phytomicrobiome is complex, well developed and well-orchestrated, and there is considerable potential in managing this system. The use of “biologicals” will develop during the 21 st century and play as large a role as <b>agro-chemistry</b> did in the 20 th century. Biologicals can be deployed to enhance plant pathogen resistance, improve plant access to nutrients and improve stress tolerance. They can be used to enhance crop productivity, to meet the expanding demands for plant material as food, fibre and fuel. They can assist crop plants in dealing with the more frequent and more extreme episodes of stress that will occur as climate change conditions continue to develop. The path is clear and we have started down it; there is a considerable distance remaining...|$|E
40|$|The present {{investigation}} aims at identifying {{the needs of}} the Argentinean agro-business sector for climate research and information. Our approach is focused on any type of climate information from past observations to seasonal prediction and climate change projections. We tried, in particular, to evaluate the possible existence of specific research themes that would be of major interest for these agriculture end-users. We interviewed representatives of seventeen companies from three major agrobusiness sectors: (1) regional/national entities such as agricultural associations, cooperatives and commercial trade boards; (2) insurance companies in the Argentinean agro-insurance market; and (3) large national and international companies representing cereal producers, <b>agro-chemistry</b> and agro-seeds. While all the interviewees recognized the strong influence of climate on their activities, they all pointed out that, at the time of making decision, they considered the political and economic risks rather than the climate one. In many aspects, climate is often considered as a fatality against which it is difficult to be protected. An interesting result is the confidence of the private sectors in the climate information provided by public sources (INTA, SMN, Universities) although they contract private consultants for frequent reports and tendencies. Finally, we explain how such sectors could make a better use of climate information (seasonal prediction, climate change scenarios) that could be integrated in their business projections. In particular, the development of new financial contracts (climate derivatives) open in countries with a relatively poor insurance history new ways to protect the different agricultural sectors, from the producer to large companies...|$|E
