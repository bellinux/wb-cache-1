40|$|A new {{paradigm}} for investigating whether a cognitive process {{is independent of}} perception was recently suggested. In the paradigm, primes are shown at an intermediate signal strength that leads to trial-to-trial and inter-individual variability in prime perception. Here, I used this paradigm and an objective measure of perception to assess the influence of prime <b>identification</b> <b>responses</b> on Stroop priming. I found that sensory states producing correct and incorrect prime <b>identification</b> <b>responses</b> were also associated with qualitatively different priming effects. Incorrect prime <b>identification</b> <b>responses</b> were associated with reversed priming effects but in contrast to previous studies, I interpret this to result from the (mis-) perception of primes rather than from a subliminal process. Furthermore, the intermediate signal strength also produced inter-individual variability in prime perception that strongly influenced priming effects: only participants who on average perceived the primes were Stroop primed. I discuss how this {{new paradigm}}, {{with a wide range}} of d' values, is more appropriate when regression analysis on inter-individual identification performance is used to investigate perception-dependent processing. The results of this study, in line with previous results, suggest that drawing conclusions about subliminal processes based on data averaged over individuals may be unwarranted...|$|R

Four experiments were conducted in which the degree of discrepancy between the expected identity of a flavor (derived from the color of a drink) and the actual identity of the flavor (derived from orthonasal olfactory cues) was examined. Using a novel experimental approach that controlled for individual differences in color-flavor associations, we first measured the flavor expectations held by each individual and only then examined whether the same individual's <b>identification</b> <b>responses</b> were influenced by his or her own expectations. Under conditions of low discrepancy, the perceived disparity between the expected and the actual flavor identities was small. When a particular color [...] identified by participants as one that generated a strong flavor expectation [...] was added to these drinks (as compared with when no such color was added), a significantly greater proportion of <b>identification</b> <b>responses</b> were consistent with this expectation. This held true even when participants were explicitly told that color would be an uninformative cue and were given as much time as desired to complete the task. By contrast, under conditions of high discrepancy, adding the same colors to the drinks no longer had the same effect on participants' <b>identification</b> <b>responses.</b> Critically, {{there was a significant difference}} in the proportion of responses that were consistent with participants' color-based expectations in conditions of low as compared with high discrepancy, indicating that the degree of discrepancy between an individual's actual and expected experience can significantly affect the extent to which color influences judgments of flavor identity...|$|R

The {{purpose of this paper is}} to survey the existing hardware implementations of a face recognition system, particularly those who used for developing an embedded door access control system. This includes a brief discussion about face recognition algorithms and the hardware platforms outlining the importance of using a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) device, which can be used to design an embedded door access control system. It is found that the success of any door access control system depends on the type of face recognition algorithm in the feature extraction phase of the face recognition system and the selected hardware device. Based on a comparison between different feature extraction algorithms, the use of a hybrid feature extraction technique can improve the accuracy of face recognition system. An efficient door access control system can be obtained using a FPGA device, which is preferable because of its technical characteristics of parallelism, re-programmability and very high speed, in the {{implementation of}} a face recognition system...|$|R

For paragraph readability and letter <b>identification,</b> <b>responses</b> to light text were slower and less accurate {{for a given}} contrast. Was this polarity effect (1) an artifact of our apparatus, (2) a physiological difference in the separate pathways for positive and negative contrast or (3) the result of increased experience with dark text on light backgrounds? To rule out the apparatus-artifact hypothesis, all data were collected on one monitor. Its luminance was measured at all levels used, and the spatial effects of the monitor were reduced by pixel doubling and quadrupling (increasing the viewing distance to maintain constant angular size). Luminances of vertical and horizontal square-wave gratings were compared to assess display speed effects. They existed, even for 4 -pixel-wide bars. Tests for polarity asymmetries in display speed were negative. Increased experience might develop full letter templates for dark text, while recognition of light letters is based on component features. Earlier, an observer ran all conditions at one polarity and then switched. If dark and light letters were intermixed, the observer might use component features on all trials and do worse on the dark letters, reducing the polarity effect. We varied polarity blocking (completely blocked, alternating smaller blocks, and intermixed blocks). Letter <b>identification</b> <b>responses</b> times showed polarity effects at all contrasts and display resolution levels. Observers were also more accurate with higher contrasts and more pixels per degree. Intermixed blocks increased the polarity effect by reducing performance on the light letters, {{but only if the}} randomized block occurred prior to the nonrandomized block. Perhaps observers tried to use poorly developed templates, or they did not work as hard on the more difficult items.
