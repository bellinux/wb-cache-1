5|$|Carey is a {{supporter}} of libraries, crediting them for beginning his successful comedy career. On May 2, 2000, in a celebrity edition of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire, he selected the Ohio Library Foundation to receive his $500,000 winnings. He later {{went on to win}} an additional $32,000 on the second celebrity Millionaire, making him one of the biggest winning contestants on Millionaire who did not win the top prize. Carey also has played on the World Poker Tour in the Hollywood Home games for the Cleveland Public Library charity. In June 2007, Carey offered to donate up to $100,000 (in $10,000 increments) to the Mooch Myernick Memorial Fund if <b>anybody</b> <b>could</b> beat him at the video game FIFA Soccer 07 for the Xbox 360. He dared five players from both the U.S. Men's and Women's National Teams to compete against him. Carey ended up donating $100,000, plus $60,000 for losing two games out of the six games he played.|$|E

This meant that <b>anybody</b> <b>could</b> find any small fault in the {{execution}} of developmental programs under the trust and the blame would fall on him. Swamiji came clean in all these court cases. The fact that a guru of a community had to go through trial in court cases, resulted in a character assassination of sorts.|$|E

25|$|The American Dream is {{the belief}} that through hard work and determination, any United States {{immigrant}} can achieve a better life, usually in terms of financial prosperity and enhanced personal freedom of choice. According to historians, the rapid economic and industrial expansion of the U.S. is not simply a function of being a resource rich, hard working, and inventive country, but the belief that <b>anybody</b> <b>could</b> get a share of the country's wealth if he or she was willing to work hard. This dream has been a major factor in attracting immigrants to the United States.|$|E
25|$|In 1813, the {{constitution}} eradicated the potter's guild and revoked the ordinances established in 1653 to standardize production. Now <b>anybody</b> <b>could</b> use this ceramic method in any style they wanted, {{and the lack}} of regulations led to a decline in technique and artistic quality. The Talavera market crashed. Out of the 46 workshops in production since the 18th century, only seven remained. When Enrique Luis Ventosa, a 29-year-old Catalan, arrived in Puebla in 1897, there were just six workshops left. Ventosa was fascinated by the history and fine craft work that had distinguished Puebla from the rest of Mexico. He became the leading force behind a renaissance in Talavera ware.|$|E
25|$|In March, {{others were}} accused of witchcraft: Martha Corey, child Dorothy Good, and Rebecca Nurse in Salem Village, and Rachel Clinton in nearby Ipswich. Martha Corey had {{expressed}} skepticism about {{the credibility of the}} girls' accusations and thus drawn attention. The charges against her and Rebecca Nurse deeply troubled the community because Martha Corey was a full covenanted member of the Church in Salem Village, as was Rebecca Nurse in the Church in Salem Town. If such upstanding people could be witches, the townspeople thought, then <b>anybody</b> <b>could</b> be a witch, and church membership was no protection from accusation. Dorothy Good, the daughter of Sarah Good, was only four years old, but not exempted from questioning by the magistrates; her answers were construed as a confession that implicated her mother. In Ipswich, Rachel Clinton was arrested for witchcraft at the end of March on independent charges unrelated to the afflictions of the girls in Salem Village.|$|E

He settled in the Latin Quarter in an {{apartment}} that overlooked the Sorbonne, where he enrolled in 32 different classes.

Until Berg finished reading a paper, he considered it [...] "alive" [...] and refused to let anyone else touch it.

In January 1924, instead of heading back to New York and getting himself into shape for the upcoming baseball season, Berg toured Italy and Switzerland.|$|E
500|$|The song, if not {{the title}} alone, {{was a source of}} {{irritation}} for those critics who deemed Living in the Material World overly preachy and didactic. In a full-page album review in Melody Maker, Michael Watts summarised his impression of Harrison's spiritual message: [...] "One gets this feeling of George, somewhat remote and rarefied, indicting the world for being what it is, although if <b>anybody</b> <b>could</b> change the world it would be an old Beatle." [...] While noting the song as an autobiographical statement on the singer's [...] "struggle to retain personal dignity and peace of mind", Watts wrote: [...] "He's dealing in lofty sentiments and abstractions; not everyone will want to drink of the cup." ...|$|E

500|$|When Wilson was 12 years old, {{his father}} was {{diagnosed}} with cancer. His father fought the disease for five years before dying while Wilson was attending Londonderry High School; Wilson today says he had to become a man when {{his father was}} diagnosed. In a 2011 story, ESPN.com writer Elizabeth Merrill said about Wilson's high school years, [...] "He was an honor roll student at Londonderry, but clashed with various authority figures who didn't appreciate his occasional lack of a filter." [...] In the same story, a number of Londonderry faculty speculated that some teachers didn't understand Wilson's life situation at the time. Art Psaledas, an assistant principal at the school, added, [...] "It happened at probably the worst time <b>anybody</b> <b>could</b> lose your dad.

[...] "I was calling for things only a {{beginner}} would have been ignorant enough to think <b>anybody</b> <b>could</b> ever do, and there he was, doing them." [...] Toland later explained that he wanted to work with Welles because he anticipated the first time director's inexperience and reputation for audacious experimentation in the theater would allow the cinematographer to try new and innovative camera techniques that typical Hollywood films would never have allowed him to do. Unaware of filmmaking protocol, Welles adjusted the lights on set as he was accustomed to doing in the theater; Toland quietly re-balanced them, and was angry when one of the crew informed Welles that he was infringing on Toland's responsibilities. During the first few weeks of June, Welles had lengthy discussions about the film with Toland and art director Perry Ferguson in the morning, and in the afternoon and evening he worked with actors and revised the script.|$|E

500|$|Appel {{wrote of}} Stengel, [...] "He {{was not a}} man for all seasons; he was a man for {{baseball}} seasons." [...] Stengel remains the only manager to lead his club to victory in five consecutive World Series. How much credit he is due for that accomplishment is controversial, due to the talent on the Yankee teams he managed—Total Baseball deemed that the Yankees won only six games more than expected during the Stengel years, given the number of runs scored and allowed. According to Bak, [...] "the argument—even among some Yankees—was that the team was so good <b>anybody</b> <b>could</b> manage it to a title". Rizzuto stated, [...] "You or I could have managed and gone away for the summer and still won those pennants." [...] Appel noted, [...] "There was no doubt, by taking on the Mets job, he hurt his reputation as a manager. Once again, it was clear that with good players he was a good manager, and with bad players, not. Still, his Yankee years had put him so {{high on the list of}} games won, championships won, etc., that he will always be included in conversations about the greatest managers." ...|$|E
500|$|While {{serving as}} museum chair, Marcus was once called upon by Fred Florence, then {{chairman}} of a major local bank and a fellow Temple Emanu-El leader, to explain his inclusion of [...] "a lot of Communist art" [...] he'd been told would be included in an upcoming DMFA [...] "Sports in Art" [...] exhibit, co-sponsored by Sports Illustrated and United States Information Agency as a fund-raiser for the 1956 Olympic team. Artists represented in the show included four supposed Communist supporters, Leon Kroll, Yasuo Kuniyoshi, Ben Shahn, and William Zorach. Asking Florence to indicate which pieces were being questioned, Marcus dismissed each claim one by one: [...] "I don't know how <b>anybody</b> <b>could</b> think hitting a baseball was communist," [...] Marcus said when shown Shahn's [...] "The National Pastime." [...] His response to Zorach's [...] "Fisherman" [...] was similar, as {{he shook his head}} and remarked, [...] "I don't think too many people think fishing is communist either." [...] Marcus followed up by going to local newspapers The Dallas Morning News and the Dallas Times-Herald and getting the publishers of both to agree that they would not stand for censorship in the arts.|$|E
500|$|Astronomer Michael R. Molnar {{argues that}} the [...] "star in the east" [...] refers to an astronomical event with astrological {{significance}} {{in the context of}} ancient Greek astrology. He suggests a link between the Star of Bethlehem and a double occultation of Jupiter by the moon on March 20 and April 17 of 6 BC in Aries, particularly the second occultation on April 17. Occultations of planets by the moon are quite common, but Firmicus Maternus, an astrologer to Roman Emperor Constantine, wrote that an occultation of Jupiter in Aries was a sign of the birth of a divine king. He argues that Aries rather than Pisces was the zodiac symbol for Judea, a fact that would affect previous interpretations of astrological material. Molnar’s theory was debated by scientists, theologians, and historians during a colloquium on the Star of Bethlehem at the Netherlands’ University of Groningen in October 2014. Harvard astronomer Owen Gingerich supports Molnar’s explanation but noted technical questions. [...] "The gospel story is one in which King Herod was taken by surprise," [...] said Gingerich. [...] "So it wasn’t that there was suddenly a brilliant new star sitting there that <b>anybody</b> <b>could</b> have seen [...] something more subtle." [...] Astronomer David A. Weintraub says, [...] "If Matthew’s wise men actually undertook a journey to search for a newborn king, the bright star didn’t guide them; it only told them when to set out." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1990, Psychiatric Bulletin of the Royal College of Psychiatrists {{published}} the article [...] "Compulsion in psychiatry: blessing or curse?" [...] by Russian psychiatrist Anatoly Koryagin. It contains {{analysis of the}} abuse of psychiatry and eight arguments by which {{the existence of a}} system of political abuse of psychiatry in the USSR cаn easily be demonstrated. As Koryagin wrote, in a dictatorial State with a totalitarian regime, such as the USSR, the laws have at all times served not the purpose of self-regulation of the life of society but {{have been one of the}} major levers by which to manipulate the behavior of subjects. Every Soviet citizen has constantly been straight considered state property and been regarded not as the aim, but as a means to achieve the rulers' objectives. From the perspective of state pragmatism, a mentally sick person was regarded as a burden to society, using up the state's material means without recompense and not producing anything, and even potentially capable of inflicting harm. Therefore, the Soviet State never considered it reasonable to pass special legislative acts protecting the material and legal part of the patients' life. It was only instructions of the legal and medical departments that stipulated certain rules of handling the mentally sick and imposing different sanctions on them. A person with a mental disorder was automatically divested of all rights and depended entirely on the psychiatrists' will. Practically <b>anybody</b> <b>could</b> undergo psychiatric examination on the most senseless grounds and the issued diagnosis turned him into a person without rights. It was this lack of legal rights and guarantees that advantaged a system of repressive psychiatry in the country.|$|E
500|$|In {{the winter}} of 1902–03, Bosanquet took part in another tour, this time with Lord Hawke's team which played matches in New Zealand and Australia and was captained by Warner. In New Zealand, he played two matches against a New Zealand {{representative}} side, and in all matches scored 148 runs {{at an average of}} 18.50 with one fifty, an innings of 82 against South Island. Bosanquet also took 18 wickets at an average of 22.61; his style of bowling attracted a great deal of attention. [...] In one game, Charles Bannerman, who played in Australia's first Test match in 1877, was umpire. He told Warner: [...] "When the next team goes to Australia, be sure that Mr Bosanquet is in it. He bowls a lot of bad 'uns; but that ball of his that breaks the wrong way will be very useful on the hard Australian wickets." [...] However, the tour was more notable for an incident in the match against Canterbury. Bosanquet had taken an early wicket in the first innings, but bowled poorly afterwards. He was the fourth bowler used in the second innings and with his third ball, it {{looked as if he had}} bowled Walter Pearce behind his legs as he attempted a big hit. However, both umpires were unsighted and the non-striker Arthur Sims, who also had his view obscured, urged Pearce not to leave the middle. The tourists' wicket-keeper, Arthur Whatman, Bosanquet and other English players surrounded the umpire, who decided Pearce was not out. Bosanquet then turned to Sims and said: [...] "You're a nice cheat. I bowled him round his legs. <b>Anybody</b> <b>could</b> see that." [...] Sims responded that there was reasonable doubt, but Whatman began to swear and call him a cheat. Bosanquet later bowled Sims and Canterbury were easily defeated. However, the incident continued to attract attention. The English team were severely criticised in the press and Sims' employers refused to release him for any further matches unless Bosanquet apologised. Bosanquet wrote letters of apology to Sims and to the Canterbury Cricket Association, and Sims later told him to forget about it, but Sims' employers would not let him take part in the remaining games.|$|E

[...] The next day, Trump formally joined the Reform Party, changing his voter registration from Republican to Independence Party, the New York affiliate of the Reform Party. [...] On the same day, Buchanan announced that he too would leave the Republican Party to join with the Reform Party and attempt to obtain its presidential nomination. Buchanan said he refused to engage in a [...] "name-calling" [...] contest with Trump but made a thinly veiled attack against Trump's wealth, arguing, [...] "I don't believe the Reform Party nomination can be bought, and I don't believe the Presidency can be bought." [...] On Face the Nation, Pat Choate, the Reform Party's 1996 vice presidential nominee, said Trump would [...] "make a good candidate," [...] but argued that Buchanan could challenge Trump [...] "on the merits" [...] and that Trump and the media were misrepresenting Buchanan's views through [...] "hate politics."
