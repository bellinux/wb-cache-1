We define the <b>articulated</b> motion space as {{the space in}} which the motions of the limbs of a body belong. We show that around the origin, the <b>articulated</b> motion space can be approximated by a linear space estimated directly from the previous body pose. <b>Articulated</b> constraints are enforced by projecting unconstrained motions onto the linearized <b>articulated</b> motion space in an optimal way...|$|R

5|$|Hamlet's soliloquies {{have also}} {{captured}} the attention of scholars. Hamlet interrupts himself, vocalising either disgust or agreement with himself, and embellishing his own words. He has difficulty expressing himself directly and instead blunts the thrust of his thought with wordplay. It is not until late in the play, after his experience with the pirates, that Hamlet is able to <b>articulate</b> his feelings freely.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the traditional classification of brachiopods into inarticulate and <b>articulate,</b> two approaches appeared in the 1990s: one approach groups the inarticulate Craniida with <b>articulate</b> brachiopods, since both use the same material in the mineral layers of their shell; the other approach makes the Craniida a third group, as their outer organic layer {{is different from that}} in either of the other two. However, some taxonomists believe it is premature to suggest higher levels of classification such as order and recommend a bottom-up approach that identifies genera and then groups these into intermediate groups. Traditionally, brachiopods have been regarded as members of, or as a sister group to, the deuterostomes, a superphylum that includes chordates and echinoderms. One type of analysis of the evolutionary relationships of brachiopods has always placed brachiopods as protostomes while another type has split between placing brachiopods among the protostomes or the deuterostomes.|$|E

5|$|Scottish nineteenth-century Reformed theologian William Cunningham {{also sought}} to <b>articulate</b> a distinctively Reformed {{theology}} of baptism in the modern world.

He argued that the efficacy of baptism only applies to adults expressing faith in the act of baptism.|$|E
5|$|An <b>articulate</b> {{expression}} of Greek republicanism {{can be found}} in the works of the revolutionary author Rigas Feraios. Feraios' execution in 1798 at the hands of the Ottomans gave an aura of heroism to these political ideas, which also visualized the liberation of Greece in the context of political reforms. In addition to Feraios' writings, other works in the same polemical style took on a sharper revolutionary character, as social contradictions in the Ottoman Empire grew.|$|E
5|$|Ann Eliza Bleecker's {{pastoral}} poems exemplified a {{new style}} of American poetry, and, due to her experience of the American Revolutionary tumult, {{a new sense of}} national identity. These poems, written in the pastoral tradition, conveyed both the beauty of the colonial New York countryside and the horrific impact of war, suffering, death, and destruction. Because Bleecker was writing from the interesting perspective of a terrified young mother, her <b>articulate</b> depictions of the Revolutionary War are still read by historians today.|$|E

Here, {{on the outer}} walls, the sculptures are not overdone, yet they are <b>articulate</b> and discreetly aesthetic. The Hoysala builders used soapstone almost universally as building material, a trend that started {{in the middle of}} the 11th century with Chalukyan temples. Other common artistic features between the two Kanarese dynasties are the ornate Salabhanjika (pillar bracket figures), the lathe-turned pillars and the makara torana (lintel with mythical beastly figure). The tower over the shrine in a Hoysala temple is a closely moulded form of the Chalukya style tower.|$|E
5|$|Bo's {{stint as}} Minister of Commerce {{significantly}} raised his international profile and generated media attention both in China and abroad. Described as good-looking, <b>articulate</b> and open-minded in {{his approach to}} problems, Bo's rise from a municipal official to the central government generated great media fanfare and elevated his status to something of a 'political star.' Bo's political persona was considered {{a departure from the}} generally serious and conservative leadership in Beijing. With his youthful vigour, populism, and purported popularity with female reporters, Bo's political rise had been compared to that of John F. Kennedy.|$|E

5|$|Lifespans {{range from}} three to over thirty years. Ripe gametes (ova or sperm) float from the gonads into the main coelom and then exit into the mantle cavity. The larvae of inarticulate brachiopods are {{miniature}} adults, with lophophores that enable the larvae to feed and swim for months until the animals become heavy enough to settle to the seabed. The planktonic larvae of <b>articulate</b> species do not resemble the adults, but rather look like blobs with yolk sacs, and remain among the plankton {{for only a few}} days before leaving the water column upon metamorphosing.|$|E
5|$|Osteochondrosis, or {{surficial}} pits in bone {{at places}} where bones <b>articulate,</b> {{is also known}} in Edmontosaurus.

The underlying cause of the condition is unknown. Genetic predisposition, trauma, feeding intensity, alterations in blood supply, excess thyroid hormones, and deficiencies in various growth factors have been suggested. Among dinosaurs, osteochondrosis (like tumors) is most commonly found in hadrosaurids.|$|E

They are immature because they're in a children's environment all the time. They have a strange perspective; because they spend all day with kids, they are more aware of kids' culture than adults'. When they read about a former pupil who has become head of ICI, they always say, 'But that boy's an idiot. He's crap at geography.' The boy is condemned forever because in the 1960s he didn't know all the capitals of the Third World.|$|E
5|$|The {{cognitive}} ability {{of children with}} AS often allows them to <b>articulate</b> social norms in a laboratory context, where {{they may be able}} to show a theoretical understanding of other people's emotions; however, they typically have difficulty acting on this knowledge in fluid, real-life situations. People with AS may analyze and distill their observations of social interaction into rigid behavioral guidelines, and apply these rules in awkward ways, such as forced eye contact, resulting in a demeanor that appears rigid or socially naive. Childhood desire for companionship can become numbed through a history of failed social encounters.|$|E
