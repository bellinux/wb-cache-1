40|$|Mestrado Vinifera EuroMaster - Instituto Superior de AgronomiaThe {{sensitivity}} <b>of</b> <b>metatartaric</b> <b>acid</b> (MA) to {{high temperatures}} {{is the main}} limit for its actual use in enology. For this reason MA is generally used only for ready-to-drink wines that are stored for few months in bottle. The objective of this work was to obtain {{more information about the}} use of MA in order to prevent tartaric salts precipitation in wine by monitoring its effectiveness along the time. Tartaric stability was followed in a white wine during a ten-week experiment. 10 g/Hl of MA was added to wines with different five pH values, namely 3. 0, 3. 2, 3. 5, 3. 7 and 3. 9 at room temperature (20 °C), and to wines at original pH of 3. 2 under three different temperatures commonly found in real storage conditions, precisely 12 °C, 20 °C and 35 °C. To monitor tartaric stability we used a test based on the electrical conductivity developed by Boulton (1983). At the end of the experiment we found both a pH and a temperature effect. It was found a polynomial relation (R 2 = 0, 85) between tartaric stability and pH. The highest the pH, the highest the instability and the shortest the protection against tartrates precipitation. Furthermore, over 20 °C we observed a rapid general decrease of MA effectiveness and that there was a linear relation (R 2 = 0, 99) between temperature and tartaric stability, so that we can affirm that the highest the temperature, the higher the wine instability; this is probably due to a faster MA hydrolysis. <b>Metatartaric</b> <b>acid</b> is surely able to prevent tartrates precipitation, but since in our experimental conditions it could not protect the wine for longer than one month, we would suggest extreme prudence about its use especially during long storage period...|$|R

25|$|Another {{solution}} is to introduce <b>Metatartaric</b> <b>acid,</b> a tartaric acid polymer, into the wine. Its mode of action is still unknown but it prevents microscopic crystals from growing. However, the effect is not sustainable {{in the long term}} (between 6 and 18 months) because it hydrolyzes when warm.|$|R
40|$|Aims : Inhibition of {{potassium}} hydrogen tartrate (KHT) crystallization by carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) is {{tested in a}} model solution and in wines. Tartaric acid salt crystallization risk is assessed by computing the supersaturation, saturation temperature and excess KHT {{with respect to the}} saturation equilibrium using MEXTAR® (Mesure de l’EXces de TARtre) software. Materials and results : Firstly, the time for crystals to appear was recorded by monitoring the conductivity in a model solution and in a wine, and the inhibition ratio was computed. At 11, 5 °C, 0, 5 mg. L- 1 CMC inhibited KHT crystallization. The inhibitory effect increased exponentially with increasing CMC concentration and was several times greater than that of polysaccharides and polyphenols, the protective colloids in wine (Gerbaud et al., 1997). At 2 °C, 30 mg. L- 1 CMC had the same inhibitory effect than 10 mg. L- 1 at 11. 5 °C. Secondly, 20 red and white wines were refrigerated for 3 weeks at - 4 °C with CMC or <b>metatartaric</b> <b>acid.</b> Results show that the <b>addition</b> <b>of</b> 20 mg. L- 1 CMC has an inhibitory effect at least equivalent to 100 mg. L- 1 <b>metatartaric</b> <b>acid.</b> Furthermore, for 10 wines preheated for 8 days at 30 °C and then refrigerated for 2 months at 0 °C, 5 and 20 mg. L- 1 CMC maintains its inhibitory efficiency, unlike <b>metatartaric</b> <b>acid</b> which is hydrolysed Significance and impact of the study : The OIV-OENO 366 - 2009 and OIV-OENO 02 / 2008 resolutions recently authorized the use of CMC to prevent tartaric acid salt precipitation. With no impact on health, and stable under heating and in acid solution, CMC is an efficient candidate for tartaric stabilization. The optimal concentration of 20 mg. L- 1 (2 g. hL- 1) should however be adapted to local wine storage conditions and KHT crystallization risk...|$|R
2500|$|The {{presence}} of unstable proteins that {{can create a}} visual problem (protein breakdown) in the wine also requires stabilization. Treatment with bentonite allows the precipitation of unstable proteins which can then be removed by filtration and extraction. The proteins can also react with <b>Metatartaric</b> <b>acid</b> added to wine to prevent tartaric precipitation: the wine then loses its shine and becomes opalescent like whey. Some varieties are naturally high in protein (muscat[...].) but levels also {{vary depending on the}} vintage and maturity levels.|$|R
50|$|CMC is used {{to achieve}} {{tartrate}} or cold stability in wine. This innovation may save megawatts of electricity used to chill wine in warm climates. It is more stable than <b>metatartaric</b> <b>acid</b> and is very effective in inhibiting tartrate precipitation. It is reported that KHT crystals, in presence of CMC, grow slower and change their morphology. Their shape becomes flatter because they lose 2 of the 7 faces, changing their dimensions. CMC molecules, negatively charged at wine pH, interact with the electropositive surface of the crystals, where potassium ions are accumulated. The slower growth of the crystals and the modification of their shape are caused by the competition between CMC molecules and bitartrate ions for binding to the KHT crystals (Cracherau et al. 2001).|$|R
40|$|Tartrate {{precipitation}} {{is still}} a relevant subject in Enology, {{being one of the}} most common problems of wine physical-chemical instability. Potassium bitartrate and calcium tartrate precipitations are undesirable phenomena which can occur in bottled wines, especially when these are stored at low temperatures. The occurrence of tartrate salt crystals (potassium hydrogen tartrate – KHT and calcium tartrate – CaT) in bottles has severe consequences in the final aspect of the wine and therefore on the consumer’s acceptance, making tartrate wine stabilization virtually mandatory before bottling. Currently, several solutions to prevent this haze are available: subtractive methods including the conventional cold treatments that promote the cristalization of KHT, removal of potassium and calcium ions either by electrodialysis or ion exchange resins; and additive methods such as the <b>addition</b> <b>of</b> carboxymethylcellulose, mannoproteins or <b>metatartaric</b> <b>acid.</b> For monitoring the KHT stability, several analytical methods have been developed based on conductivity evaluation, namely the mini-contact test and the saturation temperature measurements (TS). These methods will also be revisited, aiming to raise awareness of their utility as tools in quality control of wines. This review addresses tartrate precipitation subject and the most recent preventive solutions available, pointing out the advantages and drawbacks of each one, and its impact on the final characteristics of the wine...|$|R

Further described is the main cataracts occurring in wines and methods to prevent them, focusing on {{the practice of the}} most commonly used products: <b>Metatartaric</b> <b>acid,</b> gum arabic and carboxymethylcellulose (CMC). In the practical part of these products in different variations, combinations and concentrations added to white wine, which was a non-stabilized against the tartar and proteins. This wine was in the wake of bottling and variants of the same stored for one year in two different storage temperatures. In the course of storage was observed formation of cataracts in individual bottles. After a year all variants were opened and evaluated was total sensory analysis with qualification and quantification of turbidity, sediment filtration and weighing, measuring conductivity and pH. The results were statistically processed and evaluated with recommendations for practice...|$|R

By using technology, we can try to have a better wine quality and take advantage of the grapes we get into the winery. The use of Pasteurization as a method to control microbiological problems is very old, being now widely used in winemaking, mainly in table wines. However it can have some disadvantages when it is not well used. We may want to study its influence in wine, getting to know the best way to use it and how it can influence the quality of the most charismatic beverage, the wine. Then, a trial has been made, using pasteurization as an alternative method for wine stabilization, concerning microbiological stability. The study about the influence of this thermal treatment in the Physical, Chemical and Sensory analysis of a red wine in Douro Valley, Portugal was done. With this knowledge we could see the differences between a pasteurized wine and not. Comparing the results obtained in the trial, we can conclude there is no influence in the major analysis made, having however a very little decrease in the amount of the colour compounds in the pasteurized wine, having no such result in the sensory analysis. Also the <b>metatartaric</b> <b>acid</b> which was used to prevent the tartaric precipitation was influenced by the heat, making the pasteurized wine instable. In the sensory analysis, we can see there is some improvement in the pasteurized wine, while the non pasteurized one stays the same, having however {{no significant differences between the}} two wines compared. One, the most important thing to retain is the knowledge we need to have for using any kind of wine treatment. We shall try to know how it works and so, try to have the best treatment having the less wine modifications as possible. By using it, we can have an alternative to the use of chemical compounds and having more safety and quality in the final product, so the consumer has the best to buy...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigated}} whether technological procedures {{could be used}} to avoid allergic residues remaining in wine, after the use of fining agents containing milk or egg protein. Fining materials used during the wine making process when derived from milk or egg may present the possibility to trigger an allergic reaction. Therefore these substances should be declared on the wine label if present in the final product, depending on the legislation of each country. Label information enables allergic consumers to avoid food and beverages that may trigger allergic symptoms. As there is no standard for the sequence of winemaking practices a fining trial was conducted to study the influence of various filtration and further methods normally used in the wine industry and its efficiency on reducing this possible allergens, even in a worst case scenario. More than nine different German wines, red and whites from different years were used on this study. The methods used to detect the residues were different ELISA assays and in vivo tests were evaluated with allergic patients, prick skin test and Double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenge (DBPCFC) with fined wines, where none of the patients tested reacted allergically. Casein is removed from both red and white wines to not detectable levels by all methods of filtration used in this work. Centrifugation alone might let some residues behind as well as flash-pasteurisation. Nevertheless an additional sterile filtration after flash-pasteurisation or centrifugation decreases casein proteins to no longer being detectable. For whey protein only a bentonite treatment with successive sterile filtration was found to be competent to reliably reduce the amount of detectable protein below the detection limit of the assay at both concentration levels in both red and white wine used in this study. Albumin residues are present when wine is fined but not filtered, especially white wines, most filtration methods used in this work are capable to bring the residues to no longer being detectable when a normal dosage of fining agent is applied. Flash-Pasteurisation is not advised for wines that have been previously fined with egg white, since there is an increase on the residues after heating practice, when ELISA assay is applied as detection method. Lysozymes stay present in the wine in most cases of this study, in reds and in whites. If a bentonite treatment takes place after the fining, in the legal limits of up to 500 ppm, followed by sterile filtration with 0. 45 µm pad filter, no residues are detected. Lysozyme reacts with <b>metatartaric</b> <b>acid</b> and with carboxymethyl-cellulose and precipitates, but not completely. Reaction with red wine phenols lead to precipitation, the higher the total phenol content the greater was the enzyme precipitation, here again the precipitation itself was not enough to diminish the lysozyme amount under 0. 25 ppm. In conclusion, if wines are fined with low amount of fining agents and properly filtered, they are likely to have no detectable residues. However if a wine is not filtered and casein, whey protein and egg albumin or lysozyme has been applied it should be declared on the label...|$|R
