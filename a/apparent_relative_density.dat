5000|$|As the {{principal}} use of relative density measurements in industry is {{determination of the}} concentrations of substances in aqueous solutions and these are found in tables of RD vs concentration it is extremely important that the analyst enter {{the table with the}} correct form of relative density. For example, in the brewing industry, the Plato table, which lists sucrose concentration by mass against true RD, were originally (20 °C/4 °C) that is based on measurements of the density of sucrose solutions made at laboratory temperature (20 °C) but referenced to the density of water at 4 °C which is very close to the temperature at which water has its maximum density of ρ (...) equal to 0.999972 g/cm3 (or 62.43 lb·ft−3). The ASBC table in use today in North America, while it is derived from the original Plato table is for <b>apparent</b> <b>relative</b> <b>density</b> measurements at (20 °C/20 °C) on the IPTS-68 scale where the density of water is 0.9982071 g/cm3. In the sugar, soft drink, honey, fruit juice and related industries sucrose concentration by mass is taken from this work which uses SG (17.5 °C/17.5 °C). As a final example, the British RD units are based on reference and sample temperatures of 60 °F and are thus (15.56 °C/15.56 °C).|$|E
50|$|The {{density of}} {{substances}} varies with temperature and pressure {{so that it}} is necessary to specify the temperatures and pressures at which the densities or masses were determined. It is nearly always the case that measurements are made at nominally 1 atmosphere (101.325 kPa the variations caused by changing weather patterns) but as relative density usually refers to highly incompressible aqueous solutions or other incompressible substances (such as petroleum products) variations in density caused by pressure are usually neglected at least where <b>apparent</b> <b>relative</b> <b>density</b> is being measured. For true (in vacuo) relative density calculations air pressure must be considered (see below). Temperatures are specified by the notation Ts/Tr) with Ts representing the temperature at which the sample's density was determined and Tr the temperature at which the reference (water) density is specified. For example, SG (20 °C/4 °C) would be understood to mean that the density of the sample was determined at 20 °C and of the water at 4 °C. Taking into account different sample and reference temperatures we note that while SGH2O = 1.000000 (20 °C/20 °C) it is also the case that RDH2O = 0.998203/0.998840 = 0.998363 (20 °C/4 °C). Here temperature is being specified using the current ITS-90 scale and the densities used here and in the rest of this article are based on that scale. On the previous IPTS-68 scale the densities at 20 °C and 4 °C are, respectively, 0.9982071 and 0.9999720 resulting in an RD (20 °C/4 °C) value for water of 0.9982343.|$|E
50|$|Since {{the density}} of dry air at 101.325 kPa at 20 °C is 0.001205 g/cm3 and that of water is 0.998203 g/cm3 {{we see that the}} {{difference}} between true and <b>apparent</b> <b>relative</b> <b>densities</b> for a substance with <b>relative</b> <b>density</b> (20 °C/20 °C) of about 1.100 would be 0.000120. Where the <b>relative</b> <b>density</b> of the sample is close to that of water (for example dilute ethanol solutions) the correction is even smaller.|$|R
50|$|Further {{manipulation}} and finally substitution of RDV, the true <b>relative</b> <b>density</b> (the subscript V is used {{because this is}} often referred to as the <b>relative</b> <b>density</b> in vacuo), for ρs/ρw gives the relationship between <b>apparent</b> and true <b>relative</b> <b>density.</b>|$|R

40|$|The main aim of {{this project}} {{was to examine the}} effects of {{introducing}} hierarchy into honeycombs and determining the variables that preside over the global response of the structure. Specifically to understand how the in and out-of-plane elastic and non-linear plastic properties of honeycombs were affected by hierarchy. Analytical analysis of hierarchical honeycombs has been used to explain and predict the response of finite element simulations validated by experimental investigations. The early stage of the investigation focused on finding if the elastic modulus could be maintained or improved on an equal density basis due to the introduction of hierarchy. It is clear that honeycombs are sensitive to hierarchical sub-structures, particularly the fraction of mass shared between the super-and sub-structures. Introduction of an additional level of hierarchy without reducing performance is difficult, but was possible by functional grading. Another original result was that it was determined when the sub-structure could be assumed to be a continuum of the super-structure. Meaning the material properties from a single unit sub-cell could be used as the constituent material properties of the super-structure, as in previous work by (Lakes 1993) and (Carpinteri et al 2009) for example. Work investigating the in-plane, non-linear plastic response of hierarchical honeycombs showed that the introduction of hierarchy into honeycombs can have the effect of delaying the onset of elastic buckling, which is a common failure mechanism for low <b>relative</b> <b>density</b> structures. As such it was possible to achieve a marked increase in the recoverable energy absorbed by hierarchical honeycombs prior to elastic buckling or plastic yield. The potential benefits are less <b>apparent</b> in higher <b>relative</b> <b>density</b> structures due to the onset of plasticity becoming the first mode of failure. The out-of-plane properties also investigated showed no increase in the elastic properties due to the introduction of hierarchy, but showed a marked increase in the out-of-plane elastic buckling stress of 60 % when compared to a conventional hexagonal honeycomb of the same <b>relative</b> <b>density.</b> EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceRolls-Royce : GWRGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

There was significant difference, at 5 % significance, between treatments for elemental composition, levels of extractives, lignin total and holocellulose and the wood syringyl/guaiacyl, as well as for gravimetric yields in charcoal, condensable gases and non-condensable gases, levels of fixed carbon and volatiles, and for the higher calorific value of charcoal. For the ash content and <b>relative</b> <b>apparent</b> <b>density</b> of charcoal were not observed significant differences at the same level of significance. Concluded that there is variability in the wood quality of four evaluated genetic materials, having the same, distinct correlations, thus the yield and the quality of charcoal. All genetic material presented satisfactorily gravimetric yield in charcoal and quality. The woods of clones with low syringyl/guaiacyl ratio showed an increase in yield in charcoal. The chemical composition of woods from the four clones, in general, showed no significant correlations, the 5 % significance level, at the yield and quality of charcoal...|$|R
40|$|The present {{work was}} {{developed}} in order to study the relation among the diameter and the basal area, the competition zones, the <b>relative</b> <b>density,</b> and the self-tinning in Eucalyptus saligna Smith monoclonal stand, with 238 pair's data basis of permanent sampling by full density stand distribution, observed from 3 to 18 years old. The results obtained allowed to conclude that Tang's density model was very precise and efficient. The self-thinning begins when the population reaches an average diameter of 8 cm. The <b>relative</b> <b>density</b> was equal 34. 46 %, with line gradient of 1. 5818 (b). The maximum current annual increment in diameter and between the <b>relative</b> <b>densities</b> was observed {{between the ages of}} 14 and 15 years when the <b>relative</b> <b>densities</b> were 12. 5 % and 25 %, characterizing a free growth competition zone among the individuals of the population. The zone of increasing competition between the <b>relative</b> <b>densities</b> of 25 and 50 % and the imminent mortality zone occurred between the <b>relative</b> <b>densities</b> of 50 and 100 %. The density model allowed detecting five competition zones, {{in the development of the}} stands, defined by zones of: excessive space, free growth, increase of competition, complete stock and imminent mortality, in relation to the <b>relative</b> <b>density</b> of the population...|$|R

The degree of inherent anisotropy {{was found to be}} independent of the mean effective stress but dependent on the initial <b>relative</b> <b>density</b> of the test-specimen. In the vertical-to horizontal directions, the degree of inherent anisotropy decreases with increasing <b>relative</b> <b>density.</b> A wet-pluviation, sample preparation technique produces cross-anisotropic test-specimens, with the degree of cross anisotropy independent of the initial <b>relative</b> <b>density.</b> The effects of membrane penetration (expressed in terms of the normalized unit membrane penetration) are found to be independent of the initial <b>relative</b> <b>density</b> and the mean effective stress...|$|R
40|$|Many years ago, a {{new concept}} called <b>relative</b> <b>density</b> was {{developed}} {{with the intention of}} appropriately defining the looseness and denseness of sand or sand–gravel soils in a meaningful way. Soon after, <b>relative</b> <b>density</b> found its way into ground improvement as an acceptance criterion by engineers who were more familiar with the construction of engineered backfilling rather than thick mass treatment. There are considerable amounts of research and publications that are able to well demonstrate the unreliability of <b>relative</b> <b>density</b> as an acceptance criterion. <b>Relative</b> <b>density</b> has no real influence on the soil's performance, its range of application does not span across all soil types, and it is subject to large inherent errors that make its use a technical risk. Here, the reasons why the concept of <b>relative</b> <b>density</b> is unreliable and should not be used for a ground improvement acceptance criterion are presented and discusse...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Cubic {{structures}} having spherical pores ranged as BCC and FCC lattices {{are constructed}} {{to simulate the}} microstructures of cellular polymers with various <b>relative</b> <b>densities.</b> The Mooney-Rivlin strain energy potential model is adopted to characterize the hyperelasticity of the constituent solid from which the foams are made. Finite element analysis on the influences of the polymer hyperelasticity upon the macroscopic mechanical properties of the foams is carried out. Numerical results {{show that there is}} no obvious buckling plateau segment in the uniaxial compressive stress-strain curves of the regular spherical cell models as most low density foams have. Moreover, it is found that the initial tangent modulus is a power function of the foam’s <b>relative</b> <b>density,</b> and the index is smaller than 2 for lower <b>relative</b> <b>density</b> models, bigger than 2 for moderate <b>relative</b> <b>density</b> models, and closed to 2 for higher <b>relative</b> <b>density</b> models...|$|R

The increase in the volume and rheological behavior of slurry, TGA and DSC of the green bodies are investigated. The influence of solid content on the <b>relative</b> <b>density,</b> the cell size distribution and the compressive strenghth is studied. The experimental results show that in the measurable shear rate range the rheology of slurry exhibt a shear thinning behavior, the <b>relative</b> <b>density</b> increase with the solid content, with the decrease of the <b>relative</b> <b>densities</b> the cell size increase.

40|$|A {{detailed}} quantitative microstructural {{analyses of}} primarily open cell FeCrAlY and 314 stainless steel metal foams with different <b>relative</b> <b>densities</b> and pores per inch (p. p. i.) were {{undertaken in the}} present investigation {{to determine the effect}} of microstructural parameters on the <b>relative</b> <b>densities</b> of metal foams. Several elements of the microstructure, such as longitudinal and transverse cell sizes, cell areas and perimeters, ligament dimensions, cell shapes and volume fractions of closed and open cells, were measured. The cross-sections of the foam ligaments showed a large number of shrinkage cavities, and their circularity factors and average sizes were determined. The volume fractions of closed cells increased linearly with increasing <b>relative</b> <b>density.</b> In contrast, the volume fractions of the open cells and ligaments decreased with increasing <b>relative</b> <b>density.</b> The <b>relative</b> <b>densities</b> and p. p. i. were not significantly dependent on cell size, cell perimeter and ligament dimensions within the limits of experimental scatter.
