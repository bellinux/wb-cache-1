The status of the business is reviewed regularly and re-forecast and, if necessary, budget changes are made. If the business performance is significantly off plan, executives may need to re-evaluate the strategy as some of the original assumptions may have changed.

40|$|Budgeting accomplishes many {{goals in}} an {{organization}} and evaluating {{the potential impact of}} a change is difficult. I investigate the organization-wide effects of three distinct budgeting alternatives (rolling budgets, <b>activity-based</b> <b>budgeting</b> and beyond budgeting) using a model that incorporates three important budgeting functions: forecasting, operational planning and performance evaluation. From the perspective of the whole organization, each budgeting alternative improves profits. I then examine the department preferences for each alternative when each function is under the control of a different department and each department has its own, department-specific performance metric. Forecasting is judged on the variance of the base demand forecast, operational planning on the expected unit capacity costs and performance evaluation on the salesperson's expected action. In my model all departments always favor rolling forecasts, while only one department always favors beyond budgeting (or <b>activity-based</b> <b>budgeting).</b> For beyond budgeting and <b>activity-based</b> <b>budgeting,</b> the preferences of the two other departments vary depending upon the model parameters. ...|$|E

40|$|An {{examination}} {{of the history of}} budget reform in the United States indicates a perpetual tug of war between the executive and legislative branches of government for power. But surprisingly, in spite of this highly charged political process, there exists a consistent and common thread of concern for improving government performance and a desire to inject more “rationality” (measurement and evaluation) into budgeting decisions. In the past century, U. S. federal budget reforms have been centralizing (the Budget Act of 1921), <b>activity-based</b> (performance <b>budgeting</b> of the 1950 s), focused on program evaluation (PPBS in the 1960 s), management-oriented (MBO in the early 1970 s), bottom-up (ZBB in the mid- 1970 s), draconian (Gramm-Rudman-Hollings of the 1980 s), and concerned with results (GPRA in the 1990 s). Unfortunately, establishing a direct link between and among performance measurement, program evaluation and final appropriations remains elusive. In the U. S. today, the stakes have become too significant and entrenched. The sheer size of the U. S. federal budget as well as the dramatic change in the nature of federal expenditures (from predominantly supporting government administration to funding transfer payments to individuals) ups the ante of the politics of the public budgeting process. Perhaps more importantly, the overwhelming U. S. federal deficit and debt simply overshadow consideration of performance as the President and Congress mull over literally billions of dollars in cuts to the current and next fiscal year budgets. ...|$|R
40|$|<b>Activity-based</b> costing and <b>budget</b> {{analysis}} of vedolizumab versus conventional treatments in ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s diseaseObjectiveTo assess the organizational {{impact of the}} introduction of vedolizumab compared to the biotechnological anti-TNF alternatives to date available in Italy {{for the management of}} Ulcerative Colitis (UC) and Crohn’s Disease (CD). MethodsA questionnaire aimed at acquiring data about the Italian real practice concerning the management of patients affected by UC and CD was administered to a panel of expert clinicians from three Italian centers of excellence. The determination {{of the cost of the}} therapies was realized through an Activity-Based Costing (ABC) analysis which identified the differential between the use of vedolizumab and the alternatives. ResultsThe reduced time of infusion of vedolizumab allows a total cost/infusion of € 97. 89, with savings vs. infliximab of € 39. 60 (UC and CD). Vedolizumab implies an expenditure of € 17, 229. 84 (UC) and € 17, 459. 63 (CD) in the first year which allows, compared to Infliximab originator (€ 17, 739. 60), a saving/patient of € 509. 76 and € 279. 97 for UC and CD respectively. In the following years, vedolizumab implies an expenditure of € 13, 870. 55 and € 14, 049. 95 for UC e CD, lower than infliximab (€ 14, 284. 73), with a differential of € 414. 18 for UC and € 234. 78 for CD. In the comparison with infliximab biosimilar, the results are the same with regard to the administration costs, but the combined cost administration + drug is lower than that of vedolizumab due to the lower expenditure for drugs. ConclusionsVedolizumab implies a reduction of the time spent by the professionals involved in the provision of the treatment, allowing a reallocation of the saved resources...|$|R

The present study aimed {{to assess the}} economic and organizational implications of a portable device for negative-pressure wound therapy (NPWT) implementation, compared with the administration of pharmacological therapies alone for preventing surgical complications in patients undergoing general, cardiac, obstetrical–gynecological, or orthopedic surgical procedures. Patients and methods: A total of 8, 566 hospital procedures, related to the year 2015 from one hospital, were evaluated considering infection risk index, occurrence rates of SSCs, drug therapies, and surgical, diagnostic, and specialist procedures and hematological exams. <b>Activity-based</b> costing and <b>budget</b> impact analyses were implemented for the economic assessment. Results: Patients developing an SSC absorbed i) 64. 27 % more economic resources considering the length of stay (€ 8, 269 ± 2, 096 versus € 5, 034 ± 2, 901, p< 0. 05) and ii) 42. 43 % more economic resources related to hematological and diagnostic procedures (€ 639 ± 117 versus €  449 ± 72, p< 0. 05). If the innovative device had been used over the 12 -month time period, it would have decreased {{the risk of developing}} SSCs; the hospital would have realized an average reduction in health care expenditure equal to − 0. 69 % (−€ 483, 787. 92) and an organizational saving in terms of length of stay equal to − 1. 10 % (− 898 days), thus allowing 95 additional procedures. Conclusion: The implementation of a portable device for NPWT would represent an effective and sustainable strategy for reducing the management costs of patients. Economic and organizational savings could be reinvested, thus i) treating a wider population and ii) reducing waiting lists, with a higher effectiveness in terms of a decrease in complications.

40|$|Over {{the past}} few years Activity-Based Costing has come {{to be one of the}} most popular {{approaches}} to management accounting in the United States, Great Britain and many other western countries. According to the ABC conception, indirect costs are allocated to products relative to activities and processes incurring these costs, instead of the classification by manufacturing sub-units, eg. departments, using different bases of costs repatriation, mostly not proportional to the production volume. I he area where the new idea of cost allocation was applied first was the calculation of product costs. I rom the time when the ABC conception was formulated till now it has evolved and developed to find various applications outside the product cost calculation. It is also employed in numerous applications in the widely understood service sector, involving diverse forms of activity, eg. airlines, telecommunications, computer services, power production, as well as in the health care and education for establishing relative ‘profitability’ in different educational areas. The ABC idea may be used, apart from the unit cost calculation, measuring the profit margin on sales of products or services by distribution areas or customers, in <b>Activity-Based</b> <b>Budgeting</b> and Activity-Based Management.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Present {{trends in}} {{hospital}} management are facilitating {{the utilization of}} more accurate costing methods, which potentially results in superior cost-related information and improved managerial decision-making. However, the Activity-Based Costing method (ABC), which was designed for cost allocation purposes in the 1980 s, is not widely used by healthcare organizations. This study analyzes costs related to selected categories of patients, those suffering from psoriasis, varicose ulcers, eczema and other conditions, within a dermatology department at a Czech regional hospital. METHODS: The {{study was conducted in}} a hospital department where both inpatient and outpatient care are offered. Firstly, the diseases treated at the department were identified. Further costs were determined for each activity using ABC. The study utilized data from managerial and financial accounting, as well as data obtained through interviews with departmental staff. Using a defined cost-allocation procedure makes it possible to determine the cost of an individual patient with a given disease more accurately than via traditional costing procedures. RESULTS: The cost analysis focused on the differences between the costs related to individual patients within the selected diagnoses, variations between inpatient and outpatient treatments and the costs of activities performed by the dermatology department. Furthermore, comparing the costs identified through this approach and the revenue stemming from the health insurance system is an option. CONCLUSIONS: Activity-Based Costing is more accurate and relevant than the traditional costing method. The outputs of ABC provide an abundance of additional information for managers. The benefits of this research lie in its practically-tested outputs, resulting from calculating the costs of hospitalization, which could prove invaluable to persons involved in hospital management and decision-making. The study also defines the managerial implications of the performed cost analysis for the hospital management. Based on the analysis results, it is possible to standardize activities and performance appraisal (Benchmarking), and provide all necessary information for hospital budgeting practices, especially <b>Activity-Based</b> <b>Budgeting</b> (ABB) ...|$|E
40|$|Budgets are an {{important}} part of the business environment since 1920 and are considered to be the key drivers and evaluators of managerial performance; and the key elements for planning and control. Budgets are the most powerful tool for management control; they can play an essential role in the organization’s power politics because it can increase the power and authority of top management and limit the autonomy of lower-level managers. Besides its advantages traditional budgeting presents disadvantages also. In recent years criticism towards traditional budgeting has increased. The basis of this criticism is that traditional budgeting is a relic of the past; it prevents reactions to changes in the market, it cannot keep up with the changes and requirements of today’s business world and it isn’t useful for business management. In order to eliminate criticism researchers and practitioners have developed more systematic and alternative concepts of budgeting that suits better for the needs of the modern business environment. Beyond budgeting, better budgeting, rolling forecasts, <b>activity-based</b> <b>budgeting</b> are the main alternatives developed in the last years. From the mentioned alternatives this article examines only beyond budgeting. Our paper discusses how budgeting has evolved into its current state, before examining why this universal technique has come under such heavy criticism of late. The paper is a literature analysis, it contributes to the existing managerial accounting literature and it is structured as follows. In the first part the background and evolution of budgeting is presented, followed by the analysis of related theories in traditional budgeting, emphasizing both the advantages and disadvantages of traditional budgeting.

40|$|This {{research}} aims {{to extend}} the understanding of contingency theory and the factors influencing Activity-Based Costing (ABC) and <b>Activity-Based</b> <b>Budgeting</b> (ABB) system implementation in developing economies. Using qualitative case-based methods, the unique features of ABC/ABB implementation in three large Thai companies from telecommunications, banking and oil industries were investigated. Interviews were conducted with key personnel involved with the implementation process. The Telecommunications Company and Bank implemented ABC and the Oil Company implemented ABB. This research {{contributes to the literature}} in four areas. Firstly, the key literature investigating ABC implementation draws on contingency theory.  However, the empirical research is dominated by quantitative methods. This research contributes to contingency theory with in-depth case analysis. Secondly, this research contributes to the theory with a detailed investigation of six contingency factors: competition, government policy, technology, organizational strategy, structure and culture, throughout the process of implementation. It was found that competition in the market was {{the most important factor in}} adopting ABC/ABB systems. In Thailand recent changes in the economic, political, government policy and technology have caused changed in competition. This also linked to changes in organizational strategy. This research found that ABC was able to contribute to differentiation strategy, focused by Telecommunications Company and Bank. ABB was adopted to meet cost leadership strategy, found in the case of the Oil Company. Other factors, including organizational culture and structure were shown as important contributors to the design, implementation of ABC/ABB and the use of that information. In addition, this research enabled a more detailed exploration of the interrelationship between the contingency factors and how they played out through the varying stages of implementation. Thirdly, this research contributes to the contingency theory literature by providing in-depth study of ABC/ABC implementation success through the factors identified by Shields (1995). This research found that the ABC team which was responsible only for the ABC implementation and external consultants who helped to design and implement the ABC model will make the implementation effectively. Top management support is a crucial factor, as it drives other factors. Organisational culture of three cases, reflected in Thai culture, combined with an effective human resource development strategy enabled the companies to successfully implement ABC/ABB with minimal resistance. Fourthly, this research contributes to the management accounting literature by providing a detailed investigation of ABC adaptations to suit local needs. It was found that the design of ABC by the Bank was a hybrid combination of the ABC system and the TDABC concepts. The Telecommunications Company designed the ABC system by combining traditional cost system and ABC system. The ABB information flow of the Oil Company started with the setting up of expected profitability which was the last step of the traditional ABB information flow. This study provides empirical evidence that enables a better understanding of the influence of contingency factors on the implementation of ABC/ABB in a developing country setting. This study would be beneficial for other companies in developing economies to assist with successful ABC/ABB implementation in a shorter time period with fewer problems...|$|E
