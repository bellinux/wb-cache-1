5|$|Ale {{have several}} adversaries, {{including}} dragons, zmajeviti (dragon-like) men, eagles, St. Elijah, and St. Sava. The principal {{enemy of the}} ala is the dragon; {{he is able to}} defeat her and eliminate her harmful effects. Dragons are thus seen as guardians of the fields and harvest, and as protectors against bad weather. When an ala threatens by bringing hail clouds, <b>a</b> <b>dragon</b> comes out to fight with her and drive her away. His main weapon is lightning; thunder represents a fight between ale and dragons (during which ale hide in tall trees). An instance of a more abundant crop at a particular point is explained in the Pčinja region as a result of <b>a</b> <b>dragon</b> having struck an ala with lightning just over that place, making her drop the looted grains she had been carrying in her huge ears. If an ala finds <b>a</b> <b>dragon</b> in a hollow tree, however, she can destroy him by burning the tree.|$|E

5|$|Ale can be {{defeated}} by zmajeviti men, {{who have a}} human mother, but <b>a</b> <b>dragon</b> father. They look like ordinary people except for little wings beneath their armpits; such men are always born at night after a twelve-month term.
