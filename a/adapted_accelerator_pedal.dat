5000|$|With {{electronic}} <b>accelerator</b> <b>pedals,</b> {{there was}} little inherent friction because of {{the simplicity of the}} mechanical design. The tactile pedal response of only a spring force with no hysteresis can {{make it more difficult for}} a driver to maintain an <b>accelerator</b> <b>pedal</b> position. Manufacturers of electronic <b>accelerator</b> <b>pedals</b> designed their pedals with additional parts to recreate the tactile response of the older mechanical <b>accelerator</b> <b>pedals.</b> To quote from CTS Corporation's 2004 US patent application: ...|$|R

[...] Heel-and-toe bracket: Attaches to <b>accelerator</b> <b>pedal</b> {{for proper}} racing style shifts (hooks on <b>accelerator</b> <b>pedal</b> and allows driver {{to have his}} toes on brake pedal and his heel on the <b>accelerator</b> <b>pedal</b> to keep engine revs up while braking and down shifting).|$|R
5000|$|On many cars, the <b>accelerator</b> <b>pedal</b> {{motion is}} communicated via the {{throttle}} cable, {{to activate the}} throttle linkages, which move the throttle plate. In cars with electronic throttle control (also known as [...] "drive-by-wire"), an electric motor controls the throttle linkages and the <b>accelerator</b> <b>pedal</b> connects not to the throttle body, but to a sensor, which sends the pedal position to the Engine Control Unit (ECU). The ECU determines the throttle opening based on <b>accelerator</b> <b>pedal</b> position and inputs from other engine sensors.|$|R
40|$|The {{long-term}} effects of the active <b>accelerator</b> <b>pedal</b> were evaluated {{in the city of}} Lund in 2000 and 2001. The system, installed in 284 vehicles, produced a counterforce in the <b>accelerator</b> <b>pedal</b> at the speed limit. It could, however be overridden by pressing the <b>accelerator</b> <b>pedal</b> harder. The results showed that test drivers’ compliance with the speed limits improved considerably. Reduction in average speeds and less speed variation by the test vehicles indicate a great traffic-safety potential. Travel times were unaffected, while emission volumes decreased significantly...|$|R
50|$|This system helps {{accomplish}} vehicle propulsion {{by means}} of an electronic throttle without any cables from the <b>accelerator</b> <b>pedal</b> to the throttle valve of the engine. In electric vehicles, this system controls the electric motors by sensing the <b>accelerator</b> <b>pedal</b> input and sending commands to the power inverter modules.|$|R
25|$|In {{order to}} allow the {{powertrain}} computer to optimize performance under every driving condition, the Insight’s <b>accelerator</b> <b>pedal</b> is a “drive-by-wire” type that uses an electronic position sensor instead of the conventional metal cable that usually connects the pedal to the engine’s throttle body. In the drive-by-wire system, the engine’s throttle body {{is controlled by the}} powertrain computer in response to the <b>accelerator</b> <b>pedal</b> position—allowing the computer to determine the optimal throttle body, fuel, and CVT settings based on the <b>accelerator</b> <b>pedal</b> position and its rate of travel.|$|R

Heel-and-toe bracket: Attaches to <b>accelerator</b> <b>pedal</b> {{for proper}} racing style shifts (hooks on <b>accelerator</b> <b>pedal</b> and allows driver {{to have his}} toes on brake pedal and his heel on the <b>accelerator</b> <b>pedal</b> to keep engine revs up while braking and down shifting). Headlight high beam flasher switch: Mounts {{to the left of}} wheel below the instrument panel (silver rod with black tip).

5000|$|Related to the TPS are <b>accelerator</b> <b>pedal</b> sensors, {{which often}} include a wide open {{throttle}} (WOT) sensor. The <b>accelerator</b> <b>pedal</b> sensors are used in electronic throttle control (ETC) or [...] "drive by wire" [...] systems, and the most common use of a {{wide open throttle}} sensor is for the kick-down function on automatic transmissions.|$|R
5000|$|The Toyota {{electronic}} <b>accelerator</b> <b>pedals</b> {{contain a}} special friction device made of nylon 4/6 or polyphenylene sulfide within the pedal assembly {{to recreate the}} tactile response of older pedals.

5000|$|On August 28, 2009, a two-car {{collision}} {{killed four}} people {{riding in a}} Lexus dealer-provided loaner ES 350 in San Diego, California. The NHTSA released a safety investigation report on October 25, finding that the accident vehicle was wrongly fitted with all-weather rubber floor mats meant for the RX 400h SUV, and that these mats were not secured by {{either of the two}} retaining clips. The brake hardware also showed signs of heavy braking consistent with a stuck <b>accelerator</b> <b>pedal.</b> The report stated that the <b>accelerator</b> <b>pedal's</b> hinge did not allow relieving obstructions, and the dashboard lacked directions for the three-second emergency press of the push button keyless ignition. NHTSA investigators also recovered the accident vehicle's <b>accelerator</b> <b>pedal,</b> which was still [...] "bonded" [...] to the SUV floor mat.

40|$|Sensing the {{position}} and movement of the <b>accelerator</b> <b>pedal</b> in a vehicle is important for acceleration control and safety while driving. The <b>accelerator</b> <b>pedal</b> {{is controlled by the}} foot, but precise adjustment requires much training because the driver must rely on somatosensory cues, which provide limited feedback. In this study, we propose periodic tactile feedback for the <b>accelerator</b> <b>pedal</b> to provide an additional tactile cue. We conducted an experiment using a driving simulator to compare the lap time, the rate of off-track incidents and the subjective evaluation of controllability recorded in questionnaires. The experiment confirmed that the feedback makes the control of acceleration easier and facilitates safer driving...|$|R

40|$|In this work, Concurrent Engineering (CE) {{approach}} {{has been used to}} determine the most optimum decision on design concept and material of the composite <b>accelerator</b> <b>pedal</b> at conceptual design stage. Comprehensive studies are carried out to prepare the design specifications of composite <b>accelerator</b> <b>pedal.</b> Various design concepts are generated using the Morphological approach. In particular at design stage, CATIA is used to generate various design concepts followed by analysis on ANSYS. Simultaneously, material selection is done on the basis of past research &amp; specifications. Rating/weighting matrix evaluation method is used to select the best concept for the profile of pedal arm on the basis of mass, volume, stress and deformation results achieved on ANSYS. The composite <b>accelerator</b> <b>pedal</b> is optimized and analyzed for safety parameters and finally prototyped using Selective Laser Sintering. The results reveals the feasibility of composite <b>accelerator</b> <b>pedal</b> with glass filled polyamide providing substantial weight saving and better properties than existing metallic pedal...|$|R
5000|$|A related {{downshifting}} {{technique is}} called heel-and-toe, {{in which the}} brake and <b>accelerator</b> <b>pedals</b> are pressed simultaneously. Classically, the brake is pressed with the ball of the right foot and the <b>accelerator</b> <b>pedal</b> {{is controlled by the}} right heel, while the clutch pedal is pressed by the left foot. However, variants are possible, with the brake and accelerator pressed by sides of the right foot.|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the feasibility of}} classifying (inferring) the emergency braking situations in road vehicles from the motion pattern of the <b>accelerator</b> <b>pedal.</b> We trained and compared several classifiers and employed genetic algorithms to tune their associated hyperparameters. Using offline time series data {{of the dynamics of}} the <b>accelerator</b> <b>pedal</b> as the test set, the experimental results suggest that the evolved classifiers detect the emergency braking situation with at least 93 % accuracy. The best performing classifier could be integrated into the agent that perceives the dynamics of the <b>accelerator</b> <b>pedal</b> in real time and—if emergency braking is detected—acts by applying full brakes well before the driver {{would have been able to}} apply them...|$|R

50|$|Automobile <b>accelerator</b> <b>pedals</b> have {{historically}} been mechanical assemblies which link the pedal to the engine throttle by mechanical linkages or a Bowden cable. With the advent of electronic throttle control, <b>accelerator</b> <b>pedals</b> consist of a spring-loaded pedal arm connected to an electronic transducer. This transducer, typically a potentiometer orHall effect sensor, converts {{the position of the}} pedal arm to an electronic signal which is sent to an electronic control unit (ECU).|$|R
