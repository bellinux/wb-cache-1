"It is us, the {{professional}} artists of flamenco, {{who have to}} make cante flamenco, and nobody else, Flamenco, like any other art, is an art of professionals, {{although there are many}} people who peer at us, with a look as if to say: What interesting little creatures! or maybe: Oh!

[...] Copland later wrote that [...] "it was wonderful for me to find a teacher with such openness of mind, while at the same time she held firm ideas of right and wrong in musical matters.

[...] Though he planned on only one year abroad, he studied with her for three years, finding her eclectic approach inspired his own broad musical taste.|$|E

But, in the present instance, I am satisfied to tell you that my client did attend that meeting. But mind, that was no illegal meeting--it was not secret; the door was not locked, nor even closed; it was a party of men met at the wedding of one of their own station.
