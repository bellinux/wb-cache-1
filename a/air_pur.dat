After more than a year's delay, his next film was I Married a Witch (1942), followed by It Happened Tomorrow (1944), both of which did respectably well, and then And Then There Were None (1945), which turned out to be an exceptional commercial success despite being perhaps the least personal of his Hollywood ventures. Each of Clair's American films was made for a different studio.|$|E

40|$|We have {{initiated}} {{an investigation}} of the de novo purine nucleotide biosynthetic pathway in the plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Functional suppression of Escherichia coli auxotrophs allowed the direct isolation of expressed Arabidopsis leaf cDNAs. Using this approach we have successfully suppressed mutants in 4 of the 12 genes in this pathway. One of these cDNA clones, encoding 5 '-phosphoribosyl- 5 -aminoimidazole (<b>AIR)</b> synthetase (<b>PUR</b> 5) has been characterized in detail. Analysis of genomic DNA suggests that the Arabidopsis genome contains a single AIR synthetase gene. Analysis of the cDNA sequence and mRNA size suggests that this enzyme activity is encoded by a monofunctional polypeptide, similar to that of bacteria and unlike other eukaryotes. The Arabidopsis AIR synthetase contains a basic hydrophobic transit peptide consistent with transport into chloroplasts. Comparison of both the predicted amino acid and nucleotide sequence from Arabidopsis to those of eight other distant organisms suggests that the plant sequence is more similar to the bacterial sequences than to other eukaryotic sequences. This study provides the groundwork for future investigations into the regulation of de novo purine biosynthesis in plants. Additionally, we have demonstrated that functional suppression of bacterial mutants may provide a useful method for cloning a variety of plant genes...|$|R

40|$|Thermal {{conductivity}} {{of cellular}} rigid polyurethane foam (PUR) increases by time {{which leads to}} higher heat energy losses in district heating pipe networks. The main reason for increased thermal conductivity is diffusion of low conductive gases out of the PUR and diffusion of surrounding <b>air</b> into the <b>PUR.</b> However, oxidation of the PUR occurs during the service-life of the PUR and is accelerated by the higher temperatures close the fluid pipe. The effect that oxidation has on the thermal conductivity is not yet fully understood and existing models for prediction of long-term thermal performance of PUR insulation in district heating applications does not take oxidation processes into account. It {{is possible that the}} radiative heat transfer is affected by the oxidation and changes over the service-life of the PUR. In order to investigate the influence of oxidation on thermal conductivity, the extinction coefficient was therefore calculated for samples subjected to different levels of ageing. The input data for the calculations were measured by FTIR. The extinction coefficients were then used to calculate the overall thermal conductivity of the PUR with typical gas compositions. Results indicated that the extinction coefficient was 22 % higher in the samples exposed to lower temperatures. However, the effect on the overall thermal conductivity of the same samples was an increase of about 1. 8 %. Since the comparison was made between two samples subjected to different levels of ageing, the increase in total thermal conductivity should be interpreted as a minimum if considering the total service lifetime of the PUR insulation...|$|R
