40|$|An {{ultrasonic}} transducer technology to generate wideband impulses using a one-dimensional chain of spheres was previously presented. The Hertzian {{contact between the}} spheres causes the nonlinearity of the system to increase, which transforms high amplitude narrowband sinusoidal input into a train of wideband impulses. Generation of short duration ultrasonic pulses is desirable both in diagnostic and therapeutic ultrasound. Nevertheless, the biggest challenge in terms of adaptation to biomedical ultrasound is the coupling of the ultrasonic energy into biological tissue. An analytical model was created to address the coupling issue. Effect of the matching layer was modelled as a flexible thin plate clamped from the edges. Model was verified against hydrophone measurements. Different coupling materials, such as glass, aluminium, <b>acrylic,</b> silicon <b>rubber,</b> and vitreous carbon, was analysed with this model.

Since prices are also high, demand is not so high vis-à-vis the characteristics. On the other hand, the new type of <b>acrylic</b> <b>rubber</b> does not contain any chlorine despite its unclear chemical composition. Processability has been improved; most of the tackiness to rolls, as well as staining problems related to mold have been solved.|$|E
50|$|In the past, the {{greatest}} complaint with prosthetics is not having secure adherence. When prostheses are not adhered securely, satisfaction of prostheses is significantly decreased. In {{a survey conducted}} approximately two years after receiving the prostheses, only 67% of respondents “benefited” and only 39% still used them (Janes S 2005). Adhesion of prostheses depends greatly on the materials and fabrication techniques. Presently common are self-adhering prostheses (mass-produced) which adhere well initially, but the adhesion weakens over a few months. Another common method of adhesion is to apply an organic based pressure sensitive adhesive to the prosthesis for each use. However, removing the adhesive is difficult and can easily tear the thin edges of the prosthesis. Most promising though is a fabrication technique where the silicone prostheses are bonded to {{a thin layer of}} polyurethane. A water-based <b>acrylic</b> <b>rubber</b> adhesive is applied to the polyurethane, and the prostheses could be adhered to the skin for up to two weeks at a time. Removing the adhesive from the prostheses is fairly simple and is done with an alcohol swab. The edges of the prostheses remain thin and durable due to the polyurethane layer. Additionally, the water-based adhesive is gentle on the skin and is indicated for irradiated skin.|$|E

Besides, acrylonitrile is third of the 129 priority pollutants listed by EPA (Keith and Telliard 1979; Kumar et al. 2008). The global production of acrylonitrile exceeds 5 million tons, with a proportion of 28 % produced in China (Dong et al. 2017; Zheng et al. 2015). Thus, a large amount of acrylonitrile wastewater is generated during the production (Lai et al. 2012), which has inevitably caused serious impact on public and environmental health (Ramteke et al. 2013). Furthermore, these emerging pollution sources are highly toxic, carcinogenic (Ramakrishna et al. 1989; Thier et al. 2000; Quast 2002) and related toxicity investigation has been widely reported, e.g. acrylonitrile could leads to neurobehavioral disorder in rats and some human sicknesses (Caito et al. 2013; Khan et al. 2009; Tanii and Hashimoto 1984).

The influence of different content (1, 3, and 6 wt %) of nanoscale FVAR powder on the nonisothermal crystallization behavior of PBT was investigated by using differential scanning calo-rimeter. The nonisothermal crystallization data were ana-lyzed using Avrami, Ozawa, and Liu-Mo methods. The va-lidity of kinetic models on the nonisothermal crystallization process of PBT and PBT/FVAR blends was discussed.

The model depends on two equations: the Cross-Carreau equation to describe the equilibrium viscosity and a second order kinetic equation to express the time dependence of viscosity. Two characteristic thixotropic times are differentiated: one for the net structure breakdown, which is defined as a power law function of shear rate, and an other for the net structure buildup, which is not dependent on the shear rate.

40|$|This thesis evaluates some {{methods for}} the {{measurement}} of stiffness parameters of soils, {{with an emphasis on}} the use of bender element technology in obtaining the shear modulus. The experimental program consisted two primary stages. The beginning part of the experimentation was concerned with evaluating the behavior of bender elements, both free-standing and when applied to soil. For this case, experiments were performed on dry Ticino sand. It was concluded that the bender element tip geometry has a much greater impact than previously perceived, in particular with long, slender geometries sometimes creating directly-propagating compressional waves that interfere with the shear wave arrival detection. To reduce the uncertainty in signal interpretation, a specimen aspect ratio of 1 was adopted, with a minimum wavelength ratio of 2. The second part of the experimentation consisted of using bender elements on Boston Blue Clay, both intact samples as well as Resedimented Boston Blue Clay, created in the laboratory from processed powder. The results obtained from loading normally consolidated specimens were generally consistent and in good agreement with the literature. The unloading portion was observed to behaves differently as a function of maximum consolidation stress, with the shear modulus decreasing less during unloading as higher stress ranges are reached. In addition to the testing performed on soils, a parametric study was conducted on common materials including steel, aluminum, <b>acrylic,</b> and <b>rubber</b> in order to evaluate the results for stiffness parameters measured using extensometers, accelerometers, and ultrasonic P-wave transducers. With the conclusion of these experiments, the accelerometers were shown to have highly variable results, especially for shear wave velocity, while the other methods yielded relatively consistent, reliable results as compared to published values. Finally, a new design for a triaxial setup that enables integrated measurements of compressional and shear velocities in soil over a wide stress range is presented as groundwork for the characterization of the complete stiffness matrix of BBC. by Jana Marjanovic.

However, DEAs generally need very high actuation voltage that limits the possible applications and decreases the lifetime of an actuator. Although much {{research has been conducted}} to overcome the mentioned problems, efficient ways of lowering the working voltage are still in demand. Utilization of dielectric rubber composites is one of the popular approaches showing positive results. Namely, higher overall relative permittivity of the material allows reducing the actuation voltage if the mechanical properties are maintained at the initial level. The aim of the current work is to modify <b>acrylic</b> and epichlorohydrin <b>rubbers</b> by addition of dielectric and ferroelectric fillers, as well as two types of dielectric transformer oils, in order to obtain the a material with enhanced dielectric permittivity and low modulus.
