25|$|In 1981, PBS {{producers}} JoAnn Young and Paul Surratt pitched {{an idea to}} Shane: {{a reunion}} concert that the network could use as a fund raiser and that would include not only Shane's current group but also on stage reunions of the two original Kingston Trio lineups with Guard and Stewart.

25|$|Skeptic James Randi {{spent about}} an hour in New York being interviewed <b>and</b> <b>taped</b> for the report. James Randi later critiqued ABC for having cherry picked his {{comments}} to show more credibility for the 'faith-healer' than justified. Randi went on to have given scientific explanations for all the activities observed. Randi revealed the natural explanations for activities ranging from putting forceps in the nose, random cutting of the flesh, 'scraping' of the eyeball, the subsequent absence of infection, and other activities one by one as age old parlor tricks. However, he was dismayed that none of his critical comments were shown in the final segment. This was cut down to under 20 seconds of screen time.|$|E

25|$|The {{triumph of}} Minute by Minute was bittersweet, however, because it {{coincided with the}} near-dissolution of the band. The {{pressure}} of touring while recording and releasing an album each year had worn the members down. Jeff Baxter and Michael McDonald {{had been in the}} midst of a creative conflict for some time. McDonald desired a direct, soulful and polished rock/R sound, while Baxter insisted on embellishing guitar parts in an increasingly avant garde style. (Both McDonald and Baxter elaborated on the matter in the documentary series Behind the Music, which aired on VH1 in February 2001.) Just as the success of Minute by Minute had become apparent, founding drummer Hartman, longtime guitarist Baxter, and percussionist LaKind left the band. A two-song set on the January 27, 1979, broadcast of Saturday Night Live (with guest host Michael Palin) marked the final television appearance of this lineup, and a brief tour of Japan marked the last live performances of the band in its middle-period configuration (Hartman subsequently joined Johnston's touring band in 1979 <b>and</b> <b>taped</b> an appearance with Johnston that aired on Soundstage in 1980).|$|E

500|$|Hecht-Hill-Lancaster allowed Mackendrick to {{familiarize}} himself with New York City before shooting the movie. In Notes on Sweet Smell of Success, Mackendrick said, [...] "One of the characteristic aspects of New York, particularly {{of the area}} between 42nd Street and 57th Street, is the neurotic energy of the crowded sidewalks. This was, I argued, essential {{to the story of}} characters driven by the uglier aspects of ambition and greed".

500|$|Following the Beatles' brief {{efforts with}} [...] "Something" [...] on 28 January, Harrison talked with Lennon and Yoko Ono about {{recording}} a solo album of his unused songs, {{since he had}} already stockpiled enough compositions [...] "for the next ten years", given his usual allocation of two tracks per album, {{and in order to}} [...] "preserve this, the Beatle bit, more".
