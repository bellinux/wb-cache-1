40|$|Abstract — Current ad-hoc network {{protocols}} {{are designed}} for hosts {{similar to those used}} in fixed networks. Those protocols are not adequate for some applications of ad-hoc networks, where used resources are very scarce. One example is the size of the network addresses, which may be a critical issue, specially with the use of IPv 6 in DSR. This {{is due to the fact}} that this protocol uses source routing, so each datagram must carry the addresses of all the machines in its path. In this paper a new protocol named ADSR is proposed to solve this problem. This new protocol is a modified version of DSR based on using <b>abbreviated</b> <b>addresses.</b> The abbreviation procedure can lead to two different nodes having the same address, what we will named ’collision’. ADSR does not avoid but allow collisions, which is analyzed in this paper. Some results about this new protocol performance are shown. This results have been obtained by simulations implemented i...|$|R
5000|$|As {{the initial}} {{part of the}} address is familiar, it is often {{abbreviated}} - for example, [...] ("Kyoto Prefecture, Kyoto City") can be abbreviated to [...] ("Kyoto City"), as in the Kyoto Tower listing. More informally, particularly on return addresses for in-town mail, the city and ward can be abbreviated to the initial character, with a dot or comma to indicate abbreviation - there are only 11 wards of Kyoto, so this is easily understood. For example, 京都市 Kyōto-shi is abbreviated to 京、 Kyō- and 下京区 Shimogyō-ku is abbreviated to 下、Shimo-. Combining these (and dropping okurigana), one may <b>abbreviate</b> the <b>address</b> of Kyoto Tower to: ...|$|R

These protocols are not suitable for some applications of ad-hoc networks, where resources are very scarce. One point is the size of the network addresses, which may be a critical issue, specially with the use of IPv 6 in the DSR protocol. This is because this protocol uses source routing, and, therefore, each datagram must carry the addresses of all the machines in its path. In this paper a new protocol named ADSR is proposed to solve this problem. This new protocol is a modified version of DSR based on the use of <b>abbreviated</b> <b>addresses.</b> The abbreviation procedure can lead to two different nodes having the same address, which we will term collision. ADSR allows rather than averts collisions, as analysed in this paper. Some results on the performance of this new protocol are shown. These results have been obtained by simulations implemented on an ns- 2 network simulator. 1. Ad-Hoc Networks Ad-hoc networks are computer networks that are set up when needed. These networks are composed of the hosts that happen to be {{in the right place at}} the right time, and have no fixed infrastructure, like, for instance, the Internet. Wireless links, battery power and the right algorithms free these networks from the need for wires, access points, routers or external power [12]. These networks are made up of similar nodes with no hierarchy. Each host is able to produce, route and consume data. Preferably they should not need the assistance of any user or human administrator either...|$|R

Evidence is presented that the correct inflected form of an expanded abbreviation can in many cases be deduced solely from morphosyntactic tags of the context. The prediction model is a deep bidirectional LSTM network with tag embedding. The network is trained on over 10 million words from the Polish Sejm Corpus and achieves 74. 2 % prediction accuracy on a smaller, but more general National Corpus of Polish. Analysis of errors suggests that performance in this task may improve if some prior knowledge about the abbreviated word is incorporated into the model...|$|R
5000|$|Taylor was no {{ordinary}} staff officer, but an exceedingly capable and tireless worker with many responsibilities. He was effectively the chief aide-de-camp to General Lee throughout the war. And since Lee was noted for his small, over-worked staff, Taylor carried an enormous burden on his young shoulders. He wrote dispatches and orders for Lee, performed personal reconnaissance, and often carried messages in person to corps and division commanders. (The famous [...] "if practicable" [...] order from Lee to Richard S. Ewell below Cemetery Hill in the Battle of Gettysburg was verbally transmitted by Taylor.) He greeted all persons who came to see Lee, and usually decided whether they would be announced to the General. Taylor eventually attained a rank almost commensurate with his great staff responsibilities, being promoted to lieutenant colonel on December 12, 1863. (In postbellum writings, he is generally referred to as colonel, {{but this is a}} customary <b>abbreviated</b> title for <b>addressing</b> a lieutenant colonel.) ...|$|R
40|$|Background: Many {{attempts}} have been made to abbreviate mindfulness programmes in order to make them more accessible for general and clinical populations while maintaining their therapeutic components and efficacy. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of an 8 -week mindfulness-based intervention (MBI) programme and a 4 -week abbreviated version for the improvement of well-being in a non-clinical population. Method: A quasi-experimental, controlled, pilot study was conducted with pre-post and 6 -month follow-up measurements and three study conditions (8 - and 4 -session MBI programmes and a matched no-treatment control group, with a sample of 48, 46, and 47 participants in each condition, respectively). Undergraduate students were recruited, and mindfulness, positive and negative affect, self-compassion, resilience, anxiety, and depression were assessed. Mixed-effects multi-level analyses for repeated measures were performed. Results: The intervention groups showed significant improvements compared to controls in mindfulness and positive affect at the 2 - and 6 -month follow-ups, with no differences between 8 - vs. 4 -session programmes. The only difference between the abbreviated MBI vs. the standard MBI was found in self-kindness at 6 months, favoring the standard MBI. There were marginal differences in anxiety between the controls vs. the abbreviated MBI, but there were differences between the controls vs. the standard MBI at 2 - and 6 -months, with higher levels in the controls. There were no differences in depression between the controls vs. the abbreviated MBI, but differences were found between the controls vs. the standard MBI at 2 - and 6 -months, favoring the standard MBI. There were no differences with regard to negative affect and resilience. Conclusion: To our knowledge, this is the first study to directly investigate the efficacy of a standard 8 -week MBI and a 4 -week abbreviated protocol in the same population. Based on our findings, both programmes performed better than controls, with similar effect size (ES). The efficacy of abbreviated mindfulness programmes may be similar to that of a standard MBI programme, making them potentially more accessible for a larger number of populations. Nevertheless, further studies with more powerful designs to compare the non-inferiority of the <b>abbreviated</b> protocol and <b>addressing</b> clinical populations are warranted.
