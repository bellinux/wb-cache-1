5|$|In 1779, the Comanches began raiding the Bucareli area, and the {{settlers}} chose to move further {{east to the}} old mission of Nacogdoches, where they founded the town of the same name.

5|$|In 1906, a {{group of}} Puerto Ricans met with the {{appointed}} Governor Winthrop, and suggested the organization of a Puerto Rican National Guard.

5|$|Shortly {{after the}} start of class, {{kindergarten}} teacher Rebecca Adler (Robin Tunney) becomes dysphasic, falls to the floor, and experiences seizures. Dr. James Wilson (Robert Sean Leonard) attempts to convince the curmudgeonly Gregory House to treat Adler, but House initially dismisses him, believing that the case would be boring. Hospital administrator Dr. Lisa Cuddy (Lisa Edelstein) approaches House in the elevator and attempts to persuade him to fulfill his duties at the hospital's walk-in clinic, a task House loathes because the cases are usually simplistic. House refuses, claiming that Cuddy cannot fire him due to tenure, and hurriedly leaves. When House's team attempts to perform an MRI on Adler, they discover that House's <b>authorization</b> for diagnostics has been revoked; Cuddy restores his <b>authorization</b> in exchange for his working at the clinic.|$|E

5|$|After Nixon won re-election, {{inflation}} was returning. He reimposed price controls in June 1973. The price controls became unpopular {{with the public}} and businesspeople, who saw powerful labor unions as preferable to the price board bureaucracy. The controls produced food shortages, as meat disappeared from grocery stores and farmers drowned chickens rather than sell them at a loss. Despite the failure to control inflation, controls were slowly ended, and on April 30, 1974, their statutory <b>authorization</b> lapsed.|$|E

40|$|International audienceWith the {{emergence}} of XML as the de facto standard to exchange and disseminate information, the problem of regulating access to XML documents has attracted a considerable attention in recent years. Existing models attach <b>authorizations</b> to nodes of an XML document but disregard relationships between them. However, ancestor and sibling relationships may reveal information as sensitive as the one {{carried out by the}} nodes themselves (e. g., classification). This paper advocates the integration of relationships as first class citizen in the access control models for XML and makes the following contributions. First, it characterizes important relationship <b>authorizations</b> and identifies the mechanisms required to translate them accurately in an authorized view of a source document. Second, it introduces a rule-based formulation for expressing these classes of relationship <b>authorizations</b> and defines an associated conflict resolution strategy. Third, it proposes tractable algorithms to support relationship <b>authorizations.</b> Rather than being yet-another XML access control model, the proposed approach allows a seamless integration of relationship <b>authorizations</b> in existing XML access control model...|$|R
