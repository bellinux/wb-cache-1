5|$|In September 1988, {{during the}} 20th anniversary celebration of Evergreen Marine Corporation's founding, company {{chairman}} Chang Yung-fa announced his company's intentions to establish Taiwan's first private international airline. The {{opportunity to create}} a major Taiwanese airline had just arisen following {{a decision by the}} Taiwanese government to liberalise the country's air transportation system. Government requirements still mandated global experience and financial capital requirements for <b>any</b> <b>company</b> seeking permission to initiate international airline service from Taiwan.|$|E
5|$|The {{fighting}} {{north of}} Taegu on September 11 {{in the vicinity}} of Hills 660 and 314 was heavy and confused. For a time, the 1st Cavalry Division feared a breakthrough to the blocking position of the 3d Battalion, 7th Cavalry. The rifle companies of the division were now very low in strength. Johnson stated later that <b>any</b> <b>company</b> of the 3rd Battalion, 8th Cavalry, that had 100 men during this period was his assault company for the day.|$|E

5|$|In May 2010, Franken {{proposed}} a financial reform legislation {{amendment that would}} create a board to select which credit rating agency would evaluate a given security. Currently <b>any</b> <b>company</b> issuing a security may select the company that evaluates the security. The amendment was passed; however, the financial industry lobbied to have Franken's amendment removed from the final bill. Negotiations between the Senate and House, whose version of financial reform did not include such a provision, resulted in the amendment's being watered down to require only {{a series of studies}} being done upon the issue for two years. After the studies, if the Securities and Exchange Commission has not implemented another solution to the conflict of interest problem, Franken's solution would go into effect.|$|E
5|$|The {{brothers}} went on {{an extensive}} hiatus from professional wrestling, beginning in August 2004. As was announced before ROH's Scramble Cage Melee, Mark {{was injured in}} a motorcycle accident between Testing the Limit and that show, and thus both brothers had left Ring of Honor. As Jay didn't wish to return to wrestling without his brother, they stopped taking bookings from <b>any</b> <b>company.</b> After making their returns in mid-2005 to Pro Wrestling Unplugged, followed in late 2005 at ROH, the company they had regularly been working for {{at the time of}} Mark's accident, hyped their return at the Fourth Anniversary Show in February 2006.|$|E
5|$|A new {{contract}} was signed on 19 July 2011 with Odebrecht; R$400million {{of the total}} would be financed by BNDES and the remaining R$420million would come from tax credits granted by the City. A 2007 law stated the tax credits {{could be used by}} <b>any</b> <b>company</b> that established itself in the Eastern region of the city, providing a credit of R$0.60 per R$1.00 invested. A new law was passed by the city legislature to deal specifically with this stadium and reduce the incentives, linking the concession of the credits to hosting the World Cup opening match and limiting the total amount of credits to R$420million. The concession was justified by the expectation that the stadium will generate R$950 million in city taxes during the six years after its opening. R$530 million in excess of the tax credits were given. The financing contract with BNDES was signed on 29 November 2013, under their ProCopas Arenas World Cup program. Caixa Econômica Federal is the distributing agent.|$|E

5|$|By the {{outbreak}} of World War I in 1914, Bayer was facing competition in all its major markets from local ASA producers {{as well as other}} German drug firms (particularly Heyden and Hoechst). The British market was immediately closed to the German companies, but British manufacturing could not meet the demand—especially with phenol supplies, necessary for ASA synthesis, largely being used for explosives manufacture. On 5 February 1915, Bayer's UK trademarks were voided, so that <b>any</b> <b>company</b> could use the term aspirin. The Australian market was taken over by Aspro, after the makers of Nicholas-Aspirin lost a short-lived exclusive right to the aspirin name there. In the United States, Bayer was still under German control—though the war disrupted the links between the American Bayer plant and the German Bayer headquarters—but phenol shortage threatened to reduce aspirin production to a trickle, and imports across the Atlantic Ocean were blocked by the Royal Navy.|$|E
