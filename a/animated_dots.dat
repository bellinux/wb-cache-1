50|$|Dot and the Whale is an Australian {{animated}} film from 1986. It {{is based on}} the character <b>Dot</b> from the <b>animated</b> film <b>Dot</b> and the Kangaroo (1977), which in turn was based on the children's book of the same name by Ethel Pedley.|$|R

50|$|In the Australian <b>animated</b> film <b>Dot</b> and the Kangaroo, two hopping mice {{near the}} end of the waterhole scene sang a song about a bushgirl who is pretty to the tune of Pretty Little Dutch Girl after they see Dot {{touching}} the bandicoot and scaring it and made the bandicoot jump in the waterhole where Dot laughs on what she did and the hopping mice laugh as well, so they did the same thing Dot did. One of the hopping mice pushed the other one into the waterhole.|$|R

He also acted in several films, the 1969 film The Intruders, the 1973 film And Millions Will Die, {{and was one of}} the voices in the <b>animated</b> movie <b>Dot</b> and the Kangaroo (1977). Under the Vic Sabrino name he had a short-lived television series in 1958 called Vic Sabrino Sings. He was briefly married to actress Rowena Wallace ...|$|R
50|$|Cephalopods {{have also}} been {{depicted}} in animated feature films for family audiences. Finding Nemo (2003) includes a flapjack octopus among its cast of aquatic characters. Toy Story 3 (2010) features a toy rubber octopus named Stretch (voiced by Whoopi Goldberg) and Shark Tale (2004) features an octopus named Luca (voiced by Vincent Pastore). An octopus named Dave (voiced by John Malkovich) is the main antagonist in the 2014 Penguins of Madagascar movie. The Australian <b>animated</b> film <b>Dot</b> and the Whale (1986) features a giant octopus with magical powers.|$|R
50|$|Kids' CBC {{started in}} 2003, {{replacing}} Get Set for Life. Previous hosts Court and Clarke continued to appear, {{but the main}} focus was on five regional hosts from various parts of Canada. The hosts were Patty Sullivan (Ontario), Joyce Quansah (Quebec), Kush Uppal (British Columbia), Hayley Gene (Manitoba) and Dashi Malone (Newfoundland). The look and the studio sets had also been drastically changed. The child seen in the GSFL logo was slightly redesigned {{and turned into a}} separate <b>animated</b> character called <b>Dot</b> (not {{to be confused with the}} PBS Kids character of the same name).|$|R
50|$|Shipwrecked, 1999, is {{a mature}} example of Larwill’s {{intuitive}} approach to making art. Larwill was a keen sailor who appreciated the shape, feel {{and texture of}} timber-hulled boats. A voracious reader of the stories of seafarers and pirates, elements of the local environment and coastal folklore became important components of his work. The arrangement of the figures, boat, shields, marks and <b>dots</b> <b>animate</b> the painting. With its strong primitivist inclinations and clear stylistic references to Indigenous art, Shipwrecked combines the style of painting and sculpture Larwill developed subsequent to his time in New York. The palette of predominantly ochre, red and browns laid down over a bed of white and creams was a combination that features {{in a number of}} Larwill’s large works from the late 1990s and early 2000s.|$|R
40|$|International audienceInteractive visual {{applications}} often rely on animation {{to transition}} from one display state to another. There are multiple animation techniques to choose from, {{and it is}} not always clear which should produce the best visual correspondences between display elements. One major factor is whether the animation relies on staggering [...] an incremental delay in start times across the moving elements. It has been suggested that staggering may reduce occlusion, while also reducing display complexity and producing less overwhelming animations, though no empirical evidence has demonstrated these advantages. Work in perceptual psychology does show that reducing occlusion, and reducing inter-object proximity (crowding) more generally, improves performance in multiple object tracking. We ran simulations confirming that staggering can in some cases reduce crowding in <b>animated</b> transitions involving <b>dot</b> clouds (as found in, e. g., animated 2 D scatterplots). We empirically evaluated the effect of two staggering techniques on tracking tasks, focusing on cases that should most favour staggering. We found that introducing staggering has a negligible, or even negative, impact on multiple object tracking performance. The potential benefits of staggering may be outweighed by strong costs: a loss of common-motion grouping information about which objects travel in similar paths, and less predictability about when any specific object would begin to move. Staggering may be beneficial in some conditions, but they have yet to be demonstrated. The present results are a significant step toward a better understanding of animation pacing, and provide direction for further research...|$|R
