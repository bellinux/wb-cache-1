5|$|The <b>andesite</b> lava of Ember Ridge {{comprises}} 55% brownish-green {{volcanic glass}} with a trachytic matrix of plagioclase. About 35% of Ember Ridge <b>andesite</b> contains phenocrysts of hornblende, augite, plagioclase and orthopyroxene and exist as isolated crystals and clots. A feature south of Ember Ridge, unofficially known as Betty's Bump, comprises <b>andesite</b> with phenocrysts of plagioclase, augite and olivine. Dark brown volcanic glass composes the Betty's Bump <b>andesite</b> {{as much as}} 20%. The relationship of Betty's Bump with Ember Ridge is unclear but it likely represents a separate volcanic feature due to its topographic isolation.|$|E
5|$|Calabozos {{lies between}} two {{different}} types of volcanism—to its north, <b>andesite</b> and rhyolite are the primary constituents of lava while its southern neighbors are composed of more mafic <b>andesite</b> and basalt. It is mainly basaltic <b>andesite</b> and rhyodacite that make up Calabozos, forming a calcalkilic suite rich with potassium. Its lavas are dotted with phenocrysts, which vary from 2 to 25percent of their mass. These phenocrysts are typically made of plagioclase, but also contain clinopyroxene, orthopyroxene, ilmenite, apatite, and titanomagnetite.|$|E

During the Pleistocene, the Quebrada de las Cuevas valley was filled and the flanking hills covered by pumice by an ignimbrite (1.59 mya) from the Cerro Bayo vent. Between Cerro Lila and Cerro Cajeros and Laguna de los Patos, Quaternary <b>andesites</b> and basaltic <b>andesites</b> of aphyric olivine composition formed small cones and flows.

5|$|Mount Bailey {{heads the}} Mount Bailey chain, which {{consists}} of the mountain and smaller cinder cones trending north. Similarly to its neighbor Mount Thielsen, it is a shield volcano with precipitous summit slopes, and the two are almost equal in appearance. Built {{around the same time}} as Rodley Butte, according to morphological study, the current volcano is no more than 100,000 years old, and formed relatively close to Diamond Peak's current cone. Despite its similarity to Rodley Butte, both in age and original composition, Bailey switched from erupting basaltic <b>andesite</b> to pure <b>andesite</b> (silicon dioxide).|$|E
5|$|Recent {{volcanism}} in the Cascades, lasting from 7 to 2 mya, produced largely basaltic and basaltic andesite-based material (up to 50percent). On {{the eastern}} side of the High Cascades, however, volcanoes erupted dacite, <b>andesite,</b> and rhyolite. These materials made up several types of eruptions: lava flows, domes, and pyroclastic flows. In the most recent volcanic activity, <b>andesite,</b> basalt, and rhyolite have been erupted from High Cascades volcanoes, particularly the Three Sisters, Broken Top, Mount Hood, Mount Jefferson, and Crater Lake.|$|E

40|$|Within the Zita ¤ cuaro^Valle de Bravo (ZVB) {{region of}} the central Mexican Volcanic Belt (MVB), three lava series have erupted during the Quaternary: (1) high-K 2 O basaltic <b>andesites</b> and andesites; (2) medium-K 2 O basaltic <b>andesites,</b> <b>andesites</b> and dacites; (3) high-TiO 2 basalts and basaltic <b>andesites.</b> The {{dominant}} feature {{of the first two}} groups is the lack of plagioclase accompanying the various ferromagnesian phenocrysts (olivine, orthopyroxene, augite, and hornblende) in all but the dacites. This absence of plagioclase in the phenocryst assemblages of the high-K 2 O and medium-K 2 O intermediate lavas is significant because it indicates high water contents during the stage of phenocryst equilibration. In contrast, the high-TiO 2 group is characterized by phenocrysts of plagioclase and olivine. The spatial distribution of these three lava series is systematic.

40|$|The Xiong'er {{volcanic}} rocks {{constitute a}} large Paleo-Mesoproterozoic volcanic belt {{along the southern}} margin of the North China Craton, which are composed primarily of basaltic <b>andesites</b> and <b>andesites,</b> with minor dacites and dacitic rhyolites. The basaltic <b>andesites</b> and <b>andesites</b> from the Xiong'er volcanic rocks in the Zhongtiao Mountain show consistent e{open}Nd(t), La/Nb and Th/Nb values irrespectively of SiO 2, which preclude significant crustal contamination during ascent. Both of these volcanic rocks share similar incompatible ratios (e. g. La/Sm, Zr/Nb, La/Nb), indicating that the basaltic <b>andesites</b> and <b>andesites</b> originated from the same source. The basaltic <b>andesites</b> are characterized by high Mg-number (45 - 55 %), precluding the possibility of their derivation from the melting of the lower crust. Variable Ti/Eu, Zr/Sm and Nb/La ratios for the basaltic <b>andesites</b> with higher partial melting degree suggest that amphiboles remained as residues in the magma source, indicating that the Xiong'er volcanic rocks were derived from hydrous magma. Non-radiogenic Nd isotopes for the Xiong'er volcanic rocks are inherited from a mantle source which had been enriched by the subduction-related crustal recycling during Archean to Paleoproterozoic time. Basaltic <b>andesites</b> show HFSE enrichments (especially Nb > 4. 7  ppm) and high Fe-Ti contents, comparable with Nb-enriched basalts, suggesting that the Xiong'er volcanic rocks were derived from a metasomatized mantle source, {{similar to that of}} Nb-enriched basalts. Therefore, the mantle source of the Xiong'er volcanic rocks in the Zhongtiao Mountain has been enriched in Fe-Ti oxides and HFSE by equilibrium reactions with the slab melts during late Archean and Paleoproterozoic subduction processes, as evidenced by Nd isotopes. In the primitive mantle normalized trace element diagrams, the Xiong'er volcanic rocks show enrichments in the LILE and LREE and negative anomalies on the Nb-Ta-Ti, similar to arc-related volcanic rocks produced by the hydrous melting of the metasomatized mantle wedge. In the Paleo-Mesoproterozoic, the Xiong'er volcanic rocks in the Zhongtiao Mountain were produced by the slab dehydration-induced melting of an existing metasomatized mantle source, and the fluids from the slab dehydration introduced significant LILE and LREE to the source, masking its inherent HFSE-enriched characteristics. The arc-related characteristics of the Xiong'er volcanic rocks in the Zhongtiao Mountain suggest the Xiong'er volcanic belt constructs a subduction zone along the southern margin of the North China Craton in the Paleo-Mesoproterozoic, implying that the craton may have recorded the outbuilding history of the Columbia Supercontinent during Paleo-Mesoproterozoic time. © 2007 Elsevier B.

40|$|Neodymium (Nd) and {{strontium}} (Sr) isotopic {{data are}} presented for Paleoproterozoic metavolcanic {{rocks in the}} southern part of the Ashanti volcanic belt of Ghana. The metavolcanic rocks are predominantly basalts/basaltic <b>andesites</b> and <b>andesites</b> with minor dacites. Two types of basalts/basaltic <b>andesites</b> (B/A), Type I and Type II, have been identified. The Type I B/A are stratigraphically overlain by the Type II B/A, followed by the <b>andesites</b> and the dacites. The analyzed volcanic rocks commonly have low initial (87) Sr/(86) Sr ratios consistent with previous studies on Paleoproterozoic rocks from the West African craton. The LREE-depleted, tholeiitic Type I B/A exhibit back-arc basin geochemical signatures and show high positive epsilon Nd (i. e., ε(Nd) (2. 1 Ga) = + 3. 89 to + 7. 21), which suggest a long term depleted source and also indicate that they were produced in an entirely oceanic environment devoid of influence of continental crust. The isotope signatures are thus consistent with the previously published trace element data of the Type I basalts/basaltic <b>andesites</b> in suggesting that their parent magma was generated from a depleted mantle. The Type I B/A have Nd model ages (T(DM 2)) of 1. 83 – 2. 09 Ga similar to their formation ages, suggesting that they were juvenile at their time of formation. The <b>andesites</b> and the Type II B/A <b>andesites</b> show LREE-enriched patterns and exhibit characteristics of subduction zone-related magmas, and show initial ε(Nd) (2. 1 Ga) values of – 1. 15 to + 1. 35 and Nd model ages (T(DM 2)) of 2. 32 – 2. 58 Ga. The LREE-enriched dacitic porphyry also exhibits characteristics of subduction zone-related magmas, and have initial ε(Nd) (2. 1 Ga) value of – 2. 24 and Nd model ages (T(DM 2)) of 2. 64 Ga. The Nd isotopic data confirms the juvenile character of the Birimian crust, but also suggests some contributions of a pre-Birimian crustal material (or Archean?) in the genesis of some of the metavolcanic rocks. Our isotopic result is consistent with the island arc complex model which views Paleoproteozoic terranes of West Africa in the context of subduction–accretion processes...|$|R
