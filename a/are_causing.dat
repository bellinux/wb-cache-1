For example, the Lymantria dispar multicapsid nuclear polyhedrosis virus has been used to spray large areas of forest in North America where larvae of the gypsy moth <b>are</b> <b>causing</b> serious defoliation. The moth larvae are killed by the virus they have eaten and die, the disintegrating cadavers leaving virus particles on the foliage to infect other larvae.|$|E

40|$|Ehrlichiosis is a {{group of}} diseases, usually named {{according}} to the host species and the type of white blood cell most often infected. Canine monocytic ehrlichiosis <b>is</b> <b>caused</b> by Ehrlichia canis and, occasionally, E. chaffeensis. Canine granulocytic ehrlichiosis <b>is</b> <b>caused</b> by Anaplasma phagocytophilum and Ehrlichia ewingii. Equine monocytic ehrlichiosis/Potomac horse fever <b>is</b> <b>caused</b> by Neorickettsia risticii (formerly Ehrlichia risticii).

5|$|Current {{sea level}} rise, {{increased}} cyclonic activity, increased ambient temperatures, and increasingly fickle precipitation patterns are {{effects of global}} warming that have affected or are projected to impact India. Thousands {{of people have been}} displaced by ongoing sea level rises that have submerged low-lying islands in the Sundarbans. Temperature rises on the Tibetan Plateau <b>are</b> <b>causing</b> Himalayan glaciers to retreat, threatening the flow rate of the Ganges, Brahmaputra, Yamuna, and other major rivers; the livelihoods {{of hundreds of thousands of}} farmers depend on these rivers. A 2007 World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) report states that the Indus River may run dry for the same reason.|$|E
5|$|Pituitary tumors require {{treatment}} {{when they}} <b>are</b> <b>causing</b> specific symptoms, such as headaches, visual field defects or excessive hormone secretion. Transsphenoidal surgery (removal {{of the tumor}} by an operation through the nose and the sphenoidal sinuses) may, apart from addressing symptoms related to the tumor, also improve pituitary function, although the gland is sometimes damaged further {{as a result of}} the surgery. When the tumor is removed by craniotomy (opening the skull), recovery is less likely–but sometimes this is the only suitable way to approach the tumor. After surgery, it may take some time for hormone levels to change significantly. Retesting the pituitary hormone levels is therefore performed 2 to 3 months later.|$|E

5|$|The film {{shows how}} the demand for cotton in India {{has led to the}} {{planting}} of genetically modified (GM) cotton, and how the monopoly inherent in its use by seed companies causes an increase in the price of cotton, leading to suicides among farmers who lose their land to these companies because they cannot pay the higher seed prices. GM crops need more pesticides, causing environmental damage, birth defects leading to mental and physical disabilities among the Punjab people, and an increased rate of cancer. The film claims that sometimes the companies that produce the pesticides are the same ones that produce the needed medications. A similar scenario occurs in contaminated cotton fields in Texas, where pesticides <b>are</b> <b>causing</b> brain tumors. The garment industry is the second-most-polluting industry the world, according to the film, which is illustrated by leather tanneries pouring chromium into the Ganges River in Kanpur, India.|$|E
5|$|Three {{years after}} Rainbow Program's deactivation, {{there is a}} {{resurgence}} of terrorist activities, with the White Mask being the most prominent. The terrorists' goals are unknown, yet they <b>are</b> <b>causing</b> chaos across the world. To counter this rising threat, the program is reactivated by a new leader who is simply known as Six (voiced by Angela Bassett). Six assembles a group of special forces operatives from different countries to face and combat the White Masks. Recruits go through multiple exercises {{to prepare them for}} future encounters with the White Masks, training to perform hostage rescue and bomb disposal. Eventually, the White Masks launch a chemical attack on a university (called Bartlett University), and the recruits are sent to disarm the bombs and eliminate the enemy presence. The operation is a massive success, though there are casualties. The story ends with Six affirming that the reactivation of Team Rainbow is the best and only choice in a time filled with risks and uncertainties. Team Rainbow is ready for their next mission – to hunt down the leader of their enemy – and they stand prepared to protect and defend their nation from terrorists.|$|E
5|$|In the present, former Imperial knight Yuri Lowell goes on {{a mission}} to {{retrieve}} his neighborhood's blastia core from a nobleman when their reservoir fails. While on his mission, he encounters a noble woman called Estelle, and flees with her from the capital in pursuit of the blastia thief. On their journey, they also meet Karol, a trainee hunter separated from his guild; a blastia researcher named Rita; Raven, a Great War veteran; Judith, a Krytia who seeks to destroy the blastia harming the aer balance; and exclusive to the PS3 version only, seemingly the descender of a legendary pirate Aifread named Patty Fleur. Together, the group recover the stolen core from a corrupt guild leader and return it to Yuri's friend and former fellow knight Flynn. Yuri and Karol then decide to form an independent guild called Brave Vesperia. Shortly after this, Estelle is attacked by an Entelexeia called Phaeroh, who accuses her of poisoning the planet. After investigating and meeting a second time with Phaeroh, Brave Vesperia learn that Estelle is a Child of the Full Moon, capable of converting aer into magic without the aid of a blastia core, and that her actions <b>are</b> <b>causing</b> the aer krene, the sources of aer, to overproduce aer with deadly results. Alongside these events, Yuri sees that the Imperial authorities are powerless to act against powerful figures involved in blastia abuse: he takes matters into his own hands and murders two officials connected to the abuses. These acts put a strain on his friendship with Flynn.|$|E
