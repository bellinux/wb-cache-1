40|$|Handicrafts {{form part}} of the {{micro-enterprise}} sector {{and most of the}} entrepreneurs in this sector are women. Women engage in this business as self-employment and income generating activities to support their livelihood. In Zanzibar many women engage in this business to generate income for supporting their families. Despite the fact that these women have been engaging in this business {{for a long period of}} time, yet their income standard is still low, thus they remain in poverty situation. The study that was conducted in the Urban District - Zanzibar revealed that among the factors that hinder the development of this sector were lack <b>of</b> <b>sales</b> <b>outlet</b> for the women handicraft products and poor quality of their products. Different tools of data collection were employed during the survey. These include mailed questionnaires, record review, interviews and observations. The results of the study led to the implementation of the project titled "Establishment <b>of</b> <b>Sales</b> <b>Outlet</b> for Women Handicraft Producers". The main goal of this project is to enhance the women handicraft producers' income so as to improve their life standards.

40|$|Background: Adolescent {{overweight}} and obesity rates are increasing in Norway. Adolescents {{spend a lot}} of time at school and the school neighborhood food environment could affect adolescents’ dietary behavior and development of {{overweight and}} obesity. Access to unhealthy foods at school can contribute to a high intake of unhealthy food items and beverages during the school day. The availability <b>of</b> food <b>sales</b> <b>outlets</b> in the school neighborhoods is one environmental determinant that may be of great importance for adolescents’ dietary behavior. One of the first steps when investigating a neighborhood food environment is to obtain descriptive data of the presence <b>of</b> food <b>sales</b> <b>outlets</b> and the availability of food items. The knowledge of the neighborhood food environment and the effect on dietary habits are inconclusive and based on research from countries where the food environments may not be representative for Norway. Consequently, there is a need for research from Norwegian school neighborhood food environments. An instrument for investigating adolescents’ food environment by measuring availability and linear shelf space of food items in food <b>sales</b> <b>outlets</b> in school neighborhoods was developed and evaluated within a research project in Oslo in 2009. This thesis is the continuation of that previous research. Objective: To describe the availability (if food is present or not) and accessibility (measured in linear shelf space or number of varieties) of food items in food <b>sales</b> <b>outlets</b> around primary and lower secondary schools in eastern Norway, and to explore variation by the schools socio-economic position and possible associations with schools’ mean frequency of the intake per week of selected food items by 7 th grade pupils. Design: Cross sectional data from the HEIA-study (involving primary schools) collected in May 2009 and from HEIA II (involving lower secondary schools) are analyzed in this thesis to answer the objectives and aims. Methods and sample: There were 37 primary schools and 36 lower secondary schools in the samples. Food <b>sales</b> <b>outlets</b> were identified in the neighborhoods of the schools by using internet-based map services and by physically checking the neighborhood on the day of data collection. An observational form designed for direct observation <b>of</b> food <b>sales</b> <b>outlets</b> was used to measure availability and accessibility of 16 food items and beverages. Descriptive data and comparative data between the two types of schools are presented. Data to determine socio-economic position of each school were collected by questionnaire from 37 and 32 principals from the primary- and lower secondary schools, respectively. Social disparities in the food environment and its food <b>sales</b> <b>outlets</b> were investigated in the sample. Data on the adolescents’ diet were collected by questionnaire from 945 7 th graders (primary school). Associations between the school mean frequency of the intake per week of seven selected food items and both the number <b>of</b> food <b>sales</b> <b>outlets</b> in the school neighborhood and the accessibility of the seven selected food items were analyzed by One-way ANOVA and correlation analyses. Results: Food <b>sales</b> <b>outlets</b> were found around 25 (68 %) of the primary schools and 28 (78 %) of the lower secondary schools. The number of outlets in each school neighborhood was at its highest nine but with a mean of 1. 6 and 1. 8 (no significant difference) in primary- and lower secondary schools. The total number of outlets around each school type (primary- vs. lower secondary schools) was similar (60 / 65). The food <b>sales</b> <b>outlets</b> were supermarkets, kiosks and gas stations with a frequency of occurrence in the mentioned order. Across all types <b>of</b> food <b>sales</b> <b>outlets,</b> the most available food items were those defined as unhealthy. The accessibility of soft drinks with sugar was significantly higher, and another nine food items of the 13 investigated was non-significantly higher, in the neighborhoods of lower secondary schools compared to primary schools. Schools of lower socio-economic position (both primary- and lower secondary schools) had non-significantly higher number <b>of</b> food <b>sales</b> <b>outlets</b> in the neighborhood, higher accessibility of the majority of the food items and in addition a trend of more kiosks and fewer supermarkets, compared to schools of higher socio-economic position. There was a significant lower school mean frequency of raw vegetables intake per week in schools with more than one food <b>sales</b> <b>outlet</b> in the neighborhood compared to school neighborhoods with only one or no food <b>sales</b> <b>outlet.</b> This pattern was also found as a border-line significant negative correlation between school mean frequency of raw vegetables intake per week and the accessibility in the school neighborhoods. Conclusions: Food <b>sales</b> <b>outlets</b> were present in approximately three quarters of the school neighborhoods but the number <b>of</b> food <b>sales</b> <b>outlets</b> in each school neighborhood varied and there were no clear difference between primary- and lower secondary schools. The accessibility of soft drinks with sugar was significantly higher, and another nine food items of the 13 investigated was non-significantly higher, in the neighborhoods of lower secondary schools compared to primary schools. Non-significant school neighborhood disparities related to socio-economic position was present. The food environment and its food <b>sales</b> <b>outlets</b> in Norwegian school neighborhoods need to be investigated more as a potential environmental factor that may affect dietary behavior and body weight of adolescents. Future studies should investigate adolescents’ use <b>of</b> food <b>sales</b> <b>outlets</b> and/or store size adjusted analyses with ratio of healthy/unhealthy food items as well as social disparities in this...|$|R

All in all, although alcohol prices do appear to influence consumption behaviour in Russia, in most cases the size of effect is modest. The finding that two particularly problematic drinks-cheap vodka and fortified wine-are substitute goods also suggests that increasing their prices may not lead to smaller alcohol consumption.

These weights are usually based upon expenditure data obtained from expenditure surveys for a sample of households or upon estimates of the composition of consumption expenditure in the National Income and Product Accounts. Although some of the sampling of items for price collection is done using a sampling frame and probabilistic sampling methods, many items and outlets are chosen in a commonsense way (purposive sampling) that does not permit estimation of confidence intervals. Therefore, the sampling variance cannot be calculated. In any case, a single estimate is required in most of the purposes for which the index is used.|$|R

40|$|Purpose Although {{previous}} {{studies have suggested that}} greater community densities <b>of</b> alcohol <b>sales</b> <b>outlets</b> are associated with greater alcohol use and problems, the mechanisms are unclear. The present study examined whether density was associated with increased purchasing of alcohol by adolescents younger than the legal purchase age of 18 in Australia. Methods The number of alcohol outlets per 10, 000 population was identified within geographic regions in Victoria, Australia. A state-representative student survey (N = 10, 143) identified adolescent reports of purchasing alcohol, and multilevel modeling was then used to predict the effects for different densities of outlet types (packaged, club, on-premise, general, and overall). Results Each extra <b>sales</b> <b>outlet</b> per 10, 000 population was associated with {{a significant increase in the}} risk of underage adolescent purchasing. The strongest effect was for club density (odds ratio = 1. 22) and packaged (takeaway) outlet density (odds ratio = 1. 12). Males, older children, smokers, and those with substance-using friends were more likely to purchase alcohol. Conclusions One mechanism by which alcohol <b>sales</b> <b>outlet</b> density may influence population rates of alcohol use and related problems is through increasing the illegal underage purchasing of alcohol. © 2015 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine...|$|R

Although alcohol <b>sales</b> <b>outlets</b> are prohibited from selling alcohol to underage youth, there has been limited research investigating compliance. The present study sought to estimate the extent to which adolescents that appeared underage were successfully able to purchase alcohol from packaged liquor outlets in Australia; and to identify store and sales characteristics associated with illegal purchasing.

Confederates successfully purchased alcohol at 60 % (95 % CI: 55 - 66) of outlets. The density of general alcohol outlets in the surrounding area and the type of liquor outlet were predictors of successful alcohol purchases; however, this was moderated by the state in which the purchase was made. Regional geographical location was also found to predict underage alcohol purchase.
