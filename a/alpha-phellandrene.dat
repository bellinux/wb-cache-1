Black pepper {{contains}} between 4.6% and 9.7% piperine by mass, and white pepper slightly more than that. Refined piperine, by weight, is about one percent as hot as the capsaicin found in chili peppers. The outer fruit layer, left on black pepper, also contains aroma-contributing terpenes, including germacrene (11%), limonene (10%), pinene (10%), <b>alpha-phellandrene</b> (9%), and beta-caryophyllene (7%), which give citrusy, woody, and floral notes. These scents are mostly missing in white pepper, which is stripped of the fruit layer. White pepper can gain different odours (including musty notes) from its longer fermentation stage. The aroma of pepper is attributed to rotundone (3,4,5,6,7,8-Hexahydro-3α,8α-dimethyl-5α-(1-methylethenyl)azulene-1(2H)-one), a sesquiterpene originally discovered in the tubers of cyperus rotundus, which can be detected in concentrations of 0.4 nanograms/L in water and in wine: rotundone is also present in marjoram, oregano, rosemary, basil, thyme, and geranium, {{as well as in}} some Shiraz wines.|$|E

This indicates {{an accumulation of}} the proto-photocycloadducts during the reaction. The product analysis indicated the [2 + 2] and [4 + 2] cycloadditions are mutually independent processes...|$|E
40|$|Anaerobic {{degradation}} of natural monoterpenes by microorganisms was evaluated by using Pseudomonas citronellolis DSM 50332 and enrichment cultures containing nitrate as an electron acceptor. P. citronellolis grew anaerobically on 3, 7 -dimethyl- 1 -octanol and citronellol {{but not on}} geraniol, nerol, and alicyclic monoterpenes. In contrast, several a-, mono-, and bicyclic monoterpenes supported microbial growth and denitrification in enrichment cultures. We found that consumption of linalool, menthol, menth- 1 -ene, <b>alpha-phellandrene,</b> limonene, 2 -carene, alpha-pinene, and fenchone in enrichment cultures depended {{on the presence of}} living microorganisms and nitrate. In these experiments, the ratios of number of electrons derived from complete substrate oxidation to number of electrons derived from nitrate reduction ranged from 1. 2 : 1 to 2. 9 : 1. Microbial degradation was accompanied by the formation of small traces of monoterpenes, which were characterized by gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy. The formation of geraniol and geranial from linalool suggested that a 3, 1 -hydroxyl-delta 1 -delta 2 -mutase reaction initiates linalool degradation. Seven strains of motile, oval to rod-shaped, facultatively denitrifying bacteria were isolated on agar bottle plates by using linalool, menthol, menth- 1 -ene, <b>alpha-phellandrene,</b> 2 -carene, eucalyptol, and alpha-pinene as sole carbon and energy sources...|$|E
40|$|The {{essential}} oils of Curcuma tonga L. (Zingiberaceae) were isolated from its rhizomes and leaves by hydrodistillation. The oils {{were analyzed by}} high resolution GC and GC/MS. The rhizome oils contained more than 40 constituents, of which the major ones were ot-turmerone (30 - 32 %), ar-turmerone (17 - 26 %) and beta-turmerone (15 - 18 %). The leaf oil contained about 60 compounds and the main constituents were <b>alpha-phellandrene</b> (18. 2 %), 1, 8 -cineole 04. 6 %) and p-cymene (13. 3 %) ...|$|E
40|$|The elution {{profiles}} of several essential oils of the Myrtaceae family were acquired using a single enantioselective stationary phase column. These chromatograms {{were compared with}} those obtained by using a two-column coupled system, which comprised a low-polarity stationary phase column connected to the terminal end of the enantioselective column. The enantiomeric distributions of beta-pinene, sabinene, <b>alpha-phellandrene,</b> limonene, trans- and cis-sabinene hydrate, linalool, terpinen- 4 -ol and alpha-terpineol were determined. The use of a two-column coupled system is demonstrated to be useful for improving the resolution of target (chiral) compounds from otherwise interfering matrix components.

40|$|The {{effects of}} the auxin indole- 3 -acetic acid at 0. 44 µmol L- 1 and the cytokinins thidiazuron at 0. 44 µmol L- 1 and benzyladenine at 0. 44 and 4. 4 µmol L- 1 on growth, {{development}} and volatile compounds production of Lantana camara L. in vitro plants were investigated. The volatiles were extracted by solid phase microextraction (SPME) and the quantification was performed using GC-MS. A higher content of myrcene, <b>alpha-phellandrene,</b> alpha-copaene, trans-caryophyllene and beta-gurjunene, and {{the lower levels of}} alpha-pinene and beta-pinene were observed in in vitro plants cultivated on different supplementation media than in donor plants...|$|E
40|$|A {{site-specific}} Structure-Activity Relationship for {{the addition}} of OH to (poly) alkenes was developed earlier and validated for non-cyclic (poly) alkenes {{with respect to the}} total rate constants k(OH) and the detailed product distributions. Also for reactions of cyclic (poly) alkenes with OH, the SAR-predicted rate constant is in general within 15 % of the experimental value, except for a few (bi) cyclic biogenic compounds; for both <b>alpha-phellandrene</b> and alpha-terpinene, k(lit) approximate to 1. 7 x k(pred). For these two terpenes and for the structurally similar 1, 3 -cyclohexadiene we have measured the rate constants relative to the isoprene+OH reaction: k(alpha-terpinene+OH) = (3. 4 +/- 0. 4) x 10 (- 10) cm(3) molec. (- 1) s(- 1) : k(alpha-phellandrene+OH) = (3. 3 +/- 0. 4) x 10 (- 10) cm(3) molec. (- 1) s(- 1) : and k(1, 3 cyclohexadiene+OH) = (1. 5 +/- 0. 2) x 10 (- 10) cm(3) molec. (- 1) s(- 1). The discrepancy between the SAR-predictions for OH-addition and the experimental k-values for the first two compounds -given their specific structure suggests an important H-abstraction channel in their reactions with OH. We determined the importance of the H-abstraction path by directly measuring the amount of H 2 O formed in the reaction with OH in Discharge-Flow/Molecular Beam Mass Spectrometry experiments. Thus, an H-abstraction contribution of 30 +/- 7 % was found for alpha-terpinene and 27 +/- 10 % for <b>alpha-phellandrene,</b> which explains most of the deviation of the total k(OH) with respect to the SAR-prediction for OH-addition. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The {{essential}} oils of Ridolfia segetum (L.) Moris and Oenanthe crocata L. (Apiaceae), collected in Sardinia (Italy), have been assayed for two enzyme-associated {{activities of the}} HIV- 1 reverse transcriptase (RT) : RNA-dependent DNA polymerase (RDDP) activity and ribonuclease H (RNase H) activity. In biochemical assays, the {{essential oils}} inhibited HIV- 1 RT RDDP activity in a dose-dependent manner, while they were inactive towards RNase H activity. Furthermore, the oils were cytotoxic towards K 562 cell replication. GCMS analysis of the essential oils obtained by steam distillation of the aerial parts showed that {{the main components of}} R. segetum were <b>alpha-phellandrene,</b> alpha-terpinolene, beta-phellandrene, and dillapiol and those of O. crocata were sabinene, trans-beta-ocimene, cis-beta-ocimene, and beta-pinene...|$|E
40|$|In this study, {{accelerated}} {{solid phase}} dynamic extraction (ASPDE) technique {{was used to}} identify biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) emitted from Norway spruce (Picea abies). Compounds that were determined in tree samples are: tricycylene, alpha-pinene, camphene, beta-pinene, myrcene, 3 -carene, p-cymene, limonene, cineole, <b>alpha-phellandrene,</b> alpha-terpinene, gamma-terpinene and terpinolene. ASPDE showed a potential {{for the analysis of}} environmental samples as well as for field applications. This technique was further studied by using a gaseous mixture of BVOCs (sabinene, alpha-pinene, beta-pinene, limonene, linalool, and (Z) -hexenyl acetate) and exhibited a good repeatability during all the experiments in the range of 2. 5 % (alpha-pinene) and 14. 6 % (linalool). However, during the analysis of samples it was observed that desorption at high temperature (230 degrees C) can lead to the formation of artifacts, which were not observed at the desorption temperature of 100 degrees C. Further experimental investigations revealed that monoterpenes appeared as unanticipated compounds during desorption of ASPDE samples; these compounds were degradation products of linalool...|$|E
40|$|The {{chemical}} {{composition of the}} essential oil obtained by steam distillation of the floral calyces of Ocotea bofo Kunth (Lauraceae) was studied by means of GC, GC-MS, and 1 H, 13 C, and bidimensional NMR (COSY, HSQC, HMBC). Twenty-five constituents were identified, and estragole (48. 7 %), <b>alpha-phellandrene</b> (19. 6 %) and sabinene (10. 4 %) {{were found to be}} the major components. Antimicrobial activity against six aerobic bacteria and five yeasts and antioxidant activity performed by photochemiluminescence (PCL), 1, 1 -diphenyl- 2 -picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), and beta-carotene bleaching assays are reported. The oil showed fair inhibiting properties against bacteria and a good inhibition against most yeasts. Its radical scavenging and chain-breaking antioxidant properties were comparable to or better than those provided by synthetic controls. Particular emphasis has been given to the use of NMR as a fast and reliable tool to discriminate O. bofo essential oil from other commercial anetholeand estragole-rich oils, namely, Illicium verum, Foeniculum vulgare, and Artemisia dracunculus...|$|E
40|$|The {{essential}} oil of lavender (Lavandula angustifolia) is mainly composed of mono- and sesquiterpenes. Using a homology-based PCR strategy, two monoterpene synthases (LaLIMS and LaLINS) and one sesquiterpene synthase (LaBERS) were cloned from lavender leaves and flowers. LaLIMS catalyzed {{the formation of}} (R) -(+) -limonene, terpinolene, (1 R, 5 S) -(+) -camphene, (1 R, 5 R) -(+) -alpha-pinene, beta-myrcene and traces of <b>alpha-phellandrene.</b> The proportions of these products changed significantly when Mn(2 +) was supplied as the cofactor instead of Mg(2 +). The second enzyme LaLINS produced exclusively (R) -(-) -linalool, {{the main component of}} lavender {{essential oil}}. LaBERS transformed farnesyl diphosphate and represents the first reported trans-alpha-bergamotene synthase. It accepted geranyl diphosphate with higher affinity than farnesyl diphosphate and also produced monoterpenes, albeit at low rates. LaBERS is probably derived from a parental monoterpene synthase by the loss of the plastidial signal peptide and by broadening its substrate acceptance spectrum. The identification and description of the first terpene synthases from L. angustifolia forms the basis for the biotechnological modification of essential oil composition in lavender...|$|E
40|$|Under {{attack by}} insect pests, many plant species change their {{volatile}} chemical emissions to attract natural enemies. Most of the tomato (Lycopersicon sp., Solanaceae) varieties {{are subjected to}} infestation by molluscs and insects, including the generalist aphid Myzus persicae Sulzer (Homoptera, Aphididae). Episyrphus balteatus De Geer (Diptera: Syrphidae) is a generalist aphid predator that was here observed to lay eggs on M. persicae infested tomato but not on non-infested plants. In order to identify the volatile chemicals that guide the foraging and oviposition behaviour of E. balteatus, we collected and identified volatiles released in the headspace of both aphid infested and uninfested tomato plants by SPME-GC-MS. The identified chemicals were subsequently tested by electroantennography (EAG) on E. balteatus. Monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes were identified, the main volatile chemicals being beta-phellandrene, 2 -carene, <b>alpha-phellandrene,</b> 3 -carene and o-pinene. Electrical depolarizations were observed for each tested monoterpene, with optimal responses ranging from - 0. 2 to - 0. 8 mV. Episyrphus balteatus antennae showed dose-response relationships towards all the active chemicals. (E) -beta-farnesene, {{the main component of}} the aphid alarm pheromone, was the only active sesquiterpene, and is presumed to act as an oviposition stimulus for E. balteotus. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Early {{olfactory}} {{experience with}} a specific odorant enhances the subsequent response of the glomerular layer of the rat olfactory bulb to that same odorant. Because different odorants activate different glomerular layer regions, it seemed plausible that {{experience with a}} large number of odorants might result in enhanced glomerular activation during subsequent exposure to both the previously experienced odorants and the novel odorants evoking activity in regions that overlapped with those previously stimulated by different odorants. To this end, 7 odorants were selected using our glomerular response data archive that together stimulated much of the glomerular layer (<b>alpha-phellandrene,</b> benzaldehyde, L-carvone, decanal, pentanol, santalol, and valeric acid). Young rats were exposed to a different odorant each day for 7 days, and this cycle was repeated 3 times from postnatal days 1 – 21. The [14 C] 2 -deoxyglucose technique was used to measure neural activity in response to both previously experienced and novel odorants. The 2 novel odorants (alpha-ionone and L-menthone) activate regions of the glomerular layer that overlap with those stimulated by the 7 enrichment odorants. Our results indicate that early experience with multiple odorants results in increased responsiveness both to previously experienced odorants and to novel odorants that stimulate previously activated regions of the bulb...|$|E
40|$|The {{literature}} {{shows that}} the monoterpenes are great candidates {{for the development of}} new drugs for the treatment of various pathological processes, including painful conditions. The gamma terpinene (γ-TPN) is a monoterpene present in plant species that have multiple pharmacological properties and has structural similarity to antinociceptive monoterpenes, such as limonene and <b>alpha-phellandrene.</b> The γ-TPN molecular mass was evaluated by mass spectrometry and showed a pseudomolecular ion with m/z 137. 0 [*]Da. The animals did not present any signs of acute toxicity at 2 [*]g/kg, p. o. γ-TPN (1. 562 to 50 [*]mg/kg, p. o.) showed an antinociceptive effect in the formalin, capsaicin, and glutamate tests. γ-TPN has antinociceptive action when administered by others routes in glutamate test. To eliminate a possible sedative effect of γ-TPN, the open field and rota-rod test were conducted and the γ-TPN did not show muscle relaxant activity or central depressant effect. To investigate the mechanisms of action, the animals were pretreated with naloxone, glibenclamide, atropine, mecamylamine, or L-arginine in the glutamate test. γ-TPN antinociception was inhibited in the presence of naloxone, glibenclamide, atropine, and mecamylamine. The results suggest that the γ-TPN (p. o.) produced antinociceptive effect in models of chemical nociception through the cholinergic and opioid systems involvement...|$|E
40|$|Dill (Anethum graveolens L.) is {{an annual}} {{containing}} relevant amounts (2 - 4 %) of essential oil, easily obtained through steam distillation {{of the whole}} aerial part or of the seeds alone. In Sicily, true dill is not present as wild plant; on the contrary, another Umbelliferae plant, Ridolfia segetum Moris., is largely widespread. The rather limited available literature is mostly devoted {{to the study of}} some botanical aspects or, at most, to chemical and analytical characterization of its leaves and flowers. Although at a deep examination the conformation of fruits is rather different between the two species, inside the inland Sicily the two genotypes, both referred to with the same dialectal denomination (anitu), are often misunderstood and popular tradition tributes to them the same medicinal and herbal uses. This work was carried out to give a further contribution to the differentiation of the two genotypes both from the morphological and productive point of view and in relation to the chemical and analytical composition of the fruits (seeds). Our work showed that Anethum generally has a lower number of umbrellas per plant than Ridolfia, even if bigger and bearing a higher number of seeds. Ridolfia showed a higher content of <b>alpha-phellandrene</b> (45 %) and a lower one of beta-phellandrene and limonene, reaching together 12. 9 %, vs 70 %, that in Anethum is represented by limonene onl...|$|E
40|$|The {{essential}} oils, {{obtained by}} hydrodistillation, from leaf samples of four Piper species (P. arboreum, P. crassinervium, P. dilatatum and P. tuberculatum), harvested at the State of Ceará, {{were analyzed by}} GC-MS. The oil yields ranged from 0. 03 to 0. 11 % (w/w), on fresh weight basis. The oils were characterized by mono- and sesquiterpenes, except the oil of P. arboreum to which only sesquiterpenes were identified. beta-Elemene (0. 58 - 3. 03 %), (E) -caryophyllene (2. 71 - 37. 78 %), germacrene D (3. 43 - 11. 81 %), bicyclogermacrene (2. 83 and 25. 07 %) and delta-cadinene (0. 52 - 2. 44 %) were detected in all oil samples. The major identified monoterpenes were alpha-pinene (11. 27 %), beta-pinene (20. 01 %), 1, 8 -cineole (10. 81 %) and linalool (28. 61 %) for P. crassinervium and, <b>alpha-phellandrene</b> (22. 53 %) and delta- 3 -carene (10. 20 %) for P. dilatatum.

40|$|The ultrafast {{dynamics}} of molecules in condensed phases {{is an area}} of research that has the possibility to inform the design of molecules for functional nano-devices as well as improve on understanding of biological processes. Presented in this thesis are experiments probing the excited and ground state {{dynamics of}} molecules based on the 1, 3 -cyclohexadiene (CHD) chromophore. The reversible photochemistry of these molecules is applicable to the study of photo-switching systems under consideration for molecular memory devices as well as the photobiological synthesis of Vitamin D 3. The full reaction mechanism for a number of CHD derivatives is deduced from ultrafast broadband transient absorption spectroscopy and supporting density functional calculations. 	Steric groups on the cyclohexadiene backbone can affect both the excited state properties as well as the dynamic approach to equilibrium for the hexatriene photoproducts following excitation of CHD. The photoreaction was characterized in multiple solvent environments with a range of viscosity, polarity, hydrogen-bonding capacity, and packing density. The conformational dynamics of the photoproducts depend on the substitution pattern and solvent. The <b>alpha-phellandrene</b> photoproduct relaxes to a fully trans form much like hexatriene, while alpha-terpinene and 7 -dehydrocholesterol photoproducts are limited to certain conformations by steric clashes. The solvent affects the relaxation timescales differently for each photoproduct, but all of the dynamics occur within 5 - 10 ps. 		The ring opening of DHC that occurs in the biological synthesis of Vitamin D 3 is also examined in a liposomal model for the cell membrane. In this anisotropic environment, the excited state dynamics are significantly lengthened to ~ 11 – 50 ps depending on the liposome properties. This suggests significant interaction between DHC and the lipids that affects the ring-opening reaction coordinate. The excited state and photoproduct conformational equilibrium is discussed and compared to that in bulk solution. Development of the experimental protocol for investigating chemical dynamics in this highly scattering medium represents the groundwork for many future impactful experiments. These are the first experiments that characterize the photochemistry of 7 -dehydrocholesterol in a system that models the in vivo environment...|$|E
