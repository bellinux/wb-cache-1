5|$|Once formed, {{proteins}} only {{exist for}} {{a certain period of}} time and are then degraded <b>and</b> <b>recycled</b> by the cell's machinery through the process of protein turnover. A protein's lifespan is measured in terms of its half-life and covers a wide range. They can exist for minutes or years with an average lifespan of 1–2 days in mammalian cells. Abnormal or misfolded proteins are degraded more rapidly either due to being targeted for destruction or due to being unstable.|$|E
5|$|The {{photosensitivity}} of {{the silver}} halides allowed for their use in traditional photography, although digital photography, which does not use silver, is now dominant. The photosensitive emulsion used in black-and-white photography is a suspension of silver halide crystals in gelatin, possibly mixed in with some noble metal compounds for improved photosensitivity, developing, and tuning. Colour photography requires the addition of special dye components and sensitisers, so that the initial black-and-white silver image couples with a different dye component. The original silver images are bleached off and the silver is then recovered <b>and</b> <b>recycled.</b> Silver nitrate is the starting material in all cases.|$|E
40|$|Most of the {{stakeholders}} {{involved in}} the construction industry, particularly from developing countries have less emphasis on environmental care primarily involves the reuse <b>and</b> <b>recycle</b> of building materials in their construction projects. Previous studies prove environmental aspects have been neglected by the major stakeholders of the construction industry compared with issues related to cost and time. This study focuses on identifying the current adoption level of reuse <b>and</b> <b>recycle</b> practice among Malaysian contractors, the factors that are required for the successful implementation of systematic reuse <b>and</b> <b>recycle</b> <b>and</b> to identify {{the relationship between the}} selected factors and systematic implementation of reuse <b>and</b> <b>recycle.</b> The questionnaires were distributed to class A contractors that registered with the Contractor Service Centre (PKK). Currently, most of the contractors are concerned about reuse <b>and</b> <b>recycle</b> of the construction materials...|$|R

5|$|Ecologists {{study and}} measure {{nutrient}} budgets {{to understand how}} these materials are regulated, flow, <b>and</b> <b>recycled</b> through the environment. This research {{has led to an}} understanding that there is global feedback between ecosystems and the physical parameters of this planet, including minerals, soil, pH, ions, water, and atmospheric gases. Six major elements (hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur, and phosphorus; H, C, N, O, S, and P) form the constitution of all biological macromolecules and feed into the Earth's geochemical processes. From the smallest scale of biology, the combined effect of billions upon billions of ecological processes amplify and ultimately regulate the biogeochemical cycles of the Earth. Understanding the relations and cycles mediated between these elements and their ecological pathways has significant bearing toward understanding global biogeochemistry.|$|E
5|$|Fly ash {{and bottom}} ash are two {{byproducts}} made through {{the burning of}} coal in power stations. Ash is normally dumped in the station's Ash Lagoons landfill site, which is located on site. Since 2006, ash produced at Lynemouth Power Station has been recycled and used as a sub-fill material {{in the construction industry}} and in the production of grout. In 2007, 63,000 tonnes of ash from the station, along with 100,000 tonnes of ash from the Ash Lagoons, was taken <b>and</b> <b>recycled.</b> In September 2007, Pulverised Fuel Ash was utilised as a filling material in the capping of Woodhorn Landfill, which had been used for the disposal of spent potlining from the smelter.|$|E
5|$|Further details, {{including}} {{the matter of}} Sinar Harapan share of stock and the publisher, were decided at a meeting at Wanandi's office in March 1983. The next month, on 25 April, the first edition— totalling eight pages— was published. The first newsroom of the new paper were located in Kompas former laundry room, a one story warehouse; the first employees {{had to do the}} layout by hand, using pica poles as straight edges. During the first few months, the writers translated <b>and</b> <b>recycled</b> previously published stories from Indonesian media, which were later picked up by foreign wire services. Original reporting was rare as the editors at first did not want to deal with the censorship of Suharto's New Order government.|$|E

5|$|The Swedish {{automotive}} startup Uniti Sweden AB {{has been}} working on an electric city car entirely designed to be sustainable. The CEO Lewis Horne said “When people sell electric cars, the motivation is sustainability. So, why are they so heavy, and why are they the same cars? Where you just take out petrol and you put in the huge battery and you call it sustainable. But it’s not.”. The company has been designing a car that uses sustainable <b>and</b> <b>recycled</b> material such as bio-composite to reduce the footprint of the car during production. In addition, the fully automated factory provided in partnership with Siemens will be able to work with the lights turned off during 22h per day to save energy.|$|E

McElderry is clothed by a grey vest and a grey shirt, as {{he stands in the}} setting and performs. Throughout the entire video, scenes alternate between the flooded cityscape setting <b>and</b> <b>recycled</b> footage from The X Factor, which are in black and white until it shows him in the live shows in colour. The video concludes with McElderry being informed he won the competition, hugging his peers.|$|E
5|$|The {{release of}} Ultime grida dalla savana {{initiated}} a rivalry between Climati and Morra {{and two other}} Italian Mondo film makers, Angelo and Alfredo Castiglioni. These two filmmaking teams became the frontrunners of the Mondo genre {{in the late seventies}} and early eighties. The Castiglionis had made two previous Mondo films, Africa segreta and Africa ama, before the release of Ultime grida dalla savana. They later released three additional films: Magia nuda in 1975, Addio ultimo uomo in 1978, Africa dolce e selvaggio in 1982. Climati and Morra made two follow-up films to Ultime grida dalla savana. The first followup, Savana violenta, also known as Savage Man Savage Beast no. 2, was released in 1976. Savana violenta was slightly less graphic in its depiction of violence. The last film, Dolce e selvaggio, was released in 1983 and consisted partly of outtakes <b>and</b> <b>recycled</b> footage from Climati and Morra's two previous films. Each subsequent release by the two parties would attempt to outperform the previous films with more explicit and shocking content.|$|E
