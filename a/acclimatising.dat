5|$|Following its losses, the 66th Division {{was reduced}} to cadre early in May; which meant that {{infantry}} battalions were cut to ten officers and about 45 men, the surplus being sent to base depots; the artillery, engineer and machine-gun units were distributed among other formations. The divisional artillery was attached to XIX Corps during the Battle of the Avre on 4 April and with XI Corps at the Battle of the Lys later in the month. During the summer, Bethell continued planning for the rebuilding of the division, having recruited a staff he felt he could work with, expecting that experienced men would become available as drafts returned from the Mediterranean. Overseas divisions there had suffered fewer casualties and the reduction from four to three battalions per brigade meant {{that large numbers of}} men would be returning. While reinforcements were assembled, the divisional cadres of the 66th Division and the 39th Division were used to train five American divisions in the British zone. The training process was complicated by a rigid schedule laid down by the American high command, who strongly objected to any deviation from their plans. In July, the American divisions moved up to the front and British troops began to arrive from Salonika and Palestine, though the assembly of the division was delayed by the returning men being given home leave and having to spend time <b>acclimatising.</b>|$|E

25|$|At altitude, {{atmospheric}} pressure {{is lower than}} at sea level, so surfacing {{at the end of}} an altitude dive leads to a greater relative reduction in pressure and an increased risk of decompression sickness compared to the same dive profile at sea level. The dives are also typically carried out in freshwater at altitude so it has a lower density than seawater used for calculation of decompression tables. The amount of time the diver has spent <b>acclimatising</b> at altitude is also of concern as divers with gas loadings near those of sea level may also be at an increased risk. The US Navy recommends waiting 12 hours following arrival at altitude before performing the first dive. The tissue supersaturation following an ascent to altitude can also be accounted for by considering it to be residual nitrogen and allocating a residual nitrogen group when using tables with this facility.|$|E
40|$|The {{long-term}} treatment of soil with winery wastewater (WWW) {{leads to an}} <b>acclimatised</b> soil microbial population. The <b>acclimatised</b> soil displays greater biological activity when exposed to further irrigation with winery wastewater. In this study, soil which had been <b>acclimatised</b> to winery wastewater for about 30 years was compared to the same soil, which had not received the same water. Furthermore, many medium to large wineries have their own water treatment plants. The ability to reuse winery wastewater, treated or untreated, requires a fundamental understanding of the potential toxicity of the water {{at different times of}} the year, coupled with the effects of the water on soils and plants. Two matched sites on the same soils were both treated with WWW (treated and untreated) and the microbial activity in the soils was monitored over two weeks, by measuring CO 2 efflux and a range of other soil parameters. It was found that the <b>acclimatised</b> soil displayed greater microbial activity, particularly with the untreated winery wastewater. Soil ammonium levels showed overlapping effects, however, elevated ammonium levels peaking after 6 days were associated with the <b>acclimatised</b> soil.

2500|$|This set {{the stage}} for the final round in Japan. Hunt's late season charge pulled him to just three points behind Lauda. The sliding scale of points for the top six {{finishers}} meant that Hunt needed to finish third (4-points) or better to overtake Lauda coupled with Lauda earning too few points to stay ahead. McLaren team manager Alastair Caldwell had taken advantage of the gap between the final two races to hire the Fuji circuit - a track hosting its first Grand Prix and therefore unknown to all the teams - for an exclusive McLaren test. After a few laps the gearbox seized, bringing the test to a premature close, but the team had had the advantage of <b>acclimatising</b> themselves to the new circuit. Conditions for the race itself were torrentially wet. Lauda retired early on in the race, unable to blink because of facial burns from his accident in Germany. After leading most of the race Hunt suffered a puncture, then had a delayed pitstop and finally received mixed pit signals from his team. But he managed to finish in third place, scoring four points, enough for him to win the World Championship by one point. gives Hunt title."] Ottawa Citizen, 26 October 1976, p. 19. Hunt was the last British Formula One champion until Nigel Mansell won the 1992 championship for Williams.

60|$|Fever.--The {{number of}} {{travellers}} that have fallen victims to fever in certain lands is terrible: it {{is a matter}} of serious consideration whether any motives, short of imperious duty, justify a person in braving a fever-stricken country. In the ill-fated Niger expedition, three vessels were employed, of which the 'Albert' stayed the longest time in the river, namely two months and two days. Her English crew consisted of 62 men; of these, 55 caught fever in the river, and 23 died. Of the remaining seven, only two ultimately escaped scot-free; the others suffering, more or less severely, on their return to England. In Dr. McWilliams's Medical History of this expedition, it is laid down that the Niger fever, which may be considered as a type of pestilential fever generally, usually sets in sixteen days after exposure to the malaria; and that one attack, instead of <b>acclimatising</b> the patient, seems to render him all the more liable to a second. Every conceivable precaution known in those days, had been taken to ensure the health of the crew of the 'Albert.' A great discovery of modern days is the power of quinine to keep off many types of fever. A person would, now, have little to fear in taking a passage in a Niger steamer; supposing that vessels ran regularly up that river. The quinine he would take, beginning at the coast, would render him proof against fever, until he had passed the delta; but nothing would remove the risk of a long sojourn in the delta itself. However, I should add that Dr. Livingstone's experience on the zambesi throws doubt on the power of quinine to keep off the type of fever that prevails upon that river.|$|E

40|$|An {{activated}} sludge pilot plant {{was used to}} <b>acclimatise</b> sludge to a low dose of H 2 S gas.

Sludge that had been <b>acclimatised</b> to 5 ml l- 1 H 2 S in the air supply removed 70 % of a 50 ml l- 1 load in a batch reactor after three sludge ages of acclimatsation. Pre-exposure to low H 2 S concentrations enabled the bacterial community to maintain a sufficient sulphide-degrading population to retain acclimatisation and degrade subsequent high loads which are toxic to unacclimatised sludge. Acclimatisation to H 2 S is therefore mainly an effect of selection pressure on the mixed bacterial population, which suggests that the H 2 S removal capacity of different types of {{activated sludge}} will converge after acclimatisation, irrespective of their initial degradative abilitie...|$|R
