500|$|Hartman wrote {{a number}} of {{screenplay}}s that were never produced. In 1986 he began writing a screenplay for a film titled Mr. Fix-It, and completed the final draft in 1991. Robert Zemeckis was signed to produce the film, with Gil Bettman hired to direct. Hartman called it [...] "a sort of a merger of horror and comedy, like Beetlejuice and Throw Momma From the Train", adding, [...] "It's an American nightmare <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>family</b> torn asunder. They live next to a toxic dump site, their water supply is poisoned, the mother and son go insane and try to murder each other, the father's face is torn off in a terrible disfiguring accident in the first act.
