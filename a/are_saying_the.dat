2500|$|Referring to the perception, {{especially}} in the West, that India had previously been lecturing the world about the virtues of nonviolence, President Kennedy told the Indian ambassador to the US, [...] "You spend {{the last fifteen years}} preaching morality to us, and then you go ahead and act the way any normal country would behave… People <b>are</b> <b>saying,</b> <b>the</b> preacher has been caught coming out of the brothel." ...|$|E
2500|$|Introit. This {{text of the}} Mass varies daily. It usually {{consists}} of Scriptural or religious text, followed by a Psalm verse, followed by the Doxology. Then the Scriptural or religious text is repeated. This is usually being sung while the sacred ministers <b>are</b> <b>saying</b> <b>the</b> Prayers at the Foot of the Altar mentioned above and while they incense the altar. After Prayers at the Foot of the Altar, the sacred ministers ascend {{the steps to the}} altar, the thurifer brings his thurible, or censer, and a 'boat' of incense. The celebrant places incense into the thurible, blesses it and then proceeds to cense the altar, accompanied by the other ministers. After he is finished, he hands the thurible to the deacon and the deacon censes him. The thurible is then given back to the thurifer, who departs to the sacristy until he is needed again. The sacred ministers then form a [...] "semicircle" [...] (really a line) on the altar steps—the celebrant on the top platform (called a footpace), the deacon on a middle step, and the sub-deacon on the bottom step. The Master of Ceremonies then helps the celebrant find his place in the Missal. The priest makes {{the sign of the cross}} and recites in a low voice to himself the Introit that the choir has already sung. All bow with him when he recites the Doxology. Meanwhile, the choir, after completing the Introit, begins to sing the Kyrie Eleison.|$|E

60|$|You {{recollect}} to {{what the}} text refers? How the Lord visited His people? By raising to life a widow's son at Nain. That {{was the result of}} our Lord's visit to the little town of Nain. It is worth our while to think of that text, and of that word, 'visit,' just now. For we are praying to God to remove the cholera from this land. We are calling it a visitation of God; and saying that God is visiting our sins on us thereby. And we <b>are</b> <b>saying</b> <b>the</b> exact truth. We are using the right and scriptural word.|$|E
6000|$|The {{next day}} when they called upon the doctor he said, [...] "If you can bring {{yourself}} to part with the child, I have, I think, found the very thing to suit her. In the first place you must {{know that there is}} in the town an establishment, conducted by a Professor Menzel, for the instruction of deaf mutes. It is quite a new system, and consists in teaching them to read from the lips of persons speaking to them the words that they <b>are</b> <b>saying.</b> <b>The</b> system is by no means difficult for those who have still, like your daughter, the power of speech, and who have lost only their hearing. But even those born deaf and dumb have learned to be able to converse to a certain degree, though their voices are never quite natural, for in nine cases out of ten deaf mutes are mutes only because they have never learned to use their tongue. However, happily that is beside the question in your daughter's case. I hope that she will regain her hearing; but should this unfortunately not be the case, it will at least be a great mitigation to her position {{to be able to read}} from the lips of those who address her what is said, and therefore to converse like an ordinary person. I can assure you that many of Herr Menzel's pupils can converse so easily and rapidly that no one would have the least idea of the misfortune from which they suffer, as in fact they feel no inconvenience beyond the fact that they are not aware of being addressed by anyone standing behind them, or whose face they do not happen to be watching." ...|$|E
6000|$|I do {{not know}} whether he spoke the truth; I am {{inclined}} to think that he did; but now I know what [...] "Batavian grace" [...] really means, I don't approve of it. A lady in a dressing-gown disturbs the mind and prevents careful consideration of the political outlook in Singapur, which is now supplied with a set of very complete forts, and is hopefully awaiting some nine-inch breach-loaders that are to adorn them. There is something very pathetic in the trustful, clinging attitude of the Colonies, who ought to have been soured and mistrustful long ago. [...] "We hope the Home Government may do this. It is possible that the Home Government may do that," [...] is the burden of the song, and in every place where the Englishman cannot breed successfully must continue to be. Imagine an India fit for permanent habitation by our kin, and consider what a place it would be this day, with the painter cut fifty years ago, fifty thousand miles of railways laid down and ten thousand under survey, and possibly an annual surplus. Is this sedition? Forgive me, but I am looking at the shipping outside the verandah, at the Chinamen in the streets, and at the lazy, languid Englishmen in banians and white jackets stretched on the cane chairs, and these things are not nice. The men are not really lazy, as I will try to show later on, but they lounge and loaf and seem to go to office at eleven, which must be bad for work. And they all talk about going home at indecently short intervals, as though that were their right. Once more, if we could only rear children that did not run to leg and nose in the second generation {{in this part of the}} world and one or two others, what an amazing disruption of the Empire there would be before half of a Parnell Commission sitting was accomplished! And then, later, when the freed States had plunged into hot water, fought their fights, overborrowed, overspeculated, and otherwise conducted themselves like younger sons, what a coming together and revision of tariffs, ending in one great iron band girdling the earth. Within that limit free trade. Without, rancorous Protection. It would be too vast a hornet's nest for any combination of Powers to disturb. The dream will not come about for a long time, but we shall accomplish something like it one of these days. The birds of passage from Canada, from Borneo,--Borneo that will have to go through a general rough-and-tumble before she grips her possibilities,--from Australia, from a hundred scattered islands, <b>are</b> <b>saying</b> <b>the</b> same thing: [...] "We are not strong enough yet, but some day We shall be." ...|$|E

6000|$|SPOORWEG.--Vast green flats, {{speckled}} by spotted cows, {{and bound}} by a gray frontier of windmills; shining canals stretching through the green; odors like those exhaled from the Thames in the dog-days, and a fine pervading smell of cheese; little trim houses, with tall roofs, and great windows of many panes; gazebos, or summer-houses, hanging over pea-green canals; kind-looking, dumpling-faced farmers' women, with laced caps and golden frontlets and earrings; about the houses and towns which we pass a great air of comfort and neatness; a queer feeling of wonder that you can't understand what your fellow-passengers <b>are</b> <b>saying,</b> <b>the</b> tone of whose voices, and a certain comfortable dowdiness of dress, are so like our own;--whilst we are remarking on these sights, sounds, smells, the little railway journey from Rotterdam to the Hague comes to an end. I speak to the railway porters and hackney coachmen in English, and they reply in their own language, and it seems somehow as if we understood each other perfectly. The carriage drives to the handsome, comfortable, cheerful hotel. We sit down a score at the table; and there is one foreigner and his wife,--I mean every other man and woman at dinner are English. As we {{are close to the}} sea, {{and in the midst of}} endless canals, we have no fish. We are reminded of dear England by the noble prices which we pay for wines. I confess I lost my temper yesterday at Rotterdam, where I had to pay a florin for a bottle of ale (the water not being drinkable, and country or Bavarian beer not being genteel enough for the hotel);--I confess, I say, that my fine temper was ruffled, when the bottle of pale ale turned out to be a pint bottle; and I meekly told the waiter that I had bought beer at Jerusalem at a less price. But then Rotterdam is eighteen hours from London, and the steamer with the passengers and beer comes up to the hotel windows; whilst to Jerusalem they have to carry the ale on camels' backs from Beyrout or Jaffa, and through hordes of marauding Arabs, who evidently don't care for pale ale, though I am told it is not forbidden in the Koran. Mine would have been very good, but I choked with rage whilst drinking it. A florin for a bottle, and that bottle having the words [...] "imperial pint," [...] in bold relief, on the surface! It was too much. I intended not to say anything about it; but I MUST speak. A florin a bottle, and that bottle a pint! Oh, for shame! for shame! I can't cork down my indignation; I froth up with fury; I am pale with wrath, and bitter with scorn.|$|E
6000|$|And if we {{lose sight}} of it as we {{grow up to be}} men and women, it is not because heaven goes farther off, but because we grow less heavenly. Even now, so close is heaven to us, that any one of us might enter into heaven this moment, without {{stirring}} from his seat. One real cry from the depths of your heart--"Father, forgive thy sinful child!"--one real feeling of your own worthlessness, and weakness, and emptiness, and of God's righteousness, and love, and mercy, ready for you--and you are in heaven there and then, as near the feet of the blessed Lord Jesus, as Mary Magdalen was, when she tried to clasp them in the garden. I am serious, my friends; I am not given to talk fine figures of poetry; I am talking sober, straightforward, literal truth. And the Lord sits at God's right hand too? you believe that? Then how far off is God?--for as far off as God is, so far off is the Lord Jesus, and no farther. What says St. Paul? That [...] "God is not far off from any one of us--for in Him we live, and move, and have our being" [...] . IN Him [...] . How far off is that? And is not God everywhere, if indeed we can say that He is any where? Then the Lord Jesus, who is at God's right hand, is everywhere also--here, now, with us this day. One would have thought that {{there was no need to}} prove that by argument, considering that His own blessed lips told us: [...] "Lo, I am with you, even to the end of the world;" [...] and again: [...] "Wheresoever two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them." [...] And this is the Lord whom people fancy is gone away far above the stars, till the end of time! Oh, my friends, rather bow your heads before Him here this moment. For here He is among us now, listening to every thought of our poor sinful hearts. [...] . He is where God is--God IN whom we live, and move, and have our being--and that is everywhere. Do you wish Him to be any nearer, my friends? Or do you--do you--take care what your hearts answer, for He is watching them--do you in the depth of your hearts wish that He were a little farther off? Does the notion of His being here on this earth, watching and interfering (as we call it nowadays in our atheism) with us and everything, seem unpleasant and burdensome? Is it more comfortable to you to think that He is away far up beyond the stars? Do you feel the lighter and freer for fancying that He will not visit the earth for many a year to come? In short, is it in your HEARTS that you <b>are</b> <b>saying,</b> <b>The</b> Lord delays His coming? ...|$|E
