25|$|MGM {{had bought}} the film rights to Clare Boothe Luce's 1936 smash Broadway hit The Women in 1937. Many writers had, unsuccessfully, taken a stab at a {{screenplay}} version. The studio handed it to Loos and veteran scriptwriter Jane Murfin, and three weeks later Loos handed Cukor a script that he loved. Unfortunately the censorship board did not. They insisted on changing more than 80 lines, and the film {{had to go into}} production. Loos was apprehensive, but Cukor insisted she do the changes on set, among his all-star bevy of leading ladies. Loos made immediate friends with Paulette Goddard, who was surprisingly well-read. She also had Aldous and Maria Huxley as houseguests, and encouraged Huxley to stay in California and continue to write there. When World War II began in September 1939, Loos convinced Huxley that it would be safer for his family if they stayed in the United States rather than returning to England, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>got</b> him a job adapting screenplays at MGM.|$|E

Although Crane and Kauffman did not want LeBlanc for the role at the time, they were told by the network to cast him.

She felt that Sarah had to often clung on to people and believing that {{ultimately}} it would make her happy. Sarah tries this notion with Zoe, describing this Batley added: [...] "I think that's what happened with Zoe as well because they were such good friends. With Lydia, she brought something to her <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>got</b> on with her and was sparky, which is something that Sarah liked. I don't know if she'd suddenly turned, though.

Michelle Zoromski of IGN argued however that while Spears' {{appearance was}} a [...] "nice change of pace from her latest public appearances", it was nonetheless a [...] "bit clunky and not as seamless as other guest roles have been on the show". Donna Bowman of The A.V. Club was also less enthusiastic about the singer's performance. Bowman opined: [...] "The Big Britney Episode, as it will henceforth be known, wasn't really much to get all huffy over. You can say this for the [...] team: They tend to minimize the annoyance factor of their special guest stars. Britney was a sideshow, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>got</b> her couple of laughs, but she didn't hog the screen time." ...|$|E

Nunn called Rihanna a [...] "crazy bitch" [...] and claimed to know her, unlike Anderson. After the episode aired, Brown reportedly stated {{that he did not know}} who Nunn was. Nunn questioned this during the reunion show, claiming that Brown had said it because the cast of the show had not yet been revealed. Perez Hilton, the host of the reunion, asked Nunn if Rihanna had confronted her about her comments. Nunn answered yes, stating that the two had argued during a dinner party in New York City. During the reunion, Nunn claimed to have had a [...] "fling" [...] with Brown before the show.
