50|$|Several {{countries}} in ITU Region 1 have <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>frequencies</b> in the 70 MHz region, called the 4 meters band. The band shares many propagation characteristics with 6 meters.

5000|$|Citizens Band {{radio is}} a family of {{services}} available in different countries and with different operating rules, generally using channels in the 27 MHz part of the radio spectrum. 26-27 MHz occupies the [...] "boundary area" [...] between HF (3-30 MHz) and VHF (30-300 MHz). This means that CB signals provide local coverage similar to low-band VHF during times of low sunspot activity. However, during {{the peak of the}} sunspot cycle, CB frequencies exhibit skywave propagation just like the lower parts of HF do, making communication hundreds or even thousands of miles (km) away possible. While some operators seek out long distance [...] "DX" [...] contacts on CB frequencies and on frequencies above channel 40 and below channel 1 (a practice referred to as [...] "freebanding" [...] or [...] "outbanding"), interference from distant stations will often make local communication extremely difficult or impossible during band openings. CB was, and still is, designed for short-distance (local) communications needs. US FCC law prohibits communicating with any station more than 250 km (155.3 miles) on CB frequencies. Like many rules regarding the HF CB services, the distance prohibition is largely ignored and unenforced. Often as a result of channel overcrowding and interference, many HF CB users have turned to purchasing [...] "export" [...] or [...] "10-meter" [...] radios that operate in the legal CB band but also provide <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>frequencies</b> above and below the CB band. Other CB users purchase amplifiers to increase their output power and [...] "punch through" [...] interference caused by distant stations (or by local stations running amplifiers). This has created a tragedy of the commons situation in and near the HF CB spectrum (25-28 MHz). As more users purchase amplifiers and operate on out-of-band frequencies, more interference is produced, forcing others to acquire even more powerful equipment to punch through even more interference, and/or to acquire transceivers capable of accessing more frequencies so that a clear frequency may be found. Many CB users have moved to other personal radio services to avoid these issues.|$|E

40|$|We {{report a}} direct {{measurement}} of the low-frequency noise spectrum in a superconducting flux qubit. Our method uses the noise sensitivity of a free-induction Ramsey interference experiment, comprising free evolution {{in the presence of}} noise for a fixed period of time followed by single-shot qubit-state measurement. Repeating this procedure enables Fourier-transform noise spectroscopy with <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>frequencies</b> up to the achievable repetition rate, a regime relevant to dephasing in ensemble-averaged time-domain measurements such as Ramsey interferometry. Rotating the qubit's quantization axis allows us to measure two types of noise: effective flux noise and effective critical-current or charge noise. For both noise sources, we observe that the very same 1 /f-type power laws measured at considerably higher frequencies (0. 2 - 20 MHz) are consistent with the noise in the 0. 01 - 100 -Hz range measured here. We find no evidence of temperature dependence of the noises over 65 - 200 mK, and also no evidence of time-domain correlations between the two noises. These methods and results are pertinent to the dephasing of all superconducting qubits. © 2012 American Physical Society...|$|E

A comparison of the infrared spectrum of the clusters on a deuterium-passivated Si(100) surface at 130 K with an infrared spectrum of the clusters in a carbon tetrachloride solution reveals that the clusters are only weakly physisorbed on the D/Si(100) surface and also provides evidence for the purity of the cluster source. We also present infrared spectra of clusters directly chemisorbed on a clean Si(100) surface and show evidence that the clusters are adsorbed on the Si(100) via attachment by one vertex. A complete assignment of the observed vibrational features, for both physisorbed and chemisorbed clusters, has been made based upon comparisons with the results obtained in ab initio calculations using gradient-corrected density functional methods. © 1998 American Institute of Physics...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Cognitive radio {{technology}} proposes the utilisation of under-utilised spectrum resources which may include time, frequency, geographical location, direction, polarisation et cetera. Frequency is the conventional spectrum resource, {{considered to be}} exploited for cognitive radio, especially {{in the field of}} antenna design. We address the unconventional directional resource for cognitive radio, from antenna design perspective. The design concept of a multi-band compact array, capable of providing separate and simultaneous <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>frequency</b> and directional resources, is presented. The initial explorations are carried out for three frequency resources (bands) and three directional resources, providing nine degrees-of-freedom altogether. Laboratory version of the proposed antenna system is then used to gain proof-of-principle through line-of-sight measurements in an over-the-air test-bed, followed by static outdoor measurements in a multipath scenario. At the end, simulations are performed for arbitrary arrays in heterogeneous propagation scenarios to study the influence of antenna radiation pattern on the availability of directional opportunity. Recommendations are made for possible antenna design based on the simulation results. 1...|$|R

40|$|Self-organization of {{frequencies}} is {{studied by}} using model neurons called VCONs (voltage-controlled oscillator neuron models). These models give direct <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>frequency</b> information, {{in contrast to}} all-or-none neuron models, and they generate voltage spikes that phase-lock to oscillatory stimulation, similar to phase-locking of action potentials to oscillatory voltage stimulation observed in Hodgkin-Huxley preparations of squid axons. The rotation vector method is described and used to study how networks synchronize, even {{in the presence of}} noise or when damaged; the entropy of ratios of phases is used to construct an energy function that characterizes organized behavior. Computer simulations show that rotation numbers (output frequency/input frequency) describe both chaotic and nonchaotic behavior. Learning occurs when synaptic connections strengthen in response to stimulation that is synchronous with cell activity. It is shown that intermittent chaotic firing is suppressed and simple stable responses are enhanced by such learning in VCON networks.
