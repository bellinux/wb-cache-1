40|$|Porcelain {{is one of}} {{the ceramic}} materials. In this study, Claytan {{porcelain}} was used as a main raw material and added with sodium feldspar as flux. The scope of this project is mainly focused at the effect of sintering temperature and the different process of weight percentage sodium feldspar to Claytan porcelain. Slurry of Claytan porcelain mixed was prepared by <b>agitator</b> <b>mixer.</b> The sodium feldspar mixed with the Claytan porcelain according to the weight percentage of sodium feldspar to Claytan porcelain which is at 2 wt. %, 4 wt. %, 6 wt. %, 8 wt. % and 10 wt. %. Slip casting was used as the processing method. Sintering process was conducted at four different temperatures 800 °C, 900 °C, 1000 °C and 1100 °C and was fixed for 1 hour and heating and cooling rate were at 10 °C/minute. DTA/TG was used in order to establish the firing condition. Physical analyses were divided into three analyses which were linear shrinkage, porosity and bulk density of the samples. It was carried out according to the specific ASTM standard of testing. The mechanical behavior was evaluated in term of modulus of rupture and micro hardness. After viewing the results, it can be concluded that percentage of porosity significantly reduces from 30. 16 % to 22. 83 % when sintered at 800 °C and 1100 °C for sodium feldspar 10 wt. %. Claytan porcelain with sodium feldspar 2 wt. % at 1100 oC exhibited the highest strength of 17. 59 Mpa and micro hardness value 150. 40 Hv. The effect of firing temperature significantly improved the porosity and the quality of physical properties of Claytan porcelain. For physical and mechanical analyses, the results showed that the increasing of temperature and percentage of sodium feldspar had significantly increased the linear shrinkage, apparent porosity and bulk density...|$|E
40|$|Lecturepg. 83 Industrial <b>agitator</b> or <b>mixer</b> {{configurations}} {{and associated}} applications present the design engineer {{with a unique}} set of challenges. This was especially true when a major chemical company required an agitator for a large multistaged column. A traditional approach to mixer design, in this case, would attract high vessel and agitator cost {{due to the nature of}} the machine design and the associated mounting/operational loads. This paper reviews the design constraints and problems, along with the solutions developed to provide the end user with equipment that is easily maintainable, and had an attractive capital cost. In particular, it compares the design solutions with the traditional design approaches, and discusses how finite element modeling was used to verify operational limitation due to natural frequency constraints. The paper concentrates on the key component associated with the mixer shaft, and specifically excludes discussion relating to the design and feature requirements relative to gearbox selection...|$|R
