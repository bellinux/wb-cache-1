40|$|SUMMARY 24 -hour {{recordings}} of the ECG and respiration, the latter from an impedance technique, have shown a phenomenon which could account for hitherto unexplained failures of impedance <b>apnoea</b> <b>alarm</b> systems. Whenever apnoea is accompanied by bradycardia there is a pronounced increase in the amplitude of the cardiac impulse on the respiration carrier. This imitates the respiration signal and prevents the alarm from sounding. Conversely, apnoea unaccompanied by bradycardia does not present this problem and is detected by the alarm. If impedance alarm systems are {{to be used to}} detect apnoea they must be accompanied by a heart rate (ECG) detector. Impedance alarm systems are widely used for the detection of apnoea in the newborn infant. They are often used in the routine care of preterm infants, 25 to 84 %Y ofwhom are likely to have apnoeic attacks. 1 - 2 They have also been advocated for the protection of those infants at special risk ofsudden infant death. 34 Failures of impedance <b>apnoea</b> <b>alarm</b> systems, however, are known to occur and some have been reported. 35 These failures have occurred with no detectable electrical fault in the monitoring system, and with effective electrode contact. We are currently using combined 24 -hour electrocardiogram and respiratory tape recordings to study infants with apnoeic attacks. During this study a phenomenon was observed which could explain failures in impedance <b>apnoea</b> <b>alarm</b> systems...|$|E
40|$|Electrocardiogram and {{patterns}} of respiration were recorded continuously in 9 newborn infants having episodes of bradycardia. The episodes were not associated with demonstrable apnoea, either by using an apnoea mattress or by visual observation. The 'non-apnoea' associated bradycardia was always associated with changes in respiratory pattern, of which three different forms could be identified. These were prolonged apnoea if the <b>apnoea</b> <b>alarm</b> failed to trigger, short episodes of respiratory abnormalities associated with body movement (possibly in rapid eye movement sleep), and minor changes in respiratory pattern. It may be appropriate to incorporate a period of delay in heart rate monitoring systems before the alarm sounds, {{in a similar manner}} to <b>apnoea</b> <b>alarm</b> systems. We should rely more on heart rate in conjunction with apnoea alarms to detect problems, or produce better systems which detect respiratory flow...|$|E
40|$|To analyse {{the effects}} of apnoea and {{bradycardia}} on the oxygen saturation (SaO 2) of preterm infants and to make recommendations for <b>apnoea</b> <b>alarm</b> limits, polygraphic recordings were made on 89 occasions of 27 preterm infants; 1029 apnoeic episodes were analysed. Reduction in SaO 2 {{was positively correlated with}} duration of apnoea, but the scatter of results was such that reductions in SaO 2 of up to 40 % occurred with apnoeas of less than 10 seconds duration. The median initial SaO 2 was significantly lower in those episodes that resulted in bradycardia (92 % compared with 95 %), and there was also a significantly greater reduction in median SaO 2 (9 % compared with 5 %). This study illustrates the difficulty of setting alarm limits for the detection of apnoea. We suggest that rather than simply detecting apnoea it is more appropriate to monitor heart rate and SaO 2 in infants with recurrent apnoea...|$|E
