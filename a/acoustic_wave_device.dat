50|$|The basic surface <b>acoustic</b> <b>wave</b> <b>device</b> {{consists}} of a piezoelectric substrate, an input interdigitated transducer (IDT) {{on one side of}} the surface of the substrate, and a second, output interdigitated transducer on the other side of the substrate. The space between the IDTs, across which the surface acoustic wave will propagate, is known as the delay-line. This region is called the delay line because the signal, which is a mechanical wave at this point, moves much slower than its electromagnetic form, thus causing an appreciable delay.|$|E

40|$|We have {{developed}} a sensitive and economical method to detect analytes directly. The technique, which we term rupture event scanning (REVSTM), is based on rapidly oscillating an <b>acoustic</b> <b>wave</b> <b>device</b> on which the analytes have been captured. As the magnitude of oscillation of {{the surface of the}} <b>acoustic</b> <b>wave</b> <b>device</b> is increased, there is increasing acceleration of adherent analytes. This in turn results in a larger force exerted by the surface on the particle, that ultimately causes rupture of the bonds attaching the particle to the surface. Using the same device, we can very sensitively monitor the excitation of vibrations in the <b>acoustic</b> <b>wave</b> <b>device</b> produced by bond rupture, which are then converted into an electrical signal. The signal indicates not only the presence of specifically bound analytes and their affinity for the receptor, but also the number of analytes present. The method works in air, water and complex biological fluids, is quantitative over at least six orders of magnitude of particle titre, and in affinity from sub-mM to pM. For selected analyte–receptor systems the sensitivity can be as low as 80 fg mm− 2 (8 × 10 − 14 g mm− 2). In this paper an example application of REVSTM is presented and the physical forces involved in the process are discussed...|$|E

With quartz crystal resonators, surface <b>acoustic</b> <b>wave</b> <b>devices,</b> and {{lead zirconate titanate}} actuators, proteins, cells, and endoscope optics were manipulated. Chapters two through five detail accelerated protein and cell release from planar substrates with quartz crystal resonators and surface <b>acoustic</b> <b>wave</b> <b>devices.</b> Targeted applications include immunoassays, cell separation, and cell membrane permeation.

An optimal difference in specific vs. nonspecific protein release rates was found at 100 mW using 5 MHz quartz crystal resonators.
