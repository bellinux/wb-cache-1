50|$|Hughlings Jackson is {{believed}} to have been the person who initially contributed the term “jargon” to <b>aphasiology.</b> He used this term not to distinguish a separate type of aphasia, but to describe the language output of certain people that was meaningless and incomprehensible to the listener, although it appeared to have some meaning for the speaker3.|$|E
50|$|The {{nineteenth century}} marked the most {{important}} time {{in the evolution of}} <b>aphasiology,</b> beginning with the works of Franz Josef Gall.

50|$|<b>Aphasiology</b> is {{the study}} of {{language}} impairment usually resulting from brain damage, due to neurovascular accident—hemorrhage, stroke—or associated with a variety of neurodegenerative diseases, including different types of dementia. It is also the name of a scientific journal covering the area. These specific language deficits, termed aphasias, may be defined as impairments of language production or comprehension that cannot be attributed to trivial causes such as deafness or oral paralysis. A number of aphasias have been described, but two are best known: expressive aphasia (Broca's aphasia) and receptive aphasia (Wernicke's or sensory aphasia).|$|E

50|$|The early {{accounts}} of agrammatism involved cases of German and French participants. The greater {{sophistication of the}} German school of <b>aphasiology</b> {{at the turn of}} the 20th century and also the fact that both German and French are highly inflected languages, might have been triggers for that situation (Code, 1991). Nowadays, the image has slightly changed: grammatical impairment has been found to be selective rather than complete, and a cross-linguistic perspective under the framework of Universal Grammar (UG) together with a shift from morphosyntax to morphosemantics is à la page. Now the focus of study in agrammatism embraces all natural languages and the idiosyncrasies scholars think a specific language has are put in relation to other languages so as to better understand agrammatism, help its treatment, and review and advance in the field of theoretical linguistics.|$|E
50|$|In the {{classical}} sense, expressive aphasia {{is the result}} of injury to Broca's area; it is often the case that lesions in specific brain areas cause specific, dissociable symptoms, although case studies show there is not always a one-to-one mapping between lesion location and aphasic symptoms. The correlation between damage to certain specific brain areas (usually in the left hemisphere) and the development of specific types of aphasia makes it possible to deduce (albeit very roughly) the location of a suspected brain lesion based only on the presence (and severity) of a certain type of aphasia, though this is complicated by the possibility that a patient may have damage to a number of brain areas and may exhibit symptoms of more than one type of aphasia. The examination of lesion data in order to deduce which brain areas are essential in the normal functioning of certain aspects of cognition is called the deficit-lesion method; this method is especially important in the branch of neuroscience known as <b>aphasiology.</b> Cognitive science - to be specific, cognitive neuropsychology - are branches of neuroscience that also make extensive use of the deficit-lesion method.|$|E

40|$|The goal of {{this article}} is to {{familiarize}} the reader who has background in theoretical linguistics with some of the recent research in <b>aphasiology.</b> Needless to say, it is far beyond the space limitation, and my capacity, to present all work carried out in the field of language impairment, even during the last decade.

In this article therefore I will focus, primarily, on the psycholinguistic research that approached investigation of aphasia from a linguistic, theory-based perspective. It is my hope that the results presented below will further encourage linguists to view <b>aphasiology</b> as an important source for our understanding of the human linguistic capacity, and that aphasiologists will be further inspired to view theoretical linguistics as an important, if not necessary, tool for obtaining a better picture of language impairment...|$|E
40|$|Background: <b>Aphasiology</b> {{developed}} in the 19 th century as a primary area of research for the localisatio n of function in the brain. It {{was based on a}} rather primitive notion of language as a psychological function: input and output of words, in particular nouns. <b>Aphasiology</b> turned into neurolinguistics {{in the second half of}} the 20 th century, when researchers realised that a linguistically based theory should form the basis of the analysis of language performance deficits. Aims: The current paper argues that in a very early stage of <b>aphasiology</b> the claim was already formulated that a psycholinguistically oriented approach was necessary. This claim was made by Chajim Steinthal (1823 – 1893), but it was completely neglected. Main Contribution: In this paper, I will present Steinthal’s psycholinguistic views on aphasia, described in his textbook on psycholinguistics in 1871. Conclusions: Steinthal formulated a psycholinguistically based theory of language disorders, in which a distinction was made between disorders at the word level and at the sentence level. Moreover, the nature of the deficit was a reduction of the capacity to activate representations and not a loss of word forms. Steinthal thus may be considered a founder not only of psycholinguistics, but also of neurolinguistics...|$|E
40|$|It {{has become}} almost {{impossible}} to write a treatment plan or submit a claim to a third party payer without using the word func-tional.

40|$|Abstract-At {{the turn}} of the century, the study of {{agrammatism}} started in German <b>aphasiology</b> with the introduction of syntax as an object of research in linguistics and the psychology of language. The disorder descriptively known as agrammatism was originally thought to arise from multiple origins, at the level of syntactic word order, of function word insertion, of gramrnaticalization by means of morphology, or as an impairment of processing. In modern <b>aphasiology,</b> there have been several attempts to reduce agrammatism to a single cause, such as the loss of specific syntactic operations or a deficit in morpholexical access. This article summarizes the results of morpholexical and morpho-syntactic experiments with two German and two Italian agramrnatic patients. The cross-language data reveal far more inflectional abilities than is usually assumed for agrammatism. Furthermore, they strongly support characterizations of the disorder as a syntactic rather than a morpholexical deficit...|$|E

40|$|Background: According to many aphasiologists the {{scientific}} study of aphasia dates back to {{the second half of the}} 19 th century when Broca and Wernicke described the two classical forms of aphasia that now bear their names. About 100 years later, Benton and Joynt presented a historical overview of the literature on aphasia from the Hippocratic writings (c. 400 BC) to 1800. Since this seminal review (Benton & Joynt, 1960) there has been a growing interest in the history of <b>aphasiology,</b> resulting in many papers (cf. the Journal of the History of the Neurosciences) and even books (e. g., Eling, 1994; Finger, 2000; Jacyna, 2000) about hitherto unknown writings about aphasia. Aims: The aim of this paper is to present a new, updated, and extensive review of the early history of <b>aphasiology,</b> starting with the earliest observation of ''speechlessness'' in an Egyptian papyrus (c. 1700 BC) and ending with Broca's discovery of the ''speech centre'' in 1861. Main Contribution: By presenting and discussing passages taken from major contributions to <b>aphasiology</b> in the past 3500 years, this literature survey offers a review of the clinical observations and theoretical analyses of aphasic phenomena preceding the pioneering article by Broca in 1861. Conclusions: Although many forms and symptoms of aphasia were described and a few theoretical explanations of its nature had been advanced before 1800, significant hypotheses about the localisation of aphasia were not formulated until the period 1800 - 1860. Based on his (otherwise misguided) ''phrenological'' theory, Gall (in Gall & Stuart, 1806) was the first to localise language in the frontal cortex. This hypothesis was then tested and supported by neuropathological data collected by Bouillaud (1825) who not only localised language in the frontal lobes, but also made the fundamental distinction between ''a general faculty of language'' and ''the faculty of articulated speech'', thus preparing the ground for Broca's famous discovery in 1861...|$|E
