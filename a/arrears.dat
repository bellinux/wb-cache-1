5|$|Ursula Andress as Vesper Lynd/James Bond 007 – A retired British {{secret agent}} forced back into service in {{exchange}} for writing off her tax <b>arrears.</b>|$|E
5|$|England {{started their}} second innings 337 runs in <b>arrears.</b> Lindwall made the early breakthrough, and Edrich joined Hutton and the pair {{consolidated}} the innings {{to close at}} the end of the second day on 54/1.|$|E
5|$|England {{started their}} second innings 337 runs in <b>arrears.</b> Lindwall made the early breakthrough, bowling Crapp for 10 to leave England 20/1. Edrich joined Hutton and the pair {{consolidated}} the innings {{to close at}} the end of the second day on 54/1 due to bad light.|$|E
5|$|To {{secure the}} payment of the <b>arrears,</b> the bishop applied ecclesiastic penalties, placing whole villages under interdict in summer 1436. He also excommunicated the petty noblemen who had refused to pay the tithe. However, most serfs {{resisted}} and their lords were unwilling to assist the bishop. At the bishop's request, the king ordered the voivode and the ispáns (or heads) of the counties to secure {{the collection of the}} tithe in early September. The king also decreed that all peasants who failed to pay the <b>arrears</b> within a month after their excommunication were to pay twelve golden florins as a penalty.|$|E
5|$|A bone of contention, however, arose {{over the}} Queen's {{inheritance}} and dowry. Duke Rinaldo refused {{to release the}} former, and left the latter £15,000 in <b>arrears.</b> In 1700, five years later, the Duke finally paid the Queen her dowry; her inheritance, however, remained sequestered, and relations with Modena worsened again when Rinaldo allied himself with Holy Roman Emperor Leopold I. Leopold was an enemy of Louis XIV, James and Mary's patron.|$|E
5|$|After {{his return}} in August 1299, Lamberton was Guardian of Scotland and Nicholas became his close associate. Nicholas {{can be seen}} to have benefited as a result. He became Chancellor of Scotland by 30 January 1301. Balmyle's pension for being Chancellor was to be paid by Arbroath Abbey, for which the abbey later fell into <b>arrears.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although Manekshaw was conferred {{the rank}} of field marshal in 1973, it was {{reported}} that he was not given the complete allowances that he was entitled to as a field marshal. It was not until President A. P. J. Abdul Kalam took the initiative, when he met Manekshaw in Wellington, and made sure that the field marshal was presented with a cheque for Rs 1.3 crores (13 million)—his <b>arrears</b> of pay for over 30 years.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1600s England was at peace and Pendennis was neglected; {{reportedly}} the garrison's pay {{was two years}} in <b>arrears,</b> forcing them to gather limpets from the shoreline for food. Nonetheless, a new Italian-styled gatehouse {{was added to the}} castle, probably in 1611. War with Spain broke out again 1624 and a new defensive line, with bastions and artillery, was built across the peninsula in 1627.|$|E
5|$|People who owe 3,800,000 Lebanese Pounds ($2,500) or more {{in child}} support, are not {{eligible}} to receive a Lebanese passport. Therefore, they should make arrangements to pay the agency where child support is owed before they submit their application for a Lebanese passport. All questions about their child support <b>arrears</b> or {{the status of a}} payment should be directed to the appropriate child support enforcement agency.|$|E
5|$|The {{third day}} was {{followed}} by a rest day on Sunday and play resumed on the fourth morning, a Monday, with England still 223 runs in <b>arrears.</b> Before the start of play, the Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club (NCCC) secretary, H. A. Brown, broadcast an appeal to the gallery over the public address system to refrain from their heckling of Miller.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{was still}} some way behind when Lindwall {{replaced}} Johnson, and 15 runs later, Yardley bowled Loxton for 93, while Saggers only managed five, leaving Australia at 355/8 with only Johnston and Toshack remaining. Lindwall hit out, scoring 77 in an innings marked by powerful driving and pulling, dominating stands of 48 and 55 with Johnston and Toshack respectively. He {{was the last}} man out at 458, leaving Australia 38 runs in <b>arrears</b> on the first innings. Bedser took the final wicket to end with 3/92. Laker took 3/113, while Pollard and Yardley ended with two wickets each.|$|E
5|$|England resumed on {{the fourth}} morning with only three wickets in hand and still 159 runs in <b>arrears.</b> Johnston quickly removed the last three wickets to seal an Australian victory by an innings and 149 runs. Only ten runs were added, with Hollies being removed for a golden duck, skying a ball to Morris, {{immediately}} after Yardley was the ninth man to fall. Johnston ended with 4/40 from 27.3 overs while Lindwall took 3/50 from 25 overs. This result sealed the series 4–0 in favour of Australia. The match {{was followed by a}} series of congratulatory speeches.|$|E
5|$|Furthermore, by 1795, {{the army}} had already made itself odious, by both rumor and action, {{throughout}} France through its dependence upon the countryside of material support and its general lawlessness and undisciplined behavior. After April 1796, the military was paid in metallic value, not the worthless paper, but pay was still well in <b>arrears.</b> The French Directory believed that war should pay for itself and did not budget to pay, feed, and equip its troops. Thus, a campaign that would take the army out of France became increasingly urgent for both budgetary and internal security reasons.|$|E
5|$|Harvey's {{departure}} at 5/294 {{meant that}} {{the first of the}} bowlers, Johnson, entered the ground. This did not deter Loxton, who was particularly severe on Laker, lifting him into the crowd for four more sixes. Loxton hit two over the leg side followed by consecutive off drives into the gallery. Johnson scored 10 before falling with the score at 6/329. Fifteen runs later, Yardley bowled Loxton for 93. Loxton appeared disappointed at playing such a wild cross-batted swing with a maiden Test century beckoning. Lindwall then made 77 to propel Australia to 458 on the fourth day, just 38 runs in <b>arrears.</b>|$|E
5|$|In the Fourth Victory Test, {{again at}} Lord's, Miller {{came in at}} 3/108 and after a slow start, scored another century, taking 170 minutes to reach the mark before being removed for 118. He struck ten fours, all off which were driven. In the second innings, {{he came to the}} crease with four wickets down with Australia still in <b>arrears.</b> He scored an unbeaten 35 to ensure that Australia would not {{collapse}} further and lose the match. The public reception towards the Victory Tests resulted in an additional fifth match being added to the schedule. To warm up for that match, Miller took 3/95 against the North of England.|$|E
5|$|O'Halloran led off and put Australia in {{the lead}} with an Olympic record time of 2min 6.8s, opening a gap of 0.7s over the Soviet Union and 1.2s over the United States. The fourth-placed Italians were already a full three seconds in <b>arrears.</b> Australia never relinquished the lead and {{steadily}} increased it, as Devitt, Rose, and Henricks set the three fastest splits in the race, faster than all the non-Australian swimmers. O'Halloran's split was the fifth-fastest in the race; the Soviet anchor swimmer was the only non-Australian to swim faster, and only by 0.1s despite having {{the benefit of a}} flying start.|$|E
5|$|Ronny's {{love life}} is equally unsettled. He begins dating Kelly Taylor (Brooke Kinsella), but ends the {{relationship}} when he discovers her {{past as a}} prostitute and begins dating Kelly's best friend, Zoe Slater (Michelle Ryan). This abruptly ends when Kelly witnesses Ronny kissing another woman. Meanwhile, Adi has a romance with Sasha Perkins (Jemma Walker), a pole dancer and escort, who he initially pays {{to pretend to be}} his girlfriend. He {{spends a lot of time}} trying to impress his father but fails. Dan disappears suddenly and clears out the family's bank account, leaving his children £12,000 in mortgage <b>arrears.</b> The truth behind his disappearance is never revealed.|$|E
5|$|The United States, {{the winner}} of all {{previous}} editions of this event, was boycotting the games {{in response to the}} Soviet war in Afghanistan. As a result, the Soviet Union, Great Britain, and Sweden were expected to win. Australia's Quietly Confident Quartet, however, composed of backstroker Mark Kerry, breaststroker Peter Evans, butterflyer Mark Tonelli, and freestyler Neil Brooks, surprisingly won the final in 3:45.70. They were followed by the silver medalists Soviet Union, 0.22 seconds in <b>arrears,</b> and the bronze medalists Great Britain, as favorites Sweden had been disqualified in the heats. To date, this is the only time the United States has not won the gold medal in the event.|$|E
5|$|The anarchy in Constantinople {{had ceased}} {{after the murder}} of the pretender Constantine Doukas, however, and a {{government}} had promptly been formed with Patriarch Nicholas at the helm. This urged Simeon to raise his siege and enter peace negotiations, to the joy of the Byzantines. The protracted negotiations resulted in the payment of the <b>arrears</b> of Byzantine tribute, the promise that Constantine VII would marry one of Simeon's daughters, and, most importantly, Simeon's official recognition as Emperor of the Bulgarians by Patriarch Nicholas in the Blachernae Palace.|$|E
5|$|The result meant Buemi {{remained}} the Drivers' Championship leader on 76 points, but his advantage over di Grassi was reduced from 29 points to five. Prost remained in third position on 46 points while Vergne's second-place finish {{allowed him to}} be six points in <b>arrears</b> of the French driver. Bird's third-place result enabled him to move ahead of Rosenqvist for fifth. Audi Sport ABT's result allowed them to reduce the gap to Teams' Championship leaders e.Dams-Renault to 31 points behind the team. Virgin and Techeetah (on 43 and 41 points respectively) moved ahead of Mahindra with eight rounds left in the season.|$|E
5|$|The {{resulting}} work on Southampton's defences {{resulted in}} considerable improvements: {{by the late}} 14th century, the town was completely encircled by 2km (1.25 miles) of stone walls. Some existing buildings, including a dovecote, were reinforced and pressed into service {{as part of the}} defences. South Gate was built to protect the southern quays, with a wide archway, complete with parapets and machicolations. The building work proved very expensive, however, and despite the mayor and bailiffs enforcing contributions and assistance from the citizens, Parliament had to be asked several times in the 1370s to assist by remitting <b>arrears</b> of taxes owed by Southampton.|$|E
5|$|Though Sam Manekshaw was conferred {{the rank}} of field marshal in 1973, it was {{reported}} that he was never given the complete allowances he was entitled to as a field marshal. It was not until President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam took the initiative when he met Manekshaw in Wellington, and made sure that the field marshal was presented with a cheque for Rs 1.3 crores–his <b>arrears</b> of pay for over 30 years. Even more surprisingly, Manekshaw's funeral was not attended by the top brass from civil, military, or political leadership.|$|E
5|$|Tonelli was {{selected}} for the 1974 Commonwealth Games in Christchurch, New Zealand, where he had his first medal success at international level. He won gold in the 100m backstroke, where he won his heat comfortably before setting a Games record of 59.65s in the final. Tonelli was second behind Cooper in the 200m backstroke, finishing {{in a time of}} 2m 9.47s, more than three seconds in <b>arrears.</b> He claimed a silver in the 4100m medley relay as Australia were thwarted by Canada despite setting a national record, and was eliminated in the heats of the 200m butterfly.|$|E
5|$|While {{searching for}} her father, Binder's long-estranged {{daughter}} Natasha (Yancy Butler) is attacked {{by a group of}} muggers who saw that {{she had a lot of}} cash earlier. She is saved by a homeless man with exceptional martial-arts skills named Chance Boudreaux (Jean-Claude Van Damme), a former Marine Force Recon. Chance is initially hesitant to involve himself with her mission, but as his merchant seaman union dues are in <b>arrears</b> he reluctantly allows Natasha to hire him as her guide and bodyguard during her search. Meanwhile, Chance's homeless friend Elijah Roper (Willie C. Carpenter) is the next to participate in Fouchon's hunt, and is also killed.|$|E
5|$|Woodfull {{started his}} final English {{campaign}} slowly. In his first eight innings, he scored only 161 runs at 20.12 with one half-century. Other players sensed that Woodfull had become less cheerful following the bodyline series and {{he offered to}} drop himself following his run of poor form, but fellow selectors Bradman and Alan Kippax disagreed. In the traditional Test rehearsal against the MCC, Australia reduced the hosts to be eight down in their second innings, still in <b>arrears</b> when the match ended in a draw. In his final innings before the Tests, Woodfull struck form with 172 not out against Lancashire.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{was still}} some way behind when Lindwall {{replaced}} Johnson. Fifteen runs later, Yardley bowled Loxton for 93, while Saggers only managed five {{in his first}} Test innings before being stumped after being lured out of his crease by Laker. This left Australia at 355/8 with only Johnston and Toshack remaining. Lindwall hit out, scoring 77, an innings marked by powerful driving and pulling, dominating in stands of 48 and 55 with Johnston and Toshack respectively. Of the 103 added {{for the last two}} wickets, Johnston and Toshack managed only 25 between them. Lindwall was the last man out at 458, leaving Australia 38 runs in <b>arrears</b> on the first innings. Australia added only one run to its overnight score of 457/9, with Bedser taking the final wicket to end with 3/92. Laker took 3/113, while Pollard and Yardley ended with two wickets each.|$|E
5|$|By 536, he {{was raised}} to the honorary {{consulate}} and the rank of patricius, and held the post of magister militum praesentalis. In that year, {{he was sent to}} North Africa to succeed Solomon as military commander, with the task of suppressing a large-scale mutiny of the Byzantine troops led by Stotzas. His tenure there, described by Procopius, was a thorough success. By appearing conciliatory and paying the <b>arrears,</b> he won over {{a large part of the}} mutinous army. He then defeated the remaining rebels under Stotzas at the Battle of Scalas Veteres in the spring of 537 and stabilized the situation by suppressing another conspiracy amongst his troops (cf. Maximinus) and restoring discipline.|$|E
5|$|Diocletian's {{expansion}} {{of the army and}} civil service meant that the empire's tax burden grew. Since military upkeep took the largest portion of the imperial budget, any reforms here would be especially costly. The proportion of the adult male population, excluding slaves, serving in the army increased from roughly 1 in 25 to 1 in 15, an increase judged excessive by some modern commentators. Official troop allowances were kept to low levels, and the mass of troops often resorted to extortion or the taking of civilian jobs. <b>Arrears</b> became the norm for most troops. Many were even given payment in kind in place of their salaries. Were he unable to pay for his enlarged army, there would likely be civil conflict, potentially open revolt. Diocletian was led to devise a new system of taxation.|$|E
5|$|During the {{oil boom}} of the 1970s, Nigeria {{accumulated}} a significant foreign debt to finance major infrastructural investments. With the fall of oil prices during the 1980s oil glut Nigeria struggled {{to keep up with}} its loan payments and eventually defaulted on its principal debt repayments, limiting repayment to the interest portion of the loans. <b>Arrears</b> and penalty interest accumulated on the unpaid principal, which increased the size of the debt. After negotiations by the Nigeria authorities, in October 2005 Nigeria and its Paris Club creditors reached an agreement under which Nigeria repurchased its debt at a discount of approximately 60%. Nigeria used part of its oil profits to pay the residual 40%, freeing up at least $1.15billion annually for poverty reduction programmes. Nigeria made history in April 2006 by becoming the first African country to completely pay off its debt (estimated $30billion) owed to the Paris Club.|$|E
5|$|England resumed on {{the fourth}} morning with only three wickets in hand and they were still 159 runs in <b>arrears.</b> Johnston quickly removed the last three wickets to seal an Australian victory by an innings and 149 runs. Only ten runs were added; the match ended when Hollies fell for a golden duck after skying a ball to Morris, {{immediately}} after Yardley's departure. Johnston ended with 4/40 from 27.3 overs while Lindwall took 3/50 from 25 overs. Miller claimed 2/22 while Ring bowled the most overs, 28, to finish with 1/44. Given the time lost to inclement weather on the first day, Australia had won the match {{in less than three}} days of playing time.|$|E
5|$|England {{started their}} second innings 337 runs in <b>arrears.</b> Dewes took strike and {{got off the}} mark from Lindwall when he aimed a hook shot and was {{credited}} with a boundary when the ball came off his shoulder. Lindwall's steepling bouncer rose over his bat and narrowly missed his head. Soon after, Lindwall made the early breakthrough, bowling Dewes—who offered no shot—for 10 to leave England 20/1. Dewes had often committed to playing the ball from the front foot before the bowler delivered the ball, thereby putting himself into difficulty. This was because of his habit of leaning his weight onto his back foot as the ball was being bowled, which meant that a forward lean would instinctively result. Edrich joined Hutton and the pair consolidated the England innings, which reached 54/1 at the close at the second day's play, which was hastened by bad light.|$|E
5|$|Entering the Olympics, the Australian public {{expected}} Thorpe {{to deliver}} multiple world records and gold medals as a formality; Sydney's Daily Telegraph posted a front-page spread headlined Invincible. Thorpe cruised through the heats of the 400m {{on the first}} morning of competition, posting a new Olympic record and shortening bookmakers' odds to 50–1. By the time the final was held that night, the pressure had intensified—the host nation had yet to win its first gold medal. Thorpe led throughout, and although Italy's Massimiliano Rosolino was within a body length at the 300m mark, Thorpe's finishing kick extended the final margin to three body lengths. This set a new world record of 3min 40.59s. Secret tests {{carried out by the}} Italian National Olympic Committee prior to the Olympics later showed that Rosolino had abnormal levels of human growth hormone. Rosolino aside, Thorpe had left bronze medallist Klete Keller fifteen metres in <b>arrears.</b>|$|E
5|$|In October–November 938, Bajkam and the Caliph campaigned {{against the}} {{influential}} Hamdanid emir of Mosul, Hasan ibn Abdallah, {{who had taken}} advantage of the turmoil in Iraq to cease forwarding his province's revenue to Baghdad. Although Bajkam's army captured Mosul, Hasan fled before him to the remotest corners of his domain, where Bajkam's forces pursued him in vain. In the meantime, the local population resented the presence of the caliphal troops and launched guerilla warfare against them, while Ibn Ra'iq used Bajkam's absence to take control of Baghdad {{at the head of a}} Carmathian force. These developments forced Bajkam to negotiate with his rivals: the Hamdanids were restored in their province in exchange for the payment of the tax <b>arrears,</b> and Ibn Ra'iq was bought off with the governorship of the provinces of Tariq al-Furat, Diyar Mudar, Qinnasrin and al-'Awasim, which were also claimed by the Ikhshidids of Egypt. This arrangement allowed Bajkam and the Caliph to return to Baghdad in February 939.|$|E
5|$|In the final, Jastremski {{attacked}} {{from the}} outset as expected, while O'Brien raced with a characteristically even pace. After being fourth at the halfway mark behind Jastremski, Prokopenko and Henninger, O'Brien panicked and accelerated in the third 50m and overtook Jastremski, leaving the American in fourth place. He then moved past Henninger, before overtaking Prokopenko. O'Brien's acceleration in the third meant that he tired at the end, but he had enough energy to fend off Prokopenko in the late stages to win {{the gold medal in}} a new world record time of 2min 27.8s, a margin of 0.4s, with Jastremski a further 1.4s in <b>arrears.</b> O'Brien had reduced his personal best time by more than four seconds during the Olympics to claim an upset win.|$|E
5|$|Kouao and Climbié {{left the}} Ivory Coast {{possibly}} in November 1998 and flew to Paris, France, where Climbié enrolled at school. By December 1998, however, Kouao began to receive warnings about Climbié's absenteeism, and in February 1999, the school issued a child-at-risk notification {{and a social}} worker became involved. The school observed how Climbié tended to fall asleep in class, and the headteacher later recalled Kouao's mentioning Climbié suffering from some form of dermatological condition and that, on her last visit to the school on 25 March 1999, Climbié had a shaven head and was wearing a wig. When they left France, Kouao owed the authorities £2,000, after being wrongly paid in child benefit, and it is claimed that Kouao viewed Climbié as {{a useful tool for}} claiming benefits. Kouao had also been evicted from her home in France because of rent <b>arrears.</b>|$|E
5|$|Messi's {{financial}} affairs {{came under}} investigation in 2013 for suspected tax evasion. Offshore companies in tax havens Uruguay and Belize were allegedly used to evade €4.1million in taxes related to sponsorship earnings between 2007 and 2009. An unrelated shell company in Panama, {{set up in}} 2012, was subsequently identified as belonging to the Messis in the Panama Papers data leak. Messi, who pleaded ignorance of the alleged scheme, voluntarily paid <b>arrears</b> of €5.1million in August 2013. He stood trial alongside his father on three counts of tax evasion in May 2016. On 6 July 2016, Messi and his father were both found guilty of tax fraud and were handed suspended 21-month prison sentences and respectively ordered to pay €1.7million and €1.4million in fines.|$|E
