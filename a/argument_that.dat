5|$|A related {{objection}} is {{that evolution}} {{is based on}} unreliable evidence, claiming that evolution is not even well-evidenced. Typically, this is either based on the <b>argument</b> <b>that</b> evolution's evidence is full of frauds and hoaxes, that current evidence for evolution {{is likely to be}} overturned as some past evidence has been, or that certain types of evidence are inconsistent and dubious.|$|E
5|$|Academic Andrew Price-Smith {{has made}} the <b>argument</b> <b>that</b> the virus helped tip {{the balance of power}} in the later days of the war towards the Allied cause.

5|$|At {{the same}} time, there was common resentment against the reactionary attitudes {{prevailing}} in Court circles {{even before the}} uproar sparked by the notorious banquet precipitated the political aspects of the march. Deeper planners in the crowd spread the word that the king needed to dismiss his royal bodyguards entirely and replace them all with patriotic National Guardsmen, a line of <b>argument</b> <b>that</b> had a compelling resonance among Lafayette's soldiers.|$|E
5|$|From December 1851 to March 1852, Marx wrote The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Napoleon, a {{work on the}} French Revolution of 1848 {{in which}} he {{expanded}} upon his concepts of historical materialism, class struggle and the dictatorship of the proletariat, advancing the <b>argument</b> <b>that</b> victorious proletariat has to smash the bourgeois state.|$|E
5|$|Given {{that the}} {{matching}} vocabulary and astronomical content {{is drawn from}} throughout Polynesia, far afield from Easter Island, this supports the <b>argument</b> <b>that</b> rongorongo was not a recent, localized development; rather it {{was a product of}} thriving Polynesian trade and cultural interaction throughout the Pacific. There is additional evidence in favor of this theory, such as the identification of Polaris among the glyphs, which is only visible from the northern hemisphere.|$|E

5|$|On systems which don't {{support the}} F571 extension, it is {{possible}} to emulate IS UNKNOWN p by going over every <b>argument</b> <b>that</b> could make the expression p Unknown and test those arguments with IS NULL or other NULL-specific functions, although this may be more cumbersome.|$|E
5|$|Owen's <b>argument</b> <b>that</b> the Federal Reserve's deflationary stance {{was largely}} {{responsible}} for causing the Great Depression {{would have been considered}} unorthodox at the time he made it. In more recent decades, however, such a view has come to be widely accepted, {{due in large part to}} the influence of the 1963 study A Monetary History of the United States by Milton Friedman and Anna J. Schwartz.|$|E

5|$|The {{diversity}} of monuments falling within the potbelly sculptural {{tradition and the}} individuality of the monuments support the <b>argument</b> <b>that</b> the monuments represent individual rulers.
