500|$|... 'St. Paul Missionary Baptist Church Blues' {{focuses on}} the {{decaying}} value of a real life abandoned church in Grand Rapids and how that was a striking contrast to the popularity of other churches. 'Edit Your Hometown', {{has been described as}} [...] "treading the boundary between melodrama and actual drama" [...] by Ben Patashnik of 'Rock Sound'. 'The Most Beautiful Bitter Fruit' deals with the hypothetical author's sexuality, by exploring and questioning his inability to participate in casual sex. 'King Park', a seven-minute ballad, focuses on inner-city gang culture and follows the perspective of an individual who is engrossed by a drive-by shooting; and also follows how the drive by shooter, plagued by guilt, commits suicide. Dreyer described the true story behind the song: [...] "A year or two ago, down the street from where Brad <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>work,</b> a kid was shot. It's an area that's been riddled with gang violence, which has been really sad to witness." [...] 'Edward Benz, 27 Times' {{is the story of a}} father dealing with the pain of being brutally attacked by his schizophrenic son, while [...] "I See Everything" [...] describes parents losing their seven-year-old son to cancer.|$|E
2500|$|In a 2012 {{interview}} with People, Selleck talked about {{living and working}} on his farm: [...] "So I like to get outside {{and work on the}} farm, from fixing roads to clearing brush. I hate going to the gym, so sweating outdoors sure beats sitting on a stationary bike staring at my navel. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>work</b> cheaper than anyone I could hire to do it." [...] Selleck has also stated he dislikes avocados.|$|E
2500|$|Havins {{agreed with}} Riegel that the reveal scenes were exciting. [...] "I'm always {{up for a}} {{challenge}} <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>work</b> best under pressure," [...] she said. [...] "My competitive side kicks in. So the thought that I maybe couldn't do it made me be like, 'Oh, yeah, I'm doin' it!' We put so much preparation into it." [...] Justin Bruening (Jamie Martin) and Jacob Young (JR) were the only other cast members in the episode. [...] "...I worked with a private coach, we worked on it together.... We {{put a lot of}} time into this episode," [...] Havins stated. [...] "We usually don't have that luxury, but this time we did; this took priority. And shooting it, too, we knew it was a big deal." [...] She revealed that the producers and director were patient with them. [...] "And if we felt we didn't like where a take went, usually they're like, 'No, it's fine, let's move on,' but this time they were like, 'Let's do it again. We loved that take, girls, but let's try something else,' and we'd go in a totally different direction." [...] She said, [...] "They took the time and they were as invested in this episode as [...] and I were, so that was a really good feeling. We were all there, we were all in it together, and hopefully, the finished product shows it." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "No," [...] he answered, [...] "I am {{not at all}} important, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>work</b> in a shop because I am an inventor--or try to be--in the {{electrical}} line. My name is Morris Monk, and I am the son of Colonel Monk, and live at the Abbey House, Monksland. Now you know all about me." ...|$|E

5000|$|Perry King later {{recalled}} [...] "we actually all {{worked very hard}} on that film. Both Carroll Baker <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>worked</b> very hard especially... I think it was their attempt at a mainstream film... It was cast {{like it was a}} Hollywood film." ...|$|R
60|$|I dripped with sweat, but I {{never ceased}} from my stride, though I could feel {{exhaustion}} coming on. By ten {{o'clock in the}} morning, {{so much of my}} body's energy had I consumed, <b>I</b> felt hungry <b>and</b> snatched a thick double-slice of bread and butter from my dinner pail. This I devoured, standing, grimed with coal-dust, my knees trembling under me. By eleven o'clock, in this fashion I had consumed my whole lunch. But what of it? I realised that it would enable me to continue working through the noon hour. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>worked</b> all the afternoon. Darkness came on, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>worked</b> under the electric lights. The day fireman went off and the night fireman came on. I plugged away.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I had my spear with me,' said Pivi. 'It {{was quite}} dry inside the shell, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>worked</b> {{away at the}} fish with my spear, till he saw reason to open his shell, <b>and</b> out <b>I</b> came.' Then the good woman laughed; and Pivi and his two wives lived happy ever afterwards.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am an American, too, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>work</b> {{three hours}} every day, unless I am passing from {{one point to}} another on public {{business}} with my husband. Even then we prefer to stop during the work-hours, and help in the fields, or in the shops, or wherever we are needed. I left my own mother at home doing her kitchen work yesterday afternoon, though {{it was out of}} hours, and she need not have worked." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "As I was saying, I do {{very little}} work in Hartford. I {{come here for}} three months every year, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>work</b> {{four or five hours}} a day in a study down the garden of that little house on the hill. Of course, I do not object to two or three interruptions. When a man is in the full swing of his work these little things do not affect him. Eight or ten or twenty interruptions retard composition." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, indeed! I haven't learnt to get {{on without}} them yet. My rewards are not drawers, or presents, or holidays, but they are things which I like {{as much as you}} do the others. The good {{behavior}} and success of my boys is one of the rewards I love best, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>work</b> for it as I want you to work for your cabinet. Do what you dislike, and do it well, and you get two rewards, one, the prize you see and hold; the other, the satisfaction of a duty cheerfully performed. Do you understand that?" ...|$|E
25|$|Bob Summers, my brother-in-law, {{has come}} into his own over the years too. Bob <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>worked</b> a lot on MGM records with the Mike Curb scene, early 1960s. He also was chief {{arranger}} for the Mike Curb Congregation, and they recorded some of my material, great too! Also Bob <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>worked</b> at Capitol Records for Ken Nelson and Cliffie Stone, passed recently. Too many country artists to even name nearly all of them: Hank Thompson, Wynn Stewart, Rose Maddox and others. Roy Lanham did one of his better albums at the Sound House, Merced, in El Monte (my old stamping grounds) and Mary Ford's home place, 9840 Kale Street. Bruce Summers (who is no longer with us), a piano man whom I played with a few times; a real swinger too.|$|R

5000|$|The {{album was}} co-produced by David Cole, whom Marx enjoyed working with. Cole had {{previously}} produced singer-songwriter Bob Seger's album Like a Rock which Marx {{stated that it}} [...] "...sounded great.

6000|$|... "Don't {{you mean}} rather, Jane, {{how it looks}} for us NOT to want her?" [...] Mrs. Brook amended with a {{detachment}} now complete. [...] "Of course, dear old friend," [...] she continued to Mr. Longdon, [...] "she quite puts me with {{my back to the}} wall when she helps you to see--what you otherwise mightn't guess--that Edward <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>work</b> it out between us to show off as tender parents and yet to get from you everything you'll give. I do the sentimental and he the practical; so that we, after one fashion and another, deck ourselves in the glory of our sacrifice without forfeiting the 'keep' of our daughter. This must appeal to you as another useful illustration of what London manners have come to; unless indeed," [...] Mrs. Brook prattled on, [...] "it only strikes you still more--and to a degree that blinds you to its other possible bearings--as the last proof that I'm too tortuous for you to know what I'd be at!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Kerridge or no kerridge," [...] said he, [...] "they're good 'nough {{quality for}} me, and I reckon I knows what quality is. They hain't got much money, that's sure, but there's lots of quality that ain't got money; and he's got sense, and that's better than money. When he fust come here, I jes' goes to him, and ses I, 'How's you goin' {{to run this}} farm, sir,--ramshackle or reg'lar?' He looked at me kinder bothered, and then I 'splained. 'Well,' said he, 'reg'lar will cost more money than I've got, and I reckon we'll have to run it ramshackle.' That's what we did, and we're gittin' along fust rate.

60|$|I have so huge {{a desire}} {{to know exactly what}} you are doing, that I suppose I should tell you what I am doing by way of an example.

6000|$|... 'The {{constant}} {{sense of}} his preservation from that great danger really prevents my feeling so acutely perhaps as I ought to do the distress of others. I really think I ought to be less cheerful and happy than I feel myself to be. I had a pleasant little talk with Dr. Pusey on Monday: he was recommending me two or three books for Hebrew reading, but they would be of no use to me yet; the language is difficult to advance far into, and you know my shallow way of catching a thing at first rather quickly perhaps, but only superficially. I find my interest increasing greatly in philological studies. One language helps another very much; and the beautiful {{way in which the}} words, ideas, and the whole structure indeed, of language pervades whole families, and even the different families, (e.g., the Indo-Germanic and Semitic races,) is not only interesting, but very useful. I wish I had made myself a better Greek and Latin scholar, but unfortunately I used to hate classics. What desperate uphill work it was to read them, a regular exercise of self-denial every morning! Now I like it beyond any study, except Divinity proper, and I try {{to make up for lost}} time. There are admirable books in my possession which facilitate the acquisition of critical scholarship very much, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>work</b> at these, principally applying it to New Test. Greek, LXX, &c. But my real education began, I think, with my first foreign trip. It seems as if there was not time for all this, for I have Hebrew, Arabic, &c., to go on with (though this is a slow process), Pearson, Hooker, Blunt on the Reformation (a mere sketch which I read in a day or two at odd times), Commentaries, Trench's Books on Parables and Miracles, which are in my room at home, and would in parts interest you; he is a writer of good common sense, and a well-read man). But I of course want to be reading history as well, and that involves a good deal; physical geography, geology, &c., yet one things helps another very much. I don't work quite as methodically as I ought; and I much want some one to discuss matters with relating to what I read. I don't say all this, I am sure you know, as if I wanted to make out that I am working at grand subjects. I know exceeding little of any one of them, so little history, e.g., that a school girl could expose my ignorance directly, but I like to know what we are doing among ourselves, and we all get to know each other better thereby. I felt so much of late with regard to Jem, that a natural reserve prevents so often members even of the same family from communicating freely to each other their opinions, business, habits of life, experiences of sympathy, approval, disapproval, and the like; and when one member is gone, then it is felt how much more closely such a habit of dealing with each other would have taught us to know him.... Nothing tests one's knowledge so well as questions and answers upon what we have read, stating difficulties, arguments which we can't understand, &c., to each other. Ladies who have no profession to prepare for, in spite of a very large correspondence and numerous household duties, may (in addition to their parochial work as curates!) take up a real course of reading and go into it thoroughly; and this gives girls not only employment for the time, but gives the mind power to seize every other subject presented to it. If you are quite alone, your reading is apt to become desultory. I find it useful to take once or twice a week a walk with Riddell of Balliol, and go through a certain period of Old Testament history; it makes me get it up, and then between us we hammer out so many more explanations of difficult passages than, at all events, I should do by myself. He is, moreover, about the best Greek scholar here, which is a great help to me. You have no idea of the light that such accurate scholarship as his throws upon many disputed passages in the Bible, e.g., [...] "Wisdom is justified of her children," [...] where the Greek preposition probably gives the key to the whole meaning, and many such. So you see, dear old Fan, that the want of some one to pour out this to, for it sounds fearfully pedantic, I confess, has drawn upon you this grievous infliction.|$|E
