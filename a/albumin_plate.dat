40|$|Alpha- 1 -Antitrypsin (A- 1 -AT) is {{a member}} of the very large of serum proteins. Its name {{suggests}} its function to some extent, It moves in the alpha- 1 region in zone electrophoresis at a pH of 8. 6, this being the zone immediate following the major zone containing <b>albumin</b> (<b>Plate</b> 1 - 1). The name would suggest that it is a protein which acts against, or inhibits, the proteolytic enzyme, trypsin. However, its spectrum of protease inhibition is far wider than this and involves enzymes such as thrombin, plasmin, elastase, collagenase, chymotrypsin, and proteolytic enzymes from polymorphonuclear leukocytes. In other words, it is a broad spectrum anti-protease. A- 1 -AT is normally present in human serum at a concentration of about 212 mg/ 100 ml of serum. However, persons have been found in which the concentration of A- 1 -AT is only about 10 % the normal level. Other persons have been found who have an intermediate level of about 60 % the normal level. These deficient persons can be detected by electrophoresis in media such as paper, agarose or cellulose...|$|E
5000|$|Screenless {{lithography}} is a reprographic {{technique for}} halftoning dating to 1855, when the French chemist and civil engineer Alphonse Poitevin discovered the light-sensitive properties of bichromated gelatin and invented both the photolithography and collotype processes. After {{the invention of}} the halftone screen in the 1880s, screenless lithography was abandoned. Until the end of World War II, two kinds of photomechanically made plates were used in lithography: <b>albumin</b> <b>plates</b> and deep-etch plates. Presensitized plates appeared in the 1950s, and wipe-on plates appeared in the 1960s.|$|R
30|$|An {{indirect}} ELISA assay {{was performed}} {{according to the}} manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, microtiter plates were coated for 24  h with the samples diluted 1 : 2 in PBS with 5 % <b>albumin.</b> <b>Plates</b> were then washed four times with wash buffer (PBS with 0.05 % Tween- 20), and the antibody was added to each plate for 2  h at room temperature. After washing, a second incubation with anti-rabbit antibody peroxidase conjugated (diluted 1 : 1000) for 1  h at room temperature was carried out. After the addition of substrates (hydrogen peroxide and tetramethylbenzidine 1 : 1, v/v), the samples were read at 450  nm in a plate spectrophotometer.|$|R
30|$|As a {{positive}} control, time-course changes in CD 63 expression in adhered platelets activated by 0.1 % CaCl 2 were evaluated (Additional file  1 : Figure S 3). Activated platelets showed upregulated CD 62 P {{in the initial}} phase of aggregation, and this elevated level was maintained for up to 60  min. On the surface of bovine serum <b>albumin</b> (BSA)-coated cp-Ti <b>plates,</b> CD 63 expression in individual platelets seemed similar to or somewhat less than that {{on the surface of}} the control.|$|R
30|$|Extracellular lipase {{activity}} of Candida strains was examined on YNB-rhodamine B plates as previously described (Nemeth et al. 2013). Briefly, strains were inoculated onto YNB-rhodamine B (yeast nitrogen base) plates (Sigma-Aldrich) and incubated at 30  °C for 7  days. Lipase positivity {{was determined by}} the presence of pink halo around the colonies. For the detection of proteolytic activity, Candida strains were cultured on YCB-BSA (yeast carbon base—bovine serum <b>albumin,</b> Sigma-Aldrich) agar <b>plates</b> at 30  °C for 7  days, and proteolysis around the colonies was visualised by amido black (Sigma-Aldrich) staining (Nemeth et al. 2013).|$|R
30|$|An {{indirect}} {{enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay}} (ELISA) {{was performed}} to analyze the changes in 3 -nitrotyrosine content. Briefly, an anti- 3 -nitrotyrosine polyclonal rabbit antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was diluted 2, 000 -fold in PBS with 5 % albumin according to the manufacturer's instructions. Then, microtiter plates (96 wells, with flat bottom) were coated for 24  h with the samples that had been diluted 1 : 2 in PBS with 5 % <b>albumin.</b> The <b>plates</b> were washed four times with wash buffer (PBS with 0.05 % Tween- 20), and the antibody was added to each plate for 2  h at room temperature. After washing, a second incubation with anti-rabbit antibody peroxidase conjugate (diluted 1 : 1, 000) was performed for 1  h at room temperature. After the addition of substrates, the samples were read in a plate spectrophotometer at 450  nm. The results are expressed as changes in the percentage among the groups [19].|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to use a 5 ′-nuclease (TaqMan) real-time PCR method with primers and probe specific to the spaQ gene as a rapid approach to quantitatively determine Salmonella Typhimurium. The result showed that the correlation coefficient between real-time PCR estimates and bovine serum <b>albumin</b> (BSA) <b>plate</b> counts of S. Typhimurium was 0. 99, independently of 105 -fold numbers of bystander Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7 or total viable counts. The sensitivity of the real-time quantitative PCR assay was 10 CFU/mL for pure S. Typhimurium culture without enrichment. A known number of S. Typhimurium target cells were inoculated to dumpling fillings and chicken nuggets and DNA was extracted for real-time PCR analysis. The sensitivity was 60 CFU/g for S. Typhimurium inoculated to the food samples without any preceding procedure of enrichment. The duration of the entire experiment from DNA isolation and purification to PCR amplification was less than 12 h. This study demonstrated that realtime PCR is a rapid and reliable technique for quantifying S. Typhimurium possessing the spaQ gene in pure culture and in meat products. ...|$|R
40|$|An Elisa for an {{inhibitor}} of {{tissue-type plasminogen activator}} (t-PA) from Erythrina caffra Thunb. {{was developed}} using polyclonal antibodies. The optimal antibody concentration used to coat the wells was 6 mgl− 1. Tween 20 in the incubation and washing buffers reduced the non-specific binding to the wells notably and was more effective than blocking with bovine serum <b>albumin.</b> Rinsing the <b>plates</b> three to six times had no {{significant effect on the}} efficiency of the assay. The optimum incubation period for the assay was 60 min. Large differences were found in the sensitivity of the assay with the use of different makes of microtiter plates. The t-PA inhibitor was detected in the leaves of 24 species belonging to the genus Erythrina. Large differences in the t-PA inhibitor levels were found between species but no correlation was found between the t-PA inhibitor content of the species and their taxonomical sections or their geographical distribution. The t-PA inhibitor was not found in members of other genera of the Leguminosae such as Glycine max (L.) Merrill, Pisum sativum L. and Phaseolus vulgaris L...|$|R
40|$|Objectives. We {{sought to}} {{describe}} the prevalence of a hyaluronidase gene and hyaluronidase production in 197 clinical isolates of P. acnes; we assessed kinetics of hyaluronidase production in a subset of three isolates. Methods. The hyaluronidase gene was detected using polymerase chain reaction. Hyaluronidase production was detected by growing isolates on BHI agar containing 400 [*]μg/mL hyaluronic acid and 1 % <b>albumin</b> and flooding <b>plates</b> with 2 [*]N glacial acetic acid to precipitate unbound hyaluronic acid, with a zone of clearing representing a positive phenotype. Hyaluronidase production kinetics were measured {{as a function of}} hyaluronic acid digestion over time in a liquid medium. Results. A hyaluronidase gene and hyaluronidase production were detected in 100 and 97 % of P. acnes isolates, respectively. Hyaluronidase production in liquid medium was detectable after 96 hours of growth. Conclusions. Hyaluronidase production is nearly universal among P. acnes isolates. Three days appear to be required for significant hyaluronidase production in a liquid medium. Detection of hyaluronidase in tissue specimens may be a strategy to differentiate P. acnes infection from colonization when P. acnes is isolated from a clinical specimen...|$|R
40|$|Mucus {{hypersecretion}} in airways is {{a common}} pathological change observed in chronic inflammatory diseases and asthma. We investigated the new role of cell attachment to the extracellular matrix (ECM) on {{the production of the}} airway mucus protein, MUC 5 AC mucin, in human airway epithelial cells, NCI-H 292. MUC 5 AC levels of cells cultured on low adhesion plates were 10 -fold higher than those of cells cultured on adhesion plates. Cells cultured on bovine serum <b>albumin</b> (BSA) coated <b>plates,</b> which produce low adhesion conditions, also induced the up-regulation of MUC 5 AC. Mucin staining by PAS and MUC 5 AC immunodetection confirmed that mucin proteins were overproduced under low adhesion conditions. The major adhesion molecule between cells and the ECM was integrins. A time-course experiment showed that the expression patterns of integrin β 1 and MUC 5 AC protein were inversely proportional. The inhibition of integrin β 1 induced an increase in MUC 5 AC production in cells cultured under adhesion conditions, but not under low adhesion conditions. These results suggested that cell attachment regulates MUC 5 AC production, which is up-regulated by low adhesion to the ECM, and MUC 5 AC production is inversely proportional to the function of integrin β 1. </p...|$|R
40|$|Silicon, in {{the form}} of sodium {{silicate}} (Na 2 SiO 3), adsorbed onto bovine serum <b>albumin</b> (BSA) -precoated <b>plates</b> served as the solid-phase antigen in an enzyme immunoassay to detect silicate-reactive antibodies in the plasma of 40 symptomatic women with silicone breast implants, 91 asymptomatic women with silicone breast implants, 50 healthy control women, and 52 women with rheumatic diseases and without silicone breast implants, Silicate-reactive antibodies of immunoglobulin G (IgG) or IgM isotypes were detected in the plasma of 30 % (12 of 40) of the symptomatic women with silicone breast implants; 9 % (8 of 91) of the asymptomatic women with silicone breast implants; 5 % (1 of 20) of the women without implants who had systemic lupus erythematosus; and 0 % (0 of 32) of the women without implants who had either Sjögren syndrome, scleroderma, or rheumatoid arthritis. Only 2 % (1 of 50) of the sera from the healthy control women contained silicate-reactive antibodies. Preincubation of sera with silicate and eight other metal compounds (including SiO 2) demonstrated that the IgG and IgM antibodies bound specifically to silicate, because preincubation with Na 2 SiO 3 inhibited more than 90 % of the activity, whereas CrO 3, Li 2 SO 4, MgSO 4, NiSO 4, HgCl 2, ZrOCl 2, BeSO 4, and SiO 2 failed to inhibit the IgG or IgM antibody binding to the silicate-BSA plates. Furthermore, the F(ab') 2 portion and not the Fc portion of the silicate-reactive IgG was reactive with BSA-bound silicate in the enzyme immunoassay. The assay for silicate-reactive antibodies was quantified by assigning arbitrary units to a standard curve composed of serial twofold dilutions of high-positive (ten times higher than the cutoff) silicate antibody sera. This novel assay is a useful method for detecting and quantifying humoral immune response to silicate...|$|R
