Feral cats, foxes and mosquito fish (Gambusia affinis) have been listed as creating key threatening processes (predation, competition and vegetation alteration) under the Threatened Species Conservation Act, 1995 (NSW). Chytrid fungus infecting frogs and feral deer causing environmental degradation (such as trampling and accelerating erosion), are also considered to cause threatening processes.|$|E

500|$|In 2014, Major League Baseball {{introduced}} the Trevor Hoffman National League Reliever of the Year Award, which is awarded annually {{to the top}} reliever in the NL. [...] Hoffman became eligible for induction into the Baseball Hall of Fame starting in 2016. In his debut, he fell short of the 75 percent of votes required for entry, but the 67.3 percent he received {{in his first year}} was promising for possible induction in the future. [...] No career reliever has reached Cooperstown on the first ballot, and only six relievers have been inducted. In 2017, Hoffman received 74 percent of the vote, falling five votes short of induction. Lee Smith, the all-time saves leader for 12 years before he was surpassed by Hoffman, was not inducted in 2017 in his 15th and final year on the ballot. Buster Olney of ESPN says any discussion of Hoffman's deficiencies in the postseason and All-Star Games are small samples compared to his incredible body of work over 18 years. [...] Zimniuch wrote that Hoffman and Rivera are [...] "the best of the best of the one-inning closers". Less than 10 percent of Hoffman's saves were over one inning. Closers as a whole have been criticized for pitching almost exclusively in the ninth inning with no runners on base, while star relievers previously were called firemen, entering games in the middle of innings with runners on base and capable of pitching multiple innings. Saves arguably became overrated as firemen gave way to closers. However, Joe Strauss of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch in 2007 proposed that 500 saves (let alone 600) would be enough for him to validate Hoffman's induction if Sutter was invited with his 300 career saves. Moreover, Hoffman might have accumulated much more than 601 saves had he played for more successful teams. During his tenure in San Diego, the Padres won at least 90 games only twice and had nine losing seasons, including five with no more than 70 wins. Hall of Fame voter Dan Graziano of the Newark Star-Ledger said, [...] "I don't think much of the save as a stat, but I'm looking at a guy who's been a lockdown closer for more than a decade. Closers <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> and important part of the game, and either he or Rivera has been the best one for the past decade." [...] Some opponents of Hoffman's induction, including Jeff Passan of Yahoo! Sports and Keith Law of ESPN.com, maintain that his limited innings mitigate his impact compared to starting pitchers who have not been inducted, while Joe Posnanski of NBC Sports and writer Joe Sheehan posit that those starters could have excelled as closers, but Hoffman would not have succeeded as a starter. Hoffman pitched [...] innings in his career, which tops only Sutter (1,042) among pitchers already inducted in the Hall of Fame.|$|E

To an aria in her role, [...] "Falsa immagine", there is attached a famous story, vividly illustrating both her character {{and that of the}} composer. The part not having been originally intended for her (but perhaps for Maddalena Salvai), at rehearsal she refused to sing this, her first aria. According to the historian John Mainwaring, Handel replied: [...] "Oh! Madame I know well that you <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> she-devil, but I hereby give you notice, me, that I am Beelzebub, the Chief of Devils." [...] Mainwaring continued: [...] "With this, he took her up by the waist, and, if she made any more words, swore that he would fling her out of the window." [...] According to Burney, her singing of this aria [...] "fixed her reputation as an expressive and pathetic singer", and her success was such that the price of half-guinea opera tickets reportedly shot up to four guineas. By the time of her benefit concert only two months later, some noblemen were believed to be giving her fifty guineas a ticket. Her salary was also large: £2000 a season. Her appearance was no recommendation: Burney described her as [...] "short and squat, with a doughy cross face, but fine complexion; ... not a good actress; dressed ill and was silly and fantastical." ...|$|E
