5|$|A {{critical}} {{aspect of}} successful decompression {{is that the}} depth and ascent rate of the diver must be monitored and sufficiently accurately controlled. Practical in-water decompression requires a reasonable tolerance for variation in depth <b>and</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> ascent, but unless the decompression is being monitored in real time by a decompression computer, any deviations from the nominal profile will affect the risk. Several items of equipment are used to assist in facilitating accurate adherence to the planned profile, by allowing the diver to more easily control depth and ascent rate, or to transfer this control to specialist personnel at the surface.|$|E
5|$|A slow-moving {{predator}} feeding {{mainly on}} bony fishes, the sicklefin lemon shark seldom travels long distances and many individuals {{can be found}} year-round at certain locations. Like other members of its family, this species is viviparous, with females giving birth {{to no more than}} 13 pups every other year, following a gestation period of 1011 months. Although they are potentially dangerous to humans and known to respond vigorously to any provocation, under normal circumstances, sicklefin lemon sharks are cautious and tend to retreat if approached. The IUCN has assessed this species as Vulnerable; its low reproductive productivity <b>and</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> movement limits the capacity of depleted stocks to recover. Off India and Southeast Asia, this species has been severely depleted or extirpated by unregulated exploitation for its meat, fins, and liver oil.|$|E
5|$|The {{composition}} <b>and</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> CSF generation {{are influenced}} by hormones and the content and pressure of blood and CSF. For example, when CSF pressure is higher, there {{is less of a}} pressure difference between the capillary blood in choroid plexuses and the CSF, decreasing the rate at which fluids move into the choroid plexus and CSF generation. The autonomic nervous system influences choroid plexus CSF secretion, with activation of the sympathetic nervous system increasing secretion and the parasympathetic nervous system decreasing it. Changes in the pH of the blood can affect the activity of carbonic anhydrase, and some drugs (such as frusemide, acting on the Na-K-Cl cotransporter) have the potential to impact membrane channels.|$|E

5|$|The {{design for}} the ships was drawn up between 1910 and 1912.

Among these deficiencies were increased weight, reduced ammunition supply <b>and</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> fire, and loss of fighting capability if one of the turrets was disabled. It was therefore decided to arm the new vessels with eight 38cm guns instead of twelve 30.5cm guns.|$|E

Relationships between aerobic capacities, heart <b>rates</b> <b>and</b> <b>rating</b> <b>of</b> perceived exertion were established for Mexican American young adults. The independent variable in the proposed study was gender (male and female). The response variables in the study were the measured volumetric oxygen consumption (in liters/minute), the heart <b>rate</b> (in beats/minute) <b>and</b> the <b>rating</b> <b>of</b> perceived exertion (on a Borg 2 ̆ 7 s scale of 6 to 20). The aerobic capacity was measured for a whole body task using the treadmill, Specific research objectives were: (1) To obtain aerobic capacities <b>and</b> heart <b>rates</b> for the Mexican American young adults based on sub-maximal treadmill exercise testing. (2) To test the relationships between Heart <b>Rate,</b> Oxygen Consumption <b>and</b> <b>Rating</b> <b>of</b> perceived exertion. (3) To compare values of volumetric oxygen consumption, heart <b>rates</b> <b>and</b> <b>rating</b> <b>of</b> perceived exertion for Mexican American young adults, with published values of oxygen consumption, heart <b>rates</b> <b>and</b> <b>rating</b> <b>of</b> perceived exertion with other population groups and to test if these values are significantly different.

5|$|Though it had {{operated}} {{mainly as}} a ground-attack unit with its Mustangs, No.77 Squadron's primary {{role in the}} RAAF was interception, and {{it was hoped that}} with the Meteor it could again focus on fighter duties, particularly as the USAF had only two squadrons of Sabres in Korea. Cresswell therefore arranged for the USAF to lend him a Sabre to simulate a MiG-15 in combat training with the Meteors at Iwakuni; he determined that the Meteor's manoeuvrability <b>and</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> climb allowed it to match the swept-wing jet below , so that the best air-to-air tactic would be to work in concert with USAF Sabres operating at high level while the Australians flew at lower altitudes. On 20July, No.77 Squadron began moving to Kimpo, South Korea, where it was tasked by the USAF's 4th Fighter-Interceptor Wing.|$|E
5|$|Various {{morphological}} {{features of}} galaxies can affect {{their potential for}} habitability. Spiral arms, for example, are the location of star formation, but they contain numerous giant molecular clouds and a high density of stars that can perturb a star's Oort cloud, sending avalanches of comets and asteroids toward any planets further in. In addition, the high density of stars <b>and</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> massive star formation can expose any stars orbiting within the spiral arms for too long to supernova explosions, reducing their prospects for the survival and development of life. Considering these factors, the Sun is advantageously placed within the galaxy because, {{in addition to being}} outside a spiral arm, it orbits near the corotation radius, maximizing the interval between spiral-arm crossings.|$|E
5|$|Climate can {{influence}} bat distribution, movements and biogeography, access to food resources, timing of reproduction and emergence <b>and</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> energy expenditure. In {{combination with other}} factors, including ongoing loss and degradation of habitat, global climate change or global warming presents a serious and increasing threat to bats and other fauna. The affinity of the bristle-faced free-tailed bat for riparian zones in arid and semi-arid environments renders it potentially vulnerable {{to the effects of}} water stress and extreme weather events. Ecological factors that qualify the bristle-faced free-tailed bat as being at increased risk of the potential impacts of global climate change include habitat (species that rely on riparian habitats in water stress prone environments), foraging type (aerial hawking insectivore), roost type (tree hollow specialist), biogeography (species with limited dispersal ability, limited ranging behaviour) and extreme weather (species that occur in regions where there is an increasing risk of extreme temperature events or changes in rainfall patterns).|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Patricia set {{multiple}} {{records for}} maximum strength, rate of intensification, <b>and</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> weakening throughout its relatively short existence. With maximum sustained winds of 215mph (345km/h) and a minimum pressure of 872mbar (hPa; 25.75inHg), Patricia {{is the most}} intense tropical cyclone ever observed in the Western Hemisphere. In terms of central pressure, {{it is also the}} second-most intense tropical cyclone ever recorded worldwide, just shy of Typhoon Tip in 1979 which had a minimum pressure of 870mbar (hPa; 25.69inHg). Patricia's one-minute maximum sustained winds ranked as the highest ever reliably observed or estimated in a tropical cyclone, surpassing Typhoon Haiyan of 2013. The magnitude of Patricia's rapid intensification is among the fastest ever observed. In a 24-hour period, 06:00–06:00UTC October22–23, its maximum sustained winds increased from 85mph (140km/h) to 205mph (335km/h), a record increase of 120mph (195km/h). During the same period, Patricia's central pressure fell by 95mbar (hPa; 2.81inHg). Despite record over-water weakening prior to striking Mexico, Patricia became the most intense Pacific hurricane to make landfall, with a pressure of 932mbar (hPa; 27.52inHg).|$|E
