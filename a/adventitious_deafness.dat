40|$|This study {{explored}} {{the psychological and}} social impact of <b>adventitious</b> <b>deafness,</b> and the rehabilitation services that were offered to individuals who acquired this condition in adulthood. Qualitative {{interviews were conducted with}} a sample of eight deafened adults, who were recruited from across Ontario. The results show that medical interventions (e. g., audiometric testing, hearing aid provision, and cochlear implantation) were relied on exclusively as a rehabilitation approach in providing care to deafened people. None of the study participants were offered individual, family, or group counselling by their hearing health service providers. This lack of attention to the socio-emotional needs of the participants occurred despite the obvious negative impact of deafness, including family problems and social isolation and neglect. This gap in service makes it apparent that the rehabilitation system for <b>adventitious</b> <b>deafness</b> needs the involvement of counsellors and social workers to reduce the negative impact on individuals and families...|$|E
30|$|There are {{two models}} related to deafness, a medical and a {{cultural}} one (Nunes 2006). The medical perspective distinguishes congenital deafness from <b>adventitious</b> <b>deafness,</b> {{which refers to}} hearing loss acquired at birth or later in life (Braden 1994; Turkington and Sussman 2004). From a psychological perspective, this distinction is made between prelingual and postlingual deafness (Braden 1994). The prelingual stage includes the time period prior to the acquisition of spoken language, although this period is not well defined {{due to differences in}} normal language development among children (Braden 1994). These individuals are often unable to develop intelligible speech (Schein 1989). People who become deaf after the development of normal speech are considered postlingually deaf and a distinction can be made between childhood deafness (age onset before adolescence), prevocational deafness (onset before nineteen), adult onset and elderly onset (Schein 1989). Postlingual deafness is often experienced as psychologically traumatic and may result in various interpersonal and work-related problems (Raifman and Vernon 1996). The medical model tends to view deafness as a disability or impairment that needs to be fixed (Lane et al. 1996) and so various devices have been created, including hearing aids, cochlear implants, speech therapy and oral education, in order to facilitate the integration of deaf people in our society (Austen and Coleman 2004).|$|E
