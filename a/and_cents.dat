5|$|Few nickels had {{circulated}} {{in the western}} states before the 1880s (people there preferred silver and gold coins); interest in the new Liberty Head design had led to increasing use of nickels there. Good economic conditions and high demand for nickels for use in coin-operated devices caused the piece to circulate throughout the nation by 1900. That year, Mint Director George E. Roberts called on Congress to quintuple the Mint's appropriation to purchase base metals for striking into nickels <b>and</b> <b>cents.</b> At the time, statutory restrictions permitted production of cents and nickels only at Philadelphia; Roberts' request that Congress allow striking at the other mints was granted in 1906. The Denver and San Francisco Mints began striking nickels in 1912.|$|E

25|$|The West Point {{branch is}} the newest mint facility, gaining {{official}} status as a branch mint in 1988. Its predecessor, the West Point Bullion Depository, was opened in 1937, <b>and</b> <b>cents</b> were produced there from 1973 to 1986. Along with these, which were identical to those produced at Philadelphia, West Point has struck {{a great deal of}} commemorative and proof coinage bearing the W mint mark. In 1996, West Point produced clad dimes, but for collectors, not for circulation. The West Point facility is still used for storage of part of the United States' gold bullion reserves, and West Point is now the United States' production facility for gold, silver and platinum American Eagle coins.|$|E
50|$|In 1962, coins were {{introduced}} bearing the name Suriname {{for the first}} time. These were in denominations of 1, 5, 10 <b>and</b> 25 <b>cents</b> <b>and</b> 1 guilder. The 1 cent was bronze, the 5 cent nickel-brass, the 10 <b>and</b> 25 <b>cents</b> were cupro-nickel <b>and</b> the 1 guilder was silver. Aluminium 1 <b>and</b> 5 <b>cent</b> coins {{were introduced}} in 1974 and 1976.

500|$|In 1917, a year {{which saw}} Barber's death in office at age 77, the wartime economy caused a {{shortage}} of cents. [...] At this time, the Lincoln cent had not yet become dominant in circulation; four-fifths of the cents in circulation were of the older Indian Head design. [...] Demand for the cent continued to increase when a luxury tax was instituted, <b>and</b> <b>cents</b> were needed to make change.

500|$|The turn of {{the century}} saw {{unprecedented}} demand for nickels, due to a booming economy and the use of nickels in coin-operated machines. [...] In 1900, Mint Director George E. Roberts called on Congress to grant the Mint a larger appropriation to purchase base metals, allowing for greater production of nickels <b>and</b> <b>cents.</b> [...] The same year, the design was modified slightly, lengthening some of the leaves on the reverse. [...] This change occurred with the introduction of a new hub, from which coining dies were made. [...] Demand for the coins remained heavy; in March 1911, Mehl's Numismatic Monthly reported that the Mint was working twenty-four hours a day to produce cents and nickels, and even so was failing to satisfy demand.|$|E
500|$|The formal {{titles of}} the {{currency}} are euro for the major unit and cent for the minor (one hundredth) unit and for official use in most eurozone languages; according to the ECB, all languages should use the same spelling for the nominative singular. This may contradict normal rules for word formation in some languages, e.g., those {{where there is no}} eu diphthong. Bulgaria has negotiated an exception; euro in the Bulgarian Cyrillic alphabet is spelled as eвро (evro) and not eуро (euro) in all official documents. In the Greek script the term ευρώ (evró) is used; the Greek [...] "cent" [...] coins are denominated in λεπτό/ά (leptó/á). Official practice for English-language EU legislation is to use the words euro and cent as both singular and plural, although the European Commission's Directorate-General for Translation states that the plural forms euros <b>and</b> <b>cents</b> should be used in English.|$|E

Early in his writing career, he received an award from the American Baptist Convention for [...] "skillfully writing Christian truth and the application of Christian principles into commercial, dramatic TV scripts". For several years, he corresponded with John M. Gunn of the National Council of Churches regarding the application of Christian teachings in television series. However, Gunn stopped replying after Roddenberry wrote in a letter: [...] "But you must understand that I am a complete pagan, and consume enormous amounts of bread, having found the Word more spice than nourishment, so I am interested in a statement couched in dollars <b>and</b> <b>cents</b> of what this means to the Roddenberry treasury." ...|$|E
