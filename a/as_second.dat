40|$|The {{acquisition}} {{and development of}} Swedish <b>as</b> a <b>second</b> language is still a young area of research and education that has had both a practical and a theoretical motivation. It has helped teachers to understand the factors that determine whether instruction is successful and it has helped researchers to explore {{a number of issues}} of importance for theory building, in particular the relationship between the linguistic environment and the learner’s cognitive activity. In order to report on this vast area of research, we have formulated the following questions that have worked as a frame of reference for the information presented in this overview: What are the topics and research perspectives in the area of {{acquisition and}} development of Swedish <b>as</b> a <b>second</b> language? Which are the main organizations in the area of education of Swedish <b>as</b> a <b>second</b> language in Sweden? What is the available computer support for learning Swedish <b>as</b> a <b>second</b> language? What do we know about research on Swedish learner corpora? Having these questions as a background we organized the overview into four parts: 1. Research in the area of acquisition and development of Swedish <b>as</b> a <b>second</b> language 2. Education in Swedish <b>as</b> a <b>second</b> language 3. Computer-assisted language learning in Swedish <b>as</b> a <b>second</b> language and 4.

5|$|A B {{movie or}} B {{film is a}} low-budget {{commercial}} movie, but one {{that is not an}} arthouse film. In its original usage, during the Golden Age of Hollywood, the term more precisely identified films intended for distribution as the less-publicized bottom half of a double feature (akin to B-sides for recorded music). Although the U.S. production of movies intended <b>as</b> <b>second</b> features largely ceased {{by the end of the}} 1950s, the term B movie continues to be used in its broader sense to this day. In its post–Golden Age usage, there is ambiguity on both sides of the definition: on the one hand, the primary interest of many inexpensive exploitation films is prurient; on the other, many B movies display a high degree of craft and aesthetic ingenuity.|$|E
5|$|Ambulances {{often have}} two manufacturers. The first is {{frequently}} {{a manufacturer of}} light trucks or full-size vans (or previously, cars) such as Mercedes-Benz, Nissan, Toyota, or Ford. The second manufacturer (known <b>as</b> <b>second</b> stage manufacturer) purchases the vehicle (which is sometimes purchased incomplete, having no body or interior behind the driver's seat) and turns it into an ambulance by adding bodywork, emergency vehicle equipment, and interior fittings. This is done by one of two methods – either coachbuilding, where the modifications are started from scratch and built on to the vehicle, or using a modular system, where a pre-built 'box' is put on to the empty chassis of the ambulance, and then finished off.|$|E
