5|$|Historian Carl Sferrazza Anthony {{noted that}} {{ordinary}} citizens responded to Nixon. When {{a group of}} rural people visited the White House to present <b>a</b> <b>quilt</b> to the First Lady, many were overcome with nervousness; upon hearing their weeping, Pat hugged each individual tightly, and the tension dissipated. When a young boy doubted that the Executive Mansion was her house {{because he could not}} see the washing machine, Pat led him through the halls and up an elevator, into the family quarters and the laundry room. She mixed well with people of different races, and made no distinctions on that basis. During the Nixons' trip to China in 1972, foreign minister Zhou En-lai was suffienciently smitten with her so as to give two rare giant pandas to the ambassador as a gift from China.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} the success of the tour, the band was not without at least one serious altercation which has since been widely publicized. After playing a {{sell-out}} show in Glasgow, Scotland, members of the band and crew were involved in heavy drinking. After a brief amount of time, vocalist Randy Blythe, whilst wearing <b>a</b> <b>quilt</b> and attempting to speak with a Scottish accent, became verbally violent towards both drummer Chris Adler and guitarist Mark Morton, the later of whom then struck Blythe from behind on the bus in response. The incident developed into grabbing, pushing and separating until Blythe and Morton then encountered each other outside on the footpath. The fight between the two was especially lackluster due to intoxication, however it resulted in Morton bringing Blythe down hard on the pavement beneath him briefly incapacitating Blythe. Two days and at least one show later, the duo reconciled over drinks.|$|E

25|$|The top-most {{layer of}} <b>a</b> <b>quilt</b> is usually made from cotton {{quilting}} fabric.

25|$|Once {{the layers}} have been quilted, the edges must be {{finished}} and bound. There {{are many different}} ways to bind <b>a</b> <b>quilt.</b> One of the simplest involves sewing {{one side of a}} strip of fabric to the front side of the quilt, through all of the layers of fabric, then folding the strip over to {{the back side of the}} fabric and hand stitching the binding closed.|$|E

25|$|When making <b>a</b> <b>quilt</b> it is {{important}} to mark the fabric that you are cutting in order {{to have some kind of}} guidance when cutting the fabric, or you could use a quilting ruler and rotary cutter.

Some critics according to The Daily Telegraph considered the work to be a symbol for violence and rape.|$|E

25|$|Quilts {{can have}} many {{different}} templates or patterns {{and they can}} have a large impact on the final result.

If used properly it can help quilters produce <b>a</b> <b>quilt</b> of their liking and give them a sense of satisfaction and vision for future quilts they want to make.|$|E
25|$|Inside, Ruetten found Rasmussen dead on {{the living}} room floor, shot three times. There were signs of a struggle, such as a {{porcelain}} vase that had apparently been broken over Rasmussen's head prior to the shooting, a bloody handprint next to the burglar alarm's panic button, and a toppled credenza. It appeared that someone had bound her wrists, or tried to, at some point. She had defensive wounds and bore a bruise on her face that appeared to have been inflicted by the muzzle of a gun. The gun had been fired through <b>a</b> <b>quilt,</b> apparently to muffle the sound. The investigating criminalist also observed a bite mark on Rasmussen's arm, and took a swab from it.|$|E
25|$|Within a few years, the {{campaign}} had gotten all five remaining Catskill fire towers {{listed on the}} Forest Fire Lookout Association's Historic Lookout Register and later the NRHP. State grants matched by money raised through local efforts such as bake sales, dances, fundraising drives, raffling of <b>a</b> <b>quilt</b> and T-shirt sales raised enough money to begin restoring the tower and cabin in 1998. Volunteers from the New York–New Jersey Trail Conference extended the path from the tower to the spring into a trail that would remain within state land down the mountain's never-logged northwestern slope to a new trailhead, avoiding the closed road. When all these efforts were complete, in 2000, the Red Hill tower became {{the first of the}} restored Catskill fire towers to be reopened to the public.|$|E
