40|$|To {{rationalize}} {{the relatively}} high investment that industrial automation systems entail, {{research in the field}} of intelligent machines should target high value functions such as fettling, die-finishing, deburring, and fixtureless manufacturing. For achieving this goal, past work has concentrated on force control algorithms at the system level with limited focus on performance expansion at the <b>actuator</b> <b>level.</b> We present a comprehensive literature review on robot force control, including algorithms, specialized actuators, and robot control software. A robot force control testbed was developed using Schunk's PowerCube 6 -DOF Arm and a six-axis ATI force/torque sensor. Using parameter identification experiments, manipulator module inertias and the motor torque constant were estimated. Experiments were conducted to study the practical issues involved in implementing stable contact transitions and programmable endpoint impedance. Applications to human augmentation, virtual fixtures, and teleoperation are discussed. These experiments are used as a vehicle to understand the performance improvement achievable at the <b>actuator</b> <b>level.</b> The approach at UTRRG has been to maximize the choices within the actuator to enhance its intelligence. Drawing on this 20 -year research history in electromechanical actuator architecture, we propose a new concept that mixes two inputs, distinct in their velocity ratios, within the same dual actuator called a Force/Motion Actuator (FMA). Detailed kinematic and dynamic models of this dual actuator are developed. The actuator performance is evaluated using simulations with an output velocity specification and resolving input trajectories using a minimum-norm solution. It is shown that a design choice of 14 : 1 motion scaling between the two inputs results in good sensitivity to output force disturbances without compromising velocity tracking performance.

Two examples reveal that, to extend a behaviour-based architecture by equipping it with additional reactive algorithms, the arbitration, otherwise action selection, problem has to be redefined {{in terms of the}} interaction laws of the algorithms involved. The principles of modularisation and compositionality are proposed as necessary guidelines for reconfigurability. Modularisation refers to the separation of the algorithms from the action selection components and compositionality expresses the concern for modelling the interactions between individual activities. This way, two composition levels are necessary: one at the individual task arousal system and one at the <b>actuators</b> <b>level.</b> For a task considered, the right behavioural grain of activity is the one that minimises those compositionality needs. 1.

However, the development of novel robotic devices open issues on how to generalize the outcomes to different architectures. In this chapter, we describe a mapping strategy to transfer human hand synergies onto robotic hands with dissimilar kinematics. The algorithm is based on the definition of two virtual objects that are used to abstract from the specific structures of the hands. The proposed mapping strategy allows to overcame the problems in defining synergies for robotic hands computing PCA analysis over a grasp dataset obtained empirically closing the robot hand upon different objects.

The present level of electromechanical actuation is considered with {{discussion of the}} factors affecting more widespread use. Two rather different electromechanical actuators are presented for commercial aircraft; DEAWS electrical flap actuation and ELGEAR nose wheel steering. Both projects are industrially driven with specifications based on existing medium-sized commercial aircraft. Methods comparing fault tolerant electric drive topologies for electrical actuators are presented, showing two different categories of electric drive and comparing each category {{in a variety of}} operating conditions to assess size and component count. The safety-driven design process for electromechanical actuators is discussed with reliability calculations presented for both proposed actuators, showing where fault tolerant design is required to meet safety requirements. The selection of an optimum fault tolerant electric drive for each actuator is discussed and fault tolerant control schemes are presented. The development of the electric flap and nose wheel steering systems is described, with the focus on the work performed by the author, primarily on the power electronic converters and control software. A comprehensive range of laboratory and industrial results are given for both actuators, showing demonstrations of fault tolerance at power converter and <b>actuator</b> <b>levels.</b> Following testing, further analysis is given on various issues arising prior and during testing of both converters, with design considerations for future electromechanical actuators.

40|$|The thesis {{concerns}} the theoretical development and implemantation of sliding mode schemes for fault tolerant control. The theoretical ideas {{developed in the}} thesis have been applied to aerospace systems. In particular, actuator and sensor fault tolerant control schemes {{have been developed for}} a high fidelity full nonlinear model of a Boeing 747 aircraft which is a widely researched testbed in the open literature. A key development in this thesis considers sliding mode control allocation schemes for fault tolerant control based on integral action and a model reference framework. Unlike many control allocation schemes in the literature, one of the main contributions of this thesis is the use of <b>actuator</b> effectiveness <b>levels</b> to redistribute the control signals to the remaining healthy actuators when faults/failures occur. A rigorous stability analysis and design procedure is developed from a theoretical perspective for this scheme. A fixed control allocation structure is also rigorously analyzed in the situation when information on <b>actuator</b> effectiveness <b>level</b> is not available. The proposed scheme shows that faults and even certain total actuator failures can be handled directly without reconfiguring the controller. A design of an adaptive gain for the nonlinear component of the sliding mode controller for handling faults is also described. The later chapters of the thesis present the results obtained from real time hardware implementations of the controllers on the 6 -DOF SIMONA flight simulator at Delft University of Technology as part of the GARTEUR AG 16 programme. The schemes have been evaluated by experienced pilots and the results have shown good performance in both nominal and failure scenarios. A reconstruction of the Bijlmermeer ELAL 1862 scenario on SIMONA using one of the controllers shows that a safe flight and landing is possible with significant reduction in pilot workload when compared with the classical controller.

The activity is developed via both experiments and simulations, using a primary flight actuator of a modern fly-by-wire jet trainer as reference hardware. A dedicated experimental set-up is arranged, by integrating a thermal chamber with a realtime actuator control system developed in the MATLAB-Simulink-xPC Target environment, and an extensive test campaign is performed on the actuator in environmental control conditions. In particular, both the static and the dynamic performances are concerned, characterizing the valve threshold, the valve motor gain, the open-loop, and closed-loop frequency responses. The tests are performed at ambient, extreme hot (71 C), cold (220 C), and extreme cold (240 C) temperatures.

Its main innovative features are: lightness, real safety guaranteed by its structural elasticity, smoothness and easiness of movements. The kinematic {{behavior of the}} system hand-plusrehabilitation- device is analyzed. The device applicability is confirmed by positive testing. Cerebrovascular diseases are the third cause of mortality and the second cause of long term disability in Western countries. The 60 % of survived individuals shows a sensitive/motor deficit of one or both hands and must be subjected to a rehabilitative treatment to recover {{the use of the}} upper limb. Recent technologies have facilitated the use of robots as assistive tools to patients, providing safe and highly personalized rehabilitation sessions, thus making therapist contribution to recovery much more intensive and effective. We propose in this work a wearable glove with an incorporated compliant mechanical transmission over the hand. The glove is composed by two main modules with welldefined mechanical characteristics. One is the actuator on the upper side of the forearm, close to the wrist (and to the impaired hand) and still separated from it; the other (the transmission) is composed by several elastic transmissions which, moved by the actuator, properly transmit displacements, speed and forces to one or more impaired fingers during a rehabilitation session. While the actuator module has a rigid and defined structure and is fixed to the forearm section of the glove, the "transmission" module has in fact a labile and extended structure as it has to reach all five fingers (one, some, or all might be impaired and in need of rehabilitation) up to their tips and move them in an effective and reliable way.

Our design is based on contactless force actuators made by permanent magnets glued {{on the back of the}} deformable mirror and coils mounted on a stiff reference structure. We use capacitive sensors to close a position loop co-located with each actuator. Dedicated high performance parallel processors are used to implement the local de-centralized control at <b>actuator</b> <b>level</b> and a centralized feed-forward computation of all the actuators forces. This allowed achieving in our previous systems dynamic performances well in line with the requirements of the M 4 Adaptive Unit (M 4 AU) case. The actuator density of our design is in the order of 30 -mm spacing for a figure of about 6000 actuators on the M 4 AU and it allows fulfilling the fitting error and corrections requirements of the E-ELT high order DM. Moreover, our contact-less technology makes the Deformable Mirror tolerant to up 5 % actuators failures without spoiling system capability to reach its specified performances, besides allowing large mechanical tolerances between the reference structure and the deformable mirror.

40|$|Road traffic {{statistics}} have shown multi-event crashes typically result in higher fatalities and injuries than single-event crashes do, especially when the initial harmful event leads {{to a loss of}} vehicle directional control and causes secondary collisions. In this work, the topic of stabilization control for vehicles involved in light vehicle-to-vehicle impacts is addressed. A post-impact stability control (PISC) system is developed to attenuate undesired vehicle motions (spin-out, skid, rollover) induced by the initial impacts, so that subsequent crashes can be avoided or mitigated. First a vehicle collision model is developed to characterize vehicle motions due to the light impact, which is based on an assumption of substantial changes of kinematic states but minor structural deformations. Colliding vehicles are modeled as rigid bodies with four degrees of freedom, and the influences of tire forces are taken into consideration to improve the prediction accuracy of collision consequences. Then a collision sensing/validation scheme is developed to detect impulsive disturbances and trigger the activation of PISC. The vehicle responses to the impulse are predicted and used to compare with subsequent measurements for collision confirmation. The stabilization controller, which is derived from the multiple sliding surface control approach, regulates the disturbed vehicle motions via differential braking/active steering. The system effectiveness is verified through CarSim/Simulink simulations for angled rear-ends collisions. When compared with the performance of existing electronic stability control (ESC) systems and four-wheel braking approach, PISC demonstrates improved capability to reject the collision disturbances and to assist the driver to regain control. For more integrated control of longitudinal/lateral/yaw/roll motions, a hierarchical control architecture for vehicle handling is proposed. It consists of three coordinated stages: the generation of virtual control commands through model predictive control, the generation of actual commands through constrained optimal allocation, and the tracking of wheel slips at the <b>actuator</b> <b>level.</b> This cascade modular design allows for better trade-off among various control objectives and explicit consideration of control input constraints at handling limits. This proposed active safety feature can be deemed as a functional extension to current ESC systems, and constitutes a complementary module towards a comprehensive vehicle safety system...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{contains}} {{an overview of}} a theoretical framework {{for the design of}} reliable multivariable control systems, with special emphasis on actuator failures and necessary <b>actuator</b> redundancy <b>levels.</b> Using a linear model of the system, with Markovian failure probabilities and quadratic performance index, an optimal stochastic control problem is posed and solved. The solution requires the iteration of a set of highly coupled Riccati-like matrix difference equations; if these converge one has a reliable design; if they diverge, the design is unreliable, and the system design cannot be stabilized. In addition, it is shown that the existence of a stabilizing constant feedback gain and the reliability of its implementation is equivalent to the convergence properties of a set of coupled Riccati-like matrix difference equations. In summary, these results can be used for offline studies relating the open loop dynamics, required performance, actuator mean time to failure, and functional or identical actuator redundancy, with and without feedback gain reconfiguration strategies...|$|R
40|$|The United States Department of Energy (DOE) Complexes perform {{numerous}} {{hazardous material}} handling operations {{within the confines}} of a glovebox. The DOE is continuing to seek more efficient and safer means of handling these materials inside gloveboxes rather than the conventional, labor-intensive method through lead lined gloves. The use of glovebox automation technology will also be critical to the DOE in its efforts to comply with its mandated ALARA principles in handling the hazardous materials associated with the cleanup process. Operations associated with materials processing in a glovebox are similar to many industrial tasks, but the unique glovebox environment and Plutonium material properties create a unique set of challenges for conventional automation machinery. Such properties include: Low to moderate levels of ionizing radiation, high abrasiveness, corrosiveness, pyrophoric tendencies, rapid dispersal and permeation of environment, diffuses quickly, and possible incompatible material interaction. The glovebox presents the following challenges: existing gloveboxes may not be readily altered or even modified at all, complex mechanical operations for maintenance and repair are difficult or impossible through gloves, failed equipment may not be removed easily or at all. If a broken piece of equipment cannot be bagged-out through a glove port (approximately 216 mm (8 1 / 2 inch) diameter) it must remain in place. Broken equipment obstructs further operations. If it renders the entire glovebox unusable, a significant volume of waste is generated and an expensive system must be disposed of and replaced. A moderate sized glovebox alone costs between $ 250, 000 and $ 500, 000 and an equipment malfunction, which penetrates the glovebox and exposes the room to Plutonium or other toxic materials, is catastrophic. In addition to the human exposure issues, cleanup can easily run into the millions of dollars. A solution to the issues described above is ARM Automation Inc. 's (ARM) modular robotic manipulator technology developed for DOE EM operations, which addresses many of the issues discussed in the previous section. This manipulator system has the capability of custom configurations, which accommodate common glovebox tasks such as materials repackaging. The modular nature and quick connects of this system simplify installations into ''hot'' boxes and any potential modifications or repair therein. In the field of automation and robotics, a very common element is one used to generate motion for precise positioning of loads. One example of such an automation component would be an individual joint within an industrial robotic manipulator. This component consists of a tightly integrated package containing an electric motor, gear train, output support bearings, position sensors, brake, servo-amplifier and communications controller. Within the context of this paper, this key building block is referred to as an actuator module. With regard {{to the needs of the}} EM, [8] and [9] have shown that while each focus area has unique requirements for robotic automation at a system or manipulator level, their requirements at the <b>actuator</b> <b>level</b> are very similar. Thereby, a modular approach to automation which utilizes a small set of versatile actuator modules can be used to construct a broad range of robotic systems and automation cells suited to EM applications.

SystemC is emerging as a de facto standard for digital system design, but is still lacking a standard support of continuous-time and mixed discrete-event/continuous-time systems. This paper presents the first elements of extensions to SystemC, called SystemC-AMS, that are proposed to fill the gap. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{study is}} a next part of earlier works by the authors, and explores how does the {{sequence}} of activated <b>actuators</b> and the <b>level</b> of applied voltage affect the radiated acoustic energy. The analysis uses the finite element method for structural vibrations and combination of the finite element and the intensity hybrid method to assess the level of sound radiation. The vibrating element is a steel plate with glued on actuators, supported on one edge and excited by a harmonically variable, concentrated load with a constant amplitude value. PACS numbers: 43. 20.
