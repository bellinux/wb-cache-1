25|$|<b>Advanced</b> <b>Passenger</b> <b>Train</b> (APT) - Tilting trains {{which never}} entered into regular revenue-earning service.|$|E
25|$|After the Leyland Motor Corporation takeover, the Rover Gas Turbine {{was used}} {{in a number of}} Leyland trucks, {{including}} one shown at the 1968 Commercial Motor Show. Rover gas turbines also powered the first <b>Advanced</b> <b>Passenger</b> <b>Train.</b>|$|E
25|$|The British Rail APT-E, {{prototype}} of the <b>Advanced</b> <b>Passenger</b> <b>Train,</b> was turbine-powered. Like the French TGV, later models were electric instead. This choice was made because British Leyland, the turbine supplier, ceased production of the model used in the APT-E.|$|E
25|$|Initial {{experience}} with the <b>Advanced</b> <b>Passenger</b> <b>Trains</b> was good. They had a high power-to-weight ratio to enable rapid acceleration; the prototype set record speeds on the Great Western Main Line and the Midland Main Line, and the production versions vastly reduced journey times on the WCML. The APT was, however, beset with technical problems; financial constraints and negative media coverage eventually caused the project to be cancelled.|$|R
50|$|The Pendolino {{project was}} started in the 1970s by FIAT Ferroviaria, but also absorbed {{technology}} from tilting train experiments from elsewhere, most notably the British <b>Advanced</b> <b>Passenger</b> <b>Trains,</b> FIAT having bought the patents. Development included a number of prototypes, the last {{of which was the}} ETR 401. This prototype was followed by the ETR 450 series units. The first train entered service on between Rome and Milan in 1988.|$|R
30|$|This {{means that}} freight train to freight train {{separation}} must be 8  min or more, <b>passenger</b> <b>trains</b> must leave at least 5  min {{in advance of}} freight trains and freight trains must leave at least 5  min in <b>advance</b> of <b>passenger</b> <b>trains.</b>|$|R
25|$|British Rail's {{proposal}} in the 1970s and 80s {{to introduce the}} <b>Advanced</b> <b>Passenger</b> <b>Train</b> APT project failed commercially. However this train proved that London-Glasgow WCML journey times of less than 4 hours were achieveable and {{paved the way for}} the later tilting Virgin Pendolino trains.|$|E
25|$|However, the {{aim for the}} <b>Advanced</b> <b>Passenger</b> <b>Train</b> was {{to achieve}} 155mph (250km/h) running. Although this was {{achieved}} during trials, even then, it has still not been possible, in normal service, in the UK, apart from the dedicated CTRL, due to the shortness of British signal spacing.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Advanced</b> <b>Passenger</b> <b>Train</b> (APT) was an {{experimental}} tilting high speed train developed by British Rail during the 1970s and early 1980s, {{for use on}} the West Coast Main Line, which contained a lot of curves. Notable among numerous technical advancements was the active tilting system, which the APT pioneered and has since appeared on other designs around the world.|$|E
50|$|In 1985, a new {{generation}} of <b>advanced</b> suburban <b>passenger</b> <b>train</b> was being considered by the State Rail Authority. There was a delay in the construction of these trains, and 56 interim stainless steel air conditioned cars, C3581-3608 and T4247-4274, were built by Goninan, known as the 'Chopper Cars' for their chopper control. These cars trialled several features of the next generation cars, such as fixed seating, door chimes and passenger address systems. They were originally fitted with a push-button feature, to enable passengers to open the doors manually, but this feature was short-lived. They retained the flat ends of the previous Goninan cars, but {{with the addition of a}} fibreglass moulded end piece which was originally white with orange and red stripes (the 'candy' State Rail livery). These ends were later painted grey with a lower yellow section which they retain to this day, and internally the standard grey livery and blue seat upholstery was applied. These cars continue to operate as C sets.|$|R
50|$|One <b>passenger</b> <b>train</b> runs between Jasidih Junction and Dumka. One train {{runs from}} Jasidih {{junction}} to Banka via Deoghar, Chandan, Katoria from June 2016.One <b>passenger</b> <b>train</b> runs between Jasidih Junction and Barapalasi via Dumka Junction from 10 February 2014. The <b>Passenger</b> <b>train</b> service between Jasidih to Ambajora Sikaripara started on 30 June 2014 via Dumka railway station. The <b>Passenger</b> <b>train</b> service between Dumka to Rampurhat started on 4 June 2015 when a <b>passenger</b> <b>train</b> started operating from Dumka to Rampurhat. The <b>Passenger</b> <b>train</b> service between Dumka to Bhagalpur started on 28 September 2016 when a <b>passenger</b> <b>train</b> started operating from Hansdiha to Dumka.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} research {{consisting of}} experiments {{and analysis of}} fire development in a <b>passenger</b> <b>train</b> carriage. The aim {{of this research is}} to use experiments, particularly a full-scale <b>passenger</b> <b>train</b> fire experiment, to increase understanding of fire behaviour in <b>passenger</b> <b>trains</b> and evaluate existing design fire estimation methods applied to <b>passenger</b> <b>trains...</b>|$|R
25|$|British Rail also attended, {{bringing}} {{with them a}} full-sized mockup of the <b>Advanced</b> <b>Passenger</b> <b>Train,</b> at that point still powered by a gas turbine before its conversion to electric power. In {{another part of the}} British pavilion was a display by Tracked Hovercraft, which was starting tests on its track near Cambridge that year. The French exhibit included both the Aerotrain and recent developments of SNCFs high-speed efforts, which would emerge as the TGV.|$|E
25|$|The {{origins of}} the InterCity 125 are steeped in irony, because it was planned as a stop-gap. Research had begun for the tilting <b>Advanced</b> <b>Passenger</b> <b>Train</b> (APT) {{but it was not}} {{possible}} to predict when it could enter service. The HST would apply what had been learned so far to traditional technology - a parallel project based on conventional principles but incorporating the newly discovered knowledge of wheel/rail interaction and suspension design. Although the APT never achieved all its design objectives the InterCity 125 was an outstanding success.|$|E
25|$|The 1970s saw British Rail {{successfully}} introduce {{high speed}} diesel train services, as well as major resignalling projects designed to increase operational efficiency. In 1976, the InterCity 125 High Speed Train (HST) was introduced on some services and the InterCity brand was adopted. This created an increase in passengers using the railways and improved British Rail's finances. British Rail also started development of the world's first tilting train – the <b>Advanced</b> <b>Passenger</b> <b>Train</b> (APT). However, lack of money, political pressure and {{the launch of the}} prototype into passenger service before technical problems were fully overcome lead to the project being cancelled in the early 1980s.|$|E
50|$|The depot {{closed to}} the public in 1967 {{following}} the discontinuance of the last <b>passenger</b> <b>trains</b> serving Oklahoma City. Frisco <b>passenger</b> <b>train</b> service ended in May 1967 and Rock Island <b>passenger</b> <b>train</b> service ended in November 1967.|$|R

5000|$|By 1858 {{the public}} {{timetable}} showed 7 weekday and 3 Sunday <b>passenger</b> <b>trains</b> each way, and by 1868 the service timetable showed 7 <b>passenger</b> <b>trains</b> and a goods trains every weekday, and on Sundays 4 <b>passenger</b> <b>trains</b> each way ...|$|R
25|$|The {{introduction}} {{into service}} of the <b>Advanced</b> <b>Passenger</b> <b>Train</b> {{was to be a}} three-stage project. Phase 1, the development of an experimental APT (APT-E), was completed. The APT-E used a gas turbine-electric locomotive, the only multiple unit so powered that was used by British Rail. It was formed of two power cars (numbers PC1 and PC2), initially with nothing between them and later, two trailer cars (TC1 and TC2). The cars were made of aluminium to reduce the weight of the unit and were articulated. The use of a gas turbine was dropped from development, due to excessive noise of the turbine and the high fuel costs of the late 1970s. The APT-E first ran on 25 July 1971. The train drivers' union, ASLEF black-listed the train due to the use of a single driver. The train was moved to the works at Derby (with the aid of a locomotive inspector). This triggered a one-day strike by ASLEF that cost BR more than the research budget for the entire year.|$|E
2500|$|On 30 July 2003, on {{the opening}} press run of the Channel Tunnel Rail Link Section 1, 373313 + 373314 {{established}} a new British rail speed record of , breaking the previous record of [...] set by an <b>Advanced</b> <b>Passenger</b> <b>Train</b> on 20 December 1979.|$|E
2500|$|British Rail {{developed}} the world's first tilting train – The <b>Advanced</b> <b>Passenger</b> <b>Train</b> (APT). [...] The {{object of the}} tilt was to minimise the discomfort to passengers caused by taking the curves of the West Coast Main Line at high speed. The APT also included hydrokinetic brakes, which enabled the train to stop from 150mph within existing signal spacings.|$|E
50|$|On 16 November 1979, a <b>passenger</b> <b>train</b> was {{run into}} by another <b>passenger</b> <b>train.</b> Thirty-six people were injured.|$|R
5|$|<b>Passenger</b> <b>trains</b> connect from Suvalki, Hrodno and Lithuania to Warsaw and {{the rest}} of the European {{passenger}} network. Passenger services are provided by two rail service providers, PKP Intercity that provides intercity <b>passengers</b> <b>trains</b> (express, intercity, eurocity, hotel and TLK) and Przewozy Regionalne that operates only regional <b>passenger</b> <b>trains</b> financed by the voivodeship. <b>Passenger</b> <b>trains</b> are mostly run using electrical multiple units (on electrified lines) or rail buses.|$|R
50|$|Only one <b>passenger</b> <b>train</b> {{passes through}} this line at present. Another <b>passenger</b> <b>train</b> was {{announced}} in Rail budget 2013.|$|R
2500|$|Pendolino (from Italian pendolo [...] "pendulum", and -ino, a {{diminutive}} suffix) is an Italian family of tilting trains used in Italy, Spain, Poland, Portugal, Slovenia, Finland, Russian Federation, the Czech Republic, the United Kingdom, Slovakia, Switzerland and China. Based {{on the design}} of the Italian ETR 401 and the British <b>Advanced</b> <b>Passenger</b> <b>Train,</b> it was further developed and manufactured by Fiat Ferroviaria, which was taken over by Alstom in 2000.|$|E
2500|$|In recent years, {{with the}} advent of fast trains, Wolverton gained notoriety among railwaymen for its famously tight curve. The curve was a result of the station being moved eastward in 1881, to permit {{extension}} of the Wolverton railway works. [...] The path of the original route is visible at both the north and south ends of the divergence. The <b>Advanced</b> <b>Passenger</b> <b>Train</b> failed its trials here but, with another decade of development, the new Virgin Trains Pendolino tilting trains passed theirs. [...] Near the station, the track crosses the valley of the Great Ouse on a viaduct. Slightly further north, the Northampton loop leaves the main line at Hanslope Junction.|$|E
2500|$|Following the {{introduction}} of the <b>Advanced</b> <b>Passenger</b> <b>Train</b> in 1983, a similar livery to the APT's (dark grey on the upper body, and light beige on the lower, with two stripes of red and white separating them) was experimentally applied to two HST sets and the coaches operating the Gatwick Express service between London Victoria and Gatwick Airport. This was referred to as the InterCity Executive livery as the sets used were dedicated to operating morning/evening services operated for businessmen. Despite the InterCity brand having been introduced in 1966, in 1985 the word 'Executive' was dropped and the livery was applied to all coaches and many locomotives used on InterCity services.|$|E

50|$|On 10 February 1946, a <b>passenger</b> <b>train</b> crashed at , Hertfordshire {{due to a}} signalman's error. The {{wreckage}} fouled signal cables, {{giving a}} false clear to an express <b>passenger</b> <b>train</b> which then ran into the wreckage. A third <b>passenger</b> <b>train</b> then collided with the wreckage. Two people were killed.|$|R
50|$|The CFOA {{operated}} many <b>passenger</b> <b>trains</b> {{on their}} lines. Their main line was between İstanbul and İzmit. The CFOA also operated the first <b>passenger</b> <b>train</b> between İstanbul and Ankara; {{this was a}} daily train that entered service in 1892. The most common steam locomotives for <b>passenger</b> <b>trains</b> were the class 33001.|$|R
2500|$|In {{the later}} 1950s and early 1960s, the British Transport Commission was modernising its rail network. [...] In particular, {{it wanted to}} {{increase}} intercity speeds, so that the railways could compete more effectively with the new motorways. [...] The government was unwilling to fund new railways, so the BTC focused its attention on increasing line speeds {{through the development of}} new trains and minor modifications to the existing infrastructure. A team of engineers was assembled at the Railway Technical Centre in Derby in the early 1960s, with the aim of designing and developing an <b>Advanced</b> <b>Passenger</b> <b>Train</b> (APT), that would be capable of at least [...] and incorporate many features not previously seen on British railways—such as tilting to allow higher speeds on curves.|$|E
2500|$|The InterCity 125 {{was planned}} as a stop gap measure, meant to fill until {{electrification}} was spread across all main {{lines and the}} <b>Advanced</b> <b>Passenger</b> <b>Train</b> (APT) was in service. Research had begun for the tilting train {{but it was not}} possible to predict when the APT would enter service. The HST applied what had been learned so far to traditional technology – a parallel project to the APT development, based on conventional principles but incorporating the newly discovered knowledge of wheel/rail interaction and suspension design. [...] The class holds the world record for diesel traction, achieving 148.4mph (238km/h) with a shortened set running speed trials between Darlington and York. Unlike the APT, the InterCity 125 was an outstanding success and is still in widespread use in [...]|$|E
2500|$|In the 1970s, British Rail {{began to}} explore new {{technologies}} for enabling high-speed passenger rail services in the UK. While the Japanese and French railway authorities had decided to build completely new tracks for their respective Shinkansen and TGV high-speed rail systems, British Rail opted instead to develop a train capable of running on existing rail infrastructure: the <b>Advanced</b> <b>Passenger</b> <b>Train</b> (APT), with {{a top speed of}} [...] An experimental version, the APT-E was tested between 1972 and 1976. It was equipped with a tilting mechanism which allowed the train to tilt into bends to reduce cornering forces on passengers, and was powered by gas turbines (the first to be used on British Rail since the Great Western Railway, and subsequent Western Region utilised Swiss built Brown-Boveri, and British built Metropolitan Vickers locomotives (18000 and 18100) in the early 1950s). The 1970s oil crisis prompted a rethink in the choice of motive power (as with the prototype TGV in France), and British Rail later opted for traditional electric overhead lines when the pre-production and production APTs were brought into service in 1980-86.|$|E
50|$|On 21 October 1974, {{locomotive}} B202 was hauling {{an empty}} <b>passenger</b> <b>train</b> when it ran away driverless from Connolly station and {{collided with a}} <b>passenger</b> <b>train</b> at , County Meath, A third <b>passenger</b> <b>train,</b> hauled by locomotive B219 {{was struck by the}} wrecked trains. Two people were killed and 29 were injured.|$|R
50|$|Then {{a design}} becomes {{focused on the}} {{behavior}} of doors, brakes, and passengers, and how those objects (doors, brakes, etc.) are related and behave within the <b>passenger</b> <b>train</b> domain. Other objects, that provide services used by the <b>passenger</b> <b>train</b> domain, are modeled in other domains connected to the <b>passenger</b> <b>train</b> domain.|$|R
50|$|On 19 January 1905, {{an express}} <b>passenger</b> <b>train</b> overran signals {{and was in}} {{collision}} with a <b>passenger</b> <b>train</b> at , Yorkshire. Seven people were killed.|$|R
