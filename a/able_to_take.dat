5|$|Despite the disappointment, the Commonwealth was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> {{advantage}} of the Russian weakness and through the territorial advances accomplished to reverse the eastern losses suffered in the earlier decades. In the Truce of Deulino of 1619 the Rzeczpospolita was granted the Smolensk, Chernihiv and Novhorod-Siverskyi regions.|$|E

50|$|One {{approach}} to routing {{involves the use}} of Dynamic Alternative Routing (DAR). DAR makes use of the distributed nature of a telecommunications network and its inherent randomness to dynamically determine optimal routing paths. This method generates a distributed, random, parallel computing platform that minimises congestion across the network, and is <b>able</b> <b>to</b> adapt <b>to</b> <b>take</b> changing traffic patterns and demands into account.|$|R
5|$|Regardless of {{the type}} of {{metabolic}} process they employ, the majority of bacteria are <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> in raw materials only in the form of relatively small molecules, which enter the cell by diffusion or through molecular channels in cell membranes. The Planctomycetes are the exception (as they are in possessing membranes around their nuclear material). It has recently been shown that Gemmata obscuriglobus is <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> in large molecules via a process that in some ways resembles endocytosis, the process used by eukaryotic cells to engulf external items.|$|E
5|$|A {{southern}} O-Bahn proposal {{attracted the}} most attention and {{has been the subject}} of various studies and Parliamentary Committees as to its viability since 1996. The rail route through Adelaide's far south is off-centre, without the large catchment area of a more central transport route. An O-Bahn running direct through the region would be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> advantage of an already large population and the continuing growth in the area.|$|E

Steph then had to face up to her father's departure after it was revealed he had a secret son. She refused to accepted her stepfather Jack Osborne (Jimmy McKenna) as a father figure.|$|E

Jackson went to the local grammar school, Peterborough County Grammar School for Girls from where she was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> apply <b>to</b> <b>take</b> physics at Imperial College in London. She was one of only two female students on the course alongside 88 males.|$|R
5|$|After calling at Belfast Lough {{in early}} April, Samuel Huntington {{made her way}} to Liverpool to join Convoy ON 181 to New York. Departing on 30 April as one of 48 {{merchant}} ships in the convoy, the liberty ship made port at New York on 17 May. The convoy reported no submarine activity, and about two-thirds of the convoy were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> target practice on icebergs during the voyage.|$|E
5|$|Antony was not <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> Phraaspa and besieged the city, but Artavasdes I and the Parthian {{commander}} Monaeses destroyed two {{legions of}} Antony's general, Oppius Statianus, who had slowly followed with the siege machines of the Antony's troops. Antony could not capture Phraaspa without these machines. Therefore, {{he had to}} withdraw to Armenia and Parthia was not invaded.|$|E

Mann was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> Miller down almost {{immediately}} in the fight and took a rear naked choke. Mann dominated from that point and soon after, transitioned to a triangle choke after just 53 seconds of the first round.|$|E

50|$|Missions {{have been}} altered to fit players' play style. Rather than players {{navigating}} through a linear level, levels have been redesigned {{to be more}} open, allowing players to explore the map and providing them with different ways to approach the mission. Players can now choose between a stealth approach and a combative, open approach to engage their enemies. Additionally, stealth based attacks have been improved since the previous entry, players are now <b>able</b> <b>to</b> silently <b>take</b> down enemies from a distance. Players are <b>able</b> <b>to</b> silently <b>take</b> down enemies from any surface the player is on, {{whether it be the}} ceiling, the wall or the ground. Players are also <b>able</b> <b>to</b> repel from their webs and perform inverted take downs on enemies.|$|R
5|$|Families at {{the base}} were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> {{advantage}} {{of many of the}} opportunities that the facility provided for them, as life at Loring was not all military-related. Although Loring was constructed with support facilities including a hospital, chapel, and schools, other forms of civilian life were added over the years as well.|$|E
5|$|Florida State University's International Programs (FSU IP) {{is ranked}} 12th {{in the nation}} among {{university}} study abroad programs. Every year Florida State consistently sends over 2,276 students across the world to study in multiple locations.

50|$|Typical {{aircraft}} {{using the}} airfield were Bristol Blenheim and Armstrong Whitworth Whitley. In August 1944 a Vickers Wellington was successfully landed by a Polish pilot following an engine failure.

She won several awards for this action, including an award for Outstanding Bravery at the 2006 Pride of Britain Awards, a Vodafone Life Savers Award, a Royal Humane Society Testimonial on Vellum, a Chief Constable's Commendation.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} bout, Shane Roller rebounded from three losses {{in a row}} with a {{unanimous}} decision victory over John Alessio. Roller, a former four-time Oklahoma high school state wrestling champion and a Big 12 Conference Champion at Oklahoma State University, was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> Alessio down and control his opponent's back on the ground, but was hurt on the feet {{in the first and}} third rounds.

50|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, Cameron (Cam) Stuart (Mark Ruffalo) is a Boston man {{suffering}} from bipolar disorder. He {{has had a}} psychotic break, which has caused him to be fired from his job and hospitalized. <b>To</b> be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> afford <b>to</b> <b>take</b> care of their two young children, Cam's wife, Maggie (Zoe Saldana) moves herself and the children to a small rent-controlled apartment, where she struggles to find enough work to support the three of them.|$|R

5|$|Jensen was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> on {{production}} of the Tiger because its assembly contract for the Volvo P1800 had recently been cancelled. An additional factor in the decision was that Jensen's chief engineer Kevin Beattie and his assistant Mike Jones had previously worked for Rootes, and understood how the company operated. The first of 14 Jensen-built prototypes {{were based on the}} Series IV body shell, which became available at the end of 1963.|$|E
5|$|Johnston went to Washington in December {{in hopes}} that Virginia would be readmitted to the Union. It was, however, not until January 26, 1870, that Virginia was readmitted; Johnston was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> his seat shortly afterward. The delay was due to a Congressional need to pass an act that would allow Virginia {{representation}} in the body.|$|E
5|$|The {{built-in}} gyroscope {{allows for}} some image stabilization {{for the camera}} while recording video, although it still has room for improvement, since state-of-the-art image stabilization algorithms {{do not need to}} use a gyroscope, but use image processing. Other features of the camera are macro (for close up pictures) and faster capture including being <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> its first picture in 1.1seconds and the next half a second later.|$|E

Noah then asks Meredith to accompany him as a partner.|$|R
