2500|$|There {{exists a}} point called {{the circle of}} least confusion, where {{chromatic}} aberration can be minimized. It can be further minimized by using an achromatic lens or achromat, in which materials with differing dispersion are assembled {{together to form a}} compound lens. The most common type is an achromatic doublet, with elements made of crown and flint glass. This reduces the amount of chromatic aberration over a certain range of wavelengths, though it does not produce perfect correction. By combining more than two lenses of different composition, the degree of correction can be further increased, as seen in an <b>apochromatic</b> <b>lens</b> or apochromat. Note that [...] "achromat" [...] and [...] "apochromat" [...] refer to the type of correction (2 or 3 wavelengths correctly focused), not the degree (how defocused the other wavelengths are), and an achromat made with sufficiently low dispersion glass can yield significantly better correction than an achromat made with more conventional glass. Similarly, the benefit of apochromats is not simply that they focus 3 wavelengths sharply, but that their error on other wavelength is also quite small.|$|E

50|$|The new Jena {{optical glass}} also {{opened up the}} {{possibility}} of increased performance of photographic lenses. The first use of Jena glass in a photographic lens was by Voigtländer, but as the lens was an old design its performance was not greatly improved. Subsequently the new glasses would demonstrate their value in correcting astigmatism, and {{in the production of}} <b>apochromatic</b> <b>lenses.</b> Abbe started the design of a photographic lens of symmetrical design with five elements, but went no further.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to high-quality general images, monorails {{can be used}} for high-precision technical applications. For a general subject it does not matter if the geometry of the image is imperceptibly different from the subject; the measurable, though very small, optical aberrations of even good quality lenses do not cause problems. When photographing subjects which must be very accurately represented, for example in making a mask for integrated circuit manufacture, <b>apochromatic</b> <b>lenses</b> of very high geometric accuracy and minimal color aberration (traded off against a small maximum aperture) and high price, are used.|$|R
50|$|Working {{together}} {{with his father and}} subsequently with his younger brother and nephew (George Dollond) he successfully designed and manufactured a number of optical instruments.

However, such lenses require correcting for higher ordered aberrations {{than the original}} seven with rare earth (lanthanum oxide) or fluorite (calcium fluoride) glasses of very high refractive index and/or very low dispersion of mid-twentieth century invention. The first <b>apochromatic</b> <b>lens</b> for consumer cameras was the Leitz APO-Telyt-R 180mm f/3.4 (1975, West Germany) for Leicaflex series (1964, West Germany) 35mm SLRs. Most professional telephoto lenses since the early 1980s are apochromatic. Note, better-than-apochromat lenses are available for scientific/military/industrial work.|$|E
5000|$|... 1975: E. Leitz APO-Telyt-R 180mm f/3.4 (West Germany): first <b>apochromatic</b> <b>lens</b> for {{consumer}} cameras (Leicaflex series SLRs). The refractive index of glass increases from red to {{blue of the}} light spectrum (color dispersion). Blue is focused closer to the lens than red causing rainbow-like color fringing (chromatic aberration). Most photographic camera lenses are achromatically corrected to bring blue and red to a common focus - leaving large residual green and violet chromatic aberrations that degrades image sharpness; especially severe in long focus or telephoto lenses. If red, green and blue are brought to a common focus (plus other aberration corrections) with very little residual aberration, the lens is called apochromatic. Chromatic aberration was an issue {{at the dawn of}} photography (daguerreotypes 1839 were blue sensitive only, while the human eye focused primarily using yellow), but apochromatic photographic lenses were considered unnecessary until the dominance of color film. The use of extra-low dispersion glasses made most 1980s professional telephotos and many 1990s amateur telephoto zooms apochromatic.|$|E
5000|$|Chromatic {{aberration}} is {{the phenomenon}} of different colors focusing at different distances from a lens. In photography, chromatic aberration produces soft overall images, and color fringing at high-contrast edges, like an edge between black and white. Astronomers face similar problems, particularly with telescopes that use lenses rather than mirrors. Achromatic lenses are corrected to bring two wavelengths (typically red and blue) into focus in the same plane. <b>Apochromatic</b> <b>lenses</b> are designed to bring three wavelengths (typically red, green, and blue) into focus in the same plane. The residual color error (secondary spectrum) can be up to {{an order of magnitude}} less than for an achromatic lens of equivalent aperture and focal length. Apochromats are also corrected for spherical aberration at two wavelengths, rather than one as in an achromat.Telescope objective lenses for wide-band digital imaging in astronomy must have apochromatic correction, as the optical sensitivity of typical CCD imaging arrays can extend from the ultraviolet through the visible spectrum and into the near infrared wavelength range. <b>Apochromatic</b> <b>lenses</b> for astrophotography in the 60-150 mm aperture range have been developed and marketed by several different firms, with focal ratios ranging from [...] to 7. Focused and guided properly during the exposure, these apochromatic objectives are capable of producing the sharpest wide-field astrophotographs optically possible for the given aperture sizes.|$|R
50|$|Lenses {{in general}} exhibit axial {{chromatic}} aberration in which different colors of light do not {{focus in the}} same plane. Normally, lens designs are optimized so that two or more (at least three for <b>apochromatic</b> <b>lenses)</b> wavelengths {{of light in the}} visible range focus at the same plane. Wavelengths very different from those optimized in the design process may be severely out-of-focus when the reference colors are in focus; this axial chromatic aberration is usually severe at short (violet) wavelengths. Lens performance may be poor for such wavelengths in other ways too, including an increase in flare due to anti-reflective coatings also being optimized for the expected wavelengths.|$|R

5000|$|In 1866, {{he became}} a {{research}} director at the Zeiss Optical Works, and in 1886 he invented the <b>apochromatic</b> <b>lens,</b> a microscope lens which eliminates both the primary and secondary color distortion. By 1870, Abbe invented the Abbe condenser, used for microscope illumination. In 1871, he designed the first refractometer, which he described in a booklet published in 1874. [...] He developed the laws of image of non-luminous objects by 1872. Zeiss Optical Works began selling his improved microscopes in 1872, by 1877 they were selling microscopes with homogenous immersion objective, and in 1886 his apochromatic objective microscopes were being sold. He created the Abbe number, a measure of any transparent material's variation of refractive index with wavelength and Abbe's criterion, which tests the hypothesis, that a systematic trend exists {{in a set of}} observations (in terms of resolving power this criterion stipulates that an angular separation cannot be less than the ratio of the wavelength to the aperture diameter, see angular resolution). Already a professor in Jena, he was hired by Carl Zeiss to improve the manufacturing process of optical instruments, which back then was largely based on trial and error.|$|E
40|$|A general {{method of}} {{designing}} an <b>apochromatic</b> <b>lens</b> {{by using a}} triplet of special glasses, in which the buried surfaces concept is used, can be outlined. First, one initially chooses a starting point which is already achromatic. Second, a thick plate or shell {{is added to the}} design, where the plate or shell has an index of refraction 1. 62, which is similar to the special glass triplet average index of refraction (for example: PSK 53 A, KZFS 1 and TIF 6). Third, the lens is then reoptimized to an achromatic design. Fourth, the single element is replace by the special glass triplet. Fifth, only the internal surfaces of the triplet are varied to correct all three wavelengths. Although this step will produce little improvement, it does serve to stabilize further optimization. Sixth and finally, all potential variables are used to fully optimize the <b>apochromatic</b> <b>lens.</b> Microscope objectives, for example, could be designed using this technique. The important concept to apply is the use of multiple buried surfaces in which each interface involves a special glass, after an achromatic design has been achieved. This extension relieves the restriction that all special glasses have a common index of refraction and allows a wider variety of special glasses to be used. However, it is still desirable to use glasses which form a large triangle on the P versus V diagram...|$|E
50|$|Exposure and {{focusing}} are difficult when using UV or IR film {{with a camera}} and lens designed for visible light. The ISO standard for film speed only applies to visible light, so visual-spectrum light meters are nearly useless. Film manufacturers can supply suggested equivalent film speeds under different conditions, and recommend heavy bracketing (e.g., with a certain filter, assume ISO 25 under daylight and ISO 64 under tungsten lighting). This allows a light meter {{to be used to}} estimate an exposure. The focal point for IR is slightly farther away from the camera than visible light, and UV slightly closer; this must be compensated for when focusing. <b>Apochromatic</b> <b>lenses</b> are sometimes recommended due to their improved focusing across the spectrum.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Since the {{refractive}} index of materials commonly used for lens {{depends on the}} wavelengths of light, practical camera optics fail to converge light to a single point on an image plane. Known as chromatic aberration, this phenomenon distorts image details by introducing magnification error, defocus blur, and color fringes.

In this work, we propose a new post-capture processing scheme designed to overcome these problems computationally.

We acquired movies at three wavelengths while simultaneously recording ECG and respiration for seven volunteers. We repeated this experiment for one volunteer at increased frame rate, additionally recording the pulse wave of a pulse oximeter. Movies were processed by dividing each image frame into discrete Regions of Interest (ROIs), averaging 10 × 10 raw pixels each. For each ROI, pulsatile variation over time was assigned to a matrix of ROI-pixel time traces with individual Fourier spectra. Photoplethysmograms correlated well with respiration reference traces at three wavelengths. Increased frame rates revealed weaker pulsations (main frequency components 0. 95 and 1. 9 Hz) superimposed upon respiration-correlated photoplethysmograms, which were heartbeat-related at three wavelengths. We acquired spatially resolved heartbeat-related photoplethysmograms at multiple wavelengths using a remote camera. This feasibility study shows potential for non-contact 2 -D imaging reflection-mode pulse oximetry. Clinical devices, however, require further development...|$|E

The TFC {{is a new}} multispectral instrument with electronically tuned spectral filtering and low-light-level sensitivity. It represents a hybrid between hyperspectral and multispectral imaging spectrometers that incorporates advantages from each, addressing issues such as complexity, cost, lack of sensitivity, and adaptability.

Described herein are the theory and principles of operation for the TFC, which includes a liquid crystal tunable filter, an intensified CCD, and a custom <b>apochromatic</b> <b>lens.</b> The results of proof-of-concept testing, and characterization of two prototype cameras are included, along with a summary of the design analyses {{for the development of a}} multiple-channel system. A significant result of this effort was the creation of a system-level model, which was used to facilitate development and predict performance. It includes models for the liquid crystal tunable filter and intensified CCD. Such modeling was necessary in the design of the system and is useful for evaluation of the system in remote-sensing applications. Also presented are characterization data from component testing, which included quantitative results for linearity, signal to noise ratio (SNR), linearity, and radiometric response. These data were used to help refine and validate the model. For a pre-defined source, the spatial and spectral response, and the noise of the camera, system can now be predicted. The innovation that sets this development apart is the fact that this instrument has been designed for integrated, multi-channel operation for the express purpose of real-time detection/identification in low-light-level conditions. Many of the requirements for the TFC were derived from this mission. In order to provide background for the design requirements for the TFC development, the mission and principles of operation behind the multi-channel system will be reviewed. Given the combination of the flexibility, simplicity, and sensitivity, the TFC and its multiple-channel extension can play a significant role in the next generation of remote-sensing instruments...|$|E
