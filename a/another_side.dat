5|$|The master take of {{the song}} was {{recorded}} by Dylan, with Tom Wilson producing, during the recording sessions for the <b>Another</b> <b>Side</b> of Bob Dylan album on June 9, 1964.

5|$|When {{attending}} a Fox Broadcasting Company publicity event in New York City with Rupert Murdoch, show producer Matt Groening {{was introduced by}} Murdoch to Rickles. Rickles began shouting at Groening, accusing him of spying on his Las Vegas act and using material from that for the episode. The cast actually had been receiving recordings from Rickles from the 1950s to use as {{ideas on how to}} get the style for his animatic portrayal. <b>Another</b> <b>side</b> story the writers produced was for Homer to become an outstanding barber and hair dresser, but this was never used.|$|E

5|$|Barrowman is also {{featured}} {{on more than}} a dozen musical theatre recordings including cover tunes found on his 2007 album, <b>Another</b> <b>Side,</b> and 2008's Music Music Music. Both albums accrued places on the UK Albums Chart, as did his self-titled John Barrowman (2010), which reached number 11, his highest chart placing to date. Furthermore, Barrowman has published two memoirs and autobiographies, Anything Goes (2008) and I Am What I Am (2009), with his sister Carole as co-author. The siblings also teamed up to write a novel, Hollow Earth (2012). The second book in the series, Bone Quill, has been released in the UK and was released in the US in July 2013.|$|E
5|$|In June 2007, {{they shot}} the bridge battle near Bovec in the Soča Valley, Slovenia. The {{location}} {{was chosen for}} its resemblance to New Zealand. A large bridge was built, which was modelled on the one Julius Caesar built to cross the Rhine. Whereas Caesar supposedly built his bridge in ten days, the filmmakers had around forty. The schedule was short though, but the authorities would only allow them this build time to not completely disrupt normal summer activities on the lake. The filmmakers made a trench to change the river's course, so they could deepen the drained sides of the riverbed so it looked like one could drown in it. The crew also cut down 100 trees for shots of the Telmarines building the bridge; the trees were moved to <b>another</b> <b>side</b> of the river for decoration. The bridge stood for two months before being dismantled. As part of the clean-up, the cut-down trees {{and parts of the}} bridge were sent to a recycling plant, while other portions of the bridge were sent to the studio for close-ups shot against bluescreen.|$|E
5|$|Since Scotland's first One Day International (ODI) in 1999, 60 {{players have}} {{represented}} the team. A One Day International (ODI) {{is an international}} cricket match between two representative teams, each having ODI status, {{as determined by the}} International Cricket Council (ICC). An ODI differs from Test matches in that the number of overs per team is limited, and that each team has only one innings. The list is arranged in the order in which each player won his first ODI cap. Where more than one player won his first ODI cap in the same match, those players are listed alphabetically by surname. Scotland played their first ODI matches at the 1999 Cricket World Cup. Since 1 January 2006, Scotland has had official ODI status, meaning that any one-day match it plays after that date against the Test-playing nations, or against <b>another</b> <b>side</b> with ODI status, is an official ODI. The ICC currently grants temporary ODI status to associate (non-Test) nations for four-year cycles based on performances at World Cup qualification events. Scotland retains official ODI status at least {{until the end of the}} 2018 Cricket World Cup Qualifier.|$|E

50|$|Until {{the early}} 2000s two sidings were located {{to the west}} of the station to serve a cement works just north of the station. <b>Another</b> <b>siding</b> was located to the east of the station. All have been removed.|$|R
50|$|The {{station is}} staffed and {{consists}} of an island platform serving two tracks. A bidirectional loop for freight trains lies adjacent to track 2 on the south <b>side,</b> and <b>another</b> <b>siding</b> is provided adjacent to track 1 on the north side.|$|R
5|$|The {{monument}} is of ashlar stone masonry, 25feet (7.6m) high, in the English Baroque style. On {{the south}} side is a slate tablet inscribed with a quotation from the account by Lord Clarendon (1609–1674) in his History of the Rebellion and Civil Wars in England of the Battle of Lansdowne (1643). On the north side are two poems. On top is a griffin (the crest and supporters of the Grenvilles) holding an escutcheon displaying the Grenville coat of arms: Gules, three clarions or. On <b>another</b> <b>side</b> are shown the Royal Arms of King Charles II (1660–1685) supported by the arms of Sir Bevil's eldest son and heir John Granville, 1st Earl of Bath (1628–1701) and by {{the arms of the}} latter's half first cousin General George Monck, 1st Duke of Albemarle, KG (1608–1670). Monck was the principal figure behind the Restoration of the Monarchy to King Charles II in 1660, in effecting which he was much assisted by Sir John Grenville, for which services both were elevated to the peerage.|$|E
5|$|When {{not in a}} dungeon, Link {{explores the}} overworld. In Seasons, the overworld {{consists}} of Holodrum and the subterranean world of Subrosia. The two worlds are linked by several portals. In Ages, Link travels between present-day Labrynna and the past, connected by Time Holes. In either game, some areas of one world are accessible only from portals from the other and vice versa. Holodrum, Subrosia, and Labrynna contain optional side quests and upgrades for Link and his equipment. One such side quest is ring collection; rings provide Link with various bonuses and abilities, such as improved defense. Some rings {{do not have any}} practical uses, e.g. rings that weaken Link's attack or defense, or transform Link into an enemy creature, or are awarded when certain criteria are met but do not have any effect. <b>Another</b> <b>side</b> quest is the optional trading game, in which Link receives and delivers special items to certain people throughout the land. Once completed, Link receives an upgraded sword.|$|E
5|$|<b>Another</b> <b>side</b> {{trade was}} {{smuggling}} along the Pacific {{coast of the}} Spanish Empire, where foreign trade was prohibited by Spanish law. This trade peaked in the 1810s, then faded in the 1820s. Traders concentrated on Alta California, which produced a surplus of grain, beef, tallow, and hides, but was chronically short of manufactured goods. American ships brought goods to the missions of Alta California in exchange for grain, beef, and Californian sea otter skins. The grain, beef, and other provisions were taken to Sitka, which was perennially short of foods supplies. After Mexico gained independence in 1821 the American trade with Alta California continued in a slightly modified form. American traders brought mostly clothing, cottons, silks, lace, cutlery, alcohol, and sugar, which were traded for hides and tallow at a profit generally between 200% and 300%. The California Hide Trade became a major industry in its own right. By the 1830s, however, the missions of Alta California had been secularized by Mexican authorities and deserted by Indian labourers. The trade slid into unprofitability. The decline of the American trade with Alta California left just one significant alternative to the ever-dwindling sea otter trade—the provisioning of the settlements of Russian America, which lasted until the Americans abandoned the North West Coast altogether in the early 1840s. From {{the first decade of}} the 19th century until 1841 American ships visited Sitka regularly, trading provisions, textiles, and liquor for fur seal skins, timber, and fish. This trade was usually highly profitable for the Americans and the Russian settlements depended on it. Thus when Tsar NicholasI issued the ukase of 1821, banning foreign trade north of the 51st parallel, the Russian colonies in America were forced to ignore the ban and engage in smuggling.|$|E

50|$|At Maiden Newton, {{the branch}} had a bay {{platform}} on the upside; trains entered in a southerly direction. In twentieth century steam days, {{there was a}} siding alongside the branch on a rising gradient, and the customary operation was to propel an arrived passenger train into the siding; the locomotive then moved to <b>another</b> <b>siding,</b> and the passenger coaches were gravitated to the bay platform {{under the control of}} the guard.|$|R
50|$|The station, {{which opened}} {{with the line}} in mid-1902, had two platforms, each with a {{run-round}} loop, and a goods shed and cattle dock with their own sidings. <b>Another</b> <b>siding</b> branched west towards Skierthorns Quarry, ending {{at the rear of}} a set of terraced houses known as Woodlands Terrace. Limestone was brought down from the quarry by a tramway to Woodlands Terrace, where it was transferred to trains.|$|R
