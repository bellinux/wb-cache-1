Concerning molecular imaging, the advantage of [18 F]altanserin (b) over [11 C]MDL 100907 (a) is the possibility to perform equilibrium scans lasting several hours and to transport the tracer to other facilities based on the 110 minute half-life of 18 F-fluorine. A drawback of [18 F]altanserin is its rapid and extensive metabolism. Four metabolites are formed in humans that cross the blood-brain-barrier, whereas metabolites of [11 C]MDL 100907 do not enter the brain to any larger extent.

40|$|The {{feasibility}} of in vivo serotonin 5 HT(2) receptor binding measurement using [F- 18]altanserin as a radioligand {{has been well}} established. In this study, the postsynaptic receptor binding potential of this ligand was examined as a possible indicator of synaptic serotonin content after pharmacological challenge. Studies were performed in 11 subjects {{with a history of}} recurrent major depression. Six of them received serotonergic antidepressive treatment {{at the time of the}} experiment, the other five patients were untreated. Two PET measurements were carried out in each subject within 2 or 3 days. Before one of the measurements, 25 mg of the serotonin re-uptake inhibitor clomipramine were given intravenously, the other measurement was done without pharmacological challenge. The data were analyzed using non-linear least-square regression and Logan's graphical method. In the whole group of subjects, binding potential and distribution volume of <b>altanserin</b> decreased following clomipramine challenge. The decrease was between 14 (P = 0. 03) and 23 % (P = 0. 004). This effect was mainly seen in subjects not on antidepressive medication. Clomipramine challenge probably increased the synaptic serotonin level, which competed with <b>altanserin</b> leading to the lowered binding potential. The paradigm might, thus, be useful to estimate serotonin release in vivo. Pretreatment with serotonergic antidepressants reduces the effect of clomipramine. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B. V.

40|$|Changes in serotonin- 2 receptors {{have been}} {{demonstrated}} in brain autopsy material from patients with various neurodegenerative and affective disorders. It would be desirable to locate a ligand {{for the study of}} these receptors in vivo with positron emission tomography (PET). <b>Altanserin</b> is a 4 -benzoylpiperidine derivative with a high affinity and selectivity for S 2 receptors in vitro. Dynamic PET studies were carried out in nine normal volunteers with high-specific activity (376 - 1, 680 mCi/mumol) [18 F]altanserin. Arterial blood samples were obtained and the plasma time-activity curves were corrected for the presence of labeled metabolites. Thirty minutes after injection, selective retention of the radioligand was observed in cortical areas, while the cerebellum, caudate, and thalamus had low radioactivity levels. Specific binding reached a plateau between 30 and 65 min postinjection at 1. 8 % of the injected dose/L of brain and then decreased, indicating the reversibility of the binding. The total/nonspecific binding ratio reached 2. 6 for times between 50 and 70 min postinjection. The graphical analysis proposed by Logan et al. allowed us to estimate the binding potential (Bmax/KD). Pretreatment with ketanserin was given to three volunteers and brain activity remained uniformly low. An additional study in one volunteer showed that [18 F]altanserin can be displaced from the receptors by large doses of ketanserin. At the end of the study, unchanged <b>altanserin</b> was 57 % of the total plasma activity. These results suggest that [18 F]altanserin is selective for S 2 receptors in vivo as it is in vitro.

40|$|The {{effects of}} various {{manipulations}} of brain 5 -HT mechanisms on the behavioural responses {{induced by the}} selective NK- 3 tachykinin agonist senktide in rodents were assessed. Senktide elicited wet dog shakes in the rat which were attenuated by the 5 -HT 1 C/ 2 antagonist mianserin and the selective 5 -HT 2 antagonist <b>altanserin.</b> Senktide-induced forepaw treading was stereospecifically attenuated by the 5 -HT 1 A + B antagonist (-) -alprenolol. Senktide also elicited chewing mouth movements and yawning, which were unaffected by mianserin, <b>altanserin,</b> (+) - or (-) -alprenolol, or the selective 5 -HT 3 antagonist ICS 205 - 930, but attenuated by the muscarinic antagonist scopolamine. Penile grooming elicited by senktide was attenuated by mianserin, but was unaffected by the other antagonists. Senktide-induced wet dog shakes were enhanced by the 5 -HT reuptake inhibitors citalopram and fluoxetine, suppressed by the monoamine oxidase (MAO) -B inhibitor pargyline, but unaffected by the MAO-A inhibitor clorgyline. Forepaw treading was potentiated by citalopram and clorgyline, but not significantly altered by fluoxetine or pargyline. Depletion of 5 -HT by p-chlorophenylalanine (PCPA) in the rat attenuated senktide-induced wet dog shakes and forepaw treading. Neither PCPA nor 5, 7 -dihydroxytryptamine affected senktide-induced behaviours in the mouse, but the degree of brain 5 -HT depletion caused by these treatments in mice was relatively small. These findings indicate that stimulation of NK- 3 tachykinin receptors by senktide results in a complex behavioural syndrome which is mediated by multiple 5 -HT receptors, and dependent upon intact stores of endogenous 5 -HT. Independent stimulation of brain cholinergic mechanisms by senktide is also confirmed...|$|E

40|$|Serotoninergic type 2 (5 HT 2) receptors {{have been}} implicated in the {{regulation}} of many brain functions in humans and {{may play a role}} in several neurological and psychiatric diseases. Fluorine- 18 <b>altanserin</b> has been proposed as a new radiotracer for the study of 5 HT 2 receptors by PET because of its high affinity for 5 HT 2 receptors (Ki: 0. 13 nM) and its good specificity in in vitro studies. Dynamic PET studies were carried out in 12 healthy volunteers after intravenous injection of 0. 1 mCi/kg [18 F]altanserin. Ninety minutes after injection, we observed mainly cortical binding. Basal ganglia and cerebellum showed very low uptake and the frontal cortex to cerebellum ratio was about 3. To evaluate the quantitative distribution of this ligand in the brain, we used two different methods of data analysis: a four-compartment model was used to achieve quantitative evaluation of rate constants (K 1 and k 2 through k 6) by non-linear regression, and a multiple-time graphical analysis technique for reversible binding was employed for the measurement of k 1 /k 2 and k 3 /k 4 ratios. Using both methods, we found significant differences in binding capacity (estimated by k 3 /k 4 = Bmax/Kd) between regions, the values increasing as follows: occipital, limbic, parietal, frontal and temporal cortex. After correction of values obtained by the graphical method for the existence of non-specific binding, results generated by the two methods were consistent. Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U. S.

40|$|AbstractA {{dysfunctional}} glutamatergic {{system is}} thought to be central to the negative symptoms and cognitive deficits recognized as determinant to the poor quality of life of people with schizophrenia. Modulating glutamate uptake has, thus, been suggested as a novel target for antipsychotics. Alstonine is an indole alkaloid sharing with atypical antipsychotics the profile in animal models relevant to schizophrenia, though divergent in its mechanism of action. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effects of alstonine on glutamate uptake. Additionally, the effects on glutathione content and extracellular S 100 B levels were assessed. Acute hippocampal slices were incubated with haloperidol (10 μM), clozapine (10 and 100 μM) or alstonine (1 – 100 μM), alone or in combination with apomorphine (100 μM), and 5 -HT 2 receptor antagonists (0. 01 μM <b>altanserin</b> and 0. 1 μM SB 242084). A reduction in glutamate uptake was observed with alstonine and clozapine, but not haloperidol. Apomorphine abolished the effect of clozapine, whereas 5 -HT 2 A and 5 -HT 2 C antagonists abolished the effects of alstonine. Increased levels of glutathione were observed only with alstonine, also the only compound that failed to decrease the release of S 100 B. This study shows that alstonine decreases glutamate uptake, which may be beneficial to the glutamatergic deficit observed in schizophrenia. Noteworthily, the decrease in glutamate uptake is compatible with the reversal of MK- 801 -induced social interaction and working memory deficits. An additional potential benefit of alstonine as an antipsychotic is its ability to increase glutathione, a key cellular antioxidant reported to be decreased in the brain of patients with schizophrenia. Adding to the characterization of the novel mechanism of action of alstonine, the lack of effect of apomorphine in alstonine-induced changes in glutamate uptake reinforces that D 2 receptors are not primarily implicated. Though clearly mediated by 5 -HT 2 A and 5 -HT 2 C serotonin receptors, the precise mechanisms that result in the effects of alstonine on glutamate uptake warrant elucidation...|$|E
40|$|Context: Both {{hallucinogens}} and 3, 4 -methylenedioxy-methamphetamine (MDMA or "ecstasy") {{have direct}} agonistic effects on postsynaptic serotonin 2 A receptors, the key site for hallucinogenic actions. In addition, MDMA {{is a potent}} releaser and reuptake inhibitor of presynaptic serotonin. Objective: To assess the differential effects of MDMA and hallucinogen use on cerebral serotonin transporter (SERT) and serotonin 2 A receptor binding. Design: A positron emission tomography study of 24 young adult drug users and 21 nonusing control participants performed with carbon 11 (11 C) -labeled 3 -amino- 4 -[2 -[(di(methyl) amino) methyl]phenyl] sulfanylbenzonitrile (DASB) and fluorine 18 (18 F) -labeled <b>altanserin,</b> respectively. Scans were performed in the user group after a minimum drug abstinence period of 11 days, and the group was subdivided into hallucinogen-preferring users (n= 10) and MDMA-preferring users (n= 14). Participants: Twenty-four young adult users ofMDMA and/or hallucinogenic drugs and 21 nonusing controls. Main Outcome Measures: In vivo cerebral SERT and serotonin 2 A receptor binding. Results: Compared with nonusers, MDMA-preferring users showed significant decreases in SERT nondisplaceable binding potential (neocortex, - 56 %; pallidostriatum, - 19 %; and amygdala, - 32 %); no significant changes were seen in hallucinogen-preferring users. Both cortical and pallidostriatal SERT nondisplaceable binding potential was negatively correlated {{with the number of}} lifetime MDMA exposures, and the time of abstinence from MDMA was positively correlated with subcortical, but not cortical, SERT binding. A small decrease in neocortical serotonin 2 A receptor binding in the serotonin 2 A receptor agonist users (both user groups) was also detected. Conclusions: We found evidence that MDMA but not hallucinogen use is associated with changes in the cerebral presynaptic serotonergic transmitter system. Because hallucinogenic drugs primarily have serotonin 2 A receptor agonistic actions, we conclude that the negative association between MDMA use and cerebral SERT binding is mediated through a direct presynaptic MDMA effect rather than by the serotonin 2 A agonistic effects of MDMA. Our cross-sectional data suggest that subcortical, but not cortical, recovery of SERT binding might take place after several months of MDMA abstinence. © 2011 American Medical Association.

40|$|Die vorliegende Diplomarbeit widmete sich der Evaluierung physikalischer und chemischer Parameter verschiedener Radiofluorierungs-Methoden an Molekü-len von großem Interesse für die klinische Forschung. Weiters sollten die entsprechenden Synthesen bis hin zu ihrer klinischen Anwendung entwickelt werden, was die Aufstellung verlässlicher Methoden der Qualitätskontrolle beinhaltet, um eine möglichst hohe Reinheit des Produktes zu gewährleisten. In diesem Sinne wurden daher auch Methoden zur Formulierung pharmakologischer Wirkstoffe, wie in der nuklearmedizinischen Praxis üblich, angewandt. Fluor- 18 wurde als Zyklotron-Produkt über das medizinische Zyklotron der medizinischen Universität Wien in seiner anionischen Form in wässeriger Lösung erhalten.

FET ist eine Fluor- 18 markierter Aminosäure, die in der Positronenemissionsto-mographie für die Tumor-Diagnostik im Nervensystem Verwendung findet. Vom radiochemischen Standpunkt aus besteht der Hauptschritt der Synthese in einer Fluorethylierung, ein Beispiel für die allgemeine Markierungs-Methode der Fluoralkylierungen, einer wichtigen Methode in der Radiochemie. <b>Altanserin</b> ist ein Ligand für den 5 HT 2 A-Rezeptor, ein Rezeptor-Subtyp des serotonergen Systems. Da das Molekül selbst bereits eine Fluoratom enthält, das direkt an einen der aromatischen Ringe gebunden ist, besteht der kritische Reaktionsschritt in einer nukleophilen Fluorierung mit dem vergleichsweise schlechten Nukleophil F-, ausgehend von einem Precursor, der statt des Fluors die stark elektronenziehende Nitrogruppe enthält. FE@SUPPY: 11 und FE@SUPPY: 21 sind Ester des Moleküls FE@SUPPY, ein Ligand für den A 3 -Rezeptor-Subtypen des purinergen Systems. Letzteres Mole-kül, das sowohl eine Thiocarboxy- als auch eine Cyrboxy-Gruppe enthält, soll mit einem Halogen-Derivat von [18 F]Fluorethan verestert werden.

Zusätzlich werden die Reaktionsausbeuten bei Verwendung unterschiedlicher Alkalimetalliodide für die Herstellung des FIE evaluiert. Als Ergebnis konnte die Produktion von FET in einem Maße standardisiert wer-den, das seine Routine-Produktion in der klinischen Anwendung erlaubt. Außer-dem konnten wichtige Parameter für die Produktion von [18 F]Altanserin und FE@SUPPY: 21 evaluiert werden, um eine weitere Entwicklung dieser Synthe-sen für ihre jeweiligen Anwendungen zu gewährleisten. present diploma thesis {{focused on}} the evaluation of several physical and chemical parameters of different radio fluorination procedures using molecules of high interest in clinical research. Additionally, the respective synthesis should be fully developed for clinical application, hence including the setup of reliable procedures for quality control assuring the highest possible purity of the obtained product. Thus, techniques for the formulation of pharmacologically active sub-stances as established for nuclear medical applications had to be adopted. Fluorine- 18 was obtained as a cyclotron product from the medical cyclotron of the medical university of Vienna in its anionic form in aqueous solution. Following standard procedures in nuclear chemistry, this direct product was further treated for better accessibility in reactions with organic molecules by transferring the ani-onic [18 F]F- to organic phases by adding Kryptand[2. 2. 2] complexed K+ as counte-rion. FET is a fluorine- 18 labelled amino acid used in positron emission tomography for diagnosis of tumours especially in the brain. From a radiochemical point of view, the main step of the synthesis includes a fluoroethylation, thus providing a special example for the more general type of fluoroalkylations, an important radio labelling strategy in medicinal nuclear chemistry. <b>Altanserin</b> is a ligand for the 5 HT 2 A receptor, a receptor subtype of the seroton-ergic system. As the molecule itself contains a fluorine atom directly bound to one of its aromatic rings, the critical step in the radiosynthesis of [18 F]altanserin is a nucleophilic fluorination with the rather bad nucleophile F¬-, starting from a precursor having substituted the strongly electron withdrawing nitro group for the fluorine. FE@SUPPY: 11 and FE@SUPPY: 21 are single ester derivates of the molecule FE@SUPPY, a ligand for the A 3 receptor subtype of the purinergic system. The last containing both a thiocarboxy and a carboxy group is to be esterified with halogen derivate of [18 F]fluoroethan. Using conlusions from the theory of hard and soft acids and bases the reaction is conducted versus the thiocarboxyl ester using 1 -[18 F]fluoro- 2 -iodoethan (FIE) as fluoroalkylation agent. Moreover, reaction yields have been evaluated by using different alkali metal iodides for the preparation of FIE. As a result, the production of FET could be standardized for the routine produc-tion for clinical application. Furthermore, important parameters {{for the production of}} [18]altanserin and FE@SUPPY: 21 could be evaluated for further developing the syntheses for their relative applications. ...|$|E
40|$|Chronic obstructive {{pulmonary}} disease (COPD) is a chronic lung disease that causes irreversible limitations in lung airflow, {{which is usually}} both progressive and associated with an abnormal inflammatory response of the lungs to noxious particles or gases. COPD is also characterized as chronic bronchitis and emphysema. The impact and burden of COPD on the global population are getting severe, and COPD is projected to be the third {{leading cause of death}} worldwide in 2030. Only half of COPD cases were attributed by cigarette smoking, other risk factors includes demographic and genetic factors, and exposures to air pollution, infections also play another important role in the exacerbation of COPD. Inflammatory cells and other mediators such as cytokines and bacterial infection are responsible for the inflammatory processes in the airways. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a constituent of the gram-negative bacteria, is an important signaling molecule in the innate immune system. Serotonin (5 -HT) is a neurotransmitter, it acts on the membrane receptors in the central and peripheral nervous system, as well as in non-neuronal tissues. Serotonin is responsible for bronchoconstriction and vasoconstriction in the airway. This study aimed to investigate the effects of LPS-induced releases of interleukin (IL) - 6 and tumor necrotic factor (TNF) - α and the effects of 5 -HT pretreatment on the regulation of LPS-induced releases of IL- 6 and TNF-α in the differentiated THP- 1 cells (i. e. macrophages). Finally, the study also elucidated whether the effects of 5 -HT would be mediated via 5 -HT 2 A receptors. These data demonstrated that LPS caused an elevation of IL- 6 and TNF-α releases in differentiated THP- 1 cells. There was no effect of 5 -HT alone on IL- 6 and TNF-α releases, but an inhibition of both LPS-induced IL- 6 and TNF-α releases after pretreatment with 5 -HT was observed. Despite the presence of 5 -HT 2 A receptors demonstrated by immunohistochemistry in differentiated THP- 1 cells, there was only a small inhibitory effect of 5 -HT on TNF-α release but not on IL- 6 release by two different 5 -HT 2 A receptor antagonists, ketanserin and <b>altanserin.</b> Taken together, the current findings suggest that 5 -HT may perform as an anti-inflammatory mediator at high concentration (up to 1 mM) through non- 5 -HT 2 A receptor-mediated response to down-regulate the production of IL- 6 and TNF-α. Therefore, 5 -HT may be used as a potential treatment to combat gram-negative bacterial infection. However, further investigations are needed to determine the role of 5 -HT in the regulation of inflammation. published_or_final_versionPharmacology and PharmacyMasterMaster of Medical Science...|$|E
