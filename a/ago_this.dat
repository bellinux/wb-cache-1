5|$|The Purulla/El Médano ignimbrites have a precaldera {{lower layer}} that various methods have dated 20,000 to 5,000 years <b>ago.</b> <b>This</b> stage was effusive and {{accompanied}} by the emplacement of lava domes. A postcaldera stage is represented by lava domes on the southeast edge of the caldera, as well as block and ash flows inside the caldera. These are rhyolitic in composition. Their age is unknown, but postdates the caldera formation.|$|E
5|$|The Toba {{eruption}} (the Toba event) {{occurred at}} what is now Lake Toba about 75000±900 years ago.

It also has Pallava sculptural depictions of Narasimha and Varaha, two of the ten avatars of Vishnu.|$|E

5|$|Analysis of {{mitochondrial}} DNA, from {{a limited}} number of specimens, suggested that there was gene flow within the continental Asian populations until the 20th century reductions in range, and that Australia was colonized only in the Late Pleistocene, some 35,000 years <b>ago.</b> <b>This</b> has been corroborated by nDNA microsatellite analyses with four times the sample size. This study further suggests that the Australian population is quite inbred. As there exists the possibility of (limited) hybridization with the genetically distinct brolga, the Australian sarus crane can be expected to be an incipient species.|$|E
5|$|Botany {{originated}} as herbalism, {{the study}} and use of plants for their medicinal properties. Many records of the Holocene period date early botanical knowledge {{as far back as}} 10,000 years <b>ago.</b> <b>This</b> early unrecorded knowledge of plants was discovered in ancient sites of human occupation within Tennessee, which make up much of the Cherokee land today. The early recorded history of botany includes many ancient writings and plant classifications. Examples of early botanical works have been found in ancient texts from India dating back to before 1100 BC, in archaic Avestan writings, and in works from China before it was unified in 221 BC.|$|E
5|$|Evidence of {{abstract}} thinking {{can be seen}} in the archaeological record as early as the Acheulean-Middle Stone Age transition, approximately 300,000-250,000 years <b>ago.</b> <b>This</b> transition involves a shift in stone tool technology from Mode 2, Acheulean tools, to Mode 3 and 4, which include blades and microliths. The manufacture of these tools requires planning and the understanding of how striking a stone will produce different flaking patterns. This requires abstract thought, one of the hallmarks of modern human behavior. The shift from large cutting tools in the Acheulian to smaller and more diversified toolkits in the MSA represents a better cognitive and conceptual understanding of flintknapping, as well as the potential functional effects of distinct tool types.|$|E

5|$|Fossils of Indraloris {{have been}} found only in the Miocene Siwalik fossil beds of India and Pakistan. I.himalayensis is known only from Haritalyangar, a Late Miocene site in the Indian state of Himachal Pradesh. This site has been dated to about 9 million years <b>ago.</b> <b>This</b> site has also yielded Sivaladapis nagrii. Indraloris kamlialensis is known from two sites in the {{province}} of Punjab, Pakistan, that are both dated to 15.2 million years ago: Y642 and Y682. Sivaladapis palaendicus has also been recorded at both sites, and two lorisids are known from Y682. The unnamed large Indraloris is known from Y642 and an older site, Y801 (16.8 million years old). All are in the Potwar Plateau region.|$|E
5|$|It {{is unknown}} when exactly Shakespeare wrote Romeo and Juliet. Juliet's nurse {{refers to an}} {{earthquake}} she says occurred 11 years <b>ago.</b> <b>This</b> may refer to the Dover Straits earthquake of 1580, which would date that particular line to 1591. Other earthquakes—both in England and in Verona—have been proposed {{in support of the}} different dates. But the play's stylistic similarities with A Midsummer Night's Dream and other plays conventionally dated around 1594–95, place its composition sometime between 1591 and 1595. One conjecture is that Shakespeare may have begun a draft in 1591, which he completed in 1595.|$|E
5|$|P. l. spelaea or P. spelaea, {{known as}} the European cave lion, Eurasian cave lion, or Upper Pleistocene European cave lion, {{occurred}} in Eurasia 300,000 to 10,000 years <b>ago.</b> <b>This</b> species is known from Paleolithic cave paintings, ivory carvings, and clay busts, indicating it had protruding ears, tufted tails, perhaps faint tiger-like stripes. A few had a ruff or primitive mane around their necks, possibly indicating males, but many scenes show hunting behavior (which would be the females).|$|E

5|$|Several other {{formations}} {{were also}} created but were mostly eroded away following two major periods of uplift. The Laramide orogeny affected the entire {{western part of}} what would become North America starting about 70million to 50million years <b>ago.</b> <b>This</b> event helped to build the Rocky Mountains {{and in the process}} closed the Cretaceous Seaway. The Straight Cliffs, Wahweap, and Kaiparowits formations were victims of this uplift. The Colorado Plateaus were uplifted 16million years ago and were segmented into different plateaus, each separated from its neighbors by faults and each having its own uplift rate. The Boat Mesa Conglomerate and the Sevier River Formation were removed by erosion following this uplift.|$|E
5|$|Subsequent uplift of the Colorado Plateau and tilting of the Markagunt Plateau started 13million years <b>ago.</b> <b>This</b> steepened {{the stream}} {{gradient}} of the ancestral Virgin River (Zion Canyon {{section of the}} park), and Taylor and La Verkin creeks (Kolob Canyons section of the park), causing them to flow and downcut faster into the underlying Markagunt Plateau. Downcutting continues to be especially rapid after heavy rainstorms and winter runoff when the water contains large amounts of suspended and abrasive sand grains. Uplift and downcutting are so fast that slot canyons (very narrow river-cut features with vertical walls), such as the Zion Narrows, formed.|$|E
5|$|The Mendip Hills are {{the most}} southerly Carboniferous Limestone upland in Britain. The rock strata known as the Carboniferous Limestone were laid down during the early Carboniferous Period, about 320–350million years ago. Subsequently, much of northwestern Europe {{underwent}} continental collision throughout the late Paleozoic Era, culminating in the final phases of the Variscan orogeny {{near the end of}} the Carboniferous, 300million years <b>ago.</b> <b>This</b> tectonic activity produced a complex suite of mountain and hill ranges across what is now southern Ireland, south-western England, Brittany, and elsewhere in western Europe.|$|E

5|$|The {{surrounding}} valley formed {{because of}} a swell in the underlying rock of the Colorado Plateau that caused the regional elevation to intersect the Chinle and Moenkopi Formations, deposited in the Triassic about 208–245 million years <b>ago.</b> <b>This</b> area contains sandstone, siltstone, shale and limestone formed by the sediments on ancient seabeds and later alluvial deposits made by the Colorado and Paria Rivers. Because these are more easily eroded than the rock layers that lie above and below them, the Colorado Plateau gradually slopes down to river level at Lees Ferry {{through a series of}} flat benchlands.|$|E
