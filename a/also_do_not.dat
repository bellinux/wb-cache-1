5|$|Discussion {{continues}} {{about the}} relative advantage or disadvantage of using the blades. Researchers and analysts {{also point out that}} the research studies are done on level, stationary treadmills, and do not measure performance from starting blocks or on actual curved tracks. They <b>also</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> take into account differences in physiology between amputees and non-amputees, who have such factors as musculature, blade height and weight and differences in blood circulation patterns due to the history of their limb loss.|$|E
5|$|This bird's closest {{relatives}} are {{a group of}} South Polar species, the South American (Sterna hirundinacea), Kerguelen (S. virgata), and Antarctic (S. vittata) terns. On the wintering grounds, the Arctic tern can be distinguished from these relatives; the six-month difference in moult is the best clue here, with Arctic terns being in winter plumage during the southern summer. The southern species <b>also</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> show darker wingtips in flight.|$|E
5|$|Designed both to {{accelerate}} future elections and reduce outside interference, {{the rules of}} Ubi periculum provide for the cardinal electors to be secluded for {{the entirety of the}} conclave, including having their meals passed through a small opening, and for their rations to be reduced to a single meal at the end of three days, or bread and water (with a little wine) after eight days. Cardinals <b>also</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> collect from the Apostolic Camera any payments they might otherwise receive during the conclave.|$|E

5|$|Human {{beings have}} played a role in the ecology of Presque Isle since at least the Erielhonan. The natural drift of sand is {{hindered}} or stopped by breakwaters, permanent structures, and roads. Roads <b>also</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> absorb rainwater, causing erosion, and break up natural habitats. Excavations such as those to make the waterworks basins or the marina have destroyed habitats, but yearly artificial replenishment with sand helps to create new ones. One area within the park is closed to all public use from April to November to minimize the impact of humans: it is the easternmost part of the park, Gull Point.|$|E
5|$|Several {{studies have}} shown that {{hypopituitarism}} is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and some also an increased risk of death of about 50% to 150% the normal population. It has been difficult to establish which hormone deficiency is responsible for this risk, as almost all patients studied had growth hormone deficiency. The studies <b>also</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> answer the question as to whether the hypopituitarism itself causes the increased mortality, or whether some of the risk is to be attributed to the treatments, some of which (such as sex hormone supplementation) have a recognized adverse effect on cardiovascular risk.|$|E
5|$|The ratings <b>also</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> reflect state-specific {{population}} conditions. For instance, for the Texas horned lizard, much {{of eastern}} Texas {{has lost the}} animal. Nevertheless, based on healthy populations {{in other parts of}} the West, especially New Mexico, the IUCN rates the animal Least Concern. For the timber rattlesnake (West Virginia), the IUCN notes the animal as losing range in many parts of the northeastern U.S., but because the animal is numerous in the southern Appalachians, it is also Least Concern.|$|E

5|$|The {{trunk of}} Dinocephalosaurus {{has at least}} 26 {{vertebrae}}. In Dinocephalosaurus, {{there appear to be}} no lumbar vertebrae, or vertebrae of the trunk lacking ribs. The ribs of the sacrum and tail <b>also</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> appear to be fused to their corresponding vertebrae. Each of the gastralia in Dinocephalosaurus is composed of three elements instead of four as in Tanystropheus; they differ in that Dinocephalosaurus only has one element on the midline, while Tanystropheus has two elements that combine to form a midline bar.|$|E
5|$|The week-long holiday of Passover in {{the spring}} commemorates the Exodus from Egypt, and in Israel is usually a time for visiting friends and relatives, travelling, and {{on the first night}} of Passover, the {{traditional}} ritual dinner, known as the Seder. Foods containing ḥametz– leaven or yeast– may not be eaten during Passover. This means bread, pastries and certain fermented beverages, such as beer, cannot be consumed. Ashkenazim <b>also</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> eat legumes, known as kitniyot. Over the centuries, Jewish cooks have developed dishes using alternative ingredients and this characterizes Passover food in Israel today.|$|E
5|$|Friendly and enemy non-player {{characters}} {{inhabit the}} two worlds. Friendly characters can provide Link with assistance or side-quests to complete. Link wields a sword and shield, {{which can be}} used to defeat enemies and deflects their attacks. Other combat items from past Zelda games return, such as the bow, the fire rod, bombs, and more. However, unlike previous games, the methods for obtaining and using these items is different. Rather than finding them in dungeons, they are rented or purchased from a merchant, named Ravio. Should Link fall in battle, his rented items will be returned to Ravio. They <b>also</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> require ammunition, instead their use is limited by the replenishing energy gauge. Link's total life energy can be increased by collecting heart pieces. His weapons can be upgraded by completing a side quest that involves searching for small hidden creatures and returning them to their parent. Link can also participate in several minigames to earn rupees, Hyrule's currency.|$|E

5|$|The {{government}} of Malaysia in 2007 outlawed {{usage of the}} term Allah in any other but Muslim contexts, but the Malayan High Court in 2009 revoked the law, ruling that it was unconstitutional. While Allah had been used for the Christian God in Malay {{for more than four}} centuries, the contemporary controversy was triggered by usage of Allah by the Roman Catholic newspaper The Herald. The government appealed the court ruling, and the High Court suspended implementation of its verdict until the appeal was heard. In October 2013, the court ruled in favor of the government's ban. In early 2014, the Malaysian government confiscated more than 300 bibles for using the word to refer to the Christian God in Peninsular Malaysia. However, the use of Allah is not prohibited in the two Malaysian state of Sabah and Sarawak. The main reason it is not prohibited in these two states is that usage has been long-established and local Alkitab (Bibles) have been widely distributed freely in East Malaysia without restrictions for years. Both states <b>also</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> have similar Islamic state laws as those in West Malaysia.|$|E
