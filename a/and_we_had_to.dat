You were too unlucky when we played them, today he was man of the match. But {{football}} can be like that. Sometimes you can be at the bottom and then be a hero again. I just had a feeling. I'm a great believer that when you have the right attitude everything else follows. He had a good run after the World Cup but then he made some mistakes <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> support him. The squad get on very well. There was no finger-pointing after that game.

Morrison commented of Them: [...] "Them were never meant to be on Top of the Pops. I mean, miming? lip syncing? We used to laugh at that programme, think it was a joke. Then we were on it ourselves.

500|$|The ending was {{altered by}} the writers; the protagonist chooses a {{completely}} different girl in the film {{than the one he}} selects in the novel. Rye was concerned about the reactions of viewers who had read the novel, and it took Gowariker a while to convince him to agree. The writers were highly impressed and relieved by the characters' fine detailing in the novel, adding: [...] "The written matter was very strong <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> just get a few layers on that." [...] While writing the screenplay, Mehta and Gowariker decided to have one song for each zodiac sign to bring out the personality of each sign and its related girl. They had to write each character with different nuances. The title of the film is taken from a fictional book, What's Your Raashee?, about the compatibility between the sun signs, which the protagonist reads in the film.|$|E
