5|$|This tranquility {{lasted until}} 542/543 {{when the great}} plague arrived in Africa and caused many casualties, {{especially}} {{among members of the}} army. In addition, in early 543 the Moors in Byzacena became restive. Solomon executed the brother of the chieftain Antalas, whom he held responsible for the disturbances, and ceased the subsidies granted to Antalas, alienating the powerful and hitherto loyal chieftain. At the same time, Solomon's nephew Sergius, newly named governor of Tripolitania as a token of Emperor Justinian's gratitude (along with his brother Cyrus in the Pentapolis), caused the outbreak of hostilities with the tribal confederation of the Leuathae when his men killed 80 of their leaders at a banquet. Although in a subsequent battle near Leptis Magna he was victorious, in early 544 Sergius was forced to travel to Carthage and seek his uncle's aid. The rebellion spread quickly from Tripolitania to Byzacena, where Antalas joined it. Joined by his three nephews, Solomon marched against the Moors as they assembled, meeting them near Theveste. Last-minute diplomatic overtures to the Leuathae failed, and the two armies clashed at Cillium, on the border of Numidia and Byzacena. The Byzantine army was riven by disunity, with many soldiers refusing to fight or doing so only reluctantly. The contemporary poet Flavius Cresconius Corippus even accused Guntharis of treason, alleging that he withdrew from the line with his troops, causing a general and disorderly Byzantine retreat. Solomon and his bodyguard stood their ground and resisted but <b>at</b> <b>last</b> <b>they</b> were forced to retreat. Solomon's horse stumbled and fell in a ravine, wounding its rider. With the aid of his guards, Solomon remounted, but they were quickly overcome and slain.|$|E
25|$|Retreating across Westchester County, Haslet's men won {{a victory}} over a corps of Loyalists at Mamaroneck, New York. At White Plains, on October 28, 1776, the Delaware Regiment again fought with Colonel William Smallwood's Marylanders, {{reinforcing}} militia placed on the strategic Chatterton's Hill. The local militia fled under the British attack, but Haslet and Smallwood fought on until, <b>at</b> <b>last,</b> <b>they</b> too yielded the ground. The Battle of White Plains was another British victory, {{but because of the}} difficulty in taking Chatterton's Hill, the price was great and the reward to the British was little.|$|E
500|$|... "Miss Millie," [...] {{always a}} {{champion}} of southern traditions, was a woman of powerful personality, commanding presence, and fearlessly outspoken opinions; she was known widely for the speeches she delivered in hoop skirts. For all her decorum, she seemed to enjoy the protracted battles over the plaster goats that stood {{at the end of}} the dormitory's long veranda. The college boys periodically painted these animals in their school colors, red and black. <b>At</b> <b>last</b> <b>they</b> were broken when the boys attempted to hide them; some of the former belles of Lucy Cobb still cherish pieces of the goats as souvenirs.|$|E

500|$|The Just So Stories {{began as}} bedtime stories told to his {{daughter}} [...] "Effie" [...] when the first three were published in a children’s magazine, a year before her death, Kipling explained: [...] "in the evening there were stories meant to put Effie to sleep, and you {{were not allowed to}} alter those by one single little word. They had to be told just so; or Effie would wake up and put back the missing sentence. So <b>at</b> <b>last</b> <b>they</b> came to be like charms, all three of them,—the whale tale, the camel tale, and the rhinoceros tale." ...|$|E
500|$|Abbo {{named one}} of Edmund's killers as Hinguar, who can {{probably}} be identified with Ivarr inn beinlausi (Ivar the Boneless), son of Ragnar Lodbrok. After describing the horrific manner of Edmund's death, the Passio continued the story. [...] His severed head was thrown into the wood. As Edmund's followers went seeking, calling out [...] "Where are you, friend?" [...] the head answered, [...] "Here, here, here," [...] until <b>at</b> <b>last</b> <b>they</b> found it, clasped between a wolf's paws, protected from other animals and uneaten. The villagers then praised God and the wolf that served him. It walked tamely beside them, before vanishing back into the forest.|$|E

2500|$|Operating again off the Spanish coast, on September 12, 1817 he sent {{a letter}} to the {{president}} of the Cadiz Consulate where he stated that [...] "If the Spanish government had worked with me as required by right reason and the law of the people, and at the same time Spanish recognized the independence of Buenos Aires, I never would have taken up arms against your nation.

2500|$|There were {{descriptions}} of Dashnak forces taking to looting, burning and killing in the Muslim {{sections of the}} city. According to Peter Hopkirk, [...] "Armenians, seeing that <b>at</b> <b>last</b> <b>they</b> had their ancient foes on the run, were now out for vengeance". In Balakhany and Ramany districts of Baku, the majority of Muslim workers stayed at their places and avoided the battles, while the peasants were not moved to join the anti-Soviet rebels. The Persian workers remained passive during all of the fighting, refusing to take sides. Left-wing Muslim leaders, including those of SRs and Hümmet Party, such as Narimanov, Azizbekov, Bunyat Sardarov and Kazi-Magomed Aghasiyev, supported the Soviet forces During the battles, Bolsheviks decided to use artillery against the Azerbaijani residential quarters in the city.|$|E

2500|$|It {{was about}} three in the {{afternoon}} that Rupert, to his surprise, found that [...] "the sturdy sons of freedom", as the local historians Hutton and Guest called them, were determined to fight. This determination was opposed to {{the opinion of the}} Parliamentarians—not only of the military, but also of the civilians—the ministers of Birmingham, and the leading men of the town; but the [...] "middle and inferior sort" [...] of people, especially those that bore arms, insisted on resisting, so <b>at</b> <b>last</b> <b>they</b> all resolved to fight. Finding such was their case, Rupert gave the order to attack their defences at once. The defences were only a bank of earth, behind which the handful of musketeers was placed. As the Royalists advanced they received so heavy a fire that on reaching the works they could not stand up against it and had to retire. A second attempt met with a similar repulse.|$|E
2500|$|Dan, {{taken for}} the Irish priest, directs {{the people of}} the West and North of the island in how to drive out the {{dampness}} that causes the sickness. Dan is called to his dying uncle's bedside, where the Deemster admits his sin of having driven Ewan to the confrontation with Dan, only after which he realises Dan's true identity. He goes to meet his father and they are reconciled. With the sickness defeated, Dan returns to his hut near Cregneash without having seen Mona, preferring solitude to the new-found adulation of the Manx people. However, by this time he has fallen ill and is close to death when Mona arrives, having followed him south with the official invitation to become Deemster. <b>At</b> <b>last</b> <b>they</b> are reunited and she is able to spend his last few minutes with him as he says his prayer once more, with her help, ending by asking God to [...] "deliver us from evil, Amen.” ...|$|E
2500|$|<b>At</b> <b>last</b> <b>they</b> {{reached the}} base of the final tower. [...] "We stood," [...] wrote Gorret, [...] "in a place that was almost comfortable. Although it was not more than two yards wide, and the slope was one of 75 percent, we gave it all kinds of {{pleasant}} names : the corridor, the gallery, the railroad, , [...] " [...] They imagined all difficulties were at an end; but a rock couloir, which they had hitherto not observed, lay between them and the final bit of ridge, where progress would be perfectly easy. It would have been unwise for all four to descend into the couloir, because they did not know where to fix the rope that would be needed on their return. Time pressed: it was necessary to reduce the numbers of the party; Gorret sacrificed himself, and Meynet stopped with him. Very soon afterwards Carrel and Bich were finally on the top. Meanwhile Giordano at Breuil was writing in his diary as follows: [...] "Splendid weather; at 9.30 saw Carrel and his men on the Shoulder, after that saw nothing more of them. Then much mist about the summit. Lifted a bit about 3.30, and we saw our flag on the western summit of the Matterhorn." ...|$|E

2500|$|The twins {{continued}} east on the Trail of the Rainbow {{until they}} came to a narrow pass between two high cliffs. [...] The cliffs pulled apart as they approached.

We go to him with a message from Spider Woman." [...] "Tell us the message," [...] called a voice. [...] The boys held out the naayééʼ atsʼos and sang the song Spider Woman had taught them.
