5|$|Keith Foulcher, an Australian {{professor}} of Indonesian literature and language, {{writes that the}} poems published in Poedjangga Baroe were structurally based in reimaginings of traditional forms {{with an emphasis on}} aesthetic diction; thematically, he writes, the poems tended to deal with either lofty goals or <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> loneliness in the midst of natural beauty. According to literary documentarian H.B. Jassin, the poems, though they adapted Western forms and Indonesian diction, retained Malay rhythms.|$|E

5|$|Asumi's {{elementary}} and middle school classmate Shinnosuke Fuchuya also enters the academy much to her surprise. He defended Asumi from ridicule by other classmates throughout their childhood despite occasionally teasing her as well, and {{it has been suggested that}} he sees her as a romantic interest. The two eventually befriend three other students in the astronaut training program. Shu Suzuki, who is named student representative for the astronaut program, has an easygoing personality. He wears a distinctive face by shaving his eyebrows as a symbol of defiance against his father. Kei Oumi befriends Asumi during the academy's entrance examination and is portrayed with an outgoing personality and <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> loyalty toward her friends. Marika Ukita initially responds coldly toward gestures of friendship, but she moves into Asumi's dormitory following an argument with her father. The five students later make a promise to complete the astronaut program together as their friendship grows stronger. After three years in the astronaut program, Asumi is chosen out of eleven remaining students to take part in Japan's second human spaceflight mission, making her, at the age of eighteen, the youngest person to go into space.|$|E

50|$|Another large {{advantage}} of PBL {{is that it}} encourages students to gain <b>a</b> <b>deeper</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> understanding.

25|$|Ó Sé was renowned as a tough defender {{and tight}} marker, a trait best {{exemplified}} {{in the fact}} that he conceded just one solitary point in ten All-Ireland final appearances.

25|$|The First Great Awakening was {{an evangelical}} and {{revitalization}} movement that swept through Protestant Europe and British America, especially the American colonies in the 1730s and 1740s, leaving a permanent impact on American Protestantism. It resulted from powerful preaching that gave listeners {{a sense of}} deep personal revelation of their need of salvation by Jesus Christ. Pulling away from ritual, ceremony, sacramentalism and hierarchy, it made Christianity intensely personal to the average person by fostering <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> spiritual conviction and redemption, and by encouraging introspection {{and a commitment to}} a new standard of personal morality.|$|E
25|$|The {{interview}} {{and the book}} caused critics to accuse him of hypocrisy for having hidden this part of his past, while simultaneously being a strong voice for ethics and morality in the public debate. The book itself was also praised for its depictions of the German postwar generation and the social and moral development of a nation burdened simultaneously by destruction and <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> guilt. Throughout the memoir Grass plays with the frailty of memory, for which the layers of the onion are a metaphor. Grass second-guesses his own memories, throws his own autobiographical statements into doubt and questions whether the person inhabiting his past was really him. This struggle with memory comes to represent the struggle of the German people {{during the same period}} with Germany's Nazi past.|$|E
50|$|Outdoor {{education}} {{is often used}} {{as a means to}} create <b>a</b> <b>deeper</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> place for people in a community. <b>Sense</b> <b>of</b> place is manifested through the understanding and connection that one has with the area in which they reside. <b>Sense</b> <b>of</b> place is an important aspect of environmentalism as well as environmental justice because it makes the importance of sustaining a particular ecosystem that much more personal to an individual.|$|R

Like most Russian realists of his times, Repin often based his works on dramatic conflicts, drawn from contemporary life or history. He also used mythological images with a strong sense of purpose; some of his religious paintings are among his greatest.|$|E
25|$|The royal couple's murder {{upset and}} shocked most of Europe, but was met enthusiastically at home.

Austria-Hungary declared its neutrality on the matter, but privately, policymakers in Vienna expressed hope that Peter's accession would have a placating effect. The United Kingdom demanded that the chief conspirators be severely punished, and when the Royal Serbian Government neglected to carry out this request, the British severed all diplomatic ties. Several other European nations followed in the United Kingdom's footsteps and severed ties as well. Peter lacked the power or authority to punish the conspirators.

In spite of this, Singin' and Swingin has been called [...] "a love song to Angelou's son". Just as she changes her name as the story progresses, so does Guy, who becomes an intelligent, sensitive boy {{in the pages of}} this book. As Guy grows, so does his mother; Hagen stated that this growth moves Angelou's story forward. When Angelou discovers how deeply their separation injures Guy, she leaves the Porgy and Bess tour before it ends, at great personal cost. By the end of the book, their bond is deepened and she promises never to leave him again. As Hagen states, Maya embraces the importance of motherhood, just as she had done {{at the end of her}} previous autobiographies.|$|E
