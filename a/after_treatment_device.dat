40|$|There is {{a strong}} {{competition}} among automotive manufacturers to reduce the radiated noise levels. One important source is the engine exhaust where the main noise control strategy is by using efficient mufflers. Stricter vehicle noise regulations combined with various exhaust gas cleaning devices, removing space for traditional mufflers, are also creating new challenges. Thus, {{it is crucial to}} have efficient models and tools to design vehicle exhaust systems. In addition the need to reduce CO 2 emissions puts requirements on the losses and pressure drop in exhaust systems. In this thesis a number of problems relevant for the design of modern exhaust systems for vehicles are addressed. First the modelling of perforated mufflers is investigated. Fifteen different configurations were modeled and compared to measurements using 1 D models. The limitations of using 1 D models due to 3 D or non-plane wave effects are investigated. It is found that for all the cases investigated the 1 D model is valid at least up to half the plane wave region. But with flow present, i. e., as in the real application the 3 D effects are much less important and then normally a 1 D model works well. Another interesting area that is investigated is the acoustic performance of after treatment devices. Diesel engines produce harmful exhaust emissions and high exhaust noise levels. One way of mitigating both exhaust emissions and noise is via the use of after treatment devices such as Catalytic Converters (CC), Selective Catalytic Reducers (SCR), Diesel Oxidation Catalysts (DOC), and Diesel Particulate Filters (DPF). The objective of this investigation is to characterize and simulate the acoustic performance of different types of filters so that maximum benefit can be achieved. A number of <b>after</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>device</b> configurations for trucks were selected and investigated. Finally, addressing the muffler design constraints, i. e., concerning space and pressure drop, a muffler optimization problem is formulated achieving the optimum muffler design through calculating the acoustic properties using an optimization technique. A shape optimization approach is presented for different muffler configurations, and the acoustic results are compared against optimum designs from the literature obtained using different optimization methods as well as design targets.

40|$|The {{increased}} use of the diesel engine in the passenger car, truck and bus market is due to high efficiency and lower fuel costs. This growing market share has brought with it several environmental issues for instance soot particle emission. Different technologies to remove the soot have been developed and are normally based {{on some kind of}} soot trap. In particular for automobiles the use of diesel particulate traps or filters (DPF:s) based on ceramic monolithic honeycombs are becoming a standard. This new exhaust system component will affect the acoustics and also work as a muffler. To properly design exhaust systems acoustic models for diesel particulate traps are needed. The first part of this thesis considers the modelling of sound transmission and attenuation for traps that consist of narrow channels separated by porous walls. This work has resulted in two new models an approximate 1 -D model and a more complete model based on the governing equations for a visco-thermal fluid. Both models are expressed as acoustic 2 -ports which makes them suitable for implementation in acoustic software for exhaust systems analysis. The models have been validated by experiments on clean filters at room temperature with flow and the agreement is good. In addition the developed filter models have been used to set up a model for a complete <b>After</b> <b>Treatment</b> <b>Device</b> (ATD) for a passenger car. The unit consisted of a chamber which contained both a diesel trap and a Catalytic Converter (CC). This complete model was also validated by experiments at room temperature. The second part of the thesis focuses on experimental techniques for plane wave decomposition in ducts with flow. Measurements in ducts with flow are difficult since flow noise (turbulence) can strongly influence the data. The difficulties are also evident from the lack of good published in-duct measurement data, e. g., muffler transmission loss data, for Mach-numbers above 0. 1 - 0. 2. The first paper {{in this part of the}} thesis investigates the effect of different microphone mountings and signal processing techniques for suppressing flow noise. The second paper investigates in particular flow noise suppression techniques in connection with the measurement of acoustic 2 -ports. Finally, the third paper suggests a general wave decomposition procedure using microphone arrays and over-determination. This procedure can be used to determine the full plane wave data, e. g., the wave amplitudes and complex wave numbers k+ and k-. The new procedure has been applied to accurately measure the sound radiation from an unflanged pipe with flow. This problem is of interest for correctly determining the radiated power from an engine exhaust outlet. The measured data for the reflection coefficient and end correction have been compared with the theory of Munt [33] and the agreement is excellent. The measurements also produced data for the damping value (imaginary part of the wavenumber) which were compared to a model suggested by Howe [13]. The agreement is good for a normalized boundary layer thickness less than 30 - 4...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the impact of}} two exhaust <b>after</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>devices,</b> an oxidation catalytic converter and a diesel particulate filter, on the particulate emissions of a heavy-duty diesel engine, the emphasis being on diesel particulate composition and size distribution. The analysis showed that the catalytic converter did not alter the size distribution significantly, except for an increased production of nanosized particles below 30 n miles in mean diameter. On the other hand, the ceramic monolith wall flow filter reduced the emitted particle number up to 100 times. The results again indicated that a diesel particulate filter can also {{increase the number of}} nanosized particles. Further investigations, however, revealed that the formation of nanosized particles downstream of the oxidation catalytic converters and diesel particulate filters, respectively, is biased by inadequate sampling conditions.

This constitutes Part II of a literature review on ultrafine (UF) particles, with industrial and power plant emissions covered in Part I.

This was followed by a discussion on the emission levels of UF particles and their characteristics as a function of vehicle technology, fuel used and <b>after</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>devices</b> applied.

40|$|The use of oxygenated bio-fuels like bio diesel and ethanol in {{combination}} with diesel is an effective measure to substitute renewable fuels and reduce particulate matter (PM) from in-use diesel vehicles. To study the fuel performance, three oxygenated blend fuel designs containing volumes of 15 % ethanol with cetane improver additive, 10 % ethanol with 10 % bio diesel and 15 % ethanol with 20 % bio diesel were formed. The physical stability of ethanol diesel blend is studied and phase separation is prevented by adding co solvents like Tetrahydrafuran and bio diesel. To meet stricter emission norms, now diesel engines are fitted with <b>after</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>devices.</b> This paper describes the engine and emission characteristics of the above blend fuels on a 4 cylinder, naturally aspirated light duty diesel engine fitted with diesel oxidation catalyst. The engine test results show that it is feasible to use these blends in diesel engines: the thermal efficiencies of the engine fueled by the blends are comparable with that fueled by diesel, with small increase in fuel consumption, due to the lower heating value of ethanol and bio diesel. The smoke emissions from the engine fueled by the blends are lower than that fueled by diesel owing to the increased oxygen content. The reduction is more at higher loads. The HC and CO emissions {{are found to be}} higher at lower loads due to the lower cetane number of ethanol. However, NO emissions depend on load conditions and blend contents...|$|R

Beside chemical composition of these particles, their physical attributes {{are considered to}} be critical in eliciting adverse health outcomes. This thesis provides valuable information on particle physico-chemical properties with special focus on physical parameters such as size distribution, volatility, effective density, fractal dimension, surface area etc. Particle effective density and fractal dimensions were measured near a gasoline and a mixed freeway with significant diesel fleet. Diesel vehicles emit higher fraction of low density chain agglomerates compared to gasoline vehicles. Particle density at a receptor site showed interesting diurnal trend with peaks during sunny afternoons. Overall, particles demonstrated an inverse relation between size and density. Particle volatility, an important parameter to infer exposure to commuters, was measured near a pure gasoline and diesel dominated mixed-traffic freeway. Diesel particulates were associated with higher content of non-volatiles than those generated from gasoline engines and correlated excellently with the refractory elemental carbon emissions. Particle mixing characteristics not only depend on the fleet composition but also on environmental factors. Thus, to investigate the effect of meteorological conditions on particle characteristics experimental campaigns were designed to capture seasonal and diurnal variability. Although the daytime seasonal influences on particle volatility were minimal, strong diurnal changes were observed during winter.; Finally, the physical characteristics of particles from diesel vehicles retrofitted with advanced emission control technologies were determined by controlled studies with a dynamomter set-up. These <b>after</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>devices</b> were efficient in removing solid particles, but were less effective in controlling volatile species which formed fresh nucleation mode particles. Particle volatility, density, surface diameter and extent of agglomeration were determined and compared with respect to a baseline vehicle.

The results showed that using a cold-weather and warm-weather water-fuel emulsion formulation reduced mass concentrations of elemental carbon (EC) by about 70 % and 85 %, respectively. The 20 % and 50 % soy biodiesel blends reduced EC by 49 % and 66 %, respectively. The reductions were slightly less pronounced for the 20 % and 50 % yellow grease biodiesel blends- 33 % and 56 %, respectively. EC concentrations were unaffected by using ultralow sulfur diesel in place of # 1 diesel. Use of the reformulated fuels did not substantially alter the concentrations of nitric oxide and carbon monoxide. However, a measurable increase in the nitrogen dioxide (NO 2) peak concentration was observed during the biodiesel tests. The ArvinMeritor (AM) fuel-burner DPF system with a palladium-catalyzed DOC reduced EC concentrations by 92 %. The diesel filter elements from Donaldson Co., Inc., and Filter Service & Testing Corp. reduced the EC concentration of the mine air by 92 % and 70 %, respectively. When the palladium-based DOC was used with the AM DPF, it raised the average and peak downstream NO 2 concentrations by a factor of three. Tests of the AM DPF system with a platinum-catalyzed DOC and CAP/ETG catalytic particulate oxidizer system had to be terminated because the elevated NO 2 concentrations threatened to overexpose the operator. The tests with only a selected DOC also resulted in increased NO 2 concentrations in mine air. " - NIOSHTIC- 2 by Aleksandar D. Bugarski, George H. Schnakenberg, Jr., Steven E. Mischler, James D.

We attribute this behavior {{to changes in the}} aluminum oxide barriers of the tunnel junctions. The good reproducibility of these effects with respect to the changes observed allows the proper annealing treatment to be used for post-process tuning of tunnel junction parameters. Also, the influence of the annealing treatment on the noise properties of the transistors at low frequency was investigated.

40|$|AIM: To {{evaluate}} the effectivity {{and safety of}} intravitreal injection of triamcinolone acetonide(TA) combined with retinal laser photocoagulation {{in the treatment of}} diabetic macular edema(DME). METHODS: Thirty-seven cases(55 eyes) with DME were selected and treated by intravitreal TA injection first and laser photocoagulation after three weeks, best-corrected visual acuity(BCVA), fundus examination and intraocular pressure(IOP) were examined before TA injection and 1 month, 3 and 6 months <b>after</b> <b>treatment,</b> optical coherence tomography(OCT), fundus fluorescein angiography(FFA) were examined 3 months <b>after</b> <b>treatment.</b> RESULTS: The average visual acuity was 0. 1627 ± 0. 1016, 0. 2743 ± 0. 1617, 0. 2615 ± 0. 1833 at preoperative, 3 and 6 months <b>after</b> <b>treatment.</b> The visual acuity <b>after</b> <b>treatment</b> was significantly improved than preoperative(P< 0. 01). The average macular thickness was 467. 5 ± 150. 9 μm, 272. 7 ± 120. 1 μm, 308. 1 ± 136. 2 μm at preoperative, 3 and 6 months <b>after</b> <b>treatment.</b> The macular thickness <b>after</b> <b>treatment</b> was significantly lower than preoperative(P< 0. 01). The macular area and related vascular fluorescein leakage was significantly reduced <b>after</b> <b>treatment.</b> CONCLUSION: The combination of triamcinolone acetonide intravitreous injection with retinal laser photocoagulation can be an effective method in the treatment of DME, visual acuity improved efficiency was best 3 months <b>after</b> <b>treatment...</b>|$|R
