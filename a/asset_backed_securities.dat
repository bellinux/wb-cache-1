We present a model of bank securitization in which security price together with liquid constraints create the incentive for banks to originate and sell <b>assets</b> <b>backed</b> <b>securities</b> to investors. Banks have a comparative advantage in locating and screening projects within their locality. Our results show that under the buyer’s market pricing mechanism the banks with different liquidity constraints can share the risk and the moral hazard problem is not serious; but under the seller’s market pricing mechanism the banks have the incentive to conduct strategic securitization and the moral hazard problem is serious. Our main idea has been supported by the subprime crisis broke in the US in 2007. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{optimality}} of securitized debt when information acquisition is endogenous and exible. A seller designs an <b>asset</b> <b>backed</b> <b>security</b> and a buyer decides whether {{to buy it}} to provide liquidity. Rather than treating the seller as an insider endowed with information, we assume no information asymmetry before bargaining. The buyer has an expertise in acquiring information of the fundamental {{in the manner of}} rational inattention. She collects the most relevant information determined by the "shape " of the security, which may endogenously generate adverse selection. Hence, the seller deliberately designs the security in order to induce the buyer to acquire information least harmful to the seller's interest. Issuing securitized debt is uniquely optimal in raising liquidity, regardless of the stochastic interdependence of underlying assets and the allocation of bargaining powers. Fixed aggregate risk and homogeneous information cost are the key factors driving the results...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} {{optimality}} of debt through {{the interaction between}} security design and information acquisition. An impatient seller designs an <b>asset</b> <b>backed</b> <b>security</b> and a buyer decides whether to buy it to provide liquidity. Facing different securities, the buyer has incentives to acquire information from {{different aspects of the}} fundamental, which in turn affects security design. Specifically, the buyer benefits from information acquisition {{at the expense of the}} seller through adverse selection. The seller hence deliberately designs the security to induce the buyer to acquire the information least harmful to the seller’s interest. This interaction is flexible since securities can be designed in arbitrary ways. Flexible information acquisition is introduced to capture this flexible interaction and debt is shown to be uniquely optimal. Compared with the security design literature, we neither restrict coverage to non-decreasing securities nor impose various distributional assumptions on the fundamenta...|$|R

"Flexible " means that people choose {{not only the}} quantity but also the qualitative nature of their information. This is modeled by rational inattention where information acquisition incurs a cost proportional to reduction of entropy. Hence, people only collect information most relevant to their payo¤s but be rationally inattentive to other aspects. In strategic environments, people’s incentives to acquire information are shaped by their payo ¤ structures, which depend on others’ strategies.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} {{the effect of the}} Asset-Backed Security market on the monetary policy, especially the money stock. When an asset securitization scheme is introduced, the effect which gives to the money stock is decided by depending on the households' cash demand. In the case when the cash/deposit ratio increases, the money stock decreases temporarily, but if transaction ends and settled its level is recovered. On the contrary, money stock increases when the households are not actualized cash need, by transmitting their bank deposit. At the glance, the securitization process looks the simple property transaction between the households and the originator. Because of that, it is tend to think that there are no special effects onto the money stock. But, due to the movement of the cash in the banking sector, which accompanies the transaction of property, the bank has to change their behavior. All of these acts as the transmission mechanism between the <b>asset</b> <b>backed</b> <b>security</b> market and the whole monetary system...|$|R
40|$|The {{credit markets}} {{experienced}} fundamental changes {{during the last}} two decades. Corporate debt volumes have expanded rapidly making such debt one of the largest asset classes in financial markets. Structured credit products revolutionized banking practices and transformed the framework of credit risk management. Credit risk modeling, valuation and rating have, in consequence, been extensively studied. Many issues remain controversial for both academics and industry practitioners, however, especially {{in the wake of the}} recent financial crisis. This thesis contributes to the existing literature in four ways. First, a new approach is introduced for jointly estimating rating-specific bond spread term structures. The approach achieves fitting accuracy comparable to the more standard extended Nelson-Siegel technique meanwhile yielding well-behaved and stable term structures which are appropriately ordered for different rating classes. Second, a ‘clinical’ study is presented of the evolution of <b>Asset</b> <b>Backed</b> <b>Security</b> (ABS) valuations conditional on ratings during two crisis periods, namely the 2007 - 2009 crisis and the earlier collapse of ABS secured against Manufactured Housing loans of 2002 - 2003. The study focusses on the market’s reactions to different pricing factors in crisis time including liquidity and risk premiums. Third, we examine predictable fluctuations in agency ratings behavior over the business cycle and propose simple, tractable ways of parameterizing time-varying rating transition matrices. Fourth, we examine the dependence of corporate bond market risk premiums on industrial sector. The analysis sheds light on the hypothesis that the cross-sectional pattern of risk premiums reflects the degree to which bond issuers operate in cyclically sensitive industries. By adjusting sectorspecific spreads for time-varying and sector specific expected losses and for liquidity, we show that spreads and, even more so, risk premiums are related to the cyclicality of the obligor’s industry.

Its activities were much like a very simplified form of banking, although with less than half the leverage of a traditional bank and without any exposure to interest rate or foreign currency exchange rate risk. However, due to the impact on the financial markets stemming from the sub-prime mortgage market in the United States of America, on the value of <b>asset</b> <b>backed</b> <b>securities</b> generally, despite Sigma having no exposure to US subprime mortgages, there was a [...] "run" [...] by short term lenders to all non-banks.

Following an auction in December 2008 the values achieved fell far short of the amounts required to satisfy the secured creditors, let alone the unsecured creditors.

Moreover, the spread is not statistically significant between Retail Mortgage Backed Securities and Commercial <b>Asset</b> <b>backed</b> <b>securities</b> when the rating is high, but is higher for Commercial <b>Asset</b> <b>Backed</b> <b>Securities</b> if the rating is low.
