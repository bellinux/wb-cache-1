5000|$|Following {{extensive}} touring throughout 2011 {{to promote}} their second studio album, American Tragedy, and their first remix album, American Tragedy Redux, Charlie Scene announced plans to begin a third studio album in late November 2011. The announcement came after {{the conclusion of the}} band's World War III Tour with Asking Alexandria. Charlie Scene stated that the band will begin writing and recording demos while on the Buried Alive Tour with Avenged Sevenfold and begin recording once the tour concludes in December 2011. He also stated the album will sound more similar to Swan Songs than American Tragedy. Commenting on the difference in recording this time around, he stated, [...] "I would say that this time the label gave us full creative control. I think it's going to be more like 'Swan Songs' than 'American Tragedy.' It'll be a mixture of both; I mean, <b>we</b> all grow <b>as</b> artists, <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>older,</b> and we've been doing it a long time so I think it'll be more like 'Swan Songs' and I think the fans are gonna like it a lot. It has been reported that member Charlie Scene sings the chorus instead of lead singer, Danny, in a song featured on the album titled 'Rain' with himself and Johnny 3 Tears taking control of the rapping.|$|R

50|$|Issues of {{emotional}} regulations affect us especially in our later life. When people get older their motivation increases {{to take out}} the emotional meaning in life, instead of expanding their emotional boundaries. Things such as social losses and health changes increase <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>older.</b> However, people tend to increase their emotional regulation skills as they age, which can lead to certain other emotional problems. As we age, our autonomic nervous system decreases, yet emotional experiences do not change. Adults have several motivations for regulating emotions—including hedonic motivation (pain/pleasure), conforming to social roles, facilitating task or role performance, managing self-presentation, and regulating the feelings of others.|$|E

5000|$|In 2006, The Eldering Institute {{began using}} the word [...] "Eldering" [...] to {{distinguish}} [...] "wisdom in action"—with the focus on action.

50|$|Rather {{than seeing}} aging as {{a loss of}} {{functionality}} <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>older,</b> this theory defines aging as any change in an organism over time, {{as evidenced by the}} fact that if all chemical reactions in the body were stopped, no change, and thus no aging, would occur. Since the most important change in an organism through time is the chemical reactions that result in a single cell developing into a multicellular organism, whatever controls these chemical reactions that regulate cell growth, development, and death, is believed to control aging. The theory argues that these cellular changes are directed by reproductive hormones of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis (HPG axis). Receptors for reproductive hormones (such as estrogens, progestagens, androgens and gonadotropins) {{have been found to be}} present in all tissues of the body. Thus, HPG axis hormones normally promote growth and development of the organism early in life in order to achieve reproduction. Hormones levels then begin to change in men around age 30 and more abruptly in women when they reach menopause, around age 50. When the HPG axis becomes unbalanced, cellular growth and development is dysregulated, and cell death and dysfunction can occur, both of which can initiate senescence, the accumulated damage to cells, tissues, and organs that occurs with the passage of time and that is associated with functional loss during aging.|$|E
