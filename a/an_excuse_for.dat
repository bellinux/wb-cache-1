5|$|Under {{the rule}} of Isma'il Pasha, the {{grandson}} of Muhammad Ali, major public works projects were initiated {{with the aim of}} transforming Cairo into a European styled city. These projects, at first funded by a boom in the cotton industry, eventually racked up a massive debt which was held by the British, providing <b>an</b> <b>excuse</b> <b>for</b> the British to occupy Egypt in 1882 after having pushed out Isma'il Pasha in 1879.|$|E
5|$|On August 15, 2011, {{there was}} more {{disruption}} in service at BART stations in downtown San Francisco. The San Francisco Examiner reported that the protests were {{a result of the}} shootings, including that of Oscar Grant. Demonstrations were announced by several activists, which eventually resulted in disruptions to service. The protesters have stated that they did not want their protests to results in closures, and accused the BART police of using the protests as <b>an</b> <b>excuse</b> <b>for</b> disruption. Protesters vowed to continue their protests every Monday until their demands were met.|$|E
5|$|The {{employees}} pursue Michael, and {{he confesses}} that {{he created the}} rumors to conceal the one true rumor. Andy fears {{that it might be}} the one about him. The employees urge Michael to tell them which one is true, but just as Michael is about to give in, Jim announces that Pam is actually pregnant to save Stanley. Michael denies it, but Pam shows her baby's ultrasound picture to prove it. Later, while Michael discusses her pregnancy with Jim and Pam in his office, Stanley's wife Teri returns Michael's call from earlier. He picks up the phone with the intention of making <b>an</b> <b>excuse</b> <b>for</b> his earlier call so as to not tip her off, but he accidentally calls her Cynthia twice before Jim hangs up the phone for him. Teri had already been suspicious of Stanley and Cynthia, so Michael calling her Cynthia is enough for her to figure out what is going on. Michael, feeling guilty, watches from his office window as Stanley attacks Michael's car with a tire iron in a fit of rage. At the end of the episode, the three interns discuss what they have learned at Dunder Mifflin, which they essentially reveal was nothing.|$|E

50|$|In {{the early}} twentieth century, {{kleptomania}} was more <b>a</b> legal <b>excuse</b> <b>for</b> self-indulgent haut bourgeois ladies than a valid psychiatric aliment by French psychiatrists.|$|R

25|$|European {{and other}} world leaders have {{expressed}} their {{concerns over the}} situation in Turkey, with many of them warning Erdoğan {{not to use the}} coup attempt as <b>an</b> <b>excuse</b> <b>for</b> crackdown against his opponents.|$|E
25|$|While Lord Sugar {{recognized}} that Adam hadn't been feeling too {{good on the}} task, during the first day, Zoe remarked how she wouldn't accept illness as <b>an</b> <b>excuse</b> <b>for</b> not working, not being fully aware of how unwell her teammate was.|$|E

25|$|Decades of {{communications}} between the Europeans and the Mongols, towards {{the possibility of}} creating a Franco-Mongol alliance, had not produced any noticeable result, and attempts to raise a new army from Italy merely gave <b>an</b> <b>excuse</b> <b>for</b> the final attack by the Muslims.|$|E
25|$|In Lenin's secret {{letter to}} the Politburo, Lenin {{explains}} that the famine provides an opportunity against the church. Richard Pipes argued that the famine was used politically as <b>an</b> <b>excuse</b> <b>for</b> the Bolshevik leadership to persecute the Orthodox Church, which held significant sway {{over much of the}} peasant populace.|$|E
25|$|The {{pleasure}} of hating, like a poisonous mineral, eats {{into the heart}} of religion, and turns it to rankling spleen and bigotry; it makes patriotism <b>an</b> <b>excuse</b> <b>for</b> carrying fire, pestilence, and famine into other lands: it leaves to virtue nothing but the spirit of censoriousness, and a narrow, jealous, inquisitorial watchfulness over the actions and motives of others.|$|E

25|$|The {{work was}} popular among critics, {{with more than}} 42 commentaries written on it. The style of his work, with cantos 4 to 9 having no {{relation}} to the plot but instead being merely <b>an</b> <b>excuse</b> <b>for</b> beautiful descriptive poetry, was influential on all later Sanskrit epic poetry, in which the action was often ignored entirely.|$|E
25|$|It {{incorporates}} reform {{ideas from}} social feminism, and combines {{the concepts of}} maternalism and feminism. It was a widespread philosophy among well-to-do women in the British Empire, particularly Canada, from the late 19th century until after World War I (1914–18). The concept was attacked by later feminists as accepting the paternalist view of society and providing <b>an</b> <b>excuse</b> <b>for</b> inequality.|$|E
25|$|From among American outlaws, McNelly's {{greatest}} rival was Texas gunman King Fisher and {{his band}} of outlaws. Although notable as rustlers, Fisher's band rarely raided US civilian populations, concentrating more on rustling cattle from their Mexican counterparts across the border. This added to tensions among the Mexican population, and gave <b>an</b> <b>excuse</b> <b>for</b> Mexican bandits to raid in the United States.|$|E

25|$|Vartan's concerts {{were said}} to be <b>an</b> <b>excuse</b> <b>for</b> some of the first violent acts of rockers in French theatres. There is a Sylvie Vartan rose variety and a toy factory named after her. The Mattel toy company {{designed}} a dummy model after her body. In 2005, the singer was appointed as WHO Goodwill Ambassador for Maternal and Child Health in the European Region.|$|E
25|$|The {{peak of the}} X Club's {{influence}} was from 1873 to 1885 as Hooker, Spottiswoode and Huxley were Presidents of the Royal Society in succession. Spencer resigned in 1889 after a dispute with Huxley over state support for science. After 1892 it was just <b>an</b> <b>excuse</b> <b>for</b> the surviving members to meet. Hooker died in 1911, and Lubbock (now Lord Avebury) was the last surviving member.|$|E
25|$|Maurice {{was murdered}} on 27 November 602 (some say 23 November). It {{is said that}} the deposed emperor was forced to watch his six sons {{executed}} before he was beheaded himself. Empress Constantina and her three daughters were spared and sent to a monastery. The Persian King Khosrau II used this coup and {{the murder of his}} patron as <b>an</b> <b>excuse</b> <b>for</b> a renewed war against the Empire.|$|E

25|$|Taft {{condemned}} the postwar Nuremberg Trials as victor's justice under {{ex post facto}} laws, in which the people who won the war were the prosecutors, the judges, and the alleged victims, {{all at the same}} time. Taft {{condemned the}} trials as a violation of the most basic principles of American justice and internationally accepted standards in favor of a politicized version of justice in which court proceedings became <b>an</b> <b>excuse</b> <b>for</b> vengeance against the defeated.|$|E
25|$|When the Germans invaded France, Baker left Paris {{and went}} to the Château des Milandes, her home in the Dordogne département in the south of France. She housed people who were eager to help the Free French effort led by Charles de Gaulle and {{supplied}} them with visas. As an entertainer, Baker had <b>an</b> <b>excuse</b> <b>for</b> moving around Europe, visiting neutral nations such as Portugal, as well as some in South America. She carried information for transmission to England, about airfields, harbors, and German troop concentrations in the West of France. Notes were written in invisible ink on Baker's sheet music.|$|E
25|$|Cham Albanians {{claim the}} {{returning}} of the Greek citizenship, {{as a first}} phase in order to resolve the Cham issue. They are reported not to have as a primary issue the regaining of the properties, but the citizenship, because this is seen by Chams as <b>an</b> <b>excuse</b> <b>for</b> their suffering. They argue that the remove of their citizenship was a collective punishment, when even the Greek courts have charged {{only a minority of}} Chams for alleged crimes. They have asked the Greek government to have a dual citizenship, a policy followed by Greece {{in the case of the}} Greek minority in Albania.|$|E
