5|$|There are 57 {{nucleotide}} substitutions which {{distinguish the}} <b>attenuated</b> Sabin 1 strain from its virulent parent (the Mahoney serotype), two nucleotide substitutions attenuate the Sabin 2 strain, and 10 substitutions {{are involved in}} attenuating the Sabin 3 strain. The primary attenuating factor common to all three Sabin vaccines is a mutation located in the virus's internal ribosome entry site (IRES) which alters stem-loop structures, and reduces the ability of poliovirus to translate its RNA template within the host cell. The <b>attenuated</b> poliovirus in the Sabin vaccine replicates very efficiently in the gut, the primary site of infection and replication, but is unable to replicate efficiently within nervous system tissue.|$|E

The ability of THC to <b>attenuate</b> the expression of previously established lithium induced conditioned sickness behavior in Suncus was also examined. Although unconditioned sickness behavior was displayed by both rats and shrews, THC did not <b>attenuate</b> this behavior in either species. However, THC did <b>attenuate</b> conditioned retching in the Suncus murinus. These results {{are the first to}} show the attenuation of conditioned sickness in Suncus by THC. They also experimentally verify anecdotal reports from chemotherapy patients that THC <b>attenuates</b> conditioned or ‘anticipatory’ nausea andlor vomiting (ANV).

5|$|Oral {{polio vaccine}} (OPV) is an <b>attenuated</b> vaccine, {{produced}} by {{the passage of the}} virus through non-human cells at a sub-physiological temperature, which produces spontaneous mutations in the viral genome. Oral polio vaccines were developed by several groups, one of which was led by Albert Sabin. Other groups, led by Hilary Koprowski and H.R. Cox, developed their own <b>attenuated</b> vaccine strains. In 1958, the National Institutes of Health created a special committee on live polio vaccines. The various vaccines were carefully evaluated for their ability to induce immunity to polio, while retaining a low incidence of neuropathogenicity in monkeys. Large-scale clinical trials performed in the Soviet Union in late 1950s to early 1960s by Mikhail Chumakov and his colleagues demonstrated safety and high efficacy of the vaccine. Based on these results, the Sabin strains were chosen for worldwide distribution.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. {{experienced}} {{an outbreak of}} 58,000 and 35,000 polio cases, respectively, up from a typical number of some 20,000 a year. Amid this U.S. polio epidemic, millions of dollars were invested in finding and marketing a polio vaccine by commercial interests, including Lederle Laboratories in New York {{under the direction of}} H. R. Cox. Also working at Lederle was Polish-born virologist and immunologist Hilary Koprowski of the Wistar Institute in Philadelphia, who tested the first successful polio vaccine, in 1950. His vaccine, however, being a live <b>attenuated</b> virus taken orally, was still in the research stage and would not be ready for use until five years after Jonas Salk's polio vaccine (a dead-virus injectable vaccine) had reached the market. Koprowski's <b>attenuated</b> vaccine was prepared by successive passages through the brains of Swiss albino mice. By the seventh passage, the vaccine strains could no longer infect nervous tissue or cause paralysis. After one to three further passages on rats, the vaccine was deemed safe for human use. On 27 February 1950, Koprowski's live, <b>attenuated</b> vaccine was tested {{for the first time on}} an 8-year-old boy living at Letchworth Village, an institution for the physically and mentally disabled located in New York. After the child suffered no side effects, Koprowski enlarged his experiment to include 19 other children.|$|E

5|$|Because {{the oral}} polio vaccine is inexpensive, easy to administer, and {{produces}} excellent immunity in the intestine (which helps prevent infection with wild virus in areas where it is endemic), {{it has been the}} vaccine of choice for controlling poliomyelitis in many countries. On very rare occasions (about one case per 750,000 vaccine recipients), the <b>attenuated</b> virus in the {{oral polio vaccine}} reverts into a form that can paralyze. Most industrialized countries have switched to inactivated polio vaccine, which cannot revert, either as the sole vaccine against poliomyelitis or in combination with oral polio vaccine.|$|E
5|$|Probably {{the most}} {{important}} ecological characteristic of abyssal ecosystems is energy limitation. Abyssal seafloor communities {{are considered to be}} food limited because benthic production depends on the input of detrital organic material produced in the euphotic zone, thousands of meters above. Most of the organic flux arrives as an <b>attenuated</b> rain of small particles (typically, only 0.5–2% of net primary production in the euphotic zone), which decreases inversely with water depth. The small particle flux can be augmented by the fall of larger carcasses and downslope transport of organic material near continental margins.|$|E

Because improved sanitation does not decrease the prevalence of rotaviral disease, {{and the rate of}} hospitalisations remains high despite the use of oral rehydrating medicines, the primary public health intervention is vaccination. Two vaccines against Rotavirus A infection are approved for global use and are safe and effective in children: Rotarix by GlaxoSmithKline and RotaTeq by Merck. Both are taken orally and contain <b>attenuated</b> live virus. Three vaccines are licensed for use in national markets only: ROTAVAC®, licensed in India in 2014; Rotavin-M1™, licensed in Vietnam in 2007; and Lanzhou Lamb Rotavirus Vaccine, licensed in China in 2000. Additional rotavirus vaccines are under development.|$|E
30|$|It is {{generally}} {{believed that the}} phenomena associated with viscosity of pore fluid is {{the main cause of}} intrinsic attenuation of elastic waves in reservoir rocks and other fluidsaturated porous materials. In the present work, alongwith pore-fluid viscosity, the effects of pre-stress, anisotropy, frequency, anelasticity of porous frame on intrinsic attenuation are also studied. This study provides a procedure to relate the quality factor of an <b>attenuating</b> wave to its phase velocity and two finite non-dimensional attenuation parameters. These parameters represents an <b>attenuating</b> wave in a dissipative medium as a general inhomogeneous wave. The homogeneous <b>attenuating</b> wave is then obtained as a special case in this representation. When supported with a real/synthetic data, the suggested specification of the complex slowness vector of an <b>attenuating</b> wave can be used in the simulation studies on exploration seismology. For example, with this specification, it is possible to estimate the rate of radial decay of amplitudes of a wave in different directions in propagation-attenuation plane. Apart from attenuation parameters, this decay rate varies with phase velocity as well as frequency of the <b>attenuating</b> wave.|$|R
40|$|<b>Attenuating</b> {{orthorhombic}} {{models are}} often {{used to describe the}} azimuthal variation of the seismic wave velocity and amplitude in finely layered hydrocarbon reservoirs with vertical fractures. In addition to the P-wave related medium parameters, shear wave parameters are also present in the complex eikonal equation needed to describe the P-wave complex-valued traveltime in an <b>attenuating</b> orthorhombic medium, which increases the complexity of using the P-wave traveltime to invert for the medium parameters in practice. Here, we use the acoustic assumption to derive an acoustic eikonal equation that approximately governs the complex-valued traveltime of P-waves in an <b>attenuating</b> orthorhombic medium. For a homogeneous <b>attenuating</b> orthorhombic media, we solve the eikonal equation using a combination of the perturbation method and Shanks transform. For a horizontal <b>attenuating</b> orthorhombic layer, both the real and imaginary part of the complex-valued reflection traveltime have nonhyperbolic behaviors in terms of the source-receiver offset. Similar to the roles of normal moveout (NMO) velocity and anellipticity, the attenuation NMO velocity and the attenuation anellipticity characterize the variation of the imaginary part of the complex-valued reflection traveltime around zero source-receiver offset...|$|R
