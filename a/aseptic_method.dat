The peat from Argentina was the most superior for the three Rhizobium spp., with a mean viable count of log 9. 0 per g {{at the end of the}} storage period. The quality of inoculants produced with diluted cultures was significantly (P = 0. 05) better with irradiated than with autoclaved peat, as shown from the factorial experiment. With the tray method, rhizobia in cultures diluted 1, 000 -fold or less multiplied and stored satisfactorily in the presence of postinoculation contaminants, as determined by plate counts, membrane filter immunofluorescence, and plant infection procedures. All strains of rhizobia used in both the methods showed various degrees of population decline in the inoculants when stored at 28 °C. Fast- and slow-growing rhizobia in matured inoculants produced by the two methods showed significant (P < 0. 01) decline in viability when stored at 4 °C, whereas the viability of some strains increased significantly (P < 0. 01) at the same temperature.

Sample size: 60 individual IV preparations, 20 {{for the control group}} and 20 per test group. METHODS: Sixty agar plates were made. The IV preparations for the control group were compounded with aseptic technique: washing hands with soap and water, wearing gloves, cleaning all ports with alcohol, and working in a laminar flow hood. A syringe was used to inject the water from the vial into the IV bag. This procedure was repeated in the same manner for Group A (no use of laminar flow hood) and Group B (no swiping of the injection ports with an alcohol swab), minus the aseptic technique in question. Once all 60 IV preparations were completed, a sterile inoculation tool was used to obtain a sample from the port of the IV bag. The plates were then inoculated. RESULTS: When compared to the control group, microbial growth in Group A was not significant (p= 0. 14). The contamination rate for Group B was also not significant (p= 0. 07). CONCLUSION: Solutions compounded using abbreviated techniques (not swabbing injection ports and not using laminar flow hood) are not more likely to be contaminated than when using all proper aseptic techniques simultaneously...|$|R

The purpose of the Final Thesis is to review patient hand hygiene in terms of risks its lack entails {{and based on the}} evidence based findings to design an end product as a poster. The poster can be utilised in the Nephrology Clinic's nursing environment to educate and motivate patients to pay specifid attention to the importance of hand hygiene. The method used was a systematic literature review. The most important evidence based findings were extracted from the chosen thirteen scientific articles. All articles were searched from the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature electronic database. The gathered information was then used to build the content of a patient education tool that for this project was defined as a Poster. The findings in this study showed that transmission of bloodborne infections, like Hepatitis B or C virus can occur through a vascular access and that the consequences of this can be very fatal. Additionally, environmental surfaces such as furniture, door knobs and dialysis machine control knobs were all possible infection sources for the patient receiving hemodialysis treatment. Adherence to good hand hygiene behaviour lowered the risk for infections. The end product of this study is a poster that is targeted to patients undergoing hemodialysis treatment.

40|$|Background Diabetes {{is defined}} as an {{abnormal}} increase in blood glucose levels and {{is the most common}} disease that can complicate pregnancy. Leptin, a hormone produced mainly in adipose tissue, {{plays an important role in}} preventing fat accumulation in tissues such as skeletal muscle and myocardium and can be used to evaluate changes in lipid levels effectively. Leptin cannot cross the placental barrier, and its level in the umbilical cord is of fetal origin. Objectives Due to the lack of similar studies in Ahvaz, we aimed to determine the relationship between umbilical blood levels of this hormone with growth indices of newborns with normal mothers and mothers with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Materials and Methods After delivery and using the <b>aseptic</b> <b>method,</b> 5 mL of blood from the umbilical vein was taken immediately by staffs to separate serum and was then stored at − 20 °C. Serum level of leptin was measured using the Elisa method in two groups: “case” and “control. ” All information collected in the questionnaires was analyzed using SPSS- 19 software as well as other statistical methods. Results Serum leptin levels in the cord blood of mothers with GDM were significantly higher than in normal mothers. There was a significant relationship between serum leptin levels and birth weight in infants with diabetic mothers. In this study, no significant correlation was observed between cord leptin levels and other growth indices. Conclusions Changes in neonatal leptin levels can reflect changes in the body fat tissue and neonatal birth weight and could be effective in predicting weight gain in newborns with mothers who have gestational diabetes and may reduce birth trauma or future complications...|$|E

Aiming to assess the relative role of two different techniques, in this context, a total of 148 anastomoses (January 1973 - September 1982) is analysed, 35 involving the esophagus (GROUP A) and 113 the large bowel (GROUP B). On Group A 15 anastomoses (Sub-group Al) were carried Out by a single-layered, open technique and 20 (Sub-group A 2) by a single-layered, closed, <b>aseptic</b> <b>method.</b> On Group B open anastomoses were performed in 13 (Sub-group Bl) and the closed method was utilized in 100 (Sub-group B 2). The patients were evenly distributed as to age, sex and type of pathology. Statistically significant differences were detected, favouring sub-groups A 2 and B 2 (closed anastomosis), as of major sepsis secondary to anastomotic leak (p= 0. 05, p= 0. 001, respectively), deaths consequent to it (p= 0. 05, p= 0. 05, respectively) and Combined sepsis (p=O. O 0 l, p= 0. 00 l, respectively). There were no wound infections on GROUP A. The wound infection rate, though higher in Sub-group Bi than in Sub-group B 2 (15. 3 We vs. 5 We) did not reach statistical value. It is concluded that the single-layered, closed anastomotic technique offers, indeed, a definite advantage over the more commonly used open method, not only decreasing the wound infection rate but, most effectively, in diminishing the incidence of major intraperitoneal sepsis, consequent to anastomotic leaks.

40|$|Executive Summary Cost Analysis of Terminal Sterilization and <b>Aseptic</b> Processing <b>Methods</b> of Sensitive Implantable Combination Drug Device Products Company X Zenabu Bawa-Mamudu ??? 4 / 24 / 2015 Professional Science Master???s in Biotechnology, California State University San Marcos Sterilization is the {{validated}} {{process and}} method {{of ensuring that}} a product after production and packaging is free of microorganisms. Sterility can be achieved through both terminal sterilization which ensures the Sterility Assurance Level of 10 - 6 level or Probability of Non-Sterile Unit of less than 10 - 6 and aseptic processing which ensures the equivalent of 10 - 3. The Sterility Assurance Levels (SAL) is the statistical probability of a microorganism surviving during the process (Mosely, 2008). Sterilization science continues to pursue {{the most effective means}} of sustaining this regulatory requirement. This is driven in large part by the evolution of sensitive combination products that cannot tolerate the harsh conditions of terminal sterilization. Division 1 and Division 2 are divisions of Company X, a biotechnology company that specializes in the manufacturing of implantable combination drug and medical devices for use in ophthalmic, cardiac, and vascular care and intervention. Trends in sterilization sciences directly impact Company X across all divisions. Observing these trends and influences enables the company to proactively adapt to changes that impact both existing as well as future products. The project investigated the cost of development, validation, and implementation of different sterilization models. The aim of the project was to also provide metrics to be applied as a measurement tool. The metric can be used in making knowledge based decisions on the most cost effective and time efficient sterilization modality for next generation of combination drug device products that meets Regulatory requirements for Sterility Assurance Level. The project closely examined the different terminal sterilization modalities adopted by Division 1 and Division 2, which includes Ethylene Oxide (EO) and Radiation (E-Beam) sterilization, as well as <b>Aseptic</b> processing <b>methods</b> for sensitive implantable combination drug and device. An analysis was performed using Company X combination drug and device products as models to represent the different sterilization modalities. A series of interviews and tours were completed to gather data, analyze, and compare the sterilization validation and production cost. The following sterilization cost evaluation metrics was developed, Production Sterilization Distribution Time, Sterilization Process Time, Sterilization Cost per Unit, Annual Sterilization Capacity, and Sterilization Method Revalidation Cost and an analysis was performed using these metric and measurements. The analysis showed significant differences between the three sterilization modalities. The overall results indicated that the E-beam Radiation sterilization method provided the lowest Production Sterilization Distribution Time, Sterilization Process Time, Sterilization Cost per Unit, Sterilization Method Revalidation Cost, and Labor Cost. E-beam Radiation also provided the highest Annual Sterilization Capacity when compared to Ethylene Oxide and <b>Aseptic</b> Processing <b>methods.</b> The approach and metrics developed in this project have application in investigation of cost effectiveness of other sterilization methods. Further research can use the developed metrics to evaluate sterilization methods for a range of Sterility Assurance Levels (SAL) that are deemed safe and on site sterilization models such as Hydrogen Peroxide (H 2 O 2) and Nitrogen Dioxide (NO 2), that offer similar if not the same advantages as on site E-Beam.

(3) If high concentrations of growth factor are toxic, it will not fail to elicit a response because a gradient in concentration is set up by diffusion. (4) Double requirements may be identified by a zone of growth between two supplements. (5) Inhibitions by other supplements are identified by the failure of spreading growth in their vicinity. " (Ryan 1950). (6) Substances difficult to sterilize can be tested (Lederberg 1946). Auxanography can be used to identify new single and multiple requirements, or to confirm and identify genotypes of segregants from crosses. The method has been widely used.

40|$|Abstract Background Aseptic {{meningitis}} is {{a serious}} adverse reaction to intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy. We studied the clinical characteristics of patients with acute Kawasaki disease (KD) who developed IVIG-induced <b>aseptic</b> meningitis. <b>Methods</b> A retrospective analysis of the medical records of patients with KD who developed aseptic meningitis after IVIG treatment was performed. Results During the 10 -year period from 2000 through 2009, among a total of 384 patients with Kawasaki disease, 4 (3 females and 1 male; age range, 19 - 120 months) developed aseptic meningitis after IVIG. All 4 developed aseptic meningitis within 48 hours (range, 25 - 40 hours) of initiation of IVIG. The analyses of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) revealed elevated {{white blood cell counts}} (22 - 1, 248 /μL) in all 4 patients; a predominance of polynuclear cells (65 %- 89 %) was noted in 3. The CSF protein level was elevated in only 1 patient (59 mg/dL), and the glucose levels were normal in all 4 patients. Two patients were treated with intravenous methylprednisolone; the other 2 children were observed carefully without any special therapy. All patients recovered without neurological complications. Conclusions In our patients with Kawasaki disease, aseptic meningitis induced by IVIG occurred within 48 hours after initiation of IVIG, resolved within a few days, and resulted in no neurological complications, even in patients who did not receive medical treatment. </p...|$|R
5000|$|Aseptic {{processing}} is {{the process}} by which a sterile (aseptic) product (typically food or pharmaceutical) is packaged in a sterile container in a way that maintains sterility. Sterility is achieved with a flash-heating process (temperature between 195 and 295 °F (91 to 146 °C)), which retains more nutrients and uses less energy than conventional sterilization techniques such as retort or hot-fill canning. Pharmaceutical Sterile processing includes use of clean rooms, bacteria retaining filters, dry or steam heat. <b>Aseptic</b> food preservation <b>methods</b> allow processed food to keep {{for long periods of time}} without preservatives, as long as they are not opened. The aseptic packages are typically a mix of paper (70%), polyethylene (LDPE) (24%), and aluminum (6%), with a tight polyethylene inside layer. Sterile pharmaceuticals are usually packaged in plastic or glass. Together these materials form a tight seal against microbiological organisms, contaminants, and degradation, eliminating the need for refrigeration.|$|R
40|$|Purpose We {{performed}} {{two parallel}} systematic reviews and meta-analyses {{to determine the}} association between early migration of tibial components and late <b>aseptic</b> revision. <b>Methods</b> One review comprised early migration data from radiostereometric analysis (RSA) studies, while the other focused on revision rates for aseptic loosening from long-term survival studies. Thresholds for acceptable and unacceptable migration were determined according to that of several national joint registries: < 5 % revision at 10 years. Results Following an elaborate literature search, 50 studies (involving 847 total knee prostheses (TKPs)) {{were included in the}} RSA review and 56 studies (20, 599 TKPs) were included in the survival review. The results showed that for every mm increase in migration there was an 8 % increase in revision rate, which remained after correction for age, sex, diagnosis, hospital type, continent, and study quality. Consequently, migration up to 0. 5 mm was considered acceptable during the first postoperative year, while migration of 1. 6 mm or more was unacceptable. TKPs with migration of between 0. 5 and 1. 6 mm were considered to be at risk of having revision rates higher than 5 % at 10 years. Interpretation There was a clinically relevant association between early migration of TKPs and late revision for loosening. The proposed migration thresholds can be implemented in a phased, evidence-based introduction of new types of knee prostheses, since they allow early detection of high-risk TKPs while exposing {{only a small number of}} patient...|$|R

They are the leading cause of <b>aseptic</b> meningitis. <b>Methods.</b> In 2004, the Connecticut Department of Public Health investigated a meningitis cluster among persons returning from a school-organized trip to Mexico. Results. Among 29 travelers (25 teenagers and 4 adult chaperones), 21 became acutely ill. Viral culture and nucleic acid amplification testing of stool () and cerebrospinal fluid () specimens identified enteroviralnp 27 np 4 infection in 20 of 28 travelers from whom any specimen was obtained; 4 had echovirus 30 only, 11 had coxsackievirus (CV) A 1 only, 4 had both echovirus 30 and CVA 1, and 1 had CVA 5 only. Illness onset dates were tightly clustered 4 days after a prolonged swim in the Gulf of Mexico. Time spent swimming was significantly associated with the odds of enteroviral infection (univariate odds ratio for each additional hour swimming, 14. 3; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 3 – 154. 3). Headache, fever, vomiting, and nausea occurred more frequently among the echovirus 30 – infected travelers than among the uninfected control subjects (). The most frequent symptoms amongP!. 05 travelers infected with only CVA 1 identified were nausea and diarrhea (36 % each), but neither was significantly associated with CVA 1 infection; 5 patients with CVA 1 infection were asymptomatic...|$|R
40|$|Background {{and purpose}} The {{association}} between excessive early migration of acetabular cups and late aseptic revision has been scantily reported. We therefore performed 2 parallel systematic reviews and meta-analyses {{to determine the}} association between early migration of acetabular cups and late <b>aseptic</b> revision. <b>Methods</b> One review covered early migration data from radiostereometric analysis (RSA) studies, while the other focused on revision rates for aseptic loosening from long-term survival studies. Thresholds for acceptable and unacceptable migration were classified according the Swedish Hip Arthroplasty Register and the Australian National Joint Replacement Registry: < 5 % revision at 10 years. Results Following an elaborate literature search, 26 studies (involving 700 cups) {{were included in the}} RSA review and 49 studies (involving 38, 013 cups) were included in the survival review. For every mm increase in 2 -year proximal migration, there was a 10 % increase in revision rate, which remained after correction for age, sex, diagnosis, hospital type, continent, and study quality. Consequently, proximal migration of up to 0. 2 mm was considered acceptable and proximal migration of 1. 0 mm or more was considered unacceptable. Cups with proximal migration of between 0. 2 and 1. 0 mm were considered to be at risk of having revision rates higher than 5 % at 10 years. Interpretation There was a clinically relevant association between early migration of acetabular cups and late revision due to loosening. The proposed migration thresholds can be implemented in a phased evidence-based introduction, since they allow early detection of high-risk cups while exposing a small number of patient...|$|R
40|$|Sepsis {{represents}} a serious medical, but also social problem. Hundreds {{of thousands of}} patients die from serious sepsis and septic shock every year. Patients with serious sepsis are treated at intensive care units and their treatment is long, costly and low efficient. These are the reasons why prevention of sepsis focused on prevention and effective treatment of nosocomial infections or timely solution of another problem, e. g. a shock is so much stressed. Nosocomial infections affect about 30 per cent of patients at intensive care units and may cause serious diseases, sepsis or even death. This thesis deals with the possibilities nurses have to influence sepsis, particularly by adherence to aseptic procedures and prevention of nosocomial infection, which might consequently develop in nosocomial sepsis. Combination of quantitative and qualitative methods {{was used for the}} research. There were two goals set for the quantitative research. 1. To find whether obstacles occur in adherence to proper aseptic procedures in nursing work as prevention of nosocomial infection occurrence and subsequent septic conditions in patients hospitalized at intensive medicine workplaces. 2. To map the weak points in adherence to proper aseptic procedures in nursing work in intensive care. The goals led to hypotheses H 1 Obstacles obstructing thorough adherence to proper aseptic procedures in nursing work exist in intensive care. H 2 Non-adherence to aseptic procedures occurs in nursing work at intensive medicine workplaces as a consequence of lack of time for particular interventions. The research sample consisted of nurses from the intensive care workplaces ARD and ICU from 8 hospitals. Questioning method through the questionnaire technique was used for data collection. 342 questionnaires were distributed in total. Hypothesis 1 was refuted, hypothesis 2 was refuted. We found that no obstacles obstructing adherence to proper <b>aseptic</b> <b>methods</b> occur, we mapped the weak points in adherence to proper aseptic procedures in nursing work in intensive care. There were two goals set for the qualitative research. GOAL 3 To find what measures preventing occurrence of nosocomial infection and subsequent septic conditions in patients hospitalized at intensive medicine workplaces are taken by department managements. GOAL 4 To find out how department management deals with possible occurrence of nosocomial infection and subsequent septic conditions in patients hospitalized at intensive medicine workplaces. The following research questions were set. 1. What are the measures preventing occurrence of nosocomial infection and subsequent septic conditions in patients hospitalized at intensive medicine workplaces taken by department managements? 2. How does department management solve possible occurrence of nosocomial infection and subsequent septic conditions in patients hospitalized at intensive medicine workplaces? The research sample consisted of 5 departmental nurses and 5 head nurses from intensive care workplaces from the same hospitals where the quantitative research took place. The research was performed by semi-standardized interview. The research questions were answered. A manual for nurses called ?Recommendation for nurses in prevention of nosocomial infection and nosocomial sepsis not only at intensive care units? was elaborated upon study of these issues and the performed research. A thought map for department management illustrating prevention and solution of nosocomial infection and nosocomial sepsis was also elaborated. Both the document and the research results will be provided particularly to the managements of the hospitals that took part in our research. The thesis may also be helpful to nurses, students and other interested people to gain overall insight into the issue...|$|R
40|$|SummaryHealthcare {{acquired}} {{infections are}} no longer confined to the hospital environment. Recently, many reported outbreaks {{have been linked to}} outpatient settings and attributed to non-adherence to recommended infection-prevention procedures. This study was divided into two parts: The first is a descriptive cross-sectional part, to assess the healthcare personnel's knowledge and compliance with Standard Precautions (SP). The second is an intervention part to assess the role of health education on reducing the level of environmental and reusable medical equipment bacterial contamination. Assessment of the doctors’ and nurses’ knowledge and compliance with SP was performed using a self-administered questionnaire. Assessment of environmental cleaning (EC) and reusable medical equipment disinfection has been performed using <b>aseptic</b> swabbing <b>method.</b> The extent of any growth was recorded according to the suggested standards: (A) Presence of indicator organisms, with the proposed standard being < 1 cfu/cm 2. These include Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, MRSA), Enterococci, including vancomycin-resistant Enterococci (VRE) and various multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacilli. (B) Aerobic colony count, the suggested standard is < 5 cfu/cm 2. The effect of health education intervention on cleaning and disinfection had been analyzed by comparing the difference in cleaning level before and after interventional education. Good knowledge and compliance scores were found in more than 50 % of participants. Primary screening found poor EC and equipment disinfection as 67 % and 83. 3 % of stethoscopes and ultrasound transducers, respectively, were contaminated with indicator organisms. For all indicator organisms, a significant reduction was detected after intervention (p= 0. 00). Prevalence of MRSA was 38. 9 % and 16. 7 %, of the total S. aureus isolates, before and after intervention, respectively. Although 27. 8 % of the total Enterococcus isolates were VRE before intervention, no VRE isolates were detected after intervention. These differences were significant. Development and monitoring of the implementation of infection prevention policies and training of HCP is recommended...|$|R
40|$|The fuel {{used in the}} {{aviation}} engineering has to be clean and dry, it may not contain mechanical impurities and water. Water in aviation kerosene may occur in soluble and insoluble form. The danger inheres in the insoluble form, which may drop out in the crystalline form and cause various failures, such as those caused by mechanical impurities. The water assists in the biological matter formation created by various species of microorganisms (bacteria, mould fungi and yeast). The microorganisms, present in water phase occurring {{on the bottom of}} tanks or on the interface water phase – kerosene, grow and reproduce and subsequently may pollute (impair) the fuel by the biomass or by the products of their metabolism. There is a possibility to infect the fuel artificially by a selected reference microorganism strain, which usually occur in contaminated fuel, or by microorganisms which cause a biological contamination of aviation kerosene. Out of the selected reference strains used in the experiments, the reference strains of Proteus vulgaris, Sacharamyces cerevisiae and Clostridium perfringens were not cultivated in the sterile aviation kerosene and the propagating nutrient medium.
