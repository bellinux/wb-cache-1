5|$|A new note in Coutances' {{administration}} was his custom of issuing writs {{not in his}} own name, as had previously been the practice, but in the king's name. The archbishop also stressed that his decisions were made with the <b>advice</b> <b>and</b> <b>consent</b> {{of many of the}} leading nobles of the realm, as well as the barons of the Exchequer. This was a reaction against Longchamp's authoritarian method of government.|$|E
5|$|Cleveland was {{the first}} Democratic President subject to the Tenure of Office Act which {{originated}} in 1867; the act purported to require the Senate to approve the dismissal of any presidential appointee who was originally subject to its <b>advice</b> <b>and</b> <b>consent.</b> Cleveland objected to the act in principle and his steadfast refusal to abide by it prompted its fall into disfavor and led to its ultimate repeal in 1887.|$|E

He submitted, however, to Father John's <b>advice,</b> <b>and</b> <b>consented</b> not to urge his request.|$|R

5|$|That the negotiations, {{acceptance}} of the assignment and agreements and understandings in respect thereof were within the competence of the President may not be doubted. Governmental power over external affairs is not distributed, but is vested exclusively in the national government. And in respect of what was done here, the Executive had authority to speak as the sole organ of that government. The assignment and the agreements in connection therewith did not, {{as in the case}} of treaties, as that term is used in the treaty making clause of the Constitution (article 2, 2), require the <b>advice</b> <b>and</b> <b>consent</b> of the Senate.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} Commandant, the Assistant Commandant of the Marine Corps is {{appointed}} by the President based on <b>advice</b> <b>and</b> <b>consent</b> of the Senate and, once appointed, will be promoted to the grade of general. The duties of the Assistant Commandant include such authority and duties as the Commandant – and {{with the approval of}} the Secretary of the Navy – may delegate to or prescribe for him. Orders issued by the Assistant Commandant in performing such duties have the same effect as those issued by the Commandant. When there is a vacancy in the office of Commandant of the Marine Corps, or during the absence or disability of the Commandant, the Assistant Commandant shall perform the duties of the Commandant until a successor is appointed or the absence or disability ceases.|$|E
5|$|The {{constitution}} of the Order of Canada states that the insignia remain property of the Crown, and requires {{any member of the}} order to return to the chancellery their original emblem should they be upgraded within the order to a higher rank. Thus, while badges may be passed down as family heirlooms, or loaned or donated for display in museums, they cannot be sold by any individual other than the monarch with the proper <b>advice</b> <b>and</b> <b>consent</b> of her ministers. Over the decades, however, a number of Order of Canada insignia have been put up for sale, the first being the Companion's badge of Major Coldwell, who was appointed in 1967; his badge was sold at auction in 1981, an act that received criticism from government officials.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{concentrates}} on the ethical tension created by lawyer billing. In particular, it examines the tension between a lawyer's commercial imperative {{to make a profit}} and their ethical obligation to promote their clients interest over their own. Conventionally, this conflict is resolved through the lawyer providing disinterested advice on (their own) costs and the client granting informed consent to billing arrangements on that basis. This paper uses empirical data to suggest that notions of disinterested <b>advice</b> <b>and</b> informed <b>consent</b> are deeply flawed when it comes to lawyers' fees. Clients passively consume exploitative practices. As a result, this paper argues that, where possible, regulators should supplant informed consent with an approach requiring simple charging: reducing professional discretion over charging practices and strengthening the market-based regulation of price. This requires a significant simplification of lawyers' fees wherever possible...|$|R
2500|$|The {{commentary}} of John Wesley on the commandment to honour {{father and}} mother {{is consistent with the}} interpretation in the Catechism of the Catholic Church. He summarizes the actions that express honour as follows: 1. An inward esteem of them, outwardly expressed, 2. Obedience to their lawful commands (Ephesians 6:1–3), 3. Submission to their rebukes, instructions and corrections, 4. Acting with consideration of parental <b>advice,</b> direction <b>and</b> <b>consent,</b> 5. Giving comfort and providing for physical needs of aged parents. Like the Catechism, Wesley also teaches that the commandment includes honouring others in legitimate secular authority. He also encourages people toward honour of those in spiritual leadership with the question, [...] "Have ye all obeyed them that watch over your souls, and esteemed them highly in love for their work's sake?" [...] This question is reminiscent of Paul's statements to the church in Galatia and to Timothy.|$|R
60|$|Acting on my <b>advice,</b> George <b>and</b> Harris <b>consented</b> not to {{stay long}} in Berlin; but to push on to Dresden. Most that Berlin {{has to show}} can be seen better elsewhere, {{and we decided to}} be content with a drive through the town. The hotel porter {{introduced}} us to a droschke driver, under whose guidance, so he assured us, we should see everything worth seeing in the shortest possible time. The man himself, who called for us at nine o'clock in the morning, was all that could be desired. He was bright, intelligent, and well-informed; his German was easy to understand, and he knew a little English with which to eke it out on occasion. With the man himself there was no fault to be found, but his horse was the most unsympathetic brute I have ever sat behind.|$|R
5|$|The Governor {{appoints}} {{almost all}} military and civil {{officers of the}} State government, subject to <b>advice</b> <b>and</b> <b>consent</b> of the Maryland State Senate. The Governor also appoints certain boards and commissions {{in each of the}} 24 Counties and in Baltimore City, such as local Boards of Elections, commissions notaries public, and appoints officers to fill vacancies in the elected offices of Attorney General and Comptroller. Should a vacancy arise in either of the two houses of the General Assembly, the Governor also fills that vacancy, though the Governor must choose from among the recommendations of the local party organization to which the person leaving the vacancy belonged. Any officer appointed by the Governor, except a member of the General Assembly, is removable by him or her, if there is a legitimate cause for removal. Among the most prominent of the Governor's appointees are the 24 secretaries and heads of departments that currently make up the Governor's Cabinet, also known as the Executive Council.|$|E
5|$|With the {{question}} of the episcopal exemption decided in Evesham's favour, the alliance between Norreis and his monks dissolved. The monks again complained of their abbot's behaviour to the new papal legate, John of Sancta Maria. The legate ordered an investigation, the result being a written agreement between the two parties. Norreis gave gifts to the legate's nephew, refused to sign the agreement, and took revenge on his opponents by expelling Thomas of Marlborough and his allies from the monastery. Thirty monks followed Thomas into exile, and Norreis pursued them with soldiers who were defeated by the monks. A compromise was eventually reached, Norreis agreeing that the revenues of the abbey would be split with the monks, that officials of the abbey would be appointed by the abbot but with the <b>advice</b> <b>and</b> <b>consent</b> of the monks, and that the abbot would not admit or expel monks without taking the counsel of his monks nor dispose of the monastic property without the consent of his subordinates. Although the issue of the monks' support was temporarily solved, the issue of the disputed properties between Mauger and the monastery continued. Norreis appears to have been willing to compromise with the bishop, but the monks refused.|$|E

50|$|The celebrated Jesuit theologian John de Lugo, {{who became}} a {{cardinal}} in 1643, learned about the cinchona from Tafur, and remained from 1643 {{until his death in}} 1660 its faithful advocate, zealous defender, and generous, disinterested dispenser in Italy and the rest of Europe, for which he was honoured in the appellation of pulvis cardinalis, pulvis Lugonis, and by having several portraits painted of him. De Lugo had the bark analysed by the pope's physician in ordinary, Gabriele Fonseca, who reported on it very favourably. Its distribution among the sick in Rome took place only on the <b>advice</b> <b>and</b> with the <b>consent</b> of the Roman doctors. The cardinal had more bark brought from America over the trade routes through Spain. Almost all the other patrons of the drug in those times appear to have been directly influenced by de Lugo; as, for instance, the lay brother Pietro Paolo Pucciarini, S. J. (1600-1661), apothecary in the Jesuit College at Rome, who undoubtedly deserves the greatest credit after de Lugo for distributing the genuine unadulterated article, and to whom are attributed the Roman directions for its use Schedula Romana, the earliest dating at least from 1651.|$|R

This was because Parliament wanted to know who was deciding policies, as sometimes councillors' signatures normally attached to resolutions were absent. This provision was repealed early in Queen Anne's reign, as many councillors ceased to offer <b>advice</b> <b>and</b> some stopped attending meetings altogether.|$|R
40|$|Informed consent is {{essential}} in ethical health care practice. Information <b>and</b> <b>advice</b> regarding choices is a precondition of informed <b>consent.</b> Autonomy, truthfulness <b>and</b> ethical decision making are all relevant to the informed choice <b>and</b> <b>consent</b> process. The {{purpose of this paper}} is firstly to discuss these topics. Following this, a case of informed choice <b>and</b> <b>consent</b> for cervical spine manipulation is examined. This case illustrates ethical problems that can arise in the informed choice <b>and</b> <b>consent</b> process. The moral reasoning in the case is clarified with the assistance of an ethical grid. The conclusion is that autonomy, a patient's right to self determination, is paramount in the informed choice <b>and</b> <b>consent</b> process. Autonomy enhancing informed consent requires more than a mechanical recitation of procedures, hazards and options. In order to uphold a patient's right to self determination, patients need to be included in the decision making process by allowing them to make treatment choices based on accurate information <b>and</b> <b>advice</b> from the physiotherapist...|$|R
25|$|The Senate has {{a long-standing}} {{practice}} of permitting motions to reconsider previous decisions. In 1931, the Senate granted <b>advice</b> <b>and</b> <b>consent</b> to the President on {{the appointment of}} a member of the Federal Power Commission. The officer in question was sworn in, but the Senate, under the guise of a motion to reconsider, rescinded the <b>advice</b> <b>and</b> <b>consent.</b> In the writ of quo warranto proceedings that followed, the Supreme Court ruled that the Senate was not permitted to rescind <b>advice</b> <b>and</b> <b>consent</b> after the officer had been installed.|$|E

25|$|The {{powers of}} the Senate {{concerning}} nominations are, however, subject to some constraints. For instance, the Constitution provides that the president may make an appointment during a congressional recess without the Senate's <b>advice</b> <b>and</b> <b>consent.</b> The recess appointment remains valid only temporarily; the office becomes vacant again {{at the end of}} the next congressional session. Nevertheless, presidents have frequently used recess appointments to circumvent the possibility that the Senate may reject the nominee. Furthermore, as the Supreme Court held in Myers v. United States, although the Senate's <b>advice</b> <b>and</b> <b>consent</b> is required for the appointment of certain executive branch officials, it is not necessary for their removal. Recess appointments have faced a significant amount of resistance and in 1960, the U.S. Senate passed a legally non-binding resolution against recess appointments.|$|E
