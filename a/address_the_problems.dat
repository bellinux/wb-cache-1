5|$|Greater Manchester's {{railway network}} {{historically}} suffered from poor north–south connections {{due to the}} fact that Manchester's main railway stations, Piccadilly and Victoria, were built in the 1840s on peripheral locations outside Manchester City Centre. The central commercial district had no rail links, and over the years, a number of unsuccessful schemes were proposed to connect Manchester's rail termini. In the 1960s, transport design studies were undertaken to <b>address</b> <b>the</b> <b>problems</b> of increasing traffic congestion. A number of urban public transport schemes were evaluated for Manchester, including several types of monorail systems and metro-style systems.|$|E
5|$|In 1935, the United States Department of the Interior {{created the}} Southwestern Range and Sheep Breeding Laboratory to <b>address</b> <b>the</b> <b>problems</b> Rambouillet stock had caused for the Navajo economy. Located at Fort Wingate, New Mexico, the program's {{aim was to}} develop a new sheep {{bloodline}} that simulated the wool characteristics of the 19th-century Navajo-Churro stock and would also supply adequate meat. The Fort Wingate researchers collected old Navajo-Churro stock from remote parts of the reservation and hired a weaver to test their experimental wool. Offspring of these experiments were distributed among the Navajo people. World War II interrupted the greater part of this effort when military work resumed at Fort Wingate.|$|E

In the 21st century, Cow Tower is managed by English Heritage and Norwich City Council; the tower is now only a shell, however, as the floors and the roof have been lost. The tower is protected under UK law as a scheduled monument.|$|E
5|$|Allen {{returned}} to Jamaica {{to serve as}} a pastor, and was given increasing leadership responsibilities within the broader Seventh-day Adventist Church. Allen was appointed as the Director of Education and Communications within the Central Jamaica Conference of Seventh-day Adventists, one of five regional conferences within Jamaica. He later served as the Director of Education and Family Life for the West Indies Union of Seventh-day Adventists, which at the time had jurisdiction over Jamaica, The Bahamas, the Cayman Islands, and the Turks and Caicos Islands. In 1993, he {{returned to}} Andrews University, where he worked in the registrar's office while pursuing a doctorate in Educational Administration and Supervision. After receiving his doctorate in 1998, Allen returned to Jamaica, where he became the President of the Central Jamaica Conference, and in 2000, the President of the West Indies Union of Seventh-day Adventists. In 2005, he was elected to a second five-year term. In his acceptance speech, Allen opined that church outreach should <b>address</b> <b>the</b> <b>problems</b> facing the community, including the HIV/AIDS epidemic, domestic abuse, teenage pregnancy, unemployment, and violent crime. During this time, Allen also served as the chairman of the boards of Northern Caribbean University and Andrews Memorial Hospital.|$|E

25|$|In 1801, 42% of the {{population}} of Leeds lived outside the township, in the wider borough. Cholera outbreaks in 1832 and 1849 caused the authorities to <b>address</b> <b>the</b> <b>problems</b> of drainage, sanitation, and water supply. Water was pumped from the River Wharfe, but by 1860 it was too heavily polluted to be usable. Following the Leeds Waterworks Act of 1867 three reservoirs were built at Lindley Wood, Swinsty, and Fewston in the Washburn Valley north of Leeds.|$|E

Hone Heke cut it down again, four times altogether; by the fourth occasion the First New Zealand War, sometimes called the Flagstaff War or the Northern War, was well under way.|$|E
25|$|Chinese troops {{suffered}} from deficient military equipment, serious logistical problems, overextended communication and supply lines, {{and the constant}} threat of UN bombers. All of these factors generally led to a rate of Chinese casualties that was far greater than the casualties suffered by UN troops. The situation became so serious that, on November 1951, Zhou Enlai called a conference in Shenyang to discuss the PVA's logistical problems. At the meeting {{it was decided to}} accelerate the construction of railways and airfields in the area, {{to increase the number of}} trucks available to the army, and to improve air defense by any means possible.

25|$|With the {{development}} of industry and the Dearne and Dove Canal, the river became grossly polluted {{in the early nineteenth}} century, and fish populations died. The West Riding River Board tried to <b>address</b> <b>the</b> <b>problems</b> as early as 1896, with limited success, and much of the river remained dead until the 1980s, when concerted attempts were made to clean industrial effluents before they were discharged, and to improve sewage treatment processes. Despite some setbacks, fish populations had been partially reinstated by the early 1990s. Channel engineering was carried out at Denaby in the 1990s, to re-introduce bends, deep pools and shallow gravel riffles, to assist fish spawning. In June 2015, salmon were reported in the river {{for the first time in}} 150 years.|$|E
25|$|In late January 1910, {{following}} {{months of}} high rainfall, the River Seine in Paris flooded the French capital, reaching a maximum height of 8.62 metres. The Great Flood of Paris {{as it is}} colloquially known caused extensive damage and forced thousands out of their homes. The infrastructure within Paris came close to destruction and there were major concerns for public health. France mobilised to save its capital. Lépine whose office included public health proved as tough and authoritarian {{as he had been}} on policing matters. In the flood's aftermath he established new procedures to <b>address</b> <b>the</b> <b>problems</b> of flooding. The instructions explained the importance of chemical cleansing and institutionalized the growing medical consensus about the causes of water borne diseases that had been controversial just a few years earlier.|$|E
