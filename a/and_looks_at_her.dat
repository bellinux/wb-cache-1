5|$|Inside {{their hotel}} room, Spears {{and her boyfriend}} start {{screaming}} at each other. When he tries to make amends and get close to her, she brushes off his attempts and walks away. Her boyfriend gets mad and then throws a vase at the wall while Spears goes into the bathroom, hurling something at the mirror. She begins to fill the bathtub and remove her clothes. After this, the video includes intercut scenes of a close-up of Spears singing in a white shirt {{in front of a}} bright white light. As she lies in the bathtub, a red string, a custom associated with Kabbalah is seen in her wrist. She touches her head <b>and</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> hand, realizing she is bleeding from the wound. According to Jennifer Vineyard of MTV, the blood in her hand is stigmata. She loses consciousness in the bathtub and drowns. Shortly after, her boyfriend finds her and tries to resuscitate her. Meanwhile, it is revealed that in the close-up scenes Spears is actually inside a hospital hallway. The video continues with scenes of her being carried into an ambulance and surrounded by photographers, as well as scenes of her being resuscitated by doctors in a hospital bed. The ghost of Spears in a white shirt, watches herself in the bed and walks into the next room, where a baby girl is born. Spears is then seen running away from the camera into the light. The music video ends with her rising from under the water, resting her head and smiling, suggesting the whole scene of her death was a dream or a morbid fantasy.|$|E

6000|$|PROSERPINE (worriedly). Oh, I wasn't minding you: I {{was trying}} to make notes. (She takes out her note-book, <b>and</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> stenography, which nearly makes her cry.) ...|$|E
60|$|Madame Defarge {{received}} it as a compliment, <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> husband. Defarge, {{who had been}} uneasily biting his thumb-nail <b>and</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> collected his face into a sterner expression.|$|R

60|$|He {{stops in}} his rubbing <b>and</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> {{with his hands}} on his knees. Imperturbable and {{unchangeable}} as he is, there is still an indefinable freedom in his manner which is new and which does not escape this woman's observation.|$|E
60|$|GRACE. Yes, Leonard; but I'm an {{advanced}} woman. (He checks himself <b>and</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> in some consternation.) I'm {{what my father}} calls a New Woman. (He lets her go and stares at her.) I quite agree with all your ideas.|$|E

60|$|Nora turned <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> {{companion}} with big, startled eyes.|$|R
60|$|The other nodded approval, <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> {{with growing}} interest.|$|R

6000|$|... "He won’t catch her," [...] said Henry; [...] "he never does—leastways {{if he does}} he only passes <b>and</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> out of {{the corner}} of his eye. He writes letters to her of a night, but he never gives ’em to her." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{young lady}} turns <b>and</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> watch. She rises {{with an air}} of one who waits, and is almost {{at the end of her}} patience. She is a pretty girl, slender, fair, and {{intelligent}} looking, nicely but not expensively dressed, evidently not a smart idler.|$|E
6000|$|... "Be {{sure that}} she never goes to the Bristows again, and ask her whether she has any other card debts. It may be my fancy, but I don't like the way that man hangs about her, <b>and</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>her.</b> I am {{sure that she}} does not like him, and yet she never seems to have the courage to snub him." ...|$|E
60|$|Indoors, Miriam {{touched her}} younger sister's {{shoulder}} <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> affectionately.|$|R

6000|$|... [MRS. CHEVELEY starts; then bows with {{somewhat}} exaggerated politeness to LADY CHILTERN, {{who makes}} {{no sign of}} response. As she passes by SIR ROBERT CHILTERN, who is standing close to the door, she pauses {{for a moment and}} looks him straight in the face. She then goes out, followed by the servant, who closes the door after him. The husband and wife are left alone. LADY CHILTERN stands like some one in a dreadful dream. Then she turns round <b>and</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> husband. She looks at him with strange eyes, as though she were seeing him for the first time.] ...|$|E
6000|$|PROSERPINE (looking him {{straight}} in the face.) Yes. (He covers {{his face with his}} hands.) Whatever is the matter with you! (He takes down his hands <b>and</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>her.</b> Frightened at the tragic mask presented to her, she hurries past him at the utmost possible distance, keeping her eyes on his face until he turns from her and goes to the child's chair beside the hearth, where he sits in the deepest dejection. As she approaches the door, it opens and Burgess enters. On seeing him, she ejaculates) Praise heaven, here's somebody! (and sits down, reassured, at her table. She puts a fresh sheet of paper into the typewriter as Burgess crosses to Eugene.) ...|$|E
6000|$|CARMODY. No back talk! Pictures or not, it's all {{the same}} mopin' and lazin' in it. (After a pause--morosely.) It's the bad luck I've been havin' {{altogether}} this last year since your mother died. Who's {{to do the work}} and look after Nora and Tom and yourself, if Eileen is bad took and has to stay in her bed? I'll have to get Mrs. Brennan come look after the house. That means money, too, and where's it to come from? All that I've saved from slavin' and sweatin' in the sun with a gang of lazy Dagoes'll be up the spout in no time. (Bitterly.) What a fool a man is to be raisin' a raft of children and him not a millionaire! (With lugubrious self-pity.) Mary, dear, it's a black curse God put on me when he took your mother just when I needed her most. (Mary commences to sob. Carmody starts <b>and</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> angrily.) What are you sniffin' at? ...|$|E
60|$|He {{pushed back}} {{a mass of}} tangled hair <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> grimly.|$|R

60|$|At this moment, when torches were blazing {{round the}} ships, and all seemed lost, Patroclus {{came out of}} the hut of Eurypylus, whose wound he had been tending, and he saw that the Greeks were in great danger, and ran weeping to Achilles. 'Why do you weep,' said Achilles, 'like a little girl that runs by her mother's side, and plucks at her gown <b>and</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> with tears in her eyes, till her mother takes her up in her arms? Is there bad news from home that your father is dead, or mine; or are you sorry that the Greeks are getting what they deserve for their folly?' Then Patroclus told Achilles how Ulysses and many other princes were wounded and could not fight, and begged to be allowed to put on Achilles' armour and lead his men, who were all fresh and unwearied, into the battle, for a charge of two {{thousand}} fresh warriors might turn the fortune of the day.|$|E
6000|$|... "And he {{did bring}} this gentleman, as he promised he would--an old gentleman, {{with such a}} {{pleasant}} way of speaking that I understood everything {{he said to me}} directly. 'I'm afraid you must make up your mind to the worst,' says he. 'I have been hearing about the poor child from my friend who's attended her; and I'm sorry to say I don't think there's much hope.' Then he goes to the bed <b>and</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>her.</b> 'Ah,' says he, 'there's just the same expression in her face that I remember seeing in a mason's boy--a patient of mine--who fell off a ladder, and lost his hearing altogether by the shock. You don't hear what I'm saying, do you, my dear?' says he in a hearty cheerful way. 'You don't hear me saying that you're the prettiest little girl I ever saw in my life?' She looked up at him confused, and quite silent. He didn't speak to her again, but told me to turn her on the bed, so that he could get at one of her ears.|$|E
6000|$|And so they conversed at some length, Mr. Hoopdriver {{delighted to}} find his horrible {{suspicion}} disposed of. The barmaid having listened awhile at the staircase volunteered some particulars of the young couple upstairs. Her modesty was much impressed by the young lady's costume, so she intimated, and Mr. Hoopdriver whispered the badinage natural to the occasion, at which she was coquettishly shocked. [...] "There'll be no knowing which is which, {{in a year or}} two," [...] said the barmaid. [...] "And her manner too! She got off her machine and give it 'im to stick up against the kerb, and in she marched. 'I and my brother,' says she, 'want to stop here to-night. My brother doesn't mind what kind of room 'e 'as, but I want a room with a good view, if there's one to be got,' says she. He comes hurrying in after <b>and</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>her.</b> 'I've settled the rooms,' she says, and 'e says 'damn!' just like that. I can fancy my brother letting me boss the show like that." ...|$|E

6000|$|Bubbles {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{fascinating}} of sports. There is the soft foamy mass, like driven snow, or like whipped cream. Blanche bends down to blow [...] "a honeycomb," [...] holding the bowl of the pipe in the water; at her gurgling blasts there slowly heaves upwards the pile of larger, clearer bubbles, each reflecting the whole scene, and sparkling with rainbow tints, until Aubrey ruthlessly dashes all into fragments with his hand, and Mary pronounces it stiff enough, and presents a pipe to little Daisy, who, drawing the liquid into her mouth, throws it away with a grimace, and declares that she does not like bubbles! But Aubrey stands with swelled cheeks, gravely puffing at the sealing-waxed extremity. Out pours a confused assemblage of froth, but the glassy globe slowly expands the little branching veins, flowing down on either side, bearing an enlarging miniature of the sky, the clouds, the tulip-tree. Aubrey pauses to exclaim! but where is it? Try again! A proud bubble, as Mary calls it, a peacock, in blended pink and green, is this transparent sphere, reflecting and embellishing house, wall, and shrubs! It is too beautiful! It is gone! Mary undertakes to give a lesson, and blows deliberately without the slightest result. Again! She waves her disengaged hand in silent exultation as the airy balls detach themselves, and float off on the summer breeze, with a tardy, graceful, uncertain motion. Daisy rushes after them, catches at them, <b>and</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> empty fingers with a puzzled [...] "All gone!" [...] as plainly expressed by Toby, who snaps at them, and shakes his head with offended dignity at the shock of his meeting teeth, while the kitten frisks after them, striking at them with her paw, amazed at meeting vacancy.|$|E
