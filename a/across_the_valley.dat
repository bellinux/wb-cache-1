5|$|The area is not {{prominent}} on Brighton's skyline, {{but good}} views are possible from its streets, especially westwards and southwestwards towards {{the sea and}} <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>valley</b> floor in which Old Steine and the old town are situated.

5|$|Nash's {{designs for}} the house {{included}} a three-storey octagonal tower, with two wings coming off it and a second square tower above a porte-cochère. Inside the drawing room occupied {{the ground floor of}} the tower, with a sitting room above. The dining room was designed to hold views <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>valley,</b> and the asymmetric rooms allowed for a panorama of views. To allow easy access to the gardens, the servant's quarters were moved to a separate wing, but made to be less prominent. A chapel was added in approximately 1862, and the house's loggia was converted into a conservatory.|$|E
25|$|The Animas Mountains lie between <b>the</b> Animas <b>Valley</b> on <b>the</b> {{west and}} <b>the</b> Playas <b>Valley</b> on <b>the</b> east.

5|$|The 2nd Light Horse Brigade and Patiala Infantry, (Chaytor's Force) {{advanced}} on 20 September eastwards {{across the}} Jordan Valley toward the strongly entrenched Shunet Nimrin position, and Derbasi on the Ottoman left flank. The 6th Light Horse and 7th Light Horse Regiments, {{with a company}} of Patiala Infantry, were shelled by guns from El Haud {{in the foothills of}} Moab as they moved <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>valley.</b> Positions east of the Jordan River, including Mellaha, continued to be strongly held by Fourth Army units.|$|E
5|$|The {{pressure}} on Ward's brigade was eventually too great, {{and he was}} forced to call for a retreat. Hood's division secured Devil's Den and the southern part of Houck's Ridge. The center of the fighting shifted to the northwest, to Rose Woods and the Wheatfield, while five regiments under Evander Law assaulted Little Round Top to the east. Benning's men spent the next 22 hours on Devil's Den, firing <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>Valley</b> of Death on Union troops massed on Little Round Top.|$|E
5|$|During the Hellenistic period, the {{sanctuary}} was {{extended from the}} base of the podium <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>valley.</b> To the east base of the podium stands a large chapel, , dating to the 4thcentury BC. The chapel was adorned with a paved pool and a large stone throne carved of a single block of granite in the Egyptian style; it is flanked by two sphinx figures and surrounded by two lion sculptures. The throne, attributed to the Sidonian goddess Astarte, rests against the chapel wall, which is embellished by relief sculptures of hunting scenes. The once important Astarte basin lost its function during the 2nd century AD and was filled with earth and statue fragments. The west base contains another 4th century BC chapel—centered on a bull protome topped capital—that remains preserved at the National Museum of Beirut.|$|E

5|$|I-70 {{serves as}} the main {{thoroughfare}} of the valley, the only area traversed by the freeway in the state {{with more than a}} few hundred residents. Richfield is the largest city along I-70 in the state. The highway enters the valley just north of Big Rock Candy Mountain, a mountain named for a song attributed to Harry McClintock. The highway proceeds northeast along {{the western edge of the}} valley, passing to the west of the communities of the valley, including Joseph, Monroe, Elsinore, and Richfield. As I-70 approaches Salina it cuts <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>valley</b> passing to the south of that town. The highway avoids the downtown areas of all of these cities. The portion between Richfield and Salina is the busiest, with an annual average daily traffic of 11,535vehicles in 2006. In the Sevier Valley, I-70 was built parallel to U.S. Route 89.|$|E
5|$|Mow Cop Castle is an elaborate, Gothic Revival folly, built {{two miles}} from Rode Hall, at Mow Cop, land {{previously}} belonging to the estate. Dating from 1754, the castle was built by Randle Wilbraham III and designed by the Hiorne brothers, the architects {{who worked on the}} 1752 improvements to the hall. It was constructed to improve the view <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>valley</b> from the hall. The family often used it as a summer house and for picnics. The castle fell into disrepair a number of times in the 19th century and several programmes of restoration were completed, including the replacement of the doors at a cost of £4 4s. The castle and surrounding land were sold by the Wilbrahams in 1923. The castle is renowned as the birthplace of Primitive Methodism, following a camp meeting there in 1807.|$|E
5|$|The valley {{itself is}} {{elongated}} along an axis that points {{toward the center}} of Mare Serenitatis. Large massifs are located {{on either side of the}} valley, called the North and South massifs, respective to their geographic location in relation to each other. The height of these massifs give the valley a depth greater than that of the Grand Canyon in the United States. Along the South Massif lies Bear Mountain, named after a mountain of the same name near Harrison Schmitt's hometown of Silver City, New Mexico. The sculptured hills and East massif make up the east edge of the valley and to the west, a scarp cuts <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>valley</b> floor and rises about two kilometres (1.2 miles) above it. The North and South massifs funnel into the main outlet of the valley into Mare Serenitatis, partially blocked by Family mountain.|$|E

5|$|Although a court roll of 1389 {{mentions}} two gardens, {{there is}} no record of where these were sited, nor is there any record of when the terraces were constructed. The basic layout as known today was certainly in place by about 1730, {{as can be seen in}} a portrait of the house from that period. Later in the 18th century, the space behind the great pilastered wall was infilled to make the top terrace, which has wide views <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>valley</b> to the Mendip Hills beyond. The Octagon, a garden pavilion, was built about the same time, as was the more rustic summer house which faces it down the long grassy walk of the Pretty Terrace. Further modifications involved facing the lower retaining wall with rosy pink bricks, which were also used to build a double flight of steps below the Octagon. The garden is still largely in its 18th-century form, though small ponds and fountains were added in the 19th century and the once open hillside behind is now thickly wooded. A single rose arbour remained from the Edwardian garden but was on the verge of collapse when it was replaced with a new one in 2009, marking 300 years of the Elton family's presence at Clevedon Court.|$|E
5|$|Although {{some of its}} {{stones were}} plundered for use elsewhere, the Pont du Gard {{remained}} largely intact. Its survival was due to its use as a toll bridge <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>valley.</b> In the 13th century the French king granted the seigneurs of Uzès the right to levy tolls on those using the bridge. The right later passed to the Bishops of Uzès. In return, they were responsible for maintaining the bridge in good repair. However, it suffered serious damage during the 1620s when Henri, Duke of Rohan made use of the bridge to transport his artillery during the wars between the French royalists and the Huguenots, whom he led. To make space for his artillery to cross the bridge, the duke had {{one side of the}} second row of arches cut away to a depth of about one-third of their original thickness. This left a gap on the lowest deck wide enough to accommodate carts and cannons, but severely weakened the bridge in the process.|$|E
5|$|John Wilson (1847) {{writes that}} the tomb lies {{about two or three}} hundred yards to the north of Jacob's Well, <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>valley.</b> He {{describes}} it as 'a small solid erection {{in the form of a}} wagon roof, over what is supposed to be the patriarch’s grave, with a small pillar or altar at each of its extremities, sometimes called the tombs of Ephraim and Manasseh, and the middle of an enclosure without a covering. Many visitors names, in the Hebrew and Samaritan characters, are written on the walls of this enclosure.' One of the inscriptions is said to intimate the tomb's repair by a Jew from Egypt, Elijah son of Meir, around 1749. Wilson adds that 'The Jews of Nablus take upon themselves the duty of keeping the tomb in order. They applied to us for a subscription to aid in making some repairs and we complied with their request'. These Hebrew and Samaritan inscriptions were still visible on the white plastered walls as late as 1980, as were small lamps in an internal recess, probably donated by Jews during the 18th and 19th centuries.|$|E

25|$|On 11 June, {{there were}} protests against these killings in the {{downtown}} area of Srinagar. Police used massive force to disperse the protesting youth during which a teargas bullet killed a seventeen-year-old Tufail Ahmad Mattoo who was playing cricket in Gani memorial Stadium. Several protest marches were organised <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>Valley</b> in response to the killings which turned violent. Thereafter a vicious circle was set, killing of a boy was followed by protest demonstrations and clashes with police and CRPF in which another boy was killed which led to another protest by the boys till several youth lost their lives. Official figures reveal around 110 people have lost their lives and 537 civilians were injured during stone-pelting incidents from May to 21 September 2010. Around 1,274 CRPF men and 2,747 police personnel were injured during the same period <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>valley.</b>|$|E
