However, financial and insurance markets are not well-developed in developing countries, including rural Vietnam, where opportunistic behavior, such as adverse selection and moral hazard, especially impede the development of a livestock insurance market. In 2011 - 2013, the government of Vietnam introduced an <b>agricultural</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>system</b> as a trial which the main focus on poverty alleviation. Our survey results indicate that farmers who received insurance payments were able to re-introduce new swine to their production, contributing to poverty alleviation. However, the enrollment rate is quite low among middle-income households, who are assumed to be very knowledgeable about animal production and hygiene technology. Therefore, policy markers and insurance companies will face a trade-off between contribution to temporary poverty alleviation and adverse selection...|$|E

40|$|The {{problem of}} rural {{financing}} {{is one of}} the major challenges to the emerging China. It is challenging for government authorities to provide adequate financial resources and access to financial institutions in rural agricultural areas to farmer households. The development of Village and Township Banks (VTBs) has remarkably increased since 2008 but the deposit collection of VTBs is comparatively weaker than the loan disbursement. Despite of facing numerous challenges, establishing within the framework of new-type financial institutions is playing a significant role for the development of agricultural sector. For the sustainable development of VTBs, VTBs should set up staff and member incentive system, introduce innovative financial products; and strengthen the <b>agricultural</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>system.</b> The cooperation between VTBs and the other rural financial institutions should be developed to meet short-term rural financing gap and to strengthen the institutional capacity of VTBs.

40|$|The {{importance}} of agriculture {{in a country}} with 1. 3 billion people is self-evident. Agricultural insurance, however, did not emerge in China until the 1930 s. Having gone through twists and turns, agricultural insurance is now widely recognised as an important means of protection for production and for the life of people in rural areas. Under the guidance and {{with the support of the}} government at all levels, pilot projects of agricultural insurance are being carried out. The China Insurance Regulatory Commission is strengthening its supervision of agricultural business and exploring a set of regulations for this sector. As a result, the market is growing quickly; the market structure has become more diversified and more products are available. In the pilot efforts to find a good model for agricultural insurance in China, some successful experiments have been made.

40|$|Agricultural {{insurance}} {{is one of}} the appropriate ways to overcome the risk in agricultural production and to increase farmers’ income security. In this study, the influence of wheat insurance, as personal-free insurance, and sugar beet insurance, as group-forcible insurance, on farmers’ risk attitudes in Fars Province were investigated as a case study. Data were collected using stratified multi-stage cluster sampling method and interviews in the years 1375 - 1376. The sample included wheat and sugar beet farmers in three different climates including Mediterranean, warm sub-desert and cold mountainous in Fars Province. Results of estimating risk aversion coefficients of farmers, using Safety First Rule (SFR), showed that sugar beet forcible insurance along with giving inputs, mechanization services, lookout of farms by sugar plants led to continuous insurance purchase by farmers in consecutive years. Therefore, sugar beet farmers tended to welcome insurance and the effect of insurance on their risk aversion coefficients was positive. However, discontinuity of insurance purchase by wheat farmers in consecutive years and farmers’ lack of confidence in insurace system caused the influence of insurance on wheat farmers’ risk aversion coefficient to be insignificant. Thus, sugar beet insurance type is closer than wheat insurance type to one of the main aims of <b>agricultural</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>system,</b> which is increasing farmers’ tendency to take risks...|$|E

40|$|The {{topic was}} chosen {{due to the}} fact that, {{although}} <b>agricultural</b> <b>insurance</b> is particularly needed in agriculture to achieve performance, its achievements are still modest. The importance of this research is in that it tackles a very important sector of the economy, agriculture, and puts forward an immediate viable solution that meets the current needs of farmers. The contribution of the authors is their innovative solution, namely the proposition to implement expert <b>systems</b> in <b>agricultural</b> <b>insurance,</b> as a means of promoting insurance products which, although they are not currently granted the due importance, have started to be acknowledged increasingly in recent times. The interest in this type of insurance is due to the recent climate changes whose effects are extremely damaging, and to the need to improve agricultural competitiveness on the common market as a result of trade liberalization in agricultural products. The scientific literature in the field of expert systems highlights the benefits of implementing systems in all areas of economic and social activity, including insurance and agriculture, but it does not deal separately with the issue of <b>agricultural</b> <b>insurance,</b> despite its importance in the development of agriculture. This confirms the topicality of the study. Regarding the scientific methodology, in order to easily understand how expert systems work also by those who are not familiar with the field, we opted to present the stages of preparation of the system, namely: (a) preparing the knowledge database, (2) preparing the charts and (3) system encoding and assessment.

That is why maintainig a certain degree of certitude in what concerns the obtainance of stable and efficient results implies the protection through insurance and reinsurance in this field. The aim {{of this paper is to}} make an inventory of the types of insurances offered to the agriculturists by the insurance companies and, starting from this, to act as a framework of suggestions for choosing complex insurance products and services available in this category. The authors start from the premiss that in the centre of the <b>agricultural</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>system</b> should be the agricultural producer, that is why the insurance protection should regard: the insurance of the agricultural cultures and of the vineyard products owned by agricultors, regardless of the organisational form in which the process of production takes place; animal insurance; the complex insurance of the household, including the insurance of the buidings. An overall view should include the creation of a system of pension insurances for agriculturists, in a legal, institutional framework, with distinct resources and expenses. 1.

The report quantifies and maps different types of risks, from climatic risks to yield and revenue risks. The role of Governments in helping farmers to face disasters is analyzed for every country: providing aid ex-post and offering or subsidizing insurances. The Member States definitions of crisis and disaster when authorising state aids are described and contrasted with the EU and international legislation. Aid is sometimes given on an ad-hoc basis through compensation schemes, or funds partially financed by the agricultural sector (on a voluntary or compulsory basis). Mutual funds, calamity funds and ad-hoc payments existing in European countries are summarised. The levels of ad-hoc payments per country are compared. <b>Agricultural</b> <b>insurances</b> are fostered in a number of countries.

40|$|Policy {{measures}} regarding {{adaptation to}} climate change include efforts to adjust socio-economic and ecologic systems. Colombia has undertaken various measures in terms of climate change mitigation and adaptation since becoming a party of the Kyoto protocol in 2001 and a party of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in 1995. The first national communication to the UNFCCC stated how Colombian agriculture will be severely impacted under different emission scenarios and time frames. The analyses in this document further support that climate change will severely threaten the socioeconomics of Colombian agriculture. We first query national data sources to characterize the agricultural sector. We then use 17 Global Circulation Model (GCM) outputs to quantify how Colombian agricultural production may be affected by climate change, and show the expected changes to years 2040 – 2069 (“ 2050 ”) under the A 2 scenario of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES-A 2) and the overall trends in both precipitation and temperature to 2100. We then evaluate expected changes within different regions and measure the proportion of area affected within each crop’s distributional range. By 2050, climatic change in Colombia will likely impact 3. 5 million people, 14 % of national GDP corresponding to agriculture, employment of 21 % of the population, agro-industries, supply chains, and food and nutritional security. If no adaptation measures are taken, 80 % of crops would be impacted in more than 60 % of their current areas of cultivation, with particularly severe impacts in high value perennial and exportable crops. Impacts also include soil degradation and organic matter losses in the Andes hillsides; likely flooding in the Caribbean and Pacific coasts; niche losses for coffee, fruit, cocoa, and bananas; changes in prevalence of pests and diseases; and increases in the vulnerabilities of non-technically developed smallholders. There is, however, still time to change the current levels of vulnerability if a multidisciplinary focus (i. e., agronomic, economic, and social) in vulnerable sectors is undertaken. Each sub-sector and the Government need to invest in: (1) data collection, (2) detailed, regionally-based impact assessments, (3) research and development, and (4) extension and technology transfer. Support to vulnerable smallholders should be given by the state in the form of <b>agricultural</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>systems</b> contextualized under the phenomenon of climate change.
