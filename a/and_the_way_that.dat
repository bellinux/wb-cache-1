5|$|In April 2008, Arafiles {{arrived at}} WCMH. He {{had earned a}} medical degree in the Philippines {{before coming to the}} United States; he {{continued}} his training in Baltimore and Buffalo. Texas issued a medical license to him in 1998. The year before Arafiles came to Winkler County, the TMB restricted his ability to supervise nurse practitioners and physician assistants for three years and fined him $1,000. In that case, the TMB expressed concerns about the manner in which he oversaw a physician assistant at a weight loss clinic <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> he applied the clinic's patient care protocols.|$|E

5|$|White's Natural History {{was at once}} well {{received}} by contemporary critics and the public, and continued to be admired by a diverse range of nineteenth and twentieth century literary figures including Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Thomas Carlyle, Charles Darwin, John Ruskin, Virginia Woolf, and W.

5|$|Director Pete Docter {{first began}} writing Up in 2004. The fantasy of a flying house was {{developed}} {{on the idea}} of escaping from life when it becomes too irritating, which stemmed from his difficulty with social situations growing up. Actor and writer Tom McCarthy aided Docter and Bob Peterson in shaping the story for about three months. Docter selected an old man for the main character after drawing a picture of a grumpy old man with smiling balloons. The two men thought that an old man was a good idea for a protagonist because they felt that their experiences <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> they affect their view of the world was a rich source of humor. Docter was not concerned with an elderly protagonist, stating that children would relate to Carl {{in the way that they}} relate to their grandparents.|$|E
5|$|In 1817 an English doctor, James Parkinson, {{published}} his essay reporting six cases of paralysis agitans. An Essay on the Shaking Palsy described the characteristic resting tremor, abnormal posture and gait, paralysis and diminished muscle strength, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> the disease progresses over time. Early neurologists who made further {{additions to the}} knowledge of the disease include Trousseau, Gowers, Kinnier Wilson and Erb, and most notably Jean-Martin Charcot, whose studies between 1868 and 1881 were a landmark in the understanding of the disease. Among other advances, he made the distinction between rigidity, weakness and bradykinesia. He also championed the renaming of the disease in honor of James Parkinson.|$|E
5|$|It is {{difficult}} to pin point any one reason as being the main cause or catalyst of the mutiny. However, a recent perspective has emerged {{of the role of}} global connections. The mutiny has revealed the permeable nature of colonial boundaries <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> external influences were able to reach the colonies in Southeast Asia. The sepoys of the 5th Light Infantry were constantly being bombarded with information about what was happening outside of Singapore. As news of the fatwa issued by the Ottoman Sultan spread, an anti-British movement spearheaded by the Ghadar Party was also disseminating special pamphlets in a variety of languages which were reaching through secret channels {{into the hands of the}} sepoys. Acrimonious slogans against the British only fuelled the anti-colonial sentiment among the sepoys. Some of the slogans were “the wicked English and their allies are now attacking Islam, but the German Emperor and the Sultan of Turkey have sworn to liberate Asia from the tyranny. Now is the time to rise.... Only your strength and religious zeal are required”. The sepoys were clearly being bombarded with a lot of anti-British sentiments while being stationed on the small island of Singapore.|$|E

25|$|The {{science of}} botany was long {{established}} by Leonardo's time, a treatise {{on the subject}} having been written as early as 300BCE.

40|$|In this {{dissertation}} study, I investigate macro-level ideologies {{about language}} and language learning {{in relation to}} <b>the</b> views <b>and</b> experiences of individual immigrants {{in order to understand}} <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> those immigrants are positioned and position themselves within a specific educational and local context. My examination of micro-level processes such as interaction <b>and</b> storytelling illuminates <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> both historical structures and individual subjectivities are mediated by local practices. I examine the situated construction of identity by examining <b>the</b> specific <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> women in this study take up, resist, or transform societal level discourses about language, language learning, or the place of immigrants in U. S. society. Utilizing ethnographic methods such as document collection and analysis, participant observation, interviewing, transcribing, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> close analysis of language in use, I describe <b>and</b> analyze <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> women are positioned by macro-level discourses about language, language learning, <b>and</b> immigration; <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> individual women refugees negotiate dominant discourses about <b>the</b> status <b>and</b> importance of English; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> women 2 ̆ 7 s choices with regard to language create particular positions (and thus identities) in relation to dominant-level discourses about language and immigration. I also illuminate the fact that ideologies about language, language learning, and immigration influence and are influenced by <b>the</b> complicated <b>and</b> contradictory nature of individual action and beliefs. In this way, this ethnographic study contributes to the linguistic anthropology of education, studies of immigration and refugee resettlement, <b>and</b> research on <b>the</b> relationship between language learning and identity negotiation/construction. ...|$|R

25|$|On the March 14 {{edition of}} Saturday Night's Main Event, Demolition {{participated in a}} battle royal, won by Hercules Hernandez. Demolition became known for their {{aggressive}} style in the ring <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> they dominated their matches. Their first feud was with the team of Ken Patera and Billy Jack Haynes, which started after Ax and Smash brutalized WWF jobber Brady Boone (billed in storyline as the cousin of Billy Jack Haynes) during a televised match. Demolition claimed victories over all of the established face tag teams in the WWF at the time, including the Killer Bees (Jim Brunzell and B. Brian Blair), The Rougeau Brothers (Jacques and Raymond), British Bulldogs (Dynamite Kid and Davey Boy Smith), The Young Stallions (Paul Roma and Jim Powers), The Islanders (Haku and Tama), and Can-Am Connection (Rick Martel and Tom Zenk).

25|$|Apart from {{a passing}} mention by another (minor) author, the Annales by the Roman {{historian}} Tacitus (written ca. 98 AD) {{is the sole}} surviving ancient source on the Tacfarinas War. Tacitus gives a relatively detailed account, but its exclusivity {{makes it difficult to}} assess its accuracy and the war's significance. Tacitus was fascinated by the psychology of the emperor Tiberius, whom he regarded as the quintessential flawed tyrant, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> the long-drawn out insurgency in Africa with its many crises exposed his weaknesses. For example, the emperor's explosion of fury when he received envoys from Tacfarinas demanding concessions in return for peace. This was not only due to Tiberius' exasperation with the insurgency. Adding insult to injury, Tacfarinas was apparently a commoner by birth, an affront to the status-conscious Romans. To Tiberius, a scion of the illustrious Claudii patrician clan and ruler of a vast empire, it seemed intolerable that such a person should be seeking to deal with him on an equal basis, like a foreign king. Tacitus relates with relish Tiberius' feelings of personal humiliation.|$|E
25|$|Heinze's first book, Adapting to Abundance: Jewish Immigrants, Mass Consumption, and the Search for American Identity, was {{published}} in 1990. It was the first full-length study {{of the impact of}} American consumer culture on an immigrant group. Hasia Diner, Professor of History at New York University, said about Heinze: “Historians of immigration and Jewish history will be indebted to him for opening up whole areas of behavior which they previously shrugged off as irrelevant.” The Journal of Consumer Affairs remarked upon the variety of topics that the book explored: the rise of ad campaigns for major American products in the foreign-language press; the rise of the summer vacation among working people; installment-buying as a way for working families to obtain expensive furnishings such as pianos; the role of Jewish women as agents of assimilation through their control over family purchases; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> American abundance altered religious rituals, especially holidays such as Chanukah and Passover. Adapting to Abundance established Heinze's reputation as part of a scholarly vanguard that produced the first histories of mass consumption in Europe and America. It is widely referenced in books, articles and syllabi around the world.|$|E
