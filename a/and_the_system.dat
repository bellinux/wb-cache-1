5|$|A closed {{low-level}} circulation nearly {{developed on}} August 14 {{to the east}} of Key Largo, Florida, but it weakened due to the deep convection remaining to the north over the mid-level center. The mid-level storm continued westward and moved across Florida. After crossing Florida, Hurricane Hunters indicated a poorly defined circulation, but with winds exceeding tropical storm strength, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> was designated as Tropical Storm Erika late on August 14 while located 85miles (135km) west of Fort Myers.|$|E

Moving westward over waters greater than 82°F (28°C), Tropical Depression Ten-E rapidly strengthened into a tropical storm and was named Jimena by the National Hurricane Center.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Celia was a powerful, early-season Category5 {{tropical}} cyclone that existed over the open {{waters of the}} eastern Pacific Ocean during late June 2010. Forming out of a tropical wave about 370mi (595km) southeast of Acapulco, Mexico on June18, Celia quickly organized as deep convection consolidated around the center, attaining hurricane status by June20. Over the following days, the hurricane's winds fluctuated as wind shear impeded significant development hindering it from becoming potientially dangerous. Once this shear lightened on June24, the storm rapidly intensified to attain its peak strength with winds of 160mph (260km/h) and an estimated barometric pressure of 921mbar (hPa; 27.2inHg). Not long after reaching this strength, wind shear increased <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> entered a dry, stable environment. Over the following 42hours, Hurricane Celia's sustained winds decreased to tropical storm force <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> began to stall over the open ocean by June27. Despite highly unfavorable conditions, the storm managed to retain tropical storm status through June28 and degenerated into a non-convective remnant low that evening. The remnants of Celia drifted northward, completing a counter-clockwise loop, and dissipated on June30.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Michelle {{developed}} from a tropical wave that {{moved across the}} Atlantic, and formed into a tropical depression on October 29.

One of only four November Category 4 hurricanes, Michelle made landfall on south-central Cuba with winds of 140mph (225km/h), the strongest Cuban landfall since Hurricane Fox in the 1952 Atlantic hurricane season.|$|E

5|$|A broad area of low {{pressure}} formed over the western Caribbean Sea on October 8, and it persisted until October 11, when a tropical wave reached {{the area and}} caused the convection to organize, resulting {{in the development of a}} low-level circulation. Convection increased and organized around the circulation's center late on October 12, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> organized into Tropical Depression Thirteen on October 13 off the north coast of Honduras. The depression continued to organize over the favorable conditions present in the Caribbean Sea, and attained tropical storm status later on October 13, when it was assigned the name Irene. Operationally, the system remained a tropical wave until it already reached tropical storm strength.|$|E
5|$|A {{disturbance}} possibly {{associated with}} a tropical wave organized into Tropical Depression Fourteen-E on October 22. It strengthened into a tropical storm that same day and a hurricane on October 23. The next day, Kenna became the third Category5 hurricane of the season. A trough over Mexico recurved the hurricane, and it started accelerating towards Mexico. Despite moving over waters that were still warm, wind shear weakened the system to a minimal Category4 {{by the time of}} its landfall over Mexico late on October 25. Mountainous terrain rapidly weakened Kenna, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> dissipated early on October 26.|$|E
5|$|A {{large and}} {{convective}} tropical wave moved off the western coast of Africa in late August, developing into a tropical depression by 12:00UTC on August30 about 1,035mi (1,665km) {{east of the}} Lesser Antilles. Satellite imagery and data from a research aircraft indicated the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Fiona six hours later. Directed by an expansive mid-level ridge to its north, the cyclone moved west-northwest for several days, attaining peak winds of 65mph (100km/h) by 18:00UTC on September1 as it passed close to the northern Leeward Islands. Fiona's position between the mid-level ridge and the large circulation of Hurricane Earl off The Carolinas turned the storm northwest and then north as it encountered increasingly strong wind shear and began to weaken. Expansive outflow from Earl caused Fiona's low-level circulation to become dislocated from its convection, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> degenerated into a remnant low by 00:00UTC on September4. The remnant low passed near Bermuda, producing light winds and about 0.78in (19.8mm) of rainfall, before dissipating the next day.|$|E
