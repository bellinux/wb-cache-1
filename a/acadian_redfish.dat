50|$|The cold waters, extreme tidal mixing, {{and diverse}} {{bottom of the}} Gulf make {{it one of the}} most {{productive}} marine environments in the North Atlantic, and it furnishes habitat for many diverse species including most notably Haddock, the <b>Acadian</b> <b>redfish</b> (Sebastes fasciatus), the Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus) and the American lobster (Homarus americanus), which grows to famously large sizes in the Gulf. The waters of the Gulf of Maine system, particularly at the boundary with the Bay of Fundy are also home to the summering grounds for many different bird and whale species, most notably the highly endangered North Atlantic right whale.|$|E
40|$|A {{standardized}} {{survey of}} the nearshore fish fauna of Bonne Bay, a fjord within Gros Morne National Park in western Newfoundland, was conducted using beach seines, gill-nets and bottom trawls {{during the month of}} June over a seven year period (2002 - 2008). The survey documents the presence of 31 fish species (in 17 taxonomic families). Sampling sites varied in benthic habitat and associated fish assemblages. Both juvenile and adult life history stages of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) were present in Bonne Bay, suggesting the presence of a local population or “bay cod stock”. <b>Acadian</b> <b>redfish</b> (Sebastes fasciatus) live in the bay, and may be members of a genetically differentiable population of redfish.

40|$|The {{most recent}} stock {{assessment}} of <b>Acadian</b> <b>redfish</b> in Subarea 5 {{was completed in}} 2001 (Mayo et al. 2002), {{and the results were}} reviewed at the 33 rd Northeast Regional Stock Assessment Workshop in June, 2001 (NEFSC 2001 a, 2001 b). The assessment was based on several analyses including trends in catch/survey biomass exploitation ratios; a yield and biomass per recruit analysis; an age-structured dynamics model which incorporates information on the age composition of the landings, size and age composition of the population, and trends in relative abundance derived from commercial CPUE and research vessel survey biomass indices; and an age-aggregated biomass dynamics model. Surplus production estimates were derived from the age-structured dynamics model, and information on current biomass and fishing mortality relative to MSY-based reference points were also provided by the biomass dynamics model. At that time, the NEFSC autumn survey biomass index had increased substantially during the mid- 1990 s and had remained relatively high through 2000. The rapid increase in abundance and biomass was attributed to recruitment and growth of the 1992 and other early- 1990 s year classes. The assessment conducted in 2001 provided no basis with which to evaluate the state of the stock relative to the control rule as determined by the Overfishing Definition Review Pane...|$|E
40|$|The {{most recent}} stock {{assessment}} of Gulf of Maine-Georges Bank <b>Acadian</b> <b>redfish</b> was completed and reviewed at the 2008 Groundfish Assessment Review Meeting (GARM III) (NEFSC 2008). The assessment {{was based on}} an ASAP (ASAP 2008) model configuration which incorporates information on the age composition of the landings, size and age composition of the population, and trends in relative abundance derived from research vessel survey biomass indices. Based on the most recent assessment, estimates of redfish population biomass have been increasing in recent years. The increase in biomass estimates is produced by corresponding increases in both the NEFSC spring and autumn survey biomass indices which rose substantially during the mid- 1990 s and remained relatively high through 2007. The rapid increase in abundance and biomass was attributed to strong recruitment for some cohorts in the early- 1990 s coupled with extremely low fishing mortality. At GARM III, the stock was found to not be overfished and overfishing was not occurring. Estimated spawning biomass in 2007 after an adjustment for retrospective pattern (172, 342 mt) was approximately 64 % of the spawning biomass reference point, SSB(50 %MSP) = 271, 000 mt. The estimated fishing mortality in 2007 (0. 007) was approximately 18 % of overfishing reference point, F(50 %MSP) = 0. 0377...|$|E
40|$|Data {{from the}} EU (Spain-Portugal) bottom trawl surveys in the Division 3 M of the NAFO Regulatory Area (2004 - 2013) were {{analyzed}} to examine patterns on this zone of groundfish assemblage structure and diversity {{in relation to}} depth. 1699 hauls between 129 and 1460 m in depth were carried out. We focused on the 29 most abundant species, which made up 87. 5 % of the catch in terms of biomass. Assemblage structure was strongly correlated with depth. For the most part, changes in assemblages seem to be fairly continuous, although there were more abrupt changes at 600 m. Three main assemblages were identified. A shallow assemblage {{was found in the}} shelf. Assemblage I (Shallow) comprises the strata with depths lesser than 250 m and include American plaice (Hippoglossoides platessoides), witch flounder (Glyptocephalus cynoglossus) and Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua). Assemblage II (Intermediate) includes the strata with depths between 251 and 600 m and comprises <b>Acadian</b> <b>redfish</b> (Sebastes fasciatus), Arctic eelpout (Lycodes reticulates), thorny skate (Amblyraja radiata), longfin hake (Phycis chesteri), deepwater redfish (Sebastes mentella), spinytail skate (Bathyraja spinicauda) and Northern wolffish (Anarichas denticulatus). Three species are present in the two first assemblages: Atlantic wolffish (Anarichas lupus), golden redfish (Sebastes marinus) and spotted wolffish (Anarichas minor). Assemblage III (Deep) contains the depth strata greater than 601 m. Marlin-spike (Nezumia bairdii), scaly dragonfish (Stomias boa), Greenland halibut (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides), sloane’s viperfish (Chaulonius sloani), black dogfish (Centroscyllium fabricii), Snubnosed spiny eel (Notacanthus chemitzii), roughhead grenadier (Macrourus berglax), roundnose grenadier (Coryphaenoides rupestris), blue antimora (Antimora rostrata), threadfin rockling (Gaidropsarus ensis), bean’s sawtoothed eel (Serrivomer beanii), Northern cutthroat eel (Syphanobranchus kaupii), lanternfish (Lampanyctus sp), vahls’s eelpout (Lycodes vahlii), Arctic skate (Amblyraja hyperborea) and Demon catshark (Apristurus sp) formed Assemblage III. Despite dramatic changes in biomass and abundance of the species in the area, the boundaries and composition of the assemblages seem to be similar to the period before the collapse. Extending depth range to 1460 m, no another boundaries were found. Although some changes were evident, the main ones were replacements of the dominant species in several assemblages and bathymetric range extension of distribution of some species. <b>Acadian</b> <b>redfish</b> and golden redfish appear to be the dominant species in the shallowest assemblage instead of Atlantic cod that were dominant in the period before the collapse in the area; redfish is the dominant species in the second shallow and intermediate assemblages. Diversity appears inversely related to biomass in the different assemblages. Despite the collapse in some species and the permanent fishing activity target to the North Shrimp (Pandalus borealis), redfish (Sebastes spp) and Greenland halibut, the overall pattern of demersal fish assemblages remains similar over time. This pattern is similar in other Atlantic areas; it indicates that changes in the fish populations in Northwest Atlantic have been produced on a large scale and are not limited to specific areas...|$|E
40|$|Wehypothesized that a {{floating}} trawl bridle {{that does not}} contact the seabed would reduce the herding of fish, especially bottom dwelling floun-ders, and thus reduce bycatch of these fish in shrimp trawls. We further hypothesized that, due to the non-herding nature of northern shrimp (Pandalus borealis), the use of anoff-bottomfloating bridlewouldnot reduce shrimp catch. These hypotheseswere tested in the field by comparing a trawl with regular bottom-tendering wire bridles and the same trawl with floating synthetic bridles in the Gulf of Maine northern shrimp fishery. As expected, {{no statistically significant differences}} in catch rates and size were found for the targeted northern shrimp (146. 3 + 10. 58 kg h 21 control vs. 140. 8 + 9. 35 kg h 21, p 0. 13). Total finfish bycatch was reduced by 14. 9 %, and the difference was statistically different (p 0. 01). The most important reduction was the catch of juvenile American plaice (Hippoglossoides platessoides) with a significant reduction of 20. 0 % (p 0. 01). For witch flounder (Glyptocephalus cynoglossus), a reduction of 19. 3 % was found, but it was not statistically significant (p 0. 14). The reduction of <b>Acadian</b> <b>redfish</b> (Sebastes fasciatus) (by 28. 0 %, p 0. 02) was also statistically different. Catch of targeted silver hake (Merluccius bilinearis) was reduced by 10. 8 %, but the difference was only marginally significant (p 0. 07). An analysis of length frequencies for the targeted shrimp and major bycatch species revealed no size-related selection between the gears with regular bridles and floating bridles. The reductions in flounder bycatch indicate reduced herding of benthic species when the bridles are kept off bottom. This easy modificatio...|$|E
40|$|There are {{two species}} of redfish, the deep-sea redfish (Sebastes mentella) and the <b>Acadian</b> <b>redfish</b> (Sebastes fasciatus) that have been commercially fished and {{reported}} collectively in fishery statistics in Div. 3 LN. After peaking at an historical high of 79 000 tons in 1987 catches declined to a minimum about 500 tons in 1996, being kept at a low level since then. Catch on {{the last years of}} open fishery (1990 - 1997) and by-catch on the moratorium years (1998 - 2004) are analyzed against recent trends of survey indices. The 1991 - 2004 Canadian spring and autumn surveys are the main source of information used in this work to assess the relative abundance and dynamics of the beaked redfish population on Div. 3 LN. The surveys demonstrate considerable inter-annual variability, the changes frequently being the result of single large catches being taken in different years. Sex ratio and maturity ogives at length were applied to survey abundance at length, for each division and survey series, in order to estimate survey female spawning stock biomass. Instead of looking to the survey indices on a year-to-year basis, trends of the respective mean values were analysed on a broader time scale. The assemblage of Div. 3 L and 3 N survey indices suggests that stock has been increasing from the early 1990 s to the mid- 2000 s in terms of abundance, biomass, and female spawning biomass. However the magnitude of this increase remains difficult to quantify. Estimates of exploitation rate suggest that fishing mortality should be at a very low level when compared to {{the first half of the}} 1990 s...|$|E
40|$|There are {{two species}} of redfish in Divisions 3 L and 3 N, the deep-sea redfish (Sebastes mentella) and the <b>Acadian</b> <b>redfish</b> (Sebastes fasciatus) that have been commercially fished and {{reported}} collectively as redfish in fishery statistics. Both species, occurring on Div. 3 LN and managed as a single stock, don’t belong to isolated local populations but, on the contrary, {{are part of a}} large Northwest Atlantic complex ranging from the Gulf of Maine to south of Baffin Island. The present ASPIC assessment of this stock is based on the logistic form of a non-equilibrium surplus production model (Schaeffer, 1954; Prager, 1994), adjusted to a standardized catch rate series (Power, 1997) and, for the first time, to all stratified-random bottom trawl surveys conducted in various years and seasons in Div. 3 L and Div. 3 N from 1978 onwards. Both CPUE and surveys were used with all observations within each series. In order to proceed on the threshold of the new 2014 approach, and taking into account that since then no substantial changes appear to have occurred {{on the state of the}} stock, the main features of the previous input framework were kept, with MSY fixed at 1960 - 1985 average catch and the rest of the approved 2014 assessment framework updated. The 3 L Spanish survey, the only ongoing survey so far outside the analysis, has now been successfully included on this assessment framework (relative inter-quartile range from bootstrap analysis for the last two assessments highlight the higher consistence of most of the 2016 assessment results when compared with the ones from 2014). ASPIC assessment results confirm a stable stock from the 1960 ’s to the first half of the 1980 ’s, sustaining an average yield of 21 000 t. Stock declined with a sudden rise of the catch over the late 1980 ’s first half of the 1990, and increased since then, after catches fell to a residual level with the stock collapse. Assessment results also confirm that the maximum observed sustainable yield (MSY) of 21 000 t can be a long term sustainable yield if fishing mortality stands at 0. 11 /year, exploiting a correspondent Bmsy at 190 000 t. 2 There is a very high probability that the stock was at the beginning of 2016 at or above Bmsy, after crossing 2015 under a fishing mortality most likely at or below 50 % Fmsy. There is also a very high probability that catch on 2016 at 10 400 t TAC and on 2017 and 2018 at the predicted increases approved in the 2014 Risk‐Based Management Strategy for 3 LN Redfish, will keep fishing mortality on 2018 below Fmsy and biomass at the beginning of 2019 above Bmsy.

40|$|There are {{two species}} of redfish in Divisions 3 L and 3 N, the deep-sea redfish (Sebastes mentella) and the <b>Acadian</b> <b>redfish</b> (Sebastes fasciatus) that have been commercially fished and {{reported}} collectively as redfish in fishery statistics. Redfish in Div. 3 LN {{is regarded as a}} management unit composed of two Grand Bank populations from those two very similar redfish species. The present ASPIC assessment is based on the logistic form of a non-equilibrium surplus production model (Schaeffer, 1954; Prager, 1994), adjusted to a standardized catch rate series (Power, 1997) and to most of the stratified-random bottom trawl surveys conducted in various years and seasons in Div. 3 L and Div. 3 N from 1978 onwards. Both CPUE and surveys were used with all observations of each series. This assessment is not a follow up of the previous ones (Ávila de Melo et al., 2012 and 2010). The logistic Schaefer production model (1954) incorporated in ASPIC operating model (Prager, 1994) can not cope anymore with the most recent biomass increases observed in both spring and (mainly) autumn Canadian 3 LN surveys, unless it is allowed to provide unrealistic assessment results. And continuing to strip off the highs of each one of these series, {{in order to get a}} picture in line to what is the perception of the stock history from commercial and survey data trends, is no longer a valid option, as reflected on the last STACFIS research recommendation on this matter (NAFO, 2012). Being so, input has been reframed opening room to a new combination of Canadian autumn 3 L and 3 N surveys. The inclusion of the Spanish spring survey on Div. 3 N and the removal of the historical CPUE series have also been considered. Two selected frameworks options have finally run with MSY kept constant at an initial starting guess, instead of being estimated by the model. Before entering the latest (2013) ASPIC Suite flow, the input selected from exploratory analysis was submitted to a sensitivity test in order to evaluate the robustness of the new framework against variability on random number seed, start user guesses for key model parameters and last year survey biomass. The consistency of the new ASPIC assessment with their predecessors was checked by comparison of biomass and fishing mortality fit trajectories against previous ones from the 2012 and 2010 assessments. A 2014 - 2012 retrospective analysis was also performed with good results (small retro bias on relative biomass and fishing 2 mortality in response to the general increase of the still standing survey series), and the assessment pursued successfully to bootstrap mode (again good consistency with previous results) and projections. A medium term management plan is finally proposed, based on bi-annual increases of the catch from the present TAC level of 6 500 t up to target catch/TAC of 18 100 t, the 2014 equilibrium yield from the present assessment, that should be in place by 2019 - 2020. This management plan allows, with a very high probability, that biomass is kept above Bmsy and fishing mortality below Fmsy...|$|E
40|$|There are {{two species}} of redfish in Divisions 3 L and 3 N, the deep-sea redfish (Sebastes mentella) and the <b>Acadian</b> <b>redfish</b> (Sebastes fasciatus) that have been commercially fished and {{reported}} collectively as redfish in fishery statistics. Redfish in Div. 3 LN {{is regarded as a}} management unit composed of two Grand Bank populations from those two very similar redfish species. The present ASPIC assessment is based on the logistic form of a non-equilibrium surplus production model (Schaeffer, 1954; Prager, 1994), adjusted to a standardized catch rate series (Power, 1997) and to most of the stratified-random bottom trawl surveys conducted in various years and seasons in Div. 3 L and Div. 3 N from 1978 onwards. These surveys were framed according to the input formulation previously adopted on the 2 nd take of the ASPIC 2008 assessment (Ávila de Melo and Alpoim, 2010 a). The assessment was preceded by an exploratory analysis to check the response of the model to the inclusion of the Spanish spring survey series on Div. 3 N and to the 2010 - 2011 update of the remaining three Canadian survey series that are at present the backbone input of this assessment. Each of these series includes recently high points that are well above their overall increasing trends, observed 2002 onwards. The analysis point out that in terms of consistency with previous assessments and the past history of the redfish fishery, as well as performance of the model, the ASPIC 2012 option with the exclusion of the Spanish survey and the removal of the recent outliers from the respective Canadian series represents the better update of the survey data input framework. The chosen input formulation run afterwards with different last year survey results and different starting guesses for key parameters and different random number seeds, in order to test the robustness of ASPIC results to turbulence in the inputs used to initialize the model deterministic run. A 2012 versus 2010 ASPIC comparative assessment (both on FIT and BOT modes) and a 2012 - 2010 retrospective analysis were also carried out to check the consistency between the two last full assessments and the magnitude of bias on relative biomass and fishing mortality in response to the general increase of the still standing survey series. Regardless the input formulations, the starting guess region, the mode of the ASPIC runs or the retrospective patterns, the 2012 assessment reiterates the main conclusion of the previous ones: the biomass of redfish in Div. 3 LN is above Bmsy, while fishing mortality is well below Fmsy. Most recent catches continue to be at a low level on the historical context of this fishery and the answer of the stock to a direct fishery of the magnitude of years between the mid 1960 ’s and the mid 1980 ’s is unknown. Projections were made on the short term, in order to select a 2013 - 2012 catch roof large enough to consolidate the reopening of a redfish direct fishery on divisions 3 L and 3 N but keeping a high probability of the stock staying above Bmsy. This high probability is defined by the lower 80 % confidence limit of the projected relative biomass trajectory being at or above Bmsy in 2013 - 2015...|$|E
