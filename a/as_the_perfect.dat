5|$|During {{this period}} the {{population}} of the nearby village of Burnside was expanding and required a new water supply. First Creekwhich runs down Waterfall Gully and enters the River Torrens near today's Botanic Gardenswas seen <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>perfect</b> solution to the water shortage. A weir was built during 1881 and 1882, and was made to hold approximately two megalitres (530,000USgallons) of water. A pipeline was constructed to the reservoir at Burnside South, and from there the water was used throughout the surrounding area. As a side effect, the weir also reduced the volume of water available to the local market gardeners, and over many years that aspect of the region disappeared.|$|E
5|$|October 31, 1991– The 1991 Halloween Nor'easter, {{also known}} <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Perfect</b> Storm, causes strong waves {{of up to}} 30feet (9m) in height. High tides along the shore were only surpassed by the 1944 hurricane, while {{significant}} bay flooding occurred. Strong waves and persistent intense winds cause extreme beach erosion, amounting to 13.5million cubic feet (383,000m3) of sand lost in one location. In all, damage amounts to $90million (1991USD, $142million 2008USD), though no deaths occur in the state.|$|E

5|$|Belton House is a Grade I listed {{country house}} in Belton near Grantham, Lincolnshire, England. The mansion is {{surrounded}} by formal gardens {{and a series of}} avenues leading to follies within a larger wooded park. Belton {{has been described as a}} compilation of all that is finest of Carolean architecture, the only truly vernacular style of architecture that England had produced since the Tudor period. The house has also been described as the most complete example of a typical English country house; the claim has even been made that Belton's principal facade was the inspiration for the modern British motorway signs which give directions to stately homes. Only Brympton d'Evercy has been similarly lauded <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>perfect</b> English country house.|$|E
5|$|Bennett {{declined}} the offer to be Dole's running mate but suggested Kemp, a man described as Dole's antagonist. On August 16, 1996, the Republican Party chose Kemp as its vice presidential , running alongside former Senator Dole. Kemp {{was seen as}} a means to attract conservative and libertarian-minded voters like those of tough nomination-challengers Forbes and Pat Buchanan. Kemp was chosen over Connie Mack, John McCain, and Carroll Campbell, and it is assumed that this was partly because Kemp had several former staffers in influential positions as Dole's senior advisors. Dole had had a long history of representing the budget-balancing faction of the Party, while Kemp had had a long history of representing the tax-cutting advocates, and Kemp's tax-cutting fiscal track record was seen <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>perfect</b> fit for the ticket. When Kemp became Dole's running mate in 1996, they appeared {{on the cover of the}} August 19, 1996 issue of Time magazine, but the pair barely edged out a story on the reported discovery of extraterrestrial life on Mars, which was so close to being the cover story that Time inset it on the cover and wrote about how difficult the decision was.|$|E
5|$|Eve, part of Passions Russell family, is {{introduced}} <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>perfect</b> wife of T. C. Russell {{and mother of}} Whitney and Simone. Eve's desperation to conceal all evidence of her past relationship—and child—with Julian Crane leads to the breakup of her marriage and family, especially when her adoptive sister Liz Sanbourne arrives in the fictional Northeastern town of Harmony and ruins Eve's life for abandoning her first family. Later storylines focus on Eve's on-again, off-again relationship with Julian and her search for their son, who is revealed as Vincent Clarkson despite long-running speculation by the show's characters and media outlets that he was Chad Harris-Crane. Ross and Johnson made cameo appearances as Eve and T. C. in the series finale of the NBC primetime drama Providence. At {{the end of the}} show, several props and costumes related to Eve were sold in an auction, along with other items from the show.|$|E

5|$|Following the storm's passage, the Long Island Lighting Company used 165workers {{to restore}} the power outages on Long Island. In Connecticut, state {{officials}} deployed about 200trucks to remove debris on roads. The Massachusetts National Guard was activated to assist in relief efforts. In Rhode Island, a man was killed while repairing damage caused by Bob. Beaches in the state re-opened by {{five days after the}} storm. The hurricane mixed the waters in Long Island Sound and prevented the algae bloom that happened in previous summers. In the days after Bob, the Commonwealth Electric Company brought electricians from outside the company and put their own workers on 16‑hour shifts to restore power across Massachusetts. Most Massachusetts residents, excluding those living on Cape Cod, had their power restored within five days. The hurricane struck {{toward the end of the}} summer, which significantly impacted the tourism season already in the midst of a recession. The New England coast was affected by a powerful nor'easter known <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Perfect</b> Storm about two months after the hurricane struck the region. Some locations experienced worse damage from the October storm than from Bob.|$|E
5|$|Playford {{became a}} wartime Premier in 1939 when Australia, {{as part of}} the British Empire, entered World War II. Later in the war, cut off from {{traditional}} suppliers of manufactures, the country was forced to create its own. Armaments and munitions factories needed to be created to supply the war effort, and Playford was vociferous in advocating South Australia <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>perfect</b> location for these. It was far from the battlegrounds and had the most efficient labour force in the nation. British Tube Mills opened a mill in the inner-northern suburbs. Ammunition factories were built in the northern and western suburbs of Adelaide, as well as in some smaller installations in regional centres, and construction on a shipyard began in Whyalla. Having strenuously opposed a construction of a pipeline to pump water from Morgan in the River Murray to Whyalla for the steelworks and blast furnace there before his ascension to the premiership, Playford oversaw approval of the Morgan-Whyalla pipeline in 1940 and its completion in 1944. He also reversed his previous opposition to Butler's pine plantation and sawmill program, authorising an expansion of the program in the state's southeast.|$|E
5|$|The most {{significant}} storm {{of the season}} was Hurricane Bob, {{which at the time}} was among the ten costliest United States hurricanes. After brushing the Outer Banks of North Carolina and Long Island in New York, the hurricane made landfall on Rhode Island. It caused $1.5billion in damage (1991USD), mostly in Massachusetts, and 17fatalities. The strongest hurricane of the season was Claudette, which reached peak winds of 135mph (215km/h) near Bermuda. It passed near the island but did not cause any damage. Tropical Storm Fabian was the only tropical storm to move over or near Cuba or Florida, producing heavy rainfall but no damage. Hurricane Grace, the final named storm of the season, provided the energy that {{led to the development of}} a powerful nor'easter known <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Perfect</b> Storm. Originating from an extratropical storm, the Perfect Storm intensified while moving westward toward New England, leaving $200million in damage and causing coastal damage from Puerto Rico to Florida and northward through Canada. It later transitioned into a hurricane over the Gulf Stream, finally dissipating over Nova Scotia on November2.|$|E

In fact in this act Nan/Zoe is now played by the actress who played the real Zoe in Act 1. However she still has the same humorous flaws, movements and habits. She has also been programmed to respond to certain trigger words using phrases and actions which Jerome anticipates will be useful – but comedy results from the unexpected use of the trigger words in normal conversation.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in {{the second}} half of the 18th century, the unique {{political}} system of the Commonwealth, the quasi-democratic Golden Liberty, had turned into anarchy. The Polish nobility's (szlachta) privilege of liberum veto, first introduced as a safeguard against tyranny of the monarch, allowed any deputy to the Sejm to stop and annul the entire session. This was soon seen by the neighbouring powers - especially Prussia and Russia - <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>perfect</b> opportunity to disrupt the Commonwealth from inside, and soon many Sejms were dissolved by a deputy bribed by one of the foreign powers. With an impotent Sejm, the Commonwealth stagnated, as it was impossible to reform the government, raise taxes or increase the size of the army.|$|E
