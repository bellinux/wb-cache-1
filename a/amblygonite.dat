50|$|<b>Amblygonite</b> is a fluorophosphate mineral, (Li,Na)AlPO4(F,OH), {{composed}} of lithium, sodium, aluminium, phosphate, fluoride and hydroxide. The mineral occurs in pegmatite deposits and is easily mistaken for albite and other feldspars. Its density, cleavage and flame test for lithium are diagnostic. <b>Amblygonite</b> forms a series with montebrasite, the low fluorine endmember. Geologic occurrence is in granite pegmatites, high-temperature tin veins, and greisens. <b>Amblygonite</b> occurs with spodumene, apatite, lepidolite, tourmaline, and other lithium-bearing minerals in pegmatite veins.

5000|$|Brazilianite, NaAl3(PO4)2(OH)4 is a hydrous sodium {{aluminium}} phosphate that forms through the metasomantic alteration of amblygonite-montebrasite.

An exploration project for rare-element pegmatites should begin with an examination of a regional geology map. Rare-element pegmatites occur along large regional-scale faults in greenschist and amphibolite facies metamorphic terranes. They are typically hosted by mafic metavolcanic or metasedimentary rocks, and are located near peraluminous granite plutons (A/CNK > 1. 0).

During an investigation of the alteration products of beryl from the Dernburg peg-matite, Karibib, South West Africa (Roering & Heckroodt, 1964), a mineral with a 30 A spacing was detected in the fine fraction. The responses of reflections, attributed to this mineral, to treatment with organic liquids indicated that the mineral is of an expanding lattice type. The fine fraction was subsequently beneficiated in an attempt to obtain a pure sample for a detailed investigation. The altered beryl occurs in a pegmatite located in quartzites of the Damara System. It has been mined for beryl, <b>amblygonite,</b> and tantalite. Replacement bodies consisting of lithium-bearing mica and albite also occur, with or without cleave-landite-rich borders. The altered beryl occurs where these cleavelandite-rich borders abut against he beryl in the central zone of the pegmatite. From field relationships it would appear that this alteration was caused by deuteric pegmatite solutions intimately associated with the formation of the lithium mica-bearing replacement zones and their cleavelandite-rich margins. PREPARATION OF SAMPLE Two small specimens of highly altered beryl were crushed in an iron pestle and mortar, and any contaminating iron was removed by means of a strong magnet.

40|$|A {{sample from}} the Kibingo {{granitic}} pegmatite, Rwanda, shows a striking assemblage of an alluaudite-group mineral with heterosite. The core of alluaudite s. l. is strongly pleochroic in blue green to pinkish grey hues, and is rimmed by an irregular border, weakly pleochroic in yellow brown to greenish yellow tints. The pleochroic core is very rich in Na (up to 9. 35 % Na 2 O), whereas the yellowish green border is depleted in Na (3. 75 % Na 2 O) and more oxidized. The decrease of the Na contents is not accompanied by significant {{variations of the}} ratio Fe-tot/(Fe-tot + Mn). This mechanism represents the progressive transition of hagendorfite to alluaudite sensu stricto, and results from an oxidation, Na+ + Fe 2 + [...] > rectangle + Fe 3 +. Heterosite exhibits cracks that are parallel {{to one of the}} cleavage directions, and that are favorable {{to the development of a}} product of alteration, identified as cyrilovite. Heterosite shows a chemical composition close to the idealized formula (Fe 0. 853 +Mn 0. 153 +) PO 4, with a Mg content constant and quite low, i. e., 0. 023 Mg apfu. The Kibingo heterosite seems to be the Fe-richest member known so far.

A drill hole down to 300 m has intersected the granite from top to bottom, and revealed three petrographic zones: K-feldspar-rich facies in the lower part, albite-rich facies in the middle part, and Ab- and Kfs-rich facies in the upper part. Geochemically, the Yichun granite belongs to the phosphorus-rich type of rare-element-enriched granite. The phosphorus is concentrated in the feldspars, which contain up to 0. 93 wt % P 2 O 5. It is less enriched in feldspars in the middle part, where primary <b>amblygonite</b> is abundant. Principal accessory minerals include columbite–tantalite, cassiterite, zircon, and wodginite in all facies, and microlite in the middle facies. The composition of the columbite-group minerals corresponds to manganocolumbite and manganotantalite. Zircon contains mostly 4 to 8 wt % HfO 2, but the HfO 2 contents may reach up to 22 wt % at the rim.

The KIB and KAB are characterised {{by the presence of}} numerous rare metal mineralised (Nb–Ta–Sn) pegmatites and Sn–W mineralised quartz veins that are related to the youngest granite generation, i. e. the G 4 -granites in Rwanda, which formed at 986 ± 10 Ma. The pegmatites of the Gatumba area (western Rwanda) have historically been mined for their columbite-tantalite and cassiterite mineralisation, but contain also beryl, apatite, spodumene, <b>amblygonite,</b> and rare phosphates. Columbite-tantalite formed during the crystallisation of the pegmatites, followed by intense alkali metasomatism, i. e. widespread growth of albite and white mica. The major part of the cassiterite mineralisation is, however, concentrated in zones associated with intense phyllic alteration. U–Pb ages of columbite-tantalite samples vary between ∼ 975 Ma and ∼ 930 Ma. The oldest ages (975 + 8. 2 /− 8. 3 Ma and 966 + 8. 7 /− 8. 6 Ma) overlap with previous reported Rb–Sr ages of the emplacement of the pegmatites (∼ 965 Ma) and are interpreted to reflect the crystallisation of the Nb–Ta mineralisation. The youngest ages (951 ± 15 Ma to 936 ± 14 Ma) are apparently related to variable degrees of resetting by (metasomatic) post-crystallisation processes. The resetting could either be due to recrystallisation of early Nb–Ta minerals or due to the disturbance of the U–Pb isotopic signature of the Nb–Ta minerals. The 40 Ar– 39 Ar spectra of muscovite samples associated with different steps in the paragenesis of the pegmatites show a spread of apparent ages between ∼ 940 Ma and ∼ 560 Ma that reflect Late Neoproterozoic tectonothermal events.

Schorl from the lepidolite-subtype sills that cut granite G 1 has higher Mg/(Mg + Fe) than schorl from metasomatised granite at sill walls and resulted from the mixing of magmatic fluids carrying B and some Fe with a meteoric fluid that has interacted with the host granite G 1 and carried Fe and Mg.

It occurs in a complex (Li-bearing) petalite-subtype pegmatite with common lepidolite, Li-bearing tourmalines, and <b>amblygonite</b> at Nová Ves near Český Krumlov, southern Bohemia, Moldanubian Zone, Czech Republic. This zoned pegmatite dike cross-cuts a serpentinite body enclosed in leucocratic granulites. Pink darrellhenryite forms columnar crystals (sometimes in parallel arrangement) up to 3 cm long and up 2 cm thick, associated with albite (var. cleavelandite), minor quartz, K-feldspar, petalite, rare polylithionite, and locally rare pollucite. The optical properties and the single-crystal structure study (R 1 = 0. 019) of darrellhenryite are consistent with trigonal symmetry, ω = 1. 636 (2), ɛ = 1. 619 (2), birefringence: 0. 017, space group R 3 m, ɑ = 15. 809 (2), c = 7. 089 (1) Å, V = 1534. 4 (4) Å^ 3, and Z = 3. The chemical analysis, in combination with the results from the single-crystal structure refinement, gives the formula ^X(Na_(0. 58) Ca_(0. 01) □_(0. 41)) _(1. 00) ^Y(Li_(1. 05) Al_(1. 95)) _(3. 00) ^ZAl_ 6 (BO_ 3) _ 3 ^T(Si_ 6 O_(18)) ^V(OH) _ 3 ^W(O_(0. 66) F_(0. 34)) _(1. 00), which can be simplified to an ideal formula of Na(LiAl_ 2) Al_ 6 (BO_ 3) _ 3 Si_ 6 O_(18) (OH) _ 3 O. The strongest lines of the powder pattern [d in Å (I, hkl) ] are 4. 180 (39, 211), 3. 952 (54, 220), 3. 431 (73, 012), 2. 925 (100, 122), 2. 555 (90, 051), 2. 326 (42, 511), 2. 029 (42, 223), 2. 021 (42, 152), 1. 901 (50, 342), 1. 643 (49, 603). The density is D_(meas) = 3. 03 (3) g/cm^ 3, D_(calc) = 3. 038 g/cm^ 3. Darrellhenryite is considered to have crystallized in Li- and B-rich but F-moderate environments in complex pegmatites; no influence of higher activity of O on the darrellhenryite formation is implied from its mineral assemblage. The name is for Darrell J. Henry, Professor of Geology at the Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, U. S. A., an expert on the mineralogy, petrology, crystal chemistry, and nomenclature of tourmaline-supergroup minerals...|$|E
