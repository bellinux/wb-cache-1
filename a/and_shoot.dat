5|$|American {{gooseberry}} mildew and {{powdery mildew}} can infect the leaves <b>and</b> <b>shoot</b> tips, and botrytis may cause the fruit to rot in a wet season. Currant and gooseberry leaf spot (Drepanopeziza ribis) is another disease of blackcurrants, {{but it is}} not usually a serious problem as most cultivars now have some resistance.|$|E
5|$|P.N.03 was {{developed}} {{on a tight}} schedule {{in an attempt to}} offset Capcom's poor fiscal year. However, the game received mixed reviews and failed commercially. Several critics found the game repetitive and unintuitive. They were divided on its gameplay mechanics: some disliked its controls—specifically the inability to move <b>and</b> <b>shoot</b> simultaneously—while others compared it favorably to golden age arcade games. Mikami repurposed ideas from P.N.03 in his 2010 game Vanquish.|$|E

50|$|The diet changes {{based on}} season and availability. In the wet season {{it may be}} roughly 70% fruit, 25% fresh leaves <b>and</b> <b>shoots,</b> <b>and</b> the rest being fungi and animal food. The dry season sees 40% fruits, 23% flowers, 16% fresh leaves <b>and</b> <b>shoots,</b> <b>and</b> the rest fungi, moss, and animal food.|$|R
50|$|Like many American {{films of}} the time, Betrayed was subject to cuts by city and state film {{censorship}} boards. The Chicago Board of Censors cut {{an attack on a}} man, <b>shooting</b> <b>and</b> two rioting scenes in store, attack on driver, shooting man off horse, last part of love scene, <b>and</b> <b>shooting</b> girl <b>and</b> <b>shooting</b> man.|$|R
5|$|The {{secondary}} battery plotting rooms were down below the waterline {{and inside the}} armor belt. They contained four complete sets of fire control equipment needed to aim <b>and</b> <b>shoot</b> at four targets. Each set included a Mark 1A computer, a Mark 6 Stable Element, FC Radar controls and displays, Parallax correctors, a switchboard, and crew to operate it all.|$|E

5|$|Using touch controls, {{the player}} would aim {{with one of}} their {{characters}} <b>and</b> <b>shoot</b> them towards enemies like billiards, with the character bouncing off upon contact with enemies or walls until it ran out of momentum. After the player's turn was over, the enemies {{would do the same}} thing, and attack the player's characters. With a certain number of turns passed, the player could choose to activate their characters' individual special attacks.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} {{protective}} {{measures have been}} implemented, including site access restrictions, the collection and cold-storage of seed, and the treatment of plants with phosphite. Phosphite boosts the resistance of both infected and uninfected plants, and also acts as a direct fungicide. Aerial spraying of phosphite boosts plant survival and slows the spread of infection, but must be carefully managed {{as studies have shown}} that foliar spraying of phosphite adversely affects root <b>and</b> <b>shoot</b> growth. Direct injection of phosphite into the stem of each tree appears to lack this disadvantage, but is costly to administer and restricted to known plants.|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the Second Boer War in 1899, Guest was below the minimum age of 18 for enlisting. He nevertheless managed to join the First City Volunteers, a Grahamstown regiment in which his father had served. Its task of guarding a bridge over a railway line was unappealing, so he took the opportunity of joining the Eastern Province Light Horse, attached to the Highland Brigade, which was recruiting volunteers who could both ride <b>and</b> <b>shoot.</b> Early in the Brigade's advance into the Orange Free State {{on its way to the}} relief of Kimberley, Guest got food poisoning and he returned to Grahamstown.|$|E
5|$|By September, several Blenheims were {{equipped}} {{with what was}} now officially known as AI Mk. I and training of the crews began with No. 25 Squadron at RAF Northolt. Robert Hanbury Brown, a physicist who would later work on radar in the US, and Keith Wood joined them in August 1939, helping fitters keep the systems operational, {{and coming up with}} useful methods for interception. Near the end of August, Dowding visited the base and saw the radars in the nose and pointed out to Bowen that the enemy gunners would see the light from the CRTs <b>and</b> <b>shoot</b> the operator. The sets were re-fitted once again, returning {{to the rear of the}} fuselage, which caused more delays.|$|E

40|$|The {{plant hormone}} auxin affects cell {{elongation}} in both roots <b>and</b> <b>shoots.</b> In roots, the predominant action of auxin is to inhibit cell elongation while in shoots auxin, at normal physiological levels, stimulates elongation. The {{question of whether}} the primary receptor for auxin is the same in roots <b>and</b> <b>shoots</b> has not been resolved. In addition to its action on cell elongation in roots <b>and</b> <b>shoots,</b> auxin is transported in a polar fashion in both organs. Although auxin transport is well characterized in both roots <b>and</b> <b>shoots,</b> there is relatively little information on the connection, if any, between auxin transport and its action on elongation. In particular, {{it is not clear whether}} the protein mediating polar auxin movement is separate from the protein mediating auxin action on cell elongation or whether these two processes might be mediated by one and the same receptor. We examined the identity of the auxin growth receptor in roots <b>and</b> <b>shoots</b> by comparing the response of roots <b>and</b> <b>shoots</b> of the grass Zea mays L. and the legume Vigna mungo L. to indole- 3 -acetic acid, 2 -naphthoxyacetic acid, 4, 6 -dichloroindoleacetic acid, and 4, 7 -dichloroindoleacetic acid. We also studied whether or not a single protein might mediate both auxin transport and auxin action by comparing the polar transport of indole- 3 -acetic acid and 2 -naphthoxyacetic acid through segments from Vigna hypocotyls and maize coleoptiles. For all of the assays performed (root elongation, <b>shoot</b> elongation, <b>and</b> polar transport) the action and transport of the auxin derivatives was much greater in the dicots than in the grass species. The preservation of ligand specificity between roots <b>and</b> <b>shoots</b> <b>and</b> the parallels in ligand specificity between auxin transport and auxin action on growth are consistent with the hypothesis that the auxin receptor is the same in roots <b>and</b> <b>shoots</b> <b>and</b> that this protein may mediate auxin efflux as well as auxin action in both organ types...|$|R
5|$|By the Korean War, {{jet engines}} had {{replaced}} propellers on aircraft, which severely limited {{the ability of}} the 20 mm and 40 mm AA batteries and their gun systems to track <b>and</b> <b>shoot</b> down enemy planes. Consequently, the AA guns and their associated fire-control systems were removed when reactivated. New Jersey received this treatment in 1967, and the others followed in their 1980s modernizations. In the 1980s, each ship also received a quartet of Phalanx Close in Weapon System (CIWS) mounts which made use of a radar system to locate incoming enemy projectiles and destroy them with a 20mm Gatling gun before they could strike the ship.|$|E
5|$|Darren Craig {{directed}} the song's music video, which Candy envisioned as a satire on political and socioeconomic repression {{of women and}} misogyny. In the video, Candy appears {{with a group of}} oppressed women who rise up against a tyrannical man <b>and</b> <b>shoot</b> him with golden rifles. The visual attracted critical attention from media commentators, who discussed the possible inspirations for the women and the setting. Critics positively responded to the music video, complimenting it as vibrant and outrageous.|$|E
5|$|During the game, Quickdraw must {{locate the}} wanted outlaws one by one. Once an outlaw {{has been found}} and shot (shooting the outlaw does not kill him, but only initiates a duel), the game shifts to the first-person {{targeting}} minigame. This time, the player must shoot the rapidly moving outlaw as quickly as possible. The player can either wait for the outlaw to draw, or take the initiative <b>and</b> <b>shoot</b> first, which will make the bandit draw his weapon as well. If the player successfully shoots an outlaw, a bounty is paid (increasing with every round), and a new outlaw enters the town.|$|E

5|$|Firearm {{owners are}} allowed to {{practice}} only at licensed shooting ranges and may otherwise use the firearm only in case of self-defense, or when permitted by other laws (e.g. hunting). As of 2014, there are almost two hundred places opened for the public. Any adult can visit such a range <b>and</b> <b>shoot</b> from available weapons, without restrictions or permits. A person without a gun license has to be supervised (if younger than 18, then by a person at least 21 years old {{who has been a}} holder of a gun license for at least 3 years).|$|E
5|$|In the game, {{the player}} {{controls}} Captain Martin Walker, who is sent into a post-catastrophe Dubai with an elite Delta Force team on a recon mission. As the game progresses, Walker's mental health deteriorates, {{as he begins}} to experience hallucinations and slowly realizes the horror of war. Players can hide behind cover, vault over obstacles, <b>and</b> <b>shoot</b> enemies while utilizing a variety of gadgets. Sand is a key gameplay mechanic that can be manipulated to defeat enemies. Included with the game is an online multiplayer mode, developed separately by Darkside Game Studios, allowing players to engage in both cooperative and competitive gameplay.|$|E
5|$|On October 26, 1985, Marty {{meets his}} {{scientist}} friend, Dr. Emmett Brown, {{in a shopping}} mall parking lot {{in the early morning}} hours.

Doc demonstrates the time navigation system by punching in the date November 5, 1955: the day he invented time travel. A moment later, the Libyans arrive <b>and</b> <b>shoot</b> Doc. Marty escapes in the DeLorean, but inadvertently activates the time machine, and arrives in 1955 without enough plutonium to return.|$|E

Once inside the cave, Lady and Bubblegum enter into a biologically-engineered dungeon and are attacked by mysterious hand-like creatures that attempt to grab them. Lady manages to phase through a wall, and the two hear the Ice King's voice coming from a ventilation shaft. Inside the shaft, the two are attacked by a giant tongue before they enter into a room covered with eyes. As Bubblegum and Lady approach the room's exit, the eyes activate <b>and</b> <b>shoot</b> laser at the duo, incapacitating Lady.|$|E
