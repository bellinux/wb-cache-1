40|$|In this paper, {{acoustic}} cues {{and human}} capability for discriminating singing <b>and</b> <b>speaking</b> voices are discussed {{to develop an}} automatic discrimination system for singing <b>and</b> <b>speaking</b> voices. Based {{on the results of}} preliminary subjective experiments, listeners discriminate between singing <b>and</b> <b>speaking</b> voices with 70. 0 % accuracy for 200 ms signals and 99. 7 % for one-second signals. Since even short stimuli of 200 ms can be correctly discriminated, not only temporal characteristics but also short-time spectral features can be cues for discrimination. To examine how listeners distinguish between these two voices, we conducted subjective experiments with singing <b>and</b> <b>speaking</b> voice stimuli whose voice quality and prosody were systematically distorted by using signal processing techniques. The experimental results suggest that spectral and prosodic cues complementarily contributed to perceptual judgments. Furthermore, a software system that can automatically discriminate between singing <b>and</b> <b>speaking</b> voices <b>and</b> such performances is also reported...|$|R

The study also indicated that teachers taught English mixing with Bangla language; they had not been trained to assess listening <b>and</b> <b>speaking</b> skills; the English curriculum required restructuring to make way for listening <b>and</b> <b>speaking</b> skills assessment; teachers needed listening <b>and</b> <b>speaking</b> resources to enable them to undertake both listening <b>and</b> <b>speaking</b> practices <b>and</b> assessment; and above all, it shows that the teachers need instruction from the education authority in order to start auraloral skills assessment in schools.
