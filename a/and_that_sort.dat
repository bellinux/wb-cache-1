500|$|After Jacobs {{decided that}} Evans {{would no longer}} play Pam, he began searching for another actress to play the character. The role was {{eventually}} won by then 28-year-old actress, Victoria Principal. Principal won the role over another finalist, Judith Chapman, who was known famously for her work in daytime television. Shortly after Principal's role on Fantasy Island, a friend pointed her {{in the direction of}} Dallas and [...] "a part in it that was written for you". [...] Eventually, Principal received a copy of the script [...] "and read it and thought [...] was absolutely right". Acting as her own agent, she set up a meeting with the producers of Dallas. Lee Rich, an executive producer in 1979, recounted: [...] "We had all heard rumors about Victoria. This is a small town. Victoria's background, her so-called past, was a plus. We felt that she had experienced life and could understand the part." [...] Jacobs later said, [...] "Victoria, of all the actors, went for the role the most aggressively. <b>And</b> <b>that</b> <b>sort</b> of determination just became part of the character." [...] Prior to being cast in Dallas, Principal had starred in a few small roles in movies and television specials. These works include Earthquake in 1974, and Fantasy Island in 1977.|$|E

2500|$|Kelley {{said that}} his {{greatest}} thrill at Star Trek conventions {{was the number of}} people who told him they entered the medical profession because of the McCoy character. He received two or three letters a month from others reporting similar experiences. A friend observed that despite not becoming a doctor as he had hoped, Kelley's portrayal of McCoy had helped create many doctors. According to Kelley, [...] "You can win awards <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>sort</b> of thing, but to influence the youth of the country ... is an award that is not handed out by the industry".|$|E

2500|$|In {{addition}} to Josephine's concealing Wyatt's past relationship with Blaylock, modern researchers think she {{may also have}} been trying to conceal her own past as a [...] "sporting lady" [...] or prostitute. While prostitutes were ostracized by [...] "respectable" [...] women, many madams and prostitutes had more control of their lives and greater independence than other women. Josephine always sought excitement in her life. In the book I Married Wyatt Earp (1967), based on a manuscript which she purportedly wrote, author Glenn Boyer quotes her as saying, [...] "I liked the traveling sort of man... better than the kind that sat back in one town all his life and wrote down little rows of figures all day or hustled dry goods or groceries <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>sort</b> of thing... My blood demanded excitement, variety and change." [...] The type of work available to most women in that era was as laundresses, seamstresses, or other dull work which Josephine avoided.|$|E
