50|$|According to a charter, Nicholas {{wounded in}} the clashes against Venice at Zadar. Few days after the failure in July, Louis {{dismissed}} him as Ban of Slavonia and Croatia and replaced with Nicholas Szécsi, {{one of the most}} influential barons in the second half of the 14th century. That fact could confirm the information of the Minorite friar in connection with the bribery. While historians Gyula Kristó, Pál Engel and Antal Pór accepted the friar's theory, B. Halász argued, Nicholas did not lost his political influence, as appeared as <b>ad</b> <b>litem</b> <b>judge</b> in several times at Buda throughout 1347, and also received land donations from Louis during that time. For Louis, the Kingdom of Naples became a more important scene than Dalmatia and Zadar, where Nicholas Hahót, who had decades of military experience, could have provided a much greater service to the king, B. Halász emphasized.|$|E
