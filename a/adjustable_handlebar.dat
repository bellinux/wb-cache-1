Also {{available with}} powered trailer version. The safety mechanism, invented, designed and finally adopted by Cugini Randi, {{first on the}} 6000 Junior and then adopted across the range, allowed the model to be {{the winner of the}} 1st Prize at the 6th competition antinfortunistico ENPI (Ente Nazionale Prevenzione Infortuni) [...] for machines to be used on sloping ground. The mechanism allowed to engage the reverse gear, but the motocultivator was enabled to retreat only if the cutter was disengaged.

This bike also introduced <b>adjustable</b> steel-tube <b>handlebars,</b> rather than the fixed, pressed-steel covered, Super Cub style bars of previous bikes.

5000|$|Compared to the VF1000F, the VF1000R had {{completely}} different bodywork and rider positioning. The [...] "R" [...] model got fully faired, racer replica bodywork with rearset footpegs and <b>adjustable</b> clip-on <b>handlebars.</b> The <b>handlebars</b> were <b>adjustable</b> through {{a range of}} 4 degrees in 2 degree increments via a double serrated ring which meshed with the handle and the mounting ring parts of the clip on. Even with the adjustment available in the clip ons, period tests still criticized the bike for having too committed of a riding position, with a long stretch over the tank.|$|R

5000|$|The Cavalcade {{features}} a 16 valve DOHC 1360 cc V4 with hydraulic lash adjusters and shaft drive for low maintenance. Many {{of the standard}} features on the Cavalcade were considered options on other motorcycles in 1985. The LX and LXE models feature self-cancelling turn signals, automatic rear pneumatic leveling system, rear suspension load pre-tensioner, air-adjustable damping on the front shocks that could be refilled with a standard tire pump connection, electronic cruise control, radio and cassette deck with LCD station display, volume and station selection controls on the handlebars, adjustment knob for the headlight, adjustable passenger floorboards, fore to aft top case adjustment for passenger comfort, <b>adjustable</b> <b>handlebars</b> and <b>adjustable</b> windshield. The radio is in a decorative housing that resembles a standard motorcycle fuel tank. The radio has an automatic volume control that raises and lowers the radio volume based on {{the speed of the}} motorcycle. The Cavalcade fuel tank is located under the driver's seat but is filled {{from the top of the}} decorative tank. A standard automobile-type oil filter is located midline of the underside of the chassis between the exhaust pipes. The engine is liquid cooled with a thermostatically-controlled electric fan. The radio antenna could be unscrewed and lowered so as not to interfere with the positioning of the weather cover, which was standard with all models.|$|R
5000|$|In 1983 Honda {{released}} the CB1100F, {{based on the}} CB900F and the CB1100R. Besides a distinctive-to-the-1100f paint scheme, it used hotter cams, larger pistons, better carburetion {{in the form of}} four Keihin 34 mm CV, and a redesigned combustion chamber. The CB1100F produced 108 bhp @ 8500 rpm. It also had increased rake and the dash featured a 150 mph or 240 km/h speedometer and <b>adjustable</b> two-piece <b>handlebars.</b> The tubeless-tire wheels were new also, 18-inch x 2.50-inch front and 17-inch x 3-inch rear. [...] Performance was pace setting. Cycle World tests at 11.13 seconds/120.48 mph quarter mile and 141 mph half mile earned it the designation of [...] "fastest stock bike ever tested".|$|R
