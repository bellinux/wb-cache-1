2500|$|On August 25, 1927, when captain Charles E. Rosendahl {{was on the}} ground, Settle {{happened}} be {{the senior}} officer on board Los Angeles when the airship, tied to a mooring mast, literally [...] "stood on its nose". At 13:29 a sudden cold weather front hit Los Angeles; the resulting increase in the buoyancy of the airship, warmed by sunlight, pushed it upward. The tail freely went up while the nose remained tied to the tower. Settle requested Rosendahl's permission to disengage from the tower, but the captain [...] "saw no need for it". Winds threw the tail further upward; Settle sent the men into the tail, but Los Angeles kept rising until reaching a nearly vertical (88 degrees) nose-down position. The airship slowly rotated back; Settle called his men back and released <b>aft</b> <b>balance,</b> saving Los Angeles from a tail-first impact. Los Angeles survived the accident and served until 1932, performing 331 flights without major accidents or fatalities.|$|E
2500|$|Non-foot-launchable single place {{ultralight}} {{powered by}} a [...] 215 cc single cylinder Cuyuna 215 engine. Conventional three-axis control system utilizing spoilers for roll-control. Seat is adjustable fore and <b>aft</b> for <b>balance.</b> Due to company concerns about rigging requirements it was only supplied as a completed aircraft.|$|R
50|$|The stepped hull {{design was}} {{similar to that of the}} {{previous}} Miss England. On Miss England II, the step was separate from the hull, so that with the boat withdrawn from the water it could be unbolted and moved fore or <b>aft</b> to <b>balance</b> the boat for speed.|$|R
25|$|The Kitchen gear {{is opened}} up to direct an {{increasing}} proportion of thrust <b>aft.</b> As the <b>balance</b> changes the vessel will move ahead.|$|R
50|$|Ballonets may {{typically}} {{be used in}} non-rigid or semi-rigid airships, commonly {{with multiple}} ballonets located both fore and <b>aft</b> to maintain <b>balance</b> and to control the pitch of the airship.|$|R
60|$|The girl's words {{temporarily}} quieted the men, {{and finally}} {{it was decided}} that the two kegs of water and the four tins of food should be divided into two parts, one-half going forward to the three sailors to do with as they saw best, and the <b>balance</b> <b>aft</b> to the three passengers.|$|R
5000|$|A four-cylinder {{locomotive}} can {{be completely}} balanced in the longitudinal and vertical axes, {{although there are}} some rocking and twisting motions which can be dealt with in the locomotive's suspension and centring; a three-cylinder locomotive can also be better balanced, but a two-cylinder locomotive only balanced for rotation will surge fore and <b>aft.</b> Additional <b>balance</b> weight — [...] "overbalance" [...] — can be added to counteract this, but at the cost of adding vertical forces, hammer blow. This can be extremely damaging to the track, and in extreme cases can actually cause the driving wheels to leave the track entirely.|$|R
2500|$|While {{the side}} rods (UK: {{coupling}} rods) of a locomotive can be completely balanced by weights on the driving wheels since their motion is completely rotational, the reciprocating {{motions of the}} pistons, piston rods, main rods and valve gear cannot be balanced in this way. A two-cylinder locomotive has its two cranks [...] "quartered" [...] — set at 90° apart — so that the four power strokes of the double-acting pistons are evenly distributed around the cycle {{and there are no}} points at which both cylinders are at top or bottom dead center simultaneously. A four-cylinder locomotive can be completely balanced in the longitudinal and vertical axes, although there are some rocking and twisting motions which can be dealt with in the locomotive's suspension and centering; a three-cylinder locomotive can also be better balanced, but a two-cylinder locomotive only balanced for rotation will surge fore and <b>aft.</b> Additional <b>balance</b> weight — [...] "overbalance" [...] — can be added to damp this, but at the cost of adding vertical forces, which are known technically as [...] "dynamic augment" [...] and colloquially as [...] "hammer blow". This can be extremely damaging to the track, and in extreme cases can actually cause the driving wheels to leave the track entirely. The heavier the reciprocating machinery, the greater these forces are, and the greater a problem this becomes.|$|R
40|$|Ground effects {{experiments}} and large/small-tunnel interference studies {{were carried out}} on a model with a 20 -inch (50. 8 cm) span wing. The wing, which includes a highly deflected knee-blown flap can be fitted with unflapped tips and slats. A low-mounted tailplane can be fitted to the <b>aft</b> fuselage. Three-component <b>balance</b> meaurements, made with a fixed ground equipped with a single boundary-layer blowing slot, were compared with datum, moving-ground results. Good comparisons were obtained up to model blowing momentum coefficients of approximately two, after which the particular floor blowing settings used proved insufficient to prevent floor separation {{in the vicinity of the}} model. Skin friction measurements, taken routinely along the floor centerline, proved invaluable during the analysis of results, and their use is recommended as input to determination of floor BLC setting. A careful investigation was made of pitching moments, including tail-on, close-to-ground cases, with favorable results. Drag proved the most sensitive to the change from a moving to the boundary-layer controlled ground...|$|R
500|$|Heading {{into the}} {{planning}} of the LS 430, division executives concluded that the previous LS redesign had been too restrained in its approach. The LS 430 development team, led by chief engineer Yasushi Tanaka, accordingly opted for a more thorough exterior, interior, and technological redevelopment. The development of the LS 430 took four years. Selected from 16 different concept designs, the resulting vehicle of December 1997—when the final design (by Akihiro Nagaya) was approved—saw the sedan's dimensions increase in terms of wheelbase and height. The exterior featured a larger grille with rounded edges, quarter windows on the rear doors, and rounded trapezoidal headlamps. The body was also more aerodynamic than previous LS sedans (C'd 0.26; 0.25 with air suspension), and {{was the product of}} wind tunnel testing at facilities used for Shinkansen bullet train development. A [...] wheelbase stretch resulted in more interior volume and allowed the engine to be positioned further <b>aft</b> for better <b>balance.</b> Trunk space was increased by one-third due to repositioning of the fuel tank.|$|R
40|$|Wind tunnel {{tests were}} {{conducted}} to examine {{various aspects of the}} drooped-leading edge airfoil which reduces the tendency for an airplane to enter a spin after stall occurs. Three baseline models were used for tests of two dimensional models: NACA 0015, 0014. 6, and 0014. 2. The 14. 6 % and 14. 2 % models were derived from NACA 0015 sections by increasing the chord and matching the profiles <b>aft</b> section. Force, <b>balance</b> data (lift, drag, pitching moment) were obtained for each model at a free-steam Reynold's number of 2. 66 x 10 to the 6 th power/m. In addition, oil flow visualization tests were performed at various angles of attack. An existing NACA 64 sub 1 A 211 airfoil was used in a second series of tests. The leading edge flap was segmented in three parts which allowed various baseline/drooped leading edge configurations to be tested. Force balance and flow visualization tests were completer at chord Renolds numbers of 0. 44 x 10 to the 6 th power, 1. 4 x 10 to the 6 th power, and 2. 11 x 10 to the 6 th power. Test results are included...|$|R
40|$|Calibration data of a {{wind tunnel}} sting balance was {{processed}} using a search algorithm that identifies an optimized regression {{model for the}} data analysis. The selected sting balance had two moment gages that were mounted forward and <b>aft</b> of the <b>balance</b> moment center. The difference and {{the sum of the}} two gage outputs were fitted in the least squares sense using the normal force and the pitching moment at the balance moment center as independent variables. The regression model search algorithm predicted that the difference of the gage outputs should be modeled using the intercept and the normal force. The sum of the two gage outputs, on the other hand, should be modeled using the intercept, the pitching moment, and the square of the pitching moment. Equations of the deflection of a cantilever beam are used to show that the search algorithm s two recommended math models can also be obtained after performing a rigorous theoretical analysis of the deflection of the sting balance under load. The analysis of the sting balance calibration data set is a rare example of a situation when regression models of balance calibration data can directly be derived from first principles of physics and engineering. In addition, it is interesting to see that the search algorithm recommended the same regression models for the data analysis using only a set of statistical quality metrics...|$|R
60|$|The final task remained--the {{launching}} of the boat. This, of necessity, was the severest of all, {{for he had}} been compelled to load his comrade in <b>aft</b> of the <b>balance.</b> It meant a supreme effort at lifting. Daylight steeled himself and began. Something must have snapped, for, though {{he was unaware of}} it, the next he knew he was lying doubled on his stomach across the sharp stern of the boat. Evidently, {{and for the first time}} in his life, he had fainted. Furthermore, it seemed to him that he was finished, that he had not one more movement left in him, and that, strangest of all, he did not care. Visions came to him, clear-cut and real, and concepts sharp as steel cutting-edges. He, who all his days had looked on naked Life, had never seen so much of Life's nakedness before. For the first time he experienced a doubt of his own glorious personality. For the moment Life faltered and forgot to lie. After all, he was a little earth-maggot, just like all the other earth-maggots, like the squirrel he had eaten, like the other men he had seen fail and die, like Joe Hines and Henry Finn, who had already failed and were surely dead, like Elijah lying there uncaring, with his skinned face, in the bottom of the boat. Daylight's position was such that from where he lay he could look up river to the bend, around which, sooner or later, the next ice-run would come. And as he looked he seemed to see back through the past to a time when neither white man nor Indian was in the land, and ever he saw the same Stewart River, winter upon winter, breasted with ice, and spring upon spring bursting that ice asunder and running free. And he saw also into an illimitable future, when the last generations of men were gone from off the face of Alaska, when he, too, would be gone, and he saw, ever remaining, that river, freezing and fresheting, and running on and on.|$|R
