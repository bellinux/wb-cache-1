The documentary won a Gold award for Best Documentary at the 2012 Sony Radio Academy Awards.|$|E
5|$|Lex Luger was {{accompanied}} {{to the ring}} by four women with revealing outfits <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>prepared</b> to face Mr. Perfect. The match began with technical wrestling, and Perfect tried to injure Luger's knee while Luger worked on Perfect's back. Perfect {{took control of the}} match with a powerslam and tried to pin Luger after performing a dropkick from the top rope. Luger's foot was on the ropes, however, so the referee halted the three-count and continued the match. Luger gained momentum and pinned Perfect; Perfect's feet were on the rope, but the referee did not see them. Luger continued to attack Perfect after the match and hit him with his forearm, which contains a steel plate {{as the result of a}} legitimate motorcycle accident. When Perfect got up, he chased Luger but was attacked by Shawn Michaels backstage.|$|E
5|$|The gallery on {{the second}} floor of the library {{building}} was not formally dedicated until July 4, 1918. That date marked the beginning of the library's permanent collection, which started with additions from members of the Eagle's Nest Colony. Members donated twelve statues, twenty oil paintings, and four portraits to the permanent collection of the art gallery. One of the statues in the collection is a 4-foot (1.2-m) plaster study of The Eternal Indian by Lorado Taft. It was completed in 1908 <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>prepared</b> to create the Black Hawk Statue at the original site of the Eagle's Nest Colony. The entire permanent collection consists of 32 paintings and 32 sculptures from Eagle's Nest artists. A citizen left the library a Currier and Ives lithograph collection which contains 46 Currier and Ives lithographs and 14 lithographs by Nathaniel Currier. The two collections have been appraised at over $700,000.|$|E

5|$|The Abdullah {{case that}} had brought him to South Africa {{concluded}} in May 1894, and the Indian community organised a farewell party for Gandhi <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>prepared</b> to return to India. However, a new Natal government discriminatory proposal led to Gandhi extending his original period of stay in South Africa. He planned to assist Indians in opposing a bill to deny {{them the right to}} vote, a right then proposed to be an exclusive European right. He asked Joseph Chamberlain, the British Colonial Secretary, to reconsider his position on this bill. Though unable to halt the bill's passage, his campaign was successful in drawing attention to the grievances of Indians in South Africa. He helped found the Natal Indian Congress in 1894, and through this organisation, he moulded the Indian community of South Africa into a unified political force. In January 1897, when Gandhi landed in Durban, a mob of white settlers attacked him and he escaped only through the efforts of the wife of the police superintendent. However, he refused to press charges against any member of the mob.|$|E

He was awarded his wings and commission posthumously.|$|E
25|$|Soon after Pickett and Fitzhugh Lee {{left for}} lunch, Colonel Munford saw the Union attack shaping up <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>prepared</b> {{to have his}} cavalry {{division}} defend the left flank against the attack.

Each Confederate unit commander prepared for the attack as best he could, not always in co-operation with each other.|$|E

Henry made some attempts to combine with the Mongols, and in the autumn of 1299 sent a small fleet of two galleys, led by Guy of Ibelin and John of Giblet, to join Ghazan. The fleet successfully reoccupied Botrun on the mainland (in modern times this would be along the coast of Lebanon), and for a few months, until February 1300, began rebuilding the fortress of Nephin.|$|E
25|$|Frieze A {{originally}} depicted Domitian <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>prepared</b> {{to depart}} {{for a campaign}} against the Chatti. Contemporary authors such as Suetonius later alleged that Domitian's military endeavours were largely a failure, motivated by a quest for personal glory rather than necessity. The scene depicted on Frieze A seems to counter such accusations by presenting Domitian as a reluctant general, spurred on by the Gods Mars, Minerva and Roma, who are pictured on the far left, to defend his home country. Other characters who appear in this scene are the Genii, or guardian spirits, of the Roman Senate {{and the people of}} Rome, and a number of soldiers.|$|E
25|$|The Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN), {{like the}} Russians, often {{combined}} their TBs (which possessed only hull numbers) with their torpedo boat destroyers (TBDs) (often simply referring {{to them as}} destroyers) and launched over 270 torpedoes (counting the opening engagement at Port Arthur on 8 February 1904) during the war. The IJN deployed approximately 21 TBs during the conflict, and on 27 May 1905 the Japanese torpedo boat destroyers and TBs launched 16 torpedoes at the battleship , Admiral Rozhestvensky's flagship {{at the battle of}} Tsushima. Admiral Tōgō Heihachirō, the IJN commander, had ordered his torpedo boats to finish off the enemy flagship, already gunned into a wreck, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>prepared</b> to pursue the remnants of the Russian battle fleet.|$|E

On the way to Kufa, he received the report of Muslim ibn Aqeel's death at the hands of Yazid's men and that the Kufans had changed their loyalties to Yazid, pledging support to him against Husayn and his followers.|$|E
25|$|Hart {{played in}} all the {{qualifying}} matches for the 2009 European Championships, In the finals, he started the first two group-stage matches and was rested for the last match as England had already sealed their passage to the knock-out stage. In the semi-final against Sweden, he conceded three goals {{in the second half}} as the match ended 3–3 after extra time, but made up for it by saving a penalty and scoring another as England won 5–4 in the shoot-out. However, he was yellow-carded for leaving his line to talk to Mikael Lustig <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>prepared</b> to take his penalty. England's appeal was rejected, so Hart was suspended for the final; Scott Loach kept goal as England lost 4–0 to Germany.|$|E
