5|$|In 1841, {{following}} {{suggestions from}} the local paving board, Barry agreed that two fountains should be installed to counteract the effects of reflected heat and glare from the <b>asphalt</b> <b>surface.</b> The First Commissioner of Woods and Forests welcomed the plan because the fountains reduced the open space available for public gatherings and reduced the risk of riotous assembly. The fountains were fed from two wells, one {{in front of the}} National Gallery and one behind it connected by a tunnel.

40|$|Many airport {{surfaces}} in Australia are constructed of dense graded <b>asphalt.</b> These <b>surfaces</b> are generally replaced by asphalt overlay every 10 - 15 years. Airport <b>asphalt</b> <b>surfaces</b> are highly suited to sprayed surface preservation treatments. There are {{a range of}} treatments to preserve and {{extend the life of}} <b>asphalt</b> <b>surfaces.</b> These generally replace lost binder and/or fine mineral material. These treatments generally create a temporary protective coating over the existing surface. A number of new materials have largely replaced the traditional coal-tar based and cutback bitumen products. These new materials are emulsion based and often include polymers. This paper presents a summary of experience and new materials for treatment of <b>asphalt</b> <b>surfaces</b> at Australian airports.

40|$|Reliable {{and durable}} <b>asphalt</b> <b>surfacing</b> systems still {{remain to be}} desired for the long-spanned {{orthotropic}} steel bridges as the nationally and internationally reports on distresses in deck pavement.

It is concluded that the behaviours of deck pavement on oithotropic steel bridge deck under truck load are complex contributed by geometric and material-dependent nonlinearity, coupling the global dynamic effects of the whole bridge systems. More efficient computational techniques are still desirable to couple global effects into local responses, to count the interfacial effects and interaction, and to evaluate the effect of predominant distress of fatigue cracking and de-bonding on the service life {{of this type of}} structure.

40|$|Abstract: Due to {{widespread}} use of disposable dishes and their 500 - 600 years recycling and also carcinogenicity, {{the goal of this}} laboratory study is to investigate the possibility of using polystyrene (PS) disposable dishes wastes in making <b>asphalt</b> <b>surfaces</b> to decrease environmental problems in recycling and burial of these materials and also to analyze their effect on technical characteristics of asphalt mixtures. In addition, PS materials are used in four methods: 1 -added to bitumen, 2 -bitumen replaced with PS, 3 -added to aggregates, 4 - same-sized soft aggregates replaced with PS. In each of aforementioned instances, bitumen or asphalt mixture technical characteristics change much or a little. PS can resolve major problems of water percolation and drainage in <b>asphalt</b> <b>surfaces</b> and the obtained asphalt mixture has more strength and resistance to control sample. Consequently, while using the obtained mixture improves asphalt mixtures properties and reduces the consumption of aggregates, it exploits large amounts of PS wastes in civil engineering constructions.
