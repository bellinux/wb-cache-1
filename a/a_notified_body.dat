2500|$|<b>A</b> <b>notified</b> <b>body,</b> in the European Union, is {{an entity}} {{that has been}} {{accredited}} by a Member State to assess whether a product {{to be placed on}} the market meets certain preordained standards. Conformity assessment can include inspection and examination of a product, its design, and the manufacturing environment and processes associated with it. [...] For example, <b>a</b> <b>notified</b> <b>body</b> may designate that a medical device conforms to the E.U. Medical Devices Directive, which defines the standards for medical devices. With this Declaration of Conformity, the manufacturer can label the product with the CE Mark, which is required for distribution and sale in the E.U. Additionally, the E.U. member state accrediting the notified body will then inform the European Commission that the product complies with set standards (or not).|$|E
2500|$|The revelation had {{a ripple}} effect, causing both more {{criticism}} about {{the responsibilities of}} notified bodies and the regulatory process in general and more corrective action. The Central Management Committee was created in September 2010 [...] "to develop {{the effectiveness of the}} regulatory system on medical devices in the E.U. by improving decision making among the national regulatory authorities." [...] Then in February 2012, European Health and Consumer Policy Commissioner John Dalli called upon E.U. member states {{to take a hard look}} at the regulatory system, including how notified bodies play a part. His recommendations included properly verifying whether <b>a</b> <b>notified</b> <b>body</b> is capable of accurately assessing medical devices, improving how conformity assessments are conducted, and developing tools to enhance medical device traceability. The European Commission acted, that September revealing its proposed changes to medical device regulation, including expanded requirements on notified bodies, to be published in 2014 and go into effect in 2017. However, the Commission also opted to instate additional reforms — separate from its draft regulations — that would go into effect much sooner, asking notified bodies to perform unannounced visits to manufacturers and expand their device testing standards. At the same time the NB-MED (European Forum of Notified Bodies Medical Devices) coordination revised their Code of Conduct due to criticism.|$|E

40|$|International audienceOn May 23, 2007 the European Parliament and the Council {{adopted the}} Directive 2007 / 23 /EC [1] on the placing {{on the market}} of {{pyrotechnic}} articles. Following the "new approach" this Directive aims at ensuring the f ree movement of such products within the European Union (EU), improving safety of both consumers and professionals and implementing harmonized safety requirements for these articles in all Member States. Therefore a European frame for the approval of pyrotechnic articles for vehicles is now set up by introducing harmonized Essential Safety Requirements (ESR), CE marking and certification procedures. For manufacturers and importers that had to comply with a different regulation in each country to get technical approvals of their products the principle "tested once, accepted everywhere" is a great achievement. Although this EU directive will reduce the administrative burden for everybody, its substitution and application instead of the current national regulations may create difficulties at the beginning. <b>As</b> <b>Notified</b> <b>Body</b> and Official Laboratory in France INERIS has gained lot of experience in testing, certifying and approving explosives and pyrotechnic articles.

40|$|International audienceFor {{manufacturers}} and importers that generally have {{to comply with}} a different regulation in each country to get technical approvals for their products the principle "tested once, accepted everywhere" is a great expectancy. The Directive 2007 / 23 /EC [1] concerning the placing on the market and the use of pyrotechnic articles could fulfil those dealing with automotive occupant restraint systems (mainly airbags and seat belts pretensioners). By introducing harmonised Essential Safety Requirements (ESR) this new Directive offers the possibilities to replace the National approval procedures concerned by a single legal framework throughout the European Union (EU) for these pyrotechnic articles. Although this EU directive will reduce the administrative burden for everybody by introducing the CE marking and certification procedure, its substitution and application in replacement of the current National regulatory frameworks may create difficulties at the beginning. In this paper we present the different parts of the Directive specifically these concerning pyrotechnic devices for automotive safety and how to comply with it. <b>As</b> <b>Notified</b> <b>Body</b> and Official Laboratory in France INERIS has gained lot of experience in testing, certifying and approving explosives and pyrotechnic devices.

50|$|Manufacturers/suppliers (or importers, if the {{manufacturers}} {{are outside the}} EU) must ensure that their products meet essential health and safety requirements and undergo appropriate conformity procedures. This usually involves testing and certification by a ‘third-party’ certification body (known as <b>a</b> <b>Notified</b> <b>Body</b> e.g. Intertek, Sira, Baseefa, Lloyd's, TUV ICQC) but manufacturers/suppliers can ‘self-certify’ Category 3 equipment (technical dossier including drawings, hazard analysis and users manual in the local language) and Category 2 non-electrical equipment but for Category 2 the technical dossier must be lodged with <b>a</b> <b>notified</b> <b>body.</b> Once certified, the equipment is marked by the ‘CE’ (meaning it complies with ATEX and all other relevant directives) and ‘Ex’ symbol to identify it as approved under the ATEX directive.
