40|$|Iran is a wast {{country with}} many {{different}} tree species. Among those {{there are two}} species of Morus genus including alba and nigra. Since long time ago, white mulberry�s wood (Morus alba) {{has been used for}} making musical instruments especially bowl shaped instruments in Iran [...] In contrast, black mulberry�s wood (Morus nigra) has never been used for these types of applications. In order to investigate the possible replacement choices, this study has been carried out to investigate the anatomical differences and similarities between these two species. Wood samples of the two species have been collected from same site and microsections for light microscopic studies and maceration samples have been prepared. The anatomical characteristics were studied according to the IAWA List of Hardwoods. The most important similarities between them are: vessel solitary in short radial multiples or irregular clusters, fiber nonseptate, rays uniseriate and multiseriate type, paratracheal parenchyma, varying from vasicentric to aliform confluent, apotracheal as marginal bands, Rhombic crystals present in rays and sometimes in parenchyma. The main differences are: semi-ring porous distribution of vessels in M. alba, fewer number of vessels and presence of <b>aliform</b> <b>parenchyma</b> in M. nigra. Taking these results into consideration, the most important features of both species are similar and it could be recommended to use the nigra species as well as the alba for making musical instruments...|$|E
40|$|The wood {{anatomy of}} the palaeotropical Melastomataceae is {{described}} in detail {{on the basis of}} 134 samples of 107 species from 36 genera. On the wood anatomy, three subfamilies are recognized, Memecyloideae, Melastomatoideae, and Crypteronioideae. The Memecyloideae stand out through their fibre-tracheids, the deviating fibre length/vessel member length ratio, and the scanty paratracheal to <b>aliform</b> <b>parenchyma.</b> The Melastomatoideae are characterised by libriform fibres showing fibre dimorphism and rays composed of erect, square, and weakly procumbent cells (also in Memecyloideae p. p.). The subfamily Astronioideae is abolished; Pternandra is transferred to Memecyloideae, the Astronieae fit perfectly in the Melastomatoideae. Within Melastomatoideae the tribes are not easy to separate. The subtribe Dissochaetineae (all climbers) of the Dissochaeteae stands out because of its multiseriate rays, subtribe Medinillineae has scalariform inter-vessel pits; Astronieae have longest vessel members of the palaeotropical Melastomataceae, uniseriate rays, and bands of deviating fibres in which axial parenchyma is scarcely present: in the Osbeckieae apotracheal parenchyma bands (probably originated through fibre dimorphism) characterise the wood of Dichaetanthera; it is proposed to combine Oxysporeae and Sonerileae to one tribe Sonerileae; {{on the basis of the}} inter-vessel pitting two subtribes are recognized, different in delimitation from the two original tribes. The family Crypteroniaceae s. s. (Axinandra, Crypteronia and Dactylocladus) is incorporated in Melastomataceae as a separate subfamily. The scalariform inter-vessel pits, present in palaeotropical Melastomataceae only, must be interpreted as a specialization from the alternate pattern. Raphides are present in one species of Bredia, B. tuberculata. Clustered crystals are observed in the axial parenchyma and rays of Dichaetanthera. Large elongate crystals are present in the parenchyma of the strands of axially included phloem of the Memecyloideae. Variation in quantitative characters (vessel member length, vessel diameter and frequency) can partly be explained from the ecological preference of the species concerned. Wood anatomical differences between lianas and erect relatives are discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{circumscription}} of Bignoniaceae genera and tribes {{has undergone}} major changes following an increased understanding of phylogenetic relationships within the family. While DNA sequence data have repeatedly reconstructed major clades within the family, {{some of the}} clades recovered still lack diagnostic morpho-anatomical features, complicating their recognition. In this study we investigated the wood anatomy of all major lineages of Bignoniaceae (except Tourrettieae) in search for anatomical synapomorphies for clades. We sampled 158 species of Bignoniaceae, representing 67 out of the 82 genera currently recognized. Detailed descriptions of quantitative and qualitative wood anatomical features are presented for each clade and interpreted {{in the light of}} a molecular phylogeny for the family. Jacarandae are characterized by a paratracheal winged-aliform parenchyma, with the traditional subdivision of Jacaranda into sections Monolobos and Dilobos supported by the uniseriate and homocellular rays of Monolobos versus the wide and heterocellular rays of Dilobos. Tecomeae s. s. are characterized by scanty paratracheal parenchyma, septate fibers, and heterocellular rays, traits also found in Delostoma, a genus previously included in Tecomeae s. l., but recently shown to represent a separate lineage. Crescentiina includes two sub-clades, the Tabebuia alliance and the Paleotropical clade, which share abundant <b>aliform</b> <b>parenchyma,</b> short and mainly homocellular rays, less commonly with heterocellular rays with body procumbent and one row of marginal square cells. Members of the Tabebuia alliance and the Paleotropical clade can be distinguished from each other by the narrow vessels with a widespread storied structure found in members of the Tabebuia alliance, versus the vessels with medium to wide width and a non-storied structure found in members of the Paleotropical clade. Oroxyleae are characterized by a combination of simple and foraminate perforation plates and homocellular rays, while Catalpeae are characterized by scanty paratracheal parenchyma, abundant tyloses and vessel-ray pits simple to semi-bordered. Bignonieae differ from all other clades by a variant secondary growth and a typically lianoid wood anatomy. Overall, wood anatomical characters are not very labile within the family, being distributed across clades in a very predictive manner. Several anatomical characters represent good anatomical synapomorphies and provide further support to clades identified in molecular phylogenetic studies...|$|E
50|$|The wood is dense (0.85 - 1.1 g/cm3)? {{and texture}} is {{moderately}} fine to fine and even. Also attractive to users is {{the resistance to}} insects, bacteria, fungi and marine borers. The wood has anti-bacterial properties (for local medicinal use)Vessels are diffuse-porous, medium-sized and generally evenly distributed, arranged in short radial rows (2-3 vessels).

40|$|The {{structure}} of the wood of the genera Castilla, Helicostylis, Maquira, Naucleopsis, Olmedia, Perebea and Pseudolmedia, considered to belong in the Olmedieae (cf. Berg 1972) is described. The diversity in anatomical structure between the genera is small, {{and it is hard}} to distinguish Maquira, Perebea and Pseudolmedia from each other. Castilla can be recognized by its thinwalled and wide-lumined fibres, Helicostylis by its parenchyma distribution, Naucleopsis (usually) by its more numerous vessels with a smaller diameter. A more marked difference is shown by the monotypic genus Olmedia with apotracheal banded parenchyma instead of the paratracheal <b>aliform</b> to confluent-banded <b>parenchyma</b> of the other genera. Septate fibres, which are characteristic for the other genera – some species of Helicostylis excepted – are nearly completely absent in Olmedia. This structural difference is considered as an argument in favour of the exclusion of Olmedia from the tribe Olmedieae (Berg 1977) ...|$|R
40|$|Gross and {{anatomical}} {{features of}} Aromadendron elegans and seven lesser known wood species were observed and described for identification purposes and {{for evaluation of}} their suitable uses. Fiber dimension were also measured to evaluate their possible uses for pulp and paper. Several important features for identification were detected: 1) oil cells and closely spaced parenchyma bands in Aromadendron elegans; 2) wood semi-ring porous in Melia dubia; 3) radial intercellular canal and septate fibers in Lannea coromandelica; 4) ray storied and druses crystals in Hibiscus tiliaceus; 5) ray very high and contain sheath cells in Baccaurea sp.; 6) ray homocellular uniseriate and included phloem in Dolichandrone spathacea; 7) <b>parenchyma</b> <b>aliform</b> and confluent, prismatic crystals in chambered axial parenchyma of Acrocarpus fraxinifolius; 8) wood white, fibers with distinctly bordered pit, and prismatic crystals in chambered axial parenchyma of Flindersia australis. All wood species studied have density and considerable strength {{to be used for}} construction purposes. Aromadendron elegans, Melia dubia, and Flindersia australis have decorative appearance so they are suitable for furniture. Flindersia australis is white and has moderately fine texture so it could be usedfor "ram in" substitute. Fibers quality of all species studied belongs to quality class II. The total of fibers dimension derived values, of Aromadendron elegans, Melia dubia, Flindersia australis and Dolichandrone spathacea are the highest among eight wood species studied; further studies on pulping characteristics are therefore recommended for these wood species...|$|R

40|$|Anatomical {{characteristics}} of five "gaharu " wood species, Aquilaria malaccensis. Aetoxyl­ sympetalum. Gonystylus bancanus, Gonystylus macrophyllus, and Gyrinops versteeghii were described and compared, {{to find out}} how to identify and differentiate gaharu wood by their taxa. The knowledge of the difference between Aquilaria malaccensis, which has been listed in Appendix II CITES. from other gaharu wood that have not been listed, would be advantages in supporting the conservation of A. malaccensis as well as in promoting the utilization of the other gaharu wood species. The result of study indicated that all gaharu wood examined have several same features: 1) fibers with distinctly bordered pit at radial face and tend to be arranged in two series: 2) intervessel pit small,. 4 - 7 microns: 3) rays of commonly uniseriate. Both Aquilaria malaccensis and Gyrinops versteeghii have included phloem, while the other three gaharu wood species do not contain included phloem. Aquilaria malaccensis that has been listed in Appendix II CITES could be differentiated from Gyrinops versteeghii based on vessel characteristics. aquilaria malaccensis has medium vessel diameter, 100 - 200 microns, frequency less than 10 vessels per sq. mm. and radial multiples of 2 - 4 cells. Gyrinops versteeghii has moderately small vessel diameter, less than 100 microns, frequency more than 10 vessels per sq. mm, and radial multiples of 2 - 6 cells. Aetoxylon sympetalum and Gonystylus spp. are together characterized by the presence of <b>aliform</b> and confluent <b>parenchyma</b> and the occurrence of prismatic and styloid crystals in ray tissue. The presence of very thick walled fibers and rays of 1 - 2 to 3 seriate wide, could be used to differentiate Actoxylon sympetalum from Gonystylus spp. The latter have fibers of medium thickness and rays of commonly uniseriate...|$|R
