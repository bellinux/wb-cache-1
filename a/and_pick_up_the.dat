Comfort observed him doing so and got a search warrant for his home on that basis. He was arrested shortly thereafter, 26 months after the postal inspectors had first contacted him.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, Costello {{convinced}} Kent to {{once again}} don the bush hat <b>and</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> boomerang. Costello got Kent to team up with Bruno Bekkar, who was mostly known from working in his native New Zealand and Australia. Kent and Bekkar worked a tour for the WWC, while Costello served as their manager. The team won the WWC North American Tag Team titles from Jack and Jerry Brisco on 22 October 1981. They then lost the titles to Invader I and Super Gladiator but quickly gained them back before dropping the titles for good to Invader and Gladiator on 26 January 1982. The Kent and Bekkar team only lasted through one tour of the Caribbean, after which Bruno Bekkar returned to Australia and New Zealand {{to work for the}} local promotions there.|$|E
5|$|After Luis Enrique {{decided to}} resign {{due to an}} {{unsuccessful}} season in which Roma failed to qualify for European football {{for the first time}} in 15 years, the club decided to appoint their former manager Zdeněk Zeman, with whom Totti would once again be reunited. Zeman tried to play Totti in a free role as a left forward or winger in his preferred 4–3–3 tactical line-up. Although this was a similar role to that which he had played during Zeman's previous spell 13 years before, Totti's freedom also enabled him to drop deep into the midfield to press opponents <b>and</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> ball, as well as attacking on the left wing. On 2 September, Totti provided 2 assists for Alessandro Florenzi and Dani Osvaldo in Roma's 3–1 win over Inter at the San Siro. After the match, he received praise from the media due to his performance, even as he approached his 36th birthday. On 21 October, Totti surpassed both Giuseppe Meazza and José Altafini's joint-record after scoring the first of Roma's goals in a 4–2 away win at Genoa, becoming the third-highest scorer in Serie A history with 217 goals. On 8 December, Totti scored two goals, his fifth and sixth of the season, in a 4–2 home victory against Fiorentina.|$|E

25|$|As for her {{relationship}} with Lee, it’s clear that Hohoff provided more than just editorial guidance. One winter night, as Charles J. Shields recounts in Mockingbird: A Portrait of Harper Lee, Lee threw her manuscript out her window and into the snow, before calling Hohoff in tears. “Tay told her to march outside immediately <b>and</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> pages,” Mr. Shields writes.|$|E
25|$|Dumbo {{aircraft}} {{were sent}} aloft to patrol likely areas where American airmen might ditch. The Dumbo would radio {{the position of}} any survivors spotted in the water, and one or more actions could take place. The Dumbo, if a flying boat configuration, could land <b>and</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> survivors, or it could drop emergency supplies such as a lifeboat, by parachute. A nearby ship or submarine could be requested to come rescue the survivors, or an air-sea rescue station could be signaled to send a rescue boat.|$|E

25|$|Half an hour {{into the}} final day, Warne finally turned the tide back in favour of the Australians and {{effectively}} sealed the victory. Thorpe pushed forward to a fuller delivery and missed it, then Hick was caught {{off the back of}} his bat after the ball ricocheted off his arm. Gooch added 30 with Gatting and another 30 with wicketkeeper Steve Rhodes, but both managed to nick the new ball to Healy off McDermott's bowling. Warne cleaned up the tail to finish with match figures of 11–108 <b>and</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> man-of-the-match award, and the game was over before tea on the final day, England mustering 323.|$|E
25|$|Johnson’s poke check {{could also}} be used to force {{turnovers}} and generate offensive rushes. Combining good breakaway speed with positional awareness, Johnson would charge an oncoming attacker, use his poke check to strip the player of the puck, bank it off the sideboards and race after it. While on the attack himself, he would often deliberately make as if he were dumping the puck in. Instead, when thirty feet from the opposing net, he would deliberately fire the puck along the boards so that it rimmed around behind the opponent’s goalie; however, rather than chase after it, he would subsequently cut across the slot <b>and</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> puck as it came out the other side.|$|E

25|$|The HBC {{built a new}} {{much larger}} Fort Vancouver in 1824 {{slightly}} upstream of Fort Astoria {{on the north side}} of the Columbia River (they were hoping the Columbia would be the future Canada–U.S. border). The fort quickly became the center of activity in the Pacific Northwest. Every year ships would come from London to the Pacific (via Cape Horn) to drop off supplies and trade goods in their trading posts in the Pacific Northwest <b>and</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> accumulated furs used to pay for these supplies. It was the nexus for the fur trade on the Pacific Coast; its influence reached from the Rocky Mountains to the Hawaiian Islands, and from Russian Alaska into Mexican-controlled California. At its pinnacle in about 1840, Fort Vancouver and its Factor (manager) watched over 34 outposts, 24 ports, 6 ships, and about 600 employees.|$|E
25|$|The entire Maghrib, {{as well as}} Tunisia {{under the}} early Hafsids, enjoyed an era of {{prosperity}} due {{to the rise of}} Saharan-Sudanese as well as the Mediterranean trade, the latter including trade with Europe. Across the region, repeated buy and sell dealings with Christians {{led to the development of}} practices and structured arrangements at were crafted to ensure security, customs revenue, and commercial profit. The principal customs ports were then: Tunis, Sfax, Mahdia, Jerba, and Gabés (in modern Tunisia); Oran, Bougie (Bejaia), and Bône (Annaba) (in modern Algeria); and Tripoli (in modern Libya). Generally at such ports, the imports were off loaded and transferred to a customs area from where they were deposited in a sealed warehouse, or funduq, until the duties and fees were paid. The Tunis customs service was a stratified bureaucracy. At its head was often a member of the ruling nobility or musharif, called al-Caid, who not only managed the staff collecting duties but also might negotiate commercial agreements, conclude treaties, and would act as judge in legal disputes involving foreigners. The amount of the duties varied, usually five or ten percent. It was possible for an arriving ship to deliver its goods <b>and</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> return cargo in several days time. Christian merchants of the Mediterranean, usually organized by their city–of–origin, set up and maintained their own trading facilities in these North African customs ports to handle the flow of merchandise and marketing.|$|E
500|$|Dick Irvin once {{compared}} the styles of Syl Apps, previous {{captain of the}} Leafs, to Kennedy in how the two centres used their wingers. [...] "Apps used to hit the defense at top speed and Gordie Drillon would come along <b>and</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> garbage", said Irvin, whereas Kennedy would [...] "go into the corners and get the puck out to their wings." [...] Hap Day had said he could see Nels Stewart's influence on Kennedy. Like Stewart, Kennedy had a more upright lie on his hockey stick which kept the puck closer to his feet. Kennedy was also widely {{believed to be the}} best faceoff man in hockey and seldom lost an important faceoff. Along with his regular shift, he also played a role on the penalty kill.|$|E

500|$|Following his death, Watts' mother {{moved the}} family to Llanfawr Farm in Llangefni and Llanfairpwllgwyngyll, towns {{on the island of}} Anglesey in North Wales, where they lived with Watts' {{maternal}} grandparents, Nikki and Hugh Roberts, for three years. During this time, Watts attended a Welsh language school, Ysgol Gyfun Llangefni. She later said of her time in Wales: [...] "We took Welsh lessons in a school {{in the middle of nowhere}} while everyone else was taking English. Wherever we moved, I would adapt <b>and</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> regional accent. It's obviously significant now, me being an actress. Anyway, there was quite a lot of sadness in my childhood, but no lack of love." [...] In 1978, her mother remarried (though she would later be divorced again) and Watts and her brother then moved to Suffolk, where she attended Thomas Mills High School. Watts has stated that she wanted to become an actress after seeing her mother performing on stage and from the time she watched the 1980 film Fame.|$|E
500|$|The {{new owners}} of RKO made an initial effort {{to revive the}} studio, hiring veteran {{producer}} William Dozier to head production. A needed cash infusion was realized in 1954 when the 89 acre RKO Encino movie ranch was sold off {{to make way for}} a new tract home development. [...] During the first half of 1956, the production facilities were as busy as they had been in a half-decade. RKO Teleradio Pictures released Fritz Lang's final two American films, While the City Sleeps and Beyond a Reasonable Doubt (both 1956), but years of mismanagement had driven away many directors, producers, and stars. Other films included Bundle of Joy, a remake of the Ginger Rogers-starring Bachelor Mother which was re-tooled as a vehicle for star couple Eddie Fisher and Debbie Reynolds. Rogers herself would make a film for the new RKO (The First Traveling Saleslady) and would later comment that [...] "coming back to RKO was like coming back to a picnic you've been on last week, <b>and</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> bones all around and see what the ants have taken from the lunch that you left." [...] The studio was also saddled with the last of the inflated B movies such as Pearl of the South Pacific (1955) and The Conqueror (1956) that enchanted Hughes. The latter, starring John Wayne, was the biggest hit produced at the studio during the decade, but its $4.5 million in North American rentals did not come close to covering its $6 million cost.|$|E
500|$|While he was forming up his ships, Persano {{transferred}} from his flagship, [...] to the turret ship [...] This created {{a gap in}} the Italian line, and Tegetthoff seized the opportunity to divide the Italian fleet and create a melee. He made a pass through the gap, but failed to ram any of the Italian ships, forcing him to turn around and make another attempt. During the second attempt, Austrian gunfire had disabled Re d'Italias rudder, leaving her incapable of maneuvering. Tegetthoff seized the opportunity to ram the Italian vessel, and ordered his ship to maximum speed. After two collisions that occurred at angles too oblique to inflict serious damage, Erzherzog Ferdinand Max struck the ship more directly. The Austrian ship's ram tore a gaping hole in Re d'Italias hull on the port side, though Erzherzog Ferdinand Max sustained no significant damage herself. Tegetthoff reversed course, allowing the Italian ironclad to lurch back to port and quickly sink. Tegetthoff initially ordered his crew to lower boats to pick up the Italians struggling in the water, but the Italian ironclad [...] was approaching, and he could not allow his ship to become a stationary target. Instead, he ordered the aviso [...] to remain behind <b>and</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> survivors while Erzherzog Ferdinand Max engaged San Martino. The other Italian ships, however, did not realize Kaiserin Elizabeth was attempting to pick up the Italian survivors, and so opened fire on her, driving her away from the men in the water.|$|E
