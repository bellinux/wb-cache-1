40|$|Auctions and bidding play an {{important}} role in agricultural marketing. A common and noteworthy application of auctions and bidding is that of import tendering which is used for both price determination and the <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>purchases</b> among sellers. In this study we develop a model to evaluate bidding strategies and competition in Egyptian oilseeds imports. Information included the values of bids submitted by each supplier in each tender over the period 1990 to 1993. Results indicate that generally bids could be predicted for all bidders with a relatively high degree of confidence using simple relationships and accessible data. In addition, for each oil tender there appeared to be groups of bidders characterized by differences in their bid functions. The results are particularly interesting for understanding sellers' bidding strategies, competition among rivals, as well as impacts of specific variables on optimal bids and payoffs to sellers. Although this analysis is applied to a set of detailed data, the approach and implications have many applications in other bidding situations in agricultural marketing and contributes to understanding bidding strategies and competition.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{document}} and explain the <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> takeover <b>purchase</b> price to identifiable intangible assets (IIAs), purchased goodwill, and/or target net tangible assets in an accounting environment unconstrained with respect to IIA accounting policy choice. Using a sample of Australian acquisitions during the unconstrained accounting environment from 1988 to 2004, we find the percentage <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>purchase</b> price to IIAs averaged 19. 09 %. The percentage allocation to IIAs is significantly positively related to return on assets and insignificantly related to leverage, contrary to opportunism. Efficiency suggests an explanation: profitable firms acquire and capitalise a higher percentage of IIAs in acquisitions. The target's investment opportunity set is significantly positively related to the percentage allocation to IIAs, consistent with information-signalling. The paper contributes to the accounting policy choice literature by showing how Australian firms make the one-off accounting policy choice in regards <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> takeover <b>purchase</b> price (which is often a substantial dollar amount to) in an environment where accounting for IIAs was unconstrained. ...|$|R

40|$|The authors {{examine the}} price and <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>purchased</b> {{information}} and <b>of</b> the underlying asset in eight double-auction asset market experiments. Observed outcomes support fully revealing rational expectations in simple environments in which uninformed traders can easily infer the private information of informed traders but support nonrevealing rational expectations in more complex environments. The private value of information is positive in the more complex (noisy) environments but competition forces the information price to its Nash equilibrium value and the net gain by purchasers is approximately zero.

40|$|In recent years, {{numerous}} {{methods have}} been proposed to deal with supplier evaluation and selection problem, but a point which has been usually neglected by researchers is the role <b>of</b> <b>purchasing</b> items. The aim {{of this paper is}} to propose an integrated approach to select suppliers and allocate orders on the basis of the nature <b>of</b> the <b>purchasing</b> items which means that this issue plays an important role in supplier selection and order allocation. Therefore, items are first categorized according to the Kraljic’s model by the use of FMEA technique. Then, suppliers are categorized and evaluated in four phases with respect to different types <b>of</b> <b>purchasing</b> items (Strategic, Bottleneck, Leverage and Routine). Finally, an integer linear programming is utilized to allocate purchasing orders to suppliers. Furthermore, an empirical example is conducted to illustrate the stage of proposed approach.

40|$|Although it {{involves}} a considerable financial risk, being the first on the market provides companies with a competitive edge (Carpenter and Nakamoto, 1989, 1990). Two studies were conducted to investigate boundary conditions for the pioneering advantage and explore factors that influence consumers’ learning of brand associations about the first and late entrant. The two studies examined the impact of product complexity, product category knowledge, product type (i. e., hedonic and utilitarian) and consumers’ valuation of variety and quality on consumers’ <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> attention and <b>purchase</b> behavior for pioneers and late entrants. The results showed that product complexity influenced consumers’ <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> attention and <b>purchase</b> behavior. Consumers <b>of</b> complex products had a higher purchase intention for the second entrant on the market. Furthermore, for complex products consumers allocated more attention to alignable differences, whereas for simple products consumers allocated more attention to nonalignable differences. Product category knowledge had a main effect on consumers’ <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> attention, <b>purchase</b> intentions, preference and choice. An interaction between product type (i. e., hedonic and utilitarian) and product category knowledge was observed. Pioneering brands benefited the most when consumers perceived the product category as being high in variety and the least in product categories perceived as high in quality. Conclusions and managerial implications are presented as well as directions for future research. ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceSupply base {{consolidation}} is {{an important}} issue in many business markets. Against this background, the <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>purchasing</b> budgets across vendors becomes an area of vital interest to suppliers. In the present research, we argue that customer share is a key decision variable in business marketing settings and investigate how a supplier can proactively manage the share of its customer's business. We report the results of a cross-sectional study among purchasing managers in U. S. manufacturing industries. Our findings confirm the role of customer value as an antecedent to customer share in business relationships. The study further shows that customer share influences the stability of key supplier relationships. Rather than displaying a direct impact, our results suggest that trust mediates and dependence moderates the link between customer share and search for alternative suppliers. Based on these findings, we propose a framework for managing customer share in key supplier relationships. Four approaches of how industrial vendors can proactively manage customer share are discussed...|$|R

40|$|The recent {{movement}} in standards setting toward fair-value-based accounting beyond financial {{assets and liabilities}} calls for more empirical evidence on fair-value measurement, especially that of intangible assets. This article studies the initial valuation of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets after acquisitions. We find that the <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>purchase</b> price to goodwill and identifiable intangible assets {{is related to the}} economic determinants of the valuation. However, it is also significantly affected by managerial incentives arising from the differential treatments of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) 142. The same managerial discretions are not exhibited in the purchase price allocation prior to SFAS 142, when goodwill and other intangibles are both amortized. These findings suggest that unverifiable fair value measures are associated with the underlying economics but also deviate from the true values in the presence of management reporting incentives. Further analysis suggests that external appraisers constrain managerial discretion in intangible asset valuation to an extent but do not completely eliminate it.

40|$|A {{major factor}} {{contributing}} to smoking initiation and experimentation by teenagers {{is the ability to}} 'bum' cigarettes. Yet research until now has ignored the impact of a lending/borrowing market on the smoking decisions of teenagers. In this paper, we develop a theoretical model where smoking decisions are determined by an individual's utility maximization process that includes an incentive to lend cigarettes. Predictions from this model are tested using data from the Youth Risk Behavior Surveys that can distinguish between teens who primarily buy and those who primarily bum their cigarettes. We show the ways in which price and restrictions on smoking will impact the decision to buy or bum cigarettes, as well as the impact on the <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>purchased</b> cigarettes between those self-consumed and those lent to others. Key results indicate that as prices and restrictions increase, teenagers {{are less likely to be}} regular smokers who purchase cigarettes and are more likely to consume smaller quantities obtained via the lending market. The basic conclusions are that anti-smoking policies have significant effects on the quantity of cigarettes consumed by teens and that these policies can help reduce the number of teens that escalate from experimental to regular smoking. ...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The {{literature}} on activity-based costing (ABC) {{that deals with}} the <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> indirect <b>purchasing</b> costs primarily draws on a transactional approach to purchasing. This presents a problem, since a large share <b>of</b> <b>purchasing</b> takes place within relationships. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to point out complexities in applying ABC to indirect purchasing costs, when purchasing takes place within long-term relationships. The interaction model is used as a framework. Design/methodology/approach – A case study is conducted on a first-tier supplier in the Swedish automotive industry to illustrate real-life purchasing practices and to point out subsequent difficulties in applying ABC principles. This firm is selected because efforts have simultaneously been undertaken to employ supplier relationship management (SRM) and to implement costing techniques. About 23 interviews were conducted and approximately 31 hours of interview data were collected. Findings – The case shows that many functions tend to be involved in exchange within long-term relationships. This generates additional purchasing-related costs not previously recognized in the costing literature. It also leads to difficulties in allocating these costs. Originality/value – Complexities when implementing ABC are presented, concerning: <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> costs relating to SRM; <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> costs pertaining both to transactions and to relationships; less apparent cost drivers due to involvement of many functions in exchanges; and cost allocation over time.

40|$|I {{examine the}} effects of {{uncertainty}} about the timing of de aIs (i. e. temporary price cuts or sales) on consumer behavior in a dynamic inventory model of consumer choice. I derive implications for purchase behavior and test them empirically, using two years of scanner data for soft drinks. I fmd that loyal consumers' decisions, both about the <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> their <b>purchases</b> over time and the quantity to be purchased in a particular deal, are affected by the uncertainty about the timing of the deal for the product. Loyal consumers buy a higher fraction <b>of</b> their overall <b>purchases</b> during de ais as the uncertainty decreases. This effect increases with an increase in the product' s share of a given consumer' s purchase in the same category or if the consumer stockpiles (i. e., is a shopper). During a particular deal, loyal shoppers increase the quantity they purchase the more time that has passed since the previous de aI, and the higher the uncertainty about the deals' timing. For the non-Ioyal consumers these effects are not significant. These results hold for products that are frequently purchased, like soft-drinks and yogurt, but do not hold for less frequentIy purchased products, such as laundry detergents. The fmdings suggest that manufacturers and retailers should incorporate the effects of deals' timing on consumers' purchase' decisions when deriving optimal pricing strategies...|$|R

In our model, each asset promises delivery of either one unit {{of money in}} the next period or of a real collateral payoff in case of default. Moreover, we include the possibility <b>of</b> <b>purchases</b> <b>of</b> the collateralizable durable good by the central bank. This is done in order to add an additional dimension of monetary policy, which may be of particular relevance when the interest rate reaches the zero lower bound (as has happened in the recent financial crisis). In order to implement such a policy, we must additionally include a rental market for the durable good (so that durables purchased by the central bank can still be used by agents). We examine through numerical examples how the <b>purchases</b> <b>of</b> the central bank affect the equilibrium <b>allocations</b> <b>of</b> resources, and under which conditions such a policy can lead to a Pareto-improvement...|$|R
