50|$|An <b>acoustic</b> <b>tracking</b> {{system is}} copied {{from the nature}} systems of {{positioning}} and orientation. Bats or dolphins navigate in space using ultrasound.Acoustic tracking measures the time during which a particular acoustic signal reaches the receiver. There {{are two ways to}} determine the position of the object: to measure time-of-arrival of the sound wave from the transmitter to the receivers or the phase coherence of the sinusoidal sound wave by receiving the transfer.The main problem with such kind of tracking is absolute position of the object is not known but only periodic changes in its location in separate periods of time. Magnetic tracking has been implemented in Logitech Tracking.|$|E

5000|$|On 20 May 2010, a South Korean-led {{international}} commission {{investigating the}} sinking of Cheonan presented its findings, stating that the ship was sunk by a North Korean torpedo attack.The torpedo parts recovered {{at the site of}} the explosion by a dredging ship on 15 May, which include 5x5 bladed contra-rotating propellers, propulsion motor and a steering section, were claimed to perfectly match the schematics of the CHT-02D torpedo included in introductory brochures provided to foreign countries by North Korea for export purposes. The markings in Hangul, which read [...] "1번" [...] (or No. 1 in English), found inside the end of the propulsion section were said to have been consistent with markings on a previously obtained North Korean torpedo. However, some (The Hankyoreh) have pointed out without the proper reason that in the North, [...] "호" [...] (pronounced [...] "ho") is most often used rather than [...] "번"; and that a North Korean torpedo found seven years ago bears the marking [...] "4호".

However, an expert at a South Korean missile manufacturer disagreed with the idea that the submarine alleged by ROK authorities to have shot the torpedo actually has the capability: [...] "Sango class submarines are known to be used by North Korean commandos in infiltrating areas or laying mines, but they apparently do not have an advanced system to guide homing weapons.

40|$|The recent {{miniaturization}} of <b>acoustic</b> <b>tracking</b> devices {{has allowed}} fishery managers and scientists to collect {{spatial and temporal}} data for sustainable fishery management. The spa-tial and temporal dimensions of fish behavior (movement and/or vertical migrations) are par-ticularly relevant for rockfishes (Sebastes spp.) because most rockfish species are long-lived and have high site fidelity, increasing their vulnerability to overexploitation. In this study, we describe the short-term (with a tracking period of up to 46 d) spatial behavior, as determined by <b>acoustic</b> <b>tracking,</b> of the black rockfish Sebastes schlegelii, a species subject to overexploitation in the Yellow Sea of China. The average residence index (the ratio of detected days to the total period from release to the last detection) {{in the study area}} was 0. 92 ± 0. 13, and most of the tagged fish were detected by only one region of the acoustic receiver array, suggesting relatively high site fidelity to the study area. <b>Acoustic</b> <b>tracking</b> also suggested that this species is more frequently detected during the day than at night in our study area.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a method for}} improving passive <b>acoustic</b> <b>tracking.</b> A large family of <b>acoustic</b> <b>tracking</b> systems combine estimates of the time difference of arrival (TDoA) between pairs of spatially separated sensors - this work improves those estimates by independently tracking each TDoA using a Bayesian filter. This tracking is particularly useful for overcoming spatial aliasing, which results from tracking narrowband, high frequency sources. I develop a theoretical model {{for the evolution of}} each TDoA from a bound placed on the velocity of the target being tracked. This model enables an efficient form of exact marginalization. I then present simulation and experimental results demonstrating improved performance over a simpler nonlinear preprocessor and Kalman filtering, so long as this bound is chosen appropriately. by Mark M.

40|$|Passive <b>acoustic</b> <b>tracking</b> {{provides}} an unobtrusive method of studying {{the movement of}} sound-producing animals in the marine environment where traditional tracking methods may be costly or infeasible. We used passive <b>acoustic</b> <b>tracking</b> to characterize the fine-scale movements of singing humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) on a northwest Atlantic feeding ground. Male humpback whales produce complex songs, a phenomenon that is well documented in tropical regions during the winter breeding season, but also occurs at higher latitudes during other times of year. Acoustic recordings were made throughout 2009 using an array of autonomous recording units deployed in the Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary. Song was recorded during spring and fall, and individual singing whales were localized and tracked throughout the array using a correlation sum estimation method on the time-synchronized recordings. Tracks were constructed for forty-three song sessions, revealing {{a high level of}} variation in movement patterns in both the spring and fall seasons, ranging from slow meandering to faster directional movement. Tracks were 30 min to 8 h in duration, and singers traveled distances ranging from 0. 9 to 20. 1 km. Mean swimming speed was 2. 06 km/h (SD 0. 95). Patterns and rates of movement indicated that most singers were actively swimming. In one case, two singers were tracked simultaneously, revealing a potential acoustic interaction. Our results provide a first description of the movements of singers on a northwest Atlantic feeding ground, and demonstrate the utility of passive <b>acoustic</b> <b>tracking</b> for studying the fine-scale movements o...|$|E

In the marine realm, automated <b>acoustic</b> <b>tracking</b> has become a widely used method for monitoring the movement of free-ranging animals, yet researchers generally lack robust methods for analysing the resulting spatial-usage data.

Sex-specific space-use of the broadnose sevengill shark from acoustic telemetry data was analysed in two ways: The recently proposed spatial network analysis of between-receiver movements was employed to identify sex-specific space-use patterns. To include the full breadth of temporal information held in the data, movements between receivers were furthermore considered as transitions between states of a Markov chain, with the resulting transition probability matrix allowing the ranking of the relative importance of different parts of the study area. Both spatial network and Markov chain analysis revealed sex-specific preferences of different sites within the study area. The identification of priority areas differed for the methods, {{due to the fact that}} in contrast to network analysis, our Markov chain approach preserves the chronological sequence of detections and accounts for both residency periods and movements. In addition to adding to our knowledge of the ecology of a globally distributed apex predator, this study presents a promising new step towards condensing the vast amounts of information collected with <b>acoustic</b> <b>tracking</b> technology into straightforward results which are directly applicable to the management and conservation of any species that meet the assumptions of our model...|$|E
