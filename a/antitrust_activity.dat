Many economists have concluded that such instances constitute an unmistakable signal {{of the presence of}} imperfections in the competitive process. Recent experience in the airline industry suggests, however, that much of the differential pricing we observe in {{the private sector}} is not discriminatory at all in the usual sense.

40|$|Previous {{work has}} shown that state-level {{antitrust}} enforcement activity may have impacts on entry and relocation behavior by U. S. firms. Significant state-level <b>antitrust</b> <b>activity</b> may be an indicator of a perceived adverse business environment and it is found to deter establishment entry, particularly for larger firms in the retail and wholesale sectors. An obvious question is whether establishment exit is affected in a symmetric way, or whether sunk costs of market entry {{may lead to a}} smaller impact in terms of the exit decisions. We first combine US Census establishment exit panel data with data for 1998 - 2006 on US state-level <b>antitrust</b> <b>activity</b> and other measures of state-level business activities that may affect establishment exit.

40|$|This paper {{critically}} {{reviews the}} draft of the Office of Management and Budget's seventh report on the benefits and costs of federal regulation. The draft report represents an improvement over previous reports in two ways. It explores regulatory reform worldwide and discusses the costs of regulation on the manufacturing sector. OMB's focus on the manufacturing sector, however, is unduly narrow. OMB should focus on reforming regulations in other sectors as well. While there has been progress, some useful innovations from last year {{are not included in}} this draft. Unlike last year's report, this year's draft report does not list homeland security regulations by agency or provide useful summary information on a number of OMB's regulatory oversight activities, such as return letters and prompt letters. There is room for significant improvement. We offer six recommendations, four for OMB and two for Congress, that would help hold lawmakers and regulators more accountable for the regulations they produce. Our recommendations focus on getting the regulatory agencies to produce better analysis, making that analysis more transparent and readily available, and making the regulatory process itself more transparent. We recommend that OMB include a scorecard that summarizes the extent to which regulatory analyses comply with OMB's guidelines; apply its in-house expertise {{to improve the quality of}} agency cost-benefit analyses; ask independent agencies to provide annual assessments of the costs and benefits of their major regulations and that OMB report them when available; and include a discussion of the costs and benefits of <b>antitrust</b> <b>activities</b> in its regulatory report.

40|$|This book {{examines}} how firms {{adapt to the}} pressures of increasing international competition by testing both the arguments on ‘strategy specialization’ proposed in the competitiveness literature in general, and those offered by contributors to the ‘varieties of capitalism’ debate in particular. If different economies are characterized by distinct institutional arrangements — successful firms would be the ones that exploit their comparative advantages and specialize in the competitive strategies facilitated by national institutions. The book begins with an assessment of how many pharmaceutical firms in Germany, Italy, and the UK pursue strategies facilitated by national institutions governing financial markets, <b>antitrust</b> <b>activities,</b> and the labour market. Quantitative analyses reveal that deviant firms, competing through institutionally unsupported strategies, outnumber conforming firms by far. Not only does this finding {{run counter to the}} expectations of the competitiveness literature, it brings up a whole new line of inquiry. How can firms compete through strategies that are not supported by national institutions? To address this question, the book combines quantitative analyses with qualitative insights, showing that firms do not necessarily exploit comparative institutional advantages, but that they can successfully circumvent institutional constraints. International markets and individual collaboration on a contractual basis allow firms to compete despite comparative institutional disadvantages. These findings suggest that trade liberalization tends to foster strategy diversification rather than strategy specialization, depending on the inventiveness of entrepreneurs in developing individual approaches toward competing.

40|$|The U. S. {{health care}} system is {{organized}} around markets.   There has, however, been ongoing concern about the functioning of these markets, so much so that some have despaired of these markets working at all. The policy response to this concern has been disjointed. Health care markets are subject to many regulations and interventions. Some of these policies have attempted to substitute regulation for competition, regulating entry and investment (certificate of need laws, health planning) or price (all-payer regulation). At the same time, health care markets have been subject to antitrust enforcement. Recent years have seen a shift away from regulatory policies and toward competition. Antitrust policy towards health care markets has become much more vigorous since the early 1970 s.   Antitrust is intended to ensure the efficient functioning of these markets. As a consequence, competition and antitrust policy have become prominent issues in health policy. Economic research is vital to addressing issues in competition and antitrust in health care. This includes issues of market definition and detecting anticompetitive conduct. In rule of reason cases, where benefits are weighed against costs, it includes measuring the loss of welfare resulting from a particular practice against any gains resulting from it. In this chapter we consider research issues in the analysis of competition and the application of antitrust to health care markets. We outline our views on the analytical issues and review the relevant literatures both from health economics and industrial organization and antitrust generally. Our focus is mainly on hospitals and interactions between hospitals and insurers. This is due, in part, to where there has been <b>antitrust</b> <b>activity.</b> Physician markets are for the most part very unconcentrated, and as such they do not lend themselves to the kinds of anticompetitive conduct the antitrust laws prohibit.   Although issues of competition and antitrust in pharmaceutical markets are fascinating and important, they differ in some fundamental ways from markets for health care services, and as such, we exclude them from this chapter. In what follows we first discuss the optimality of antitrust in health care markets, then horizontal issues in health care markets. This is followed by a discussion of vertical issues, and finally, by a conclusion and a set of recommendations for future research. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{primary goal}} of this {{dissertation}} is to unravel the complex relationships between economic conditions and corporate crime. Theoretically, I propose that much corporate illegality stems from firm profit constraints, constraints which may {{be located in the}} corporate environment. Historically, the concept of organizational environment has been specified as internal to the firm and/or the company 2 ̆ 7 s immediate product market. Firm profit-squeeze may arise not only from these sources, but may be found in business cycle trends as well. ^ The relationship between economic conditions and corporate illegality is tested using longitudinal time series and OLS regression analysis. Fifty-two survivor firms within seven product markets are tracked across fifty-five years, matching firm, industry, and business cycle economic conditions with patterns of antitrust criminality. The findings neither wholeheartedly support or refute this economic framework. I find that a firm 2 ̆ 7 s external environment, as measured by industry and business cycle indicators, has more of an effect on <b>antitrust</b> <b>activity</b> than firm profitability per se. Moreover, the utility of an economic model in explaining antitrust illegality varies greatly by: (a) economic conditions; (b) level of analysis; (c) crime seriousness; and (d) crime type. For example, certain types of antitrust crime (trivial violations) are more likely when industry measures of profitability reflect prosperity rather than scarcity. Serious crimes and/or conspiracy actions are strongly related to declining industry and macro conditions. On the other hand, for some crimes (e. g., price discrimination) an economic explanation of illegality is woefully lacking. ^ The relationships between antitrust criminality and economic conditions clearly are not unequivocal. It is facile to argue that economic constraints alone produce crime or that all antitrust crime is produced from similar conditions. While this study is limited in focus to a few large manufacturing corporations, the fact that such a small sample of firms and industries could produce these diversities of crime types clearly warrants improved conceptual specification of both corporate crime and crime etiology. Until our imagery of corporate illegality can move beyond the monolithic, specific policies aimed at deterrence, punishment, and/or regulation are not firmly grounded. ...|$|E
40|$|The Ninth Circuit {{may soon}} {{consider}} whether challenges to <b>antitrust</b> <b>activity</b> that occurs abroad must invariably be addressed {{under the rule}} of reason, which will make criminal prosecution difficult or impossible. When antitrust cases involve foreign conduct, the courts customarily appraise its substantive antitrust significance only after deciding whether the Sherman Act reaches the activity. Nevertheless, 2 ̆ 2 jurisdictional 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 substantive 2 ̆ 2 inquiries are not wholly independent. Both reflect two sound propositions: that Congress did not intend American antitrust law to rule the entire commercial world and that Congress knew that domestic economic circumstances often differ from those abroad where mechanical application of domestic antitrust decisions would make little economic, political, or social sense. The purpose of the distinction between the per se rule and rule of reason is to identify and distinguish situations where anticompetitive effects can be assessed at relatively low administrative costs from those that require more complete analysis. The Ninth Circuit has spoken of a 2 ̆ 2 jurisdictional 2 ̆ 2 rule of reason. However, merging considerations of comity, foreign interests, and domestic effects from extraterritorial conduct into questions about market definition and competitive impact unnecessarily complicates a set of queries that are already sufficiently complex and are in fact quite different from one another. One rationale for expansive reach when foreign anticompetitive activity causes domestic injury is that the sovereign representing purchasers typically has a greater interest than the sovereign representing sellers. A cartel in one country fixing the price of goods for export transfers wealth away from the territory containing the buyers and toward the territory containing the sellers. Sovereigns, including the United States, have typically been less concerned with condemning restraints on export trade where all the buyers are foreign than with restraints on imports. This aspect of United States policy is reflected in the Foreign Trade Antitrust Improvements Act (FTAIA) as well as the Restatement (Third) of the Foreign Relations Law of the United States. At the same time, however, the 2 ̆ 2 effects 2 ̆ 2 query takes on additional relevance in cases involving extraterritorial conduct, because legislative jurisdiction under the Commerce Clause or statutory reach under the Sherman Act or FTAIA require some harmful effect in the United States. Thus, for example, a naked cartel abroad can be made subject to a criminal indictment and per se treatment. However, the government must show a sufficient effect justifying invocation of United States law. Nevertheless, requiring this effect is quite different from requiring full rule of reason treatment for naked cartel activity...|$|E
