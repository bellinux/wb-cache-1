50|$|The {{unfavorable}} investment climate at {{the time}} constrained the founders to drop the first objective and only organize and operate an aeronautical school, intended to provide professional and technical training to its clients. The school started with One-Year <b>Airframe</b> <b>Mechanic,</b> Two-Year <b>Airframe</b> <b>Mechanic,</b> One Year Power Plant Mechanic and Two-Year Power Plant Mechanic courses. In its second year of operation the Communication Technician course (Avionics) and the Four-Year Aeronautical Engineering course were added.|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedIn {{an environment where}} U. S. military readiness is increasingly critical, this thesis investigates the effects of Marine Corps aviation maintenance qualifications on Marine aircraft readiness. The sample population used in this thesis includes flightline, avionics, and <b>airframe</b> <b>mechanics</b> from heavy, light/attack, and tiltrotor Marine squadrons. The study focuses on three specific qualifications believed {{to have the most}} impact on readiness. The methods used to analyze these relationships include descriptive statistics, multivariate linear regression, and Monte Carlo simulations, using two independent databases (a time-series file containing readiness and basic qualification information from 2012 – 2015, and a cross-sectional file containing a snapshot of qualifications and other human characteristics, from 2015). The time-series linear regression models suggest a positive effect of qualifications on readiness. The cross-sectional linear regression models suggest a positive effect of individual characteristics such as rank, years of service, and marital status. The Monte Carlo simulations extended the regression model’s findings by injecting controlled variability from the distribution types. The Monte Carlo simulations are also used to formulate a recommended number of qualifications a squadron would need when provided with a target readiness score.

40|$|This report {{presents}} a nondestructive inspection assessment of eddy current and electrochemical analysis to separate inconel alloys from stainless steel alloys {{as well as}} an evaluation of cleaning techniques to remove a thermal oxide layer on aircraft exhaust components. The results of this assessment are presented in terms of how effective each technique classifies a known exhaust material. Results indicate that either inspection technique can separate inconel and stainless steel alloys. Based on the experiments conducted, the electrochemical spot test is the optimum for use by <b>airframe</b> and powerplant <b>mechanics.</b> A spot test procedure is proposed for incorporation into the Federal Aviation Administration Advisory Circular 65 - 9 A <b>Airframe</b> & Powerplant <b>Mechanic</b> - General Handbook. 3 refs., 70 figs., 7 tabs...|$|R

5000|$|The airport's sole {{service to}} the air force {{over the next two years}} was {{essentially}} like a roadside truckstop, providing fuel, rest and meals to aircrew flying across the country. By 1942 so many aircraft were stopping at North Bay that No. 124 Squadron, RCAF, set up a seven-man detachment at the airport. Under the command of a Flying Officer (today's rank, Lieutenant), two aeroengine mechanics, an electrician and an <b>airframe</b> <b>mechanic</b> re-fuelled, serviced and repaired the aircraft. A driver and vehicle mechanic saw to the detachment's staff car, aircraft towing tractor and 1000 imp gal fuel truck. The staff car was eventually replaced by a more practical [...] "Truck, Panel, Delivery".|$|E

50|$|A {{significant}} difference between the US and the European systems is that in the United States, aircraft maintenance technicians (Part 65 <b>Airframe</b> and Powerplant <b>Mechanics)</b> are permitted to work under their own certificates and approve their own work for return to service. European Part 66 certificate holders are required to perform their functions under the aegis of a Part 145 organisation for Transport Category and Large (MTOM>5700 kg) Airplanes. The part 145 organisation in the EASA system has the authority to approve for return to service. Many non-European countries have been moving toward the European approach, most notably Canada (See Part 571 of the Canadian Aviation Regulations).|$|R
2500|$|On 18 June 1940, United States {{declared}} an embargo against exporting weapons to any nation {{other than the}} United Kingdom. Optimistically, Republic continued to manufacture EP-106s which, by the 24 October 1940 order, 60 were {{taken over by the}} USAAC as the P-35A. The aircraft were re-armed to American standards with a pair of 0.50in machine guns that fired through the propeller, but retained the Swedish specification of a 0.30in machine gun mounted in each wing. Flight instruments were metric, and both their labeling and flight manuals written in Swedish. Of these, three aircraft were kept in United States as instructional <b>airframes</b> for <b>mechanics.</b> Six P-35As were delivered to Ecuador to form the first combat unit, the Escuadrilla de Caza. The remainder were sent to the Far East Air Force in the Philippines beginning in February 1941. Eventually all pilots of the three pursuit squadrons on Luzon transitioned to the P-35A from the P-26. About 10 of these were lost in accidents. The P-35s were used primarily as gunnery trainers by all three squadrons because of a critical shortage of [...]50-caliber ammunition in the Far East Air Force, placing a strain on the engines of all the aircraft since no replacement engines were available. In October 1941, the P-35s were earmarked for transfer to the Philippine Army Air Corps after sufficient Curtiss P-40 Warhawks were received by the FEAF.|$|R
5000|$|On 29 January 1943, {{the sole}} XB-41 was {{delivered}} to Eglin Field, Florida. Tests were carried out for two months at Eglin during the early winter of 1943. These indicated significant problems with the aircraft; on 21 March 1943, the Army declared the XB-41 as unsuitable for operational use; the conversion of thirteen Liberators to YB-41 service test aircraft was cancelled. Despite this, Consolidated continued {{to work on the}} XB-41 prototype; wide-blade propellers were fitted, and some of the armor was removed to reduce the aircraft's weight. Tests resumed at Eglin on 28 July 1943; however, the basic flaws of the [...] "gunship" [...] concept remained, and the XB-41 program was abandoned. The prototype XB-41 was redesignated TB-24D; it served as an instructional <b>airframe</b> for training <b>mechanics</b> on the B-24. It was scrapped at Maxwell Field, Alabama on 2 February 1945.|$|R
50|$|NASA took {{possession}} of one YO-3A, 69-18010. Following service with the U.S. Army this aircraft {{was transferred to}} an <b>airframe</b> and powerplant <b>mechanics</b> school. NASA's Ames Research Center located at Moffett Federal Airfield in California acquired the YO-3A from the school in 1977. NASA equipped the aircraft with wing-tip and tail-mounted microphones. These microphones were used to record the in-flight acoustic signatures {{of a variety of}} U.S. Army helicopters and Tiltrotor aircraft. The YO-3 was also used to measure sonic booms from the Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird. In 1997, the NASA YO-3A was transferred to the Dryden Flight Research Center (now Armstrong Flight Research Center) at Edwards Air Force Base, in California. The YO-3A remained in a flyable storage state until October 2004. Then the YO-3A was flown back to Ames to support rotorcraft research again for nearly two years before once again returning to Dryden. In 2015, the aircraft was retired by NASA and sold by the General Services Administration at auction to the Vietnam Helicopters Museum.|$|R
5000|$|The Aviation Academy at Andrews High School is an Early College {{program which}} {{provides}} free college classes and free college textbooks for students interested in aviation or engineering careers. Students can earn an associate's degree from Guilford Technical Community College (GTCC) {{while still in}} high school. Credits transfer to other colleges and universities, such as Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University or NC State. The program also provides paid internships at aviation businesses, job shadowing opportunities, and FAA licenses and industry certifications, such as SolidWorks and AutoCAD. The five main tracks of the program are engineering, pilot, <b>airframe</b> & powerplant <b>mechanic</b> (A&P), avionics technician, and aviation business. The Andrews Early College of Health Science offers an opportunity for motivated students {{to prepare for a}} future career in the field of health sciences to include nursing, biotechnology, respiratory therapy, physical therapy, pharmacy or medicine to name a few. Students have the opportunity to participate in internships through their courses to gain practical experience in their field of interest. Students in the program complete a rigorous high school curriculum during their freshman, sophomore, and junior years, which prepares them to take first-year college courses, earning dual credit, as a high school senior and a college student. Guilford County Schools (GCS) pays for tuition and non-consumable text books. Students who complete this program earn an Early College diploma in addition to the GCS high school diploma. From 2012 to 2016, Advancement Via Individual Determination (AVID) was another key program at Andrews. According to the school website, [...] "Our first cohort of students began in the fall of 2012 in the 9th grade. AVID is a yearlong elective course taken during the school day. Students are enrolled in the course after completing an application and interview process. During the AVID elective, students learn organizational and study skills, work on critical thinking and asking probing questions, get academic help from peers and college tutors, and participate in enrichment and motivational activities that make college seem attainable. As students progress in AVID, their self-images improve, and they become academically successful students, leaders, and role models for other students. AVID targets students in the academic middle who have the desire {{to go to college and}} the willingness to work hard. These are students who are capable of completing rigorous curriculum, but are falling short of reaching their potential. Typically, they will be the first in their families to attend college, and many are from low-income or minority families. AVID pulls these students out of their unchallenging courses and puts them on the college track: acceleration instead of remediation." [...] The AVID program was discontinued in the 2016-2017 school year due to budgeting constraints.|$|R
