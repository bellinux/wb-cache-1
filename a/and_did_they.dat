[...] An amendment to the Volstead Act allowing the sale of beer went into effect in April 1933. [...] The availability of beer had a noticeable impact in Ann Arbor on football Saturdays. [...] On October 8, 1933, the day after the Michigan-Michigan State football game, Ford noted that his fraternity was planning a big party with a barrel of beer. [...] He added, [...] "You should have seen the campus this week-end, more drunks than ever and they all claim that the year is just beginning. I'm afraid to imagine what it will be by the Ohio State game." [...] Ford's concern proved prescient. [...] After the Ohio State game, the university attracted unwanted national publicity when its board in control of athletics mailed notices to ticket holders warning that they would be ejected if complaints were received about their drinking. [...] The notices stated that the board was not concerned with [...] "the personal habits and tastes" [...] of ticket-holders, but felt a deep concern [...] "when indulgence in such habits and tastes results in conduct disgusting or offensive to other patrons." ...|$|E
