30|$|In this study, we {{describe}} the principal islets (Brockmann bodies) of a different teleost species, the Atlantic wolffish (<b>Anarhichas</b> <b>lupus),</b> using immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence techniques {{in an attempt to}} better understand the physiological regulation of glucose and the potential usefulness of this teleost fish in endocrinological studies. These endocrine pancreas bodies of fish have occasionally been mistaken for endocrine tumors by pathologists; thus, we also clarify endocrine pancreas structure and function for comparative pathologists. The comparative pancreatic endocrinology of IAPP is poorly described in fish; we therefore focused our study on the isolation of the IAPP gene from the Atlantic wolfish pancreatic tissues. The amino acid sequences of the IAPP were determined, and the in silico analysis was performed to compare the amyloidogenicity of Anarhichas IAPP to other vertebrate species.|$|E
40|$|A {{standardized}} {{survey of}} the nearshore fish fauna of Bonne Bay, a fjord within Gros Morne National Park in western Newfoundland, was conducted using beach seines, gill-nets and bottom trawls {{during the month of}} June over a seven year period (2002 - 2008). The survey documents the presence of 31 fish species (in 17 taxonomic families). Sampling sites varied in benthic habitat and associated fish assemblages. Both juvenile and adult life history stages of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) were present in Bonne Bay, suggesting the presence of a local population or “bay cod stock”. Acadian redfish (Sebastes fasciatus) live in the bay, and may be members of a genetically differentiable population of redfish.

Catches of wolffish were distributed throughout the region, but highest concentrations occurred along the 100 m depth contour of the Gulf of Maine-Georges Bank. Statistical analyses of the depth occurrences revealed a seasonal shift in depth distribution from shallow water ( 50 cm) wolffish migrate to these shallow waters in spring and return to deeper waters in autumn. The oldest wolffish aged was 22 years. Mean length-at-age ranged from 4. 7 cm total length for age 0 to 98. 0 cm total length for age 22 in spring. Growth was modelled best by the Gompertz function.

40|$|During 1992 – 93, an {{extensive}} collection program of seal stomachs was conducted {{as a part}} of the Multi-Species Research program of the Marine Research Institute in Iceland which commenced in 1991. The aim of the seal part of the program was to investigate their food and feeding habits and role as top-predators. In total 1 059 stomachs from grey seals (Halichoerus grypus) (737 had food remains), 799 stomachs from common seals (Phoca vitulina) (493 had food remains), 62 stomachs from hooded seals (Cystophora cristata) (47 had food remains) and 72 stomachs from harp seals (Phoca groenlandica) (39 had food-remains) were obtained. The main food species of grey seals in Icelandic waters ordered in percentage by weight, were cod (Gadus morhua), sand eels (Ammoditdae), catfish (<b>Anarhichas</b> <b>lupus),</b> saithe (Pollachius virens) and lumpsucker (Cyclopterus lumpus).

40|$|The {{antifreeze}} protein {{genes of}} the wolffish (<b>Anarhichas</b> <b>lupus)</b> constitute a large multigene family of 80 to 85 copies, {{which can be}} classified into two sets. One-third of the genes were linked but irregularly spaced. The other two-thirds were organized as 8 -kilobase-pair (kbp) tandem direct repeats that each contained two genes in inverted orientation; DNA sequence analysis suggests that both genes are functional. Except for a single region specific to each gene, the genes and their immediate flanking sequences were 99. 2 % identical. This degree of identity ended soon after a putative transcription termination sequence; as the 3 ' ends of the genes were only 1. 3 kbp apart, these sequences might confer mutual protection from interference by transcriptional runoff. A Southern blot of wolffish DNA restricted with enzymes that do not cut within the tandem repeats indicated that the repeats were clustered in groups of six or more. The organization of antifreeze protein genes in the wolffish was {{very similar to that}} in the unrelated winter flounder, which produces a completely different antifreeze. This similarity might reflect common dynamics by which their progenitors adapted to life in ice-laden sea water...|$|E
40|$|Reduced {{densities of}} Laminaria have been {{reported}} from coastal waters in Sør-Trøndelag, Nord-Trøndelag and Nordland counties. A provisional study of algal vegetation and benthic fauna was made by diving west of Vega in Helgeland, Nordland county (position 65 ° 41 'N 11 ° 43 'E), 17 - 19 October 1979. The study revealed {{a significant difference in}} sublittoral density of sea urchins between three locations selected for abundant, scattered and no Laminaria growth. Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis dominated over Echinus esculentus at all three locations. The lowest sea urchin density was found at the location with abundant Laminaria, and a high density of sea urchins at the location with no or scattered Laminaria. It is therefore presumed that grazing by increasing numbers of sea urchins is a major factor causing a reduction of Laminaria. The catfish (<b>Anarhichas</b> <b>lupus)</b> {{may be the most important}} predator on sea urchins in these waters, and the catfish is preyed upon by seals. It is therefore suggested that increasing local stocks of grey seals (Halichoerus grypus), may have influenced the catfish abundance, and thus allowed the sea urchins to increase with a subsequant detrimental effect on the vegetation of Laminaria...|$|E
40|$|Field caught common {{wolffish}} (<b>Anarhichas</b> <b>lupus)</b> {{and spotted}} wolffish (A. minor) {{have been raised}} from fry on dry pellets. The two species have experienced annual fluctuations in temperature between 6 and 12 °C and the results indicates that both species have there best growth rates below 10 °C. With initial average wet weights of 2. 6 g (common wolffish) and 6. 3 g (spotted wolffish), and at equal experimental conditions, the spotted wolffish reached four times the wet weight of the common wolffish {{over a period of}} two years and 10 months, 3. 4 and 0. 9 kg respectively. The specific growth rate, however, were 0. 62 %d^- 1 and 0. 58 %d^- 1 respectively, indicating only small differences in growth rates in that period. Estimates based upon the fastest growing fish in the experimental groups indicated that at optimum temperature conditions (approx 6 °C) the spotted wolffish will probably reach a total wet weight of 6 kg in two years from start-feeding, while the common wolffish (below 10 °C) will reach a weight of 3 kg in that same period.

40|$|We {{conducted}} a literature review of reported temperature, salinity, pH, depth and oxygen preferences and thresholds of important marine species {{found in the}} Gulf of St. Lawrence and Scotian Shelf region. We classified 54 identified fishes and macroinvertebrates as important either because they support a commercial fishery, have threatened or at risk status, or meet {{one of the following}} criteria: bycatch, baitfish, invasive, vagrant, important for ecosystem energy transfer, or predators or prey of the above species. The compiled data allow an assessment of species-level impacts including physiological stress and mortality given predictions of future ocean physical and biogeochemical conditions. If an observed, multi-decadal oxygen trend on the central Scotian Shelf continues, a number of species will lose favorable oxygen conditions, experience oxygen-stress, or disappear due to insufficient oxygen in the coming half-century. Projected regional trends and natural variability are both large, and natural variability will act to alternately amplify and dampen anthropogenic changes. When estimates of variability are included with the trend, species encounter unfavourable oxygen conditions decades sooner. Finally, temperature and oxygen thresholds of adult Atlantic wolffish (<b>Anarhichas</b> <b>lupus)</b> and adult Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) are assessed {{in the context of a}} potential future scenario derived from high-resolution ocean models for the central Scotian Shelf...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{biologic}} {{attributes of}} the endocrine pancreas and the comparative endocrinology of islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) of fish are not well described in the literature. This study describes the endocrine pancreas of one teleostean fish. Ten captive Atlantic wolffish (<b>Anarhichas</b> <b>lupus)</b> from the Montreal Biodome were submitted for necropsy and their pancreata were collected. Results: Grossly, all the fish pancreata examined contained 1 - 3 nodules of variable diameter (1 - 8 mm). Microscopically, the nodules were uniform, highly cellular, and composed of polygonal to elongated cells. Immunofluorescence for pancreatic hormones was performed. The nodules were immunoreactive for insulin most prominent centrally, but with IAPP and glucagon only in {{the periphery of the}} nodules. Exocrine pancreas was positive for chromogranin A. Not previously recognized in fish, IAPP immunoreactivity occurred in α, glucagon-containing, cells and did not co-localize with insulin in β cells. The islet tissues were devoid of amyloid deposits. IAPP DNA sequencing was performed to compare the sequence among teleost fish and the potency to form amyloid fibrils. In silico analysis of the amino acid sequences 19 - 34 revealed that it was not amyloidogenic. Conclusions: Amyloidosis of pancreatic islets would not be expected as a spontaneous disease in the Atlantic wolffish.

Rates of protein consumption and white muscle and whole-body protein synthesis increased in a linear fashion between 5 and 14 °C. In contrast, {{the relationships between}} temperature and white muscle and whole-body protein growth, protein growth efficiency (PPV) and protein synthesis retention efficiency (kg/ks) were parabolic. The {{results indicated that the}} optimum water temperatures for growth (Topt. G) and growth efficiency (Topt. GE) were 10 – 11 and 9 – 10 °C, respectively. The maximum white muscle and whole-body protein growth rates recorded at Topt. G were 0. 9 and 0. 7 %·day– 1, respectively. At Topt.

40|$|AbstractIn {{the early}} 2000 s, {{experimental}} rearing of spotted wolffish, Anarhichas minor, {{was started in}} Iceland. Health surveillance, carried out at regular intervals during the rearing period, revealed persistent and highly prevalent Kudoa infections of fish muscles which caused great financial losses due to post mortem myoliquefaction. In addition, during the traditional process of drying and smoking wild Atlantic lumpfish, Cyclopterus lumpus, the muscles from some fish almost completely disappear and the fish have to be discarded. To describe the etiological agent responsible for these conditions, spotted wolffish, Atlantic wolffish <b>Anarhichas</b> <b>lupus,</b> northern wolffish Anarhichas denticulatus and Atlantic lumpfish were caught off the Icelandic coast and examined {{for the presence of}} Kudoa. We describe a novel myxosporean, Kudoa islandica n. sp., using morphological and molecular data, and show with histopathology that it causes extensive myoliquefaction in three different wild fish hosts, which all are commercially valuable species in Iceland. Although some spore dimensions varied significantly between fish species, the molecular analyses showed that the same parasite was responsible for infection in all fish. The northern wolffish was not found to be infected. Although robustly placed in the Kudoa clade in phylogenetic analyses, K. islandica was phylogenetically distinct from other kudoids. A single myxosporean, K. islandica, is responsible for the infections in the somatic muscles of lumpfish and wolffish, causing extensive post mortem myoliquefaction. This myxosporean is likely to infect other fish species and it is important to study its life cycle in order to evaluate any threat to salmonid culture via the use of lumpfish as a biocontrol for sea lice...|$|E
40|$|Harbour {{seals in}} Svalbard have short longevity, despite being {{protected}} from human hunting and having limited terrestrial predation at their haulout sites, low contaminant burdens and no fishery by-catch issues. This {{led us to}} explore the diet of Greenland sharks (Somniosus microcephalus) in this region as a potential seal predator. We examined gastrointestinal tracts (GITs) from 45 Greenland sharks in this study. These sharks ranged from 229 to 381 cm in fork length and 136 - 700 kg in body mass; all were sexually immature. Seal and whale tissues were found in 36. 4 and 18. 2 %, respectively, of the GITs that had contents (n = 33). Based on genetic analyses, the dominant seal prey species was the ringed seal (Pusa hispida); bearded seal (Erignathus barbatus) and hooded seal (Cystophora cristata) tissues were each found in a single shark. The sharks had eaten ringed seal pups and adults based {{on the presence of}} lanugo-covered prey (pups) and age determinations based on growth rings on claws (< 1 year and adults). All of the whale tissue was from minke whale (Balenoptera acutorostrata) offal, from animals that had been harvested in the whale fishery near Svalbard. Fish dominated the sharks' diet, with Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua), Atlantic wolffish (<b>Anarhichas</b> <b>lupus)</b> and haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus) being the most important fish species. Circumstantial evidence suggests that these sharks actively prey on seals and fishes, in addition to eating carrion such as the whale tissue.

40|$|Research {{on sexual}} maturity, {{spawning}} and fecundity of Atlantic wolffish (<b>Anarhichas</b> <b>lupus)</b> {{in various parts}} of the Northwest Atlantic, and on the resultant length-weight effects, was carried out incidentally during 1946 - 67 in conjunction with investigations which were directed toward other demersal species. Sexual maturity in females began at a relatively small size (43 ern) off Labrador and northeastern Newfoundland, in contrast to a much larger size (58 cm) in the St. Pierre Bank and southern Grand Bank areas, with the size on the northern Grand Bank (49 cm) being intermediate. In other areas from the Scotian Shelf to West Greenland, the sizes at first maturity were similar to or smaller than 43 cm. Maximal lengths of wolffish were considerably greater in areas where sexual maturity occurred at larger sizes than in areas where it occurred at much smaller sizes. Trends in weight of ovaries and sizes of eggs throughout the year indicated that spawning was mainly in the autumn. However, a wolffish (apparently A. lupus) egg cluster, with some eggs hatched, was found on the southern Grand Bank in April 1960. Fecundity increased exponentially with fish length, the average number of eggs being 2, 440 at 40 cm and 35, 320 at 120 cm. Length-weight relationships (log-log regressions) indicated that average weights by calendar quarter typically ranged from lowest to highest in October-December, January-March, April-June and July-September. The low values in October-December were attributed to fasting and change of teeth which occur during the spawning period, followed by resumption of feeding and consequent increase in weight-at-Iength to highest values in July-September...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{investigated}} {{the impact of}} two environmental factors {{on the performance of}} larval striped wolffish (<b>Anarhichas</b> <b>lupus).</b> Specifically, I describe the impact of photoperiod and light intensity on the growth, survival, and feeding behaviour of larval wolffish. [...] In the photoperiod experiment, larval wolffish were subjected to photoperiods consisting of 12 hours light/ 12 hours dark, 18 hours light/ 6 hours light, or 24 hours continuous light. Results showed that a photoperiod of 18 L/ 6 D yielded the best survival and growth after 50 days. Providing 24 hours light, a common technique in larviculture, did not offer any advantage in terms of survival or growth compared to the 18 L treatment. The higher performance results seen for the 18 L treatment is attributed to the similarity in photoperiod of the natural environment for the species. [...] The investigation into the effects of light intensity on the survival and growth of larval wolffish compared intensities of 10, 40, 160, 320, 750, and 1200 lux. For all values tested, survival and growth increased with increasing light intensity. A light intensity in the range of 750 lux- 1200 lux produced survival rates of approximately 92. 0 % by day 50. [...] The effects of light intensity (320 lux, 750 lux, 1200 lux) on the feeding and activity of larvae were also investigated. The frequency of feeding increased with increasing light intensity. The impact of light intensity was most significant during days 30 - 40, a period corresponding to the switch from endogenous to exogenous feeding in larval wolffish. During this period, the larval in the highest light intensity treatment (1200 lux) had significantly greater frequencies of feeding compared to the lowest light intensity treatment (320 lux).

40|$|The striped {{wolffish}} (<b>Anarhichas</b> <b>lupus)</b> is {{a candidate}} species for commercial aquaculture m Newfoundland. It possesses a number of characteristics which facilitate culture, such as large eggs, well developed larvae which readily accept formulated feeds and tolerance to low temperatures. Little {{research has been conducted}} to determine the dietary requirements of the juvenile wolffish or the optimum stocking density and feeding frequency. The effects of three feeding frequencies (two meals/day, one meal/day and one meal/two days) on various growth parameters were investigated. Mean meal size was significandy and inversely affected by the feeding frequency. In addition, total feed consumption over time was directly affected by the meal frequency. The specific growth rate (SGR) was not adversely affected by the decrease in meal frequency or feed intake. Feed and labour costs, therefore, may both be reduced by lowering the frequency, without compromising the SGR. The stocking density also affected the feed consumption. The smallest mean meal size (3. 990 mg/g fish) was consumed by fish stocked at 80 g/L. The largest meals were consumed by fish stocked at 50 g/L (4. 955 mg/g) while the meal size of fish stocked at 20 g/L was in between these values. The feed conversion ratio (FCR) decreased significantly when the stocking density was greater than 50 g/L and the protein efficiency ratio (PER) was significantly higher when the stocking density was greater than 50 g/L. The dietary energy balance, expressed as the protein energy:total energy ratio (PE:TE) had a significant negative influence on the intake of feed, lipid and energy. As the PE:TE increased, the feed, lipid and energy intakes all decrease significandy. The PE:TE had no significant impact on the FCR or PER at either constant 9 °C or ambient temperatures (13. 0 °C to 2. 0 °C). The production cost (based on feed costs per kilogram of fish produced) was not significantly affected by the PE:TE or by decreasing temperatures...|$|E

40|$|During winter, {{the coastal}} waters of Newfoundland can be {{considered}} a "freeze risk ecozone" for teleost fishes. The benthic Atlantic (<b>Anarhichas</b> <b>lupus</b> - AW) and spotted wolffish (A. minor - SW) reside at opposite ends of this ecozone, with the AW facing the greatest risk because of its shallower niche. To resist freezing, AW secretes five times the level of plasma antifreeze protein (AFP) activity than does SW. [...] The main basis for this difference in plasma AFP levels is gene dosage, as AW has approximately three times more AFP genes than SW. Perhaps as a result, AFP transcript levels in liver (the primary source of circulating AFP's) are several times higher in AW. One explanation for these gene and transcript dosage differences is the presence of tandemly arrayed AFP gene repeats in AW that make up two-thirds of its AFP gene pool. Such repeats are not present in SW. AW and SW diverged from a common ancestor {{at a time when the}} ebb and flow of northern glaciations would have resulted in the emergence of "freeze risk ecozones". The duplication/amplification of AFP genes in a subpopulation of ancestral wolffish would have facilitated the exploitation of this high risk habitat, resulting in the divergence and evolution of modem day AW and SW species. [...] Investigations on artificially produced AW/SW hybrids showed that all the AFP genes of SW are likely shared with AW, which supports recent gene amplification as an impetus for speciation. The high dynamism of the AW AFP locus (through high variability in dosage and organisation) was best visualized in the single haplotype inherited by the hybrids. Their intermediate levels of plasma AFPs make these fish unfit for survival within the shallowest part of the "freeze risk ecozone". [...] While the total levels of AFP gene transcripts varied little from winter to summer in both species (especially in the liver), differential expression of members of the two subfamilies of type III AFPs, the SP- and QAE-type genes (appellation based on the ion-exchange Sephadex resins to which each type of isoform binds), was observed. While the expression of the QAE-type transcripts was ubiquitous (both temporally and spatially), that of the SP-type genes seemed to show some level of tissue specificity, which highlights the complex evolutionary history of these genes...|$|E
40|$|Two of {{the main}} factors {{contributing}} to the growth and survival of larval fish are food and temperature. Adequate food must be provided when the larvae switch from endogenous to exogenous feeding. Temperature can affect growth rate, survival, and metabolism. Feeding and temperature {{studies were carried out}} on newly hatched striped wolffish (<b>Anarhichas</b> <b>lupus).</b> In a preliminary study larvae were fed three densities of Artemia, 100 / 1, 300 / 1, and 900 / 1. Survival was not significantly different among treatments (mean 19. 5 ± 5. 78 %) but growth rates were affected by prey density. A non-feeding study showed that larvae can survive on their yolk reserves for 2 to 4 weeks with the first mortality occurring at 15 days post-hatch. Larvae raised on a combination of Artemia and dry feed showed improved survival over the initial prey density study. The level of Artemia influenced growth, survival and weaning time. Final percent survival for larvae fed 900 Artemia/ 1 plus dry diet was 94. 3 % as compared to 52. 6 % for larvae fed 100 Artemia/ 1 plus a dry diet. Growth was also significantly faster for larvae fed at 900 / 1. Larvae offered a larger density of Artemia initially consumed more Artemia and weaned themselves onto dry feed two weeks earlier than larvae fed the smaller density of Artemia. Larvae were also raised at 3 different temperature regimes, high (8. 0 - 13. 5 °C), low (4. 0 - 7. 8 °C), and ambient (3. 0 - 13. 5 °C). High temperature had the greatest effect on survival in the first 6 weeks. Survival levelled off after this time. Final survival for high, low, and ambient was 50. 5 %, 16. 0 %, and 6. 8 % respectively. Overall larvae grown at higher temperatures were larger than those at the lower temperature range. Specific growth rate however dropped at higher temperatures later in the study. [...] The results of this experiment suggest that wolffish larvae should be fed a combination of Artemia and dry pellets immediately from hatch. Artemia should be continued until about 6 weeks or a length of 30 mm. At this time the larvae should be observed consuming primarily dry food. Temperature should be maintained at 4 - 8 °C for the first 6 weeks. Evidence suggests that the temperature should not exceed 8 °C after 6 weeks however further investigation is needed...|$|E
40|$|The {{focus of}} the present study was to {{investigate}} the soft bottom community (including in- and epifauna) at the coastal slope (5 m to 30 m) in Kongsfjorden, and to estimate its importance as food source for demersal fish. For these purposes the macrozoobenthos was sampled at six sampling locations. In total 30 samples were taken (6 x 5 replicates) by means of a steel frame of 200 cm 2 area size. A suction pump (airlift) collected the soft bottom fauna within the designated area. Polychaets (84 %), molluscs (10 %) and crustaceans (3 %) dominated the soft bottom community. In total, 63 species were found, including 30 species which have not been recorded in Kongsfjorden earlier. Seven species have not yet been recorded for the entire archipelago of Svalbard (according to Gulliksen et al. 1999). The average abundance was 6293 individuals m- 2, the average biomass was 14 g ash free dry mass (afDM) m- 2. Three community types could be identified by means of cluster-analysis and multidimensional scaling: The shallow water community at 5 m (28 species; 2260 individuals m- 2; 3. 5 g m- 2 afDM), the mid-water community between 10 m and 20 m (51 species; 7184 individuals m- 2; 20. 7 g m- 2 afDM) and the deep-watercommunity in the range of 25 m and 30 m (44 species; 6982 individuals m- 2; 10. 6 g m- 2 afDM). The species found were then categorized with respect to their feeding ecology and were classified to their zoogeography. Five species were omnivorous, 23 carnivorous, 25 detritivorous and 18 suspesion feeders. Most of the species (34) were arctic-boreal followed by cosmopolitan species (20); only five species were true arctic. Furthermore ecological indices were calculated: the Margalef Index (1. 45 2. 23), Shannon-Wiener diversity (1. 85 2. 19) and evenness (0. 67 0. 82). Six dominant species (> 10 %) were identified (Crassicorophium crassicorne, Chaetozone setosa, Dipolydora quadrilobata, Euchone analis, Scoloplos armiger and Spio armata) and three were determined as indicator species (Dipolydora quadrilobata, Euchone analis and Scoloplos armiger). Nine species of demersal fish were found in shallow areas (5 m to 30 m) of Kongsfjorden: <b>Anarhichas</b> <b>lupus,</b> Anisarchus medius, Eumicrotremus derjugini, Gadus morhua, Gymnacanthus tricuspis, Leptoclinus maculatus, Liparis liparis, Lumpenus lampretaeformis and Myoxocephalus scorpius. According to the literature these fish species were feeding on the bottom community, in particular on taxa witch found at this study Priapulus caudatus, Scoloplos armiger, Anonyx sarsi, Crassicorophium sp., Ischyrocerus sp., Monoculodes tesselatus, Onisimus edwardsi, Sclerocrangon boreas and Ophiura sarsi. Polychaets (up to 87 %), amphipods (up to 56 %), molluscs (up to 50 %) and echinoderms (up to 48 %) dominated the spectrum of food source.

40|$|The common {{wolffish}} (<b>Anarhichas</b> <b>lupus),</b> a benthivorous species, {{is widely}} dispersed, although not {{abundant in the}} North Sea north of 54 ºN latitude. Despite being widely distributed in sub Arctic and cold North Atlantic waters, little is known of the ecology of this species in the North Sea. This thesis aimed to provide ecological information for this species at the southern limit of its range in the Northeast Atlantic. North Sea common wolffish are regarded as sedentary in habit and mainly inhabited depths ranging from 60 m to 150 m. The bottom temperatures where this species {{were found in the}} North Sea ranged between 3 ºC and 12 ºC. The common wolffish is a by-catch species for the North Sea bottom trawl fishery. The long-term catch data and CPUE (catch per unit effort) indicated that the stock abundance of North Sea common wolfish has been decreasing over the last decades. However, it is suggested from VPA (virtual population analysis) and Yield-per-recruit analysis, that the North Sea common wolfish stock is still in a safe condition but has been overexploited. The means of total mortality (Z), natural mortality (M) and fishing mortality (F) of this species for 1996 - 1998 were 0. 47, 0. 17 and 0. 30, respectively. Both resting metabolic rate (RMR) and maximum metabolic rate (MMR) were low for this species. RMR and MMR were measured for six adult common wolffish (mean weight, 1. 39 kg) at 5 ºC and 10 ºC. At 5 ºC the mean RMR± SE was 12. 18 ± 1. 6 mgO(_ 2),kg(^- 1) h(^- 1), and mean MMR ± SE was 70. 65 ± 7. 63 mgO(_ 2) kg(^- 1) h(^- 1). At 10 ºC the mean RMR±SE was 25. 43 ± 1. 31 mgO(_ 2) kg (^- 1) h(^- 1), and mean MMR ± SE was 113. 84 ± 16. 26 mgO(_ 2) kg(^- 1) h(^- 1). Absolute metabolic scope was 53 % greater at 10 ºC than at 5 ºC. The main food for common wolffish in the North Sea were Decapoda comprising 39 % of the overall diet by occurrence, with hermit crabs (Paguridae) being the dominant species. Other important dietary components were Bivalvia (20 %) and Gastropoda (12 %). Sea urchins (Echinidae), which are important prey of common wolffish in eastern Newfoundland, Gulf of Maine and Iceland, but typically of low energy value, occupied only 7 % of the diet. During the autumn/winter season, wolffish consumed less food compared with the remainder of the year. From this study, von Bertalanffy growth parameters for common wolffish in the North Sea were calculated to be: for male, L(_oo) = 111. 2 cm, t(_o) = - 0. 43 and = 0. 12; and for female, L(_oo) = 115. 1 cm, t(_o) = - 0. 39 and K = 0. 11, making North Sea common wolffish the fastest growing stock of this species reported. The fast growth of North Sea common wolffish may be a result of the higher energy content of the diet or greater metabolic scope available for food processing. This increased metabolic scope being associated with life in the warmer North Sea, in comparison to those stocks found elsewhere in the range of this typically sub-Arctic species. The maximum age found for this species in the North Sea was 18 years old. Median length at sexual maturity of male and female common wolffish is at 51. 9 cm and 50. 4 cm respectively, with the age of sexual maturity being achieved at 4 - 5 years in the North Sea. The spawning season of North Sea common wolffish is from October through to February. The fecundity varied with the body weight of females, from several thousand to 12, 000 eggs. Ripe egg sizes ranged from 5 mm to 6. 5 mm. Spermatozoa were found in mature male individuals throughout the whole year with the highest peak in October...|$|E
