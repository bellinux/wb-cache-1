50|$|The main {{theme of}} the {{convention}} was economic and social liberty for free African Americans. The delegates recognized that while {{the abolition of slavery}} was an important issue, it would be useless if the racial prejudice that had grown up in the North was allowed to persist. Therefore, they discussed ways to help African Americans become economically independent, in order to gain the respect of whites. First, they brought up the creation of an industrial school for free blacks, but dismissed the idea as being inefficient and costly. Then, they continued to discuss the many merits of apprenticeships, and throughout the convention minutes, there is an emphasis on education, specifically in the area of mechanical trades. Overall, the convention provides a hopeful message that by increasing the availability of knowledge <b>and</b> opportunities for <b>young,</b> <b>free</b> African Americans, a better reward could await those still suffering under the yoke of slavery upon the advent of their freedom.|$|R
