5|$|I do not, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> {{no doubt}} your Lordships do not, have any wish {{to expand the}} role of the {{judiciary}} at the expense of any other organ of the State or to seek to frustrate the properly expressed wish of Parliament as contained in legislation. The attribution in certain quarters of such a wish to the judiciary is misconceived and appears to be the product of lack of understanding of the judicial function and the sources of law which the courts are bound to apply.|$|E
5|$|I {{have already}} made {{investigations}} {{about you and your}} people <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> verified your ability to make a deal. Now then, I am prepared to sell you one million Jews... Goods for blood– blood for goods. You can take them from any country you like, wherever you can find them– Hungary, Poland, the Ostmark, from Theresienstadt, from Auschwitz, wherever you like.|$|E
5|$|I {{think you}} do plant a few acorns, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> lived to see one or two trees growing: gay rights, freedom of information, CND. I'm not {{claiming}} them for myself but you feel you have encouraged other people and see the arguments developing.|$|E
5000|$|Moyers {{said that}} he {{returned}} to television because [...] "nothing else was as interesting. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> done some writing <b>and</b> speaking, but <b>I</b> love television. It lets me work with colleagues <b>and</b> comrades. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> breath <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> energy <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> funders." [...] He said the show would focus less on field reporting and more on [...] "meaty conversations".|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ben Robinson <b>and</b> <b>I.</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{often been}} there, after sea anemones <b>and</b> weeds, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> a rope round me, so don't be angry, Markham.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'That is true; but oh, Sahib, {{that man}} betrayed me <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> no thought--but the heifer's tail waved in the {{moonlight}} <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> my knife. What else should <b>I</b> <b>have</b> done? The tail came off ere I was aware. Sahib, thou knowest more than I.' ...|$|R
5|$|If {{you guys}} think I'm a diva <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> {{requirements}}, Snoop is the next level. He's the hip-hop king! So his requirements to get to Paris are, like, beyond platinum editions; they're, like, beyond ultra-platinum editions; they're like diamond editions. So we love Snoop and we wish he had been here, but I think shooting him in L.A. will be good because we'll have more time, more control. He probably would have gotten really mobbed in the streets here anyway.|$|E
5|$|Last year I decided I'm {{not doing}} music until I'm excited again, then this {{came along and}} also I did end up making another record which I'll release at some point. It's just being mastered, it's a lovely album; I didn't write this one, this is old songs <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> to sort out my situation- I don't want the same problem as before.|$|E
5|$|One word {{more about}} the bawdy, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> done. I own the first night this thing was acted, some indecencies had like to have happened, {{but it was not}} my fault. The fine gentleman of the play, {{drinking}} his mistress's health in Nantes brandy from six in the morning to the time he waddled upon the stage in the evening, had toasted himself up to such a pitch of vigour, I confess I once gave Amanda for gone.|$|E
6000|$|After Miss Fanny <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> talked, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{told her}} my plan, which she {{pronounced}} to be delightful, she continued:--"I never was so provoked in my life, Mr. Titmarsh, as when that odious man came and interrupted that dear delightful conversation." ...|$|R
60|$|It was {{not until}} we were shut up in our cabin-room <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> had time to take breath that I began to think why <b>I</b> <b>had</b> made such haste. In one of the sunburnt faces <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{recognized}} Mr. Allan Woodcourt, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> been afraid of his recognizing me. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> been unwilling that he should see my altered looks. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> been taken by surprise, and my courage had quite failed me.|$|R
50|$|It becomes {{harder and}} the enthusiasm wanes. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> been {{training}} {{for so many}} years <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> had my best years. <b>I</b> could <b>have</b> ridden a few more but I decided that was it. I wasn't going to improve <b>and</b> <b>I</b> was no longer as good as <b>I</b> <b>had</b> been.|$|R
5|$|He later {{spoke on}} the {{background}} of the album's sound, saying, I'm 28 years old, and I see that I'm kind of in this weird position. I don't have many friends in my personal life, but I have so many fans. So when I go outside and people recognize me, it's kind of a bittersweet feeling, like I don't recognize the fans. I don't really have it like they probably think I have it. I'm really still a loser guy, but I'm just really popular now. I don't have a girlfriend no more, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> this money, but I'm not satisfied with my life. It's this weird feeling of being incomplete, and I need to find myself. So that's kind of what it did to me, and the album just came out with me just fucking rapping some dark shit.|$|E
5|$|Satchel {{was easier}} to catch. He could throw it in a quart cup. But Rogan {{was all over the}} plate—high, low, inside, outside. He'd walk five-six men, but he didn't give up many runs. Bullet had a little more steam on the ball than Paige—and he had a better-breaking curve. The batters thought it was a fastball heading for them and they would jump back from the plate and all of a sudden, it would break sharply for a strike. I would rank him with today's best. I have never seen a pitcher like him, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> caught some of the best {{pitchers}} in the business.|$|E
25|$|<b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> been {{frequently}} sold.|$|E

60|$|The {{next day}} was Sunday, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> it all to myself; <b>and</b> now, thought <b>I,</b> my guide-book <b>and</b> <b>I</b> shall <b>have</b> a famous ramble up street and down lane, even unto the furthest limits of this Liverpool.|$|R

25|$|Vicki <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> {{been sitting}} weeping into our coffees {{for the last}} couple of years. We have looked at all our hard work and thought: 'My God, what's happening?'

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>have</b> been vile myself, but <b>have</b> {{obtained}} mercy; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> would <b>have</b> {{my companions}} in sin partake of mercy too: <b>and,</b> therefore, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> writ this little book.|$|R
6000|$|... "Eight {{weeks passed}} away like this, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> written about Abbots and Archery and Armour and Architecture and Attica, and hoped with {{diligence}} that I might {{get on to}} the B's before very long.

60|$|During {{that time}} of pursuit we saw nothing of the leaders, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{come to believe that}} they {{were among the first to}} flee, when {{suddenly}} the sergeant, in whose company Jacob <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> remained, pointed out amid the bushes what appeared to be a large portmanteau which had evidently been cast aside by some of the fugitives.|$|R
25|$|I am now, for {{the most}} part, {{in a part of}} the world I never expected, it is however a place that has afforded me relief and saved my life, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> the {{happiness}} to assure you that I am now in perfect health....|$|E
25|$|You <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> been in many battles, and we {{know there}} are always some mistakes. This time we were right because the enemy did what we {{expected}} him to do.

25|$|Recently my {{work with}} color has led me, {{in spite of}} myself, to search little by little, with some {{assistance}} (from the observer, from the translator), for the realization of matter, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> decided to end the battle. My paintings are now invisible and I would like to show them in a clear and positive manner, in my next Parisian exhibition at Iris Clert's.|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{never before}} seen Agnes cry. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> seen {{tears in her eyes}} when <b>I</b> <b>had</b> brought new honours home from school, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> seen them there when we last spoke about her father, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> seen her turn her gentle head aside when we took leave of one another; but <b>I</b> <b>had</b> never seen her grieve like this.
