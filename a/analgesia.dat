5|$|Methoxyflurane is an {{extremely}} potent and highly lipid-soluble anesthetic agent, characterized by very slow induction (onset of action) and emergence (offset or dissipation) times. It is non-flammable, has relatively mild hemodynamic effects, {{and it does not}} predispose the heart to rhythm disturbances. It is, however, a significant respiratory depressant. Methoxyflurane has powerful analgesic (pain-relieving) properties at well below full anesthetic doses. It was utilized in self-administration devices for obstetric <b>analgesia,</b> in a manner that foreshadowed the patient-controlled <b>analgesia</b> infusion pumps of today.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the high}} blood {{solubility}} of methoxyflurane is often undesirable, this property makes it useful in certain situations—it persists in the lipid compartment {{of the body}} for a long time, providing sedation and <b>analgesia</b> well into the postoperative period. There is substantial data to indicate that methoxyflurane is an effective analgesic and sedative agent at subanesthetic doses. Supervised self-administration of methoxyflurane in children and adults can briefly lead to deep sedation, {{and it has been}} used as a patient controlled analgesic for painful procedures in children in hospital emergency departments. During childbirth, administration of methoxyflurane produces significantly better <b>analgesia,</b> less psychomotor agitation, and only slightly more somnolence than trichloroethylene.|$|E
5|$|In 1968, Robert Wexler of Abbott Laboratories {{developed}} the Analgizer, a disposable inhaler {{that allowed the}} self-administration of methoxyflurane vapor in air for <b>analgesia.</b> The Analgizer consisted of a polyethylene cylinder 5inches long and 1inch in diameter with a 1inch long mouthpiece. The device contained a rolled wick of polypropylene felt which held 15milliliters of methoxyflurane. Because of {{the simplicity of the}} Analgizer and the pharmacological characteristics of methoxyflurane, it was easy for patients to self-administer the drug and rapidly achieve a level of conscious <b>analgesia</b> which could be maintained and adjusted as necessary {{over a period of time}} lasting from a few minutes to several hours. The 15milliliter supply of methoxyflurane would typically last for two to three hours, during which time the user would often be partly amnesic to the sense of pain; the device could be refilled if necessary. The Analgizer was found to be safe, effective, and simple to administer in obstetric patients during childbirth, as well as for patients with bone fractures and joint dislocations, and for dressing changes on burn patients. When used for labor <b>analgesia,</b> the Analgizer allows labor to progress normally and with no apparent adverse effect on Apgar scores. All vital signs remain normal in obstetric patients, newborns, and injured patients. The Analgizer was widely utilized for <b>analgesia</b> and sedation until the early 1970s, in a manner that foreshadowed the patient-controlled <b>analgesia</b> infusion pumps of today. The Analgizer inhaler was withdrawn in 1974, but use of methoxyflurane as a sedative and analgesic continues in Australia and New Zealand in the form of the Penthrox inhaler. Trials of methoxyflurane as an analgesic in emergency medicine are going on in the UK.|$|E
5|$|An {{intrathecal}} pump infuses an opioid such as morphine {{directly into}} the fluid-filled space (the subarachnoid cavity) between the spinal cord and its protective sheath, providing enhanced <b>analgesia</b> with reduced systemic side effects. This can reduce the level of pain in otherwise intractable cases. An anxiolytic or a nonopioid analgesic, and local anesthetics may also be infused along with the opioid.|$|E
5|$|Oral <b>analgesia</b> is the {{cheapest}} and simplest mode of delivery. Other delivery routes such as sublingual, topical, transdermal, parenteral, rectal or spinal {{should be considered}} if the need is urgent, or in case of vomiting, impaired swallow, obstruction of the gastrointestinal tract, poor absorption or coma. Current evidence for the effectiveness of fentanyl transdermal patches in controlling chronic cancer pain is weak but they may reduce complaints of constipation compared with oral morphine.|$|E
5|$|Treatment {{is based}} on the {{severity}} of poisoning from the bite; the majority of cases do not require medical care, and patients with localised pain, swelling and redness usually only require local application of ice and simple oral <b>analgesia</b> such as paracetamol. Pressure immobilisation of the wound site is not recommended. Keeping the victim still and calm is beneficial.|$|E
5|$|Radiotherapy is {{used when}} drug {{treatment}} is failing {{to control the}} pain of a growing tumor, such as in bone metastisis (most commonly), penetration of soft tissue, or compression of sensory nerves. Often, low doses are adequate to produce <b>analgesia,</b> thought {{to be due to}} reduction in pressure or, possibly, interference with the tumor's production of pain-promoting chemicals. Radiopharmaceuticals that target specific tumors have been used to treat the pain of metastatic illnesses. Relief may occur within a week of treatment and may last from two to four months.|$|E
5|$|Each 3milliliter dose lasts {{approximately}} 30minutes. Pain relief begins after 6–8 breaths {{and continues}} {{for several minutes}} after stopping inhalation. The maximum recommended dose is 6milliliters per day or 15milliliters per week {{because of the risk}} of cumulative dose-related nephrotoxicity, and it should not be used on consecutive days. Despite the potential for renal impairment when used at anesthetic doses, no significant adverse effects {{have been reported in the}} literature when it is used at the lower doses (up to 6milliliters) used for producing <b>analgesia</b> and sedation. Due to the risk of organ (especially renal) toxicity, methoxyflurane is contraindicated in patients with pre-existing kidney disease or diabetes mellitus, and is not recommended to be administered in conjunction with tetracyclines or other potentially nephrotoxic or enzyme-inducing drugs.|$|E
5|$|Electrical {{stimulation}} of the dorsal columns of the spinal cord can produce <b>analgesia.</b> First, the leads are implanted, guided by fluoroscopy and feedback from the patient, and the generator is worn externally for several days to assess efficacy. If pain is reduced by more than half, the therapy is deemed to be suitable. A small pocket is cut into the tissue beneath {{the skin of the}} upper buttocks, chest wall or abdomen and the leads are threaded under the skin from the stimulation site to the pocket, where they are attached to the snugly fitting generator. It seems to be more helpful with neuropathic and ischemic pain than nociceptive pain, but current evidence is too weak to recommend its use in the treatment of cancer pain.|$|E
5|$|The French Spaniel (Epagneul Français) is a {{breed of}} dog of the Spaniel-like setter. It was {{developed}} in France and Canada as a hunting dog, descended from dogs of the 14th century. Popular with royalty during the Middle Ages, it nearly became extinct {{by the turn of}} the 20th century but was saved by the efforts of Father Fournier, a French priest. One of the largest breeds of Spaniel, it typically has a white coat with brown markings. It is a friendly breed that has few health issues, but can be affected by a syndrome called acral mutilation and <b>analgesia.</b> The breed is recognised by Canadian and international kennel clubs but not by The Kennel Club (UK). The American Kennel Club has included the breed in its Foundation Stock Service, the first step to full recognition.|$|E
5|$|The breed is robustly healthy {{with few}} issues and adapts well to wet weather conditions. A {{dermatological}} condition known as acral mutilation and <b>analgesia</b> may affect French Spaniels. It is a newly recognised disorder, with symptoms becoming apparent {{between three and}} a half months and a year of age. It was first reported in thirteen dogs in Canada and shares symptoms with the acral mutilation syndromes of the German Shorthaired Pointer, English Pointer and English Springer Spaniels. Dogs who are affected will lick, bite and mutilate their extremities resulting in ulcers with secondary bacterial infections. Self amputation of claws, digits and footpads can happen in extreme cases. The majority of the initial dogs identified were euthanised within days to months of being diagnosed.|$|E
5|$|The {{circumcision}} procedure causes pain, and for neonates {{this pain}} {{may interfere with}} mother-infant interaction or cause other behavioral changes, so the use of <b>analgesia</b> is advocated. Ordinary procedural pain may be managed in pharmacological and non-pharmacological ways. Pharmacological methods, such as localized or regional pain-blocking injections and topical analgesic creams, are safe and effective. The ring block and dorsal penile nerve block (DPNB) are the most effective at reducing pain, and the ring block {{may be more effective}} than the DPNB. They are more effective than EMLA (eutectic mixture of local anesthetics) cream, which is more effective than a placebo. Topical creams have been found to irritate the skin of low birth weight infants, so penile nerve block techniques are recommended in this group.|$|E
5|$|The {{obligation}} {{of a professional}} medical care provider to alleviate suffering may occasionally come into conflict with the obligation to prolong life. If a terminally ill person prefers to be painless, despite {{a high level of}} sedation and a risk of shortening their life, they should be provided with their desired pain relief (despite the cost of sedation and a possibly slightly shorter life). Where a person is unable to be involved in this type of decision, the law and the medical profession in the United Kingdom allow the doctor to assume that the person would prefer to be painless, and thus the provider may prescribe and administer adequate <b>analgesia,</b> even if the treatment may slightly hasten death. It is taken that the underlying cause of death in this case is the illness and not the necessary pain management.|$|E
5|$|Treatment {{is based}} on the {{severity}} of the bite; the majority of cases do not require medical care and patients with localised pain, swelling and redness usually only require local application of ice and routine analgesics. Hospital assessment is recommended if simple <b>analgesia</b> does not resolve local pain or clinical features of systemic envenoming occur. In more severe bites, Redback antivenom can be given. Redback antivenom can also cross-neutralise katipo venom, and it is used to treat envenoming from Latrodectus katipo in New Zealand. It is available from most major New Zealand hospitals. Antivenom will usually relieve symptoms of systemic envenoming and is indicated in anyone suffering symptoms consistent with Latrodectus envenoming. Unlike some other antivenoms, it is not limited to patients with signs of severe, systemic envenoming. Particular indications for using antivenom are local then generalised pain, sweating or hypertension. However, good evidence to support the effectiveness of widow spider antivenoms is lacking and studies have cast some doubt on antivenoms efficacy in latrodectism. Pain relief agents, such as parenteral opiates, or benzodiazepines may be required as adjunct agents.|$|E
25|$|Nalbuphine is {{indicated}} for {{the relief of}} moderate to severe pain. It {{can also be used}} as a supplement to balanced anesthesia, for preoperative and postoperative <b>analgesia,</b> and for obstetrical <b>analgesia</b> during labor and delivery.|$|E
25|$|Morphine is a {{phenanthrene}} {{opioid receptor}} agonist– its main effect is binding to and activating the μ-opioid receptors {{in the central}} nervous system. Its intrinsic activity at the μ-opioid is heavily dependent on the assay and tissue being tested; in some situations it is a full agonist while in others {{it can be a}} partial agonist or even antagonist. In clinical settings, morphine exerts its principal pharmacological effect on the central nervous system and gastrointestinal tract. Its primary actions of therapeutic value are <b>analgesia</b> and sedation. Activation of the μ-opioid receptors is associated with <b>analgesia,</b> sedation, euphoria, physical dependence, and respiratory depression. Morphine is also a κ-opioid and δ-opioid receptor agonist, κ-opioid's action is associated with spinal <b>analgesia,</b> miosis (pinpoint pupils) and psychotomimetic effects. δ-Opioid is thought {{to play a role in}} <b>analgesia.</b> Although morphine does not bind to the σ-receptor, it has been shown that σ-agonists, such as (+)-pentazocine, inhibit morphine <b>analgesia,</b> and σ-antagonists enhance morphine <b>analgesia,</b> suggesting downstream involvement of the σ-receptor in the actions of morphine.|$|E
25|$|Fentanyl is {{sometimes}} given intrathecally {{as part of}} spinal anaesthesia or epidurally for epidural anaesthesia and <b>analgesia.</b> Because of fentanyl's high lipid solubility, its effects are more localized than morphine, and some clinicians prefer to use morphine to get a wider spread of <b>analgesia.</b>|$|E
25|$|When co-administered with morphine, {{tianeptine}} prevents morphine-induced {{respiratory depression}} without impairing <b>analgesia.</b>|$|E
25|$|Agmatine: Blocks NMDA receptors {{and other}} cation ligand-gated channels. Can also potentiate opioid <b>analgesia.</b>|$|E
25|$|It is also {{difficult}} to achieve acute opioid <b>analgesia</b> in persons using buprenorphine for opioid replacement therapy.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to anesthesia, <b>analgesia</b> is often managed by anesthesiologists or {{is included in}} the considerations for anesthesia.|$|E
25|$|An {{analgesic}} or painkiller is {{any member}} of the group of drugs used to achieve <b>analgesia,</b> relief from pain.|$|E
25|$|Respiratory stimulants: carotid {{chemoreceptor}} agonists (e.g. doxapram), 5-HT4 agonists (e.g. BIMU8), δ-opioid agonists (e.g. BW373U86) and AMPAkines (e.g. CX717) can all reduce {{respiratory depression}} caused by opioids without affecting <b>analgesia,</b> {{but most of}} these drugs are only moderately effective or have side effects which preclude use in humans. 5-HT1A agonists such as 8-OH-DPAT and repinotan also counteract opioid-induced respiratory depression, {{but at the same time}} reduce <b>analgesia,</b> which limits their usefulness for this application.|$|E
25|$|Health {{psychology}} {{attempts to}} find treatments to reduce or eliminate pain, as well as understand pain anomalies such as episodic <b>analgesia,</b> causalgia, neuralgia, and phantom limb pain. Although the task of measuring and describing pain has been problematic, {{the development of the}} McGill Pain Questionnaire has helped make progress in this area. Treatments for pain involve patient-administered <b>analgesia,</b> acupuncture (found to be effective in reducing pain for osteoarthritis of the knee), biofeedback, and cognitive behavior therapy.|$|E
25|$|Transdermal {{fentanyl}} {{has also}} been used {{for many years in}} dogs and cats for post-operative <b>analgesia.</b> This is usually done with off-label fentanyl patches manufactured for humans with chronic pain. In 2012 a highly concentrated (50mg/ml) transdermal solution, trade name Recuvyra, has become commercially available for dogs only. It is FDA approved to provide four days of <b>analgesia</b> after a single application prior to surgery. It is not approved for multiple doses or other species. The drug is also approved in Europe.|$|E
25|$|Antagonism of the NMDA {{receptor}} {{is thought}} to be responsible for the anesthetic, amnesic, dissociative, and hallucinogenic effects of ketamine. The mechanism(s) of action for the antidepressant effects of ketamine at lower doses have yet to be fully elucidated. NMDA receptor antagonism results in <b>analgesia</b> by preventing central sensitization in dorsal horn neurons; in other words, ketamine's actions interfere with pain transmission in the spinal cord. Inhibition of nitric oxide synthase lowers the production of nitric oxide – a gasotransmitter involved in pain perception, hence further contributing to <b>analgesia.</b>|$|E
25|$|Topical anesthesia: {{local anesthetics}} that are {{specially}} formulated to diffuse through the mucous membranes or skin {{to give a}} thin layer of <b>analgesia</b> to an area (e.g. EMLA patches).|$|E
25|$|Vasoconstrictors {{are present}} in most local anesthetics, and are {{intended}} to increase the length of <b>analgesia</b> by reducing blood supply to the region which reduces the amount of local anesthetic solution that is absorbed into the circulation and carried from the local tissues. Hence, use of local anesthetics with vasoconstrictors is {{associated with an increased}} risk of dry socket occurring. However, frequently use of local anesthetic without vasoconstrictors would not provide sufficient <b>analgesia,</b> especially in the presence of acute pain and infection, meaning that the total dose of local anesthetic may need to be increased. Adequate pain control during the extraction is balanced against an increased risk of dry socket.|$|E
25|$|Dextromethorphan {{has been}} noted to slow the {{development}} of tolerance to opioids and exert additional <b>analgesia</b> by acting upon the NMDA receptors; some analgesics such as methadone and ketobemidone and perhaps piritramide have intrinsic NMDA action.|$|E
25|$|In Europe, the European College of Veterinary Anaesthesia and <b>Analgesia</b> (ECVAA) {{is one of}} 23 {{specialty}} organizations {{recognized by}} the European Board of Veterinary Specialisation. As of February 2014, there are 147 ECVA Diplomates.|$|E
25|$|Morphine is used {{primarily}} to treat both acute and chronic severe pain. It {{is also used}} for pain due to myocardial infarction and for labor pains. Its duration of <b>analgesia</b> is about three to seven hours.|$|E
25|$|Chlorpromazine is {{occasionally}} used off-label {{for treatment}} of severe migraine. It is often, particularly as palliation, used in small doses to reduce nausea suffered by opioid-treated cancer patients and to intensify and prolong the <b>analgesia</b> of the opioids as well.|$|E
25|$|This, {{coupled with}} a concern that use of opiates would lead to addiction, and {{the time and effort}} needed to provide {{adequate}} <b>analgesia</b> to the newborn, contributed to the medical profession's continued practice of not providing pain relief for babies.|$|E
25|$|Although {{buprenorphine}} is {{a partial}} agonist of the MOR, human {{studies have found}} that it acts like a full agonist with respect to <b>analgesia.</b> Conversely, buprenorphine behaves like a partial agonist of the MOR with respect to respiratory depression.|$|E
25|$|Functional imaging upon placebo <b>analgesia</b> {{shows that}} it links to the activation, and {{increased}} functional correlation between this activation, in the anterior cingulate, prefrontal, orbitofrontal and insular cortices, nucleus accumbens, amygdala, the brainstem periaqueductal gray matter, and the spinal cord.|$|E
