(APIH) was {{established}} in 1994 to offer credentialing to <b>industrial</b> <b>hygienists</b> who meet the education and experience requirements found in Tennessee Code Annotated, Title 62, Chapter 40.

The APIH Registration Committee investigates and verifies, through electronic means or correspondence, both educational and experience accomplishments claimed by each applicant for registration. The Committee determines the appropriate level of registration, Registered <b>Industrial</b> <b>Hygienist</b> or Registered Professional <b>Industrial</b> <b>Hygienist,</b> and then authorizes the registration certificate to be issued.|$|R

50|$|The American Conference of Government <b>Industrial</b> <b>Hygienists</b> (ACGIH) is a member-based {{organization}} of <b>industrial</b> <b>hygienists</b> and {{individuals in the}} occupational and environmental health and safety industry. They recommend an airborne exposure limit of 0.05ppm for heavy work, 0.08ppm for moderate work, and 0.1ppm for light work. If work is done for {{less than two hours}} the ACGIH recommends an exposure airborne limit of 0.20pmm averaged over an 8-hour work shift. It {{is important to note that}} engineering controls are the most effective way of reducing airborne exposure of ozone (unless the exposure is the result of chemical use, in which exposure can possibly be reduced by substituting a less hazardous chemical). These controls include proper ventilation systems, proper respirators and protective clothing.|$|R

The AIHA joined with the American Conference of Governmental <b>Industrial</b> <b>Hygienist</b> (ACGIH) in 1961 to sponsor an annual industrial hygiene conference. Despite concerns of the recent split with the AAIPS, the first conference was a success as all exhibit spaces were sold out, scientific exhibits were so numerous that they had to be placed in the halls and 688 <b>industrial</b> <b>hygienists</b> attended the meeting held in Detroit, Michigan.|$|R
