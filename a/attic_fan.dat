50|$|Because an <b>attic</b> <b>fan</b> {{is made of}} metal, and is also {{subject to}} {{lightning}} strikes if mounted on a roof, grounding is extremely important. On some attic fans, grounding is achieved through a screw mounted on the thermostat box of the <b>attic</b> <b>fan.</b> The grounding wire {{is attached to the}} box via the screw and thereby grounds the external metal components. Most modern attic fans have this as well as a grounding wire connected directly to the motor, thereby ensuring all parts are grounded.|$|E
5000|$|A powered attic ventilator, or <b>attic</b> <b>fan,</b> is a {{ventilation}} fan which regulates the heat {{level of a}} building's attic by exhausting hot air. A thermostat is used to automatically turn the fan off and on, while sometimes a manual switch is used. An <b>attic</b> <b>fan</b> can be gable mounted or roof mounted. Additional vents are required to draw in fresh air as the hot air is exhausted. Attic fans are typically used in warmer months, when temperatures in an attic can exceed [...] A fan may be installed in an attic for the different purpose of cooling a whole house, venting hot air out via the attic; such fans are often called whole-house fans.|$|E
50|$|A typical roof-mounted solar <b>attic</b> <b>fan</b> will be {{effective}} in removing excessive heat from the attic. When mounted near the peak the solar fan forces hot air out while pulling fresh air in via eave/soffit vents. This exchange of air keeps the attic space from overheating.|$|E
50|$|Texas Distributors {{concentrated}} on repair work early on—there {{was nothing to}} distribute at the time because Texas Distributors {{did not yet have}} a distribution agreement with a manufacturer and because none of the manufacturers had changed over from war production. TD’s first employees repaired or installed various heating and cooling systems, including refrigerators, ice cream freezers, water fountains, and <b>attic</b> <b>fans.</b>|$|R
5000|$|<b>Attic</b> <b>fans</b> may be wired several {{different}} ways. Usually the fan is hardwired directly into an electric circuit, and {{is controlled by}} a thermostat most commonly ranging from [...] to [...] It may also be hardwired but controlled by a switch. Another popular method {{is to have the}} fan plugged into an electric socket mounted nearby. An environmentally friendly method is to wire a specialized fan to a roof-mounted solar panel.|$|R
40|$|A {{properly}} sized {{whole house}} fan {{is designed to}} pull large quantities of outside air through screened windows and doors and push it through the attic. When there is insufficient clearance in attic exhaust areas, the whole house fan can be installed to exhaust directly outside through the wall. Maximum benefit is obtained when the fan exhausts through the attic because it cools both the attic and the occupants. This differs from <b>attic</b> <b>fans</b> which are designed to cool the attic only and are not cost effective if the attic is well insulated. (See Figur...|$|R
50|$|In the {{possible}} {{event of a}} fire, an operating <b>attic</b> <b>fan</b> could, in theory, spread the flames because of the air movement. To reduce the danger, louvered vents that allow air to pass through can incorporate fusible links so that fire will melt the links {{in which case the}} vent will automatically close. In addition, an automatic cutoff switch can be set up to turn off power to the fan if it detects a temperature above a preset limit.|$|E
50|$|Though every {{situation}} is different, {{there is some}} controversy {{about the effectiveness of}} attic fans. It has been theorized that in some cases the negative pressure that an <b>attic</b> <b>fan</b> produces in the attic can cause conditioned air from living spaces to be pulled into the attic through cracks and lighting fixtures. This loss of conditioned air can negate the energy conservation gains that might be expected from forced cooling of the attic with a fan.|$|E
50|$|There is a terra-cotta string {{course with}} four crests between the floors {{on the east}} side. On {{the second floor of}} the east side, the end bays have modern paired windows and the center bay has one paired and one single metal window of 1975. There are three gabled dormers each with copper louvers instead of windows. The roof is covered with red Spanish tile. The south side windows have been {{replaced}} by glass blocks while the original double board door remains in the center. The north and present front elevation on Calle Union is a gable end and is three bays wide on the first floor, two bays upstairs. Above the filled-in <b>attic</b> <b>fan</b> window, on either end is a standard for a flagpole.|$|E
25|$|The {{illustration}} is {{the interior}} of a common two wire heat-only household thermostat, used to regulate a gas-fired heater via an electric gas valve. Similar mechanisms may also be used to control oil furnaces, boilers, boiler zone valves, electric <b>attic</b> <b>fans,</b> electric furnaces, electric baseboard heaters, and household appliances such as refrigerators, coffee pots and hair dryers. The power through the thermostat is provided by the heating device and may range from millivolts to 240 volts in common North American construction, and is used to control the heating system either directly (electric baseboard heaters and some electric furnaces) or indirectly (all gas, oil and forced hot water systems). Due to the variety of possible voltages and currents available at the thermostat, caution must be taken when selecting a replacement device.|$|R
50|$|It {{is similar}} to the roof mounted solar fan, except that its {{installation}} is a little different. Most <b>attic</b> <b>fans</b> are installed on the roof surface, whereas gable fans are installed in the gables, inside the attic and behind an existing louvered gable vent as the name suggests. They are mostly installed in places like garages or barns and other storage places where heat and moisture are usually present. These types of fans are generally installed behind intake grills to provide ventilation. Gable Solar Fans are usually installed high on the gable close to the ridge and are also coupled with soffit or roof vents for well-balanced intake and exhaust air avenues. The airflow depends upon the level of sunlight when there is more sunlight, the airflow will be more resulting in enhanced cooling. It is also capable of lowering the air conditioning costs by cooling the attic.|$|R
40|$|Controlling summer attic {{heat gain}} is {{important}} to reducing air conditioning energy use in homes in hot-humid climates. Both heat transfer through ceilings and t attic duct systems can make up {{a large part of}} peak cooling demand, Attic ventilation has long been identified as a method to abate such heat gains. We present test results from using the photovoltaic (PV) <b>attic</b> ventilator <b>fans</b> in a test home to assess impact on attic and cooling energy performance...|$|R
50|$|Attic heat {{is caused}} by the sun baking down on the roof surface. This {{sunlight}} causes the roofing material to heat up, thus transferring the heat into the attic via thermal transfer. The buildup of heat is generally dissipated by normal convection, i.e.: as the air is heated it expands and rises, flowing out of the attic through vents placed at or near the peak, while fresh air is pulled into the attic from intake vents that are generally in the eave (soffit) area. However, most roof vents are inadequate at expelling the heat and require the use of a powered vent fan to remove heat effectively. A solar powered <b>attic</b> <b>fan</b> is an effective way to remove attic heat using only the power of the sun to run the fan.|$|E
50|$|Riverview {{was finally}} {{completed}} in 1872. Riverview {{is a classic}} example of Italianate architecture with arched windows, deep eaves with ornamental brackets, and a cupola. The two parlors have painted ceilings. Atwood and Juliet Hobson incorporated some unusually unique ideas for their era into this home. A copper-lined wooden collection tank in the attic, which was connected to the outside guttering, provided running water for the water closet on the second floor. Another innovation beneath the cupola is a hole in the ceiling, sometimes called an oculus, and is part of the ventilation system of the house. When the eight windows in the observatory are open and the windows and doors are open on the floors below, a vacuum is created, pulling the hot air up and out of the house, keeping the air continuously circulating. It works much as an <b>attic</b> <b>fan</b> would work in a home today.|$|E
40|$|To provide {{additional}} validation {{data for the}} multizone airflow and contaminant modeling approach (i. e., as implemented in the CONTAMW simulation program), a series of tracer gas tests were performed in an occupied three-story townhouse in Reston, Va. Tests simulated with CONTAMW consisted of short-term release of 1500 mL of tracer gas, sulfur hexaflouride (SF 6), within one room {{of the house and}} the measurement of SF 6 concentration in 10 indoor locations. In four of the ten main test cases, the heating and air-conditioning system fan was operating. In an eleventh test case, an <b>attic</b> <b>fan</b> was operating. The location of the burst source of tracer gas included the recreation room (basement level), the kitchen/dining room (main level) and the master bedroom (upstairs level). Experiments were conducted between May 2000 and June 2001. Local ambient conditions that ranged from a low outdoor temperature of 5 °C to a high of 29 °C and wind conditions that ranged from calm to moderate, with an average wind speed of 4 m/s, were measured and used as model inputs. A statistical comparison of measurements and predictions was performed per ASTM Guid...|$|E

40|$|This {{book has}} been {{published}} by the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), the US trade association of the solar thermal, photovoltaic, and passive solar manufacturers, distributors, and component suppliers. Its purpose is to help architects, builders, and developers construct energy-efficient homes in hot humid climates like the Pacific Rim Countries, and to allow occupants of these homes to enjoy enhanced comfort without reliance on mechanical air-conditioning systems. Two important factors are addressed in this book. First, {{the past few years}} have seen a tremendous increase in practical applications of new research. The current popularity of ceiling paddle <b>fans,</b> <b>attic</b> radiant barriers and natural daylighting attest to the importance of keeping up with the latest concepts in energy-reduction and comfort-awareness. Professionals {{who have been in the}} field for the past few years may be unaware of the latest research findings [...] some of which dramatically alter prior thinking on such subjects as natural ventilation or mechanical air conditioning. The second factor is the importance of site-specific characteristics, which greatly affect building strategies and designs. A thorough understanding of the climate is a prerequisite to good building design. Such factors as temperature, humidity, wind speed and direction, and solar radiation must be understood and properly integrated into the design for the home to be truly energy-efficient...|$|R
