40|$|The Speech Interference Level 3 H (LSIL) {{is widely}} used for the {{evaluation}} of the acoustic comfort aboard jet-engine aircrafts. The aim {{of this study is to}} explore the potential of LSIL to represent the acoustic annoyance of sounds inside aircraft cabins and to compare its performance to LAeq and loudness. In a listening test, 21 untrained listeners had to rate the annoyance of 15 real noise samples. The ratings are mapped to a relative <b>annoyance</b> <b>scale</b> and compared to the corresponding LSIL, LAeq and loudness values. The results show that LSIL does not represent annoyance. LSIL yields a correlation of only 0. 58, while LAeq and loudness yield correlations of 0. 8 and 0. 93, respectively. Therefore, loudness seems to be a useful parameter for evaluating the acoustic comfort in aircraft cabins...|$|E
40|$|The Noise Sensitivity Scale Short Form (NSS-SF), {{developed}} in English {{as a more}} practical form of the classical Weinstein NSS, has not to date been validated in other cultures, and its validity and reliability {{have not yet been}} confirmed. This study aimed to validate NSS-SF in Bulgarian and to demonstrate its applicability. The study comprised test-retest (n = 115) and a field-testing (n = 71) of the newly validated scale. Its construct validity was examined with confirmatory factor analysis, and very good model-fit was observed. Temporal stability was assessed in a test-retest (r = 0. 990), convergent validity was examined with single-item susceptibility to the noise scale (r = 0. 906) and discriminant validity was confirmed with single-item noise <b>annoyance</b> <b>scale</b> (r = 0. 718). The lowest observed McDonald′s omega across the studies was 0. 923. The cross-cultural validation of NSS-SF was successful but it proved to be somewhat problematic with respect to its annoyance-based items...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to produce an internationally {{comparable}} social survey {{for the study of}} the annoyance due to vibration and noise in residential environments in Chinese. The challenges that China will face in terms of noise and vibration annoyance in the process of urbanization will be no different to the challenges that other urbanizing/urbanized countries face today. Similar challenges are being encountered in other Chinese speaking countries, such as Hong Kong, Macau, Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia. Internationally standardized <b>annoyance</b> <b>scales</b> are required to compare community responses to environmental noise and vibration measured in various linguistic regions. ICBEN Team 6 organized an international joint study to establish standardized noise <b>annoyance</b> <b>scales</b> and has developed scales and questions in nine linguistic regions. Yano applied the method to construct <b>annoyance</b> <b>scales</b> in Chinese, Korean and Vietnamese. This work extends the ICBEN work to construct <b>annoyance</b> <b>scales</b> in both Chinese and Simplified Chinese for exposure to environmental vibration. Further, a social survey is produced in both Chinese and Simplified Chinese by translating the questionnaire used in the Defra NANR 209 project ‘Human Response to Vibration in Residential Environments’, a national survey in the United Kingdom which produced exposure-response relationships for vibration and annoyance. The translated versions of both the survey and the core reporting information are here reviewed by a focus group and the feedback from the group presented together with recommendations for improvement and further work. It is concluded that an internationally comparable instrument for the collection of robust and reliable data to investigate public annoyance in relation to environmental vibration of Chinese speaking communities has been successfully drafted and is ready for pilot study...|$|R

Then findings from a psychometric study are presented {{which can be}} utilized to refine rating scale construction. 1 The issue: Quantifying annoyance In social-scientific research {{on the effects of}} noise, annoyance due to noise exposure is one of the core topics. Virtually all studies, whether lab experiments or population surveys, employ scales to measure this construct. Two main types of <b>annoyance</b> <b>scales</b> are: direct scaling, i. e., the respondent expresses her/his degree of annoyance (or disturbance, apprehension, irritation etc) on an accordingly anchored and labeled scale; and scaling via statements, i. e., the respondent assesses to which extent s/he experiences particular described noise effects (usually as intensity or frequency).

40|$|The {{environmental}} standards for noise annoyance are {{set on the}} basis of exposure-response relation between noise level and degree of response for various noises. The authors have continued the joint study to achieve the followings with ICBEN (International Commission on Biological Effect of Noise) Team 6 (Community Response to Noise) since 1993. The aim to this study is to facilitate the comparison of the result. So, we set guideline to the mentioned items in our report in order to construct the international standardized noise <b>annoyance</b> <b>scale</b> and make a comparative study of them.

40|$|A {{test was}} {{conducted}} to investigate how people describe HVAC 2 ̆ 6 R equipment noise. Twenty-eight recordings and modified recordings were played to 42 subjects who wrote down descriptions as they heard the sounds. Subjects also rated these and 12 other sounds on an <b>annoyance</b> <b>scale.</b> The words used by subjects were categorized into 9 groups and the occurrences of the words within a group were counted for each sound. The results of the word analysis were compared to results of a sound quality metric analysis of the sounds, and {{to the results of}} the annoyance test. There was a high degree of correlation between the word scores and the corresponding metric values. The performance of linear models of metrics as predictors of annoyance was examined and loudness was the strongest contributor because of the large range of loudness used in the test. There were two significant outliers to the general trend of the predictions; these were sounds that were described by subjects as “sharp” and “high pitched”. The results of this test are being used in the design of a semantic differential test {{to examine the relationship between}} sound characteristics and annoyance further...|$|E
40|$|On {{the basis}} of {{findings}} from recent surveys, discussion has been raised {{as to whether the}} annoyance of residents at a given aircraft noise exposure level has increased over the years. To verify the hypothesized trend and to identify its possible causes, the large database used to establish earlier exposure-response relationships was updated with original data from several recent cross-sectional surveys. On {{the basis of}} these original data, it was investigated whether characteristics of the study can explain the heterogeneity between airports. A significant increase over the years was observed in annoyance at a given level of aircraft noise exposure. Furthermore, the type of <b>annoyance</b> <b>scale</b> used, the type of contact with respondents and the response percentage were found to be sources of heterogeneity. Of these only the scale factor could statistically account for the year effect, but other research findings seem to rule this out as a satisfactory explanation. Other possible explanations for the year effect, such as the higher rate of expansion of airports in recent years or changes in acoustical characteristics, could neither be confirmed nor ruled out. The results will be discussed in the light of recent findings from the ANASE study and the HYENA study, and the implications for exposure-response relationships for aircraft noise annoyance...|$|E

40|$|Annoyance {{expressed}} in a railway noise survey is compared with that from two road traffic and three aircraft surveys {{in order to determine}} whether responses to various types of environmental noise are source-specific. Railway noise is found to be less annoying than other noises at any given high noise level. Railway noise annoyance rises less rapidly with increasing noise level. At high levels, this gap in reactions averages about 10 dB; it ranges from 4 dB to more than 20 dB. The methods used for comparing the surveys are examined. It is found that methodological uncertainties lead to imprecise comparisons and that different <b>annoyance</b> <b>scales</b> yield different estimates of intersurvey differences...|$|R
40|$|Recently, it {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the annoyance of residents at a given aircraft noise exposure level increases over the years. The objective of the present study was to verify the hypothesized trend and to identify its possible causes. To this end, the large database used to establish earlier exposure-response relationships on aircraft noise was updated with original data from several recent surveys, yielding a database with data from 34 separate airports. Multilevel grouped regression was used to determine the annoyance response per airport, after which meta-regression was used to investigate whether study characteristics could explain the heterogeneity in annoyance response between airports. A significant increase over the years was observed in annoyance at a given level of aircraft noise exposure. Furthermore, the type of <b>annoyance</b> <b>scale,</b> the type of contact, and the response percentage were found to be sources of heterogeneity. Of these, only the scale factor could statistically account for the trend, although other findings rule it out as a satisfactory explanation. No evidence was found for increased self-reported noise sensitivity. The results are of importance to the applicability of current exposure-annoyance relationships for aircraft noise and provide a basis for decisions on whether these need to be updated. © 2011 Acoustical Society of America...|$|E
40|$|The type {{of noise}} <b>annoyance</b> <b>scale</b> and aspects of its {{presentation}} such as response format or location within a questionnaire and other contextual factors may affect self-reported noise annoyance. By means of a balanced experimental design, the effect of type of annoyance question and corresponding scale (5 -point verbal vs. 11 -point numerical ICBEN (International Commission on Biological Effects of Noise) scale), presentation order of scale points (ascending vs. descending), question location (early vs. late within the questionnaire), and survey season (autumn vs. spring) on reported road traffic noise annoyance was investigated in a postal survey with a stratified random sample of 2386 Swiss residents. Our results showed that early appearance of annoyance questions {{was significantly associated with}} higher annoyance scores. Questionnaires filled out in autumn were associated with a significantly higher annoyance rating than in the springtime. No effect was found for the order of response alternatives. Standardized average annoyance scores were slightly higher using the 11 -point numerical scale whereas the percentage of highly annoyed respondents was higher based on the 5 -point scale, using common cutoff points. In conclusion, placement and presentation of annoyance questions within a questionnaire, as well as the time of the year a survey is carried out, have small but demonstrable effects on the degree of self-reported noise annoyance...|$|E

40|$|A method {{established}} by ICBEN (International Commission on the Biological Effects of Noise) Team 6 (Community Response to Noise) {{has been used}} to develop equivalent noise <b>annoyance</b> <b>scales</b> in nine languages. A key assumption of this method is that subjects who speak different languages interpret the concept of “highest degree” of annoyance similarly. In this study, an experiment was conducted using 73 bilingual subjects to test this assumption and thereby assess the equivalence of the Japanese and English ICBEN scales. All of the bilingual subjects followed a slightly modified version of the ICBEN method to produce scales in both Japanese and English. The results indicate that English- and Japanese-speaking subjects do not differ significantly in their interpretations of the “highest degree” of annoyance. Thus, a key premise of the ICBEN method for producing equivalent scales in different languages was confirmed for English and Japanese. In addition, although the Japanese modifier “hijoni” has frequently been translated as “very,” {{the results of this study}} show that “extremely” is a more appropriate translation. Finally, evidence was found that bilingual subjects may differ significantly from monolingual subjects in their interpretations of certain words...|$|R

The difficulty of predicting noise effects was emphasized. Arousal theory was considered to have explanatory value in interpreting the findings of all the studies. Performance under noise was found to involve a psychophysiological cost, measured by vasoconstriction response, with the degree of response cost being related to scores on a noise <b>annoyance</b> sensitivity <b>scale.</b> Noise sensitive subjects showed a greater autonomic response under noise stimulation...|$|R
50|$|Various reasons {{exist for}} why one finds {{particular}} stimuli annoying. Measurement of annoyance is highly subjective. As {{an attempt at}} measurement, psychological studies on annoyance often rely on their subjects' own ratings of levels of <b>annoyance</b> on a <b>scale.</b> Any kind of stimuli can cause annoyance, such as getting poked in the side or listening to a song repeatedly. Many stimuli that one is at first neutral to, or even finds pleasant, can turn into annoyances from repeated continued exposure. One can often encounter this phenomenon with such media as popular music, memes, commercials, and advertising jingles, which {{by their very nature}} are continually repeated over a period of weeks or months.|$|R
40|$|The annoyance-reaction {{is one of}} {{the central}} {{variables}} in noise research. After an introduction to different concepts and definitions of noise <b>annoyance</b> different <b>scales</b> of how noise annoyance can be measured are shown. The question is discussed whether disturbance effects of noise at different times of day are given. To clarify this problem, the results of a series of actual German noise studies are reported. In these studies differences between day- and night-time annoyance are found depending on the sound sources. For the case of road traffic noise no differences between day and night-time annoyance were found. In contrast, annoyance reactions are related to the time of day for railway and air traffic noise. Especially for aircraft noise, above a Leq of 50 dB(A) night-time annoyance rises faster than day-time annoyance. The effects are discussed in the frame of a cognitive model of noise annoyance. It is argued that annoyance judgements are based on an internal representation of the noise situation. Part of this representation are the event characteristics of the sound sources and their estimated impacts for disturbances at different times of day...|$|R
40|$|Traffic noise causes {{annoyance}} {{and sleep}} disturbance {{and has been}} linked with several other adverse effects on life quality and health, including increased risk of hypertension and myocardial infarction. Conservative estimates assume {{that at least one}} million healthy life years are lost every year from traffic related noise {{in the western part of}} Europe. We know from earlier studies that the adverse effects of environmental noise may be modified by social, demographic and individual factors. However, there is a need to better evaluate exposure-response in susceptible groups. The aim of this thesis was to test a number of factors hypothesised to modify the association between road traffic noise, annoyance and cardiovascular disease. Paper I-III are cross-sectional, while paper IV is a cohort study. The four different study populations in this thesis were selected through stratified random sampling of men and women aged 18 - 80 years old in the county of Skåne and its major city Malmö in southern Sweden. Exposures of road traffic and railway noise as well as air pollution were modelled using geographic information system (GIS) for the survey participants’ residential addresses. Possible confounding and modifying factors were mainly drawn from survey responses while outcomes were based on both self-reporting and inpatient registers. We were not able to show a relation between current and medium-term noise exposure to road traffic noise and incident myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease in the general population. Air-pollution at low levels did not modify this effect. An association was however found between road traffic noise and hypertension in a cross-sectional study > 60 dB(A). We also found strong and positive relations between road traffic noise and annoyance. Railway noise was found to be less annoying at intermediate levels, but not > 55 dB(A). Access to quiet side had a protective effect and decreased the risk of annoyance, sleep and concentration problems equal to a 5 dB(A) decrease in noise exposure. Generally middle-aged persons were found to be more susceptible to noise. Higher socioeconomic status and educational level were related to noise annoyance. With regard to sex, findings were less consistent. We also found that results in our studies might be biased due to selective participation, that noise sensitive individuals were likely to have a higher response rate and that inter-study comparison may be difficult since different <b>annoyance</b> <b>scales</b> can produce very different results. In conclusion, the health effects of noise are modified by noise source, co-exposures, environmental and socio-demographic factors (as well as personal traits) and research methodology. To develop better policies for residential noise environment, future research should focus on combined exposures and stressors as well as further explaining age differences and developing better ways to account for social class...|$|R

The aim {{of the present study}} was to determine anxiety levels associated with noise in a dental clinic. The study was done using a survey questionnaire containing 10 questions and was divided into two parts. The first part included demographic information such as name, age, gender, and school; the second half included questions regarding patient′s feelings toward noise in the dental clinic and its possible link to dental anxiety. Two-hundred and fifty children and adolescents of age group 6 - 15 years participated in the study. Results of the study showed that 50 % of females, 29 % males avoided a visit to the dentist because of anxiety and fear, 38 % subjects of age group 6 - 11 years reported that sound of the drill makes them uncomfortable, followed by having to wait in the reception area. Gender gap was also observed with more females feeling annoyed than males on the 1 - 10 <b>annoyance</b> level <b>scale.</b> More than 60 % felt "annoyed" to "extremely annoyed" by noise in the dental clinic. 45 % of subjects preferred watching television to cope with such noise.

Using a questionnaire that yielded responses from 1112 randomly selected adult Finnish respondents, we estimated road-traffic noise- and exhausts-related perceived exposures, health-risk perceptions, and self-reported <b>annoyance</b> on five-point <b>scales,</b> while noise sensitivity estimates were based on four questions.

40|$|Tinnitus {{is defined}} as an {{acoustic}} perception of a sound without an external acoustic source. It is an otologic symptom affecting up to 20 % of the adult population. A cure of chronical tinnitus eliminating the acoustical perception has not been found yet. Tinnitus retraining therapy, aiming for habituation and long-term reduction of tinnitus-related psychosomatic and -social symptoms, turned out ot be an effective therapy, in classical {{as well as in}} modified form. Because of the lack of knowledge concerning long-term outcome of therapy-effects and differenciated indicators for therapy it was the intent of this study to evaluate the long-term effects of an one week ambulant, modified tinnitus retraining therapy at Charité University Hospital, Berlin as well as identifying predictive parameters for the therapy-effect. The data concerning this were collected from 130 patients using audiometric tests as well as socio-demographic und psychometric questionnaires, before, immediately after therapy and three years later. The changes during this follow-up period were evaluated descriptively and analytically. Immediately after the end of therapy, significant improvements concerning frequency and loudness of tinnitus-perception as well as tinnitus-associated <b>annoyance</b> (Visual Analog <b>Scale),</b> especially mental stress (Tinnitus Questionnaire according to Goebel and Hiller) were recognized. Furthermore significant increases in well-being (Berlin Mood Questionnaire) and overall life-quality (Anamnestic Comparative Self-Assessment) were registered as well as significant decreases in stress-perceiving (Perceived Stress Questionnaire) and depression (General Depression Scale). Post-therapy-investigation showed stability of the improved state, except a slight increase in depressive symptoms. The degree of subjectively felt <b>annoyance</b> (Visual Analog <b>Scale)</b> showed a significant progressive reduction. This could be due to an effective and long-term implementation of an aquired strategy of coping with every-day life. Out-patient aftercare is regarded important in improving the patients’ compliance and supporting them in stress or demanding situations. Patients younger than 50 years and those with a tinnitus-anamnesis of less than two years showed especially positive changes. Furthermore the initial degrees of stress and depression proved strong parameters of prediction: patients {{with a high level of}} disturbance showed significant improvement of their disorders. A higher level of improvement concerning tinnitus-related strain (Tinnitus Questionnaire) was found in patients with only slight hearing-loss. The results indicate the importance of training in coping with stress and psychotherapy as elements of therapy. Another relevant aspect regarding improvement of therapy-effectivity is the early diagnosis of hearing-loss and supplying patients with an adequate hearing-aid device. The well-proven therapy-suitability of patients with a short duration of symptoms could be of economical relevance through avoiding repeatet following treatments by an early und lasting intensive therapy. Overall the tinnitus intensive therapy carried out by the Charité proved to be a long-term effective method for the treatment of stressed patients with tinnitus. Catamnestic studies with follow-up intervals exceeding three years to investigate the long-term effectivity and influencing factors of the therapy are recommended...|$|R

40|$|Sufficient data {{refer to}} the {{relevant}} prevalence of sound exposure by mixed traffic sources in many nations. Furthermore, consideration of the potential effects of combined sound exposure is required in legal procedures such as environmental health impact assessments. Nevertheless, current practice still uses single exposure response functions. It is silently assumed that those standard exposure-response curves accommodate also for mixed exposures—although some evidence from experimental and field studies casts doubt on this practice. The ALPNAP-study population (N = 1641) shows sufficient subgroups with combinations of rail-highway, highway-main road and rail-highway-main road sound exposure. In this paper we apply a few suggested approaches of the literature to investigate exposure-response curves and its major determinants {{in the case of}} exposure to multiple traffic sources. Highly/moderate <b>annoyance</b> and full <b>scale</b> mean <b>annoyance</b> served as outcome. The results show several limitations of the current approaches. Even facing the inherent methodological limitations (energy equivalent summation of sound, rating of overall annoyance) the consideration of main contextual factors jointly occurring with the sources (such as vibration, air pollution) or coping activities and judgments of the wider area soundscape increases the variance explanation from up to 8 % (bivariate), up to 15 % (base adjustments) up to 55 % (full contextual model). The added predictors vary significantly, depending on the source combination. (e. g., significant vibration effects with main road/railway, not highway). Although no significant interactions were found, the observed additive effects are of public health importance. Especially {{in the case of a}} three source exposure situation the overall annoyance is already high at lower levels and the contribution of the acoustic indicators is small compared with the non-acoustic and contextual predictors. Noise mapping needs to go down to levels of 40 dBA,Lden to ensure the protection of quiet areas and prohibit the silent “filling up” of these areas with new sound sources. Eventually, to better predict the annoyance in the exposure range between 40 and 60 dBA and support the protection of quiet areas in city and rural areas in planning sound indicators need to be oriented at the noticeability of sound and consider other traffic related by-products (air quality, vibration, coping strain) in future studies and environmental impact assessments...|$|R
