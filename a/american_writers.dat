5|$|Many colonists, however, had {{developed}} a different conception of the empire. The colonies were not directly represented in Parliament, and colonists argued that Parliament {{had no right to}} levy taxes upon them. This tax dispute {{was part of a larger}} divergence between British and American interpretations of the British Constitution and the extent of Parliament's authority in the colonies. The orthodox British view, dating from the Glorious Revolution of 1688, was that Parliament was the supreme authority throughout the empire, and so, by definition, anything that Parliament did was constitutional. In the colonies, however, the idea {{had developed}} that the British Constitution recognized certain fundamental rights that no government could violate, not even Parliament. After the Townshend Acts, some essayists even began to question whether Parliament had any legitimate jurisdiction in the colonies at all. Anticipating the arrangement of the British Commonwealth, by 1774 <b>American</b> <b>writers</b> such as Samuel Adams, James Wilson, and Thomas Jefferson were arguing that Parliament was the legislature of Great Britain only, and that the colonies, which had their own legislatures, were connected to the rest of the empire only through their allegiance to the Crown.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} August, Simon & Schuster published Faithful, a {{book which}} collected e-mails about the Red Sox between <b>American</b> <b>writers</b> and Red Sox fans Stephen King and Stewart O'Nan during the 2004 season. In March 2005, Houghton Mifflin Company published Reversing the Curse, {{a book by}} Shaughnessy, author of the bestselling The Curse of the Bambino, chronicling the 2004 Red Sox season. ESPN's Bill Simmons published Now I Can Die In Peace, a collection of his columns with updated annotations and notes, including columns {{for each of the}} last four games of the ALCS and each World Series game – with Game 4 being a running diary. The Farrelly Brothers altered the ending of their 2005 film Fever Pitch – which includes appearances by Damon, Nixon and Varitek – to coincide with the actual end of the series. They and their crew, plus stars Drew Barrymore and Jimmy Fallon, flew to St. Louis and Barrymore and Fallon attended Game 4 in character, complete with the two of them running onto the field at Busch Stadium and kissing once the final out was made.|$|E
5|$|William Trotter Porter (December 24, 1809– July 19, 1858) was an American {{journalist}} and newspaper editor who founded an early American newspaper devoted to sports. After {{working at a}} number of small newspapers, Porter moved to New York City in the 1830s. After employment at a newspaper in the city, he founded the Spirit of the Times, a newspaper modeled on a London paper called Bell's Life in London. The Spirit, which went through a number of names and incarnations over the years, was devoted to sports and other recreational pursuits. One of Porter's main interests involved horse racing, and he was involved in attempts to create the first stud book in the United States, which did not bear fruit. He was also instrumental in the development of American literature, as the Spirit published a number of short stories by American tall tale writers, and Porter edited two collections of short stories by <b>American</b> <b>writers.</b> After publishing the Spirit through the 1830s, he sold it to another printer but continued as the editor into the 1850s. He left the original Spirit in 1855 and in 1856 was hired as editor for another sporting newspaper, Porter's Spirit of the Times, published by George Wilkes. Porter died in 1858.|$|E

5|$|Andrić {{was an avid}} {{reader in}} his youth. The young Andrić's {{literary}} interests varied greatly, ranging from the Greek and Latin Classics to the works of past and contemporary literary figures, including German and Austrian writers such as Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Heinrich Heine, Friedrich Nietzsche, Franz Kafka, Rainer Maria Rilke and Thomas Mann, French writers Michel de Montaigne, Blaise Pascal, Gustave Flaubert, Victor Hugo and Guy de Maupassant, and British writers Thomas Carlyle, Walter Scott and Joseph Conrad. Andrić also read the works of Miguel de Cervantes, Italian poet and philosopher Giacomo Leopardi, Russian writer Nikolay Chernyshevsky, Norwegian writer Henrik Ibsen, the <b>American</b> <b>writers</b> Walt Whitman and Henry James, and Czechoslovak philosopher Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk. Andrić was especially fond of Polish literature, and later stated that it had greatly influenced him. He held several Serb writers in high esteem, particularly Karadžić, Njegoš, Kočić and Aleksa Šantić. Andrić also admired the Slovene poets Fran Levstik, Josip Murn and Oton Župančič, and translated some of their works. Kafka appears {{to have had a}} significant influence on Andrić's prose, and his philosophical outlook was informed strongly by the works of Danish philosopher Søren Kierkegaard. At one point in his youth, Andrić even took an interest in Chinese and Japanese literature, which he read as French- and German-language translations.|$|E

25|$|The {{spelling}} whiskey {{is common}} in Ireland and the United States, while whisky is used in all other whisky producing countries. In the US, the usage {{has not always been}} consistent. From the late eighteenth century to the mid twentieth century, <b>American</b> <b>writers</b> used both spellings interchangeably until the introduction of newspaper style guides. Since the 1960s, <b>American</b> <b>writers</b> have increasingly used whiskey as the accepted spelling for aged grain spirits made in the US and whisky for aged grain spirits made outside the US. However, some prominent American brands, such as George Dickel, Maker's Mark, and Old Forester (all made by different companies), use the whisky spelling on their labels, and the Standards of Identity for Distilled Spirits, the legal regulations for spirit in the US, also use the whisky spelling throughout.|$|E
