50|$|The station {{opened in}} 1963; its total {{electrical}} capacity was 720 MW comprising six 120 MW generating units. A 120 MW Unit comprised a coal-fired (later oil-fired) boiler supplying high-pressure steam to a GEC three-cylinder reheat steam turbine, {{which in turn}} powered a hydrogen-cooled 120 MW alternator. Each unit had its own control room interposed between the boiler and turbine manned by a unit operator and an assistant unit operator. They in turn were assisted by two <b>auxiliary</b> <b>plant</b> attendants, one for the boiler, the other for the turbine plant. The electrical output of each unit, and therefore the station, was co-ordinated by a single load dispatch office who were in contact with grid control at East Grinstead. The electrical output of the station was routed by cables and overhead conductors to two grid sub stations, Northfleet East and Northfleet West, where the station fed the national grid. At full load each boiler consumed 50 tonnes of coal per hour, which was delivered by ship, first to a coal yard then to bunkers that fed cylindrical ball mills to create pulverised fuel, which was then blown into the boiler furnace. The steam conditions were 510 °C at 1500 psi. The design of this station can be considered the founding development of ever larger boiler / turbine units. As a coal-burning station, it was converted to burn oil in the early 1970s. The station closed in 1991.In 2000 the Government gave permission to Scottish and Southern Energy plc to build a 110 MW gas-fired {{combined heat and power}} station to supply the heat and electricity needs of the Kimberly-Clark paper mill at Northfleet.|$|E

Three different <b>auxiliary</b> <b>plant</b> technologies were compared to integration for 90 % capture from an existing, 500 MW supercritical coal plant. CO 2 capture and compression is simulated using Aspen Plus and a monoethylamine (MEA) absorption process. Thermoflow software is used to simulate three gas plant technologies. The three technologies assessed are the gas turbine (GT) with {{heat recovery steam generator}} (HRSG), gas turbine with HRSG and back pressure steam turbine, and natural gas boiler with back pressure steam turbine. The capital cost of the MEA unit is estimated using the Aspen Icarus Process Evaluator, and the capital cost of the external GT plants are estimated using the Thermoflow Plant Engineering and Cost Estimator. The gas turbine options are found to lead to electricity costs similar to integration, but their performance is highly sensitive to the price of natural gas and the economic impact of integration. Using a GT with a HRSG only has a lower capital cost but generates less excess electricity than the GT with HRSG and back pressure steam turbine. In order to generate enough steam for the reboiler, a significant amount of excess power was produced using both gas turbine configurations. This excess power could be attractive for coal plants located in regions with increasing electricity demand. An alternate capture plant scenario where a greater demand for power exists relative to steam is also considered. The economics of using <b>auxiliary</b> <b>plant</b> power improve slightly under this alternate energy profile scenario, but the most important factors affecting desirability of the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>plant</b> retrofit remain the cost of natural gas, the full cost of integration, and the potential for sale of excess electricity. by Sarah Bashadi.

Lignohumat B was applied to strawberries according to the manufacturer instructions: soaking the root system, watering after planting, spraying on the leaves two weeks before flowering and after flowering in 1 % concentration. Synergin® was applied before flowering by means of foliar sprayer and two weeks after flowering in the recommended dose of 3 l. ha− 1. In trial No. 1, the average yield for the two years 2007 and 2008 was 24. 69 t. ha− 1 for the ‘Honeoye’ cultivar and 35. 48 t. ha− 1 for ‘Symphony’.
