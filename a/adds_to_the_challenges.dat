40|$|It is {{well-known}} that the inherent complex nature of software systems <b>adds</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>challenges</b> of software development. The most notable techniques {{for addressing the}} complexity of software development {{are based on the}} principles of abstraction, problem decomposition, separation of concerns and automation. As an emerging paradigm for developing complex software, Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) realizes these principles by raising the specification of software to models, which are at a higher level of abstraction than source code. As models are elevated to first-class artifacts within the software development lifecycle, there is an increasing need for frequent model evolution to explore design alternatives and to address system adaptation issues. However, a system model often grows in size when representing a large-scale real-world system, which makes the task of evolving system models a manually intensive effort that can be very time consuming and error prone. Model transformation is a core activity of MDE, which converts one or more source models to one or more target models in order to change model structures or translate models to other software artifacts.

Tshwane University of Technology 2011 This {{research}} {{was carried out}} {{in the context of the}} government’s current efforts to integrate Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) in teaching and learning, in secondary schools which appears to be a major challenge. The study was exploratory and descriptive in nature where the problem that has not been clearly defined or understood was addressed. Activity theory underpinned the study because of its dynamic perspective. The essence of activity theory stems from a view of learning where individuals actively construct their understanding of the environment while engaging in goal-oriented activities. The findings show that while the South African government has made the commitment and efforts to integrate ICTs in schools, there is no logical and detailed strategy to support the usage of these ICTs in teaching and learning activities. For example, some schools do have the right technologies and infrastructure, but teachers and learners do not know how to use and adopt them appropriately.

40|$|Objective: Medical {{practitioners}} conceptualize {{depression in}} different ways, which <b>adds</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>challenges</b> of its diagnosis and treatment, {{as well as}} research in the palliative care setting. Psychiatric assessment is often considered the “gold standard” for diagnosis, therefore how psychiatrists conceptualize depression in this setting is pertinent. Our study aimed to investigate this issue. Method: Psychiatrists working in palliative care in Australia were individually interviewed using a semistructured approach. Nine participants were interviewed to reach data saturation. Interview transcripts were analyzed for themes. Results: Three overarching themes were identified: (1) depression means different things; (2) depression is conceptualized using different models; and (3) depression is the same concept within {{and outside of the}} palliative care setting. Participants explicitly articulated the heterogeneous nature of depression and described a different breadths of concepts, ranging from a narrow construct of a depressive illness to a broader one that encompassed depressive symptoms and emotions. However, depressive illness was a consistent concept, and participants considered this in terms of phenotypic subtypes. Participants used three models (spectral, dichotomous, and mixed) to relate various depressive presentations. Significance of Results: Psychiatrists did not subscribe to a unitary model of depression but understood it as a heterogeneous concept comprised of depressive illness and other less clearly defined depressive presentations. Given the influence of psychiatric opinion in the area of depression, these findings may serve as a platform for further discussions to refine the concepts of depression in the palliative care setting, which in turn may improve diagnostic and treatment outcomes.

In addition, environmental factors such as ethnicity, nationality and religion are also seen to play a significant role. This in itself <b>adds</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>challenges</b> encountered, by those looking to critically apply learning and frameworks, to any information gathered. In the first instance, this paper tries to bring aspects together from Branding and Culture and in doing so, aims to find linkages between the two. The main {{purpose of this paper is}} to distil current brand thinking and explore what impact cross-cultural, cross-national, and ethnic interactions have on a brand’s creation. The position of the authors is that without further understanding in this field, a brand will experience what has been termed by them as the ‘Pinocchio Effect’. Pinocchio was a puppet who longed to become a real human being; but sadly encountered difficulties. The conclusion presented is that the critical long-term success of a brand lies in three areas: how it is created; the subsequent associated perceptions; and more specifically in the reality of the relationships that it enjoys. Collectively these processes necessitate an appraisal of connecting strategic management procedures and thinking. Finally, this paper looks into proposing future methods for brand evaluation and strategic management. The aim is to stimulate further thinking in a field; which transcends national, ethnic and cultural boundaries - in the interests of developing new insight, and to provide a platform for marketers to develop more effective communications...|$|E

Growth in the numbers benefiting from childcare has been accompanied by increasing numbers of childcare practitioners acquiring qualifications. These developments are well documented in a variety of reports and research studies. However, little attention has been paid to the people who teach on these programmes, the childcare tutors. Given the recognition of the importance of quality childcare for healthy child development it is timely to investigate the experience, qualifications and theoretical bases of the tutors who prepare childcare practitioners. This study presents an in-depth profile of a small number of such childcare tutors and maps their working contexts. Original data regarding the provision of childcare training nationally were compiled from a range of sources. Data from semi-structured interviews with childcare tutors and with providers are used to build a profile of these tutors and their continuing professional development needs. The study locates childcare tutors in two distinct domains: childcare and adult education.

This small-scale study focused on the challenges that influence or affect the academic progress and development of these learners. The study looked at how teenage pregnancy {{is perceived as a}} social problem in many countries as well as in Namibia and examined its impact on the educational aspirations of the young mothers. Namibia has a policy in place to cater for the continued education of learners returning to school after the birth of their babies. This policy was analysed and its implementation in the selected schools formed part of the study, The findings revealed that the educational challenges faced by these young women range from social exclusion to the need to manage the dual responsibilities of motherhood and study. The way in which the learners who participated in this study are viewed by their peers and their teachers was found to be influenced by the cultural connotations ascribed to women as soon as they become mothers, a factor that <b>adds</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>challenges</b> these learners face when returning to schools. Cultural connotations which perceived a mother as an adult in the society was attached to the change of the behaviours and attitudes of school young mothers.

The study revealed that there is no shared understanding of the policy among the participants and that it is not effectively implemented in the schools, nor is it uniformly applied. ...|$|E
40|$|Growing {{concerns}} over high and volatile fossil-fuel prices, energy security {{and climate change}} present significant sustainability challenges for electricity industries around the world. They have particular implications for generation investment and planning as decisions to build power plants represent major commitments with regard to future electricity industry costs, fuel dependencies, energy security outcomes, and greenhouse emissions. Increasing uncertainty about future fuel prices, plant construction costs, climate change policies and electricity demand <b>adds</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>challenges.</b> In consequence, generation investment decision-making is transitioning from traditional cost minimisation approaches towards more complex assessments incorporating future uncertainties {{and a range of}} industry objectives. This thesis presents a novel generation investment and planning decision-support tool for assessing possible future generation portfolios within an electricity industry under uncertainty and multiple policy objectives. The tool extends conventional optimal generation mix concepts by using Monte Carlo simulation and portfolio analysis techniques to determine probability distributions of future expected generation costs and greenhouse emissions {{for a wide range of}} generation portfolios. The tool can incorporate complex and correlated probability distributions for future fossil-fuel prices, carbon prices, plant investment costs, and electricity demand including price elasticity impacts. It supports sophisticated risk assessments, including downside economic risks, for any generation portfolio. A post-processing analysis is also implemented to assess the potential operational dispatch constraints and costs associated with different portfolios in meeting time-varying demand. Applications of this tool are demonstrated through case studies of electricity industries with different generation options facing a range of future uncertainties. The results provide high-level insights into issues that will likely be key drivers of future industry performance such as the impact of different sources of uncertainty, the role of future demand changes in response to electricity prices, and the interaction between wind penetration and carbon pricing on the expected costs, cost risks, and emissions of different portfolios. The implications of nuclear power and the value of different technologies within generation portfolios are also explored. These results highlight the potential value of the tool in facilitating utility and policy decision-making in the challenging task of generation investment and planning for increasingly uncertain future electricity industries...|$|E

40|$|Even {{without the}} impacts of climate change, water {{managers}} face prodigious challenges in meeting sustainable development goals. Growing populations need affordable food, water and energy. Industrial development demands a growing share of water resources and contaminates those same resources with its untreated wastes. Nature is {{at the back of}} the queue, but preserving enough flows to sustain aquatic ecosystems is vital for human survival and to preserve biodiversity. By 2025, the global demand for freshwater is expected to rise by 25 ¿r more, but we are still contaminating the available supplies at an accelerating rate. The drinking water supply and sanitation sector has laudable targets: safe water and sanitation for all by 2025, with the intermediate Millennium goal of halving the proportion of people lacking those basic services by 2015. Considering that in the year 2000 more than a billion people had no safe water supply and some 2. 4 billions lacked hygienic sanitation facilities, a huge collective effort is needed even to approach the objectives. Factoring in climatic extremes <b>adds</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>challenges,</b> but it is vital if progress is not to be continually wiped out by hydrometeorological disasters. When drinking water wells and latrines are flooded or falling groundwater tables leave hand pumps dry, there are disease epidemics, deaths and "environmental refugees", and years of investments by people and governments are rendered worthless. Agriculture is the biggest water consumer and climate change will not alter that. What may change though is the balance of food production, with the developed countries producing a greater share of rising food demands and developing countries dining on imported "virtual water". As water gets scarcer, balancing the needs of people and those of nature becomes even harder. Nature is adaptable and resilient, but shrinking lakes and declining fisheries are just two of the indicators that there are limits to our maltreatment of her. When La Niña brings drought and declining river flows, it is not just food production that suffers. Loss of hydropower damages industry, the power companies, and ultimately people¿s jobs.

40|$|Drug {{makers are}} facing an {{ever-increasing}} challenge as more countries implement serial-ization and tracking regulations and set compliance deadlines {{in an effort}} to ensure the safety and quality of prescription drugs being sold within their borders. Complying with reg-ulations coming into effect will be a demanding task {{due to a lack of}} global harmonization. The foundation of any tracking system is serialization, which entails affixing to finished drugs a unique serial number and barcode or radiofrequency identification (RFID) that can then be verified at the point of sale. But this basic step is fraught with complexities and variants. Some countries may require verification at each step of the supply chain; others may require it only when the drug passes to the end user. Most countries are requiring serialization at the unit level; this also is the case for California, discussed below. On the federal level, the US is considering starting with serialization at the lot level. The numbering system a country chooses also <b>adds</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>challenges</b> of compliance. For instance, countries such as Turkey and France are following GS 1 standards, which include the Global Trade Item Number unique numbering scheme, while China is imposing its own numbering system. 1 In addition to the serial number, most countries want a bar-code, either a two-dimensional (2 D) matrix or a linear barcode. A second level of tracking involves aggregation, which entails putting a separate number and barcode on each bundling of the product so scanning will show the individual serial numbers of all the units included in that bundle, shipper box or pallet. Some coun-tries do not require aggregation, others require it up to a certain level and still others expect it throughout the supply chain. Another tracking requirement is an epedigree, an electronic document that moves through the supply chain with the drug, and records each sale, trade or purchase of the product. Currently, epedigrees are not required by the countries that have implemented a tracking system, but some, including the US, are proposing them. The level of detail and amount of data contained in an epedigree could vary greatly from country to country. A...|$|E
40|$|The thesis focuses on, {{and tries}} to evaluate, {{the role that the}} African Union (AU) plays in {{protecting}} the peace and security on the African continent. The thesis takes an interdisciplinary approach to the topic by both utilizing international relations and international law theories. The two disciplines are combined in an attempt to understand the evolution of the AU’s commitment to the pragmatist doctrine: responsibility to protect (R 2 P). The AU charter is considered to be the first international law document to cover R 2 P as it allows the AU to interfere {{in the internal affairs of}} its member states. The R 2 P doctrine was evolved around the notion of a need to arrive at a consensus in regard to the right to intervene in the face of humanitarian emergencies. A part of the post-Cold War shift in UN behaviour has been to support local solutions to local problems. Hereby the UN acts in collaboration with regional organizations, such as the AU, to achieve the shared aspirations to maintain international peace and security without getting directly involved on the ground. The R 2 P takes a more holistic and long-term approach to interventions by including an awareness of the need to address the root causes of the crisis in order to prevent future resurrections of conflicts. The doctrine also acknowledges the responsibility of the international community and the intervening parties to actively participate in the rebuilding of the post-conflict state. This requires sustained and well planned support to ensure the development of a stable society. While the AU is committed to implementing R 2 P, many of the AU’s members are struggling, both ideologically and practically, to uphold the foundations on which legitimate intervention rests, such as the protection of human rights and good governance. The fact that many members are also among the poorest countries in the world <b>adds</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>challenges</b> facing the AU. A lack of human and material resources leads to a situation where few countries are willing, or able, to support a long-term commitment to humanitarian interventions. Bad planning and unclear mandates also limit the effectiveness of the interventions. This leaves the AU strongly dependent on regional powerbrokers such as Nigeria and South Africa, which in itself creates new problems in regard to the motivations behind interventions. The current AU charter does not provide sufficient checks and balances to ensure that national interests are not furthered through humanitarian interventions. The lack of resources within the AU also generates worries over what pressure foreign nations and other international actors apply through donor funding. It is impossible for the principle of “local solutions for local problems? to gain ground while this donor conditionality exists. The future of the AU peace and security regime is not established since it still is a work in progress. The direction that these developments will take depends on a wide verity of factors, many of which are beyond the immediate control of the AU...|$|E
