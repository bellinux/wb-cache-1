50|$|An <b>advanced</b> <b>{{electronic}}</b> <b>signature</b> (AdES) is {{an electronic}} signature that has met the requirements set forth under EU Regulation No 910/2014 (eIDAS-regulation) on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions {{in the internal}} market.|$|E
5000|$|The Estonian digital {{signatures}} {{corresponds to}} the European Union Directive on Electronic Signatures (1999/93/EC [...] "Community Framework for Electronic Signatures") with the strictest requirements (<b>advanced</b> <b>electronic</b> <b>signature,</b> secure-signature-creation device, qualified certificate, certification-service-provider issuing qualified certificates).|$|E
50|$|A CAdES-based <b>electronic</b> <b>signature</b> is {{accepted}} {{in a court}} proceeding as evidence; as <b>advanced</b> <b>electronic</b> <b>signatures</b> are legally binding.8 But it gets he higher probative value when enhanced to a qualified <b>electronic</b> <b>signature.</b> To receive that legal standing, {{it needs to be}} doted with a digital certificate, encrypted by a security signature creation device ("qualified electronic signature"). The authorship of a statement with a qualified <b>electronic</b> <b>signature</b> cannot be challenged - the statement is non-repudiable.|$|R
50|$|ZertES {{is similar}} to eIDAS in assuring the legal bindingness of <b>electronic</b> <b>signatures</b> and a tiered {{approach}} to legal value in court with qualified <b>electronic</b> <b>signatures</b> having a higher probative value than <b>Advanced</b> <b>Electronic</b> <b>Signatures.</b> Cross-border communications between Switzerland and the Member state of the European Union occur on a daily basis, as the country is home to many internationally active banks and companies. Therefore, ZertES and eiDAS are comparable in technical design and carry similar legal implications.|$|R
50|$|The {{implementation}} of <b>advanced</b> <b>electronic</b> <b>signatures</b> under the specification of eIDAS serves several purposes. Business and public services processes, {{even those that}} go across borders can be safely expedited by using electronic signing. With eIDAS, EU States are required to establish “points of single contact” (PSCs) for trust services that ensure the electronic ID schemes {{can be used in}} public sector transactions that occur cross-borders, including access to healthcare information across borders.|$|R
5000|$|Electronic {{signatures}} may {{be created}} with increasing levels of security, with each having {{its own set}} of requirements and means of creation on various levels that prove the validity of the signature. To provide an even stronger probative value than the above described <b>advanced</b> <b>electronic</b> <b>signature,</b> some countries like the European Union or Switzerland introduced the qualified electronic signature. It is difficult to challenge the authorship of a statement signed with a qualified electronic signature - the statement is non-reputable. [...] Technically, a qualified electronic signature is implemented through an <b>advanced</b> <b>electronic</b> <b>signature</b> that utilizes a digital certificate, which has been encrypted through a security signature-creating device [...] and which has been authenticated by a qualified trust service provider.|$|E

50|$|Often, {{authentication}} {{and digital}} signing are applied in conjunction. In <b>advanced</b> <b>electronic</b> <b>signatures,</b> the signatory has authenticated and uniquely {{linked to a}} signature. In {{the case of a}} qualified <b>electronic</b> <b>signature</b> as defined in the eIDAS-regulation, the signer's identity is even certified by a qualified trust service provider. This linking of signature and authentication firstly supports the probative value of the signature - commonly referred to as non-repudiation of origin. The protection of the message on the network-level is called non-repudiation of emission. The authenticated sender and the message content are linked to each other. If a 3rd party tries to change the message content, the signature looses validity.|$|R
40|$|This {{discussion}} {{states the}} changes in the framework of <b>electronic</b> <b>signatures</b> in the Digital Administration Code (contained in Legislative Decree March 7, 2005, No 82) set in motion by Legislative Decree December 30, 2010, No 235, which has reintroduced the <b>electronic</b> <b>signature</b> "Advanced", under a directive of the European community. For the Italian legislature there are now two signature: <b>electronic</b> <b>signature</b> and <b>advanced</b> <b>electronic</b> <b>signatures.</b> The first type of signature includes any type of identification that somehow allows any logical association between a specific subject and certain data. The second type is "linked to the data" to which it refers, so as to enable the detection of any subsequent changes. With this substantial change the legislature introduces a further subdivision of the signature "advanced" into two species: "qualified" <b>electronic</b> <b>signature</b> and the "digital" <b>signature.</b> The <b>electronic</b> administration is grappling with the big changes that require the involvement of various associations involved...|$|R
50|$|In 1998 the Official Journal of the European Union (OJ) started being {{published}} online, on EUR-Lex. As of 1 July 2013, the digital {{version of the}} Official Journal bears legal value instead of the paper version, which is now printed on demand only. The e-OJ has an <b>advanced</b> <b>electronic</b> <b>signature</b> which guarantees its authenticity, integrity and inalterability.|$|E
50|$|In the past, when {{signing a}} {{document}} or message, the signatory would sign {{it and then}} return it to its intended recipient through the postal service, via facsimile service, or by scanning and attaching it to an email. This could lead to delays and of course, the possibility that signatures could be forged and documents altered, especially when multiple signatures from different people located in different locations are required. The process of using an <b>advanced</b> <b>electronic</b> <b>signature</b> saves time, is legally binding and assures {{a high level of}} technical security.|$|E
5000|$|It is {{important}} to note that creating a qualified electronic signature is more than merely adding a qualified certificate to an <b>advanced</b> <b>electronic</b> <b>signature.</b> The signature must also be created using a qualified signature creation device (QSCD). This device is responsible for qualifying digital signatures by using specific hardware and software that ensures that he signatory only has control of their private key. In addition, a qualified trust service provider manages the signature creation data that is produced. The signature creation data must remains unique, confidential and protected from forgery ...|$|E

40|$|The {{thesis is}} {{comparing}} the legal recognition of <b>electronic</b> <b>signatures</b> in Norway and the European Union. For the European Union the legal recognition of <b>electronic</b> <b>signatures</b> is regulated in Art. 5 <b>Electronic</b> <b>Signatures</b> Directive (ESD), Norway regulated the legal recognition of <b>electronic</b> <b>signatures</b> in Section 6 <b>Electronic</b> <b>Signatures</b> Act (ESA). This thesis asks the question if the Section 6 Norwegian ESA implements Art. 5 ESD correctly {{because there are}} some differences between Section 6 ESA and Art. 5 ESD. They will be discussed in this thesis under the focus of whether Section 6 ESA complies with Art. 5 ESD or not. Both regulation are compared by their legal and technological requirements. To discuss the implementation thorough not only the two regulations have to be compared because some requirements of both regulations are defined in other regulations. In the first four chapters the very similar requirements for both laws will be described and compared. Beneath a general chapter the technological requirements of Art. 5 I ESD and Section 6 ESA will be discussed in one chapter. Although some of these requirements such as <b>advanced</b> <b>electronic</b> <b>signatures,</b> qualified certificates, certification service providers and secure-signature-creation devices are regulated in other provisions, it is necessary to compare them as well. If they do not resemble the technical background Art. 5 ESD and Section 6 ESA will not comply with each other. This can result in different sorts of <b>electronic</b> <b>signatures</b> Art. 5 ESD and Section 6 ESA affect. Then the consequences of the Norwegian implementation will be discussed under the focus of the EFTA-Court legislation. Because of some legislation of the EFTA-Court is based on decisions of the ECJ, the necessary ECJ-decisions will be discussed as well. Both laws take a so-called two-tier approach where a so-called minimalist approach and a so-called prescriptive approach are combined. The minimalist approach give a minimum legal recognition to a form of <b>electronic</b> <b>signatures</b> and the prescriptive approach describes the functions of a certain technology. The differences between both Regulations are sometimes obvious, seem sometimes obvious or are hidden. The most obvious difference is that Art. 5 II ESD and Section 6 Sentence 2 ESA seem to be two different regulations. The first is a non-discrimination rule and the second is a broad guideline what legal recognition an <b>electronic</b> <b>signature</b> according to the definitions in Art. 2 a) ESD and Art. 3 1. ESA. Although the Norwegian law implements the non-discrimination rule by using general principles of law. For example hinders the principle of free giving of evidence that an <b>electronic</b> <b>signature</b> is not admissible as evidence. But the principle of free consideration of evidence do not hinder that a judge denies a legal effect to an <b>electronic</b> <b>signature</b> with the general argumentation that the <b>electronic</b> <b>signature</b> is <b>electronic</b> or does not fulfil the requirements of a qualified signature. The non-implementation of letter l) Annex II ESD is more difficult to find, but it changes the requirements towards the technology and is therefore not complying with European Law. The consequences for the incorrect implementation has {{to be based on the}} judgements of the EFTA-Court. The EFTA-Court has developed a state liablility based on the EEA-Agreement and takes over the requirements the ECJ has developed for state liability. According to these requirements the incorrect implementation must the Directive aim to give a subject individual rights, there is an incorrect implementation which is sufficient serious and the breach of EU/EEA Law causes a loss of an action. The Directive gives a subject an individual right to use an <b>electronic</b> <b>signature</b> to gain a certain legal effect. The incorrect implemention is sufficiently serious because the possibility to reject a legal effect to an <b>electronic</b> <b>signature</b> build different requirements towards the legal recognition of <b>electronic</b> <b>signatures.</b> This hinders the establishment of an internal market. The third requirement is not fulfilled yet and therefore the Norwegian State will not be hold liable for that incorrect implementation...|$|R
