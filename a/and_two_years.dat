40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{describe}} the presence of uncertainty experienced by heart transplant recipients at one <b>and</b> <b>two</b> <b>year</b> diagnostic follow-up evaluations. Twelve one <b>year</b> <b>and</b> eleven <b>two</b> <b>year</b> transplant recipients completed the Mishel Uncertainty in Illness Scale (MUIS), prior to and after cardiac catheterization. There was a decrease in uncertainty levels from pre to post-catheterization, for both one <b>and</b> <b>two</b> <b>year</b> recipients, however, findings were not significant. Recipients prior experience with catheterization and the interaction effects of the complete evaluation process or future health status may have affected the subject's uncertainty response. <b>Two</b> <b>year</b> transplant recipients demonstrated significantly higher uncertaintly levels, before and after cardiac catheterization, when compared to one year recipients. These findings lend initial and tentative support to the proposal that uncertainty increases with time post-transplant. The yearly follow-up evaluation may represent an episodic focusing for the transplant recipient on health status...|$|R
