5|$|McGovern {{switched}} from Wesleyan Methodism to less fundamentalist regular Methodism. Influenced by Walter Rauschenbusch and the Social Gospel movement, McGovern began divinity studies at Garrett Theological Seminary in Evanston, Illinois, near Chicago. He preached as a Methodist student supply minister at Diamond Lake Church in Mundelein, Illinois, during 1946 and 1947, but became dissatisfied by {{the minutiae of}} his pastoral duties. In late 1947, McGovern left the ministry and enrolled in graduate studies at Northwestern University in Evanston, where he also worked as a teaching assistant. The relatively small history program there was <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> country and McGovern took courses given by noted academics Ray Allen Billington, Richard W. Leopold, and L. S. Stavrianos. He received an M.A. in history in 1949.|$|E
5|$|Sánchez {{throws a}} fastball that travels about ninety-one mph for his main pitch, though it {{sometimes}} {{can go up}} to ninety-five mph. His other pitches (slurve and change-up) travel in the low eighties. Wildness {{has been a problem}} for Sánchez; he has walked 10% – 15% of major-league batters faced each season. However, he also strikes out a lot of batters; he struck out two hundred {{for the first time in}} his career in 2010. That year, he led all qualifying MLB starting pitchers in limiting hits per innings pitched (6.61 H/9), and his career swinging-strike percentage is <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> majors.|$|E
5|$|The {{story of}} the Ohio Works team {{proved to be an}} early chapter in Youngstown's long history of amateur and minor league baseball. In the 1930s and 1940s, the city was a {{frequent}} host of the National Amateur Baseball Federation (NABF) championship. NABF officials praised the community for the condition of its sandlot baseball diamonds, which they rated as <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> country. During {{the first half of the}} 20th century, Youngstown-based teams provided experience and exposure to future major league players such as Everett Scott, Floyd Baker, and Johnny Kucab. Today, the Youngstown–Warren area is home base to the Mahoning Valley Scrappers, a minor league team that competes in the Class A New York–Penn League.|$|E

5|$|Barbara McClintock (June 16, 1902 – September 2, 1992) was an American {{scientist}} and cytogeneticist who {{was awarded the}} 1983 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. McClintock received her PhD in botany from Cornell University in 1927. There she started her career as the leader {{in the development of}} maize cytogenetics, the focus of her research {{for the rest of her}} life. From the late 1920s, McClintock studied chromosomes and how they change during reproduction in maize. She developed the technique for visualizing maize chromosomes and used microscopic analysis to demonstrate many fundamental genetic ideas. One of those ideas was the notion of genetic recombination by crossing-over during meiosis—a mechanism by which chromosomes exchange information. She produced the first genetic map for maize, linking regions of the chromosome to physical traits. She demonstrated the role of the telomere and centromere, regions of the chromosome that are important in the conservation of genetic information. She was recognized <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> field, awarded prestigious fellowships, and elected a member of the National Academy of Sciences in 1944.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though the}} two clubs were placed in {{separate}} divisions in the NFL's 2002 divisional realignment, their rivalry did not diminish. At that time, both teams were <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> AFC, and both were led by likely Hall of Fame quarterbacks, Peyton Manning (for the Colts) and Tom Brady (for the Patriots) The teams met three times in four years (2003, 2004, 2006) in the playoffs, with the winner going on to win that season's Super Bowl each time. The Manning portion of the rivalry began in Manning's rookie season, 1998; in 1999 Manning suffered a bitter 31–28 loss in September as the Patriots behind Drew Bledsoe erased a 28–7 Colts lead, then defeated the Patriots 20–15 in Indianapolis on December 12. The Brady–Manning portion of the rivalry began on September 30, 2001, as Brady made his first NFL start in a 44–13 Patriots win at Foxboro; on October 21 the Patriots defeated the Colts at the RCA Dome 38–17.|$|E

5|$|Many critics saw A Link Between Worlds as {{a worthy}} {{successor}} to A Link to the Past, but also remarked {{that the game}} was outstanding in its own right. The game was commended for making enhancements to core and traditional elements of the series. New additions and changes to the established formula were also welcomed. Polygon reviewer Arthur Gies called it the best Zelda game in past twenty years, and GamesRadar writer Lorenzo Veloria {{said that it was}} an essential title for every Nintendo 3DS owner. Reception towards the game's puzzles was overwhelmingly positive; praise was directed towards how well the wall-merging mechanic had been incorporated into dungeon puzzles and integrated into every area of the game. Keza MacDonald of IGN thought A Link Between Worlds was the best puzzle game that Nintendo had ever created. Game Informer writer Dan Ryckert noted that some of the game's dungeons and boss encounters were <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> franchise's history. The level of difficulty present in the puzzles and dungeons was met with approval; the challenge was described as a perplexing experience rather than a frustrating one by GameSpot editor Martin Gaston.|$|E
5|$|North Carolina's {{defense was}} <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> country {{during the regular}} season, {{finishing}} the year ranked second in total defense (209.3 yards per game) and fifth in scoring defense (13 points per game). The Tar Heels also were ranked second {{in the country in}} terms of rushing yards, allowing an average of 77.9 rushing yards per game during the regular season. Those statistics were due to the performance of three consensus first-team All-America defenders: defensive end Greg Ellis, linebacker Brian Simmons and cornerback Dré Bly. Ellis had 87 tackles during the season (18 for loss) to lead the team in both categories. Another defender, linebacker Kivuusama Mays, was a third-team All-American. Simmons in particular felt confident enough to guarantee prior to the game that the Tar Heels would win if they held Virginia Tech to 20 points or less. No team had scored more than that total since the 1995 season.|$|E
5|$|The team {{began the}} 2010 MLS season slowly with {{injuries}} to key players that impacted Schmid's starting lineups. The team {{had a record}} of 4–8–3 over the first 15 games. The Sounders also advanced through the preliminary round of the 2010–11 CONCACAF Champions League but failed {{to get past the}} group stage. The 2010 U.S. Open Cup campaign culminated in Schmid winning his third championship with a 2–1 victory over the Crew at Seattle's Qwest Field. No MLS team had previously won back-to-back Open Cups. The Sounders rebounded {{in the second half of}} the regular season with a 10–2–3 record to qualify for the playoffs. The team faced Bruce Arena's Galaxy in the two-legged quarter-final. Both coaches are considered to be <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> MLS, and it was the first meeting between the two in the playoffs. The Sounders lost by a 3–1 aggregate and Arena moved within one game of Schmid's MLS postseason record of 19 wins.|$|E

In 1993, Tech received an invitation to the Independence bowl, beginning a 16-year streak that has seen the Hokies invited to a bowl game at the conclusion of every season since then. In 1995, the Hokies defeated the Texas Longhorns in the 1995 Sugar Bowl, vaulting them into national prominence. In recent years, Virginia Tech football teams have been ranked <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> country according to season-ending polls. In 2000, Virginia Tech participated in the 2000 Sugar Bowl, which served as the national championship game of the 1999 college football season.
