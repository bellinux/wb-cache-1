Localized <b>heating</b> <b>during</b> <b>welding,</b> followed by rapid cooling generates residual stress and distortion in the weld and base metal.

The exercise on which this paper focuses {{is part of an}} optional Master of Science course that is offered to both Chalmers and international students. The exercise involves the modelling of <b>heat</b> conduction <b>during</b> <b>welding.</b> In the past the exercise involved the use of MATLAB. The use of MATLAB has posed some problems but after the course was opened up to overseas students these problems were compounded. The Swedish students had at least some basic knowledge of MATLAB but several of the foreign students have no experience at all of using the program. As a result a lot of time was given to helping students understand and use MA TLAB even though the main purpose of the exercise was to help them {{come to grips with the}} actual problem of modelling and understanding <b>heat</b> conduction <b>during</b> <b>welding.</b> It was clear, from discussions between the two authors, that the original aim of the exercise was being subverted and that in pedagogical terms this affected the constructive alignment of teaching and learning. This paper reports on actions taken to resolve this dilemma and an evaluation of the success of the changes that were introduced. It also proposes a simple formula for curriculum reform that can be used to initiate and evaluate changes to existing exercises and courses in engineering education...|$|R
40|$|Measurements of heat {{affected}} zone width for multi high carbon steel joint in case of single and double pass arc welded have been studied. These measurements are carried out in accompanying of hardness and microstructural observations. Knowing that, high carbon steel has a poor weld ability and most of welding processes are carried out for repairing components. It is found that a preheating {{was a very important}} parameter in identifying the width of heat-affected zone. Preheating the joint at 450 °C was found to gives less width {{heat affected}} zone (i. e. 5. 93 mm) in the case of single pass welding practices.

In this work, the MIG welding operation on aluminum T-joint thin plate has been studied by the {{integration of}} both simulation and experiments. The aim of the paper is to enlarge the global database, to promote the use of thin aluminum sheets in automotive body industries and to provide new data. Since the welding of aluminum thin plates is difficult to control due to high speed of the heat source and high <b>heat</b> flows <b>during</b> <b>heating</b> and cooling, a simulation model could be considered an effective design tool to predict the real phenomena.

40|$|CMT+P welding is less {{susceptible}} to hot cracking than the MAG welding process due to use of low heat input properties. Solidification cracking was found in all weld specimens that had greater 0. 39 KJ/mm heat inputs. Cracking occurs because of the contraction stresses generates during cooling. Hydrogen cracking is found in HAZ with low heat input parameters, this type of cracking occurred because of very rapid cooling and therefore {{not enough time to}} allow the hydrogen to dissipate from the specimen. To eliminate this type of cracking the experiment could be repeated by adding <b>heating</b> <b>during</b> <b>welding</b> to control and reduce the cooling rate. Due to high carbon content in the steel and very fast cooling the microstructure of the weld is martensitic in the base metal as well as the HAZ.

40|$|AbstractCreep tests {{carried out}} on the joints of {{ferritic}} steels at 823 K over a stress range of 100 - 380 MPa indicate that the similar joints possessed lower creep rupture strength than its ferritic base metal. On the other hand, failure of the dissimilar joint occurred at relatively lower stresses at the ferritic/austenitic weld interface. Microhardness measurements on the two different joints reveal that a hardness peak at the ferritic/austenitic weld interface and a hardness trough at the intercritical heat affected zone (HAZ) in ferritic base metal, which suggest the role of distinct microstructural consequence. Un- tempered martensite was found at the ferritic/austenitic weld interface imparting high hardness, resulting in inhomogeneity in the strength at the interface. On the other hand, annealing of martensitic structure of modified 9 Cr- 1 Mo steel by intercritical <b>heating</b> <b>during</b> <b>welding</b> thermal cycle resulted in hardness trough in the intercritical HAZ.

Depending on the duration of <b>heating</b> <b>during</b> the <b>welding</b> process, the wave characteristics of the flexural motion changes; therefore, the wave characteristics can be related with the heating durations. In the present study, welding of one end {{of a bar}} to a rigid body is simulated and flexural motion generated at the free end of the bar through impulse force is analyzed. Temperature field and flexural wave characteristics are computed for different heating durations.

Five events are observed in several passbands in X-rays, {{which allows the}} determination of the eruptive plasma temperature using a filter ratio method. We find that the isothermal temperatures vary from 1. 6 to 10 MK. These temperatures are an average weighted toward higher temperature plasma. We determine the mass constraints of eruptive plasmas by assuming simplified geometrical structures of the plasma with isothermal plasma temperatures. This method provides an upper limit to the masses of the observed eruptive plasmas in X-ray passbands since any clumping causes the overestimation of the mass. For the other two events, we assume the temperatures are at the maximum temperature of the XRT temperature response function, which gives a lower limit of the masses. We find that the masses in XRT, ~ 3 x 10 13 - 5 x 10 14 g, are smaller in their upper limit than total masses obtained by LASCO, ~ 1 x 10 15 g.

However, exercise itself can pose threats to health {{such as the}} development of exertional heat shock in warm environments. Therefore, {{it is important to}} understand how the thermoregulation system adjusts during exercise and how alterations of this can contribute to heat stroke. To explore this we measured the core body temperature of rats (Tc) running for 15 min on a treadmill at various speeds in two ambient temperatures (Ta = 25 °C and 32 °C). We assimilated the experimental data into a mathematical model that describes temperature changes in two compartments of the body, representing the muscles and the core.

According to the estimation of model parameters, at Ta = 25 °C, the heat generation in the core was progressively reduced with the increase of the treadmill speed to compensate for a progressive increase in heat production by the muscles. This compensation was ineffective at Ta = 32 °C, which resulted in an increased rate of heat accumulation with increasing speed, as opposed to the Ta = 25 °C case. Interestingly, placing an animal on a treadmill increased heat production in the muscles even when the treadmill speed was zero. Quantitatively, this "ready-to-run" phenomenon accounted for over half of the heat generation in the muscles observed at maximal treadmill speed.
