The need for efficient underground communication systems has increased with increase in number of tunnels, metros, mines etc. Even though the basic principles of communication remain the same, the factors which are to be considered vary voraciously in case of underground. Unlike terrestrial environment, underground environment poses variety of challenges like humidity, wall penetration, bends, excess attenuation of signals, scattering over rough surfaces, multiple reflections etc. The model selected for the study in this case is COST 231 model.

40|$|At macroevolutionary time scales, {{and for a}} {{constant}} mutation rate, there is an expected linear relationship between time {{and the number of}} inferred neutral mutations (the "molecular clock"). However, at shorter time scales a number of recent studies have observed an apparent acceleration in the rate of molecular evolution. We study this apparent acceleration under a Jukes-Cantor model applied to a randomly mating population, and show that, under the model, it arises as a consequence of ignoring short term effects due to existing diversity within the population. The acceleration can be accounted for by <b>adding</b> <b>the</b> <b>correction</b> term h_ 0 e^{- 4 mu*t/ 3 } to the usual Jukes-Cantor formula p(t) =(3 / 4) (1 -e^{- 4 mu*t/ 3 }), where h_ 0 is the expected heterozygosity in the population at time t= 0. The true mutation rate mu may then be recovered, even if h_ 0 is not known, by estimating mu and h_ 0 simultaneously using least squares. Rate estimates made without <b>the</b> <b>correction</b> term (that is, incorrectly assuming the population to be homogeneous) will result in a divergent rate curve of the form mu_{div}=mu+C/t, so that the mutation rate appears to approach infinity as the time scale approaches zero. While our quantitative results apply only to the Jukes-Cantor model, it is reasonable to suppose that the qualitative picture that emerges also applies to more complex models. Our study therefore demonstrates the importance of properly accounting for any ancestral diversity, as it may otherwise play a dominant role in rate overestimation.

40|$|Abstract This {{paper is}} a study of an {{empirical}} design of an open-ended coaxial cavity resonator. It {{can be done by}} using the radius of the inner conductor, the inner radius and the length of the resonator. However, the basic coaxial transmission-line theory can be seen that the characteristics of the resonant frequency and the Q value are varied by the change of length, regardless of the value of radius of the inner conductor and inner radius of the resonator. We find out the impact of radius of the inner conductor, inner radius of the resonator and the length of the resonator parameter and propose the optimized empirical resonator design method by reducing the error between the theoretical value and the design value. Based on the simulation, several resonators are fabricated by the size of 14 mm for the radius of inner conductor, 2 mm, 5 mm, 10 mm respectively for the inner radius of resonator, and 8. 5 mm for the length of the resonator. The resonant frequencies of the produced resonators were measured at 6. 1, 5. 7, 6. 5 GHz respectively.
