5|$|In {{the mid-1960s}} {{a small group}} of Cuban iguanas was {{released}} from a zoo on Isla Magueyes, southwest of Puerto Rico, forming an independent free-ranging feral population. As of 2000, there has been talk of removing or relocating this population of iguanas by the US Department of Interior. This feral population is the source for 90% of the captive Cuban iguanas held in private collections and was the source for part of a study on animal communication and evolution conducted by Emilia Martins, <b>a</b> <b>biologist</b> <b>at</b> Indiana University.|$|E
25|$|While dolphin attacks occur {{far less}} {{frequently}} than attacks by other sea animals, such as sharks, some scientists {{are worried about}} the careless programs of human-dolphin interaction. Dr. Andrew J. Read, <b>a</b> <b>biologist</b> <b>at</b> the Duke University Marine Laboratory who studies dolphin attacks, points out that dolphins are large and wild predators, so people should be more careful when they interact with them.|$|E
25|$|Also in 1972 Peter Mazur, <b>a</b> <b>biologist</b> <b>at</b> ORNL, froze {{with liquid}} nitrogen, thawed and {{implanted}} mouse embryos in a surrogate mother. The mouse pups were born healthy. The technique is {{popular in the}} livestock industry as it allows the embryos of valuable cattle to be transported easily and a prize cow can have multiple eggs extracted and thus through in vitro fertilisation have many more offspring than would naturally be possible.|$|E

25|$|Critics of {{the project}} contend {{that there are many}} {{environmental}} issues to be considered, such as the link between El Niño (ENSO) and the threat to water supplies posed by El Niño. The ACP has commissioned studies by several consultants about water supply and quality problems.

2500|$|Michael Behe, <b>a</b> <b>biologist</b> <b>at</b> Lehigh University and an {{advocate}} of intelligent design, felt that by [...] "talking on {{about the age of}} the Earth [...] than on the elegance and complexities of life", both Ham and Nye lost the debate. Metropolitan Nicholas of the Greek Orthodox Church, who was trained as a scientist before taking holy orders, also criticized both Nye's and Ham's approach to the debate, saying that [...] "Research that is done to challenge God, has the disease of prejudice. Research is done to discover scientific truth. What problem is there with someone wanting to broaden the horizons of their thoughts and knowledge? God is approached better this way. God is not an ideology that we should by all means defend, but we believe in Him because He is Truth. In this sense, even scientific truth reveals Him. If He is still questioned, it is time to find out about Him. A believer who fears scientific research, fears the truth. Perhaps he is a believer who does not believe." ...|$|E
