5|$|Sorkin {{conceived}} the political drama The West Wing in 1997 {{when he went}} unprepared to a lunch with producer John Wells and in a panic pitched to Wells a series centered on the senior staff of the White House, using leftover ideas from his script for The American President. He told Wells about his visits to the White House while doing research for The American President, and they found themselves discussing public service and {{the passion of the}} people who serve. Wells took the concept and pitched it to the NBC network, but was told to wait because the facts behind the Lewinsky scandal were breaking and there was concern that an audience {{would not be able to}} take a series <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> House seriously. When a year later some other networks started showing interest in The West Wing, NBC decided to greenlight the series despite their previous reluctance. The pilot debuted in the fall of 1999 and was produced by Warner Bros. Television.|$|E

25|$|High speed {{photometry}} of {{the system}} shows multiple periods of variation in the luminosity. The main period of seconds (17m 8.73s) is the orbital period of the pair. A secondary period of seconds (17m 31s) {{is believed to be}} caused by a superhump—an elevated outburst in the signal that occurs with a period slightly longer than the orbital period. The superhump {{may be the result of}} an elongation of the accretion disk in combination with precession. The elliptical disk precesses <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>white</b> dwarf over a time interval much longer than the orbital period, causing a slight change in the orientation of the disk over each orbit.|$|E

25|$|On February 28, 1973, Acting FBI Director L. Patrick Gray {{testified before}} the Senate Judiciary Committee during his {{nomination}} to replace J. Edgar Hoover as Director of the FBI. Armed with newspaper articles indicating the White House had possession of FBI Watergate files, the committee chairman, Sam Ervin, questioned Gray as to what he knew <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> House obtaining the files. Gray stated he had given FBI reports to Dean, and had discussed the FBI investigation with Dean on many occasions. It also came out that Gray had destroyed important evidence entrusted to him by Dean. Gray's nomination failed and now Dean was directly linked to the Watergate cover-up.|$|E
25|$|For {{much of its}} history, {{knowledge}} of Venona was restricted even from {{the highest levels of}} government. Senior army officers, in consultation with the FBI and CIA, made the decision to restrict {{knowledge of}} Venona within the government (even the CIA was not made an active partner until 1952). Army Chief of Staff Omar Bradley, concerned <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> House's history of leaking sensitive information, decided to deny President Truman direct knowledge of the project. The president received the substance of the material only through FBI, Justice Department, and CIA reports on counterintelligence and intelligence matters. He was not told the material came from decoded Soviet ciphers. To some degree this secrecy was counter-productive; Truman was distrustful of FBI head J. Edgar Hoover and suspected the reports were exaggerated for political purposes.|$|E
