5|$|In 2009 the European {{ombudsman}} published {{statistics of}} citizens' complaints against EU institutions, {{with most of}} them filed against the Commission (66%) and concerning lack of transparency (36%). In 2010 the Commission was sued for blocking <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>documents</b> on EU biofuel policy. This happened after media accused the Commission of blocking scientific evidence against biofuel subsidies. Lack of transparency, unclear lobbyist relations, conflicts of interests and excessive spending of the Commission was highlighted {{in a number of}} reports by internal and independent auditing organisations. It has also been criticised on IT-related issues, particularly with regard to Microsoft.|$|E

On September 2, 2010, the Department of Justice filed suit against Arpaio to compel his cooperation with the investigation. A spokeswoman for the Justice Department stated that it was unprecedented for an agency to refuse to cooperate with a Title VI investigation, and that {{this was the first time}} the Justice Department had sued to compel <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>documents</b> and facilities. The suit was settled in June 2011, after Arpaio allowed federal officials to interview Sheriff's office employees and review hundreds of thousands of documents for the investigation.|$|E
25|$|Another {{allegation}} {{is that in}} 2011, the Prime Minister's office {{facilitated the}} release of confidential Security Intelligence Service (SIS) documents to Cameron Slater so he could use them to embarrass Phil Goff. Slater made an Official Information Act (OIA) request to the SIS for confidential documents which confirmed the SIS had briefed Phil Goff about suspected Israeli spies who left the country after the second Christchurch earthquake – after Goff had said publicly he was not briefed. Slater was given <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>documents</b> within 24 hours – long before other media outlets who had also asked for them. Slater's emails described in Dirty Politics suggest {{he knew what was}} in the documents before they were released and that the OIA would be expedited in unusually quick time. Goff believes this inside information could only have come from the SIS director Warren Tucker or from staff in the prime minister's office.|$|E

500|$|Sociologist J.

[...] Melton concludes that Miller's book is compromised by its author's lack of <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>documents</b> charting Hubbard's life and the early history of the church. Melton contradicts Miller's assertion that Hubbard was lying about his military career. [...] "Hubbard left the service in February 1946 with twenty-one citations, letters of commendation, and medals on his record. It {{should be noted that the}} details of Hubbard's naval career have been called into question by the critics of Scientology. Critics rely on an alleged copy of Hubbard's notice of separation deposited in the Veteran's Administration and accessible through the Freedom of Information Act." ...|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Rzeczpospolita, Andrei Illarionov, Vladimir Putin's former advisor, noted, [...] "... contrary to the promises, the investigation of this crash is neither transparent nor dynamic."

[...] Illarionov {{was also one of}} the signatories of an open letter written by Russian dissidents, which voiced concerns about the conduct of the investigation. According to the letter, [...] "rapprochement with the current Russian authorities is more important for the Polish government than determining the truth about the plane crash." [...] Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk responded that his government would obtain flight data from the Russian investigators before making its own judgment and revealing it to the public.|$|E
2500|$|On 19 October 2009, Flavio Briatore {{announced}} his intentions {{to sue the}} FIA for his lifetime ban, claiming that [...] "the FIA [...] {{been used as a}} tool of vengeance on behalf of one man" [...] and that there were several miscarriages of justice, including a delay in summons, a failure to state the charges in advance and a lack of <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>documents</b> and [...] "Witness X". On 5 January 2010, the French Tribunal de Grande Instance overturned his ban, and awarded him €15,000 in compensation. Symonds' ban was also overturned, and he was awarded €5,000 in compensation. Briatore was believed to be suing the FIA for damages in addition to getting his ban overturned, and has also stated his intention to pursue legal action against the Piquet family.|$|E

2500|$|Title II {{established}} {{three very}} controversial provisions: [...] "sneak and peek" [...] warrants, roving wiretaps {{and the ability}} of the FBI to gain <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>documents</b> that reveal the patterns of U.S. citizens. The so-called [...] "sneak and peek" [...] law allowed for delayed notification of the execution of search warrants. The period before which the FBI must notify the recipients of the order was unspecified in the Act—the FBI field manual says that it is a [...] "flexible standard"—and it may be extended at the court's discretion. These sneak and peek provisions were struck down by judge Ann Aiken on September 26, 2007 after a Portland attorney, Brandon Mayfield, was wrongly jailed because of the searches. The court found the searches to violate the provision that prohibits unreasonable searches in the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.|$|E
2500|$|On July 28, 2015, one {{day prior}} to a {{scheduled}} ruling, Nelson's attorneys Betsy Manifold and Mark Rifkin presented new evidence that they argued was conclusive proof that the song was in the public domain, [...] "thus making it unnecessary for the Court to decide the scope or validity of the disputed copyrights, much less whether Patty Hill abandoned any copyright she may have had to the lyrics". Several weeks prior, they had been given <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>documents</b> held back from them by Warner/Chappell, which included {{a copy of the}} 15th edition of The Everyday Song Book, published in 1927. The book contained [...] "Good Morning and Happy Birthday", but the copy was blurry, obscuring a line of text below the title. Manifold and Rifkin located a clearer copy of an older edition, published in 1922, that also contained the [...] "Happy Birthday" [...] lyrics. The previously obscured line was revealed to be the credit [...] "Special permission through courtesy of The Clayton F Summy Co.". Manifold and Rifkin argued that because the music and lyrics were published without a valid copyright notice as was required at the time, [...] "Happy Birthday" [...] was in the public domain.|$|E

60|$|Antonio Herrera de Tordesillas, one of {{the authors}} most {{frequently}} cited in this work, was born in 1565, of Roderick Tordesillas, and Agnes de Herrera, his wife. He received an excellent education, and entered into the employ of Vespasian Gonzago, brother to the duke of Mantua, who was viceroy of Naples for Philip the Second of Spain. He was for some time secretary to this statesman, and intrusted with all his secrets. He was afterwards grand historiographer of the Indies to Philip II, who added to that title a large pension. He wrote various books, but the most celebrated is a General History of the Indies, or American Colonies, in four volumes, containing eight decades. When he undertook this work, all the public archives were thrown open to him, and he had <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>documents</b> of all kinds. He has been charged with great precipitation in the production of his two first volumes, and with negligence in not making sufficient use of the indisputable sources of information thus placed within his reach. The fact was, that he met with historical tracts lying in manuscript, which embraced a great part of the first discoveries, and he contented himself with stating events as he found them therein recorded. It is certain that a great part of his work {{is little more than a}} transcript of the manuscript history of the Indies by Las Casas, sometimes reducing and improving the language when tumid; omitting the impassioned sallies of the zealous father, when the wrongs of the Indians were in question; and suppressing various circumstances degrading to the character of the Spanish discoverers. The author of the present work has, therefore, frequently put aside the history of Herrera, and consulted the source of his information, the manuscript history of Las Casas.|$|E

40|$|Three {{different}} security {{models have}} been advocated <b>to</b> determine the <b>access</b> rights <b>to</b> <b>documents</b> in a network of computers; DAC, MLS, and RBAC.

The model determines the <b>access</b> rights <b>to</b> <b>documents</b> based on their content and automatically classifies the access levels or detects possible incorrect settings. The content-based document access control can be used in advanced business applications to allow developers to provide a high level integration of security models within business applications. ...|$|R
