Alternatively, measurement of the <b>angular</b> <b>rotation</b> of the nut can {{serve as the basis}} for defining screw extension based on the fastener's thread pitch.

25|$|In fact, {{the human}} body has seven sensory systems – not five. The sixth and seventh systems are the senses of motion located in the inner ear. The former signals the {{beginning}} and end of rotation and the latter signals body tilt relative to gravity as well as body translation. The seventh system no longer provides tilt information in weightlessness; however, it does continue to signal translation, so the afferent signals to the CNS are confusing. The experience of living and working in space alters the way the CNS interprets the otolith organ signals during linear acceleration. Although the perception is fairly accurate when subjects are exposed to angular acceleration in yaw in-flight, there are disturbances during <b>angular</b> <b>rotation</b> in pitch and roll, and during linear acceleration along the body transversal and longitudinal axes. Perception of body motion is also altered during the same motion immediately after landing. There is an adaptation to weightlessness in orbit that carries over to post-flight reactions to linear acceleration.|$|E

40|$|Exterior {{orientation}} parameters’ (EOP) estimation using space resection {{plays an}} important role in topographic reconstruction for push broom scanners. However, existing models of space resection are highly sensitive to errors in data. Unfortunately, for lunar imagery, the altitude data at the ground control points (GCPs) for space resection are error-prone. Thus, existing models fail to produce reliable EOPs. Motivated by a finding that for push broom scanners, <b>angular</b> <b>rotations</b> of EOPs can be estimated independent of the altitude data and only involving the geographic data at the GCPs, which are already provided, hence, we divide the modeling of space resection into two phases. Firstly, we estimate the <b>angular</b> <b>rotations</b> based on the reliable geographic data using our proposed mathematical model. Then, with the accurate <b>angular</b> <b>rotations,</b> the collinear equations for space resection are simplified into a linear problem, and the global optimal solution for the spatial position of EOPs can always be achieved. Moreover, a certainty term is integrated to penalize the unreliable altitude data for increasing the error tolerance. Experimental results evidence that our model can obtain more accurate EOPs and topographic maps not only for the simulated data, but also for the real data from Chang’E- 1, compared to the existing space resection model...|$|R

The shift in the state of a pointer, in both angular position and the conjugate orbital angular momentum bases, is used to estimate <b>angular</b> <b>rotations.</b> This is done by an amplification of both the real and imaginary parts of the weak-value of a polarization operator that has been coupled to the pointer, which is a spatial mode, via a spin-orbit coupling.

We have achieved effective amplification factors as large as 100, providing a sensitivity that is on par with more complicated methods that employ quantum states of light or extremely large values of orbital angular momentum.
