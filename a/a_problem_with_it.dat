Berman was concerned that if anyone had <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> <b>it,</b> they would call Stewart to complain and it would appear as though Stewart was being left out because he had criticized the story. LeVar Burton called Stewart to praise the script. Stewart was sent a copy and requested a meeting to discuss changes. Piller feared the worst, but after a twenty-minute meeting with Stewart, who requested several dialogue changes, the script was finalized. During pre-production, the marketing department wanted to decide a title, preferring Star Trek: Revolution. Alan Spencera friend of Pillersuggested Insurrection, which was selected from a choice of Insurrection, Rebellion, High Treason and Act of Treason.|$|E

500|$|Scott {{noted that}} {{it was easier to}} reach correct puzzle solutions, with clues being given out [...] "at a very {{reasonable}} rate". He saw this as the game's largest improvement upon previous Ace Attorney titles, which he said relied on trial and error; he had considered this the weakest point in the series, and something that needed to be changed. On the other hand, Walker said that the player often can figure out what a contradiction is going to be before the game lets them prove it, and the player might come up with legitimate ideas that the game does not accept. He also wished that the life bar could be filled up in court. Cole criticized how relevant evidence sometimes is not accepted, and how testimony statements sometimes need to be pressed in a certain order, but appreciated the game's larger focus on courtroom sessions over investigations. Thomas and the reviewers at Famitsu criticized the lack of new gameplay features, although the former thought that fans of the series would be fine with it. Scott acknowledged that the gameplay only is what is expected from the series, but did not find <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> <b>it</b> due to the focus on narrative over gameplay. Moriarty said that while Trials and Tribulations is a good game in its own right, he wished that Capcom would make some changes to the gameplay or presentation, to avoid the series becoming [...] "overdone, played-out, and tired".|$|E

500|$|Mutchnick said Will was {{originally}} {{going to be}} named Will Herman ("her man") because the staff wanted to use names that [...] "speak exactly to the essence" [...] of the characters. However, they changed it to Truman ("true man") since {{they thought it was}} more accurate, as Will [...] "really lives his life in an honest way". John Barrowman was one of the final candidates for the role of Will, but was rejected because he [...] "wasn't gay enough". The part instead went to Eric McCormack, who revealed that taking the role was not difficult because he liked the concept of a gay show not being about the [...] "issues" [...] of being gay. Having played gay characters several times in his career, McCormack did not have <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> <b>it</b> and thought his character could become a [...] "poster boy for some gay movement", like DeGeneres became a spokesperson with her character. He explained that when he first read the script, [...] "what hit me immediately was that this was me. I mean, sexual orientation aside, Will was so much like me. He's a great host, he's relatively funny and he has great friends and he's a good friend to them ... the gay issue just wasn't really a big thing." [...] McCormack was also the first actor to be cast. In response to the relationship between Will and Grace, McCormak said that gay men and straight women have [...] "more fun than anybody" [...] in their relationships; [...] "Straight guys like me are jealous because of how much fun they have. We can show the audience part of that." ...|$|E

Especially the lines [...] "One more time around/Might do it", which is basically saying, 'I tried today to understand and belong and get along with other people, and I failed, but I'll probably try again tomorrow.' A lot of people misinterpreted that song as a suicide-note song. Taking the word [...] "live" [...] too literally. [...] "The Day I Tried to Live" [...] means more like the day I actually tried to open up myself and experience everything that's going on around me as opposed to blowing it all off and hiding in a cave.|$|R
