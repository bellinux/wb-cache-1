60|$|My Lords, the {{prisoner}} {{at the bar}} in the year 1780 sent a petition to the House of Commons complaining of that very chief-justice, Sir Elijah Impey. The House of Commons, who then had some trust in me, as they have some trust still, did order me, along with persons more wise and judicious than myself, several of whom stand near me, to make an inquiry into {{the state of the}} justice of that country. The consequence of that inquiry was, that we began to conceive a very bad opinion both of the complainant and defendant in that business,--that we found the English justice to be, as we thought it, and reported it to the House, a grievance, instead of a redress, to the people of India. I could bring before your Lordships, if I did not spare your patience, whole volumes of reports, whole bodies of evidence, which, in the progress we have made in the course of eight or nine years, brought to my mind such a conviction as will never be torn from my heart but with my life; and I should have no heart that was fit to lodge any honest sentiment, if I departed from my opinion upon that occasion. But when I declare my own firm opinion upon it,--when I declare the reasons that led me to it,--when I mention the long meditation that preceded my founding a judgment upon it, the strict inquiry, the many hours and days spent in consideration, collation, and comparison,--I trust that infirmity which could be actuated by no malice to one party or the other may be excused; I trust that I shall meet with this indulgence, when your Lordships consider, that, <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> me, as far as my public services for many years account for me, I am a man of a slow, laborious, inquisitive temper, that I do seldom leave a pursuit without leaving marks, perhaps of my weakness, but leaving marks of that labor, and that, in consequence of that labor, I made that affirmation, and thought the nature of the cause obliged me to support and substantiate it. It is true that those who sent me here have sagacity to decide upon the subject in a week; they can in one week discover the errors of my labors for nine years.|$|E

In this essay I go over a series of such arguments, arguing that the best arguments target beliefs that meet two conditions: (i) they have been investigated and debated for a very long time by a great many very smart people who are your epistemic superiors on the matter and have worked very hard under optimal circumstances to figure out if the belief is true, and (ii) <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> these people have not come to any significant agreement on the belief and <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> those who agree with you are not, as a group, in a better position to judge the belief than those who disagree with you...|$|E

T-scores were derived from the results and used to evaluate the children’s behavior.

T-scores ranged from 32 to 100.|$|E

40|$|Analyzing lexical topic-shift markers spoken {{discourse}} {{was very}} interesting since it could give the students some contribution of utilizing lexical topic-shift markers in their daily conversation and following spoken discourse, a talk-show for instance. Talk show {{is a very important}} program to discuss issues of the day, which can be watched by the Indonesian people from all levels. However, many of the Indonesia people still do not know much about topic-shift. Therefore, the writer decided to propose a thesis entitled An Analysis on lexical Topic-Shift Marker on ANTV Halo Indonesia Dialogues. The study was conducted on purpose of determining topic shifted by the participants under each theme, getting the generalization of the themes and topics based on semantic field of human perception, identifying the lexical topic-shift markers utilized by the pa 1 ticipants and depicting the reasons why the participants shifted the topics. To answer those questions above, the writer adopted the theories of discourse fragments and notion 'topic', topic framework, speaker's topic, topic boundary markers, semantic field of human perception and reason. Besides, previous research findings on related topic needed to be put in order to give on obvious view of the need to do a research. Therefore, the writer referred to a thesis entitled Topic-Shifts in Chatting among Close Friends written by ICU (2000), a student of Petra University. The writer applied qualitative approach in conducting the study since this was a research that produced oral data take from the participants that was observed and then it was transcribed by the writer. The participants of the study were an interviewer and two interviewees. The source of data of the study was taken from ANTV 'Halo Indonesia' dialogues. The writer only analyzed two dialogue themes, namely Hemat Listrik (The Electricity Economizing and the Performance of its Supply in Indonesia) and Pelapor Dugaan Suap Hakim Agung yang Divonis 3 Bulan (The Reporter of Bribery Supposition to the Judge of Supreme Court Sentenced 3 Month). From the data analysis and the findings, the writer found out that the participants utilized these lexical marker when they shifted the topics: baiklah (well), tapi (but), jadi (so), kemudian (then), ya [...] . (well [...] .), kira-kira [...] . ? (do you think [...] . ?), atau (or), and sepanjang yang anda ketahui (<b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>know).</b> The first theme consisted of six topics, which had BEING of BEING category, while the second theme consisted of six topic which had BEING of HUMAN category. The writer noted that the participants had reasons why they shifted the topics. It means that the participants did not shift the topics without any purposes. The writer classified the reasons as justification, cause and effect, knowledge, value and sign and effect reasons...|$|E
