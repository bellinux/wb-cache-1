5|$|The {{most common}} use of {{platinum}} is <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>catalyst</b> in chemical reactions, often as platinum black. It has been employed <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>catalyst</b> {{since the early}} 19th century, when platinum powder was used to catalyze the ignition of hydrogen. Its most important application is in automobiles as a catalytic converter, which allows the complete combustion of low concentrations of unburned hydrocarbons from the exhaust into carbon dioxide and water vapor. Platinum is also used in the petroleum industry <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>catalyst</b> {{in a number of}} separate processes, but especially in catalytic reforming of straight-run naphthas into higher-octane gasoline that becomes rich in aromatic compounds. PtO2, also known as Adams' catalyst, is used as a hydrogenation catalyst, specifically for vegetable oils. Platinum also strongly catalyzes the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen and it is used in fuel cells <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>catalyst</b> for the reduction of oxygen.|$|E

30|$|As {{part of our}} {{research}} program in developing various synthetic methodologies [41 – 46], we report the synthesis of benzimidazoles using lanthanum chloride (LaCl 3) <b>as</b> <b>an</b> efficient <b>catalyst.</b> The <b>catalyst</b> is known <b>as</b> <b>an</b> efficient <b>catalyst</b> in the literature for various organic transformations [47 – 52].|$|R
30|$|In summary, we {{vertically}} grew Er–SiNWs {{with the}} assistance of Pt <b>as</b> <b>a</b> VLS <b>catalyst.</b> The Er–SiNWs showed stronger luminescence at 1, 530 nm wavelength at low- and room-temperature than did the Er–SiNWs with Au. The outcomes indicate that Pt is <b>an</b> excellent candidate <b>as</b> <b>a</b> VLS <b>catalyst</b> for optically more active Er–SiNWs. It was noted that SiNWs in most cases are prepared {{with the assistance}} of Au <b>as</b> <b>a</b> VLS <b>catalyst,</b> which may be harmful for their electrical as well as optical properties. Therefore, our results suggest that Pt can be used for SiNWs with improved electrical as well as optical properties.|$|R

5|$|A new four-lane Gunningsville Bridge {{was opened}} in 2005, {{connecting}} downtown Riverview directly with downtown Moncton. On the Moncton side, the bridge connects with {{an extension of}} Vaughan Harvey Boulevard {{as well as to}} Assumption Boulevard and will serve <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>catalyst</b> for economic growth in the downtown area. This has become already evident as an expansion to the Blue Cross Centre was completed in 2006 and a Marriott Residence Inn opened in 2008. The new regional law courts on Assumption Blvd opened in 2011. Construction has begun on a new downtown 8,500 seat multipurpose events centre and arena {{on the site of the}} former Highfield Square shopping centre. This arena will open in 2018. On the Riverview side, the Gunningsville Bridge now connects to a new ring road around the town and is expected to serve <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>catalyst</b> for development in east Riverview.|$|E

Non-toxic boron ligands could replace toxic phosphorus ligands in some transition metal catalysts. Silica sulfuric acid (SiO2OSO3H) is used in organic reactions. Germanium dioxide is sometimes used <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>catalyst</b> in the production of PET plastic for containers; cheaper antimony compounds, such as the trioxide or triacetate, are more commonly employed for the same purpose despite concerns about antimony contamination of food and drinks. Arsenic trioxide has been used in the production of natural gas, to boost the removal of carbon dioxide, as have selenous acid and tellurous acid. Selenium acts <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>catalyst</b> in some microorganisms. Tellurium, and its dioxide and tetrachloride, are strong catalysts for air oxidation of carbon above 500°C. Graphite oxide can be used <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>catalyst</b> in the synthesis of imines and their derivatives. Activated carbon and alumina have been used as catalysts for the removal of sulfur contaminants from natural gas. Titanium doped aluminium has been identified as a substitute for expensive noble metal catalysts used in the production of industrial chemicals.|$|E

5|$|The {{hydrated}} form {{of aluminium}} chloride has an octahedral molecular geometry, {{with the central}} aluminum ion surrounded by six water ligand molecules. This means that the hydrated form cannot act as a Lewis acid since it cannot accept electron pairs, and thus this cannot be used <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>catalyst</b> in Friedel-Crafts alkylation of aromatic compounds.|$|E
5|$|The natural {{resistance}} to oxidation exhibited by silicon carbide, {{as well as the}} discovery of new ways to synthesize the cubic β-SiC form, with its larger surface area, has led to significant interest in its use as a heterogeneous catalyst support.
