5000|$|<b>Arfendazam</b> (INN) {{is a drug}} {{which is}} a {{benzodiazepine}} derivative. <b>Arfendazam</b> is a 1,5-benzodiazepine, with the nitrogen atoms located at positions 1 and 5 of the diazepine ring, and so is most closely related to other 1,5-benzodiazepines such as clobazam.|$|E
50|$|<b>Arfendazam</b> {{produces}} an active metabolite lofendazam, which {{is thought to}} be responsible for part of its effects.|$|E
50|$|Lofendazam {{as a human}} {{pharmaceutical}} has sedative and anxiolytic effects {{similar to}} those produced by other benzodiazepine derivatives. It is an active metabolite of another benzodiazepine, <b>arfendazam.</b>|$|E
50|$|Like other 1,5-benzodiazepines (e.g., <b>arfendazam,</b> lofendazam, CP-1414S), {{the active}} {{metabolite}} N-desmethyl-clobazam has less {{affinity for the}} α1 subunit of the GABAA receptor compared to the 1,4-benzodiazepines. It has higher affinity for α2 containing receptors, where it has positive modulatory activity.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Arfendazam</b> has {{sedative}} and anxiolytic effects {{similar to}} those produced by other benzodiazepine derivatives, but is a partial agonist at GABAA receptors, so the sedative effects are relatively mild and it produces muscle relaxant effects only at very high doses.|$|E
