500|$|After a {{few months}} service with the Channel Squadron, Lord Warden was posted to the Mediterranean. On 30 January 1868, the wooden steam frigate [...] was caught by a squall whilst taking up her berth in Valletta Harbour, Malta. She {{collided}} with the , knocking off her bowsprit and then collided with Lord Warden, damaging some of the latter's boats and an <b>accommodation</b> <b>ladder.</b> Endymion {{was reported to be}} undamaged. Lord Warden relieved [...] as the squadron flagship in 1869 and served in this position until 1875. In 1872, Lord Clyde ran aground herself whilst attempting to rescue a British steamship that had gone aground off the island of Pantellaria. Attempts to lighten Lord Clyde enough to float her off were futile, but Lord Warden was able to pull the ship free and tow her to Malta for repair. In 1875, she returned to the UK for a refit that lasted until the following year.|$|E
2500|$|On 30January 1868, Endymion {{was caught}} by a squall whilst taking up her berth in Valletta Harbour. She {{collided}} with the Turkish ironclad Mahmoudiah, taking away her bowsprit and then colliding with , damaging some boats and an <b>accommodation</b> <b>ladder.</b> Endymion {{was reported to be}} undamaged. On 18March, [...] and Endymion departed for Naples, Italy, Endymion was carrying Rear-Admiral Kellett, who was going on leave to recuperate. The voyage was also to test her engines, which had taken four months to repair. She returned to Malta on 4April. Endymion sailed on 26May for Beyrout, in company with Lord Warden. She returned via Piraeus, Greece, arriving on 14June. On 17June, a first-class engineer from Endymion was court-martialled on board HMS Hibernia for drunkenness. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to be dismissed from Her Majesty's Service. On 1 July, [...] and Endymion departed Malta for Corfu and Venice, Italy. She departed from Venice on 27July for Trieste. She arrived at Malta on 18September. On 26September, Endymion departed from Malta in company with Chiltern, Newport and Scanderia, which were laying a new submarine cable between Malta and Alexandria, which was reached on 6October. [...] She then sailed to Brindisi, Italy to collect Lord Napier of Magdala, arriving on 15November. Endymion was the first British frigate to enter Brindisi Harbour. [...] She sailed for Alexandria on 19 November, [...] arriving on 24 November. She then sailed to Malta, arriving on 6December. She was then dry docked to enable her bottom to be cleaned.|$|E
60|$|Seeing {{that there}} was a woman in the boat, the brig lowered its <b>accommodation</b> <b>ladder,</b> and the captain was {{standing}} at the gangway.|$|E
25|$|In 2013, two new shell {{doors on}} deck 3, and two new <b>accommodation</b> <b>ladders</b> on deck 5 were {{designed}} and installed by Taranaki engineering firms ITL and EHL. Marine Industrial Design and Babcock NZ made the necessary structural changes. The RHIB {{was able to}} be relocated {{as a result of the}} innovative design of the new <b>accommodation</b> <b>ladders</b> which can stow compactly inside the ship (5x2.5x2.5m), rather than being externally stored alongside the ship as before. Improved design of the ladders and the relocation of the RHIB has increased the safety and capability of the ship is no longer compromised.|$|R
50|$|<b>Accommodation</b> <b>ladders</b> can {{be mounted}} {{parallel}} or {{perpendicular to the}} ship's board. If the ladder {{is parallel to the}} ship, it has to have an upper platform. Upper platforms are mostly turnable. The lower platform (or the ladder itself) hangs on a bail and can be lifted as required.|$|R
50|$|The ladder has {{handrails}} on {{both sides}} for safety. <b>Accommodation</b> <b>ladders</b> are constructed {{in such a way}} that the steps are horizontal whatever the angle of inclination of the ladder. The lower end the ladder/lower platform is based on a roll to compensate for the motion of the ship in relation to the quay.|$|R
60|$|Harry bowed and, {{without another}} word, the Dutch {{officials}} descended the <b>accommodation</b> <b>ladder,</b> {{and returned to}} shore. When {{they were out of}} hearing, Fairclough burst into a hearty laugh.|$|E
60|$|After {{the last}} box had been swung up, the admiral and Stephen {{went up the}} <b>accommodation</b> <b>ladder</b> to the deck. The {{officers}} were gathered round the boxes wondering at their weight.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Playford has {{news for}} us of some sort," [...] the captain said, [...] "the men are rowing hard." [...] In {{a few minutes}} the boat came alongside. The second officer ran up the <b>accommodation</b> <b>ladder.</b>|$|E
5000|$|... "Sailing" [...] on {{a sea of}} {{concrete}} at the Naval Training Center, she assisted with the training of over 50,000 new recruits per year, providing an education in the fundamentals of shipboard drills and procedures, using standard deck and bridge gear like that found on all naval vessels, including lifelines, <b>accommodation</b> <b>ladders,</b> signal halyards, searchlights, the engine order telegraph and the helm. However, due to her landlocked status, Recruit lacked an engine or screw, and therefore was affectionately nicknamed the [...] "USS Neversail." [...] (The same nickname, [...] "The Neversail," [...] was also applied to the landlocked [...] "ship" [...] at NTC Bainbridge in Maryland.) Reflecting her dual identity as both a ship and a building, she was also known as Building 430, located on Geary Drive between Evans and Chauncey roads.|$|R
50|$|In the courtyard, {{slightly}} offset to the northeast, {{there was}} a cylindrical keep (the Donjon or Grosse Tour), which was thirty metres high and fifteen metres in diameter with walls 4 metres thick. The keep was encircled by a deep, dry moat with stone counterscarps to help prevent the scaling of its walls with <b>ladders.</b> <b>Accommodations</b> in the fortress were supplied by the vaulted chambers of the keep {{as well as two}} wings built against the insides of the curtain walls of the west and south sides. The castle was a fortress, but not yet a royal residence; the monarch's Parisian home at the time was the Palais de la Cité.|$|R
60|$|On {{the second}} day after the accident, the chief's boat came off from the shore, the damage having been speedily and neatly repaired. Little Bahi stood {{on the top of}} the <b>accommodation</b> <b>ladder</b> as they approached, and {{addressed}} them with great asperity, using much gesticulation with her arms.|$|E
6000|$|There {{was general}} regret {{on board the}} Serpent when the little princess said goodby to all her friends and went down the <b>accommodation</b> <b>ladder</b> to the boat with her father. The chief had said but little to the two young midshipmen, for he saw that they {{preferred}} that the matter should not be alluded to, but he held their hands at parting, and said: ...|$|E
6000|$|At {{four o'clock}} in the {{afternoon}} the watch on deck reported that the admiral's gig was being lowered, and Nat immediately got into his own boat and was rowed to the brigantine, whose name was the Agile. When the admiral approached, instead of making straight for the <b>accommodation</b> <b>ladder,</b> he rowed slowly round the vessel, making a very careful examination of the hull. When he came on deck, he said: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They went {{on board}} that morning. The Ferndale {{had just come}} to her loading berth. The only living {{creature}} on board was the ship-keeper-- whether the same who, had been described to us by Mr Powell, or another, I don't know. Possibly some other man. He, looking over the side, saw, in his own words, `the captain come sailing round {{the corner of the}} nearest cargo-shed, in company with a girl.' He lowered the <b>accommodation</b> <b>ladder</b> down on to the jetty..." ...|$|E
60|$|So quickly had it {{all been}} managed that Will could hardly {{believe that he was}} awake as, feeling strangely {{hampered}} by his belts and accouterments, he descended the <b>accommodation</b> <b>ladder,</b> and took his place with his new comrades on board one of the great native boats, and rowed to the shore. The regiment was marched direct to the railway station, where the heavy baggage had been sent, on the previous day. The men took their places in the long train which stood in readiness and, half an hour later, steamed north from Calcutta.|$|E
60|$|He now listened intently. There were {{voices on}} the fo'castle, above him; and he determined, before trying to climb up there, to swim round the vessel--keeping close to her side, {{so that he could}} not be seen, unless someone leaned far over the bulwark. Halfway along he came upon a {{projection}} and, looking up, saw that slabs of wood, three inches wide, were fixed against the side, at intervals of a foot apart; so as to form an <b>accommodation</b> <b>ladder,</b> when it was not considered necessary to lower a gangway. Two hand ropes hung by the side of it.|$|E
60|$|Half an hour later, {{with many}} precautions, for the wind he prophesied was already troubling {{the sea and}} sending little {{splashes}} of water over the stern of their deeply laden boat, they were fast to a line thrown from {{the deck of the}} three thousand ton steamer Castle, bound for Natal. Then, with a rattle, down came the <b>accommodation</b> <b>ladder,</b> and strong-armed men, standing on its grating, dragged them one by one from the death to which they had been so near. The last to be lifted up, except Thompson, was Benita, round whom it was necessary to reeve a rope.|$|E
60|$|It was a sunny morn: {{upon the}} green {{contiguous}} to the Auberge of St. Nicholas {{was a house}} upon wheels, a sort of monster omnibus, its huge shafts idle on the ground, while three fat Flemish horses cropped the surrounding pasture. From {{the door of the}} house were some temporary steps, like an <b>accommodation</b> <b>ladder,</b> on which sat Baroni, dressed something like a Neapolitan fisherman, and mending his clarionet; the man in the blouse was eating his dinner, seated between the shafts, to which also was fastened the little dog, often the only garrison, except the grandmother, of this strange establishment.|$|E
60|$|The {{official}} saluted him gravely. He was by {{no means}} sure of the sanity of this young fellow, but his curiosity had been aroused by his appearance and that of his craft, and he therefore condescended to undertake a mission that at ordinary times he would have scorned. Stephen watched the boat row alongside a frigate anchored a mile away. Shortly afterwards he saw a stir. A boat was pulled up to the <b>accommodation</b> <b>ladder.</b> A party of sailors then took their places in her, and two figures came down the gangway and the boat pushed off. A few minutes later it reached the side of the cutter. Stephen saluted as Lord Cochrane sprang nimbly on board.|$|E
60|$|The {{next morning}} they {{anchored}} about ten o'clock opposite the campong of the rajah. It {{was a good}} deal larger than any that they had passed on the way up, but the houses were mere huts, {{with the exception of a}} large wooden structure, which they at once concluded was the residence of the rajah. As soon as the Serpent turned the last bend of the river before reaching the place, the sound of drums and gongs was heard, and a large boat, manned by eighteen rowers, shot out from the bank as the anchor was dropped. The two officials on board at once mounted the <b>accommodation</b> <b>ladder,</b> and on reaching the deck were received by the first lieutenant, behind whom stood a guard of honor of the marines.|$|E
60|$|The {{three women}} were soon {{at the foot}} of the stairs, and Mrs. Dowsett's face showed signs of tears; but, though pale, she was quiet and calm, and the servant, a stout wench, had gained {{confidence}} from her mistress's example. As soon as they were ready, the three men each shouldered a trunk. The servant and the apprentice carried one between them. Mrs. Dowsett and her daughter took as many bundles as they could carry. It was but five minutes' walk down to the stairs. The boat was lying twenty yards out in the stream, fastened up to a lighter, with the apprentice and waterman on board. It came at once alongside, and in five minutes they reached the Good Venture. As soon as the women had ascended the <b>accommodation</b> <b>ladder,</b> some sailors ran down and helped to carry up the trunks.|$|E
60|$|The two juniors {{remained}} on their ships until the schooner {{was out of}} the hands of the dockyard men. According to custom, Nat did not join until they and the crew had gone on board and spent a day in scrubbing the decks and making everything tidy and ship-shape; then the gig went ashore to fetch him off. As he rowed alongside he could not help smiling at seeing the sentries at the gangway and the two young officers standing there to receive him. However, with an effort he recovered his gravity, mounted the short <b>accommodation</b> <b>ladder,</b> saluted the flag, and returned the salutes of his officers and men. On board the frigate he had been an inconsiderable member of the crowd, now he was monarch of all he surveyed. Then the crew were formed up, and according to custom he read his commission appointing him to the command, and the articles of war.|$|E
