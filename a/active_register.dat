40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new register-file {{architecture}} that virtualizes logical register con-texts. This architecture makes {{the number of}} <b>active</b> <b>register</b> contexts—representing differ-ent threads or activation records—independent {{of the number of}} physical registers. The physical register file is treated as a cache of a potentially much larger memory-mapped log-ical register space. The implementation modifies the rename stage of the pipeline to trigger the movement of register values between the physical register file and the data cache. We exploit the fact that the logical register mapping can be easily updated—simply by changing the base memory pointer—to construct an efficient implementation of register windows. This reduces the execution time by 8 % while generating 20 % fewer data cache accesses. We also use the large logical register space to avoid the cost of a large physical register file normally required for a multithreaded processor, allowing us to create an SMT core with fewer physical registers than logical registers that still performs within 2 % of the baseline. Finally, the two are combined to create a simultaneous multithreaded processor that supports register windows. This architecture achieves a 10 % increase in performance over the baseline architecture even with fewer physical than logical registers while also re-ducing data cache bandwidth. Thus we are able to combine the advantages of register win-dows with multithreading. ...|$|E

40|$|T cell {{activation}} requires {{formation of}} a tri-molecular interaction between a major histocompatibility complex (MHC), peptide, and T cell receptor. In a common model system, the ovalbumin epitope 323 - 339 binds the murine class II MHC, I-A(d), {{in at least three}} distinct registers. The DO 11. 10 T cell recognizes the least stable of these, as determined by peptide-MHC dissociation rates. Using exogenous peptides and peptide insertions into a carrier protein in combination with IL- 2 secretion assays, we show that the alternate registers do not competitively inhibit display of the <b>active</b> <b>register</b> four. In contrast, this weakly binding register is stabilized by the presence of n-terminal flanking residues active in MHC binding. The DO 11. 10 hybridoma is sensitive to the presence of specific wild-type residues extending to at least the P- 3 peptide position. Transfer of the P- 4 to P- 2 flanking residues to a hen egg lysozyme epitope also presented by I-A(d) increases the activity of that epitope substantially. These results illustrate the inherent complexity in delineating the interaction of multiple registers based on traditional thermodynamic measurements and demonstrate the potential of flanking residue modification for increasing the activity of weakly bound epitopes. The latter technique represents an alternative to substitution of anchor residues within a weakly bound register, which we show can significantly decrease the activity of the epitope to a responding T cell...|$|E
40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. December 2012. Major: Chemical Engineering. Advisor: Jennifer A. Maynard. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); ix, 123 pages. During an induced immune response, the BALB/c strain of laboratory mouse presents ovalbumin peptides by major histocompatibility complexes that stimulate responding T cells. This work first investigates {{the nature of}} ovalbumin peptide 323 - 339 presentation by the Class II MHC I-Ad in an in vitro setting, then focuses on the engineering of an individual T cell receptor (DO 11) involved in ovalbumin response, and finally, pursues isolation of other responding T cell receptors with modern high throughput sequencing techniques. T cell activation requires formation of a tri-molecular complex between a major histocompatibility complex (MHC), peptide, and T cell receptor. In a common model system, the ovalbumin epitope 323 - 339 binds the murine class II MHC, I-Ad {{in at least three}} distinct registers. The DO 11 T cell recognizes the least stable of these, as determined by peptide-MHC dissociation rates. Using synthesized peptides in combination with IL- 2 secretion assays, we show that the alternate registers do not competitively inhibit display of the <b>active</b> <b>register</b> four. In contrast, this weak register is stabilized by the presence of n-terminal flanking residues active in MHC binding. DO 11 is sensitive to the presence of wild type residues extending to at least the P- 3 peptide position, and the transfer of flanking residues in the P- 4 and P- 2 positions to an I-Ad presented hen egg lysozyme epitope increases the activity of that epitope substantially. Further, we provide evidence that display of the <b>active</b> <b>register</b> is dependent on the stability of an adjacent, overlapping register three. When epitopes were inserted in a maltose binding protein carrier, activity positively correlated with stability of the adjacent register, which was modulated by P 1 anchor residue substitutions. Collectively, these results illustrate the potential of flanking residue modification to increase the activity of weakly bound epitopes. This represents an alternative to substitution of anchor residues within a weakly bound register, which we show can significantly decrease the activity of the epitope to a T cell responder. In order to monitor the presentation of ovalbumin peptides, we have engineered a high affinity, multivalent single chain T cell receptor complex that exhibits specificity towards the OVA 323 - 339 peptide when displayed by I-Ad. DO 11 was expressed as a single chain T cell receptor at levels in excess of 30 mg/L when oriented as beta variable region followed by alpha region separated by a flexible linker and incorporating previously identified solubility-inducing mutations. High affinity variants of DO 11 were obtained from a randomized CDR 3 a; library displayed as pIII fusions by M 13 bacteriophage and panned against the DO 11 -specific, pMHC-mimicking antibody KJ 1 - 26. ScTCR dimers were created by introduction of a hexapeptide EE-epitope tag into the flexible (G 4 S) 4 linker, followed by complexation with a specific monoclonal antibody. Tetramers were formed by further association of dimers with a fluorescently labeled anti-IgG 1, and shown to specifically target peptide-loaded lymphoma cells in flow cytometry. The applicability of scTCR protein expression and phage display techniques is also explored with other TCRs and found to be generally applicable to those containing mouse TRBV 13 - 2, a gene previously noted for its preferential usage in the responding repertoire in mouse autoimmune models. We also show that 172, a TCR isolated from a mouse experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis model, can be expressed at high levels as a fusion with the short peptide IT 9302, a peptide from the c-terminus of interleukin 10 shown to possess many of the immunosuppressive characteristics of its parent cytokine. We also report on the adaptation of phage display vector pMoPac 24 to display fusion proteins with M 13 major coat protein pVIII along with three previously identified display-optimized variants. We find that the production of phage particles containing these fusions and surface display is specific to the variant being expressed, but we demonstrate more efficient display for pVIII fusions as compared to pIII for DO 11, as measured by inhibition of Interleukin 2 (IL- 2) secretion during a 24 -hour incubation with antigen presenting cells and specific peptide. The use of these vectors may be necessary for directed evolution of T cell receptors exhibiting low affinity interactions with their target peptide/MHC complexes. Finally, we report on the high throughput sequencing of mouse T cell receptor genes using pyrosequencing technologies. Alpha and Beta primer sets were designed to amplify cDNA from isolated mouse total RNA. The set was validated on T Cells isolated from mouse spleens, and used to identify T cell receptor genes from two clones, 3 B 6 and 4 C 4. A high throughput comparison of ovalbumin immunized mice and unimmunized controls is in progress. Identification of and subsequent engineering of T cell receptors involved in the ovalbumin response may provide further tools for future research on this murine system...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} unfolds an ontology {{and aesthetics}} of cloth through physical, digital and virtual states. Material structure and cloth dynamics are investigated {{through the use}} of the technology of motion capture. The context of the motion capture environment permitted working in a 3 D digital space with physical things. The potential of motion capture as an innovative designer’s tool {{that can be used to}} engage not only with motion, but also with the materiality of things, is emphasised. This speculative project provides insights into new methods and approaches for fashion research, and contributes to the discourse on new media practices and aesthetics from a different disciplinary perspective. Informing this thesis is an approach through material knowledge of cloth gleaned from an industry background as a fashion designer. This ephemeral and pragmatic understanding of the nature of cloth is extended to unfold deeper ontological and aesthetic considerations as an <b>active</b> <b>register</b> to imagine possible future surfaces. The thesis documents a creative research practice, thinking in and through the materiality of cloth, across the processes and intersections of physical, digital, and virtual interfaces. Ontological and aesthetic frameworks that value perceptual and sensorial experiences of cloth are investigated. The aesthetics of material surfaces in the physical state are closely tied to corporeal and sensory interaction, as primary conditions of this experience. An original, innovative textile with embedded markers which enabled successful tracking of cloth in motion capture was developed. This new textile released the cloth from its physical matter by recording the specific nuances and mutability of dynamic movement using the three-dimensional space of motion capture. The cloth could be seen as pure surface, an interface that linked the physical body in digital and virtual environments. The data captured from cloth and body was used to create new virtual surfaces which explore the tactile and haptic possibilities of mixed reality spaces. The new textile was critical in considering how material can reveal the trace of the body and answering the question of how we can isolate and observe moments that Miller (2008) suggested as the cloth yielding to humanity (p. 42). Within this thesis, an approach that reconciles both the materiality and the performativity of the cloth is emphasised. Significantly, gestures and acts of embodiment used to interact with the cloth in motion capture carried over as residual information into the new mediated virtual surfaces, revealing traces of the human being within the data of virtual and digital environments. Tactility and the ‘the hand of the cloth’ can be seen within this context as a critical linkage connecting the divide between physical body and digital world. The relationship between body, clothing and environment is highlighted as mutually informative, each impressing upon and influencing the other, and the relationship between physical, digital and virtual states is revealed as similarly symbiotic and dynamic...|$|E
