500|$|Ross {{has been}} a streaky player {{throughout}} his career. He described this in 2006: [...] "I have gotten in grooves before, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> stay in {{it as long as}} you can until it ends. And it does end. I've been notorious for that my whole career, where I'll hit five or six in a week, where it seems like I can't miss the pitch and I feel good in the batter's box." [...] The most famous of these came in 2010, when Ross's torrid hitting in the playoffs helped San Francisco win the 2010 World Series.|$|E
500|$|Alistair Brownlee and Jonathan Brownlee were {{considered}} strong favourites before the race. The 2000 men's Olympic triathlon champion, Canadian Simon Whitfield, said that, [...] "If you run this Olympic race ten times, {{one of the}} Brownlee brothers will win {{nine out of ten}} times. But they won’t win it that 10th time, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> be that person to be there to capitalise on it that 10th time.” Among other contenders were Javier Gómez of Spain, who was the ITU Triathlon World Champion in both the 2008 World Championships and the 2010 World Championships; New Zealander Bevan Docherty; Whitfield of Canada and the 2008 Olympic champion Jan Frodeno from Germany.|$|E
500|$|Another {{recurrent}} {{theme in}} the album is that everything is broken, out of place or missing; This is apparent in nearly all songs in the album. Examples include [...] "Fix You" [...] ("When you lose something you can't replace") and also in [...] "X" [...] ("When something is broken, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> fix it, trying to repair it, any way you can") and [...] "Talk" [...] ("Are you lost or incomplete? Do {{you feel like a}} puzzle, you can't find your missing piece?"). This theme is also reflective of the random, incomprehensible pattern on the album's cover (until you [...] "fix" [...] it using the Baudot Code).|$|E

500|$|The lyrical meaning behind [...] "Give It Away" [...] is {{centered}} on the philosophy of selflessness and altruistic behavior. The song is titled after its most prevalent lyrical phrase [...] "give it away", which is taken from an experience Kiedis had with his former girlfriend—punk rock singer Nina Hagen—in the early 1980s. Hagen was several years Kiedis' senior and became a role-model during his drug addiction to heroin: [...] "she realized how young and inexperienced I was then, so she was always passing on gems to me, not in a preachy way, just by seizing on opportunities." [...] When Kiedis was looking through her closet he came across a jacket he liked, and commented to Hagen that it was [...] "really cool". Upon expressing this, Hagen immediately told him to keep it. Her reasoning behind this selflessness was due to an attempt to constantly make her life more enjoyable, and explained to Kiedis that [...] "{{if you have a}} closet full of clothes <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> keep them all, your life will get very small. But if you have a full closet and someone sees something they like, if you give it to them, the world is a better place." ...|$|E

There's no such thing with Morricone. He hears a melody, and he writes it down. He hears the {{orchestration}} completely done", said Barry Levinson in an interview.|$|E
2500|$|Speaking {{shortly after}} the 2015 San Bernardino shooting, Hirsi Ali commented {{on the nature of}} radicalization within {{communities}} of Islamic believers saying, [...] "If we talk about the process of what we now call radicalization, that you see a process where individuals are putting on a religious identity. It's all about being a Muslim, you shed the rest of it or you downplay the rest of it <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> make everyone else as pious as yourself. And this would be, looking back at San Bernardino, the telltale signs. These changes that the family, the friends, the close circle of relatives should have observed." ...|$|E
6000|$|Jukes, {{straddling}} {{his long}} legs {{like a pair of}} compasses, put on an air of superiority. [...] "We're going to catch it this time," [...] he said.

5000|$|Those major {{organizational}} plantings of Chinese elms, cottonwoods, mulberries, sycamores {{and other}} hardy species were softened with magnolias, oaks and olives for shade and almond and plum trees for color. The landscape architect sees nothing extraordinary {{about going to}} such trouble for the dispossessed. [...] "You were conscious of social problems that existed, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> think of ways to improve them," [...] he said.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think you}} {{have no reason to}} apologize," [...] she said. [...] "They must have sent a strong guard, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> rescue your friend alone. Miguel was right; {{there was nothing to be}} done by two or three men with knives." [...] Then she paused with a {{thoughtful}} look. [...] "It seems you do not know that Miss Cliffe is safe with us." ...|$|R
2500|$|R singer-songwriter Frank Ocean {{wrote the}} ballad [...] "Scared of Beautiful" [...] for the album. Ocean {{previously}} co-wrote [...] "1st & Love" [...] and [...] "Locket (Locked in Love)" [...] with Rich King for Norwood's Human (2008) album. [...] "Scared of Beautiful" [...] was originally {{conceived as a}} duet between Norwood and Ocean, and features the duo exchanging lyrics about looking forwards and not backwards, with lines such as [...] "I wonder why there's no mirrors on these walls no more/ You can't tell me why you're so terrified of beautiful". However the final version features just Norwood. Speaking on how the song came about Norwood said, [...] "Well, he had the song {{for a while and}} when I heard it, it really just spoke to me. Sometimes you get to a point in your life where you’re scared to be great, you’re scared to be beautiful, you’re scared to be the best version of you and you talk to yourself <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> get yourself back on track. I just remember feeling like that at a point in my life. I know {{there are so many people}} out there that go through that dark time and I felt like it could speak to a lot of people." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "We {{have every}} respect for our friends the Americans. I would even stretch a point rather than chance harming an American; {{but you will}} admit that the {{evidence}} is all against you. You {{were found in the}} very building where Drontoff was known to stay while in Burgova. The young woman whose mother keeps the place directed our officer <b>to</b> your room, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> escape, which I do not think that an innocent American would have done.|$|R
2500|$|You {{all worked}} for Nazi Germany. <b>And</b> <b>you</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> offer only a passive resistance. Certainly, to buy off your {{conscience}} <b>you</b> helped here <b>and</b> there a persecuted person, but millions of innocent human beings {{were allowed to}} be murdered without any kind of protest being uttered ... first you betrayed your friends, then your children in that you let them stake their lives on a criminal war– <b>and</b> finally that <b>you</b> betrayed Germany itself, because when the war was already quite hopeless, you did not once arm yourselves against the senseless destruction of Germany.|$|R
6000|$|I {{looked at}} him with surprise. [...] "St. John," [...] I said, [...] "I think you are almost wicked to talk so. I am {{disposed}} to be as content as a queen, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> stir me up to restlessness! To what end?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Beat it or I'll run you in.

6000|$|... 'Yes, {{but not to}} take a {{share in}} doing it. Well, pray be careful. Were {{anything}} {{to happen to you}} I should know it was because you had punished the man who spoke so insultingly about me.

6000|$|... "Now, don't you be for {{overshooting}} the mark, Tookey," [...] said Mr. Macey, nodding {{his head}} aside admonishingly. [...] "That's what you're allays at; if I throw a stone and hit, you think there's summat better than hitting, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> throw a stone beyond. What I said was against the tinder-box: I said nothing against justices and constables, for they're o' King George's making, and it 'ud be ill-becoming {{a man in a}} parish office to fly out again' King George." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have but}} {{to raise my}} finger," [...] cried McGinty, [...] "and I could put two hundred men into this town that would clear it out from end to end."

You've no heart yourself, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> take the heart out of others.

50|$|I {{had enough}} {{seniority}} {{as a democrat}} to be the tax chair in the Minnesota Legislature but I was told 'Dawkins you'll never be the tax chair 'cause you pissed off the real-estate industry, you pissed off the bankers, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> do the tax stuff the right way for the little guys and they’re {{not going to let}} you be the tax chair'.
