CNTs can be classified into single-walled CNT (swCNT) and multi-walled CNT (mwCNT) depending {{on the number of}} rolled-up graphene layers. Generally, the diameter of swCNT is about 1 [*]~[*] 2  nm, and that of mwCNT varies from 2  nm to over 100  nm (Table  1). A CNT is mechanically strong and easy to be functionalized. The electrical and optical properties of CNTs can be used for various <b>applicaions</b> such as ultrasensitive biosensors. We review the recent applications of CNT-based substrates in controlling cell behaviors.|$|R

40|$|Networks on Chips (NoCs) {{have evolved}} as the {{communication}} design paradigm of future Systems on Chips (SoCs). In this work we target the NoC design of complex SoCs with heterogeneous processor/memory cores, providing Quality-of-Service (QoS) for the <b>applicaion.</b> We present an integrated approach to mapping of cores onto NoC topologies and physical planning of NoCs, where {{the position and}} size of the cores and network components are computed. Our design methodology automates NoC mapping, physical planning, topology selection, topology optimization and instantiation, bridging an important design gap in building application specific NoCs. We also present a methodology to guarantee QoS for the application during the mapping-physical planning process by satisfying the delay/jitter constraints and real-time constraints of the traffic streams. Experimental studies show large area savings (up to 2 x), bandwidth savings (up to 5 x) and network component savings (up to 2. 2 x in buffer count, 3. 8 x in number of wires, 1. 6 x in switch ports) compared to traditional design approaches...|$|E

40|$|Three {{different}} {{theoretical models}} {{for the analysis of}} movements of granular media caused by the gravity forces only are critically discused. In each of them the motion is treated as a purely kinematical problem. It has been shown that in application to varoius practical prob-lems, they lead to different displacements patterns (e. g. funnel or mass flow, formation of shear bands or a flow without such bands). Examples of <b>applicaion</b> illustrate the discussion. 1. introduction In numerous important practical problems, the movement of granular me-dia is caused by gravity forces only. The movements in bins and hoppers, sand avalanches, subsidence of terrain caused by underground exploitation are the typical examples. It seems to be reasonable to treat such motions as purely kine-matic processes. It {{is interesting to note that}} recently in physics, the movement of grains in sand piles is used as an illustration of the so-called “self-organized process ” – see e. g. [1, 2]. In these papers the analysis was limited to the move-ments of grains in a pile of sand. More applications of engineering significance have been discussed in [3], among them an analysis of movement of granula...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an efficient and simple quad edge conversion method of polygonal (manifold) objects. In {{a wide variety}} of applications such as scientific visualization, virtual reality and computer aided geometric design, polygonal objects are expected to be visualized and manipulated within a given time constraint. To achieve these expectations, it is necessary to introduce an efficient data structure as well as high performance graphics hardware and real-time processing techniques such as simplification and level of details. The quad edge data structure is very efficient for handling polygonal objects even though it was originally designed to handle the subdivisions of manifold objects such as Delaunay triangulations and Voronoi diagrams. It, however, has not been used widely because there is no efficient algorithm for quad edge conversion of conventional polygonal objects. In this paper, we propose a new incremental quad edge conversion algorithm that processes the triangles one by one. Since quad edge has only the splice as a topological operator, the quad edge conversion of each triangle is done by applying three splice operations, a splice per vertex. As an <b>applicaion</b> for the quad edge, a simplification of conventional polygonal objects is implemented. It includes the removing, moving, replacing, and inserting of vertices and edges...|$|E
40|$|Published Online: 27 January, 2016 Soybean {{cultivation}} in Mozambique {{is dominated}} by smallholder farmers who use little or no inputs such as bacterial inoculants, often resulting in low yields. This study assessed the ability of TGx and non-TGx soybean genotypes to nodulate with native rhizobia in Mozambican soils, and evaluated the yield and symbiotic response of TGx and non-TGx soybean to inoculation with Bradyrhizobium japonicum strain WB 74 at three IITA experimental sites in Mozambique. The data revealed significant inoculation, location and genotypic effects. Both TGx and non-TGx soybean genotypes showed effective nodulation in Bradyrhizobium-inoculated and uninoculated field plots. Inoculant <b>applicaion</b> increased plant growth by 32 %, %N by 18 %, N content by 45 %, %Ndfa by 11 %, fixed-N by 64 %, and grain yield by 12 % when compared to uninoculated control. Symbiotically, the soybean genotypes performed better at Ruace than at Nampula, and poorly at Mutequelesse. Genotypes TGx 1910 - 14 F, 427 / 5 / 7, TGx 1937 - 1 F and Solitaire accumulated the most biomass at Ruace and Nampula when compared to Mutequelesse, and individually contributed over 200 kg N. ha− 1 during the cropping season. However, grain yield was much higher at Nampula than at Ruace and Mutequelesse. Independent of the location, four soybean genotypes produced similar amounts of grain yield in inoculated and uninoculated plots. Whether with or without inoculation, Solitaire and TGx 1908 - 8 F each produced about 2. 0 t. ha− 1 of grain, while TGx 1910 - 14 F and TGx 1937 - 1 F yielded between 1. 5 and 1. 7 t. ha− 1. These four varieties were identified as the best for use by resource-poor farmers in Mozambique, while genotype 427 / 5 / 7, which produced about 2. 4 t. ha− 1 of grain with inoculation, was seen as ideal for well-resourced farmers.
