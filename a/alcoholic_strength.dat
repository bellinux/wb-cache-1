40|$|A {{preliminary}} {{approach to}} achieve compatible simultaneous extraction of aflatoxin and residual oil from pressed oil meals {{was conducted to}} determine the minimum amount of water {{to be added to}} ethanol versus necessary time to achieve complete removal of aflatoxin. Commercial anhydrous, 96, 93 and 90 °GL ethanol were utilized in trials with Soxhlet extractors. Commercial anhydrous ethanol did not remove aflatoxin completely and the extraction efficiency in minutes was directly proportional to the amount of water present in the ethanol, as expected. Although 96 °GL ethanol was efficient, <b>alcoholic</b> <b>strengths</b> between 96 and 99 °GL need be evaluated to improve oil extraction, provided they do not decrease aflatoxin removal efficiency...|$|R

25|$|Most whiskies {{are sold}} at or near an <b>alcoholic</b> <b>strength</b> of 40% abv, which is the {{statutory}} minimum in some countries – although the strength can vary, and cask-strength whisky may have as much as twice that alcohol percentage.|$|E
25|$|A quick {{estimate}} of the <b>alcoholic</b> <b>strength,</b> or proof, of the distillate (the ratio of alcohol to water) is often achieved by shaking a clear container of the distillate. Large bubbles with a short duration indicate a higher alcohol content, while smaller bubbles that disappear more slowly indicate lower alcohol content.|$|E
25|$|A more {{reliable}} method of determinating the <b>alcoholic</b> <b>strength</b> {{is to use}} scientific testing equipment, such as an alcoholmeter or hydrometer. A hydrometer is used {{during and after the}} fermentation process to determine the potential alcohol percent of the moonshine, whereas an alcoholmeter is used after the product has been distilled to determine the volume percent or proof.|$|E
30|$|The {{influence}} of sample volume may derive {{from a larger}} volume error at smaller volumes, rather than problems in the distillation itself. It is suggested to use volumes of more than 10  mL. This confirms our previous results on egg liqueur, which showed inacceptable precision if only 5 or 10  g of sample were used (Lachenmeier et al. 2005). While we found no significant differences for a volume of 200  mL, we believe that such high volumes should not be used, because especially for spirits and liqueurs with higher <b>alcoholic</b> <b>strengths,</b> the distillation time may {{not be sufficient to}} recover the complete amount of alcohol. For the same reason, we suggest to use a larger receiver volume than the original sample volume. The error increase due to dilution appears to be compensated by the more complete distillation.|$|R
30|$|The {{significant}} influence of distillation time (including a quadratic influence) also corroborates our previous findings (Lachenmeier et al. 2006). It is clearly deleterious {{to remove the}} receiver too early during the distillation, when the ethanol transfer is not complete. No changes in alcohol content were observable at distillation times of 80  s or longer, but we typically recommend to distil as long as just below the calibration mark of the receiver to ensure a complete distillation, e.g. also in cases of spirits with higher <b>alcoholic</b> <b>strengths</b> (such as absinthes). For the same reason, {{it appears to be}} advantageous to shake the receiver during the distillation process, which may reduce the vapour pressure of ethanol due to immediate dilution, especially {{at the start of the}} distillation, and also reduce the volume due to the volume contraction effect of ethanol–water mixtures.|$|R
40|$|A {{monoclonal}} antibody specifically recognizing dibutyl phthalate (DBP) was prepared {{based on a}} hapten (di-n-butyl- 4 -aminophthalate). After optimizing various parameters such as concentrations of antibody, coating antigen and composition of the assay buffer, an inhibition curve was plotted with the 50 % inhibition concentration value (IC 50) 33. 6 ± 2. 5 ng/mL. A low level of cross-reactivity (< 5 %) was found for other phthalate esters. Recovery tests were conducted using liquor simulant (a mixture of water and ethanol) at two fortification levels (100 ng/mL and 300 ng/mL). The recovery rates ranged from 84. 7 % to 94. 5 % with a coefficient of variation between 7. 1 % and 12. 8 %. Nine liquor samples of different <b>alcoholic</b> <b>strengths</b> were detected using the proposed measure and confirmatory analysis was performed using liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy (LC-MS). The detection results showed good consistency between the two measures and all the data above indicated that the proposed ELISA could be applied in DBP screening...|$|R
25|$|This {{blending}} may be purely quantitative: various vintages can be blended {{to achieve}} the desired volume. It can also be qualitative; the taster or a team of tasters (cellar master, winemaker, owner of the estate, etc.) {{determine the amount of}} each wine to mix together in the final blend to obtain optimum quality. In winemaking blending is always empirical, it cannot be predicted that the combination of two or more vintages will give the expected product. The only secure values are analytical values (<b>alcoholic</b> <b>strength,</b> acidity, pH, etc.).|$|E
25|$|Most {{categorical}} {{alcoholic beverages}} have regulations governing their classification and labelling, while those governing absinthe {{have always been}} conspicuously lacking. According to popular treatises from the 19th century, absinthe could be loosely categorised into several grades (ordinaire, demi-fine, fine, and Suisse—the latter does not denote origin), in order of increasing <b>alcoholic</b> <b>strength</b> and quality. Many contemporary absinthe critics simply classify absinthe as distilled or mixed, according to its production method. And while the former is generally considered far superior in quality to the latter, an absinthe's simple claim of being 'distilled' makes no guarantee as {{to the quality of}} its base ingredients or the skill of its maker.|$|E
2500|$|As {{with red}} wine-making, {{harvesting}} is manual or mechanized, and may include sorting. The grapes are then transferred into a press to be pressed. [...] Once {{the grape must}} is in the tank, the sludge is removed, normally after certain enzymes have been added. At this stage pre-fermentation cold stabulation (at temperatures between 10 and 12°C for several days) may be carried out {{in order to promote}} the extraction of aromas. [...] Normally, however, after 12 to 48 hours, the clear juice is drawn off and left to ferment. Alcoholic fermentation continues under supervision, particular attention being paid to the temperature, which must remain more or less stable (between 18 and 24 degrees Celsius). If necessary, chaptalization is also carried out in order to boost the <b>alcoholic</b> <b>strength</b> by volume. Malolactic fermentation and maturing then take place in barrels or in vats. Once this process is completed, the wine is filtered in order to clarify it. The final stage of the whole operation is the bottling of the wine.|$|E

40|$|Background: Muscle {{weakness}} and structural changes in striated skeletal muscle {{are common in}} persons with chronic alcoholism. Objective: The objective {{of the study was}} to assess the role of malnutrition in the development of chronic alcoholic myopathy. Design: We prospectively evaluated 146 men who reported an intake ≥ 100 g ethanol/d for the previous 5 y and 73 well-nourished control subjects. Alcohol consumption, energy and protein nutri-tional status, and deltoid muscle strength were determined. Del-toid muscle tissue specimens were taken from alcoholics and from 14 control subjects for histochemical studies and morphometric measurements of the fibers. Results: Deltoid muscle strength was less in alcoholics than in con-trol subjects (P < 0. 001). Muscle strength correlated with lifetime consumption of ethanol (r = 0. 56, P < 0. 001), and a decrease in muscle strength was significantly greater in the presence of energy malnutrition. Using logistic regression analysis, we observed that <b>alcoholics</b> with muscle <b>strength</b> < 18 kg had the independent risk fac...|$|R
2500|$|The {{names of}} pulquerias are {{considered}} to be important for their identity and are often representative of contemporary popular culture in Mexico. They not only told the customers what to expect from that particular establishment, but also made references to popular literature, the theater, as well as international figures or events. Opera titles such as Norma, Semiramide, and La Traviata were in use, as were literary figures, Don Quixote and The Hunchback of Notre Dame, among others. More romantic and militant names like The Great Napoleon and Mexico's Former Glories were also common. More bizarre names included Get out if you Can and The Assault Barrels of pulque were also given different names depending on their flavor or <b>alcoholic</b> <b>strength,</b> such as the [...] "pulque of the tough ones" [...] or the [...] "whining female". Many of the names written {{on the walls of the}} outside of the pulquerias were misspelled, which is thought to be a testimony to the low literacy rates in Mexico at the time.|$|E
60|$|Stephen dissented openly from Bloom's {{views on}} the {{importance}} of dietary and civic selfhelp while Bloom dissented tacitly from Stephen's {{views on the}} eternal affirmation of the spirit of man in literature. Bloom assented covertly to Stephen's rectification of the anachronism involved in assigning the date of the conversion of the Irish nation to christianity from druidism by Patrick son of Calpornus, son of Potitus, son of Odyssus, sent by pope Celestine I in the year 432 in the reign of Leary to the year 260 or thereabouts in the reign of Cormac MacArt (died 266 A.D.), suffocated by imperfect deglutition of aliment at Sletty and interred at Rossnaree. The collapse which Bloom ascribed to gastric inanition and certain chemical compounds of varying degrees of adulteration and <b>alcoholic</b> <b>strength,</b> accelerated by mental exertion and the velocity of rapid circular motion in a relaxing atmosphere, Stephen attributed to the reapparition of a matutinal cloud (perceived by both from two different points of observation Sandycove and Dublin) at first no bigger than a woman's hand.|$|E
6000|$|Lastly of {{the wine}} Canary, now unknown to the English market, where it had a local {{habitation}} and a name as early as madeira and sherry, all claiming 'Shakespearean recognition.' The Elizabethans constantly allude to cups of cool Canary, and Mr. Vizetelly quotes Howell's 'Familiar Letters,' wherein he applies to this far-famed sack the dictum 'Good wine sendeth a man to heaven.' But I cannot agree with the learned oenologist, or with the 'tradition of Tenerife,' when told that 'the original canary was a sweet and not a dry wine, as those who derive [...] "sack" [...] from the French word [...] "sec" [...] would have us believe.' 'Sherris sack' (jerez seco) was a harsh, dry wine, which was sugared as we sweeten tea. Hence Poins addresses Falstaff as 'Sir John Sack and Sugar;' and the latter remarks, 'If sack and sugar be a fault, God help the wicked!' And the island probably had two growths--the saccharine Malvasia, [Footnote: As we find in Leake (p. 197 Researches in Greece) and Henderson (History of Wines) 'Malvasia' is an Italian corruption of 'Monemvasia' ([Greek: monae embasia]--a single entrance), the neo-Greek name for the Minoa promontory or island connected by a bridge with the Laconian Coast. Hence the French Malvoisie and our Malmsey. Prof. Azevedo (loc. cit.) opines that the date {{of the wine}}'s introduction disproves the legend of that 'maudlin Clarence in his Malmsey butt.'] whose black grape was almost a raisin, and a harsh produce like that of the modern Gual, with great volume and <b>alcoholic</b> <b>strength,</b> but requiring time to make it palatable.|$|E
