These included Lower Canada (present-day Quebec) and Vancouver Island, where Governor James Douglas encouraged black immigration because of his opposition to slavery. He also hoped a significant black community would form a bulwark against those who wished to unite the island with the United States.|$|E

Grasses here include bluestems, along with many other species. Historically, many areas of the Midwest that are now forested were once tallgrass prairie. Fire is very important in maintaining the prairie. Without it, many areas can become forested.|$|E

25|$|Cistercian monasteries have {{continued}} to spread, with many founded outside Europe in the 20th century.

In 1940, there were six Trappist monasteries in Asia and the Pacific, only one Trappist monastery in Africa, and none in Latin <b>America.</b> <b>Now</b> there are 13 in Central and South America, 17 in Africa, and 23 in Asia and the Pacific.

25|$|Economic {{turmoil and}} the {{suspicious}} {{eye of the}} dictatorial regimes in place reduced the genre's dynamism for the following decade. In the mid-1980s, it became increasingly popular once more. Although led by Argentina, Brazil and Mexico, Latin <b>America</b> <b>now</b> hosts dedicated communities and writers with an increasing use of regional elements to set them apart from English-language science-fiction. Bolivian scifi started with Emeterio Villamil de Rada´s 1888 story La lengua de Adán y el hombre de Tiahuanago  which argues that Aymara was the first language in the world. As is recurrent in latin-americas SciFi literature Bolivia has its own dystopian and Utopian examples with Vertigo by female writer Adela Zamudio (1901) and Platonia by José Aguirre Achá (1928).|$|E
25|$|On 5 January 1979, The New York Times {{published}} an article by David Vidal, who claimed {{that the number of}} disappeared in Latin <b>America</b> <b>now</b> numbered 30,000. The Christian Science Monitor and The Boston Globe followed suit with similar articles claiming that 30,000 people had disappeared under military dictatorships in Latin America. The Los Angeles Times repeated the claims of 30,000 Latin Americans disappeared in a new article in October and November of that year. In May 1980, the Montreal Gazette, {{in an interview with the}} sister of the slain guerrilla commander Ernesto (Che) Guevara, Cecilia Guevara, said that in Argentina alone more 30,000 people had disappeared and another 15,000 had been imprisoned.|$|E

25|$|The duck {{has long}} been {{recognised}} as a distinct taxon, with its affinities previously considered {{to be with the}} teals. Robert Cushman Murphy was the first to demonstrate that it is a pintail, its closest relatives the yellow-billed pintails of South <b>America</b> (<b>now</b> split as the Chilean pintail A. g. spinicauda and the extinct Niceforo's pintail A. g. niceforoi), though he retained it as a full species for its isolated distribution and its 16 (rather than 14) rectrices, or tail feathers. However, the number of retrices in the ducks is variable, with many mainland pintails also having 16 retrices and a few South Georgia pintails even having 18, and the three ducks are now usually lumped as the yellow-billed pintail.|$|E
25|$|The 2010 Alaska Turbine Otter {{crash was}} a fatal {{accident}} that occurred on August 9, 2010, when a privately operated amphibious floatplane crashed near Aleknagik, Alaska, killing {{five of the}} nine passengers and crew.

25|$|After {{sitting in}} {{disrepair}} {{for quite some}} time, Fort Malden was once again used to house military personnel and launch military operations to quell the Upper Canada Rebellion. Most of Fort Malden's involvement dealt with defending Upper Canada from American sympathizers belonging to Hunters' Lodges, who were frequently embarking on border raids along the Detroit River. As a result of <b>America</b> <b>now</b> posing a real threat to the sovereignty of Upper Canada, Fort Malden underwent a period of development where several buildings were constructed and military earthworks repaired. Much of this development was conducted {{under the supervision of}} Major H.D. Townshend in 1838, with the 24th and 32nd Regiment occupying the Fort. During this period, there were three regiments, including the Royal Artillery, stationed at Fort Malden to act as a defence against a possible American invasion.|$|E

25|$|In 1937, Schaeffer {{transferred}} to Faith Theological Seminary, graduating in 1938.

Schaeffer was the first student to graduate and the first to be ordained in the Bible Presbyterian Church. He served pastorates in Pennsylvania (Grove City and Chester) and St. Louis, Missouri. Schaeffer eventually sided with the Bible Presbyterian Church Columbus Synod following the BPC Collingswood and BPC Columbus Split and became a member of the Reformed Presbyterian Church, Evangelical Synod when the Bible Presbyterian Church's Columbus Synod merged with the Reformed Presbyterian Church's Columbus Synod in 1965, a denomination which would merge with the Presbyterian Church in America, in 1982.|$|E
25|$|In 1894 {{congress}} passed the Heard Act which required surety bonds on all federally funded projects.

SFAA is a licensed rating or advisory organization in all states and is designated by state insurance departments as a statistical agent for the reporting of fidelity and surety experience. The SFAA is a trade association consisting of companies that collectively write the majority of surety and fidelity bonds in the United States. Then in 1935 the Miller Act was passed replacing the Heard Act. The Miller Act is the current federal law mandating the use of surety bonds on federally funded projects.|$|E
