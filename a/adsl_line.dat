40|$|Abstract—Nowadays, Peer to Peer {{systems are}} largely studied. But {{in order to}} {{evaluate}} them in a realistic way, a better knowl-edge of their environments is needed. In this article {{we focus on the}} computers availability in these systems. We characterize this availability behind <b>ADSL</b> <b>lines</b> and we link it with the availability of Peer to Peer systems participants. We emphase on the methodology as generalized in other systems such as grids or ad-hoc systems. We finally show how users of <b>ADSL</b> <b>lines</b> are related to Peer to Peer users and we give some examples of the possible practical use of theses results. The results are based on trace datasets obtained over the first five month of 2003 with around 5000 hosts...|$|R

40|$|The {{rapid growth}} of Internet tra#c has made it {{important}} to pinpoint network bottlenecks. Measuring link bandwidths can help identifying such bottlenecks. Existing bandwidth measurement tools such as Pathchar, Bing and Bprobe assume symmetric links. But as <b>ADSL</b> <b>lines,</b> cable modems, satellite links, and 56 K modems 1 gain popularity, it becomes necessary to consider asymmetric links. We present an algorithm that can measure each hop's link bandwidth in both directions in an IP network. Hence it is trivial to detect link asymmetry. We performed several experiments to validate our algorithm. We also discuss factors that can adversely a#ect the precision and/or correctness of bandwidth measurement, and suggest some possible solutions...|$|R

For this reason customers have to pay two fees, one to STC for activation of the ADSL service across the telephone line, and a second to an ISP to provide Internet service across the <b>ADSL</b> <b>line.</b> STC has been highly criticized for their service in providing ADSL access as customers had to wait many months to receive ADSL service on their phone lines. In 2006, STC had invested in increasing {{the size of their}} ADSL infrastructure and since then the wait times had improved, but many customers are still on waiting lists.|$|E
5000|$|In South Africa ADSL is very {{expensive}} with prices well above world average. Charges consist of three parts: the <b>ADSL</b> <b>line</b> rental (Costs are R165 for a 2Mbit/s [...] "Fast" [...] line, R299 for a 4Mbit/s [...] "Faster", and R425 for the 10Mbit/s [...] "Fastest" [...] line), the regular analogue phone line rental (R157, as of August 2013, which includes a land line number) and an ISP account. The price of an ISP account can vary greatly, ranging from R23 (US$3) for 1 GB to R159 ($21) for uncapped 384kbit/s and R496 (US$61) for uncapped 4 Mbit/s. Products with caps of 3 GB, 5 GB, 10 GB, 20 GB and 30 GB are also available through various ISPs.|$|E

Although Easynet continued to offer business-grade broadband connectivity products, UKO customers could not migrate to an equivalent Easynet service, only being offered either a MAC to migrate provider or the option of becoming a customer of the residential-only Sky Broadband ISP with an introductory discounted period. Also, some previously available service features like fastpath (useful for time-critical protocols like SIP) were not made available on Sky Broadband, leaving business users with a difficult choice particularly where UK Online were the only LLU provider. Since then, Sky Broadband has become a significant player in the quad play telecoms market, offering <b>ADSL</b> <b>line</b> rental and call packages to customers (who have to pay a supplement if they are not also Sky television subscribers).|$|E

50|$|According to Eurostat, OECD and others, Internet {{access in}} Poland {{is among the}} most {{expensive}} in Europe. This is mostly caused by the lack of competitiveness and lack of know-how. New operators like Dialog and GTS Energis are making their own provider lines and offer more attractive and cheaper service. In February 2011, the Polish Office of Electronic Communication issued an order forcing the TPSA to rent 51% of their <b>ADSL</b> <b>lines</b> to other ISPs at 60% discount of their market pricing. As the result the prices are non-competitive, other ISP charge as TPSA making a guaranteed 40% profit, while TPSA has no incentive to lower its consumer prices, because it would result in lowering of wholesale prices as well.|$|R

50|$|The Internet in Latvia {{began to}} {{experience}} significant growth in 1999, as {{the consolidation of}} regional Internet providers began to drive down prices for dial-up access. By 2000, there were 75,000 Internet users and about a dozen e-commerce shops in Latvia. Back then the average salary for a web programmer was 500Ls/month. High-speed access costs remained prohibitive; for example, an ADSL service was introduced in July 2000 and planned to charge a monthly fee of 50,00Ls. By 2003, however, only 5.4% of Latvians used the Internet at home, and 60% did not use it at all; those who did instead accessed it in public areas or through their place of work, as high subscription prices for home usage remained a barrier. By 2008, access prices had fallen to 11,90Ls (€17) per month for the Lattelecom <b>ADSL</b> <b>line.</b> By July 2015, 79,2% of the population use internet at home. Latvia has the 7th fastest internet in the world.|$|E
5000|$|In September 2009, Durban company Unlimited IT {{reportedly}} pitted {{a messenger}} pigeon against South African ISP Telkom to transfer 4 GB of data 60 mi from Howick to Durban. The pigeon, carrying {{the data on}} a memory stick, arrived in one hour eight minutes, with the data taking another hour to read from the memory stick. During the same two-hour period, only about 4.2% of the data had been transferred over the ADSL link. A similar experiment was conducted in England in September 2010; the [...] "pigeonnet" [...] also proved superior. In November 2009 the Australian comedy/current-affairs television program Hungry Beast repeated this experiment. The experiment had the team transfer a 700 MB file via three delivery methods to determine which was the fastest; A carrier pigeon with a microSD card, a car carrying a USB Stick, or a Telstra <b>ADSL</b> <b>line.</b> The data was to be transferred a distance of 132 km by road.

50|$|While today not a problem,One of {{the issues}} which the SVU faced during its launch phase {{was the lack of}} a proper {{broad-band}} Internet infrastructure in Syria. This {{can be viewed as a}} strategic problem, as it hinders potential students. Faced with the terrible performance of the teleconferencing software on Dial-Up (then the only available option), the university created a number of telecenters (at a great expense) in various Syrian governorates so that students who didn't have broadband Internet (virtually all of them) could attend their lessons comfortably. With the introduction of ADSL and ISDN in 2004, it was hoped that the severity of the problem would be ameliorated. Unfortunately, the situation has not improved much: up to the end of 2007, ADSL is not yet available to students and the general public. Subscriptions are fewer than 5000 in number all over Syria and the cost for any potential adopter is too high (the actual going rate for an <b>ADSL</b> <b>line</b> is almost $1000, due to unavailability and very great demand by Internet Cafes). ISDN, while difficult to attain in many areas, is more publicly available than ADSL, and thus is the only option for Syrian SVU students who wish to attend lessons from their homes. Most Syrian SVU students, however, attend their lessons from a local telecenter.|$|E

The vDSL modem now plugs directly into the RJ11 socket on the faceplate. The faceplate can be easily fitted by removing the two bottom screws on a NTE5, sliding the bottom section out and fitting this in between. The result is that the entire extension circuit is filtered by the vDSL plate meaning that there is now no need for DSL filters on every Telephone Socket in the house. This product can also be fitted to <b>ADSL</b> <b>lines</b> and has been shown to improve connection speeds for vDSL and aDSL customers alike.|$|R
40|$|Access and {{aggregation}} networks account nowadays for a {{large share}} of the consumed energy in communication networks, and actions to ameliorate their energy cost are under investigation by the research community. In this work, we present a study of the possible savings that could be achieved if such technologies were in place. We take advantage of large datasets of measurements collected from the network of FASTWEB, a national-wide Internet Service Provider in Italy. We first perform a detailed characterization of the energy consumption of Points of Presence (PoPs) investigating on how factors such as external temperature, cooling technology and traffic load influence the consumed energy. Our mea- surements precisely quantify how the power consumption in today networks is practically independent from the traffic volume, while it is correlated only with the external temper- ature. We then narrow down our analysis to consider the traffic generated by each house- hold. More specifically, by observing about 10, 000 ADSL customers, we characterize the typical traffic patterns generated by users who access the Internet. Using the available real data, we thus investigate if the energy consumption can be sig- nificantly reduced by applying simple energy-efficient policies that are currently under studies. We investigate energy-to-traffic proportional and resource consolidation technol- ogies for the PoP, while sleep modes policies are considered at the <b>ADSL</b> <b>lines.</b> All these energy-efficient policies, even if they are not yet available, are currently being widely investigated by both manufacturers and researchers. At the PoP level, our dataset shows that {{it would be possible to}} save up to 50 % of energy, and that even simple mechanisms would easily allow to save 30 % of energy. Considering the <b>ADSL</b> <b>lines,</b> it results that sleep mode policies can be effectively implemented, reducing the energy consumption of ADSL modems with little or marginal impact on the Quality of Service offered to users. We make available all datasets used in this paper to allow other researchers to benchmark their pro- posals considering actual traffic trace...|$|R
