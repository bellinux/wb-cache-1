Thereafter they were employed by the voivode who appointed and dismissed them at will. Only the heads of Szolnok County remained directly connected to the monarchs for a longer period, until their office was united with the voivodeship in the 1260s. Similarly, the voivodes were simultaneously the ispáns of the nearby <b>Arad</b> <b>County</b> between 1321 and 1412.|$|E

Researches were carried out on 3988 milk samples collected from a severalcollecting points and dairy farms from Timiş, <b>Arad</b> and Caraş-Severin <b>counties.</b> Monthly, two samples were collected at least from each farm or collecting point. Chemical composition and somatic cell count (SCC) were determined on eachsample. In Timiş and <b>Arad</b> <b>counties</b> the milk was significantly lower in total solidsthan in Caraş-Severin County (12. 6 % vs. 13. 2 %), but somatic cell count was higher,exceeding the higher limits admitted by the norms.

Chemical composition gets better from year to year, except for the milk fatpercentage that was similar throughout the study period.

The church grew rapidly and it was declared illegal in 1923, presumably due to internal divisions within the church regarding its basic convictions, shared only by a few [...] "initiated" [...] individuals. Still, growth continued, but appeals for official status were denied in 1924 and 1929.

40|$|This {{paper is}} a {{demographic}} {{comparative study of}} two neighboring regions along {{the southern part of}} the Romanian-Hungarian border region, which serves as a fundament for further analyses concerning the verification of cohesion between the two parts of the border. We have concluded our study with the statement that in spite of its traditionally low population increase, the Romanian Timiş and <b>Arad</b> <b>counties</b> have a more advantageous demographical condition than the neighboring Hungarian Békés and Csongrád counties, which can be described as having a generalized demographical decline. Though in Romania the Banat region for many decades is classified as a crisis-zone from a demographical point of view, it can show off an impressive attractiveness in terms of inner-migration in contrast to its Hungarian neighbors. In contrast with the northern part of the Romanian-Hungarian border, in this region the border strip does not overlap with a socio-economic periphery, because this phenomenon is more scattered in space...|$|R
