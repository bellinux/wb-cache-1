5|$|A {{supportive}} {{environment and}} family generally gives those with Tourette's {{the skills to}} manage the disorder. People with Tourette's may learn to camouflage socially inappropriate tics or to channel the energy of their tics into a functional endeavor. Accomplished musicians, athletes, public speakers, and professionals {{from all walks of}} life are found among people with Tourette's. Outcomes in adulthood are associated more with the perceived significance of having severe tics as a child than with the actual severity of the tics. <b>A</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> misunderstood, punished, or teased at home or at school will fare worse than children who enjoyed an understanding and supportive environment.|$|E

5|$|The {{election}} judge certifies {{his or her}} decision, {{which is}} final, to the Prime Minister.

25|$|A {{considerable}} amount of lore about fairies revolves around changelings, fairy children left {{in the place of}} stolen human babies. In particular, folklore describes how to prevent the fairies from stealing babies and substituting changelings, and abducting older people as well. The theme of the swapped child is common in medieval literature and reflects concern over infants thought to be afflicted with unexplained diseases, disorders, or developmental disabilities. In pre-industrial Europe, a peasant family's subsistence frequently depended upon the productive labor of each member, and <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> a permanent drain on the family's scarce resources could pose a threat to the survival of the entire family.|$|E

25|$|In July 2016, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) {{issued a}} report stating that between 2010 and 2015, US Poison Centers {{received}} 660 reports of exposure to kratom.

One death was reported in <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> exposed to the medications paroxetine (an antidepressant) and lamotrigine (an anticonvulsant and mood stabilizer) in addition to kratom.

25|$|However, {{since the}} (traditional) Chinese zodiac follows the (lunisolar) Chinese calendar, the switch-over date is the Chinese New Year, not January 1 {{as in the}} Gregorian calendar. Therefore, <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> born in January or early February may have {{the sign of the}} {{previous}} year. For example, if a person was born in January 1970, his or her element would still be Yin Earth, not Yang Metal. Similarly, although 1990 was called the year of the Horse, anyone born from January 1 to January 26, 1990, was in fact born in the Year of the Snake (the sign of the previous year), because the 1990 Year of the Horse did not begin until January 27, 1990. For this reason, many online sign calculators (and Chinese restaurant place mats) may give a person the wrong sign if he/she was born in January or early February.|$|E
