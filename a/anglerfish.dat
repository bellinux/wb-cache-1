5|$|Bioluminescence {{is used by}} {{a variety}} of animals to mimic other species. Many species of deep sea fish such as the <b>anglerfish</b> and dragonfish make use of {{aggressive}} mimicry to attract prey. They have an appendage on their heads called an esca that contains bioluminescent bacteria able to produce a long-lasting glow which the fish can control. The glowing esca is dangled or waved about to lure small animals to within striking distance of the fish.|$|E
5|$|Most {{fish are}} ectothermic ("cold-blooded"), {{allowing}} their body temperatures to vary as ambient temperatures change, {{though some of}} the large active swimmers like white shark and tuna can hold a higher core temperature. Fish are abundant in most bodies of water. They can be found in nearly all aquatic environments, from high mountain streams (e.g., char and gudgeon) to the abyssal and even hadal depths of the deepest oceans (e.g., gulpers and <b>anglerfish).</b> With 33,600 described species, fish exhibit greater species diversity than any other group of vertebrates.|$|E
5|$|Patrick {{gets on the}} bus to go {{home but}} accidentally leaves SpongeBob behind. After several {{unsuccessful}} attempts {{to get on the}} bus, SpongeBob heads to a bus station and waits in a very long line. By the time he reaches the front, he finds out that the next bus leaves in 5 seconds; he misses it, then learns that it was the last one and he is stuck there until morning. He becomes frightened by a raspberry sound coming from off in the distance, and he dashes back to the cliff in terror. Finally, the raspberry sound's maker is revealed to be a friendly-looking <b>anglerfish</b> creature, who has retrieved SpongeBob's glove balloon. The creature blows up the balloon and ties it to SpongeBob's wrist, which allows him to rise up the cliff and float back to Bikini Bottom. The episode ends with Patrick {{on his way back to}} Rock Bottom, thinking SpongeBob is still there.|$|E
50|$|They {{are easily}} {{distinguished}} from other <b>anglerfishes</b> by their {{possession of a}} second light-bearing dorsal fin spine immediately behind the illicium (the bioluminescent lure present in other <b>anglerfishes).</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{psychedelic}} frogfish {{is different}} from many other <b>anglerfishes</b> in {{that it has a}} tiny luring appendage on its forehead. It has a relatively flat face with a mouth smaller than that of most <b>anglerfishes.</b>|$|R

5|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} portrays Gaga as a doomed starlet, hounded by photographers, who is almost killed by her boyfriend. It shows her survival, comeback, revenge on her boyfriend, and experiences {{on the way}} to fame. The video won two MTV Video Music Awards in 2009 for Best Art Direction and Best Special Effects. Gaga also performed the song at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards in a performance art piece symbolizing the negative effect of fame leading to death. Additional live performances of the song include on The Fame Ball Tour, where it was the opening song, on an October 2009 episode of Saturday Night Live and on The Monster Ball Tour. On the first leg of the tour, she appeared as a Rapunzel-like character; from the second leg onward, she performed the song alongside a giant <b>anglerfish</b> ("The Fame Monster") who, attempting to devour her, was killed after her leotard shot sparks into the creature.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} {{different}} mating systems among teleosts. Some species are promiscuous, where {{both males and}} females breed with multiple partners and there are no obvious mate choices. This has been recorded in Baltic herring, guppies, Nassau groupers, humbug damselfish, cichlids and creole wrasses. Polygamy, where one sex has multiple partners can come in many forms. Polyandry consists of one adult female breeding with multiple males, which only breed with that female. This is rare among teleosts, and fish in general, but is found in the clownfish. In addition, it may also exist to an extent among <b>anglerfish,</b> where some females have more than one male attached to them. Polygyny, where one male breeds with multiple females, is much more common. This is recorded in sculpins, sunfish, darters, damselfish and cichlids where multiple females may visit a territorial male that guards and takes care of eggs and young. Polygyny may also involve a male guarding a harem of several females. This occurs in coral reef species, such as damselfishes, wrasses, parrotfishes, surgeonfishes, triggerfishes and tilefishes.|$|E
25|$|The jaw {{and stomach}} of the <b>anglerfish</b> can extend {{to allow it}} to consume prey up to twice its size. Because of the small amount of food {{available}} in the anglerfish's environment this adaptation allows the <b>anglerfish</b> to store food when there is an abundance.|$|E
5000|$|As in many <b>anglerfishes,</b> {{the female}} {{is much larger}} than the male. Females can reach 18 centimeters long, while males are less than 3 centimeters. This fish has a head that is deeper than long, split {{vertically}} by the mouth. The eyes are tiny. Like other <b>anglerfishes,</b> it has an illicium, the [...] "fishing lure". Live specimens are black in color.|$|R
50|$|The sea toads and coffinfishes are {{a family}} of deep-sea <b>anglerfishes</b> known as the Chaunacidae.|$|R
50|$|Double anglers are a family, Diceratiidae, of <b>anglerfishes.</b> They {{are found}} in deep, lightless waters of the Atlantic, Indian and western Pacific Oceans.|$|R
25|$|<b>Anglerfish</b> {{are named}} for their {{characteristic}} method of predation. <b>Anglerfish</b> typically {{have at least}} one long filament (the illicium) sprouting {{from the middle of the}} head, protruding above the fish's eyes and terminating in an irregular growth of flesh (the esca) at the tip of the filament. The filament can move in all directions and the esca can be wiggled so as to resemble a prey animal, thus acting as bait to lure other predators close enough for the <b>anglerfish</b> to devour them. Some deep-sea anglerfishes of the bathypelagic zone emit light from their escas to attract prey. This bioluminescence is a result of symbiosis with bacteria.|$|E

50|$|Brachionichthys was, until recently, {{the only}} genus {{in the family}} Brachionichthyidae (commonly known as handfishes), but {{presently}} five genera are placed in this family of <b>anglerfishes.</b>|$|R
50|$|Coelophrys is a genus of fishes in {{the family}} Ogcocephalidae, one of the {{families}} of <b>anglerfishes.</b> They are distributed in the western Pacific Ocean and the Indian Ocean.|$|R
25|$|Uniquely amongst deep-sea <b>anglerfish,</b> adult Thaumatichthys are benthic in nature; T. binghami and T. pagidostomus {{are found}} on the {{continental}} shelf between 1,0002,000m, while T. axeli {{is found in the}} abyssal zone at about 3,600 m.|$|E
25|$|Some <b>anglerfish</b> {{are also}} notable for extreme sexual {{dimorphism}} and sexual symbiosis {{of the small}} male with the much larger female, seen in the suborder Ceratioidei. In these species, males may be several orders of magnitude smaller than females.|$|E
25|$|It is {{not easy}} finding a mate in this zone. Some species depend on bioluminescence. Others are hermaphrodites, which doubles their chances of {{producing}} both eggs and sperm when an encounter occurs. The female <b>anglerfish</b> releases pheromones to attract tiny males. When a male finds her, he bites on to her and never lets go. When a male of the <b>anglerfish</b> species Haplophryne mollis bites into {{the skin of a}} female, he release an enzyme that digests the skin of his mouth and her body, fusing the pair {{to the point where the}} two circulatory systems join up. The male then atrophies into nothing more than a pair of gonads. This extreme sexual dimorphism ensures that, when the female is ready to spawn, she has a mate immediately available.|$|E
50|$|As {{in other}} <b>anglerfishes,</b> the male {{is very much}} smaller than the female, and after a larval and {{adolescent}} free-living stage, spends {{the rest of his life}} parasitically attached to a female.|$|R
50|$|They are {{distinguished}} from other <b>anglerfishes</b> {{by the lack}} of the expanded escal bulb — the bioluminescent lure {{at the end of the}} illicium — and by their very long dorsal and anal fin rays.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Anglerfishes</b> are fish of the teleost order Lophiiformes [...] They are bony fish {{named for}} their {{characteristic}} mode of predation, {{in which a}} fleshy growth from the fish's head (the esca or illicium) acts as a lure.|$|R
25|$|<b>Anglerfish</b> occur worldwide. Some are pelagic (dwelling {{away from}} the sea floor), while others are benthic (dwelling close to the sea floor); some live in the deep sea (e.g., Ceratiidae), while others on the {{continental}} shelf (e.g., the frogfishes Antennariidae and the monkfish/goosefish Lophiidae). Pelagic forms are most laterally compressed, whereas the benthic forms are often extremely dorsoventrally compressed (depressed), often with large upward-pointing mouths.|$|E
25|$|In many animals, {{males are}} {{much smaller than}} females. In some species of <b>anglerfish,</b> such as Ceratias holboelli, the males are so small they have become sexual parasites, wholly {{dependent}} on females of their own species for survival, and unable to fend for themselves. The female nourishes the male and protects him from predators, while the male gives nothing back except the sperm that the female needs to produce the next generation.|$|E
25|$|Another in situ {{observation}} {{of three different}} whipnose <b>anglerfish</b> showed unusual upside-down swimming behavior. Fish were observed floating upside-down completely motionless with the illicium hanging down stiffly in a slight arch {{in front of the}} fish. The illicium was hanging over small visible burrows. It was suggested this is an effort to entice prey and an example of low-energy opportunistic foraging and predation. When the ROV approached the fish, they exhibited burst swimming, still upside-down.|$|E
50|$|As {{in other}} <b>anglerfishes,</b> males are one-tenth {{the size of}} females and, after larval and {{adolescent}} free-living stages, {{spend the rest of}} their lives parasitically attached to a female. The fanfin has a small, spherical body with long protuberances.|$|R
50|$|The {{function}} of the hyoid barbel in the horned lantern fish is unknown. The only other deep-sea <b>anglerfishes</b> that have a hyoid barbel are the linophrynids, where it occurs only in the females and is often elaborate and/or bioluminescent.|$|R
50|$|Goosefishes or {{monkfishes}} are <b>anglerfishes</b> in {{the family}} Lophiidae found in the Arctic, Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Oceans, where they live on sandy and muddy bottoms of the continental shelf and continental slope, at depths in excess of 1000 m.|$|R
25|$|Symbiosis is not {{the only}} method of {{reproduction}} in <b>anglerfish.</b> In fact, many families, including the Melanocetidae, Himantolophidae, Diceratiidae, and Gigantactinidae, show no evidence of male symbiosis. Females in some of these species contain large, developed ovaries and free-living males have large testes, suggesting these sexually mature individuals may spawn during a temporary sexual attachment that does not involve fusion of tissue. Males in these species also have well-toothed jaws that are far more effective in hunting than those seen in symbiotic species.|$|E
25|$|In most species, a {{wide mouth}} extends {{all around the}} {{anterior}} circumference of the head, and bands of inwardly inclined teeth line both jaws. The teeth can be depressed so as to offer no impediment to an object gliding towards the stomach, but prevent its escape from the mouth. The <b>anglerfish</b> is able to distend both its jaw and its stomach, since its bones are thin and flexible, to enormous size, allowing it to swallow prey up to {{twice as large as}} its entire body.|$|E
25|$|Like Cornwall, Wales and Ireland, {{the waters}} of Brittany attract marine animals {{including}} basking sharks, grey seals, leatherback turtles, dolphins, porpoises, jellyfish, crabs and lobsters. Bass is common along the coast, small-spotted catsharks live on the continental shelf, rattails and <b>anglerfish</b> populate the deep waters. River fish of note include trout, Atlantic salmon, pikes, shades and lampreys. The Breton rivers are also home to beavers and otters and to some invasive American species, such as the coypu which destroys the ecosystem and accelerated the extinction of the European mink.|$|E
