50|$|The Star Watch Case Company {{manufactured}} <b>watch</b> cases. <b>Watch</b> <b>movements</b> (the mechanical mechanism), the dial, hands, {{glass that}} covers {{the face of the}} watch (sometimes called the crystal), and some of the crowns (the button used to wind the watch) were made in another location and shipped to Star to <b>assemble</b> the final <b>watch</b> product. Some of the companies it made watch cases for were Manistee Watch Company, Hamilton, Longines, Elgin, Gruen, Omega and Pulsar.|$|R

5000|$|In horology, {{the company}} Jean Lassale {{designed}} a <b>watch</b> <b>movement</b> that used ball bearings {{to reduce the}} thickness of the movement. Using 0.20 mm balls, the Calibre 1200 was only 1.2 mm thick, which still is the thinnest mechanical <b>watch</b> <b>movement.</b>|$|R
50|$|For water {{resistant}} and diving Eco-Drive watches Citizen recommends a watch gasket exchange every 2 or 3 years {{to preserve their}} water resistance because watch gaskets, which form a watertight seal, degrade as they age.Further, Citizen recommends maintenance for Eco-Drive <b>watch</b> <b>movements</b> in regular intervals in order to {{extend the life of}} the <b>watch</b> <b>movement,</b> since the gears used in running <b>watch</b> <b>movements</b> are subject to slow wear.Citizen states that their lubricants for Long-Lasting Precision Equipment when used in <b>watches,</b> timepiece <b>movements</b> remain smooth for a long time as the oil does not harden even after 20 years.|$|R

25|$|Since 2000, silicon {{has found}} a new use in {{mechanical}} <b>watch</b> <b>movements.</b> Several manufacturers of mechanical <b>watch</b> <b>movements</b> have incorporated silicon parts, mainly in the escapements and balance wheel regions. Silicon hair-springs are becoming more common as are silicon escapement wheels and forks. Silicon has several desirable properties when used in these contexts; It is thermally stable, shock resistant, and requires little to no lubrication. Ulysse Nardin pioneered these applications, with Omega, Breguet, Patek, Rolex, Cartier, and Damasko following. Most of these parts for <b>watch</b> <b>movements</b> are manufactured by deep reactive-ion etching (DRIE).|$|R
50|$|Bachner {{partnered with}} William Rath in 1905-06 {{to enter into}} a {{contract}} with Manistee city officials to build a manufacturing plant there. The city put up a portion of a $50,000 bond issue to help construct the brick-built watch factory on park land adjacent to Manistee Lake at 123 Arthur Street. The three-story factory was built in 1908 and started watch production in March 1909. The first <b>watch</b> <b>movements</b> were 18 size and had 7 jewels. Rath was the president of the new company and Bachner was its general manager. Other directors of the factory were F.A. Bingham, Thomas J. Ramsdell, and Patrick Noud. The first floor housed the presses, drills, and lathes that formed the small watch parts and the second floor had the machines used by the employees to <b>assemble</b> the <b>watch</b> mechanisms. The third floor employees carried out assembly line inspections and any final assembly work that was required including adjusting. At the peak of production in 1909 there were 90 employees making 100 mechanisms per day. The factory put out 5 grades of <b>watch</b> <b>movements,</b> being 5 jewels, 7 jewels, 15 jewels, 17 jewels, and 21 jewels.|$|R
