40|$|Introduction: The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the setting of MTA with and without the {{application}} of a moist cotton pellet. Methods: Fifty samples of MTA were mixed according to manufacturerâ€™s instructions, placed with an <b>amalgam</b> <b>carrier,</b> and condensed with a plugger into a custom metal block with a well depth of 3. 5 mm. Twenty-five of the MTA samples had a moist cotton pellet placed in contact with MTA mixture and twenty-five MTA samples had no moist cotton pellet in contact with the MTA mixture. The samples were placed in 100...|$|E
40|$|Several {{different}} {{techniques for}} placing calcium hydroxide into root canals have been proposed, such as <b>amalgam</b> <b>carriers,</b> vertical pluggers, McSpadden compactors, Lentulo drills, files and special syringes. Because correct filling {{of the root}} canal is necessary for calcium hydroxide paste to act effectively, {{the aim of this}} research was to study different techniques of root canal filling with calcium hydroxide pastes in dog teeth. The placement of calcium hydroxide with a file, absorbent paper points and vertical pluggers presented the lowest number of empty spaces in the three thirds of the root canal, followed by the Lentulo drill and the McSpadden compactor. Key Words: calcium hydroxide, intracanal dressing, techniques for placement of dressings...|$|R
40|$|A duplex Radio Over Fibre (ROF) ring {{architecture}} is proposed {{taking into account}} the constraints imposed by the cost of fibre laying and of the optical/electronic components, as well as the spectral efficiency and the duplex link performance. It has been shown that relying on Analogue ROF (AROF) and state-of-the-art Digitized ROF (DROF) architectures for downlink and uplink transmission, respectively, attains a high-integrity duplex performance. A sophisticated <b>amalgam</b> of Optical <b>Carrier</b> Suppression (OCS), Code Division Multiplexing (CDM), optical frequency multiplexing, Optical Carrier Reuse (OCR) and distributed antennas is conceived...|$|R
