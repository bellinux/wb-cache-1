2500|$|In December 1996, the CPA {{informed}} the President that for 1997 the CPF Board had budgeted for capital expenditure of S$27 million, which exceeded its operating surplus of $23 million. Although the intention {{was for the}} excess of $4 million to be funded out of the Board's accumulated surpluses, because a general election was due in 1997 the Board's accumulated surpluses would become past reserves and require the President's approval to be drawn upon. The Government explained that the CPF Board's accounts were prepared on an accrual basis. Thus, capital expenditure was depreciated over the useful life of each asset and not indicated as a lump sum {{in the year of}} expenditure. The Board's operating surplus of $23 million had been computed on the basis of annual depreciation of $11 million being charged against the year's income. Hence, no drawdown on past reserves was required. The President expressed concern that <b>accrual</b> <b>accounting</b> would [...] "allow a profligate Government to hide its lavish spending under the guise of capital expenditures". The Government disagreed, taking the view that <b>accrual</b> <b>accounting</b> was well established.|$|E

The role of <b>accruals</b> <b>accounting</b> {{in the operation of}} the service, particularly {{as it relates to the}} capital asset base of the Trusts and how these are managed, is discussed in the context that Trusts are autonomous units that develop services, and hence their capital asset base, through their own internal planning structure. It is found that, on devolution, there was a lack of consistent information about the stock of capital assets and that capital charges, based on <b>accruals</b> <b>accounting,</b> were not penetrating asset management within individual Trusts. Although strategies were being developed centrally, their implementation at a Trust level can be impeded as a consequence of <b>accruals</b> <b>accounting...</b>|$|R

According to our results, “rational” elements such as complexity, types of activities performed, presence of surpluses, and access to capital markets are seemingly unhelpful in explaining why a LG decides to introduce <b>accruals</b> <b>accounting.</b> What counts are “institutional” and cultural explanations, such as the perceptions of CFOs and the north-south divide...|$|R

40|$|As part of ‘New Public Management’ in the UK, {{changes have}} been made to the {{accounting}} regime. These changes typically involve the adoption of private sector accounting and budgeting approaches using <b>accruals</b> <b>accounting.</b> The process by which new ideas are spread is known as diffusion; this paper deals with the aspect of diffusion relating to the imposition of a new idea, <b>accruals</b> <b>accounting,</b> and how it is absorbed by the organisation, in this case the NHS in Wales. In particular, the paper questions whether the lack of secondary diffusion is limiting the influence of the new accounting approach. To analyse the level of diffusion we have focused on one aspect, namely, information on capital assets. The paper uses a mixture of qualitative and quantitative research methods including in-depth interviews with senior managers at two NHS Trusts and a questionnaire survey with responses from senior finance staff in all NHS Trusts in Wales. We conclude that the diffusion of <b>accruals</b> <b>accounting</b> for fixed assets has been restricted to the primary level at the top layer of management and has not penetrated below that level. There is evidence of continuing managerial indifference to the <b>accruals</b> <b>accounting</b> consequences of owning fixed assets...|$|R

Accordingly, we introduce the cameral accounting as an alternative framework, which allows using the money (cash) accounts to report the money effects of revenues and expenditures. By using the cameral accounts, governmental organisations can achieve their three principal objectives namely, money management, budgetary control and payment control. We believe that the preparation of financial statements using cameral accounts is much easier and flexible, particularly because cameral accounts are using the single-entry bookkeeping method...|$|R

40|$|Accounting innovations, and {{especially}} the introduction of <b>accruals</b> <b>accounting,</b> are often portrayed as fundamental aspects of public-sector reforms. An increasing body of literature has been studying the experiences of different countries and levels of government, often referring to Lueder’s (1992) “contingency model” and its subsequent developments. This model highlights a number of social, political, and administrative variables {{that are likely to}} affect government-accounting innovations. It applies at a country-wide level and is mainly intended to describe and compare the environments within which accounting reforms take place, as well as the technical features of such reforms. Our paper, on the contrary, tries to expand the contingency model by applying it to individual organisations and by testing its explanatory power. The purpose of the paper is to contribute {{to a better understanding of}} government-accounting reforms (especially those oriented towards <b>accruals</b> <b>accounting)</b> and of the factors that may explain their degree of success. Its specific focus is on Local Government accounting innovations in Italy. Our results show that information users’ and producers’ attitudes towards innovation seem to be captured by such variables as geographic location, political orientation {{and especially}} Chief Financial Officers’ own preferences, that government size is in fact an implementation barrier, while some forms of administrative fragmentation may unexpectedly play a positive role on accounting innovatio...|$|R
