In this contribution, {{we focus on}} the problem of distinguishing travel time from the time people spend performing activities (e. g. fuelling the car, standing still to watch the scenery, buying a train ticket).

FELLOWSHIP INFORMATION The Michigan Political Leadership Program (MPLP) at Michigan State University (MSU) is distinguished {{as one of}} only a handful of multi-partisan leadership training programs in the nation. Graduates take with them the knowledge and skills needed to make sound public policy decisions and to be effective leaders of the future. Applications are sought from individuals who are interested in enhancing their leadership and political skills in order to better serve communities, constituencies, or causes. The program is administered and supported by MSU's Institute for Public Policy and Social Research in the College of Social Science. Annually, a diverse group of 24 individuals are awarded the opportunity to participate in a hands-on curriculum that incorporates personal leadership development, public policy process and analysis, governance, and campaigning. Practical skills training are emphasized. Fellows participate in team and coalition-building activities to foster communication and the exchange of ideas. The MPLP faculty is comprised of elected officials, political activists, MSU faculty, media, and business professionals from across Michigan. Considerable financial resources and time are donated to support each fellowship, valued at approximately $ 12, 000. The fellowship covers the participants ' lodging, meals and program costs, however, accepted Fellows are asked to pay an administrative fee of $ 1, 000 to participate in this program.

Online Travel Guide consists of several sub-systems that designed into a complex system to facilitate the tourists visiting the tourist attraction. This final project will focus on tourism in Surabaya as a study case. A good design of the system is required to optimize it despite its novel size and complexity. System�s design including technology choosing, algorithm and system�s security. This system not only will recommend a route suggestion to tourists but also visualize it in 3 dimensional map so that the tourists seemed to be in that place. Another feature of this application is tourists can estimate the travel's budget by only inputting maximum budget of travel in this application (adaptable budget). The tourist will obtained an online lodging reservations with E-Ticketing and info of typical sales of goods in accordance with the existing budget. System budgetting feature will implement adaptable Knapsack Greedy algorithm. This algorithm was chosen because it provides {{the best of the best}} solutions regardless of the consequences in the future. This algorithm will provides two types of tour packages according to the Greedy Knapsack optimum minimum and maximum optimal. E-Ticketing System using MD 5 encryption algorithm to make the reservation code. The encryption code will be divided into three parts, the key server, public key, and Private key.

40|$|This Draft Environmental Impact Statement {{documents}} {{the analysis of}} the No Action, Proposed Action, and three action alternatives developed for the Pretty Tree Bench Project area. The Proposed Action and action alternatives considered in detail, are consistent with current management direction. Each alternative responds differently to the issues associated with the Proposed Action. The Proposed Action prescribes disturbances within a number of different vegetation types throughout the project area. One disturbance practice uses prescribed fire. The acres of treatment by vegetation type through the use of prescribed fire are: Sagebrush (200 - 250 acres), Gambel Oak (450 - 500 acres), Pinyon/Juniper (3000 - 3500 acres), Ponderosa Pine underburn (7000 acres), Mixed conifer underburn (300 - 350 acres), and Aspen regeneration burn (700 acres). A second disturbance practice that is proposed will be the commercial and non-commercial cutting of trees. Where aspen is being invaded by conifer trees, the conifer trees will be cut and removed (1000 acres). Where aspen can be commercially harvested, the aspen will be sold by bid (302 acres). The Proposed Action will also seed burn areas within the sagebrush and pinyon/juniper vegetation types, if ground cover does not establish. Native plant seed will be emphasized, but non-native plant seed can be used. Seeding will be done by hand or by aerial <b>application.</b> <b>Travel</b> management is also a part of the Proposed Action. No road construction or reconstruction would occur. The overall travel management strategy provides for a variety of vehicle uses, and describes year long and seasonal use opportunities. An OHV trail starting from the Dry Lake Trailhead and looping around Haws Pasture would be provided. The overall management would follow a closed unless designated open philosophy. Alternative I uses prescribed fire rather than commercial cutting of aspen. Alternative 2 has reduced commercial and non commercial aspen cutting by only using chainsaw disturbance outside of previously inventoried roadless areas. Alternative 3 reduces commercial aspen harvest to those areas west of the allotment fence. All action alternatives include different travel management practices. Alternatives 1 and 3 reconstruct a short portion of Road Draw Road. Alternatives 2 uses native seed for ground cover establishment in those areas that need seeding.

40|$|At present, {{customized}} subarea {{models have}} been widely used in local transportation planning throughout the United States. The biggest strengths of a subarea model lie in its more detailed and accurate modeling outputs which better meet local planning requirements. In addition, a subarea model can substantially reduce database size and model running time. In spite of these advantages, subarea models remain quite weak in maintaining consistency with a regional model, modeling transit projects, smart growth measures, air quality conformity, and other areas. Both opportunities and threats exist for subarea modeling. In addition to examining subarea models, this paper introduces the decision-making process in choosing a proper subarea modeling approach (windowing versus focusing) and software package. This study concludes that subarea modeling will become more popular in the future.

Travel times of the main propagation paths between hydrophone pairs were estimated from interferometry of ocean noise data that were collected on three L-shaped arrays off the New Jersey coast while Tropical Storm Ernesto passed nearby. Examination of the individual noise spectra and their mutual coherence reveals that the coherently propagating noise is dominated by signals of less than 100 Hz. Several time and frequency noise normalization techniques were applied to the low frequency data {{in order to determine}} the effectiveness of each technique for ocean acoustic <b>applications.</b> <b>Travel</b> times corresponding to the envelope peaks of the noise cross-correlation time derivatives of data were extracted from all three arrays, and are shown to be in agreement with the expected direct, surface-reflected, and surface-bottom-reflected interarray hydrophone travel times.

The Green's function paths that propagate horizontally are extracted from long distance shipping noise, and during the storm the more vertical paths are extracted from breaking waves. Laura A.
