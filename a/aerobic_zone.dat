Among several nutrient removal methods, biological treatment, which is a modified activated sludge system, is widely applied. However, biological nitrogen removal process, which consists of nitrification and denitrification steps, needs opposite operations at several stages such as necessity of oxygen and requirement of electron donor of organic compounds. In this study, treatment characteristics of a reactor with both sludge separation filter and airlift pump are investigated. This reactor has sludge separation filter in the middle part and airlift pump that supplies oxygen and circulate liquid from <b>aerobic</b> <b>zone</b> to anoxic zone in order to cut down the required energy. From laboratory scale experiments, design and operational parameters are investigated and it is shown that NH 4 -N loading rate of 35 mgN/(L-media･hr) at <b>aerobic</b> <b>zone</b> and DO loading rate of less than 0. 15 kgDO/(kgMLSS･d) to anoxic zone are required for stable treatment...|$|E

40|$|The hybrid {{activated}} sludge-biofilm {{system called}} Integrated Fixed Film Activated Sludge (IFAS) has recently become popular for enhanced nitrification and denitrification in <b>aerobic</b> <b>zones</b> {{because it is}} an alternative to increasing the volume of treatment plant units to accomplish year round nitrification and nitrogen removal. Biomass is retained on the fixed-film media and remains in the aerobic reactor, thus increasing the effective mean cell resident time (MCRT) of the biomass and providing the temperature sensitive, slow growing nitrifiers a means of staying in the system when they otherwise would washout. While the utilization of media in <b>aerobic</b> <b>zones</b> to enhance nitrification and denitrification {{has been the subject of}} several studies and full-scale experiments, the effects and performances of fixed film media integrated into the anoxic zones of biological nutrient removal (BNR) systems have not adequately been evaluated as well as the impacts of integrated media upon enhanced biological phosphorus removal (EBPR).

The results showed that in normal temperature seasons of 2008, after shortening the HRT of the primary sedimentation tank to 1 / 3 of design value, improving the MLSS to 4500 mg/L, setting {{the first section of}} the <b>aerobic</b> <b>zone</b> as the denitrification transition section and improving the reflux ratio, available carbon source was increased by 15 %, the effluent NH 3 -N was 2. 5 mg / L and the removal rate was 90 %, the effluent TN was 17 mg/L and the removal rate was increased to 54 % and unit power consumption was reduced by 15 % to 0. 22 Kw•h/m 3.

40|$|In this study, {{simultaneous}} denitrification {{and phosphorus}} (P) removal were investigated in batch tests using nitrified mixed liquor and secondary wastewater influent from a full-scale treatment plant and {{different levels of}} acetate and propionate as supplemental carbon sources. Without supplemental carbon source, denitrification occurred at low rate and P release and P uptake was negatively affected (i. e., P removal of only 59. 7 %). When acetate and propionate were supplied, denitrification and P release occurred simultaneously under anoxic conditions. For acetate and propionate at a C/N stoichiometric ratio of 7. 6, P release was negatively affected by denitrification. For acetate, the percent P removal and denitrification were very similar for C/N ratios of 22 (5 X stoichiometric) and 59 (10 X stoichiometric). For propionate, both percent P removal and denitrification deteriorated for C/N ratios of 22 (5 X stoichiometric) and 45 (10 X stoichiometric). It was observed that carbon source added in excess to stoichiometric ratio was consumed in the <b>aerobic</b> <b>zone,</b> but P was not taken up.

The removal rates of SS, COD and NH(4) (+) -N were 90 %, 80 %, and 90 % in effluent concentrations less than 10 mg/L, 50 mg/L and 8 mg/L, respectively. The TP removal rate was less satisfactory. The C/N ratio in the raw wastewater was often less than 3. 5, and the removal efficiency of TN was therefore limited. A carbon-release batch experiment was carried out to measure the feasibility of enhancing denitrification at low influent C/N ratios. The result showed that the C/N could be over 9. 0 in the supernatant. Polymerase chain reaction {{denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis}} technology was used to reveal the changes in the bacterial community during different stages of the integrated step-feed biofilm process.

40|$|Methane {{emission}} by soils {{results from}} antagonistic but correlated microbial activities. Methane {{is produced in}} the anaerobic zones of submerged soils by methanogens and is oxidised into CO 2 by methanotrophs in the <b>aerobic</b> <b>zones</b> of wetland soils and in upland soils. Methanogens and methanotrophs are ubiquitous in soils where they remain viable under unfavourable conditions. Methane transfer from the soil to the atmosphere occurs mostly through the aerenchyma of aquatic plants, but also by diffusion and as bubbles escaping from wetland soils. Methane sources are mainly wetlands. However 60 to more than 90 % of CH 4 produced in the anaerobic zones of wetlands is reoxidised in their <b>aerobic</b> <b>zones</b> (rhizosphere and oxidised soil-water interface). Methane consumption occurs in most soils and exhibits {{a broad range of}} values. Highest consumption rates or potentials are observed in soils where methanogenesis is or has been effective and where CH 4 concentration is or has been much higher than in the atmosphere (ricefields, swamps, landfills, etc.). Aerobic soils consume atmospheric CH 4 but their activities are very low and the micro-organisms involved are largely unknown. Methane emissions by cultivated or natural wetlands are expressed in mg CH 4 *m- 2 *h- 1 with a median lower than 10 mg CH 4 *m- 2 *h- 1. Methanotrophy in wetlands is most often expressed with the same unit. Methane oxidation by aerobic upland soils is rarely higher than 0. 1 mg CH 4 *m- 2 *h- 1. Forest soils are the most active, followed by grasslands and cultivated soils. Factors that favour CH 4 emission from cultivated wetlands are mostly submersion and organic matter addition. Intermittent drainage and utilisation of the sulphate forms of N-fertilisers reduce CH 4 emission. Methane oxidation potential of upland soils is reduced by cultivation, especially by ammonium N-fertiliser application...|$|R
40|$|Installing {{membranes}} for solid-liquid separation into BNR {{activated sludge}} (AS) systems makes a profound difference {{not only to}} the design of the BNR system itself but also to the design approach for the whole WWTP. The PWWF fixes the membrane surface area that is required in the <b>aerobic</b> <b>zone</b> and therefore fixes the <b>aerobic</b> <b>zone</b> volume. This in turn fixes the biological reactor volume because the aerobic mass fraction is generally fixed to ensure nitrification and sufficient anaerobic and/or anoxic mass fractions for N and/or P removal. Therefore usually with MBR BNR systems, the reactor volume is fixed by the PWWF. The sludge age is then calculated in order to achieve the required Xtaer for effective membrane operation (12 to 18 g/ℓ). For low aerobic mass fraction (< 60 %) MBR BNR systems without flow balancing treating settled wastewater, the sludge age to achieve the required Xtaer is extremely long and the membrane aeration system supplies significantly more oxygen than required for the peak total biological oxygen demand, resulting in uneconomical operation. Treating raw wastewater for this situation results in much shorter sludge ages and in much greater utilization of the oxygenation capacity of the membrane aeration system. Therefore for PWWF/ADWF ratios in the upper range (2. 0 - 2. 5), aerobi...|$|E

Specific objectives of the research were to investigate the effects of COD/TP ratio on the rates of phosphorus removal, COD removal, nitrogen removal, PHB utilization and oxygen uptake. The system was fed with municipal wastewater and operated at 20 °C.

40|$|Experimental {{studies were}} carried out on a bench-scale {{nitrogen}} removal system with a predenitrification configuration to gain insights into the spatial and temporal variations of DO, pH and ORP in such systems.

The DO concentration in the first <b>aerobic</b> <b>zone,</b> when receiving constant aeration, and the net pH change between the last and first aerobic zones display strong correlations with the influent ammonia concentration for the domestic wastewater used in this study.

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2013 Approximately 25 {{percent of}} the United States {{population}} is served by conventional onsite wastewater treatment systems (OWTS), which consist of a septic tank followed by a soil adsorption field with subsurface effluent dispersion. OWTS have limited nitrogen removal ability, and in some locations their nitrogen loading contributes to eutrophication and impairs groundwater for potable uses. Consequently, {{there is a need}} for OWTS with improved nitrogen removal efficiency. The design of onsite nitrogen removal systems should be simple with minimal mechanical equipment and chemical addition. These systems should also require very little operating attention and provide reliable nitrogen removal performance under varying household load conditions. This study evaluated the long-term performance of two new designs intended to meet these requirements while also producing an average total nitrogen effluent concentration of less than 20 mg/L. The designs tested were modifications of recirculating gravel filters (RGF), which have been used for many years. RGFs are easy to operate and are proven to be highly effective for the removal of organic pollutants such as biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and total suspended solids (TSS), as well as biological oxidation of ammonia to nitrate. The modified RGF systems included an anoxic zone below the normal <b>aerobic</b> <b>zone</b> in which flow from the upper zone contacted septic tank effluent flow to promote biological denitrification for nitrogen removal. The systems were considered passive nitrogen removal systems because they do not require an exogenous carbon source. The differences between the two system designs included one having a vegetated <b>aerobic</b> <b>zone</b> (Vegetated RGF) and the other having a layer of oyster shells at the top of <b>aerobic</b> <b>zone,</b> and a different anoxic zone inlet design and upflow flow pattern (Enhanced RGF) versus a horizontal anoxic zone flow pattern for the Vegetated RGF. Each system treated 480 gallon/day of domestic wastewater with a typical diurnal flow pattern. Their performance was evaluated for twelve months, which also included five stress tests that simulated extreme wash loads conditions, low loading periods, vacation interruptions, and power failure that might occur for a single home. This research evaluated and compared the performance of these systems in regards to nitrogen, BOD, TSS, total phosphorus (TP), and fecal coliform removal. Their responses to the stress tests and the effect of temperature were also assessed. The Vegetated RGF achieved high average treatment efficiencies for BOD (98 %), TSS (99 %), and fecal coliform (1. 4 log reduction). The Enhanced RGF was equally effective at removing BOD (97 %), TSS (99 %), and fecal coliform (1. 1 log reduction). Both systems achieved a total phosphorus removal efficiency of about 40 percent. The effluent annual average total nitrogen concentrations were 15. 2 and 8. 6 mg/L with 95 th percentiles of 18. 5 and 12. 3 mg/L for the Vegetated RGF and Enhanced RGF systems, respectively. Both the Vegetated and Enhanced RGF systems had good nitrification efficiency, but some operational clogging in the feed distribution piping did cause higher effluent ammonia concentrations. The larger aerobic volume and lower nitrogen loading to the Vegetated RGF system provided a higher nitrification efficiency compared to the Enhanced RGF. A much greater denitrification efficiency was observed for the Enhanced RGF system compared to the Vegetated RGF system due to its improved method of contacting the nitrified flow from the upper <b>aerobic</b> <b>zone</b> and the septic tank effluent...|$|E

Initially, a bench-scale reactor was operated in three experimental phases. In the first phase, the anaerobic reactor was operated with an average organic matter removal efficiency of 77 % for a hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 10 h. In the second phase, the reactor was operated with an anaerobic stage followed by an <b>aerobic</b> <b>zone,</b> resulting in a mean value of 91 % efficiency. In the third and final phase, the anaerobic-aerobic reactor was operated with recirculation of the effluent of the reactor through the anaerobic zone. The system yielded mean total nitrogen removal percentages of 65 and 75 % for recycle ratios (r) of 0. 5 and 1. 5, respectively, and the chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal efficiencies were higher than 90 %. When the pilot-scale reactor was operated with an HRT of 12 h and r values of 1. 5 and 3. 0, its performance was similar to that observed in the bench-scale unit (92 % COD removal for r = 3. 0). However, the nitrogen removal was lower (55 % N removal for r = 3. 0) due to problems with the hydrodynamics in the <b>aerobic</b> <b>zone.</b> The anaerobic-aerobic fixed-bed reactor with recirculation of the liquid phase allows for concomitant carbon and nitrogen removal without adding an exogenous source of electron donors and without requiring any additional alkalinity supplementation.

Selection of the species of earthworms for vermicomposting should primarily be based on their capacity for consumption of organic wastes, rate of multiplication and adaptability to local condition. Special care should be exercised to keep the wastes under moist condition through periodic addition of water during the entire course of composting. This will not only help the earthworms to get a favorable environment but will also permit more intensive activities of the microorganisms in degrading the wastes. Periodic bottom-up turning of the waste materials will be particularly useful for the composting process by exposing the lower layer of the waste materials to the <b>aerobic</b> <b>zones.</b> This will accelerate the rate of decomposition of the organic materials and also encourage multiplication of the earthworms.

40|$|Abstract – Nowadays, {{innovative}} processes especially processes with integrated growth (combined attached {{and suspended}} growth) such as {{moving bed biofilm reactor}} (MBBR) and integrated fixed film activated Sludge (IFAS) {{are being used}} successfully for new construction and upgrading existing wastewater treatment plants. Increasing the hydraulic capacity, COD and nutrients removal from the effluent are the two main targets of applying these processes. In this research the efficiency of a new version of IFAS reactor was studied at pilot plant scale in Ekbatan municipal WWTP in Tehran, Iran. In this new reactor (which is called H-IFAS reactor) aerobic, anoxic and anaerobic zones were designed in a single reactor and, as a result, the conditions of doing nitrification, denitrification, phosphorus removal and increasing BOD removal rate in the reactor were optimized in comparison with IFAS and MBBR. The media used in this reactor was Bee-Cell 2000 with a total specific surface area of 650 m 2 /m 3. In optimum conditions, the organic degradation rate of the anaerobic and <b>aerobic</b> <b>zone</b> with an average temperature of 23. 48 °C OLR= 22. 5 kg COD/m 3 day for the anaerobic zone and OLR 8. 66 kgCOD/m 3 day for the <b>aerobic</b> <b>zone,</b> was equal to 3. 56 and 6. 22 kgCOD/m 3 day respectively. Nitrification and denitrification rate of media with an average temperature of 23. 48 °C, HRT= 1. 26 hr was equal to 532. 77, 723. 42 and 168. 4 gN/m 3 day respectively. Biological phosphorus removal rate of the reactor at the best operational conditions with a phosphorous loading rate of 243 g P-PO 4 /m 3 day, an average temperature of 23. 48 °C, and HRT 27 min was equal to 168. 4 g P-PO 4 /m 3 day...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1977 The {{biochemical}} {{degradation of}} domestic sludge deposits exposed to benthic marine conditions was investigated using a laboratory Deep Sea Simulator. The rate {{and extent of}} deposit stabilization were determined for select hydrostatic pressures and hydrogen acceptor conditions by monitoring depletion of particulate organic carbon in 2. 0 and 3. 0 centimeter deposits. The extent of aerobic and anaerobic-exogenous zones in a 33 centimeter deep deposit was determined by measuring dissolved oxygen, sulfate and hydrogen sulfide concentrations {{as a function of}} distance from the deposit surface. Marine deposit stabilization processes and a set of mathematical expressions for temporal particulate organic carbon changes were formulated based on studies of fresh water organic matter stabilization and characteristics of the benthic marine environment. Aerobic depletion of particulate organic carbon amounted to between 14 and 19 percent in 20 days. After 120 days, depletion reached 30. 6 percent ([superscript k]avg = 0. 042 day ⁻¹) and the remaining refractory component was 0. 21 mg-C/mg solid. Thereafter, degradation proceeded slowly. Comparable anaerobic decreases were 2. 5 to 4. 0 percent in 20 days and 7. 0 percent in 130 days ([superscript k]avg = 0. 024 day ⁻¹). Calculated anaerobic particulate organic carbon residuals ranged from 0. 25 to 0. 28 mg-C/mg solid. Differences in the aerobic and anaerobic biochemical depletion rates resulted in a 30 percent higher particulate organic carbon concentration in the anaerobic zone than in the near-surface <b>aerobic</b> <b>zone</b> in 120 days. Variance analyses confirmed the significance of degradation rate differences as a function of hydrogen acceptor zone, but indicated that differences were not significant for hydrostatic pressures of one and 34 atmospheres. Interactive hydrostatic pressure/hydrogen-acceptor-type effects were also found to be insignificant. The sludge deposit <b>aerobic</b> <b>zone</b> extended from the sea water/ sludge interface to approximately two millimeters. The anaerobicexogenous zone (defined by a ten-fold reduction in the surface dissolved sulfate concentration) extended from the dissolved oxygen diffusion limit to approximately 16 centimeters deep in a 33 centimeter deposit, 180 days after deposit formation. Hydrogen sulfide concentrations in excess of 500 mg/ 1 were measured at the 16 centimeter depth in the 33 centimeter deposit, whereas the maximum hydrogen sulfide concentration measured in 2. 0 and 3. 0 centimeter deposits was 20 mg/l. Although aerobic particulate organic carbon degradation rates were larger than anaerobic rates, overall depletion of particulate organic carbon occurred principally in the anaerobic zone which was 15 times greater than the <b>aerobic</b> <b>zone</b> in a 3. 0 centimeter deposit. Study findings indicate that the formation of marine sludge deposits which are greater than a few millimeters in depth enhances material preservation. When deposits become deeper than a few centimeters, dissolved hydrogen sulfide may accumulate to levels known to be toxic to marine organisms...|$|E
40|$|The aim {{of present}} study was to design and {{construct}} an Up-flow Anaerobic/Aerobic Fixed Bed (UA/AFB) combined reactor in which an anaerobic and <b>aerobic</b> <b>zones</b> could run in a single reactor to study simultaneously carbon and nutrient removal. The UA/AFB developed reactor was made from Plexiglas plate consisting of two main lower anaerobic and upper aerobic parts. A synthetic wastewater was prepared in concentrations which were close to those found in municipal wastewaters. After developing the biofilm on the media, reactor was operated at 5 different HRTs ranging from 5 to 24 h. Samples collected at any HRTs from influent and sampling ports in steady state condition were analyzed according to standard methods for COD, NH 3, NO - 3, PO 4 - 3, alkalinity and pH. The obtained results showed that the HRT of 7 h was suitable for simultaneous removal of COD, nitrification and denitrification. In this HRT efficiencies are 95. 4, 94 and 94. 5 % for COD removal, nitrification and denitrification, respectively. The reactor did not show good performance in phosphorus removal...|$|R
