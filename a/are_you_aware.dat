Not only that, {{but this man}} is {{reliably}} reported to practice nepotism with his sister-in-law, he has a brother who is a known homo sapiens, {{and he has a}} sister who was once a thespian in wicked New York. Worst of all, it is an established fact that Mr. Pepper, before his marriage, habitually practiced celibacy.|$|E
2500|$|After ascertaining {{that the}} {{minister}} {{believed in the}} eternality of the Torah and its directives, Rabbi Shneur Zalman replied: [...] "When a person is, for example, so and so many years old (mentioning the exact age of his questioner), G-d asks him: Where are you? <b>Are</b> <b>you</b> <b>aware</b> of why you were created on this earth? <b>Are</b> <b>you</b> <b>aware</b> {{of what you are}} expected to do and how much you actually have done?" ...|$|E

[...] The revelation of cover-up on the taping system in the Oval Office led the House Judiciary Committee to submit three articles of impeachment for obstruction of justice, abuse of power, and contempt of congress. When the final article was approved July 30, 1974, Richard Nixon resigned on August 9, 1974.|$|E

[...] thereby publicly revealing the existence of tape recordings of conversations within the White House. National Public Radio later called that session and the discovery of the Watergate tapes [...] "a turning point in the investigation." ...|$|R
2500|$|Hunt {{was also}} a proponent of {{artillery}} practices that reflected his conservative nature. Although acknowledging the power of massed batteries to repel infantry assaults (such as at Malvern Hill or against Pickett's Charge in the Battle of Gettysburg), he urged his gun crews to fire slowly and deliberately and reprimanded them if they exceeded an average of one shot per minute. He believed that faster rates impaired accurate targeting and depleted ammunition faster than could be replenished. A story often told about Hunt was when he exclaimed to a gunner of a fast-firing gun, [...] "Young man, <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>aware</b> that every round you fire costs $2.67?" [...] Fast firing also implied {{to him that the}} gun crew was not brave enough to stand fast on the battlefield, wanting to get back behind the lines for resupply.|$|E

[...] "His {{disappearance}} has {{not affected}} {{my love for}} him, and until his fate is finally ascertained, I shall exert myself to see that HIS rights also are respected." ...|$|R
