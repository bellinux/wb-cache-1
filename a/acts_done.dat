5|$|The {{applicant}} then {{appealed to}} the Court of Appeal. The Court of Appeal construed section 8B(1) {{in accordance with the}} clear legislative intention expressed through the plain wording of the provision. It held that the provision reinstates the legal position laid down in Lee Mau Seng as the law governing judicial review of decisions made or <b>acts</b> <b>done</b> pursuant to the executive's powers under the ISA. In order to determine the law on judicial review of the exercise of executive discretion under the ISA, it is necessary to ascertain the exact decision laid down in Lee Mau Seng. However, the Court declined to opine whether the Lee Mau Seng decision meant that a detention order cannot be challenged on the basis that it was made for reasons completely outside the scope of the ISA. This was because on {{the facts of the case}} it had not been established that the applicant was re-detained for reasons not contemplated by section 8(1) of the ISA and completely unrelated to national security. Notably, the Court did not decide whether section 8B(2) of the ISA precludes it from reviewing a detention order shown to have been made for purposes other than national security, or whether the 1989 amendments to the ISA are outside the scope of the legislative power conferred on Parliament by the amended Article 149 of the Constitution.|$|E

25|$|In the Civil Rights Cases (1883), the Supreme Court allowed {{segregation}} by {{striking down}} the Civil Rights Act of 1875, a statute that prohibited racial discrimination in public accommodation.

25|$|Although {{approximately}} half of Acts deals with Paul's life and works, the Book of <b>Acts</b> <b>does</b> not refer to Paul writing letters. Historians believe that the author of <b>Acts</b> <b>did</b> {{not have access to}} any of Paul's letters.

25|$|There are {{two other}} more unusual {{remedies}} that may be granted. When a law is declared unconstitutional, the Court of Appeal may apply the doctrine of prospective overruling to prevent prejudice to an accused by overruling the law only from {{the date of the}} judgment but preserving it with regards to <b>acts</b> <b>done</b> prior to the judgment. In Canada, the Supreme Court has held that unconstitutional laws can be given temporary validity to prevent a legal vacuum caused by the voiding of laws until the legislature has had time to re-enact the laws in a constitutional manner. This remedy has yet to be applied in Singapore.|$|E
25|$|Immunity from {{suits for}} acts or {{omissions}} in {{the discharge of}} judicial duties can promote the independence of judges in their decision-making. The State Courts Act ("SCA") provides that a judicial officer of the State Courts – that is, a district judge, magistrate, coroner or registrar – may not be sued for any act done by him in the discharge of his judicial duty, {{whether or not the}} judge is acting within the limits of his jurisdiction, so long as at the time he in good faith believed himself to have jurisdiction to do or order the act complained of. There is no corresponding statutory provision applicable to Supreme Court judges, but at common law a superior court judge enjoys absolute immunity from personal civil liability in respect of any judicial act which he does in his capacity as a judge. The immunity extends to <b>acts</b> <b>done</b> outside the judge's jurisdiction, so long as he has acted reasonably and believing in good faith that the act was within his powers. Like judicial officers of the State Courts, the Registrar, Deputy Registrar, Assistant Registrars and other persons acting judicially in the Supreme Court are given statutory immunity from civil suit.|$|E

500|$|There are however {{instances}} {{where people are}} the victims of civil-rights violations that occur in circumstances involving both government officials and private actors. In the 1960s, the United States Supreme Court adopted an expansive view of state action opening the door to wide-ranging civil-rights litigation against private actors when they act as state actors (i.e., <b>acts</b> <b>done</b> or otherwise [...] "sanctioned in some way" [...] by the state). The Court found that the state action doctrine is equally applicable to denials of privileges or immunities, due process, and equal protection of the laws.|$|E
500|$|Ojeda Ríos also {{discussed}} international politics, {{in particular the}} involvement of local politicians with the Dominican Republic–Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR), nothing the peculiarity that Resident Commissioner Luis Fortuño and Eduardo Bathia supported the initiative. After citing that the former supported recent criticism issued by Condolezza Rice against Venezuela, {{he argued that the}} treaty only [...] "granted more control" [...] to the United States over the other parts and represented a threat to Puerto Rico, since production costs in these countries were lower and could trigger a migration of enterprises. Ojeda Ríos also expressed that despite openly supporting Puerto Rican independence, Castro and Chavéz had avoided adopting radical measures on the matter, arguing that they were most likely being cautious since their involvement in local affair at could justify military intervention by the United States. When discussing the ongoing war in Iraq, he called it [...] "part of a geopolitical strategy for the Middle East" [...] and claimed that it served economic interests, calling it [...] "the most abusive war" [...] since Vietnam. Ojeda Ríos expressed opposition to the military recruitment of students in high schools and lamented the participation of Puerto Ricans in this war. He also supported the anti-war activism of Cindy Sheehan and Sonia Santiago. When discussing the evolution of the war on terrorism, Ojeda Ríos once again cited several <b>acts</b> <b>done</b> by the United States military locally, in Abu Rahub, Guantanamo, Japan and Vietnam as examples of [...] "state terrorism" [...] and criticized CNN for publishing live feeds of the bombings in Iraq [...] "without regard" [...] for those that died as collateral damage.|$|E

In the Civil Rights Cases, the Court had held that the Equal Protection Clause applied only to <b>acts</b> <b>done</b> by states, not to <b>acts</b> <b>done</b> by private individuals. [...] Because the Civil Rights Act of 1875 applied to racial discrimination in private establishments, the Court said in the Civil Rights Cases, it exceeded congressional enforcement power under section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment. [...] In Harris, the Court ruled that the Clause {{did not apply to}} a prison lynching, since the Fourteenth Amendment did not apply to private actors, as opposed to state actors. A sheriff (a state actor) had tried to prevent the lynching.|$|E
