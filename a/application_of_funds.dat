All excess funds that are generated from entry fees are donated to a project started by Go Help that provides riding helmets to child jockeys taking part in Mongolian Naadam festivals, a project that was covered by Mongolian television in 2008. The entry fee for the Mongolia Charity Rally 2010 is £300 for teams signing up before October 1, after which the invitation is by invitation only. The entry fee for 2009 was also £300, which {{is less than half}} the entry fee of £650 charged in 2009 by a competing rally run by a profit making company. The 2008 entry fee was £150. The increase reflected two major additions to Go Help's budget: the hiring of an employee in Mongolia to oversee vehicle sales and to monitor the <b>application</b> <b>of</b> <b>funds</b> raised by Charity Ralliers, and the costs of full-time development of the Charity Rallies website.|$|E
5000|$|Mothew {{argued that}} Bristol and West had {{been aware of}} the second charge and even if it had not known, it would still have {{proceeded}} with the transaction and suffered the same loss, because in 1988 when the transaction was going through, the market was buoyant and the extent of the borrower's overdraft facility was commonplace. This would mean no damages would be recoverable at common law, for there would be no causal connection with Mothew's (alleged) negligence and the building society's loss. At first instance he was unsuccessful. However his professional indemnity insurers took the matter to the Court of Appeal where three judges unanimously supported Mr Mothew (see Judgment below) and the case was referred back, ultimately resulting in a settlement whereby no penalty or payment was required to be paid by Mr Mothew or his insurers. Bristol and West ended up having to make a contribution in the region of eighty thousand pounds (£80,000) to the costs of Mr Mothew's indemnity insurers. This case is important because the Court of Appeal set out authority (a case with establishing a precedent) for a solicitors [...] "fiduciary duty" [...] to a lender in the <b>application</b> <b>of</b> <b>funds</b> drawn down by the solicitor irrespective of negligence being established. It has never in this particular case established any negligence, default or breach of duty of care by Mr. Mothew.|$|E

40|$|While {{transportation}} impacts {{are often}} masked by heavy growth in corridor traffic and latent travel demand, modeling enables measuring the real transportation impacts of rail projects. Rail transit is both safe and environmentally friendly. Rail systems expand mobility and reduce household investment in transportation. However, as regions implement rail systems, they must {{take care to}} consider {{the full range of}} rider impacts so that environmental justice issues do not emerge. The largest body of research relates to the economic impact of rail. These impacts are strongest in station areas, as access to rail increases property value on nearby property. The positive impact of rail on property values does not hold true for property directly adjacent to the rail line however. State Departments of Transportation have played a variety of roles in rail development, ranging from funding initial planning and operating services.

40|$|The begining of the {{transition}} process in the CEEC witnessed a remarkable increase in FDI flows to the region. Although not equally benefiting all countries, such growth in external investment {{has been an important}} source of financing for industry and economic development. In addition, FDI is usually considered the fastest way of transfering intangible assets such as access to international markets, new technologies and also market-oriented business culture to the previously centrally controlled economies. These are especially important, given the plans of EU membership shared by all these countries. Competition to activelly attract FDI has therefore been fierce, becoming one of the driving forces of the structural reforms implemented in these countries to improve investment conditions for foreign firms. A number of studies have focused, both theoretically and empirically, on the motives that lead enterpreneurs to engage in international <b>application</b> <b>of</b> <b>funds,</b> and on the motivesthat make some locations more attractive for certain types of projects than others. At the EU level, reduction of overall risk is probably one critical aspect, since every enlargement has generated a boost of FDI flows to the new members. In the case of the CEEC, however, {{the transition}} to a market economy and the prospect of future participation in the EU have, in most cases, a priori triggered the process. In this analysis, robust econometric techniques are employed to model FDI flows, to identify their main determinants, and to try to anticipate future trends of foreign investments in the CEEC and in two of the so-called cohesion countries, Portugal and Spain. the latter is done with the objective of ascertaining diversion of direct investment funds from peripheral EU countries to the CEEC...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Exceptional pupils {{enrolled}} in Canadian French immersion programs rarely {{have access to}} the same range of special education programs and services that are available to students in the regular English program. More often than not, students with special needs are encouraged to transfer to English programs to access necessary support services. This counselling-out process perpetuates the elitist status commonly attributed to French immersion programs. From a critical pedagogy perspective, this inquiry examines the lack of incentive on the part of multiple French immersion stakeholders to accommodate students with special needs. It further attempts to unveil the myths created by these stakeholders to better understand this discriminatory educational practice. The impact of federal and provincial funding models on access to special education programs and services is discussed, and the <b>application</b> <b>of</b> <b>funding</b> allocations by English-language district school boards is explored.

For example, high executive or physician compensation packages have been questioned as potentially inconsistent with fiduciary duties owed by the executives and the board members approving such arrangements.
