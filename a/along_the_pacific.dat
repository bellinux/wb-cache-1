5|$|Spanish infighting also {{hindered}} conquest. In 1522, Gil González Dávila and Andrés Niño set {{out from}} Panama <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pacific</b> coast. During this early expedition, they explored the south coast of what would become Honduras, entering the Gulf of Fonseca.|$|E
5|$|The {{conquest of}} Takalik Abaj broke the ancient trade routes running <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pacific</b> coast from Mexico to El Salvador, these were {{replaced}} by a new route running up the Sierra Madre and into the northwestern Guatemalan highlands.|$|E
5|$|When Emilia began {{turning toward}} the Baja California peninsula, the {{government}} of Mexico issued a tropical storm watch from Buena Vista along the Gulf of California to Bahía Magdalena <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pacific</b> coast. The watch was replaced with a tropical storm warning about 12hours prior to the closest approach of the storm, and additional warnings were issued <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pacific</b> coastline as the storm passed. All watches and warnings were discontinued by July 27. Officials prepared two schools as emergency shelters in Cabo San Lucas, where 100people stayed during the storm. In the area, {{the threat of the}} storm resulted in the closure of several bars and restaurants.|$|E

5|$|In Mexico, spiny {{lobsters}} {{are an important}} commercial resource, representing the fifth most valuable fishery, worth US$18 million. Three species are exploited <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pacific</b> coast of the Baja California peninsula, but the catch of 744t of the California spiny lobster makes up 95%–97% of the total, with only small quantities of Panulirus inflatus and Panulirus gracilis. The fishing rights are held by 26 local co-operatives.|$|E
5|$|Several {{scenes from}} the episode were filmed on September 28, 2006 with a crew of 200 people in Long Beach, California at the Seaport Marina Hotel, <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pacific</b> Coast Highway, and on San Anseline Avenue.

5|$|Sexual {{dimorphism}} exists {{among the}} river otters. Males are, on average, 5% larger than females. In Idaho, juvenile, yearling, and adult males averaged 8, 11, and 17% heavier, respectively, than females {{of the same}} age. A clinical reduction in size may exist {{from north to south}} <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pacific</b> coast, but not from east to west.|$|E

5|$|There is {{evidence}} of increasing contact with Kaminaljuyu, which emerged as a principal centre at this time, linking the Pacific coastal trade routes with the Motagua River route, as well as increased contact with other sites <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pacific</b> coast. Within this extended trade route, Takalik Abaj and Kaminaljuyu {{appear to have been}} the two principal foci. The early Maya style of sculpture spread throughout this network.|$|E
5|$|At {{the very}} end of the Preclassic Period, around 100–300 AD, cities in the {{highlands}} and <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pacific</b> Coast ceased to raise sculpted stelae bearing hieroglyphic texts. This cessation in the production of stelae was the most dramatic symptom of a general decline in the region at this time. This decline has been linked to the intrusion of peoples from the western highlands combined with the disastrous eruption of the Ilopango Volcano that severely affected the entire region.|$|E

5|$|Gil González Dávila and Andrés Niño first {{explored}} {{the coast of}} El Salvador in 1522 as they sailed northwest <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pacific</b> coast of Central America from Panama, and briefly landed in the Bay of Fonseca.

5|$|Japan has a {{total of}} 6,852 islands {{extending}} <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pacific</b> coast of East Asia. The country, including all of the islands it controls, lies between latitudes 24° and 46°N, and longitudes 122° and 146°E. The main islands, from north to south, are Hokkaido, Honshu, Shikoku and Kyushu. The Ryukyu Islands, which include Okinawa, are a chain {{to the south of}} Kyushu. Together they are often known as the Japanese archipelago.|$|E
5|$|Late on October23, {{dramatic}} weakening ensued and Patricia made landfall near Cuixmala, Jalisco, with {{winds of}} 150mph (240km/h). This {{made it the}} strongest landfalling hurricane on record <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pacific</b> coast of Mexico. Patricia continued to weaken extremely quickly, faster than it had intensified, as it interacted with the mountainous terrain of Mexico. Within 24hours of moving ashore, Patricia weakened into a tropical depression and dissipated soon thereafter, late on October24.|$|E

A ceramic potbelly figure was found as far away as Colha in northern Belize and has been dated to c.880600 BC, in the Middle Preclassic.|$|E
5|$|The California {{spiny lobster}} {{is found in}} parts of the Gulf of California, and <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pacific</b> coast of the length of the Baja California peninsula, {{extending}} as far north as San Luis Obispo Bay, California. There are occasional records from Monterey Bay, but the water there is too cold for the California spiny lobster to breed, and it is thought that any adult found in Central California arrived as a larva during El Niño years.|$|E
5|$|The black-throated gray warbler breeds {{in western}} North America, its range {{extending}} from southwestern British Columbia <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pacific</b> coast to northern Baja California, and east to New Mexico and southern Montana.

Vagrants have been recorded across eastern North America and in Cuba.|$|E

5|$|This bird breeds {{throughout}} most of North America, from Alaska and Canada southward to northern Florida and Mexico. While robins occasionally overwinter {{in the northern part}} of the United States and southern Canada, most migrate to winter south of Canada from Florida and the Gulf Coast to central Mexico, as well as <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pacific</b> Coast. Most depart south by the end of August and begin to return north in February and March (exact dates vary with latitude and climate).|$|E
5|$|This {{species is}} one of the most widely {{distributed}} salamanders in North America, second only to the tiger salamander.

The distribution reconnects in northeastern Sierra Nevada running continuously <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pacific</b> Coast to Juneau, Alaska, with populations dotted along the Taku and Stikine River valleys. From the Pacific coast, the range extends longitudinally to the eastern foothills of the Rocky Mountains in Montana and Alberta.|$|E
