50|$|The Bristol 400 was {{essentially}} a hand-built, to <b>aircraft</b> <b>industry</b> <b>standards,</b> BMW 327 two-door coupe, mounted on a BMW 326 chassis, powered by the legendary 2-liter BMW 328 engine. It was fast, 90 mph, but expensive. The 1948 401 featured an improved aerodynamic body in the lightweight Touring Superleggera fashion; and the 1953 403 boasted improved suspension, brakes and gearbox, while power was boosted from 85 to 100 bhp. The 1954 short-chassis 404 had a completely new body, and top speed was up to 110 mph. The 1958 406 {{was the last of}} the BMW-powered versions and was produced until 1961, after which they were superseded by a range of automatic transmission equipped and Chrysler V8 powered Bristols, with the engines rebuilt by Bristol engineers and fitted with high-lift camshafts and mechanical lifters.|$|R

40|$|<b>Aircraft</b> <b>industry</b> is very {{important}} to the economy and security of a country, and <b>aircraft</b> <b>industry</b> clusters have already existed in the world. Based on Input-Output data and Czamanski's method, the <b>aircraft</b> <b>industry</b> clusters in China and USA were identified quantitatively in this paper. Furthermore, this article carried out comparison analyses of the identification results. The research finds out: 1) a mature <b>aircraft</b> <b>industry</b> cluster would be generally composed of 7 industrial subgroups, including <b>aircraft</b> <b>industry,</b> metal making and products manufacturing industry, machinery and equipment industry, electronics industry, automobile industry, material industry and others, and electronics industrial subgroup will play a more and more important role in the cluster; 2) in the range of industry-covering, the level of industry-linkage, and the economic performance, there is a tremendously large gap between the <b>aircraft</b> <b>industry</b> cluster of China and that of USA; 3) the spatial evolution of these clusters or centers is highly consistent with the diffusion of a country's industrialization. Finally, based on those findings, the paper gives some advice on how to improve Czamanski's method and what China should do to develop its own competitive aircraft industry: 1) China should employ institutional innovation, and turn to be market-oriented; 2) China should abandon the traditional pattern of closed-development, and strengthen the interaction and collaboration between <b>aircraft</b> <b>industry</b> and related industries, especially the electronics industry; 3) China should rectify and perfect its spatial development planning of <b>aircraft</b> <b>industry...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{thesis is}} about {{analysing}} {{the capability of}} the civil <b>aircraft</b> <b>industry</b> in contributing towards improved national technological competitiveness. The South African government recognises {{the potential for the}} country’s <b>aircraft</b> <b>industry</b> to contribute to the growth of the national economy. However, it is not known if the current support mechanisms are adequate for developing the appropriate technological base and for promoting the innovative capabilities of the industry. Countries with successful <b>aircraft</b> <b>industries</b> were studied: South Korea and Brazil were used to represent emerging economies and France was used to represent developed economies. This was done to analyse existing models or frameworks and/or commonalities that led to the successful development of technologically competitive civil <b>aircraft</b> <b>industries</b> internationally. The South African civil <b>aircraft</b> <b>industry</b> was also studied, and its technology development competence was compared to that of successful countries. How the local technology development framework could be structured or improved, using lessons from successful countries, was considered. Local participants were representatives of the South African government departments or ministries (DTI; and DST), academia (The University of the Witwatersrand – Wits; and the University of Cape Town – UCT), research institutions (CSIR and NRF), and firms (Aerosud, Denel, and Aerospace Monitoring and Systems – AMS). Based on the analysis of the findings, frameworks aimed at improving the technological base of the South African civil <b>aircraft</b> <b>industry</b> were proposed as follows: The development of technology capability building through government interventions. This emphasises aggressive government interventions that encourage collaboration between firms in the industry, and with research and higher education institutions, followed by major investment in research and development. An institutional structure for the development of national aircraft technology. This is aimed at strengthening the technology development arena of the South African <b>aircraft</b> <b>industry,</b> through acquired projects, but with less emphasis on business acquisition.

40|$|The present article explores {{innovation}} and imitation {{in the context}} of the commercial <b>aircraft</b> <b>industry</b> in China as a critical case. The rise of Chinese firms has been one of the most fascinating stories in global business during the past decades. In 2012, Chinese firms have outnumbered Japanese firms in the fortune global 500 ranking for the first time. Many scholars have focused on technological {{innovation and}} upgrading, or the absence thereof, as the primary explanatory variables for this phenomenal development. This study complements this perspective by examining non- technological forms of innovation such as a firm’s business model. It argues that Chinese firms are innovators as much as imitators of business models and do not necessarily converge with global <b>industry</b> <b>standards.</b> Such business model innovation can occur at the “top of the pyramid” and has potentially disruptive implications for competition in global markets...|$|R
40|$|<b>Aircraft</b> <b>industry</b> is {{considered}} one of the most important and the most strategic industry for Indonesia. It became so important to the economic development of Indonesia since the country has a wide area and is naturally composed of thousands of islands with difficult and different geographical conditions and thus requires adequate transportation. The airplane has the advantage in speed and power to achieve when compared with land transportation and sea, so as to support the mobility of business activities and citizens who need a quick means of transportation. <b>Aircraft</b> <b>industry</b> is also very strategic for Indonesia as an industry-based high technology; it could lead Indonesia in line with other developed countries. It also showed how a nationalist rhetoric shapes the symbolic and physical construction of technology [1]. Based on these view, the Indonesian government develops this industry as a means for technology transfer process. Dirgantara Indonesia is the only <b>aircraft</b> <b>industry</b> in Indonesia, which assumed all the missions that have been mentioned above. Dirgantara Indonesia is the name that was inaugurated by the 4 th President of the Republic of Indonesia, Abdurrahman Wahid in Jakarta, on August 24, 2000 for the <b>aircraft</b> <b>industry</b> in Indonesia, which replaces the name of IPTN (Nusantara <b>Aircraft</b> <b>Industry)</b> that have been pioneered since about 25 years ago...|$|R
