5|$|Cetaceans are widespread, but some, as {{with the}} mysticetes, specialise in certain environments. Most mysticetes prefer the colder waters of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, and migrate to the equator to give birth. Odontocetes feed largely on fish and squid, but a few, like the killer whale, feed on mammals, such as pinnipeds. Gray whales are {{specialized}} for feeding on bottom-dwelling mollusks. Males typically mate with multiple females every year, but females only mate {{every two to three}} years. Calves are typically born {{in the spring and summer}} months and females bear all the responsibility for raising them. Mothers of some species fast <b>and</b> <b>nurse</b> their young for a relatively long period of time. Some whales produce a variety of vocalizations, notably the songs of the humpback whale. Many species, mainly dolphins, are highly sociable, with some pods reaching over a thousand individuals.|$|E
5|$|For otariids {{and some}} phocids like the harbor seal, mothers fast <b>and</b> <b>nurse</b> their pups {{for a few}} days at a time. In between nursing bouts, the females leave their young onshore to forage at sea. These {{foraging}} trips may last anywhere between a day and two weeks, depending on the abundance of food and the distance of foraging sites. While their mothers are away, the pups will fast. Lactation in otariids may last 6–11 months; in the Galápagos fur seal it can last as long as 3 years. Pups of these species are weaned at lower weights than their phocid counterparts. Walruses are unique in that mothers nurse their young at sea. The female rests at the surface with its head held up, and the young suckle upside down. Young pinnipeds typically learn to swim on their own and some species can even swim at birth. Other species may wait days or weeks before entering the water. Elephant seals do not swim until weeks after they are weaned.|$|E
40|$|What {{defines the}} quality of care?' {{is one of the}} key {{questions}} in health care <b>and</b> <b>nursing</b> sciences. This topic has been discussed in Germany for more than fifteen years and yet no theory based understanding of 'quality' in domestic care <b>and</b> <b>nursing</b> exists to date. Therefore, this work aims to develop theory driven indicators for care <b>and</b> <b>nursing.</b> The approach taken here consists of applying the paradigm of sustainability, originally developed by the social sciences, to the novel field of healthcare <b>and</b> <b>nursing.</b> The criteria 'active social life', 'self-determination', 'participation' and 'quality of life' are transferred onto domestic care <b>and</b> <b>nursing.</b> For example, the indicator 'availability of barrier-free living space# was used to operationalize the criterion 'active social life', while the indicator 'level of volunteer involvement' was employed to operationalize the criterion 'participation'. The degree to which individual indicators are applied in nowadays health care <b>and</b> <b>nursing</b> was determined based on an in depth literature analysis. In summary, this work clearly indicates which areas of care <b>and</b> <b>nursing</b> validate further study and development: For instance, it is imperative to further develop advice and information services, to speedily implement the 'empowerment concept' and to increase the involvement of voluntary care givers...|$|R

5|$|Although {{pinnipeds}} are widespread, {{most species}} prefer the colder {{waters of the}} Northern and Southern Hemispheres. They {{spend most of their}} lives in the water, but come ashore to mate, give birth, molt or escape from predators, like sharks and killer whales. They feed largely on fish and marine invertebrates; but a few, like the leopard seal, feed on large vertebrates, such as penguins and other seals. Walruses are specialized for feeding on bottom-dwelling mollusks. Male pinnipeds typically mate with more than one female (polygyny), although the degree of polygyny varies with the species. The males of land-breeding species tend to mate with a greater number of females than those of ice- or water-breeding species. Male pinniped strategies for reproductive success vary between defending females, defending territories that attract females and performing ritual displays or lek mating. Pups are typically born {{in the spring and summer}} months and females bear almost all the responsibility for raising them. Mothers of some species fast <b>and</b> <b>nurse</b> their young for a relatively short period of time while others take foraging trips at sea between nursing bouts. Walruses are known to nurse their young while at sea. Seals produce a number of vocalizations, notably the barks of California sea lions, the gong-like calls of walruses and the complex songs of Weddell seals.|$|E
5|$|Female California {{sea lions}} have a 12-month {{reproductive}} cycle, {{consisting of a}} 9-month actual gestation and a 3-month delayed implantation of the fertilized egg before giving birth in June or July. Interbirth intervals are particularly long for this species, being 21 days for sea lions off California and more than 30 days for sea lions in the Gulf of California. Females remain with their pups on shore for 10 days <b>and</b> <b>nurse</b> them. After this, females will go on foraging trips lasting as long as three days, returning to nurse their pups {{for up to a}} day. Pups left on shore tend to gather in nurseries to socialize and play. When returning from a trip, females call their pups with distinctive calls to which the pups will reply in kind. A mother and pup can distinguish each other's calls from those of other mothers and pups. At first, reunions largely depend on the efforts of the mothers. However, as pups get older, they get more involved in reunions. Older pups may sometimes join their mothers during their foraging trips. Adult male California sea lions play no role in raising pups, but they do take more interest in them than adult males of other otariid species; they have even been observed to help shield swimming pups from predators. Pups are weaned by a year but can continue to suckle for another year.|$|E
5|$|Fish {{and other}} aquatic prey {{taken in the}} water or at the water's edge form the major part of American alligator's diet and may be eaten {{at any time of}} the day or night. Adult American {{alligators}} also spend considerable time hunting on land, up to 50m (170ft) from water, ambushing terrestrial animals on trailsides and road shoulders. Usually, terrestrial hunting occurs on nights with warm temperatures. When hunting terrestrial prey, American alligators may also ambush them {{from the edge of the}} water by grabbing them and pulling the prey into the water, the preferred method of predation of larger crocodiles. The teeth of the American alligator are designed to grip prey, but can not rip or chew flesh like teeth of some other predators (such as canids and felids), and depend on their gizzard instead to masticate their food. The American alligator is capable of biting though a turtle's shell or a moderately sized mammal bone. Additionally, American alligators have recently been filmed and documented killing and eating sharks and rays; four incidents documented indicated that bonnetheads, lemon sharks, Atlantic stingrays <b>and</b> <b>nurse</b> sharks are components of the animal's diet. Sharks are also known to prey on American alligators in turn, indicating encounters between the two predators are more common than thought.|$|E
40|$|ENGLISH ABSTRACT Title: The {{perceptions}} of <b>nurses</b> <b>and</b> certified <b>nursing</b> assistants on care-related prevention concerning people with dementia: a mixed methods approach. Background: Because {{of the growing}} number of people with dementia, care-related prevention activities done by <b>nurses</b> <b>and</b> certified <b>nursing</b> assistants will become increasingly important to prevent complications and maintain an acceptable quality of life. Currently it’s unknown what the {{perceptions of}} <b>nurses</b> <b>and</b> certified <b>nursing</b> assistants towards care-related prevention in dementia care are. Aim: To gain insight into the perceptions of <b>nurses</b> <b>and</b> certified <b>nursing</b> assistants towards care-related prevention so care-related prevention for people with dementia can be further improved in the future. Research question: How do <b>nurses</b> <b>and</b> certified <b>nursing</b> assistants working in home care, residential or nursing homes perceive care-related prevention concerning people with dementia? Method: A mixed methods approach with survey research and individual semi-structured interviews. First, secondary analyses were done on existing survey data collected in 2011 on a sample of 206 <b>nurses</b> <b>and</b> certified <b>nursing</b> assistants. Second, in March-May 2014 12 individual semi-structured interviews were conducted to embellish the quantitative results. Results: From this study three concepts related to the perceptions of <b>nurses</b> <b>and</b> CNAs towards care-related prevention activities emerged: attitude, knowledge and skills <b>and</b> the future. <b>Nurses</b> <b>and</b> certified <b>nursing</b> assistants think care-related prevention is a task of their profession. They experience insufficient knowledge and skills and they like to devote more time to care-related prevention in the future. Conclusion: <b>Nurses</b> <b>and</b> certified <b>nursing</b> assistants perceive care-related prevention to be part of their profession. They however express the need for more education on care-related prevention, preferably in a classroom setting. In the future, <b>nurses</b> <b>and</b> certified <b>nursing</b> assistants like to devote more time to care-related prevention and e-health can support this. Recommendations: Additional training of <b>nurses</b> <b>and</b> certified <b>nursing</b> assistants focused on their different needs and use of e-health...|$|R
