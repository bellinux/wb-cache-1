5|$|Even though Uncle Tom's Cabin was {{the best-selling}} {{novel of the}} 19th century, far more Americans of that time saw the story <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>stage</b> play or musical than read the book.

5|$|On the book's publication, Waugh's friends praised it, but {{its general}} {{critical}} reception was muted. Most reviewers admired the self-portrait of Waugh {{with which the}} novel opens, but expressed divided views about the rest, in particular the ending.

The book has been dramatised for radio and <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>stage</b> play.|$|E

5|$|After their {{extraordinary}} early successes, {{beginning with}} Oklahoma! in 1943, Rodgers and Hammerstein had written two musicals in the 1950s {{that did not}} do well and sought a new hit to revive their fortunes. Lee's novel focuses on a father, Wang Chi-yang, a wealthy refugee from China, who clings to traditional values in San Francisco's Chinatown. Rodgers and Hammerstein shifted {{the focus of the}} musical to his son, Wang Ta, who is torn between his Chinese roots and assimilation into American culture. The team hired Gene Kelly to make his debut <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>stage</b> director with the musical and scoured the country for a suitable Asian – or at least, plausibly Asian-looking – cast. The musical, much more light-hearted than Lee's novel, was profitable on Broadway and was followed by a national tour.|$|E

5|$|Dragonflies are {{affected}} by three major groups of parasites: water mites, gregarine protozoa, and trematode flatworms (flukes). Water mites, Hydracarina, can kill smaller dragonfly larvae, and may also be seen on adults. Gregarines infect the gut and may cause blockage and secondary infection. Trematodes are parasites of vertebrates such as frogs, with complex life cycles often involving a period <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>stage</b> called a cercaria in a secondary host, a snail. Dragonfly nymphs may swallow cercariae, or these may tunnel through a nymph's body wall; they then enter the gut and form a cyst or metacercaria, which remains in the nymph {{for the whole of}} its development. If the nymph is eaten by a frog, the amphibian becomes infected by the adult or fluke stage of the trematode.|$|E
5|$|Established {{during the}} revival of the Indies film industry, Oriental {{released}} its first film, Kris Mataram, in July 1940.

This was followed by a further three films, which were targeted at low-income audiences and extensively used kroncong music. Their final production was Panggilan Darah in 1941, which was completed after Njoo and Young had migrated to Majestic Film. Oriental was unable to recoup its expenses of renting a Dutch-owned studio, and the company was shut down.|$|E
