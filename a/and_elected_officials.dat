According to Suetonius, the imperial bureaucracy never ran more efficiently than under Domitian, whose exacting standards and suspicious nature maintained historically low corruption among provincial governors <b>and</b> <b>elected</b> <b>officials.</b>|$|E

5|$|When {{the city}} {{government}} announced its budget in late June 2014 for the upcoming fiscal year beginning July 1, the ferry only received a $2 million further appropriation, enough to temporarily extend it again through October. The administration of Mayor Bill de Blasio stated {{that there was not}} enough ridership to justify the cost of operation. Despite last-minute efforts by local transportation advocates, civic leaders, <b>and</b> <b>elected</b> <b>officials,</b> ferry service ended on October 31, 2014. They promised to continue efforts to have the service restored. This led to many negotiations between the mayor's office and the parties interested in reopening the ferry.
