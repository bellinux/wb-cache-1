25|$|In {{addition}} to the regular subjects {{there are also a}} couple of special subjects. The first one is called <b>almen</b> sprogforståelse which teaches a student general linguistics and gives the student the ability to analyze sentences. In {{addition to}} the general part of that subject there is also a Latin part which aims to give the student a very basic understanding of a Latin language. The idea of the subject is to form a basis for language related subjects throughout the gymnasium.|$|E
25|$|Another {{subject is}} <b>almen</b> studieforberedelse. The purpose of that subject is to {{introduce}} the student to a three main areas of study the gymnasium deals with: the humanities, social science and natural science. Furthermore, does it aim to give a student knowledge about different methodology used by different faculties. Lessons encompass a combination {{of two or more}} of the student's other subjects (e.g. Danish, history and physics). The student will learn to use the methodology theory it has learned to work with and solve complex problems.|$|E

500|$|Aalborg's cemeteries have {{a history}} dating {{to the end of}} the Middle Ages. Sankt Jørgens Kirkegård (St George's Cemetery) was on the corner of Hasserisgade and Kirkegårdsgade. The site was chosen in a {{district}} outside the city as it provided isolation for those affected by the plague, many of whom died in the neighbouring hospice, Sankt Jørgens Gårde. In 1794, a new cemetery was opened in Klostermarken, immediately to the south of Sankt Jørgens Kirkegård. It was further extended in 1804, 1820 and 1870. It is now known as Aalborgs <b>Almen</b> Kirkegård (meaning [...] "common cemetery") and contains the graves of many of the city's most notable citizens.|$|E

50|$|This {{company was}} founded in 1945 in {{southern}} California by engineer Henry Fuchs. Fuchs had been working with John <b>Almen</b> on new applications for shot peening of automobiles and military equipment companies produced before and during World War II. Fuchs and <b>Almen</b> worked at the Research Laboratory of General Motors Corporation {{before the start of}} MIC. The <b>Almen</b> strip or <b>Almen</b> system, a tool for duplicating the shot peening process, was named after John <b>Almen.</b>|$|E

50|$|An <b>Almen</b> round {{is a thin}} round disk used to {{quantify}} the intensity of a shot peening process. Developed in 1994 by Rudolf Bosshard in Switzerland, it is a modification of the <b>Almen</b> strip method, which is used worldwide as a surface treatment testing method {{in the field of}} shot peening. The basic principle is the same, but due to the simple shape and minimized size, the <b>Almen</b> round is more suitable for automated processing and installation on dummy rigs. Also instead of the <b>Almen</b> block according SAE J442, here a matching device is used and if connected to electronic processing unit, the <b>Almen</b> value according AMS-S-13165 (predecessor MIL-S-13165 Rev.C) can be evaluated in one run.|$|E

5000|$|Intensity {{is a key}} {{parameter}} of {{the shot}} peening process. After some development of the process, an analog was needed to measure the effects of shot peening. John <b>Almen</b> noticed that shot peening made {{the side of the}} sheet metal that was exposed begin to bend and stretch. He created the <b>Almen</b> strip to measure the compressive stresses in the strip created by the shot peening operation. One can obtain what {{is referred to as the}} [...] "intensity of the blast stream" [...] by measuring the deformation on the <b>Almen</b> strip that is in the shot peening operation. As the strip reaches a 10% deformation, the <b>Almen</b> strip is then hit with the same intensity for twice the amount of time. If the strip deforms another 10%, then one obtains the intensity of the blast stream. Another operation to gauge the intensity of a shot peening process is the use of an <b>Almen</b> round, developed by R. Bosshard.|$|E
