5|$|Most {{developing}} countries are taking steps to develop emergency medicine as <b>a</b> <b>specialty,</b> to develop accreditation mechanisms, and to promote the development of emergency medicine training programs. Their interest {{is a result of}} improved healthcare, increasing urbanization, aging populations, the rising number of traffic fatalities, and heightened awareness of emergency medicine among their citizens. In addition, emergency medicine is useful in dealing with time-sensitive illnesses, as well as improving public health through vaccinations, interventions, training, and data collection.

5|$|One way {{to advance}} {{emergency}} medical care is to obtain the recognition of emergency medicine as <b>a</b> <b>specialty</b> in countries that currently lack it.

Recognition increases the visibility and prestige of the profession and promotes other efforts to advance its development. Botswana may serve as a case study. Its recent recognition of emergency medicine as <b>a</b> <b>specialty</b> has been closely accompanied by the creation of the Botswana Society for Emergency Care, the establishment of a Resuscitation Training Centre and a Trauma Research Centre at the University of Botswana, and the formation of a committee to design a national policy for pre-hospital care.|$|E

40|$|This {{investigation}} {{offers a}} comprehensive {{analysis of the}} relative social prestige of various medical specialties. The specialties were evaluated in terms of ascribed esteem by a lay sample of 400 respondents. Several attributes were then tested {{in order to measure}} their contribution to overall prestige. The results affirm that a stable prestige hierarchy exists among medical specialties, with certain ones, such as surgery and cardiology, consistently ranked at the top, and others, such as dermatology and psychiatry, consistently resting at the bottom. <b>A</b> <b>specialty's</b> relative standing in perceived income and assigned social value are the best predictors of its hierarchical position, with income being the single best predictor.

5|$|Early in December 1900, we {{received}} from Lowell Observatory in Arizona a telegram that {{a shaft of}} light had been seen to project from Mars (the Lowell observatory makes <b>a</b> <b>specialty</b> of Mars) lasting seventy minutes.
