According to Eusebius, the purge was broadly successful, but Eusebius is confused about the technicalities of the event and his characterization of the overall size of the apostasy is ambiguous. Eusebius also <b>attributes</b> <b>the</b> initiative for the purge to Galerius, rather than Diocletian.|$|E
5|$|Historian Michael Crawford <b>attributes</b> <b>the</b> {{disappearance}} {{of much of}} Tiberius Gracchus' support to the reduced level of citizen participation due to dispersal far from Rome, and sees his tribunate as marking {{a step in the}} Hellenization of Roman aristocracy. Crawford asserts that Gaius Gracchus' extortion law shifted {{the balance of power in}} Rome and that the Gracchi made available a new political armoury which the oligarchy subsequently sought to exploit.|$|E

30|$|Helper: The “helper” tag {{is used to}} {{describe}} the mapping relationship between elements. There are usually three <b>attributes</b> in <b>the</b> “helper” tag, <b>the</b> key <b>attribute,</b> <b>the</b> value <b>attribute</b> and <b>the</b> type <b>attribute.</b> <b>The</b> value <b>attribute</b> describes <b>the</b> target element in the customized model and <b>the</b> key <b>attribute</b> describes <b>the</b> target element in Cloud resource runtime models. <b>The</b> type <b>attribute</b> describes <b>the</b> type of the mapping relationship. When its value is “basic”, it is a one-to-one mapping relationship or a many-to-one mapping relationship. When its value is “multi”, it is a one-to-many mapping relationship. The “helper” tag is used {{to describe}} the mapping relationship between elements. Elements often have attributes or other elements, so the “helper” tag usually nests “helper” tags, “mapper” tags and “query” tags.|$|R
5|$|In Jainism, Kubera is the {{attendant}} Yaksha of the 19th Tirthankar Mallinath. He is usually called Sarvanubhuti or Sarvahna, {{and may be}} depicted with four faces, rainbow colours and eight arms. The Digambara sect of Jainism gives him six weapons and three heads; while the Svetambaras portray him with four to six arms, numerous choices of weapons, though his <b>attributes,</b> <b>the</b> money bag and citron fruit are consistent. He may ride a man or an elephant. He {{is related to the}} Buddhist Jambhala rather than the Hindu Kubera.|$|E

After months of rehearsal, Iron Maiden made their debut at St. Nicks Hall in Poplar on 1 May 1976, before taking up a semi-residency at the Cart and Horses Pub in Maryland Point, Stratford.|$|E
5|$|Stark <b>attributes</b> <b>the</b> {{rise of the}} {{movement}} in the late-19th and early-20th centuries to several factors, chiefly that medical practice was in its infancy. Because patients often fared better without medical treatment, Christian Science prayer was favorable in comparison. Other factors included that the church retained cultural continuity with Christianity by stressing that it was Christian and adopting its terms, despite the new content Eddy introduced. It was not puritanical. Members were expected not to drink or smoke, but could otherwise do as they pleased, and several exceptions to the avoidance of medicine were permitted.|$|E

R. Mead as the supervising architect. Mead was rarely involved in architectural design in the partnership, making his design of Woodlea and another Vanderbilt house, Florham, unusual. He was related to Shepard, as Mead's sister was married to Shepard's brother.|$|E

5|$|The {{reasons for}} the end of the Mycenaean culture have been hotly debated among scholars. At present, there is no {{satisfactory}} explanation for the collapse of the Mycenaean palace systems.

5|$|To {{complement}} the garden, a bath house and summer house were constructed {{at the corners}} of the garden furthest from the castle. The bath house is ruined, but the two-storey summer house survives intact. It comprises a groin-vaulted lower room, with an upper chamber, containing the only surviving example of the castle’s carved-oak wall panelling. Charles McKean <b>attributes</b> <b>the</b> design and construction of the garden buildings to Thomas Leiper, an Aberdeenshire stonemason, based on the elaborately decorated gun holes in the summer house.|$|E
5|$|A variant, {{in which}} the motif is {{enclosed}} within a relieving blind arch that unifies the motif, is not Palladian, though Burlington seems to have assumed it was so, in using a drawing in his possession showing three such features in a plain wall (see illustration of Claydon House above right). Modern scholarship <b>attributes</b> <b>the</b> drawing to Scamozzi. Burlington employed the motif in 1721 for an elevation of Tottenham Park in Savernake Forest for his brother-in-law Lord Bruce (since remodelled). Kent picked it up in his designs for the Houses of Parliament, and it appears in Kent's executed designs for the north front of Holkham Hall.|$|E

5|$|Author Masaru Takeuchi <b>attributes</b> <b>the</b> {{origin of}} the quick time event game {{mechanic}} to laserdisc games like Dragon's Lair and Time Gal. IGN's Levi Buchanan listed FMV games like Time Gal {{as one of the}} reasons behind the Mega-CD's commercial failure, citing them as a waste of the system's capabilities. Ciolek referred to the protagonist {{as one of the first}} human heroines in the industry. He further added that Reika was an appealing lead character that Taito could have easily turned into a mascot and featured in other games and media. The character was later included in Alfa System's shooting game Castle of Shikigami III—Taito published the arcade version in Japan. In the game, Reika features similar attacks and personality but the character's visual design was updated. Reika's most recent appearance was in the Elevator Action remake Elevator Action Deluxe as one of the few free Taito DLCs.|$|E

5|$|In 2012, however, it was {{reported}} that the series' ratings were declining. The average number of viewers aged 2 to 11 watching SpongeBob at any given time dropped 29% in the first quarter from a year earlier, according to Nielsen. Wall Street Journal business writer John Jannarone suggested that the age of the series and oversaturation of the series might be contributing to the decline of the series' ratings, and might also be directly responsible for the decline in Nickelodeon's overall ratings.
