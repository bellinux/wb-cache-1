50|$|Although the {{students}} learn {{a vast number}} of new disciplines and techniques to build upon their Elementary Flying Training, the focus on the Squadron is Crew Resource Management (CRM) and Emergency Handling. Students are encouraged to develop their airmanship and decision making, with the aim of producing the front line captains of tomorrow. <b>Asymmetric</b> <b>flight</b> is perhaps the most significant change to previous flying experiences and as such it is covered thoroughly throughout the course to ensure students are confident with handling the aircraft on just one engine. Most of the training is completed around Lincolnshire, with regular visits to RAF Scampton, Marham and Coningsby along with local civilian airports Doncaster and Humberside for circuit training and Instrument Approaches.

40|$|An {{investigation}} was conducted into {{the feasibility of}} using an unconventional flight technique, <b>asymmetric</b> <b>flight,</b> to improve overall efficiency of solar aircraft. In this study, <b>asymmetric</b> <b>flight</b> is defined as steady level flight in a non-wings-level state in- tended to improve solar incidence angle. By manipulating aircraft orientation through roll angle, solar energy collection is improved but aerodynamic efficiency is worsened due {{to the introduction of}} additional trim drag. A point performance model was devel- oped to investigate the trade-off between improvement in solar energy collection and additional drag associated with <b>asymmetric</b> <b>flight.</b> A mission model with a focus on aircraft orbits was then developed via integration of the point performance model over a set of discrete points. It is shown that there is a non-zero bank angle where optimal net power is achieved for a given aircraft orientation, flight condition, and sun position. The study also shows that there is improvement in overall efficiency over conventional flight for various orbit shapes and winds aloft. This indicates that there is potential value in not only flight path planning, but also in orientation planning for solar aircraft...|$|E
40|$|Summary.;rhe lateral-directional {{stability}} of a single-rotor helicopter is investigated by solving tile {{equations of motion}} for a typical aircraft. It is found that the motion has three constituent parts, two subsidences and an oscillation. The oscillation is slightly unstable at very low speeds but {{becomes more and more}} damped as the speed of the aircraft is increased. The response to disturbances of various kinds and to control movements is illustrated by means of examples. It is found that increasing altitude reduces the damping of the oscillatory motion and decreases the rolling effectiveness of the control. Flight measurements of the lateral-directional oscillation agree well with theory except for an overestimation of period at very low speeds. Consideration is given to the effect of varying some design parameters; in particular it is shown that a large increase in roll damping at very low speeds will stabilise the lateral-directional oscillation and that a decrease in roll damping at high speed can lead to the appearance of a second oscillatory mode which may be unstable. An Appendix shows the connection between certain stability derivatives and control positions in <b>asymmetric</b> <b>flight.</b> 1. Introduction. Th...|$|E

50|$|Protopteryx {{was adapted}} for flying and had {{feathers}} with features similar to modern birds, {{as shown by}} their procoracoid, carina of the sternum, external tuberosity of the humerus, and deltoid crest. These features suggest Protopteryx had modern musculus supercoracoideus and pectoralis. Protopteryx also share <b>asymmetric</b> wing <b>flight</b> feathers with flying birds, as well as Archaeopteryx and Confuciusornis. Tail feathers of Protopteryx have different features to their other feathers: lack of barbs and rami close to the body. The lack of barbs suggests the feathers have a use outside of flight, such as display, thermoregulation, or sensory usage.|$|R
40|$|Microraptor gui, a four-winged dromaeosaur {{from the}} Early Cretaceous of China, {{provides}} strong evidence for an arboreal-gliding origin of avian flight. It possessed <b>asymmetric</b> <b>flight</b> feathers {{not only on}} the manus but also on the pes. A previously published reconstruction shows that the hindwing of Microraptor supported by a laterally extended leg would have formed a second pair of wings in tetrapteryx fashion. However, this wing design conflicts with known theropod limb joints that entail a parasagittal posture of the hindlimb. Here, we offer an alternative planform of the hindwing of Microraptor that is concordant with its feather orientation for producing lift and normal theropod hindlimb posture. In this reconstruction, the wings of Microraptor could have resembled a staggered biplane configuration during flight, where the forewing formed the dorsal wing and the metatarsal wing formed the ventral one. The contour feathers on the tibia were positioned posteriorly, oriented in a vertical plane for streamlining that would reduce the drag considerably. Leg feathers are present in many fossil dromaeosaurs, early birds, and living raptors, and they {{play an important role in}} flight during catching and carrying prey. A computer simulation of the flight performance of Microraptor suggests that its biplane wings were adapted for undulatory “phugoid” gliding between trees, where the horizontal feathered tail offered additional lift and stability and controlled pitch. Like the Wright 1903 Flyer, Microraptor, a gliding relative of early birds, took to the air with two sets of wings...|$|E
40|$|Dipteran flies are {{amongst the}} {{smallest}} and most agile of flying animals. Their wings are driven indirectly by large power muscles, which cause cyclical deformations of the thorax that are amplified through the intricate wing hinge. <b>Asymmetric</b> <b>flight</b> manoeuvres {{are controlled by}} 13 pairs of steering muscles acting directly on the wing articulations. Collectively the steering muscles account for < 3 % of total flight muscle mass, raising {{the question of how}} they can modulate the vastly greater output of the power muscles during manoeuvres. Here we present the results of a synchrotron-based study performing micrometre-resolution, time-resolved microtomography on the 145 Hz wingbeat of blowflies. These data represent the first four-dimensional visualizations of an organism's internal movements on sub-millisecond and micrometre scales. This technique allows us to visualize and measure the three-dimensional movements of five of the largest steering muscles, and to place these {{in the context of the}} deforming thoracic mechanism that the muscles actuate. Our visualizations show that the steering muscles operate through a diverse range of nonlinear mechanisms, revealing several unexpected features that could not have been identified using any other technique. The tendons of some steering muscles buckle on every wingbeat to accommodate high amplitude movements of the wing hinge. Other steering muscles absorb kinetic energy from an oscillating control linkage, which rotates at low wingbeat amplitude but translates at high wingbeat amplitude. Kinetic energy is distributed differently in these two modes of oscillation, which may play a role in asymmetric power management during flight control. Structural flexibility is known to be important to the aerodynamic efficiency of insect wings, and to the function of their indirect power muscles. We show that it is integral also to the operation of the steering muscles, and so to the functional flexibility of the insect flight motor...|$|E
40|$|The use of reaction-diffusion models {{rests on}} the key {{assumption}} that the underlying diffusive process is Gaussian.

Here we present a study of front dynamics in reaction-diffusion systems where anomalous diffusion is due to the presence of <b>asymmetric</b> Levy <b>flights.</b> Our approach consists of replacing the Laplacian diffusion operator by a fractional diffusion operator, whose fundamental solutions are Levy α-stable distributions. Numerical simulation of the fractional Fisher-Kolmogorov equation, and analytical arguments show that anomalous diffusion leads to the exponential acceleration of fronts and a universal power law decay, x^-α, of the tail, where α, the index of the Levy distribution, is the order of the fractional derivative.

40|$|AbstractThreshold photoelectron–photoion {{coincidence}} (TPEPICO) spectroscopy {{has been}} used to investigate the unimolecular chemistry of gas-phase methyl 2 -methyl butanoate ions [CH 3 CH 2 CH(CH 3) COOCH 3 ·+]. This ester ion isomerizes to a lower energy distonic ion [CH 2 CH 2 CH(CH 3) COHOCH 3 ·+] prior to dissociating by the loss of C 2 H 4. The <b>asymmetric</b> time of <b>flight</b> distributions, which arise from the slow rate of dissociation at low ion energies, provide information about the ion dissociation rates. By modeling these rates with assumed k(E) functions, the thermal energy distribution for room temperature sample, and the analyzer function for threshold electrons, it was possible to extract the dissociative photoionization threshold for methyl 2 -methyl butanoate which at 0 K is 9. 80 ± 0. 01 eV as well as the dissociation barrier of the distonic ion of 0. 86 ± 0. 01 eV. By combining these with an estimated heat of formation of methyl 2 -methyl butanoate, we derive a 0 K heat of formation of the distonic ion CH 2 CH 2 CH(CH 3) COHOCH 3 ·+ of 101. 0 ± 2. 0 kcal/mol. The product ion is the enol of methyl propionate, CH 3 CHCOHOCH 3 ·+, which has a derived heat of formation at 0 K of 106. 0 ± 2. 0 kcal/mol...|$|R
40|$|International audienceDuring {{the past}} decade, {{efforts were made}} to develop a new {{generation}} of unmanned aircrafts, qualified as Micro-Air Vehicles. The particularity of these systems resides in their maximum dimension limited to 15 cm, which, in terms of aerodynamics, corresponds to low Reynolds number flows (Re & 102 to 104). At low Reynolds number, the concept of flapping wings seems to be an interesting alter- native to the conventional fixed and rotary wings. Despite the fact that this concept may lead to enhanced lift forces and efficiency ratios, it allows hovering coupled with a low-noise generation. Previous studies (Dickinson et al. in Science 284 : 1954 – 1960, 1999) revealed that the flow engendered by flapping wings is highly vortical and unsteady, inducing significant temporal variations of the loads experienced by the airfoil. In order to enhance the aerodynamic performance of such flapping wings, it is essential to give further insight into the loads generating mechanisms by correlating the spatial and temporal evolution of the vortical structures together with the time-dependent lift and drag. In this paper, Time Resolved Particle Image Velocimetry is used as a basis to evaluate both unsteady forces and vortical structures generated by an airfoil undergoing complex motion (i. e. <b>asymmetric</b> flapping <b>flight),</b> through the momentum equation approach and a multidimensional wavelet-like vortex parameterization method, respectively. The momentum equation approach relies on the integration of flow variables inside and around a control volume surrounding the airfoil (Noca et al. in J Fluids Struct 11 : 345 – 350, 1997; Unal et al. in J Fluids Struct 11 : 965 – 971, 1997). Besides the direct link performed between the flow behavior and the force mechanisms, the load characterization is here non-intrusive and specifically convenient for flapping flight studies thanks to its low Reynolds flows’ sensitivity and adaptability to moving bodies. Results are supported by a vortex parameterization which evaluates the circulation of the multiple vortices generated in such complex flows. The temporal evolution of the loads matches the flow behavior and hence reveals the preponderant inertial force component and that due to vortical structures...|$|R

40|$|Feathers are {{the most}} complex {{epidermal}} derivatives among vertebrates. The present review deals with the origin of feathers from archosaurian reptiles, the cellular and molecular aspects of feather morphogenesis, {{and focus on the}} synthesis of keratins and associated proteins. Feathers consist of different proteins among which exists a specialized group of small proteins called beta-keratins. Genes encoding these proteins in the chick genome are distributed in different chromosomes, and most genes encode for feather keratins. The latter are here recognized as proteins associated with the keratins of intermediate filaments, and functionally correspond to keratin-associated proteins of hairs, nails and horns in mammals. These small proteins possess unique properties, including resistance and scarce elasticity, and were inherited and modified in feathers from ancestral proteins present in the scales of archosaurian progenitors of birds. The proteins share a common structural motif, the core box, which was present in the proteins of the reptilian ancestors of birds. The core box allows the formation of filaments with a different molecular mechanism of polymerization from that of alpha-keratins. Feathers evolved after the establishment of a special morphogenetic mechanism gave rise to barb ridges. During development, the epidermal layers of feathers fold to produce barb ridges that produce the ramified structure of feathers. Among barb ridge cells, those of barb and barbules initially accumulate small amounts of alpha-keratins that are rapidly replaced by a small protein indicated as "feather keratin". This 10 kDa protein becomes the predominant form of corneous material of feathers. The main characteristics of feather keratins, their gene organization and biosynthesis {{are similar to those of}} their reptilian ancestors. Feather keratins allow elongation of feather cells among supportive cells that later degenerate and leave the ramified microstructure of barbs. In downfeathers, barbs are initially independent and form plumulaceous feathers that rest inside a follicle. Stem cells remain in the follicle and are responsible for the regeneration of pennaceous feathers. New barb ridges are produced and they merge to produce a rachis and a flat vane. The modulation of the growth pattern of barb ridges and their fusion into a rachis give rise to a broad variety of feather types, including <b>asymmetric</b> feathers for <b>flight.</b> Feather morphogenesis suggests possible stages for feather evolution and diversification from hair-like outgrowths of the skin found in fossils of pro-avian archosaurians. © 2008...|$|R
