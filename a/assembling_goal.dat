50|$|Ten of {{the twelve}} teams {{took part in the}} first ever round of Championship {{fixtures}} on Saturday, 8 September 1888 and although no league table was published in any of the newspapers of the time West Bromwich Albion would have been the very first table toppers. By modern-day calculations, Derby County would have been the first ever table toppers because of their superior goal difference which was +3 after the first game. Albion won 2-0 at Stoke in front of 4,500 spectators and would have headed Preston North End, Derby County and Everton by virtue of an infinite goal average as they kept a clean sheet. Goal Average was the number of goals scored divided by the number of goals conceded. Goal Average was used to separate teams who were tied on points at that time. Preston defeated Burnley 5-2, Derby were 6-3 winners at Bolton and Everton secured the points in a 2-1 victory over Accrington. Aston Villa defender Gershom Cox was thought to have earned the distinction of scoring the first ever league goal with an unfortunate own goal in a 1-1 draw with Wolverhampton Wanderers and Fred Dewhurst opening the scoring minutes later at Preston with the first intentional goal. However the post-match reports of relative kick-off times show most games were delayed allowing for crowds to <b>assemble.</b> A <b>goal</b> by England and Bolton winger Kenny Davenport 2 minutes into the match against Derby County was scored comfortably before any other and is now regarded as the first ever football league goal.|$|R

To accomplish this, a multi-center NASA team has been <b>assembled.</b> The <b>goal</b> of this team, led by NASA-Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC), is to develop propulsion technologies that demonstrate rocket and airbreathing combined-cycle operation (DRACO). Current technical activities include flowpath conceptual design, engine systems conceptual design, and feasibility studies investigating the integration and operation of the DRACO engine with a Lockheed D- 21 B drone. This paper focuses on {{the activities of the}} Flowpath Systems Product Development Team (PDT), led by NASA-Glenn Research Center (GRC) and supported by NASA-MSFC and TechLand Research, Inc. The objective of the Flowpath PDT {{at the start of the}} DRACO program was to establish a conceptual design of the flowpath aerodynamic lines, determine the preliminary performance, define the internal environments, and support the DRACO testbed concept feasibility studies. To accomplish these tasks, the PDT convened to establish a baseline flowpath concept. With the conceptual lines defined, cycle analysis tasks were planned and the flowpath performance and internal environments were defined. Additionally, sensitivity studies investigating the effects of inlet reference area, combustion performance, and combustor/nozzle materials selection were performed to support the Flowpath PDT design process. Results of these tasks are the emphasis of this paper and are intended to verify the feasibility of the DRACO flowpath and engine system as well as identify the primary technical challenges inherent in the flight-weight design of an advanced propulsion technology demonstration engine.

As global energy reserves deplete over the coming decades, a strategy of reduced consumption will be essential {{to the production of}} furniture and architecture, alike. A lightweight design strategy is a way for designers to participate in reducing the environmental footprint of everyday objects. We are witnessing a Paradigm shift in design and the decorative arts of a magnitude not seen since the Modernist movement in the early 20 th century. A design style embraces the combination of sustainability with building production. Today we recognizes that our resources are finite and that careful consideration should be given to the building process. Since ecological concern of materials become one of the foremost issues of today's building industry, For this project, I developed a lightweight and low-cost framing system that is collapsible and easy to <b>assemble.</b> My <b>goal</b> is to create compelling designs in the hope they will inspire people to choose sustainable design over safer and more traditional designs. Making building from thin bent plywood yields 9 - 10 times more usable wood from a log than making a building from hardwood lumber During the production of plywood, only 15 percent of the wood from a log is lost to waste. On the other hand, the average waste it takes to make a finished solid wood frame building is 1. 5 times more wood than is used in the building itself! Bent plywood has been utilized by a mere handful of designer, most notably Alvar Aalto and Charles and Ray Eames, but the application of this material remained in furniture scale. (cont.) Since the creative potential of this material is still largely unexplored. My motivation is to extend the application of this very particular thin material-plywood. by Edmund King Yip Kwong.

40|$|A {{deterministic}} {{behavior of}} systems composed of several modules is a desirable design <b>goal.</b> <b>Assembling</b> a complex system from components requires also {{a high degree}} of re-usability. The compatibility of the selected components may become a problem even at abstract design levels, due to possible different degrees of model determinacy, possible different execution models, etc. In this cases, an overall deterministic system behavior is difficult to achieve. The development of communication mechanisms between such components will have then to accommodate the differences, so that both correct processing and information exchange (data and control, appropriate choices and relative timing or sequencing) are achieved. For instance, human-machine interaction offers a good example of cooperation between deterministic models (machines) communicating with highly non-deterministic counterparts (the human models, if not restricted). We analyze here such communication mechanisms by “confronting” synchronized and un-synchronized models of execution, in the framework of action systems, a state based formalism. We “force ” the two models to coexist within the same context and explore the possibilities of building trustworthy communication channels between them. We base our approach on a combined polling- interrupt scheme, which allows us to mitigate communication issues that may otherwise compromise the correct input-output system behavior. More robust system models are obtained by applying specific correctness rules of refinement. We illustrate our methods on an audio system example, implementable as either a software or a hardware device...|$|R

For example, discovery of pathological alternative splicing may allow {{the development of new}} treatments or better management of patients. From an analysis perspective, {{there are several ways to}} approach RNA-seq data to unravel differential transcript usage, such as annotation-based exon-level counting, differential analysis of the percentage spliced in, or quantitative analysis of <b>assembled</b> transcripts. The <b>goal</b> of this research is to compare and contrast current state-of-the-art methods, and to suggest improvements to commonly used work flows. RESULTS We assess the performance of representative work flows using synthetic data and explore the effect of using non-standard counting bin definitions as input to DEXSeq, a state-of-the-art inference engine. Although the canonical counting provided the best results overall, several non-canonical approaches were as good or better in specific aspects and most counting approaches outperformed the evaluated event- and assembly-based methods. We show that an incomplete annotation catalog can have a detrimental effect on the ability to detect differential transcript usage in transcriptomes with few isoforms per gene and that isoform-level prefiltering can considerably improve false discovery rate control. CONCLUSION Count-based methods generally perform well in the detection of differential transcript usage. Controlling the false discovery rate at the imposed threshold is difficult, particularly in complex organisms, but can be improved by prefiltering the annotation catalog...|$|R
40|$|Mechanical joints {{can have}} {{significant}} {{effects on the}} dynamics of <b>assembled</b> structures. The <b>goal</b> of our work is to develop physics based, reduced-order, finite element models {{that are capable of}} replicating the effects of joints on vibrating structures. Various studies have shown that micro- and macroslip along the joint interface cause the interface stiffness to change and introduce energy dissipation, leading to the observed hysteresis. The authors recently developed the so-called adjusted Iwan beam element (AIBE) for finite element analysis of jointed beam structures. The element consists of two adjusted Iwan models that are arranged to give two-dimensional beam behavior. The adjusted Iwan model is a combination of springs and factional sliders that exhibits hysteretic behavior due to the stick-slip behavior of the sliders. In this paper, the sensitivity of the performance of an adjusted Iwan model, particularly its capacity to dissipate energy, to variations in its parameters is studied. Parametric analysis is also carried out on the adjusted Iwan beam element to investigate the effects of joint parameters on dynamic responses of jointed beams. Hammer tests are conducted on a jointed beam and its monolithic counterpart. The decay envelopes of impulsive responses for the two systems exhibit distinctly different dynamic properties. To verify that the adjusted Iwan beam element is capable of actually modeling the effects of joints on a vibrating structure, numerical simulations are performed of two hammer tests with different forcing levels. The joint parameters of the jointed beam are identified from the experimentally-obtained acceleration response from one hammer test by using a multi-layer feed-forward neural network (MLFF). Then, using the identified joint parameters, acceleration responses of the jointed beam in the other hammer test are predicted. The capability of the AIBE to capture the effects of bolted joints on the dynamic responses of beam structures is demonstrated through good agreement between simulated and experimental results...|$|R

By means of computational integration in a probabilistic model of high throughput data sets from DNA, RNA and protein assays, combined with data mining for individual genes to phenotypes treats, such network has been <b>assembled</b> with the <b>goal</b> of providing a [...]...meaningful, functional gene network and to draw new and unforeseen connections...(Costello et al. 2009). D.m. is of course a model organism for too many instances in genetics and genomics. One particular feature that is long known for the genetic structure of D.m., is the fact that gene regulation is largely determined by the action of a relatively small set of molecules that are able to exert transcriptional control in the highly active stages of development and proliferation (Baker 2001; Brennecke et al. 2007; Harrison et al. 2011; Wells 2009). For instance, aspects of regeneration are often regulated by complex mechanisms of activation for several growth regulatory pathways in damaged tissue. It has been proved that every pathway involved is being regulated by the p 53 molecule in D.m., (dP 53). dP 53 is thus a critical master regulator in the GRN of D.m., in particular with regards to cell growth, proliferation and differentiation. Interestingly enough, the human homolog of this very molecule is known to play a quite important role in most human cancers. dP 53 is by no means the only master regulator in drosophila; an extremely important gene that acts as a universal master regulator in D.m. is the molecule called eyeless (ey). This gene was first study in relation to eye development (hence the name, larvae with knocked-up eye does not develop eyes). However, the role of ey is not restricted to eye development. Abnormal expression of the gene is able to convert other tissues into eye-cells, including legs, wings and antennae. ey is also involved in controlling the processes that coordinate differentiation of several cell types in a very precise way in order to develop the fly eye. The ey-homolog Pax 6 and homologs of other eye determination genes from D.m., are also required for tissue development in vertebrates. It has been shown that ey becomes a master regulator of development deep until later stages by means of regulation by signaling through the Notch and EGFR signaling pathways (two outstanding important generalistic signaling pathways) (Baker 2001).|$|R

Coalizão é um tipo de estrutura organizacional temporária, montada com objetivos específicos. A teoria dos jogos estuda formalmente o fenômeno coalizional, se detendo em demonstrações de propriedades e características dessa estrutura. A área de sistemas multiagentes, por outro lado, tem mostrado significativo interesse nas estruturas coalizionais como forma de organizar a cooperação entre os agentes, dedicando-se ao desenvolvimento de algoritmos para formação de coalizões. Esse trabalho apresenta um algoritmo de formação de coalizões para compartilhamento de recursos, denominado heurística ganha-ganha. Definimos um modelo que utiliza a abstração de recursos para representar tanto a posse de habilidades e objetos, quanto para representar os objetivos dos agentes. Um jogo de votação k-ponderado é utilizado para implementar o processo decisório de quais coalizões são válidas e o algoritmo testa iterativamente cada vizinhança de um agente na busca de associações vantajosas. Demonstramos que o algoritmo incrementa monotonicamente o bem-estar da sociedade e {{converge}} para uma estrutura coalizional.

This dissertation presents an algorithm to coalition formation named win-win heuristic. We define a model which uses the abstraction of resources to represent either, the possession of abilities and objects, or to represent the agents target. A k-weight voting game is used to implement the decision process of what coalitions are worth and an iteratively algorithm tests each agent neighborhood in the pursue of better associations. We demonstrate that the algorithm monotonically increases the society welfare and converges to a coalitional structure. We also show empirically that the heuristic is efficient for resource sharing in situations of availability of resources, building coalitions with few iterations and a large amount of agents...|$|R

These changes are {{inevitable}} {{for each of us}} (Čevela, Kalvach, Čeledová, 2012). When we speak of geriatric patient, we mean a patient older than 75 years. This is the classification of World Health Organisation (WHO). Aging leads to loss of physical and mental strength and to somatic changes some of which are highly visible at first sight (Haškovcová, 2010). General nurse with knowledge about the issues of geriatric patients can get them the optimal nursing care to be able to support their bodily functions and maintain functional fitness. Evaluating the abilities of geriatric patient, then enables general nurse to set reasonable care and then perform preventive and therapeutic interventions (Pokorná, 2013). Aim of the study The aim was to map the issue of nursing care for geriatric patients in acute beds and beds for long-term care from the perspective of nurses and also from the perspective of patients. Four research questions (RQ) were then <b>assembled</b> for these <b>goals.</b> RQ 1 : How nurses perceive the problems of nursing care for geriatric patients in acute beds? RQ 2 : How nurses perceive problems of nursing care for geriatric patients on long-term care beds? RQ 3 : How geriatric patients perceive nursing care received from nurses in acute beds? RQ 4 : How geriatric patients perceive nursing care received from nurses on long-term care beds? Methods For the empirical part of the bachelor thesis was used qualitative research. For the purpose of the data collection were used interviews, which consisted of pre-built key questions and according to willingness of the individual respondents to share their opinions were inserted additional questions. The survey consisted a total of 20 respondents, of which 10 respondents were from the Department of aftercare and 10 respondents from the orthopedic department. Of these ten respondents were 5 nurses and 5 patients in each ward. The research was carried out in the hospital bed area of the department of aftercare and orthopedic department. The interviews were transcribed verbatim and then categories were created to methodology, which showed what troubled the patients during hospitalization the most, and what nurses see as the biggest challenge when working with geriatric patients. The results By the nurses from the department of aftercare, patient immobility, lack of cooperation with disoriented patients, problems with emptying, usually constipation, change in the environment as a factor disturbing the sleep of the patient, not keeping the drinking regime, despite the patient claiming otherwise and not least the patient's hearing loss that nuisance communication between staff and patient and finally the patient's hearing loss that nuisance communication between staff and patient are seen as the biggest problems. Nurses from the orthopedic department see the biggest problem in the movement impairment of the patients, the pain that patients experience after surgery and the stress that accompanies the patient before surgery. Furthermore, problems with emptying, difficulty sleeping, patient's non-compliance and hearing loss. All interviewed patients complained the most about the lack of privacy during hospitalization, especially during their personal hygiene, about the fellow patients who disturb their sleep, as well as the lack of communication on the part of nurses.
