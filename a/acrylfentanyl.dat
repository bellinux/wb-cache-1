50|$|As {{acrylamide}} derivatives {{are often}} used in drug discovery to make covalent inhibitors which will bind irreversibly to its target, <b>acrylfentanyl</b> is claimed to be naloxone resistant. However, acute intoxications with <b>acrylfentanyl</b> on mice threatened by naloxone (2 mg/kg) have shown that <b>acrylfentanyl</b> could be displaced from the opioid receptor.|$|E
50|$|As of 16 August 2016, <b>acrylfentanyl</b> {{is illegal}} in Sweden.|$|E
50|$|<b>Acrylfentanyl</b> (also {{known as}} acryloylfentanyl) {{is a highly}} potent opioid {{analgesic}} that is an analog of fentanyl and has been sold online as a designer drug. In animal studies the IC50 or half maximal inhibitory concentration for <b>acrylfentanyl</b> to displace naloxone is 1.4 nM, being slightly more potent than fentanyl itself (1.6 nM) as well as having a longer duration of action.|$|E
50|$|<b>Acrylfentanyl</b> {{has been}} linked to 20 deaths in Sweden as well as two deaths in Denmark in summer 2016.|$|E
40|$|<b>Acrylfentanyl</b> is a {{synthetic}} opioid {{that has been}} widely used in the last year. To help {{in the fight against}} synthetic drugs two potential metabolites of <b>acrylfentanyl,</b> one monohydroxy and one dihydroxy were synthesized. These metabolites will hopefully later be implemented in the analytical methods for metabolites of <b>acrylfentanyl</b> in urine by the Swedish National Board of Forensic Medicine. To have metabolites for analysis are very important as they are the main target in drug testing. The method used to synthesize the metabolites is a five-step synthesis with an additional 6 th step for the dihydroxy metabolite. The methods used in the synthesis includes protection of amine with tert-butyloxycarbonyl, reductive amination with sodium triaceto boronhydride, alkylation and demethylation with boron tribromide. The methods used produced good results with high yields in nearly all steps...|$|E
