25|$|The {{ferruginous}} colour pigmenting is finely disseminated {{over the}} surface of individual grains and accounts for <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>small</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> the rock. It is thought that where the rock is grey or grey green either from primary or secondary causes, the oxide has been chemically removed during deposition and thus unmasking the true colour of the minerals in the sediment. The active principle is still unknown.|$|E
25|$|Although {{transitional}} fossils {{elucidate the}} evolutionary transition of one life-form to another, they only exemplify snapshots of this process. Due {{to the special}} circumstances required for preservation of living beings, only <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>small</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> all life-forms that ever have existed {{can be expected to}} be discovered. Thus, the transition itself can only be illustrated and corroborated by transitional fossils, but it will never be known in detail. Progressing research and discovery managed to fill in several gaps and continues to do so. Critics of evolution often cite this argument as being a convenient way to explain off the lack of 'snapshot' fossils that show crucial steps between species.|$|E
25|$|The Davis {{campaign}} {{tried to}} run against the recall Yes/No vote instead of against the candidates that were trying to replace him. Davis tried to depict the recall as a $66 million waste of money that could allow a candidate with <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>small</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> the vote to become Governor—potentially someone who was very liberal or conservative. There are no primaries in a recall election. Davis {{tried to run}} “outside the recall circus” and to make himself appear gubernatorial and hard at work for California, and who had made improvements to education and healthcare. Early August polls showed that over 50% supported the recall.|$|E

25|$|While {{indigenous}} people make up <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>small</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> {{the population of}} the region, the Huasteca culture has had a strong impact since the pre Hispanic period. Most of the region is considered to be at least nominally the far western part of this cultural region. Huapango is the dominant native musical and dance style in the Sierra Gorda, with festivals dedicated to it in Xichú, Pinal de Amoles, San Joaquín, where Huasteca influence is strongest. Most of the population lives in very small rural communities, many under 500 inhabitants. There are no notable social conflicts in this area, which is free of problems related to the illegal drug trade that afflict other parts of the country.|$|E
25|$|Only <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>small</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> {{the economy}} is based on fishing and forestry. Fishing {{is not a major}} {{economic}} activity as it is limited to the small rivers and lakes of the region. Of the two major lakes, one is shared with neighboring Michoacán state. Of the fish is that is caught or raised, most is carp, followed by mojarra. There are 150,000 hectares of forest in the state, which about half theoretically exploitable. However, forests in this state have been historically depleted with species such as holm oak, pine and oyamel in danger of extinction. The lack of forest cover has led to erosion and other environmental problems. Most forestry products come from pine and holm oak, with most being harvested in the area around the city of Guanajuato.|$|E
25|$|The opsins (photopigments) {{present in}} the L and M cones are encoded on the X chromosome; {{defective}} encoding of these leads to the two most common forms of color blindness. The OPN1LW gene, which codes for the opsin {{present in the}} L cones, is highly polymorphic (a recent study by Verrelli and Tishkoff found 85 variants {{in a sample of}} 236 men). <b>A</b> <b>very</b> <b>small</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> women may have an extra type of color receptor because they have different alleles for the gene for the L opsin on each X chromosome. X chromosome inactivation means that while only one opsin is expressed in each cone cell, both types occur overall, and some women may therefore show a degree of tetrachromatic color vision. Variations in OPN1MW, which codes the opsin expressed in M cones, appear to be rare, and the observed variants have no effect on spectral sensitivity.|$|E
