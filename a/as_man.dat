With the help of Payne, whom she kept in the dark about the details, Mary Shelley obtained false passports for the couple. In 1828, she fell ill with smallpox while visiting them in Paris. Weeks later she recovered, unscarred but without her youthful beauty.|$|E

5|$|Powerviolence is a raw and dissonant subgenre of {{hardcore}} punk. The {{style is}} closely related to thrashcore and similar to grindcore. While powerviolence took inspiration from Napalm Death and other early grind bands, powerviolence groups avoided elements of heavy metal. Its nascent form was pioneered in the late 1980s in the music of hardcore punk band Infest, who mixed youth crew hardcore elements with noisier, sludgier qualities of Lärm and Siege. The microgenre solidified into its most commonly recognized form in the early 1990s, with the sounds of bands such <b>as</b> <b>Man</b> Is the Bastard, Crossed Out, No Comment, Capitalist Casualties, and Manpig.|$|E

5|$|Carrick {{had been}} {{regularly}} overlooked by various England managers {{when it came}} to the central roles, with Frank Lampard and Steven Gerrard generally being preferred. He started nine games under Sven-Göran Eriksson and his successor Steve McClaren. His last appearance under McClaren was in a 2–1 defeat at home to Germany in August 2007. Newly appointed manager Fabio Capello left Carrick out of his first England squad on 2 February 2008. During Capello's first year in charge of England Carrick was largely overlooked. However, he was named in Capello's squad for the game against the Czech Republic, but was forced to withdraw after sustaining an injury during Manchester United's game with Newcastle United. In November 2008, he returned to the squad for a friendly against Germany in Berlin. Starting alongside Gareth Barry in central midfield in England's 2–1 victory, he was named <b>as</b> <b>Man</b> of the Match by the BBC.|$|E
5|$|Love {{continued}} to work as an actress into the early 2000s, appearing in big-budget pictures such <b>as</b> <b>Man</b> on the Moon (1999) and Trapped (2002), before releasing her first solo album, America's Sweetheart, in 2004. The next few years were marked by publicity surrounding Love's legal troubles and drug addiction, {{which resulted in a}} mandatory lockdown rehabilitation sentence in 2005 while she {{was in the process of}} writing a second planned solo album. That project became Nobody's Daughter, which was released in 2010 as a Hole album but without any other members of the former lineups. Between 2014 and 2015, she released two solo singles and returned to acting in the network series Sons of Anarchy and Empire.|$|E
5|$|McDowall fined Revie £27 {{for missing}} {{two weeks of}} {{training}} for a family holiday in Blackpool, which infuriated him as he had already won permission from trainer Laurie Barnett and had promised to train whilst on holiday. McDowall dropped Revie {{for much of the}} 1955–56 season, preferring instead to play Bobby Johnstone. Revie played only one FA Cup match that season before being named in the team for the 1956 FA Cup Final against Birmingham City, with Johnstone being moved to the wings. He provided the assist for Joe Hayes's opening goal, and instructed Ken Barnes to deviate from the manager's instructions at half-time, with the result being a more dominant second half display and a 3–1 victory; Revie was named <b>as</b> <b>Man</b> of the Match. However the rift with his manager was not forgotten, and he was moved to right-half in the 1956–57 campaign, leaving him to seek a move away from Maine Road.|$|E

5|$|On 6 June 2014, Benzema {{was named}} in France's squad for the 2014 FIFA World Cup, making his {{debut in the}} tournament. In the team's first match, a 3–0 win against Honduras in Porto Alegre on 15 June, he scored a goal in each half, the first from a penalty kick.

He was named by FIFA <b>as</b> <b>man</b> of the match for his performance. In the second group fixture, he scored and had a penalty saved in a 5–2 defeat of Switzerland, as Les Bleus all but secured qualification to the knockout stage. France were later knocked out by Germany in the quarter-final stage of the tournament.|$|E
5|$|Over 34 total appearances, Tomkins {{improved}} on his 2009 {{record with}} 21 tries and four goals. In the league, he claimed four braces in total: once as a stand-off against Hull, {{and three times}} as a fullback against Salford, Hull again and Leeds. He also scored a try during the Grand Final against St. Helens. Despite finishing the season as Wigan's regular fullback, Tomkins maintained {{his place in the}} 2010 Super League Dream Team in the stand-off position. Also in the team was Joel Tomkins at second-row. This was the first time a Super League Dream Team had featured two brothers. At 2010's Super League XV awards evening, where his Wigan teammate Pat Richards was voted by his fellow Super League players <b>as</b> <b>Man</b> of Steel for having the biggest impact on the season, Tomkins retained his Young Player of the Year title.

5|$|Pathan {{made his}} name in Tests on the December tour to Bangladesh. Swinging the ball both ways, Pathan took 5/45 and 6/51 {{including}} several LBW decisions in the First Test in Dhaka to claim his first ten-wicket haul and his first Test man of the match award as India claimed a commanding innings victory. He followed this with a match haul of 7/118 in the following match in Chittagong to take 18 wickets at 11.88 to be named <b>as</b> <b>man</b> of the series. India swept the series, winning both matches by an innings. Although the Indian batsmen scored heavily, Pathan managed only five and four. He played in {{only one of the}} three ODIs against the hosts as India rotated their players, taking 1/45 and scoring 21 not out in an 11-run win.|$|E

5|$|The {{story of}} Ila, a king cursed by Shiva and Parvati to {{be a man}} one month and a woman the next, appears in several {{traditional}} Hindu texts. After changing sex, Ila loses the memory of being the other gender. During one such period, Ila marries Budha (the god of the planet Mercury). Although Budha knows of Ila's alternating gender, he doesn't enlighten the 'male' Ila, who remains unaware of his life as a woman. The two live together <b>as</b> <b>man</b> and wife only when Ila is female. In the Ramayana version, Ila bears Budha a son, although in the Mahabharata Ila is called both mother and father of the child. After this birth the curse is lifted and Ila is totally changed into a man who goes on to father several children with his wife.|$|E
5|$|Treatises {{such as the}} Vishnudharmottara Purana {{and various}} Agamas {{describe}} the iconography of the ayudhapurushas. Shakti is depicted as a red-hued woman seated on a wolf.

The Dhanus (bow) is a red lotus coloured female with a stringed bow on her head. The Vishnudharmottara Purana describes Chakra <b>as</b> <b>man</b> with a fat belly and round eyes, decorated with various ornaments and holding a chamara (chowry) and with Vishnu's left hand on his head.

5|$|On 9 November 2013, Hooper scored {{his first}} Premier League goal from the penalty spot against West Ham United at Carrow Road {{to level the}} scores at 1–1. Norwich City won the match 3–1, with Hooper being voted <b>as</b> <b>Man</b> of the Match. Due to this goal, {{he became the first}} player to score in the top 4 {{divisions}} of the English league, the top division of the Scottish League and two cup competitions in each country, as well as the UEFA Champions League and UEFA Europa League.
