Additional claims included product liability for making [...] "defective" [...] products (the defects alleged were violent features and lack of warnings) and violation of RICO, the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, for distributing this material to minors.

Lonsdale stated [...] "Basically, I'm filming a pseudo-documentary for one of our free-access Pinellas web channels," [...] and said that while filming a Scientologist came out of a coffee shop and yelled that Lonsdale was a religious bigot. Lonsdale stated [...] "I picked up the camera again and started filming him ... He went right for my face and my head, backed me up into a pole to which I had no other choice but to defend myself."

After viewing the videotape, the Assistant State Attorney stated [...] "it is just {{not going to be a}} prosecutable case," [...] and said that the video shows [...] "pretty much mutual aggression" [...] between Lonsdale and the Scientologist. The Assistant State Attorney stated that the video showed aggression on both sides, and that Lonsdale's criticism of Scientology on the internet made the case [...] "unprosecutable". Lonsdale's attorney Luke Lirot stated [...] "It is another example of the State Attorney's Office's historical reluctance to tangle with Scientology." [...] Scientology spokeswoman Pat Harney said that church members had been told to avoid Lonsdale, and told the St. Petersburg Times that Scientologists had complained to police that they felt Lonsdale was stalking them. The police did not charge Lonsdale, stating that he had the right to take photos and video in public places.|$|E
