5|$|Aquatic beetles use several {{techniques}} for retaining air beneath the water's surface. Diving beetles (Dytiscidae) hold <b>air</b> <b>between</b> the abdomen and the elytra when diving. Hydrophilidae have hairs on their under surface that retain {{a layer of}} air against their bodies. Adult crawling water beetles use both their elytra and their hind coxae (the basal segment of the back legs) in air retention, while whirligig beetles simply carry an air bubble down with them whenever they dive.|$|E

5|$|In {{east central}} Florida, a warm sector, {{a region of}} warm surface <b>air</b> <b>between</b> a cold front and a warm front, was {{positioned}} ahead of a progressing cold front. Large scale lift {{was supported by a}} very strong jet stream aloft, with strong vertical shear evident, conducive for rotating thunderstorms and tornadoes. Instability increased overnight with temperatures and dew points increasing through the pre-dawn hours. For example, northwest of Orlando, temperatures were still at , which was about 3 degrees warmer than the average high for the day and 14 degrees warmer than the average low.

5|$|In the sub-basement {{were the}} Sprague screw {{machines}} for the electric elevators, the fire pumps, the house pumps, the ice plant, {{and the six}} Babcock & Wilcox waler tube boilers. The elevator system, which served the house from subbasement to roof, was electric, taking its power from the generating plant within the building. There were 18 elevators. The machinery was located in the sub-basement. The boilers aggregated about 3,000 horse power, the electric generators taking 2,200 horse-power of the total energy. The elevators were run by it, as were the 15,000 incandescent lamps, branching from 7,500 outlets. The system of heating and ventilating the public rooms was that of forced draught by means of powerful blowers situated in the sub-basement that forced the fresh <b>air</b> <b>between</b> steam-coils, where it became moderately heated before entering the ducts that lead it to the various rooms. This heat was further augmented by direct radiators placed behind screens in the recesses of the windows and elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|A {{potential}} Agent Carter {{series was}} initially {{brought up in}} July 2013 by Louis D'Esposito, after a screening of his Agent Carter One-Shot at San Diego Comic-Con.

In January 2014, ABC Entertainment Group president Paul Lee confirmed that the show was in development, and revealed that Tara Butters and Michele Fazekas would act as the series' showrunners. Chris Dingess also serves as a showrunner. In March 2014, Christopher Markus & Stephen McFeely, writers of the Captain America films, stated that they envisioned the series, which had not yet been greenlit, as a limited series of approximately 13 episodes. By April 2014, there were indications that the series would be ordered straight to series, bypassing a pilot order, and would <b>air</b> <b>between</b> the late 2014 and early 2015 portions of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., if that series got a second season renewal. On May 8, 2014, ABC officially ordered the series for eight episodes, with executive producers Butters, Fazekas, Markus, McFeely, Dingess, Kevin Feige, Louis D'Esposito, Alan Fine, Joe Quesada, Stan Lee, and Jeph Loeb.

25|$|The virus spreads {{by direct}} contact with body fluids, such as blood, of an {{infected}} human or other animals. This may also occur through contact with an item recently contaminated with bodily fluids. Spread of the disease through the <b>air</b> <b>between</b> primates, including humans, has not been documented in either laboratory or natural conditions. Semen or breast milk of a person after recovery from EVD may carry the virus for several weeks to months. Fruit bats {{are believed to be}} the normal carrier in nature, able to spread the virus without being affected by it. Other diseases such as malaria, cholera, typhoid fever, meningitis and other viral hemorrhagic fevers may resemble EVD. Blood samples are tested for viral RNA, viral antibodies or for the virus itself to confirm the diagnosis.|$|E
25|$|Alexander Kartveli, Republic's Chief Designer, {{devised a}} {{solution}} to these problems. He proposed using a Wright J67 turbojet (a license-built derivative of the Bristol Olympus) supplemented by an RJ55-W-1 ramjet behind it. Connecting the two were a series of movable ducts that could route <b>air</b> <b>between</b> the engines. At low speeds the aircraft would be powered by the J67, with the RJ55 acting as a traditional afterburner, producing {{a total of about}} 40,000lbf (180kN) thrust. At high speeds, starting above Mach 2.2, the jet engine would be shut down and the airflow from the intake would be routed around the jet engine and directly into the RJ55. Although the net thrust was reduced by shutting down the jet, operating on the ramjet alone allowed the aircraft to reach much higher speeds.|$|E

25|$|The ASEAN Single Aviation Market (ASEAN-SAM) is the region's {{aviation}} policy geared {{towards the}} development of a unified and single aviation market in Southeast Asia. The aviation policy was proposed by the ASEAN Air Transport Working Group, supported by the ASEAN Senior Transport Officials Meeting, and endorsed by the ASEAN Transport Ministers. The ASEAN-SAM is expected to liberalise air travel between member-states in the ASEAN region, allowing ASEAN airlines to benefit directly from the growth in air travel, and also free up tourism, trade, investment, and service flows between member states. Since 1 December 2008, restrictions on the third and fourth freedoms of the <b>air</b> <b>between</b> capital cities of member states for air passenger services have been removed, while from 1 January 2009, full liberalisation of air freight services in the region took effect. On 1 January 2011, full liberalisation on fifth freedom traffic rights between all capital cities took effect. The ASEAN Single Aviation Market policy supersedes existing unilateral, bilateral, and multilateral air services agreements among member states which are inconsistent with its provisions.|$|E
