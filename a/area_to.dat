5|$|Aaron Ward and Sterett, {{independently}} {{searching for}} targets, both sighted Yūdachi, who appeared {{unaware of the}} approach of the two U.S. destroyers. Both U.S.ships hit Yūdachi simultaneously with gunfire and torpedoes, heavily damaging the destroyer and forcing her crew to abandon ship. The ship did not sink right away, however. Continuing on her way, Sterett was suddenly ambushed by Teruzuki, heavily damaged, and forced to withdraw from the battle <b>area</b> <b>to</b> the east. Aaron Ward wound up in a one-on-one duel with Kirishima, which the destroyer lost with heavy damage. She also tried to retire from the battle <b>area</b> <b>to</b> the east but soon stopped dead in the water because the engines were damaged.|$|E

30|$|This system {{comprises}} ten generators with valve-point {{loading and}} multi-fuel sources having three fuel options. Transmission loss is considered here. The generator data {{has been taken}} from [13]. The total load demand is 2700 MW. The ten generators are divided into three areas. Area 1 consists of the first four units; area 2 includes the next three units and area 3 includes the last three units. The load demand in area 1 is assumed as 50 % of the total demand. The load demand in area 2 is assumed as 25 % and in area 3 is taken as 25 % of the total demand. The power flow limit from <b>area</b> 1 <b>to</b> <b>area</b> 2 or from <b>area</b> 2 <b>to</b> <b>area</b> 1 is 100 MW. The power flow limit from <b>area</b> 1 <b>to</b> <b>area</b> 3 or from <b>area</b> 3 <b>to</b> <b>area</b> 1 is 100 MW.
