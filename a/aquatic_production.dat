50|$|Agricultural science {{suffered}} from changes in policy and emphasis after the 1950s. The Cultural Revolution disrupted agricultural science training and research programs, {{but since the}} mid-1970s training and research programs have been restored. Government officials emphasized practical, production-oriented scientific work. The rural extension system popularized new techniques and new inputs, such as sprinkler irrigation systems. In 1987 eighty-four agricultural colleges and research institutes pursued research in seven broad fields: agriculture, forestry, <b>aquatic</b> <b>production,</b> land reclamation, mechanization, water conservation, and meteorology. In addition, almost 500 agricultural schools had a total staff of 29,000 teachers and 71,000 students. Since the early 1980s thousands of researchers and students were sent abroad. Research was being strengthened by the construction of sixteen regionally distributed agricultural experiment stations. New agricultural journals and societies were established to promote the dissemination of research results within the country. The Chinese sought technical information abroad as well through the import of technology and machinery and the international exchange of delegations.|$|E
40|$|Widespread {{ecological}} reorganizations {{and increases}} in organic carbon (OC) in lakes across the Northern Hemisphere have raised concerns {{about the impact of}} the ongoing climate warming on aquatic ecosystems and carbon cycling. We employed diverse biogeochemical techniques on a highresolution sediment record from a subarctic lake in northern Finland (70 °N) to examine the direction, magnitude and mechanism of change in aquatic carbon pools prior to and under the anthropogenic warming. Coupled variation in the elemental and isotopic composition of the sediment and a proxybased summer air temperature reconstruction tracked changes in <b>aquatic</b> <b>production,</b> depicting a decline during a cool climate interval between ~ 1700 – 1900 C.

OC accumulation rates displayed similar coeval variation with temperature, mirroring both changes in <b>aquatic</b> <b>production</b> and terrestrial carbon export. Increase in sediment organic content over the 20 th century together with high inferred aquatic UV exposure imply that the 20 th century increase in OC accumulation is primarily connected to elevated lake production rather than terrestrial inputs.

40|$|Freshwaters in the Athabasca Oil Sands Region (AOSR) are {{vulnerable}} to the atmospheric emissions and land disturbances caused by the local oil sands industry; however, they are also affected by climate change. Recent observations of increases in <b>aquatic</b> primary <b>production</b> near the main development area have prompted questions about the principal drivers of these limnological changes. Is the enhanced primary production due to deposition of nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) from local industry or from recent climatic changes? Here, we use downcore, spectrally-inferred chlorophyll-a (VRS-chla) profiles (including diagenetic products) from 23 limnologically-diverse lakes with undisturbed catchments to characterize the pattern of primary production increases in the AOSR. Our aim is {{to better understand the}} relative roles of the local oil sands industry versus climate change in driving <b>aquatic</b> primary <b>production</b> trends. Nutrient deposition maps, generated using geostatistical interpolations of spring-time snowpack measurements from a grid pattern across the AOSR, demonstrate patterns of elevated total phosphorus, total nitrogen, and bioavailable nitrogen deposition around the main area of industrial activity. However, this pattern is not observed for bioavailable phosphorus. Our paleolimnological findings demonstrate consistently greater VRS-chla concentrations compared to pre-oil sands development levels, regardless of morphological and limnological characteristics, landscape position, bioavailable nutrient deposition, and dibenzothiophene (DBT) -inferred industrial impacts. Furthermore, breakpoint analyses on VRS-chla concentrations across a gradient of DBT-inferred industrial impact show limited evidence of a contemporaneous change among lakes. Despite the contribution of bioavailable nitrogen to the landscape from industrial activities, we find no consistency in the spatial pattern and timing of VRS-chla shifts with an industrial fertilizing signal. Instead, significant positive correlations were observed between VRS-chla and annual and seasonal temperatures. Our findings suggest warmer air temperatures and likely decreased ice covers are important drivers of enhanced <b>aquatic</b> primary <b>production</b> across the AOSR...|$|R

40|$|Tropical {{floodplains}} {{are one of}} {{the most}} productive ecosystems on earth. Studies on floodplain productivity have primarily focused on trees and macrophytes, rather than algae, due to their greater biomass. However, epiphyton—algae and bacteria attached to the submerged portion of aquatic macrophytes—is a major source of energy in many tropical floodplains. Epiphyton productivity rates are unknown for most tropical floodplain wetlands, and spatial variability is not well understood. In this study, we measured primary productivity of epiphyton in Kakadu National Park in northern Australia. We estimated the relative contribution of epiphyton to <b>aquatic</b> <b>production</b> (epiphyton, + phytoplankton + macrophytes). We sampled sites dominated by different macrophyte structural types: vertical emerging grasses, horizontal emerging grasses, submerged macrophytes, and macrophytes with floating leaves. Epiphyton productivity was highly influenced by the structural type of the macrophyte. Highest potential productivity per weight was measured from epiphyton growing on macrophytes with floating leaves and horizontal grasses (1. 52 ± 0. 53 and 1. 82 ± 0. 61 mgC/dw g epiphyton/h, respectively) and lowest in submerged macrophytes and vertical grasses (0. 57 ± 0. 26 and 0. 66 ± 0. 47 mgC/dw g epiphyton/h, respectively). When considering the areal biomass of the macrophyte and the amount of epiphyton attached, epiphyton on horizontal grasses and submerged macrophytes had productivity values approximately ten times higher (45 – 219 mgC/m 2 /d) compared to those on vertical grasses and macrophytes with floating leaves (2 – 18 mgC/m 2 /d).

As a result of maintaining a metabolic balance, different “pools” of aquatic carbon are influenced by ecosystem processes related to ecosystem metabolism and function. Aquatic ecosystems with low nutrients such as total phosphorus (TP) and high DOC from either allochthonous (external) or autochthonous (internal) sources tend to be net heterotrophic, while those exhibiting low DOC and high TP tend towards net autotrophy (Hanson et al. 2003; Waiser and Robarts 2004). Therefore, the supply of various C pools and other water quality indicators are important in understanding ecosystem function.|$|E

40|$|Australian dryland rivers are {{acknowledged}} as {{being among the}} most variable and unpredictable {{in the world in}} terms of their flow regimes. Although renowned for their spectacular floods over vast and complex floodplains, rivers exist for much of the time as discrete waterholes, which are important refugia for aquatic biota. Recent work has shown that waterholes are filled by surface flows and there is little evidence of groundwater contributions. The permanence of these refugia is largely determined by waterhole morphology and evaporative loss, and some waterholes can clearly persist for 2 years or more without surface flow connection. As a consequence, the spatial distribution of refugia for aquatic biota is determined not only by the physical template but also by the duration of dry spells and the timing of flow events. Flow variability also has a major influence on <b>aquatic</b> <b>production</b> in these systems and ultimately influences food availability for fish and other consumers. During dry spells, aquatic food webs in waterholes are largely supported by algal production in the shallow littoral zone. At the other extreme, during floods, the boom of <b>aquatic</b> <b>production</b> on floodplains provides an immense food resource. However, there are many occasions when in-channel flows (flow pulses) result in periods where neither of these sources of production is likely to be available. Although such flow pulses are essential for the physical persistence and connectivity of waterholes, we propose that they may lead to food limitation and stress for populations of fish and other consumers. Water resource development in dryland rivers often leads to an increase in the frequency and duration of flow pulses, due to reduced floods and elevated base flows. This increase in the bits in between natural boom or bust conditions may help to explain the observed decline in ecosystem health in dryland river systems with significant water resource development.
