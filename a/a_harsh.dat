5|$|Red wattlebirds utter {{two types}} of alarm calls, {{alternating}} between them while mobbing other animals. One is <b>a</b> <b>harsh</b> call over a wide frequency (1.3 to 5.9kHz) that is louder at lower frequencies. The other a lower-pitched staccato call with a frequency of 1.1–2.2kHz. They give <b>a</b> <b>harsh</b> call when trying to distract intruders from {{the vicinity of the}} nest or when picked up, often trying to flap or peck the handler.|$|E

5|$|After Philip's death, Demosthenes {{played a}} leading part in his city's {{uprising}} {{against the new}} king of Macedonia, Alexander the Great. However, his efforts failed and the revolt was met with <b>a</b> <b>harsh</b> Macedonian reaction. To prevent a similar revolt against his own rule, Alexander's successor in this region, Antipater, sent his men to track Demosthenes down. Demosthenes took his own life, {{in order to avoid}} being arrested by Archias of Thurii, Antipater's confidant.|$|E
5|$|Black-shouldered kites are {{generally}} silent, {{except in the}} breeding season when their calls, though weak, can be persistent. They primarily utter clear whistled 'chee, chee, chee' calls in flight and while hovering, or a hoarse wheezing 'skree-ah' when perched. The call has been confused {{with that of a}} silver gull. A short high whistle is the primary contact call between a pair, while <b>a</b> <b>harsh</b> scraping call is the most common call used by females and large young, and brooding females call to their young with a deep, soft, frog-like croak.|$|E

Kakashi's design gave Kishimoto difficulties as a result of having most of his face covered and as a result it was difficult to show his emotions. For the anime series, he is voiced by Kazuhiko Inoue in Japanese and Dave Wittenberg in the English dub.|$|E
