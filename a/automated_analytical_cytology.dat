40|$|HPLC in {{combination}} with <b>automated</b> <b>analytical</b> system and ESI/MS/MS was used to analyze aconitine (A), mesaconitine (MA), hypaconitine (HA), and their benzoyl analogs in the Chinese herbs Caowu and Chuanwu. First, an HPLC method was developed and validated to determine A, MA, and HA in raw and processed Caowu and Chuanwu. Then an <b>automated</b> <b>analytical</b> system and ESI/MS/MS were applied to analyze these alkaloids and their semihydrolyzed products. The results obtained from <b>automated</b> <b>analytical</b> system are identical to those from ESI/MS/MS, which indicated that the method is a convenient and rapid tool for the qualitative analysis of herbal preparations. Furthermore, HA was little hydrolyzed by heating processes and thus it might account more for the toxicity of processed aconites. Hence, HA {{could be used as}} an indicator when one alkaloid is required as a reference to monitor the quality of raw and processed Chuanwu and Caowu. In addition, the raw and processed Chuanwu and Caowu can be distinguished by monitoring the ratio of A and MA to HA...|$|R

50|$|By {{the early}} 1930s various firms {{manufactured}} ultraviolet fluorescent microscopes. The stage wasset for cytometry to now {{go beyond the}} now established hemocytometer. At this time, Torbjörn Caspersson,working at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, developed a series of progressively more sophisticatedinstruments called cytophotometers. These instruments combined a fluorescent microscope with a spectrophotometerto quantify cellular nucleic acids and their relation to cell growth and function. Caspersson’s earlyapparatus now seems hopelessly primitive. But, even this primitive apparatus got results, and attractedthe attention of other researchers. Many of the advances in <b>analytical</b> <b>cytology</b> from the 1940s and on-wardswere made by people who made the pilgrimage to Stockholm.|$|R

MEPS/GC-MS methodology is an excellent tool to quantify EC in wines, gathering efficiency and effectiveness, without using long and hard-working procedures.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of the Canadian Quality Assurance Program (CQAP) is to provide the most reproducible and accurate T-cell subset enumeration for individuals living with HIV who are enrolled in the Canadian Clinical Trial Network for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) Therapies (abbreviated as CTN). The Canadian National Laboratory for <b>Analytical</b> <b>Cytology,</b> within the Laboratory Centre for Disease Control, {{is part of the}} Health Protection Branch of Health Canada. For the past eight years, the Laboratory for <b>Analytical</b> <b>Cytology</b> has been responsible for delivering a bilingual quality assurance program for CD 4 T-cell enumeration. This federal program, which integrates biotechnology transfer with quality assessment, was achieved through the organization of workshops focused on technology transfer and essential skill-building techniques. Two training sessions were conducted for the CTN flow cytometer operators. The first introduced the concept of window of analysis, to demonstrate the practical benefits of unified quantitative fluorescent measurement. As a follow-up to the first workshop, participants performed a series of quantitative assays that monitored the expression of CD 69, an early activation marker. This quantitative fluorescence protocol was performed with acceptable inter-laboratory variation using modified commercial kits. The second workshop focused on a absolute count method based on a single platform. Four preserved whole-blood preparations were tested with this approach. The combined effort reduced inter-laboratory variation. The direct impact was monitored as related to the frequency of participation. Over the years, the standard deviation of average accumulated variation decreased dramatically with increased frequency of participation, from 10 % to < 4 %.

40|$|Since the {{discovery}} of the chromosomes and their behavior in mitosis and meiosis, cytologists and cytogeneticists have been largely preoccupied with the nucleus rather than the cytoplasm and have devoted much attention to the problems of reduplication of chromosomes, mutation, and the linear array and function of genes. On the other hand, investigators concerned with submicroscopic morphology worked mainly on the fine structure of cytoplasm and its organelles (1) and as yet relatively little progress has been achieved on the ultrastructural organization of the nucleus and chromosomes. There is a real need for the application of modern techniques of <b>analytical</b> <b>cytology</b> to the problems of chromosome structure in an effort to settle many points of disagreement in the cytological literature (2). Furthermore, the high resolution recently reached by means of the electron microscope on properly fixed and sectioned material offers the possibility of visualizing in situ the nucleoproteins and other macromolecular components which biochemists have been studying in vitro after isolation...|$|R

50|$|CD4 testing using {{flow cytometry}} {{techniques}} {{is a critical}} component of the AIDS treatment process in terms of identifying candidates to receive life-saving therapy, as well as on-going monitoring of disease progression.Unfortunately, in areas most impacted by HIV/AIDS, such as the African continent, CD4 testing procedures are often plagued by inconvenient time-lags, unavailability of instruments and high-costs.Former UN special envoy for HIV/AIDS in Africa, Stephen Lewis, has been a major proponent of the movement to make CD4 testing “portable” and “easy to use” so as to mitigate the AIDS epidemic in Africa.In May 2006, Lewis issued a challenge to experts in the field of cell analysis at the 2006 International Society for <b>Analytical</b> <b>Cytology</b> (ISAC) Congress, held in Quebec, to create a solution to flow cytometers that are “bulky, difficult to use, at about $50,000 each, vastly out of reach of most of the continent”.Medicine October 2006). In 2009 J. Paul Robinson summited Mt. Everest on May 23, in an effort to raise attention to the terrible situation many people are in regarding the cost of diagnostics for HIV related disease (http://www.cyto.purdue.edu/trackpaul/).|$|R
40|$|It {{has become}} evident that an {{autoimmune}} component {{could play a}} role in Alzheimer's disease (AD) onset and/or progression. The aim {{of this study was to}} identify neuronal antigenic targets specifically recognized by serum autoantibodies and to investigate their cellular effects and their possible pathogenetic role. We identified, by an immunoproteomic approach using mouse brain proteins, the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthase beta subunit as a new autoantigen in AD. Using an ELISA assay we found that serum anti-ATP synthase autoantibodies were present in 38 % of patients with AD, but in no age-matched healthy subjects or in patients with Parkinson's disease or atherosclerosis. <b>Analytical</b> <b>cytology</b> studies, using SH-SY 5 Y neuroblastoma cell line, showed that ATP synthase autoantibodies were capable of inducing the inhibition of ATP synthesis, alterations of mitochondrial homeostasis and cell death by apoptosis. These findings suggest that autoantibodies specific to ATP synthase can exert a pathogenetic role via a mechanism that brings into play the impairment of the extracellular ATP homeostasis and the alteration of mitochondrial function triggering cell death by apoptosis.
