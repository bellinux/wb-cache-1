40|$|We {{study the}} {{possibility}} of nullifying time-varying systems with mem-oryless output feedback. The systems we examine are discrete-time linear single-input single-output finite-dimensional time-varying systems. For generic completely controllable and completely observable discrete-time systems, we show that any state at any time can be steered to the origin within finite time. An algorithm <b>for</b> <b>nullification</b> and an upper bound <b>for</b> <b>nullification</b> time, depending only on the system’s dimension, are pro-vided. The algorithm is described using {{a representation of the}} system in time-varying controller canonical form. We verify that every completely controllable system has such a representation. 1 Introduction and main results s a sharp form of stabilisation, state nullification is appealing both from a math-ematical perspective and from the applications point of view.

25|$|President Andrew Jackson {{successfully}} {{forced the}} nullifiers {{to back down}} and allowed a gradual reduction of tariff rates. Calhoun and Senator Henry Clay agreed upon the Compromise Tariff of 1833, which would lower rates over 10 years.

50|$|The {{question}} of how important the tariff was in causing the war stems from the Nullification Crisis, which was South Carolina's attempt to nullify a tariff and lasted from 1828 to 1832. The tariff was low after 1846, and the tariff issue faded into the background by 1860 when secession began. States' rights was the justification <b>for</b> <b>nullification</b> and later secession. The most controversial right claimed by Southern states was the alleged right of Southerners to spread slavery into territories owned by the United States.|$|R

50|$|Many {{believe that}} {{were it not}} for the Force Act, South Carolina may have {{continued}} its Nullification policies because the Force Act gave the United States government the ability to use military force to enforce tariffs and other economic policies, which posed a clear threat to South Carolina. Though the exact impact of the Force Act on South Carolina's decision to accept the Tariff of 1833 cannot be measured, there is no doubt that it made fighting <b>for</b> <b>nullification</b> a potentially devastating choice. Ultimately, the House passed the Tariff of 1833 by a vote of 119-85 and the Senate passed it by a vote of 29-16.|$|R
50|$|One of the {{functions}} of churches from the Middle Ages was to register marriages, which was not obligatory. There was no state involvement in marriage and personal status, with these issues being adjudicated in ecclesiastical courts. During the Middle Ages marriages were arranged, sometimes as early as birth, and these early pledges to marry were often used to ensure treaties between different royal families, nobles, and heirs of fiefdoms. The church resisted these imposed unions, and {{increased the number of}} causes <b>for</b> <b>nullification</b> of these arrangements. As Christianity spread during the Roman period and the Middle Ages, the idea of free choice in selecting marriage partners increased and spread with it.|$|R

2500|$|Violence {{seemed a}} real {{possibility}} early in 1833 as Jacksonians in Congress introduced a [...] "Force Bill" [...] authorizing the President to use the Federal army and navy in order to enforce acts of Congress. No other state had come forward to support South Carolina, and the state itself was divided on willingness to continue the showdown with the Federal government. The crisis ended when Clay and Calhoun worked to devise a compromise tariff. Both sides later claimed victory. Calhoun and his supporters in South Carolina claimed a victory <b>for</b> <b>nullification,</b> insisting that it had forced the revision of the tariff. Jackson's followers, however, saw the episode as a demonstration that no single state could assert its rights by independent action.|$|R

500|$|Tyler's uneasy {{relationship}} with his party {{came to a head}} during the 22nd Congress, as the Nullification Crisis of 1832–33 began. South Carolina, threatening secession, passed the Ordinance of Nullification in November 1832, declaring the [...] "Tariff of Abominations" [...] null and void within its borders. This raised the constitutional question of whether states could nullify federal laws. President Jackson, who denied such a right, prepared to sign a Force Bill allowing the federal government to use military action to enforce the tariff. Tyler, who sympathized with South Carolina's reasons <b>for</b> <b>nullification,</b> rejected Jackson's use of military force against a state and gave a speech in February 1833 outlining his views. He supported Clay's Compromise Tariff, enacted that year, to gradually reduce the tariff over ten years, alleviating tensions between the states and the federal government.|$|R
25|$|The many {{different}} terms for vows and pledges used in Kol Nidrei can be confusing, especially because the English language is poor in short equivalent terms that express the same nuances.

All but two of the votes to delay were from the lower South and only three from this section voted against the motion. This did not signal any increased support <b>for</b> <b>nullification</b> but did signify doubts about enforcement. In order to draw more votes, proposals were made to limit the duration of the coercive powers and restrict the use of force to suppressing, rather than preventing, civil disorder. In the House the Judiciary Committee, in a 4-3 vote, rejected Jackson’s request to use force. By the time Calhoun made a major speech on February 15 strongly opposing it, the Force Bill was temporarily stalled.|$|R
