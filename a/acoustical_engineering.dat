40|$|Railway {{technology}} {{continues to}} provide {{challenges in the}} dynamical and <b>acoustical</b> analysis of <b>engineering</b> systems that typically involve understanding and controlling undesirable behaviour. This seminar will outline {{some of the new}} (and old!) research being undertaken in this area by the Rail Mechanics Group at The University of Queensland, Australia. In particular, results for prediction, measurement and control of rail corrugation, prediction and field investigation of railway noise and wheel squeal will be presented.   The paper will provide an overview of major results in these areas and then focus on the prediction of vibration amplitude and sound pressure level of wheel squeal noise. The predicted squeal sound level trend is shown to compare well with testrig results at various crabbing velocities (or angles of attack) and rolling speeds. The results concur with experimental and field observations but also provide important theoretical insight into the useful mechanisms of controlling railway dynamic and acoustic phenomena based on underlying mechanics modelling...|$|R
40|$|Accurate and {{unbiased}} radiative {{energy transfer}} models {{are critical to}} our understanding of ecosystem primary productivity, carbon cycling, and climate change. Much of the current research in this area is based on models parameterized for grasslands and broadleaf forests. However, many temperate montane and boreal forests are dominated by conifers, which present unique challenges to modellers. We propose two fundamentally different strategies by which plant canopies optimize solar radiation interception. Laminar canopies (e. g., grasslands, broadleaf trees) are. solar panels. that directly intercept incoming radiant energy. By contrast, conifer canopies are conical anechoic (. without echo.) surfaces that intercept radiant energy by scattering it through the canopy. The properties of anechoic surfaces are well known in <b>acoustical</b> and electrical <b>engineering,</b> but have not been applied in environmental biophysics. We discuss the physical principles of anechoic surfaces, and demonstrate how these principles apply to conifer trees and canopies. A key feature of anechoic interception is low radiance over all wavelengths, which is an emergent property of the system. Using empirical data from boreal forest stands in Riding Mountain National Park (Manitoba, Canada), we demonstrate that conifer canopies have very low near-infrared radiance compared to laminar broadleaf canopies. Vegetation index values for conifers are thereby reduced, resulting in underestimates of primary productivity and other biophysical parameters. We also discuss the adaptive significance of boreal conifer geometry, and consider factors driving selection of laminar versus anechoic canopy architectures...|$|R
2500|$|Beyond these [...] "Big Four", {{a number}} of other {{branches}} are recognized, though many {{can be thought of as}} sub-disciplines of the four major branches, or as cross-curricular disciplines among multiple.

[...] Other engineering fields sometimes included as major branches are manufacturing engineering, <b>acoustical</b> <b>engineering,</b> corrosion engineering, instrumentation and control, aerospace, automotive, computer, electronic, petroleum, environmental, systems, audio, software, architectural, agricultural, biosystems, biomedical, geological, textile, industrial, materials, and nuclear engineering.

2500|$|The {{limitations}} {{stemming from}} adapting an existing building as the Black Swan {{led to the}} design and building of a third theatre that provided flexible seating and increased capacity while maintaining the intimacy of the Black Swan. Opened in March 2002 and originally named the New Theatre, it was renamed the Thomas Theatre in 2013 {{as a result of}} a generous $4.5 million gift from a group of donors. The name is in recognition of long-time OSF development director Peter Thomas who died in March 2010. The Thomas Theatre expands the possibilities for experiment and innovation while maintaining the intimacy of the Black Swan, no seat being more than six rows from the stage. Richard L. Hay designed the theatre space. Architects Thomas Hacker and Associates of Portland designed the building. The contractor was Emerick Construction, and <b>acoustical</b> <b>engineering</b> was provided by Dohn and Associates. The seats can be arranged in three configurations. In arena mode, a stage of [...] is surrounded on all four sides by 360 seats. In three-quarter thrust mode, a [...] stage is surrounded on three sides by 270 seats, and in avenue mode, a [...] stage provides 228 seats on two sides. There is a trap room under the stage and a fly loft at one end. A computer controls 300 circuits and over 400 lights of various types. The remainder of the building is given over to downstairs and upstairs lobbies, concessions, access distribution, archives (see below), storage, laundry, green room, quiet green room, quiet room, warm-up room, dressing space for 18 actors, showers/restrooms, costume and wig rooms, stage manager's office, maintenance space, storage for props and set pieces, and trap.|$|E
