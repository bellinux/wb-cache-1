40|$|AbstractThe {{study on}} the {{avifauna}} of the Seonheul Gotjawal region of Jeju-do (Is.), a survey site of long-term ecological study, was conducted between February of 2011 and January of 2012. A total of 54 species and 1, 039 individuals of birds were observed, with 30 species and 164 individuals observed during spring, 31 species and 174 individuals during summer, 30 species and 206 individuals during fall and 28 species and 868 individuals during winter. In terms of dominant species, Mandarin Duck (Aix galericulata) was the most dominant at 500 individuals (48. 12 %), followed by Rook (Corvus frugilegus) at 250 individuals (24. 06 %), Black-billed Magpie (Pica pica) at 36 individuals (3. 46 %), Barn Swallow (Hirundo rustica) at 34 individuals (3. 27 %) and Great Tit (Parus major) and Japanese White-eye (Zosterops japonicus) at 26 individuals (2. 50 %) each. The overall species diversity was 1. 95, with the value 2. 69 during spring, 2. 87 during summer, 2. 81 during fall and 1. 29 during winter. The species diversity was low during the winter, because Mandarin Duck (Aix galericulata) and Rook (Corvus frugilegus) were observed at a relative high level {{when compared to other}} species, at 500 individuals and 250 individuals respectively. Government protected species included 8 natural monument species, such as Mandarin Duck (Aix galericulata), Common Kestrel (Falco tinnunculus), Peregrine Falcon (Falco peregrinus), Cinereous Vulture (<b>Aegypius</b> <b>monachus),</b> Eurasian Sparrowhawk (Accipiter nisus), Northern Goshawk (Accipiter gentilis), Lesser Cuckoo (Cuculus poliocephalus) and Fairy Pitta (Pitta nympha), and 8 endangered species of Japanese Night Heron (Gorsachius goisagi), Peregrine Falcon (Falco peregrinus), Cinereous Vulture (<b>Aegypius</b> <b>monachus),</b> Crested Honey Buzzard (Pernis ptilorhychus), Northern Goshawk (Accipiter gentilis), Eurasian Sparrowhawk (Accipiter nisus), Fairy Pitta (Pitta nympha) and Black Paraside Flycatcher (Terpsiphone atrocaudata).

40|$|The {{diversity}} patterns, {{the ecological}} {{structure and the}} typical species of the orthopteran assemblage in the Dadia reserve are investigated. The reserve was {{designed to protect the}} black vulture (<b>Aegypius</b> <b>monachus)</b> and other raptors. A total of 39 orthopteran species were found, including Paranocarodes chopardi, a pamphagid species with very restricted distribution. All species can be represented in a network of six complementary habitats, including open oak woodlands, agricultural fields separated with hedges, humid grasslands, as well as serpentine grasslands. The buffer zone of the reserve is far more important for Orthoptera conservation than the core areas, which host most of the black vulture nests. Management focusing on raptors is in general compatible with conservation of Orthoptera. We suggest the maintenance of forest openings in the buffer zone, the maintenance of forest heterogeneity, the enhancement of periodical livestock grazing, and the use of nine indicator species and Paranocarodes chopardi in the reserve monitoring program.

40|$|Cinereous {{vultures}} (<b>Aegypius</b> <b>monachus)</b> are {{the largest}} raptors in Eurasia. Little {{is known about the}} species, especially in Mongolia. We studied the nesting ecology of cinereous vultures in Ikh Nartyn Chuluu Nature Reserve, Dornogobi Aimag. To assess reproductive success, we located active nests and periodically checked to determine if they remained active. We measured nest sizes and, periodically, nestling sizes and weights. We located 42 active cinereous vulture nests (27 on rocks and 15 on trees) in 2003 and 19 nests (14 on rocks and 5 on trees) in 2004. Mean volume of active nests was 3. 92 ± 0. 39 m 3 (n = 36). Most nests failed prior to egg hatching, but after hatching nesting success rates increased dramatically. Following hatching, cinereous vulture chicks grew linearly until leveling off just prior to fledging. We generated growth curves for chicks that allowed us to determine the average size of chicks on specific dates. Improving the prospects for successful cinereous vulture conservation likely requires a better understanding of nesting ecology. As such, we plan {{to improve the quality of}} our data by monitoring nests more intensively to determine incubation and fledging lengths, as well as causes of nest failures...|$|R
40|$|Antibiotic {{residues}} {{that may}} be present in carcasses of medicated livestock could pass to and greatly reduce scavenger wildlife populations. We surveyed residues of the quinolones enrofloxacin and its metabolite ciprofloxacin and other antibiotics (amoxicillin and oxytetracycline) in nestling griffon Gyps fulvus, cinereous <b>Aegypius</b> <b>monachus</b> and Egyptian Neophron percnopterus vultures in central Spain. We found high concentrations of antibiotics in the plasma of many nestling cinereous (57 %) and Egyptian (40 %) vultures. Enrofloxacin and ciprofloxacin were also found in liver samples of all dead cinereous vultures. This is the first report of antibiotic residues in wildlife. We also provide evidence of a direct association between antibiotic residues, primarily quinolones, and severe disease due to bacterial and fungal pathogens. Our results indicate that, by damaging the liver and kidney and through the acquisition and proliferation of pathogens associated with the depletion of lymphoid organs, continuous exposure to antibiotics could increase mortality rates, at least in cinereous vultures. If antibiotics ingested with livestock carrion are clearly implicated in {{the decline of the}} vultures in central Spain then it should be considered a primary concern for conservation of their populations...|$|R
30|$|ALP is {{associated}} with measurements of skeletal growth {{and can be used}} as an indicator of age, with levels decreasing as the animal reaches adulthood (Calabuig et al. 2010). Tree-rat ALP was higher in older animals than younger animals and was not consistent with previous murid values (Bradley et al. 1988; Kemper et al. 1987; Monamy 1995; Old et al. 2005, 2007; Thrall et al. 2012). Stick-nest rat ALP values were low in young individuals, peaked around 2.5  years, and dropped again when animals reached 4  years. In quolls (Stannard et al. 2013) and other murid species (Old et al. 2005) ALP levels varied greatly between individuals. High ALP has been seen as an effect of captivity in the black vulture (<b>Aegypius</b> <b>monachus),</b> as well as poor health (Villegas et al. 2002). Whilst higher ALP values have also been reported in healthy captive southern hairy-nosed wombats (Lasiorhinus latifrons) compared to wild wombats (Gaughwin and Judson 1980). A larger number of samples with a wider range of ages are needed to determine the reasoning behind the variability in the results and whether captive management is affecting the ALP values of these species.|$|R
40|$|Given {{the still}} scanty {{amount of data}} ascribable to the {{interaction}} between raptors and hominins, this contribution aims to fuel {{the debate on the}} complexity of Neanderthal behavior during MIS 3 in Western Eurasia. Nowadays, large raptors in general are scarce in nature, due to being top consumers in the trophic chain, and attracted hominins possibly as advantageous indicators of scavenging and feeding opportunities. Nevertheless, a symbolic rather than alimentary significance was designed from several taphonomic investigations, demonstrating various deliberate actions for removing wings, feathers and talons from raptors of different sizes. Following the results of taphonomic examinations of four raptors' (cf. <b>Aegypius</b> <b>monachus,</b> cf. Gypaetus barbatus, Clanga clanga and Falco columbarius) bones recovered from layer A 9 at Fumane Cave, Italy, the data produced are here compared and supported by experimental butchering and contextualized within a wider context that ranges into the Early Upper Palaeolithic. Comparable to previous examples from Fumane and from other sites, the traces impressed {{on the surface of the}} wing bones suggest the recovery of the feathers or the wing tip adorned of the primary feathers, but also more complex and insisted interventions aimed to prepare the bone for a possible functional use...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} the nest-site {{selection}} patterns of four tree-nesting sympatric raptor species in Dadia National Park (Greece) were compared {{in order to}} provide a sound conservation tool for their long-term management in the area. The species studied were the Black vulture (<b>Aegypius</b> <b>monachus),</b> the Lesser-spotted eagle (Aquila pomarina), the Booted eagle (Hieraaetus pennatus) and the Goshawk (Accipiter gentilis). Twenty-six variables illustrating the landscape context and vegetation structure of nesting sites were analysed. Multivariate-ANOVA and Discriminant Function Analysis were used to test for significant differentiations in nest-site characteristics among the species. The species studied were initially differentiated by geomorphology and distance to foraging areas. Once these were determined their nesting areas were established according to forest structure. Our results indicate that forest management should integrate the preservation of mature forest stands with sparse canopy and forest heterogeneity in order to conserve suitable nesting habitats for the raptors. Specific conservation measures such as restriction of road construction should be implemented {{in order to protect the}} active nests and provisions should be made for adequate nesting sites for the Black vulture, which is sensitive to human disturbance...|$|R
30|$|During {{the last}} two decades populations of three {{resident}} species of Gyps vulture have declined dramatically and are now threatened with extinction in South Asia. Sex identification of vultures is of key importance for the purpose of conservation breeding as it is desirable to have an equal sex ratio in these monogamous species which are housed together in large colony aviaries. Because vultures are monomorphic, with no differences in external morphology or plumage colour between the sexes, other methods are required for sex identification. Molecular methods for sex identification in birds rely on allelic length or nucleotide sequence discrimination of the chromohelicase-DNA binding (CHD) gene located on male and female chromosomes ZZ and ZW, respectively. We characterized the partial sequences of CHD alleles from Gyps indicus, Gyps bengalensis, Gyps himalayensis and <b>Aegypius</b> <b>monachus</b> and analysed the applicability of five molecular methods of sex identification of 46 individual vultures including 26 known-sex G. bengalensis and G. indicus. The results revealed that W-specific PCR in combination with ZW-common PCR is a quick, accurate and simple method, and is ideal for sex identification of vultures. The method is also suitable to augment ecological studies for identifying sex of these endangered birds during necropsy examinations especially when gonads are not apparent, possibly due to regression during non-breeding seasons.|$|R
40|$|Veterinary {{pharmaceuticals}} {{contained in}} dead livestock may be ingested by avian scavengers and negatively affect {{their health and}} consequently their population dynamics and conservation. We evaluated the potential role of antibiotics as immunodepressors using multiple parameters measuring {{the condition of the}} cellular and humoral immune system in griffon (Gyps fulvus), cinereous (<b>Aegypius</b> <b>monachus)</b> and Egyptian vultures (Neophron percnopterus). We confirmed the presence of circulating antimicrobial residues, especially quinolones, in nestlings of the three vulture species breeding in central Spain. Individuals ingesting antibiotics showed clearly depressed cellular and humoral immune systems compared with nestlings from the control areas, which did not ingest antibiotics. Within central Spain, we found that individuals with circulating antibiotics showed depressed cellular (especially CD 4 +and CD 8 +T-lymphocyte subsets) and humoral (especially acellular APV complement and IL 8 -like) immune systems compared with nestlings without circulating antibiotics. This suggests that ingestion of antibiotics together with food may depress the immune system of developing nestlings, temporarily reducing their resistance to opportunistic pathogens, which require experimental confirmation. Medicated livestock carrion should be considered inadequate food for vultures due to their detrimental consequences on health derived from the ingestion and potential effects of the veterinary drugs contained in them and for this reason rejected as a management tool in conservation programmes...|$|R

However, {{there was no significant}} difference in seasonal and annual survival rate between male and female or singletons and twins.

40|$|The Eurasian {{black vulture}} (<b>Aegypius</b> <b>monachus)</b> has {{experienced}} a severe decline {{during the last two}} centuries and is globally classified as near-threatened. This has led to the extinction of many traditional breeding areas in Europe and resulted in the present patchy distribution (Iberian and Balkan peninsulas) in the Western Palearctic. In the present study, we describe the current genetic status of the European populations using both mitochondrial cytochrome b sequences and nuclear microsatellite markers, comparing with those found in Asia (Mongolia and Caucasus region). Although, mitochondrial (mt) DNA revealed a relatively low genetic variability (haplotype diversity), no evidence of genome-wide genetic erosion exists because nuclear diversity exhibits normal levels and strong differentiation. A highly philopatric dispersal behaviour must be invoked to explain the existence of a clear pattern that revealed by the phylogeographic analysis, which indicates a sharp East–West clinal distribution and an allopatric differentiation. The distribution of mtDNA haplotypes one in the Iberian population and two in Balkan population and the significance divergence at nuclear loci fulfill the definitions of those populations as evolutionary significant units. We discuss how management strategies should aim at the maintenance (or increase) of current genetic variability levels, suggesting that independent conservation plans are urgently required to protect these two breeding European populations from extinction...|$|R
