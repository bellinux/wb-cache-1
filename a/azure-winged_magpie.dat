[Brain Behav Evol 1996; 47 : 156 - 164] examined North American food-storing birds in the corvid family and found that Clark’s nutcrackers had a larger relative Hp than pinyon jays and Western scrub jays. These results correlated with the nutcracker’s better performance on most spatial memory tasks and their strong reliance on stored food in the wild. However, Pravosudov and de Kort [Brain Behav Evol 67 (2006), 1 - 9] raised questions about the methodology used in the 1996 study, specifically the use of paraffin as an embedding material and recalculation for shrinkage. Therefore, we measured relative Hp volume using gelatin as the embedding material in four North American species of food-storing corvids (Clark’s nutcrackers, pinyon jays, Western scrub jays and blue jays) and one Eurasian corvid that stores little to no food (<b>azure-winged</b> <b>magpies).</b> Although there was a significant overall effect of species on relative Hp volume among the five species, subsequent tests found only one pairwise difference, blue jays having a larger Hp than the <b>azure-winged</b> <b>magpies.</b> We also examined the relative size of the septum in the five species. Although Shiflett et al.

40|$|During operant {{transitive}} inference experiments, {{subjects are}} trained on adjacent stimulus pairs in an implicit linear hierarchy in which responses to higher ranked stimuli are rewarded. Two contrasting forms of cognitive representation {{are often used}} to explain resulting choice behavior. Associative representation is based on memory for the reward history of each stimulus.

Natural history characteristics that require accurate configural memory, such as social complexity or reliance on cached food, should tend to promote greater use of relational representation.

A simplified computer model of associative representation displayed a characteristic pattern of accuracy as a function of position in the hierarchy.

50|$|The {{benefits}} of cooperative breeding in birds have been well-documented. One {{example is the}} <b>azure-winged</b> <b>magpie</b> (Cyanopica cyanus), in which studies found that the offspring’s cell-mediated immune response {{was positively correlated with}} {{increase in the number of}} helpers at the nest. Studies on cooperative breeding in birds have also shown that high levels of cooperative breeding are strongly associated with low annual adult mortality and small clutch sizes, though it remains unclear whether cooperative breeding is a cause or consequence. It was originally suggested that cooperative breeding developed among bird species with low mortality rates as a consequence of “overcrowding” and thus fewer opportunities to claim territory and breed. However, many observers today believe cooperative breeding arose because of the need for helpers to rear young in the extremely infertile and unpredictable environments of Australia and sub-Saharan Africa under the rare favourable conditions.|$|E
50|$|The family Corvidae was {{introduced}} by the English zoologist William Elford Leach in {{a guide to the}} contents of the British Museum published in 1820. Over the years, much disagreement has arisen on the exact evolutionary relationships of the corvid family and their relatives. What eventually seemed clear was that corvids are derived from Australasian ancestors and from there spread throughout the world. Other lineages derived from these ancestors evolved into ecologically diverse, but often Australasian groups. In the late 1970s and throughout the 1980s, Sibley and Ahlquist united the corvids with other taxa in the Corvida, based on DNA-DNA hybridization. The presumed corvid relatives included currawongs, birds of paradise, whipbirds, quail-thrushes, whistlers, monarch flycatchers and drongos, shrikes, vireos, and vangas, but current research favors the theory that this grouping is partly artificial. The corvids constitute the core group of the Corvoidea, together with their closest relatives (the birds of paradise, Australian mud-nesters, and shrikes). They are also the core group of the Corvida, which includes the related groups, such as Old World orioles and vireos.Clarification of the interrelationships of the corvids has been achieved based on cladistic analysis of several DNA sequences.

40|$|International audienceIn this study, we {{investigated}} patterns of natural covariation between testosterone and reproductive status in a cooperatively breeding bird species, the azurewinged magpie (Cyanopica cyanus). To assess {{the relationship between}} testosterone and breeding behavior, we also manipulated testosterone (T) levels {{early in the season}} (before breeding started) using testosterone-filled or empty implants. Our results do not support the hypothesis that circulating testosterone levels affect the occurrence of helping behavior in the <b>azure-winged</b> <b>magpie.</b> Helping males had similar T levels to breeding males. Furthermore, experimentally augmented plasma T did not affect the likelihood of becoming either a helper or a breeder. Overall, these results are consistent with previous findings in other bird species and only give some support to the behavioral suppression hypothesis, suggesting that helping in the <b>azure-winged</b> <b>magpie</b> is a flexible behavioral option moderated in the short-term by social and ecological factors. Experimentally elevated testosterone levels, however, reduced the reproductive success of male breeders because of markedly lower levels of paternal care, had similar effects on their mates, but had the contrary effect on helpers, which raised levels of parental effort.

40|$|Although the {{presence}} of feathers in the nest is widespread among birds, {{it has not been}} previously suggested that feathers can be used as sexual signals. Females of the spotless starling (Sturnus unicolor) regularly carry feathers to their nest, mostly during laying and incubation. We show that the arrangement of these feathers was non-random with respect to the side (obverse or reverse) placed upwards (which can be viewed from the nest entrance). Feathers of the wood pigeon (Columba palumbus) and the spotless starling, which exhibit higher ultraviolet and visible reflectance on their reverse side, were predominantly placed with this side upwards. On the contrary, feathers of the jay (Garrulus glandarius) were predominantly found exhibiting the obverse side, which possesses higher reflectance in this species. Feathers of the <b>azure-winged</b> <b>magpie</b> (Cyanopica cyana), with similar reflectance values on either side, were placed indiscriminately in obverse and reverse positions.

40|$|The <b>azure-winged</b> <b>magpie</b> (AWM), Cyanopica cyanus, {{is found}} in Asia and Iberia. This {{remarkable}} disjunct distribution has been variously explained by either the sixteenth-century introduction of birds into Iberia from the Far East, or {{by the loss of}} individuals from the central part of their range as a result of Pleistocene glaciations. We have used the mitochondrial control region to undertake a molecular phylogenetic analysis of the AWM, with sequences examined from individuals collected from across the current distribution range and incorporating representatives of all currently defined subspecies. The Western birds are genetically distinct from their Asian congeners and their divergence is basal in the phylogenetic tree. This indicates that the AWM is native to Iberia and not the result of a recent introduction from Asia. In Asia, two major mitochondrial DNA lineages were identified. These correspond to an Inland Asia group and a Pacific Seaboard group, and are separated topographically by the Da Hingan Ling mountains and the Yellow Sea. Molecular clock estimates suggest that these divergences are associated with Pleistocene glaciations.

40|$|In cooperatively {{breeding}} species, helpers {{may contribute}} {{to the success of the}} brood by increasing the number of independent offspring, but also, they may affect offspring condition and, hence, their survival and recruitment into the breeding population. This second type of benefits is rarely included in theoretical models or assessed in field studies. Immune response is a good proxy of individual quality and fitness, and there is good evidence that the performance of the immune system of chicks during the nestling phase is related to their chances of survival and future reproduction. However, no study has so far explored whether helpers at the nest might contribute to enhance immune functioning of nestlings in species with a cooperative breeding system. Here we investigate this issue in the <b>azure-winged</b> <b>magpie</b> (Cyanopica cyanus) and found for the first time a positive correlation between the number of helpers at nest and the cell-mediated immune response of nestlings.

40|$|Like all corvids, the <b>Azure-winged</b> <b>Magpie</b> Cyanopica cyanus is sexually {{monomorphic}} in plumage, {{making it}} difficult to distinguish between males and females in the field. We examined sexual size dimorphism in a population of Iberian Azure-winged Magpies C. c. cooki and used a discriminant function analysis based on five morphological characters to determine the sex of first-year and adult individuals. Females were significantly smaller than males for all tested variables within each age class except for keel length of first-year individuals. In both sexes, wing length of adults was greater than that of yearlings, but only males showed significant differences in tail length between age classes (longer in first-year birds). Stepwise discriminant analysis indicated that tail length and head plus bill length were the most accurate variables in a discriminant function model, predicting the sex of yearlings with about 90 % accuracy. Adding wing length to the model yielded the same level of accuracy for adults. We propose a simple system to sex Iberian Azure-winged Magpies, using only two or three variables easily measured in the field, which provides classification {{with a high level of}} accuracy.

40|$|The {{function}} of colored ornaments is usually {{related to the}} signaling of individual quality in intra- and intersexual interactions. In cooperative breeding species, where {{only a fraction of}} the male population access the breeding status and the other fraction has the option to help breeding pairs, colored traits might provide the females with a reliable information on the quality of potential mate. Males of the cooperative breeding azure-winged magpies (Cyanopica cyanus) display conspicuous blue plumage coloration. Here we explored the role played by structural blue coloration of males and the probability of becoming a breeder or a helper. Birds were trapped during 4 consecutive years, and feather coloration was measured with a spectrometer. Males that became breeders had a more brilliant and saturated blue coloration and showed a more violet hue in the nonbreeding period compared with birds that became helpers. Breeding males also showed a seasonal decline in blueness, whereas the color properties of helpers were constant throughout the year. Blueness of individuals trapped in the nonbreeding period was positively correlated with body size and condition. These findings are consistent with a scenario in which nonbreeding blue plumage coloration may function as a signal of individual quality in the <b>azure-winged</b> <b>magpie</b> at the pair formation time and add to growing evidence suggesting that the nonbreeding season appears particularly important in impacting breeding roles in cooperative breeding birds.

It covers fungi, lichens, plants, several insect groups, spiders, crustaceans, and all vertebrate classes. For all taxa adequate experts proved the species lists. Because of both the high species richness in most taxa and the new threat by logging and frequent anthropogenic fires the area around Khonin Nuga has to be denoted a “hotspot of biodiversity” for Mongolia. The long-term ecological research led {{to an understanding of the}} dynamics of the different forest types: the old-growth forest with dominating Pinus sibirica shows a gap-dynamics in regeneration, whereas the Larix sibirica – Betula platyphylla forests are driven by frequent fire disturbances. The anthropogenic fires are destructive for the biodiversity in forests. The tree species Betula platyphylla proved as a key resource for many saproxylic organisms and hole-breeding birds. The southfacing slopes are covered naturally by dry-mountain-steppes where trees are beyond their limits. In the river valleys meadows can form stable communities even though the floodplains allow tree growth physiologically. At the community level we studied for more than 10 years the dynamics of small mammal populations. At the southern edge of the taiga there is no pattern of cycles. The dynamics (fluctuation with population crash) is mainly caused by adverse winter conditions, but the dynamics can also shift to intrinsic factors at high population densities and favorable winter weather. At the species level we studied the reproduction strategy of a social corvid, the <b>Azure-winged</b> <b>magpie</b> (Cyanopica cyana). In years with favorable conditions it breeds without helpers. In years with high nest predation we observed 10 % helpers, but in a year with a colony disaster by burning 64 % helpers improved significantly the breeding success. The southern boreal forest is an area of special interest for conservation, containing the most diverse assemblages of species within the boreal forest. Intact, contiguous boreal forest will be best able to keep up with rapidly changing climate conditions because of high connectivity, providing diverse habitats for wildlife by its heterogeneity, high potential for regeneration, maintaining the soil system, and moderating local climate. Contributions to the long-term studies came from Dulamsuren Ch., Oyunsanaa B., Gottschalk E., Sheftel B., Gantulga B. and others found in the references...|$|E
