If new investment is included, the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>aid</b> rose to $3.3 billion per year during this timespan while the total <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>aid</b> was roughly $22.3 billion. However, the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>aid</b> did not equal the net transfer of resources and development as Latin American countries still had to pay off their debt to the US and other first world countries. Additionally, profits from the investments usually returned to the US, with profits frequently exceeding new investment.|$|R

50|$|The {{concept of}} an International Finance Facility (IFF) first was {{proposed}} by HM Treasury {{in conjunction with the}} Department for International Development of the United Kingdom. An IFF is designed to frontload aid to help meet the Millennium Development Goals. Bonds are issued on global capital markets, against the security of government guarantees to maintain future aid flows, which would be used to buy back the bonds over a longer period. This allows a large <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>aid</b> to flow soon, at the expense <b>of</b> less <b>aid</b> in the future. Critics have raised concerns that the poorest countries in particular don't have the ability to efficiently spend such large <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>aid</b> (whilst avoiding corruption), and that their economies {{may not be able to}} cope with such rapid change either.|$|R
