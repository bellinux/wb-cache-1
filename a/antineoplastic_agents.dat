25|$|Healthcare workers {{exposed to}} <b>antineoplastic</b> <b>agents</b> take {{precautions}} {{to keep their}} exposure to a minimum. There is a limitation in cytotoxics dissolution in Australia and the United States to 20 dissolutions per pharmacist/nurse, since pharmacists who prepare these drugs or nurses who may prepare or administer them are the two occupational groups with the highest potential exposure to <b>antineoplastic</b> <b>agents.</b> In addition, physicians and operating room personnel may also be exposed through the treatment of patients. Hospital staff, such as shipping and receiving personnel, custodial workers, laundry workers, and waste handlers, all have potential exposure to these drugs {{during the course of}} their work. The increased use of <b>antineoplastic</b> <b>agents</b> in veterinary oncology also puts these workers at risk for exposure to these drugs. Routes of entry into the worker's body are skin absorption, inhalation, and ingestion via hand-to-mouth. The long-term effects of exposure include chromosomal abnormalities and infertility.|$|E

25|$|Certain {{drugs are}} toxic {{in their own}} right in {{therapeutic}} doses because of their mechanism of action. Alkylating <b>antineoplastic</b> <b>agents,</b> for example, cause DNA damage, which is more harmful to cancer cells than regular cells. However, alkylation causes severe side-effects and is actually carcinogenic in its own right, with potential to lead to the development of secondary tumors. In similar manner, arsenic-based medications like melarsoprol for trypanosomiasis can cause arsenic poisoning.|$|E
2500|$|Since the ERK {{signaling}} pathway is involved in both physiological and pathological cell proliferation, it is natural that ERK1/2 inhibitors would represent a desirable class of <b>antineoplastic</b> <b>agents.</b> Indeed, many of the proto-oncogenic [...] "driver" [...] mutations are tied to ERK1/2 signaling, such as constitutively active (mutant) receptor tyrosine kinases, Ras or Raf proteins.
