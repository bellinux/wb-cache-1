The extraction and recovery of polluting and precious metals from waste fluids has recently gained increasing importance. It should be noted that, besides to its main use in jewellery and investment, applications of gold <b>are</b> <b>rapily</b> and widely expanding so that the gold recovery from waste fluids or waste scraps is becoming important. On the other hand, the risk potential of copper in the environment gains in significance due to application and special properties of copper with respect to toxicity and complexing ability with humic substances. 4 Studies on metal extraction suggest that surfactant based metodologies could be effective in the removal of these ions from waste fluids...|$|E
