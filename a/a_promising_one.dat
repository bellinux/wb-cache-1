500|$|... "The Man Who Never Lied" [...] is a pop {{song with}} {{a length of}} three minutes and 25 seconds. It is written in the key of D major, in common time, with a tempo of 116 beats per minute. Levine's vocal range spans from the low note of A4 to the high note of B5. Lyrically, the song finds the protagonist in a {{relationship}} trouble where he is playing a role of a good person: [...] "I {{was the man who}} never lied... but I couldn't break your heart like you did yesterday." [...] According to Nate Chinen of The New York Times, in [...] "The Man Who Never Lied", Levine sings [...] "about spoiling his perfect record of honesty to spare a quarreling lover some hurtful feelings." [...] Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone concluded that in the song, the singer confesses that the honesty is the worst policy. According to the reviewer, that's a [...] "dubious motto for real life – but it's always <b>a</b> <b>promising</b> <b>one</b> for a pop sharpie." ...|$|E

Far from being daunted, she was visibly encouraged by the ungraciousness of his manner. Her experience of him informed her that the sign was <b>a</b> <b>promising</b> <b>one.</b> On those rare occasions when the little resolution that he possessed was roused in him, it invariably asserted itself--like the resolution of most other weak men--aggressively. At such times, in proportion as he was outwardly sullen and discourteous to those about him, his resolution rose; and in proportion as he was considerate and polite, it fell. The tone of the answer he had just given, and the attitude he assumed at the table, convinced Mrs. Lecount that Spanish wine and Scotch mutton had done their duty, and had rallied his sinking courage.|$|E

50|$|The Hundred Years' War {{could be}} {{considered}} a lengthy war of succession between the houses of Valois and Plantagenet. The early reign of Philip VI was <b>a</b> <b>promising</b> <b>one</b> for France. The new king fought the Flemings on behalf of his vassal, the count of Flanders, and restored that count to power. Edward III's aggression against Scotland, a French ally, prompted Philip VI to confiscate Guyenne. In the past the English kings would have to submit to the King of France. But Edward, having descended from the French kings, claimed the throne for himself. France was then at the height of its power. No one believed that the English king could make good his claim to France.|$|E
