According to Mahatma Gandhi, Mahāvīra was the greatest authority on Ahimsa.|$|E

5|$|In summer 1615, however, {{it emerged}} that Overbury had been poisoned. He had died on 15 September 1613 in the Tower of London, {{where he had}} been placed at the King's request.

5|$|A major {{development}} of this period {{that would have a}} profound impact on Kannada literature even into the modern age was the birth of the Haridasa ("servants of Hari or Vishnu") movement. This devotional movement, although reminiscent in some ways of the Veerashaiva movement of the 12thcentury (which produced Vachana poetry and taught devotion to the god Shiva), was in contrast intimately devoted to the Hindu god Vishnu <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>supreme</b> God. The inspiration behind this movement was the philosophy of Madhvacharya of Udupi. Naraharitirtha (1281) is considered the first well-known haridasa and composer of Vaishnava devotional songs in Kannada. Before his induction into the Madhva order, he had served as a minister in the court of Kalinga (modern Orissa). The Vaishnava poetry however disappeared for about two centuries after Naraharitirtha's death before resurfacing as a popular form of folk literature during the rule of the Vijayanagara Empire. Only three of Naraharitirtha's compositions are available today.|$|E
