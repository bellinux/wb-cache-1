5|$|Pending the Disney {{acquisition}} of Pixar, {{the two companies}} created <b>a</b> <b>distribution</b> deal for the intended 2007 release of Ratatouille, if the acquisition fell through, {{to ensure that this}} one film would still be released through Disney's distribution channels. In contrast to the earlier Pixar deal, Ratatouille was to remain a Pixar property and Disney would have received only <b>a</b> <b>distribution</b> fee. The completion of Disney's Pixar acquisition, however, nullified this distribution arrangement.|$|E
5|$|Although the ZX Microdrive was {{initially}} greeted with good reviews, it never took off as <b>a</b> <b>distribution</b> method due to {{worries about the}} quality of the cartridges and piracy. Hence the main use became to complement tape releases, usually utilities and niche products like the Tasword word processing software and Trans Express, (a tape to microdrive copying utility). No games are known to be exclusively released on Microdrive.|$|E
5|$|Ballistics was {{the first}} game {{developed}} at Grin. Careful planning and production methods enabled a very quick completion time of 6 months; the game was finished before even acquiring <b>a</b> <b>distribution</b> partner. Grin used TQM methods to ensure a high standard of work, and JIT techniques to ensure the timing of different production phases came together.|$|E

50|$|In {{probability}} theory, <b>a</b> log-Cauchy <b>distribution</b> is <b>a</b> probability <b>distribution</b> of <b>a</b> {{random variable}} whose logarithm is distributed {{in accordance with}} <b>a</b> Cauchy <b>distribution.</b> If X is a random variable with <b>a</b> Cauchy <b>distribution,</b> then Y = exp(X) has a log-Cauchy distribution; likewise, if Y has <b>a</b> log-Cauchy <b>distribution,</b> then X = log(Y) has <b>a</b> Cauchy <b>distribution.</b>|$|R
50|$|In mathematics, <b>a</b> super-Poissonian <b>distribution</b> is <b>a</b> {{probability}} <b>distribution</b> {{that has}} <b>a</b> larger variance than <b>a</b> Poisson <b>distribution</b> {{with the same}} mean.

He was able to show it to Avnet, who was so {{impressed}} that he spent two years working with him on his screenplay. No major studio was interested in Sky Captain, but Avnet convinced Aurelio De Laurentiis to finance Sky Captain without <b>a</b> <b>distribution</b> deal.|$|E
5|$|Debian 0.01, {{released}} on September 15, 1993, {{was the first}} of several internal releases. Version 0.90 was the first public release, providing support through mailing lists hosted at Pixar. The release included the Debian Linux Manifesto, outlining Murdock's view for the new operating system. In it he called for the creation of <b>a</b> <b>distribution</b> to be maintained openly, in the spirit of Linux and GNU.|$|E

Zoot Suit Riot was licensed and reissued by Mojo and given national distribution in July 1997, less than four months after its original release.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} common methods for {{estimating}} the parameters of <b>a</b> <b>distribution</b> from data, the method of maximum likelihood (MLE), can break down in various cases, such as involving certain mixtures of continuous distributions.

5|$|These SWNT forests (buckypaper) {{were grown}} by the super-growth CVD method to about 10 μm height. Two factors could {{contribute}} to strong light absorption by these structures: (i) <b>a</b> <b>distribution</b> of CNT chiralities resulted in various bandgaps for individual CNTs. Thus a compound material was formed with broadband absorption. (ii) Light might be trapped in those forests due to multiple reflections.|$|E

5|$|After finalizing their lineup, Something Corporate began {{performing}} at local venues, eventually gaining support slots for {{groups such as}} Better Than Ezra and Sugar Ray. Shortly afterwards, the band signed to independent label Drive-Thru Records.
