40|$|The {{strategy}} of silence for voice, {{as seen in}} the Day of Silence, deploys silence in order {{to draw attention to the}} ways in which an individual or group has been silenced and to establish possibilities for voice. The Day of Silence is a nation-wide day of action aimed at addressing anti-LGBTQ bias and harassment in schools. This ethnographic study of a high school gay-straight alliance (GSA) club examines the unintended consequences of silence as an <b>awareness-raising</b> strategy during <b>events</b> related to the Day of Silence and how students and teachers handle these consequences. Silence makes students more defenseless in the face of verbal harassment, makes it more difficult to engage in discussion with others of opposing views, and makes it more challenging for teachers to lead their classes and for students to learn. What remains unheard at MacArthur High are the institutional silences LGBTQ students experience when they find themselves not represented in the curricula and they find critical discussion of heterosexism and hegemonic masculinity absent from classroom and school discourse. While the Day of Silence calls for students to engage in intentional silences in order to raise awareness about anti-LGBTQ bias, it does not necessarily lead others to take more responsibility for their ignorance or to address silences around gender and sexuality. This study makes suggestions for implementing change regarding silences of LGBTQ issues in the curricula, pedagogy, and schooling practices...|$|R
50|$|The Government of Kenya made {{significant}} progress in publicly highlighting the dangers of human trafficking and taking steps to combat it during the reporting period. On numerous occasions, senior government officials, including the Vice-President, spoke publicly about trafficking and attended many <b>awareness-raising</b> <b>events,</b> including the Day of the African Child in June. The Kenyan media, especially the government-owned Kenya Broadcasting Corporation, regularly reported cases of suspected human trafficking. In July 2007, the government established the National Steering Committee to Combat Human Trafficking {{under the leadership of}} the Ministry of Home Affairs. Its Sub-Committee appointed to draft a national action plan received two days of training from IOM, after which it convened three drafting sessions and presented an initial outline of the plan in October. Officers from the Ministries of Youth and Labor received anti-trafficking training at IOM workshops in November and December 2007. In July 2007, the Malindi District Commission established and chaired a district-level committee on child sex tourism. In June 2007, a German national {{was arrested and charged with}} sexually exploiting two trafficked children from Nyanza at Likoni Children's Home. There were no reports of the Kenyan government's efforts to provide anti-trafficking training for its troops before deployment on international peacekeeping missions. Non-governmental organizations such as Awareness Against Human Trafficking (HAART) are working on ending human trafficking in Kenya.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{outlines}} preliminary {{research into}} {{the development of a}} formalised mechanism for applying web-based learning materials within further education (FE) and introduces a specific software-based tool- the ‘information gateway ’ (IG) which is designed to support the kind of outcome-based teaching activity which characterises FE. The IG contains resources which have been mapped to the Scottish Further Education Curriculum. Any virtual learning object can be mapped by subject specialists to the SCQF (The Scottish Credit and Qualifications Framework) at Subject, Course, Unit, Outcome and Performance Criteria levels. This mapping allows teachers in Scottish FE to identify effective learning resources, or share good resources that they have found to other teachers across the sector. The mapping function can extend to other frameworks. Studies undertaken within three different user populations assessed the use and requirements of the FE community for such a resource. Interview and questionnaire data were gathered from FE lecturers who had been involved with the initial conceptualisation of the resource, with those who had attended IG <b>awareness-raising</b> <b>events</b> and with those who were using it for the first time. Our findings support earlier research in their emphasis of the critical role of ‘real user ’ needs analysis for the development of good web tools, and support for the development of comfort and familiarity in their use (McAteer et al 2002), for uptake and good practice using ICTs for teaching and learning across the sector...|$|E
