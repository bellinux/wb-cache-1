5000|$|Apparent horizons {{depend on}} the [...] "slicing" [...] of a spacetime. That is, the {{location}} and even existence of an <b>apparent</b> <b>horizon</b> depends on the way spacetime is divided into space and time. For example, {{it is possible to}} slice the Schwarzschild geometry {{in such a way that}} there is no <b>apparent</b> <b>horizon,</b> ever, despite the fact that there is certainly an event horizon.|$|E
50|$|Trapped null {{surfaces}} {{are used in}} the definition of the <b>apparent</b> <b>horizon</b> which typically surrounds a black hole.|$|E
40|$|Merging event horizons of {{the binary}} black holes will be investigated. Though recent {{development}} of the numerical study of the binary black hole coalescence has shown that their <b>apparent</b> <b>horizons</b> can orbit for many periods {{in the case of}} appropriate initial conditions, the <b>apparent</b> <b>horizons</b> only suggests the existence of an event horizon surrounding them. In the present article, we discuss how many periods their event horizons orbit before their coalescence. One finds that they soon merge into one and the black holes cannot orbit for a half period, though the <b>apparent</b> <b>horizons</b> can. We will realize that, after the merging, the event horizon rotates including the <b>apparent</b> <b>horizons</b> inside. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the evolution of}} the <b>apparent</b> <b>horizons</b> in a numerically gererated worm hole spacetime. The behavior of the <b>apparent</b> <b>horizons</b> is affected by the dynamics of the matter field. By using the local mass of the system, we interpret {{the evolution of the}} worm hole structure.

50|$|Apparent horizons are not {{invariant}} {{properties of}} a spacetime, {{and in particular}} they are distinct from event horizons. Within an <b>apparent</b> <b>horizon,</b> light is not {{moving away from the}} black hole, whereas in an event horizon, light cannot escape from the black hole. It is possible for light to be currently moving away from the black hole (and so outside the <b>apparent</b> <b>horizon),</b> but in the future {{will not be able to}} escape (e.g. because the mass of the black hole is growing) and therefore inside the event horizon. Thus the <b>apparent</b> <b>horizon</b> can be thought of as the boundary of black hole for light at this instant, whereas the event horizon is the boundary of the black hole for light in the future.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{solve the}} Plateau problem for <b>apparent</b> <b>horizons</b> on general Cauchy data sets. In our {{construction}} we introduce a Perron method and concepts from geometric measure theory {{to study the}} blow-up behaviour of Jang’s equation. This approach leads to substantial new geometric insights about <b>apparent</b> <b>horizons.</b> The techniques developed in this paper are flexible and {{can be adapted to}} other non-variational existence problems. 1...|$|R

That proves, {{within the framework of}} the (1 + 3) formalism and without resorting to the Birkhoff theorem, that <b>apparent</b> <b>horizons</b> coincide with event horizons in electrovacuum.

40|$|Formulation of the Penrose {{inequality}} becomes ambiguous {{when the}} past and future <b>apparent</b> <b>horizons</b> do cross. We test numerically several natural possibilities of stating the inequality in punctured and boosted single- and double- black holes, in a Dain-Friedrich class of initial data and in conformally flat spheroidal data. The Penrose inequality holds true in vacuum configurations for the outermost element amongst the set of disjoint future and past <b>apparent</b> <b>horizons</b> (as expected) and (unexpectedly) {{for each of the}} outermost past and future <b>apparent</b> <b>horizons,</b> whenever these two bifurcate from an outermost minimal surface, regardless of whether they intersect or remain disjoint. In systems with matter the conjecture breaks down only if matter does not obey the dominant energy condition. Comment: Two formulae are corrected at the end of Sec. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we find new {{examples}} of Riemannian manifolds with outermost <b>apparent</b> <b>horizons</b> with nonspherical topology, in dimensions four and above. More precisely, for any n,m> 1, we construct asymptotically flat, scalar flat Riemannian manifolds containing smooth outermost minimal hypersurfaces with topology S^n× S^m+ 1. In {{the context of}} general relativity these hypersurfaces correspond to outermost <b>apparent</b> <b>horizons</b> of black holes. Comment: Replaced by revised version.

40|$|<b>Apparent</b> <b>horizons</b> are {{structures}} of spacelike hypersurfaces {{that can be}} determined locally in time. Closed surfaces of constant expansion (CE surfaces) are a generalisation of <b>apparent</b> <b>horizons.</b> I present an efficient method for locating CE surfaces. This method uses an explicit representation of the surface, allowing for arbitrary resolutions and, in principle, shapes. The CE surface equation is then solved as a nonlinear elliptic equation. It {{is reasonable to assume}} that CE surfaces foliate a spacelike hypersurface outside of some interior region, thus defining an invariant (but still slicing-dependent) radial coordinate. This can be used to determine gauge modes and to compare time evolutions with different gauge conditions. CE surfaces also provide an efficient way to find new <b>apparent</b> <b>horizons</b> as they appear e. g. in binary black hole simulations. Comment: 21 pages, 8 figures; two references adde...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} a finite-difference method for locating <b>apparent</b> <b>horizons</b> and illustrate its capabilities on boosted Kerr and Schwarzschild black holes. Our model spacetime {{is given by}} the Kerr-Schild metric. We apply a Lorentz boost to this spacetime metric and then carry out a 3 + 1 decomposition. The result is a slicing of Kerr/Schwarzschild in which the black hole is propagated and Lorentz contracted. We show that our method can locate distorted <b>apparent</b> <b>horizons</b> efficiently and accurately. Comment: Submitted to Physical Review D. 12 pages and 22 figure...|$|R
50|$|Studies {{have shown}} that the {{illusion}} can be created without using walls and a ceiling; it is sufficient to create an <b>apparent</b> <b>horizon</b> (which in reality will not be horizontal) against an appropriate background, and the eye relies on the apparent relative height of an object above that horizon.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the simple}} picture of stellar {{collapse}} leading to {{formation of a}} black hole, an event horizon forms before an <b>apparent</b> <b>horizon.</b> [...] As the black hole settles down, the two horizons approach each other, and asymptotically become the same surface. If the AH exists, it is necessarily inside of the EH.|$|E
50|$|Closed trapped {{surfaces}} are a concept used in black hole solutions {{of general relativity}} which describe the inner region of an event horizon. Roger Penrose defined the notion of closed trapped surfaces in 1965. A trapped surface is one where light is not {{moving away from the}} black hole. The boundary of the union of all trapped surfaces around a black hole is called an <b>apparent</b> <b>horizon.</b>|$|E
40|$|We {{show that}} four-dimensional Lorentzian metrics admitting a global spacelike Lie group of isometries, G_ 1 = R, which obey the Einstein {{equations}} for vacuum and {{certain types of}} matter, cannot contain <b>apparent</b> <b>horizons.</b> The assumed global isometry allows for the dimensional reduction of the (3 + 1) system to a (2 + 1) picture, wherein the four-dimensional metric fields act formally as matter fields. A theorem by Ida allows one to check {{for the absence of}} <b>apparent</b> <b>horizons</b> in the dimensionally reduced spacetime, with the four-dimensional results following from the topological product nature of the corresponding manifold. We argue that the absence of <b>apparent</b> <b>horizons</b> in spacetimes with translational symmetry constitutes strong evidence for the validity of the hoop conjecture, and also hints at possible (albeit arguably unlikely) generic violations of strong cosmic censorship.

40|$|Numerical {{studies of}} {{gravitational}} collapse to black holes {{make use of}} <b>apparent</b> <b>horizons,</b> which are intrinsically foliation-dependent. We expose the problem and discuss possible solutions using the Hawking quasilocal mass. In spherical symmetry, we present a physically sensible approach to the problem by restricting to spherically symmetric spacetime slicings. In spherical symmetry the <b>apparent</b> <b>horizons</b> are gauge-independent in any spherically symmetric foliation but physical quantities associated with them, such as surface gravity and temperature, are not. The widely used comoving and Kodama foliations, which are of particular interest, are discussed in detail. Comment: 21 pages, comments welcom...|$|R
40|$|Merging event horizons of {{the binary}} black holes is investigated. While recent {{development}} of the numerical study of the binary black hole coalescence has shown that their <b>apparent</b> <b>horizons</b> can orbit for many periods, we study the orbital motion of the event horizon. We discuss how many periods their event horizons orbit before their coalescence. Then, we find that they soon merge into one and the black holes cannot orbit for a half period while the <b>apparent</b> <b>horizons</b> can orbit many times.

50|$|More generally, Penrose conjectured that an {{inequality}} {{as above}} should hold for spacelike submanifolds of spacetimes {{that are not}} necessarily time-symmetric. In this case, nonnegative scalar curvature is replaced with the dominant energy condition, and one possibility is to replace the minimal surface condition with an <b>apparent</b> <b>horizon</b> condition. Proving such an inequality remains an open problem in general relativity, called the Penrose conjecture.|$|E
5000|$|Consider {{the set of}} {{all such}} trapped {{surfaces}}. In terms of a simple Schwarzschild black hole, these surfaces fill up the black hole. The [...] "apparent horizon" [...] is then defined as the boundary of these surfaces - essentially, it is the outermost surface of the black hole, in this sense. Note, however, that a black hole is defined {{with respect to the}} event horizon, which is not always the same as the <b>apparent</b> <b>horizon.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In {{the context}} of black holes, the term event horizon refers almost {{exclusively}} {{to the notion of}} the [...] "absolute horizon". Much confusion seems to arise concerning the differences between an <b>apparent</b> <b>horizon</b> (AH) and an event horizon (EH). In general, the two need not be the same. For example, {{in the case of a}} perturbed black hole, the EH and the AH generally do not coincide as long as either horizon fluctuates.|$|E
40|$|We have {{developed}} a general method for finding <b>apparent</b> <b>horizons</b> in 3 D numerical relativity. Instead of solving for the partial differential equation describing {{the location of the}} <b>apparent</b> <b>horizons,</b> we expand the closed 2 D surfaces in terms of symmetric trace [...] free tensors and solve for the expansion coefficients using a minimization procedure. Our method is applied to a number of different spacetimes, including numerically constructed spacetimes containing highly distorted axisymmetric black holes in spherical coordinates, and 3 D rotating, and colliding black holes in Cartesian coordinates.

40|$|We {{analyze the}} horizon {{structure}} of families of space times obtained by evolving initial data sets containing <b>apparent</b> <b>horizons</b> with several connected components. We show that under certain smallness conditions the outermost <b>apparent</b> <b>horizons</b> {{will also have}} several connected components. We further show that, again under a smallness condition, the maximal globally hyperbolic development of the many black hole initial data constructed by Chrusciel and Delay, or of hyperboloidal data of Isenberg, Mazzeo and Pollack, will have an event horizon, the intersection of which with the initial data hypersurface is not connected. This justifies the "many black hole" character of those space-times. Comment: several graphic file...|$|R

Introduction. The Cosmic Censorship Hypothesis (CCH) [?] is certainly the most compelling open problem of classical general relativity.

50|$|If a {{particle}} is {{moving at a}} constant velocity in a non-expanding universe free of gravitational fields, any event that occurs in that Universe will eventually be observable by the particle, because the forward light cones from these events intersect the particle's world line. On the other hand, if the particle is accelerating, in some situations light cones from some events never intersect the particle's world line. Under these conditions, an <b>apparent</b> <b>horizon</b> {{is present in the}} particle's (accelerating) reference frame, representing a boundary beyond which events are unobservable.|$|E
50|$|Note {{that the}} above {{considerations}} are strictly speaking true for the geometric horizon only. That is, the horizon {{as it would}} appear for an observer at sea level on a perfectly smooth Earth without an atmosphere. In practice the <b>apparent</b> <b>horizon</b> has a slight negative altitude due to the curvature of the Earth, the value of which gets more negative as the observer ascends higher above sea level. In addition, atmospheric refraction causes celestial objects {{very close to the}} horizon to appear about half a degree higher than they would if there were no atmosphere.|$|E
50|$|For example, {{this occurs}} with a uniformly {{accelerated}} particle. A space-time diagram {{of this situation}} {{is shown in the}} figure to the right. As the particle accelerates, it approaches, but never reaches, the speed of light with respect to its original reference frame. On the space-time diagram, its path is a hyperbola, which asymptotically approaches a 45 degree line (the path of a light ray). An event whose light cone's edge is this asymptote or is farther away than this asymptote can never be observed by the accelerating particle. In the particle's reference frame, {{there appears to be a}} boundary behind it from which no signals can escape (an <b>apparent</b> <b>horizon).</b>|$|E
