5|$|Repco racing engines were {{designed}} by the leading motorcycle engine designer, Phil Irving, and built by a small team at a Repco subsidiary, Repco-Brabham engines Pty Ltd, in Maidstone, Australia. Repco's 620 series engine is a normally aspirated unit with eight cylinders in a 'V' configuration. It uses American engine blocks obtained from Oldsmobile's aluminium alloy 215 engine. Oldsmobile's 215 engine, used in the F-85 Cutlass compact car between 1961 and 1963, was abandoned by General Motors after production problems. Repco fitted their own cast iron cylinder liners into the Oldsmobile blocks, which were also stiffened with two Repco magnesium <b>alloy</b> <b>castings</b> and feature Repco-designed cylinder heads with chain-driven single overhead camshafts. The internals of the unit consist of a bespoke Laystall crankshaft, Daimler or Chevrolet connecting rods and specially cast pistons. The cylinder head design means that the engine's exhaust pipes exit on the outer side of the block, and therefore pass through the spaceframe before tucking inside the rear suspension, a layout which complicated Tauranac's design work considerably. The engine is water-cooled, with oil and water radiators mounted in the nose.|$|E

40|$|Hardness {{together}} with abrasivity is quite {{often used in}} the field of wear resistance as the criteria for judging surfaces of the <b>alloys,</b> <b>castings,</b> hardfacings and overlays.

The effect of radiation modification and chemical compatibilization (polypropylene grafted maleic anhydride) on the microdeformative and structural properties of the investigated compositions was determined. It was concluded that micromechanical properties of the investigated compositions – especially those with higher PET content – were strongly dependent from the crystallinity of polyester. By increasing PET content in the investigated multiphase systems universal microhardness and microhardness modulus increased, but microcreep decreased, that allowed assume that wear resistance of the compositions also increased.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} work is to {{investigate}} the influence of solidification thermal parameters on the microstructural array of Al 5 wt. % Cu and Al 9 wt. % Si <b>alloys</b> <b>castings</b> {{with a view to}} developing correlations between the as-cast dendritic microstructure, the electrochemical corrosion resistance and the tensile mechanical strength. Considering the as-cast Al 5 wt. % Cu alloy, it was found that smaller secondary dendrite arm spacings (2) increase both the ultimate tensile strength (UTS) and the corrosion resistance. For the Al 9 wt. % Si alloy, it is shown that the UTS also increase with the decrease in 2, however, the corrosion resistance decreases. A combined plot of corrosion resistance and UTS as a function of 2 is proposed with a view to determining an optimum range of secondary dendrite arm spacings which provides good balance between both properties...|$|R

40|$|Thermophysical {{properties}} of several binary aluminium - silicon <b>alloys</b> <b>castings</b> were studied using Differential scanning calorimetry and Dilatometry. In {{this research is}} investigated the behaviour of the material during the first heating after casting. The temperature range examined is 100 – 500 °C with a scan rate of 10 K/min. Therefore, only phase transformations of the solid-state are involved. The results have shown an evident thermal effect around 270 – 300 °C for all the samples in both DSC and DIL analysis. DSC analysis has determined that is involved an exothermal process, and the same process in dilatometry analysis causes a quick increase of the coefficient of thermal expansion. This thermal effect reaches the maximum value for an amount of silicon of 6 - 9 %wt. The reason of this peak is related with {{the transformation of the}} oversaturated α-aluminium solid solution present in the alloy (even for hypereutectic compositions). The oversaturation is due to the rapid solidification that occur during the casting process...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Welding and pad welding {{are widely}} used methods of repair and {{regeneration}} of defective magnesium <b>alloys</b> <b>castings.</b> AZ 91 {{is one of the}} most popular magnesium alloys used at temperature up to 120 °C. Therefore there is need to study the influence of welding and elevated temperature exposure on the microstructure and properties of AZ 91 weld joints. This paper discusses microstructural stability of AZ 91 gas tungsten arc weld joint in T 6 condition (solution treated and aged). In order to examine the weld joint microstructural stability, the long-term annealing has been carried out at 120 °C. Hardness of the base metal and fusion weld was measured after 250, 500, 750 and 1000 h exposure respectively. Additionally, the base metal and the weld metal microstructure after 1000 h annealing was investigated. Both in the base metal and in the weld, long-term annealing caused decrease in the intermetallic phases volume fraction. However, neither phase composition nor hardness of the weld joint were influenced by the heat treatment. Based on these results, it could be stated that the microstructure of investigated weld joint is stable at working temperature...|$|R

40|$|In this article, {{there were}} {{presented}} {{the results of}} research on combined mechanical and thermal regeneration of waste moulding sand with furfuryl resin originated from one of national foundries manufacturing aluminium <b>alloys</b> <b>castings.</b> Attempts of mechanical reclamation were led on the REGMAS reclaimer enabling to realize preliminary and primary reclamation with use of two modes of mechanical interactions on waste moulding sand. In the first attempt the reclaimer worked without any additional regenerating elements, and as the second solution, the reclaimer operated with additional crushing and abrasive elements to increase the result of primary reclamation. Thermal reclamation was led in the prototypic thermal reclaimer, enabling to fully control the process of grain matrix recovery. As a result of completed investigations the small efficiency of mechanical reclamation was determined. However, use of combined regeneration allowed for obtaining grain matrix of high purity.

40|$|The {{production}} {{of high quality}} titanium and titanium <b>alloys</b> <b>castings</b> is a difficult and expensive task. The main reasons for that are: the high melting point; the extremely high reactivity of titanium alloys against {{a large amount of}} elements (solid, liquids and gaseous) at high temperatures, with particular emphasis to oxygen. For this reason, traditional casting techniques and materials cannot be used, both for the melting and the moulding operations, and melting and pouring have to be performed under vacuum or inert gas. However, such demands are extremely important factors to the high cost of titanium castings, and one possible way to decrease it might be the use of traditional casting techniques, with slight changes both on materials and production equipments and procedures. This paper describes the production technique of TiAl castings, using a multi-layered refractory crucible based on stabilized zirconia, and pouring in different refractory investment casting shells. Microhardness and residual elements concentration profiles, from the surface to the inside of castings, characterization of the metal-mould interface, and surface finish of samples will be presented and discussed, and results compared with the available bibliographic references, for this kind of allo...|$|R
