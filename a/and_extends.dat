5|$|There are 50,000 Antakarana in Madagascar as of 2013. They live in {{the northernmost}} part of the island, and claim Malagasy and Arab ancestry. They are an {{offshoot}} of the Sakalava people. Their territory begins at the northern tip of the island at Antsiranana <b>and</b> <b>extends</b> down the west coast, including the island of Nosy Mitsio. It is bounded to the east by the Bemarivo River <b>and</b> <b>extends</b> south to the village of Tetezambato.|$|E
5|$|In all molluscs, {{the mantle}} forms a thin {{membrane}} {{that covers the}} animal's body <b>and</b> <b>extends</b> out from it in flaps or lobes. In bivalves, the mantle lobes secrete the valves, and the mantle crest secretes the whole hinge mechanism consisting of ligament, byssus threads (where present), and teeth.|$|E
5|$|It has paired {{blowholes}} on {{a prominent}} splashguard and a broad, flat, V-shaped rostrum. A single median ridge stops {{well short of}} the rostrum tip. A light V-shaped marking, the chevron, begins behind the blowholes <b>and</b> <b>extends</b> back and then forward again.|$|E

5|$|Carleton then {{launched}} his own offensive intended {{to reach the}} Hudson River, whose navigable length begins south of Lake Champlain <b>and</b> <b>extends</b> down to New York City. Control of the upper Hudson would enable the British to link their forces in Quebec with those in New York, recently captured in the New York campaign by Major General William Howe.

5|$|Human {{cultivation}} {{and use of}} saffron spans {{more than}} 3,500 years <b>and</b> <b>extends</b> across cultures, continents, and civilizations. Saffron, a spice derived from the dried stigmas of the saffron crocus (Crocus sativus), has through history remained among the world's most costly substances. With its bitter taste, hay-like fragrance, and slight metallic notes, the apocarotenoid-rich saffron {{has been used as}} a seasoning, fragrance, dye, and medicine.|$|E
5|$|It is {{most common}} amongst the kwongan heath of the Geraldton Sandplains north of Jurien; {{it has a}} fairly {{continuous}} distribution there, often as the dominant species, <b>and</b> <b>extends</b> inland to around the 350mm isohyet. On the Swan Coastal Plain to the south, its distribution is discontinuous, being largely confined to patches of suitable sand in the narrow transition zone where tuart forest gives way to jarrah forest.

The bridge design by Renzo Piano, the architect of the Modern Wing, was inspired by the hull of a boat.|$|E
5|$|The Venus Express probe {{has shown}} through stellar {{occultation}} that the atmospheric haze extends much further {{up on the}} night side than the day side. On the day side the cloud deck has a thickness of 20km <b>and</b> <b>extends</b> up to about 65km, whereas on the night side the cloud deck {{in the form of}} a thick haze reaches up to 90km in altitude—well into mesosphere, continuing even further to 105km as a more transparent haze.

5|$|Among animals, {{there exists}} a single known example of an {{apparently}} freely-rotating structure, though it is used for digestion rather than propulsion: the crystalline style of certain bivalves and gastropods. The style consists of a transparent glycoprotein rod which is continuously formed in a cilia-lined sac <b>and</b> <b>extends</b> into the stomach. The cilia rotate the rod, so that it becomes wrapped in strands of mucus. As the rod slowly dissolves in the stomach, it releases digestive enzymes. Estimates {{of the speed of}} rotation of the style in vivo vary significantly, and it is unclear if the style is rotated continuously or intermittently.|$|E
5|$|Animal Rights Without Liberation: Applied Ethics and Human Obligations is a 2012 book by the British {{political}} theorist Alasdair Cochrane, {{in which}} it is argued that animal rights philosophy can be decoupled from animal liberation philosophy by the adoption of the interest-based rights approach. Cochrane, arguing that there is no reason that (nonhuman) animals should be excluded from justice, adopts Joseph Raz's account of interest rights <b>and</b> <b>extends</b> it to include animals. He argues that sentient animals possess a right not to be made to suffer and a right not to be killed, but not a right to freedom. The book's chapters apply Cochrane's account to a number of interactions between humans and animals; first animal experimentation, then animal agriculture, the genetic engineering of animals, the use of animals in entertainment and sport, the relationship of animals to environmental practices and the use of animals in cultural practices.|$|E
