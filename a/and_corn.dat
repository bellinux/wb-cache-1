5|$|Collins and his {{partners}} brought in slaves from Africa to dig a canal from Lake Phelps to the Scuppernong River. The canal served two purposes: first, {{as a means of}} transporting goods and people to and from the plantation; and second, it served as a massive drainage ditch as the slaves of Somerset Place worked to drain the surrounding swamps. Later, the canal system was expanded to provide irrigation for the rice <b>and</b> <b>corn</b> fields of the plantation.|$|E
5|$|Massachusetts was {{originally}} inhabited by tribes of the Algonquian language family {{such as the}} Wampanoag, Narragansett, Nipmuc, Pocomtuc, Mahican, and Massachusett. While cultivation of crops like squash <b>and</b> <b>corn</b> supplemented their diets, these tribes were generally dependent on hunting, gathering and fishing {{for most of their}} food. Villages consisted of lodges called wigwams as well as longhouses, and tribes were led by male or female elders known as sachems.|$|E

The city regained some of its prosperity during the Umayyad era, indicated by {{the discovery of a}} large Umayyad souq in the colonnaded street. Palmyra was a minor trading center until its {{destruction in}} 1400; according to Sharaf ad-Din Ali Yazdi, Timur's men took 200,000 sheep, and the city was reduced into a settlement on the desert border whose inhabitants herded and cultivated small plots for vegetables <b>and</b> <b>corn.</b>|$|E
5|$|Argentina {{is highly}} {{dependent}} on water supplies originating outside its borders, making it highly vulnerable to changes in water supply due to climate change. Droughts are frequent and devastating. Several years of droughts {{during the last decade}} have severely affected agricultural production and reduced economic growth. A drought in 2009 was the worst drought in more than 50 years. Many cattle died of hunger, and huge swaths of soy, corn and wheat fields were affected. It was estimated that the country lost more than US$5billion from the drought. A drought in 2011 affected farming of soy <b>and</b> <b>corn,</b> causing losses of US$2.5billion.|$|E
5|$|Capital to {{fund the}} scheme had been raised {{separately}} by the Wakefield and Leeds committees. A complicated restructuring of the finances in 1721 fixed the nominal capital at £26,700. Regular dividends at 7 per cent were paid to the shareholders from 1718, and the navigation was leased to various groups, who {{would be responsible for}} collection of tolls and repairs. The lease rose from £800 in 1704 to £2,600 in 1729, when receipts from each of the previous five years had averaged £6,016. The early trade consisted mainly of woollen goods from Leeds, Wakefield, Halifax and Bradford, with wool <b>and</b> <b>corn</b> from Lincolnshire and East Anglia travelling in the opposite direction. By the 1720s there were also significant quantities of coal.|$|E

5|$|Farmers rely on weather {{forecasts}} {{to decide}} what work to do on any particular day. For example, drying hay is only feasible in dry weather. Prolonged periods of dryness can ruin cotton, wheat, <b>and</b> <b>corn</b> crops. While corn crops can be ruined by drought, their dried remains {{can be used as}} a cattle feed substitute in the form of silage. Frosts and freezes play havoc with crops both during the spring and fall. For example, peach trees in full bloom can have their potential peach crop decimated by a spring freeze. Orange groves can suffer significant damage during frosts and freezes, regardless of their timing.|$|E
5|$|Heather moor {{containing}} ling, bell heather, cross-leaved heath, {{bog myrtle}} and fescues is everywhere abundant. The high Black Cuillins weather too slowly {{to produce a}} soil that sustains a rich plant life, but each of the main peninsulas has an individual flora. The basalt underpinnings of Trotternish produce a diversity of Arctic and alpine plants including alpine pearlwort and mossy cyphal. The low-lying fields of Waternish contain corn marigold <b>and</b> <b>corn</b> spurry. The sea cliffs of Duirinish boast mountain avens and fir clubmoss. Minginish produces fairy flax, cats-ear and black bog rush. There is {{a fine example of}} Brachypodium-rich ash woodland at Tokavaig in Sleat incorporating silver birch, hazel, bird cherry, and hawthorn.|$|E
5|$|Modern deep frying {{began in}} the 19th century with the growing {{popularity}} of cast iron, particularly around the American South which {{led to the development of}} many modern deep-fried dishes. French fries, invented in the late 18th century, became popular in the early 19th century western Europe. Doughnuts were invented in the mid-19th century, with foods such as onion rings, deep-fried turkey, <b>and</b> <b>corn</b> dogs all being invented in the early 20th century. In recent years, the growth of fast food has expanded the reach of deep-fried foods, especially French fries.|$|E

5|$|Synthetic nitrogen, {{along with}} mined rock phosphate, {{pesticides}} and mechanization, have greatly increased crop yields {{in the early}} 20th century. Increased supply of grains has led to cheaper livestock as well. Further, global yield increases were experienced later in the 20th century when high-yield varieties of common staple grains such as rice, wheat, <b>and</b> <b>corn</b> were introduced {{as a part of}} the Green Revolution. The Green Revolution exported the technologies (including pesticides and synthetic nitrogen) of the developed world to the developing world. Thomas Malthus famously predicted that the Earth would not be able to support its growing population, but technologies such as the Green Revolution have allowed the world to produce a surplus of food.|$|E
5|$|The last {{stretch of}} Hebden Beck {{before it reaches}} the River Wharfe was used to power a corn mill in the Middle Ages, <b>and</b> <b>corn</b> milling survived {{into the middle of}} the 19th century. In the 14th century Fountains Abbey had a fulling mill in the village. In 1791 a three-storey cotton mill was built {{alongside}} the corn mill. It housed 54 spinning frames and was productive until 1870 when it was driven out of business by the more efficient stream-driven machinery of the industrial revolution. At its peak, the mill employed more than 70 men, women, and children. The building was used for other purposes including a roller skating rink until it was demolished in 1967.|$|E
5|$|A {{computer}} program such as KetoCalculator {{may be used}} to help generate recipes. The meals often have four components: heavy whipping cream, a protein-rich food (typically meat), a fruit or vegetable and a fat such as butter, vegetable oil or mayonnaise. Only low-carbohydrate fruits and vegetables are allowed, which excludes bananas, potatoes, peas <b>and</b> <b>corn.</b> Suitable fruits are divided into two groups based on the amount of carbohydrate they contain, and vegetables are similarly divided into two groups. Foods within each of these four groups may be freely substituted to allow for variation without needing to recalculate portion sizes. For example, cooked broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cauliflower and green beans are all equivalent. Fresh, canned or frozen foods are equivalent, but raw and cooked vegetables differ, and processed foods are an additional complication. Parents are required to be precise when measuring food quantities on an electronic scale accurate to 1g. The child must eat the whole meal and cannot have extra portions; any snacks must be incorporated into the meal plan. A small amount of MCT oil {{may be used to}} help with constipation or to increase ketosis.|$|E

5|$|Archaeological {{excavations}} of {{the area}} in 1962-1963 suggest that the original settlement was centred {{to the east of}} St Peter's Church, with Mary-le-Port on its western limit. The building of Bristol Castle {{in the latter part of}} the 11th century resulted in the focus of the settlement being moved to the west, where it developed into a symmetrical plan centred on the crossroads of High Street, Wine Street, Broad Street <b>and</b> <b>Corn</b> Street. The area around Mary-le-Port Street was thus the most ancient part of the mediaeval city. Bristol Castle was home to the Norman garrison, and was a massive structure whose keep was comparable to that of the Tower of London. The castle occupied the whole of the eastern end of today's Castle park, from just east of St Peter's Church to Lower Castle Street.|$|E
5|$|Bridgwater was {{incorporated}} by charter of Edward IV (1468), confirmed in 1554, 1586, 1629 and 1684. Parliamentary representation as a borough constituency began in 1295 and continued until the Reform Act of 1870, {{when the original}} borough constituency was disenfranchised for corruption. From 4 July 1870 the town {{was incorporated}} within the county constituency of West Somerset. When Parliamentary seats were redistributed for the 1885 general election, a new county division of Bridgwater was created. A variety of markets were granted to the town during the Middle Ages including a Midsummer fair (on 24 June), one {{at the beginning of}} Lent was added in 1468, and one at Michaelmas. The importance of these markets and fairs for the sale of wool and wine, and later of cloth, declined after medieval times. The shipping trade of the port revived after the construction of the new dock in 1841, <b>and</b> <b>corn</b> and timber have been imported for centuries.|$|E
5|$|Cardigan {{was one of}} {{the major}} ports of {{southern}} Wales until its harbour silted in the mid-19th century. The Industrial Revolution passed by, not much affecting the area. In the uplands, wheeled vehicles were rare in the 18th century, and horses and sleds were still being used for transport. On the coast, trade in herrings <b>and</b> <b>corn</b> took place across the Irish Sea. In the 19th century, many of the rural poor emigrated to the New World from Cardigan, between five and six thousand leaving the town between 1790 and 1860. Aberystwyth became the main centre for the export of lead and Aberaeron and Newquay did brisk coastal trade. The building of the railway from Shrewsbury in the 1860s encouraged visitors and hotels sprang up in the town to accommodate them.|$|E
