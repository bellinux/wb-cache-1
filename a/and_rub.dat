5|$|In nature, it was {{observed}} that males would venture away from the nest in order to attract females. The males would press their gastral sterna against a perch <b>and</b> <b>rub</b> their mandibular against it. This is used to attract females, and females were observed to visit these branches and sample the scents. Interestingly, it was also found that on some occasions, males were attracted to other male scents.|$|E
5|$|Jewish legend {{records that}} Samson's {{shoulders}} were sixty cubits broad. (Many Talmudic commentaries, however, explain {{that this is}} not to be taken literally, for a person that size could not live normally in society. Rather, it means that he had the ability to carry a burden 60 cubits wide (approximately 30 meters) on his shoulders). He was lame in both feet but, when the spirit of God came upon him, he could step with one stride from Zorah to Eshtaol, while the hairs of his head arose and clashed against one another so that they could be heard for a like distance. Samson was said to be so strong that he could uplift two mountains <b>and</b> <b>rub</b> them together like two s of earth, yet his superhuman strength, like Goliath's, brought woe upon its possessor.|$|E

5|$|Millipedes are preyed on by a {{wide range}} of animals, {{including}} various reptiles, amphibians, birds, mammals, and insects. Mammalian predators such as coatis and meerkats roll captured millipedes on the ground to deplete <b>and</b> <b>rub</b> off their defensive secretions before consuming their prey, and certain poison dart frogs are believed to incorporate the toxic compounds of millipedes into their own defences. Several invertebrates have specialised behaviours or structures to feed on millipedes, including larval glowworm beetles, Probolomyrmex ants, chlamydephorid slugs, and predaceous dung beetles of the genera Sceliages and Deltochilum. A large subfamily of assassin bugs, the Ectrichodiinae with over 600 species, has specialized in preying upon millipedes. Parasites of millipedes include nematodes, phaeomyiid flies, and acanthocephalans.|$|E
5|$|Lens luxation, {{also known}} as ectopia lentis {{is the most common}} {{hereditary}} disorder in Jack Russell terriers. Even so, this condition is not a common occurrence in the breed. Most frequently appearing in dogs between the ages of 3 and 8 years old, it is where the lens in one or both eyes becomes displaced. There are two types, posterior luxation (where the lens slips {{to the back of the}} eye) and anterior luxation (where the lens slips forward). Posterior luxation is the less severe of the two types, as the eye can appear normal although the dog's eyesight will be affected. In anterior luxation, the lens can slip forward <b>and</b> <b>rub</b> against the cornea, damaging it. Anterior luxation also has a high probability of causing glaucoma which can lead to partial or complete blindness. Treatment is available and may include both medical and surgical options. Secondary lens luxation is caused by trauma to the eye and is not hereditary. The condition appears in a number of terrier breeds as well as the Border collie, Brittany and Cardigan Welsh corgi.|$|E

25|$|A {{specially}} constructed pavilion is erected on {{a courtyard}} between the Phaisan Thaksin and Chakkraphat Phiman Halls. Once {{the king is}} seated inside the pavilion, some of the water {{will be given to}} him in a small golden bowl. The king will dip his hand into this water <b>and</b> <b>rub</b> {{the top of his head}} with it. A rope will then be pulled, which releases a shower of water from a canopy above. The king will be offered the water in small bowls by members of the Buddhist clergy, the royal family, government ministers, and other officials as an act of blessing.|$|E
25|$|Medical hand-washing is for {{a minimum}} of 15 seconds, using generous amounts of soap and water or gel to lather <b>and</b> <b>rub</b> each part of the hands. Hands should be rubbed {{together}} with digits interlocking. If there is debris under fingernails, a bristle brush may be used to remove it. Since germs may remain in the water on the hands, it is important to rinse well and wipe dry with a clean towel. After drying, the paper towel should be used to turn off the water (and open any exit door if necessary). This avoids re-contaminating the hands from those surfaces.|$|E
25|$|First {{one should}} rinse hands with warm water, keeping hands below wrists and forearms, to prevent {{contaminated}} water from {{moving from the}} hands to the wrists and arms. The warm water helps to open pores, which helps with the removal of microorganisms, without removing skin oils. One should use five milliliters of liquid soap, to completely cover the hands, <b>and</b> <b>rub</b> wet, soapy hands together, outside the running water, for at least 20 seconds. The most commonly missed areas are the thumb, the wrist, the areas between the fingers, and under fingernails. Artificial nails and chipped nail polish harbor microorganisms.|$|E

25|$|Adult sloth bears may {{travel in}} pairs, with the males being gentle with cubs. They may fight for food. They {{walk in a}} slow, shambling motion, with their feet being set down in a noisy, {{flapping}} motion. They are capable of galloping faster than running humans. Although they appear slow and clumsy, both young and adult sloth bears are excellent climbers. They climb to feed and to rest, though not to escape enemies, as they prefer to stand their ground. Sloth bear mothers carry cubs up to 9 months old on their backs instead of sending their cubs up trees as the primary defense against attacks by predators, such as tigers, leopards, and other bears. They are capable of climbing on smooth surfaces and hanging upside down like sloths. They are good swimmers, and primarily enter water to play. To mark their territories, sloth bears scrape trees with their forepaws, <b>and</b> <b>rub</b> against them with their flanks. Sloth bears have a great vocal range. Gary Brown, in his Great Bear Almanac, lists over 25 different sounds in 16 different contexts. Sounds such as barks, screams, grunts, roars, snarls, whickers, woofs, and yelps are made when angered, threatening, or when fighting. When hurt or afraid, they shriek, yowl, or whimper. When feeding, sloth bears make loud huffing and sucking noises, which can be heard over 100 m away. Sounds such as gurgling or humming are made by bears resting or sucking their paws. Sows emit crooning sounds to their cubs. The species is the most vociferous when mating, and make loud, melodious calls when doing so. Sloth bears do not hibernate. They make their day beds out of broken branches in trees, and rest in caves during the wet season. Sloth bears are the most nocturnal of bears, though sows become more active in daytime when with cubs.|$|E
500|$|By 1856 Quimby had 500 {{patients}} a year. He would {{sit next to}} them and explain that the disease was something their minds could control; sometimes he would wet his hands <b>and</b> <b>rub</b> their heads, {{but it was the}} talking that helped them, he said, not the manipulation. Quimby began to write his thoughts down around 1859—his work was published posthumously as The Quimby Manuscripts in 1921—and was generous in allowing his patients to copy one of his essays, [...] "Questions and Answers." [...] This became an issue, from 1883 onwards, when Eddy was accused of having based Christian Science on his work.|$|E

500|$|Potential predators of {{the silky}} shark include larger sharks and killer whales (Orcinus orca). Known parasites of this shark include the isopod Gnathia trimaculata, the copepod Kroeyerina cortezensis, and the {{tapeworms}} Dasyrhynchus variouncinatus and Phyllobothrium sp. Silky sharks frequently intermingle with schools of scalloped hammerheads (Sphyrna lewini), {{and have been}} known to follow marine mammals. One account from the Red Sea describes 25silky sharks following a large pod of bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops sp.), along with 25grey reef sharks (C.amblyrhynchos) and a lone silvertip shark (C.albimarginatus). Silky sharks are themselves accompanied by juvenile pilot fish (Naucrates ductor), which [...] "ride" [...] the pressure wave ahead of the shark, as well as by jacks, which snatch scraps of food <b>and</b> <b>rub</b> against the shark's skin to scrape off parasites.|$|E
500|$|The {{read-through}} for [...] "Cold War" [...] {{took place}} on 6 June 2012, with filming beginning on 13 June. For the submarine setting, the cast would be sprayed in between every take. The scenes in which the characters are drenched in water were achieved by constantly pouring [...] "gallons and gallons of water" [...] on the cast. Coleman found the experience fun, while Smith said that it made acting easier. Coleman said, [...] "The whole make-up process was reversed as they would damp us down in the morning <b>and</b> <b>rub</b> my mascara off!" [...] For the shots of the submarine in the ocean, a model was used. It was suspended upside-down with [...] "shredded feathers" [...] blown at it to give the effect of being under the sea.|$|E
500|$|Also defined herewith: passive anting. A self-anointing {{behaviour}} {{during which}} birds rub insects, usually ants, on their [...] and skin. The bird may {{pick up the}} insects in their [...] <b>and</b> <b>rub</b> them on the body, or the bird may lie {{in an area of}} high density of the insects and perform dust bathing-like movements. The insects secrete liquids containing chemicals such as formic acid, which can act as an insecticide, miticide, fungicide or bactericide. Alternatively, anting could make the insects edible by removing the distasteful acid, or, possibly supplement the bird's own preen oil. Instead of ants, some birds can also use millipedes. More than 200 species of bird are known to ant. The practice may be called [...] "passive anting", when a bird simply positions itself to allow ants to crawl through its plumage.|$|E
