5|$|In , Sora and Riku {{undertake}} a Mark of Mastery exam {{in response to}} Xehanort's return. The two are sent to awaken several worlds submerged in sleep after the defeat of Ansem, but once the task is complete, Sora's heart is damaged by Xemnas, whose companions plan to turn him into a vessel for Xehanort's heart. Riku and his friends save Sora and {{bring him back to}} Yen Sid's tower, where Riku dives into Sora's body and repairs his heart, awakening him from his coma. As Yen Sid promotes Riku as a Keyblade Master, Sora congratulates him and continues to train elsewhere. In the ending of Kingdom Hearts 0.2 Birth by Sleep – A Fragmentary Passage for Kingdom Hearts HD 2.8 Final Chapter Prologue, Yen Sid reveals Sora lost most of his powers when Xehanort tried to take over his body. After advising Sora to seek out one who already went through <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> <b>experience,</b> Sora, Donald, and Goofy go to Olympus Coliseum.|$|E
5|$|The {{architectural}} firm Ellerbe Becket, {{in association with}} Loschky Marquardt & Nesholm Architects of Seattle, designed the 1,500,000sqft(140,000m2) project. Allen was closely involved during the design process. While growing up he attended games at the University of Washington's outdoor Husky Stadium. His goal was to create <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> <b>experience</b> and atmosphere at the new venue. The exhibition center portion {{of the project was}} designed over a period of 14months by Loschky Marquardt & Nesholm Architects while First & Goal managed the construction. Town meetings were held to discuss the impact on the public, and the company created a $6million mitigation fund for nearby neighborhoods. In accordance with a program established by the building team, contracts totaling $81million were awarded to minority- and women-owned businesses. Union apprentices made up 19% of the workforce through another program with local trade unions.|$|E
5|$|Mike Walsh {{was worried}} about filming the moment when a beam breaks inside the Luthor mansion, from the wind {{generated}} by the storm, and lands on top of Lionel. His crew already knew which beam was going to fall, {{but they did not}} know where to cut the beam because they were not sure how Beeman intended to shoot the scene. When the day of shooting came around everything worked out well. They used a stunt double for the initial impact of the beam, and then John Glover stepped back into the scene and fell down with the beam on top of him. The wind effects also created potential danger for the cast and crew. As Eric Johnson recalls, even the smallest piece of debris flying around at such high speeds can cause damage. Annette O’Toole had <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> <b>experience</b> for her scenes in the storm cellar. When Jonathan races into the storm after Nixon, the special effects crew used one of their jet fans and some dry leaves to simulate the winds that were coming from outside; the dry leaves were smacking O’Toole in the face, smothering her.|$|E
50|$|Vesical {{tenesmus}} is <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> condition, <b>experienced</b> as <b>a</b> {{feeling of}} incomplete voiding despite the bladder being empty.|$|R
50|$|Traditional mobile mail clients may poll for new mail at {{frequent}} intervals, with {{or without}} downloading the mail to the client, thus providing <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> user <b>experience</b> as push email.|$|R
50|$|Ridge Racer DS is a {{video game}} for the Nintendo DS based on the Nintendo 64 release. The game was remade {{to make use of}} {{features}} on the DS such as the touch-screen and wireless multi-player while providing otherwise <b>a</b> very <b>similar</b> <b>experience</b> to its original counterpart.|$|R
25|$|<b>A</b> <b>similar</b> <b>experience</b> {{happened}} to Pete Ferrall in Seadragon, who fired eight torpedoes {{for only one}} hit and began to suspect the Mark14 was faulty.|$|E
25|$|In the center, Nicholls's Louisiana brigade had <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> <b>experience</b> to Jones's. The attackers were {{essentially}} {{invisible in the}} dark except for brief instances when they fired, but the defensive works were impressive, and the 78th and 102nd New York regiments suffered few casualties in a fight that lasted four hours.|$|E
25|$|Perlis had <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> <b>experience.</b> The ruler did not {{recognise}} the 1909 treaty but the British were {{de facto}} administrators of the state. It {{was only in}} 1930 that the ruler Raja Syed Alwi recognised the British presence in Perlis by admitting Meadows Frost as the first British advisor in Perlis.|$|E
50|$|A third category, {{also known}} as “overlay payment solutions” provide <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> {{consumer}} <b>experience</b> to Online Banking ePayments, but violate a key tenet of the OBeP definition by requiring the consumer to share their online banking credentials with a third party.|$|R
50|$|Embraer 175 {{regional}} jets {{are equipped}} with a First Class cabin and Premium Class cabin and offer <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> onboard <b>experience</b> to that of Alaska, with complementary meals in First Class, complementary snacks in Premium Class and complementary alcoholic beverages in both classes.|$|R
50|$|Sunday Assembly is a non-religious {{gathering}} co-founded by Sanderson Jones and Pippa Evans in January 2013 in London, England. The gathering {{is mostly}} for non-religious {{people who want}} <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> communal <b>experience</b> to <b>a</b> religious church, though religious people are also welcome.|$|R
25|$|Online banking {{was first}} {{introduced}} in the early 1980s in New York, United States. Four major banks — Citibank, Chase Bank, Chemical Bank and Manufacturers Hanover — offered home banking services. Chemical introduced its Pronto services for individuals and small businesses in 1983, which enabled individual and small-business clients to maintain electronic checkbook registers, see account balances, and transfer funds between checking and savings accounts. Pronto failed to attract enough customers to break even and was abandoned in 1989. Other banks had <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> <b>experience.</b>|$|E
25|$|In February 2017, Whole Foods Market Inc. said {{it would}} close nine of its stores and lowered its {{financial}} projections for the year, moves made as the natural-foods company struggled with increased competition and slowing sales growth. In late April 2017, Whole Foods reported their sixth consecutive quarters of declining sales and announced that the company would be closing nine stores: two each in Colorado and California, and one each in Georgia, Arizona, Utah, New Mexico, and Chicago, Illinois. The loss of revenue was attributed to foot traffic being down and other supermarkets offering <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> <b>experience</b> for a lower cost.|$|E
25|$|Approaches that {{represent}} previous experiences directly and use <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> <b>experience</b> {{to form a}} local model are often called nearest neighbour or k-nearest neighbors methods. Deep learning is useful in semantic hashing where a deep graphical model the word-count vectors obtained from a large set of documents. Documents are mapped to memory addresses {{in such a way}} that semantically similar documents are located at nearby addresses. Documents similar to a query document can then be found by accessing all the addresses that differ by only a few bits from the address of the query document. Unlike sparse distributed memory that operates on 1000-bit addresses, semantic hashing works on 32 or 64-bit addresses found in a conventional computer architecture.|$|E
5000|$|Music informatics, as {{a degree}} subject, offers <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> {{learning}} <b>experience</b> to music technology, but goes further into learning the principles behind the technology. [...] Informatics students will not just use existing music hardware and software, but will learn programming and artificial intelligence.|$|R
50|$|The {{fact that}} light sources with vastly {{different}} spectral power distributions {{can result in}} <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> sensory <b>experience</b> {{is due to the}} way the light is processed by the visual system. One color that arise from two different spectral power distributions is called a metamerism.|$|R
50|$|Metacity was {{the default}} window manager {{used by the}} GNOME 2 desktop {{environment}} until it was replaced by Mutter in GNOME 3. It is still used by GNOME Flashback, a session for GNOME 3 that provides <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> user <b>experience</b> to the Gnome 2.x series sessions.|$|R
25|$|The {{late 1990s}} marked the {{beginning}} of a court case between Death in June and World Serpent Distribution regarding payment and distribution issues with several other artists that were then on the label. This led to many artists that had sided with or had <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> <b>experience</b> to Pearce's leaving the distribution company and largely moving to Tesco Distribution Germany, as well as other then well established labels such as Eis & Licht.Eventually, Pearce was issued an out of court settlement for the case, which, according to him, led to the demise of World Serpent Distribution. This led to reissues of most of the major albums in the Death in June discography being made freely available, with overhauled, deluxe packaging and a considerably cheaper price.|$|E
500|$|Samuel Hubbard Scudder {{recorded}} <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> <b>experience,</b> {{first published}} in 1874 as [...] "Look at Your Fish" [...] in Every Saturday magazine. Agassiz again starts his new student off with a fish preserved in alcohol and instructs the student to [...] "look at it", and promises [...] "by and by I will ask what you have seen". As opposed to Pound's decomposing sunfish, Scudder's account emphasizes the care taken to keep the specimen in good condition: ...|$|E
500|$|The [...] "Naruto Nation" [...] campaign, a plan {{to release}} three volumes each month {{in the last four}} months of 2007, was {{announced}} by Viz Media shortly before the release of the fourteenth volume. Cammie Allen, Viz Media's product manager, commented that, [...] "Our main reason [...] was to catch up to the Japanese release schedule to give our readers <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> <b>experience</b> to that of our readers in Japan." [...] As such, the English serialization of Part II premiered on December 4, 2007, in Shonen Jump.|$|E

50|$|In late 2012, S&S Worldwide {{unveiled}} {{a new concept}} which features <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> ride <b>experience</b> without the additional rail. A system of magnets would control the individual seat inversions. The first installation of a 4D Free Spin was Batman: The Ride at Six Flags Fiesta Texas in 2015.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} 2000s, IPTV {{services}} {{began to emerge}} in some markets {{as an alternative to}} digital cable. IPTV service is typically delivered over a private, internet protocol network using a phone company's copper or fibre optic infrastructure, and offers <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> user <b>experience</b> and features to a digital cable service.|$|R
500|$|Shackleton {{was aware}} of the recent example of Wilhelm Filchner's ship, the Deutschland, which had become icebound in the same {{vicinity}} three years earlier. After Filchner's attempts to establish a land base at Vahsel Bay failed, his ship Deutschland was trapped on 6 March 1912, about [...] off the coast of Coats Land. Six months later, at latitude 63°37’, the ship broke free, then sailed to South Georgia apparently none the worse for its ordeal. Shackleton thought that <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> <b>experience</b> might allow Endurance to make a second attempt to reach Vahsel Bay in the following Antarctic spring.|$|E
500|$|Elements of the US 24th Infantry Regiment had <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> <b>experience</b> west of Sangju. On that day, the 2nd Battalion, 24th Infantry, and {{elements}} of the ROK 17th Regiment were advancing into the mountains [...] northwest of the town. There, they {{came into contact with}} the NK 48th Regiment, 15th Division, the leading element of the North Korean troops. With E Company leading, 2nd Battalion moved along the dirt road into a gorge with precipitous mountain walls. Suddenly, a North Korean light mortar and one or two automatic weapons fired on E Company. It stopped and the men dispersed along the sides of the road.|$|E
500|$|The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind was well-received by critics. It was congratulated most {{frequently}} for its breadth of scope, {{the richness of}} its visuals, and the freedom it worked into its design. Alongside the compliments, however, came criticism that the game designers had overstretched themselves, leaving glitches in various spots, and made a game too taxing to be run on an average machine, with one reviewer calling it [...] "a resource pig". In a retrospective by 1Up, the breadth and open-endedness of Morrowind is suggested to {{have contributed to the}} decline of single-player RPGs on home computers by leading customers to MMORPGs, where they could have <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> <b>experience.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The term FMS is in {{contrast}} to Fixed Mobile Convergence (FMC), which is usually used to describe the use of two different technologies (hence [...] "convergence") to deliver <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> user <b>experience.</b> Examples include the use of dual-mode handsets with both cellular and WiFi technologies and hand-off between the two.|$|R

50|$|GNOME Panel {{served as}} Fallback Mode when Mutter {{could not be}} {{executed}} until GNOME 3.8, where it was replaced with a suite of officially supported GNOME extensions named 'GNOME Classic'. Now {{it is part of}} GNOME Flashback, a session for GNOME 3 which provides <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> user <b>experience</b> to the Gnome 2.x series sessions.|$|R
500|$|Crash {{confirmed}} rumours {{that the}} game was similar to Atic Atac, but declared Sabre Wulf the better and predicted {{that they would have}} similar legacies. The magazine wrote that their inability to intuit Sabreman's current inventory or resistance to damage added to the game's mystique, and that Ultimate was particularly skilled at not giving hints but leaving sufficient clues through the game's design. Personal Computer Games found one such tip: that the indigenous enemies make a sound when aligned with an amulet piece. In <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> <b>experience,</b> Popular Computing Weekly slowly learned to use rather than avoid the orchids. CVG described the game's instructions as [...] "cryptic". Crash later reflected that comparisons to Atic Atac at its launch were unfair, similar to calling any two text adventures identical.|$|E
500|$|Computer and Video Games {{reviewer}} Kim Randell {{noted that}} [...] "Gearbox has obviously {{gone to great}} pains to provide <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> <b>experience</b> to the original". Praise was also given to the game's multiplayer; Randell stated that the new additions for multiplayer made it the area of Opposing Force that [...] "really shines". Randell closed the review by concluding that Opposing Force is [...] "an awesome achievement". Erik Wolpaw, writing for GameSpot, noted that as most expansion packs were mediocre, [...] "it's appropriate that Gearbox Software's Opposing Force, the official expansion for the genre-redefining Half-Life, in turn sets a new standard of quality for future action-game mission packs". Wolpaw praised {{the design of the}} single-player campaign, commenting that [...] "you can sense the designers' enthusiasm as one memorable scene unfolds after another, and it compels you to keep playing". Although criticizing some elements of the game's artificial intelligence and describing some of the new models as [...] "merely window dressing", the review concluded that Opposing Force was an [...] "impassioned application of creative design".|$|E
500|$|The {{incident}} of the unwelcome band playing outside Marlinspike Hall, called the [...] "Marlinspike Prize Band" [...] (Harmonie de Moulinsart {{in the original}} French version), was based on <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> <b>experience</b> of Hergé's who was also obliged to serve a band with drinks. To add insult to injury, they gave a toast to [...] "Spirou", the cartoon character created by Robert Velter. Another influence for the band was a cutting of [...] "L'Orpheon France" [...] band. Whenever Castafiore fears her jewels her stolen, her expressions, which involve placing {{her hands on her}} face, were influenced by a photograph of her model in real life, Maria Callas, taken by Cecil Beaton in 1957. In page 43 of the book, Tintin is shown reading Robert Louis Stevenson's novel Treasure Island (1883), which was also one of Hergé's favourite books. The depiction of the Romani wagons and clothing was closely modelled on photographs of Romani communities that Hergé had consulted, and he depicted members of the group engaged in basket weaving and fortune telling after reading that the Romani engaged in such activities in the Oxford English Dictionary.|$|E
5000|$|To {{compete with}} {{suburban}} shopping destinations, Norfolk city leaders {{tried to create}} <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> mall <b>experience</b> on Granby Street. The city rebranded its commercial core the [...] "Granby Street Mall", closed Granby Street to through-traffic and created a pedestrian mall. The Granby Street Mall did not succeed and the mall endured hardship through the late 1970s and early 1980s.|$|R
50|$|A third {{handheld}} title, Klonoa 2: Dream Champ Tournament, {{was released}} for the Game Boy Advance in Japan in 2002 with a heavily belated release in North America three years later. Utilizing {{the same game}} engine as Empire of Dreams, Dream Champ Tournament was <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> gaming <b>experience</b> that benefited from more sophisticated puzzles and featured a newer cast of supporting characters.|$|R
50|$|As of recent, {{researchers}} have used neuroimaging techniques {{to find that}} along with the basal ganglia, the prefrontal cortex is involved with learning exemplars, {{which is part of}} the exemplar theory, one of the three main ways our mind categorizes things. The exemplar theory states that we categorize judgements by comparing it to <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> past <b>experience</b> within our stored memories.|$|R
