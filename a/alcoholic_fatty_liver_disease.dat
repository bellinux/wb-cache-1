5000|$|Liver {{disease can}} occur through several mechanisms. A {{common form of}} liver disease is viral infection. Viral hepatitides such as Hepatitis B virus and Hepatitis C virus can be {{vertically}} transmitted during birth via contact with infected blood. According to a 2012 NICE publication, [...] "about 85% of hepatitis B infections in newborns become chronic". In occult cases, Hepatitis B virus is present by HBV DNA, but testing for HBsAg is negative. High consumption of alcohol can lead to several forms of liver disease including alcoholic hepatitis, <b>alcoholic</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>liver</b> <b>disease,</b> cirrhosis, and liver cancer. In the earlier stages of alcoholic liver disease, fat builds up in the liver's cells due to increased creation of triglycerides and fatty acids and a decreased ability to break down fatty acids. Progression of the disease can lead to liver inflammation from the excess fat in the liver. Scarring in the liver often occurs as the body attempts to heal and extensive scarring {{can lead to the}} development of cirrhosis in more advanced stages of the disease. Approximately 3-10% of individuals with cirrhosis develop a form of liver cancer known as hepatocellular carcinoma.|$|E

For this purpose, one hundred and five outpatients, matched in age and weight, were classified into two groups: the first group consisted of patients with non <b>alcoholic</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>liver</b> <b>disease</b> and the second group consisted of patients with non <b>alcoholic</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>liver</b> <b>disease</b> in conjunction with hyperglycemia due to the presence of type 2 diabetes mellitus. In all patients, lipid profile, oxidative stress, and inflammatory mediators were assessed by measuring serum concentrations of triglycerides, low density lipoprotein, hydrogen preroxide, malondialdehyde, tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin- 6, respectively. In the studied population, {{it was found that the}} presence of type 2 diabetes mellitus-induced hyperglycemia significantly impaired lipid profile, and significantly enhanced the formation of hydrogen preroxide and malondialdehyde as well as significantly increased the release of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin- 6 in the second group of patients.

Oxidative stress is now {{believed to be a}} major contributory factor in the development of non <b>alcoholic</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>liver</b> <b>disease,</b> the most common liver disorder worldwide. In this study, the changes which occur in homocysteine (Hcy) metabolism in high fat-diet induced non <b>alcoholic</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>liver</b> <b>disease</b> (NAFLD) in rats were investigated. Methods and results After feeding rats a standard low fat diet (control) or a high fat diet (57 % metabolisable energy as fat) for 18 weeks, the concentration of homocysteine in the plasma was significantly raised while that of cysteine was lowered in the high fat as compared to the control diet fed animals. The hepatic activities of cystathionine β-synthase (CBS) and cystathionine γ-lyase (CGS), the enzymes responsible for the breakdown of homocysteine to cysteine via the transsulphuration pathway in the liver, were also significantly reduced in the high fat-fed group. Conclusions These results indicate that high fat diet-induced NAFLD in rats is associated with increased plasma Hcy levels caused by down-regulation of hepatic CBS and CGL activity. Thus, HHcy occurs at an early stage in high fat diet-induced NAFLD and is likely to contribute to the increased risk of cardiovascular disease associated with the condition. </p...|$|E

Alcohol exposure reduced WAT mass and body weight in association with hepatic lipid accumulation. The plasma adiponectin concentration was increased at 2 weeks, but declined to normal at 4 and 8 weeks. Alcohol exposure suppressed leptin gene expression in WAT and reduced the plasma leptin concentration at all times measured. There is a highly positive correlation between plasma leptin concentration and WAT mass or body weight. To determine whether leptin deficiency mediates alcohol-induced hepatic lipid dyshomeostasis, mice were fed alcohol for 8 weeks with or without leptin administration for the last 2 weeks. Leptin administration normalized the plasma leptin concentration and reversed alcoholic fatty liver. Alcohol-perturbed genes involved in fatty acid β-oxidation, very low-density lipoprotein secretion, and transcriptional regulation were attenuated by leptin.

Replenishment of recombinant adiponectin in mice can decrease hyperglycemia, reverse insulin resistance, and cause sustained weight loss without affecting food intake. Here we report its potential roles in <b>alcoholic</b> and nonalcoholic <b>fatty</b> <b>liver</b> <b>diseases</b> in mice. Circulating concentrations of adiponectin decreased significantly following chronic consumption of high-fat ethanol-containing food. Delivery of recombinant adiponectin into these mice dramatically alleviated hepatomegaly and steatosis (<b>fatty</b> <b>liver)</b> and also significantly attenuated inflammation and the elevated levels of serum alanine aminotransferase. These therapeutic effects resulted partly from the ability of adiponectin to increase carnitine palmitoyltransferase I activity and enhance hepatic fatty acid oxidation, while it decreased the activities of two key enzymes involved in fatty acid synthesis, including acetyl-CoA carboxylase and fatty acid synthase. Furthermore, adiponectin treatment could suppress the hepatic production of TNF-α and plasma concentrations of this proinflammatory cytokine. Adiponectin was also effective in ameliorating hepatomegaly, steatosis, and alanine aminotransferase abnormality associated with nonalcoholic obese, ob/ob mice.

Triiodothyronine (T 3) {{is the most}} biologically active TH form. Thyroid hormone receptors (TRs) belong to the nuclear receptor superfamily andmediate the biological functions of T 3 via transcriptional regulation. TRs generally form heterodimers with the retinoid X receptor (RXR) and regulate target genes upon T 3 stimulation. Research {{over the past few}} decades has revealed that disruption of cellular TH signaling triggers chronic <b>liver</b> <b>diseases,</b> including <b>alcoholic</b> or nonalcoholic <b>fatty</b> <b>liver</b> <b>disease</b> and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Animal model experiments and epidemiologic studies to date imply close associations between high TH levels and prevention of <b>liver</b> <b>disease.</b> Moreover, several investigations spanning four decades have reported the therapeutic potential of T 3 analogs in lowering lipids, preventing chronic <b>liver</b> <b>disease,</b> and as anticancer agents. Thus, elucidating downstream genes/signaling pathways and molecular mechanisms of TH actions is critical for the treatment of significant public health issues. Here, we have reviewed recent studies focusing on the roles of THs and TRs in several disorders, in particular, <b>liver</b> <b>diseases.</b> We also discuss the potential therapeutic applications of THs and underlying molecular mechanisms...|$|R

It is well-established that mitochondrial functions are suppressed when living cells or organisms are exposed to potentially toxic agents including alcohol, high fat diets, smoking and certain drugs or in many pathophysiological states through increased levels of oxidative/nitrative stress. Under elevated nitroxidative stress, cellular macromolecules proteins, DNA, and lipids can undergo different oxidative modifications, leading to disruption of their normal, sometimes critical, physiological functions. Recent reports also indicated that many mitochondrial proteins are modified via various post-translation modifications (PTMs) and primarily inactivated. Because of the recently-emerging information, in this review, we specifically focus on the mechanisms and roles of five major PTMs (namely oxidation, nitration, phosphorylation, acetylation, and adduct formation with lipid-peroxides, reactive metabolites, or advanced glycation end products) in experimental models of <b>alcoholic</b> and nonalcoholic <b>fatty</b> <b>liver</b> <b>disease</b> as well as acute hepatic injury caused by toxic compounds. We also highlight the role of the ethanol-inducible cytochrome P 450 - 2 E 1 (CYP 2 E 1) in some of these PTM changes. Finally, we discuss translational research opportunities with natural and/or synthetic anti-oxidants, which can prevent or delay the onset of mitochondrial dysfunction, fat accumulation and tissue injury...|$|R
