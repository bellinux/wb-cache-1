5|$|The {{synthesis}} of the heavy isotopes 294Lv and 295Lv could be accomplished by fusing the heavy curium isotope curium-250 with calcium-48. The cross section of this nuclear reaction would be about 1picobarn, {{though it is not}} yet possible to produce 250Cm in the quantities needed for target manufacture. After a few alpha decays, these livermorium isotopes would reach nuclides at the line of beta stability. Additionally, electron capture may also become an important decay mode in this region, allowing affected nuclei to reach the middle of the island. For example, 295Lv would alpha decay to 291Fl, which would undergo successive electron capture to 291Nh and then 291Cn which is expected {{to be in the middle}} of the island of stability and have a half-life of about 1200years, affording the most likely hope of reaching the middle of the island using current technology. <b>A</b> <b>drawback</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the decay properties of superheavy nuclei this close to the line of beta stability are largely unexplored.|$|E
25|$|In contrast, normal {{order is}} so called {{because it always}} finds a {{normalising}} reduction, if one exists. In the above example, KIΩ reduces under normal order to I, a normal form. <b>A</b> <b>drawback</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> redexes in the arguments may be copied, resulting in duplicated computation (for example, (λx.xx) ((λx.x)y) reduces to ((λx.x)y) ((λx.x)y) using this strategy; now there are two redexes, so full evaluation needs two more steps, but if the argument had been reduced first, there would now be none).|$|E
25|$|Casting {{and then}} {{machining}} plutonium is difficult {{not only because}} of its toxicity, but also because plutonium has many different metallic phases. As plutonium cools, changes in phase result in distortion and cracking. This distortion is normally overcome by alloying it with 30-35 mMol (0.9–1.0% by weight) gallium, forming a plutonium-gallium alloy, which causes it to take up its delta phase over a wide temperature range. When cooling from molten it then has only a single phase change, from epsilon to delta, instead of the four changes it would otherwise pass through. Other trivalent metals would also work, but gallium has a small neutron absorption cross section and helps protect the plutonium against corrosion. <b>A</b> <b>drawback</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> gallium compounds are corrosive and so if the plutonium is recovered from dismantled weapons for conversion to plutonium dioxide for power reactors, there is the difficulty of removing the gallium.|$|E

5000|$|The 1984 Orca EDGE was {{an early}} example of a dive computer. Designed by Craig Barshinger Karl Huggins and Paul Heinmiller, the EDGE did not display a {{decompression}} plan, but instead the EDGE showed the ceiling or the so-called [...] "safe-ascent-depth". <b>A</b> <b>drawback</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> if the diver was faced by a ceiling, {{he did not know}} how long he would have to decompress. The EDGE's large, unique display, however, featuring 12 tissue bars permitted an experienced user to make a reasonable estimate of his or her decompression obligation.|$|R
2500|$|Continuous glucose monitor {{systems can}} {{consist of a}} {{disposable}} sensor placed under the skin, a transmitter connected to the sensor and a reader that receives and displays the measurements.

2500|$|The oratorio Saint Ludmila was a {{huge success}} in Bohemia and Moravia, sung at events in Dvořák's honor in 1901 and 1904.

50|$|The system {{components}} were expensive, which precluded installation in smaller trucks and cars. <b>A</b> <b>drawback</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the power motors were not efficient enough at part load. Focus switched to smaller vehicles. A British company made a breakthrough by introducing an electronically controlled hydraulic motor/pump <b>that</b> <b>is</b> efficient at all ranges and loads, making small applications of petro-hydraulic hybrids feasible. The company converted a BMW car to prove viability. The BMW 530i gave double the MPG in city driving {{compared to the}} standard car. The test used the standard 3,000 cc engine. Petro-hydraulic hybrids allows downsizing an engine to average power usage, not peak power usage. Peak power {{is provided by the}} energy stored in the accumulator.|$|R
5000|$|Perhaps {{the most}} unusual {{variation}} of the durable Pontiac V8 was a 194.4 inline four created from the right bank of the 389 for the debut of the Tempest in 1961. With an identical bore and stroke of [...] in (103.2 mm) and [...] in (95.2 mm) it was precisely half the displacement of the 389. Nicknamed the [...] "INDY 4", it shared most of the 389's tooling and up to 120 of its parts. This degree of commonality enabled it to be produced on the same lines as the V8, allowing substantial cost savings. <b>A</b> <b>drawback</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the 195 weighed {{much more than a}} purpose-designed inline-4: at about 540 lb, it was exceptionally heavy for any form of four-cylinder.|$|R
50|$|This heat is an {{advantage}} of this approach, so the used materials are not exposed to high temperatures and allow rapid cooling. <b>A</b> <b>drawback</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> this approach is not applicable for bond frame dimensions of few ten micrometres.

50|$|This process generates one {{new face}} at each {{original}} vertex, n new faces along each original edge, and n2 new faces at each original face.

50|$|<b>A</b> <b>drawback</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> due to oil's lower density, in {{event of}} {{underpressure}} in the reaction vessel, enough oil may be sucked through the sump into the inert gas system to contaminate it.

40|$|An {{augmented}} Lagrangian (AL) {{can convert}} a constrained optimization problem into {{a sequence of}} simpler (e. g., unconstrained) problems, which are then usually solved with local solvers. Recently, surrogate-based Bayesian optimization (BO) sub-solvers have been successfully deployed in the AL framework for a more global search {{in the presence of}} inequality constraints; however, <b>a</b> <b>drawback</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> expected improvement (EI) evaluations relied on Monte Carlo. Here we introduce an alternative slack variable AL, and show that in this formulation the EI may be evaluated with library routines. The slack variables furthermore facilitate equality as well as inequality constraints, and mixtures thereof. We show how our new slack "ALBO" compares favorably to the original. Its superiority over conventional alternatives is reinforced on several mixed constraint examples. Comment: 24 pages, 5 figure...|$|R
50|$|The {{challenging}} {{production schedule}} meant that flight {{tests of the}} DH.88 commenced just six weeks {{prior to the start}} of the race. During testing, the propeller blade roots were found to interfere unacceptably with the airflow into the engine. Instead, a two-position variable pitch type, manufactured by French manufacturer Ratier, was substituted. These blades were manually set to fine pitch before takeoff using a bicycle pump, and in flight they were repositioned automatically to coarse (high-speed) pitch by a pressure sensor. <b>A</b> <b>drawback</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the propellers could not be reset to fine pitch except on the ground. Other changes included the installation of a large landing light fitted in the nose and a revised, higher profile to the cockpit to give the pilot marginally less restricted visibility.|$|R
50|$|<b>A</b> <b>drawback</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{these types}} of {{assessment}} take time. However, strategies like peer review, interactive games or simulations, and self-administered tests might help in fragmenting assessment processes, while still providing essential feedback to the learner along the way. Also, as markers or benchmarks of learning, {{it is possible that}} digital badges might work particularly well for individuals who are stressed by testing, and for educators looking for mechanisms to accommodate differentiated learning pathways.|$|E

5|$|Flux-cored wire is {{considered}} to have some advantages for outdoor welding on-site, as the shielding gas plume {{is less likely to}} be blown away in a wind than shield gas from a conventional nozzle. <b>A</b> slight <b>drawback</b> <b>is</b> <b>that,</b> like SMAW (stick) welding, there may be some flux deposited over the weld bead, requiring more of a cleaning process between passes.|$|R
50|$|Research on a cleaner, less {{energy-intensive}} lead {{extraction process}} continues; <b>a</b> major <b>drawback</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> either too much lead is lost as waste, or the alternatives {{result in a}} high sulfur content in the resulting lead metal. Hydrometallurgical extraction, in which anodes of impure lead are immersed into an electrolyte and pure lead is deposited onto a cathode, <b>is</b> technique <b>that</b> may have potential.|$|R
50|$|<b>A</b> second <b>drawback</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{the roots}} tend to grow together, meaning removal of {{harvested}} or damaged plants can be somewhat problematic in plants having well-developed root systems. Commercial crops harvested {{at one time}} are somewhat immune to concerns related to that aspect of the system, but {{in the event of}} pathogenic invasion the problem can quickly spread, as all the roots share the same flood source.|$|R
5000|$|There {{are three}} {{installation}} methods: ballasted, mechanically attached, and fully adhered. Ballasted roofs {{are held in}} place by large round stones or slabs. Mechanically attached roof membranes are held in place with nails and are suitable in some applications where wind velocities are not usually high. <b>A</b> <b>drawback</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the nails penetrate the waterproof membrane; if correctly fastened the membrane is [...] "self-gasketing" [...] and will not leak. Fully adhered installation methods prove to give the longest performance of the three methods.|$|E

50|$|Vacuum {{concrete}}, made {{by using}} steam {{to produce a}} vacuum inside a concrete mixing truck to release air bubbles inside the concrete, is being researched. The {{idea is that the}} steam displaces the air normally over the concrete. When the steam condenses into water it will create a low pressure over the concrete that will pull air from the concrete. This will make the concrete stronger due to there being less air in the mixture. <b>A</b> <b>drawback</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the mixing has to be done in an airtight container.|$|E
5000|$|Another type is a locking nut. This nut—usually used in {{conjunction}} with a locking vibrato system such as a Floyd Rose or Kahler—clamps the strings against the nut. This improves tuning stability when using the vibrato bar. <b>A</b> <b>drawback</b> however, <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the locking nut must be loosened using an Allen wrench to tune outside the range of the fine tuners on the bridge (if present).|$|R
50|$|As for {{rational}} numbers, ternary {{offers a}} convenient way to represent 1/3 (as opposed to its cumbersome representation as an infinite string of recurring digits in decimal); but <b>a</b> major <b>drawback</b> <b>is</b> <b>that,</b> in turn, ternary {{does not offer}} a finite representation for 1/2 (neither for 1/4, 1/8, etc.), because 2 is not a prime factor of the base; as with base-2, 1/10 is not representable exactly (that would need e.g. base-10); nor is 1/6.|$|R
50|$|The KCRC also {{proposed}} adding Causeway Bay North Station {{as part of}} the Sha Tin to Central Link (SCL), to be situated between Exhibition Station and Hung Hom Station. However, <b>a</b> major <b>drawback</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> road traffic would be severely impacted, as this would involve closing Gloucester Road for 5 years. Eventually, this station was eliminated from the SCL plan altogether after the MTR-KCR merger, and will only be part of the NIL if it is constructed.|$|R
50|$|Family {{planning}} in China had its benefits, and its drawbacks. For example, it helped reduce the population by about 300 {{million people in}} its first 20 years. <b>A</b> <b>drawback</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> there are now millions of sibling-fewer people, and in China siblings are very important. Once the parent generation gets older, the children help take care of them, and the work is usually equally split among the siblings.

5000|$|It is used {{to match}} the {{refractive}} index of PMMA for example in confocal microscopy of colloids. A mixture of cis-decalin and CXB can simultaneously match optical index and density of PMMA. Due to the moderate dielectric constant of CXB (ε = 7.9 [...] ), PMMA acquires charges that can be screened {{by the addition of}} salt (e.g. tetrabutyl ammonium bromide), leading to a very good approximation of colloidal hard sphere. <b>A</b> <b>drawback</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> CXB is a good solvent for PMMA, causing it to swell over time, which may lead to a poor determination of particle radii and determination of solid volume fraction.|$|E
50|$|The most {{significant}} changes {{occurred in the}} pelvic region, where the long downward facing iliac blade was shortened and widened as a requirement for keeping {{the center of gravity}} stable while walking; bipedal hominids have a shorter but broader, bowl-like pelvis due to this. <b>A</b> <b>drawback</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the birth canal of bipedal apes is smaller than in knuckle-walking apes, though there has been a widening of it in comparison to that of australopithecine and modern humans, permitting the passage of newborns due to the increase in cranial size but this is limited to the upper portion, since further increase can hinder normal bipedal movement.|$|E
50|$|The second {{approach}} is conventional databases such as Oracle. These databases {{are capable of}} enabling easy search and access of data. However, <b>a</b> great <b>drawback</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> huge effort for preparing and modeling the data is required. For large-scale projects, huge monetary costs are induced, and extra IT human resources must be employed for constant handling, expanding and maintaining the inflexible system, which is custom for specific tasks, instead of all tasks. In the long-term, it is not cost-effective.|$|R
50|$|Research is {{underway}} in large corporations and small companies. Focus has now switched to smaller vehicles. The system components were expensive which precluded installation in smaller trucks and cars. <b>A</b> <b>drawback</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the power driving motors were not efficient enough at part load.

50|$|Tiltrotors {{also provide}} {{substantially}} greater cruise altitude capability than helicopters. Tiltrotors can easily reach 6,000 m / 20,000 ft or more whereas helicopters typically do not exceed 3,000 m / 10,000 ft altitude. This feature {{will mean that}} some uses <b>that</b> have <b>been</b> commonly considered only for fixed-wing aircraft can now be supported with tiltrotors without need of <b>a</b> runway. <b>A</b> <b>drawback</b> however <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> tiltrotor suffers considerably reduced payload when taking off from high altitude.|$|R
