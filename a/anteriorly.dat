5|$|Caudal scutes {{have been}} {{preserved}} on struthiosaurines. The osteoderms are compressed inwards from the side, have a slope positioned <b>anteriorly,</b> and a square-shaped posterior edge.|$|E
5|$|The head is flattened, triangular, and {{distinct}} from the neck. The snout is blunt, rounded, and raised. The nostrils are large, each {{in the middle of}} a large, single nasal scale. The lower edge of the nasal touches the nasorostral. The supranasal has a strong crescent shape and separates the nasal from the nasorostral <b>anteriorly.</b> The rostral is as broad as it is high.|$|E
5|$|A broad muzzle {{is found}} on the river otter's flat head, and the ears are round and inconspicuous. The rhinarium is bare, with an obtuse, {{triangular}} projection. Eyes of the animal are small and placed <b>anteriorly.</b> A short, broad rostrum for exhaling and a long, broad cranium define the relatively flat skull. The river otter's nostrils and ears close during submersion, inhibiting water from entering them. Its vibrissae (whiskers) are long and thick, enhancing sensory perception underwater and on land.|$|E
5|$|Baleen whales {{have two}} {{flippers}} on the front, near the head. Like all mammals, baleen whales breathe air and must surface periodically to do so. Their nostrils, or blowholes, are {{situated at the}} top of the cranium. Baleen whales have two blowholes, as opposed to toothed whales which have one. These paired blowholes are longitudinal slits that converge <b>anteriorly</b> and widen posteriorly, which causes a V-shaped blow. They are surrounded by a fleshy ridge that keeps water away while the whale breathes. The septum that separates the blowholes has two plugs attached to it, making the blowholes water-tight while the whale dives.|$|E
5|$|The third {{axillary}} sclerite (3Ax) lies in {{the posterior}} part of the articular region of the wing. Its form is highly variable and often irregular, but the third axillary is the sclerite on which is inserted the flexor muscle of the wing (D). Mesally it articulates <b>anteriorly</b> (f) with the posterior {{end of the second}} axillary, and posteriorly (b) with the posterior wing process of the tergum (PNP), or with a small fourth axillary when the latter is present. Distally the third axillary is prolonged in a process which is always associated with the bases of the group of veins in the anal region of the wing here termed the vannal veins (V). The third axillary, therefore, is usually the posterior hinge plate of the wing base and is the active sclerite of the flexor mechanism, which directly manipulates the vannal veins. The contraction of the flexor muscle (D) revolves the third axillary on its mesal articulations (b, f) and thereby lifts its distal arm; this movement produces the flexion of the wing. The Fourth Axillary sclerite is not a constant element of the wing base. When present it is usually a small plate intervening between the third axillary and the posterior notal wing process and is probably a detached piece of the latter.|$|E
5|$|Z. ferox is {{only known}} from small, {{wingless}} females. The head {{is similar to}} those of queens of Z. tonsora, but they can be separated by the lack of ocelli and rugose patches found on the vertex. Only a single row of denticles is present, and the vertexal margin (seen posterodorsally) is concave. The mesosoma is smooth and contains a single spine, fovea (a pit or depression in a structure) or carina (a keel-like elevation on the body-wall of an insect). The posterior portion of the propodeal surface is concave; it is high and strongly angled. All legs have flattened femurs (the largest region of an insect's leg) and tibiae, and the tibiae are carinated both <b>anteriorly</b> and posteriorly. The gaster (the bulbous posterior portion of the metasoma) has five known segments. Like the queen, Z. ferox has a large, retractable stinger, in which the external part is enclosed by the gonostyli (sting sheaths).|$|E
5|$|In 1916, Brown {{expanded}} the character set {{to include more}} features; in the revised version: a comparatively short skull with a high helmet-like crest formed by nasals, prefrontals and frontals; the nasals not being separated in front by premaxillaries; a narrow beak, expanded section {{in front of the}} elongated nares; a small narial opening; a vertebral formula of 15 cervicals, 19 dorsals, 8 sacrals, and 61+ caudals; possession of dorsal spines of a medium height; high anterior caudal spines; long chevrons; long scapulae, possessing a blade of medium width; a radius considerably longer than humerus; comparatively short metacarpals; an <b>anteriorly</b> decurved ilium; a long ischium with a foot-like terminal expansion; a pubis with an anterior blade that is short and broadly expanded at end; a femur that is longer than the tibia; the phalanges of pes are short; that the integument over the sides and tail composed of polygonal tuberculate scales without pattern but graded in size {{in different parts of the}} body; and a belly with longitudinal rows of large conical limpet-like scales separated by uniformly large polygonal tubercles. Again, the presumed traits of the snout are incorrect because Brown confused the praemaxillae with the nasal bones and the nasal bones with the frontals. Most of the postcranial traits are today known to be shared with other lambeosaurines.|$|E
25|$|Anal grooves: Rounded <b>anteriorly,</b> curving behind anus {{to meet in}} a {{somewhat}} elongate point.|$|E
25|$|Spiracular plate: Elongate, oval, narrow posteriorly, {{the longer}} axis {{directed}} <b>anteriorly,</b> about 0.50- 0.53mm in length.|$|E
25|$|The surgeon {{then makes}} two (2) {{parallel}} incisions {{along the floor}} and the roof of the nasal septum; the incisions converge <b>anteriorly,</b> towards the front of the nasal spine.|$|E
25|$|The surgeon {{cuts the}} <b>anteriorly</b> based septal mucosal tissue-flap as widely as possible, and then {{releases}} {{it with a}} low, posterior back-cut; but only as required to allow {{the rotation of the}} tissue-flap into the nasal wound.|$|E
25|$|A nasal-tip lining defect is unusual, {{because of}} its midline location; yet, the {{reconstruction}} is with an <b>anteriorly</b> based septal mucosal flap that is rotated into place to provide adequate coverage and correction of the nasal lining defect.|$|E
25|$|Fractures of the mandibular {{body are}} defined as those that involve a region bounded <b>anteriorly</b> by the parasymphysis (defined as a {{vertical}} line just distal to the canine tooth) and posteriorly by the anterior border of the masseter muscle.|$|E
25|$|The two hip {{bones are}} joined <b>anteriorly</b> at the pubic {{symphysis}} by a fibrous cartilage {{covered by a}} hyaline cartilage, the interpubic disk, within which a non-synovial cavity might be present. Two ligaments, the superior and inferior pubic ligaments, reinforce the symphysis.|$|E
25|$|The tendons of the {{extensor}} pollicis longus and extensor pollicis brevis form what {{is known}} as the anatomical snuff box (an indentation on the lateral aspect of the thumb at its base) The radial artery can be palpated <b>anteriorly</b> at the wrist(not in the snuffbox).|$|E
25|$|Antennae black, {{head and}} thorax black spotted with ochraceous and white; abdomen <b>anteriorly</b> black, posteriorly ochraceous yellow with narrow {{transverse}} black lines; beneath, the palpi, thorax and abdomen ochraceous, the thorax spotted with ochraceous, the abdomen with a longitudinal line of black at base.|$|E
25|$|Although the forelimbs of D. schrani {{are longer}} {{than in any}} other {{previously}} known titanosaur, they are not significantly longer than the hind limbs. Therefore, Lacovara et al. (2014) reconstructed its neck to have been held more horizontally, rather than <b>anteriorly</b> inclined in the manner of Brachiosaurus.|$|E
25|$|Gleizes' {{method was}} {{fundamentally}} synthetic. Although the landscape seems persuasively realistic (with its foreground, background and village in between), {{it is not}} an existing place somewhere between Paris and his studio at Courbevoie, consistent with Gleizes' method of bringing together various elements from different locations <b>anteriorly</b> observed in nature.|$|E
25|$|Similarly, a posterior-anterior {{distinction}} {{was found}} with more complex or abstract reinforcers (such as monetary gain and loss) being represented more <b>anteriorly</b> in the orbitofrontal cortex than less-complex reinforcers such as taste. It has even been proposed that the human OFC has a role in mediating subjective hedonic experience.|$|E
25|$|Scutum: Oval, convex, only {{a little}} smaller than body. Lateral grooves deep and {{completely}} encircling the scutum, <b>anteriorly</b> somewhat linear and may simulate mild lateral carinae. Punctations fine, usually most numerous submarginally and anteromedianly; pseudoscutum sometimes faintly apparent. Cervical grooves, short, shallow. Emargination moderate. Scapulae blunt.|$|E
25|$|The {{bar jack}} is a {{moderately}} large species, growing to a recorded maximum length of 69cm, and a weight of 6.8kg, but is commonly encountered at lengths {{of less than}} 40cm. The bar jack displays the typical body shape {{of most of the}} jacks, having an elongate, moderately deep and compressed form, with dorsal and ventral profiles of approximately equal ity. The dorsal fin is divided into two sections, the first consisting of 8 spines while the second has 1 spine followed by 26 to 30 soft rays. The anal fin is composed of 2 <b>anteriorly</b> detached spines followed by 1 spine and 23 to 26 soft rays, with both the anal and soft dorsal fin lobes being slightly elongated. The pectoral fins are falcate and longer than the head, consisting of 19 to 21 soft rays. The lateral line is moderately arched <b>anteriorly,</b> and possesses 17 to 104 scales including 23 to 29 scutes posteriorly; also having bilateral paired caudal keels present. The chest is completely scaled, which easily distinguishes it from the similar crevalle jack, Caranx hippos. The snout is moderately pointed, with both the jaws containing narrow bands of villiform teeth, with the bands becoming wider <b>anteriorly.</b> The upper jaw also contains an outer row of enlarged recurved teeth. There are 10 to 14 upper limb gill rakers, and 31 to 38 on the lower limb and 24 vertebrae.|$|E
25|$|The lumbar {{curve is}} more marked {{in the female}} than in the male; it begins at {{the middle of the}} last {{thoracic}} vertebra, and ends at the sacrovertebral angle. It is convex <b>anteriorly,</b> the convexity of the lower three vertebrae being much greater than that of the upper two. This curve is described as a lordotic curve.|$|E
25|$|In {{birds and}} crocodilians, the stomach {{is divided into}} two regions. <b>Anteriorly</b> is a narrow tubular region, the proventriculus, lined by fundic glands, and {{connecting}} the true stomach to the crop. Beyond lies the powerful muscular gizzard, lined by pyloric glands, and, in some species, containing stones that the animal swallows to help grind up food.|$|E
25|$|The {{pertinent}} nasal {{lymphatic system}} {{arises from the}} superficial mucosa, and drains posteriorly to the retropharyngeal nodes (in back), and <b>anteriorly</b> (in front), either to the upper deep cervical nodes (in the neck), or to the submandibular glands (in the lower jaw), or into both the nodes and the glands of the neck and the jaw.|$|E
25|$|It {{differs from}} Graphium antiphates chiefly {{in the greater}} width of the black {{markings}} on the upperside, especially of the basal and subbasal bands that cross the forewing, both of which also extend to the dorsum. On the hindwing the black markings of the underside on the basal and discal areas are not only seen by transparency from below, but are actually represented, though only partially, by black scaling; {{the width of the}} dark grey terminal portion is also greater, and it has a tendency to turn to dusky black <b>anteriorly,</b> so that the sub-terminal series of black lunules are obscured <b>anteriorly</b> and are difficult to make out. Underside: markings {{similar to those of the}} typical form, but broader; forewing with the discal transverse band that reaches from costa to vein 1; hindwing: the black bands that cross the cell broader and proportionately closer together.|$|E
25|$|Just like modern archosaurs with tails (for example crocodilians), D. schrani had bones {{below the}} {{vertebrae}} called chevrons or haemel arches. These bones {{connect with the}} ventral surface of the vertebrae and are “Y” shaped when viewed <b>anteriorly.</b> In Dreadnoughtus schrani the bottom stem of the “Y” is broadly expanded, likely for the attachment of muscles.|$|E
25|$|The pelvic {{region of}} the trunk {{includes}} the bony pelvis, the pelvic cavity (the space enclosed by the bony pelvis), the pelvic floor, below the pelvic cavity, and the perineum, below the pelvic floor. The pelvic skeleton is formed {{in the area of}} the back, by the sacrum and the coccyx and <b>anteriorly</b> and to the left and right sides, by a pair of hip bones.|$|E
25|$|Sarcophagidae larvae {{are white}} or pale yellow, cylindrical, and tapered <b>anteriorly.</b> All {{segments}} beyond the first have anterior and posterior bands of hairs. The mandibles are usually strong and curved, resembling a hook. Posterior spiracles are sunken in, {{which is a}} characteristic {{that can be used}} to distinguish between flesh fly and blow fly larvae. Larvae are most often found in decaying animal matter.|$|E
25|$|The septal mucosal tissue flap is the {{indicated}} technique for correcting defects of the distal {{half of the}} nose, and for correcting almost every type of large defect of the mucosal lining of the nose. The septal mucosal tissue flap, which is an <b>anteriorly</b> based pedicle-graft supplied with blood by the septal branch of the superior labial artery. To perform such a nasal correction, the entire septal mucoperichondrium can be harvested.|$|E
25|$|Hindwing: the {{markings}} also {{similar to those}} on the upperside, but the terminal margin beyond the subterminal series of white markings bears a row of comparatively large very conspicuous yellow spots, separated from the white lunules {{by a series of}} short transverse detached spots of the ground colour. Antennae, head, thorax and abdomen black, the thorax <b>anteriorly</b> and beneath and the abdomen on the sides spotted with white.|$|E
25|$|This {{consists}} of motor neuron axons that branch {{out to the}} muscles from the ganglia of the central nervous system, parts of the sympathetic nervous system and the sensory neurons of the cuticular sense organs that receive chemical, thermal, mechanical or visual stimuli from the insects environment. The sympathetic nervous system includes nerves and the ganglia that innervate the gut both posteriorly and <b>anteriorly,</b> some endocrine organs, the spiracles of the tracheal system and the reproductive organs.|$|E
25|$|Oscar Tiegs thus {{showed that}} the {{characteristic}} of being opisthogoneate, that is with posterior genital openings, and the characteristic of progoneate, that is with the genital opening differently placed, <b>anteriorly,</b> are not dichotomous, and thus reduced {{the significance of the}} until then corresponding major classificatory zoological division. He proposed a new classification scheme based on head structure, this being supported by later work by others regarding antennal muscles, and locomotive behaviour and machinery in the relevant animals.|$|E
25|$|It is {{inferred}} {{that the}} gills of Bothriolepis {{are of the}} primitive type, though their structure is still not well understood. Laterally, they are enclosed by an opercular fold and {{are found in the}} space beneath the lateral part of the head shield, extending medially underneath the neurocranium. Compared to the gills of normally-shaped fish, the gill region of Bothriolepis is considered to be placed more dorsally, is <b>anteriorly</b> more crowded and, in general, is relatively short and broad.|$|E
25|$|Unusual among crocodyliforms, Sebecus has a deep, narrow snout. The nares, or nostrils, open <b>anteriorly</b> {{at the tip}} of the snout. While most {{crocodilians}} have flat skulls {{that are}} raised near the eyes and postorbital region behind the eyes, the skull of Sebecus is essentially level. The great depth of the snout makes most of the length of its upper margin level with the margin of the orbits, or eye sockets. The supratemporal fenestrae, two holes on the skull table, are relatively small.|$|E
25|$|The two hip bones {{connect the}} spine {{with the lower}} limbs. They are {{attached}} to the sacrum posteriorly, connected to each other <b>anteriorly,</b> and joined with the two femurs at the hip joints. The gap enclosed by the bony pelvis, called the pelvic cavity, is the section of the body underneath the abdomen and mainly consists of the reproductive organs (sex organs) and the rectum, while the pelvic floor {{at the base of the}} cavity assists in supporting the organs of the abdomen.|$|E
25|$|The larvae of both C. macellaria and C. hominivorax have {{cylindrical}} bodies tapering <b>anteriorly</b> with 10 or {{more robust}} spines around the spiracular area, incomplete peritremes, an indistinct or absent button, and bands of small spines on each segment. The C. hominivorax larvae have distinctly pigmented tracheal trunks. C. macellaria larvae {{do not have}} pigmented tracheal trunks; they have spines in a V shape on the anal protuberance and no oral sclerite. The mature third instars of both species' larvae can reach a length of 17mm.|$|E
