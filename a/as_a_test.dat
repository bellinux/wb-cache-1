5|$|In retirement, Brown briefly served <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>Test</b> {{selector}} {{and sold}} cars and, later, sports goods.

5|$|Two {{months after}} {{receiving}} his law degree, Haynes entered the United States Army as a flying cadet on August 15, 1917. From August to November 1917, {{he attended the}} School of Military Aeronautics at Georgia Polytechnic Institute, after which he sailed for France. He served at Saint-Maixent-l'École until the following March and then entered the Machine Gun School at Gondrecourt-le-Château. In May 1918, he was commissioned a temporary second lieutenant in the Air Service, and sent to Tours <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>test</b> pilot. In July of that year, he became an instructor at the Second Aviation Instructor Center at Issoudun and the following September was transferred to Orly <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>test</b> pilot. After the Armistice in November 1918, he served as an aide to President Woodrow Wilson during the Paris Peace Conference.|$|E
5|$|All four {{launches}} {{were conducted}} from Launch Area 5B at the Woomera Prohibited Area in Australia, which {{had previously been}} used <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>test</b> site for the Black Knight rocket. During the development programme, launch sites in Barbados, Uist and Norfolk were also considered. The launch sites at Uist and Norfolk were rejected because the former was too remote, while there was a risk that a rocket launched from the latter might drop spent stages on an oil rig in the North Sea.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the venom}} {{of a few}} spider and {{scorpion}} species can be very dangerous to humans, medical researchers are investigating {{the use of these}} venoms for the treatment of disorders ranging from cancer to erectile dysfunction. The medical industry also uses the blood of horseshoe crabs <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>test</b> for the presence of contaminant bacteria. Mites can cause allergies in humans, transmit several diseases to humans and their livestock, and are serious agricultural pests.|$|E
5|$|For the {{remainder}} of his career Braham flew around the World. But, in 1968, Canadian policy pointed to the amalgamation of all the Canadian armed forces into one unified service. Worse still, the cancellation of the Avro Canada CF-105 Arrow put an end to Canada's plan to build their own fighters which curbed Braham's ambitions <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>test</b> pilot. He resigned from the RCAF in January 1968 and settled in Nova Scotia with his wife and three sons. He had flown 5,370 hours in 66 types of aircraft with the RCAF.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, Audrey Tang {{created the}} Pugs project, an {{implementation}} of Perl 6 in Haskell. This acted as, {{and continues to}} act <b>as,</b> <b>a</b> <b>test</b> platform for the Perl 6 language (separate from {{the development of the}} actual implementation)allowing the language designers to explore. The Pugs project spawned an active Perl/Haskell cross-language community centered around the freenode #perl6 IRC channel. Many functional programming influences were absorbed by the Perl 6 design team.|$|E

5|$|In August 1955, Grissom was {{reassigned to}} the U.S. Air Force Institute of Technology located in Dayton, Ohio.

In October 1956, he entered USAF Test Pilot School at Edwards Air Force Base, California, and returned to Wright-Patterson AFB in May 1957 <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>test</b> pilot assigned to the fighter branch.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the planned role as a tender for torpedo boats, she was also intended to serve <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>test</b> platform for the new self-propelled torpedo. Up to the mid-1870s, the German navy had only experimented {{with a handful of}} torpedo ships, all of which were equipped with the old spar torpedo. The ship's design provided the basis for both later German avisosthe and all subsequent light cruisers, but also to numerous foreign designs, such as several classes of French, Italian, and Austrian avisos and torpedo craft.|$|E
5|$|In addition, Mermaid {{signaled}} the re-establishment {{of the musical}} film format as a standard for Disney animated films. The majority of Disney's most popular animated films from the 1930s on had been musicals, though by the 1970s and 1980s the role of music had been de-emphasized in the films. 1988's Oliver & Company had served <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>test</b> of sorts {{to the success of}} the musical format before Disney committed to the Broadway-style structure of The Little Mermaid.|$|E

5|$|In each of {{the cases}} above, the actual score is irrelevant; the {{projectiles}} simply have to hit the target sheet within the circles. Also in each case, the applicant is allowed 3 test shots to familiarize with the particular firearm used for the test.

5|$|In general relativity, the apsides of any orbit (the {{point of}} the {{orbiting}} body's closest approach to the system's center of mass) will precess—the orbit is not an ellipse, but akin to an ellipse that rotates on its focus, resulting in a rose curve-like shape (see image). Einstein first derived this result by using an approximate metric representing the Newtonian limit and treating the orbiting body <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>test</b> particle. For him, {{the fact that his}} theory gave a straightforward explanation of Mercury's anomalous perihelion shift, discovered earlier by Urbain Le Verrier in 1859, was important evidence that he had at last identified the correct form of the gravitational field equations.|$|E
5|$|In {{the ensuing}} ODIs, Gilchrist scored only 97 runs at 16.16. The Australian {{selectors}} sought to accommodate Hayden, {{who had been}} successful <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>Test</b> opener, into the ODI team by rotating him with Gilchrist and Waugh, but this appeared to unsettle the team. With a newly fragile top-order, Australia failed {{to qualify for the}} finals, and the Waugh brothers were dropped from the team, ending Gilchrist's four-year partnership with Mark. Ricky Ponting was promoted to the captaincy ahead of vice captain Gilchrist.|$|E

During the Microsoft Press Conference at E3 2011, Ryse was announced as a Kinect-only title. The announcement entailed a prerendered trailer with minor gameplay footage. The gameplay footage featured players using their own body gestures to control the protagonist to fight against enemies, and perform actions like sword wielding, blocking attacks with a shield, and head-butting. The trailer served <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>test</b> for Crytek {{to see whether the}} general audience liked the Kinect features or not.|$|E
5|$|Neil Alden Armstrong (August 5, 1930 – August 25, 2012) was an American astronaut, engineer, and {{the first}} person to walk on the Moon. He was also an {{aerospace}} engineer, naval aviator, test pilot, and university professor. Before becoming an astronaut, Armstrong was an officer in the U.S. Navy and served in the Korean War. After the war, he earned his bachelor's degree at Purdue University and served <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>test</b> pilot at the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) High-Speed Flight Station, where he logged over 900 flights. He later completed graduate studies at the University of Southern California.|$|E
