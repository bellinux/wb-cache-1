Among the newcoming settlers there were some noblemen as well. According to Belaj, these included members of the Parchevich family, the ancestral house of the Peyachevich family.|$|E
5|$|Scientific jury selection, often {{abbreviated}} SJS, {{is the use}} {{of social}} science techniques and expertise to choose favorable juries during a criminal or civil trial. Scientific jury selection is used during the jury selection phase of the trial—when lawyers have the opportunity to question jurors and they and the judge choose which people will be on the jury. It almost always entails an expert's assistance in the attorney's use of peremptory challenges—the right to reject <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> potential jurors without stating a reason—during jury selection. The practice is currently confined to the American legal system.|$|E

5|$|The game {{belongs to}} the Chrono series and is a gaiden, or side story, to the 1995 game Chrono Trigger. It was {{released}} to complement its predecessor's plot, and later served as inspiration for Chrono Cross. It features text-based gameplay with minimal graphics and sound effects, and was scored by composer Yasunori Mitsuda. Unlike many Satellaview titles, Radical Dreamers was not designed to lock after <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> playthroughs, so players owning an 8M Memory Pack onto which the game was downloaded can still play today.|$|E
5|$|The game {{includes}} {{a wide variety}} of weapons, including melee, projectile, and explosive weapons, as well as airstrike-based attacks. Some are based on real-life arms, such as the shotgun, bazooka, and hand grenade; others are rather fanciful and cartoonish, such as the sheep, which serves as a mobile explosive, and the skunk, which releases poisonous gas. In a normal match, all teams begin with the same weapons, based on the chosen weapon set. Some weapons may not become available until <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> turns pass. Depending on the game options, additional weapons may randomly fall onto the terrain in airdropped and teleported crates. In addition to normal weapons, during team creation, each team chooses a special weapon which becomes available to them after <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> turns. The special weapons are more powerful than regular weapons and often offer special abilities; super weapons will rarely fall in weapon crates. These weapons are often based on cartoonish themes, such as the French Sheep Strike, and usually devastating in power. In homage to the film Monty Python and the Holy Grail, one of the game weapons is a Holy Hand Grenade, with a sound-effect reminiscent of the Hallelujah chorus from Handel's Messiah.|$|E
5|$|The {{military}} {{nature of}} the Mycenaean Greeks {{is evident from the}} numerous weapons unearthed, the use of warrior and combat representations in contemporary art, and the preserved Greek Linear B records.

According to the Linear B records in the palace of Pylos, every rural community (the damos) was obliged to supply <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> men who had to serve in the army. Similar service was also performed by the aristocracy.|$|E

5|$|Each season {{consisted}} of 5 to 11 Grands Prix contested on closed circuits, {{as opposed to}} public roads. Points earned in these events counted toward the drivers' and constructors' world championships. The driver's and constructor's championship were separate championships, but {{were based on the}} same point system. The points systems used in the championship varied over the years. The first championship in 1949 awarded 10 points to the race winner with 8, 7, 6 and 5 points from second place to fifth place, a point was also awarded for the rider who completed the fastest lap. The last championship in 1982 awarded 15 points for a win, with 12, 10, 8, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, and 1 point from second place to tenth place.
