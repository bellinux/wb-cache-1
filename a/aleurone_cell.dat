40|$|DEFECTIVE KERNEL 1 (DEK 1), which {{consists}} of a membrane-spanning region (DEK 1 -MEM) and a calpain-like Cys proteinase region (DEK 1 -CALP), is essential for <b>aleurone</b> <b>cell</b> formation at the surface of maize (Zea mays) endosperm. Immunolocalization and FM 4 - 64 dye incubation experiments showed that DEK 1 and CRINKLY 4 (CR 4), a receptor kinase implicated in <b>aleurone</b> <b>cell</b> fate specification, colocalized to plasma membrane and endosomes. SUPERNUMERARY ALEURONE LAYER 1 (SAL 1), a negative regulator of <b>aleurone</b> <b>cell</b> fate encoding a class E vacuolar sorting protein, colocalized with DEK 1 and CR 4 in endosomes. Immunogold localization, dual-axis electron tomography, and diffusion of fluorescent dye tracers showed that young aleurone cells established symplastic subdomains through plasmodesmata of larger dimensions than those connecting starchy endosperm cells and that CR 4 preferentially associated with plasmodesmata between aleurone cells. Genetic complementation experiments showed that DEK 1 -CALP failed to restore wild-type phenotypes in maize and Arabidopsis thaliana dek 1 mutants, and DEK 1 -MEM also failed to restore wild-type phenotypes in Arabidopsis dek 1 - 1 mutants. Instead, ectopic expression of DEK 1 -MEM {{under the control of}} the cauliflower mosaic virus 35 S promoter gave a dominant negative phenotype. These data suggest a model for <b>aleurone</b> <b>cell</b> fate specification in which DEK 1 perceives and/or transmits a positional signal, CR 4 promotes the lateral movement of aleurone signaling molecules between aleurone cells, and SAL 1 maintains the proper plasma membrane concentration of DEK 1 and CR 4 proteins via endosome-mediated recycling/degradation...|$|E
40|$|Endosperm {{of cereal}} grains {{is one of}} the most {{important}} renewable resources for food, feed, and industrial raw material. It consists of four triploid cell types, i. e., aleurone, starchy endosperm, transfer cells, and cells of the embryo surrounding region. In maize, the aleurone layer is one cell layer thick and covers most of the perimeter of the endosperm. Specification of maize <b>aleurone</b> <b>cell</b> fate is proposed to occur through activation of the tumor necrosis factor receptor-like receptor kinase CRINKLY 4. A second maize gene essential for <b>aleurone</b> <b>cell</b> development is defective kernel 1 (dek 1). Here we show that DEK 1 shares high homology with animal calpains. The predicted 2, 159 -aa DEK 1 protein has 21 transmembrane regions, an extracellular loop, and a cysteine proteinase domain that shares high homology with domain II of m-calpain from animals. We propose that DEK 1 functions to maintain and restrict the <b>aleurone</b> <b>cell</b> fate imposed by CR 4 through activation of its cysteine proteinase by contact with the outer endosperm surface. DEK 1 seems to be the only member of the calpain superfamily in plants, Arabidopsis DEK 1 sharing 70 % overall identity with maize DEK 1. The expression of dek 1 in most plant tissues in maize and Arabidopsis, as well as its presence in a variety of higher plants, including angiosperms and gymnosperms, suggests that DEK 1 plays a conserved role in plant signal transduction...|$|E
40|$|Reactive {{oxygen species}} (ROS) promote the {{germination}} of several seeds, and antioxidants suppress it. However, questions remain regarding {{the role and}} production mechanism of ROS in seed germination. Here, we focused on NADPH oxidases, which produce ROS. After imbibition, NADPH oxidase mRNAs were expressed in the embryo and in <b>aleurone</b> <b>cells</b> of barley seed; these expression sites {{were consistent with the}} sites of ROS production in the seed after imbibition. To clarify the role of NADPH oxidases in barley seed germination, we examined gibberellic acid (GA) / abscisic acid (ABA) metabolism and signaling in barley seeds treated with diphenylene iodonium chloride (DPI), an NADPH oxidase inhibitor. DPI significantly suppressed germination, and suppressed GA biosynthesis and ABA catabolism in embryos. GA, but not ABA, induced NADPH oxidase activity in <b>aleurone</b> <b>cells.</b> Additionally, DPI suppressed the early induction of α-amylase by GA in <b>aleurone</b> <b>cells.</b> These results suggest that ROS produced by NADPH oxidases promote GA biosynthesis in embryos, that GA induces and activates NADPH oxidases in <b>aleurone</b> <b>cells,</b> and that ROS produced by NADPH oxidases induce α-amylase in <b>aleurone</b> <b>cells.</b> We conclude that the ROS generated by NADPH oxidases regulate barley seed germination through GA / ABA metabolism and signaling in embryo and <b>aleurone</b> <b>cells...</b>|$|R

BCECF accumulated in vacuoles of <b>aleurone</b> <b>cells,</b> but sequestration of the dye did not affect its sensitivity to pH. BCECF-loaded <b>aleurone</b> <b>cells</b> retained their {{ability to respond to}} both GA 3 and ABA. The pHv of freshly isolated <b>aleurone</b> <b>cells</b> is 6. 6, but after incubation in GA 3, the pHv fell to 5. 8.

40|$|The {{outermost}} {{layer of}} the endosperm is a specific cell type called the aleurone {{which is one of}} the grain quality determining factors because of its high content in lipid, minerals and high quality proteins compared to starchy endosperm. The aleurone layer is also an attractive system to study cell fate determination because of the simplicity and plasticity of <b>aleurone</b> <b>cell</b> fate. Here we report the identification of naked endosperm (nkd) genes which are involved in aleurone differentiation in maize. The nkd mutant shows defects in <b>aleurone</b> <b>cell</b> identity and has approximately 3 outer cell layers instead of the single in WT. However these outer cells do not contain dense granular cytoplasm typical of normal aleurone and have sporadic expression of a Vp 1 promoter GUS transgene, which is an aleurone identity marker. The nkd mutant phenotype shows 15 : 1 segregation ratio in F 2 populations suggesting two recessive genes are involved in this phenotype. We performed map-based cloning and found two homologous genes in syntenic regions. The INDETERMINATE 1 domain containing transcription factors ZmIDDveg 9 and ZmIDD 9 correspond to the nkd 1 and nkd 2 mutant genes on chromosomes 2 and 10, respectively. Independent Ds transposon insertion alleles of nkd 1 and nkd 2, nkd 1 -Ds and nkd 2 -Ds respectively, failed to complement the original nkd mutant. A Nkd 2 -RNAi line, in which both of nkd genes were knocked down, also showed the nkd mutant phenotype. The nkd transcripts were most abundant in developing kernels around 11 to 16 days after pollination. The NKD proteins have putative nuclear localization signals as other IDD genes and GFP fusion proteins showed nuclear localization. The mutant phenotype and gene expression pattern suggest NKD functions in <b>aleurone</b> <b>cell</b> fate acquisition and differentiation...|$|E

USA 82, 6512 - 6516], is characterized {{here as a}} glycoprotein that is targeted to a distinct vacuolar compartment in aleurone cells. Monospecific antibodies to a bacterial trpE-aleurain fusion protein were used to show that aleurain is made as a 42 -kilodalton (kD) proenzyme (proaleurain) that is proteolytically processed in a post-Golgi compartment in two steps to form a 32 -kD protein. The first processing step is the discrete loss of 9 kD from proaleurain to yield a 33 -kD intermediate that is further processed by the gradual loss of 1 kD resulting in mature 32 -kD aleurain. Using proaleurain secreted from Xenopus oocytes as a substrate, we established an in vitro system using <b>aleurone</b> <b>cell</b> extracts that correctly processes proaleurain to a stable protein that is indistinguishable from native barley aleurain as judged by partial digestion with staphylococcal V 8 protease.

40|$|Maize (Zea mays) {{endosperm}} {{consists of}} an epidermal-like surface layer of aleurone cells, an underlying body of starchy endosperm cells, and a basal layer of transfer cells. To determine whether surrounding maternal tissues perform a role in specifying endosperm cell fates, a maize endosperm organ culture technique was established whereby the developing endosperm is completely removed from surrounding maternal tissues. Using cell type-specific fluorescence markers, we show that <b>aleurone</b> <b>cell</b> fate specification occurs exclusively in response to surface position and does not require specific, continued maternal signal input. The starchy endosperm and <b>aleurone</b> <b>cell</b> fates are freely interchangeable throughout the lifespan of the endosperm, with internalized aleurone cells converting to starchy endosperm cells and with starchy endosperm cells that become positioned at the surface converting to aleurone cells. In contrast to aleurone and starchy endosperm cells, transfer cells fail to develop in in vitro-grown endosperm, supporting earlier indications that maternal tissue interaction is required to fully differentiate this cell type. Several parameters confirm that the maize endosperm organ cultures described herein retain the main developmental features of in planta endosperm, including fidelity of aleurone mutant phenotypes, temporal and spatial control of cell type-specific fluorescent markers, specificity of cell type transcripts, and control of mitotic cell divisions...|$|E

During the same incubation period, other organelles did not change significantly. The early increase in ER was not affected by gibberellin incubation.

40|$|Barley, one of {{the major}} small grain crops, is {{especially}} important in climatically demanding agricultural areas of the world, with multiple uses within food, feed, and beverage. The barley endosperm is further of special scientific interest due to its three <b>aleurone</b> <b>cell</b> layers, with the potential of bringing forward the molecular understanding of seed development and cell specification from Arabidopsis and maize. Work done in Arabidopsis and maize indicate the presence of conserved seed developmental pathways where Crinkly 4 (Cr 4), Defective kernel 1 (Dek 1), and Supernumerary aleurone layer 1 (Sal 1) are key players. With the use of microscopy, a comprehensive phenotypic characterization of the barley defective seed 5 (des 5) mutant is presented here.

40|$|Many {{developmental}} and environmental signals are transduced through changes in intracellular calcium concentrations, yet {{only a few}} calcium-binding proteins {{have been identified in}} plants. Calcineurin B-like (CBL) proteins are calcium-binding proteins that are thought to function as plant signal transduction elements. RNA profiling using a rice (Oryza sativa cv Nipponbare) oligonucleotide microarray was used to monitor gene expression in de-embryonated rice grains. This analysis showed that a putative rice CBL gene responded to gibberellic acid, but not abscisic acid, treatment. The CBL gene family in rice contains at least 10 genes and these have extensive similarity to the CBLs of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). In yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) two-hybrid assays, rice CBLs interact with the kinase partners of Arabidopsis CBLs. Only one rice CBL gene, OsCBL 2, is up-regulated by GA in the aleurone layer. A homolog with 91 % sequence identity to OsCBL 2 was cloned from barley (Hordeum vulgare cv Himalaya), and designated HvCBL 2. We examined the localization and function of OsCBL 2 and HvCBL 2 in rice and barley aleurone because changes in cytosolic calcium have been implicated in the response of the <b>aleurone</b> <b>cell</b> to GA. Green fluorescent protein translational fusions of OsCBL 2 and OsCBL 3 were localized to the tonoplast of <b>aleurone</b> <b>cell</b> protein storage vacuoles and OsCBL 4 -green fluorescent protein was localized to the plasma membrane.

Analyses of the rice (Oryza sativa) genomic sequences identified 77 WRKY genes, among which OsWRKY 71 is highly expressed in <b>aleurone</b> <b>cells.</b> Transient expression of OsWRKY 71 by particle bombardment specifically represses GA-induced Amy 32 b α-amylase promoter but not abscisic acid-induced HVA 22 or HVA 1 promoter activity in <b>aleurone</b> <b>cells.</b> Moreover, OsWRKY 71 blocks the activation of the Amy 32 b promoter by the GA-inducible transcriptional activator OsGAMYB. Consistent with {{its role as a}} transcriptional repressor, OsWRKY 71 is localized to nuclei of <b>aleurone</b> <b>cells</b> and binds specifically to functionally defined TGAC-containing W boxes of the Amy 32 b promoter in vitro. Mutation of the two W boxes prevents the binding of OsWRKY 71 to the mutated promoter, and releases the suppression of the OsGAMYB-activated Amy 32 b expression by OsWRKY 71, suggesting that OsWRKY 71 blocks GA signaling by functionally interfering with OsGAMYB. Exogenous GA treatment decreases the steady-state mRNA level of OsWRKY 71 and destabilizes the GFP:OsWRKY 71 fusion protein.

40|$|In {{response}} to gibberellic acid, aleurone layers isolated from dormant barley (Hordeum distichum L. cv.

Light microscopical investigations using the dye acridine orange {{as well as}} electron microscopical studies showed that the relatively low alpha-amylase production by aleurones from dormant kernels appears {{to be due to}} the majority of the cells remaining quiescent after GA 3 incubation. The cells that did show ultrastructural signs of GA 3 -induced activation occurred in clusters that spanned all three cell layers of the dormant <b>aleurone.</b> These <b>cells</b> showed a characteristic ultrastructure, which was different from that described previously for GA 3 incubated non-dormant aleurone layers. Dictyosomes, which are extremely difficult to visualise in non-dormant barley aleurone, were abundant. The presence of alpha-amylase in the Golgi could be demonstrated by immuno-gold labelling in these cells. Remarkably, most endosperm-facing <b>aleurone</b> <b>cells</b> in the activated clusters showed no cell wall degradation.

40|$|Background and Aims Alpha-gliadin {{proteins}} {{are important}} for the industrial quality of bread wheat flour, but they also contain many epitopes that can trigger celiac (coeliac) disease (CD). The B-genome-encoded alpha-gliadin genes, however, contain very few epitopes. Controlling alpha-gliadin gene expression in wheat requires knowledge on the processes of expression and deposition of alpha-gliadin protein during wheat grain development. Methods A 592 -bp fragment of the promotor of a B-genome-encoded alpha-gliadin gene driving {{the expression of a}} GUS reporter gene was transformed into wheat. A large number of transgenic lines were used for data collection. GUS staining was used to determine GUS expression during wheat kernel development, and immunogold labelling and tissue printing followed by staining with an alpha-gliadin-specific antibody was used to detect alpha-gliadin protein deposited in developing wheat kernels. The promoter sequence was screened for regulatory motifs and compared to other available alpha-gliadin promoter sequences. Key Results GUS expression was detected primarily in the cells of the starchy endosperm, notably in the subaleurone layer but also in the aleurone layer. The alpha-gliadin promoter was active from 11 days after anthesis (DAA) until maturity, with an expression similar to that of a 326 -bp low molecular weight (LMW) subunit gene promoter reported previously. An alpha-gliadin-specific antibody detected alpha-gliadin protein in protein bodies in the starchy endosperm and in the subaleurone layer but, in contrast to the promoter activity, no alpha-gliadin was detected in the <b>aleurone</b> <b>cell</b> layer. Sequence comparison showed differences in regulatory elements between the promoters of alpha-gliadin genes originating from different genomes (A and B) of bread wheat both in the region used here and upstream. Conclusions The results suggest that additional regulator elements upstream of the promoter region used may specifically repress expression in the <b>aleurone</b> <b>cell</b> layer. Observed differences in expression regulator motifs between the alpha-gliadin genes on the different genomes (A and B) of bread wheat leads to a better understanding how alpha-gliadin expression can be controlled.

40|$|Reactive {{oxygen species}} (ROS) act as signal {{molecules}} {{for a variety}} of processes in plants. However, many questions about the roles of ROS in plants remain to be clarified. Here, we report the role of ROS in gibberellin (GA) and abscisic acid (ABA) signaling in barley (Hordeum vulgare) <b>aleurone</b> <b>cells.</b> The production of hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2), a type of ROS, was induced by GA in <b>aleurone</b> <b>cells</b> but suppressed by ABA. Furthermore, exogenous H 2 O 2 appeared to promote the induction of α-amylases by GA. In contrast, antioxidants suppressed the induction of α-amylases. Therefore, H 2 O 2 seems to function in GA and ABA signaling, and in regulation of α-amylase production, in <b>aleurone</b> <b>cells.</b> To identify the target of H 2 O 2 in GA and ABA signaling, we analyzed the interrelationships between H 2 O 2 and DELLA proteins Slender 1 (SLN 1), GA-regulated Myb transcription factor (GAmyb), and ABA-responsive protein kinase (PKABA) and their roles in GA and ABA signaling in <b>aleurone</b> <b>cells.</b> In the presence of GA, exogenous H 2 O 2 had little effect on the degradation of SLN 1, the primary transcriptional repressor mediating GA signaling, but it promoted the production of the mRNA encoding GAMyb, which acts downstream of SLN 1 and involves induction of α-amylase mRNA. Additionally, H 2 O 2 suppressed the production of PKABA mRNA, which is induced by ABA:PKABA represses the production of GAMyb mRNA. From these observations, we concluded that H 2 O 2 released the repression of GAMyb mRNA by PKABA and consequently promoted the production of α-amylase mRNA, thus suggesting that the H 2 O 2 generated by GA in <b>aleurone</b> <b>cells</b> is a signal molecule that antagonizes ABA signaling...|$|R

Abscisic acid (ABA) {{did not increase}} cGMP levels in aleurone layers. LY 83583 (LY), an inhibitor of guanylyl cyclase, prevented the GA-induced increase in cGMP and inhibited GA-induced [alpha]-amylase synthesis and secretion. The inhibitory effects of LY could be overcome by membrane-permeant analogs of cGMP. LY also prevented GA-induced accumulation of [alpha]-amylase and GAMYB mRNAs. cGMP alone was not sufficient to induce the accumulation of [alpha]-amylase or GAMYB mRNA.

Although gibberellic acid stimulates glucanase release, it does not markedly affect {{the total amount of}} glucanase obtained from these cells when compared with water controls. β- 1, 3 -Glucanase release from <b>aleurone</b> <b>cells</b> is a function of gibberellic acid concentration and commences after a 4 -hour lag period. Processes occurring during this lag period are also dependent upon gibberellic acid concentration. Removal of gibberellic acid from the incubation medium {{at the end of the}} lag period, however, does not affect subsequent release of glucanase. The release of glucanase from <b>aleurone</b> <b>cells</b> is an active process with a Q 10 greater than 3. Inhibitors of respiration and protein and RNA synthesis effectively inhibit the formation and release of glucanase. It is concluded that gibberellic acid functions primarily to enhance glucanase release rather than its formation...|$|R
50|$|During seed germination, {{the plant}} embryo {{produces}} the hormone gibberellin which triggers the <b>aleurone</b> <b>cells</b> to release α-amylase for the hydrolysis of starch, proteases, and storage proteins into the endosperm. Evidence that G-proteins {{play a role}} in the gibberellin signaling events has been obtained. The breakdown of the starchy endosperm supplies sugars to drive the growth of roots and the acrospire. This release of amylase is considered to be the most important and sole function of the aleurone layer. This effect is inhibited by the plant hormone abscisic acid, which keeps the seed dormant. After completing this function, the <b>aleurone</b> <b>cells</b> in the developing seed undergo apoptosis.|$|R
40|$|In grass species, the {{endosperm}} is a {{major source}} of food, feed and industrial raw materials. In maize, the aleurone is the peripheral cell layer of the endosperm that functions primarily as a digestive tissue. The aluerone layer of the endosperm is an excellent system to study cell differentiation and fate specification. Aleurone identity is not fixed and positional cues are continuously required during development to specify and maintain <b>aleurone</b> <b>cell</b> fate in the peripheral layer. A putative genetic hierarchy is proposed based on the collections of aleurone mutants. Cell fate mutants define early factors and aluerone differentiation mutants define factors late in the aleurone development. CRINKLY 4 (CR 4), a plant receptor-kinase defines an early step in <b>aleurone</b> <b>cell</b> fate and VIVIPAROUS 1 (VP 1), a B 3 domain -containing transcription factor that regulates seed maturation in maize. The intermediate steps between CR 4 mediated cell fate specification and Vp 1 transcriptions are unknown. CSN 5 subunit of the COP 9 Siganalosome (CSN) interacts with the cytoplasmic domain of Arabidopsis CR 4 (ACR 4). The kinase domain of ACR 4 was shown to bind and phosphorylate the CSN 5 subunits in-vitro. In-vivo FRET experiments confirmed that ACR 4 was in close proximity to CSN 5 {{within the context of a}} plant cell. Curcumin treatment (COP 9 signalosome inhibitor) of transgenic plants resulted in the accumulation of ACR 4 -GFP. ACR 4 -GFP accumulated in a csn 5 double mutant suggesting the role of the CSN complex in the turnover of ACR 4 receptor. To better understand the transcriptional regulation of the Vp 1 and identify upstream candidates in the seed maturation and dormancy process, transfactors that bind to the CE 1 L element of Vp 1 was identified. CE 1 LBP 1, a novel zinc binding protein present in all angiosperms appears to be single copy in maize. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) with recombinant CE 1 LBP 1 protein and supershift EMSAs using maize embryos nuclear proteins with CE 1 LBP 1 specific antibodies confirmed binding. This study enhances our understanding of cell fate specification and maturation processes that operate in the aleurone cells during cereal grain development...|$|E
30|$|All three GS 1 genes were {{expressed}} in developing spikelets (Fig.  4 b), in addition, OsGS 1; 1 transcripts localized in dorsal vascular bundles, nucellar projection and <b>aleurone</b> <b>cell</b> layers (Additional file 3 : Figure S 3). This result {{is consistent with}} the results in previous studies (Thiel et al. 2008). Microdissection-based transcriptome studies indicated the expression of several GS 1 genes in nucellar projections of barley, {{one of the most important}} gramineae species (Thiel et al. 2008). Nucellar projections play an important role for endosperm growth and development (Matsuda et al. 1979; Martre et al. 2003). In this regard, free ammonium in nucellar projections should be quickly assimilated for an efficient nitrogen use. Therefore, GS 1 seemed to be coupled with ASNase 2 for the assimilation of ammonium derived from Asn degradation conducted by ASNase in developing rice grains. The functional association of both enzymes was consistent with the results from previous work; it showed the overlapping localization of both enzymes in hypocotyls of pine seedlings (Canas et al. 2007) for vascular development.|$|E
40|$|Gibberellic acid (GA) {{increases}} Ca 2 + and calmodulin (CaM) {{levels in}} barley aleurone cells, and abscisic acid (ABA) antagonizes the GA effect. These alterations in cytoplasmic Ca 2 + and CaM {{have been suggested}} to be central regulators of the secretory response of the barley aleurone. Using microinjection of caged Ca 2 +, Ca 2 + chelators, and CaM, we mimicked or blocked these hormonally induced changes in Ca 2 + and CaM and assessed their effects on GA and ABA action. Although mimicking GA-induced changes in Ca 2 + and CaM did not mimic GA action, blocking these changes did prevent GA stimulation of secretion. The induction of the amylase gene by GA was, however, unaffected. Similarly, blocking the decrease in Ca 2 + normally caused by ABA in these cells blocked ABA action, except that induction of Em gene transcription by ABA was unaffected. These results suggest that GA and ABA signals are transduced by Ca 2 +- and CaM-dependent and Ca 2 +- and CaM-independent systems in the <b>aleurone</b> <b>cell...</b>|$|E
40|$|A microscopy-based {{screen of}} a large {{collection}} of maize Mutator (Mu) transposon lines identified the supernumerary aleurone layers 1 - 1 (sal 1 - 1) mutant line carrying up to seven layers of <b>aleurone</b> <b>cells</b> in defective kernel endosperm compared with only {{a single layer in}} wild-type grains. Normal, well filled endosperm that is homozygous for the sal 1 - 1 mutant allele contains two to three layers of <b>aleurone</b> <b>cells.</b> Cloning of the sal 1 gene was accomplished by using Mu tagging, and the identity of the cloned gene was confirmed by isolating an independent sal 1 - 2 allele by reverse genetics. Homozygous sal 1 - 2 endosperm has two to three layers of <b>aleurone</b> <b>cells</b> in normal, well filled grains. In situ hybridization experiments reveal that the sal 1 gene is ubiquitously expressed in vegetative as well as zygotic grain tissues, with no difference being detected between <b>aleurone</b> <b>cells</b> and starchy endosperm cells. Northern blot analysis failed to detect the sal 1 - 2 transcript in leaves of homozygous plants, suggesting that the allele is a true sal 1 knockout allele. The sal 1 gene encodes a homologue of the human Chmp 1 gene, a member of the conserved family of the class E vacuolar protein sorting genes implicated in membrane vesicle trafficking. In mammals, CHMP 1 functions in the pathway targeting plasma membrane receptors and ligands to lysosomes for proteolytic degradation. Possible roles for the function of the sal 1 gene in aleurone signaling, including a defect in endosome trafficking, are discussed...|$|R
30|$|Target <b>cells</b> in <b>aleurone</b> {{layers and}} starchy {{endosperm}} were isolated by laser microdissection (LM), and RNAs were extracted from each endosperm {{tissue in the}} early storage phase. Genes important for carbohydrate metabolism in developing endosperm were analyzed using qRT-PCR, {{and some of the}} genes showed specific localization in either tissue of the endosperm. Aleurone layer-specific gene expression of a sucrose transporter, OsSUT 1, suggested that the gene functions in sucrose uptake into <b>aleurone</b> <b>cells.</b> The expression levels of ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (AGPL 2 and AGPS 2 b) in each endosperm tissue spatially corresponded to the distribution of starch granules differentially observed among endosperm tissues. By contrast, expressions of genes for sucrose cleavage—hexokinase, UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase, and phosphoglucomutase—were observed in all endosperm tissues tested. <b>Aleurone</b> <b>cells</b> predominantly expressed mRNAs for the TCA cycle and oxidative phosphorylation. This finding was supported by the presence of oxygen (8  % concentration) and large numbers of mitochondria in the aleurone layers. In contrast, oxygen was absent and only a few mitochondria were observed in the starchy endosperm. Genes for carbon fixation and the GS/GOGAT cycle were expressed highly in <b>aleurone</b> <b>cells</b> compared to starchy endosperm.|$|R
40|$|Oat {{seeds of}} cultivars {{susceptible}} and resistant to Helminthosporium victoriae were held for various times in pathogen-produced, host-specific toxin solutions; control seeds were in water. Seeds were then washed thoroughly and incubated on moist paper, or dried and stored for 2 - 3 weeks before germination was attempted. In both cases, germination of susceptible seeds was prevented by previous exposure to toxin for 1 hour or more. Control seeds and treated resistant seeds grew normally. Toxin {{did not affect}} O 2 uptake or loss of carbohydrates from seeds for the first 12 hours of imbibition. After 12 hours, toxin-treated susceptible seeds had higher respiration and lost more carbohydrates than did control seeds. Experiments with embryoless seeds showed that toxin blocked synthesis and secretion of α-amylase by susceptible but not by resistant <b>aleurone</b> <b>cells.</b> Resting <b>aleurone</b> <b>cells</b> were exposed briefly to toxin, then dried and stored until all toxin was gone. Susceptible <b>aleurone</b> <b>cells</b> treated in this way failed to produce α-amylase following exposure to gibberellic acid, while controls and resistant treated aleurone tissues produced amylase. Susceptibility or resistance to toxin appears to be expressed in resting and metabolically active tissues...|$|R
