500|$|Representing {{as he did}} a {{state in}} the Deep South, Mallory could hardly have avoided taking a public stance {{on the issues that}} were tearing the nation apart. The {{occasion}} arose when the Senate considered the admission of Kansas to the Union. Its Lecompton Constitution would allow slavery in Kansas, and citizens who were against extending the practice into new territories seized upon the widespread irregularities in the <b>adoption</b> <b>procedure</b> to oppose it. Senator Preston King of New York mounted a two-hour attack on the constitution and Southern policy in general, following which Mallory replied in what his biographers describe as [...] "probably his most effective speech in the Senate." [...] One segment of his talk presented the rationale of the slave-holders in their unwillingness to accept majority rule. Addressing the question whether the constitution had been ratified by [...] "the people," [...] he said: [...] "States have conferred, and may at any time confer, their whole political power on a minority. They may make disqualifications dependent upon the tenure of freehold estate, upon the payment of tax, upon militia duty, or upon the color of skin; but whoever the State chooses to confer her political authority upon, are the people." [...] He foresaw the decline in relative power of the slave-holding states, although at this time he did not believe it would necessarily lead to secession. He concluded his remarks by a pledge to follow the South whatever happened: [...] "It is not for me to indicate the path she [...] may, in her wisdom, pursue; but, sir, ... my whole heart is with her, and she will find me treading it with undivided affections." ...|$|E

50|$|The Adoption Act 1958 was an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom that updated and {{consolidated}} the law {{relating to}} adoption. After receiving Royal Assent on 18 December 1958 it came into force on 1 April 1959, regulating requirements for adopters, requirements for adoption {{agencies and the}} procedure to be used when making or appealing a court decision on adoption. After the regulations on <b>adoption</b> <b>procedure</b> were sharply criticised, law in this area was reformed with the Adoption Act 1976, which repealed the 1958 Act.|$|E

50|$|The Act {{was created}} {{as a result of}} the report of the Hurst Committee, {{delivered}} in September 1954. The Act was given the Royal Assent on 18 December 1958, and came into effect on 1 April 1959. New regulations for adoption were created based on the Act, and came into force on 17 April. It repealed or consolidated many statutes relating to adoption, including the Adoption Act 1950 and the Children Act 1958. It made several changes to the law governing consent of the natural parents, qualifications of adopters, <b>adoption</b> <b>procedure</b> and the procedure used in cases where the adoption is disputed.|$|E
5000|$|In {{regards to}} {{adoption}} agencies, the Act allows such agencies to place children not {{under their control}} with adopters, such as those looked after by local authorities. This required submitting local authorities to the same regulation as adoption agencies, and the Act also allows them to [...] "make and participate in arrangements for the adoption of children". Provisions that regulated the <b>adoption</b> <b>procedure</b> were sharply criticised, and the Houghton Committee reported in 1972 that significant reform was needed. This became the Adoption Act 1976, which along with the Adoption (Scotland) Act 1978 repealed the 1958 act in its entirety.|$|E
50|$|In other countries, {{where the}} power of {{regulating}} construction and fire safety is vested in local authorities, a system of model building codes is used. Model building codes have no legal status unless adopted or adapted by an authority having jurisdiction. The developers of model codes urge public authorities to reference model codes in their laws, ordinances, regulations, and administrative orders. When referenced {{in any of these}} legal instruments, a particular model code becomes law. This practice is known as adoption by reference. When an adopting authority decides to delete, add, or revise any portions of the model code adopted, it is usually required by the model code developer to follow a formal <b>adoption</b> <b>procedure</b> in which those modifications can be documented for legal purposes.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} the adoption of new prescription drugs by specialists who treat serious disorders using relatively high risk drugs with potentially serious side effects. One-hundred and fifty-six specialists, primarily practicing in medical specialties, evaluated a number of drug information sources and reported their use of these sources both in their general drug <b>adoption</b> <b>procedures</b> and in the adoption of {{one of a number}} of target drugs. As predicted, the pattern of drug adoption among specialists is substantially different from that generally reported in earlier studies, which are usually based on samples of general practitioners or of general practitioners and specialists combined. Professional sources of information predominate throughout the process, both in <b>adoption</b> <b>procedures</b> generally used and in the adoption of target drugs. The majority of specialists reported contact with commercial sources at some stage in the adoption process for the target drugs, but these sources were not, as is often reported in the literature, the main sources of first news of a new drug, nor did they exert much influence at the prescribing stage. It is clear from these results that in future research on drug innovation, different classes of medical practitioners, such as specialists vs general practitioners, will need to be distinguished. drug adoption medical innovation specialists...|$|R

50|$|Section 4 of the Act governs consent, {{and says}} that people {{no longer have to}} give their consent if they were liable to {{contribute}} to the child's maintenance via a court order or agreement - for example, the father of an illegitimate child who pays child support.

50|$|In 2001, {{countries}} {{within the}} European Union implemented the eCall program. eCall is an initiative to bring rapid assistance to motorists involved in collisions {{and is not}} designed to allow vehicle tracking outside of emergencies. Some European countries equip trucks with similar devices, containing navigational and communication components. In 2005, Germany began installing eCall devices on trucks with a carrying capacity exceeding 12 tonnes. Trucks in Sweden greater than 3.5 tonnes install the automatic connection devices. The EC proposals for legislative acts predicted eCall would be seamlessly functioning in most European vehicles by end of 2015.

50|$|A legal {{inequality}} {{compared to}} heterosexual couples still existed {{with regards to}} children: the husband of the biological mother is automatically legally recognised as the father (by article 135 of the Civil Code), {{but this was not}} the case in a same-sex couple for the wife of the mother. To be recognised as the co-mother, she had to complete an <b>adoption</b> <b>procedure.</b> This accounted for the large majority of adoption cases in Belgium. The Di Rupo Government promised to fix this, and in 2014, as the Netherlands recently passed similar legislation, LGBT organisations pressured the government about their promise. Subsequently, legislators worked to agree on a solution. A bill to this end was approved by the Senate on 3 April 2014 on a 48-2 vote (with one abstention), and by the Chamber of Representatives on 23 April on a 114-10 vote (with one abstention). The bill received royal assent on 5 May and went into effect on 1 January 2015.|$|E
