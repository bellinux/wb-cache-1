50|$|The bluish {{color is}} caused by an optical effect called Rayleigh <b>scattering.</b> The sunlit <b>sky</b> is blue because <b>air</b> <b>scatters</b> short-{{wavelength}} light more than longer wavelengths. Since blue light is at the short wavelength end of the visible spectrum, it is more strongly scattered in the atmosphere than long wavelength red light. The {{result is that the}} human eye perceives blue when looking toward parts of the sky other than the sun.|$|R
50|$|Konrad {{dedicated}} his finished treatise to {{the weak}} Ruprecht III {{in a bitter}} response to his exile. He emphasizes in the dedication the relationship of technical knowledge to technical skills. He writes of the German soldiers, Just as the <b>sky</b> <b>shines</b> with stars, Germany shines forth with liberal disciplines, is embellished with mechanics, and adorned with diverse arts.|$|R

60|$|When I {{first saw}} her {{there she was}} alone, and her work {{had fallen out of}} her hand, and she was looking up at the <b>sky</b> <b>shining</b> through the tops of the windows. Pray do not be uneasy when I tell you, but it was not quite so airy, nor so bright, nor so cheerful, nor so happy and {{youthful}} altogether as I should have liked it to be.|$|R
60|$|The west window {{commanded}} distant {{hills that}} rose, colored dark-blue, against the yellow <b>sky.</b> <b>Shining</b> water touched {{their feet and}} one could hear the sea. It was getting dark, however, and soon electric lights began to glow on the paneled ceiling and along the deep cornice. The lamps were placed among the moldings and one scarcely noticed them until the soft light they threw on the table got stronger.|$|R

40|$|During the Airborne Antarctic Ozone Experiment from 28 August to 30 September 1987 near UV zenith <b>scattered</b> <b>sky</b> {{measurements}} were made over Antarctic from the NASA DC- 8 aircraft using a one third m spectrograph {{equipped with a}} diode-array detector. <b>Scattered</b> <b>sky</b> light data in the wavelength range 348 nm to 388 nm was spectrally analyzed for O 3, NO 2, OClO, and BrO column abundances. Slant column abudances of O 3, NO 2, OClO and BrO were determined, using a computer algorithm of non-linear and linear least square correlation of Antarctic <b>scattered</b> <b>sky</b> spectra to laboratory absorption cross section data. Using measured vertical electrochemical sonde ozone profiles from Palmer, Halley Bay, and the South Pole Stations the slant columns of O 3 were converted into vertical column abundances. The vertical column amounts of NO 2, OClO, and BrO were derived using vertical profiles calculated by a chemical model appropriate for Antarctica. NO 2 vertical column abundances show steep latitudinal decrease with increasing latitude for all 13 flights carried out during the mission. In the regions where NO 2 abudances are low, OClO and BrO were observed. The spatial and temporal vertical column abundances of these species {{are discussed in the}} context of the chemistry and dynamics in the antarctic polar vortex during the austral spring...|$|R
6000|$|The moon {{has sunk}} behind the Mount of Olives, {{and the stars}} in the darker <b>sky</b> <b>shine</b> doubly bright over the sacred city. The all-pervading stillness is broken by a breeze that seems to have {{travelled}} over the plain of Sharon from the sea. It wails among the tombs, and sighs among the cypress groves. The palm-tree trembles as it passes, {{as if it were a}} spirit of woe. Is it the breeze that has travelled over the plain of Sharon from the sea? ...|$|R
2500|$|The {{original}} Star Air Service plane, the Fleet 7 open-cockpit biplane had a three-line identification {{painted on}} the side with a barnstar between the words [...] "Flight" [...] & [...] "Instruction" [...] in the middle line. Each point of the barnstar was two colors, light one half, dark on the other. The barnstar was to be emblematic of the North Star, which in the Arctic <b>sky</b> <b>shines</b> almost directly overhead. The company founders named the airplane the Northstar, and had originally considered naming their company North Star Airlines, but instead chose Star Air Service.|$|R

50|$|In 1920, Li {{organized}} the Bright Moon ensemble, {{the name of}} which Li derived from the New Culture Movement’s rhetoric; Li described the focus of his musical endeavors, declaring, “we raise a banner of a ‘music for the common people,’ like the bright moon in the <b>sky,</b> <b>shining</b> across the land {{for all the people}} to enjoy”. In that same year, Li also became the editor of the Common People’s Weekly Magazine, and the next year became an editor at the China Book Bureau, and the following year was promoted to be the principal of the National Language Institute in Shanghai.|$|R

50|$|The initial Iraqi {{attack on}} al-Jaber closed the runways due to {{presence}} of <b>air</b> <b>scattered</b> mines. The returning Mirage F-1 and A-4 landed and were serviced {{on the perimeter}} fence road. Only when Iraqi troops were {{right next to the}} base did attack sorties stop.|$|R
5000|$|The answer {{given by}} the Old Man of the Mountain is: [...] "Out there, where <b>sky</b> <b>shines,</b> humans say: 'To thyself be true.' In here, trolls say: 'Be true to {{yourself}} and to hell with the world.'" [...] Egoism is a typical trait of the trolls in this play. From then on, Peer uses this as his motto, always proclaiming that he is himself. He then meets {{one of the most}} interesting characters, the Bøyg — a creature who has no real description. Asked the question [...] "Who are you?" [...] The Bøyg answers, [...] "Myself". In time, Peer also takes the Bøyg's important saying as a motto: [...] "Go around". The rest of his life, he [...] "beats around the bush" [...] instead of facing himself or the truth.|$|R
50|$|Crepuscular rays usually appear orange {{because the}} {{path through the}} {{atmosphere}} at sunrise and sunset passes through up to 40 times as much air as rays from a high midday sun.

30|$|Scanning small-angle X-ray {{scattering}} measurements (SAXS) {{were performed}} at the cSAXS beamline at the Swiss Light Source (PSI, Villigen, Switzerland). The specimens, placed in polyimide sachets to avoid dehydration during measurements, were mounted on a metallic frame and raster-scanned in 50  μm steps in horizontal and vertical directions through a 18.58  keV X-ray beam focused to 5  ×  25  μm 2 spot size at the specimen location. Specimen to detector distance, determined from the first scattering order of a silver behenate specimen, amounted to 7.1  m. Three tooth slices, two carious and one healthy, were measured with two modules of the PILATUS 2  M detector while the remaining specimens were measured with 24 modules (full frame) [45]. To reduce <b>air</b> <b>scattering,</b> an evacuated flight tube was placed between specimen and detector. The X-ray attenuation of the specimens was measured before each scan with attenuated beam or inline with the SAXS scans. The <b>air</b> <b>scattering</b> signal was subtracted from each pattern.|$|R
40|$|A fast technique, {{based on}} {{approximation}} to atmospheric radiative transfer {{in the solar}} aureole, is presented for the retrieval of aerosol size distribution from multispectral measurements of both <b>scattered</b> <b>sky</b> radiance and extinction by aerosol media. In this approximation, {{it is assumed that}} for a relatively clear day, the sky radiance is due to single scattering by molecules and aerosols, and to multiple scattering by molecules alone. The accuracy of this approximation is discussed in connection with the inversion of scattered radiation data. Results for aerosol size distributions retrieved from multispectral solar extinction measurements by the nonlinear least squares method are discussed, and the retrievals are found to be accurate when checked against ground truth measurements...|$|R

30|$|Small-angle X-ray {{scattering}} (SAXS) {{measurements were}} performed using a Xeuss 2.0 SAXS/WAXS system (Xenocs, France) with pinhole collimation for point focus geometry [18]. The SAXS camera {{was equipped with}} a Hi-Star 2 D detector. The optics and sample chamber were used under vacuum conditions to minimize <b>air</b> <b>scatter.</b> The liquid samples were placed in 0.5 -mm glass capillaries, and measurements were performed in a vacuum at 25  °C with an exposure time of 0.5  h.|$|R
40|$|This article {{discusses}} the importance in clouds {{of these two}} mechanisms compared to a third scattering mechanism: coherent particle scattering, which is caused by spatial variations in the liquid water content of the clouds. We will argue that for radars with a wavelength larger than a centimetre, coherent particle scatter can dominate Rayleigh scattering from individual droplets, both for cumulus and stratiform clouds. Coherent <b>air</b> <b>scatter</b> in clouds is probably less important than previously though...|$|R

"Ay, sir, it is damp, {{and there}} is little of it," [...] rejoined Tom; [...] "but as it comes only from the shore, so it never goes far on the water, It is hard to learn the true signs of the weather, Captain Barnstable, and none get to know them well, but such as study little else or feel but little else. There is only One who can see the winds of heaven, or who can tell when a {{hurricane}} is to begin, or where it will end. Still, a man isn't like a whale or a porpoise, that takes the, air in his nostrils, and never knows whether it is a southeaster or a northwester that he feeds upon. Look, broad-off to leeward, sir; see the streak of clear <b>sky</b> <b>shining</b> under the mists; take an old seafaring man's word for it, Captain Barnstable, that whenever the light shines out of the heavens in that fashion, 'tis never done for nothing; besides, the sun set in a dark bank of clouds, and the little moon we had was dry and windy." ...|$|R
40|$|An {{atmospheric}} correction model {{was extended to}} account for various atmospheric radiation components in remotely sensed data. Components such as the atmospheric path radiance which results from singly <b>scattered</b> <b>sky</b> radiation specularly reflected by the water surface are considered. A component which {{is referred to as}} the virtual Sun path radiance, i. e. the singly scattered path radiance which results from the solar radiation which is specularly reflected by the water surface is also considered. These atmospheric radiation components are coded into a computer program for the analysis of multispectral remote sensor data over the Great Lakes of the United States. The user must know certain parameters, such as the visibility or spectral optical thickness of the atmosphere and the geometry of the sensor with respect to the Sun and the target elements under investigation...|$|R
