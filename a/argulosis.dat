5000|$|Argulus foliaceus is {{a species}} of {{crustacean}} in the family Argulidae, the fish lice. It is sometimes called the common fish louse. It is [...] "the most common and widespread native argulid in the Palaearctic" [...] and [...] "one of the most widespread crustacean ectoparasites of freshwater fish in the world", considering its distribution and range of hosts. It can cause the severe disease state <b>argulosis</b> {{in a wide variety}} of fish species. It is responsible for epizootic outbreaks that have led to the collapse of aquaculture operations. Fish lice are not related to lice, which are insects.|$|E
40|$|<b>Argulosis</b> {{caused by}} {{crustacean}} ectoparasites {{of the genus}} Argulus {{is one of the}} parasitic diseases that pose a major threat to freshwater aquaculture industry around the globe. The actual loss incurred due to this disease has gone mostly unnoticed. In the present study, economic burden imposed by Argulus sp. in carp culture ponds in India was estimated based on the data obtained from the survey conducted in major aquaculture zones in the country. The loss was estimated by taking into account the mortality occurred, loss in growth by reduction in weight and expenditure towards drugs/chemicals applied for treatment or prevention of this disease. The total loss due to <b>argulosis</b> has been estimated to the magnitude of ` 29524. 40 (US $ 615) ha- 1 year- 1. Hence, management of this disease should be given top priority to save the aquaculture industry from this huge loss...|$|E
40|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} with the broad objectives to assess the existing situation of broodstock management and fish seed production in private fish seed farms in Bangladesh. The data were collected from 100 private hatcheries and 40 nurseries in seven upazilas under four districts. There was no shed in forty hatcheries and the owners faced many problems. Brood fish ponds were found suitable for rearing brood fish. About 66 % of the hatchery owners collected brood fish from their own ponds and ponds of neighboring areas. Activities like pond preparation; manuring and supplementary feeding were done properly but stocking density of brood fish in 76 % of the hatcheries was 3, 000 - 7, 000 kg/ha. Infection of <b>argulosis</b> was found in brood fish of 87 % of the hatcheries. About 67 % of the hatchery owners practiced inter-species crossing. Major problems faced by the hatchery owners were <b>argulosis</b> of brood fish, unavailability of pure brood stock, inadequate brood fish pond. The hatchery owners were found interested to find out the preventive measures of <b>argulosis,</b> develop pure brood stock of indigenous carp and import pure strain of exotic carp. According to the nursery operators, they cultivated hybrid fry because of high demand, rapid growth and good taste. Problems of using hatchery spawn as mentioned by the nursery operators were inbreeding, under sized and aged brood stock, stunted growth, physical deformities and high mortality of spawn due to unknown causes...|$|E
40|$|Fish lice (Argulus spp.) are obligate ectoparasites, which {{contrary}} to most aquatic parasites, retain {{the ability to}} swim freely throughout the whole of their life. In fish farms, they can quickly increase in numbers and without effective control cause <b>argulosis,</b> which results in the reduced growth and survival of their fish hosts. The morphology of Argulus spp, including their sensory organs, is suitable for both parasitism and free-swimming. By spending {{a considerable amount of}} time away from their host, these parasites risk being excessively dispersed, which could endanger mating success. Here we present a review of recent studies on the behaviour of Argulus spp, especially the aggregative behaviour that mitigates the dilution of the parasite population. Aggregation of parasites, which is especially important during the period of reproduction, occurs on different scales and involves both the aggregation of the host and the aggregation of the parasites on the host. The main behavioural adaptations of Argulus spp, including searches for hosts and mates, host manipulation and host choice, are all focused on the fish. As these ectoparasites repeatedly change hosts and inflict skin damage, they can act as vectors for fish pathogens. The development of environmentally friendly measures for the control and prevention of <b>argulosis</b> needs {{to take into account the}} behaviour of the parasites...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} to know the status of biosecurity and health management at some selected fish hatcheries in Mymensingh district of Bangladesh district from January to May 2012. Data was collected from 30 hatchery owners through questionnaire interview. The hatcheries produced seeds of tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus), Indian major carps, Thai koi (Anabas testudineus) and Thai pangus (Pangasianodon hypophthalmus). The hatchery production activities took place during late February and continued up to September. The peak season of seed production was found during April to May. Biosecurity status of the hatcheries was assessed through some selected activities that have generally been practiced to prevent or spread diseases. The biosecurity status of hatcheries was found quite satisfactory. It was observed that all the hatcheries (100 %) cleaned their hatchery units regularly and majority (83. 33 %) of them maintained good hygine in hatcheries. They also maintained proper water temperature (80 %), disinfected equipments (76. 66 %), stoked disease free broods (76. 66 %) and followed quarantine procedure (66. 66 %). Other biosecurity measures were also used but in very limited state. No hatchery was seen to use vaccine to their brood fish against certain disease. They also did not use any protective clothing. Hatchery owners reported some diseases in brood which included <b>argulosis</b> (34. 09 %), epizootic ulcerative syndrome or EUS (28. 41 %), gill rot (9. 09 %), dropsy (11. 36 %) and nutritional diseases (5. 68 %). The prevalence of disease in brood fish was about 15 - 20 % with 5...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} examine {{the current status of}} fish disease and health {{management}} practices in rural freshwater aquaculture, a questionnaire survey and Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA) tools were used in five districts of Bangladesh namely Mymensingh, Comilla, Jessore, Natore and Dinajpur. A total of 500 farmers were interviewed and 25 PRA sessions were conducted. Most of the farmers (87. 8 %) interviewed had disease problem in their fishponds. Prevalence of fish disease varied with districts and the size of farms. Average prevalence of fish disease was highest in Jessore district (18. 2 %) followed by Comilla (13. 4 %), Mymensingh (11. 4 %) and Dinajpur district (10. 4 %). Minimum prevalence (5. 5 %) was recorded from Natore district. Small farms (0. 4 ha) suffered from high disease prevalence (13. 8 %) followed by medium (0. 2 - 0. 4 ha) and large (> 0. 4 ha) farms with 12. 4 and 9. 3 % of diseases, respectively. The most prevalent disease was tail and fin rot (20. 5 %), followed by epizootic ulcerative syndrome or EUS (18. 9 %), nutritional diseases (15. 3 %), red spot (13. 0 %) and gill rot (12. 3 %). Other conditions like <b>argulosis,</b> dropsy and white spot were also reported by the farmers but with lower incidence. The diseases occurred mainly in the winter season. Overall, the knowledge of the farmers on basic fish health management was found very poor. Most of the farmers (83. 8 %) used treatment measures in response to particular disease problem. For disease treatment, 46 % farmers used combination of lime and potassium permanganate, 22. 4 % farmer used only lime and about 10 % farmer used lime and salt together. This study identified some fish health management related problems in rural aquaculture, such as lack of assistance, poor technical knowledge and lack of suitable therapeutics and their proper uses...|$|E
40|$|Argulus foliaceus (Linnaeus, 1758) is {{a member}} of the branchiuran family Argulidae and has a {{worldwide}} distribution, causing major economic impacts for freshwater aquacultured fish species worldwide. In the UK, it has economic impacts for both aquaculture and sports fishing industries. Previous studies observed haemorrhagic and inflammatory responses after Argulus infection, which has been taken to support the idea that the parasite secretes chemicals during the feeding process to assist with the ingestion of blood and epithelial tissue. The present study suggests that the blood-feeding ectoparasite of fish, A. foliaceus, may use similar mechanisms for evading host immune responses to those used by sea lice and other haematophagous arthropods. No previous studies have directly investigated the nature of the bioactive compounds / proteins, assumed to be released from these ectoparasites, and which are considered to contribute to feeding processes and host-parasite interactions during infection. Thus, the work described in this thesis was undertaken with the objective of identifying, describing and characterising the secretory components that have previously been suggested to be secreted from glandular cells associated with the feeding appendages of Argulus foliaceus. The current study applied transcriptomic and proteomic techniques in conjunction with in situ methods to investigate known immunomodulatory genes that may serve a function in parasite-host interactions. Overall, the findings of this project have generated considerable additional knowledge concerning the biology of Argulus spp. and have provided a list of proteins that may be used by the parasite to facilitate feeding processes by secreting these active molecules into the host and hence modulating their immune defence mechanisms. This information can be used as a baseline for developing freshwater lice control strategies to help prevent the spread of <b>Argulosis</b> in aquaculture by applying vaccination as means of control using the candidate antigens described in this study to specifically target Argulus spp. Knowledge generated by the work described in this thesis can also contribute to the development of drugs for controlling Argulus or functional components of feed that may serve to protect fish against this parasite. Furthermore, data from this thesis enhances the knowledge of the distribution of toxin/venom or venom-like substances in crustaceans and arthropods in general...|$|E
