5|$|In 1349, John plundered a Venetian {{commercial}} ship {{which had}} been shipwrecked on the coast he controlled, {{in accordance with the}} medieval principle of jus naufragii. This act necessitated the involvement of Stephen Dušan in order to settle the dispute between Venice and John, as evidenced by an official document from 13 April 1350. Despite this conflict, under John the Principality of Valona was an <b>active</b> <b>partner</b> of Venice and Ragusa (modern Dubrovnik) in maritime commerce. Two receipts from 27 April 1350 document John's role as a mediator in cattle, sugar and pepper trade and reveal that he received significant income from the Valona customs. The customs was profitable because the port was often visited by merchant ships. Even though all of these documents were written in Slavic, John signed his name in Greek, which testifies to his Hellenisation. At the time, John also had ties with the Mamluk rulers of Egypt, who addressed him as “King of Serbia and Bulgaria” in correspondence.|$|E

25|$|A common {{reason for}} the <b>active</b> <b>partner</b> to tie up their partner is so both may gain {{pleasure}} from the restrained partner's submission and {{the feeling of the}} temporary transfer of control and power. For sadomasochistic people, bondage is often used as a means to an end, where the restrained partner is more accessible to other sadomasochistic behaviour. However, bondage can also be used for its own sake. The restrained partner can derive sensual pleasure from the feeling of helplessness and immobility, and the <b>active</b> <b>partner</b> can derive visual pleasure and satisfaction from seeing their partner tied up.|$|E

The legs may be raised high, with the knees drawn towards their chest, and with some sort of support (such as a pillow) under the receiver's hips for comfort and to raise the receiver's buttocks. The penetrating partner positions himself between the receiver's legs and aligns his penis with the anus for anal penetration. Instead of penetration, an <b>active</b> <b>partner</b> may perform anilingus on the partner with raised legs.|$|E

25|$|Many couples {{incorporate}} bondage {{into their}} sex lives, often sporadically but sometimes more regularly, and find sexual bondage to be relationship-affirming. This sometimes {{takes the form}} of a sex game or sexual fantasy enactment. Bedroom bondage games are commonly used as a form of foreplay. They require and imply a level of trust and a surrender of control by the restrained to the <b>active</b> <b>partner.</b> The restrained partner (called a bottom) surrenders control to the other partner (called a top). This surrender of control happens voluntarily and under mutual understanding and consent.|$|E
5000|$|Two {{catalysts}} can {{be credited}} for the brand relationship paradigm. Max Blackston's 1992 piece, [...] "Observations: Building Brand Equity by Managing the Brand's Relationships", highlighted {{for the first}} time that brands themselves were <b>active</b> <b>partners</b> in a relationship, and called for attention not just to people's perceptions of and attitudes toward brands, but also to the reciprocating construct: what people thought the brand thought of them. Fournier took this idea of an <b>active</b> brand <b>partner</b> with her thesis in 1994 titled [...] "A Consumer-Brand Relationship Framework for Strategic Brand Management".|$|R

25|$|After Latvia regained {{independence}} {{after the}} fall of the Soviet Union, Liepāja has worked hard to change from a military city into a modern port city (again appearing on European maps after the secrecy of the Soviet period). The commercial port was re-opened in 1991, and in 1994 the last Russian troops left Liepāja. Since then, Liepāja has engaged in international co-operation, has been associated with 10 twin and partner cities, and is an <b>active</b> <b>partner</b> in several co-operation networks. Facilities are being improved. The city is the location of Latvia's largest naval flotilla, the largest warehouses of ammunition and weapons in the Baltic states, and the main supply centre of the Latvian army.|$|E
25|$|For {{much of its}} history, {{knowledge}} of Venona was restricted even from {{the highest levels of}} government. Senior army officers, in consultation with the FBI and CIA, made the decision to restrict {{knowledge of}} Venona within the government (even the CIA was not made an <b>active</b> <b>partner</b> until 1952). Army Chief of Staff Omar Bradley, concerned about the White House's history of leaking sensitive information, decided to deny President Truman direct knowledge of the project. The president received the substance of the material only through FBI, Justice Department, and CIA reports on counterintelligence and intelligence matters. He was not told the material came from decoded Soviet ciphers. To some degree this secrecy was counter-productive; Truman was distrustful of FBI head J. Edgar Hoover and suspected the reports were exaggerated for political purposes.|$|E
500|$|Due to Dual Destinies {{being made}} {{long after the}} {{previous}} main game in the series, the developers felt that they needed it {{to make a big}} impact; they knew from the start that they wanted Phoenix Wright to return as the game's main character and as an attorney, since they had hinted at it {{at the end of the}} previous game. Additionally, they wanted to retain Apollo Justice as an important character, and not steal the spotlight from him, as he had already been established as a new main character. Feeling that Apollo's story had not been explored enough in the previous game, they focused on developing his character further in Dual Destinies, and added the character Athena Cykes as his junior. Yamazaki created Athena to be an <b>active</b> <b>partner</b> for Phoenix, rather than a [...] "supporter in the background". The development team encountered problems while figuring out how to make the impact they wanted with the game with both Phoenix and Apollo, until they decided on the story concept of Phoenix and Apollo working to revive a collapsed trial system. From the start, Yamazaki knew that he wanted all three player characters to have their own motivations and purposes, which would play out throughout the game. At one point, he considered having five lawyers in the game, because of it being the fifth game in the series; he later called this idea crazy and overly ambitious, and felt that they had [...] "dodged a bullet" [...] by not using it.|$|E

2500|$|Note: Irrumāre, {{which in}} English is denoted by the passive {{construction}} [...] "to be sucked", {{is an active}} verb in Latin, since the irrumator {{was considered to be}} the <b>active</b> <b>partner,</b> the fellator the passive. Irrumātiō is the counterpart of fellatio; in Roman terms, which are the opposite way round to modern conceptions, the giver of oral sex inserts his penis into the mouth of the receiver.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{people feel}} that bondage must be [...] "rough and tough", as seen in many images of bondage erotica, {{but this is not}} always true. In {{so-called}} [...] "soft bondage", the <b>active</b> <b>partner</b> can simply hold the restrained partner's hands together with their own hands, handcuff the restrained partner, or simply order the restrained partner not to move their hands, without using any physical restraint. This latter case, called [...] "verbal bondage", appeals to many people and is far more common than most people [...] think.|$|E

2500|$|Different {{cultures}} have had different views on anal sex throughout human history, with some cultures more {{positive about the}} activity than others. Historically, anal sex has been restricted or condemned, {{especially with regard to}} religious beliefs; it has also commonly been used as a form of domination, usually with the <b>active</b> <b>partner</b> (the one who is penetrating) representing masculinity and the passive partner (the one who is being penetrated) representing femininity. A number of {{cultures have}} especially recorded the practice of anal sex between males, and anal sex between males has been especially stigmatized or punished. [...] In some societies, if discovered to have engaged in the practice, the individuals involved were put to death, such as by decapitation, burning, or even mutilation.|$|E
2500|$|In Ancient Rome {{the young}} male body {{remained}} {{a focus of}} male sexual attention, but relationships were between older free men and slaves or freed youths who took the receptive role in sex. The Hellenophile emperor Hadrian is renowned for his relationship with Antinous, but the Christian emperor Theodosius I decreed a law on 6 August 390, condemning passive males to be burned at the stake. Justinian, {{towards the end of}} his reign, expanded the proscription to the <b>active</b> <b>partner</b> as well (in 558), warning that such conduct can lead to the destruction of cities through the [...] "wrath of God". Notwithstanding these regulations, taxes on brothels of boys available for homosexual sex continued to be collected {{until the end of the}} reign of Anastasius I in 518.|$|E
2500|$|Anna Freud {{reported}} the successful treatment of homosexuals as neurotics {{in a series}} of unpublished lectures.

In her view, it was important {{to pay attention to the}} interaction of passive and active homosexual fantasies and strivings, the original interplay of which prevented adequate identification with the father. The patient should be told that his choice of a passive partner allows him to enjoy a passive or receptive mode, while his choice of an <b>active</b> <b>partner</b> allows him to recapture his lost masculinity. She claimed that these interpretations would reactivate repressed castration anxieties, and childhood narcissistic grandiosity and its complementary fear of dissolving into nothing during heterosexual intercourse would come with the renewal of heterosexual potency.|$|E
