2500|$|Some of Goldwater's {{statements}} in the 1990s alienated many social conservatives. He endorsed Democrat Karan English in an Arizona congressional race, urged Republicans to lay off Bill Clinton over the Whitewater scandal, and criticized the military's ban on homosexuals: He said that [...] "Everyone knows that gays have served honorably in the military {{since at least the}} time of Julius Caesar" [...] and that [...] "You don't need to be 'straight' to fight and die for your country. You just need to shoot straight." [...] A few years before his death he addressed establishment Republicans by saying, [...] "Do not associate my name with <b>anything</b> <b>you</b> <b>do.</b> You are extremists, and you've hurt the Republican party much more than the Democrats have." ...|$|E
2500|$|Jazz {{historian}} and commentator Ira Gitler declared that Tatum's [...] "left hand was {{the equal of}} his right." [...] When Bud Powell was opening for Tatum at Birdland around 1950, {{the end of an}} era when musicians engaged in overt competition and so-called cutting sessions, Powell reportedly said to Tatum, [...] "Man, I'm going to really show you about tempo and playing fast. [...] Anytime you're ready." [...] Tatum laughed and replied, [...] "Look, you come in here tomorrow, and <b>anything</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> with your right hand, I'll do with my left." [...] Powell never took up the challenge. Of note was Tatum's double-time stride playing, where his left hand alternated between playing bass notes (or tenth intervals) and mid-range chords at high speed, a device he used in showcase recordings like [...] "I Wish I Were Twins", [...] "The Shout", and [...] "Elegy".|$|E

6000|$|She {{thought of}} it, {{and he could}} see even more of the relief she was taking from him. His presence, his face, his voice, the old rooms themselves, so meagre yet so charged, where Kate had admirably been to him--these things counted for her, now she had them, as the help she had been wanting: so that she still only stood there taking them all in. With it however popped up {{characteristically}} a throb of her conscience. What she thus tasted was almost a personal joy. It told Densher of the three days she on her side had spent.

Are you mad, that you speak of such things, or am I mad to listen to them? Don't dare think more of such a desecration.
