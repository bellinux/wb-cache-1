50|$|The jigger {{consists}} of a slotted wooded board that floats under the ice surface and two levers connected {{in such a way}} that when a rope connected to one lever (arm) is pulled, the second lever (leg) jabs into the ice and pushes against the ice to move the board in the direction opposite to the rope pull. After each pull <b>a</b> <b>spring</b> <b>resets</b> the arm, and the action is repeated. In this way a person by an ice hole propels the jigger away. If the ice is transparent enough, one just makes another hole over the jigger when it moves far away. (Otherwise the progress of the jigger may be monitored by the tapping noise of the jigger's leg.) After that the jigger is pulled out of the second hole, together with the rope, and the net may be stretched under the ice using the rope from one hole to another.|$|R

Significant American calls for withdrawal include the Iraq Study Group Report and the Center for American Progress's proposal for strategic <b>reset.</b> <b>As</b> of <b>spring</b> 2007, surveys showed a majority of Americans in support of a timetable for withdrawal. While up to 70 percent of Americans in one survey favored withdrawal, most prefer to leave gradually over 12 months, and 60 percent say the U.S. has a moral obligation to the Iraqi people. [...] In addition to voicing concerns over the human and financial costs of the war, supporters of withdrawal argue that the U.S. presence fosters ongoing violence by providing a target for al-Qaeda. It also allows Iraqi political leaders to avoid reaching a power-sharing agreement. The withdrawal will induce Iraq's neighbors to become more involved in quelling violence in the country and will relieve the strain on the U.S. military. [...] The withdrawal debate has brought comparison of Iraq and Vietnam wars.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe BDD- and SAT-based model {{checking}} and verification methods normally require an initial state. Here {{we are concerned}} with sequential hardware verification, where an initial state {{must be one of}} the reset states. In practice, <b>a</b> <b>reset</b> state is not always given by the designer, and computing <b>a</b> <b>reset</b> state of <b>a</b> circuit is a hard problem. In this paper we propose a method allowing usage of SAT-based verification methods without a need for a user-given or a computed initial state. The idea is to employ a binary encoding of 3 -valued modeling of circuits, and use the undefined state X as <b>a</b> <b>reset</b> state...|$|R

50|$|One of {{the main}} characters. She {{possesses}} the ability to 'reset' the town of Sagrada for a maximum of three days. To do this, she must first 'save' at a specific time, after which, when she uses her Reset, the town of Sagrada {{will return to the}} saved time. <b>A</b> <b>Reset</b> can be done once per Save, and after <b>a</b> <b>Reset,</b> <b>a</b> Save can only be done 24 hours later. Her ability is not going back in time, but a literal reset; everything is reverted to its original state when the save was made. As a result, her own memories of the time between a Save and <b>a</b> <b>Reset</b> are also gone. This made her ability useless because she herself have no idea what she wants to change before committing <b>a</b> <b>Reset,</b> and everything will just repeat what happened before. The only person who can remember the events before the Reset is Kei. After meeting Kei, Haruki decided a new rule to herself for using her ability: she will completely trust Kei and only use her Reset when Kei orders her.|$|R

The seismic dynamic {{responses}} on two buildings with the vibration isolation system {{have been evaluated}} and {{the results show that}} the dry friction plate-reset spring isolation system is apparently effective if the reasonable parameters could be obtained by optimization. The maximum inter-storey drift could be drastically decreased by about 80 % at base storey or about 60 % at top storey. The elastic coefficient of the <b>reset</b> <b>spring</b> should be larger than the lower limit in order for the effective reposition ability of the system. On the other hand, the influence of the vertical seismic action to the horizontal dynamic response is so small that it could be neglected...|$|R

In this paper, we give an efficient method to turn <b>a</b> general <b>Reset</b> Petri net into <b>a</b> λ-bisimilar normalized <b>Reset</b> Petri net. Our normalization preserves the main usually studied properties: boundedness, reachability, t-liveness and language (through a λ-labeling function).
