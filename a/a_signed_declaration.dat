50|$|LTS' offer a {{significant}} advantage over collective investment schemes. Collective investment schemes (or CIS or UCIS) come in many legal forms. What {{is common in}} each legal form is {{the existence of a}} shareholder register; according to the laws of most jurisdictions, an entry in the shareholder register must be accompanied by <b>a</b> <b>signed</b> <b>declaration</b> to invest. Equally, a transfer of shares in a collective investment scheme is usually not allowed without the signed consent of the company. These procedural requirements limit the ability of shareholders to trade their shares. A small subset of collective investment schemes are electronically tradable through stock exchanges (most notably REITs). However, the vast majority of collective investment schemes require these procedural steps.|$|E

50|$|Almost all charity shops sell {{on their}} unsold {{textiles}} (i.e. unfashionable, stained or damaged fabric) to textile processors. Each charity shop saves {{an average of}} 40 tonnes of textiles every year, by selling them in the shop, or passing them on to these textile merchants for recycling or reuse. This grosses to around 363,000 tonnes across all charity shops in the UK; based on 2010 landfill tax value at £48 per tonne, the value of textiles reused or passed for recycling by charity shops in terms of savings in landfill tax is £17,424,000 p.a.

50|$|After the Civil War, the KKE was outlawed {{and most}} of its {{prominent}} members had to flee Greece, go underground, or provide <b>a</b> <b>signed</b> <b>declaration</b> that they renounced communism to avoid prosecution under Law 504, issued in 1948, a large number of KKE members were either prosecuted, jailed or exiled. Prominent members of the KKE were tried and executed, including Nikos Beloyannis in 1952 and Nikos Ploumpidis in 1954. The execution of Ploumpidis was the last such execution by the post-Civil War governments. The fear of widespread reaction from left-wing citizens curbed further executions and eventually led to the gradual release of most political prisoners. In 1955 there were 4,498 political prisoners and 898 exiles; in 1962 there were 1,359 prisoners and 296 exiles. But under the prevailing anti-communist rules, communists and KKE sympathizers were barred from the public sector and lived under a repressive anticommunist surveillance system. Such discrimination against communists was partially relieved with the legalization of KKE in 1974, and the discrimination ended in the 1980s. During this period of illegality, the KKE supported the United Democratic Left (EDA) Party.|$|E

Brooks said, [...] "The jury sees this young black kid... this woman says, 'yeah, I think that's the guy,' and he goes away for twenty-three years." [...] Powell later testified that she had fabricated the story of Atkins’s confession. She recanted her testimony, saying that she had lied to police about the confession and had been afraid the lie would be revealed if she changed her story. In his decision, the judge stated that Powell’s recantation, together with the [...] "unreliable and changing eye-witness identification" [...] led him to believe that [...] "no reasonable judge or jury would have convicted Atkins."
