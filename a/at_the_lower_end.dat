5|$|After an {{announcement}} that profits would be <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>end</b> of analysts' forecasts due to falling sales and a share price fall of 20%, HMV Group indicated {{its intention to}} close a number of Waterstones branches in January 2011. These stores closures, including two in Dublin, Republic of Ireland and nine others across the United Kingdom occurred in February 2011. Further branch closures in Luton, Dorking, Lancaster University, Harrods, Gateshead and Norwich Arcade were completed {{by the end of}} 2011.|$|E
5|$|Then from {{at least}} 1.4million to 250,000years ago in Pleistocene time basaltic lava flowed {{intermittently}} in the area, taking advantage of uplift-created weaknesses in the Earth's crust. Volcanic activity was concentrated along the Hurricane Fault west of the park that today parallels Interstate 15. Evidence of the oldest flows {{can be seen at}} Lava Point and rocks from the youngest are found <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>end</b> of Cave Valley. Some cinder cones were constructed much later in the southwest corner of the park.|$|E

40|$|In this thesis, a novel 6 degree-of-freedom {{parallel}} {{mechanism is}} evaluated as a flight simulator motion base. The mechanism {{consists of three}} fixed-length legs, each supported by a three-wheeled mobile robot. The three legs support a platform, which acts as the end-effector of the mechanism. Thus, the mechanism {{has the advantage of}} portability and simple design, because of the specific actuating system. Two different designs are evaluated: one with ball joints <b>at</b> <b>the</b> upper ends of the legs and revolute joints <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>ends</b> and one with the opposite configuration. The inverse kinematics and inverse dynamics analysis of the mechanism, including its actuation system, is conducted. Our simulations lead us to conclude that the configuration with <b>the</b> ball joints <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>ends</b> of <b>the</b> legs performs better. The mechanism is then evaluated as a motion base for a flight simulator, using typical aircraft maneuvers. Certain problems are observed that make this application questionable. However, the mechanism shows potential as a motion base for a driving simulator, which is certainly worth exploring further...|$|R
5|$|Hemlock trees form {{a canopy}} over Big Wapwallopen Creek in some places. The Wapwallopen Gorge {{is listed as}} a Locally Significant site on the Luzerne County Natural Areas Inventory. Hemlock and yellow birch are common at the gorge's upper end. However, river birch and {{sycamore}} are more common <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>end</b> of the gorge. There are riparian forests along Big Wapwallopen Creek in the American Legion Post 781 land tract. The tract of land also contains some wet areas such as vernal pools and marshes. These areas provide breeding grounds for reptiles, amphibians, fish, and aquatic invertebrates.|$|E
5|$|In {{common with}} most suburbs of the Metropolitan Borough of Gateshead, its economy is {{dominated}} by the economies of Newcastle–upon–Tyne and Gateshead town centre. This is reflected in terms of independent commercial space; retail floor space in the suburb totals 1% of that available in the whole metropolitan borough. There are 33 retail units concentrated on Old Durham Road, which provide some employment, though these are <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>end</b> of the spectrum and provide little choice. There is a good provision of hardware stores, fast–food outlets and hairdressers, a butcher's shop, a greengrocer and a supermarket, but there is no bakery, bank nor building society and the Post Office has closed. The retail units were domestic properties, so many are too small for retail purposes and around 20% are vacant.|$|E
5|$|Providence {{is one of}} {{many cities}} claimed to be founded on seven hills like Rome. The more {{prominent}} hills are: Constitution Hill (near downtown), College Hill (east of the Providence River), and Federal Hill (west of downtown and containing New England's largest Italian district outside of Massachusetts). The other four are: Tockwotten Hill at Fox Point, Smith Hill (where the State House is located), Christian Hill at Hoyle Square (junction of Cranston and Westminster Streets), and Weybosset Hill <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>end</b> of Weybosset Street, which was leveled in the early 1880s.|$|E

5|$|The finder {{discovered}} the helmet and visor buried together some 25cm (10in) below the surface, {{at a site}} located on a ledge <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>end</b> of the settlement. It had been placed onto two stone slabs {{at the bottom of}} a hole which had been back-filled with soil. A stone cap had been laid on top. The helmet was found in 33 large fragments and 34 small fragments and had apparently been folded before burial. The visor was mostly intact and had been placed face down. The griffin had become detached and was found with the helmet. No other artefacts were found at the time, but the subsequent Tullie House/PAS excavations at the findspot discovered a number of copper and iron objects, a bead and two Roman coins dating to 330–337. The coins were found within the artificial stone feature in which the helmet had been deposited and may have been buried at the same time.|$|E
5|$|The {{grey-necked rockfowl}} is {{considered}} to be vulnerable due to habitat destruction, its isolated populations, collection of adults, predation, and a low breeding success rate. Its habitat is being destroyed to create large agricultural fields and cocoa plantations, as well as for logging and slash-and-burn agriculture. Due to the highly specialized requirements for its habitat, its population is very fragmented, and the species is believed to be naturally rare. Competition for its nesting sites is a result of these strict requirements and can lead to infanticide. Its estimated population is between 2,500 and 10,000 individuals, though it is believed that the population is <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>end</b> of the estimate. However, due to the inaccessibility of some parts of its range, {{it is also possible that}} this species is more common than believed. The population of some of these colonies is reaching the minimum levels needed for long-term viability. It also falls victim to spring traps set for mammals by hunters. However, a more serious threat to its numbers was the widespread collection of rockfowl for display in zoos in the 1950s and 1960s. There is a risk that it will be negatively affected by ecotourism due to disturbances in its daily routine if proper viewing procedures are not followed.|$|E
5|$|The thighbone is {{straight}} in front view. Seen {{from the same}} direction its head is perpendicular to the shaft, seen from above it is orientated 20° to the front. The greater trochanter is relatively wide and separated from the robust lesser trochanter in front of it, by a fissure. At the front base of the lesser trochanter a low accessory trochanter is present. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>end</b> of the thighbone a distinct front, extensor, groove separates the condyles. At the upper inner side of this groove a rough area is present continuing inwards into a longitudinal ridge, a typical megalosauroid trait. The shinbone, or tibia, is relatively straight, slightly curving inwards. To below, its shaft progressively flattens from front to rear, resulting in a generally oval cross-section. For about an eighth of its length the front {{lower end of the}} shaft is covered by a vertical branch of the astragalus. Of the foot, only the second, third and fourth metatarsals are known, the bone elements that were connected to the three weight-bearing toes. They are straight and robust, showing ligament pits at their lower sides. The third metatarsal has no clear condyles at its lower end, resulting in a more flexible joint, allowing for a modicum of horizontal movement. The top inner side of the third metatarsal carries a unique ridge that fits into a groove along the top outer side of the second metatarsal, causing a tighter connection.|$|E

The peninsula is 15 nautical miles (28 km) long and is situated <b>at</b> <b>the</b> extremity of the Pennell Coast portion of Victoria Land, lying between Cape Williams and Cape Adare. It was discovered in February 1911 when the Terra Nova of the British Antarctic Expedition, 1910-13, explored the area westward of Cape North, and it was named for William Williams, Chief Engine-room Artificer on the Terra Nova.|$|R

For the V-2 rocket, just reaching space but {{with a range of}} about 330 km, the maximum speed was 1.6 km/s. Scaled Composites SpaceShipTwo which is under development will have a similar free-fall orbit but the announced maximum speed is 1.1 km/s (perhaps because of engine shut-off at a higher altitude).|$|R
