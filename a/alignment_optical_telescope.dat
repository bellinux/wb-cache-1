50|$|The CM had a fixed sextant, the AOT, {{which could}} measure angles between stars and Earth or Moon {{landmarks}} and planetary horizons. The unit included a scanning telescope for star sightings, {{and could be}} used to determine position and orientation in space. In contrast, the LM had an <b>Alignment</b> <b>Optical</b> <b>Telescope,</b> and could only determine the craft's orientation. The outer element of the AOT was a sun-shielded prism that could be rotated to one of three fixed positions relative to the LM, in order to cover {{a large portion of the}} lunar sky. When rotated, the AOT's position was readable by the AGC; by pointing the reticule at several different stars, the computer could determine the craft's orientation http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/alsj/aot.htm.|$|E
5000|$|The Apollo Primary Guidance, Navigation and Control System (PGNCS) (pronounced pings) was a {{self-contained}} {{inertial guidance system}} that allowed Apollo spacecraft {{to carry out their}} missions when communications with Earth were interrupted, either as expected, when the spacecraft were behind the Moon, or in case of a communications failure. The Apollo Command Module (CM) and Lunar Module (LM), were each equipped with a version of PGNCS. PGNCS, and specifically its computer, were also the command center for all system inputs from the LM, including the Kollsman Instrument built <b>Alignment</b> <b>Optical</b> <b>Telescope,</b> the radar system, the manual Translation and Rotation device inputs by the astronauts as well as other inputs from the LM systems.|$|E
50|$|Internal {{equipment}} {{included an}} environmental control (life support) system; a VHF communications system with two antennas for {{communication with the}} Command Module; a unified S-band system and steerable parabolic dish antenna for communication with Earth; an EVA antenna resembling a miniature parasol which relayed communications from antennas on the astronauts' Portable Life Support Systems through the LM; primary (PGNCS) and backup (AGS) guidance and navigation systems; an <b>Alignment</b> <b>Optical</b> <b>Telescope</b> for visually determining the spacecraft orientation; rendezvous radar with its own steerable dish antenna; and an ice sublimation system for active thermal control. Electrical storage batteries, cooling water, and breathing oxygen were stored in amounts sufficient for a lunar surface stay of 48 hours initially, extended to 75 hours for the later missions.|$|E
40|$|The work {{presented}} in this paper concerns the on-orbit <b>alignment</b> between an <b>optical</b> <b>telescope</b> and star trackers, with an application to the Asteroid Finder mission. The presented work utilizes the background stars which appear in the telescope �eld of view (FOV) to get more accurate attitude information and to better align the star trackers with the telescope. The on- orbit alignment between the telescope coordinate frame and the star trackers' coordinate frames should be determined to within tenths of an arcsecond in order to achieve the required precision in the attitude of the measured stars in the telescope FOV. The measured raw star data from the telescope charge- coupled device (CCD) at di�erent measurement frequencies will also be used for the further spacecraft attitude improvement...|$|R
40|$|The NASA Kuiper Airborne Observatory (KAO) {{was flown}} three times during June and July, 1984 {{in order to}} study {{the causes of the}} poor seeing {{obtained}} with the 0. 9 -m telescope. High-speed pressure and temperature sensors were placed in the telescope cavity. Several thousand stellar images were recorded under various flight and optical configurations. It is found that the long-exposure image size is affected by telescope tracking errors, imperfect optics, poor <b>optical</b> <b>alignment,</b> <b>telescope</b> and instrument vibration, thermal fluctuations in the telescope cavity, and density fluctuations in the shear layer that forms the boundary between the cavity air and outside air. Possible ways {{to improve the quality of}} the images are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The Gemini {{primary mirror}} support {{incorporates}} {{a system of}} hydraulic whiffletrees to carry the mirror weight and define its position. The six orthogonal kinematic degrees of freedom are controlled by six hydraulic zones [...] three axial, two lateral, plus a transverse lateral. By varying the fluid volumes in these hydraulic zones the mirror position can be adjusted in all six degrees of freedom. Because of the finite lengths of the linkages that connect the mirror to the lateral supports, any shift in mirror position changes the amplitudes and directions of the applied forces with a resulting effect on the static balance and mirror figure. These effects have been calculated for mirror translations and rotations in all six degrees of freedom, resulting in predictions {{of the changes in}} the axial and lateral support forces and in the mirror figure. This paper describes the modeling as well as experimental verification of the results. Key words: lateral support, support force optimization, mirror figure, <b>optical</b> <b>alignment,</b> large <b>telescopes</b> 1...|$|R
