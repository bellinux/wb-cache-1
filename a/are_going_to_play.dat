5|$|The story {{opens on}} Sunday May 13, 2007, {{and the next}} day at school, Kyousuke decides that the Little Busters <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> a {{baseball}} game, except they do not have enough members to have a complete team. Kyousuke gives Riki and Rin the task of going around school to find more members to join, preferably girls so as not to leave Rin the lone girl. Riki finds five girls his age willing to help him out: Komari Kamikita, Haruka Saigusa, Kudryavka Noumi, Yuiko Kurugaya, and Mio Nishizono; three other girls Riki meets are Kanata Futaki, Sasami Sasasegawa, and Saya Tokido. Throughout the game, Riki hangs out with these girls and learns more about them.|$|E
500|$|Jones, {{who played}} Les, {{revealed}} that the runaway storyline was tough on him and he began crying when he read the script. He continued [...] "The four {{of us in the}} Battersby family read our scripts together to work out how we <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> our parts. On this occasion, all four of us were sobbing. It is not like a normal Coronation Street story, it's more like a Taggart or a Cracker." [...] Jones thought the [...] "scrapes" [...] that Toyah found herself in were frightening and hoped that if the storyline could stop one teenager from running away from home, then it would be worthwhile. The storyline attracted the attention of the Independent Television Commission, who believed that the episode featuring Toyah's abduction should have carried a warning before it was broadcast.|$|E
500|$|American {{horse race}} caller Trevor Denman guest {{starred in the}} episode as himself, commentating on Duncan's races over the public-address system. Randy Bachman and Fred Turner, known for their rock band Bachman–Turner Overdrive, made an {{appearance}} in the episode as themselves. They perform on stage at the state fair during {{the beginning of the}} episode. When Bachman and Turner tell the audience that they <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> some songs from their new album, Homer immediately yells out demands for them to play their old song [...] "Takin' Care of Business". The band starts the song and Homer then yells, [...] "Get to the 'workin overtime' part!" [...] The band obliges, skipping straight to the chorus. Bachman had left the band when [...] "Saddlesore Galactica" [...] was recorded and because of tension between him and Turner, the two recorded their lines separately on different occasions. Long has said that the Simpsons staff members [...] "were thrilled to have [...] on the show" [...] and that the pair [...] "could not have been nicer." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{gameplay}} received mixed reviews. Both Bertz and Griffin {{criticized the}} game's incompetent hit detection system, {{which made the}} experience unfair. Bertz described the game's gunplay as [...] "servicable", while Leack noticed a delay in shooting, which drags the game's pace and leads to a steep learning curve. However, Leack appreciated the game's map design, which opened many possibilities. He also praised its attention to detail and sound design, which can often make a multiplayer match feel like a [...] "great action film". Bertz was disappointed {{by the lack of}} customization options, which did not offer long-term progression for the players. Butterworth similarly criticized the progression system for being slow. As players cannot play as the same operator in the same match, he was often forced to play as the generic [...] "recruit" [...] character when he was only at the beginning stage of the game. He also criticized the limited weapon customization options, which barely affect gameplay. McCaffery described customization as the [...] "least interesting" [...] aspect of the game, and claimed that most gameplay features were locked when players started playing. Griffin, Gies, and Steven Burns from VideoGamer.com were annoyed by the microtransactions featured in the game, with Griffin describing it as a greedy attempt by Ubisoft to make more money, though Davenport did not mind these features as they were limited to cosmetic items and could be unlocked through earning Renown. Bertz was annoyed the lack of clan infrastructure, which may cause players troubles when they were finding matches, while Griffin thought that map rotation often felt random and was disappointed that players cannot vote to decide which map they <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> next.|$|E
