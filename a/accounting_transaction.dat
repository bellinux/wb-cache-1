It is therefore crucial to have rigorous and scientific approaches for measuring, modelling and forecasting accounting numbers. Dr Falta's research was motivated by two observations. Firstly, in accounting practice, decision-making often relies on subjective quantifications and forecasts of business activities and, thus, does not account for uncertainty in a rational way. Secondly, there are some academic foundations for statistical approaches to accounting, yet none has been developed carefully enough for results to penetrate and to contribute to practitioners' needs. Dr Falta applied components of mathematics, statistics, econometrics, finance and computing to aspects of accounting and auditing. He developed an enhanced framework for scientific measurement of business process costing and recording <b>accounting</b> <b>transaction</b> data. This has enabled a better understanding of risk in accounting-based decision-making. His research is being incorporated in projects with the Royal Australian Navy and SunWater...|$|E

The purpose of the paper is to bring newer and modern management techniques to light, such as TQM, the Balanced Scorecard, Activity Based Accounting, Target Costing and Just-in-Time (JIT). These tools really help management accounting to reduce <b>accounting</b> <b>transaction</b> and to find more approximate cost of product in detail showing participation of every department and much more help in budget process and revenue recording for each department. The traditional management accounting tools, e. g. Budgeting, Standard Costing, Cost Volume Profit CVP) analysis and financial performance measurement are also very useful but to work with today’s customer focused environment and to measure the financial and non financial performance of the organization, less cost, more revenue and performance, the process oriented management accounting techniques are more useful...|$|E

The study responds to researchers’ call for additional research on topics related to accounting decision ethics. Modified managerial and accounting recognition scenarios were used to collect the acceptability of ethical judgments. The analysis employs factor analysis to affirm whether the scenarios are mana­gerial or accounting recognition decisions. The analyses further divides the managerial decisions into either revenue or expense related. The accounting recognition decisions are further divided into those involving an accounting manipulation or inventory related. Students’ acceptability of the accounting transactions was far harsher than the practitioners. However, both students and practitioners considered the accounting scenarios to be unethical. Both students and practitioners judged the managerial revenue scenarios to be ethical but the managerial expense scenarios to be moderately unethical. In addition to the ethical acceptability of <b>accounting</b> <b>transaction,</b> student and practitioner demographic data including age, work experience and academic credentials are investigated to explain the differences...|$|E

40|$|Since the {{promulgation}} of the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), the IFRS {{has been}} adopted as the definitive accounting standard {{by a number of}} jurisdictions, most notably within the EU. The most significant country that has not yet adopted the IFRS is the United States which has had a tradition of strong accounting standards {{in the form of the}} US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (US GAAP). IFRS and US GAAP have significantly different approaches towards regulation with IFRS taking a principles-based approach towards regulation while US GAAP has traditionally been rules-based in its approach. In practice, this means that IFRS tends to be shorter than US GAAP. The US GAAP relies on bright-line tests and explicitly stated industry-based exceptions towards classification, measurement, and impairment rules while the IFRS focuses mostly on the economic effects of transactions rather than explicitly stated tests or the legal form of the accounting event. This study reviews the similarities and discrepancies between the accounting treatment of leases and financial assets between the recently announced IFRS and US GAAP accounting standards. Through a comparison of the regulations related to each <b>accounting</b> <b>transaction,</b> this study concludes that the prospects for convergence between IFRS and the US GAAP are weak. This is because there are significant signs that the US GAAP remains rules-based in its approach, which suggests the possibility that companies will have to maintain two sets of accounts if they were simultaneously active in both regions...|$|E

40|$|After {{the near}} {{collapse}} of the global financial system in 2008, much of the debate has focused on credit and asset valuation, as well as liquidity issues in the financial sector. Emphasis has been on debt and balance sheet quality, but little {{focus has been on}} the cash flow statements of banks. The statement of cash flows is designed to illustrate financial strength and liquidity with information about operations, investment and financing. Cash flow statements generally show operational stability and funding, outflow and inflow of cash, as important factors of firm’s financial resilience. In this respect banks are different and their cash flow statements are simply not used. The aim of this thesis is to study how cash flow statements of banks are different from non-financial firms to understand why they are not used. This includes research on how the accounting standard functions for banks and identify special issues of cash flows in banks. Four studies are used to gather evidence and evaluations of the accounting framework and the financial statements in order to describe facts and interpret bankers’ opinions. The big Scandinavian banks are selected as study objects and thirty bankers interviewed. Historical comment letters are analysed as well as fourteen years of financial statements. The accounting rules for banks and cash flow are described in the first study. The second study concerns the accounting regulation process and confirms that prior to the standard setting, bankers warned that it would not function in banks. Long-term financial statement analysis in the third study illustrates the negative operative cash flow in the banks over a decade. The final study, interviewing bankers about the cash flow in banks, confirms that none of them uses the statement and they have never been asked about it. The main findings indicate that standard cash flow statements do not work for banks because banks’ operations are different from non-financial firms with respect to cash. The reason why bankers do not use the statements is that they do not consider the information provided to be relevant. The results furthermore indicate that the cash flow statements of banks are not used because the existing accounting standard does not consider the credit creation function in banks. This is exemplified in the negative operative cash flow during periods of lending growth. Banks are different from other firms and the reporting of banks’ cash flows functions differently because cash is their product and they create deposits on their balance sheet when providing loans to their customers. The <b>accounting</b> <b>transaction</b> of lending does not involve any prior funding or cash inflow, but occurs in the accounting system, creating deposit as a liability and loan as an asset of the bank. These results contribute to the debate needed in accounting and banking about useful cash flow statements for banks and provide an overview to prepare new accounting regime...|$|E
