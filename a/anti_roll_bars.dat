50|$|On {{the four}} wheel drive GSi, 4x4 and Turbo models, the rear {{suspension}} is a subframe mounted fully independent design, with semi-trailing arms, double conical coil springs, direct acting gas assisted telescopic shock absorbers, and an <b>anti</b> <b>roll</b> <b>bar.</b> Steering gear is a rack and pinion type (manual or power assisted, depending on model), mounted on the bulkhead (firewall), with a telescopically deformable steering column.|$|R
50|$|Slightly {{larger and}} {{heavier than the}} later Striker it had a small boot {{accessible}} via {{the rear of the}} cockpit so if a full roll cage was fitted little could be carried. The front suspension was twin wishbones without an <b>anti</b> <b>roll</b> <b>bar</b> with a live rear axle with a 4-point location system. This worked surprisingly well due to the low centre of gravity.|$|R
5000|$|The front {{suspension}} {{was fully}} independent, with MacPherson struts, pressed steel lower control arms, and an anti-roll bar. The front suspension, {{together with the}} major mechanicals (engine and transmission) is remotely mounted on a front subframe. On front wheel drive models, the rear suspension is semi independent, consisting of a torsion beam axle linked to trailing arms, with double conical coil springs and direct acting telescopic hydraulic shock absorbers, with certain models also having an <b>anti</b> <b>roll</b> <b>bar.</b>|$|R
50|$|Ambassador Grand was {{launched}} in 2003 and as per the manufacturer, the new version had 137 changes compared to its predecessor. The notable changes included body coloured wrap around bumpers, camel coloured interiors, fabric seats, remote shift gear lever, moulded roof and door trims, Salisbury axles, bigger rear wheel drums, improved suspension with <b>anti</b> <b>roll</b> <b>bar</b> and Metlon bushes, central door lock, factory fitted music system and an optional sun roof.

The Grand version of Ambassador was available only in 2.0L and 1.8L engines at first and later in 2007 the 1.5L model {{was added to the}} line.|$|R
5000|$|The 2993 cc {{engine was}} again uprated, now {{producing}} [...] mainly by an improved cylinder head {{and increasing the}} compression ratio from 8.0:1 to 8.5:1. A new four speed gearbox from the Austin-Healey appeared and Borg Warner three speed automatic transmission was offered. Overdrive was available on the manual transmission from late 1960 to 1962. Suspension {{was similar to the}} TC 21, independent at the front using coil springs with leaf springs at the rear but the track was increased by 1 in to 55.5 in and a front <b>anti</b> <b>roll</b> <b>bar</b> added. Wire spoked wheels became an option. From 1959 the all drum brake set up was changed to discs at the front retaining drums at the rear.|$|R

The convertible hood now has a [...] "Panoramic" [...] rear window and the seat mechanism is improved for better accessibility.|$|R
5000|$|The Chopper's patent {{was applied}} for in the US in 1967. The Chopper was {{introduced}} at American trade shows in January 1969 {{but it was not}} until April 1969 when Raleigh Choppers were available for public to purchase. The bike featured a choice of a single-speed coaster hub, or a 3-speed or 5-speed Sturmey Archer gear hub, selected using a frame-mounted console gear lever — one of its [...] "cool" [...] features. Other features that appealed to the youth market were the unusual frame, long padded high-back seat, sprung seat at the back, high-rise (ape hanger) handlebars, 'bobbed' mudguards (fenders) and differently sized wheels — 16 in front and 20 in rear. The rear hoop above the seat resembled a dragster <b>anti</b> <b>roll</b> <b>bar</b> [...] "sissy bar". Even the kickstand was designed to give the stationary bicycle a lean reminiscent of a parked motorcycle. Tyres were wider than usual for the time, with a chunky tread on the rear wheel, featuring a red line around the sidewall.|$|R
5000|$|The Challenge Stradale was a later {{addition}} to the line-up, the finale model before replacement. It was essentially a lightened, factory tuned version of the Modena {{with many of the}} Modena's optional extras becoming standard. Carbon seats, racing exhaust, carbon engine bay, and so on. Famously at the time Ferrari claimed it dropped up to 110 kg over the stock Modena helping to improve its handling. Many other chassis optimizations were carried out too such as stiffer titanium springs (lowering unsprung weight), stiffer bushings and an updated rear <b>anti</b> <b>roll</b> <b>bar</b> (the same anti-roll bar as used on the 430 Scuderia) along with a remapped active suspension computer. Changes also included larger 19" [...] BBS wheels, the use of carbon fiber for the frames of the seats and mirrors, titanium springs which were also 20% stiffer, and Carbon fiber-reinforced Silicon Carbide (C/SiC) ceramic composite disc brakes. A variety of options allowed for further weight reductions, including replacing the leather interior with fabric, removal of the power windows and mirrors, and deletion of the stereo. Lexan side windows were available in Europe only but everywhere else got the Lexan rear cover. It was officially introduced in March 2003 at the Geneva International Motor Show and went into production shortly thereafter. The CS can be compared to Porsche's GT3 RS model in design approach and many magazines have placed them head-to-head in road tests.|$|R

50|$|A <b>roll</b> <b>bar</b> is {{a single}} bar behind the driver that {{provides}} moderate roll-over protection. Due {{to the lack of}} a protective top, some modern convertibles utilize a strong windscreen frame acting as a <b>roll</b> <b>bar.</b> Also, a <b>roll</b> hoop may be placed behind both headrests (usually one on older cars), which is essentially a <b>roll</b> <b>bar</b> spanning the width of a passenger's shoulders.|$|R
