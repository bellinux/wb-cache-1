However, the first International meeting in 1987 was the initial round of the Intercontinental F3000 Championship on 12 April. The race was run at 103.96mph, the winner being Maurício Gugelmin in a Ralt from Michel Trollé in a Lola and Roberto Moreno aboard another Ralt.|$|E
2500|$|Pete's {{original}} character outline {{as written}} by Smith and Holland appeared in an abridged form in their book, : [...] "Pete runs a fruit and veg stall in the market....married very young to Pat (Pam St. Clement) - It {{turned out to}} be a total disaster. They were too young, rushing into a difficult life for all the wrong reasons, and truthfully, his wife was a vicious shrew ... he divorced his wife and married Kathy (Gillian Taylforth) when he was 24 ... Ian [...] (Adam Woodyatt) was born a year later. It took Kathy and Pete about ten years to woo [...] Lou (Anna Wing) round to the idea of their marriage, and she can still sometimes be a bit cutting about it.... She doesn't believe in divorce ... He did have crazy dreams of making something of himself, he was going to be [...] singer, a red-coat, run his own hotel ... On special occasions it's always Pete who's the life and soul of the party.... His two sons by his first marriage are nineteen and twenty and he hardly sees them.... If it wasn't for Thatcher, he'd consider voting Tory.... Never works on the anniversary of his dad's death, and with [...] Pauline (Wendy Richard), escorts his mum to the cemetery. He has a good relationship with Kathy, emotionally and sexually (Maybe he's <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>concerned</b> that she's keeping her good looks a bit longer than he is?).|$|E
6000|$|I made no {{delay in}} going toward him, and fancied {{he looked more}} than <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>concerned</b> that I should have {{appeared}} so suddenly, all of which went to strengthen my belief {{that this was the}} man whom we were seeking, therefore without juggling words, I asked him: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I suspect him to be," [...] Harcutt said slowly, [...] "a most {{important}} and interesting personage. I have learnt <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>concerning</b> him. I am here to learn more; I am convinced that it is worth while." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A most {{sweet and}} eloquent answer, Pierre; but sit down again. I desire now to say <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>concerning</b> less attractive, but quite {{necessary}} things connected with this affair. You know, that by your father's will, these lands and--" ...|$|R
60|$|A {{more humane}} {{man would have}} shown <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>concern</b> as to his benefactor's sleeping-place; but the captain never gave the matter a thought. In fact, {{it was not until}} three days later that he {{discovered}} there was a spare bunk in the forecastle, and that the unscrupulous seaman was occupying it.|$|R
60|$|I shewed myself <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>concerned</b> and uneasy at this account, and inquired {{of the old}} captain, how it came to pass, {{that the}} {{trustees}} should thus dispose of my effects, when he knew that I had made my will, and had made him, the Portuguese captain, my universal heir, &c.|$|E
60|$|All {{this while}} I was very uneasy, as I said before, {{and yet the}} whole story went off again without any discovery, only that I seemed <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>concerned</b> that she should liken me to this gay lady, whose {{character}} I pretended to run down very much, even upon the foot of her own relation.|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear man, {{it is my}} very thought," [...] says he. [...] "You see, I {{have just}} been set on shore here by a very honest man, whose name I cannot remember, and who is to stand {{off and on for}} me till morning, at some danger to himself; and, to be clear with you, I am <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>concerned</b> lest it should be at some to me.

6000|$|... "I owe {{you very}} much, my good friend," [...] said he to the officer, [...] "for your timely assistance. To be frank, {{what you have}} just told me has indeed perplexed me not <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>concerning</b> the place where I {{proposed}} to stop.

6000|$|He {{would have}} been tempted {{to believe that the}} cabman was amusing himself by driving him round and round and in and out about a small quarter, but there was {{something}} business-like in the speed which convinced him of the contrary. The man had an object in view, he was hastening towards a definite end; and Brackenbury was at once astonished at the fellow's skill in picking a way through such a labyrinth, and <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>concerned</b> to imagine what was the occasion of his hurry. He had heard tales of strangers falling ill in London. Did the driver belong to some bloody and treacherous association? and was he himself being whirled to a murderous death? ...|$|E

60|$|I came away, vastly {{pleased to}} have my peace made, yet <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>concerned</b> in conscience; nor could I help wondering, as I went back, whether, perhaps, I {{had not been a}} scruple too good-natured. But there was the fact, that this was a man that might have been my father, an able man, a great dignitary, and one that, in the hour of my need, had reached a hand to my assistance. I was in the better humour to enjoy the {{remainder}} of that evening, which I passed with the advocates, in excellent company no doubt, but perhaps with rather more than a sufficiency of punch: for though I went early to bed I have no clear mind of how I got there.|$|E
60|$|At six in {{the morning}} they got under way, the boy going nearly frantic with delight as sail after sail was set, and the ketch, with a stiff breeze, rapidly left London behind her. Mr. Brown studiously ignored him, but the other men pampered him to his heart’s content, and even the cabin was good enough to {{manifest}} <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>concern</b> in his welfare, the skipper calling Mr. Brown up no fewer than five times that day to complain about his son’s behaviour.|$|R
40|$|Although many {{research}} {{efforts have been}} devoted to the network congestion against an increase of the Internet traffic, there has been <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>concern</b> on improvement {{of the performance of}} Internet hosts in spite of the projection that the bottleneck is now being shifted from the network to hosts.

[...] "Why," [...] says she, [...] "it is easy to suppose that thou art <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>concerned</b> at somewhat those men say; I suppose they are talking of thee." [...] "Indeed, my good friend," [...] said I, [...] "thou art mistaken this time, for I know very well what they are talking of, but 'tis all about ships and trading affairs."

6000|$|... "As {{to my own}} part, I am not <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>concerned</b> at this unfortunate incident. As it was {{impossible}} to foresee this fit of madness in the King of Prussia, there was no guarding against it: and after it had happened, I thought I could do no less than resent it in the manner I have done,--without prostituting the character with which the King has been pleased to honor me. I hope, however, this affair will be attended with no ill consequences: for the King of Prussia himself is at present so ashamed of his behavior, that he says, He will order Count Degenfeld [Graf von Degenfeld, going at a leisurely pace to remove NOSTI from his perch among you] [Supra, p. 197.] to hasten his journey to England, with orders to endeavor to make up the affair immediately.|$|E
60|$|Anyhow, it {{continued}} to devour a good many young shoots while our travellers were peeping at it in mute surprise through the bushes. That they had approached so near without being observed {{was due to the}} fact that a brawling rapid flowed just there, and the mias was on the other side of the stream. By mutual consent the men crouched to watch its proceedings. They were not <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>concerned,</b> however, when the brute seized an overhanging bough, and, with what we may style sluggish agility, swung itself clumsily but lightly to their side of the stream. It picked up the Durian which lay there and began to devour it. Biting off some of the strong spikes with which that charming fruit is covered, it made a small hole in it, and then with its powerful fingers tore off the thick rind and began to enjoy a feast.|$|E
60|$|The wedding-day {{came and}} passed; {{and she was}} a Duchess. Nobody seemed to think of the ousted man during the day, or else those who thought of him {{concealed}} their meditations. Some of the less subservient ones were disposed to speak in a jocular manner of the august husband and wife, others to make correct and pretty speeches about them, according as their sex and nature dictated. But in the evening, the ringers in the belfry, with whom Alwyn had been a favourite, eased their minds <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>concerning</b> the gentle young man, and the possible regrets of the woman he had loved.|$|R

6000|$|I {{perceived}} by this {{that he knew}} nothing of the miserable circumstances I was in, and thought that, having got some intelligence of his being there, I had come to upbraid him with his leaving me. But I {{had too much to}} say to him to be affronted, and told him in few words, that I was far from coming to insult him, but at best I came to condole mutually; that he would be easily satisfied that I had no such view, when I should tell him that my condition was worse than his, and that many ways. He looked <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>concerned</b> at the general expression of my condition being worse than his, but, with a kind smile, looked a little wildly, and said, 'How can that be? When you see me fettered, and in Newgate, and two of my companions executed already, can you can your condition is worse than mine?' ...|$|E
6000|$|At the {{mentioning}} the word pirates, my countenance turned {{to that of}} scarlet; nor was it {{possible for me to}} conceal it from the old pilot; who was taking notice of it, Sir, said he take what course you please, I'll do you all the service I can. [...] "Seignior," [...] said I, [...] "I am <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>concerned</b> at your mentioning pirates; I hope there are none such in these seas, because you see in what weak condition we are to defend ourselves." [...] O, Sir, said he, if that's all, don't be concerned, I don't remember one in these seas these fifteen years, except above a month ago one was seen in the bay of Siam, but he is gone to the southward; neither was she built for a privateer, but was run away with by a reprobate Captain, and some of his men, the right Captain having been murdered by the Malayans.|$|E
60|$|But {{the good}} conduct of Babo, {{hardly more than}} the ill-behavior of others, seemed to {{withdraw}} the half-lunatic Don Benito from his cloudy languor. Not that such precisely was the impression made by the Spaniard on the mind of his visitor. The Spaniard's individual unrest was, for the present, but noted as a conspicuous feature in the ship's general affliction. Still, Captain Delano was not <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>concerned</b> at what {{he could not help}} taking for the time to be Don Benito's unfriendly indifference towards himself. The Spaniard's manner, too, conveyed a sort of sour and gloomy disdain, which he seemed at no pains to disguise. But this the American in charity ascribed to the harassing effects of sickness, since, in former instances, he had noted that there are peculiar natures on whom prolonged physical suffering seems to cancel every social instinct of kindness; as if, forced to black bread themselves, they deemed it but equity that each person coming nigh them should, indirectly, by some slight or affront, be made to partake of their fare.|$|E
60|$|I {{know the}} answer is ready. Get Christ and go to heaven. But methinks {{the height of the}} place, and the glory of the state that we are to enjoy therein, should <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>concern</b> us, at least so as to make us wonder in our thinking, that the time is coming that we must mount up thither. And since there are so many heights between this place, between us, and that; it should make us admire at the heights of the grace and mercy of God, by which, means is {{provided}} to bring us thither. And I believe that this thing, this very thing, is included here by the Apostle when he prays for the Ephesians, that they might know the height.|$|R

6000|$|And immediately, {{at a pace}} of {{surprising}} swiftness, the hansom {{drove off}} through the rain into a maze of villas.

60|$|I am {{therefore}} <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>concerned</b> {{to perceive}} the spirit and temper in which the debate has been all along pursued upon {{one side of the}} House. The declamation of the gentlemen who oppose the bill has been abundant and vehement; but they have been reserved and even silent about the fitness or unfitness of the plan to attain the direct object it has in view. By some gentlemen it is taken up (by way of exercise, I presume) as a point of law, on a question of private property and corporate franchise; by others it is regarded as the petty intrigue of a faction at court, and argued merely as it tends to set this man a little higher or that a little lower in situation and power. All the void has been filled up with invectives against coalition, with allusions to the loss of America, with the activity and inactivity of ministers. The total silence of these gentlemen concerning the interest and well-being of the people of India, and concerning the interest which this nation has in the commerce and revenues of that country, is a strong indication of the value which they set upon these objects.|$|E
60|$|Julian, {{with deep}} anxiety, soon heard {{enough to make}} him aware that the meeting was likely to {{terminate}} in open insurrection, like that of the Fifth-Monarchy men, under Venner, at an earlier period of Charles's reign; and he was not <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>concerned</b> at the probability of Bridgenorth being implicated in so criminal and desperate an undertaking. If he had retained any doubts of the issue of the meeting, they must have been removed when the preacher called on his hearers to renounce all expectation which had hitherto been entertained of safety to the nation, from the execution of the ordinary laws of the land. This, he said, was at best but a carnal seeking after earthly aid--a going down to Egypt for help, which the jealousy of their Divine Leader would resent as a fleeing to another rock, and a different banner, from that which was this day displayed over them.--And here he solemnly swung the bannered lion over their heads, as the only sign under which they ought to seek for life and safety. He then proceeded to insist, that recourse to ordinary justice was vain as well as sinful.|$|E
