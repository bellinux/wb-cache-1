500|$|Overmars was {{selected}} in the squad for the 1998 World Cup, staged in France. Before the tournament began, he scored two goals in a friendly against Paraguay. He was on the scoresheet in the national team's 5–0 win against South Korea in the group stage. As the tournament progressed, Overmars felt the Netherlands were [...] "getting better and better" [...] and believed they could win the World Cup: [...] "Believe me, we can do it. In the past, {{there has been so}} much talk about our side and a lot of pressure with people calling us favourites. This time, nobody seemed to expect anything. In fact, people would come up to me in the street <b>and</b> <b>say</b> <b>we</b> were only dark horses to win." [...] While training before the quarter-final match against Argentina, he sustained an injury which seemingly ruled him out of contention. He did feature late into the game as a substitute, but aggravated his injury. He was subsequently forced to sit out the entire semi-final against Brazil, which the Netherlands lost on penalties.|$|E
500|$|Eric B. and Rakim met in 1985 after Eric B. {{looked for}} a rapper to {{complement}} his turntable work at the New York City radio station WBLS. After Rakim responded to Eric B.'s search for [...] "New York's top MC", Eric B's friend and roommate Marley Marl allowed him to use his home studio. The first track they recorded, [...] "Eric B. Is President", was released as a single on the independent Zakia Records in 1986. After Def Jam Recordings founder Russell Simmons heard the single, the duo were signed to Island Records and began recording the album in Manhattan's Power Play Studios in early 1987. Rakim wrote his songs in approximately one hour while listening to the beat. He then recorded his vocals in the booth by reading his lyrics from a paper. In 2006, Rakim revealed, [...] "When I hear my first album today I hear myself reading my rhymes but I'm my worst critic." [...] The duo completed the album in one week. They {{have said that they}} worked in 48-hour shifts and recorded in single takes in order complete the album within budget. In a 2008 interview with AllHipHop, Eric B. stated, [...] "o sit here <b>and</b> <b>say</b> <b>we</b> put together this calculated album to be a great album would be a lie. We were just doing records that felt good." ...|$|E

2500|$|A {{television}} series titled Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles aired on the Fox network, with Lena Headey as Sarah Connor and Thomas Dekker as John Connor. The series, created by Josh Friedman, centers on Sarah and John after Terminator 2 {{as they try}} to [...] "live under the radar" [...] after the explosion at Cyberdyne. Summer Glau plays a Terminator protecting the Connors. Executive producer James Middleton said the series would contain a link to Terminator Salvation but that film's director, McG, later said Friedman [...] "was the first to jump on <b>and</b> <b>say</b> <b>we</b> can't chase their story threads." ...|$|E

When {{we got to}} the amendment phase, we would offer our program as a substitute for the Johnson proposal. If we lost in the Committee of the Whole, then we would usually offer it as a motion to recommit and get a vote on that. And if we lost on the motion to recommit, our Republican members had a choice: They could vote against the Johnson program <b>and</b> <b>say</b> <b>we</b> did our best {{to come up with a}} better alternative. Or they could vote for it and make the same argument. Usually we lost; but when you're only 140 out of 435, you don't expect to win many.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the grand}} jury hearing on the next day, Nye County Judge Mark R. Averill denied bail, as Mircovich's case {{involved}} capital murder. George B. Thatcher was Mircovich's court-appointed attorney, but had to leave town on June 1, 1912 for the Democratic State Convention in Fallon. Averill then appointed Patrick M. Bowler on behalf of Mircovich until Thatcher returned on June 5. The case was prosecuted by District Attorney Sanders. Witnesses testified that Mircovich had made threats against Gregovich's life, and was once thrown out of Gregovich's business premises. In his closing statement Sanders challenged the all-male jury to have the [...] "manhood" [...] to [...] "defend the law of my country and its liberty-loving people" [...] or else [...] "we {{might just as well}} dynamite this old courthouse. We might just as well take his Honor off the bench <b>and</b> <b>say</b> <b>we</b> have no law in Nye County." ...|$|E

2500|$|Senator Dorgan {{was one of}} {{only eight}} members of the Senate to vote against the repeal of key {{provisions}} of the Glass-Steagall Act (contained in the Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act) in 1999. During debate on that 1999 legislation, in a speech on the Senate floor, he said that, [...] "it will in my judgement raise the likelihood of future massive taxpayer bailouts" [...] (cited in John Lanacaster, Whoops, London, 2010, p.161). On September 26, 2008, against a backdrop of growing economic turmoil caused by the Credit Crunch, David Leonhardt of The New York Times singled out a quotation made by Dorgan in 1999 during the US Senate's repeal of the Glass–Steagall Act. [...] "I think we will look back in 10 years’ time <b>and</b> <b>say</b> <b>we</b> should not have done this, but we did because we forgot the lessons of the past, and that that which is true in the 1930s is true in 2010." ...|$|E
