5|$|Willis was {{involved}} in the 1850 divorce suit between the actor Edwin Forrest and his wife Catherine Norton Sinclair Forrest. In January 1849, Forrest had found <b>a</b> <b>love</b> <b>letter</b> to his wife from fellow actor George W. Jamieson. As a result, he and Catherine separated in April 1849. He moved to Philadelphia and filed for divorce in February 1850 though the Pennsylvania legislature denied his application. Catharine went to live with the family of Parke Godwin and the separation became a public affair, with newspapers throughout New York reporting on supposed infidelities and other gossip.|$|E
5|$|While solving cases, Lili {{eventually}} learns from Hiromi's elder sister, , that Hiromi's allergy {{to girls}} resulted from her: ten years ago, he {{waited in the}} rain for Lili to show after he left her <b>a</b> <b>love</b> <b>letter.</b> Lili encounters , a fortuneteller and hypnotist who kidnaps her father. After Hiromi rescues him, Zeus takes Hiromi captive and demands the star ring in exchange. Realizing that Sirius is her missing mother, Lili frees her from Zeus's hypnosis. Lili learns that her mother disappeared to protect her family from Zeus, who hates Sirius, as he believes that she kidnapped his girlfriend and caused her to become comatose. Lili uncovers the truth: his girlfriend feared that he desired the star ring more than her love and asked Sirius to stage a kidnapping and have him decide between her or the star ring. When he hesitated, she was devastated and threw herself off the cliff. After learning this, Zeus loses his desire for the star ring and lets Lili, Hiromi, and Lili's mother leave. Lili accepts Hiromi's love for her. In the conclusion, Lili's mother takes over her fortune-telling business, and Lili continues to solve crimes with Hiromi's assistance.|$|E
5|$|Sakura's most {{well-known}} physical characteristic is her broad forehead. Consequently, {{because of this}} Kishimoto at times focuses too much effort on drawing it in scenes or promotional artwork where Sakura is featured prominently. This results in her forehead appearing too large. When designing Sakura in her Part II appearance, Kishimoto decided to change her clothes to a more lively karate suit style. The upper part, though, still has a Chinaesque feeling to it, {{so as to make}} her more feminine. During Part II's last story arc, Kishimoto tried making Sakura look more beautiful, most notably when she joins Naruto and Sasuke in the final fight against the creature Ten Tails. Due to Sakura having little popularity within readers, Kishimoto thought a popular fictional character, Hinata Hyuga, take a more active role and become a heroine. Despite initially deciding that Naruto and Hinata would end together, Kishimoto thought it would be interesting if Sakura formed part of a love triangle. Nevertheless, Kishimoto said romance was not what his series he wanted to focus on. In the middle of the manga's final arc Sakura is given <b>a</b> <b>love</b> <b>letter.</b> The real reasons for this is that Kishimoto wanted to give the anime studio material to create animated only episodes.|$|E

25|$|On 7 April 1779, a {{few weeks}} after his {{ordination}} as a priest of the Church of England, Hackman followed Martha Ray to Covent Garden, where she had gone to watch a performance of Isaac Bickerstaffe's comic opera Love in a Village with her friend and fellow singer Caterina Galli. Suspecting that Ray had a new lover, when Hackman saw her in the theatre with William Hanger, 3rd Baron Coleraine, he left, fetched two pistols, and waited in a nearby coffee house. After Ray and Galli came out of the theatre, Hackman approached the ladies just as they were about to get into their carriage. He put one pistol to Ray's forehead and shot her dead. With the other he then tried to kill himself but made only a flesh wound. He then beat himself with both discharged pistols until he was arrested and taken, with Martha Ray's body, into a tavern in St James's Street. Two letters were found on Hackman, one addressed to his brother-in-law, Frederick Booth, and <b>a</b> <b>love</b> <b>letter</b> to Martha Ray: both later appeared in evidence at the murder trial.|$|E

500|$|Madonna {{sings in}} the first verse: [...] "There are too many options/There is no consolation/I have lost my illusions/What I want is an explanation." [...] According to Rolling Stone, {{although}} not explicitly stated, the lines confirm Madonna's belief that American culture will not [...] "give her an explanation", so she had rejected American values, and along with them her own values. She repeats the line [...] "I got you under my skin" [...] while a male voice acts as the backing for the track. The song ends with Madonna singing the words [...] "feel good" [...] a capella. [...] The lyrics of the song deals with questions, solutions, resurrections, confusions and other broad topics of a neo-philosophical nature. Edna Gundersen of USA Today compared its composition and Madonna's performance with <b>a</b> <b>love</b> <b>letter.</b> The Advocate called it [...] "a plaintive love letter to her husband".|$|E
500|$|The action {{scenes were}} {{generally}} praised. RPGamer's Michael Beckett, while giving the film a 4 out of 5, lauded the film's fighting scenes, calling them [...] "mesmerizing" [...] {{and the primary}} focus of the movie. Anime News Network's Santos also heavily praised the action sequences, and Felperin of Variety felt they were the only point to the movie, which they felt focused entirely on the technical aspects of the action. The music received mixed reviews; Eriani of Mania Entertainment heavily praised it, as did Santos of Anime News Network, but 1UP.com's Mielke called it [...] "a bit sappy". Douglass Jr. from DVD Talk concluded that Advent Children [...] "is pretty much the film that fans all over the world have been waiting for", RPGamer's Beckett said that [...] "the film feels very much like <b>a</b> <b>love</b> <b>letter</b> to the fans of Final Fantasy VII", and IGN's Carle summed up the film as [...] "glorious, beautiful, well-executed fan service." ...|$|E
500|$|The Comics Reporter {{described}} the series as [...] "read like <b>a</b> <b>love</b> <b>letter</b> {{to the way}} kids can be {{at the age of}} 2–5," [...] and a reviewer at Anime News Network compared Azuma's ability to capture [...] "the wonder of childhood" [...] to Bill Watterson's in Calvin and Hobbes.

[...] Nicholas Penedo of Animeland said [...] "with Yotsuba, we find ourselves plunged into the wonderful world of childhood," [...] calling the French edition of volume eight, [...] "A beautiful manga for children and adults." [...] BD Gest praised Azuma's skill in making distinct secondary characters, calling them [...] "immediately recognisable", and saying that they each spice up the story in their own ways. However, Azuma has been criticized for creating characters that are [...] "too clean, too perfectly functional," [...] for overusing [...] "outrageous expressions and reactions," [...] and for dragging out jokes too long.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} mixed to moderately positive {{reviews from}} critics. The A.V. Club reviewer Todd VanDerWerff gave [...] "Unusual Suspects" [...] an A-, and {{wrote that the}} episode [...] "is <b>a</b> <b>love</b> <b>letter</b> to {{the very idea of}} paranoia". Furthermore, VanDerWerff argued that [...] "as the episode moved its way to its climax, when Mr. X improbably lets the Gunmen live after seeing as much as they did [...] it struck me that what we’re seeing here may not entirely be meant to be taken seriously, just as 'Memoirs Of A Cigarette Smoking Man' [...] is more about who the CSM wished he might have been than the person he actually was. This isn’t a true story; it’s a manifesto." [...] Critical Myth's John Keegan gave the episode 6/10, and, while calling the entry [...] "an interesting diversion from the normal format of the series", he noted that [...] "there are still some issues with the plausibility of the story, and ultimately, the questions surrounding Mulder overshadow the character development of the Gunmen themselves." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{a preview}} of the record, Jeff Benjamin from Fuse {{acknowledged}} the 1980s influences that resonated throughout the track and noted that [...] "hard rock guitars and percussion come crashing in on the chorus." [...] Sarah O' Hara, while reviewing Love, Lust, Faith and Dreams for Lowdown, compared the song to [...] "Kings and Queens", a track with a similar structure included on This Is War featuring sparse verses and slow atmospheric builds to the chorus. In an interview with Loudwire, Leto described [...] "City of Angels" [...] as a very personal song about a specific place. He said, [...] "It's the story of my brother and I going to Los Angeles to make our dreams come true. It's <b>a</b> <b>love</b> <b>letter</b> to that beautiful and bizarre land." [...] Leto later explained that the song could refer to any place a person goes to fulfill his or her own dreams. Mary Ouellette, writing for Loudwire, felt that the song [...] "tells a passionate tale of finding comfort in calling the city of Los Angeles home." ...|$|E
500|$|Selman {{wanted to}} include {{things in the}} episode that [...] "only really hard-core foodies would {{have any idea what}} we were talking about. This was like <b>a</b> <b>love</b> <b>letter</b> to foodie culture." [...] Food {{references}} featured in the episode include jokes about sriracha sauce and sous-vide cooking, referrals to chefs Wylie Dufresne, Frank Bruni, and Ruth Reichl, a mention of the soup phở from Vietnam and how to pronounce it correctly, and the inclusion of the El Chemistri owner who is based on the Spanish chef José Andrés (known for using molecular gastronomy). Selman has commented that food produced with the help of molecular gastronomy [...] "lends itself to comedy quite nicely. There’s a dish , for instance, called Regret. The waiter cries into your soup when he serves it. The human tear is the final ingredient." [...] The fictional character Swedish Chef is also seen in the episode, and the scene where the meth dealer is reminded of his childhood after eating the apple pie is a reference to the Pixar film Ratatouille, which was written and directed by former Simpsons consultant Brad Bird.|$|E
