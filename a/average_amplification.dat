30|$|With {{that aim}} in mind, the focus here {{is on the}} 1 D {{response}} of horizontally stratified soil columns, and on investigating the relationships between corresponding amplification factors on response spectra, and limited number of “site proxies” describing the overall characteristics of the soil profile. A series of 858 real soil profiles are considered, and their linear viscoelastic responses to vertically incident S waves are computed for 14 distinct, real input waveforms spanning {{a wide range of}} frequency contents. For each site, the geometric <b>average</b> <b>amplification</b> factor is derived from these 14 different loadings, and an artificial neural network approach is used to investigate the correlation between this <b>average</b> <b>amplification</b> factor and various sets of soil characteristics. Sensitivity studies are performed to identify the relative performance of several site proxies, with the goal of proposing optimal combination sets offering a good compromise between physical relevancy and practical affordability. The robustness of the results is tested by conducting the same analysis on two additional sets of soil profiles, termed normalized soil profiles (NP) and truncated soil profiles (TP), modified to correspond to a uniform bedrock velocity of 800  m/s.|$|E
40|$|Abstract It is well {{established}} that sedimentary basins can significantly amplify earthquake ground motion. However, the amplification at any given site can vary with earthquake location. To account for basin response in probabilistic seismic hazard analysis, therefore, {{we need to know}} the <b>average</b> <b>amplification</b> and intrinsic variability (standard deviation) at each site, given all earthquakes of concern in the region. Due to a dearth of empirical ground-motion observations, theoretical simu-lations constitute our best hope of addressing this issue. Here, 0 – 0. 5 Hz finite-difference, finite-fault simulations are used to estimate the three-dimensional (3 D) response of the Los Angeles basin to nine different earthquake scenarios. Amplifi-cation is quantified as the peak velocity obtained from the 3 D simulation divided by that predicted using a regional one-dimensional (1 D) crustal model. Average ampli-fication factors are up to a factor of 4, with the values from individual scenarios typically differing by as much as a factor of 2. 5. The <b>average</b> <b>amplification</b> correlates with basin depth, with values near unity at sites above sediments with thickness less than 2 km, and up to factors near 6 above the deepest (! 9 km) and steepest-dippin...|$|E
40|$|Conference ABSTRACT: Portable seismographs were {{operated}} at 8 {{sites in}} and near Blenheim, one {{serving as a}} reference for comparison of site response from small local and regional earthquakes. Some resonance was observed at three sites, {{but there were no}} common resonant frequencies. Most sites exhibited mean amplifications of 1 – 2 times the signal at the reference site. <b>Average</b> <b>amplifications</b> at the resonant frequencies were up to six times the reference. It is concluded that there is less variation in site response in Blenheim than in most locations elsewhere in New Zealand that have been investigated in this way. Blenheim's principal earthquake hazard derives from its close proximity to the Wairau and Awatere faults, and from the slightly more distant Clarence, Kekerengu, Elliot, Jordon and Hope faults of the Marlborough fault system. All are capable of producing earthquakes of Mw 6. 9 - 7. 9. The average return time for an earthquake on any one of these is in the range 28 - 51 years. The average time between an earthquake on either the Wairau or Awatere faults is in the range 350 - 950 years. An Mw 7. 5 earthquake on either could produce peak ground accelerations of up to 1. 4 g at the sites surveyed, and intensities from MM VII to more than IX. ...|$|R

Optimal preservation conditions and choice of microsatellites for giant panda fecal samples have not been established. In this study, we evaluated the effect of four factors (namely, storage type (ethanol (EtOH), EtOH − 20  °C, 2 -step storage medium, DMSO/EDTA/Tris/salt buffer (DETs) and frozen at − 20  °C), storage time (one, three and six months), fragment length, and repeat motif of microsatellite loci) on the success rate of microsatellite amplification, allelic dropout (ADO) and false allele (FA) rates from giant panda fecal samples. Amplification success and ADO rates differed between the storage types. Freezing was inferior to the other four storage methods based on the lowest <b>average</b> <b>amplification</b> success and the highest ADO rates (P <  0. 05). The highest microsatellite amplification success was obtained from either EtOH or the 2 -step storage medium at three storage time points. Storage time had a negative effect on the <b>average</b> <b>amplification</b> of microsatellites and samples stored in EtOH and the 2 -step storage medium were more stable than the other three storage types. We only detected the effect of repeat motif on ADO and FA rates. The lower ADO and FA rates were obtained from tri- and tetra-nucleotide loci. We suggest that freezing should not be used for giant panda fecal preservation in microsatellite studies, and EtOH and the 2 -step storage medium should be chosen on priority for long-term storage. We recommend candidate microsatellite loci with longer repeat motif to ensure greater genotyping success for giant panda fecal studies...|$|E

The obtained largest and least ASA, DGM and AAF were in the basins with SISB as triangular and trapezoidal, respectively. An increase of ASA, AAF and DGM were obtained with an increase of impedance contrast, sediment quality factor, basin shape-ratio and angle of incidence of body wave. It is also inferred that the generated Rayleigh wave in the rocky area in case of plane wave front with inclination 45 ° and thereafter their transmission in the basin is responsible for the unexpected AAF of the order of 4.7 in the circular basin.|$|R

40|$|Recent {{research}} has shown that multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems provide high spectral efficiencies and error performance gains. However, the use of multiple antennas in mobile terminals may not be very practical. Certainly there is limited space and other implementation issues which make this a challenging problem. Therefore, to harness the diversity gains afforded by MIMO transmitter diversity techniques, while maintaining a minimal number of antennas on each handset, cooperative diversity techniques have been proposed. In addition, attention has also been given to combining wireless relaying systems with MIMO techniques to improve capacity, coverage, and obtain better diversity at the expense of increased node complexity. This thesis considers the design and analysis of cooperative diversity systems and MIMO amplify-and-forward relaying systems. In particular, we investigate adaptive time- and frequency-domain equalization techniques for cooperative diversity systems using space-time block codes (STBC). For MIMO relaying systems, we analyze the ergodic capacity of various systems and compare different amplify-and-forward methods in terms of system capacity performance. We propose a new block time-domain adaptive equalization structure for time reversal-space time block coding (TR-STBC) systems, which eliminates the separate decoder and also the need for explicit channel state information (CSI) estimation at the receiver. Our simulation results show that the time-domain adaptive block equalizer performs better than the frequency-domain counterpart but at the cost of increased complexity. Then, we extend this time-domain adaptive equalization scheme to distributed TR-STBC systems. We also develop a frequency-domain counterpart for the distributed systems. Our simulation results show that the adaptive algorithms work well for Protocols I and III proposed by Nabar et al. The time-domain adaptive algorithms perform better than the frequency-domain algorithms, and overall the Protocol I receivers outperform the Protocol III receivers. We also show that, if only the Protocol III receiver is used, it can be susceptible to noise amplification due to a weaker source-to-relay link compared to the relay-to-destination link. This problem can be mitigated by using the Protocol I receivers with some extra complexity but much superior diversity performance. We also present an ergodic capacity analysis of an amplify-and-forward (AF) MIMO two-hop system including the direct link and validate the analysis with simulations. We show that having the direct link improves the capacity due to diversity and quantify this improvement. We also present an ergodic capacity analysis of an AF MIMO two-hop, two relay system. Our results verify the capacity gain of relaying systems with two relays due to the extra diversity compared to a single relaying system. However, the results also show that when one of the source-to-relay links has a markedly higher SNR compared to the other, a single relay system has better capacity than a two relay system. Finally, we compare three types of relay amplification methods: a) <b>average</b> <b>amplification,</b> b) instantaneous channel amplification, and c) instantaneous power amplification. The instantaneous power amplification method has a higher mean capacity but with a higher variance. Also, it requires additional information at the destination and would create enormous overheads compared to the other methods. We also find that the instantaneous channel amplification method has almost no advantage in terms of the mean capacity but its capacity is less variable than the <b>average</b> <b>amplification</b> method. On the other hand, the <b>average</b> <b>amplification</b> method is simpler to implement as it does not require channel estimation at the relaying terminal...|$|E

30|$|In all {{the above}} {{mentioned}} {{studies by the}} first author and his co-researchers, sediment damping was applied corresponding to the dominant frequency only (means no frequency dependent damping) {{and there is no}} study on the P-SV wave simulation of a closed basin, which may cause basin generated Rayleigh (BGR) waves. For example, in this study dominant frequency is 4.0  Hz and the frequency bandwidth is 0 – 10  Hz. It means, all the frequency larger than 4.0  Hz and lesser than 4.0  Hz will be under damped and over damped, respectively. Furthermore, surface waves are more affected by the sediment damping as compared to the body waves since they entirely travel back and forth in a closed basin. So, the realistic characteristics of the basin generated surface waves and associated DGM could not be predicted in a closed basin if damping is applied only at the dominant frequency [7, 22, 23]. In order to predict the realistic characteristics of the BGR-wave and associated DGM in a closed basin, the seismic responses of various considered basin models were simulated using a recently developed P-SV wave viscoelastic fourth-order accurate time-domain finite-difference (FD) algorithm by Narayan and Kumar [12]. This algorithm is efficient enough to incorporated the frequency-dependent as well as phase-dependent damping in a time-domain simulation.

40|$|Three {{applications}} of a numerical technique are illustrated to model realistically the seismic ground motion for complex two-dimensional structures. First we consider a sedimentary basin in the Friuli region, and we model strong motion records from an aftershock of the 1976 earthquake. Then we simulate the ground motion caused in Rome by the 1915, Fucino (Italy) earthquake, and we compare our modelling with the damage distribution {{observed in the}} town. Finally {{we deal with the}} interpretation of ground motion recorded in Mexico City, as a consequence of earthquakes in the Mexican subduction zone. The synthetic signals explain the major characteristics (relative amplitudes, spectral amplification, frequency content) of the considered seismograms, and the space distribution of the available macroseismic data. For the sedimentary basin in the Friuli area, parametric studies demonstrate the relevant sensitivity of the computed ground motion to small changes in the subsurface topography of the sedimentary basin, and in the velocity and quality factor of the sediments. The relative Arias Intensity, determined from our numerical simulation in Rome, is in very good agreoment with the distribution of damage observed during the Fucino earthquake. For epicentral distances in the range 50 km- 100 km, the source location and not only the local soil conditions control the local effects. For Mexico City, the observed ground motion can be explained as resonance effects and as excitation of local surface waves, and the theoretical and the observed maximum spectral amplifications are very similar.

A statistically significant positive angular correlation between clusters (〈z 〉 ≃ 0. 15) and QSOs (0. 4 ≤ z ≤ 2. 2) on scales of several arcminutes is found. This association of QSOs with foreground clusters is ascribed to gravitational lensing by galaxy clusters. The amplitude of associations displays trends expected if weak lensing by clusters were responsible: (a) most statistically significant associations are found for brightest QSOs found very close in projection to clusters centers; (b) QSO number excess behind clusters increases closer to cluster centers; and (c) QSO number excess increases with brighter QSO flux limit {{in a way that}} would be expected from a simple lensing model derived using Boyle, Shanks & Peterson (1988) QSO number counts and an <b>average</b> <b>amplification</b> of A = 2 due to clusters. The implied amplification is substantially larger than would be expecte...|$|E
40|$|We have {{developed}} a highly sensitive method for DNA analysis on 3 D gel element microarrays, a technique we call multiplex microarray-enhanced PCR (MME-PCR). Two amplification strategies are carried out simultaneously in the reaction chamber: on or within gel elements, and in bulk solution over the gel element array. MME-PCR is initiated by multiple complex primers containing gene-specific, forward and reverse, sequences appended to the 3 ′ end of a universal amplification primer. The complex primer pair is covalently tethered through its 5 ′ end to the polyacryl- amide backbone. In the bulk solution above the gel element array, {{a single pair of}} unattached universal primers simultaneously directs pseudo-monoplex PCR of all targets according to normal solution-phase PCR. The presence of a single universal PCR primer pair in solution accelerates amplification within gel elements and eliminates the problem of primer interference that is common to conventional multiplex PCR. We show 106 -fold amplification of targeted DNA after 50 cycles with <b>average</b> <b>amplification</b> efficiency 1. 34 per cycle, and demonstrate specific on-chip amplification of six genes in Bacillus subtilis. All six genes were detected at 4. 5 pg of bacterial genomic DNA (equivalent to 103 genomes) in 60 independent amplification reactions performed simultaneously in single reaction chamber...|$|E
40|$|Background: Penthorum chinense Pursh (P. chinense) is a {{well-known}} traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) plant, which has long been used for the prevention and treatment of hepatic diseases. This study aimed to genetically characterize the varieties of P. chinense from different geographic localities of China by random amplification of polymorphic DNA (RAPD) -PCR technique and verified with inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR) markers. Results: The P. chinense samples were collected from nine different geographic localities. Previously improved RAPD and ISSR markers were utilized for genetic analysis using DNA amplification. The genetic relationship dendrogram was obtained by conducting cluster analysis to the similarity coefficient of improved RAPD and ISSR markers. Improved RAPD yielded 185 scorable amplified products, of which 68. 6 % of the bands were polymorphic, with an <b>average</b> <b>amplification</b> of 9. 25 bands per primer. The ISSR markers revealed 156 alleles with 7. 8 bands per primers, where 59. 7 % bands were polymorphic. Furthermore, the similarity coefficient ranges of RAPD and ISSR markers were 0. 71 – 0. 91 and 0. 66 – 0. 89, respectively. Conclusions: This study indicated that improved RAPD and ISSR methods are useful tools for evaluating the genetic diversity and characterizing P. chinense. Our findings can provide the theoretical basis for cultivar identification, standardization, and molecular-assisted breeding of P. chinense for medicinal use...|$|E
40|$|We {{have applied}} a {{non-linear}} inversion technique to estimate both the earthquake source parameters and site response from {{a set of}} microearthquake records acquired by a dense seismic network, {{in order to provide}} a simple uniform site classification for the strong-motion stations installed in Campania-Lucania region (Southern Italy) by ISNet network. The main assumption of this inversion method, is the linear response of the sites with respect to the input earthquakes. The technique is applied to horizontal acceleration and velocity records of 101 seismic events occurred in the Campania-Lucania region. We assumed the - 2 source model, a R- 1 geometric attenuation, and a frequency dependent anelastic attenuation factor. All the records are corrected by propagation path such that only the source and site effects remain in the records. The site effect at each station is thus obtained from the spectral ratio between the corrected amplitude displacement spectrum and the theoretical spectrum retrieved from the inversion. The estimated transfer functions show that stations located on stiff and soft soils attenuate the ground motion in the high frequency range, while the site effects for rock site present significant amplification at higher frequencies than 2. 0 Hz. Next, at each station, the retrieved site-amplification spectra are averaged within four frequency bands: (Ib) 1 - 5 Hz, (IIb) 5 - 10 Hz, 10 - 15 Hz and 15 - 20 Hz. These bands are chosen based {{on the size of the}} analyzed earthquakes and to retrieve the amplification coefficient for different input ground motion parameters, such as PGA, PGV or Sa(T) that are "moderate-to-high" frequency parameters. Finally, we constructed four maps, one for each frequency band in order to correlate the <b>average</b> site <b>amplifications</b> with superficial geology. The accuracy of the site response maps will evolve as more data became available in order to highlight significant variations in site response for different geologic unit...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAccelerometric {{records of}} the Chi-Chi {{earthquake}} from sites on the hanging wall exhibit larger acceleration than those from the footwall. Based on ground accelerations recorded at 79 near-field stations (10 hanging-wall stations and 69 footwall stations, respectively) and precise mapping of fault-rupture traces, the hanging-wall/footwall effects of the Chi-Chi earthquake have been fully studied. We show that the hanging-wall effects cannot be simply accounted for by a proper choice of distance metric. The closest distance to the rupture plane (Drup) is then selected to develop an empirical ground-motion model by using the data collected during the mainshock of the Chi-Chi earthquake that struck Taiwan. With the exception of some sites immediately next to the rupture traces (Drup ≤ 5 km), the acceleration residuals between this empirical model and the recorded data at the footwall stations are close to zero for stations in the distance range from 5 to 50 km. On the other hand, the <b>average</b> acceleration <b>amplification</b> on the hanging wall {{is equal to the}} natural logarithmic values of 0. 64 ± 0. 4 for all hanging-wall sites within 20 km of Drup. The hanging-wall/footwall effects have also been evaluated for several response spectral periods. It is observed that both the horizontal and vertical components of spectral acceleration are apparently amplified for sites on the hanging wall at a distance from 5 to 20 km for spectral periods 0. 02 to 0. 5 sec, whereas the vertical component has less amplification than the horizontal in all the spectral periods considered. The horizontal component of spectral acceleration at the hanging-wall sites also shows a larger value for the long-period motion, relative to the footwall, for periods larger than 1. 0 sec. The hanging-wall effects are relatively constant, at low frequencies, as the distance extends to about 20 km. This observation cannot be explained by the simplified empirical model. Rather, it suggests that waves trapped in the hanging-wall wedge may have been involved...|$|R
40|$|Empirical evidences {{show that}} {{planetary}} tides may influence solar activity: 1) the 11 -yr Schwabe sunspot number cycle is constrained between the spring tidal period of Jupiter and Saturn, 9. 93 yr, and the tidal orbital period of Jupiter, 11. 86 yr, {{and a model}} based on these cycles reconstructs solar dynamics at multiple time; 2) {{a measure of the}} alignment of Venus, Earth and Jupiter reveals quasi 11. 07 -yr cycles well correlated to the 11 -year Schwabe solar cycles; 3) there exists a 11. 08 yr cyclical recurrence in the solar jerk-shock vector, which is induced mostly by Mercury and Venus. However, Newtonian classical physics fails to explain the phenomenon. Only by means of a significant nuclear fusion amplification of the tidal gravitational potential energy released in the Sun, may planetary tides produce irradiance output oscillations with a sufficient magnitude to influence solar dynamo processes. Here we use an adaptation of the well-known mass-luminosity relation to calculate a conversion factor between the solar luminosity and the potential gravitational power associated to the mass lost by nuclear fusion: the <b>average</b> estimated <b>amplification</b> factor is A= 4, 250, 000. We use this magnification factor to evaluate the theoretical luminosity oscillations that planetary tides may potentially stimulate inside the solar core by making its nuclear fusion rate oscillate. By converting the power related to this energy into solar irradiance units at 1 AU we find that the tidal oscillations may be able to theoretically induce an oscillating luminosity increase from 0. 05 - 0. 65 $W/m^{ 2 }$ to 0. 25 - 1. 63 $W/m^{ 2 }$, which is a range compatible with the ACRIM satellite observed total solar irradiance fluctuations. In conclusion, the Sun, by means of its nuclear active core, may be working as a great amplifier of the small planetary tidal energy dissipated in it. Comment: 27 pages, 13 figure...|$|R
