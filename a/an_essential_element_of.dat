5|$|After leaving Apogee, Jackson {{entered into}} {{a joint venture with}} Clair Brothers to design a digital {{loudspeaker}} controller for control of complex concert sound systems. Jackson estimated that the project would cost $800,000 in U.S. dollars, but it ended up costing Clair Brothers more than $2M. From the same garage in which he started Apogee, Jackson developed the proprietary Clair iO: a two-input, six-output digital audio matrix with opto-isolated output circuits. <b>An</b> <b>essential</b> <b>element</b> <b>of</b> the system was its ability to be controlled by wireless tablet computer by an audio engineer walking around to various seating sections in a concert venue, to tailor the system's response more precisely.|$|E
5|$|The Egyptians {{believed}} that a balanced relationship between people and animals was <b>an</b> <b>essential</b> <b>element</b> <b>of</b> the cosmic order; thus humans, animals and plants {{were believed to be}} members of a single whole. Animals, both domesticated and wild, were therefore a critical source of spirituality, companionship, and sustenance to the ancient Egyptians. Cattle were the most important livestock; the administration collected taxes on livestock in regular censuses, and the size of a herd reflected the prestige and importance of the estate or temple that owned them. In addition to cattle, the ancient Egyptians kept sheep, goats, and pigs. Poultry, such as ducks, geese, and pigeons, were captured in nets and bred on farms, where they were force-fed with dough to fatten them. The Nile provided a plentiful source of fish. Bees were also domesticated from at least the Old Kingdom, and provided both honey and wax.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{simplest}} structure capable of generate harmonic signals of high frequency and stable amplitude. <b>As</b> <b>essential</b> <b>elements</b> <b>of</b> these oscillators have been used active blocks known as diamond transistors. The proposal was given to minimize the number of components and smooth electronic retuning. These proposed districts have been theoretically analyzed by the program PSpice and practically verified. The document contains {{the results of these}} reviews and readings focusing on the total harmonic distortion, frequency agility and range of phase noise...|$|R
50|$|Assam is {{acknowledged}} as the settling {{land for a}} lot of civilizations. A number of tribal grouping have landed in the soils of Assam in the course of diverse directions as the territory was linked to a number of states and many different countries. Australoids, Tibeto-Burmans, Indo-Aryans had been the most important traditional groups that arrived at the site and lived in the very old Assam. They were well thought-out as the ‘aborigines’ of Assam and yet at the moment they are <b>an</b> <b>essential</b> <b>elements</b> <b>of</b> the “Assamese Diaspora”.|$|R
40|$|Localization and path {{planning}} is <b>an</b> <b>essential</b> <b>elements</b> <b>of</b> mobile robots but {{it relies on}} model availability. It is difficult to obtain robot dynamics/kinematics model due to lot of constants and variables. This paper proposes a highly adaptable and universal method for obtaining differential drive robot model by self-calibration. The obtained model is based on linear time invariant assumption and accepts sensor-less prediction as well as hybrid mode, where encoder’s data are filtered against the model. Theoretical background and experimental proof of model quality is included in this paper...|$|R
5|$|The tax was {{rescinded}} by the British in 1812, {{who then}} imposed a British style constitution on the island. One legal innovation {{of this time}} of particular consequence for the aristocracy was that creditors, who had previously only been able to enforce repayments of the interest on a loan or mortgage, could now seize property. Property began to change hands in smaller parcels at auctions, and consequently a land-owning bourgeoisie immediately began to flourish. Revolts against the Bourbons in 1821, and 1848 divided the nobility, and liberalism was in the air. These factors coupled with {{the social and political}} upheaval of the following Risorgimento in the 19th century meant the Sicilian aristocracy was a doomed class. Furthermore, because of their neglect and dereliction of noblesse oblige, <b>an</b> <b>essential</b> <b>element</b> <b>of</b> the feudal system, the countryside was often ruled by bandits outside the enclosed villages, and the once grand country villas were decaying. The building mania of the Sicilian upper class was over.|$|E
25|$|Catholics {{consider}} vocal prayer <b>an</b> <b>essential</b> <b>element</b> <b>of</b> the Christian life. Vocal prayer can be {{as simple}} and uplifting as “Thank you, God, for this beautiful morning,” or as formal as a Mass celebrating a very special occasion.|$|E
25|$|Though the Court {{adopted the}} {{position}} of the inspector defendants that the absence of probable cause should be <b>an</b> <b>essential</b> <b>element</b> <b>of</b> this claim, it disagreed with their reasoning, and instead based the need for that element upon the requirement to prove causation.|$|E

50|$|On {{the other}} side of the world, maize seeds from the Americas were {{introduced}} into Southeast Asia in the late 16th century through Spanish and Portuguese traders. The plant thrived in the tropical climate of Indonesia, and soon became a staple food plant in drier areas of central and southeastern Indonesia, since it requires much less water than wet rice. Coconut and palm oil have been <b>a</b> <b>essential</b> <b>elements</b> <b>of</b> Indonesian cuisine for centuries. The deep fried technique using palm oil was probably borrowed from Portuguese colonists; and Indonesia has its own type of corn fritter, called perkedel jagung or bakwan jagung.|$|R
25|$|Many stories {{surrounding}} the petroleum industry's early development are colourful. The gathering oilpatch involved rugged adventurers, the occasional fraud, important innovations and, in the end, world-class success. Canadian petroleum production {{is now a}} vital part of the national economy and <b>an</b> <b>essential</b> <b>element</b> <b>of</b> world supply. Canada has become an energy giant.|$|E
25|$|The blossoming of {{literature}} in the Ardalan principality was accompanied by an intense cultivation of music. Music is <b>an</b> <b>essential</b> <b>element</b> <b>of</b> the cultural tradition of the Yarsan religious community. In connection with this, {{it is interesting that}} the Kurds in East and South Kurdistan, where to the Gorani culture was spread, call songs 'Gorani'.|$|E
25|$|Findings {{also support}} the {{hypothesis}} that an increase in the expression of cereblon is <b>an</b> <b>essential</b> <b>element</b> <b>of</b> the anti-myeloma effect of both lenalidomide and pomalidomide. Cereblon expression was three times higher in responding patients compared to non-responders and higher cereblon expression was also associated with partial or full response while lower expression was associated with stable or progressive disease.|$|E
50|$|An {{investment}} {{center is}} a classification used for business units within <b>an</b> enterprise.The <b>essential</b> <b>element</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> investment center {{is that it is}} treated as a unit which is measured against its use of capital, as opposed to a cost or profit center, which are measured against raw costs or profits.|$|R
40|$|The European Union {{enforced}} {{respect of}} human rights and democratic principles <b>an</b> <b>essential</b> <b>elements</b> <b>of</b> all its preferential and non preferential trading agreements {{since the beginning of the}} 90 's. In all EU external agreements, <b>an</b> <b>essential</b> <b>element</b> would imply that the EU can impose sanctions against violating states, that is, "suspension of high-level bilateral contacts, trade embargoes, suspension of arms sales, suspension of military cooperation and suspension of cooperation", as was the case for Serbia and Burma because {{of human rights}} abuses such as torture, political arrests or censorship. But its preference is to use positive action rather than penalties. This paper deals with Euro-Med Agreements, it aims at assessing the impact of these constraints on EU partners governance. Using within comparisons and difference-in-differences estimates, we find that these agreements improved Mediterranean countries governance but not the respect of democratic principles.

50|$|The {{development}} of the stationary steam engine was <b>an</b> <b>essential</b> early <b>element</b> <b>of</b> the Industrial Revolution, however {{it should be remembered}} that for most of the period of the Industrial Revolution the majority of industries still relied on wind and water power as well as horse and man-power for driving small machines.|$|R
25|$|Temperature can be <b>an</b> <b>essential</b> <b>element</b> <b>of</b> {{the taste}} experience. Food and drink that—in a given culture—is {{traditionally}} served hot is often considered distasteful if cold, and vice versa. For example, alcoholic beverages, {{with a few}} exceptions, are usually thought best when served at room temperature or chilled to varying degrees, but soups—again, with exceptions—are usually only eaten hot. A cultural example are soft drinks. In North America it is almost always preferred cold, regardless of season.|$|E
25|$|With the {{exception}} of courtesans, the banquet was strictly reserved for men. It was <b>an</b> <b>essential</b> <b>element</b> <b>of</b> Greek social life. Great feasts could only be afforded by the rich; in most Greek homes, religious feasts or family events were the occasion of more modest banquets. The banquet became the setting of a specific genre of literature, giving birth to Plato's Symposium, Xenophon's work of the same name, the Table Talk of Plutarch's Moralia, and the Deipnosophists (Banquet of the Learned) of Athenaeus.|$|E
25|$|The Second World War {{sparked the}} {{widespread}} migration of Soviet citizens {{to the rear}} of the USSR. Much of this movement was directed to Soviet Central Asia. These migrations included official, state-organised evacuations and deportations as well as the non-sanctioned, panicked flight from the front by both general citizenry and important officials. The evacuation of Soviet citizens and industry during World War II was <b>an</b> <b>essential</b> <b>element</b> <b>of</b> their overall success in the war, and Central Asia served as a main destination for evacuees.|$|E
40|$|Peer {{debriefing}} {{ensures the}} trustworthiness of a qualitative research study. Through peer debriefing, the researcher explores the research design, data collection process, and data analysis while colleagues, serving as critical friends, encourage {{the researcher to}} examine the research process from multiple perspectives. This paper examines experiences in a peer debriefing group formed by five female teacher researchers {{as a part of}} their graduate requirements for doctoral work, and their continued association as they pursued their professional goals. Three themes emerged based on the analysis of team meeting minutes, reflective journal logs, and case reports constructed reflectively by the five participants. These were: (<b>a)</b> <b>essential</b> <b>elements</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> successful peer debriefing group are commitment, continuity, and individual expectations being met; (b) participation can serve as an important development step in preparation as a professional researcher and educator; and (c) academic and emotional support provided by a peer debriefing group is a motivating factor leading to researcher’s perceptions of success. These themes highlight the benefits of including peer debriefing {{as a part of the}} action research process of teacher researchers as a means of dealing with the ‘messiness’ that novice teachers researchers encounter when conducting action or self-study research...|$|R

25|$|Bikinis {{have been}} made out of just about every {{material}} known. The fabrics and other materials used to make bikinis are <b>an</b> <b>essential</b> <b>element</b> <b>of</b> their style and crucial modifiers of swimsuit design. The use of cotton made the swimsuit more practical, and the increased reliance on stretch fabric after 1960 simplified construction; alternative swimwear fabrics such as velvet, leather, and crocheted squares surfaced in the early 1970s. Crochet, lace, PVC, raffia, fur, latex, velvet and other uncommon items are also used as bikini material.|$|E
25|$|Architecturally, Lawson's work on {{the asylum}} was very exuberant, making some of his {{previous}} designs look comparatively tame. The asylum had turrets on corbels projecting from nearly every corner, with the gabled roof line dominated by a large tower complete with further turrets and a spire. The building contained {{four and a half}} million bricks made of local clay on the site and was 225 metres long by 67 metres wide. The great central tower of 50 m height, <b>an</b> <b>essential</b> <b>element</b> <b>of</b> many revivalist designs, was also proposed to double as an observation tower if inmates should try to escape.|$|E
25|$|For BAPS Devotees, he embodies <b>an</b> <b>essential</b> <b>element</b> <b>of</b> the {{doctrine}} of Akshar and Purushottam. They believe based on interpretation from the Vachanamrut (scripture containing discourses by Swaminarayan) that “Akshar is an eternally-existing spiritual reality having two forms, the impersonal and the personal.” Furthermore, BAPS claims that Gunatitanand Swami {{was believed to be}} the first personal manifestation of Akshar in the Guru Parampara, an unbroken line of “perfect devotees” who provide “authentication of office through Gunatitanand Swami and back to Swaminarayan himself.” The Vadtal and Ahmedabad dioceses of the Swaminarayan Sampraday do not subscribe to this theory.|$|E

25|$|The town lot or plaza was <b>an</b> <b>essential</b> <b>element</b> <b>of</b> the Spanish colonial town plan. Government {{offices were}} {{designed}} to face the plaza, {{and in the case}} of this coastal village, the plaza could be fortified as a defensive work. An army encampment was recorded in the Plaza Lot in 1801, and a small wooden fort, including a battery of three cannon, was established from then until 1814. The more substantial Fort San Carlos was built about 1816 to protect the strategic harbor of the Amelia River and Spanish interests in northern Florida. The former Indian campsite became the fort’s parade grounds fronting Estrada Street, which still exists.|$|E
25|$|The {{proof of}} {{possible}} detriment or prejudice, which will appear if the promisor {{is allowed to}} revert to his original promise, is required. In Ajayi V.

(1972) 2 QB 18, Denning detained that detriment is not <b>an</b> <b>essential</b> <b>element</b> <b>of</b> promissory estoppel. Therefore, for a plea of promissory estoppel to succeed, there must be a change in circumstances of the promisee. This elementary composition of promissory estoppel has been the core and central topic of discussion {{in the evolution of the}} doctrine.|$|E
25|$|Blackmun ruled for the {{government}} on both questions. Since Schmuck had enjoyed a continuing relationship with the dealers he sold to, and the cars could not be resold to a retail customer without titles obtained using false information, the dealers' applications were <b>an</b> <b>essential</b> <b>element</b> <b>of</b> his crime and thus constituted mail fraud. On the second question, Blackmun said the court should have considered whether the elements of odometer tampering were {{a subset of the}} elements of the mail fraud, and since {{that was not the case}} Schmuck had been properly denied the instruction. Scalia's dissent focused exclusively on the mail fraud issue. Since Schmuck had already received his payment for the altered vehicles, it did not matter what happened afterwards, a holding he found more consistent with the Court's earlier rulings on the subject.|$|E
