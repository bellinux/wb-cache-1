At the intersection, southbound traffic on Route206 had to use a jughandle to connect to Route177. The state highway went northeastward, progressing along as South Bridge Street through a curve. Heading northward, the route passed the Somerville Old Cemetery before intersecting with Fifth Street. There, state-maintenance ended, and the designation of Route177 terminated. Entering downtown Somerville, South Bridge Street continued northward into a large residential community. Passing to the east and west of several residential homes, South Bridge Street continued into the downtown portion, crossing the current-day Raritan Valley Line tracks maintained by New Jersey Transit and served the Somerville train station. After <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>blocks</b> of residential homes and businesses, South Bridge Street came to an intersection with New Jersey Route 28, where it switched to North Bridge Street.|$|E

2500|$|The newly {{established}} village became an industrial centre, and implement works, tanneries, asheries and wagon factories opened (and often closed shortly after, as economic [...] "panics" [...] occurred regularly). In 1876, Robert Samuel McLaughlin, Sr. moved his carriage works to Oshawa from Enniskillen {{to take advantage}} of its harbour and of the availability of a rail link not too far away. He constructed a two-storey building, which was soon added to. This building was heavily remodelled in 1929, receiving a new facade and being extended to the north using land where the city's gaol (jail, firehall & townhall) had once stood. The village became a town in 1879, in what was then called East Whitby Township. Around 1890, the carriage works relocated from its Simcoe Street address to an unused furniture factory <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>blocks</b> to the northeast, and this remained its site until the building burnt in 1899. Offered assistance by the town, McLaughlin chose to stay in Oshawa, building a new factory across Mary Street from the old site. Rail service had been provided in 1890 by the Oshawa Railway; this was originally set up as a streetcar line, but c. 1910 a second [...] "freight line" [...] was built slightly to the east of Simcoe Street. This electric line provided streetcar and freight service, connected central Oshawa with the Grand Trunk (now Canadian National) Railway, and with the Canadian Northern (which ran through the very north of Oshawa) and the Canadian Pacific, built in 1912-13. The Oshawa Railway was acquired by the Grand Trunk operation around 1910, and streetcar service was replaced by buses in 1940. After GM moved its main plants to south Oshawa in 1951, freight traffic fell and most of the tracks were removed in 1963, although a line to the older remaining [...] "north" [...] plant via Ritson Road remained until 2000.|$|E

40|$|Fountain coding {{principle}} {{introduced by}} Byers et al. in 1998 describes an {{efficient way to}} transfer information over erasure channels. In this paper, we focus on a particular class of fountain codes, the LT codes. The key component of LT codes is the so-called degree distribution used in the encoding procedure. The degree distribution is the sole component responsible for the efficiency of the LT codes. In general, the optimization of the degree distribution is not a trivial problem. This paper describes an algorithm for iterative optimization of parameterized degree distributions for LT codes. In particular, we use methods utilized in importance sampling theory to construct an objective function which eventually is optimized with non-linear optimization methods. The proposed method is studied for message lengths <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> hundred <b>blocks</b> and less.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to reveal the {{correlation}} between mortality rates from the tsunami of 2004 and the spatial structure of Banda Aceh’s street net. Structurally, the city is divided up in several small villages, which consists <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> urban <b>blocks.</b> The mortality rates for each of these local villages, gained from Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), were correlated with space syntax analyses of Banda Aceh’s street network.

However, observations of a tsunami wave’s behaviour show that a spatially broken up street can also reduce the water speed when it hits a city. Conversely, an orthogonal network styled street grid can generate high water speed through streets, but has on the other hand a high degree of orientability for its inhabitants for escaping the tsunami in case of panic. As it turns out from the interviews of tsunami survivals, people fled to the opposite direction of the tsunami and they followed the crowd. The survivors expressed that in the panic flight situation the visual orientation matters and rational thinking in way?finding reduces. Therefore the challenge in re?building cities in tsunami prone areas is to both make an orientable street network with a spatial structure that reduces a tsunami’s water speed.

But Johns newly refound maliciousness started out somewhat innocently and at first was seen as being part of another new characters maliciousness. In the winter of 1980, coal mining company owner, Brad Hollister (Peter Brouwer) arrived in Oakdale and conned the Hugheses (Chris and Nancy), the Stewarts (Ellen and David), and Lisa Colman out of land to start mining (with both of the families and Lisa unaware of how profitable their land was). Despite Brads con game, Dee Stewart (played in the 1980s by Jacqueline Schultz and Vicky Dawson) fell in love with him, but was hesitant to make love after a bad experience with another man. A frustrated Brad turned to her sister, Annie (played in the 1980s by Julie Ridley, Randall Edwards and Mary Lynn Blanks), and Dee married a supportive John (who had kept Dees secret about {{the true nature of the}} death of Ian McFarland) which was seen as a scandal by the pure-hearted Stewart family.
