25|$|The {{impression}} that a paradox exists {{stems from a}} misunderstanding of what special relativity states. Special relativity does not declare <b>all</b> <b>frames</b> of reference to be equivalent, only inertial frames. The traveling twin's frame is not inertial during periods when she is accelerating. Furthermore, {{the difference between the}} twins is observationally detectable: the traveling twin needs to fire her rockets to be able to return home, while the stay-at-home twin does not.|$|E
25|$|In diagram 2 the {{interval}} AB is 'time-like'; i.e., {{there is a}} frame of reference in which events A and B occur at the same location in space, separated only by occurring at different times. If A precedes B in that frame, then A precedes B in <b>all</b> <b>frames.</b> It is hypothetically possible for matter (or information) to travel from A to B, so {{there can be a}} causal relationship (with A the cause and B the effect).|$|E
25|$|Minkowski {{space is}} closely {{associated}} with Einstein's theory of special relativity, and {{is the most common}} mathematical structure on which special relativity is formulated. While the individual components in Euclidean space and time may differ due to length contraction and time dilation, in Minkowski spacetime, <b>all</b> <b>frames</b> of reference will agree on the total distance in spacetime between events. Because it treats time differently than it treats the 3 spatial dimensions, Minkowski space differs from four-dimensional Euclidean space.|$|E

25|$|The modern {{point of}} view makes all this intuition more precise using {{principal}} bundles (the essential idea is to replace a frame or a variable frame by the space of <b>all</b> <b>frames</b> and functions on this space). It also draws on the inspiration of Felix Klein's Erlangen programme, in which a geometry is defined to be a homogeneous space. Affine space is a geometry in this sense, and {{is equipped with a}} flat Cartan connection. Thus a general affine manifold is viewed as curved deformation of the flat model geometry of affine space.|$|E
25|$|Basic {{animation}} {{was added}} to the GIF89a spec via the Graphics Control Extension (GCE), which allows various images (frames) in the file to be painted with time delays, forming a video clip. An animated GIF file comprises a number of frames that are displayed in succession, each introduced by its own GCE, which gives the time delay to wait after the frame is drawn. Global information {{at the start of the}} file applies by default to <b>all</b> <b>frames.</b> The data is stream-oriented, so the file-offset of the start of each GCE depends on the length of preceding data. Within each frame the LZW-coded image data is arranged in sub-blocks of up to 255 bytes; the size of each sub-block is declared by the byte that precedes it.|$|E
25|$|Certain {{physical}} paradoxes defy {{common sense}} predictions about physical situations. In some cases, {{this is the}} result of modern physics correctly describing the natural world in circumstances which are far outside of everyday experience. For example, special relativity has traditionally yielded two common paradoxes: the twin paradox and the ladder paradox. Both of these paradoxes involve thought experiments which defy traditional common sense assumptions about time and space. In particular, the effects of time dilation and length contraction are used in both of these paradoxes to create situations which seemingly contradict each other. It turns out that the fundamental postulate of special relativity that the speed of light is invariant in <b>all</b> <b>frames</b> of reference requires that concepts such as simultaneity and absolute time are not applicable when comparing radically different frames of reference.|$|E

500|$|Newton's First Law of Motion {{states that}} objects {{continue}} to move {{in a state of}} constant velocity unless acted upon by an external net force (resultant force). This law is an extension of Galileo's insight that constant velocity was associated with a lack of net force (see a more detailed description of this below). Newton proposed that every object with mass has an innate inertia that functions as the fundamental equilibrium [...] "natural state" [...] in place of the Aristotelian idea of the [...] "natural state of rest". That is, Newton's empirical First Law contradicts the intuitive Aristotelian belief that a net force is required to keep an object moving with constant velocity. By making rest physically indistinguishable from non-zero constant velocity, Newton's First Law directly connects inertia with the concept of relative velocities. Specifically, in systems where objects are moving with different velocities, it is impossible to determine which object is [...] "in motion" [...] and which object is [...] "at rest". The laws of physics are the same in every inertial frame of reference, that is, in <b>all</b> <b>frames</b> related by a Galilean transformation.|$|E

2500|$|The {{size and}} color quality of {{animated}} GIF files can vary significantly {{depending on the}} application used to create them.

2500|$|A frame (or, in {{more precise}} terms, a tangent frame) is an ordered basis of {{particular}} tangent space.

[...] One may also regard a moving frame as {{a section of}} the frame bundle F(M), a [...] principal bundle made up of the set of <b>all</b> <b>frames</b> over M.

[...] This was initially interpreted to mean that the medium drags the aether along, with a portion of the medium's velocity, but that understanding became very problematic after Wilhelm Veltmann demonstrated that the index n in Fresnel's formula depended upon the wavelength of light, so that the aether could not be moving at a wavelength-independent speed. This implied that there must be a separate aether for each of the infinitely many frequencies.|$|E
