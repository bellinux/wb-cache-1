40|$|The {{role of the}} {{railways}} in the air transport industry is usually limited to provision of access to airports. However, the development of high-speed rail networks and the congestion and environmental problems faced by the air transport industry suggest {{the railways}} could have {{a greater role in}} working with the airlines to provide an integrated transport service for medium-distance journeys (up to 800 km). Many <b>air</b> <b>journeys</b> involve two flights and a transfer at a hub airport. The alternative being investigated here would replace <b>air</b> <b>journeys</b> by a rail journey and a flight and a transfer between them at the hub airport. Such integration could offer a positive alternative to aircraft on some routes and lead to railway journeys to airports becoming part of air transport services and not only to provide access to them. Integration could therefore provide a better use of available air capacity rather than duplicating some high-speed rail routes and services...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Introduction To {{the best}} of our knowledge, the {{association}} between air travel and intra-tumoral hemorrhage in pediatric populations has never been described previously. Case presentation We report the case of a two-and-a-half-year-old Caucasian, Iranian boy with a hemorrhaging brain tumor. He had a posterior fossa midline mass and severe hydrocephalus. He had been shunted for hydrocephalus four weeks earlier and was subsequently referred to our center for further treatment. The hemorrhage occurred in an infra-tentorial ependymoma, precipitated by an approximately 700 -mile <b>air</b> <b>journey</b> at a maximum altitude of 25, 000 feet. Conclusions A pre-existing intra-cranial mass lesion diminishes the ability of the brain to accommodate the mild environmental disturbances caused by hypercarbia, increased venous pressure and reduced cerebral blood flow during long air journeys. This is supported by a literature review, based on our current knowledge of physiological changes during air travel. </p...|$|E

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Air travellers' choice behaviour is fundamental to air transport system planning. The Korean international air travel market is at an expansion stage. The objective {{of this study is}} to research the choice behaviour of Korean people for their international trips. The flight choice for long distance international travel, which takes more than ten hours of <b>air</b> <b>journey</b> time was studied through analysing stated preference (SP) data as well as revealed preference (RP) data, which were gathered by the survey of this research. The study identified the major factors influencing flight choice in the market and their relative importance by constructing logit models. Separate logit models have been calibrated with RP data and with SP data. The final conclusion was obtained from a comparison of the SP and RP model, and complementary interpretation of the results of RP data and SP data analysis. The major findings of the study are; (1) identification of journey time, air fare, service frequency, and nationality of airline as major factors influencing passengers' flight choice in the market. It is remarked that Korean nationality of airline is considerably preferred in the market. Most Koreans are not fluent in foreign languages, especially English or other European languages, and they are not accustomed to Western culture, and this results in their preference for Korean airlines. (2) estimation of the value of travel time, and other relative importance of variables. For RP data, not only coefficients of the model, but also intellectual interpretation of the data themselves was conducted because some coefficients of the RP model were not statistically significant...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Aeromedical {{transfer}} {{can reduce}} transfer times for primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI). Delays in dispatch {{of the helicopter}} and landing-reperfusion can reduce the benefits of air travel. The ad hoc nature of these transfers may compound delays. A formal aeromedical transfer service, with rapid dispatch protocols and rapid landing to balloon times could significantly reduce reperfusion times. METHODS: A standard operating procedure (SOP) was developed using a field assessment team (doctor, aircrew paramedic) and a cardiologist-led multidisciplinary team meeting the incoming aircraft. The aeromedical SOP for STEMI care was implemented when anticipated land journey > 30 min to the nearest PPCI centre. Reperfusion times for actual air travel and estimated virtual land journeys from the same location were compared. RESULTS: Between April and December 2009, 8 patients were managed according to the aeromedical SOP. Median air distance 49 miles and road, 40 miles. All subsequent data shown in median minutes (range). Call-balloon time 109 (97 - 116). Call-aeromedical activation 13 (9 - 26). Aeromedical activation-arrive scene 12 (9 - 16). Time at scene 29 (24 - 52). Call-depart scene 57 (45 - 75). <b>Air</b> <b>journey</b> 25 (18 - 30) and landing-balloon 21 (8 - 22). Call-arrive at PPCI centre for air 85 (70 - 95); estimated virtual road call-arrive at PPCI centre 102 (85 - 104). CONCLUSIONS: This SOP delivered sub 120 min call-balloon times in all cases undergoing PPCI from difficult locations where anticipated land journeys were > 30 min. With longer anticipated land journeys (or more remote locations) the proportional gains with air transfer will be greater. Subject to a formal SOP and very rapid landing-balloon times, aeromedical transfer can significantly {{reduce the number of}} patients suffering long reperfusion delays in acute myocardial infarction.

40|$|We {{describe}} the airplane-related headache {{of one of}} the authors (Fa. M.) and offer a joint consideration of it. When the author in question was 7 years old, he had a first episode of acute frontal bilateral sinusitis with fever, and two further episodes at 14 and 22 years. Since then he suffered no further symptom of rhinitis or sinusitis. At the age of 29 years, he flew for the first time; it was November, and the flight was from Milan to Maldives Islands and lasted 10 h; it was very pleasant and he experienced no problems. Some months later, in June, during a short <b>air</b> <b>journey</b> from Verona to Neaples lasting about 1. 5 h, while approaching the landing (the plane was approximatively 500 m above the airport), he experienced a sudden, sharp pain of very high intensity located in the right periorbital region, associated with profuse tearing, conjunctival injection and ptosis. He did not check for the presence of miosis in that instance. During the attack he was irritable and found it difficult to stay in his seat. He had to strongly press with his hand on the right fronto-orbital region, but found only very mild relief. After 5 min, the pain diminished and disappeared in 15 – 20 min; a light dysaesthesia persisted in the same area for 20 min. This was a very unpleasant experience, as the pain was really unbearable, and could be described as ‘thunderclap like’. Three days later, returning home by airplane, he took sodium naproxene 550 mg, one tablet, during take off and suffered no disturbance. Since then, every time he flies (about four times per year), 1 h before landing he takes a tablet of sodium naproxene 550 mg and has never experienced ‘airplane headache’ (1 – 3) again, until 2 years ago when, returning from a holiday spent in Greece, he forgot to take his naproxene: during landing, he then experienced the same signs and symptoms described above. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MR and angio-MRI were normal. He has a personal and familial history negative for headache. The authors deem it worthwhile to share this personal experience with the readers of Cephalalgia for several reasons. It adds a new case (the second Italian case) to the limited series published up until now (1 – 4). With reference to the paper by Mainardi et al. (3), this experience confirms the fairly stereotyped presentation of ‘airplane headache’ as far as sex, age of onset, pain location, unilaterality, intensity, duration and onset at landing are concerned; however, vegetative symptoms of the trigeminal autonomic cephalalgia series and transient dysaesthesia of the area were also present, somewhat expanding the spectrum of the clinical presentation of this kind of headache (4). An inconsistent action of ibuprofen has been described (4). This is the first report of the apparent good effectiveness of naproxene in this condition: a very simple preventive therapy with this drug proved successful in avoiding further attacks. We expect this form of headache not being rare in the general population: it is probably underreported due to its short duration and spontaneous remission. Therefore, this simple therapeutic measure, if its efficacy is confirmed in other cases, could be of help, avoiding an unpleasant and worrying condition that could, as might have been in the present case, limit the use of air travel for many people...|$|E
