5|$|The {{award of}} the 2012 Summer Olympics to London {{has brought the}} {{question}} of British participation in the football tournaments to the fore, given that there is traditionally no single British national football team. The British Olympic Association initially refused {{to rule out the}} possibility of entry for 2008, but were unable to come to an agreement with the Scottish Football Association. The 2007 European Under-21 Championship, which served as the European qualifying tournament for the men's competition, saw the England U-21 team reach the semi-finals, which would have meant a place <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Olympics.</b> Because <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Olympics</b> the team is representative of the entire UK, England were thus prevented from taking this place, with instead a play-off taking place between Portugal and Italy. A similar situation occurred with the England Women's team who, by virtue of being one of the top three European sides at the 2007 World Cup, would have been granted a place <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Olympics.</b> Instead, there was a play-off between Denmark and Sweden.|$|E

5|$|The pitch {{invasion}} at the 1924 Paris Olympics {{had given}} rugby a poor image and this, {{together with the}} problems of attracting sufficient teams to make it a viable sport and the desire to include more individual and women's events, spelled the death knell for rugby <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Olympics.</b>|$|E
