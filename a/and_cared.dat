5|$|Children {{survived the}} Jastrebarsko and Donja Reka camps only because {{concerned}} individuals from Zagreb, Jastrebarsko, and surrounding villages offered humanitarian aid.

40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to {{understand}} the dynamics that bring forth the production <b>and</b> reduction of <b>care</b> avoidance <b>and</b> <b>care</b> paralysis. <b>Care</b> avoidance <b>and</b> <b>care</b> paralysis not only coincide, they reinforce and recall each other. Sometimes care workers however produce situations in which these phenomena are pushed back, situations in which trust and initiative – the opposite of <b>care</b> avoidance <b>and</b> <b>care</b> paralysis – appear. Pushing back <b>care</b> avoidance <b>and</b> <b>care</b> paralysis is linked to a style of work: establishing contact from a starting point of acceptance; looking for opportunities for affirmation; marking (small) progress. <b>Care</b> avoidance <b>and</b> <b>care</b> paralysis cannot thrive under conditions as: the proximity between the local population <b>and</b> <b>care</b> facilities; the committed involvement of professionals to a fixed territory; a network wherein signals (of nuisance or deprivation) and actions can be linked; discretional space for professionals to develop initiatives; a small-scale service level so that key figures from the local population and professionals of the care facilities can axially know each other; and finally a moral framework where indifference is brought up for discussion...|$|R
5|$|In February and March 1936, Berkman {{underwent}} {{a pair of}} prostate gland operations. Recuperating in Nice <b>and</b> <b>cared</b> for by his companion, Emmy Eckstein, he missed Goldman's sixty-seventh birthday in Saint-Tropez in June. She wrote in sadness, but he never read the letter; she received a call {{in the middle of}} the night that Berkman was in great distress. She left for Nice immediately but when she arrived that morning, Goldman found that he had shot himself and was in a nearly comatose paralysis. He died later that evening.|$|E
5|$|Morgan {{had waited}} until her {{academic}} rank was secure before becoming pregnant. She {{had a son}} in 1923, {{the same year that}} she became a full professor. Colleagues were surprised when she had the baby, as she had not mentioned being pregnant and she hid the physical evidence of her pregnancy with her long laboratory jacket. Morgan remembered the reaction of one male colleague when she told him the news; he said if she had five children like he did, she would have hardly noticed the new baby. Morgan's mother moved in with her <b>and</b> <b>cared</b> for the baby so that Morgan could work uninterrupted.|$|E
5|$|The Fifth Test. saw Miller take a wicket in each innings. Australia {{were left}} {{a target of}} 214 runs on a wearing wicket. Wright beat Miller with three {{consecutive}} leg breaks, but Miller survived and struck consecutive boundaries {{on the way to}} reaching the target. Australia had taken the series 3–0; Miller scored 384 runs at 76.80 and took 16 wickets at 20.88, which placed him second in both the batting and bowling averages, to Bradman and Lindwall respectively. Nevertheless, Miller had become disillusioned with Bradman's ruthless mentality. Miller was impulsive <b>and</b> <b>cared</b> little for records or ruthlessly dominating his opponents, preferring to play in a flamboyant manner in close contests.|$|E

5|$|As {{early as}} 1929 there were {{suggestions}} that the castle {{should be taken}} under French control. On 16November 1933 Krak des Chevaliers was given into {{the control of the}} French state, <b>and</b> <b>cared</b> for by the Académie des Beaux-Arts. The villagers were moved and paid F1million between them in compensation. Over the following two years a programme of cleaning and restoration was carried out by a force of 120workers. Once finished, Krak des Chevaliers was one of the key tourist attractions in the French Levant. Pierre Coupel, who had undertaken similar work at the Tower of the Lions and the two castles at Sidon, supervised the work. Despite the restoration, no archaeological excavations were carried out. The French Mandate of Syria and Lebanon, which had been established in 1920, ended in 1946 with the declaration of Syrian independence. The castle was made a World Heritage Site by UNESCO, along with Qal’at Salah El-Din, in 2006, and is owned by the Syrian government.|$|E
5|$|C.T. Rogerson {{was born}} on October 2, 1918, in Ogden, Utah, to parents Elijah Knapp Rogerson (1899–1956) and Mable Crissie Clarke Rogerson (1897–1987). Upon {{graduating from high school}} in 1936, he {{enrolled}} in Weber Junior College (since renamed to Weber State University) for the following two years. Rogerson then attended Utah State University, where he had hoped to work under the supervision of botanist Bassett Maguire, but settled instead for the only available studentship with plant pathologist B.L. Richards. Rogerson received his bachelor of science from Utah State University in 1940. Soon after, he was drafted into the army, and spent three years (1942–1945) in the Pacific Theater of World War II. He served as a technical sergeant in laboratory and pharmacy at an army evacuation hospital, <b>and</b> <b>cared</b> for internees released in the Philippines near the war's end. During his war years, Rogerson made collections of plants, fungi, slime molds, and butterflies that he sent to Cornell or to the Smithsonian Institution.|$|E

5|$|In January 1945 a trainload of 250 Jews who {{had been}} {{rejected}} as workers at a mine in Goleschau in Poland arrived at Brünnlitz. The boxcars were frozen shut when they arrived, and Emilie Schindler waited while an engineer from the factory opened the cars using a soldering iron. Twelve people were dead in the cars, and the remainder were too ill and feeble to work. Emilie took the survivors into the factory <b>and</b> <b>cared</b> for them in a makeshift hospital {{until the end of}} the war. Schindler continued to bribe SS officials to prevent the slaughter of his workers as the Red Army approached. On 7 May 1945 he and his workers gathered on the factory floor to listen to British Prime Minister Winston Churchill announce over the radio that Germany had surrendered, and the war in Europe was over.|$|E

In the two years Karman lived with them, the family raised him to be a devout Muslim; Karman, for his part, was a diligent worker <b>and</b> <b>cared</b> deeply for Rifah. When his uncle returned from the front, Karman was brought back home and educated until junior high school, dropping out for a lack of funds.

Plagued by recurring nightmares that featured a mysterious man, the girl consults Bunnyguru, a rabbit that lives {{in the bottom of}} the tree where the girl makes her home. Bunniguru offers a vision of a city far away from the girl's home. The girl is then sent by Blister into a forest to investigate why the Tree of Life is losing its leaves, where she discovers that one of the keepers of the forest has been kidnapped and taken to the city from Bunnyguru's vision, and becomes tasked with seeing to the keeper of the forest's safe return.|$|E

5|$|Sereno E. Payne, {{chairman}} of the House Ways and Means Committee, had held hearings in late 1908, and sponsored the resulting draft legislation. On balance, the bill reduced tariffs slightly, but when it passed the House in April 1909 and reached the Senate, the {{chairman of}} the Senate Finance Committee, Rhode Island Senator Nelson W. Aldrich, attached many amendments raising rates. This outraged progressives such as Wisconsin's Robert M. La Follette, who urged Taft to say that the bill was not in accord with the party platform. Taft refused, angering them. Taft insisted that most imports from the Philippines be free of duty, and according to Anderson, showed effective leadership on a subject he was knowledgeable on <b>and</b> <b>cared</b> about.|$|E
5|$|The party spent a {{total of}} 11days {{traversing}} the North China Plain via the Grand Canal before reaching Tongzhou District, {{where there was a}} large warehouse depot adjunct to the capital city. From there they left their courier ships and traveled by donkey and foot towards the capital Beijing, where they lodged at the Central Courier Hostel. The Ming court granted the Korean party gifts of fine clothes during their stay. On June 3, the officer in charge of Choe's escort notified the transport office in Beijing that three carriages plus horses and donkeys would be needed in the journey to the Korean border; when these were granted in the morning, the party swiftly departed from Beijing. Choe was not sad to leave the sights of Beijing behind, as he found the people there to be obsessed with business <b>and</b> <b>cared</b> little for agriculture or farming, a clear indication of his Confucian-oriented values.|$|E
5|$|With Merrick {{admitted}} into the hospital, Treves now {{had time to}} conduct a more thorough examination. He discovered that Merrick's physical condition had deteriorated over {{the previous two years}} and that he had become quite crippled by his deformities. Treves also suspected that Merrick now suffered from a heart condition and that he had only a few years left to live. Merrick's general health improved over the next five months under the care of the hospital staff. Although some nurses were initially upset by his appearance, they overcame this <b>and</b> <b>cared</b> for him. The problem of his unpleasant odour was mitigated through frequent bathing and Treves gradually developed an understanding of Merrick's speech. A new set of photographs was taken. The question of Merrick's long-term care had to be addressed. Francis Carr Gomm, the chairman of the hospital committee, had supported Treves in his decision to admit Merrick, but by November, long-term plans needed to be made. The London Hospital was not equipped or staffed to provide care for the incurable, which Merrick clearly was.|$|E
