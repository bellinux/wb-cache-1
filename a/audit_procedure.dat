40|$|The {{purpose of}} the thesis was to {{research}} the regulatory framework of the Greek tax <b>audit</b> <b>procedure</b> and its application by the tax authorities under a constitutional aspect, in order to propose a constitutional “model” of the tax audit. For this purpose, the constitutional and institutional framework of the tax procedure {{as well as the}} tax <b>audit</b> <b>procedure</b> was examined. Then, the constitutional rules and principles that should apply for the formation of the regulatory framework and during the execution of the tax audit were examined. The thesis shows that the current tax <b>audit</b> <b>procedure</b> introduces several constitutional issues. More specifically, the regulatory framework of the tax audit does not agree with the principles of good legislation. Furthermore, the tax administration knows almost no strategic planning nor is it stuffed with capable civil servants, which are constantly educated and valuated. In addition, the ambiguous regulatory framework of preventive, temporary and supplementary tax audit may cause contradictions and phenomena of arbitrariness against the tax payers. The same applies for some of the methods for the simplification of the tax <b>audit</b> <b>procedure,</b> {{such as the use of}} computed values and the automated closure of the tax cases. Questions are also raised in connection with the constitutionality of measures, such as the prolonging of the time of the statute of limitation of the right of the State to issue tax assessments acts. Moreover, the classification of the majority of the tax sanctions as administrative sanctions, though some of the have the characteristics of penal sanctions, has as a result that the taxpayers are not entitled to fundamental defend rights. Furthermore, the right of tax secrecy is violated by the numerous exemptions of the said secrecy. Anti-constitutional limitations are also introduced as far as the right of hearing and the access right are concerned. Finally, the one-dimensional superiority recognised in favour of the public revenue interest indirectly causes many of the constitutional problems of the tax <b>audit</b> <b>procedure.</b> ...|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to explore {{perceptions}} of fraud detection techniques in the stock and warehouse cycle in Barbados. Design/methodology/approach – The study uses a self-administered questionnaire, adapted and modified from Owusu-Ansah et al. The sample is comprised of 64 auditors. The study examines the perceived effectiveness of <b>audit</b> <b>procedures,</b> the influence of size of the audit firm, and the level of audit experience in the choice of specific <b>audit</b> <b>procedures.</b> Findings – The study indicates that there is a moderate to high perceived effectiveness of standard <b>audit</b> <b>procedures</b> in the detection of fraud in the stock and warehousing cycle in Barbados and that the majority of the “more effective” <b>audit</b> <b>procedures</b> can be classified as field research techniques that are more direct in obtaining evidence. It is found that auditors from larger firms reported higher means for <b>audit</b> <b>procedures.</b> There are mixed findings with respect to the significant relationship between level of auditing experience of auditors and perceived effectiveness of fraud detection techniques. The study also indicates that males consistently rated the level of effectiveness of <b>audit</b> <b>procedures</b> higher than females. Research limitations/implications – Due to the relatively small sample size, these findings should be interpreted with caution. Nonetheless, the findings of this study do indicate that <b>auditing</b> <b>procedures</b> in this developing country are on par with those of developed countries. Practical implications – This paper serves to inform audit-related policies and regulation on the potential threats within the stock and warehouse cycle. Originality/value – This paper contributes to the limited body of research on fraud detection within the stock and warehouse cycle in small developing countries.

The main purpose of the thesis was to evaluate the impact of tax judicature on the process of tax audit including the successive acts. Furthermore, the thesis should evaluate the view on tax administration of tax <b>audit</b> <b>procedure</b> reflecting the changes in judicature. The interpretation given by the judicature should be helping by illustration of the tax audit particular phases. Moreover, it should guarantee adequate level of peace to the tax subjects and tax administrators as well during this procedure.

It also helped for better understanding of the current tax code tax audit paragraphs. Anyway, from the point of view of the controversy between two Czech main courts - the Constitutional Court and the Supreme Administrative Court - the absolute peace during the tax <b>audit</b> <b>procedure</b> is not achievable. From all these facts, as well as from the difficultness of following all the actual judicature concerned, I concluded, the function of the new tax code is unavoidable...|$|E

40|$|I {{formulate}} {{a model to}} emphasize the fraud detection role of auditors in the financial market, providing a theoretical framework to examine the likelihood of and market reaction to a financial reporting and audit delay. The model has an auditor considering whether to perform extended <b>audit</b> <b>procedures</b> after observing a red flag generated from regular <b>audit</b> <b>procedures.</b> An <b>audit</b> delay {{is represented by the}} event of extending <b>audit</b> <b>procedures</b> and manifested as a financial reporting delay observed by the market. I find that the equilibrium likelihood of a delay decreases when the reliability of regular and extended <b>audit</b> <b>procedures</b> improves and/or when the ex ante probability of fraud reduces. My result on the market reaction to a delay suggests that while a negative average reaction is intuitive and has been documented, the reaction can be positive for an individual firm. I derive a closed-form condition indicating when a positive reaction is possible. Specifically, a delay can be good news to the market when the ex ante probability of fraud, the imprecision of a red flag, and the effectiveness of extended <b>audit</b> <b>procedures</b> for detecting fraud are all high. The result is new in the literature. I also discuss the model's empirical implications with suggestions for regression equation specifications. ...|$|R
