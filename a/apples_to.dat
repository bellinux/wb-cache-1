5|$|In Norse mythology, {{the goddess}} Iðunn is {{portrayed in the}} Prose Edda (written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson) as {{providing}} <b>apples</b> <b>to</b> the gods that give them eternal youthfulness. English scholar H. R. Ellis Davidson links <b>apples</b> <b>to</b> religious practices in Germanic paganism, from which Norse paganism developed. She points out that buckets of apples {{were found in the}} Oseberg ship burial site in Norway, and that fruit and nuts (Iðunn having been described as being transformed into a nut in Skáldskaparmál) have been found in the early graves of the Germanic peoples in England and elsewhere on the continent of Europe, which may have had a symbolic meaning, and that nuts are still a recognized symbol of fertility in southwest England.|$|E

5|$|Mermaids {{from the}} Isle of Man, known as ben-varrey, are {{considered}} more favorable toward humans {{than those of}} other regions, with various accounts of assistance, gifts and rewards. One story tells of a fisherman who carried a stranded mermaid back into the sea and was rewarded with the location of treasure. Another recounts {{the tale of a}} baby mermaid who stole a doll from a human little girl, but was rebuked by her mother and sent back to the girl with a gift of a pearl necklace to atone for the theft. A third story tells of a fishing family that made regular gifts of <b>apples</b> <b>to</b> a mermaid and was rewarded with prosperity.|$|E
50|$|Motorola {{had promised}} <b>Apple</b> <b>to</b> deliver parts with speed up to 500 MHz, but yields proved too low initially. This forced <b>Apple</b> <b>to</b> {{take back the}} advertised 500 MHz models of PowerMac G4. The Power Mac series was {{downgraded}} abruptly from 400, 450, and 500 MHz processor speeds to 350, 400, and 450 MHz while problems with the chip were ironed out. The incident generated a rift in the Apple-Motorola relationship, and reportedly caused <b>Apple</b> <b>to</b> ask IBM for assistance to get the production yields up on the Motorola 7400 series line. The 500 MHz model was reintroduced on February 16, 2000.|$|R
50|$|The king saw how his {{youngest}} daughter was always sad. His councilors suggested {{that all the}} princes and nobles should walk under the gate, and whoever the princess dropped a golden <b>apple</b> <b>to</b> would be her husband. They all walked, {{but she did not}} drop the apple. Then all the servants, last of all the bald undergardner, as Făt-Frumos appeared. She dropped the <b>apple</b> <b>to</b> him. The king refused, but after three times, she had dropped the <b>apple</b> <b>to</b> him every time. They married quietly and the king gave them a hut in a distant corner of his courtyard.|$|R

5|$|Some {{surviving}} stories regarding Iðunn {{focus on}} her youth-maintaining apples. English scholar Hilda Ellis Davidson links <b>apples</b> <b>to</b> religious practices in Germanic paganism.

25|$|Since 1988, Druze clerics {{have been}} {{permitted}} to make annual religious pilgrimages to Syria. Since 2005, Israel has allowed Druze farmers to export some 11,000 tons of <b>apples</b> <b>to</b> the rest of Syria each year, constituting the first commercial relations between Syria and Israel.|$|E

25|$|Members of the UNDOF and UNTSO {{are usually}} the only {{individuals}} to cross the Israeli-Syrian ceasefire line through the zone. Since 1988, Israel has allowed Druze pilgrims to cross the ceasefire line to visit the shrine of Abel in Syria. In the Al Qunaytirah area, a company monitors the main roads leading into the AOS. Several times during the year Israel and Syria permit crossings of Arab citizens {{under the supervision of}} the International Committee of the Red Cross at an unofficial gate in the area. These people are pilgrims and students of the University of Damascus living in the Golan Heights or Israel. In 2005, Syria allowed a few trucks of Druze-grown Golan <b>apples</b> <b>to</b> be crossed. The trucks themselves were driven by Kenyan nationals.|$|E
25|$|In March 1978, the Golden Gaters {{acquired}} Virginia Wade in {{a three-way}} {{trade with the}} Apples and the Seattle Cascades. Under the deal, Wade went from the <b>Apples</b> <b>to</b> the Golden Gaters, JoAnne Russell went from the Cascades to the Apples and Marita Redondo went from the Golden Gaters to the Cascades. Redondo did not play in WTT in 1977. After the 1977 season, she had been drafted by the Golden Gaters but not signed. Tom Okker {{did not return to}} WTT for the 1978 season. He played clay-court tournaments in Europe which conflict with the WTT schedule. Player-coach Frew McMillan was the only Golden Gaters returning player in 1978. In addition to newcomers Mayer and Wade, Ilana Kloss returned to the league and the team after a two-year absence, and the Golden Gaters signed Michael Wayman and Marise Kruger. In June, the Golden Gaters hired Tom Dietrich as assistant coach replacing Henry Schneidman who remained with the organization. Just {{before the start of the}} playoffs, the Golden Gaters signed Tom Leonard who was a regular member of the playoff lineup.|$|E
25|$|The {{comparative}} use of Census Bureau data, {{as well as}} most {{sources of}} demographic income data, has been questioned by statisticians for being unable to account for 'mobility of incomes'. At any given time, the Census Bureau ranks all households by household income and then divides this distribution of households into quintiles. The highest-ranked household in each quintile provides the upper income limit for each quintile. Comparing changes in these upper income limits for different quintiles is how changes are measured between one moment in time and the next. The problem with inferring income inequality on this basis is that the census statistics provide only a snapshot of income distribution in the U.S., at individual points in time. The statistics do not reflect the reality that income for many households changes over time – i.e., incomes are mobile. For most people, income increases over time as they move from their first, low-paying job in high school to a better-paying job later in their lives. Also, some people lose income over time because of business-cycle contractions, demotions, career changes, retirement, etc. The implication of changing individual incomes is that individual households do not remain in the same income quintiles over time. Thus, comparing different income quintiles over time is like comparing <b>apples</b> <b>to</b> oranges, because it means comparing incomes of different people at different stages in their earnings profile.|$|E

500|$|Pip, Giselle's best {{chipmunk}} {{friend from}} Andalasia, had witnessed Giselle's exile and alerted Edward thereafter, and both {{embark on a}} rescue mission to the city, where they too are turned into 3D live-action versions, but Pip is instead {{in the form of}} a real chipmunk – therefore losing the ability to speak. Narissa sends Nathaniel to follow and impede Edward. In a restaurant, Narissa appears to Nathaniel in a soup pot and gives him three poisoned <b>apples</b> <b>to</b> murder Giselle. Pip eavesdrops but is unable to communicate with Edward, as animals cannot speak outside of Andalasia. Nathaniel keeps Pip silenced by detaining him in various containers. Meanwhile, after Giselle summons vermin to clean Robert's apartment, Nancy arrives to take Morgan to school. She meets Giselle and leaves assuming Robert was unfaithful. Robert is initially upset but spends the day with Giselle, knowing she is vulnerable in the city. Giselle questions Robert about his relationship with Nancy and helps the pair reconcile by sending Nancy an invitation to the [...] "King and Queen's Costume Ball" [...] at the Woolworth Building.|$|E
500|$|Sumbel {{often takes}} place {{following}} a blót. In the U.S., the sumbel commonly involves a drinking horn being filled with mead and passed among the assembled participants, who either drink from it directly, or pour some {{into their own}} drinking vessels to consume. During this process, toasts are made, as are verbal tributes to gods, heroes, and ancestors. Then, oaths and boasts (promises of future actions) might be made, {{both of which are}} considered binding on the speakers due to the sacred context of the sumbel ceremony. According to Snook, the sumbel has a strong social role, representing [...] "a game of politicking, of socializing, cementing bonds of peace and friendship and forming new relationships" [...] within the Heathen community. During her ethnographic research, Pizza observed an example of a sumbel that took place in Minnesota in 2006 with the purpose of involving Heathen children; rather than mead, the drinking horn contained apple juice, and the toasting accompanied the children taping pictures of <b>apples</b> <b>to</b> a poster of a tree that symbolized the apple tree of Iðunn from Norse mythology.|$|E
