5|$|The Chester Canal was an English canal {{linking the}} south Cheshire town of Nantwich with the River Dee at Chester. It was {{intended}} to link Chester to Middlewich, with a branch to Nantwich, but the Trent and Mersey Canal were unco-operative about a junction at Middlewich, and so the route to Nantwich was opened in 1779. There were also difficulties negotiating with the River Dee Company, and with no possibility of through traffic, the canal was uneconomic. Part of it was closed in 1787, when Beeston staircase locks collapsed, {{and there was no}} money to fund repairs. When the Ellesmere Canal was proposed in 1790, the company saw it as <b>a</b> <b>ray</b> <b>of</b> hope, and somehow managed to keep the struggling canal open. The Ellesmere Canal provided a link to the River Mersey at Ellesmere Port from 1797, and the fortunes of the Chester Canal began to improve.|$|E
5|$|The Doctor and Clara {{attend the}} ceremony, where the Doctor {{explains}} {{that since the}} Rings were settled {{there has been a}} constant song sung to keep an angry god asleep. The people fear that the god, which they call Grandfather, will awaken and consume the entire universe if the song is ever interrupted. Merry begins singing, joined by a chorister at the pyramid. During the song, a mummy in a glass case at the pyramid begins to awaken. Merry panics, believing she got the song wrong. A beam of light from the pyramid envelops her, and she is pulled toward the pyramid and the mummy. The Doctor and Clara find Dor'een and rent the space bike using Clara's mother's ring as payment. They ride the bike to the pyramid where they find the mummy struggling to escape the case and consume Merry's soul. The Doctor promises Merry that she does not have to sacrifice herself and that he will stop Grandfather. As they attempt to leave, a group of creatures called the Vigil arrive and attempt to force Merry to sacrifice herself. The Doctor holds the Vigil at bay long enough to let Clara and Merry escape from the throne room, but then the case shatters and the mummy breaks free. <b>A</b> <b>ray</b> <b>of</b> light strikes the planet, revealing that Grandfather is Akhaten itself, a planet-sized parasitic creature.|$|E

25|$|When <b>a</b> <b>ray</b> <b>of</b> light {{hits the}} {{boundary}} between two transparent materials, it is divided into a reflected and a refracted ray.|$|E
25|$|The laws of {{reflection}} and refraction {{can be derived}} from Fermat's principle which states that the path taken between two points by <b>a</b> <b>ray</b> <b>of</b> light is the path that can be traversed in the least time.|$|E
25|$|In his Catoptrica, Hero of Alexandria showed by a {{geometrical}} {{method that}} the actual path taken by <b>a</b> <b>ray</b> <b>of</b> light reflected from a plane mirror is shorter than any other reflected path that might be drawn between the source and point of observation.|$|E

25|$|A {{positive}} Verdet constant {{corresponds to}} L-rotation (anticlockwise) when {{the direction of}} propagation {{is parallel to the}} magnetic field and to R-rotation (clockwise) when the direction of propagation is anti-parallel. Thus, if <b>a</b> <b>ray</b> <b>of</b> light is passed through a material and reflected back through it, the rotation doubles.|$|E
25|$|Gratings {{may be of}} the 'reflective' or 'transmissive' type, {{analogous}} to a mirror or lens, respectively. A grating has a 'zero-order mode' (where m = 0), {{in which there is}} no diffraction and <b>a</b> <b>ray</b> <b>of</b> light behaves according to the laws of reflection and refraction the same as with a mirror or lens, respectively.|$|E
25|$|In nearby Lestelle-Bétharram, {{only a few}} {{kilometres}} from Lourdes, some shepherds guarding their flocks in {{the mountains}} observed a vision of <b>a</b> <b>ray</b> <b>of</b> light that guided them {{to the discovery of}} a statue of the Virgin Mary. Two attempts were made to remove the statue to a more prominent position; each time it disappeared and returned to its original location, at which a small chapel was built for it.|$|E

25|$|In {{the south}} {{transept}} window a small opening with a lens was set up, so that <b>a</b> <b>ray</b> <b>of</b> sunlight shines onto the brass line. At noon on {{the winter solstice}} (21 December), the ray of light touches the brass line on the obelisk. At noon on the equinoxes (21 March and 21 September), the ray touches an oval plate of copper in the floor near the altar.|$|E
25|$|The Cathedral has a {{prominent}} role in determining the beginning of the Pisan New Year. Between the tenth century and 1749, when the Tuscan calendar was reformed, Pisa used its own calendar, in which {{the first day of the}} year was March 25, the feast day of the Annunciation of Mary. Years were counted such that the Pisan New Year begins 9 months before the ordinary one. The exact moment is determined by <b>a</b> <b>ray</b> <b>of</b> sun that, through a window on the left side, falls on an egg-shaped marble, just above the pulpit by Giovanni Pisano; this occurs at noon.|$|E
25|$|Whenever <b>a</b> <b>ray</b> <b>of</b> light {{moves from}} one medium to another (for example, when light enters {{a sheet of}} glass after {{travelling}} through air), some portion of the light is reflected from the surface (known as the interface) between the two media. This can be observed when looking through a window, for instance, where a (weak) reflection from {{the front and back}} surfaces of the window glass can be seen. The strength of the reflection depends on the ratio of the refractive indices of the two media, as well as the angle of the surface to the beam of light. The exact value can be calculated using the Fresnel equations.|$|E

25|$|In the legend, Afonso Henriques is visited {{before the}} battle {{by an old}} man who saw in a dream that Henriques would be victorious because God would {{intervene}} in his favour. He advised the nobleman to leave the encampment alone when he heard the bell of the local chapel. Riding off he was surprised by <b>a</b> <b>ray</b> <b>of</b> light that showed him (in one interpretation) {{the sign of the cross}} and Jesus Christ on a crucifix. Afonso Henriques knelt in its presence and heard the voice of Christ who told him he would defeat the Moors, which he, through courage and his faith, succeeded the following day.|$|E
25|$|The Cenotaph, {{situated}} in {{the centre of the}} Cenotaph Hall, is the central focus of the monument. In addition to being viewable from the Hall of Heroes it can also be seen from the dome {{at the top of the}} building, from where much of the interior of the monument can be viewed. Through an opening in this dome <b>a</b> <b>ray</b> <b>of</b> sunlight shines at twelve o'clock on 16 December annually, falling onto the centre of the Cenotaph, striking the words 'Ons vir Jou, Suid-Afrika' (Afrikaans for 'Us for you, South Africa'). The ray of light is said to symbolise God's blessing on the lives and endeavours of the Voortrekkers. 16 December 1838 was the date of the Battle of Blood River, commemorated in South Africa before 1994 as the Day of the Vow.|$|E

500|$|Built from Tynong granite, the Shrine {{originally}} consisted only of {{the central}} sanctuary surrounded by the ambulatory. The sanctuary contains the marble Stone of Remembrance, upon which is engraved the words [...] "Greater love hath no man". Once a year, on 11 November at 11a.m. (Remembrance Day), <b>a</b> <b>ray</b> <b>of</b> sunlight shines through an aperture in the roof to light up the word [...] "Love" [...] in the inscription. [...] Beneath the sanctuary lies the crypt, which contains a bronze statue of a soldier father and son, and panels listing every unit of the Australian Imperial Force.|$|E
500|$|The {{inscription}} {{is part of}} a verse {{from the}} Bible (John 15:13) [...] "Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends." [...] The Stone is aligned with an aperture in the roof of the Sanctuary so that <b>a</b> <b>ray</b> <b>of</b> sunlight falls on the word LOVE on the Stone of Remembrance at exactly 11a.m. on 11 November, [...] marking the hour and day of the Armistice which ended World War I. Since the introduction of daylight saving in Victoria, the ray of sunlight is no longer {{in the right place at}} 11a.m. A mirror has been installed to direct sunlight onto the Stone at 11a.m. During the rest of the year, a light is used to simulate the effect.|$|E
