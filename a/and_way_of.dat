5|$|I think {{everyone}} who disses the Columbine RPG is gutless. Most haven't played the game, or have played it with such preconceptions that they're blinded to the genuis , the honesty, {{the beauty of}} its social commentary. Super Columbine Massacre RPG is riddled with design flaws and has mediocre graphics by 1995, the maker of the game admits this, but it regardless {{is a work of}} art. It puts you in the mindset of the killers and provides a very clear suggestion of why they did what they did; they were enacting an ideological demonstration through a terrorist act, and the game shines light on this as an indictment of the American dream <b>and</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> life painfully close to the main nerve.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, he starred as Charlie Chaplin in Chaplin, a {{role for}} which he {{prepared}} extensively, learning {{how to play the}} violin and tennis left-handed. He had a personal coach in order to help him imitate Chaplin's posture <b>and</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> carrying himself. The role garnered Downey an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor at the Academy Awards 65th ceremony, losing to Al Pacino in Scent of a Woman.|$|E
5|$|In late 1888 he {{finished}} {{work on a}} fourth book, Pipes o' Pan at Zekesbury which was released to great acclaim in the United States. Based on a fictional town in Indiana, Riley presented many stories and poems about its citizens <b>and</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> life. It received mixed reviews among literary critics who wrote of it that Riley's stories were not of the same quality as his poetry. The book was very popular with the public and went through numerous reprints.|$|E

5|$|More people {{joined the}} middle class in the 1950s, with more money to spend, and the {{availability}} of consumer goods expanded along with the economy, including the automobile. Americans were spending more time in their automobiles and viewing them as an extension of their identity, which helped to fuel a boom in automobile sales. Most businesses directly or indirectly related to the auto industry saw tremendous growth during the decade. New designs and innovations appealed to a generation tuned into fashion and glamour, and the new-found freedom <b>and</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> life in the suburbs had several unforeseen consequences for the inner cities. The 1950s saw the beginning of white flight and urban sprawl, driven by increasing automobile ownership. Many local and national transportation laws encouraged suburbanization, which in time ended up damaging the cities economically.|$|E
5|$|The renewed {{interest}} in residential schools in the early 1800s {{has been linked to}} the decline in military hostility faced by British settlers, particularly after the War of 1812. With the threat of invasion by American forces minimized, Indigenous communities were no longer viewed as allies but as barriers to permanent settlement. This perspective was further underscored by the transfer of affairs with Indigenous communities from military officials, familiar with and sympathetic to their customs <b>and</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> life, to civilian representatives concerned only with permanent colonial settlement.|$|E

40|$|This study {{analyzed}} {{the construction of}} the concepts “science,” “scientific literacy,” and “Indigenous knowledges <b>and</b> <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> knowing” in Science 10, Saskatchewan’s tenth-grade school science curriculum guide. The postcolonial discourse analysis revealed several key presuppositions of modern Western (Eurocentric) discourses in the curriculum guide. The construction of “science” and “scientific literacy” revealed assumptions characteristic of modern Western science, while “Indigenous knowledges <b>and</b> <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> knowing” were paradoxically constructed as commensurable with but other than “science. ” These findings demonstrate that Indigenous knowledges <b>and</b> <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> knowing are misunderstood in the curriculum guide. Moreover, the research suggests that thematic content may provide a better point of entry for the integration <b>of</b> Indigenous knowledges <b>and</b> <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> knowing into mainstream science programs than specific knowledge content (which may not necessarily cross cultural borders). This indicates the need to reconsider the development of multicultural science curricula across culturally diverse borders...|$|R

25|$|Aristotle, of course, was a harsh {{critic of}} the Spartan {{constitution}} <b>and</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> life. There is considerable evidence that the Spartans, certainly in the archaic period, were not educated as one-sidedly as Aristotle asserts.

25|$|The {{military}} {{discipline of}} the legions was quite harsh. Regulations were strictly enforced, and {{a broad array of}} punishments could be inflicted upon a legionary who broke them.

25|$|Polish Romanticism, unlike Romanticism in {{some other}} parts of Europe, {{was not limited to}} {{literary}} and artistic concerns.

25|$|Many of the {{minorities}} (including the Albanians, Bosnians, Crimean Tatars, and various peoples from the Caucasus, {{as well as}} some of the Turks themselves) are descendants of Muslims (muhajirs) who were expelled from the lands lost by the shrinking Ottoman Empire, but they have assimilated into and intermarried with the majority Turkish population and have adopted the Turkish language <b>and</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> life, though this does not make them ethnic Turks.|$|E
