The objectives {{of the study is}} to investigate the effect of land restoration practices on nitrogen, protein, fiber (NDF and ADF), ash and dry matter contents of three Atriplex species under different management and site conditions. The amount of nutrient contents in Atriplex species growing on <b>abandoned</b> <b>farmlands</b> under irrigation and conservation practices is higher when compared to no irrigation or control in Casa Grande research site. Atriplex species growing under mulch and water catchment condition had significantly higher nutrient content compared to other treatments.

The Atriplex cultivar planted in the winter had higher nutrient contents when compared to those planted in the summer and irrigated with a sprinkler irrigation system for some cultivars.

40|$|This paper aims {{to clarify}} the effects of direct payment in hilly and mountainous areas for {{maintaining}} ecological functions of farmlands. Two villages in the upstream district of Tokamachi-shi, Niigata Prefecture were selected as study sites for a comparison of land use and farmland management. First, patterns of land use and aspects of the local environment that made farming difficult were analyzed by using GIS. Topographic differences between still-cultivated <b>farmlands</b> and <b>abandoned</b> ones were compared in terms of two of these aspects: distance from managed farm roads and degrees of slope. We found that <b>abandoned</b> <b>farmlands</b> were further from roads and steeper than cultivated ones. Maintenance of the levees around the farmlands ceased completely after cultivation was abandoned. Secondly, we conducted a survey {{to determine how the}} local farmlands were managed and how the subsidy was affecting the maintenance of farmlands. We found that the scheme was having little effect on the re-cultivation of once-abandoned farmlands or the maintenance of farmlands. However, the subsidy was being used for joint activities by the villagers and was having a positive effect on village revitalization. It was apparent that a clear vision of those measures that could help promote the ecological functions of local farmlands was needed for the effective use of the subsidy. In conclusion, we made the following points on the maintenance and promotion of the ecological functions of farmlands and woodlands. 1) To maintain the ecological functions of farmlands, and {{as an alternative to the}} current scheme, we need a new scheme that has clear objectives with regard to the management of both <b>abandoned</b> <b>farmlands</b> and still-cultivated ones. 2) Farmers need to receive assistance in the management of woodlands, because afforestation is a legitimate way to prevent decline in the ecological functions of <b>abandoned</b> <b>farmlands</b> in areas where re-cultivation is difficult and where shrubs and trees have already begun to invade...|$|R

5|$|Most {{states had}} placed {{restrictions}} on fisher trapping by the 1930s, coincidental {{with the end}} of the logging boom. A combination of forest regrowth in <b>abandoned</b> <b>farmlands</b> and improved forest management practices increased available habitat and allowed remnant populations to recover. Populations have since recovered sufficiently that the species is no longer endangered. Increasing forest cover in eastern North America means that fisher populations will remain sufficiently robust for the near future. Between 1955 and 1985, some states had allowed limited trapping to resume. In areas where fishers were eliminated, porcupine populations subsequently increased. Areas with a high density of porcupines were found to have extensive damage to timber crops. In these cases, fishers were reintroduced by releasing adults relocated from other places into the forest. Once the fisher populations became reestablished, porcupine numbers returned to natural levels. In Washington State, fisher sightings were reported into the 1980s, but an extensive survey in the 1990s did not locate any.|$|R
40|$|Biodiversity in managed {{plantations}} {{has become}} an important issue for long-term sustainability of ecosystems. The environmental effects of plantations comprised of fast-growing introduced trees have been vigorously debated. On one hand, monocultures have been said to exhaust resources, resulting in decreased biodiversity. Conversely, it has been stated that monocultures may favor regeneration of undergrowth plants from surrounding forests, increasing biodiversity. In order to clarify the effects of planting Eucalyptus trees on species composition, diversity, and functional type of understory vegetation in Yunnan province, a field trial was implemented to compare Eucalyptus plantations (EPs) with two other local current vegetation types (secondary evergreen forests (SEs), and <b>abandoned</b> <b>farmlands</b> (AFs)). Each vegetation type was sampled in each of three elevational ranges (low = 1, 000 - 1, 400 meters above sea level (masl), medium = 1, 400 - 1, 800 masl, and high = 1, 800 - 2, 200 masl). Sample sites within each elevational range had similar environmental characteristics (slope, aspect, etc.). Thus, we sampled three vegetation types at each of three sites at each of three elevations {{for a total of}} 27 plots. We calculated relative abundance and importance value of species and diversity indexes to evaluate differences among local current vegetation types and elevational ranges, employing multivariate ordination analyses and other methods such as Analyses of Variance (ANOVA) and Indicator Species Analysis. We found that fast growing introduced Eucalyptus plantations led to reduced plant diversity in the study area, and that rare or threatened species were recorded almost exclusively in the SE plots, being essentially absent from the EP and AF plots. The understory plant diversity did not correlate with the altitude gradient significantly. Eucalyptus plantations (EPs) have a simpler community structure than that of either secondary evergreen forests (SEs; similar to natural state) or <b>abandoned</b> <b>farmlands</b> (AFs). No variable significantly explained variation of the understory shrub layer, but soil moisture-holding capacity and overstory coverage were significant in explaining variation of the understory herb layer, suggesting that the study of soil physical properties is necessary for better understanding of their importance in Eucalyptus plantations and other local current vegetation types...|$|R

The latter proved to be the most profitable method and was done by cultivating trade relationships with Venetia, Genoa and Barcelona, and increasing taxes on commodities.

Most of those that do can be classed as secondary rather than primary forest species, even though many primary forest species initially colonize the site. These observations were used to develop guidelines to accelerate the recovery of rainforest at degraded sites. The guidelines promote the early establishment of species that are usually poorly dispersed (e. g., large-fruited species), planted in scattered clumps.
