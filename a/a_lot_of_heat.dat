5|$|Lanthanum oxide {{is a white}} solid {{that can}} be {{prepared}} by direct reaction of its constituent elements. Due to the large size of the La3+ ion, La2O3 adopts a hexagonal 7-coordinate structure that changes to the 6-coordinate structure of scandium oxide (Sc2O3) and yttrium oxide (Y2O3) at high temperature. When it reacts with water, lanthanum hydroxide is formed: <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>heat</b> is evolved in the reaction and a hissing sound is heard.

5|$|The Sun formed about 4.6 {{billion years}} ago from the {{collapse}} of part of a giant molecular cloud that consisted mostly of hydrogen and helium and that probably gave birth to many other stars. This age is estimated using computer models of stellar evolution and through nucleocosmochronology. The result {{is consistent with the}} radiometric date of the oldest Solar System material, at 4.567 {{billion years ago}}. Studies of ancient meteorites reveal traces of stable daughter nuclei of short-lived isotopes, such as iron-60, that form only in exploding, short-lived stars. This indicates that one or more supernovae must have occurred near the location where the Sun formed. A shock wave from a nearby supernova would have triggered the formation of the Sun by compressing the matter within the molecular cloud and causing certain regions to collapse under their own gravity. As one fragment of the cloud collapsed it also began to rotate because of conservation of angular momentum and heat up with the increasing pressure. Much of the mass became concentrated in the center, whereas the rest flattened out into a disk that would become the planets and other Solar System bodies. Gravity and pressure within the core of the cloud generated <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>heat</b> as it accreted more matter from the surrounding disk, eventually triggering nuclear fusion. Thus, the Sun was born.|$|E

25|$|For {{profitable}} hemp farming, particularly deep, humus-rich, nutrient-rich {{soil with}} controlled water flow is preferable. Waterlogged acidic, compressed or extremely light (sandy) soils primarily affect the early development of plants. Steep and high altitudes {{of more than}} 400m above sea level are best avoided. Hemp is relatively insensitive to cold temperatures and can withstand frost down to −5°C. Seeds can germinate down to 1–3°C.

In general, the arguments for and against foreign bank participation in developing and transition economies are not universally acceptable and there is lack of overwhelming evidence to support either side of the dichotomy.

I killed five or six of them, and found that some of the young ones were furry enough to make coats of.

I set to work and stripped the blubber off all the seals, and cut it in squares of about six inches. Then I got a bit of one of the fresh skins, bent it up all round, of the right size for the squares to fit into, fastened it, and spread it on the rocks to dry. The thought of how I was to make wicks bothered me. I could not spare my clothes. At last, after trying different things, I found that some of the grass was very tough. I put a bundle of this in a pool, and let it lay there for a week; for I was a North of Ireland boy, and knew how they worked flax. At the end of that time I took it out, let it dry, and then bruised it between flat stones, and found that it had a tough fibre. I thanked God, and picked a lot more of it and put it to soak.

40|$|The ongoing net {{neutrality}} debate has generated <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>heated</b> discussions {{on whether or}} not monetary interactions should be regulated between content and access providers. Among the several topics discussed, `differential pricing' has recently received attention due to `zero-rating' platforms proposed by some service providers. In the differential pricing scheme, Internet Service Providers (ISPs) can exempt data traffic charges for accessing content from certain CPs or applications (zero-rated) and apply regular charges for accessing content from other CPs. This allows the possibility for Content Providers (CPs) to make `sponsorship' agreements to zero-rate their content and attract more user traffic. In this paper, we study the effect of differential pricing on various players in the Internet. We consider a model with a single ISP and multiple CPs where users select CPs based on the quality of service (QoS) and applicable traffic charges. We show that in a differential pricing regime 1) a CP offering low QoS can make more revenues than a CP offering better QoS through sponsorships. 2) QoS (mean delay) for end users can degrade compared to the case where no differential pricing is allowed...|$|R
