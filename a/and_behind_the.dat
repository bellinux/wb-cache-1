5|$|The black-{{shoulder}}ed kite {{is very similar}} to the related raptor species, the letter-winged kite (E.scriptus) but has the black mark above <b>and</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> eye, a white rather than grey crown, and shows all-white underparts in flight except for the black patch at the shoulder and dark wingtips.|$|E

5|$|After his {{retirement}} from professional football, he had short spells with four non-league clubs. He {{started to take}} his coaching qualifications {{at the age of}} 25, and since ending his playing career he has held a variety of roles in coaching <b>and</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> scenes, including spells as a coach at Accrington Stanley and Preston North End. He also held the positions of assistant manager and caretaker manager at Great Harwood Town and Rochdale, where he was also a youth coach. He has also worked as a scout for Derby County, Walsall and Wigan Athletic, where he was the club's first ever full-time chief scout.|$|E
5|$|Beaches {{were blocked}} with {{entanglements}} of barbed wire, {{usually in the}} form of three coils of concertina wire fixed by metal posts, or a simple fence of straight wires supported on waist-high posts. The wire would also demarcate extensive minefields, with both anti-tank and anti-personnel mines on <b>and</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> beaches. On many of the more remote beaches this combination of wire and mines represented {{the full extent of the}} passive defences.|$|E
5|$|Brussels-born Haitian athlete Nadine Faustin-Parker participated on Haiti's behalf at the Beijing Summer Olympics. She was 32 {{years old}} at the time, and was the only Haitian {{participating}} in the women's 100meters hurdles. Faustin-Parker previously competed in the same event at both the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney and at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens. Faustin-Parker participated in the fifth heat during the August 17 preliminary round, completing her event in 13.25seconds. She finished sixth out of eight athletes, ahead of Indonesia's Dedeh Erawati (13.49seconds) <b>and</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> Ukraine's Yevgeniya Snihur (13.06seconds). Faustin-Parker finished in 29th place out of the 40 participating athletes. She did not advance to further rounds.|$|E

5|$|Recruitment itself {{continued}} {{at a steady}} pace, and the Romanian General Staff created Biroul A. B ("T and B Bureau") to keep evidence of Austro-Hungarian abjurers, on <b>and</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> front. Its founding members were three Sub-lieutenants: Deleu, Vasile Osvadă, Leonte Silion. Biroul A. B. was assisted by a Consultative Commission of intellectuals and politicians of Transylvanian or Bukovinan backgrounds (Goga, Ion Nistor, Leonte Moldovan) and represented in Russia itself by a deputation of Transylvanian officers—Elie Bufnea, Victor Cădere.|$|E

5|$|The most {{controversial}} issue– {{the future of}} the city of Vilnius– was not explicitly addressed. When the agreement was signed, Vilnius was garrisoned by Lithuanian troops <b>and</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> Lithuanian lines. Yet this changed almost immediately when the staged Żeligowski's Mutiny began on October 8. Soon after the mutiny, Léon Bourgeois, President of the Council of the League of Nations, expressed strong disapproval, asserting that Żeligowski's actions were a violation of the engagements entered into with the Council of the League of Nations, and demanding the immediate Polish evacuation of the city.|$|E

5|$|Velázquez further emphasises the Infanta by his {{positioning}} {{and lighting}} of her maids of honour, whom he sets opposing one another: to left and right, before <b>and</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> Infanta. The maid {{to the left}} faces the light, her brightly lit profile and sleeve creating a diagonal. Her opposite number creates a broader but less defined reflection of her attention, making a diagonal space between them, in which their charge stands protected.|$|E
5|$|At the time, {{the system}} was not {{believed}} to have been subtropical. However, there were several post-season findings that confirmed that {{the system was}} indeed a subtropical storm. The first was the cloud pattern, in which it had deep convection around the center and was better organized with a well-defined center of circulation. In addition, the system had a warm core more typical of tropical cyclones as opposed to the cold core of extratropical cyclones. The warm-core nature also meant that there were no warm or cold fronts attached to the system, as temperatures did not change ahead of <b>and</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> system until the unrelated cold front passed the Azores. Satellite imagery suggested that the system was briefly a tropical storm as the warm core was found; however, the widespread wind field and the presence of an upper-level trough confirmed that it was merely subtropical.|$|E
5|$|From October 1810 Marshal Masséna's Army of Portugal {{had been}} tied {{down in an}} {{increasingly}} hopeless stand-off against Wellington's Allied forces, safely entrenched in <b>and</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> Lines of Torres Vedras. Acting on Napoleon's orders, in early 1811 Marshal Soult led a French expedition from Andalusia into Extremadura {{in a bid to}} draw Allied forces away from the Lines and ease Masséna's plight. Napoleon's information was outdated and Soult's intervention came too late; starving and understrength, Masséna's army was already withdrawing to Spain. Soult was able to capture the strategically important fortress at Badajoz on the border between Spain and Portugal from the Spanish, but was forced to return to Andalusia following Marshal Victor's defeat in March at the Battle of Barrosa. However, Soult left Badajoz strongly garrisoned. In April, following news of Masséna's complete withdrawal from Portugal, Wellington sent a powerful Anglo-Portuguese corps commanded by Sir William Beresford to retake the border town. The Allies drove most of the French from the surrounding area and began the Siege of Badajoz.|$|E

5|$|In September 1915, the Machine Gun Corps (MGC) {{was formed}} to provide heavy machine-gun teams after a {{proposal}} was made to the War Office {{for the formation of}} a single specialist machine-gun company for each infantry brigade—a goal to be achieved by withdrawing guns and gun teams from the battalions. Created in October 1915, the MGC consisted of infantry machine-gun companies, cavalry machine-gun squadrons and motor machine-gun batteries. In the trenches, the Corps' guns were deployed with an interlocking field of fire and proved to be a devastating defensive weapon against attacking infantry. They were also used in an indirect fire support role, in which they fired over the heads and from the flanks of the advancing infantry <b>and</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> German trenches to stop reinforcements and supplies from getting to the front.|$|E
5|$|In the 1990s, {{the club}} was located west of Michigan Avenue <b>and</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> 620 {{building}} which was home to many of Chicago's finest art dealers including Richard Gray and Richard L. Feigen & Co. The Arts club did not own the land upon which their famous Mies clubhouse was built; instead, the club held the land in a longterm leasehold. In 1990, the owner of 620 N. Michigan and the Arts Club land decided to sell. At first the Arts Club hoped {{to raise the money}} to purchase its land along with the 620 N. Michigan Avenue property in an effort spearheaded by Richard Gray, but it quickly became apparent that the club would lose a bidding war over this valuable land. A developer bought the property and demolished the entire block {{to make way for a}} movie complex and shopping center.|$|E
5|$|In the North, the {{commander}} of 1. Kavalleriedivision, Major General Kurt Feldt, faced the unenviable task of having to advance over the Enclosure Dike {{because of a lack}} of ships. This dam was blocked by the Kornwerderzand Position, which protected a major sluice complex regulating the water level of Lake IJssel, which had to be sufficiently high to allow many Fortress Holland inundations to be maintained. The main fortifications contained 47mm antitank-guns. Long channel piers projected in front of <b>and</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> sluices, on both the right and left; on these, pillboxes had been built which could place a heavy enfilading fire on the dam, which did not provide the slightest cover for any attacker. On 13 May the position was reinforced by a 20mm anti aircraft battery. It had been Feldt's intention to first destroy the position by a battery of siege mortars, but the train transporting it had been blocked on 10 May by a blown railway bridge at Winschoten. Several air attacks on 13 May had little effect; in the late afternoon five bicycle sections tried to approach the main bunker complex under cover of an artillery bombardment, but soon fled after being fired upon; the first was pinned down and could only retreat under cover of darkness, leaving behind some dead.|$|E
