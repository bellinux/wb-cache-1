5|$|Some of {{the oldest}} and most common {{objections}} to evolution dispute whether evolution can truly <b>account</b> <b>for</b> <b>all</b> the apparent complexity and order in the natural world. It is argued that evolution is too unlikely or otherwise lacking to account for various aspects of life, and therefore that an intelligence, such as God of the Abrahamic religions, must at the very least be appealed to for those specific features.|$|E
5|$|These alleles do not <b>account</b> <b>for</b> <b>all</b> dominantly {{inherited}} white spotting in horses. More KIT alleles {{are expected}} to be found with roles in white spotting. Most W alleles each occur within a specific breed or family and arise as spontaneous mutations. The KIT gene itself seems prone to mutation, and so new alleles of W could occur in virtually any breed.|$|E
5|$|After the war, the British Admiralty and the US Navy {{analysed}} {{the captured}} {{records of the}} Japanese navy to <b>account</b> <b>for</b> <b>all</b> of its vessels. Their reports do not list any Japanese submarine losses {{off the coast of}} the contiguous United States during the whole of the war. According to military records, the I-76 was destroyed off Buka Island in the western Pacific by USS Franks, USS Haggard and USS Johnston on 16 May 1944. Hubbard's crew however, who were very loyal to him, shared his conviction that they had engaged an enemy submarine. His second-in-command, Thomas Moulton, later asserted that the Navy had hushed up the incident, fearing that the presence of Japanese submarines so close to the Pacific coast might cause panic.|$|E

5|$|Historically, {{individuals}} with MS were advised against participation {{in physical activity}} due to worsening symptoms. However, {{under the direction of}} an expert, participation in physical activity can be safe and has been proven beneficial for persons with MS. Research has supported the rehabilitative role of physical activity in improving muscle power, mobility, mood, bowel health, general conditioning and quality of life. Depending on the person, activities may include resistance training, walking, swimming, yoga, tai chi, and others. Determining an appropriate and safe exercise program is challenging and must be carefully individualized to each person being sure to <b>account</b> <b>for</b> <b>all</b> contraindications and precautions.|$|E
5|$|Indium {{is created}} by the {{long-lasting}} (up to thousands of years) s-process (slow neutron capture) in low-to-medium-mass stars (which range in mass between 0.6 and 10 solar masses). When a silver-109 atom (the isotope that comprises approximately half of all silver in existence) catches a neutron, it undergoes a beta decay to become cadmium-110. Capturing further neutrons, it becomes cadmium-115, which decays to indium-115 by another beta decay. This explains why the radioactive isotope is more abundant than the stable one. The stable indium isotope, indium-113, {{is one of the}} p-nuclei, the origin of which is not fully understood; although indium-113 is known to be made directly in the s- and r-processes (rapid neutron capture), and also as the daughter of very long-lived cadmium-113, which has a half-life of about eight quadrillion years, this cannot <b>account</b> <b>for</b> <b>all</b> indium-113.|$|E
5|$|Therefore, {{the debate}} that {{immediately}} followed the publication of On the Origin of Species centered on {{the similarities and differences}} between humans and modern apes. Carolus Linnaeus had been criticised in the 18th century for grouping humans and apes together as primates in his ground breaking classification system. Richard Owen vigorously defended the classification suggested by Georges Cuvier and Johann Friedrich Blumenbach that placed humans in a separate order from any of the other mammals, which by the early 19th century had become the orthodox view. On the other hand, Thomas Henry Huxley sought to demonstrate a close anatomical relationship between humans and apes. In one famous incident, which became known as the Great Hippocampus Question, Huxley showed that Owen was mistaken in claiming that the brains of gorillas lacked a structure present in human brains. Huxley summarized his argument in his highly influential 1863 book Evidence as to Man's Place in Nature. Another viewpoint was advocated by Lyell and Alfred Russel Wallace. They agreed that humans shared a common ancestor with apes, but questioned whether any purely materialistic mechanism could <b>account</b> <b>for</b> <b>all</b> the differences between humans and apes, especially some aspects of the human mind.|$|E

5|$|The {{quality of}} Malvern water is {{attributable}} to its source. Malvern Hills are amongst the oldest and hardest rocks found in the United Kingdom, with their geology responsible {{for the quality of}} Malvern's spring water. The hills consist of Precambrian igneous and metamorphic rock, the oldest of which are about 670 million years old. The rocks are characterised by low porosity and high secondary permeability via fissures. Malvern water is rainwater and snow meltwater that percolates through fissures created by the pressures of tectonic movements about 300 million years ago when advancing sedimentary layers of Silurian shale and limestone were pushed into and under older Precambrian rock. When the fissures are saturated, a water table forms and the water emerges as springs around the fault lines between the strata. Depending on rainfall, the flow can vary from as little as 36 litres (8 gallons) per minute to over 350 litres (77 gallons) per minute. The water permeates through the rock which, because of its hardness, leaves little or no mineral traces in the water, {{while at the same time}} the very fine cracks act as a filter for other impurities. Rainfall on the Malvern Hills is thought to be sufficient to <b>account</b> <b>for</b> <b>all</b> the water that runs out of the springs, reflected for example in some spring flows six to eight weeks after heavy rainfall, and in reduced flows after a dry period.|$|E

25|$|When {{dealing with}} {{promotion}} a marketing manager must <b>account</b> <b>for</b> <b>all</b> the market complexities {{that are involved}} in a decision. As it is difficult to <b>account</b> <b>for</b> <b>all</b> aspects of the market, a manager should look to incorporate both experienced judgements from senior executives as well modifying these judgements in light of economically justifiable information gathering. An example of the application of Bayesian decision theory for promotional purposes could be the use of a test sample in order to assess the effectiveness of a promotion prior to a full scale rollout. By combining prior subjective data about the occurrence of possible events with experimental empirical evidence gained through a test market, the resultant data {{can be used to make}} decisions under risk.|$|E
