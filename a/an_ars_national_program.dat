40|$|This study aims to {{investigate}} the signaling mechanism involved in HS-induced modulation of adenosine-mediated vascular tone in {{the presence or absence}} of adenosine A 2 A receptor (<b>A</b> 2 <b>A</b> <b>AR).</b> We hypothesized that HS-induced enhanced vascular relaxation through <b>A</b> 2 <b>A</b> <b>AR</b> and epoxyeicosatrienoic acid (EETs) is dependent on peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) and ATP-sensitive potassium channels (K ATP channels) in <b>A</b> 2 <b>A</b> <b>AR</b> +/+ mice, while HS-induced vascular contraction to adenosine is dependent on soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) that degrades EETs in <b>A</b> 2 <b>A</b> <b>AR</b> −/− mice.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: In {{the last}} decade, {{increasing}} evidence suggests {{a key role}} of adenosine in Parkinson's disease (PD) and A 2 A adenosine receptors (<b>A</b> 2 <b>A</b> <b>ARs)</b> as <b>an</b> important pharmacological target in PD. An overexpression of <b>A</b> 2 <b>A</b> <b>ARs</b> {{has been found in}} putamen and in peripheral blood cells of PD patients. The primary aim {{of this study was to}} verify whether the alterations in <b>A</b> 2 <b>A</b> <b>ARs</b> in lymphocytes of PD subjects correlate with disease severity. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A consecutive sample of PD patients was enrolled. A clinical examination and a face-to-face interview were carried out. <b>A</b> 2 <b>A</b> <b>ARs</b> were investigated to verify the affinity and receptor density in lymphocyte membranes. The data were compared with those found in healthy controls. Moreover, the correlation between <b>A</b> 2 <b>A</b> <b>AR</b> density and affinity and clinical variables was evaluated in PD patients. RESULTS: In human lymphocyte membranes from PD patients, an increase in <b>A</b> 2 <b>A</b> <b>AR</b> density and <b>a</b> decrease in <b>A</b> 2 <b>A</b> <b>AR</b> affinity were found if compared with healthy subjects. A statistically significant correlation between the <b>A</b> 2 <b>A</b> <b>AR</b> density or affinity and specific clinical parameters as motor and cognitive impairment was detected. Patients with higher <b>A</b> 2 <b>A</b> <b>AR</b> density and lower affinity were more likely to exhibit motor complications. CONCLUSIONS: Parkinson's disease patients show an <b>A</b> 2 <b>A</b> <b>AR</b> upregulation in lymphocyte membranes if compared with healthy subjects. The correlation found between <b>A</b> 2 <b>A</b> <b>AR</b> density or affinity and clinical parameters highlights the central role of <b>A</b> 2 <b>A</b> <b>AR</b> modulation in the pharmacological treatment for PD and could suggest the putative role of <b>A</b> 2 <b>A</b> <b>AR</b> as <b>a</b> candidate biomarker of PD severity...|$|R

The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the modulation of A(2 <b>A)</b> <b>ARs</b> in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients after different pharmacological treatments and to investigate the effect of A(2 <b>A)</b> <b>AR</b> stimulation in <b>a</b> rat model of arthritis. We investigated A(2 <b>A)</b> <b>AR</b> density and functionality in RA progression by using a longitudinal study in RA patients before and after methotrexate (MTX), anti-TNFα agents or rituximab treatments. A(2 <b>A)</b> <b>ARs</b> were analyzed by saturation binding assays in lymphocytes from RA patients throughout the 24 -month study timeframe. In an adjuvant-induced arthritis model in rats we showed the efficacy of the A(2 <b>A)</b> <b>AR</b> agonist, CGS 21680 in comparison with standard therapies by means of paw volume assessment, radiographic and ultrasonographic imaging. Arthritic-associated pain was investigated in mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia tests. IL- 10 release following A(2 <b>A)</b> <b>AR</b> stimulation in lymphocytes from RA patients and in serum from arthritic rats was measured. In lymphocytes obtained from RA patients, the A(2 <b>A)</b> <b>AR</b> up-regulation was gradually reduced in function of the treatment time and the stimulation of these receptors mediated a significant increase of IL- 10 production. In the same cells, CGS 21680 did not affected cell viability and did not produced cytotoxic effects. The A(2 <b>A)</b> <b>AR</b> agonist CGS 21680 was highly effective, as suggested by the marked reduction of clinical signs, in rat adjuvant-induced arthritis and associated pain.

The activation profiles of the wt and both mutant α 2 <b>A</b> <b>ARs</b> as analysed {{by a series of}} α 2 AR agonists differed. d-Medetomidine and clonidine appeared most efficacious at the Ser 204 Ala α 2 <b>A</b> <b>AR,</b> whereas oxymetazoline was also partially active at the Ser 200 Ala α 2 <b>A</b> <b>AR.</b> Talipexole was silent at both mutant α 2 <b>A</b> <b>ARs.</b> The intrinsic activity of (−) -adrenaline was either absent or partial at the Ser 204 Ala and Ser 200 Ala α 2 <b>A</b> <b>AR,</b> respectively. This latter observation is related to its lower binding affinity for both mutant α 2 <b>A</b> <b>ARs.</b> Ligands characterized as antagonists at wt and Ser 200 Ala α 2 <b>A</b> <b>ARs</b> demonstrated either no intrinsic activity (i. e., RX 811059) or positive efficacy with a different rank order of maximal response at the Ser 204 Ala α 2 <b>A</b> <b>AR</b> (atipamezole=SKF 86466 =idazoxan>dexefaroxan) than Asp 79 Asn α 2 <b>A</b> <b>AR</b> (atipamezole>idazoxan≃SKF 86466 >dexefaroxan) and Thr 373 Lys α 2 <b>A</b> <b>AR</b> (SKF 86466 >atipamezole≃idazoxan>dexefaroxan).

Efforts are exerted {{in understanding the}} general mechanism and developing A(2 <b>A)</b> <b>AR</b> selectively binding agonists. Using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we have studied the interactions between A(2 <b>A)</b> <b>AR</b> and its agonist (adenosine), and analyzed the induced dynamic behaviors of the receptor. Key residues interacting with adenosine are identified: A 63 (2. 61), 166 (2. 64), V 84 (3. 32), L 85 (3. 33), T 88 (3. 36), F 168 (5. 29), M 177 (5. 38), L 249 (6. 51), H 250 (6. 52), and N 253 (6. 55) interacting with adenosine with affinities larger than 0. 5 kcal/mol. Moreover, no interaction between adenosine and L 167 (5. 28) is observed, which supports our previous findings that L 167 (5. 28) is an antagonist specific binding reside.

We investigated whether <b>A</b> 2 <b>A</b> <b>AR</b> activation improves and <b>A</b> 2 <b>A</b> <b>AR</b> deletion worsens outcomes in a murine model of C. difficile (strain VPI 10463) infection (CDI). Methods C 57 BL/ 6 mice were pretreated with an antibiotic cocktail prior to infection and then treated with vancomycin with or without an <b>A</b> 2 <b>A</b> <b>AR</b> agonist. <b>A</b> 2 <b>A</b> <b>AR</b> -/- and littermate wild-type (WT) mice were similarly infected, and IFNγ and TNFα were measured at peak of and recovery from infection. Results Infected, untreated mice rapidly lost weight, developed diarrhea, and had mortality rates of 50 - 60 %. Infected mice treated with vancomycin had less weight loss and diarrhea during antibiotic treatment but mortality increased to near 100 % after discontinuation of antibiotics. Infected mice treated with both vancomycin and an <b>A</b> 2 <b>A</b> <b>AR</b> agonist, either ATL 370 or ATL 1222, had minimal weight loss and better long-term survival than mice treated with vancomycin alone. <b>A</b> 2 <b>A</b> <b>AR</b> KO mice were more susceptible than WT mice to death from CDI.

40|$|PURPOSE. To {{test the}} {{putative}} role of A 3 adenosine receptors (ARs) in modulating intraocular pressure (IOP). METHODS. IOP was monitored {{for up to}} 32 minutes in A 3 -knockout (<b>A</b> 3 <b>AR</b> �/ �) and <b>A</b> 3 <b>AR</b> �/ � control mice by the servonull approach. The IOP responses to adenosine, <b>A</b> 3 <b>AR</b> agonists and <b>A</b> 3 <b>AR</b> antagonists were studied singly or in combination in both strains. RESULTS. IOP was significantly lower in <b>A</b> 3 <b>AR</b> �/ � mice (12. 9 � 0. 7 mm Hg) than in <b>A</b> 3 <b>AR</b> �/ � control animals (17. 4 � 0. 6 mm Hg). The nonselective AR agonist adenosine produced a much smaller increase in IOP (2. 2 � 0. 8 mm Hg) in the knockout than in <b>A</b> 3 <b>AR</b> �/ � control mice (14. 9 � 2. 4 mm Hg). The A 3 -selective agonist IB-MECA did not affect IOP in A 3 -knockout mice, but raised it in <b>A</b> 3 <b>AR</b> �/ � mice. The highly selective <b>A</b> 3 <b>AR</b> antagonist MRS 1191 did not affect IOP in <b>A</b> 3 <b>AR</b> �/ � mice, but lowered it in <b>A</b> 3 <b>AR</b> �/ � control mice. Preadministering MRS 1191 {{did not affect the}} small adenosine-triggered increase in IOP in <b>A</b> 3 <b>AR</b> �/ � mice, but markedly attenuated adenosine’s effects on IOP in <b>A</b> 3 <b>AR</b> �/ � control mice. MRS 1523, <b>an</b> <b>A</b> 3 <b>AR</b> antagonist less selective than MRS 1191 in rats, decreased IOP in both <b>A</b> 3 <b>AR</b> �/ � and <b>A</b> 3 <b>AR</b> �/ � animals.

Thus {{the present study was}} carried out to investigate the role of A(2 <b>A)</b> <b>AR</b> on airway reactivity, inflammation, NF-kappaB signaling, and nitrosative stress in A(2 <b>A)</b> <b>AR</b> knockout (KO) and wild-type (WT) mice using our murine model of asthma. Animals were sensitized intraperitoneally on days 1 and 6 with 200 microg of ragweed, followed by aerosolized challenges with 0. 5 % ragweed on days 11, 12, and 13, twice a day. On day 14, airway reactivity to methacholine was assessed as enhanced pause (Penh) using whole body plethysmography followed by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and lung collection for various analyses. Allergen challenge caused a significant decrease in expression of A(2 <b>A)</b> <b>AR</b> in A(2 <b>A)</b> WT sensitized mice, with A(2 <b>A)</b> <b>AR</b> expression being undetected in A(2 A) KO sensitized group leading to decreased lung cAMP levels in both groups. A(2 <b>A)</b> <b>AR</b> deletion/downregulation led to an increase in Penh to methacholine and influx of total cells, eosinophils, lymphocytes, and neutrophils in BAL with highest values in A(2 A) KO sensitized group. A(2 A) KO sensitized group further had increased NF-kappaB expression and nitrosative stress compared with WT sensitized group. These data suggest that A(2 <b>A)</b> <b>AR</b> deficiency leads to airway inflammation and airway hyperresponsiveness, possibly via involvement of nitrosative stress in this model of asthma.

Chronic administration of typical antipsychotics induced a significant upregulation of <b>A</b> 2 <b>A</b> <b>AR</b> binding sites. Since no effects on <b>A</b> 2 <b>A</b> <b>AR</b> were obtained following "in vitro" platelet treatment with a typical antipsychotic (haloperidol), we could exclude a direct effect of the drug on <b>A</b> 2 <b>A</b> <b>AR</b> at the peripheral level.

Similarly, in human SH-SY 5 Y cells, FTBI was able to prevent cell toxicity induced by MPP+ and METH, showing that this A(2 <b>A)</b> <b>AR</b> antagonist has <b>a</b> neuroprotective effect independently by the specific cell model. Altogether these results demonstrate that the A(2 <b>A)</b> <b>AR</b> blockade mediates cell protection against neurotoxicity induced by dopaminergic neurotoxins in dopamine containing cells, supporting the potential use of A(2 <b>A)</b> <b>AR</b> antagonists in dopaminergic degenerative diseases including Parkinson's disease...|$|R

40|$|Objective this {{research}} is to measure the effectiveness of <b>National</b> <b>Program</b> implementation for independent Urban Community Empowerment in Palu. Informants in {{this research}} are those directly involved with the <b>National</b> <b>Program</b> for independent Urban Community Empowerment in Palu. This research is a qualitative research. The methods used in collecting data are: in-depth interviews, direct observation, and Documentation. Based on the research results, the implementation of <b>National</b> <b>Program</b> for independent Urban Community Empowerment in Palu has been effective, in terms of process it is going according to the cycle stages of implementation of <b>National</b> <b>Program</b> for independent Urban Community Empowerment in Palu. The implementation is conducted through several stages, namely: Socialization, planning, implementation and evaluation stage. This process is already carried out quite well, judging {{from the number of}} activities that have been accomplished. There are several factors that affect the successful of implementation of <b>National</b> <b>Program</b> for independent Urban Community Empowerment in Palu namely public support, good communication between the consultant and Community Self-Reliance Agency at village level, and the executive attitude is manifested by having executive commitment in terms of togetherness to build social environment. The fundamental matter that needs to be improved is to develop the participation attitude of citizen to be involved more actively in the implementation of of <b>National</b> <b>Program</b> for independent Urban Community Empowerment...|$|R
40|$|In {{an effort}} to {{identify}} novel ligands possessing high affinity and selectivity for the <b>A</b> 2 B <b>AR</b> subtype, we further investigated the class of 3 -aryl[1, 2, 4]triazino[4, 3 -a]benzimidazol- 4 (10 H) -ones V, previously disclosed by us as selective <b>A</b> 1 <b>AR</b> antagonists. Preliminary assays {{on a number of}} triazinobenzimidazoles derived from our "in-house" collection revealed that all the derivatives selected showed significant affinity at <b>A</b> 2 B <b>AR,</b> no affinity at <b>A</b> 3 <b>AR,</b> and various degrees of selectivity toward A 1 and <b>A</b> 2 <b>A</b> <b>ARs.</b> Investigation of <b>a</b> new series featuring modified substituents at the 10 -position (4 ′-chlorophenyl or phenylethyl groups), and a chlorine atom at the 7 -position (X) of the triazinobenzimidazole nucleus, yielded highly potent and selective <b>A</b> 2 B <b>AR</b> antagonists. The presence of a pendant 3 -phenyl ring appears to hamper the interaction with <b>A</b> 2 <b>A</b> <b>AR,</b> conferring high <b>A</b> 2 B/A 2 <b>A</b> <b>AR</b> selectivity. Derivative 13 (X = Cl, R = C 6 H 5) is the most potent and selective compound, with an IC 50 of 3. 10 nM at <b>A</b> 2 B <b>AR</b> and no affinity at A 1, A 2 A, and <b>A</b> 3 <b>AR...</b>|$|R
