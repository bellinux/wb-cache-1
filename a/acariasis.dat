50|$|<b>Acariasis</b> is a {{term for}} a rash, caused by mites, {{sometimes}} with a papillae (pruritic dermatitis), and usually accompanied by severe itching sensations. An example of such an infection is scabies.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{candidate}} is Androlaelaps casalis. However, {{based on this}} mite's life style as a predator on other mite species (such as the previously-mentioned Dermanyssus gallinae), {{it is highly unlikely}} to be a cause of <b>acariasis.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Mange [...] is a {{class of}} skin {{diseases}} caused by parasitic mites. Since mites also infect plants, birds, and reptiles, the term [...] "mange", suggesting poor condition of the hairy coat due to the infection, is sometimes reserved only for pathological mite-infestation of nonhuman mammals. Thus, mange includes mite-associated skin disease in domestic animals (cats and dogs), in livestock (such as sheep scab), and in wild animals (for example, coyotes, cougars, and bears). Since mites belong to the arachnid subclass Acari (also called Acarina), another term for mite infestation is <b>acariasis.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{invertebrate}} mites are arthropods with a chitinous exoskeleton and jointed limbs. Within the Arthropoda, {{they belong}} in the subclass Acari (or Acarina) and species belonging to the Acari are informally known as acarines. Although both acarines and insects (class Insecta) are studied {{in the fields of}} veterinary and medical parasitology, acarines are separated from insects by structure, feeding, lifecycles, and disease relations. Both livestock and companion animals are susceptible to mite infestation. Humans also may become infested by contagion from these domestic animals (a zoonosis). The term livestock is used in this article for all those domesticated mammals and birds that people rear for production of food, hides, wool, and draught power. Infestation by mites usually causes skin diseases known as mange, scabies, scab, demodecosis, or in general as <b>acariasis.</b> The causation, economic impact, and control of these diseases in livestock are described in this article. Mites that cause disease in honey bees are described in Varroa destructor.|$|E

Kampmeier and Hinman (1934) had reported another two patients with diarrhea due to “intestinal acariasias” due to the same mite. Xing (1990) reported three cases of intestinal <b>acariasis</b> in China due to T. putrescentiae. Li and Wang (2000) studied cases of intestinal <b>acariasis</b> in Anhui Province, China from 1989 – 1996 and out of 3416 fecal sample examined, reported 94 with only mite infections and 131 cases together with other intestinal parasites. Li et al. (2003) reported 92 out of 1994 (4.61  %) stool samples positive for intestinal <b>acariasis</b> in China. Among others, T. putrescentiae caused the disease. Exceptionally an allergic intestinal <b>acariasis</b> syndrome {{has been described by}} Scala (1995). Zia et al. (2014) reported a case of intestinal <b>acariasis</b> in a 56  years old gentleman who was completely asymptomatic, but they did not identify the causative mite.

40|$|A {{cross-sectional}} {{study was conducted}} to determine the prevalence of major skin diseases of cattle in and around Hawassa from November 2011 to April 2012. Both clinical and laboratory examinations of samples from skin were carried out. Of the total 384 cattle examined, 66 (17. 19 %) were clinically infected with different skin diseases of various etiologic origin. The most commonly encountered skin diseases were dermatophytosis (8. 32 %), <b>acariasis</b> (3. 13 %), pediculosis (2. 60 %), lumpy skin disease (1. 62 %) and dermatophilosis (1. 56 %). No significant differences (P> 0. 05) were observed among age, breed and managemental groups in relation to the prevalence of dermatophilosis and lumpy skin disease whereas significantly (P 0. 05) was seen between sex and breed groups. In pediculosis cases, the major lice encountered were Bovicola, Haematopinus and Linognatus species. Statistically significant (p< 0. 05) difference was observed in two sex groups regarding to <b>acariasis</b> infestations.

30|$|It is {{suggested}} that separation of mites from stool samples, skin prick test and detection of total IgE and mite-specific IgE {{should be used in}} the diagnosis of acaroid mites. Intestinal <b>acariasis</b> may be easily misdiagnosed for allergic enteritis, chronic colitis, intestinal neurosis, amoebiasis, pelvic inflammation, or schistosomiasis. As a result, proper treatment might be thus delayed. Clinicians and technicians should always bear in mind the possibility of dust mite infestation while examining suspicious specimens. This is important in regions, like ours, where intestinal parasites are present so as to avoid unnecessary and ineffective treatment.|$|E
30|$|House dust mites {{represent}} {{a large group}} of subclass Acari, belonging to the suborder Acaridida of the order Acariformes. They can be detected in dust and vacuum samples from floors, furniture, mattresses, dry fruit, grain, flour, sugar, and bedding. These mites feed on sloughed human skin, fungi, spilled food and pollen (Li and Wang, 2000). Domestic mite species are usually found inside houses in warm and tropical regions. They are known for causing allergic disorders. However, little information is available about human <b>acariasis,</b> in which mites invade different tissues of human body as gastrointestinal, urinary and respiratory tracts (Cui 2014).|$|E

30|$|In {{the present}} study, {{intestinal}} <b>acariasis</b> {{was accompanied by}} infection with Blastocystis sp. which {{was found to be}} non-pathogenic. Members of the genus Blastocystis comprise several subtypes (genotypes) and it is suggested that its pathogenicity is related to specific subtypes and parasite burden (Sheehan et al. 1986; Stensvold et al. 2007; Al-kaissi and Al Magdi 2009; Coyle et al. 2011). There has been debate in the literature concerning the question of this organism pathogenicity; some studies suggest an association between the parasite and disease but others do not (Tan 2008). Most recent studies focused on correlating disease pathogenicity with subtypes irrespective of parasite density (Stensvold et al. 2009; Yakoob et al. 2010).|$|E
30|$|As what {{happened}} in the present study, mite eggs in stool samples, were sometimes erroneously identified as helminth eggs, leading to false treatment with extensive consequences (Werneck et al. 2007; Zia et al. 2014). In the present study, mite’s eggs were at first misdiagnosed as hookworm eggs which were followed by unsuccessful antihelminthic treatment. Realizing the identity of the causative mite was followed by successful treatment with ivermectin as this broad spectrum antiparasitic drug was suggested by Li (2000) to be the drug of choice for human intestinal <b>acariasis.</b> It is worth mentioning that in our study, no treatment for blastocystosis was given and the cure of the patient denoted that the infecting Blastocystis sp. was non-pathogenic.|$|E
30|$|The {{similarity}} of {{shape and size}} between the mite undeveloped eggs and helminth eggs led to false diagnosis of hookworm eggs by the routine laboratory technicians and thereby erroneous treatment by Mebendazol syrup (Bendax) one teaspoonful twice daily for 3  days failed. Hence, the stool samples were referred to the laboratory of the Medical Parasitology Departments for more accurate identification; where the mites and their eggs were recognized and thereafter, <b>acariasis</b> was treated by ivermectin (Iverzine 6  mg-UNIPHARMA-Cairo, Egypt). He received single dose; 200  µg/kg body weight and one teaspoonful of castor oil per day and repeated every 10  days for three consecutive doses after which stool examination revealed no eggs and fragmented parts of adults. The patient’ symptoms subsided, started to gain weight and his stools were parasite free. Follow up of patient’s symptoms and stool examination revealed no recurrence.|$|E
40|$|Bee <b>acariasis,</b> {{caused by}} the mite Varroa jacobsoni Oudemans [26], {{represents}} a serious problem for apiculture.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to pilot a simpler and more {{effective}} method for identifying dust mites in sputum. Dust mites and their allergens have been implicated in respiratory diseases, including pulmonary <b>acariasis,</b> and several studies have identified mites in sputum. Further research is dependent on the development of a faster and simpler diagnostic test. We have demonstrated that dust mites artificially introduced into sputa, could be identified after the sputa were liquefied with bleach, when the liquid sample was observed under the microscope. Liquefaction times for serous, mucous, purulent and hemoptoic sputa varied from 10 to 30 min (mean 17. 5). The test had a sensitivity of 80 % (95 % CI 68. 2 – 88. 2 %) as 46 / 60 mites were identified.

40|$|<b>Acariasis</b> {{in animals}} {{is caused by}} a variety of mites (class Arachnida, {{subclass}} Acari). Due to the great number and ecological diversity of these organisms, as well as the lack of fossil records, the higher classification of these organisms is evolving, and more than one taxonomic scheme is in use. The zoonotic species include the following mites. Family Sarcoptidae Sarcoptes scabiei causes sarcoptic mange (scabies) in humans and more than 100 other species of other mammals and marsupials. There are several subtypes of this organism including S. scabiei var hominis, S. scabiei var. canis, S. scabiei var suis, S. scabiei var. equi, S. scabiei var bovis and S. scabiei var ovis. Some of these variants are host specific, some are not, and some have partial host specificity. The host-specific variants can cause temporary dermatitis in other hosts, but do not reproduce except on their preferred host. S. scabiei var hominis causes human scabies. Humans can also be infested by the scabies mites of dogs, pigs, cattle, goats, sheep, horses, ferrets, water buffalo, llamas, camels and some wild or zoo animals (e. g. the Australian wombat).

40|$|The histologic {{features}} of abnormal spectacles in 60 snakes from the 5 families of Boidae, Colubridae, Elapidae, Pythonidae, and Viperidae {{are described in}} a retrospective study conducted on specimens submitted to a private diagnostic service {{during a period of}} 15 years. Fifty-two snakes had inflammatory reactions in the spectacle. The stroma and outer epithelium of the spectacle were the layers most often involved in inflammatory disease. Lesions of the outer epithelium included edema, hyperkeratosis, and granulocyte infiltration occasionally with bacterial colonies and fungal elements. The stroma had infectious agents and inflam-matory reactions in vessels and between the collagen fibrils. The inner epithelium had varying degrees of hyperplasia and hypertrophy, but no infectious agents were seen. Infectious agents in these cases included mites, bacterial disease, fungal disease, or a combination of bacterial and fungal disease. Special stains identified the bacteria most commonly involved to be Gram-positive cocci. Thirteen snakes had dysecdysis of the spectacle. Of these, 5 displayed a concurrent inflammatory reaction of the spectacle, while the remaining 8 snakes had extra keratin layers on a spectacle with an otherwise normal appearance. These keratin layers were attached to serocellular crusts located on the inner surface of the periocular scales. The cause for dysker-atotic lesions of the spectacle was not always apparent, and concurrent <b>acariasis,</b> other forms of dermatitis, trauma, suboptimal husbandry, and visceral disease were considered possible contributing factors.

40|$|Dermanyssus gallinae (De Geer 1778; the red poultry mite {{or chicken}} mite; fig. 1) {{is the most}} common mite {{associated}} with feral pigeons (Columba livia). 1, 2 It is a nocturnal blood-sucking ectoparasite and stays on the bird to feed only. During the daytime, it is usually foundin close proximity to the nest (1). In the absence of its usual host, the red mite can also infest mammals and cause a non-specific dermatitis associated with intense itching in humans. Infestations are often misdiagnosed and inevitably lead to failures in treatment. Figure 1. Figure 1. Open in figure viewerDownload Powerpoint slide D. gallinae, female: an egg is visible within the abdomen. This report outlines the importance of the red mite associated disease in humans through the report of seven episodes of pseudoscabies caused by D. gallinae in Italian cities, from 2001 to 2007. All cases shared common features. Particularly, all the patients lived and/or worked in urban environments but had no contact with animals or poultry farms. In five of the cases, people were infested in their homes and in the remaining two cases at work. Abandoned pigeon nests were always found in close proximity to the rooms infested by the mites. Medical consultations failed to solve the human dermatitis, which returned when symptomatic treatment with antihistamines and corticosteroids stopped. Indeed, diagnoses were consistently generic, and even when skin lesions were attributed to <b>acariasis,</b> the possibility of an animal to human cross-infection was not considered. Our experience confirms that most dermatologists have difficulty identifying ectoparasitoses, such as those that arise within new or atypical conditions. This is probably the main reason why similar cases of gamasidosis are more difficult to recognize than classical ones occurring in rural areas. The cases reported here give new insights into the sanitary role of D. gallinae infestation for humans living in urban areas. They also underline the need for dermatologists to be more aware of this threat and more familiar with its presentation and management. The meaning of these mites in public health also stems from their role as potential allergens and reservoirs of pathogens. 1, 3 – 5 Red mite is able to survive for long periods without a blood meal. This can lead to recurrent episodes of pruritic dermatitis (as has been observed in occasionaly-used buildings i. e. holiday homes). Therefore, the long-lasting absence of the human host does not guarantee the elimination of the mite from the environment, and a period of more than 9 months is necessary. 6 In conclusion, the differential diagnosis of non-specific dermatitis in people living in urban settings should always include pseudoscabies caused by D. gallinae, particularly when the lesions develop in spring and the patients live and/or work on the upper floors of buildings. When the clinical presentation is non-specific and the arthropod cannot be found in cutaneous lesions, the environmental anamnesis could be a useful tool to diagnose successfully pseudoscabies. Dermatologists should provide the patients with complete instructions on how to inspect the living quarters and identify the mite (i. e. shape, colour, size of the mite; nocturnal feeding habits; typical hiding places), if suspicious elements emerge. The successful identification of the mite is absolutely fundamental to manage the clinical episodes correctly: specimens should be collected from the environment and sent to the laboratory of entomology for further identification. The involvement of a veterinary parasitologist can also be useful for a rapid diagnosis. Nowadays, the increase of synanthropic animals carries a high risk of zoonotic diseases and requires the collaboration of physicians and veterinarians as well as public health care officials...|$|E
40|$|The {{pathological}} and parasitological {{findings from}} 100 free-ranging chacma baboons are described. One {{of the most}} striking discoveries was a heretofore unknown coccidian parasite, Isospora papionis, and even more important than its presence in the small intestine was its occurrence in skeletal muscles. Serological and histopathological evidence of toxoplasmosis was found in several animals. Other previously unknown parasites encountered included two mites- Rhinophaga elongata, an unusually long mite that produced small granulomas in the nasal mucosae, and Pneumonyssus vocalis, a mite found in the laryngeal ventricles. A new species of filarid, Tetrapetalonema papionis was found in the subcutis and intermuscular fascia. New records for the chacma baboon of known parasites were R. papionis, a mite found only in the maxillary recess, where it stimulated a polyplike growth, and, in the skeletal muscles, cysticerci of Taenia crocutae, a tapeworm of hyenas (Crocuta crocuta and Hyaena brunnea). Apart from the pathological changes associated with the above parasites, another important finding was numerous cases of "capture myopathy", a syndrome that resembles Meyer-Betz disease of man. One of the most severe diseases encountered was pulmonary <b>acariasis</b> (P. mossambicensis), which at times caused large foci of supportive pneumonia and diffuse pleuritis. The mite pigment was also found in draining lymph nodes. The most serious diseases of the liver were cytomegaly, which was similar to that produced by mycotoxins in other animal species, multiple granulomatous foci caused by Hepatocystis simiae and microgranulomas caused by ova of Schistosoma mattheei. Adult schistosomes were also found in the mesenteric vessels. The most important lesion in the central nervous system was an axonal hamartoma, which was found in two cases and involved {{a large portion of the}} brain stem. Also of note were a meningioma in the falx cerebelli, a few examples of non-suppurativc encephalitis and several cases in which neurons in the medulla oblongata had been replaced by a globular eosinophilic mass. Other tumours found were a fibroma in the subcutis of the face and a basal cell carcinoma in the skin on the back. Both were of local importance only. Developmental anomalies included an accessory spleen, ectopic pancreatic tissue in the duodenum, thymic tissue embedded in the thyroid and parathyroid and microcysts in the thymus, parathyroid and adenohypophysis. Arteriosclerosis of limited severity was found in the aorta and coronary and renal arteries of many of the older baboons (males and females). Another vascular change related to previous pregnancy was sclerosis of the ovarian and uterine vessels. Degenerative changes were found in the central arteries of germinal follicles in various lymph nodes and the spleen. Other noteworthy findings included the presence of spargana in the skeletal muscles; ranula formation of the ducts of the glands of Ebner; para-ovarian crystals; large intranuclear inclusions in the submandibular salivary gland compatible with those produced by cytomegalovirus and intranuclear inclusions in the epididymis. Various gastro-intestinal parasites were found and their corresponding lesions are described. Selected bacterial studies for shigellae and salmonellae were negative, as were intradermal tests for tuberculosis and serological tests for leptospirosis and brucellosis. The brain, heart, spleen, liver, lungs and kidneys were mass measured and were compared to the body mass. In all age groups the heart varied the least when expressed as percent body mass. The brain was the most variable in this regard but changed the least in total mass. The articles have been scanned in colour with a HP Scanjet 5590; 300 dpi.
