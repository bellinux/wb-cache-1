5|$|Fatalist Development AB, doing {{business}} as <b>Avalanche</b> Studios, is {{a video game}} developer based in Stockholm, Sweden. It was founded in March 2003 by Christofer Sundberg and Linus Blomberg. <b>Avalanche</b> Studios focuses on developing open world projects and bases them on the <b>Avalanche</b> Engine. Formed {{after the collapse of}} Rock Solid Games, the studio has expanded from six members to 250 staff members.|$|E
5|$|Following Just Cause, <b>Avalanche</b> {{began to}} provide {{technical}} assistance to The Hunter. Originally developed and published by Emote Games, the franchise was acquired by <b>Avalanche</b> on 18 February 2010. As The Hunter is an online-activated games, <b>Avalanche</b> established a subsidiary studio called Expansive Worlds on 24 March 2010 to provide support to the continuous development of The Hunter. The new studio will also work on new online games.|$|E
5|$|On 14 February 2013, a blurry {{screenshot}} of {{the game}} was released by <b>Avalanche</b> Studios founder and CEO Christofer Sundberg. The game was announced at Electronic Entertainment Expo 2013 on 10 June at Sony's press conference, with a scheduled 2014 release for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360, and Xbox One. Although Sundberg said during the expo that Miller and Barlog's project was not the Mad Max game announced by <b>Avalanche,</b> he later said that Barlog had worked on a Mad Max game at <b>Avalanche.</b> Despite the unclear relationship between the projects, according to the game's design director, Miller had collaborated with <b>Avalanche</b> during the game's pre-production in mid-2011. Despite having Miller to offer input, Warner Bros. inclined to give lots of creative freedom to <b>Avalanche.</b> Full production {{of the game}} began before May 2012.|$|E

5|$|On June 21, 1995, the Quebec Nordiques {{transferred}} to Denver {{and became the}} Colorado <b>Avalanche.</b> Miller joined the team in Colorado, and split the 1995–96 season between Colorado and Cornwall. In 62 games with Cornwall, he had four goals and 23 assists, while going scorless in five games with the <b>Avalanche.</b> Because he didn't appear in enough games, Miller was not considered {{as part of the}} Stanley Cup winning <b>Avalanche</b> team.|$|E
5|$|On May 9, 2008, the Colorado <b>Avalanche</b> Organization {{announced}} that Joel Quenneville {{would not return}} to coach the team next season. Two weeks later, Tony Granato was named {{head coach of the}} <b>Avalanche</b> for the second time.|$|E
5|$|After {{a disappointing}} 2012–13 season which saw the Colorado <b>Avalanche</b> finish 15th in the Western Conference and 29th {{overall in the}} League, it was {{announced}} on April 28, 2013, that Head Coach Joe Sacco had been relieved of his duties. On May 10, {{it was announced that}} former long-time <b>Avalanche</b> captain and Hockey Hall of Famer Joe Sakic is set to take on an expanded role in <b>Avalanche</b> management, being named executive vice president of hockey operations, overseeing all matters involving hockey personnel. It was also announced that Josh Kroenke, son of owner Stan Kroenke, is now president of the <b>Avalanche,</b> succeeding Pierre Lacroix. On May 23, Patrick Roy returned to the <b>Avalanche</b> as head coach and vice president of hockey operations. Although Sherman retained his role as general manager, he was largely reduced to an advisory role. Roy and Sakic now share most of the duties held by a general manager on most other NHL teams, though Sakic has the final say on hockey matters.|$|E

5|$|Before Crisis {{opens with}} the trainee Turks {{on a mission}} {{in the city of}} Midgar to {{investigate}} <b>AVALANCHE</b> activities. With help from Reno, <b>AVALANCHE</b> retreat. However, the attack proves to be a diversion for a greater strike at the town of Junon, where President Shinra is set to give a speech. President Shinra is shot, but survives, and calls in Sephiroth. However, it transpires that even the attack on the President was a diversion, and AVALANCHE's real target was a weapon called the Mako Cannon, which they planned to fire at Midgar, destroying the city. Elfé and Sephiroth do battle at the cannon, but the fight ends inconclusively, and <b>AVALANCHE</b> withdraw. <b>AVALANCHE</b> next target Rayleigh a professor carrying data on the SOLDIER members and their creation. The Turks are sent to protect Rayleigh, accompanied by several Shinra guards, including Cloud. Fuhito, a scientist working for <b>AVALANCHE,</b> is able to corrupt Rayleigh's data when the Turks disobey orders and save Rayleigh instead of protecting the information. Using the SOLDIER data, Fuhito develops an elite unit known as the Ravens, using them to capture two SOLDIERs, Essai and Sebastian. The Turks succeed in rescuing the pair, and are then sent to destroy <b>AVALANCHE,</b> accompanied by Zack. Essai and Sebastian, however, are captured once again, and turned into Ravens. Even though Zack is able to bring them back to their senses, he is unable to save them.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Snow <b>avalanches</b> {{are able}} to {{transport}} considerable amounts of debris down into the lowlands and are a significant sedimentary transport process. However, snow <b>avalanches</b> have until recently not been regarded as an important sediment transfer dynamic in Iceland. Although, this debris transport capacity, and the resulting geomorphological evidences {{should be used in}} combination with other methods to evaluate the potential impact of snow <b>avalanches</b> in inhabited zones. In NW-, N- and E- Iceland, studies on the geomorphological impact of ground snow <b>avalanches</b> have been carried out since 1995. These areas count several inhabited areas for which snow <b>avalanches</b> have been recognized as a major hazard. So far, only historical records were considered to evaluate the magnitude and frequency of snow <b>avalanches.</b> As most of the historical data are younger than 100 years, {{there is a possibility that}} records do not cover the return-period of extreme snow <b>avalanches.</b> The geomorphological data compensate this flaw, with investigations outside present-day inhabited areas, as town planning has altered the deposit zone surface of former long distance snow <b>avalanches.</b> Obtained data are then transferred to the inhabited areas by topographic modeling, underlining the location of potentially most endangered zones in a proactive manner...|$|R

5|$|Following the 2004–05 NHL lockout, the <b>Avalanche</b> {{were forced}} to lose many of their key players {{in order to stay}} below the salary cap. Even with the loss of {{teammates}} Peter Forsberg and Adam Foote, Sakic still helped the <b>Avalanche</b> get into the playoffs, where they eventually lost to the Anaheim Ducks in the conference semi-finals. In June 2006, Sakic signed a one-year, $5.75 million deal to keep him with the <b>Avalanche</b> for the 2006–07 season. Upon the retirement of Steve Yzerman a month later, on July 3, 2006, Sakic became the League leader for most NHL career points scored among active players.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{departure}} of Roy, the <b>Avalanche</b> hired Jared Bednar from the Calder Cup champions, the Lake Erie Monsters of the American Hockey League, as head coach. On December 10, 2016, the <b>Avalanche</b> allowed 10 goals in a 10–1 loss to the Canadiens. The <b>Avalanche</b> closed out their season {{with a record of}} 22–56–4, resulting in a franchise-low 48 points and a last-place finish in the league; this was the worst record of any team in the NHL since the Atlanta Thrashers finished with a record of 14–61–7 and 39 points in the 1999–2000 season (which was their first season in the league).|$|E

Case study, Padinile Frumoase (Piatra Craiului Mountains, Romania). In this paper we aim to present in detail the situations generated by meteorological and morphological parameters, which determined the generation of <b>avalanches</b> of different intensities, on five <b>avalanches</b> corridors in the winter 2007 - 2008. These are situated in the area named Padinile Frumoase, in the north-eastern part of the Piatra Craiului Mountains, which are situated in {{the central part of}} Romania and which belong to the Meridional Carpathians. The relief is represented by a calcareous- conglomeratic ridge, in the high part, the peak reaches over 2000 m altitude. Local conditions determine the forming of <b>avalanches,</b> which are oriented on well defined corridors, along the temporary hydrographic network. By studying the evolution of meteorological parameters and their overlapping with local morphological parameters, the existence of some favourable conditions for the apparition of <b>avalanches</b> were detected. There were noticed both active corridors with traces of <b>avalanches,</b> and inactive corridors on which it was not noticed the manifestation of these phenomena.

With a 9–5 victory over the St. Louis Blues on December 9, 2007, the <b>Avalanche</b> earned their 1,000th franchise victory. On February 25, 2008, unrestricted free agent Peter Forsberg signed with the <b>Avalanche</b> {{for the remainder of}} the 2007–08 season. A day later, at the trade deadline, they re-acquired popular defenseman Adam Foote from the Columbus Blue Jackets as well as Ruslan Salei from the Florida Panthers.

Roy won another title with the <b>Avalanche</b> in 2001 along with a third Conn Smythe Trophy before retiring in 2003 with more wins than any NHL goaltender. The Canadiens, meanwhile, fell into an extended stretch of mediocrity, missing the playoffs in four of their next ten seasons and failing to advance past {{the second round of}} the playoffs until 2010.

25|$|Although {{primarily}} {{composed of}} flowing snow and air, large <b>avalanches</b> {{have the capability}} to entrain ice, rocks, trees, and other surficial material. However, they are distinct from mudslides which have greater fluidity, rock slides which are often ice free, and serac collapses during an icefall. <b>Avalanches</b> are not rare or random events and are endemic to any mountain range that accumulates a standing snowpack. <b>Avalanches</b> are most common during winter or spring but glacier movements may cause ice and snow <b>avalanches</b> at any time of year.
