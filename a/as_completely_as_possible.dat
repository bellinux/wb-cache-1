25|$|We must {{single out}} the {{children}} who are endowed with high potentialities, and develop them <b>as</b> <b>completely</b> <b>as</b> <b>possible.</b> And in this manner give to the nation a non-hereditary aristocracy. Such children may be found in all classes of society, although distinguished men appear more frequently in distinguished families than in others. The descendants of the founders of American civilization may still possess the ancestral qualities. These qualities are generally hidden under the cloak of degeneration. But this degeneration is often superficial. It comes chiefly from education, idleness, lack of responsibility and moral discipline. The sons of very rich men, like those of criminals, should be removed while still infants from their natural surroundings. Thus separated from their family, they could manifest their hereditary strength. In the aristocratic families of Europe there are also individuals of great vitality. The issue of the Crusaders is by no means extinct. The laws of genetics indicate the probability that the legendary audacity and love of adventure can appear again in the lineage of the feudal lords. It is possible also that the offspring of the great criminals who had imagination, courage, and judgment, of the heroes of the French or Russian Revolutions, of the high-handed business men who live among us, might be excellent building stones for an enterprising minority. As we know, criminality is not hereditary if not united with feeble-mindedness or other mental or cerebral defects. High potentialities are rarely encountered in the sons of honest, intelligent, hard-working men who have had ill luck in their careers, who have failed in business or have muddled along all their lives in inferior positions. Or among peasants living on the same spot for centuries. However, from such people sometimes spring artists, poets, adventurers, saints. A brilliantly gifted and well-known New York family came from peasants who cultivated their farm in the south of France from the time of Charlemagne to that of Napoleon.|$|E

5000|$|The {{teachings of}} the Nandinatha Sampradaya, value highly the {{necessity}} of a living preceptor to carry the unseen, energetic essence of these teaching to devotees. The Nandinatha Sampradaya is a Siddha Yoga Tradition ("Siddha" [...] means literally attainment), and its Gurus have often demonstrated great mystical abilities and wisdom. It is said that these teachers have realized their oneness with the Supreme God (they call [...] "Shiva") and have merged <b>as</b> <b>completely</b> <b>as</b> humanly <b>possible</b> with this Divine source of all. With such realization, it is said, comes limitless bliss and direct command of every power in the universe. There are many accounts of miraculous powers demonstrated by the Teachers of this lineage. It is taught that the aid of such a highly realized Siddha can greatly quicken spiritual practice. Some even say that without the diksha (initiation) of such teachers, the human instincts will always fail to lead to this highest Realization. The Nandinatha Sampradaya is maintained today by several groups stemming from MahaRishi Nandinatha's eight disciples. The Kailasa Parampara is based out of Kauai, Hawaii, U.S.A. where a monastery and mandir (temple) is maintained. The Sannyasis (Monks) of this order continue to spread the teachings of this Sampradaya through the Himalayan Academy and the [...] "Hinduism Today" [...] magazine. Satguru Bodhinatha Veylanswami is the living preceptor or the 163rd Guru Mahasannidhanam of the Kailasa Parampara of the Nandinatha Sampradaya.|$|R
40|$|In {{connection}} with the conduction of the long-duration Voyager missions to the outer planets and the sophisticated propulsion systems required, {{it was necessary to}} carry out an investigation to avoid exhaust plume impingement problems. The rarefied gas dynamics literature indicates that, for most engineering surfaces, the assumption of diffuse reemission and complete thermal accommodation is warranted in the free molecular flow regime. This assumption was applied to an analysis of a spacecraft plume impingement problem in the near-free molecular flow regime and yielded results to within a few percent of flight data. The importance of a correct treatment of the surface temperature was also demonstrated. Specular reflection, on the other hand, was shown to yield results which may be unconservative by a factor of 2 or 3. It is pointed out {{that one of the most}} difficult portions of an exhaust plume impingement analysis is the simulation of the impinged hardware.

40|$|FAYE, The Frame AnalYsis Executable, is a Java based {{implementation}} of the Frame/Stream/Stop model for analyzing data. Unlike traditional Event based analysis models, the Frame/Stream/Stop model has no preference as to which part of any data is to be analyzed, and an Event get as equal treatment as {{a change in the}} high voltage. This model means that FAYE is a suitable analysis framework for many different type of data analysis, such as detector trends or as a visualization core. During the design of FAYE the emphasis has been on clearly delineating each of the executable's responsibilities and on keeping their implementations <b>as</b> <b>completely</b> independent <b>as</b> <b>possible.</b> This leads to the large part of FAYE being a generic core which is experiment independent, and smaller section that customizes this core to an experiments own data structures. This customization can even be done in C++, using JNI, while the executable's control remains in Java. This paper reviews the Frame/Stream/Stop model and then looks at how FAYE has approached its implementation, with an emphasis on which responsibilities are handled by the generic core, and which parts an experiment must provide as part of the customization portion of the executable.
