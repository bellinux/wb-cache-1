She began leading an early-morning Bible class {{at a local}} cafeteria and became active in Life Christian Center, a charismatic church in Fenton. Within a few years, Meyer was the church's associate pastor. The church {{became one of the}} leading charismatic churches in the area, largely because of her popularity as a Bible teacher. She also began airing a daily 15-minute radio broadcast on a St. Louis radio station.|$|E
500|$|A January 3 vigil was {{scheduled}} for Trafalgar Square in London; an organizer {{was quoted as saying}} that [...] " [...] death was a political death. When <b>a</b> <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> community is brutalised at the hands of oppression we must all fight back". Those who spoke at the event included politician Sarah Brown and novelist and poet Roz Kaveney. Marches were carried out in honor of Alcorn in both Northwest, Washington, D.C., and Queen Street, Auckland, on January 10. The same day, a candlelight vigil was held in New York City's Columbus Circle. A memorial protest against conversion therapy and in memory of Alcorn took place in Lynchburg, Virginia, on January 24, 2015.|$|E
500|$|Apart from Enesco, he was {{the most}} {{cultivated}} violinist I have ever known but while Enesco was a force of nature, Szigeti, slender, small, anxious, was a beautifully fashioned piece of porcelain, a priceless Sèvres vase. Curiously for a Hungarian, from whom one expects wild, energetic, spontaneous qualities, Szigeti travelled even farther up a one-way road of deliberate intellectualism. A young accompanist who worked with Szigeti told me that two hours concentration wouldn't get them beyond the first three bars of a sonata--so much analysis and ratiocination went into his practice ... A similar persnicketiness marked his adjudication. Shortly before he died in 1973, he was <b>a</b> <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> jury at the City of London Carl Flesch Concours ... I was struck not only by the sharpness of his intellect but also by what seemed to me the perversity of his opinions. Some particular aspect of a competitor's playing would hold his attention, and he would take violent issue with it, to the exclusion of everything else. For him a violinist was made or broken, a prize awarded or withheld, on details that to me scarcely mattered.|$|E

2500|$|The racism {{allegation}} caused considerable backlash {{from within}} India. Many, including BCCI chairman Sharad Pawar have equated {{it to an}} attack on the country's people itself, based on the apparent misunderstanding that lead to such an escalation. Pawar told Cricinfo [...] "allegations of racism against <b>a</b> <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> cricket team is not acceptable... We fight against racism. Our country supported anti-racism movements in South Africa." [...] Kumble considered the allegation one that should not have been made lightly as the team is meant to be an ambassador for the country and an allegation of racism becomes an issue of honour.|$|E

As a teacher, he wished to no longer {{be recognized as a}} member of the famous Wittgenstein family. In response, his brother Paul wrote: [...] "It is out of the question, really completely out of the question, that anybody bearing our name and whose elegant and gentle upbringing can be seen a thousand paces off, would not be identified as <b>a</b> <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> family...
