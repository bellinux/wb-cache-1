40|$|TypescriptIncludes bibliographical referencesM. S. University of Missouri 1911 In {{making a}} {{chemical}} {{study of the}} composition of domestic animals of different ages and on different planes of nutrition, {{it is important to}} make a study of the composition <b>of</b> their <b>ash</b> and <b>of</b> the <b>ash</b> <b>of</b> similar animals at birth. This paper will deal with the composition <b>of</b> the <b>ash</b> <b>of</b> the new born calf. A review of the work on ash analysis fails to show that any work has been done on the composition <b>of</b> the <b>ash</b> <b>of</b> the new born calf. A number of analyses have been made of the composition <b>of</b> the <b>ash</b> <b>of</b> different parts and organs of various animals and a few analyses have been made of the composition <b>of</b> the <b>ash</b> <b>of</b> entire animals at birth. In order that a comparison <b>of</b> the <b>ash</b> <b>of</b> the different parts of an animal, and of the composition <b>of</b> the <b>ash</b> <b>of</b> different animals may be made, some of the results secured by other chemists are here presented.

40|$|<b>Ash</b> <b>of</b> silver {{is used in}} {{traditional}} systems of medicine for various neurological conditions like insomnias, neuralgias, anxiety disorders, and convulsions. The present {{study was conducted to}} evaluate the sedative-hypnotic activity <b>of</b> <b>ash</b> <b>of</b> silver in comparison to pentobarbitone (standard drug) in albino mice. The mice were divided into four groups as follows: Group 1 (control) : Gum acacia [GA; 1 % per os (p. o.) ], group 2 (standard) : Pentobarbitone [50  mg/kg intraperitoneal (i. p.) ], group 3 (test) : <b>Ash</b> <b>of</b> silver (50  mg/kg p. o.), and group 4 : <b>Ash</b> <b>of</b> silver (50  mg/kg p. o.) given 30  min prior to administration of pentobarbitone (50  mg/kg i. p.). Time of onset, recovery, and total duration of loss of righting reflex were studied. <b>Ash</b> <b>of</b> silver (test) produced significant sedation (P< 0. 01) compared to control (GA 1 %), but the effect was significantly less compared to that of standard pentobarbitone at the doses used. Also, significant potentiation (P< 0. 001) of the sedative-hypnotic effect of pentobarbitone was observed with the test drug...|$|R

5|$|Many {{organochlorine}} compounds {{have been}} isolated from natural sources ranging from bacteria to humans. Chlorinated organic compounds {{are found in}} nearly every class of biomolecules including alkaloids, terpenes, amino acids, flavonoids, steroids, and fatty acids.

In addition, a variety of simple chlorinated hydrocarbons including dichloromethane, chloroform, and carbon tetrachloride have been isolated from marine algae. A majority of the chloromethane in the environment is produced naturally by biological decomposition, forest fires, and volcanoes.|$|E

Sihanouk {{was shocked to see}} the use of forced labour and population displacement carried out by the Khmer Rouge government, known as the Angkar. Following the tour, Sihanouk decided to resign as the Head of State. The Angkar initially rejected his resignation request, though they subsequently accepted it in mid-April 1976, retroactively backdating it to 2April 1976.|$|E

5|$|By {{the reign}} of ArchelausI in the 5th century BC, the ancient Macedonian elite was {{importing}} customs and artistic traditions from other regions of Greece while retaining more archaic, perhaps Homeric, funerary rites connected with the symposium that were typified by items such as the decorative metal kraters that held the <b>ashes</b> <b>of</b> deceased Macedonian nobility in their tombs. Among these is the large bronze Derveni Krater from a 4th-centuryBC tomb of Thessaloniki, decorated with scenes of the Greek god Dionysus and his entourage and belonging to an aristocrat who had had a military career. Macedonian metalwork usually followed Athenian styles of vase shapes from the 6thcenturyBC onward, with drinking vessels, jewellery, containers, crowns, diadems, and coins among the many metal objects found in Macedonian tombs.|$|E
