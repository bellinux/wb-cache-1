5|$|Perfect Dark Zero is a first-person shooter where players {{control the}} player {{character}} mostly from a first-person perspective. The combat features mechanics {{such as an}} evasive dodge roll and a cover {{system in which the}} gameplay switches to a third-person perspective, allowing the player to strategically aim without taking damage and be more aware of the surroundings. Players cannot jump but have the ability to automatically climb obstacles <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> reasonably reach them. It is also possible to climb ladders. By doing so, the camera shifts into a third-person perspective. The player has a certain amount of health which decreases when attacked by enemies. The health can recharge a bit if the player steps out of the line of fire for a few seconds, but it may not necessarily refill completely depending on how much damage the player took.|$|E
5|$|The Path of the Wizard and Path of the King {{share the}} same final level, set at the Black Gate of Mordor. In a further effort to {{distract}} Sauron from the approach of Frodo and Sam, Gandalf advises that Aragorn and the remaining army marches to the Gates of Mordor as a direct challenge to Sauron, who will send out a vast army to meet them, thus keeping his attention away from Mount Doom. Upon arriving at the Gate, the party are confronted by the Mouth of Sauron (Roger L. Jackson), who tells them that Frodo is dead. They kill him and must then face a massive army of orcs, before fighting the remaining Nazg√ªl. Not believing Frodo to be dead, they plan to fight <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>can,</b> ultimately sacrificing themselves so as to give Frodo enough time to destroy the Ring.|$|E

The cycle repeats with the pull phase. However, some people prefer to touch in front, because it helps them catch water, <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> do this efficiently, they are not losing anything.|$|E

25|$|The debates {{lasted about}} 90 minutes each, {{did not include}} commercials, and had a preset time for each answer and each reply, and the {{obligation}} to film only the speaking person at any given time. The candidates were also forbidden to bring any kind of notes with them, even though they could write some down during the debate, and no audience was allowed to participate. This set of rules was very unusual in Italian political talk shows, where politicians usually interrupt each other, talk simultaneously and for <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> hold the word. Questions to candidates are posted by two journalists from the Italian press: the moderator himself {{was not allowed to}} ask any questions, but only to present the debate and guarantee respect of the rules. At the end of the debates, the candidates are allowed to make a final statement of 3 minutes.|$|E

500|$|A {{paramedic}} {{also said}} police allowed the first ambulances that reached Pearl Roundabout to pass safely, while some security personnel captured videos, {{but when the}} ambulances moved out carrying casualties security forces had targeted the vehicles. He said: [...] "Later Bahrain T.V. showed only the scenes where they allowed us to pass in order to mislead the public opinion. I personally heard orders given to security forces via their communication devices to target, threat and delay paramedics <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>can.</b> Security forces dealt with us {{as if we were}} defendants and partners to protesters who wanted to hide them, whereas what we were doing was a professional and humane duty {{that has nothing to do}} with our political position." [...] When the block was lifted in the late morning till noon, paramedics did not find any casualties to take back to the SMC at Pearl Roundabout, despite seeing handcuffed protesters being stomped on by police when they arrived.|$|E
500|$|In 2011, Allistair Pinsof at Destructoid {{reviewed}} the game, {{calling it a}} mix between Paperboy and Muscle March {{in terms of the}} complexity and pace, and compared the gameplay to Crash Bandicoot. He found it to be [...] "such a gloriously twisted, charming spectacle" [...] that it would be difficult not to like it; he said that the main reason to play the game is [...] "the sheer lunacy" [...] of it, saying that the game is [...] "obsessed" [...] with America, and portrays Americans as [...] "unhygienic hillbillies" [...] in a manner that makes it unclear if it is a self-aware parody or not. He concluded that the game is funny, but not great, and that the ridiculous premise and its large amount of small details make the game [...] "charmingly brain-dead". In 2013, Justin Amirkhani at Complex included the game in a list of company-branded video games that [...] "didn't suck", saying that while the game's graphics had not aged well, it was mechanically very similar to Temple Run, which Amirkhani called his favorite iOS game. He concluded that Pepsiman is not a bad game for people with quick reflexes, <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> stand the high amount of advertising within the game; he claimed that Pepsiman was the advergame with the largest amount of [...] "logos-per-second".|$|E
500|$|A {{seasonal}} review {{column on}} the Anime News Network called The Stream generally made light remarks of the first four episodes. Written by Bamboo Dong, the editor called the series mindlessly fun; jokingly citing how the cell phones are always pointed directly at the demons as {{if they would be}} incapable of fighting if it were otherwise. Dong also likened the series as watching someone else play the video game. The designs of the various demons and Septentriones were described as the most interesting part of the series. On the other hand, the editor described the immense amount of [...] plot packed into the next batch of four episodes as messy. Dong also referred to the central premise as being pretty dark since it involved the main characters constantly receiving videos showing exactly how their friends would die. The editor gave the series props for not dabbling in the destruction porn taking place since all of the widespread death around Japan is implied, but added that showing some of it would have aided the realism of the story. After reviewing twelve episodes Dong was not able to develop any interest in the characters. This continued into the series finale and Dong still felt that the characters were not fleshed out {{as much as they could}} have been. Dong explained that since there was basically no time to explore how the characters reacted to a disappearing world, it was essentially dehumanizing to such an extent that their deaths carried no emotional weight. Dong presented a full series review in their Shelf Life column and expressed that viewers who like brawn, action and some emotion will enjoy the series <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> come to terms with the fact that they'll pretty much just be watching someone play a video game for several hours.|$|E

500|$|This England {{received}} positive critical reception. David Patrick Stearns of Philadelphia Daily News {{awarded the}} album 3.5 out of 4 stars and, also {{referring to the}} success of Music for a Time of War, wrote that the repertoire has [...] "perfectly wide appeal, especially in vital, muscular performances such as these". Stearns, who appreciated Kalmar's balance of technicality and the music's [...] "exterior atmosphere", called the performances [...] "thoughtful" [...] and [...] "incisive". He also noted the originality of the interludes and [...] "Passacaglia" [...] from Peter Grimes, claiming they [...] "won't be mistaken for anybody else's." [...] In his review for The Huffington Post, Brian Horay wrote that the orchestra delivered [...] "knockout" [...] and [...] "beefy-yet-restrained" [...] performances of the Peter Grimes compositions. Referring to This England and its preceding album, which featured Sinfonia da Requiem, Horay said the recordings [...] "showcase Kalmar and his band as supreme interpreters of Benjamin Britten's amazingly colorful brand of orchestral anxiety, inviting the listener to delve ever deeper into painful, yet rewarding, symphonic ambivalence." [...] Classical CD Review's Robert Benson called the Elgar performance [...] "brilliant" [...] and appreciated that [...] "Passacaglia" [...] was programmed before [...] "The Storm". Benson complimented Kalmar (calling him a [...] "conductor to watch") as well as the sound of the recording, describing it as [...] "well-balanced orchestral sound, with a wide dynamic range". He noted the lack of audience interference with the sound and assured audiophiles that they would appreciate the quality. Steven Ritter of Audiophile Audition wrote that the Symphony performed [...] "with a brilliance and verve equal to any on record" [...] and were [...] "entirely attuned to the 'English' idiom". Ritter complimented Kalmar and the orchestra for the performances, saying [...] "Who knew Oregon could sound like this? PentaTone should hold on to this bunch <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>can,</b> and explore as much repertory as they can handle. Great sound, performances, and production!" ...|$|E

[...] On March 21, 2011, Politico reported that McCaskill had failed to pay more than $280,000 in property taxes on the plane and was planning to sell it. [...] "I have convinced my husband to sell the damn plane", McCaskill said on a conference call with reporters. [...] "I will never set foot on the plane again".
