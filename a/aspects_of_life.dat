5|$|Some of {{the oldest}} and most common {{objections}} to evolution dispute whether evolution can truly account for all the apparent complexity and order in the natural world. It is argued that evolution is too unlikely or otherwise lacking to account for various <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> <b>life,</b> and therefore that an intelligence, such as God of the Abrahamic religions, must at the very least be appealed to for those specific features.|$|E

5|$|All three {{thresher}} shark species were reassessed from Data Deficient to Vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) in 2007.

In addition to continued fishing pressure, common threshers are also taken as bycatch in other gear such as bottom trawls and fish traps, and are considered a nuisance by mackerel fishers as they become entangled in the nets.|$|E

5|$|From {{the time}} that European {{settlers}} first arrived in South Africa in 1652, the country was divided on racial lines, in common with similar settlements. In contrast to other European colonies, racial distinction and segregation intensified during the early 20th century, and the various ethnic groups became more sharply defined and divided. Following its general election victory in 1948, the National Party, led by Daniel Malan, formalised this racism under a government policy called apartheid. Under apartheid, different races were kept apart in all <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> <b>life.</b> This system was thoroughly enforced during the 1950s; any resistance from non-white races was put down and laws, supposedly to prevent the rise of communism, were passed to prevent political agitation.|$|E

5|$|There are literary, archaeological, epigraphic and numismatic {{sources of}} ancient Tamil history.

40|$|This {{study is}} an {{exploration}} of whether golf-related online community use is related to sport involvement, social capital, the social <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> satisfaction and golf participation. Golf-related online community use was measured in two ways: total time spent in online communities {{and the extent of}} contribution in online communities. The study is best characterised as quantitative research. In total, 101 usable responses to an online questionnaire were received using convenience sampling. The data was analysed with mean difference testing and correlation analyses. It was found that those who contribute more often in online communities experience greater levels of one of the three dimensions of involvement, bonding and bridging social capital and the social <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> satisfaction. There {{was no significant difference between}} those who lurked (individuals who do not post but regularly read content in online communities) and those who contributed in two of the three sport involvement dimensions, the influence of golf on the social <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> satisfaction and the average number of rounds of golf played per month. The correlation analyses suggest that when an individual spends more time online they are likely to report greater levels of all three dimensions of sport involvement, bonding social capital, bridging social capital and a greater influence of golf on the social <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> satisfaction. However, the analysis did not suggest an individual would play more golf, improve their handicap or report greater levels <b>of</b> the social <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> satisfaction if they spent more time in online communities. Recommendations are made for future researchers and implications are identified for sport managers...|$|R

Although he does not realise it, the play suggests that there are virtuous people. Merital, in response to Wisemore, believes that Wisemore's philosophical inclinations are foolish.

5|$|A person's {{experience}} in managing sexuality after the injury relies {{not only on}} physical factors like severity and level of the injury, but on <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> circumstances and personality such as sexual experience and attitudes about sex. As well as evaluating physical concerns, clinicians {{must take into account}} factors that affect each patient's situation: gender, age, cultural, and social factors. Aspects of patients' cultural and religious backgrounds, even if unnoticed before the injury caused sexual dysfunction, affect care and treatments—particularly when cultural attitudes and assumptions of patients and care providers conflict. Health professionals must be sensitive to issues of sexual orientation and gender identity, showing respect and acceptance while communicating, listening, and emotionally supporting. Providers who treat SCI have been found to assume their patients are heterosexual or to exclude LGBTQ patients from their awareness, potentially resulting in substandard care. Academic research on sexuality and disability under-represents LGBTQ perspectives as well.|$|E
5|$|Although the Nazis won the {{greatest}} {{share of the}} popular vote in the two Reichstag general elections of 1932, they did not have a majority and therefore Hitler led a short-lived coalition government formed by the NSDAP and the German National People's Party. Under pressure from politicians, industrialists and the business community, President Paul von Hindenburg appointed Hitler as Chancellor of Germany on 30 January 1933. This event is known as the Machtergreifung ("seizure of power"). In the following months, the NSDAP used a process termed Gleichschaltung ("co-ordination") to rapidly bring all <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> under control of the party. All civilian organisations, including agricultural groups, volunteer organisations and sports clubs, had their leadership replaced with Nazi sympathisers or party members. By June 1933, virtually the only organisations not in the control of the NSDAP were the army and the churches.|$|E

5|$|The Soviet propaganda-motivated {{support for}} Polish-language {{cultural}} activities, however, {{clashed with the}} official policy of Russification. The Soviets at first intended to phase out the Polish language and so banned Polish from schools, street signs, and other <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> <b>life.</b> This policy was, however, reversed at times—first before the elections in October 1939; and later, after the German conquest of France. In November 1940, the Poles of Lwów observed the 85th anniversary of Adam Mickiewicz's death. Soon, however, Stalin decided to re-implement the Russification policies. He reversed his decision again, however, when a need arose for Polish-language pro-Soviet propaganda following the German invasion of the Soviet Union; as a result Stalin permitted the creation of Polish forces in the East and later decided to create a Communist People's Republic of Poland.|$|E
5|$|By far, {{the most}} {{important}} source of ancient Tamil history is the corpus of Tamil poems, referred to as Sangam literature, generally dated from the last centuries of the pre-Christian era to the early centuries of the Christian era. It consists of 2,381 known poems, {{with a total of}} over 50,000 lines, written by 473 poets. Each poem belongs to one of two types: Akam (inside) and Puram (outside). The akam poems deal with inner human emotions such as love and the puram poems deal with outer experiences such as society, culture and warfare. They contain descriptions of various <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> in the ancient Tamil country. The Maduraikkanci by Mankudi Maruthanaar contains a full-length description of Madurai and the Pandyan country under the rule of Nedunj Cheliyan III. The Netunalvatai by Nakkirar contains a description of the king’s palace. The Purananuru and Akanaṉūṟu collections contain poems sung in praise of various kings and also poems that were composed by the kings themselves. The Sangam age anthology Pathirruppaththu provides the genealogy of two collateral lines for three or four generations of the Cheras, along with describing the Chera country, in general. The poems in Ainkurnuru, written by numerous authors, were compiled by Kudalur Kizhar at the instance of Chera King Yanaikkatcey Mantaran Ceral Irumporai.The Chera kings are also mentioned in other works such as Akanaṉūṟu, Kuruntokai, Natṟiṇai and Purananuru. The Pattinappaalai describes the Chola port city of Kaveripumpattinam in great detail. It mentions Eelattu-unavu – food from Eelam – arriving at the port. One of the prominent Sangam Tamil poets is known as Eelattu Poothanthevanar meaning Poothan-thevan (proper name) hailing from Eelam mentioned in Akanaṉūṟu: 88, 231, 307; Kurunthokai: 189, 360, 343 and Naṟṟiṇai: 88, 366.|$|E
