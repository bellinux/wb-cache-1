5|$|Comets can loosely {{be divided}} into two categories: short-period and long-period—the latter being thought to {{originate}} in the Oort cloud. The two major categories of short-period comets are Jupiter-family comets (JFCs) and Halley-type comets. Halley-type comets, which are named after their prototype, Halley's Comet, <b>are</b> <b>thought</b> to have originated in the Oort cloud but to have been drawn into the inner Solar System by the gravity of the giant planets, whereas the JFCs <b>are</b> <b>thought</b> to have originated in the scattered disc. The centaurs <b>are</b> <b>thought</b> to be a dynamically intermediate stage between the scattered disc and the Jupiter family.|$|E

5|$|A basic {{sub-division}} is a {{grouping of}} the eight inner regular moons, which have nearly circular orbits near the plane of Jupiter's equator and <b>are</b> <b>thought</b> to have formed with Jupiter. The remainder of the moons consist of {{an unknown number of}} small irregular moons with elliptical and inclined orbits, which <b>are</b> <b>thought</b> to be captured asteroids or fragments of captured asteroids. Irregular moons that belong to a group share similar orbital elements and thus may have a common origin, perhaps as a larger moon or captured body that broke up.|$|E

5|$|Along {{with other}} Estrildines, these species <b>are</b> <b>thought</b> to have {{originated}} in Asia. The species {{has been introduced}} {{to other parts of}} the world due to its popularity as a cage bird and populations have established in the wild.|$|E
5|$|Although Mirza, Microcebus, and Allocebus form a clade within Cheirogaleidae, {{the three}} {{lineages}} <b>are</b> <b>thought</b> to have diverged during a narrow window of time, so the relationships within this clade {{are difficult to}} determine and may change with further research. All three <b>are</b> <b>thought</b> to have diverged at least 20mya (million years ago), although another estimate using mtDNA places the divergence between Mirza and Microcebus at 24.2mya. Divergence between the two recognized species of giant mouse lemur is estimated at 2.1mya.|$|E
5|$|Although P. rebeli {{is found}} across the Palearctic (see subspecies), it is {{difficult}} to determine exactly where they inhabit because of their similarity with P. alcon. In Western Europe they <b>are</b> <b>thought</b> to be concentrated in the Alps and in Southern Europe.|$|E

5|$|Comets <b>are</b> <b>thought</b> to {{have two}} {{separate}} points of origin in the Solar System. Short-period comets (those with orbits of up to 200years) are generally accepted to have emerged from either the Kuiper belt or the scattered disc, which are two linked flat discs of icy debris beyond Neptune's orbit at 30AU and jointly extending out beyond 100AU from the Sun. Long-period comets, such as comet Hale–Bopp, whose orbits last for thousands of years, <b>are</b> <b>thought</b> to originate in the Oort cloud. The orbits within the Kuiper belt are relatively stable, and so very few comets <b>are</b> <b>thought</b> to originate there. The scattered disc, however, is dynamically active, and is {{far more likely to}} be the place of origin for comets. Comets pass from the scattered disc into the realm of the outer planets, becoming what are known as centaurs. These centaurs are then sent farther inward to become the short-period comets.|$|E

5|$|Neptune's {{dark spots}} <b>are</b> <b>thought</b> {{to occur in}} the {{troposphere}} at lower altitudes than the brighter cloud features, so they appear as holes in the upper cloud decks. As they are stable features that can persist for several months, they <b>are</b> <b>thought</b> to be vortex structures. Often associated with dark spots are brighter, persistent methane clouds that form around the tropopause layer. The persistence of companion clouds shows that some former dark spots may continue to exist as cyclones even though they are no longer visible as a dark feature. Dark spots may dissipate when they migrate too close to the equator or possibly through some other unknown mechanism.|$|E

The shower was discovered by Michael Buhagiar from Perth, Australia, who observed meteors on six occasions between 1969 and 1980.
