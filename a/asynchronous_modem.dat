40|$|EPUB is an {{electronic}} publishing system {{maintained by the}} Energy Information Administration (EIA) of the U. S. Department of Energy. EPUB allows the general public to electronically access selected energy data from many of EIA`s statistical reports. The system is a menu-driven, bulletin board type system with extensive online help capabilities that can be accessed free-of-charge 24 hours a day by using a terminal or PC with an <b>asynchronous</b> <b>modem.</b> (EPUB will be taken down briefly at midnight for backup). PC users must provide the following information to their communications software in order to successfully access the EPUB system...|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the MCACCU units required to support 1200/75 dial up access, the Update Centre machines were also connected to special modems provided to support online bulk updating by IPs. Banks of 300/300 bit/s full duplex <b>asynchronous</b> V21 <b>modems</b> supported computer to computer links for the more sophisticated IP while 1200 bit/s half duplex V23 modems supported so called intelligent editing terminals (i.e. those capable of storing a number of frames offline before uploading to the UDC). In addition twin 9-track NRZI tape decks of 800 bytes/inch capacity were provided {{in order to support}} bulk offline updates.|$|R
50|$|The USART's {{synchronous}} capabilities {{were primarily}} intended to support synchronous protocols like IBM's Synchronous transmit-receive (STR), Binary Synchronous Communications (BSC), Synchronous Data Link Control (SDLC), and the ISO-standard High-Level Data Link Control (HDLC) synchronous link-layer protocols, which were used with synchronous voice-frequency modems. These protocols {{were designed to}} make the best use of bandwidth when modems were analog devices. In those times, the fastest <b>asynchronous</b> voice-band <b>modem</b> could achieve at most speeds of 300 bit/s using frequency-shift keying modulation, while synchronous modems could run at speeds up to 9600 bit/s using phase-shift keying. Synchronous transmission used only slightly over 80% of the bandwidth of the now more-familiar asynchronous transmission, since start and stop bits were unnecessary. Those modems are obsolete, having been replaced by <b>modems</b> which convert <b>asynchronous</b> data to synchronous forms, but similar synchronous telecommunications protocols survive in numerous block-oriented technologies such as the widely used IEEE 802.2 (Ethernet) link-level protocol. USARTs are still sometimes integrated with MCUs. USARTs are still used in routers that connect to external CSU/DSU devices, and they often use either Cisco's proprietary HDLC implementation or the IETF standard Point-to-Point Protocol in HDLC-like framing as defined in RFC 1662.|$|R
5000|$|EDI {{provides}} a technical basis for automated commercial [...] "conversations" [...] between two entities, either internal or external. The term EDI encompasses the entire {{electronic data interchange}} process, including the transmission, message flow, document format, and software used to interpret the documents. However, EDI standards describe the rigorous format of electronic documents, and the EDI standards were designed by the implementers, initially in the Automotive industry, to be independent of communication and software technologies. EDI can be transmitted using any methodology agreed to by the sender and recipient. This includes a variety of technologies, including <b>modem</b> (<b>asynchronous</b> and synchronous), FTP, e-mail, HTTP, AS1, AS2, AS4 etc. It is important to differentiate between the EDI documents and the methods for transmitting them. When they compared the synchronous protocol 2400 bit/s modems, CLEO devices, and value-added networks used to transmit EDI documents to transmitting via the Internet, some people equated the non-Internet technologies with EDI and predicted erroneously that EDI itself would be replaced along with the non-Internet technologies. These non-internet transmission methods are being replaced by Internet protocols such as FTP, HTTP, telnet, and e-mail, but the EDI documents themselves still remain.|$|R
