WWE then moved him to the main roster in 2002 where he formed an alliance, with Kurt <b>Angle</b> <b>and</b> Charlie Haas, known as Team <b>Angle</b> (<b>and</b> later the World's Greatest Tag Team with Haas). During his tenure with the company, he won the Intercontinental Championship three times, the United States Championship once, and the WWE Tag Team Championship twice with Haas.|$|E

5|$|The {{amount of}} trail a {{particular}} bike has may vary with time for several reasons. On bikes with front suspension, especially telescopic forks, compressing the front suspension, due to heavy braking for example, can steepen the steering axis <b>angle</b> <b>and</b> reduce trail. Trail also varies with lean <b>angle,</b> <b>and</b> steering angle, usually decreasing from a maximum when the bike is straight upright and steered straight ahead. Trail can decrease to zero with sufficiently large lean and steer angles, which can alter how stable a bike feels. Finally, even {{the profile of}} the front tire can influence how trail varies as the bike is leaned and steered.|$|E

5|$|The other {{featured}} preliminary {{match was}} Kurt Angle versus The Big Show in a singles match. The buildup to the match began on September 9, 2004 during {{an episode of}} SmackDown!, where a Lumberjack match (a standard match where non-participating wrestlers prevent contestants from fleeing the ring) was scheduled between Kurt <b>Angle</b> <b>and</b> Eddie Guerrero. The match ended in a no contest when The Big Show marked his return to SmackDown! by interfering in the match, chokeslamming both <b>Angle</b> <b>and</b> Guerrero in the process. The following week, Big Show was given two contracts to choose from; one contract to face Guerrero and one contract to face Angle. Big Show signed the contract with Guerrero's name on it. After signing it, <b>Angle</b> <b>and</b> his associate Luther Reigns, threw Guerrero {{out of the ring}} and offered Big Show a handshake. Big Show, however, tore up Guerrero's contract and signed the one with Angle's name on it to face him at No Mercy.|$|E

5|$|A.J. Styles fought Kurt Angle in {{the sixth}} {{encounter}} of the show next. The match lasted 22 minutes and 44 seconds. Angle was accompanied by Tomko to the ring. The referee forced Tomko {{to head to the}} backstage area due to the referee believing he would interfere. Styles attempted to perform his signature Styles Clash maneuver on Angle, which Angle countered into his signature Ankle Lock submission hold. Styles escaped the hold, causing Angle to crash into the referee, knocking him out in the storyline. Karen Angle then ran down to the ringside area and attempted to hand Angle a steel chair. Once Angle grabbed the chair she refused to release, allowing Styles to grab <b>Angle</b> <b>and</b> perform the Styles Clash by slamming Angle face-first into the mat. Styles then followed with the pin attempt to win the contest. After the encounter, <b>Angle</b> <b>and</b> Tomko assaulted Styles.|$|E

5|$|In {{the main}} event, John Cena defended the WWE Championship against Kurt <b>Angle</b> <b>and</b> Shawn Michaels, who {{received}} the fans' vote {{to be part of}} the Triple Threat match. Early in the match, Cena performed a back body drop on Angle, sending him outside. Michaels, who was thrown out of the ring, received the upper hand over Cena until Angle returned to the mat, performing a variety of suplexes on both Michaels and Cena. Mid-way in the match, <b>Angle</b> <b>and</b> Michaels double teamed Cena, lifting him in the air, crashing face-first on the Spanish announce table. Back in the ring, Angle Angle Slammed Michaels from the top turnbuckles. Angle then tried to apply the ankle lock on Michaels, but Cena entered the ring, clotheslining Angle out of the ring. Cena proceeded and back body dropped Michaels, attempting to perform a Five Knuckle Shuffle but Kurt Angle pulled Cena out of the ring, tossing him over the security barricade. Toward the end, Angle caught Cena in the ankle lock. Michaels, who was on the outside, delivered a Diving Elbow Drop, on <b>Angle</b> <b>and</b> performed Sweet Chin Music on him. After that, Cena executed the FU on Michaels and pinned him to retain the title.|$|E
5|$|In {{the main}} event, John Cena faced Kurt Angle for the WWE Championship. The match began with <b>Angle</b> <b>and</b> Cena locking up, leading to Angle taking Cena {{down with a}} {{headlock}} takeover. Cena countered many attacks by <b>Angle</b> <b>and</b> was able to reverse the ankle lock. Cena attempted an FU but Angle delivered an Angle Slam. Eric Bischoff came down the ramp and cheered for Angle, who had the Ankle Lock applied on Cena. Cena rolled out of the move, grabbed the championship belt, which Bischoff had brought with him, and hit Angle with it. The referee saw this and called for the bell. As a result, Cena was disqualified for hitting Angle with the championship, ultimately resulting in him retaining his title. After the match, Angle attacked Cena until Cena delivered an FU through the Spanish announce table on Angle.|$|E

At {{the start of the}} year, <b>Angle</b> <b>and</b> Michaels both participated in the Royal Rumble match at the 2005 Royal Rumble {{pay-per-view}} event. During the match, Michaels eliminated Angle. In retaliation, Angle returned to the match and eliminated Michaels and then attacked him outside the ring. The two engaged in a feud, which led to an Interpromotional match at WrestleMania 21, as Angle was part of the SmackDown! roster and Michaels belonged to the Raw roster. At WrestleMania 21, Angle got the win over Michaels by forcing him to submit to the Ankle Lock. On the June 13 episode of Raw, Angle was revealed to be the second draft pick for the Raw brand. That same evening, Michaels challenged Angle to a rematch at Vengeance, which Angle accepted.|$|E
