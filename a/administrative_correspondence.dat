50|$|When the {{occasion}} demanded, Achaemenid <b>administrative</b> <b>correspondence</b> {{was conducted in}} Greek, making it a widely used bureaucratic language. Even though the Achaemenids had extensive contacts with the Greeks and vice versa, and had conquered many of the Greek-speaking areas both in Europe and Asia Minor during different periods of the empire, the native Old Iranian sources provide no indication of Greek linguistic evidence. However, {{there is plenty of}} evidence (in addition to the accounts of Herodotus) that Greeks, apart from being deployed and employed in the core regions of the empire, also evidently lived and worked in the heartland of the Achaemenid Empire, namely Iran. For example, Greeks were part of the various ethnicities that constructed Darius' palace in Susa, apart from the Greek inscriptions found nearby there, and one short Persepolis tablet written in Greek.|$|E
50|$|As for the functioning, the <b>administrative</b> <b>correspondence</b> {{came to the}} {{different}} Councils, to Madrid, then the secretary of every Council arranged the material that had to deliver {{for the attention of}} the king, and later the King assembled with the secretaries requesting the opinion of the Council. After that, the Council answered afterwards a session to treat the issue and to raise the formal consultation to the monarch. The secretary raise the consultation to the king, and was returned to the Council with his response to be executed. The meetings of the Councils took place in the royal palace, and they did not count on the presence of the king habitually. In this polisynodial system stood out for its importance, the Consejo de Estado (Council of State). The Consejo de Estado in Madrid, entrusted to declare on the major decisions that concerned the organization and the defense of the ensamble of the Hispanic monarchy, and it had frequently that to get into Portuguese matters. Even, the Council of War (Consejo de Guerra) exercised its jurisdiction on the troops placed in the Castilian strongholds established on the Portuguese littoral.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} political prophecy in England {{during the}} reign of Elizabeth I (1558 - 1603). The belief that foreknowledge of events could be attained through means such as the practice of astrology, revelation from God, or the interpretation of supposedly prophetic texts was widespread in English society during the early modern period. This thesis discusses how those both within and outside of the government used prophecy in their engagement with the political issues which faced England during Elizabeth’s reign, especially in relation to religion and the succession. Because prophecy offered a source of authority for political change it was often employed in opposition to established authorities, prompting legislation criminalising seditious prophecies and printed works condemning them. By examining a wide range of primary sources, including assize records, Privy Council reports, depositions, diplomatic and <b>administrative</b> <b>correspondence,</b> and printed tracts and sermons, this thesis reveals how prophecy pervaded the political culture of Elizabethan England...|$|E
40|$|Edward I of England (1272 - 1307), {{best known}} to modern audiences as ‘the Hammer of the Scots’ {{and the founder}} of the English Parliament, corresponded with {{hundreds}} of aristocrats and officials. Several thousand of these letters survive. Letters were a crucial part of his political strategy. They facilitated governance by directing royal representatives scattered over a large realm, and thus enabled the king to consolidate power {{in the wake of the}} baronial rebellion that occupied the last decades of his father’s rule. Adopting a case study approach, this thesis argues that the rhetoric of such <b>administrative</b> <b>correspondence</b> was politically meaningful despite its often formulaic appearance. Reading hitherto unexamined letters in light of both contextual detail and the standard epistolary structures advocated by medieval theorists I interpret these sources as social artefacts that both reflected and sought to influence the relationship of the political community to the crown. In so doing, I suggest a new understanding of how kingly authority was made and maintained in the 13 th century. My approach provides a method for reading other extant royal letters as episodes of strategic communication, not simply and only as relics of a well-developed medieval bureaucracy...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the current}} project (“Swedish Pho-netics ’ 39 -‘ 69 ”) is to provide {{an account of the}} historical, social, discursive, and rhetoric con-ditions that {{determined}} the emergence of pho-netic science in Sweden between 1939 and 1969. The inquiry is based on a investigation in four areas: how empirical phonetic data were analysed in the period, how the discipline gained new knowledge about phonetic facts through improvements in experimental settings, how technological equipment specially adapted to phonetic research was developed, and how diverging phonetic explanations became com-peting paradigms. Understanding of the devel-opment of phonetic knowledge may be synthe-sised in the persona of particularly emblematic phoneticians: Bertil Malmberg embodied the boom that happened in the field of Swedish phonetics during this period. The emergence of internationally recognized Swedish research in phonetics was largely his work. This investiga-tion is based on two different corpora. The first corpus is the set of 216 contributions, the full authorship of Malmberg published between 1939 and 1969. The second corpus is his ar-chive, owned by Lund University. It includes semi-official and official letters, <b>administrative</b> <b>correspondence,</b> funding applications (…). The two are complementary. The study of both is necessary for achieving a systematic descrip-tion of the development of phonetic knowledge in Sweden.

40|$|John Cheever {{published}} {{over two}} hundred short stories {{in an array of}} small-, mid-, and large-circulation magazines between 1930 and 1981. One hundred and twenty of these stories appeared in The New Yorker. During Cheever’s career and since his death in 1982, many critics have typically analysed his short stories in isolation from the conditions of their production, lest Cheever’s subversive modernist tendencies be confused with the conservative middlebrow ethos of The New Yorker, or the populist aspect of other large-circulation magazines. Critics, including Cheever’s daughter and his most recent biographer Blake Bailey, also claim that Cheever was a financial and, ultimately, artistic victim of the magazine marketplace. Drawing on largely unpublished editorial and <b>administrative</b> <b>correspondence</b> in the New Yorker Records and editorially annotated short story typescripts in the John Cheever Literary Manuscripts collection, and using a historicised close-reading practice, this thesis examines the influence of the magazine marketplace on the short fiction that Cheever produced between 1930 and 1964. It challenges the critical consensus by arguing that Cheever did not dissociate his authorship from commerciality at any point during his career, and consistently exploited the magazine marketplace to his financial and creative advantage, whether this meant temporarily producing stories for little magazines in the early 1930 s and romance stories for mainstream titles in the 1940 s, or selling his New Yorker rejections to its rivals, which he did throughout his career. Cheever also developed strong working relationships with his editors at The New Yorker during the 1940 s and 1950 s. This thesis re-evaluates these relationships by analysing comparatively the drafts, archival materials that have hitherto been neglected by critics, and published versions of some of Cheever’s best known New Yorker stories. In so doing, this thesis demonstrates the crucial role that editorial collaboration played in Cheever’s writing process...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{contributes}} to the debate regarding {{the frequency with which}} letters with co-senders occurred in the Graeco-Roman world.   While a number of scholars have noted the presence of co-senders in the Pauline letters, there is currently no agreement regarding the frequency of this phenomenon in the wider Graeco-Roman world and so no agreement regarding whether the Pauline practice of regularly including co-senders is unique or simply reflects a letter-writing convention of the time. An examination of a selection of ancient Greek letters from a variety of milieux – published works, papyri and inscriptions – and ranging in date from the second century B. C. E. to the fourth century C. E., suggests that letters with co-senders occurred with reasonable frequency, in the Graeco-Roman world, mainly in official and <b>administrative</b> <b>correspondence.</b> This in turn suggests that the Pauline letters are not especially unusual in their inclusion of co-senders in the letter prescript and are utilising an established convention. By identifying a significant body of extra-Biblical letters with co-senders, this thesis also aims to provide a broadly contemporary material with which the Pauline letters can be compared, to ascertain whether they follow the same conventions as other letters with co-senders.   Such a comparison suggests firstly, that letters from multiple senders are often from co-workers, {{as in the case of}} the Pauline epistles; secondly, that the prescripts of the Pauline epistles present Paul as the primary sender; thirdly that the Pauline epistles are unusual in the frequency with which they use the first person singular, so referring to only one of the senders, in letters apparently from multiple senders. This thesis argues that the contribution of a co-sender to a letter can vary considerably from contributing to the creation of the letter to simply providing support for its contents. Therefore, both in the case of the Pauline epistles and more generally, each letter needs to be considered independently to ascertain the reasons for the inclusion of the co-sender(s) and their role within the letter.

40|$|Profit, embezzlement, restitution. The {{role of the}} traitants in the Nine Years War and Chamillart’s tax on {{financial}} benefits The aim {{of this article is}} to revisit the question of the financiers in Old Regime France. It starts with an analysis of the discourses about the financiers under the Absolute monarchy that underlines the complexity of their relationship with the government and the public. It then reviews the secondary literature and highlights the existence of competing historical interpretations (functional, political, utilitarian), which raise the question of their overall capacity to account for the role and impact of the financiers at different times. On this ground, the article focuses on a specific group of financiers, the so-called traitants d’affaires extraordinaires, during the Nine Years War. Further to a description of the specific role and scope of the activities of the various financiers responsible for helping the monarchy to raise the funds it needed to pay for its peace and wartime expenditure, the article examines the conditions and profits granted by the king in his contracts with the traitants whose services were hired for the purpose of selling royal offices in the public and advancing the revenue to the Treasury. It also explores the contractual arrangements of the companies established by the financiers to manage their operations as well as the rights and the responsibilities of their various stakeholders. These bases being laid, the article relies on the <b>administrative</b> <b>correspondence</b> relating to the traités during the Nine Years War to address a range of issues, in particular the extent to which these contracts, and other control procedures, were robust enough to deter fraud. The accounts of two traitants’ companies offer an opportunity to analyse and compare the structure of their income and expenditure (including the volume and cost of the promissory notes sold in the public to finance their payments to the Treasury), to explore the strategies of the contractors, to calculate their net profits and further discuss the problem of embezzlement. The article ends with the study of the context and debates which led to the introduction by finance minister Michel Chamillart, in 1700, of a shortfall tax on the financial profits of the gens d’affaires or traitants, the method used to determine its rate (50...|$|E

Originally, beginning in 1925, the Committee was jointly sponsored by the YIVO and the S. An-Ski Jewish Historical Ethnographic Society in Vilna (founded in 1919 by S. An-Ski and named for him following his death in 1920). The activities of the Ethnographic Committee consisted of collecting folklore materials, preparing and analyzing folklore questionnaires, corresponding with folklore collectors throughout the world, and maintaining a museum. Members of the Ethnographic Committee included S. Bastomski, Dr. Max Weinreich, N. Weinig, Nechama Epstein, Zalman Reisen, N. Chayes. In 1930, the name of the Ethnographic Committee was changed to the Folklore Committee. In 1938 the S. An-Ski Society merged with the YIVO Institute and its ethnographic materials were integrated with the archives of the YIVO Ethnographic Committee. These included records inherited from the Society's predecessor, the Society of Friends of Jewish Antiquity (founded in 1913 by S. An-Ski), as well as some records of the Jewish Historical and Ethnographic Society in St. Petersburg (founded in 1908 by Simon Dubnow). Finally, certain folklore materials from the Jewish Bureau of the White Russian Academy of Sciences in Minsk (founded in 1925 and dissolved in the 1930 s) were merged with the YIVO materials during the Nazi occupation in Vilna. The records of the Ethnographic Committee of the YIVO Institute include materials from the above-mentioned organizations. Records of each organization are arranged in a separate series...|$|E
