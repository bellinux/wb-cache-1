40|$|We {{report on}} the results of work on three {{bacterial}} zoonoses arising as part of a large project dealing with zoonotic infections amongst livestock and the farmers who keep them. Domestic livestock are an important source of zoonotic infections to humans, particularly in rural parts of Africa. Understanding the interactions between people and their domestic animals, and the transmission of zoonoses between them, is of vital importance in creating the evidence-based disease control policies that are required to protect both human and animal health. The wider project addresses the impact of co-factors (a condition that influences the effects of another condition) on the epidemiology of, and burden imposed by, these diseases. We describe the results of an analysis of three bacterial infections of major public health significance (q-fever, brucellosis and tuberculosis), with a focus on infection in both domestic cattle and humans. In particular, we explore the spatial distribution of these infections in Western Kenya, and explore patterns of infection at the household level in both species (n= 450 households). In addition, using multivariate methods, we examine non-zoonotic co-factors as explanatory variables for the individual pathogens, and quantify the risk of co-infections with multiple bacterial zoonoses. We use our wealth of <b>ancillary</b> <b>risk</b> factor data to explain the patterns observed...|$|E

40|$|Risk {{tradeoff}} {{analysis is}} in the process of transforming the practice of regulation. Its core idea is simple and intuitively appealing: Regulations undertaken to minimize or eliminate certain health risks often have the perverse effect of promoting other risks. A serious analysis of the impact of a regulation should pay attention not only to its primary effects in reducing the so-called target risk, but also to the secondary effects of the regulation in bringing about 2 ̆ 2 <b>ancillary</b> <b>risks.</b> 2 ̆ 2 In this way, risk tradeoff analysis promises a more rational technique for the evaluation of regulation. Risk tradeoff analysis, however, focuses exclusively on the negative secondary effects of risk regulation, but systematically ignores the phenomenon of 2 ̆ 2 ancillary benefits, 2 ̆ 2 the reductions in risk that take place in addition to [...] and as a direct or indirect result of [...] reductions in the target risk. The resulting conclusions are therefore consistently biased against regulation. This methodological bias is, in turn, reinforced by an institutional bias that emerges when risk tradeoff analysis is applied in the administrative state. Agency inattention to ancillary effects gives rise to iterative processes of administrative oversight and judicial review that privilege the opponents of regulation. This Article sheds light on these biases and proposes a solution: ancillary benefit analysis. This technique would direct the attention of administrative decisionmakers to the positive byproducts of regulation designed to promote health, safety, and the environment. At a time when risk tradeoff analysis enjoys ever-growing support in the courts and the academy, this Article proposes an approach through which to counteract its one-sidedness...|$|R
40|$|Stroke {{remains a}} common and costly problem world-wide, but {{substantial}} advances {{have been made}} in recent decades in understanding stroke mechanisms, risk factors, and therapies. Because thrombosis {{plays an important role in}} the pathogenesis of ischemic stroke, drugs that interfere with hemostasis and clot formation such as anticoagulants and platelet anti-aggregants commonly are used in the management of cerebrovascular disease. Considerable evidence supports the use of certain antithrombotic drugs in stroke prevention. However, because of limited sup-portive data, the use of these agents in patients with acute ischemic stroke remains controversial. In this report, we examine the published evidence relevant to the effects of anticoagulants and anti-platelet agents on acute ischemic stroke mortality, morbidity, and recurrence rates as well as associated <b>ancillary</b> benefits and <b>risks</b> of those treatments on the rates of deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolus, and cardiovascular complications. As part of these analy-ses, we also sought to determine whether there was evidence supporting differential efficacy of these drugs according to ischemic stroke subtypes. Methods. To prepare this report, experienced neu-rologists with a special interest in stroke diagnosis and management were appointed by the Quality Standards Subcommittee (QSS) and the Therapeu-tics and Technology Assessment (TTA) Subcommit-tee of the American Academy of Neurology, and the Stroke Council and Science Advisory and Coordinat-ing Committee (SACC) of the American Heart Asso...|$|R
40|$|BackgroundObesity {{rates in}} the United States have {{escalated}} in recent decades and present a major challenge in public health prevention efforts. Currently, testing to identify genetic risk for obesity is readily available through several direct-to-consumer companies. Despite the availability {{of this type of}} testing, there is a paucity of evidence as to whether providing people with personal genetic information on obesity risk will facilitate or impede desired behavioral responses. PurposeWe describe the key issues in the design and implementation of a randomized controlled trial examining the clinical utility of providing genetic risk information for obesity. MethodsParticipants are being recruited from the Coriell Personalized Medicine Collaborative, an ongoing, longitudinal research cohort study designed to determine the utility of personal genome information in health management and clinical decision-making. The primary focus of the <b>ancillary</b> Obesity <b>Risk</b> Communication Study is to determine whether genetic risk information added value to traditional communication efforts for obesity, which are based on lifestyle risk factors. The trial employs a 2 x 2 factorial design in order {{to examine the effects of}} providing genetic risk information for obesity, alone or in combination with lifestyle risk information, on participants 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 psychological responses, behavioral intentions, health behaviors, and weight. ResultsThe factorial design generated four experimental arms based on communication of estimated risk to participants: 1) no risk feedback (control), 2) genetic risk only, 3) lifestyle risk only, 4) both genetic and lifestyle risk (combined). Key issues in study design pertained to the selection of algorithms to estimate lifestyle risk and determination of information to be provided to participants assigned to each experimental arm to achieve a balance between clinical standards and methodological rigor. Following the launch of the trial in September 2011, implementation challenges pertaining to low enrollment and differential attrition became apparent and required immediate attention and modifications to the study protocol. Although monitoring of these efforts is ongoing, initial observations show a doubling of enrollment and reduced attrition. LimitationsThe trial is evaluating the short-term impact of providing obesity risk information as participants are followed for only 3 months. This study is built upon the structure of an existing personalized medicine study wherein participants have been provided with genetic information for other diseases. This nesting in a larger study may attenuate the effects of obesity risk information and has implications for the generalizability of study findings. ConclusionsThis randomized trial examines value of obesity genetic information, both when provided independently and when combined with lifestyle risk assessment, to motivate individuals to engage in healthy lifestyle behaviors. Study findings will guide future intervention efforts to effectively communicate genetic risk information.

40|$|Treament with oral anticoagulation {{is highly}} {{effective}} in reducing the burden of thromboembolic complications in several clinical conditions. The number of patients receiving oral anticoagulation is growing steadily. InSwedenabout 1. 5 {{percent of the population}} receives treatment. Although the treatment is highly effective in preventing thromboembolic complications, it is also associated with a substantial increase in the risk of bleeding. In clinical practice every physician has to balance the potential benefit of treatment against the risk of bleeding complications in the individual patient. To aid in this decision making, risk scores addressing the likelihood of thromboembolic events, as well as the risk of bleeding complications, have been developed. These scores are imperfect and, to some degree limited {{by the fact that the}} risk factors predictive of thromboembolic events are also often associated with bleeding complications. The addition of biomarkers has the potential to increase the predictive ability of risk scores and further enhance the net benefit of oral anticoagulant treatment in the individual patient. In this thesis several potential biomarkers for thromoboembolic and haemorrhagic complications of anticoagulant therapy have been investigated in a longitudinal cohort study of 719 patients with a median follow-up time of 4. 2 years. Thrombomodulin is a key component in the generation of activated protein C and hence, a coagulation inhibitor. Conversely, it is also a key component in the inhibition of fibrinolysis by activation of trombin-activated fibrinolysis inhibitor. In warfarin-treated patients we demonstrate that thrombomodulin predicts an increased risk of bleeding complications, but not cardiovascular events. Thus, thrombomodulin has potential as a biomarker specifically for bleeding complications. Von Willebrand factor plays a central and intricate role in the aggregation of platelets and low levels of VWF have been associated with bleeding as a manifestation of von Willebrand’s disease. In our study we noted that high levels of von Willebrand factor predict an increased risk of cardiovascular as well as all-cause mortality, possibly as an expression of endothelial dysfunction. We also noted that high levels of WVF seem to be associated with serious bleeding complications. Decreased renal function is usually measured by an increase in the levels of creatinine and cystatin C, or a decrease in the calculated glomerular filtration rate. A decrease in kidney function is regarded as a marker of an increased risk of bleeding complications. We investigated all the mentioned markers of kidney function and no association with bleeding complications became apparent. However, a clear association between a decrease in kidney function and mortality was noted. Our findings indicate that the emphasis on impaired kidney function as a risk marker needs to be shifted from bleeding complications toward thromboembolic events. Fibrinolysis is important in containing coagulation and several constituents of the fibrinolytic pathway have been shown to predict cardiovascular events and mortality. We found that fibrinolytic factors seem to predict cardiovascular events in patients with oral anticoagulation and that D-dimer also predicts bleeding complications. In conclusion, we have found several biomarkers which exhibit different predictive abilities in patients with oral anticoagulation. It is likely that biomarkers, either alone, in combination, or as <b>ancillary</b> components of <b>risk</b> scores, can contribute to improved risk stratification in patients with oral anticoagulation...|$|R
