If the main sound system is stereo, the subwoofers can also be in stereo. Otherwise, a mono subwoofer channel can be derived within the crossover from a stereo mix, depending on the crossover make and model.|$|E

2500|$|Crossovers can be passive or active. A passive {{crossover}} is an electronic circuit {{that uses a}} combination {{of one or more}} resistors, inductors, or non-polar capacitors. These components are combined to form a filter network and are most often placed between the full frequency-range power amplifier and the loudspeaker drivers to divide the amplifier's signal into the necessary frequency bands before being delivered to the individual drivers. Passive crossover circuits need no external power beyond the audio signal itself, but have some disadvantages: they may require larger inductors and capacitors due to power handling requirements (being driven by the amplifier), limited component availability to optimize the crossover's characteristics at such power levels, etc. Unlike active crossovers which include a built-in amplifier, {{passive crossover}}s have an inherent attenuation within the passband, typically leading to a reduction in damping factor before the voice coil [...] An <b>active</b> <b>crossover</b> is an electronic filter circuit that divides the signal into individual frequency bands before power amplification, thus requiring at least one power amplifier for each bandpass. Passive filtering may also be used in this way before power amplification, but it is an uncommon solution, being less flexible than active filtering. Any technique that uses crossover filtering followed by amplification is commonly known as bi-amping, tri-amping, quad-amping, and so on, depending on the minimum number of amplifier channels.|$|E
50|$|Powered {{speakers}} {{are available}} with passive or <b>active</b> <b>crossovers</b> built into them. In the 2000s, active speakers with internal <b>active</b> <b>crossovers</b> are widely seen in sound reinforcement applications and in studio monitors. Home theater and add-on domestic/automotive subwoofers have used active powered speaker technology since the late 1980s.|$|R

5000|$|Active {{crossovers}} always {{require the}} use of power amplifiers for each output band. Thus a 2-way <b>active</b> <b>crossover</b> needs two amplifiers—one each for the woofer and tweeter.

25|$|Passive {{crossovers}} {{are commonly}} installed inside speaker boxes and {{are by far}} the most usual type of crossover for home and low-power use. In car audio systems, passive crossovers may be in a separate box, necessary to accommodate the size of the components used. Passive crossovers may be simple for low-order filtering, or complex to allow steep slopes such as 18 or 24dB per octave. Passive crossovers can also be designed to compensate for undesired characteristics of driver, horn, or enclosure resonances, and can be tricky to implement, due to component interaction. Passive crossovers, like the driver units that they feed, have power handling limits, have insertion losses (10% is often claimed), and change the load seen by the amplifier. The changes are matters of concern for many in the hi-fi world. When high output levels are required, <b>active</b> <b>crossovers</b> may be preferable. <b>Active</b> <b>crossovers</b> may be simple circuits that emulate the response of a passive network, or may be more complex, allowing extensive audio adjustments. Some <b>active</b> <b>crossovers,</b> usually digital loudspeaker management systems, may include electronics and controls for precise alignment of phase and time between frequency bands, equalization, dynamic range compression and limiting) control.|$|R
25|$|An alternative, which {{provides}} good quality sound without inductors (which {{are prone to}} parasitic coupling, are expensive, and may have significant internal resistance) is to employ bi-amplification with active RC filters or active digital filters with separate power amplifiers for each loudspeaker. Such low-current and low-voltage line level <b>crossovers</b> are called <b>active</b> <b>crossovers.</b>|$|R
50|$|Digital <b>active</b> <b>crossovers</b> {{often include}} {{additional}} signal processing, such as limiting, delay, and equalization. Signal crossovers allow the audio signal to be split into bands that are processed separately {{before they are}} mixed together again. Some examples are: multiband dynamics (compression, limiting, de-essing), multiband distortion, bass enhancement, high frequency exciters, and noise reduction such as Dolby A noise reduction.|$|R

More specifically, active speakers have very short speaker cables inside the enclosure, so very little voltage and control is lost in long speaker cables with higher resistance.|$|R

50|$|It is {{commonly}} {{thought that there}} will always be a phase difference of 180° between the outputs of a (second order) low-pass filter and a high-pass filter having the same crossover frequency. And so, in a 2-way system, the high-pass section's output is usually connected to the high frequency driver 'inverted', to correct for this phase problem. For passive systems, the tweeter is wired with opposite polarity to the woofer; for <b>active</b> <b>crossovers</b> the high-pass filter's output is inverted. In 3-way systems the mid-range driver or filter is inverted. However, this is generally only true when the speakers have a wide response overlap and the acoustic centers are physically aligned.|$|R
50|$|One of {{the most}} {{striking}} trends was the growth of soft-dome monitors. These operated without horn-loaded drivers. Horns, while having advantages in transient response and efficiency, tend to be hard to listen to over long periods. The lack of distortion of high-end dome midrange & tweeters made them easy to work with all day (and night). Typical soft-dome systems were made by Roger Quested, ATC, Neil Grant and PMC and were actively driven by racks of <b>active</b> <b>crossovers</b> and amplifiers. Other monitor and studio designers like Tom Hidley, Phil Newall and Sam Toyoshima continued research into the speaker/room interface and led developments in room design, trapping, absorption and diffusion to create a consistent and neutral monitoring environment.|$|R

5000|$|Amplification: Studio {{monitors}} may be [...] "active" [...] (including {{one or more}} {{internal power}} amplifier(s)), or passive (these require an external power amplifier). Active models are usually bi-amplified, {{which means that the}} input sound signal is divided into two parts by an <b>active</b> <b>crossover</b> for low and high frequency components. Both parts are amplified using separate low- and high-frequency amplifiers, and then the low-frequency part is routed to a woofer and the high-frequency part is routed to a tweeter or horn. Bi-amplification is done so that a cleaner overall sound reproduction can be obtained, since signals are easier to process before power amplification. Consumer loudspeakers {{may or may not have}} these various design goals.|$|E
50|$|<b>Active</b> <b>crossovers</b> can be {{implemented}} digitally using a DSP chip or other microprocessor. They either use digital approximations to traditional analog circuits, known as IIR filters (Bessel, Butterworth, Linkwitz-Riley etc.), or they use Finite impulse response (FIR) filters. IIR filters have many similarities with analog filters and are relatively undemanding of CPU resources; FIR filters {{on the other hand}} usually have a higher order and therefore require more resources for similar characteristics. They can be designed and built so that they have a linear phase response, which is thought desirable by many involved in sound reproduction. There are drawbacks though—in order to achieve linear phase response, a longer delay time is incurred than would be necessary with an IIR or minimum phase FIR filters. IIR filters, which are by nature recursive have the drawback that if not carefully designed they may enter limit cycles resulting in non-linear distortion.|$|R
5000|$|A passive {{crossover}} splits up an audio signal {{after it is}} amplified by a single power amplifier, so that the amplified signal {{can be sent to}} two or more driver types, each of which represent different frequency ranges. These crossover are made entirely of passive components and circuitry; the term [...] "passive" [...] means that no additional power source is needed for the circuitry. A {{passive crossover}} just needs to be connected by wiring to the power amplifier signal. Passive crossovers are usually arranged in a Cauer topology to achieve a Butterworth filter effect. Passive filters use resistors combined with reactive components such as capacitors and inductors. Very high performance passive crossovers {{are likely to be more}} expensive than <b>active</b> <b>crossovers</b> since individual components capable of good performance at the high currents and voltages at which speaker systems are driven are hard to make.|$|R
50|$|Hybrid active designs exist such {{as having}} three drivers powered by two {{internal}} amplifiers. In this case, an <b>active</b> two-way <b>crossover</b> splits the audio signal, usually into low frequencies and mid-high frequencies.
