This eruption, which involved activity from seven distinct eruptive fissures mostly on the south slope of the volcano, was a mass-media eruption, because it occurred {{at the height of}} the tourist season and numerous reporters and journalists were already in Italy to cover the G8 summit in Genoa. It also occurred close to one of the tourist areas on the volcano, and thus was easily accessible.

The hotel had its own <b>arrival</b> <b>station</b> within the terminal, nicknamed [...] "The Kissing Room," [...] with elevator access to the lobby. A private elevator served only the Presidential Suite. The Tea Room (a.k.a. Palm Court) echoed the design of the main concourse at the Terminal.

Between the north and south towers was the Italian Garden, which overlooked Vanderbilt Avenue and Grand Central Terminal. In the winter months the garden was transformed into an ice skating rink.

It consists, first, of a departure station, a wooden building covered by rusticated boarding, having a projecting verandah, extending eight feet {{on each side of}} the carriage approaches, and extending over the railway platform. This contains a spacious first class waiting room, second class ditto, ticket, and other necessary offices, and conveniences. Immediately opposite to this, is the <b>arrival</b> <b>station,</b> which is also of wooden erection, having spacious waiting rooms, and porter and lamp rooms. The roof also projects over the platform in a similar way to that of the departure station. A short distance lower down the line is a convenient goods shed, 75 feet long by 42 feet span of roof.

They had all worked for SATA (the lift operator) or Poma (the lift builder). An expert witness at the trial claimed that the design was a poor-quality copy of a Swiss system, leading to design problems which rendered the operation of the cable car unsafe. Poma did not have much experience building this style of lift at the time and had agreed to complete the construction in ten months, compared to the two years proposed by some of its rivals, leading to claims that corners had been cut {{in the construction of the}} lift. The consulting engineer (Denis Creissels) also suggested that there was a lack of communication between the companies. On September 9, 1996, five people were charged with manslaughter at the criminal court of Grenoble; these were Jean-Pierre Cathiard (CEO of Poma), Serge Tarassof (technical director), Reylans Michel (engineer), Denis Creissels (supervisor) and Jacques Lombard (chief engineer). As part of the trial, four experts highlighted many mistakes made by Poma, most of which were based on the stabilizer, which had been copied from another company before having further issues added to its design.|$|E

We give an {{overview}} of models and efficient algorithms for optimally solving timetable information problems like “given a departure and an <b>arrival</b> <b>station</b> {{as well as a}} departure time, which is the connection that arrives as early as possible at the <b>arrival</b> <b>station?</b> ” Two main approaches that transform the problems into shortest path problems are reviewed, including issues like the modeling of realistic details (e. g., train transfers) and further optimization criteria (e. g., the number of transfers). An important topic is also multi-criteria optimization, where in general all attractive connections with respect to several criteria shall be determined. Finally, we discuss the performance of the described algorithms, which is crucial for their application in a real system. ...|$|E
