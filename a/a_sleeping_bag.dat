5|$|The station {{provided}} two permanent crew quarters, the Kayutkas, phonebox-sized booths set {{towards the}} rear of the core module, each featuring a tethered sleeping bag, a fold-out desk, a porthole, and storage for personal effects. Visiting crews had no allocated sleep module, instead attaching <b>a</b> <b>sleeping</b> <b>bag</b> to an available space on a wall; US astronauts installed themselves within Spektr until a collision with a Progress spacecraft caused the depressurisation of that module. It was important that crew accommodations be well ventilated; otherwise, astronauts could wake up oxygen-deprived and gasping for air, because a bubble of their own exhaled carbon dioxide had formed around their heads.|$|E

He also had a block fitted beneath the accelerator, so as to avoid over-stretching the Achilles tendon.|$|E
25|$|On August 4, a {{fire was}} {{reported}} at DiMaggio's house in Boulevard, where firemen found {{the bodies of}} Anderson's mother, Christina, her eight-year-old brother Ethan, and the family dog Cali. Christina Anderson died of blunt force trauma, {{believed to have been}} caused by a crowbar. She was apparently tortured, and her body covered with a tarp. Cali was shot dead and covered with <b>a</b> <b>sleeping</b> <b>bag.</b> An arrest warrant was issued for DiMaggio.|$|E
50|$|Each {{astronaut}} had <b>a</b> private <b>sleeping</b> {{area the}} size of a small walk-in closet, with <b>a</b> curtain, <b>sleeping</b> <b>bag,</b> and locker. Designers also added a shower and a toilet; the latter was both for comfort and to obtain precise urine and feces samples for examination on Earth.|$|R
2500|$|Following the {{departure}} of MC Tee, rapper Bryce [...] "Luvah" [...] Wilson and Mantronik's cousin, D.J. D., joined the group. Mantronik met Wilson, <b>a</b> fellow <b>Sleeping</b> <b>Bag</b> Records label mate, while doing production work for Wilson's aborted solo project.|$|R
50|$|Muma {{disassembled}} {{an older}} Motobecane for spare parts {{to bring on}} his trip. He also brought approximately 50 pounds of gear, including <b>a</b> tent, <b>sleeping</b> <b>bag,</b> clothing, tools, food and water, spare fuel cans, and oil to mix with the fuel.|$|R
25|$|Muffling {{the bass}} can be {{achieved}} with the same muffling techniques as the snare, but bass drums in a drum kit are more commonly muffled by adding pillows, <b>a</b> <b>sleeping</b> <b>bag</b> or another soft filling inside the drum, between the heads. Cutting a small hole in the resonant head can also produce a more muffled tone, and allows manipulation in internally placed muffling. The Evans EQ pad places a pad against the batterhead and, when struck, the pad moves off the head momentarily, then returns to rest against the head, thus reducing the sustain without choking the tone.|$|E
25|$|Upon moving, Genie's father {{increasingly}} confined Genie to {{the second}} bedroom {{in the back of}} the house while the rest of the family slept in the living room. During the daytime, for approximately 13 hours Genie's father tied her to a child's toilet in a makeshift harness designed to function as a straitjacket. While in the harness, she wore only diapers and could only move her extremities. At night he usually tied her into <b>a</b> <b>sleeping</b> <b>bag</b> and placed her in a crib with a metal-screen cover, keeping her arms and legs immobilized, and researchers believed that he sometimes left her on the child's toilet overnight.|$|E
25|$|During {{this time}} period, Jobs and Brennan both became {{practitioners}} of Zen Buddhism through the Zen master Kōbun Chino Otogawa. Jobs {{was living with}} his parents again, in their backyard toolshed which he had converted into a bedroom with <b>a</b> <b>sleeping</b> <b>bag,</b> mat, books, a candle, and a meditation pillow. Jobs engaged in lengthy meditation retreats at the Tassajara Zen Mountain Center, the oldest Sōtō Zen monastery in the US. He considered taking up monastic residence at Eihei-ji in Japan, and maintained a lifelong appreciation for Zen. Jobs would later say that people around him who did not share his countercultural roots could not fully relate to his thinking.|$|E
50|$|<b>A</b> <b>sleeping</b> <b>bag's</b> rating {{typically}} {{indicates the}} lowest temperature {{at which it}} will keep the average sleeper warm. For example, with a 0° bag, a person {{should be able to}} sleep in 0° temperature, but not necessarily comfortably.There is no standard measurement rating in the U.S., so a 20° bag from one company may not provide the same warmth as a 20° from another company. Other important variables include what the user plans to wear while sleeping, what type of sleeping pad is used, and how well the user holds heat in the bag.|$|R

25|$|At 1800 {{hours that}} same day, {{artillery}} bombardment {{of the enemy}} positions on Point 4875 commenced, and continued non-stop, throughout the whole night. 155 mm Bofors Howitzers, 105 mm Field Guns, and multi barrel rocket launchers {{were used in the}} bombardment of Point 4875. At 2030 hours in the pitch black night, under cover of artillery fire, 'A' and 'C' Companies began climbing the Point 4875. Captain Vikram Batra was lying in <b>a</b> <b>sleeping</b> <b>bag</b> in a tent on the rocky ground near the Mushkoh nullah, and was down with fever and fatigue. His commanding officer had ordered him to rest even though his battalion, 13 JAK Rifles, had launched its attack on the Point 4875.|$|E
25|$|On July 13, 1991, Bruce Hamill {{went to a}} {{hardware}} store, bought a plumber's wrench, hatchet, knives and <b>a</b> <b>sleeping</b> <b>bag,</b> {{then went to the}} Brockville hospital and signed out Krueger on his first publicly escorted day pass. During the first hour of his first weekend pass (unsupervised release) in 34 years, Krueger arranged to meet Dennis Kerr in the woods near Brockville where Krueger would loan Kerr five hundred dollars. When Dennis Kerr arrived as instructed, Krueger struck him in the head with the pipe wrench and continued to beat him into unconsciousness. Krueger and Hamill then seized the hatchet and knife they had hidden in the bushes while waiting for Kerr's arrival and hacked and stabbed Kerr, mutilating his body, cutting it open, and nearly severing his head. Drenched in Kerr's blood, they then stripped themselves naked and sodomized the corpse. Krueger then left the scene, walked to a police station about two miles away, and turned himself in.|$|E
25|$|The station {{provides}} crew {{quarters for}} {{each member of}} the expedition's crew, with two 'sleep stations' in the Zvezda and four more installed in Harmony. The American quarters are private, approximately person-sized soundproof booths. The Russian crew quarters include a small window, but provide less ventilation and sound proofing. A crew member can sleep in a crew quarter in a tethered sleeping bag, listen to music, use a laptop, and store personal items in a large drawer or in nets attached to the module's walls. The module also provides a reading lamp, a shelf and a desktop. Visiting crews have no allocated sleep module, and attach <b>a</b> <b>sleeping</b> <b>bag</b> to an available space on a wall. It is possible to sleep floating freely through the station, but this is generally avoided because of the possibility of bumping into sensitive equipment. It is important that crew accommodations be well ventilated; otherwise, astronauts can wake up oxygen-deprived and gasping for air, because a bubble of their own exhaled carbon dioxide has formed around their heads.|$|E

500|$|The fast-paced, two-chord blues song [...] "Tombstone Blues", {{driven by}} Michael Bloomfield's lead guitar, uses {{a parade of}} {{historical}} characters—outlaw Belle Starr, biblical temptress Delilah, Jack the Ripper (represented in this song as a successful businessman), John the Baptist (described here as a torturer), and blues singer Ma Rainey who Dylan humorously suggests shared <b>a</b> <b>sleeping</b> <b>bag</b> with composer Beethoven—to sketch an absurdist account of contemporary America. For critics Mark Polizzotti and Andy Gill, the reality [...] behind the song is the then-escalating Vietnam War; both writers hear the [...] "king of the Philistines" [...] who sends his slaves [...] "out to the jungle" [...] as a reference to President Lyndon B. Johnson.|$|E
500|$|Other {{violations}} involved detainee abuse. [...] An August 2003 memo on detainee interrogations prompted {{one soldier}} with the 3rd ACR in Anbar to reply that [...] "the gloves {{need to come}} off." [...] In November 2003, former Iraqi general Abed Hamed Mowhoush died at a detention facility near Al Qaim after US Army interrogators stuffed him inside <b>a</b> <b>sleeping</b> <b>bag</b> and beat him to death. [...] In 2005, {{several members of the}} 82nd Airborne described how in 2003 they beat and abused prisoners at Camp Mercury, a forward operating base near Fallujah. Iraqi security forces also committed abuses. In 2007, a Marine commander near Tharthar uncovered several instances of Iraqi soldiers raping civilians and Iraqi police torturing prisoners.|$|E
500|$|... 11 participants, {{who were}} not {{initially}} informed of their task, must live on a purpose-made rubbish dump adjacent to a working landfill site for 21 days after being left equipped only with <b>a</b> <b>sleeping</b> <b>bag,</b> drinking can and one roll of lavatory paper each. However, food was delivered to the landfill on a weekly basis. A prize fund of £20,000 was shared equally between those who participated for the entire three weeks. Rob Holdway, director of environmental consultancy Giraffe Innovation, presented the programme and set the contestants regular challenges. The participants had to wear Kevlar gloves, protective boots and face masks when working on the real landfill site. Every person working on the programme was given tetanus, polio and hepatitis vaccinations for their safety.|$|E

Generally sleepsacks are very tight on the body, adding to the bondage aspect of the experience.|$|R
