6000|$|I {{crossed the}} room, and, drawing the blind aside carefully, looked out. The street {{was packed with}} people! Even <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>stood</b> <b>there,</b> I heard the crash of {{breaking}} glass below! ...|$|E
6000|$|And that calm eve {{when you}} walked up the stair, After a gaiety {{prolonged}} and rare, [...] No thought soever [...] That you might never Walk down again, struck me <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>stood</b> <b>there.</b>|$|E
60|$|He cowered {{before my}} furious wrath; for I {{must have seemed}} terrific <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>stood</b> thundering <b>there,</b> my face wild, my eyes bloodshot, half mad from pain and rage and sleeplessness.|$|R
6000|$|I grew scornfuller, grew colder, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>stood</b> up <b>there</b> among them, [...] Till as frost intense {{will burn}} you, the cold scorning {{scorched}} my [...] brow; [...] When a sudden silver speaking, gravely cadenced, over-rung them, [...] And a sudden silken stirring touched my inner nature through.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is {{a little}} box of a place this, Mr. Haw," [...] said old McIntyre. [...] "I should think you must feel quite stifled in it after your grand mansion, of which my son tells me such wonders. But we were not always {{accustomed}} {{to this sort of}} thing, Mr. Haw. Humble <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>stand</b> here, <b>there</b> was a time, and not so long ago, when <b>I</b> could write <b>as</b> many figures on a cheque as any gunmaker in Birmingham. It was--" ...|$|R
60|$|I {{took a step}} forward, {{but before}} I could gain the threshold, the door was slammed in my face, and <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>stood</b> <b>there,</b> quivering with anger and disappointment, I heard the bolts being shot within.|$|E
6000|$|She drew away obediently, {{and then}} I thought, What if she cannot find the steps? I started after her, {{to stop at}} the foot of the companion-way. Perhaps she had gone up. <b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>stood</b> <b>there,</b> hesitant, I heard her cry softly: ...|$|E
60|$|The {{swiftness}} of {{his movements}} and the malignity of his gesture were in such singular contrast with his appearance that I was struck speechless with surprise. But <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> {{with the door}} {{in front of me}} I was a witness to something which filled me with even greater astonishment.|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course I {{told him}} it was <b>I,</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>stood</b> right out <b>there</b> for all hands to see, and if it hadn't been for making trouble when it didn't seem to be {{necessary}} I'd {{have something to say about}} the president of such a club as ours asking questions when he knew full well what the answers were.|$|R
6000|$|I {{leave them}} soon, {{and make my}} way up the stone steps to the [...] "corn chamber," [...] where tranquillity is crowned. In the {{whitewashed}} room the corn lies in drifts and ridges, three to four feet deep, all silvery-dun, like some remote sand desert, lifeless beneath the moon. Here it lies, and into it, staggering under the sacks, George-the-Gaul and Jim-the-Early Saxon tramp up to their knees, spill the sacks over their heads, and out again; and above where their feet have plunged the patient surface closes again, smooth. And <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>stand</b> <b>there</b> in the doorway, looking at that silvery corn drift, I think of the whole process, from seed sown to the last sieving into this tranquil resting-place. I think of the slow, dogged ploughman, with the crows above him on the wind; of the swing of the sower's arm, dark up against grey sky on the steep field. I think of the seed snug-burrowing for safety, and its mysterious ferment under the warm Spring rain, of the soft green shoots tapering up so shyly toward the first sun, and hardening in air to thin wiry stalk. I think of the unnumerable tiny beasts that have jangled in that pale forest; of the winged blue jewels of butterfly risen from it to hover on the wild-rustling blades; of that continual music played there by the wind; of the chicory and poppy flowers that have been its lights-o' love, as it grew tawny and full of life, before the appointed date when it should return to its captivity. I think of that slow-travelling hum and swish which laid it low, of the gathering to stack, and the long waiting under the rustle and drip of the sheltering trees, until yesterday the hoot of the thresher blew, and there began the falling into this dun silvery peace. Here it will lie with the pale sun narrowly filtering in on it, and by night the pale moon, till slowly, week by week, it is stolen away, and its ridges and drifts sink and sink, and the beasts have eaten it all....|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{have thought}} since how {{particularly}} ill-equipped I was {{for such an}} experience. When I had started with the Time Machine, I had started with the absurd assumption that {{the men of the}} Future would certainly be infinitely ahead of ourselves in all their appliances. I had come without arms, without medicine, without anything to smoke--at times I missed tobacco frightfully--even without enough matches. If only I had thought of a Kodak! I could have flashed that glimpse of the Underworld in a second, and examined it at leisure. But, <b>as</b> it was, <b>I</b> <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> with only the weapons and the powers that Nature had endowed me with--hands, feet, and teeth; these, and four safety-matches that still remained to me.|$|R
60|$|And then at that instant, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>stood</b> <b>there,</b> it was {{suddenly}} driven {{home to me}} how poor and purposeless a life I should lead while this crippled friend of ours and the companion of my boyhood were away {{in the forefront of}} the storm. Quick as a flash my resolution was taken.|$|E
60|$|Outside, {{the fresh}} morning wind came like a sudden sweet tonic to my jaded nerves. I {{paused for a}} moment to face bareheaded the rush of it from the sea. <b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>stood</b> <b>there,</b> {{drinking}} it in, I became suddenly aware of light approaching footsteps. Some one was coming towards the cottage from the Park.|$|E
60|$|What a hoarse, clanging sound! I shivered <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> {{listening}} to its gloomy echoes until they died away. No one came. The place seemed wrapped in an austere silence. I listened, but I could hear no sound within; only the dull, melancholy sighing {{of the wind}} amongst a sickly avenue of firs behind.|$|E
60|$|Meanwhile {{the sailors}} progressed rapidly {{with the task}} of unshipping the {{packages}} and caged animals. A large launch, with two standing lugs, lay under the lea of the schooner; and into this the strange assortment of goods were swung. I did not then see the hands from the island that were receiving the packages, for the hull of the launch was hidden from me {{by the side of the}} schooner. Neither Montgomery nor his companion took the slightest notice of me, but busied themselves in assisting and directing the four or five sailors who were unloading the goods. The captain went forward interfering rather than assisting. I was alternately despairful and desperate. Once or twice <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>stood</b> waiting <b>there</b> for things to accomplish themselves, I could not resist an impulse to laugh at my miserable quandary. I felt all the wretcheder for the lack of a breakfast. Hunger and a lack of blood-corpuscles take all the manhood from a man. I perceived pretty clearly that I had not the stamina either to resist what the captain chose to do to expel me, or to force myself upon Montgomery and his companion. So I waited passively upon fate; and the work of transferring Montgomery's possessions to the launch went on <b>as</b> if <b>I</b> did not exist.|$|R
5000|$|... "Deep {{into that}} {{darkness}} peering, long <b>I</b> <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> wondering, fearing, ...|$|R
60|$|In {{helpless}} terror <b>I</b> <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> forgetting weapon, fearing {{only the}} beast would fall over on me.|$|R
60|$|And <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> stupid, and perplexed, {{with this}} dumbfounding relic in my hand, {{something}} very soft {{and light and}} chill touched my hand {{for a moment and}} ceased to be, and then a thing, a little white speck, drifted athwart a shadow. It was a tiny snowflake, the first snowflake, the herald of the night.|$|E
6000|$|... "I myself, I {{scarcely}} know," [...] he answered, as {{he sipped}} the brandy which Grooton had produced. [...] "I am subject to fits of giddiness, and one {{came over me}} <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> looking down. I felt the ground sway, and remember no more. I am very sorry to give you tall this trouble, but indeed I fear that I cannot walk." ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> watching, knowing {{well that}} I saw the {{dissolution}} of a school of patriotism that held sway over my youth, Synge came and stood beside me, and said, 'A young doctor has just {{told me that he}} can hardly keep himself from jumping on to a seat, and pointing out in that howling mob those whom he is treating for venereal disease.' ...|$|E
60|$|For a time <b>I</b> <b>stood</b> <b>there,</b> too {{overwhelmed}} by this new development {{to think of}} the people.|$|R
60|$|What had {{happened}} to Cavor? All through that tolling <b>I</b> <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> stupidly, and at last the tolling ceased.|$|R
60|$|I {{shook my}} head. Every symptom of fatal relapse. I {{could not imagine}} what card Hilda held in reserve. But <b>I</b> <b>stood</b> <b>there,</b> waiting.|$|R
6000|$|... "For {{an instant}} I {{was on the}} point of rushing in. The door had been opened to admit the men and their burden. It was the woman who had opened it. But <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> she caught a glimpse of me, and I think that she {{recognized}} me. I saw her start, and she hastily closed the door. I remembered my promise to you, and here I am." ...|$|E
60|$|I thought I should ha' gorn out o' my mind. It {{was just}} a little tinkle at first, then another tinkle, but, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> all in the dark and cold trying to make up my mind to take no notice of it, it began to ring like mad. I 'ad to go--I've known men climb over the gate afore now--and I didn't want to be caught in that dock.|$|E
60|$|There I stopped, panting, in the shadow, and, my hand {{pressed to}} my side, I tried to collect my {{scattered}} senses and to plan out what I should do. <b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>stood</b> <b>there,</b> breathless, the great brass bells roared twice above my head. It was two o'clock. Four was the hour when the storming-party {{would be in}} its place. I had still two hours in which to act.|$|E
60|$|Going to {{the corner}} cupboard, in which Mrs Willis kept her little store of food and physic, <b>I</b> <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> pondering what <b>I</b> should do.|$|R
60|$|For {{an instant}} <b>I</b> <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> {{watching}} with Dian at my side. Then, to my utter amazement, I saw Juag {{rise to the}} surface and swim strongly toward the boat.|$|R

60|$|All this {{passed through}} my mind {{in a few seconds}} <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> with the candle in my hand, feeling indeed half dead, and yet with my mind painfully alive. I began to wonder if I had gone asleep, and was the victim of a nightmare. No such thing. I wish it had only been a nightmare. A mouse ran out along the dresser and jumped on to the floor, making quite a crash in the silence.|$|E
60|$|I have {{repeatedly}} {{said that the}} sea makes one hard. I now realized how hard I had become <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> at the break of the poop in my wind- shipped, spray-soaked pyjamas. I felt no solicitude for the forecastle humans who struggled in peril of their lives beneath me. They did not count. Ah--I was even curious to see what might happen, did they get caught by those crashing avalanches of sea ere they could gain {{the safety of the}} fife-rail.|$|E
60|$|Ah, what {{thoughts}} {{passed through}} my mind in those brief moments <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> in rapt fascination! I had come to find a wondrous civilization, and instead I found a wild-beast monarch of the realm where English kings had ruled. A lion reigned, undisturbed, within {{a few miles of}} the seat of one of the greatest governments the world has ever known, his domain a howling wilderness, where yesterday fell the shadows of the largest city in the world.|$|E
6000|$|It was {{mother who}} flung the shutter into place softly and {{replaced}} the bars, and <b>I</b> <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> like a stupid until {{the house was}} barricaded once more, when I said stupidly: ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> {{staring at}} those {{beautiful}} blind {{eyes and the}} blind eyes stared back at me. Presently a look of understanding gathered on the face and Quilla spoke, or rather murmured to herself.|$|R
