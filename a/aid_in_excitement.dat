50|$|Once {{the medium}} spiny neurons receive {{sufficient}} excitatory cortical input, they are excited and fire {{a burst of}} inhibitory action potentials to globus pallidus neurons. These tonically active neurons are then inhibited, causing their inhibitory influence on SNr and VTh to decline. Thus SNr and VTh neurons are disinhibited resulting <b>in</b> net <b>excitement</b> causing them to activate upper motor neurons commanding a movement. Cortical activation of the basal ganglia thus eventually results <b>in</b> <b>excitement</b> (disinhibition) of motor neurons causing movement to take place.|$|R
