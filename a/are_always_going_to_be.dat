500|$|In 2008, Corey Taylor {{commented on}} a {{slashing}} incident at a South African school to which Slipknot was linked; he said: ...obviously, I'm {{disturbed by the}} fact that people were hurt and someone died, as far as my responsibility for that goes, it stops there, because I know our message is actually very positive...there <b>are</b> <b>always</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> mental disorders and people who cause violence {{for no other reason than}} the fact that they're fucked up and lost.|$|E
500|$|According to Rolling Stone, {{the album}} {{contains}} [...] "raspy braggadocio and sexy rhymes" [...] which complement Queen's raspy vocals. It alternates between reggaetón and hip hop as Queen experiments with Caribbean music, R, pop, electronica, funk, dancehall and acoustic ballads: [...] "I really think this album {{is for people}} to really just sit down and listen to it". She explained that [...] "there are times that the songs will {{make you want to}} dance", but their lyrics are more meaningful. Although Queen said the album has its share of [...] "battles against men", she wants it to demonstrate that she is a well–rounded artist. Describing the songs, she said [...] " [...] <b>are</b> <b>always</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> real because they are feelings that people have...The hits that I have now, the girls love them because they are real. If I am feeling hurt and need to curse to express that, then I will. I am going to be real all the way because that's what made Ivy Queen".|$|E

Furthermore, describing the album: [...] " [...] <b>are</b> <b>always</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> real because they are feelings that people have," [...] she asserts. [...] "The hits that I have now, the girls love them because they are real. If I am feeling hurt and need to curse to express that, then I will.

[...] This is prominent on [...] "Chika Ideal", where she assures the protagonists' lover that she wants to be with him and fulfill his fantasies.|$|E
5000|$|Weaving said of {{the film}} series in 2003 that it <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a trilogy, and that as Neo's nemesis, Smith <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> there, {{describing}} Smith as [...] "more of a free agent" [...] {{later on in the}} series.|$|R

500|$|Several reviewers have {{commented on}} {{themes of the}} episode; topics of {{discussion}} included the relationship between parents and children, class relations, the scene in which Logan attacks the perpetrator in Veronica's sex tape case, and the final scene {{in relation to the}} overall moral of the series. According to Rowan Kaiser of The A.V. Club, the episode contained a role reversal between Veronica and Keith, with Keith violating the law. He noted the scene in which Keith erases the surveillance tapes of Veronica as illustrating the theme that [...] "the two aren't so different after all." [...] Roger Holland of PopMatters thought that the episode demonstrated that Veronica and Keith's relationship was the central component of the show: [...] "it was all about Veronica and Keith. And beyond that, about parents, children, and the myriad ways they can fuck each other up." [...] Stephanie Zacharek, writing for Salon, thought that the final scenes of [...] "The Bitch Is Back" [...] "cement the dour reality, posited {{at the very beginning of}} the series, that the rich ... <b>are</b> <b>always</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the ones in charge." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{title of}} the album, The Hunting Party, is a contextual metaphor. The album, {{a return to the}} band's {{original}} harder rock-centric sounds, represents the band's desire to not only create something different from other rock bands, but to also bring back the [...] "energy and soul" [...] of rock itself, and that Linkin Park are the party that will hunt for that energy and soul. Shinoda elaborated on the {{title of the}} album in an interview with Kerrang! explaining: [...] "We got so sick of other bands trying to be other bands and playing it safe the whole time, so the album name comes from a theory about culture becoming too passive, everyone just standing around waiting for opportunities to come to them instead of going out and getting theirs. I'm aware there <b>are</b> <b>always</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> heavier bands than us, but The Hunting Party is Linkin Park going out and getting it for ourselves." [...] The inspiration for the title came from a news article Shinoda read online about a Japanese writer's concerns about today's growing society. The writer described the young men of today as [...] "herbivores", and explained how they are essentially grazing, waiting for an opportunity to come to them, rather than hunting for it.|$|E
2500|$|James Morgan Pryse was an esoteric gnostic who saw Revelation as {{a western}} {{version of the}} Hindu theory of the Chakra. He began his work, [...] "The purpose of this book {{is to show that}} the Apocalypse is a manual of spiritual {{development}} and not, as conventionally interpreted, a cryptic history or prophecy." [...] Such diverse theories have failed to command widespread acceptance. But Christopher Rowland argues: [...] "there <b>are</b> <b>always</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> loose threads which refuse to be woven into the fabric as a whole. The presence of the threads which stubbornly refuse to be incorporated into the neat tapestry of our world-view does not usually totally undermine that view." ...|$|E

500|$|Scott motivates {{himself for}} games by {{channeling}} the anger at his father's abandonment. He said, [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>always</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have anger {{because of how}} he did me. It <b>is</b> <b>always</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> there. It is not going away. No way at all." [...] While basketball player Michael Jordan was Scott's childhood sports idol, he says Jordan was not the inspiration for his jersey number of 23. Scott chose it as a combination of his older brothers' high school numbers: James wore number 20, and Lee, Jr. wore number 3. Scott said, [...] "They were my father." ...|$|R
2500|$|... "Einstein" [...] {{was defined}} as a [...] "bratty kiss-off", on which [...] "she does the math for a no-good boyfriend." [...] The line, [...] "I may not be Einstein, but I know dumb plus dumb equals you", was largely criticized by music critics. [...] "Standing in Front of You" [...] was {{considered}} a [...] "poetic ballad about imploring a gun-shy guy to take the plunge and commit." [...] The eighth track, the pop punk [...] "I Forgive You", talks about forgiveness and was seen as [...] "a heartfelt postscript to the guy who left her in 'Since U Been Gone'." [...] "Hello" [...] is an uptempo [...] "rugged" [...] track that [...] "finds its groove in the chorus [...] handclaps on the bridge." [...] "The War Is Over" [...] was considered a [...] "post-breakup song" [...] with [...] "pummeling" [...] drums, while [...] "Let Me Down" [...] has Clarkson being [...] "'dumb enough to linger' with a bad boy." [...] "You Can't Win", a punch-guitar song, [...] "reflects on the reality that there <b>are</b> <b>always</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> critics, no matter what you say or do. It strives to encourage 'the one who doesn't quite fit in' not to internalize criticism too deeply." [...] The closing track on the standard edition, [...] "Breaking Your Own Heart," [...] was named an [...] "acoustic country" [...] song.|$|E
2500|$|As Birds of Prey {{approached}} its hundredth issue, Simone used issues #99 and #100 {{to shake}} up the lineup. She let Black Canary leave the team with her ward, a little girl called [...] "Sin", and used a prison break arc to introduce superhumanly strong Big Barda, pacifist Judomaster and rascally Misfit into the new squad, and with the new Spy Smasher as an ambiguous Jack Bauer-like anti-heroine and Lois Lane cornering Oracle into almost giving away her secret identity. Again, the characters were chosen to provide a foil for each other, and affirmed her love for her characters: [...] "The team {{is a group of}} individuals, quite unlike the friendship between Dinah, Helena and Babs. And any team with Barda on it automatically has a certain bull in a China shop tremble, and I love that... The characters don't apologize for being asskickers, nor for being smart, nor for being sexy, nor for being sexual, for that matter. There <b>are</b> <b>always</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> some people who find that not to their taste, but at the same time, Birds of Prey regularly brings in people who don't otherwise read mainstream comics, a whole audience that may not pick up any other superhero titles, and I love that niche, that little area between good taste and utter shamelessness." [...] Finally, Simone stated her agony of leaving the book: [...] "I miss the characters in all the books I've worked on. Writing the last issue of Birds of Prey I'm doing was actually physically painful." ...|$|E

5000|$|Craft beers {{were not}} unknown in China at that time. Brewpubs {{were already in}} {{operation}} in Shanghai and Hong Kong. In Beijing itself, {{there had been some}} brewpubs and German-style beer halls operated by Munich-based Paulaner Brewery since the early 1990s that catered both to expatriates and to Chinese made prosperous by free-market economic reforms that began at the time. But there was nothing like the craft breweries that had sprung up in the U.S. since the 1980s, [...] "places where you knew the service <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> great, where the stuff <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> on draft," [...] Setzer said later.|$|R

50|$|Although {{the theory}} of {{principal}} bundles {{plays an important role}} in the study of G-structures, the two notions are different. A G-structure is a principal subbundle of the tangent frame bundle, but the fact that the G-structure bundle consists of tangent frames is regarded as part of the data. For example, consider two Riemannian metrics on Rn. The associated O(n)-structures are isomorphic if and only if the metrics are isometric. But, since Rn is contractible, the underlying O(n)-bundles <b>are</b> <b>always</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> isomorphic as principal bundles because the only bundles over contractible spaces are trivial bundles.|$|E
50|$|Humans also {{interact}} with their environments based on their sensory capabilities. The fields of human perception systems, like perceptual psychology and cognitive psychology, are not exact sciences, because human information processing is not a purely physical act, and because perception is affected by cultural factors, personal preferences, experiences, and expectations. So human scale in architecture can also describe buildings with sightlines, acoustic properties, task lighting, ambient lighting, and spatial grammar that fit well with human senses. However, one important caveat is that human perceptions <b>are</b> <b>always</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> less predictable and less measurable than physical dimensions.|$|E
