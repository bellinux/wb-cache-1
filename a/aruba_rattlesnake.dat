The DZS provides financial support to the <b>Aruba</b> Island <b>Rattlesnake</b> SSP to help restore habitat on Aruba, {{and as part of}} the SSP, <b>Aruba</b> <b>rattlesnakes</b> are often housed at the HRCC.|$|R

The zoo also participates in 14 AZA Species Survival Plans (SSP), including those for the cheetah, ruffed lemur, <b>Aruba</b> Island <b>rattlesnake,</b> guenon, spider monkey, cotton-top tamarin, rock iguana, and clouded leopard.|$|R

50|$|This {{species is}} {{classified}} as critically endangered (CR) on the IUCN Red List for the following criteria: C2b (v2.3, 1994). This means that the population is estimated to number less than 250 mature individuals, a continuing decline has been observed, projected, or inferred, {{in the number of}} mature individuals, and that the population structure is such that all individuals are in a single subpopulation. Year assessed: 1996.These snakes are found only on the island of Aruba, where they are mostly limited to the rocky, dry southern tip of the island. Due to their extremely limited geographic range, about 230 animals left in the wild, and the ever encroaching human habitation into their territory (there is only about 25 square kilometers left undeveloped), the <b>Aruba</b> Island <b>rattlesnake</b> is among the rarest rattlesnakes in the world and listed as critically endangered. Unfortunately, while exporting from the island is illegal, it has no other legal protection on the island either. The snake is now a part of the Species Survival Plan for captive breeding.|$|R
