5|$|Germanium's {{abundance}} in the Earth's crust is approximately 1.6ppm. Only a few minerals like argyrodite, briartite, germanite, and renierite contain appreciable amounts of germanium, and none in mineable deposits. Some zinc-copper-lead ore bodies contain enough germanium to justify extraction {{from the final}} ore concentrate. An unusual natural enrichment process causes <b>a</b> <b>high</b> <b>content</b> of germanium in some coal seams, discovered by Victor Moritz Goldschmidt during a broad survey for germanium deposits. The highest concentration ever found was in Hartley coal ash with as much as 1.6% germanium. The coal deposits near Xilinhaote, Inner Mongolia, contain an estimated 1600tonnes of germanium.|$|E

25|$|Nitric acid, after {{distillation}} {{to increase}} the acid strength, is capable of dissolving the silver {{but it will not}} (by itself) dissolve the gold. However, nitric acid is not able to (fully) extract silver and other impurities from an alloy with <b>a</b> <b>high</b> <b>content</b> of gold. Therefore, one part of scrap gold was typically alloyed with three parts of copper (quartering) before parting with nitric acid. Another method uses Sterling silver instead of copper. One part pure gold is alloyed with three parts Sterling silver (inquarting). The resulting six karat (6K) gold can then be parted with dilute nitric acid (one part 68-70% nitric acid to one part DISTILLED water). With the karat gold this low (6K), and over medium high heat, the dilute nitric acid will dissolve the Sterling silver (and other base metals in the karat gold) starting on the outside surface of the 6K gold alloy, working its way into the gold alloy, forming a honeycomb structure as it works its way into the metals. Since nitric acid will not dissolve gold, nearly pure gold (very close to 99.5% pure) will be left behind after the reaction is complete. After removing the solid gold other elements like silver and copper may be extracted from the liquid. To get the gold to a very high level of purity (999 fine gold) it is sometimes processed further with aqua regia to effectively remove all the impurities.|$|E

Anecdotal evidence suggests that sensory variations among these wines may have to do with their phenolic composition and concentration. Therefore the aim of this work was to study the effects of different winemaking conditions typically used in Chile on the phenolic composition and concentration of Sauvignon blanc wines. RESULTS: The use of an inert gas (CO 2) in winemaking produced differences in the proportion of proanthocyanidin fractions. <b>A</b> <b>higher</b> concentration of flavan- 3 -ol monomers resulted from winemaking in the presence of inert gas.
