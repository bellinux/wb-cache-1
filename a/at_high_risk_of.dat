5|$|A gas {{explosion}} {{in a residential}} area of Rosario, the third-largest city in Argentina, occurred on August 6, 2013. It {{was caused by a}} large gas leak; a nearby building collapsed, and others were <b>at</b> <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> structural failure. Twenty-two people died, and sixty were injured. Several organizations helped secure the area, search for survivors and aid people who lost their homes. Shortly after the explosion, the time needed for reconstruction was estimated at six months.|$|E
5|$|Those <b>at</b> <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> {{infection}} {{should be}} tested as there is effective treatment {{for those who have}} the disease. Groups that screening is recommended for include those who have not been vaccinated and one of the following: people from areas of the world where hepatitis B occurs in more than 2%, those with HIV, intravenous drug users, {{men who have sex with}} men, and those who live with someone with hepatitis B.|$|E
5|$|Cholangiocarcinoma is {{definitively}} diagnosed from tissue, i.e. it {{is proven}} by biopsy or examination of the tissue excised at surgery. It may be suspected in a patient with obstructive jaundice. Considering it as the working diagnosis may be challenging in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC); such patients are <b>at</b> <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> developing cholangiocarcinoma, but the symptoms {{may be difficult to}} distinguish from those of PSC. Furthermore, in patients with PSC, such diagnostic clues as a visible mass on imaging or biliary ductal dilatation may not be evident.|$|E
30|$|Men with a gr/gr partial {{deletion}} were <b>at</b> <b>higher</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> having hypospermatogenesis or maturation arrest.

5|$|Rovelizumab, trade-named LeukArrest {{and also}} known as Hu23F2G, was {{developed}} to treat patients suffering from hemorrhagic shock, which is caused by massive blood loss. The drug is a monoclonal antibody that inhibits the recruitment of white blood cells {{to the site of}} inflammation. During testing, few patients were given the drug, because LeukArrest had to be administered within four hours of the injury and informed consent was required; patients were often unconscious, and relatives had to be reached to give consent. In June1998, Icos and many medical centers asked the FDA to waive consent requirements in situations where the patient was <b>at</b> <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> dying and relatives could not be reached. While some medical ethicists opposed waiving consent, the FDA approved the proposal in August1998 for five medical centers. Development of LeukArrest was halted in April2000 when interim data from phaseIII clinical trials did not meet Icos's goals of significantly reducing the chance of multiple organ failure and reducing the death rate from shock at 28days. LeukArrest was also tested unsuccessfully for treatment of heart attack, multiple sclerosis, and stroke.|$|E
5|$|The {{specific}} type of postremission therapy is individualized based on a person's prognostic factors (see above) and general health. For good-prognosis leukemias (i.e. inv(16), t(8;21), and t(15;17)), people will typically undergo an additional three to five courses of intensive chemotherapy, known as consolidation chemotherapy. For people <b>at</b> <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> relapse (e.g. those with high-risk cytogenetics, underlying MDS, or therapy-related AML), allogeneic stem cell transplantation is usually recommended {{if the person is}} able to tolerate a transplant and has a suitable donor. The best postremission therapy for intermediate-risk AML (normal cytogenetics or cytogenetic changes not falling into good-risk or high-risk groups) is less clear and depends on the specific situation, including the age and overall health of the person, the person's values, and whether a suitable stem cell donor is available.|$|E
5|$|Transvaginal {{ultrasound}} {{to examine}} the endometrial thickness in women with postmenopausal bleeding is increasingly being used {{to aid in the}} diagnosis of endometrial cancer in the United States. In the United Kingdom, both an endometrial biopsy and a transvaginal ultrasound used in conjunction are the standard of care for diagnosing endometrial cancer. The homogeneity of the tissue visible on transvaginal ultrasound can help to indicate whether the thickness is cancerous. Ultrasound findings alone are not conclusive in cases of endometrial cancer, so another screening method (for example endometrial biopsy) must be used in conjunction. Other imaging studies are of limited use. CT scans are used for preoperative imaging of tumors that appear advanced on physical exam or have a high-risk subtype (<b>at</b> <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> metastasis). They {{can also be used to}} investigate extrapelvic disease. An MRI can be of some use in determining if the cancer has spread to the cervix or if it is an endocervical adenocarcinoma. MRI is also useful for examining the nearby lymph nodes.|$|E

30|$|There was a {{significant}} difference in testicular histology by AZFc partial deletion (gr/gr, b 1 /b 2 and b 2 /b 3, p =  0.013, Fisher’s exact test). Of the 17 men with gr/gr partial deletions, 4 had SCOS, 8 MA and 5 HP. Of the 3 men with b 1 /b 3 partial deletions, all had MA. Men with a gr/gr partial deletion were <b>at</b> <b>higher</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> having HP or MA, men with a b 1 /b 3 partial deletion were <b>at</b> <b>higher</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> having MA, and men with a b 2 /b 3 partial deletion were <b>at</b> <b>higher</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> having MA or SCOS.
