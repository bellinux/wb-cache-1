40|$|In {{this paper}} I analyze a 3 -person voting {{game in which}} players {{sequentially}} choose <b>amendments</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> and then vote sophisticatedly on the resulting agenda. This game differs from previous work on endogenous agenda formation in {{that the number of}} items on the agenda is not fixed. Players keep making proposals until they can do no better. I find that there is a nonempty set of minimax equilibrium outcomes to the game, and that this set contains the simple von Neumann-Morgenstern stable set...|$|R
