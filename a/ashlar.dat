The ASI is presently involved in conservation activities of the wall, providing railings, environmental improvements and lighting of the area, {{at a cost of}} Rs 15 lakhs (US$30,000).|$|E
5|$|Decorated rustication. Sebastiano Serlio had {{decorated}} the blocks of <b>ashlar</b> in his rustication; {{by the end}} of the 16th century, Sicilian architects were ornamenting the blocks with carvings of leaves, fish-scales, and even sweets and shells; shells were later to become among the most prevalent ornamental symbols of Baroque design. Sometimes the rustication would be used for pillars rather than walls, a reversal of expectations and almost an architectural joke (illustration 2).|$|E

5|$|The castle {{was built}} {{to the east of}} the fourteenth-century town on a {{slightly}} raised location. The area enclosed within the castle's outer walls was about 2.8ha (7acres), but with outbuildings, other ancillary constructions and orchards, the total area has been estimated to be at least 8ha (20acres). The walls were constructed with rubble faced with <b>ashlar,</b> and even without their former polished facings the walls are about 3m (10ft) thick.|$|E

5|$|The {{park has}} two gate lodges; both are listed at grade II. The {{northern}} lodge at Slaughter Hill is by Blore and dates from 1847. In red brick with darker-brick diapering, stone dressings and a slate roof, {{it has a}} T-shaped plan with a single storey, and is Jacobean in style. It features two shaped gables, each decorated with a panel carved with Crewe Estate emblems, and a hexagonal central bay with a pyramidal roof which forms a porch. The Elizabethan-style Weston or Golden Gates Lodge {{to the south of}} the house dates from before 1865 and is attributed to William Eden Nesfield, although it is not typical of his style. In red brick with blue-brick zig–zag diapering, <b>ashlar</b> dressings and a slate roof, the lodge has two storeys, with a projecting canted bay to the road face. The driveway face has an <b>ashlar</b> panel with a shield bearing the Crewe family coat of arms.|$|E

5|$|Travelling {{further along}} Durham Road towards Gateshead are two more Grade II listed {{buildings}}. The first is Heathfield House, a two story villa built by John Wardle (designer of St Helen's Church) in 1865 and Musgrave House, an <b>ashlar</b> villa with raised quoins built in 18545 {{which has been}} used as a school but is no longer so. Both buildings are now converted to private flats.|$|E
5|$|A {{section of}} rubble wall about 15m (50ft) long and 4m (13ft) high remains, {{incorporated}} into an outbuilding of the adjacent farm on its north side. The ruins and the later farmhouse are jointly grade II listed and the castle remains are {{designated as a}} scheduled monument. The area {{to the south of}} the wall has been excavated to reveal the <b>ashlar</b> bases of two polygonal towers. The site is {{on the east side of}} Castle Street in a private garden to which there is no public access.|$|E
5|$|As far {{as can be}} determined, between arches 2 to 21, {{the outer}} facing of the {{superstructure}} consists of four layers of brick, followed by layers of rough stonemasonry bound with mortar. In contrast, between arches 22 and 26, {{as well as in}} both ramps on either end, the facing consists of <b>ashlar</b> blocks. The two repaired arches 27a and 27b are differentiated from the earlier work through the use of smaller unworked stones and the incorporation of irregularly placed brick tiles. In arch 26, the lower side of the arch still features a projecting bearing used for the placement of the falsework.|$|E
50|$|Ark of St. Sebastian - {{from the}} mid-16th century, it served for the {{administration}} of water to the town. The walls are made of granite <b>ashlars.</b>|$|R
