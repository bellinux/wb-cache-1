50|$|Sky Scottish {{was a short}} lived {{satellite}} television channel operating on the <b>analogue</b> Sky <b>TV</b> service for 18 months (between 1 November 1996 and 31 May 1998).|$|R
50|$|In 2006 DSGi {{was awarded}} the Queen's Award for Enterprise. The company {{announced}} that the Dixons brand would continue purely online and that all high-street stores would be rebranded Currys.digital. DSGi also bought 75% of Fotovista, a French photographic business. In January 2008, DSGi {{announced that it would}} stop selling <b>analogue</b> <b>TVs</b> and only sell integrated digital televisions, {{in an effort to get}} consumers ready for the digital switchover. In May 2008, DSGi announced that it would close 77 of its 177 UK Currys.digital shops as their building leases expired over the following five years.|$|R
5000|$|SCART is {{bi-directional}} regarding standard composite {{video and}} <b>analogue</b> audio. A <b>TV</b> will typically send the antenna {{audio and video}} signals to the SCART sockets {{all the time and}} watch for returned signals, to display and reproduce them. This allows [...] "transparent" [...] set-top boxes, without any tuner, which just [...] "hook" [...] and pre-process the TV signals. This feature is used for <b>analogue</b> pay <b>TV</b> like Canal Plus and was used for decoding teletext.|$|R

50|$|Comedy Central shares its free <b>analogue</b> cable <b>TV</b> {{frequency}} with Nickelodeon. This channel operated by UPC provided Nickelodeon from 5am to 7pm and Comedy Central through the night, however {{this has been}} discontinued.|$|R
5000|$|In {{light of}} the {{national}} switch-over from <b>analogue</b> to digital <b>TV</b> the television regulator, Ofcom, extended several <b>analogue</b> Local <b>TV</b> licences until local digital switchover became due in each respective area. This process was complete in October 2012. Meanwhile in February 2009 bids were invited for auctions for the first local digital multiplex licences to be offered in the UK - the first two of which were awarded shortly thereafter. However the awarding of additional licences was halted in favour {{of a network of}} local broadcasters.http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-18021144 ...|$|R
25|$|September 5, 2014: <b>Analogue</b> <b>TV</b> signals were {{switched}} off in East Macedonia and Thrace, Lemnos and Lesbos.|$|E
25|$|The Sunraysia region, {{including}} {{the city of}} Mildura, was the first region in Australia to switch off <b>analogue</b> <b>TV</b> broadcast {{in the implementation of}} the country's DTV transition process.|$|E
25|$|In {{the case}} of the Ceefax and ORACLE systems and their successors in the UK, the {{teletext}} signal is transmitted as part of the ordinary <b>analogue</b> <b>TV</b> signal but concealed from view in the Vertical Blanking Interval (VBI) television lines which do not carry picture information. The teletext signal is digitally coded as 45-byte packets, so the resulting rate is 7,175 bits per second per used lines (41 7-bit 'bytes' per line, on each of 25 frames per second).|$|E
50|$|In most <b>analogue</b> cable <b>TV</b> areas, {{customers}} {{received a}} letter from Virgin Media offering a free switch to their digital TV service. If the customer chose not to migrate to digital, they would've lost all TV channels when the switch off occurred.|$|R
50|$|In addition, a local {{television}} channel for the city, Made in Cardiff, {{is based in}} offices at St Mary's Street in the city centre. An <b>analogue</b> local <b>TV</b> channel, Capital TV, broadcast as a low-power RSL analogue station from 2002 to 2009.|$|R
50|$|Sky Scottish was a {{satellite}} television channel {{operating on the}} <b>analogue</b> Sky <b>TV</b> service between 1 November 1996 and 31 May 1998. The service was {{a joint venture between}} British Sky Broadcasting and SMG. It initially broadcast between 6.00pm and 8.00pm. The channel was closed due to poor ratings.|$|R
25|$|Before May 2009, {{the links}} to Lancashire and the North West were also {{seen in the}} media with Todmorden {{receiving}} an <b>analogue</b> <b>TV</b> signal from BBC North West. The local television transmitter relayed BBC One and BBC Two to the Todmorden area, however ITV and Channel 4 was different and has always been relayed from Emley Moor (via Cornholme) which broadcasts ITV Yorkshire. Since 2009 all services were relayed via Cornholme so local television links with the North West were lost.|$|E
25|$|DVB-T was {{repeatedly}} tested from 2RN's Three Rock Mountain transmitter, with relatively long tests in 1998 and 2001, and shorter tests in 2004, {{with a single}} multiplex carrying the four Irish analogue terrestrial channels, and Tara Television while it was in existence, on both UHF (channel 26) and VHF (channel D). These were under temporary licences for testing, which are regularly awarded. RTÉast Networks also broadcast test DVB-T with <b>analogue</b> <b>TV</b> and radio channels from the Clermont Carn transmitter in the Cooley Mountains, County Louth with some signal bleed into the North.|$|E
25|$|In {{areas where}} {{analogue}} signals had terminated, older receiving equipment {{was likely to}} require replacement or upgrade. This process was subsidised by the UK Government for those on low incomes. Contracts for this operation were awarded to BSkyB in the Border Television region. Upgrading of analogue receiving equipment required a Freeview set-top box (or other DVB-T capable digital receiver). Where an <b>analogue</b> <b>TV</b> recording device was in use this ideally would require a separate Freeview set-top box, to replicate the previous functionality of recording and watching different programme sources.|$|E
25|$|The digital {{switchover}} process involved discontinuing <b>analogue</b> terrestrial <b>TV</b> broadcasts, {{which in some}} areas allowed for greater signal strength and/or better coverage of digital multiplexes. The process concluded on 24 October 2012, when {{digital switchover}} completed in Northern Ireland (the same day as the Republic of Ireland also completed its digital switchover).|$|R
50|$|In the IPTV network, Telekom Entertain, {{the channel}} {{has also been}} {{available}} in HDTV since 20 September 2013. On 15 October 2013 ProSiebenMaxx started HDTV broadcasting in the network of Unitymedia. The CEO René Carl announced, that the intention is to start a HDTV channel on the HD+ platform. The channel is also available on <b>analogue</b> cable <b>TV.</b>|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{using the}} Rec. ITU-R P. 1546 {{explaining}} a propagation prediction {{model in the}} VHF and UHF bands, we propose the analytical methodology for calculating the service distance and field strength for <b>analogue</b> and digital <b>TV</b> receivers. From the derived formulation of the receiver field strength, some computation results are presented and {{discussed in terms of}} the equivalent level of service caused by <b>analogue</b> to digital <b>TV</b> conversion. The suggested method is also applicable to the analysis of frequency coordination or compatibility from unwanted signal in VHF and UHF bands...|$|R
25|$|As {{the switch}} to digital-only {{terrestrial}} transmission progressed, BBC Two was (in each region in turn) the first <b>analogue</b> <b>TV</b> channel to be replaced with the BBC multiplex, at first four, then two weeks ahead of the other four channels. This was required for those relay transmitters that had no current Freeview service giving viewers time to purchase the equipment, unless they had already selected a satellite or cable service. The last region for BBC Two to end on analogue terrestrial television was Northern Ireland on 10 October 2012.|$|E
25|$|The primary {{advantage}} of OFDM over single-carrier schemes {{is its ability}} to cope with severe channel conditions (for example, attenuation of high frequencies in a long copper wire, narrowband interference and frequency-selective fading due to multipath) without complex equalization filters. Channel equalization is simplified because OFDM may be viewed as using many slowly modulated narrowband signals rather than one rapidly modulated wideband signal. The low symbol rate makes the use of a guard interval between symbols affordable, making it possible to eliminate intersymbol interference (ISI) and utilize echoes and time-spreading (on <b>analogue</b> <b>TV</b> these are visible as ghosting and blurring, respectively) to achieve a diversity gain, i.e. a signal-to-noise ratio improvement. This mechanism also facilitates the design of single frequency networks (SFNs), where several adjacent transmitters send the same signal simultaneously at the same frequency, as the signals from multiple distant transmitters may be combined constructively, rather than interfering as would typically occur in a traditional single-carrier system.|$|E
25|$|Israel started digital {{transmissions}} in MPEG-4 on Sunday, 2 August 2009 and analogue transmissions {{ended on}} 31 March 2011. Israel {{was the first}} nation in the Middle East and the first non-European nation to shut down its <b>analogue</b> <b>TV</b> distribution system. The new service which is operated by The Second Authority for Television and Radio in Israel currently offers 6 SD TV channels and 30 national and regional (private) radio services. According to government decisions, the system will expand to include two additional multiplexes that will carry new channels and HD versions of the existing channels. There is a proposition by the Ministry of Finance to run a tender in order {{to hand over the}} maintenance of the system to a private company that, in return, will receive an extended license and will be able to offer pay TV channels. In this matter nothing has been decided upon until the end on 2012.|$|E
5000|$|Mary Curtis became Director of Digital Switchover (DSO) in September 2010 and {{reported}} to the Director General. She oversaw the transition from <b>Analogue</b> to Digital <b>TV</b> broadcast, which was completed in October 2012 ...|$|R
50|$|In other countries, {{there are}} reports of pirate TV digital multiplexes, but they are very rare and usually {{suspected}} to have been false reports, mistaking overspill from authorized multiplexes in neighboring regions or nearby foreign countries. Viewing numbers may be much smaller than <b>analogue</b> pirate <b>TV</b> since re-tuning a digital television may be an entirely automated process which may ignore unauthorized multiplexes, or place such channels in an obscure section of the electronic program guide.|$|R
50|$|Some older HTIBs {{were also}} having built in VCR, beside DVD, also {{comprising}} a tuner, {{or some of}} them were having both VCR, DVD Recorder (some of them with hard disk) and a tuner for <b>TV,</b> <b>analogue</b> or digital).|$|R
