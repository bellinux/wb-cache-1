5|$|Two events {{affected}} me most, one when a colleague dropped himself from second floor to escape under-covered police who stormed school. The second incident was when a dear teacher was arrested. That is when my voice started {{to rise and}} become annoying. I was caught vandalizing a school wall by writing apolitical human rights statements on school walls and was given the choice to either be submitted to police or to switch school. So I took {{the easy way out}} <b>and</b> <b>since</b> <b>I</b> was the top student back then, I choose to switch to Sheikh Abdul Aziz school.|$|E

When I have boyfriends, it's always just one at a time. I loved Ike almost like I loved Harry, but it wasn't {{beautiful}} and clean, because Ike was so mean. I'm careful with my love. I can wait; I think it's coming. I can wait." ...|$|E

500|$|... uile is {{a natural}} talent with the fair sex, <b>and</b> <b>since</b> <b>I</b> am persuaded that all the natural inclinations are good and right in themselves, I am {{of the opinion that}} this one should be {{cultivated}} like the others... This peculiar cleverness given to the fair sex is a very equitable compensation for their lesser share of strength, a compensation without which women would be not manâ€™s companion but his slave. It is by means of this superiority in talent that she keeps herself his equal and that she governs him while obeying him... She has in her favor only her art and her beauty.|$|E
500|$|In 1996 Penman {{published}} {{the first in}} the series of medieval mystery novels. Penman's first mystery, The Queen's Man, was a finalist for an Edgar Award for Best First Mystery from the Mystery Writers of America. Penman explains her reasons for turning to the mystery genre after writing only historical novels: [...] "By the time I'd finished researching and writing When Christ and His Saints Slept, I was in danger of burning out. For {{the first time in nearly}} two decades, my boundless enthusiasm for the Middle Ages had begun to flag. So I decided I needed a change of pace, <b>and</b> <b>since</b> <b>I</b> am a long-time mystery fan, it occurred to me that a medieval mystery might be fun to write. Once that idea took root, it was probably inevitable that I'd choose to write about Eleanor of Aquitaine, surely one of history's most memorable women." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{returning}} from his vacation, Saadiq started writing and recording The Way I See It, which took four months. In {{an interview for}} Sound on Sound, he discussed his comfort level when returning to Blakeslee Recording Company: [...] "The music for this album flowed organically, naturally, <b>and</b> <b>since</b> <b>I</b> have my own studio I was able to perfect it and take my time to make it right. I was able {{to live with it}} day after day, and I think that {{had a lot to do}} with how the album turned out." [...] He wrote the songs extemporaneously, often by playing guitar and improvising riffs. He subsequently sung them while playing each instrument one at a time, including guitar, bass, and basic piano parts that he planned to include on the recordings. He attributed this secluded approach to [...] "the state of the industry" [...] and idealized [...] "bounc ideas off other people, do some writing with them, take the material to my band and say, 'OK, let's cut it,' with the orchestra already there. That's my dream. I'd crank records out weekly if I had staff writers like they did at Stax and Motown".|$|E

500|$|Robinson {{received}} his degree in 1973 and was ordained a deacon in June 1973 at the cathedral {{of the diocese}} of Newark, New Jersey. [...] He served as curate at Christ Church in Ridgewood, New Jersey, and was ordained a priest six months later. He and his wife remained at the Ridgewood parish for two years until June 1975. They then moved to New Hampshire, where Boo had grown up. Their goal was {{to start a business}} and ministry: in the winter it was called [...] "The Sign of the Dove Retreat Center" [...] and in the summer it became [...] "Pony Farm". [...] Boo still runs [...] "Pony Farm" [...] as a horse camp for children. In 1977, Robinson began working with a committee in the Diocese of New Hampshire to study human sexuality and co-authored a small manual on the subject. Robinson and Boo's first daughter, Jamee, was born in 1977, followed by a second daughter, Ella, in 1981. Robinson treasures his marriage stating, [...] "hat is inextricably tied up with having children. <b>And</b> <b>since</b> <b>I</b> cannot imagine my life without Jamee and Ella, it's just a completely irrelevant question for me. And I don't regret having been married to Boo, either, even if there had not been children. It's just a part of my journey, and why would I possibly regret that?" ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{origin of}} this operationalist {{approach}} {{can be found in}} Dennett's immediately preceding work. Dennett (1988) explains consciousness in terms of access consciousness alone, denying the independent existence of what Ned Block has labeled phenomenal consciousness. He argues that [...] "Everything real has properties, <b>and</b> <b>since</b> <b>I</b> don't deny the reality of conscious experience, I grant that conscious experience has properties". Having related all consciousness to properties, he concludes that they cannot be meaningfully distinguished from our judgements about them. He writes: ...|$|E

2500|$|Hazlitt justifies his own {{contrary}} attitude at length: [...] "When one {{is found}} fault with for nothing, or for doing one's best, one {{is apt to}} give the world their revenge. All the former {{part of my life}} I was treated as a cipher; <b>and</b> <b>since</b> <b>I</b> have got into notice, I have been set upon as a wild beast. When this is the case, and you can expect as little justice as candour, you naturally in self-defence take refuge in a sort of misanthropy and cynical contempt for mankind." ...|$|E
2500|$|Browning {{responded to}} Irving's claim that because Browning had done {{work for the}} Yad Vashem center in Jerusalem that made him an [...] "Israeli agent" [...] and thereby {{compromised}} his scholarly abilities by stating: [...] "If that was the case, then since I {{had been at the}} [...] Holocaust Museum, I would also have been an agent of the American government, <b>and</b> <b>since</b> <b>I</b> have received scholarships in Germany, I would be an agent of the German government, so I must be a very duplicitous fellow to be able to follow these regimes." [...] Irving seemed anxious for Browning's approval, and Browning later recalled that Irving behaved as if {{the two of them were}} on [...] "a joint journey of exploration and discovery." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1973, {{after her}} split from Elvis, Presley {{set up a}} joint venture with her friend and stylist Olivia Bis. Together they opened a {{clothing}} boutique in Los Angeles called Bis & Beau. Elvis was supportive of Priscilla's venture, and even contacted several friends in public relations to help with promotion for the launch. In a 1973 interview to promote the opening of the store, Priscilla said, [...] "After the separation, I had to make up my mind about what I wanted to do, <b>and</b> <b>since</b> <b>I</b> had worked with Olivia {{for such a long time}} on my own clothes, I decided to try it professionally. We both do the designing for the shop, and have people who sew for us." [...] The shop was a successful venture, with celebrity clients including Cher, Lana Turner, Barbra Streisand, and Natalie Wood shopping there regularly. The shop closed in 1976.|$|E

2500|$|The series {{introduced}} {{new love}} interests for both Tony and Ziva {{in the latter}} half of Season 8, and in February 2011, Michael Ausiello from TVLine announced that Ziva's boyfriend [...] "Ray arrives in this season's 20th episode and is described as a handsome, charming, intelligent federal agent of Mediterranean or Latin American descent. He has a strong, nice-guy demeanor butâ€”I'm quoting from the casting notice hereâ€”'there's a hint of a mystery behind his smile.'" [...] A week later, Glasberg described the character as a [...] "fun, smart, exciting addition", and Michael Weatherly commented, [...] "I think itâ€™s going to be interesting. Tony cares about Ziva and wants to make sure sheâ€™s not mixed up with the wrong kind of guy, so heâ€™s going to be watchful and protective of her." [...] After Enrique Murciano was cast for the role of Ray Cruz, Cote de Pablo said, [...] "You never know if you're gonna have chemistry, <b>and</b> <b>since</b> <b>I</b> had no say in the casting, I was sort of waiting to meet this famous Enrique Murciano." [...] She went on to describe his appearance in the show: [...] "There's a lovely scene in which he basically brings his interpretation of 'fancy' candlelight dinner, which takes place by the vending machines at NCIS. It's really funny. There's kissing involved. We kept it light and we kept it fun, and we kept it like two people who are genuinely in to each other and wanting to move things along. It's about what's going on between the lines. These two people are touchy-feely, and that's different for Ziva." ...|$|E
