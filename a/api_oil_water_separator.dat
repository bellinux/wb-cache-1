Oil separator helps in removing the oily from the waste water. By removing the <b>oil</b> from waste <b>water,</b> it becomes free of oil pollution. This is mainly due to oleophilic material used in the oil separator. This oil separator can be used in the effluent treatment plant. This project consists of construction, fabrication details, assembly, working and applications of <b>oil</b> and <b>water</b> <b>separator.</b> The belt speed, oil recovery rate and oil recovery efficiency are the operating parameters of oil separator.

50|$|Centrifugal <b>oil</b> and <b>water</b> <b>separators</b> do {{have their}} {{disadvantage}}s. One known disadvantage of these separators {{is that they}} tend to have low powered suction. For example, when the pump end is dry and the impeller is rotating at high speeds, it is simply not powerful enough to lift the oily water mixture into the separator. For this reason, these separators must always be primed before use.|$|R
50|$|Section 311 of the Clean Water Act, {{as amended}} by the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, applies to cruise ships and prohibits {{discharge}} of oil or hazardous substances in harmful quantities into or upon U.S. navigable waters, or into or upon {{the waters of the}} contiguous zone, or which may affect natural resources in the U.S. EEZ (extending 200 mi offshore). Coast Guard regulations prohibit discharge of oil within 12 mi from shore, unless passed through a 15-ppm <b>oil</b> <b>water</b> <b>separator,</b> and unless the discharge does not cause a visible sheen. Beyond 12 mi, oil or oily mixtures can be discharged while a vessel is proceeding en route and if the oil content without dilution is less than 100 ppm. Vessels are required to maintain an Oil Record Book to record disposal of oily residues and discharges overboard or disposal of bilge water.|$|R

This method is based on FCI Environmental Inc. 's fiber optic chemical sensor (FOCS) technology. It provides accurate and reliable data to improve overall water processing on platforms.

40|$|This paper reports recent {{developments}} in oil trapping and oil biodegrading systems in pervious pavements and in infiltration systems {{used in conjunction with}} non-pervious surfaces. The advances made in the technology and operation of pervious surfaces fitted with an integrated <b>oil</b> <b>water</b> <b>separator</b> will be described. This involves a newly developed, floating mat system which serves to interact with any oil which, {{in the event of a}} large spill, passes through the initial oil retaining structures of a pervious pavement or other form of infiltration system (see Puehmeier et al., 2004). It also provides the ideal surface upon which the oil degrading organisms will thrive. The ability of these enhanced systems to produce a diverse biodegrading bacterial/fungal community is reported. A further study will report a comparison of biodegradation of new and used mineral oil trapped on these structures. The second area of research reported will be associated with a novel oil separating system designed to be either coupled closely to an infiltrating filter trench which can be used in conjunction with impervious surfaces or to direct the water back under an impermeable surface for further treatment, retention and attenuation of flow. This system was shown to be highly effective in removing hydrocarbons and has the advantage that it can be used as a retrofit solution to allow disconnection of existing impervious surfaces without exposing groundwater to contamination...|$|R
40|$|Coalescer is used {{in several}} {{industrial}} applications. In refineries, coalescer used in the separation of hydrocarbon solution such as {{the separation of the}} dispersion during the washing stage. In the offshore applications coalescer is used to separate <b>water</b> from <b>oil</b> and natural gas for water and glycol from the condensate. Coalescer is used to separate <b>oil</b> from <b>water</b> and all mixture.

In this study, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is used to determine how much oil content out of the water output. The simulation was done by varying the distance bulkhead in the coalescer is 1 inch, 1. 2 inch and 1. 5 inch. The simulation results of this coalescer shows that the oil content in ppm (parts per million), which is at least 1 inch bulkhead, is 27. 9 ppm. The smaller the distance bulkhead inside the coalescer, the smaller the oil content is obtained because the oil will stick in the flopak media and will inhibit the flow of oil due to the influence of viscosity...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} aquifer characteristics of a hydrocarbon-impacted site at Swarthmore College and to develop a computer model that would simulate the free product migration, the ultimate goal being to enhance oil recovery at the site. Hydraulic conductivity, storativity, and transmissivity were calculated from field tests and were found to be 1. 77 •l 0 - 5 cm/ s, 0. 00057, and 1, 500 gpd/ft, respectively. Using these values, a computer model was developed. This model predicted drawdown contour lines which matched experimental drawdown measurements. It also predicted that in order to depress and maintain the groundwater table below the level of the storm main that traverses the site, a pumping rate of 4 gallons per minute (gpm) from monitoring well MW- 1 B 6 would be required. This depression would prevent free product from intercepting the storm main and would therefore greatly reduce its migration towards the Crum Creek tributary. Based on pumping test results, a continuous pumping scheme of 2 gpm from MW- 1 B 6 proved to significantly increase free product recovery, averaging 0. 45 gallons recovered per day, or a recovery rate of 0. 019 gallons per hour. Thus, 42 gallons of free product were recovered in the course of this study, once continuous pumping was begun, that is, from March 3, 1997 to April 28, 1997. Finally, the remediation system, consisting of placing the pump and Abanaki in MW- 1 B 6, and passing the pumped groundwater through the <b>oil</b> and <b>water</b> <b>separator</b> was successful...|$|R
30|$|Water {{flooding}} as {{a secondary}} oil recovery method {{has been one}} of the most common and efficient fluid injection methods over a century. This can be attributed to various reasons, including high water availability that leads to lower capital and operating costs and high efficiency in displacing light to medium <b>API</b> <b>oils.</b> Therefore, <b>water</b> flooding is technically and economically preferred compared to other enhanced oil recovery techniques (Austad 2013; Kazemi Nia Korrani 2014; Mohanty and Chandrasekhar 2013; Yousef et al. 2010). Recently, much research has shown that controlling the composition and salinity of the injected water (known as low salinity water) disturbs the equilibrium condition and, hence, results in higher oil recovery efficiency through favorable influence on oil/brine/rock interactions compared to common seawater flooding (Al-Attar et al. 2013; Al-Shalabi and Sepehrnoori 2016; Austad 2013; Austad et al. 2011; Emadi and Sohrabi 2013; Gupta and Mohanty 2011; Karimi et al. 2016; Li 2011; Morrow and Buckley 2011; Nasralla et al. 2011; RezaeiDoust et al. 2009; Seccombe et al. 2008; Strand et al. 2006; Tang and Morrow 1997, 1999; Yildiz and Morrow 1996; Zaeri et al. 2018). Among various mechanisms suggested for low salinity water, the complex crude oil/aqueous solution interactions are not yet well understood. Several studies have been undertaken to investigate the sensitivity of interfacial properties of the brine–oil interface to the salinity and ions of the aqueous phase (Cai et al. 1996; Guo et al. 2013; Hiemenz and Rajagopalan 1997; Lashkarbolooki et al. 2014 a, 2016 a, c; Serrano-Saldaña et al. 2004; Yarranton and Masliyah 1996; Yousef et al. 2010).

During the desalting process, the challenge is to overcome the existence of an emulsion layer at the interface between <b>oil</b> and <b>water.</b> In petroleum industry normally emulsions encountered are some kind of water droplets dispersed in a continuous phase of oil. In crude oil emulsions, emulsifying agents are present at the oil-water interface, hindering this coalescence process. Such agents include scale and clay particles, added chemicals or indigenous crude oil components like asphaltenes, resins, waxes and naphthenic acids. Many techniques made available to gas oil separation plant operators to minimize the effect of tight emulsions.
